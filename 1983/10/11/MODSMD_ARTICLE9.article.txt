# SMASH lecture sheds light on eye's amplifier
## 
### LEONARD SANCHEZ 
In the first of the Stanford Medical and
Scientific Highlights (SMASH) lectures,
Lubert Stryer, professor of structural biol
ogy, described the biochemical basis of the
human eye's superb light amplification sys
tem.
Even a single photon, the smallest possi
ble unit of light energy, provides sufficient
energy to produce the sensation of vision.
These photons interact with two highly spe
cialized light receptor cells called rods and
cones, said Stryer.
The chemical reactions driven by the
cell/light interaction is a crucial step in our
visual response. These reactions take place
on the retina, the innermost coat of the
back part of the eye on which the image is

formed. In humans, the retina has 100 mil
lion rods and seven million cones, Stryer
said.
One feature contributing to the eye's
great efficiency is the use of two types of
light receptors. Each type is sensitive to a
different form of optical stimulation. Rods
are responsible for the vision of silhouettes
or outlines, and the cones enable us to see
detail and are responsible for color vision,
said Strver.
In order to create the subjective sensa
tion of "vision," light reflected from the ob
ject viewed must be focused on the retina.
The process by which light enters the eye
and is focused is called accommodation.
Accommodation is achieved by dilation or

contraction of the pupil, and flattening or
thickening of the lens, Stryer said.
Light creates a chain reaction of chemical
events triggering a nerve impulse which
travels to the brain. When light strikes rod
cells on the retina, rhodopsin molecules
absorb energy. The energized rhodopsin
changes into a related molecule. This newly
created "activated rhodopsin" decreases
the ease with which sodium ions enter the
rod cell and thereby causes the nerves to
fire, said Stryer.
The conversion of rhodopsin into ac
tivated rhodopsin occurs within a billionth
of a second. The extreme rapidity with
which the chemical reactions associated
with vision occur allows us to view the

world virtually continuously rather than as a
series of snapshots.
Activated rhodopsin causes local chemi
cal changes in the retina which are respon
sible for the amplified response to the im
pinging photons. Although rhodopsin is
sensitive to one photon, it would take 80
years for the molecule to assume its ac
tivated form without the aid of light energy.
This promotes the reliable graded
responses to light that we find in the human
eye, Stryer said.
As a result of the biochemical amplifier, a
single photon is translated into a powerful
neural impulse. In the dark, the rod cells
usually have an inward flow of sodium ions.
In the light, however, these currents stop

when the rod is hit by a photon, increasing
the negative charge inside the rod. The
induced negative charge produces the
electric current which travels along the
neuron to the brain where the light im
pulses are processed, said Strver.
The second lecture in the series of
four SMASH lectures this quarter shall
be held on Friday, Oct. 21 in Fairchild
Auditorium at the Med Center. The topic of
the upcoming lecture is Localization and
Characterization of Gastrin-releasing
Peptide and Coritcotropin releasing Factor.
It will be presented by Jack Barchas, profes
sor of psychiatry. Speaking with Barchas
will be Kevin Roth, a sixth-year medical stu
dent.
