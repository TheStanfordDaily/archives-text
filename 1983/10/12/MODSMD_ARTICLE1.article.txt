# Faculty committee reports on Reagan library
## Meese urges quick action by trustees 
### DOUGLAS JEHL HEATHER MILLAR 
The Board of Trustees will move
ahead with "all deliberate haste" in
its consideration of a proposal to
house a Reagan presidential library
complex here, according to William
Kimball, president of the Board.
Kimball's comments came after a
speakerphone conference between
White House Counselor Edwin
Meese and the Board of Trustees
yesterday.
Since this is the tirst time that
anything has been reported to the
Board regarding the Reagan library,
the session was one of reporting
and discussion. In addition to
Meese, the Board heard from Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
and Hoover Institution Director
W. Glenn Campbell.
Though the White House has ex
pressed a desire for a decision soon -
housing such a complex at Stanford
was tirst mentioned as early as
February 1981 — the Board took no
votes.
The matter was referred to the
trustee committee on the Hoover

Institution. This committee will con
fer by telephone tomorrow "to mull
things over." Kimball said it is be
doubtful that the Board would take
action on the White House proposal
until the next meeting of the trus
tees in December.
"We told Mr. Meese that we'd get
back to him. We didn't say when,"
Kimball said after the meeting. "We
have our regular procedures to go
through. While we appreciate the
need for haste — and we're not just
sitting on our hands —wedon'twant
to take any shortcuts either."
According to Kimball, Meese em
phasized the importance of
presidential papers for scholarly re
search and added that the collection
will include cabinet papers as well as
presidential papers, implying that
the sooner the trustees decide, the
larger the collection will be.
"The White House is anxious, but
I don't want to use the word
'pressure.' They (the administration)
have had proposals from other insti
tutions, and they clearly should get
back to those institutions with an
answer."
Kimball said the Board will try not
to let the upcoming presidential
campaign influence action on the
issue.
The issue of the presidential com
plex is reported to have dominated
the meeting, which was character
ized by one of the largest turnouts
in recent years.

Kennedy's presentation included
a report by Economics Prof. James
Rosse which emphasized the need
for slow, careful consideration of
the White House proposal.
Campbell's statement included a
report by Hoover Fellow Martin An
derson, which urged a more accept
ing attitude toward the complex.
As the proposal now stands, it the
University accepts the Reagan li
brary it must also accept a Reagan
museum and a policy center. Accor
ding to Kimball, Meese did not say
that the White House would con
sider separating the three compo
nents.
However, Kimball indicated that
the Board will consider each part of
the proposal separately. Meese is
also reported to have leaned in favor
of the Anderson report, which
recommends that the Hoover Insti
tution run the complex, should it be
accepted.
In other Board action, the Com
mittee on Investments considered a
draft of a goals and policies state
ment for the University endowment.
The new statement, which is ex
pected to come more in line with
current practices than the present
statement, will emphasize diver
sification, venture capital and inter
national irwestment. The Subcom
mittee o'i Investment Policies and
Evaluation will address this issue at
its meeting tonight. The final ver
sion of the statement is expected to
be presented before the Board at
the December meeting.
The Board also approved the
Medical Center Faculty Practice Plan
Budget, which is the fund from

which Medical Center physicians
are paid. The Board also approved
additional funds for the Stanford
West project due to delays in
negotiations with the City of Palo
Alto.
A replacement for (he COIN coin
vestment faculty/staff home loan
program was also approved. The
new program, dubbed the 10/30 Pro
gram, administers 30-year fixed
interest-rate first mortgages.
