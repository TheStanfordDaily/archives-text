## Video games: dungeons, dragons ... and quarters 
### DENISE LEW 
Tresidder Union Recrea
tion Center and the Kappa
Sigma House have one thing
in common: video and pinball
games.
With 35 machines available
for community recreation,
Tresidder's center enjoys a
steady flow of people
throughout the year, while the
traternity houses one video
game and two pinball
machines for members and
visitors.
Having the video games in
the house is not only con
venient, but also "a good
excuse for a study break,"
Kappa Sigma house manager
Scott Ciffin said. Kappa Sigma
has had pinball games for
years, but the video game is a
new addition, he said.
The fraternity got the
machines when a group of
pinball addicts convinced a
video supplier to place a few
games in the house on a trial
basis. Interest in the games
grew, and Kappa Sigma has
since continued to exchange
machines with a vending com
pany in San Jose.
Compared with Tresidder's
collection of games, Kappa
Sigma's video world is a small
one, but Giffin hopes to get
more advanced video games
in the future.
The Tresidder Recreation
Center gets its games from a
distributor in San Jose, which
receives half the profits from
the games. Every two months
some of the games are
exchanged for new ones.
Dungeons and Dragons,
Luke Skywalker and computer
baseball are among the latest
additions at Tresidder.
Keith Searbright, a first year
graduate student in geophy
sics, is one of the many stu
dents who play Tresidder's
video games. Although he ad
mits the games are "a waste of
money," he enjoys them as a
change of pace from studying.
"It's fun to beat the ma
chine," he said.
Sophomore Jay Branden
burg agreed that the games
are a welcome change from
studying. "It helps relieve
some of the pressure, doing
something mindless," he said.
Brandenburg enjoys plaving
Ragman, his favorite game,
with his roommate Ken
Musen. He often stops by
Tresidder on the way to the li
brary after dinner.

Other students enjoy the
games for their visual appeal.
Freshman Alyson Yarus enjoys
the game just because "it's fun
to watch even when you're
losing." She is not concerned
with the competitive aspect of
the game. "I've killed a couple
of pterodactyls but I don't
know how I did it," she said.
Tresidder has had few prob
lems with the machines break
ing down, recreation center
manager Cheryl St. Clair
said.The only threat to the
games, she said, comes from
"peoples' tempers," but most
video game players express
their frustrations verbally
rather than physically.

The peak playing times at
Tresidder are evenings before
dinner, Friday afternoons and
weekends. Dead Week and
finals week are also busy times
for the recreation center.
While the video games at
Tresidder provide students
with a diversion from school
work, the games at Kappa
Sigma house also provide
house members with a source
of revenue.
The machines at the frater
nity brought in about $1000
last spring quarter, house trea
surer Tom Macdonald said.
Kappa Sigma retains half the
profits from the machines and
deposits the money in a house

improvement fund. So far, the
extra income has provided the
house with a microwave oven
and a new set of stereo
speakers.
"Once you start playing,

you don't realize how fast you
throw a dollar away," Mac
donald said. With each quar
ter he puts in a machine, he
makes a 12 1/2 cent donation
to the house, he added.

Students seem to enjoy the
convenience of the video
games at Tresidder and Kappa
Sigma residents are pleased
with the popularity of their
small but profitable game

room. Whether in need of a
study break or a challenge to
their skills, Stanford students
can often be found using their
quarters for more than just
laundry.


FLASHY STUDY BREAK: Students in Tresidder's recreation center enjoy a variety of video
games, ranging from Star Wars to electronic baseball. Even students who admit the games

are "brainless" or "a waste of money" sometimes indulge. The busiest times at 1 residder art
before dinner, Friday afternoons, weekends â€” and Dead Week and finals week.
