## The
						Stanford Daily But we study weekends 
### 
There was once a day when students here
could take advantage of the Stanford credo
"Work hard, play hard" and occasionally be
seen in the library on a Saturday night without
being forever labeled a hopeless grind. This is
probably still the case ... if students can find a
library open on Saturday evenings.
During the summer, administrators decided
to cut the weekend hours of Meyer Undergrad
uate Library, a fact which some have not yet
realized. The library now closes its doors at 10
p.m. on Fridays and at 6 p.m. on Saturdays.
Closing time used to be midnight on both
days. A brief survey of the hours of all the other
libraries on campus reveals that only Lane
Medical Library and the Law Library — both of
which are closed to undergraduates under nor
mal circumstances — stay open past 6 p.m. on
Saturday. The University seems to be sending a
signal to undergraduates: They shouldn't study
much on Friday nights, and not at all on Satur
day nights. Unless this is the intent, there
seems to be no logical reason to close the li
brary early on weekends.
According to the library powers that be, the
reduced weekend service compensates for
later hours during Dead Week. But if the
original schedule allowing for 96 hours per
week tipped the scale to the generous side —
and this is debatable — the current schedule
does nothing but tip the scale in the opposite
direction. By adding approximately 10 hours of
service during Dead Week, the director of
Meyer has justified cutting 64 hours of service
during the rest of the quarter. This simply
doesn't make sense, mathematically or practi
cally.
More importantly, Stanford University
should not cut corners by closing one of its

main libraries; as an academic institution, the
University should encourage — not discourage
students to study. It a student thinks he needs
to study Saturday night, the University should
be accommodating. Library officials counter
with the argument that the study rooms on the
ground floor of the library will be open until 2
a.m. every evening so desperate students can
find a place to study. While better than noth
ing, the study rooms hardly fill the bill. The
capacity of these rooms doesn't even approach
that of the rest of the library, and during mid
terms Meyer is full on Saturday nights. Besides
the fact that the tables and chairs in the open
rooms are uncomfortable, the rooms are not
equipped with copying machines, typewriters,
reference desks, reserve reading or books.
Perhaps library officials don't realize how
much copying, typing, reserve reading and re
search gets done on Saturday nights during the
crunch. In fact, by making it inconvenient for
people to study on Saturday nights during
most of the quarter, the University is encourag
ing cramming.
What is most disturbing about this decision
is that it exposes a fundamental misun
derstanding of the undergraduate lifestyle.
Few students hole up in the library every Satur
day night, but when faced with a block of work
most will get it done, and this often means
working through Saturday night.
Perhaps if the administrators had ever tried
to study for two midterms or do a problem set
or a paper while speakers pound out a party
tape in the dorm lounge downstairs and tipsy
roommates slosh in and out of the room, they
would realize that a quiet library to study in on
Saturday is more than a luxury, it's a necessity.
