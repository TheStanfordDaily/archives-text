Parking stickers
I picked up today's Stanford
Daily (Oct. 4) and noticed an ar
ticle titled "Campus Bus Line to
Expand." As I began to read it, I
had to check the date again to
make sure this wasn't the April
Fool's issue.
Our beloved Committee on
Parking and Transportation, not
content with its previous idiocies,
is climbing to new heights. Not
only do they plan to continue
pouring our parking money down
a hole (the infamous Marguerite
shuttle "service"), they plan to
expand it!. They're going to ad
vertise it! And they speak of these
plans without a hint of shame!
The head of the Committee on
Parking and Transportation is
Mason Yearian. Quickly checking
my faculty/staff directory, I find his
home is on Cottrell Way, in Stan
ford, California.
Guess what? He lives right here
at Stanford! He doesn't need to
buy a parking sticker! He can walk
around campus. But is that good
enough for him? Not at all! He
wants me to pay for his shuttle
bus.
Mason and his fellow committee
members are having a great time at
my expense. I live in Palo Alto in
easy bicycling distance, but there
are times (rainy days, meetings,
errands, etc.) when I need to park
on campus near where I work. So
I'm stuck with buying a $100 hun
ting license.
This year I bought one of those
nifty "floating" stickers so I can
drive either of my cars to work.
The thing will probably be stolen
before the year is out and I'll have
the privilege of forking over again
to replace it.
I can't conceive of any shuttle
service on this campus being use
ful to me or any other off-campus
commuter. The able-bodied don't
need it, and the disabled need
something better. No place on
campus, except perhaps Escondido
Village, is more than a 10-minute
walk from my office. For rainy days
I have an umbrella. For trips to the
Stanford Shopping Center I drive

or take my bike.
Why should I ever want to wait
for a bus? Does the committee
think it can eventually jack up the
parking sticker fees so high that I
won't buy one? In that case I'll
gladly pay parking fines to Santa
Clara County and Stanford will
never see the money. I'll keep on
driving when necessary.

No win situation?
For nearly a year now I have
watched the progress of the
Hoover debate, which has now
turned into the Reagan complex
debate. In that time there has been
no movement towards reconcilia
tion of the parties involved, and in
fact, many disinterested observers
would say the situation has
deteriorated.
I would hope the situation can
be reversed. Should present trends
continue, the University, the Board
of Trustees and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy are faced
with at best a win/lose decision
and at worst a lose/lose situation.
Should a decision be rendered
one would assume the situation to
be resolved. One group will have
won and the other will have lost,
case closed. Vet, will it be closed? I
doubt there is anyone on campus,
who feels that the losing
party will just go away. No,
following the decision there will be
charges raised against the decision
makers, regardless of who they
are, that they lacked legitimacy and
the losing group will vow to con
tinue the fight.
Is there an alternative? Yes, I
believe that a win/win resolution is
possible. No, I don't know what it
is, nor do I know anyone at Stan
ford who does. I think the answer
lies somewhere in the minds of all
those concerned with the issue. It
will only be drawn out in a con
sensus decision-making process
which involves the entire commu
nity and has as its goal satisfying all

parties concerns.

Keep U.S. in Lebanon
The scenario of civil war in
Lebanon, although subdued since
Sept. 26 as a result of a precarious
cease-fire agreement, presents a
frustrating crisis to U.S. policy
makers — frustrating because the
situation is so volatile and their
options are so limited: They have
no choice but to keep U.S. forces
in Lebanon.
Though today a cease-fire
dominates the scene in Lebanon,
minor skirmishes arise almost daily
between all factions involved in the
civil war, displaying the subdued
but very real tension in the
country. The stabilizing role of
U.S. forces now stationed in
Lebanon certainly has not ended,
nor will it end in the very near
future. Here's why:
The U.S. military presence in
Lebanon is certainly partially re
sponsible for the cease-fire existing
today. In face of the U.S. show of
force the Syrian-backed Druze
realized that they would not be
allowed to forcibly gain control
over Lebanon — at least not as long
as U.S. peacekeeping forces
remained there.
If U.S. forces were to withdraw,
however, the Druze militia, with
the help of their hefty Syrian
(Soviet) backing, would have an
excellent chance to take control of
Lebanon. Obviously the Syrians
would strongly influence any go
vernment the Druze might create,
an influence that Israel has shown
it would never tolerate.
Peace in Lebanon is attainable
only if U.S. forces continue to
exert a stabilizing influence in that
Middle Eastern tinderbox, exacting
negotiation instead of fighting. A
premature withdrawal could lead
to an international crisis for which
the United States would find itself
responsible.

be resolved. One group will have
won and the other will have lost,
case closed. Vet, will it be closed? I
doubt there is anyone on campus,
who feels that the losing
party will just go away. No,
following the decision there will be
charges raised against the decision
makers, regardless of who they
are, that they lacked legitimacy and
the losing group will vow to con
tinue the fight.
Is there an alternative? Yes, I
believe that a win/win resolution is
possible. No, I don't know what it

ford who does. I think the answer
lies somewhere in the minds of all
those concerned with the issue. It
will only be drawn out in a con
sensus decision-making process
which involves the entire commu
nity and has as its goal satisfying all

parties concerns.

Keep U.S. in Lebanon
The scenario of civil war in
Lebanon, although subdued since
Sept. 26 as a result of a precarious
cease-fire agreement, presents a
frustrating crisis to U.S. policy
makers — frustrating because the
situation is so volatile and their
options are so limited: They have
no choice but to keep U.S. forces
in Lebanon.
Though today a cease-fire
dominates the scene in Lebanon,
minor skirmishes arise almost daily
between all factions involved in the
civil war, displaying the subdued
but very real tension in the
country. The stabilizing role of
U.S. forces now stationed in
Lebanon certainly has not ended,
nor will it end in the very near
future. Here's why:
The U.S. military presence in
Lebanon is certainly partially re
sponsible for the cease-fire existing
today. In face of the U.S. show of
force the Syrian-backed Druze
realized that they would not be
allowed to forcibly gain control
over Lebanon — at least not as long
as U.S. peacekeeping forces
remained there.
If U.S. forces were to withdraw,
however, the Druze militia, with
the help of their hefty Syrian
(Soviet) backing, would have an
excellent chance to take control of
Lebanon. Obviously the Syrians
would strongly influence any go
vernment the Druze might create,
an influence that Israel has shown
it would never tolerate.
Peace in Lebanon is attainable
only if U.S. forces continue to
exert a stabilizing influence in that
Middle Eastern tinderbox, exacting
negotiation instead of fighting. A
premature withdrawal could lead
to an international crisis for which
the United States would find itself
responsible.

Parking stickers
I picked up today's Stanford
Daily (Oct. 4) and noticed an ar
ticle titled "Campus Bus Line to
Expand." As I began to read it, I
had to check the date again to
make sure this wasn't the April
Fool's issue.
Our beloved Committee on
Parking and Transportation, not
content with its previous idiocies,
is climbing to new heights. Not
only do they plan to continue
pouring our parking money down
a hole (the infamous Marguerite
shuttle "service"), they plan to
expand it!. They're going to ad
vertise it! And they speak of these
plans without a hint of shame!
The head of the Committee on
Parking and Transportation is
Mason Yearian. Quickly checking
my faculty/staff directory, I find his
home is on Cottrell Way, in Stan
ford, California.
Guess what? He lives right here
at Stanford! He doesn't need to
buy a parking sticker! He can walk
around campus. But is that good
enough for him? Not at all! He
wants me to pay for his shuttle
bus.
Mason and his fellow committee
members are having a great time at
my expense. I live in Palo Alto in
easy bicycling distance, but there
are times (rainy days, meetings,
errands, etc.) when I need to park
on campus near where I work. So
I'm stuck with buying a $100 hun
ting license.
This year I bought one of those
nifty "floating" stickers so I can
drive either of my cars to work.
The thing will probably be stolen
before the year is out and I'll have
the privilege of forking over again
to replace it.
I can't conceive of any shuttle
service on this campus being use
ful to me or any other off-campus
commuter. The able-bodied don't
need it, and the disabled need
something better. No place on
campus, except perhaps Escondido
Village, is more than a 10-minute
walk from my office. For rainy days
I have an umbrella. For trips to the
Stanford Shopping Center I drive

or take my bike.
Why should I ever want to wait
for a bus? Does the committee
think it can eventually jack up the
parking sticker fees so high that I
won't buy one? In that case I'll
gladly pay parking fines to Santa
Clara County and Stanford will
never see the money. I'll keep on
driving when necessary.

No win situation?
For nearly a year now I have
watched the progress of the
Hoover debate, which has now
turned into the Reagan complex
debate. In that time there has been
no movement towards reconcilia
tion of the parties involved, and in
fact, many disinterested observers
would say the situation has
deteriorated.
I would hope the situation can
be reversed. Should present trends
continue, the University, the Board
of Trustees and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy are faced
with at best a win/lose decision
and at worst a lose/lose situation.
Should a decision be rendered
one would assume the situation to
be resolved. One group will have
won and the other will have lost,
case closed. Vet, will it be closed? I
doubt there is anyone on campus,
