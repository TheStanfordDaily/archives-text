# A
						journey to Central America

Item: Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
began a week-long tour through Central America yes
terday in his effort to design a long-term policy back
drop for the Reagan administration's battles in Central
America. His commission will spend one day in each
nation and will finish the tour in Nicaragua Saturday.
Official itinerary for the Kissinger Commission on
Central America, by Dr. H. Kissinger, Master Diplomat
and Power-Wielder.
Day 1: Panama. Find out why Communists haven't
tried to subvert Panama as they have all the other
countries around here. Ask if they mind living in such a
long, skinny country such as theirs. Discuss whether
perhaps El Salvador could be made longer and skinnier
to prevent Communist insurgency.
Visit the American canal in Panama.
Day 2: Costa Rica. Ask them why there is no com
munism here, either. Is it perhaps because they are so
close to Panama, which is so long and skinny?
Praise them for not having a standing army in this
region which is so turbulent and unstable. Ask if they
wouldn't mind having just a small army with which to
fight the Nicaraguans just a little, hm? We have plenty
of guns and bombs which we would be more than hap
py to donate.
Visit Eden Pastora, former leftist terrorist and current
democratic freedom fighter, now based in Costa Rica.
Congratulate him on maintaining a position indepen
dent from either superpower which will lead to a truly
free, non-aligned Nicaragua. Ask him if he'd like a tew
more CIA planes. Suggest that he change his code
name from Commander Zero to something a little flash
ier, like Cap'n Democracy. And maybe he could wear
a cape.
Day 3: Guatemala. At last! Communist subversion.
Soak in the atmosphere of it for a while. Then visit the
Imperial Palace, site of the latest coup. Find out that
Gen. Rios Montt really wasn't getting a bum rap after
all. Declare that it is now Gen. Vitores, the new presi
dent, who is getting a bum rap.
Check out the government's "rifles and beans" pro
gram, where in order to eat, peasants have to move to
government relocation centers and serve in militias. A
good way to combat communist subversion. But tell
them not to call them "strategic hamlets, just like in
Vietnam." The site of my greatest diplomatic triumph is
for some reason a no-no word, says Mr. President.

Next the government will show us a communist In
dian. Watch for signs of starvation — Communists often
induce anorexia nervosa in order to gain sympathy
from the liberal press.
Visit a village that has been massacred by the govern
ment. Marvel at how every man, woman and child was
a communist. What subversion!
Day 4: tl Salvador. Here you really aren't supposed
to mention El Salvador.
Visit Col. D'Aubuisson, head of the constituent as
sembly — or "Major Blowtorch" as he's known to his
friends. We were also supposed to meet the head of a
death squad today, but as D'Aubuisson was also the
head of a death squad we can kill two birds with one
stone — if you'll excuse the expression. He will explain
that the death squads are merely community action
groups, similar to our YMC.A.
Meet with a Christian Democrat to disruss El Sal
vador's progress toward peaceful, democratic reform.
I believe there are at least six Christian Democrats still
in El Salvador.
Talk to a Communist. Ask him why he is subverting
this country.
Day 5: Honduras. Forget Honduras. Where is Belize; 1
I know it's in Central America, I saw it on the map. Is it
being subverted by Communists? Perhaps it has already
been subverted! Do they have death squads there? It
not, why not?
Day 6: Nicaragua. We already know what we will find
in Nicaragua: a Communist dictatorship murdering its
people and subverting the region. So instead we will
pay a visit to our friend in khaki, Mr. Castro, and tell
him exactly what we think of his devilish plot to de
stabilize our hemisphere. Fat chance, buddy! Not when
you've got a master diplomat wise to you — you and all
your communist subversions!
(Note: We were going to take a trip to the real source
of all this communism, the Soviet Union, but for some
reason no flights are available.)
Day 7: Washington. We make our recommendations
to President Re gan. Perhaps, for starters, 100,000
troops in :: l Salv. or, c<. pet bombing of Nicaragua,
and an invasion ot Belize. We may have to destroy the
region to ive it
