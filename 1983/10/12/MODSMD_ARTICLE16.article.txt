## Campus trash needs a home 
### 
What we have here is a dirty
campus. Pop cans, sushi jars, Mac-
Donalds wrappers, junk. We are un
usually blessed with portions of the
detritus of civilization that have not
found their proper receptacle â€” and
why? I do not believe it is because
the Stanford community is espe
cially slovenly (nay, I will not!);
rather, I think there is a lack of
proper receptacles.
Take a leisurely stroll down

Campus Drive or even (pride of our
town) Palm Drive sometime and
look for garbage. You will find it.
You will find a lot of it. What you will
not find is a garbage can. Even a
freshman cannot be faulted for
hiding his empty caffeine-free 7-Up
can behind a picturesque palm if
there is no trash bin within half a
mile.
"Watcha doin' withat there Coke,
Jim-Bob? Ya gonna drink it?"
"Nope, already done that. Gonna
just carry it with me 20 minutes or so
til I find me a trash can. Taint right to
litter, y'know."
Where there are people, there is
garbage. This association is the true
sign of intelligence. Does it produce
garbage? If yes, then it is self-aware.
Long ago Mother Nature tired of the
dinosaurs. She said to herself, "Now
I have tried big; let me try some
thingnew,like Garbage-Producing."

Those who run this University do
not seem to realize this.
It was especially noticeable at
registration. Not a can to be found!
And yet there were people there,
presumably with the beneficent nod
of the shaggy bureaucratic head,
passing out Reg Packs and fliers and
bills of all types. Surely they knew
that eventually all this disseminated
information would become just so
much garbage, blown in the wind.
Yes? No?
The short point of this long
speech is that we need a more
liberal sprinkling of garbage cans on
this campus. Like it or not, people
will be walking along Palm, or
Campus, or You-Name-lt, and they
will be ejecting garbage: It is a natu
ral process. It would be oh-so-nice it
we had garbage containers to con
tain their garbage. Please?
