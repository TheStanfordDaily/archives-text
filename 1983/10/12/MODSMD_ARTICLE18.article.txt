# TOWARD YOUR HEALTH: JACK MARTIN
## Fit or fat? Assessing your physical fitness 
### 
A health column written by
lack Martin will appear each
Wednesday. Martin is a doc
toral student in the School of
Education working on an indi
vidually designed doctorate in
health education. Martin is the
originator of the "Optimal
Health and Fitness" course of
fered here each spring.
Are you fit or fat? The an
swer may be more complex
than you think. Physical fit
ness is a multi-dimensional
concept, which includes car
diovascular endurance, speed
and agility, muscular strength
and endurance, and flexibility.
Each of these concepts can be
assessed in a precise, scien
tific way in an exercise physi
ology laboratory. There are
also, however, good tests
which you can perform your
self which will give you a fairly
accurate indication of your
overall fitness.

A good test for cardiovas
cular endurance was devised
by Dr. Kenneth Cpoper, the
author of "Aerobics" and one
of the originators of the con
tinuing fitness fad.
Cooper's test involves run
ning for 12 minutes and mea
suring the distance run. For a
male 18-30 years old an
average score would be 1 1 /2
miles, a good score would be
1 3 /4 miles, with anything over 2
miles as excellent. For a
female of the same age, com
parable figures would be 10
percent less.
Speed is defined as move
ment in a single direction. The
40-yard dash is the most com
mon test of speed. Here a
score of 5Vz seconds for men
and 6 seconds for women is
average for those of college
age, with 5 seconds for men
and 5Ms seconds for women
regarded as very good. If you
are under 4 1 /2 seconds you

should report to the track
team at once!
Agility is movement in more
than one direction as, for ex
ample, when a running back
in football starts in one direc
tion and then cuts to another.
One test of agility involves
shuffling back and forth be
tween two lines posted 14 feet
apart. If you can cross an im
aginary center line 20 times
within 30 seconds, you have
good agility. A score of 18
would be average and 22
would be excellent.
Muscular strength involves
the ability to lift a mass of
weight in a single try. A stan
dard test of muscular strength
is a bench press exercise. The
bench press station is one of
exercise stations on the Uni
versal exercise machine in the
Encina Weight Room or the
Roble facility. The basic idea is
to lie with your back on the
bench and find the highest

total weight that you can lift.
Men should be able to press
100 percent of their body
weight and women should be
able to lift 70 percent. In doing
this test it is a good idea to
start with a light weight and
work your way up, rather than
trying to lift as much as possi
ble on the first attempt.
A good test for muscle en
durance is push-ups done for
one minute. Men should do
them in the standard way,
while women should do them
from their knees. An object,
such as a tennis ball or a shoe
should be placed on the
ground directly below the
chest. You should touch the
object on each effort. A score
of 30 would be about average,
with 50 as good and 60 or
more as excellent. You will
find that one minute is a long
time when doing push-ups!
Flexibility is defined as
"motion around a joint" and

since each joint has its own
degree of flexibility, no one
test can give a true measure of
this concept. However, the sit
and-reach test developed by
the YMCA and measuring the
flexibility of the hamstring
muscle (the major muscle in
the back of the leg) and the
lower back, is perhaps the
most important test of
flexibility and the results cor
relate well with flexibility in
other body joints. For this test
you should sit on the floor or
ground with your knees
straight and your legs spread
about six inches apart. Now
with both hands together, you
should bend forward as far as
you can, being sure to keep
your knees locked. For a male,
reaching the toes is about
average, extending 3-4 inches
beyond is good, and extend
ing the entire hands beyond is
excellent. Women are typi
cally more flexible than men
and thus corresponding
scores for women should be
extended by 3-4 inches.
A good overall measure of
physical fitness is body fat
composition, that is, the per
cent of your total body weight
which is in the form of fat as
opposed to lean body mass.
By contrast, your total body
weight as measured on a scale
may not tell much about your
fitness level. If two people are
the same height but one is 10
pounds heavier, the heavier
person may carry that weight
as muscle or as fat. The

heavier character could well
be more fit than the lighter
one.

A good overall
measure of physical
fitness is body fat
composition, that is,
the percent of your
total body weight
which is in the form
of fat as opposed to
lean body mass.

The most accurate way to
measure body fat is by hydros
tatic weighing. This method
involves immersion in water
and is done on campus at the
Heart Disease Prevention Pro
gram center on Welch Road.
Perhaps the simplest body fat
test is to pinch yourself on
your side just above the hip
bone. If the thickness of the
fat there is the size of your
baby finger, you probably
have a fairly low body tat
percentage. If it is the thick
ness of your index finger, you
are about average. If it is the
thickness of your thumb, you
are too fat! In percentage
terms a college male is, on
average, about 15 percent fat,
with 10 percent being a very
good figure. Since women
are, on the average, fatter than

men, corresponding figures
are 23 percent for average wo
men and 18 percent for good.
Scores much below 18 percent
in women may result in dis
ruption of the menstrual
cycle. Typically endurance
athletes — such as runners and
cross-country skiers - have very
low body fat percentages.
In my experience at Stan
ford the lowest score for a stu
dent was around 2 percent,
achieved by James Lofton who
now plays professional foot
ball for the Green Bay Packers.
One word of caution if you are
about to try these tests — be
sure to warm-up and stretch
properly before doing them —
particularly those involving
running or weight lifting.
If you would like to get a
more scientific estimate of
your fitness, the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center has a fit
ness trailer which is currently
in the courtyard of the Wilbur
dorm complex. Individuals en
ter the trailer at one end, take
a series of tests as they
proceed, and get a com
puterized analyses of their
results before they leave. It is
a informative and fun way to
discover your own personal
fitness level.
Access to the trailer is free
to all Stanford students. Co
over to the trailer or call
Cowell to find out what the
open hours this quarter.
Learning how fit you are can
be both enjoyable and educa
tional. Try it!

average for those of college
age, with 5 seconds for men
and 5Ms seconds for women
regarded as very good. If you
are under 4 1 /2 seconds you

should report to the track
team at once!
Agility is movement in more
than one direction as, for ex
ample, when a running back
in football starts in one direc
tion and then cuts to another.
One test of agility involves
shuffling back and forth be
tween two lines posted 14 feet
apart. If you can cross an im
aginary center line 20 times
within 30 seconds, you have
good agility. A score of 18
would be average and 22
would be excellent.
Muscular strength involves
the ability to lift a mass of
weight in a single try. A stan
dard test of muscular strength
is a bench press exercise. The
bench press station is one of
exercise stations on the Uni
versal exercise machine in the
Encina Weight Room or the
Roble facility. The basic idea is
to lie with your back on the
bench and find the highest

total weight that you can lift.
Men should be able to press
100 percent of their body
weight and women should be
able to lift 70 percent. In doing
this test it is a good idea to
start with a light weight and
work your way up, rather than
trying to lift as much as possi
ble on the first attempt.
A good test for muscle en
durance is push-ups done for
one minute. Men should do
them in the standard way,
while women should do them
from their knees. An object,
such as a tennis ball or a shoe
should be placed on the
ground directly below the
chest. You should touch the
object on each effort. A score
of 30 would be about average,
with 50 as good and 60 or
more as excellent. You will
find that one minute is a long
time when doing push-ups!
Flexibility is defined as
"motion around a joint" and

since each joint has its own
degree of flexibility, no one
test can give a true measure of
this concept. However, the sit
and-reach test developed by
the YMCA and measuring the
flexibility of the hamstring
muscle (the major muscle in
the back of the leg) and the
lower back, is perhaps the
most important test of
flexibility and the results cor
relate well with flexibility in
other body joints. For this test
you should sit on the floor or
ground with your knees
straight and your legs spread
about six inches apart. Now
with both hands together, you
should bend forward as far as
you can, being sure to keep
your knees locked. For a male,
reaching the toes is about
average, extending 3-4 inches
beyond is good, and extend
ing the entire hands beyond is
excellent. Women are typi
cally more flexible than men
and thus corresponding
scores for women should be
extended by 3-4 inches.
A good overall measure of
physical fitness is body fat
composition, that is, the per
cent of your total body weight
which is in the form of fat as
opposed to lean body mass.
By contrast, your total body
weight as measured on a scale
may not tell much about your
fitness level. If two people are
the same height but one is 10
pounds heavier, the heavier
person may carry that weight
as muscle or as fat. The

heavier character could well
be more fit than the lighter
one.

A good overall
measure of physical
fitness is body fat
composition, that is,
the percent of your
total body weight
which is in the form
of fat as opposed to
lean body mass.

The most accurate way to
measure body fat is by hydros
tatic weighing. This method
involves immersion in water
and is done on campus at the
Heart Disease Prevention Pro
gram center on Welch Road.
Perhaps the simplest body fat
test is to pinch yourself on
your side just above the hip
bone. If the thickness of the
fat there is the size of your
baby finger, you probably
have a fairly low body tat
percentage. If it is the thick
ness of your index finger, you
are about average. If it is the
thickness of your thumb, you
are too fat! In percentage
terms a college male is, on
average, about 15 percent fat,
with 10 percent being a very
good figure. Since women
are, on the average, fatter than

men, corresponding figures
are 23 percent for average wo
men and 18 percent for good.
Scores much below 18 percent
in women may result in dis
ruption of the menstrual
cycle. Typically endurance
athletes — such as runners and
cross-country skiers - have very
low body fat percentages.
In my experience at Stan
ford the lowest score for a stu
dent was around 2 percent,
achieved by James Lofton who
now plays professional foot
ball for the Green Bay Packers.
One word of caution if you are
about to try these tests — be
sure to warm-up and stretch
properly before doing them —
particularly those involving
running or weight lifting.
If you would like to get a
more scientific estimate of
your fitness, the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center has a fit
ness trailer which is currently
in the courtyard of the Wilbur
dorm complex. Individuals en
ter the trailer at one end, take
a series of tests as they
proceed, and get a com
puterized analyses of their
results before they leave. It is
a informative and fun way to
discover your own personal
fitness level.
Access to the trailer is free
to all Stanford students. Co

Are you fit or fat? The an
swer may be more complex
than you think. Physical fit
ness is a multi-dimensional
concept, which includes car
diovascular endurance, speed
and agility, muscular strength
and endurance, and flexibility.
Each of these concepts can be
assessed in a precise, scien
tific way in an exercise physi
ology laboratory. There are
also, however, good tests
which you can perform your
self which will give you a fairly
accurate indication of your
overall fitness.

A good test for cardiovas
cular endurance was devised
by Dr. Kenneth Cpoper, the
author of "Aerobics" and one
of the originators of the con
tinuing fitness fad.
Cooper's test involves run
ning for 12 minutes and mea
suring the distance run. For a
male 18-30 years old an
average score would be 1 1 /2
miles, a good score would be
1 3 /4 miles, with anything over 2
miles as excellent. For a
female of the same age, com
parable figures would be 10
percent less.
Speed is defined as move
ment in a single direction. The
40-yard dash is the most com
mon test of speed. Here a
score of 5Vz seconds for men
