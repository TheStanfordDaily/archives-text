# Panel says museum has little value
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
A faculty committee has issued to
University President Donald Ken
nedy a report skeptical of plans to
house a Reagan presidential library
complex here, questioning the aca
demic value of the proposal and ur
ging the University to go slowly in
considering it.
While the proposed library "could
become a valuable academic
resource," the museum would have
"little or no academic value" and
the tenter tor public affairs should
be "better integrated into Stanford's
process of academic governance,"
the report said.
Recommending that the Univer
sity defer final decisions on the li
brary complex until after the 1984
presidential election or until Reagan
announces that he does not intend
to run, the report warned that a
decision now "may well be viewed
by many persons here and else
where as a political action no matter
what the choice."
"There is no compelling reason

for haste in carrying out discussions
that could bring the presidential li
brary to Stanford," the report said,
and "no final decisions should be
reached" without the advice of the
Faculty Senate.
The report was made public yes
terday after Kennedy discussed its
contents with the Board of Trustees
at a closed meeting.
The group, composed of nine fac
ulty members and headed by Eco
nomics Prof. James Rosse, gave Ken
nedy the report last week after two
months of discussion and hearings
during which more than 200 of Stan
ford's 1200 faculty submitted written
opinions on it.
Kennedy praised the group for a
"thorough" job, but had no further
comment on the recommendations.
Because Kennedy requested the
report, it is likely to be far more in
fluential than the report issued Sept.
30 by an in-house Hoover Institution
committee appointed by Director
W. Glenn Campbell. That commit
tee, headed by Martin Anderson, a
senior fellow and former assistant to
Reagan, stated that the proposed
complex "represents an immensely
valuable academic resource to the
entire Stanford community."
The Rosse committee "did not
reach unanimity in all matters," but
each of its recommendations was
supported by a majority and in some
cases a consensus, the report said.
Seven of the nine advisory-group

members submitted dissenting
opinions to some of the group's
recommendations.
The most substantive criticism
from the group was directed at plans
for a Reagan center for public af
fairs, which under the current
Hoover Instititution proposal would
be run by Hoover and would consist
of a major conference center and
visiting fellows program.
That proposal could "significantly
change the role of Hoover within
Stanford," the Rosse committee
noted.
It "runs the risk of creating an is
land of public policy research within
Stanford carried out chiefly by visit
ing scholars that neither contributes
to other programs of research nor
mobilizes those programs for the
benefit of the center," it said.
The committee recommended in
stead that the governing committee
of the center be appointed by the
University provost "with substantial
Stanford faculty membership." But
it stopped short of saying explicitly
that the center not be under the aus
pices of Hoover.
Other members of the committee
included Communication Prof. Elie
Abel; History Prof. Barton
Bernstein; History Prof. Carl
Degler; Hoover Archivist Charles
Palm; Political Science Prof. Alexan
der George; Prof. James March,
