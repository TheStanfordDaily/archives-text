## Women spikers claw Bears in the season's first home game 
### TOM MOORE 
Consistently frustrating the
UC-Berkeley attack with su
perb defensive blocking, the
No. 3 ranked Stanford wo
men's volleyball team
demolished the Bears last
night in the Cardinal's home
opener.
The Cardinal spikers were
never seriously threatened in
the match, rolling to a 15-6,15-
8, 15-10 decision. The victory
was Stanford's ninth a row and
upped its season record to 9-2.
"We played really well
defensively tonight," said as
sistant coach Don Shaw after
the match. "Our blocking was
very organized."
Senior Julie Baker turned in
an outstanding defensive per
formance with 18 "digs" or de
fensive saves. She also con
tributed five blistering kills to
the Stanford offensive attack.
"Julie is playing well," Shaw
noted. "She had a good match

against San Diego State (last
Saturday night) and she had
another good effort tonight."
Before a vocal crowd, Stan
ford spotted the Bears a 4-1
first-game lead, but stormed
back to run off nine straight
points and went on to win the
game easily 15-6.
In the second game, the
lead changed hands in the ear
ly going before the Cardinal
took command at 12-8. Three
quick points later, the spikers
had an insurmountable 2-0 ad
vantage.
Though the Bears started to
turn the tide in the last game,
it was a case of too little, too
late. Behind 10-8, Stanford
excited the home fans by
reeling off seven unanswered
points to clinch the match.
"This was one of our most
consistent matches of the
season," Shaw said. There
weren't a whole lot of errors."
Kim Oden and Deidra

Dvorak led the Card offensive
attack with 11 and six kills,
respectively. Oden also had
nine blocks while Lisa Murphy
contributed four.
Cal senior middle blocker
Sylvie Monnet lived up to her
All-America expectations by
leading the Bears with seven
kills in the losing effort.
The Cardinal forced the Cal
spikers out of position with its
ball control offense. "Our
good transition game didn't al
low them time to set up their
defense," Shaw said.
Stanford had no such trou
ble dealing with the Cal of
fense, as it was able to set up
an effective blocking scheme.
Stanford's next home match
is against Cal-State Fullerton
Friday at 7:30 p.m. On Sun
day, the Card takes on USC in
Maples Pavilion at 3:00 p.m.
The Trojans, like Stanford, are
undefeated in WCAA play and
are ranked fourth nationally.
