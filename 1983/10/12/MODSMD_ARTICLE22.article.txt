## Runner Plumer plummets into hole, but shoots for stars 
### BETH KLEID 
PattiSue Plumer has suf
fered her share ot ups and
downs.
Last Saturday the senior
cross country phenom fell
into a hole and twisted her
ankle as she crossed the
finish line of a race in the
Stanford College Invitation
al, hut this did not daunt
Plumer. The Olympic hope
ful said that she should be
running again in two
weeks.
And once she does
resume training, Plumer
aims to achieve two major
goals: She wants the Stan
ford cross country team to
win the national champion
ships this season, and she
wants to secure a spot on
the United States Olympic
team.
For Plumer, the Olympic
team is not an unrealistic
fantasy. In fact, it is within
her reach. "There are three
persons per spot on the
team, and only one person
is ahead of me now and
that is Mary Decker," said
Plumer."Making the Olym
pic team is not going to be
easy, but it is feasible
enough to be worth spend
ing my time, energy and
hopes on."
She continued, "Now the
Olympics are a guiding
force in my life. The trials
are in June only eight
months away. All of my
short term goals are geared
toward that."
Plumer has not always
been recognized as an
outstanding runner. She
received honors for run
ning at Montrose High
School in Montrose,
Colorado, but "no really
major awards." Even during
her freshman year on the
Farm, Plumer did not stand

out among her teammates.
But suddenly something
clicked.
"I can almost give the ex
act date that I changed my
attitude towards running,"
she said. "I realized that I
should either get good or
quit. I knew that I could do
it, but I really surprised
myself when it actually
started happening."
Plumer surprised many
people, including Coach
Brooks Johnson, when her
new positive mental atti
tude affected her perfor
mance. "I saw what I could
do, and I began to do it.
During my sophomore year
running became my tocus,
and I trained more serious
ly. I put it first on my list,
ahead of academics and
socializing."
The senior has very defi
nite ideas about the way
the mind affects athletics.
She said that most people
underestimate themselves.
"People don't think that
they can do as much as they
can do — especially women.
People can do more once
they realize their poten
tials."
Plumer credits lohnson
with helping her to realize
her own capabilities.
"Johnson is the best coach
in the world for me. hie in
stilled confidence in me,
and made me start shooting
for things."
She is also pleased with
the cross country team
here. Plumer said that she
feels the team is "pretty
darn close to perfect."
"There are times when
tensions arise on the team,
but that is the exception
and not the rule. There is
no team as cohesive as ours
that is ranked on a national
level."

Plumer started her run
ning career in the fourth
grade. She found encour
agement trom her father,
but her mother did not ad
voiate her running It was
before women started run
ning, and it (list wasn't the
feminine thing to do."
Nevertheless, Plumer
continued with the sport.
Plumer remembers her
sophomore vear on the
Farm as the most rewarding
in regard to her running
career. "I saw that I was
able to compete on a na
tional and an international
level," she said.
Not only was Plumer able
to compete on a national
level, but she was able to
score at national competi
tions—every time. Atter her
treshman year, she was the
only person on the team
who consistently scored at
national competitions and
held a collegiate record.
But Plumer did not get
much attention, and it hurt.
"I started questioning
myself. 'Who doesn't like
me?' I would ask myself. I
felt slighted," she said.
"But now I realize that be
cause I didn't get that much
recognition in the past,
when I did get it I wasn't
that affected.
"I think that not receiv
ing the fame caused me to
run for the right reasons —
not fame and glory— but for
myself and my teammates. I
don't think that fame is a
goal for me. It isn't an end
in itself, but it may open a
lot of doors in the future."
With a rigorous workout
schedule, consisting of
weight training, swimming
and at least tour hours a
day of team practice five
days a week, Plumer has
been forced to learn to

budget her time. The earth
resources major places
great importance on
academics, and she said
that she wishes she could
devote more time to her
studies.
Whiir im!. < Farm,!'lumer
has also learned to cope
with pressure. "I have dealt
with pressure by getting
used to it," she said. "Last
year it affected me more
because the spotlight was
on me. You just have to
take deep breaths,"she
said.
The senior said that run
ning has enriched her life.
She noted travel and
meeting top athletes from
all over the world as
benefits of her running
career. "I also have gained
more confidence as a result
of running. I think that I
can do anything I want to
once I set my mind to it.
"But in certain respects
running has made me more
shy. My social confidence
has decreased because I
spend my free time study
ing, and not out meeting
people. That is one regret I
have about running."
Plumer also regrets that
running has "specialized"
her life. She misses having
the extra-curricular activi
ties, such as acting and
playing the guitar, that she
enjoyed before she ded
icated herself to running.
Plumer said that she
hopes that the story 01 her
own running career will
help motivate others, espe
cially women. "I want
people to say, 'Look at that
girl — in high school she
couldn't do beans-but look
at her now.' "

her life. She misses having
the extra-curricular activi
ties, such as acting and
playing the guitar, that she
enjoyed before she ded
icated herself to running.
Plumer said that she
hopes that the story 01 her
own running career will
help motivate others, espe
cially women. "I want
people to say, 'Look at that

couldn't do beans-but look
at her now.' "

PattiSue Plumer has suf
fered her share ot ups and
downs.
Last Saturday the senior
cross country phenom fell
into a hole and twisted her
ankle as she crossed the
finish line of a race in the
Stanford College Invitation
al, hut this did not daunt
Plumer. The Olympic hope
ful said that she should be
running again in two
weeks.
And once she does
resume training, Plumer
aims to achieve two major
goals: She wants the Stan
ford cross country team to
win the national champion
ships this season, and she
wants to secure a spot on
the United States Olympic
team.
For Plumer, the Olympic
team is not an unrealistic
fantasy. In fact, it is within
her reach. "There are three
persons per spot on the
team, and only one person
is ahead of me now and
that is Mary Decker," said
Plumer."Making the Olym
pic team is not going to be
easy, but it is feasible
enough to be worth spend
ing my time, energy and
hopes on."
She continued, "Now the
Olympics are a guiding
force in my life. The trials
are in June only eight
months away. All of my
short term goals are geared
toward that."
Plumer has not always
been recognized as an
outstanding runner. She
received honors for run
ning at Montrose High
School in Montrose,
Colorado, but "no really
major awards." Even during
her freshman year on the
Farm, Plumer did not stand

out among her teammates.
But suddenly something
clicked.
"I can almost give the ex
act date that I changed my
attitude towards running,"
she said. "I realized that I
should either get good or
quit. I knew that I could do
it, but I really surprised
myself when it actually
started happening."
Plumer surprised many
people, including Coach
Brooks Johnson, when her
new positive mental atti
tude affected her perfor
mance. "I saw what I could
do, and I began to do it.
During my sophomore year
running became my tocus,
and I trained more serious
ly. I put it first on my list,
ahead of academics and
socializing."
The senior has very defi
nite ideas about the way
the mind affects athletics.
She said that most people
underestimate themselves.
"People don't think that
they can do as much as they
can do — especially women.
People can do more once
they realize their poten
tials."
Plumer credits lohnson
with helping her to realize
her own capabilities.
"Johnson is the best coach
in the world for me. hie in
stilled confidence in me,
and made me start shooting
for things."
She is also pleased with
the cross country team
here. Plumer said that she
feels the team is "pretty
darn close to perfect."
"There are times when
tensions arise on the team,
but that is the exception
and not the rule. There is
no team as cohesive as ours
that is ranked on a national
level."

Plumer started her run
ning career in the fourth
grade. She found encour
agement trom her father,
but her mother did not ad
voiate her running It was
before women started run
ning, and it (list wasn't the
feminine thing to do."
Nevertheless, Plumer
continued with the sport.
Plumer remembers her
sophomore vear on the
Farm as the most rewarding
in regard to her running
career. "I saw that I was
able to compete on a na
tional and an international
level," she said.
Not only was Plumer able
to compete on a national
level, but she was able to
score at national competi
tions—every time. Atter her
treshman year, she was the
only person on the team
who consistently scored at
national competitions and
held a collegiate record.
But Plumer did not get
much attention, and it hurt.
"I started questioning
myself. 'Who doesn't like
me?' I would ask myself. I
felt slighted," she said.
"But now I realize that be
cause I didn't get that much
recognition in the past,
when I did get it I wasn't
that affected.
"I think that not receiv
ing the fame caused me to
run for the right reasons —
not fame and glory— but for
myself and my teammates. I
don't think that fame is a
goal for me. It isn't an end
in itself, but it may open a
lot of doors in the future."
With a rigorous workout
schedule, consisting of
weight training, swimming
and at least tour hours a
day of team practice five
days a week, Plumer has
been forced to learn to

budget her time. The earth
resources major places
great importance on
academics, and she said
that she wishes she could
devote more time to her
studies.
Whiir im!. < Farm,!'lumer
has also learned to cope
with pressure. "I have dealt
with pressure by getting
used to it," she said. "Last
year it affected me more
because the spotlight was
on me. You just have to
take deep breaths,"she
said.
The senior said that run
ning has enriched her life.
She noted travel and
meeting top athletes from
all over the world as
benefits of her running
career. "I also have gained
more confidence as a result
of running. I think that I
can do anything I want to
once I set my mind to it.
"But in certain respects
running has made me more
shy. My social confidence
has decreased because I
spend my free time study
ing, and not out meeting
people. That is one regret I
have about running."
Plumer also regrets that
running has "specialized"
her life. She misses having
the extra-curricular activi
ties, such as acting and
playing the guitar, that she
enjoyed before she ded
icated herself to running.
