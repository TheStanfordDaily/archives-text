# Athletics and academics together accent Farm's status
## 
### TRASK LEONARD 
It isn't easy tackling a me
chanical engineering major
during the week and a tailback
on Saturdays. At many
schools, athletes aren't asked
to take on this challenge. But
at Stanford, it's an expecta
tion. And it's this expectation
which, tor better or for worse,
shapes other schools' image
of the Cardinal.
Outside of the Stanford
community comes the
greatest exhibition, and the
most resentment, of the
school's prestige. Some Pac-10
schools view Cardinal athletes
as arrogant.
"Stanford, unfortunately,
has developed a poor image
among other schools as being
distinctly different. But we'd

like no special treatment. On
the football field it doesn't
matter what your SATs are.
And it hurts just as badly to
lose," said Sports Information
Director Steve Rac/ynski.
Athletic directors of other
Pac-10 schools perceive Stan
ford in a positive way.
"Stanford has an outstanding
blend of academics and ath
letics which makes it quite
unique in the nation, and is
viewed so in the Pac-10," said
Rick Bay, University of Oregon
athletic director.
The assistant director of
sports information at the Uni
versity of Washington, Mike
Wilson, said that he feels Stan
ford's sports program is one of
the best in the country. "Yet
we, at Washington are not in

awe of any other schools. In
fact we kind of get up for Stan
ford when we play them to
prove something to our
selves."
Since Geiger became athlet
ic director four years ago, Car
dinal athletes have catapulted
into national prominence at
tremendous rates. While great
individual performers, like the
john Elways and ]ohn
McEnroes of Stanford's past,
have always been important in
the sports program, the resur
gence of the entire depart
ment marks Stanford's pres
ent.
Last year, of the 24 varsity
teams that the University
fields, 12 went on to NCAA
post-season playoffs. Of those

12, most finished in the top six
with the worst fini her coming
in eighth place. Men's tennis
and women's swimming
finished as national cham
pions last year, and overall the
women's program was ranked
No. 1 in the country by the
Santa Monica Evening Out
look, a Los AngeU area news
paper.
"The primary purpose of
athletics is to enhance the aca
demic experience and to pro
vide entertainment," Geiger
said.
Athletics add t< a school's
respect. When the perfor
mance of varsits teams ap
proaches greatness, people sit
up and take noti< e, and they
pay to do so.
Stanford's athletic status is
big business.
Back in the 19305, '40s and
'50s, football drew crowds of
over 90,000 consistently. In
recent years, football ticket
sales and national television
coverage have grossed mil
lions of dollars. With four
televised games in 1982, the
exposure brought $1 million
directly to the Athletic Depart
ment, and will have other ef
fects, such as increased attrac
tion for recruits.
The sales of souvenirs in the
Bookstore , especially on
Saturdays, are literally
phenomenal. Bookstore
manager lames Arnold said
that 30 percent of the business
done on Saturdays relates to
Stanford shirts, sweatshirts,
caps, keychains and other
"emblazoned" items.
The alumni believe in the
importance of Stanford's
status, and they pay as well.
The Buck Club raises money
for athletes on scholarships.
Without its vigorous support
of Stanford sports, many ath
letes would not have the op
portunity to perform here,
both athletically and academi
cally.

Major sports, particularly
football, attract nationwide at
tention to the University. In
recent years, the Cardinal
football squad has gained na
tional exposure. Last year, the
team appeared on national
and regional television four
times, and upset No. 1 ranked

'Today athletics
play a positive role
in the campus
experience, and
along with a high
level of academic
excellence, provide
for a great deal of
respect for
Stanford/

Washington in the process.
In the late'7os, Sun and
Bluebonnet Bowl victories
grabbed the attention of
many. And the exciting '71 and
'72 Rose Bowl victories were
definitely memorable.

Football, combined with the
rest of the sports, has exposed
a very successful athletic pro
gram, taken without regard to
the already pronounced aca
demic status of the school.
When one does take into ac
count the nature of scholas
tics, the success of athletics

accents Stanford's high
regard.
"In the late '60s and early
70s, with the fine performance
of the Rose Bowl teams in par
ticular, Stanford football and
Stanford athletics in general,
made a great deal of differ

ence in the status of the Uni
versity as a whole. Today ath
letics play a positive role in the
campus experience, and along
with a high level of academic
excellence, provide for a great
deal of respect for Stanford,"
said Football Coach Paul Wig
gin.
One freshman said that she
feels sports here are frivolous.
"They are far from being the
most important aspect of Stan
ford life."
But the freshman's senti
ment ranks far behind the
view held by the majority of
the students â€” that sports act
only positively on the Univer
sity's image. There are con
crete examples of what this
status implies.
Another manifestation of
Stanford's prestige surfaces in
the decision of recruited ath
letes to come here. Those
qualified for acceptance gen
erally attend Stanford for the
same reason: They find the
blend of sports and studies on
the Farm irresistible.
"Stanford receives a great
deal of respect for its athletics
and academics, maybe more
than any other school
around," said freshman wide
receiver Jeff James.


The increased sales of Stanford paraphernalia al the bookstore here after Saturday football
games is one example of how sports programs on the Farm promote the status of the
University.
