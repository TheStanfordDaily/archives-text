# Game 1 belongs to Philly

Baltimore (AP) â€” Garry Maddox led off the
Philadelphia eighth inning with a home run
to break up a World Series pitching duel be
tween John Denny and Baltimore's Scott
McGregor and give the Phillies a 2-1 victory
over the Orioles in Game One last night.
The game was attended by 52,204, includ
ing President Reagan, and played at times in
a light drizzle. It matched two of the finest
pitchers in baseball but it was decided in a
battle of home runs. Baltimore's Jim Dwyer,
one of the Oriole's platoon players, belted a
first-inning homer and oldtimer Joe Morgan
tied it in the sixth for the Phillies.
Denny and McGregor, both of whom
failed to go the distance, matched three
hitters through the first six innings. In the
eighth, Maddox came to bat against
McGregor with the score tied 1-1. He drilled
the first pitch of the inning over the left-field
fence, arming Denny with the lead for the
first time. The Phillies nearly had successive
homers when Bo Diaz, the next batter, hit a
1-0 pitch that seemed destined to sail over
the fence in left field, but John Lowenstein
timed his leap perfectly and snared the ball
above and bevond the fence.

Right-hander Denny, a 19-game winner
during the regular season, retired the first
two batters in the eighth but, when Al
Bumbry doubled, the Phillies went to their
bullpen, bringing on relief ace Al Holland.
Denny had given up five hits, but held one
of baseball's most explosive lineups to a
single run. He had retired 10 in a row at one
point.
The Phillies had the luxury of Holland in
the bullpen. He had a club-record 25 saves
and an earned run average of 2.26 during the
regular season. He retired pinch-hitter Dan
Ford on a fly to left on the first pitch, ending
the Baltimore threat.
Holland, in the ninth, retired the Orioles
in order, getting Cal Ripken, Eddie Murray
and pinch hitter Gary Roenicke.
This marked the first time in six World Se
ries that the Orioles had lost the opener.
McGregor, 18-7 during the season and a
loser in the 2-1 opening game of the playoffs
against Chicago, had retired four straight
batters following Morgan's game-tying
hcmer.
