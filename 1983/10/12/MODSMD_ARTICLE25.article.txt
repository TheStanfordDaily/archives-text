Martin Lipset told a Faculty Club au
dience yesterday that Israel's recent
economic collapse may actually help
the country in the long run.
"It was a good thing the collapse
came before the next election to get
(Prime Minister Menachem) Begin's
government out," he said.
Lipset told approximately 40 staff
and faculty members that the eco
nomic collapse has brought an en
hanced awareness of the severity of
Israel's situation to both U. S. Jews
and the Reagan administration.
Lipset introduced his topic with
an overview of Israel's military, eco
nomic and national position in the
last few years.
Concerning Israel's military posi
tion in the West Bank, Lipset said
that any "effort to rearrange
Lebanon (has) clearly failed," and
that "Israel is not likely to get out of
Lebanon for some time to come."
Lipset said that the economic col
lapse and Begin's resignation mean
that the solution to Israel's prob

lems is by no means near.
"The West Bank conflict has had
drastic effects on Israel's economy,"
Lipset said. He added that Israel's in
flation rate quadrupled since the

West Bank invasion and its total
productivity, excluding U.S. and
German financial aid, has dropped
to a level equal to the Israeli govern
ment's budget.
Lipset added that "government in
tervention in labor increased to the
extent that a free market no longer
existed."
He explained, "Israel faces addi
tional problems as a nation. In the
recaptured territory, 52 percent of
the children ages zero to four and 48
percent of those ages four to 14 are
Considering the increasing
rate of Israeli Jewish emigration, it is
safe to assume that the occupied
territory will soon be largely
composed of Arabs."
Lipset summarized implications of
these three factors with the ques
tion, "How do you control the West
Bank and have peace, a Jewish State,
and a democracy?"
Lipset's speech, "The Peace
Movement and Israeli Politics," was
the first in a series of faculty-staff
luncheons sponsored by the Stan
ford Hillel.
