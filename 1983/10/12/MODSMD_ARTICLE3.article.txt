# Former Reagan adviser Anderson urges balanced budget amendment
## 
### SHIRISH DATE 
Martin Anderson, a former eco
nomic adviser to President Reagan,
proposed yesterday a balanced
budget amendment to the constitu
tion as the only long- run solution to
the nation's economic difficulties.
Speaking before an audience of
about 100 students at Branner Hall,
Anderson, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, defended the
Economic Recovery Act of 1981 — an
act Anderson played an instrumen
tal role in formulating — as a step in
the right direction. Though he ad
mitted that high unemployment
remains a problem, Anderson said
he sees signs of improvement re
garding this thorny issue.
But he warned that the recovery is
bv no means complete. "The task of
economic recovery has really only
begun; there's an awful lot more
that needs to be done."
Calling the increasing deficit the
most serious of the remaining prob
lems, Anderson blamed the political

process for the present deficit of
more than $200 billion.
The political cost of balancing the
budget is much too high for policy
makers to accept, he said. Anderson
accused members of Congress,
Republicans and Democrats alike, of
neglecting their responsibilities as
leaders and choosing, instead, the
politically expedient route.
While some lawmakers are biased
toward social programs, others are
biased toward defense spending
and still others are committed to
cutting taxes; none of them, he
said, is willing to risk alienating his
constituents by doing the economi
cally necessary thing.
"Today, in effect, a vote for fiscal
responsibility across the board is a
vote for political suicide."
As a solution to the problem of
legislative inertia, Anderson pro
posed a constituitonal amendment
requiring a balanced budget. "Any
proposed changes in the Constitu
tion should only be contemplated

when very fundamental questions
can't be dealt with in any other way.
I think that time has probably now
come."
Anderson proposed a four-point

amendment to contend with the
deficit problem. First, a balanced
budget would be required yearly.
Second, a limit would be placed on
federal spending as a percentage of
gross national product. Third, the

president would be given the power
of line-item veto when reviewing
the submitted budget. Thus the
president would be able to veto spe
cific items in the budget without
being forced to veto the budget as a
whole.
Lastly, Anderson advocated a
return to the gold standard. He
defended this position by reminding
that inflation had been rampant ever
since President Richard Nixon took
the United States off the gold stan
dard in 1971. "
