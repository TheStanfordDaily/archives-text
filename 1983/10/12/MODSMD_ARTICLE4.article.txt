# Med School Dean Purpura declares school healthy
## 
### JERRY BALL Staff writer 
Medical School Dean Dominick Purpura gave
his school a clean bill of health in a "state of the
Medical School address" in Fairchild
Auditorium last night.
Purpura said that the school is "healthy," but
that those involved with the school "must
practice a good deal of preventive medicine" to
keep it that way.
To support his contentions, Purpura noted
that last year over 75 percent of Stanford medi
cal students were involved in research and 50
percent had already published scientific papers.
Purpura also said that this year's entering
class "continues Stanford's commitment to
minority students." The class includes eight
blacks, eight Chicanos and two native
Americans, setting minority enrollment at 21
percent.
Purpura said he was pleased with the place
ment of the Medical School's graduates — 62 per
cent were placed into University medical
centers and 52 percent "matched on their first
choice" — but he expressed concern that rising
tuition may affect the careers of graduates in the
future.
The class of 1987 "will graduate with an

average indebtedness of $55,000" he said. This
level of indebtedness "is a great influence on
the kinds of career choices our students make"
and, in particular, "is a great barrier to students
interested in pursuing a career of academic
medicine."
Purpura said that the school is financially
healthy as well. Grants for "instruction activity"
in 1 98i came to $51 million, the seventh highest
for all U.S. medical schools, and money made
available for sponsored projects totaled $60 mil
lion, up from $50 million in 1982. Purpura called
the school's growth "a truly remarkable
achievement."
He said his main financial concern for the
school is that, despite growth in funds for proj
ects and instruction, funds for the operation
budget are scarce and expenditures have grown
25 percent over the last two years.
As for the academic well-being of the school's
faculty, Purpura read an impressive list of dis
tinctions won last year by Medical School fac
ulty, including the induction of Biochemistry
Prof. Ron Davis into the National Academy of
Science.
In addition, he said, 15 percent of all of the
prestigious Hartford Fellowships were awarded
to Stanford faculty last year.
