Tanaka guilty of taking bribes
Tokyo — A Japanese lower court found
former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka guilty
today of accepting more than $2 million in
bribes to promote the sale ot Lockheed
Corp. aircraft in japan, according to japanese
news reporters in the courtroom.
The Tokyo District Court ruling culminated
a seven-year trial in which lb government
and airline officials and Lockheed agents
were charged in Japan's biggest postwar
scandal.
Tanaka was accused of accpeting the 500
million yen to promote the sale of Lockheed
TriStar passenger jets in lapan when he

served as prime minister from 1972-1974.
All Nippon Airwavs, lapan's largest domes
tic airline, bought 20 of Lockheed s L-1101
wide-bodied TriStars between 1974-1978.
Sixteen high-ranking japanese government
officials and businessmen have been tried
since January 1977 in three separate trials in
the I ockheed case.
Before today's decision, 10 defendants
were convicted of graft, perjury or foreign
exchange violations. One was too ill to stand
trial.
Prosecutors in the Tokyo District Court
trial demanded the maximum sentence for
Tanaka — live years in prison and a $2 million
fine.
Political stakes in Japan were riding on the
verdict.

Tanaka resigned as premier in 1974 in the
wake of another unrelated financial scandal.

in l ( )H() and remained Japan's top political
power broker as leader of the governing
Liberal Democ iatic Party's largest faction.

elected last \ear with crucial backing from
Tanaka. Nakasone rejected opposition
demands that tie persuade Tanaka to resign.
