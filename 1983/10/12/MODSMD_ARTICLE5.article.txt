Tanaka guilty of taking bribes
Tokyo — A Japanese lower court found
former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka guilty
today of accepting more than $2 million in
bribes to promote the sale ot Lockheed
Corp. aircraft in japan, according to japanese
news reporters in the courtroom.
The Tokyo District Court ruling culminated
a seven-year trial in which lb government
and airline officials and Lockheed agents
were charged in Japan's biggest postwar
scandal.
Tanaka was accused of accpeting the 500
million yen to promote the sale of Lockheed
TriStar passenger jets in lapan when he

served as prime minister from 1972-1974.
All Nippon Airwavs, lapan's largest domes
tic airline, bought 20 of Lockheed s L-1101
wide-bodied TriStars between 1974-1978.
Sixteen high-ranking japanese government
officials and businessmen have been tried
since January 1977 in three separate trials in
the I ockheed case.
Before today's decision, 10 defendants
were convicted of graft, perjury or foreign
exchange violations. One was too ill to stand
trial.
Prosecutors in the Tokyo District Court
trial demanded the maximum sentence for
Tanaka — live years in prison and a $2 million
fine.
Political stakes in Japan were riding on the
verdict.

Tanaka resigned as premier in 1974 in the
wake of another unrelated financial scandal.
But he was re-elected to the Diet (Parliament)
in l ( )H() and remained Japan's top political
power broker as leader of the governing
Liberal Democ iatic Party's largest faction.
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was
elected last \ear with crucial backing from
Tanaka. Nakasone rejected opposition
demands that tie persuade Tanaka to resign.
Shamir devalues currency
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israel s new government
devalued the < urrencv 23 percent yesterdav
and raised the price of basic foods 50 per-
cent, setting off a stampede to buy meat, milk and
bread before the increases took effect.
The Hisfadrut, Israel's 1.5 million-member labor
federation, set a two-hour warning strike for tomor
row to protest the steadily eroding purchasing
power of working people.
Ihe devaluation of the Israeli shekel and the price
hikes were adopted at a nine-hour overnight
Cabinet meeting held just hours after Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir was sworn in by Parliament as
Menachem Begin s successor.
Motorists quickly lined up at gas stations and
shoppers flooded stores to dump devalued currency
and buy goods before prices rose.
The main purchases were basics like frozen meat,
milk, flour, bread and cooking oil, whose prices
were to go up 50 percent today as a result of a reduc
tion in government subsidies.
A quart of milk goes from 16.8 shekels to 25
shekels — orabout 31 cents. A loaf of bread rises from
6.5 shekels to 10 shekels — or about 15 cents. The
devaluation was likely to push the prices higher.
Prices of imported goods were effected by the
devaluation. Car prices were to go up by from $1875
to $6325. Autos are imported and heavily taxed. The
cheapest models cost about $10,000.
The austerity measures, prompted by a widening
trade deficit and a threatened collapse of bank
stocks, spelled the end of a period of more than two
years in which Israelis have enjoyed a rapidly rising
standard of living.
Most significant was Finance Minister Yoram
Aridor's warning that the government would depart
from the custom of automatically compensating
wage-earners for price hikes.
Court refuses to clear Alger Hiss
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday refused
to help clear the name of Alger Hiss, whose prosecu
tion 33 years ago symbolized the Cold War scare
over communist infiltration and remains, by his ac
count, "an unhealed wound in the nation's body
politic."
The justices turned away arguments aimed at
reopening Hiss' 1950 perjury conviction, which held
that he lied by denying he was a spy for the Soviet
Union.
The court also:
aLet stand the 1981 Abscam conviction of former
Rep. Richard Kelly (R-Fla.), who could be sentenced
to up to 15 years in federal prison.
aßefused to free an estimated $19.5 million in addi
tional monthly benefits to some 30,000 disabled
Americans. The court, by a 5-4 vote, blocked en

forcement of a ruling that would torce the govern
ment to pay the money while the legal controversy
continues in lower courts.
aßefused to reinstate a $1.8 billion judgement
against AT & T, the largest antitrust award in the na

the detriment of MCI Communications Corp., a
competitor.

vasion of privacy.
Power explosion blackens L.A.
Los Angeles — A power station explosion blacked out
a 2-square-mile section of the downtown business
area for up to 17 hours, idling thousands of workers
yesterday and costing companies millions of dollars
in lost production.
Hardest hit was the city's bustling garment district,
which may have lost millions of dollars in produc
tion, said Bernard Brown, chairman of the state
Coalition of Apparel Industries and vice president of
koret of California.
"Without electricity to operate our machines, our
industry's dead," Brown said.
Garment worker Ismael Perez said he lost $45 in
wages because he wasn't able to work yesterday."I
don't know what I will tell my wife and my kid," said
Perez, 26.
The power failure plunged the area into darkness
at 7:20 p.m. Monday, stopping elavators between
floors and knocking out traffic lights. It lingered in
some areas for more than 17 hours through midday
yesterday, said Barry Tuller, spokesman for the city
owned Department of Water and Power.
Workers in some offices that remained without
power yesterday hiked up stairways, huddled by
windows or candles to do their work and functioned
without electric typewriters, calculators and com
puters.
Soviets threaten to end arms talk
Washington — Soviet threats to break off talks on
limiting mid-range nuclear missiles in Europe are
"propaganda tactics" designed to undercut
European support for the planned deployment of
modernized U.S. missiles there, the Reagan admin
istration declared yesterday.
In identical statements at the White House and the
State Department, administration spokesman said
that the Soviets so far have not asked for a recess in
theCenevaarmstalks — eitherin thoseaimedat limit

ing missiles in Europe or those concerned with stra
tegic nuclear weapons.
Spokesmen Larry Speakes at the White House and
Alan Romberg at the State Department both ac -
knowledged that "threats to disrupt the Geneva
talks have consistently been part ot Soviet
propaganda tactics." But other officials, noting that
U.S. negotiator Paul Nitze recently had discussed
the possibility of such a walkoutg, conceded that a
Soviet interruption ot the talks— it agreement is not
soon reached — was possible later this year.
B\ year's end, the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion will begin deploying 108 Pershing 2 missiles in
West Germany and 4(i4 cruise missiles in West Ger
main, Britain, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands to
offset more than 350 SS-20 missiles, each with three
warheads, now deployed by the Soviet Union. Com
plete NATO deployment is not scheduled until 1985,
however.
Two years ago, Soviet leaders agreed grudgingly
to negotiate the issue, and they have publicly
rejected the main U.S. negotiating positions in
Geneva. The Americans have sought either a ban on
missiles with enough range to hit Western Europe
from Soviet territory or vice versa, or an interim
agreement to set equal ceilings for such missiles lor
both sides.
Burmese kill terrorist
Rangoon, Burma — Burmese security agents have
captured a suspected Korean terrorist and killed an
other in a development that apparently is linked to
the explosion that killed four South Korean Cabinet
ministers Sunday, authorities said yesterday.
The explosion occurred at 10:25 a.m. Sunday, just
five minutes before visiting South Korean President
Chun Doo Hwan was to arrive at the Martyrs
Mausoleum to lay a wreath at the tomb of Burma's
national hero. Gen. Aung San.
Local security officials spotted a suspicious
looking man swimming only with his head above
water in the Pazundaung Creek in East Rangoon at
about 9:30 a.m. Sunday
When the security men tried to capture him, the
man hurled a grenade at them, but it exploded in his
hands, injuring him seriously.
Two of the security men were also injured. The
suspect is now being treated in a hospital.
Authorities identified the man as a Korean, but did
not say whether he was a North Korean or a South
Korean.
The second Korean was captured Monday at a vil
lage about 10 miles west of Rangoon. Police,
responding to reports of two suspicious-looking
foreigners in the area took them into custody. On
the way to the police station, one of the suspects
exploded a grenade, wounding three policemen,
and both fled. The wounded policemen opened fire,
killing one foreigner, but the other escaped.
An official statement said that articles found on

tin 1 dead Korean were similar lo those seized Irom
the Korean captured in the East Rangoon creek Sun
day night.
"Every effort is now being made to capture the
escaped Korean," the statement said.
Foat murder trial delayed
Gretna, La. — I he murder trial of California feminist
leader Cinny Foat was put off for three weeks yester
dav by a judge who said publicity might make it diffi
i ult to choose an impartial jury.
District Judge Robert Burns, in postponing the
trial until Nov. 7, also cited the defense's request for
more time to prepare its case.
News reports had made it "unnecessarily difficult
to choose a jury unaffected by recent pretrial
publicity," he said.
Foat, 42, of Los Angeles, a past president of the
California chapter ot the National Organization for
Women, is charged with murdering Argentine
businessman Moises Chayo in 1965 when she
worked as a go-go girl at a bar near New Orleans.
She remains tree on $125,000 bond.
Burns said there have been just six working days
for defense lawyers to concentrate on preparing for
the trial since the state Supreme Court on Sept. 30
rejected a move to quash the indictment.
The justices refused to overturn a ruling that the
six years between 1977, when Foat was charged with
murder, and January's indictment did not violate her
right to a speedy trial.
In citing pretrial publicity, Burns did not specify a
particular report. But the defense complained about
a report jn Monday's The Times-Picayune, The
States-Item. Their primary objection was the
headline, "Prosecution can't find witness who heard
Foat talk of slaying."
