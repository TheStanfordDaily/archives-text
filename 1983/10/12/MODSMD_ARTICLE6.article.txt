# ASSU to investigate reduced library hours
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate decided last
night to look into the change in
Meyer Library's hours to deter
mine if the shortened weekend
hours there are a "fair tradeoff"
for additional end-of-quarter
study time.
The senate approved a pro
posal by senator Boh Slater which
asks the ASSU's Committee on
Undergraduate and Residential
Education to investigate the
reasons behind Meyer's new
hours.
In the proposal, Slater ex
plained that "the books, materi
als services and study carrels in
(Meyer) are often not found
anywhere else on campus, so
limiting access to them poses se
vere problems for students."
Slater said that at the end of
last year a student committee was
asked whether or not Meyer's
hours should be extended during
Dead Week and finals week.
"Of course the students said,
Yes,' " Slater said. "They weren't
told about the consequences."
The "consequence" of the ad
dition of about 14 hours at the
end of the quarter, according to
graduate senator Jim McGrath, is
a loss of eight hours of library
time per week. Senator Eric Berg
claimed that as a "tradeoff" this
hardly seemed fair.
Berg said that the cut in
Meyer's weekend hours is an im
portant student concern because
it is an "educational issue."
"Basically, the University is for
cing people to party, whether
they want to or not," Berg said.
McGrath estimated that the

cost of keeping the library open
for the eight additional hours per
quarter would be about $10,000.
He explained that as few as five
people would be needed to staff
the library during the quieter
late-night hours, and that student
staffers could be used to save ad
ditional money.
The library's official position is
that the demand for extended
Dead Week and finals week
hours exceeds the demand for
weekend use. In defense of the
new policy, Slater said that it
would be more difficult and ex
pensive to staff the library on
weekend nights than McGrath
claimed because there would
have to be a minimum number of
"adult" staffers present to mini
mize the security risk.
"Everyone seems to have con
flicting reports about this," said
senator Frank Chen. "It seems
pretty clear that nobody knows
what is going on."
The Senate also discussed the
tentative future of the Concert
Network.
Although there was some ini
tial debate whether or not the
network still exists, network
member and alternate senator
Chip Roellig assured senate
members that the network is
indeed still in existence.
He explained that the network
has fired all but one paid staff
member and is presently debat
ing whether or not to divide all
the money in the network ac
count among the groups in
volved, saving $1000 dollars for
the reformation of the organiza
tion.
