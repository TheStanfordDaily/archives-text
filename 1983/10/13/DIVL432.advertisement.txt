When Judy Lafferty
prepares for a race,
she checks every part
of her bike
Because she checks
her body the same
way, she discovered a
lump m her breast a
few years ago.
Sne discovered it
early And these days,
85% of early breast
cancers can be treated
successfully.
Judy has since had
reconstructive surgery,
too And she feels like
herself again. Alive,
vibrant, ready to get
on her bike and take
on the world.
Judy Lafferty is liv
ing proof of the pro
gress we're making
against cancer
The American
Cancer Society takes
some credit for that
progress Butcredit

work
We need your
money to help us win
ihis race.
