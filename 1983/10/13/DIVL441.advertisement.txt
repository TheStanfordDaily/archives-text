"On
Nov. 17th,
adopt
a friend
who
smokes."
Help a friend get through
the day without a cigarette
, They might just quit
forever And that's
important Because good
friends are hard to find
And even tougher to lose

Funny things
happen at college
newspapers.
Communication
between
departments isn't
always so great.
Stories get
assigned twice. Or
never at all. Photos
are made too big.
Or too small. And
the business
department
sometimes gives
the editorial
department
strange spaces like
this one to fill with
interesting
graphics and
exciting copy.
Only that isn't so
easy. What can
you do with a
space about an
inch-and-a-half
wide by 13 inches
tall? Not much.
That's where you
fit in. We don't
mean you fit in a
1 1 /2 by 13 inch
space; that was
just figurative
language. What we
do mean is that
there's a place for
you at The
Stanford Daily.
Drop by and pick
up a story.
