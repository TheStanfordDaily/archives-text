### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Seven U.S. senators have en
dorsed plans to place a Reagan
presidential library complex here,
writing in a letter to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy that the
facility would provide "a formidable
academic resource."
The letter, sent by Sen. Mark Hat
field (R-Oregon) and signed by
three other Republicans and three
Democrats, expressed the senators'
"unequivocal support of the pro
posal."
Encouraging Kennedy to direct his
"efforts and resources toward the
effort to locate" the complex here,
the senators wrote, "we stand ready
to lend our assistance to you in this
effort."
Copies of the letter, which is
dated Oct. 5, were distributed to
members of the Board of Trustees at
the regular Board meeting Tuesday.
Four of the senators are Stanford
alumni: Hatfield; Max Baucus, a
Democrat from Montana; Jeff Bin
gaman, a Democrat from New
Mexico; and California Democrat
Alan Cranston.
Other signers included Nevada
Republican Chic Hecht, whose
daughter Leslie is a junior here, and
Republicans Charles Percy, from Illi
nois, and Pete Wilson, from Califor
nia.
"Stanford University has main
tained its standing in the academic
community through the devotion of
Competent administrators and
professors, industrious students,
and demanding and diverse cur
ricula," the letter said.
"A modern presidential library
would provide the University with a
formidable academic resource that
would provide a unique dimension
to college life at Stanford."
The letter is one of hundreds Ken
nedy and others have received on
the library.
More than 200 faculty members
responded to a solicitation and sent
letters expressing their views to a
faculty committee headed by Eco
nomics Prof, lames Kosse, whose
report was given to the Board lues
day. Many of the letters are thought
to raise questions about the merits
of the library complex, but most
have not yet been made public be

cause their authors sent them to the
committee on a confidential basis.
At the Hoover Institution,
hundreds of letters- enough to form
a packet nearly an inch thick — have
been received from former Hoover
scholars in response to a request
from Hoover Deputy Director Den
nis Bark. Nearly all of those letters
express unqualified support of the
Reagan library proposal.
