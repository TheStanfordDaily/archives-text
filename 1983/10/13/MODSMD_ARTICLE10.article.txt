# High tech and high hopes, but few jobs

Dressed for success and bearing
brochures, they came to talk business.
The atmosphere was light-hearted,
though. Festive fringed umbrellas and
white balloons filled the sun-filled
White Plaza.
Last Friday 76 representatives of
companies and organizations manned
tables at what has become a much
anticipated annual event. Sponsored
by the Career Planning and Placement
Center, the Career Faire gives students
the opportunity to job-hunt without
ever leaving campus.
The annual event also allows
employers to meet prospective
employees. But not all the participants
were recruiting. "Our company hires
people already with work experience,"
Robin Winburn of Levi Strauss frankly
explained.
Describing her role at the faire as
"informational, not recruiting," Win
burn said that "the entry level posi
tions are in sales training."
But other faire participants were
actively trying to find newcomers.
"We're looking for types of en
gineers— civil, electrical and all types of
degrees except theology and
medicine," said Lt. J.G. )ohnny FHol
lowell of the U.S. Coast Guard. The
representative at the neighboring
table, Lt. Stephen Grey of the U.S.
Navy and Engineering Program, was in

the market for "hard science"
graduates as well.
While Hollowell called Stanford a
"high-tech" institution, Grey said a
Stanford candidate is no more
desirable than one from "Berkeley,
Cal-Poly or Davis." He did say,
howevpr that there is a "higher
percentage of qualified students (here)
than at other schools."
In addition to the 75 individual com
pany and organization tables, the faire
included eight "special tables" in the
general areas of entrepeneurship,
health, government, social services
and education. These booths were
staffed by members of the various
fields who were available to answer
questions about careers and their own
particular experiences.
Discussion of "the bottom line" was
what one got with a stop at the adver
tising table. )ohn Wichett from Win
ston Ad., Inc. was talking to a last
quarter senior who was seeking ad
vice. "(Advertising) is a service busi
ness," Wichett said from behind a pair
of black sunglasses.
With a few more years until she hits
the job market, Diane Patterson was at
the faire just to browse. Because
"they're not going to hire freshmen,"
Patterson had been telling representa
tives she was a senior. Patterson plans
to major in mathematical sciences, a
choice which she said "pleases these
people to no end."

This year 39 of the companies were
interested in non-technical students,
an increase of 10 over last year, said
faire coordinator Valarie Thomas.
Both Xerox Corporation and Avan
tek, a microwave communication busi
ness, were listed as being interested in
both technical and non-technical stu
dents. Timothy Mathues, who was
representing the office sytems division
of Xerox, said 20 percent of their posi
tions are non-technical.
Mathues was hard-put, however,
when asked what he might say to an
English major interested in the compa
ny. "That could be tough," he said,
calling the student's options "very lim
ited," mostly likely in the company's
areas of marketing and finance.
When asked the same question,
Avantek's Wayne Kennon was more
encouraging. "It would depend on the
English major's interests. In marketing
and sales, communication-oriented
positions, we would want you to be
able to express yourself well. We
would also like some technical course
background. That way you'd be less
afraid to learn (about Avantek's prod
ucts)."
In agreement with other Career
Faire participants, Kennon described a
Stanford degree as"a door-opener."
"But," he warned, a job offer "always
depends on the person."
