# Stanford Super Bowl means few stadium improvements
## 
### MARK GILLIS 
When the top two teams in the NFL face one
another at Stanford for Super Bowl XIX in I9BS,
Stanford Stadium will not look significantly dif
ferent than it does now.
The NFL has only required Stanford to
renovate its present locker room facilities as a
prerequisite for hosting the game.
The NFL's request is no surprise to Stanford's
Athletic Department. According to assistant
athletic director Dave Glen, the stadium's
present locker room situation is "inadequate
and inefficient."
"This (building a new locker room) is a
given," Glen said. The new facility, to be built
at the open end of the stadium, where the cur
rent locker room shacks are now, will be a
combination locker/shower room for both
teams.
Depending upon available funds, Stanford's
next priority project is the construction of a
permanent facility at Gate Two to house the
extra ticket sales and concessions booths and
bathrooms that a Super Bowl requires.
This change would relieve some pressure
from the inadequate existing facilities, Glen
said.
Other projects which the Athletic Depart
ment will consider undertaking to enhance the
stadium include placing direction signs along
the outside stairwells and some refurbishing of
the present restroom facilities.
The Athletic Department will not replace any

of the wooden benches in the stadium heyond
the necessary yearly repairs for damage.
Despite the added luxury that aluminum
seating or seatbacks would create, they would
not improve the seating because "they would
be incredibly expensive and would cut down
on the seating capacity of the stadium," Glen
said.
The NFL will make the remaining improve
ments by installing the temporary lights
needed for the 4 p.m. kickoff, renovating the
press box and making minor changes in the
public address system.
Stadium improvements will take place after
the Shrine football game next year and before
the 1984 Summer (Olympic soccer games. The
University will pay for its share of the work
through fundraising projects in the Bay Area
community.
Expressing his belief that the cost ot hosting
the Super Bowl should not cut into the pool of
money from Stanford's present contributors,
Vice President for Development Bruce Hinch
cliffe said, "The Athletic Department real
ly does have to locate sources which will not be
competitive with present sources. We will pro
vide advice and council."
But Glen said that if anything fundraising for
the Super Bowl will improve the University's
overall fundraising picture.

Bay Area community who have an interest in
seeing the game played here to contribute. We
want to attract new friends to Stanford, primari
ly corporations," he said.
Glen said he believes that the preparations
for Super Bowl XIX "will make Stanford
Stadium a better place to view a football
game."
The planned minimal changes alone will cost
close to $1 million, and Glen hopes to raise
$750,000 to $1 million from outside sources, hie
looks upon the game and its expenses as a
community project of mutual aid because the
Bay Area community has always wanted to host
the Super Bowl, and Stanford Stadium is the
only facility in the area which is large enough to
host the game.

"We did it as a chance to be a good neigh
bor: The game wouldn't be here if it weren't for
Stanford University and we need the help of
the community to pay for the cost of the
game."
San Francisco community leaders estimate
that the game will generate $80 million of reve
nue for the area, Glen said.
He said the NFL's choice to hold the game
here is a good one for the Bay Area, for Stan
ford and for the NFL.
"The NTL iiked San Francisco as it is one of
the great tourist cities in the country. The
visibility is a plus for Stanford; it can't hurt us in
recruiting."
Although the Athletic Department will
receive a small number of the Super Bowl tick
ets, Glen said it will be "virtually impossible for
the average citizen" to get tickets since the de
partment will use them for fundraising
purposes.

the average citizen" to get tickets since the de

purposes.
