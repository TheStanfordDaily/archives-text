We wholeheartedly endorse the Rosse com
mittee's advisory report to University President
Donald Kennedy on the proposed Ronald
Reagan presidential library, public policy cen
ter and museum. We agree that the museum
has little scholarly value, that the policy center
should be better integrated into the traditional
University governance system, and that the li
brary could be an academic asset to the Univer
sity.
We sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees
weighs the faculty committee's recommen
dations with appropriate deliberation and fol
lows their lead.
The Rosse committee report, made public
Tuesday, recommends that the three compo
nents of the proposed Reagan library complex
be "decoupled to permit separate considera
tion of the parts." This is a wise move. The
consideration of a presidential library, with ob
vious academic value; a policy center, with
possible partisan influence on the University;
and a museum, dedicated to glorifying a presi
dent, are distinct issues.
By considering each component separately,
the University is free to accept one and not the
others. Thus we again urge that the library be
welcomed.
The committee is to be commended for re
questing that no decision be made until all
views are aired; it is silly, however, to propose —
as the Rosse committee did — that any decision
be postponed until after the November 1984
elections or, alternatively, until Reagan decides
not to run for re-election.
They suggest that to accept or reject the
complex before such a date would amount to
an endorsement — or renouncement — of the
Reagan campaign. Certainly the University can
agree to house a president's papers sometime
in the future and not be accused of playing
politics. To make some decisions as soon as
constructive debate subsides would be a relief
to the entire community; nobody wants the
Reagan controversy to be an issue for the next
13 months. As Hoover archivist Charles Palm

points out, such a delay "would only ex
acerbate the controversy without changing any
minds."
Still, it is encouraging that the committee
recommends that no final decision should be
reached without the advice of the Faculty Sen
ate. This consultation is especially necessary
when we consider that more than 200 of Stan
ford's 1200 faculty wrote to the committee to
their opinions — an unprecedented demonstra
tion of faculty concern.
The committee report also notes correctly
that the Ronald Reagan museum would have
"little or no academic value." As we have said
previously, we fail to see how the glorification
of the memorabilia of a former president fits in
with the purposes of an academic institution.
The Rosse report also proposes that the
Ronald Reagan center for public affairs come
under the provost's authority. Agreeing with
several outspoken opponents of a public
policy center run by Hoover personnel, the
committee recommends that the governing
committee of the proposed center "be ap
pointed by the provost with substantial Stan
ford faculty membership." That is good advice,
but care should be taken to make sure that the
governing group is nonpartisan.
In an individual addendum to the report, Po
litical Science Prof. Alexander George and His
tory Prof. Barton Bernstein question whether
the political symbolism associated with a
Reagan presidential library and public affairs
center might "markedly reinforce the conser
vative image that many persons already attri
bute" to Stanford. The concerns of George and
Bernstein only serve to return the issue to one
of politics. The "outside world" must realize
that the University's acceptance of any part of
the complex is a reflection of its concern for
academic excellence, not political bent.
On the whole, the Rosse committee did a
superb job of dealing with a controversial
issue. We only hope their deliberations will be
heeded by the people with the power to make
the ultimate decision.
