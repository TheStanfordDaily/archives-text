The Faculty Senate will discuss an important
proposal today that would open up its
meetings to all media. Spurred by the protest
of Palo Alto Weekly editor Tim Clark, the sen
ate will review its current policy which bars all
media from the meetings except those desig
nated as "campus media," namely The Stan
tord Daily, KZSLJ and the LJ niversity's informa
tion officer.
The new proposal is a good one. For years
the senate has provided a forum for the robust
debate of important University issues, includ
ing issues which affect the Palo Alto communi
ty and the nation. Recent senate debates have
centered on issues of outside interest such as
the Reagan library, the Hoover Institution, ten
ure policies and affirmative action. By barring
reporters from these debates, the University
appears to be unaware or disregardful of its
importance beyond the University community.
University administrators and faculty are ap
parently divided on the issue. Opponents of an
open policy argue that only "campus media"
are able to understand the the context of the
senate meetings. They also argue that the pres
ence of outside reporters and cameras might
be "distracting." These arguments just don't

hold water.
The administrators of Stanford University
can surely devise some way for allowing news
paper reporters and even television cameras
into the meetings without providing a distrac
tion. A widely used practice of city councils
and federal committees is to set aside a section
specifically for the press. The current policy
only provides an unwarranted hindrance to
outside reporters who need to cover the
meetings on these rare yet important occa
sions.
While the campus media are free to cover
the meetings, other papers such as the Penin
sula Times Tribune, the San Jose Mercury
News and The New York Times must stand
outside, waiting for the faculty to adjourn so
they can quiz them on what happened. The
reporters must then piece together their
stories from reports by the "campus media" or
from comments given after the meeting.
The arguments against open meetings seem
particularly inappropriate in a University com
munity which prides itself on openness and
freedom of discussion. More than anyone,
academics should know that increased discus
sion of issues enhances, rather than inhibits,
debate.
