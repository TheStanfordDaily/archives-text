# Trying to understand feminism
## 
### 
I came to Stanford thinking I knew
what feminism was and certain that I
supported it. But a two-year odyssey
of exposure to feminist newspapers,
feminist lecture series and feminists
themselves has made me realize that
the term "feminism" is so broad that
it allows many diverse (and per
verse) ideologies to march under
one banner.
During the spring quarter of my
freshman year, I went to a sympo
sium at Kresge and saw my first radi
cal feminist, Andrea Dworkin. Ms.
Dworkin denounced all sexual inter
course involving the phallus as
"inherently violent." All men, like
all capitalist states, were concerned
only with conquest. The penis, in
her scheme, was man's "imperialist
weapon" to achieve that end. The
girl sitting next to me applauded this
interpretation vigorously, so I asked
her if she understood what Dworkin
was trying to say with all her Marx
ist terminology. "She's trying to say
she hates men."
I left the Dworkin symposium dis
gruntled but assured that those who
agreed with her were a small
minority. Nonetheless, it seemed
that this small minority was at every
movie I liked, hissing every time a
woman was depicted in a stereotypi
cal way â€” as a heterosexual, for exam
ple.
During the summer I complained
to my friend at Yale about the radical
feminists at Stanford, but after
talking to him, I felt lucky to be
here. At Yale there is a women's
group called "Chicks against Pricks"
(CHAPS). Curious about what the
name meant, he asked one chick,
"What do you guys propose to do?
Castrate all men?"
She was taken aback. "No. We are
idealists. Castration is not enough."

After working in a large corpora
tion this summer, I got the impres
sion that the most prevalent form of
feminism is not the radical kind
common at Stanford or Yale. It is the
brand of feminism practiced by the
"new woman" or the Cosmopolitan
Girl.
She is ambitious and indepen
dent. It is all right for her to have sex
without love, and it is downright
upright to invite a man over for Har
vey's Bristol Cream. Sleeping with
married men has its advantages, and
sex outside marriage is exhilarating.
Her career is her primary concern.
She's willing to work hard to climb
the ladder of success. As comedian
Mort Sahl once pointed out, "The
New Woman looks a lot like the Old
Man."
A recent article in September's
Cosmopolitan demonstrates the
liberated New Woman's attitude. Ex
plains one woman fresh from a one
night stand, "However lovely the ex
perience with Scotty had been, I
didn't really care if I ever saw him
again." Another woman justifies her
pursuit of one-night partners by
pointing out, "Men have always had
that option."
These two women have leveled
the double standard, leaving in its
place the male single standard.
When women say, "Men have al
ways had the option," it indicates
that they were never morally
outraged by male behavior in the
first place; they just wanted equal
opportunity. That kind of thinking
makes Hugh Hefner smile.
I have become wary of
"feminism" because I am confused
by its many manifestations. It is diffi
cult to tell exactly what feminists
want.
For example, I was having a good

discussion with a woman who was
up on all of the feminist arguments.
When we both started to get into
the conversation, her boyfriend, a
Donahue figure, came in. She told
him the topic, sat on his lap, and let
him take over the argument.
Some men, on the other hand,
don't know what they want when
they oppose feminism. At a small
party I attended, one guy was ran
ting and raving about how he
couldn't stand feminists anymore.
"If you buy a girl flowers or take her
out to dinner, she thinks that all
you're trying to do is get into her
pants."
One of the women replied,
"Three guys have asked me out this
year, and I didn't think they were
trying to get in my pants."
With a smirk, he shot back,
"Think again." At that moment it oc
curred to me that he sounded a lot
like Andrea Dworkin.
It's really no wonder that there is
all this hypocrisy and confusion.
Men and women are under the im
pression that there is one cause
called "feminism" that speaks for all
women.
No interest group can speak for
the entire minority it represents,
and the women's movement, by its
very nature, can't even come close.
The movement represents a gender,
not a class. Women have such a di
versity of backgrounds, opinions,
attitudes, preferences, fantasies and
ambitions that, with a few excep
tions (i.e., equal pay for equal
work), to speak for women as a
group is truly degrading to their in
dividuality. You might as well dress
them in bunny suits.
