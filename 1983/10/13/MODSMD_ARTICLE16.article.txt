Alcohol policy OK
Last Thursday's "Reformulate
alcohol policy" (Daily, Oct. 6)
editorial reflected an unfortunate
lack of thought in its assumptions
and conclusions.
In that editorial, The Daily
quoted the Office of Residential
Education as saying, 'RAs were
encouraged to deemphasize alco
hol at all parties during the year."
They then ask, "Is this the first
step toward the prohibition of
alcohol in all dorms?" implying
that it is, indeed, such a step.

This conclusion is completely
unfounded. Only nine days before,
Asst. Dean of Residential Edu
cation Alice Supton was quoted as
saying, "The office does not
believe in prohibition. We believe
that the resident assistants know
what will go well in a party at their
dorms." Although Res Ed is making
a concerted effort to decrease the
emphasis on alcohol in dorms, the
office has never even hinted at a
prohibitionist policy.
The Daily was particularly upset
about a proposal which would
require the elimination of all

alcohol-related terms from the
announcements of on-campus
events. Such a proposal is neces
sary, however, for Res Ed to be
consistent in their efforts to deem
phasize alcohol here.
Terms such as "happy hour" and
"daiquiri party" place an overt
emphasis on alcohol. By not acting
on the use of these terms, the
office would be implicitly condon
ing them.
The editorial also suggests that
the University "develop a balanced
attitude toward alcohol," one
which "encourages RAs to provide

both alcoholic and 'equally attrac
tive' non-alcoholic beverages at all
dorm parties."
The University does not need to
encourage RAs to provide alcohol
at parties. The vast majority of
parties have always included, and
will continue to include, alcohol.
The houses which chose not to
serve alcohol during orientation
parties did so because their staffs
decided that such a party would be
the best experience for everyone
involved, and not because a
prohibitionist policy is "making
headway."

The present policy does not call
for the elimination of alcohol, but
rather the elimination of the pres
sure to drink which has been so
prevalent in the past. The final
decision about when to serve alco
hol is left, as it should be, with the
individual houses.

In Leon Dayan's viewpoint
(Daily, Oct. 6) it is unclear what is
really bothering him: is it the
peace movement, vegetarianism,
the 19605, Isla Vista, draft resisters,
or maybe his high school buddy?
Dayan, in his personal struggle,
manages to belittle fhe peace
movement and create a fallacious
alliance between drug users and
vegetarians. At the risk of appear
ing historical, I find Dayan's
facade-filled vignette contains
more pathos and fallacies than
Nixon's acceptance speech of 1968.

Underage drinking
I was particularly struck by your
front page article on freshman
drinking (Daily, Sept. 27) as an
example of Stanford's attitude.
Clearly, the University has set itself
apart as a law and land unto itself,
accountable only to its students'
ways of thinking. Alcohol, as I
understand the state's legal sanc
tion, may be served only to per
sons over 21 years old. Since very
few freshmen are of this age, much
less many sophomores, juniors and
seniors, it amazes me that any
alcoholic beverages are served at
all at freshman functions!
Perhaps Stanford could look to
the University of Santa Clara and
its recently instituted Policy on
Alcohol Use on Campus for an
example of how it too might sup
port, instead of flaunt, the state's
laws regarding underage drinking.
