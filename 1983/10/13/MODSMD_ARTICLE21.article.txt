# A 						dairy and a Dish full of cows
## Bug Me 
### 
Who owns the tows that live
lip by the Dish?
For at least the past 50 years,
the University has leased its
properties surrounding the
Dish and the various antennae
amongst the foothills behind
campus to the Piers Dairy. Ac
cording to Dana Piers, Piers
Dairy uses the lands to graze
their beef steers from the
spring through the fall of each
year. This year about 885 head
of the beasts will lumber
about amid the joggers, pic
nickers and obsolete radio
equipment.
Piers mentioned a
noteworthy change in policy
concerning the excursions
into the Dish area; everyone
crossing the fence beyond
Junipero Serra must have a
dish pass card as of this Octo
ber. Passes can be picked up
(Free!) at Encina Gym with a
current student I.D.
Piers cited several reasons
for the restrictions on Dish
visitors. Destruction of fences
by vandals has led to cows
boldly wandering where no
cow has gone before, seeking
out Highway 280, Junipero

Serra and various non-bovine
sections of campus, and so
on. Also, dogs who get into
the Dish area can run a steer
for up to 15 minutes, putting it
into shock, giving it
pneumonia, and/or breaking a
leg. Two dogs can run down a
steer, often killing it. Further
more, a Palo Alto boy
drowned last year in a lake on

the property. (The lake is al
most all the way to 280 and if
you must go, don't forget your
pass.)
To wrap it up, I had to ask
one question that has been
bugging me for four years
now. Is it possible to "tip"
cows? I've seen people try,
but I've never seen anyone get
within spitting distance of one
of those cows. Piers con
firmed my belief that cows

sleep standing up but claimed
that even if you get close
enough to push, you couldn't
budge the napping cow,
which weighs in at 400-500
pounds now and will be ZOO
BOO pounds by the spring.
Chances are that even the
entire Band would find it
impossible to tackle so much
as one cow.

What is a bollard? Where do
they come from? What do they
want from us?
These facts and more are
contained in Bug Me's latest
booklet release "The History
of the Stanford bollards." To
receive your copy, all you
have to do is submit a Bug Me
question that we use in the
column. That's all for this
week.
