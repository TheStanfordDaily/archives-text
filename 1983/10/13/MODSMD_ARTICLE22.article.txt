## Berns Aside • Adam Berns An old species dies; a new one emerges 
### 
Legend tells us of two
species of tootball players
which have existed on Leland
Stanford's farm for many
years. One species was called
"football player offensius"
while the other was known as
"football player defensius."
Football player offensius
quickly became the predomi
nant species on campus.

Walking with its head high in
the air, this species was
known for its lightning quick
attack and flew though the air
with great speed.
The other species, football
player defensius, became a
forgotten entity. These poor
creatures were kept chained
up at the Delt house and kept
out of sight. Sometimes they

could be seen crawling
around campus in the dark of
night.
But like the dinosaur, toot
ball player offensius is starting
to die, and a new species is
emerging. Crawling out from
beneath the rafters and under
long forgotten buried kegs at
the Delt House, a new species
is replacing the old.

So what happened to real
Stanford football?
Vou know, the offense
scores on every drive and then
the defense gives the points
right back. I mean it was all so
predic table.
Every year there were the
few big upsets. John Elway,
Guv Benjamin, Turk Schonert
or some other Stanford quar
terback would have such a hot
hand that even the Cardinal
defense would not let the
other team score last enough.
Of course, there were also
the few random losses to
schools like Oregon State, but
no one ever seemed to care.
Stanford's passing arsenal al
ways kept the fans happy, and
more importantly, put points
on the board.
Points this year, however,
have become almost as rare as
an endangered species. In five
games, the Cardinal has
scored only 63 points — seven
by the defense. Not since 1962
has any Stanford team scored
so tew points in the first five
games ot the season. In fact,
in 1968 and 1969, the Cardinal
scored more points in its
opening games than Stanford
has this season.
Actually, the year's figures
are worse than they first ap
pear.
Take last Saturday's game
against UCLA. The Cardinal
scored 21 points, its highest
output of the season. Should
this be reason for celebration.
Look at the figures closely.
For starters, the offense only
scored 14 of those points. But
it gets worse.
The offense also directly
gave up two touchdowns off
intercepted passes. Total net
output for the offense: 0.
I hat's right, nothing.

To make matters worse, the
offense directly set up a
couple of UCLA field goals.
Was the offensive output actu
ally negative?
Now everybody knows that
Stanford has never had much
of a running game, except tor
four brilliant years of Darrin
Nelson, but this year the
ground game borders on pat
hetic, only 189 yards in five
games. That's as much as
some backs gain in a week.
But the real horror about
the offensive failures is that it
comes at a time when Stanford
seems to have found a
credible detense.
The defense actually finds it
self listed among the NCAA
leaders in defensing the pass
and ranks first in the Pacific-10
in that category, giving up
only 139.4 yards per game.
Quite a change from last
year's squad which gave up
215.3 passing yards a game
and ranked last in the confer
ence in that cateogory.
Whatever Paul Wiggin's
failings are as Stanford's head
coach, he has done an excel
lent job with the defense.
A new breed ot player has
emerged, people like middle
linebacker Dave Wyman,
strong safety Vaughn Wil
liams, and defensive end
Carin Veris.
Today, football player offen
sius slowly begins its crawl to
the dirt beneath the Delt
House. As one timid member
of football player offensius
tries to convince a female ot
the species, "blonde gorgia"
that he is actually a fifth string
line member of the defensius
species . . .
One can only wonder what
it would be like to have two
healthy species at the same
time. One can only wonder...

Legend tells us of two
species of tootball players
which have existed on Leland
Stanford's farm for many
years. One species was called
"football player offensius"
while the other was known as
"football player defensius."
Football player offensius
quickly became the predomi
nant species on campus.

Walking with its head high in
the air, this species was
known for its lightning quick
attack and flew though the air
with great speed.
The other species, football
player defensius, became a
forgotten entity. These poor
creatures were kept chained
up at the Delt house and kept
out of sight. Sometimes they

could be seen crawling
around campus in the dark of
night.
But like the dinosaur, toot
ball player offensius is starting
to die, and a new species is
emerging. Crawling out from
beneath the rafters and under
long forgotten buried kegs at
the Delt House, a new species
is replacing the old.

So what happened to real
Stanford football?
Vou know, the offense
scores on every drive and then
the defense gives the points
right back. I mean it was all so
predic table.
Every year there were the
few big upsets. John Elway,
Guv Benjamin, Turk Schonert
or some other Stanford quar
terback would have such a hot
hand that even the Cardinal
defense would not let the
other team score last enough.
Of course, there were also
the few random losses to
schools like Oregon State, but
no one ever seemed to care.
Stanford's passing arsenal al
ways kept the fans happy, and
more importantly, put points
on the board.
Points this year, however,
have become almost as rare as
an endangered species. In five
games, the Cardinal has
scored only 63 points — seven
by the defense. Not since 1962
has any Stanford team scored
so tew points in the first five
games ot the season. In fact,
in 1968 and 1969, the Cardinal
scored more points in its
opening games than Stanford
has this season.
Actually, the year's figures
are worse than they first ap
pear.
Take last Saturday's game
against UCLA. The Cardinal
scored 21 points, its highest
output of the season. Should
this be reason for celebration.
Look at the figures closely.
For starters, the offense only
scored 14 of those points. But
it gets worse.
The offense also directly
gave up two touchdowns off
intercepted passes. Total net
output for the offense: 0.
I hat's right, nothing.

To make matters worse, the
offense directly set up a
couple of UCLA field goals.
Was the offensive output actu
ally negative?
Now everybody knows that
Stanford has never had much
of a running game, except tor
four brilliant years of Darrin
Nelson, but this year the
ground game borders on pat
hetic, only 189 yards in five
games. That's as much as
some backs gain in a week.
But the real horror about
the offensive failures is that it
comes at a time when Stanford
seems to have found a
credible detense.
The defense actually finds it
self listed among the NCAA
leaders in defensing the pass
and ranks first in the Pacific-10
in that category, giving up
only 139.4 yards per game.
Quite a change from last
year's squad which gave up
215.3 passing yards a game
and ranked last in the confer
ence in that cateogory.
Whatever Paul Wiggin's
failings are as Stanford's head
coach, he has done an excel
lent job with the defense.
A new breed ot player has
emerged, people like middle
linebacker Dave Wyman,
strong safety Vaughn Wil
liams, and defensive end
Carin Veris.
Today, football player offen
sius slowly begins its crawl to
the dirt beneath the Delt
House. As one timid member
of football player offensius
tries to convince a female ot
the species, "blonde gorgia"
that he is actually a fifth string
line member of the defensius
species . . .
One can only wonder what
it would be like to have two
healthy species at the same
time. One can only wonder...
