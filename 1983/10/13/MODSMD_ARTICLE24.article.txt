The Stanford women's field
hockey team climbed from last
week's No. 15 ranking to the
No. 12 spot in this week's
NCAA Field Hockey Poll.
The climb was largely due to
the Cardinal's performance
last week. Stanford defeated
Chico State, 3-1, and No. 16
Southwest Missouri, 4-1, while
losing a pair of tight contests
to No. 3 lowa, 2-1, and No. 8
Northwestern, 2-0. The latter
three contests were part of the
Northwestern Invitational last
weekend.
The move into the Top 12
was particularly important to
the Cardinal because the
NCAA tournament will take
the top 12 teams in thp
country, as determined by the
final poll, to compete in a

playoff round for a chance to
make the NCAA Finals. The
Finals will be played next
Tuesday and Wednesday at
Franklin Field on the campus
of the University of Pennsylva
nia in Philadelphia.
Stanford will host NorPac
Conference leader San lose
State this afternoon at \ p.m.
The Cardinal has fated the
Spartans twice earlier this
year, dropping a 5-1 decision
Sept. 17 at San Jose and losing,
4-2, Sept. 24 at the Long Beach
State Invitational Tournament.
If Stanford can knock oft the
No. 7 ranked Spartans, the
Cardinal will all but lock up an
NCAA bid. The Cardinal
stands currently at 6-5 on the
season, 4-3 in the NorPac Con
ference.
