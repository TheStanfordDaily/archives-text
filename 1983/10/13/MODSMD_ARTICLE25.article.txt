San Francisco (AP) — Plans for the largest
retractable-domed stadium in the United
States-a70,000-seatfacility thatwould bethe
new home of baseball's San Francisco Giants
and football's San Francisco 49ers — were an
nounced yesterday by Mayor Dianne
Feinstein.
The stadium would cost between $120 mil
lion and $170 million, according to a mayor's
task force that has been working on the idea
for more than a year.
City supervisors would have to approve
legislation before construction could begin.
Financing also has to be decided from
several possibilities.
It also would be necessary in a referen
dum next June for voters to approve the sale
of city-owned Candlestick Park, which
Giants' owner Bob Lurie believes is no
longer suitable for his team.
Lurie has threatened to move the Giants
out of San Francisco after his Candlestick
Park Ipase expires in 1994 unless a down

town stadium is available before then.
"To even consider spending any money
on this place (Candlestick) is ridiculous,"
said Lurie, who wants his team playing in the
new stadium at the start of the 1987 season.
Candlestick, about six miles from San
Francisco's central business district, was
built in 1960. The report proposes that the
stadium be built in the closer China Basin
area on land owned by the Port of San Fran
cisco and the California Transportation De
partment.
I he domed stadium, which also would
serve the San Francisco college basketball
teams and provide additional exhibition
space, will hold 70,000 football seats and
64,000 baseball seats, according to the
report.
The only other stadium in the country
with a retractable roof is the much smaller
Pittsburgh Civic Arena, a 17,000-seat facility
primarily used for hockey and basketball.
