# Orioles even series with 4-7 victory

### ROB ZWEIG 
Rookie Mike Boddicker hurled a
three-hit gem and John Lowenstein
ignited a dormant Oriole offense with
three hits, including a solo home run,
as the Baltimore Orioles rallied for a
4-1 victory over the Philadelphia
Phillies that knotted the 1983 World
Series at one game apiece.
Boddicker, the American League
Championship's Most Valuable Player,
chalked up his second consecutive
complete game victory in post-season
play by pitching to just 30 hitters, strik
ing out six and walking none in a per
formance that mirrored his 4-0
whitewash of the Chicago White Sox in
the playoffs.

But it took ]ohn Lowenstein's leadoff
homer in the bottom of the fifth inning
to start a three-run rally that carried
Boddicker to victory.
The Phillies hard-throwing rookie
Charles Hudson was sailing along with
a 1-0 lead and had been nicked for just
one hit — a Lowenstein double in the
second -when the left-hand hitting out
fielder ripped a low fastball over the
405-foot sign in dead center field to tie
the game.
Suddenly, the bottom half of the Bal
timore order came to life.
Second baseman Rich Dauer got his
first hit in post-season play with a
frozen rope single to left. Todd Cruz
wanted to sacrifice Dauer to second,

but landed on first with a single when
Phillies second baseman Joe Morgan
was late covering first base.
Morgan's mistake proved crucial be
cause Rick Dempsey followed with a
run-scoring double into the right field
corner giving the American Leaguers a
2-1 lead.
Boddicker then sent his mound op
ponent to an early shower and helped
his own cause with an RBI sacrifice fly
that scored Cruz from third.
The two clubs resume the best-of
seven series in Philadelphia tomorrow
night with Mike Flanagan on the
mound for the Birds while the Phils
counter with veteran ace Steve
Carlton.
