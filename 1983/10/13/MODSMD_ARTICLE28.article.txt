■ cy/cf's Play is important
■ stuff. Author Charles Fuller
■ won a Pulitzer Prize for the
■ drama, as well as a truck-
Bload of other trophies; the
E| Negro I nsemble Company,
Eg featured in this touring pro-
H due lion, has similarly won a
■ heckuva lot of acclaim for
Eg their work (making up, per
| haps, for their relatively un
■ noticed history of quality
I theatre); and the Marines
I Memorial Theatre, with its
medals and portraits in the
lobby and a portrait of the
Marines at Iwo )ima hang
ing above the stairs, is a
partii ularly strong
reminder of the general
bseriousness of the play, set
|| at an Army base in
||| Louisiana in 1943.

And it you look at the
plot of tlic play, it's easy to
tell that this is not the stuff
of Middle-Sized San Fran
cisco I heat re. A Soldier's
Play begins with the mur
der of a drunken black ser
geant of fort Neal, scream
ing (and laughing), "They
still hate you" at his un
known assailant. I he rest of
the two hours is spent
looking for the killer, with
the help of Captain Richard
Davenport, a black lawyer
turned Ml' with a penchant
for Mac Arthur sunglasses
and exposition at the foot
"of the staue.

In short, A Soldier's Play
is a court room drama about
rac ism in the South. Hmm,
not much new there. And
it's hardly a revelation that
Sergeant Waters is killed by
an Army issue revolver at a
base with a 90 percent
black population; the pos
sibility of the kkk being re
sponsible is tossed around
loosely at the beginning of
the show, and then thrown
away perfunctorily when
things get really serious.
What catalyzes this play,
and ultimately makes it a
fascinating drama, is
primarily Fuller's probing
style of writing, which c are
fully follows all the rules of
whodunit mystery writing
(there are more than a few
scenes of Captain Daven
port asking "Why didn't

you tell me this before?")
while ignoring the central
issue of guilt. The more
powerful motive here
belongs to Waters, a cer
tifiably vicious man who
asks questions like "You
know the damage one ig
norant Negro can do?" and
kowtows to the white offi
cers, while openly vilifying
the black troops in his
command who show him
anything more than a pro
fessional show of respect.
Rather than concentrating
on the all-too-obvious pres
ence of rac ism, Fuller adds
the troubling question of

what are you going to do
about it, and it is this that
forms the real substance of
A Soldier's Play.
Waters, it turns out
through the combined
stories of the troops, was
more of a tyrant to the
blacks at Fort Neal than the
racist whites, baiting his
men and holding them in
open contempt. I he
reasons behind his particu
lar psychosis - an in
domitable sense of pride
and shame at the treatment
of his race - are buried in
the background, bypassing
the familiar tough-but-fair
drill sergeant and heading
straight for Colonel kurtz
land. It may be one thing to
be perfectionist in your
own standards and in those
under your command (after
all, this is the military), but
Waters is responsible tor
the death by suicide of one
of his men, and ultimately,
his own, through his
twisted and tormented re
action to the racist world he
knows. He is a fascinating
character, sketched well by
Graham Brown, more ef
fectively in the lighter
(sometimes drunken) mo
ments than the loud,
shocking ones.
It isn't that A Soldier's
Play doesn't take itself
seriously; rather, it refuses
to act self-important, even
though it is powerful. Most
of the impact is contained

in offhand linos and jokes,
like Peterson's response to
one espe< ia 11v severe cas
tration from Waters:
"Where you from? En
gland! 1 " Another of the
troops describes the Ku
Mux Man as "ain't crazy
about us tan folks in this
part of town," simultane
ously making light of his sit
uation and making quite
clear that there is a good
deal of experience behind
it.
At the same time, most of
the characters in A Soldier's
Play don't know how to
read to their experiences,
and those that do retreat,
either into the white
dominated world of the
Army (like Davenport) or
into their own brand of
dominance (like the brown
nosing Private Wilkie,
played with just the right
amount of obsequiousness
by Steven Jones). One
black officer tells Daven
port, It sure is good to see
one of us in those captain's
bars," and you can't help
but realize that his naivete
is just as glaring as if he said
"nigger" and that racism is
more than just a hatred. A
Soldiers Play is more about
characters than issues, and
Charles Fuller makes the
point bluntly, by wrenching
despair and tragedy out of a
tainted idealism. The play
shows through Oct. 23.

seriously; rather, it refuses
to act self-important, even
though it is powerful. Most
of the impact is contained

in offhand linos and jokes,
like Peterson's response to
one espe< ia 11v severe cas
tration from Waters:
"Where you from? En
gland! 1 " Another of the
troops describes the Ku
Mux Man as "ain't crazy
about us tan folks in this
part of town," simultane
ously making light of his sit
uation and making quite
clear that there is a good
deal of experience behind
it.
At the same time, most of
the characters in A Soldier's
Play don't know how to
read to their experiences,
and those that do retreat,
either into the white
dominated world of the
Army (like Davenport) or
into their own brand of
dominance (like the brown
nosing Private Wilkie,
played with just the right
amount of obsequiousness
by Steven Jones). One
black officer tells Daven
port, It sure is good to see
one of us in those captain's
bars," and you can't help
but realize that his naivete
is just as glaring as if he said
"nigger" and that racism is
more than just a hatred. A
Soldiers Play is more about
characters than issues, and
Charles Fuller makes the
point bluntly, by wrenching
despair and tragedy out of a
tainted idealism. The play
shows through Oct. 23.

And it you look at the
plot of tlic play, it's easy to
tell that this is not the stuff
of Middle-Sized San Fran
cisco I heat re. A Soldier's
Play begins with the mur
der of a drunken black ser
geant of fort Neal, scream
ing (and laughing), "They
still hate you" at his un
known assailant. I he rest of
the two hours is spent
looking for the killer, with
the help of Captain Richard
Davenport, a black lawyer
turned Ml' with a penchant
for Mac Arthur sunglasses
and exposition at the foot
"of the staue.

In short, A Soldier's Play
is a court room drama about
rac ism in the South. Hmm,
not much new there. And
it's hardly a revelation that
Sergeant Waters is killed by
an Army issue revolver at a
base with a 90 percent
black population; the pos
sibility of the kkk being re
sponsible is tossed around
loosely at the beginning of
the show, and then thrown
away perfunctorily when
things get really serious.
What catalyzes this play,
and ultimately makes it a
fascinating drama, is
primarily Fuller's probing
style of writing, which c are
fully follows all the rules of
whodunit mystery writing
(there are more than a few
scenes of Captain Daven
port asking "Why didn't

you tell me this before?")
while ignoring the central
issue of guilt. The more
powerful motive here
belongs to Waters, a cer
tifiably vicious man who
asks questions like "You
know the damage one ig
norant Negro can do?" and
kowtows to the white offi
cers, while openly vilifying
the black troops in his
command who show him
anything more than a pro
fessional show of respect.
Rather than concentrating
on the all-too-obvious pres
ence of rac ism, Fuller adds
the troubling question of

what are you going to do
about it, and it is this that
forms the real substance of
A Soldier's Play.
Waters, it turns out
through the combined
stories of the troops, was
more of a tyrant to the
blacks at Fort Neal than the
racist whites, baiting his
men and holding them in
open contempt. I he
reasons behind his particu
lar psychosis - an in
domitable sense of pride
and shame at the treatment
of his race - are buried in
the background, bypassing
the familiar tough-but-fair
drill sergeant and heading
straight for Colonel kurtz
land. It may be one thing to
be perfectionist in your
own standards and in those
under your command (after
all, this is the military), but
Waters is responsible tor
the death by suicide of one
of his men, and ultimately,
his own, through his
twisted and tormented re
action to the racist world he
knows. He is a fascinating
character, sketched well by
Graham Brown, more ef
fectively in the lighter
(sometimes drunken) mo
ments than the loud,
shocking ones.
It isn't that A Soldier's

seriously; rather, it refuses
to act self-important, even
