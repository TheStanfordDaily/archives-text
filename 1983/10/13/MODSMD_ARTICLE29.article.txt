# 'Cortez' too pushy, weepy

### STEVE VINEBERG 
In 1901, a voung Mexican,
Gregorio Co- killed a
sheriff in Gonzales, ( ex<i>- .nter
the lawman — attemptu j. ' (ar
rest Cortez as u result of a
misunderstanding — had shot
Cortez's brother. The young
man fled and managed to
elude the Texas Rangers for
some weeks but was tinally
captured, tried and sent to
prison. Robert Young's The
Hallad of Gregorio Cortez
recounts this tragic incident in
a manipulative, sentimental
fashion.
For Young and the
screenwriter, Victor Vi I -
lasenor, it is not enough that
Cortez and his family and
friends were the victims of rac
ism and a sad inability of white
Texans to comprehend the
terror and alienation forced to

accept the domination of men
whose language they could
not speak; this movie indicts
even the Texas Rangers for
worrying that they will be dis
banded by the government if
they fail to capture Cortez.
(Were the Rangers supposed
to refuse to acknowledge the
political implications of their
performance, or would the
filmmakers only have been
happy if they'd done their job
badiv? As far as I know, the
capture of an outlaw is not an
inherently racist act even it the
outlaw is Mexican.)
This is the kind of movie in
which the hero's virtue is
demonstrated by the care he
takes with his horse and the
loving way in which his wife
lathers him with shaving
cream. But Gregorio Cortez's
story would be a tragedy even

if he had beaten his wife (or
his horse), and we would be
moved by it even if Young
hadn't shoved in shameless
close-ups of Cortez's weeping
children. When drama is
already powerful, it is an insult
to be told how to respond to
