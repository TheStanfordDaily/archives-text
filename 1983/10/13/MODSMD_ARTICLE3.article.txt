# Students want representation in Hoover probe
## 
### PAM CLOYD Staff Writer 
Three student members of the
Trustee Committee on Academic Af
fairs and Development (TCAAD)
have sent a letter to William Kimball,
president of the Board of Trustees,
requesting student and faculty rep
resentation on a special committee
investigating the Hoover Institu
tion's ties to the University.
The trustees formed a committee
to investigate Hoover's ties to the
University at the recommendation
of the Faculty Senate after conten
tious debate last spring.
The student members of the
TCAAD want to change the commit
tee, which is a full committee, to a
standing committee, which would
necessarily have student and faculty
representatives.
ASSU Council of Presidents (COP)
member Karol Watson, who
coauthored the letter with two
members of the TCAAD, Nina Boh
len and Eric Berg, said her experi
ence as ASSU observer of the
TCAAD has shown her that issues
concerning the Hoover Institution
tend to get "pushed back" into the
full committee.
"We oelieve this to be an unfor
tunate situation," the letter reads,
"since the trustees are deprived of
whatever benefits result from partic
ipation of members of the student
body and faculty in your delibera
tions. Therefore, we encourage the
Board to consider ways of changing
this situation. Possible alternatives
include naming student and faculty
members to the Committee on the
Hoover Institution, inviting them to
participate as observers, or having
Board through one of the Standing
Committees."
"The most important thing we're
striving for is that students become
involved," Watson said. "Stanford
still has an aura of being politically

conservative just because of
Hoover. The library would just
heighten that, and that would affect
the type of students and faculty we
would attract."
The investigation is being handled
by the committee appointed by the
Board of Trustees, which includes
University President Donald Ken
nedy, Board President William Kim
ball, Board Vice President Nancy
Munger and trustees Warren Chris
topher and 112 rank Tatum. Munger,
Kimball and Kennedy are also mem
bers of the Hoover Board of Over
seers.
Kimball, contacted by The Daily
last night, said he has mailed a
response to the students.
"Essentially what I said was that we
are certainly willing to see them, but
right now we're up to our ears in the
Reagan library discussion," he said,
referring to the proposal to place a
Ronald Reagan library, museum and
policy center here.
He declined to comment further
until the students receive his replv.
John Manley, professor of politi
cal science and one of the leading
opponents of the Hoover Institu
tion, favors faculty and student rep
resentation on the committee.
"I certainly applaud the students'
efforts to seek membership on that
committee, and I'd like to see some
faculty representation also," he
said. "So far what we've gotten is a
five-person committee, three of
whom are overseers. I think there
should be a full-blown committee of
faculty, students and Hoover fellows
so we can have a full evaluation and
reassessment, as we ordered last
spring," he said.

press their opinions," he said.
Watson, however, downplayed
the chances of having open hearings
on the Hoover issue.
