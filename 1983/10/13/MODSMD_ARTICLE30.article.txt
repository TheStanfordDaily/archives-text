Martin Ritt's soggy Cross Creek tells the story
of author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (most fa
mous for her novel The Yearling), who — for no
reason apparent in Dalene Young's screenplay —
leaves her husband for the chance to live in a
cabin in southern Florida. There she works
hour after hour on a treacly Gothic romance,
which she sends off to the celebrated publisher
Maxwell Perkins in New York; he hates it, but
he loves her letters describing the other in
habitants of Cross Creek whose lives touch
hers, and he urges her to write stories about
them.
Subjected as we are to these letters in the
form of flowery pseudo-philosophical voice
overs about man's primal connection to the
land, we may not share Perkins' enthusiasm.
(That Gothic novel must have been really aw
ful.) However, we expect Marjorie to launch
triumphantly into her new project — setting her
neighbors' lives to prose — but the movie paints
her as unnaturally dense and unreasonably ill
tempered, so instead she barks at everyone
around her and undergoes a writer's identity
crisis, consisting of a drunken crying jag and a
race through the nighttime rain. Then she
writes the story and becomes famous (having
already learned to be independent and irrigate
orange groves.)
As Marjorie, Mary Steenburgen gives a
dreadful performance (and, with her light,

breathy voice, she's exactly the wrong actress
to deliver those long-winded voice-overs), but
it's the kind of role to make an actress despair —
especially an actress of unconventional gifts.
Luckily, Ritt has surrounded Marjorie with
people who really might inspire fiction: larger
than-life Peter Covote (who looks like he'd
stepped out of a Norman Rockwell drawing) as
her lover, Norton Baskin; Alfre Woodard, her
face bristling with contradictory emotions, as
her black housekeeper, Geechee; Rip Torn and
Dana Hill as Marsh Turner and his 13-year-old
daughter Ellie, whose relationship totters over
the issue of a yearling Ellie wants to keep as a
pet.
Rip Torn has a comic nobility and a pas
sionate expansiveness that surpass anything
he's ever shown us before, and Dana Hill's per
formance is so suffused with feeling that at
times it's almost unbearable to watch her — you
feel you're being walked through her adoles
cence, step by painful step. In the misbegotten
TV production of The Member of the Wedding
last Christmas, she read Carson McCullers'
lines as if she were unaware of the poetry in
them, but here — as in Shoot the Moon — her
readings seem not only impeccable, but in
evitable. Her scenes with Rip Torn lead Cross
Creek away from its fraudulent, Golden Book
vision of attaining maturity into a complex,
troubled world where love can be destructive
and change irrevocable.
