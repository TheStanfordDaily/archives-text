# 'Beyond the Limit' falls short
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Beyond the Limit is an intel
ligently made, workmanlike
movie, but it isn't memorable.
The director, John Mackenzie,
tends to place himself entirely
at the service of his material,
but whereas his last picture,
The Long Good Friday, had a
special script — spiky and
menacing — Christopher
Hampton's adaptation of
Graham Greene's minor novel
The Honorary Consul lacks
fine shadings, though he
presents the narrative clearly,
with all Greene's ironies faith

fully intact.
Michael Caine plays an in
significant British official in Ar
gentina, Charley Fortnurn,
who is kidnaped by some
Paraguayan revolutionaries
who mistake him for an Ameri
can ambassador, and Richard
Cere plays a young doctor,
Eduardo Plarr, seduced into
working with the kidnapers bv
the hope of freeing his father,
a political prisoner.
Plarr is also the lover of
Fortnum's wife Clara (Elpidia
Carrillo), an ex-whore. Caine
and Carrillo (who played the

Mexican woman lack Nichol
son aided in The Border) give
subtle, substantial perfor
mances, and Richard Cere,
though he looks completely
wrong for the role of an
Anglo-Paraguayan medic, has
two or three scenes in which
he does the only truly
thoughtful acting I've ever
seen from him. (He takes real
risks in his first love scene
with Elpidia Carrillo.) If he
could only find a new walk —
he's been using that swaying
swagger since American
Gigolo — he'd be a much better
actor.
