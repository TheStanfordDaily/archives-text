# 'The Big Chill' evokes no warmth

### STEVE VINEBERG 
You can tell how clever The Big Chill thinks it is
from the opening scene. In a montage, all the prin
cipal characters — 1960s tolks, now in their 30s — learn
of the suicide of a college friend, while the
Creedence Clearwater Revival rendition of "I Heard It
Through the Grapevine" plays on the soundtrack
and, intercut with their reactions, unidentified
hands dress the corpse.
The problem is that most of the shots don't tell us
anything about these people or how they felt about
the dead man, and there are so many close-ups ot
lips and legs and fingers that we seem to be watch
ing a commercial for cosmetics. And Carol Lit
tleton's jazzy editing, which turns a corner on esen
beat, suggests a rock video for a CCR revival. The
combination of slickness and sexiness — the hands
sers icing the male corpse are unmistakably female
is peculiarly disturbing: is the director, Lasvrence
Kasdan, advertising suicide?
The answer, of course, is that Kasdan, svho svrote
Raiders of the Lost Ark and Return of the ledi, and
made his directorial bowsvith Body Heat, can't make
a movie of real substance, even svhen he turns to a
subject as close to him as the middle-aged crises of
the children of the '60s. The Big Chill, which he
wrote with Barbara Benedek — the title reters to the
cold world the characters have all had to contront —
presents its credentials svhen the college chums ga

ther tor the post-funeral reception and one ot them

That line is well delivered by lett Goldblum, but

depth vou can expect ttom Lawrence kasdan. (I
wonder it Mars Kas Place eve asked Kasdan to ex

sears.)
The Big Chill teature> some tantastic cuts b\ The
Band, Aretha Franklin. Smokes Robinson The Rol
ling Stones and others and that s about all you're
likeh to remember trom it because the musical se
lections not onlv determine the editing but also
detine the content ot each scene A losemaking se
quence is scored to A Natural Woman (Aretha),
and when Wars Ka\ Place talks on the phone to
Kevin Kline and Glenn Closes little girl, we hear
When a Man Loses a Woman Peres Sledge) as
Close looks at n me whom — wequickly

surmise — she intends to enlist as the father ot Place's
child.
In this movie about the triumph ot friendship over
the scariness ot the world outside, the women are all
warm and maternal and a little dopey (except the
dead man's 2 1-year-old girl triend, plaved bv Meg
TilK w ho-as a representative ot the '80s generation
is a space cadet with no apparent reserves ot sensi
ti\it\ and no intellect), and the ultimate sacrifice to
propagate the '60s spirit is Mother Close's letting her
husband sleep with her best friend so that she, too,
can become a mother.
\ot surprisingly, the men in the film tend to give
better performances than the women (they aren't
stuck in maternal roles), even though Glenn Close
and Meg Tillv and Joßeth Williams have illustrated
their talents in other films. Tom Berenger (as a Tom
sellet k-stvle TV' star) and Kevin Kline (without his
moustache) are generally undistinguished, but
William Hurt gives some unusual line readings and
has one unsettling scene in which he roasts his
comrades' maudlin attitude about their past. And
left Goldblum transcends the film's one-liner men
tality and makes Michael, the People Magazine
reporter who's only semi-committed to his New
Wave image, a genuine creation. The Big Chill may
look like a two-hour movie version of a rock album
cover (even the photography, by the usually ex
traordinary lohn Bailey, has a Saran Wrap imper
sonality), but Goldblum keeps leaping out of it into
the world.
