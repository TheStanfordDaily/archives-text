You mav or may not like The
Big Chill when you see it, but

as with e\er\ production,
much ot someone's thought
and etfort has gone into it.
This is the film which director
Kasdan has wanted to make,
where the characters embody
aspects and historical
perspectives of the writers

(Kasdan and Barbara Benedek)
and their time.
The most striking aspect of
the movie is its music, Kas
dan's wife, Meg, was the
music consultant for The Big
Chill. "As Larry was develop
ing the script, Meg compiled
tape after tape of all the best
songs of that period," said
producer Shamberg, "You
know, I can play a song and
you can remember exactly
where you were when you
first heard it, like in the film.
So the songs were very
evocative."
As far as getting the songs,

said Shamberg, "There were
some tricky things because we
had a fixed amount of money
in the music budget. So we
negotiated with Motown for
songs which weren't often
used in films."
The Big Chill barkens, in
many respects, back to films
such as Return of the Secaucus
7 or to Diner, in the sense that
it is an "ensemble" film.
"Obviously," said Kasdan,
"you're going to get
similarities anytime you bring
a group of people together as
an ensemble." The eight ac
tors and actresses have

relatively equal parts.
But the unusualness of The
Big Chill is in the way Kasdan
prepared his ensemble of
eight; the rehearsal time was a
month, an uncommon span.
"I'm a great believer in rehear
sal," Kasdan asserted, "No
matter how much enthusiasm
the cast brings to it and no
matter how much they like the
script, this gives them a
chance to talk about it, what
they think is in it, how they're
responding to it."
Before production actually
began, the cast spent more
than five hours on location,

staying in character the entire
time and being compelled to
identity with their own charac
ters in relation to the others.
All this effort goes toward
what Kasdan calls "tone,"
which shapes every line and
mood. Politics long-gone and
suicide are really on the cir
cumference in 77)e Big Chill,
encompassing as the bond
which draws these friends to
gether, but no longer central
to their lives. "Everything is
aimed to make that tone," said
Kasdan, "of indulgence and
sense of irony."
