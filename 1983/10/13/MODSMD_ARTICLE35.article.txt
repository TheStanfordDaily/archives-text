# Scholars discuss KAL downing ramifications
## 
### MARC JEFFERSON 
Soviet experts here say they see an
attempt by Soviet Communist Party
leaders to distance themselves from
the military in the wake of the
downing of Korean Air Lines flight
007.
Yet nearly all say there is no major
schism developing between the
party and the military, despite
recent rumors from Moscow.
Rather, they say, there may be some
minor tension between the two due
to the circumstances surrounding
the incident.
The Soviet military is getting in
trouble for its incompetence, accor
ding to the experts, not for simplv
having shot down a civilian aircraft.
The Far Eastern Air Defense Com
mand had a great deal of trouble
tracking the Boeing 747 and wasn't
able to intercept it until it had nearlv
escaped into international waters.
It is believed that a number of
people in the air defense command
have been demoted or otherwise
punished.
David Holloway, a visiting scholar
at the Hoover Institution and an ex
pert on the Soviet military, says he
suspects that "people lower down
in command are in trouble.' This is
because the military was unable to

intercept the airliner earlier and
failed to make a proper identitica
tion of the 747, he said.
Political Science Prof. Condoleez
za Rice said she feels the downing of
the aircraft "was not a calculated ac
tion. ' but followed from rules of en
gagement that had been set up after
a similar breaching of Soviet
airspace bv another Korean airliner
in 1978.
In that incident, another Korean
airliner flew off course into Soviet
airspace for several hours before it
was attacked by a Soviet fighter
plane and forced to make an emer
gency landing in which two were
killed and a number of others were
injured.
Soviet Air Defense generals said
then that rules of engagement
stating that unidentified aircraft
flying over sensitive airspace were
to be intercepted were necessary.
Rice said the military "is not get
ting in trouble because the politics
are difficult, but for doing (a bad
job)" and the messy political situa
tion that the incident caused only
made things a bit worse.
The important thing, however, is
that it shows the incompetence of
the Soviet military," she said.
