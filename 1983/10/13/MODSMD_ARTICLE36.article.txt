# CROW series focuses on love and ideology
## 
### CATHY JANUS 
An assistant sociology profes
sor spoke yesterday on
"Ideologies of Love" in the
second lecture in a series
sponsored by the Center for Re
search on Women.
The noon lecture, given by
Asst. Prof. Ann Svvidler to a
predominately female audience,
addressed the meanings of love
in Western culture and particu
larly in American literature.
"It is in the quest for love,"
Swidler said, "that one realizes
his or her potential. The quest for
love is portrayed as ennobling.
"The vision of love is more
than one of passion; it is moral
achievement," she said.
Svvidler referred to a variety of
novels and films when speaking
on the ideologies of love in
American societv.
"It is a particularly American
myth that men have to get tricked
into marriage. Men have women
thrust upon them; women fall on
men in buses, they get pregnant
. . . you probably don't remem
ber what it took Daisy to get L.il
Abner to marry her? A lot!"
In the pursuit of love, she said,
you have the ability to choose
who you love. "There is a tension

between the individual and soci
etv. You fight against social con
straints and love someone in
spite of any disapproval that may
accompany it due to your loved
one's social disabilities. You love
in an unconventional way.
"There is a private myth that

people must pick someone im
probable They light against soci
ety, i.e. family or friends' disap
proval.
"Bv c hoosing what you believe
is important in life, your charac
ter is fully developed. In your
quest for love, you can be an

automomous individual, a moral
character with integrity . Vou
resist, and in the same act, join
society.
"Your own integrity," she said,
"is proven by choosing and light
ing every obstacle even if, as in
The Graduate, it is traffic on the
Bay Bridge."
"The woman is the social des
tiny and the man is the ac hiever,"
she said. "Critical to American
society is that individuals don't
want to settle down. This attitude
is exemplified in the view of the
cowboy, rifling into the sunset
while his loved one begs him not
to leave her.
Women don't want to accept
the classic role anymore, nor can
they succeed bv becoming cow
girls, Swidler said. "The threat of
this is ending up with nothing for
anyone. Men and women must
fight for humanizing, feminizing
and moralizing the social realm.
"The burden of creating a so
cial life must be shared by men
and women. Men must accept
some of the roles which were
traditionally the woman's," she
said.
The lecture series, on the topic
of "Love and Work," will con
tinue through Nov. it).
