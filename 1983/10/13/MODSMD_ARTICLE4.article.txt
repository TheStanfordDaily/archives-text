# PA election: campaign sign controversy and an Egyptian god
## 
### SAM DELSON 
This year's Palo Alto City Council campaign features a
crowded field of 13, a court battle between the city and
a candidate over campaign materials and a candidate
who c laims to be an Egyptian god.
But despite these unusual features, the Nov. 8 elec
tion is expected to be low-key, with a large group of
qualified contenders who generally agree on the major
issues.
Ten candidates are vying for four regular tour-year
terms on the council, while three seek to till the two
year vacancy created by the resignation of Councilman
Gary Fazzino. While the candidates differ on specific
points, most agree on the need for limiting the city's
growth.
"There are so many good candidates that some weli
qualified people may lose and I may be one of them,"
said Pat Cullen, a planning commissioner.

Much of the publicity about the campaign so far has
concerned candidate Cassandra Moore's legal battle
with the city over her campaign signs. Moore hired a
professional sign firm to hang several hundred of her
posters around the city, and Palo Alto has declared that
30 of the posters are illegally posted on public property
in residential neighborhoods â€” most of them on tele
phone poles.
She has contested the issue, claiming that the signs
are protected under the First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. On Saturday, Moore won a temporary
restraining order from Federal ludge William Ingram,
permitting her to keep the signs where they are at least
until another hearing next Tuesday.
While most of the other candidates consider the
signs a minor matter, several said they thought Moore's
injunction against the city will hurt her campaign, lack
Sutorius said Moore is "subverting" a city ordinance
and added, "that's a very odd thing to do if you expect

to earn a position of leadership." Cullen noted that
Moore is the only candidate who has refused to sign a
fair campaign practices pledge distributed by the Palo
Alto Weekly.
Moore said she intends to run a fair and open cam
paign, but she complained that the Weekly's pledge is
"the sort of time-consuming make-work project that
prevents candidates from spending time talking to the
voters."
The issues of most immediate concern to the Univer
sity community are both questions of municipal
growth. They are the proposed extension of Willow
Road to Fl Camino Real near the Stanford Shopping
Center and the planned Stanford West housing project.
Stanford West has been in a state of limbo since the
council voted unanimously in early July to impose
several conditions on its approval. The university has
said the council's conditions are unacceptable.

Many students are also concerned by the shortage of
affordable housing in Palo Alto. The city has a vacancy
rate of only 1 percent for rental units and its employ
ment level is growing much faster than its number of
housing units.
The most spirited competition this year comes in the
race for the four full terms. Incumbents Leland Levy
and Emily Renzel face challenges from several experi
enced community activists. Best-known among the
challengers are Moore, planning commissioners
Sutorius and Cullen, Palo Alto Historical Association
president Gail Woolley and Mid-Peninsula Urban Coali
tion president Stephen Player.
Levy and Renzel have both served on the council
since 1979. They both support the council's decisions
of the past four years, but they agree that the general
