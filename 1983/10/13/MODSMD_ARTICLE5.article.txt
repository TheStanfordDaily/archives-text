### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Both supporters and opponents of
the Hoover Institution and its pro
posed Reagan presidential library
complex claimed in discussion
series presentations Tuesday and
yesterday that the recent faculty
committee report on the complex
was a victory for their side, but they
agreed on little else.
1 he report, from an advisory com
mittee headed by Economics Prof,
lames Rosse, said the proposed li
brary could lie "a valuable academic
resource," that the museum would
have "little or no academic value"

and called for a different gover
nance system for the center for
public affairs, which Hoover had
proposed that it control.
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley, the most outspoken opponent
of the Hoover Institution, said he
had "little to complain about" the
report, while Hoover's acting ar
chivist Charles Palm, who served on
the committee, said the panel report
essentially approves the complex.
The discussion was divided into
two sessions. On Tuesday Manley
and English Prof. Ronald Rebholz


PROFESSORS SPEAK OUT: Professors |ohn Manley and Ronald Reb
holz discuss their opposition to the proposed Reagan library complex at
