# Library fury continues in wake of Rosse report
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Both supporters and opponents of
the Hoover Institution and its pro
posed Reagan presidential library
complex claimed in discussion
series presentations Tuesday and
yesterday that the recent faculty
committee report on the complex
was a victory for their side, but they
agreed on little else.
1 he report, from an advisory com
mittee headed by Economics Prof,
lames Rosse, said the proposed li
brary could lie "a valuable academic
resource," that the museum would
have "little or no academic value"

and called for a different gover
nance system for the center for
public affairs, which Hoover had
proposed that it control.
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley, the most outspoken opponent
of the Hoover Institution, said he
had "little to complain about" the
report, while Hoover's acting ar
chivist Charles Palm, who served on
the committee, said the panel report
essentially approves the complex.
The discussion was divided into
two sessions. On Tuesday Manley
and English Prof. Ronald Rebholz

told an audience of approximately
35 people about their parts in at
tempts to have the research arm of
the Hoover Institution removed
from campus, and about their oppo
sition to all plans of the proposed
Reagan complex except the
presidential library.
Yesterday Palm and Hoover
Senior Fellow Martin Anderson, a
former domestic policy adviser to
President Reagan, expressed sup
port for Hoover and the entire
Reagan complex in front of a smaller
audience.
Anderson said he refused a face
to-face meeting because "I'd find it
hard to debate with somebody I find
throwing false charges against the
institution I serve." Manley and
Rebholz called it "unfortunate" that

the two sides could not get to
gether.
Because the two sides never faced
off, the talks were less a debate than
a discussion. But both sides spent
considerable time challenging —
sometimes heatedly — the other's
publicly stated views.
Rebholz challenged the legitimacy
of the Committee on Hoover
formed by the Board of Trustees,
noting that three of its members,
University President Donald Ken
nedy, Board President William Kim
ball and trustee Nancy Munger of
Los Angeles are also members of the
Hoover Board of Overseers.
Instead of investigating the ties
between Hoover and the University,
as the Faculty Senate suggested, the
committee has been asked by the
Board to strengthen those ties, Reb
holz said.
"I had nothing to do with that,"
Anderson replied yesterday. He

noted that Kennedy and Kimball are
merely ex officio members of the
Hoover Board of Overseers, and
said Rebholz, by questioning the im
partiality of two of its officers, had
made "a false charge against Stan
ford University."
In relating the history of Hoover,
Rebholz and Anderson differed on
the impact of the institution on Stan
ford.
Rebholz said Hoover had provid
ed "the knowledge base" for many
current administration policies, in
cluding "tax cuts for the rich" and
reductions in social welfare spend
ing for the poor. Hoover had
become so partisan, Rebholz con
tended, that its 1981 Annual Report
"might as well have been written by
the right wing of the Republican Na
tional Committee."
Rebholz admitted that Hoover has
prestigious people associated with it
but he said that the institution's

"bias" has hurt the integrity of the
University. "The loss of (Hoover
Honorary Fellows Ronald) Reagan,
(Alexander) Solzhenitsyn and
(Senior Research Fellow Milton)
Friedman would be a pity, but that
loss must be weighed in comparison
to the damage done to the Univer
sity," he said.
In Hoover's defense, Anderson
said that the institution, which he
called an "integral part of Stanford
University," "has produced a group
of scholars . . . that's one of the
finest in the country."
On Hoover's alleged conser
vatism, Anderson said that the
Hoover staff was being judged
against the political standard of
academia, which he termed
"overwhelmingly left-liberal," and
not the political views of American
society which, he said, Hoover
reflects more accurately than do
most university faculties.
