# Faculty laments fewer black med students

The lack of extensive progress
toward increasing the number of
black doctors and medical stu
dents in the U.S. today has fac
ulty and students at the Medical
School here worried.
"I don't see anything showing
that things are getting better.
Everything points to the oppo
site," said Roy Maffly, professor
of medicine and associate dean
of student affairs.
Cutbacks in federal support for
medical education and a declin
ing commitment to civil rights
and affirmative action have made
it more difficult for black stu
dents to become doctors, Maffly
said. Ho was chairman of the
medical school's admissions
committee from 1981 to |uly,
1981.
"I think social conditions are
mirrored in medical schools," he
said.
Renewed attention has been
focused on the shortage of black
doctors after a recent article in
the New England Journal of
Medicine said little progress was
made during the last three
decades in increasing the num
ber of black physic ians.
The article said black
physicians in 1980 represented

2.f> percent of physicians in the
United States â€” an increase of only
one-halt of one percent since
1950.
The number of black students
graduating from medical school
each year declined to 763 out of
15,985 medical students in 1982
from 793 out of 14,393 medical
students in 1978, the report said.
"The four predominately black
medical schools had almost 25
percent of the black students in
the nation's 127 medical schools.
Six of the nation's medical
schools had no black students,
and 75 had a black student enroll
ment of less than 5 percent,
whereas blacks comprise 15 per
cent of the population," the ar
ticle said.
At the Medical School here, lb
black students are enrolled out of
a student body of 405. This
represents 8.8 percent of the stu
dent body. The number of
minority students has increased
slightly in the last three years.
Karriem Ali, a third-year black
medical student, attributed the
small number of Mack physicians
to a declining pool of medical
school applicants and the failure
of some medical schools to ag
gressively pursue affirmative ac
tion.
