# Faculty laments fewer black med students
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The lack of extensive progress
toward increasing the number of
black doctors and medical stu
dents in the U.S. today has fac
ulty and students at the Medical
School here worried.
"I don't see anything showing
that things are getting better.
Everything points to the oppo
site," said Roy Maffly, professor
of medicine and associate dean
of student affairs.
Cutbacks in federal support for
medical education and a declin
ing commitment to civil rights
and affirmative action have made
it more difficult for black stu
dents to become doctors, Maffly
said. Ho was chairman of the
medical school's admissions
committee from 1981 to |uly,
1981.
"I think social conditions are
mirrored in medical schools," he
said.
Renewed attention has been
focused on the shortage of black
doctors after a recent article in
the New England Journal of
Medicine said little progress was
made during the last three
decades in increasing the num
ber of black physic ians.
The article said black
physicians in 1980 represented

2.f> percent of physicians in the
United States — an increase of only
one-halt of one percent since
1950.
The number of black students
graduating from medical school
each year declined to 763 out of
15,985 medical students in 1982
from 793 out of 14,393 medical
students in 1978, the report said.
"The four predominately black
medical schools had almost 25
percent of the black students in
the nation's 127 medical schools.
Six of the nation's medical
schools had no black students,
and 75 had a black student enroll
ment of less than 5 percent,
whereas blacks comprise 15 per
cent of the population," the ar
ticle said.
At the Medical School here, lb
black students are enrolled out of
a student body of 405. This
represents 8.8 percent of the stu
dent body. The number of
minority students has increased
slightly in the last three years.
Karriem Ali, a third-year black
medical student, attributed the
small number of Mack physicians
to a declining pool of medical
school applicants and the failure
of some medical schools to ag
gressively pursue affirmative ac
tion.
"Even in its so-called
heyday, affirmative action
wasn't clearly committed to
representing minority groups
in the proper percentages,
Ali said.
The high cost of attending
medical school discourages
man> black students, leading
some to get degrees in engi
neering, which guarantee
quick financial rewards, Ali
added.
MaffK said medical schools
have only recently made
recruitment of more black stu
dents a major goal. Stanford
started its recruitment pro
gram in 1%8 after black stu
dents demanded a larger
enrollment of minority stu
dents, he said.
Because of the moderate
number of black medical stu
dents, the representation of
black physicians cannot be ex
pected to rapidly increase,
Maffly said. "You can't change
things in four years," he said.
Orhan Oz, another third

year black medical student,
said the status of minorities in
medical si hools anc| the medi
cal profession depends on tin 1
state ot the economy.
"When things are going
well, programs that have been
supportive ot minorities have
flourished. As soon as there is
an economic slowdown, the
programs are snatched awav,
Oz said.
Several students and admin
istrators said intelligent black
students are counseled
against taking rigorous
courses in high school that
would prepare them tor pre
medical and medical studies.
"They (the students) are just
lacking the necessary encour
agement from their coun
selors to go into rigorous
classes. I was very lucky be
cause I had a counselor who
made the information
available," said Shawna Pem,
a junior majoring in human bi
ology.
Stuart Burden, a senior who
also majors in human biology,
said important information
about pre-medical study and
college are often not readily

available to students at
predominantly black high
schools. "All of the tacts have
to be learned on your own,"
Burden said.
Burden, a member of the
Central Committee of the
Stanford Black Premedical Or
ganization, said his organiza
tion provides advice and infor
mation to black pre-medical
students to take some of the
tension out of being a pre
medical student.
Ah said many of his class
mates in his high school in
Detroit went to work in the
city's car factories either
before or after they
graduated. "A lot of people I
knew had the intelligence to
go to college. But they really
weren't pushed in that direc
tion," he said.
Mattly said the number of
blacks entering medical
schools largely depends on
how successful public high
schools are at preparing stu
dents for college. "And I
haven't seen much improve
ment in the educational sys
tem," he said.

the New England Journal of
Medicine said little progress was
made during the last three
decades in increasing the num
ber of black physic ians.
The article said black
physicians in 1980 represented

2.f> percent of physicians in the
United States — an increase of only
one-halt of one percent since
1950.
The number of black students
graduating from medical school
each year declined to 763 out of
15,985 medical students in 1982
from 793 out of 14,393 medical
students in 1978, the report said.
"The four predominately black
medical schools had almost 25
percent of the black students in
the nation's 127 medical schools.
Six of the nation's medical
schools had no black students,
and 75 had a black student enroll
ment of less than 5 percent,
whereas blacks comprise 15 per
cent of the population," the ar
ticle said.
At the Medical School here, lb
black students are enrolled out of
a student body of 405. This
represents 8.8 percent of the stu
dent body. The number of
minority students has increased
slightly in the last three years.
Karriem Ali, a third-year black
medical student, attributed the
small number of Mack physicians
to a declining pool of medical
school applicants and the failure
of some medical schools to ag
gressively pursue affirmative ac
tion.
"Even in its so-called
heyday, affirmative action
wasn't clearly committed to
representing minority groups
in the proper percentages,
Ali said.
The high cost of attending
medical school discourages
man> black students, leading
some to get degrees in engi
neering, which guarantee
quick financial rewards, Ali
added.
MaffK said medical schools
have only recently made
recruitment of more black stu
dents a major goal. Stanford
started its recruitment pro
gram in 1%8 after black stu
dents demanded a larger
enrollment of minority stu
dents, he said.
Because of the moderate
number of black medical stu
dents, the representation of
black physicians cannot be ex
pected to rapidly increase,
Maffly said. "You can't change
things in four years," he said.
Orhan Oz, another third

year black medical student,
said the status of minorities in
medical si hools anc| the medi
cal profession depends on tin 1
state ot the economy.
"When things are going
well, programs that have been
supportive ot minorities have
flourished. As soon as there is
an economic slowdown, the
programs are snatched awav,
Oz said.
Several students and admin
istrators said intelligent black
students are counseled
against taking rigorous
courses in high school that
would prepare them tor pre
medical and medical studies.
"They (the students) are just
lacking the necessary encour
agement from their coun
selors to go into rigorous
classes. I was very lucky be
cause I had a counselor who
made the information
available," said Shawna Pem,
a junior majoring in human bi
ology.
Stuart Burden, a senior who
also majors in human biology,
said important information
about pre-medical study and
college are often not readily

available to students at
predominantly black high
schools. "All of the tacts have
to be learned on your own,"
Burden said.
Burden, a member of the
Central Committee of the
Stanford Black Premedical Or
ganization, said his organiza
tion provides advice and infor
mation to black pre-medical
students to take some of the
tension out of being a pre
medical student.
Ah said many of his class
mates in his high school in
Detroit went to work in the
city's car factories either
before or after they
graduated. "A lot of people I
knew had the intelligence to
go to college. But they really
weren't pushed in that direc
tion," he said.
Mattly said the number of
blacks entering medical
schools largely depends on
how successful public high
schools are at preparing stu
dents for college. "And I
haven't seen much improve
ment in the educational sys
tem," he said.
The lack of extensive progress
toward increasing the number of
black doctors and medical stu
dents in the U.S. today has fac
ulty and students at the Medical
School here worried.
"I don't see anything showing
that things are getting better.
Everything points to the oppo
site," said Roy Maffly, professor
of medicine and associate dean
of student affairs.
Cutbacks in federal support for
medical education and a declin
ing commitment to civil rights
and affirmative action have made
it more difficult for black stu
dents to become doctors, Maffly
said. Ho was chairman of the
medical school's admissions
committee from 1981 to |uly,
1981.
"I think social conditions are
mirrored in medical schools," he
said.
