# Stanford Med School rates high in minority enrollment
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The Medical School here
had the fourth highest
percentage of minority stu
dents in the country during
the last academic year, ac
cording to a rating
compiled by the New
Physician magazine.
The magazine reported
that 23.4 percent — 92 stu
dents out of 405 — were
members of minority
groups in the 1982-83
school year at the Medical
School.
Minority enrollment this
year is down, however, to
21 percent.
The magazine's survey
shows that Stanford had
the largest number of
minority students among
predominantly white

schools. Morehouse,
Howard and Meharry medi
cal schools — the United
States' three predominantly
black medical schools — en
roll about 25 percent ot the
nation's black students.
Dr. Roy Maffly, who
chaired the Medical
School's admissions com
mittee from 1981 to luly,
1983, said the numbers
demonstrate the school's
commitment to recruiting
minority students.
That commitment started
in 19f>8 when black stu
dents demanded greater
representation of minority
students at the school,
Maffly said. The faculty
then agreed to slightly in
crease the size of the enter
ing class to enroll more
minority students, he

added.
The admissions commit
tee tries to contact black
prospective students by
visiting colleges and
mailing out application in
formation, Maffly said.
Karriem Ali, a black third
year medical student, said
the admissions committee
makes a concerted effort to
attract black students to the
school.
"The school changes the
director of admissions
every two or three years, so
things can change. But Dr.
Maffly was definitely very
sincere in his dedication to
maintaining as high a num
ber as possible of qualified
minority students," Ali
said.
Ali serves on the Minority
Admissions Advisory Panel.
