# Reagan complex
## Faculty Senate to discuss proposal 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Senior Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate will hold a full
senate discussion concerning the
proposed Reagan complex here "at
the earliest possible date," accor
ding to senate chair Craig Heller.
The discussion will not occur,
however, until University President
Donald Kennedy has "adequate op
portunity" to study a recent commit
tee report and more than 200 faculty
letters on the proposal.
Kennedy will submit a statement
to the senate steering committee,
which will then arrange for a senate
discussion. Heller said the steering
committee would be instructed by
this discussion as to what further ac
tion will be taken by the senate.
Kennedy also defended the com
position of the Board of Trustees'
committee on the Stanford-Hoover
relationship. He said that it is true
"in a narrow technical sense" that
the three of the five members of the
committee also hold positions on
the Hoover Board of Overseers, but
that he sincerely hoped that "no
one will try to make too much of
that."
Kennedy explained that he and
William Kimball, who are members
of that Board of Trustees committee,
are merely ex-officio members of
the Hoover Board of Overseers as
president of the University and pres
ident of the Board of Trustees
respectively. Board Vice President
Nancy Munger is the only other
committee member is on the
Hoover Board of Overseers.
However, Kennedy indicated that
the committee expand its
membership to include individuals
not on the Board of Trustees. Politi
cal Science Prof. John Manley later
said he was encouraged by these
remarks.
Kennedv said at yesterday's fac
ulty senate meeting that he is cur
rently studying the Rosse committee
report and the letters from faculty
members. He saicJ he would be
tinished "surely this quarter, pos
sibly this month."
"There is a lot of wisdom in all of
those letters," Kennedy said.
The report, which was submitted
bv an advisory committee appointed
by Kennedy and headed by Econom
ics Prof, lames Rosse, said a Reagan
presidential library "could become a
valuable academic resource at Stan
ford." But the report also said a
museum of the Reagan presidency
would have "little or no academic
value," and that a proposed policy
center should be "better integrated''
into the University, with the provost
appointing its governing committee.
A number of faculty members
voiced concern that the senate will
not have a chance to provide input
into the decision of whether or not
to house the Reagan complex here.
Kennedy said it is possible that the
Board of Trustees will make a deci
sion concerning the complex at
their next meeting in December. He
reassured the senate, however, that
there will be senate discussion
before any decision is made.
"We want to get this thing re
solved," said Kennedy. "There is no
earthly purpose in prolonging this
part of it."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz ob
jected to the steering committee's
plan to hold off senate discussion
until after Kennedy has submitted a
statement. He said the senate
should "be moving very quickly"
toward establishing its own ad hoc
committee, which would hold
public hearings on the complex.
Heller replied that the steering
committee felt that a public hearing
would be "inappropriate at the pres
ent time."
In other action, the steering com
mittee postponed discussion of its
media policy. Heller said that the
committee would meet next Wed
nesday to hear the views of individ
ual senate members, and that it
would then arrange to discuss the
policy in the next senate meeting.
