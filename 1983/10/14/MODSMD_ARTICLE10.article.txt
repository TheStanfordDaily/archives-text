# University prepares with the Fake Quake
## 
### DENNIS DOWNEY JEFF LOWENSTEIN 
Were you aware that Old
Union collapsed Wednesday
morning as the result of an
earthquake that shook the
University? Of course not, be
cause it didn't. And there was
no quake. But it there were,
officials here say they would
be prepared.
The emergency reaction
procedures enacted at Wed
nesday's Fake Ouake proved
to be successful in limiting the
potential of catastrophe in the
event of a major earthquake,
said Marvin Harrington, direc
tor of the University's depart
ment of public safety.
"In the event of a quake, we
would be cut off. We probably
won't get any help for 24 to 72
hours, and during that time
we're going to have to work
with what we have," Har
rington explained.
Reaction to the simulated
quake commenced shortly
after the "quake" hit at 10:28
a.m. Wednesday. At that time,

an emergency operation cen
ter located at the Stanford
Police Station was mobilized.
Reports poured into the com
mand center constantlv. in
forming the officers there of
the damage across camous.
Old Union was hit hardest.
Volunteer victims had to be
removed and treated, and
many of the more seriously
"injured" patients were taken
to the Stanford Medical Cen
ter for further treatment.
To enhance the authenticity
of the event a mock chemical
spill was staged at the inter
section of Eucalyptus and Gal
vez avenues. And Stanford
police were summoned to
Hoover Tower, where looters
had entered the building.
Organizers were pleased
with the overall response to
the Fake Quake. In yesterday's
critique of the event, which
concluded Earthquake
Preparedness Week, officer
Tim Hanrahan said the com
munity performed "extremely
well."
