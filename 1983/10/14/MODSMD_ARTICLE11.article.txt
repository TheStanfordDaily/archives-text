# What to do when the ground shakes
## 
### 
The key to surviving an earthquake is
keeping calm. If you know what to do when the
Big One hits, you're more likely to come
through it uninjured.
• If you are indoors when an earthquake
begins, stay there. The danger of being hit from
a falling object is much greater outside.

However, you should stay clear of windows
and try to get under a desk, table or doorway.
•But if you are outside, get into the open. Stay
away from buildings and power lines that could
fall during the earthquake.
•If you are driving a car, you should stop the
car but stay inside where you're safe from fal
ling objects.
