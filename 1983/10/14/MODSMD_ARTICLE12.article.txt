# Structural damage shouldn't be as bad
## 
### DENNIS DOWNEY JEFF LOWENSTEIN 
Twenty years ago, a major
Bay Area earthquake would
have inflicted nearly 50 per
cent damage to the Univer
sity's structural facilities.
Today, that same quake would
inflict between 6 and 15 per
cent structural damage. Fif
teen years from now, Univer
sity officials say, the damage
total would be only 3 to 6 per
cent.
According to Civil Engineer
ing Prof. Haresh Shah, the
cause for this startling prog
ress is a "very thorough, very
well thought-out program of
restrengthening. The Univer
sity identified problems and
assigned priorities."
The focal point of the
renovation process has been
the inner Quad, where the
buildings were not con
structed with earthquake
safety in mind.
To effectively earthquake
proof the inner Quad without
sacrificing aesthetic appeal,

the University completely
rebuilt the internal structure
of the buildings while leaving
the external parts in tact. By
1998, these improvements will
be uniform throughout all
parts of the campus.
As a supplement to these
precautions, the University
has purchased an insurance
policy to cover damages in
curred in the event of a quake.
The annual cost of this policy
is $480,000, but it provides $60
million dollars of coverage.
Although the policy is ex
pensive, Earth Sciences Prof.
Allan Cox said it is absolutely
necessary. "A very large quake
is a virtual certainty" here, he
said, and the question is no
longer "if." It's "when."
Because he is certain that
"the big one" will come even
tually, Cox praised programs
such as this week's Earthquake
Preparedness events. "A
major quake is certain to hap
pen," he said. "And a little bit
of preparedness can save a lot
of lives."
