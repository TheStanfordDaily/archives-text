## The
						Stanford Daily Bus goes, parking woes 
### 
The Committee on Parking and Transporta
tion's recent decision to expand the Mar
guerite shuttle bus service is commendable.
The Marguerite, although used infrequently,
provides a valuable service principally to off
campus students and faculty and staff mem
bers living in close proximity.
But the Committee fails to appreciate the
real issue concerning transportation on
campus; by improving the shuttle service they
hope to remedy the basic problem of parking
one's car. According to a Personnel Task Force
Report from last February, severe parking
problems top the community's list of griev
ances. The Committee responded by moder
nizing Marguerite. Such an indirect attack is
like repairing a stalled car by tuning up your
bike — you may be able to get by for a short time,
but in the long run the problem cannot be
ignored.
The issue is not, however, that the Commit
tee is misguided in their proposed solution.
The fact that the University plans to use money
they have gained by raising the price of parking
stickers—an 'A' stickerisupfroms7stosloo-to
fund the new Marguerite system is far more
distressing. If the University deems it neces
sary to raise parking rates, the capital should
go directly back into the parking dilemma. To
use funds raised by increased parking rates to
compensate the Marguerite is inequitable, if

not downright wrong.
Furthermore, the problem is just not this
simple. The new system inherently favors
those who live close enough to campus to take
advantage of the Marguerite. The Committee
counters that the new set-up is designed to en
courage drivers to park in an inconvenient 'C'
lot and then take the shuttle bus to the center
of campus. This is an idealistic but woefully
unreasonable argument. Regardless of eco
nomic constraints, few people would be will
ing to leave their home, drive to work or
classes, park their car, wait for the bus and ride
the rest of the way. Yet this is what the Com
mittee seems to want people to do.
The unfortunate solution —and one that must
be faced, even with reluctance — is to expand
parking facilities on campus. While we hate to
advocate gobbling up more University fields
and trees, a growing University must accom
modate its community. The potential for a
parking superstructure on campus in the near
future should be seriously considered despite
its many drawbacks.
The new Marguerite, with its piped-in music,
air conditioning, Dick Tracy two-way radios
and distinctive galloping horse logo, will be a
fine system. But to suggest that it solves the
bleak parking situation is hopelessly short
sighted.
