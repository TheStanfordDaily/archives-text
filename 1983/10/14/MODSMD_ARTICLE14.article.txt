## Res. Ed. defends alcohol policy 
### 
The Daily editorial "Reformulate alcohol policy"
(Oct. 6) suggests the Office of Residential Education
adopt a statement encouraging resident assistants to
provide both alcoholic and "equally attractive" non
alcoholic beverages at all residence parties. I do not
believe that any policy ought to encourage RAs to pro
vide alcohol at parties. Residence staffs need to discuss
and decide for themselves what responsibility they
wish to incur for providing alcohol at residence events,
given the fact that most undergrads are under 21, the
legal drinking age in California.
Res. Ed.'s current policy requires 1) that alcohol not
be the focus of residence activities; 2) that students be
presented with a real choice of alternatives so that
those who choose not to drink or to drink moderately
can do so; and 3) that equal amounts of equally attrac
tive non-alcoholic alternatives and food be available
whenever alcohol is served.
The Office of Residential Education has not moved to
prohibit alcohol use in residences and does not intend
to. We have actively encouraged that alcohol be de
emphasized at residence events and will continue to do
so.
The RAs in houses with frosh are to be praised, not
put down as in The Daily "Slo Mo" cartoon, for plan
ning creative parties. A lot of time, effort, and imagina

tion resulted in wonderful orientation parties. Just ask
the frosh. At Roble's Olympic Theme Party, students
designed their own costumes, picked team anthems,
and competed in events that anticipated and made fun
of the '84 Games. Larkin's RAs turned their rooms into
"airports" representing various areas of the country
with regional food and music.
Res. Ed. has encouraged RAs to provide students
with opportunities to discuss whether and what
amount of their house dues should be used to pur
chase alcohol. In our experience, many students who
are moderate or non-drinkers have been encouraged
to express their views when residence staff have raised
the issue at house meetings.
Res. Ed. has planned and conducted educational pro
grams for residence staff on the legal, medical and so
cial aspects of alcohol use. We have trained RAs in how
to approach a student who appears to have a drinking
problem and how to respond in emergency situations
involving alcohol.
One more point: The purpose of asking groups
sponsoring events to rename "happy" or "sherry"
hours is not to substitute one silly name for another.
The point is that names do carry meanings.
