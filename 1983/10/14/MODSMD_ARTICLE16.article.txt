# Reporting on the alcohol beat
## 
### 
Well, you all know that Res. Ed. is getting worked up
about alcohol at trosh dorm parties. Me, I read about it
in The Daily. So I decided to do an in-depth, inves
tigative report.
Now I want to make it absolutely clear from the out
set that I was motivated by the purest spirit of journalis
tic enquiry. The desire to get tanked up on free booze,
to get totally wasted, blasted, bombed, ploughed . . .
played no part in my considerations.
So I set out to infiltrate the freshman parties.
First, I had to disguise myself as an authentic frosh.
Of course, I sported a Stanford sweatshirt, inside-out,
back-to-front. But then it became more subtle: Should
I dress formally or casually? I opted for a compromise:
wearing both my tux and my flip-flops.
Next, I slipped on the green eye-shade from my You-
Too-Can-Be-An-Ace-Reporter Kit; and tiptoed round to
—- during orientation.
There sure was some party: Rock and roll booming
out the loudspeakers, kegs of beer, bottles of scotch
"Excuse me ma'am," I asked an innocent young wo
man sprawling on the lawn. "I'm a crack reporter from
The Stanford Daily. Would you be so gracious as to
inform the Stanford community of your opinion on
Res. Ed.'s alcohol policy?"
She stared at me for a minute, with big cloudy eyes,
then, noisily barfed up on my flip-flops.
"Would you care to elaborate on that statement?"
She rolled her eyes a little, and hiccupped. She mut
tered, "Hey, I'm too wasted to think."
"Don't you think it disgraceful that a freshman like
yourself should be inebriated?"
"Me," she said. "Me, I'm the RA."
So I crossed over the road to —.
That deemed even more depraved: Crowds of kids
teeteringaround dreamily, obviously blasted.
"Excuse me sir. What kind of beverage are they ser
ving you here?"
"One hell of a daiquiri."
"What do they put in it?"
"I don't know. I came from a strict Mormon family,
and this is the first time I've ever tasted the Demon
Drink."

So I asked the RA, "What do you put in the dai
quiris?"
"Oh just a mixture of fruit juices."
"Which spirit?"
"Oh no alcohol! We're very keen on the Res. Ed.
policy," he said smugly.
Well clearly my in-depth probe of freshman dorms
wasn't getting anywhere fast — so it seemed best to sur
vey the Stanford community and get a cross section of
their views.
I sneaked along to a frat house. Some guy in aG
string and and black greasepaint beckoned me in.
There was a big bare room littered with kegs with
naked men nailed to them.
"Having a . . . er. . . party?" I asked.
"We call it an Initiation," he said.
"In your considered opinion, sir, do you think that
freshmen should drink alcohol?"
"Naw!" he said, chuckling malevolently, "It's too
good for them!"
I skeetered back out, and made my way to one of the
co-ops, up on a hill. There at least, I felt sure, I would
find a more caring, cooperative atmosphere.
There was a haze of cannabis smoke; I smelled it as I
approached the house.
"Peace, sister!" I said, acting the part. "Do you think
the frosh should drink alcohol?"
She gazed at me, vacantly. "No way. Start 'em off on
magic mushrooms."
She continued to stare at me for several minutes. I
felt uncomfortable. "What is it?"
"Say, is there a guy in front of me wearing an inside
out, back-to-front Stanford swearshirt, a green eye
shade, a tux and flip-flops? Or am I imagining things?"
" Y °V.if e imagining 1 ,s,aid. ~
Now, I don't want you to think that my investigative
report was a failure, exactly. I learned several valuable
lessons. I mean, I honestly didn't touch a drop myself.
As I said at the outset, I was wholly motivated by the
purest spirit of journalististic . . . journallll . . . jourrr

wearing both my tux and my flip-flops.
Next, I slipped on the green eye-shade from my You-
Too-Can-Be-An-Ace-Reporter Kit; and tiptoed round to
—- during orientation.
There sure was some party: Rock and roll booming
out the loudspeakers, kegs of beer, bottles of scotch
"Excuse me ma'am," I asked an innocent young wo
man sprawling on the lawn. "I'm a crack reporter from
The Stanford Daily. Would you be so gracious as to
inform the Stanford community of your opinion on
Res. Ed.'s alcohol policy?"
She stared at me for a minute, with big cloudy eyes,
then, noisily barfed up on my flip-flops.
"Would you care to elaborate on that statement?"
She rolled her eyes a little, and hiccupped. She mut
tered, "Hey, I'm too wasted to think."
"Don't you think it disgraceful that a freshman like
yourself should be inebriated?"
"Me," she said. "Me, I'm the RA."
So I crossed over the road to —.
That deemed even more depraved: Crowds of kids
teeteringaround dreamily, obviously blasted.
"Excuse me sir. What kind of beverage are they ser
ving you here?"
"One hell of a daiquiri."
"What do they put in it?"
"I don't know. I came from a strict Mormon family,
and this is the first time I've ever tasted the Demon
Drink."

So I asked the RA, "What do you put in the dai
quiris?"
"Oh just a mixture of fruit juices."
"Which spirit?"
"Oh no alcohol! We're very keen on the Res. Ed.
policy," he said smugly.
Well clearly my in-depth probe of freshman dorms
wasn't getting anywhere fast — so it seemed best to sur
vey the Stanford community and get a cross section of
their views.
I sneaked along to a frat house. Some guy in aG
string and and black greasepaint beckoned me in.
There was a big bare room littered with kegs with
naked men nailed to them.
"Having a . . . er. . . party?" I asked.
"We call it an Initiation," he said.
"In your considered opinion, sir, do you think that
freshmen should drink alcohol?"
"Naw!" he said, chuckling malevolently, "It's too
good for them!"
I skeetered back out, and made my way to one of the
co-ops, up on a hill. There at least, I felt sure, I would
find a more caring, cooperative atmosphere.
There was a haze of cannabis smoke; I smelled it as I
approached the house.
"Peace, sister!" I said, acting the part. "Do you think
the frosh should drink alcohol?"
She gazed at me, vacantly. "No way. Start 'em off on
magic mushrooms."
She continued to stare at me for several minutes. I
felt uncomfortable. "What is it?"
"Say, is there a guy in front of me wearing an inside
out, back-to-front Stanford swearshirt, a green eye
shade, a tux and flip-flops? Or am I imagining things?"
" Y °V.if e imagining 1 ,s,aid. ~
Now, I don't want you to think that my investigative
report was a failure, exactly. I learned several valuable
lessons. I mean, I honestly didn't touch a drop myself.
As I said at the outset, I was wholly motivated by the
purest spirit of journalististic . . . journallll . . . jourrr
