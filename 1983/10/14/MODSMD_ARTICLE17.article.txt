# Robert Larkins: Gramps' Gripes
## SCAREU, law firm should not scare us 
### 
Once again, John Manley and
company have shot themselves in
the foot. The first incident came in a
letter to The Daily (Thursday, Oct. 6)
in which Manley criticized The Daily
for failing to inject editorial com
ments into the news.
Now, with the revelation of the
spurious legal opinion supporting
their opposition to the proposed
presidential complex, Manley and
his disciples in the group calling it
self the Stanford Community
Against Reagan University (SCAREU)
seem to have gotten more than they
bargained for: a nasty can of worms
called "political affiliation."
The logic of the opinion prepared
by Public Advocates, Inc. is absurd.
It contends that the proposed
Reagan public affairs center would
violate an amendment to the Uni
versity Charter "because of its af
filiation with a political party and a
political figure," but it conceeds "it
is unlikely that the placement of the
proposed Reagan library would vio
late the Charter."
How, you ask, did Public Adv
ocates, Inc. arrive at the conclusion
that the policy center would be
"politically affiliated" while the li
brary of a Republican president
would not?
Because their clients know better
than to challenge the wisdom of The
Daily's editorial staff who argued in
the lead editorial of Oct. 3, "The
presidential papers and documents
which would be kept in the library
could add greatly to the intellectua 1
climate of this university and to the
pursuit of valuable scholarship."
The academic merits of the entire
complex are indisputable.
It is critical to note that Public
Advocates, Inc. did not base its
opinion that the policy center would
violate the charter upon the premise
that the center would be adminis
tered by the Hoover Institution.
Rather, P.A., Inc. considers the cen
ter a no-no because it believes the
center would be inherently political.
If we are to accept this reasoning,
then we'll have to evict University
President Donald Kennedy from his
home (the Lou Henry Hoover

House), revoke the professorship of
Charles Holloway of the Graduate
School of Business (the Herbert
Hoover professor of public and
private management) and prevent
Jing Lyman, wife of former-
University President Richard Lyman,
from raising an endowed professor-

Furthermore, if we are to pursue
an interpretation of the cited
amendment to the charter as literal
as that taken by P.A., Inc., then we
will have to fire the majority of the
faculty for "entering upon the
public rostrum in the discussion of
political and other questions." I
have read the charter too. No more
political quips by professors will be
tolerated for they might be mis
construed by students as represent
ing the official position of the Uni
versity.
If SCAREU is genuinely sincere
about keeping the University com
pletely "out of politics," then they
must be willing to accept full re
sponsibility for the prohibition of
future University-sponsored appear
ance of all speakers with any politi
cal affiliation. That means no more
Angela Davis, no more Daniel El-
Isberg and no more Gary Hart. It
sure would be a stagnant academic
environment.
