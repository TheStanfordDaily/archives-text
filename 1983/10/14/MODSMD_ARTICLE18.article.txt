Protest Meyer hours
In cutting library operating hours
for all but two weeks of the quar
ter, the University again has dem
onstrated its neglect for basic stu
dent needs. With the new closing
hours, there is no longer any
suitable facility for undergraduates
open on Saturday night after 6
p.m. As "compensation" for these
lost 70 hours at Meyer, the library
will channel saved funds into addi
tional reference services.
According to the head librarian,
Liz Salzer, improvements for refer
ence services merit higher priority
than keeping a facility open for
Friday and Saturday night studying.
The vast majority of undergradu
ates seem to disagree with this
opinion, shocked by the contempt
shown by the administration for
basic student needs.
This case is not an isolated one.
The possible cancellation of the
Freshman/Sophomore Seminar
Program, generally very favorably
received by students, further
demonstrates this neglect. The

problem is not one of scarce finan
cial resources, but one of
priorities.
To make clear to the University
the magnitude of student discon
tent with the new library hours and
with the University's policy in
general, a peaceful protest is called
for at Meyer Library at 5:45 p.m.
(15 minutes before official closing)
on this Saturday, Oct. 15.

A choice on alcohol
The summer before my freshman
year at Stanford, my friends in
formed me about college life.
Besides learning that I would
spend much of my time in the
library, I also found out that I
would be drinking every night and
would be hooked on drugs within
a month. I was told that the combi
nation of college and California
was certain to make the last two
statements facts.
I arrived at Stanford a little
scared. I didn't want to spend four

years as an outcast; I wanted to be
accepted. I enjoyed drinking with
my friends in high school, but I
didn't want to do it all the time.
All these thoughts were going
through my head when I attended
my first party, one of the annual
Saturday night dorm parties during
orientation. When I went to get
something to drink I found both
alcoholic and non-alcoholic punch
The punch with liquor was almost
empty, the "alternative" looked as
if it hadn't been touched. I felt as
if I had no choice in what to drink.
Freshmen this year were luckier
than I. I applaud the RAs at Flo Mo
who chose not to serve alcohol at
their parties. If people want liquor,
they will get it, but others should
not feel they have to drink because
everyone else does.
Thanks to RAs, like those in Flo
Mo, and thanks to Residential
Education, freshmen, as well as all
students, again have a choice.
