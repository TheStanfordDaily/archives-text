Reagan establishes re-election committee
Washington — President Reagan gave the go-ahead yesterday for the
establishment of a campaign committee for the re-election of himself
and Vice President George Bush. Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), who will
head the effort, said "I have no doubt . . . that Ronald Reagan will be a
candidate for re-election."
Laxalt, the general chairman of the Republican party and the chair
man of both previous Reagan campaigns for the presidency, said he
would formally establish the re-election panel on Monday and file the
net essary documents with the Federal Election Commission.
Also on Monday, the president will sign a letter formally authorizing
the step, laxalt said, noting that "he will legally be a candidate at that
point."
Laxalt spoke to reporters in the White House
driveway after Reagan gave him the green light. The
White House press staff took pains to call attention
to his visit.
He said that Reagan would delay a full declaration
of his candidacy until the current congressional ses
sion ends, probably shortly before Thanksgiving.
Laxalt said the president felt that a formal an
nouncement sooner would tend to "impair his
credibility" by casting every step he takes and
speech he makes in a political light.
"I think that his position in delaying his final an
nouncement until after Congress adjourns is
entirely appropriate," he said.
The meeting was held yesterday specifically to
gain Reagan's approval for the formation of the com
mittee. However, the groundwork had already been
laid by the president's closest political advisers.
Israeli finance minister quits
Jerusalem — Israeli Finance Minister Yoram Aridor
resigned last night after the disclosure of a revolu
tionary plan to link Israel's entire economy to the
U.S. dollar in order to halt the spiral ot triple-digit
inflation, and to consider making the American cur
rency legal tender here.
The beleaguered finance minister handed in his
resignation at an emergency Cabinet meeting that
was called a few hours after details of the plan were
reported by the afternoon newspaper Yediot Ah
ronot, which called it"the biggest secret in Israel."
It was the first resignation from the new government
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, which assumed
power on Monday.
Disclosure of the plan brought a storm of strong
objections on both economic and nationalistic
grounds. Critics charged that the proposal would
mean surrendering Israel's ability to set its own eco
nomic and monetary policy and would make the
country even more dependent on the United States.
In a brief national television address last night,
Shamir sought to calm the public's fears and to dis
tance himself from Aridor's idea. He said he had
never seen "a plan" as such, but only recommen
dations of various experts, which he called "not real
istic."
The prime minister said no additional economic
steps are planned immediately, and he pledged that
the government would not tamper with savings
plans and other financial holdings of the public.
The Cabinet issued a communique last night
saying it had "no intention whatsoever" of even dis
cussing the Aridor plan.
In a statement following the resignation, Aridor
said publication of the plan killed any chance of its
enactment and that he had therefore concluded that
"I can no longer contribute to this government."
Yediot Ahronot and Israel Radio said the plan was
devised by Aridor and other senior government offi

cials in consultation with the Reagan administration
and with Israeli and U.S. economists. While the
Reagan administration was aware of the proposal, it
was not clear whether it took a position on it.
Protesters blockade army base
Bremerhaven, West Germany — Helmeted riot police
dragged away 255 anti-nuclear protesters yesterday,
but 2500 others blockaded a U.S. Army base and
temporarily sealed off a major German port. Some
demonstrators handed flowers to police.
The demonstration was the start of a three-day
protest against NATO deployment of new U.S. nu
clear missiles in Western Europe. It marks the start
of a series ot anti-nuclear protests scheduled around
West Germany in the next 10 days in what the peace
movement bills as its "hot autumn."
The protesters were carted away from the Carl
Schurz Barracks and adjoining Midgard Harbor,
where U.S. ammunition and supplies are unloaded.
The protesters went limp in a display of passive
resistance, while other demonstraters shouted, "Let
them go!" and chanted "We don't want your weap
ons."
Police Chief Eckart Naumann said all but 55 of the
protesters detained were released. The 55 were
identified as "troublemakers" and will be held until
the protest is over, he said.
Armored police personnel carriers were backed
by some 6000 officers, including 5000 riot police and
border guards brought in from surrounding cities to
prevent violence during the three-day blockade.
Police said the heavy security was a response to
unsigned leaflets distributed in recent weeks by
anti-nuclear activists who urged violence against the
base. But there has been no violence so far.
A U.S. Army spokesman confirmed that ground
traffic had been halted to and from the base.
Helicopters were seen landing at the base through
out the day.
The Army refused to say whether personnel had
been ordered to stay on base during the demonstra
tion. U.S. military sources earlier had said such a
"lock-in" would be put into effect at any base tem
porarily blockaded by German demonstrators.
Ships ferried shift workers to the docks, and work
inside the shipyards continued as usual, the officials
said.
Criticism of Tanaka spreads
Tokyo — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's Liberal
Democratic Party rejected yesterday an opposition
demand to vote on a resolution urging former Prime
Minister Kakuei Tanaka to resign from Parliament,
but criticism of Tankaka began to spread within both
Japan's business community and the ruling party it
self.
Despite a boycott by all six opposition parties that
stopped parliamentary deliberations, Liberal Demo

cratic leaders ot the lower house steering committee
stuck to the party's position that Tanaka, who was
convicted Wednesday of receiving a $1.8 million
bribe from the Lockheed Aircraft Corp., should
decide himself whether to step down.
The outcome of the furor and a forthcoming elec
tion tor the powertul lower house is expected to
affect the political future of of Nakasone, who ob
tains his main support within the ruling party from
Tanaka. Although Tanaka resigned from the party
when he was arrested in 1976, he remains a member
of Parliament and leads a faction of 118 Liberal Dem
ocratic members of that body, 28 percent of the
party's total.
Tanaka's declaration Wednesday, after he was
released on $1.8 million bail, that he would keep his
seat in Parliament spurred the criticism. His decision
was branded as "highhanded" and "lacking any
sense ot propriety" by members of the parliamen
tary faction headed by former Prime Minister /enko
Suzuki.
Comments by some members of the Suzuki fac
tion, which constitutes Nakasone's second pillar of
support in the ruling party, represented the lirst
break in the ranks of the mainstream factions of the
party. Factions supporting Tanaka, Suzuki and
Nakasone so far appear to be employing a strategy
of trying to wait for the furor over Tanaka to die
down on its own.
Criticism of Tanaka erupted from a large number
of Parliament members in a closed meeting of the
Suzuki faction. Without commenting on the
criticism, Suzuki reportedly ended the meeting by
urging his followers to remain unified in their ac
tions.
Victims of Burma bombing buried
Seoul, South Korea — With tears and wailing, incense
and flowers, at least 1 million South Koreans massed
under sodden skies yesterday for the funeral of 17
top officials killed in the Burma bombing. The go
vernment called it a "heinous atrocity" carried out
by Communist North Korea.
Sirens sounded across the nation on a gray, rainy
morning to signal a moment of silent tribute at the
start of the funeral in a plaza on Yoida Island in the
Han River that runs through Seoul. Among those
killed in the Rangoon bombing Sunday were four
Cabinet ministers.
"This cursed tragedy cannot be the real intention
of heaven," Prime Minister Kim Sang-Hyup told the
throng. "Incredibly, this heinous atrocity, a sin
against both God and mankind and a violation of
both the will of heaven and the conscience of man,
was perpetrated by the North Korea Communists,
who are of the same blood as we."
Following the eulogy, leaders of the Bhuddist,
Roman Catholic and Protestant churches in Korea
offered prayers and devotions. Then followed a
"dedication of flowers" ceremony that included the
placing of floral offerings and the burning of incense

before a flower-banked altar that held portraits of
the dead and government medals awarded to them
posthumously.
U.S. Marine wounded in Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — A terrorist in a speeding car
hurled a hand grenade at U.S. Marines guarding the
temporary American Embassy offices in west Beirut
yesterday evening, wounding one of the Marines.
In the northern port of Tripoli, PLO chief Yasser
Arafat led his guerrillas into the city to end three
days of street battles between Moslem and Commu
nist militias that left 75 dead and 190 wounded.
Meanwhile, agreement was reported on an
agenda for a "national reconciliation conference" in
Lebanon, and there were reports from Damascus
indicating that Syria tested new Soviet-made SS-21
missiles.
Embassy spokesman John Stewart said the
grenade was pitched at the main Marine security
checkpoint in front of the Duraford building about
7:30 p.m. (1:30 p.m. EDT).
A spokesman for the 1600-man U.S. Marine con
tingent in Beirut, Maj. Robert Jordan, said the
wounded Marine was a member of the peacekeep
ing force guarding the embassy and not one of the
State Department's regular embassy guards.
Jordan said the Marine was wounded "in the up
per left leg and ankle" and evacuated to the Marine
compound at Beirut airport where he was treated
and reported "in good condition."
U.S. Embassy offices were set up at the beachfront
Duraford building after the bombing of the U.S. Em
bassy compound, about 400 yards away, on April 18.
The bomb wrecked the embassy and killed 63
people, including 17 Americans.
Four Marines have been killed and 40 wounded in
grenade attacks and bombardments on the positions
of the U.S. peacekeepers since Lebanon's latest
round of violence began Aug. 28.
