# Disability at Stanford
## How students and the University cope 
### LAURA NELSON 
One Friday afternoon during
the fall of 1982, a student in a
wheelchair had a flat tire in
White Plaza. Because there
was no other service available,
he asked a friend to telephone
the police, who replied that
wheelchairs were not in their
jurisdiction and called a cab to
take the student home.
"Can you imagine," said El
len Hollister, president of
Stanford Disabled Students
(SDS), "trying to lift a 200
pound electric wheelchair into
the back of a taxi?"
Last year, when Stanford's
self-identified population of
physically disabled students
doubled to nearly 50, it
became apparent that the Uni
versity could no longer
respond to these situations
simply crisis by crisis, accor
ding to Hollister. SDS formed
to provide a student support
network and to catalyze an ef
fective University response to
the needs of disabled stu
dents. The organization has
made recommendations to
the University on how to han
dle the immediate situation, as
well as long-term recommen
dations.
"The school was very
responsive once they realized
the full parameters of the sit
uation. That was when the
President's Policy Group on
Programs for the Disabled was
created, and the Office of Dis
abled Student Services ob
tained an almost full-time ad
ministration with an office and
funding," Hollister said.
When Hollister, a third-year
law student, came to Stanford
two years ago, the Law School
had "given little thought to
the fact that they were going
to have a quadriplegic stu
dent. The result was that the
burden was completely on me
to assert my needs. This is es
pecially hard for a disabled
student; there's always the
fear of appearing inadequate.
I was hesitant to express my
needs, and problems that
never should have existed
became monstrous. For exam
ple, if one is to do research
and write, but can't get books
off the shelf, and the school
has no policy of helping stu

dents, then there's going to be
trouble.
"These problems are
monstrous if you don't ad
dress them; nevertheless, you
can't ignore a monster, and
when the school did respond
to my needs, they responded
beautifully," Hollister said. In
fact, the Law School could
now serve as a University
model for accommodating dis
abled students. Note-taking
procedures were set up, li
brary aid was given on a regu
lar basis, and it was arranged
so that Hollister could dictate
exams.
"The end result was that my
physical limitations were min
imized so that my energies
could be properly focused on
my studies, just like any other
student," she said.
Senior Jay Wyant, who was
born with a "profound loss of
hearing," said that he is not
accustomed to looking for or
demanding any kind of help
for his disability. "I was raised
in an environment not geared
toward the handicapped," he
said.
"From first grade on I went
to public school and never
developed the habit of
looking for aid. As a freshman
at Stanford I would go to my
professors and make copies of
their notes on my own. But
that took a great deal of time.
Now I receive free copy cards
from the University so that I
can duplicate student notes.
"A lot of services, like pro
viding oral interpreters and
note-takers, did not exist until
last year. I feel that I have had
an incomplete academic
career because I could not
hear the lectures — it takes a
very high degree of concentra
tion to purely lip read for a
whole lecture."
Wyatt estimated that he
misses probably 25 percent of
the lecturer's words. As a
result, the copy card has
become a very useful tool, and
someday he may even try out
an oral "interpreter."
The Office of Disabled Stu
dent Services (DSS) was estab
lished in 1983 to function as a
resource center for disabled
students at Stanford. Note
taking, interpreting, text
recording and reading

services can all be arranged
through DSS.
Connie Conley, a visually
impaired senior, stated, "I've
seen services for the disabled
improve over the last year; the
DSS has gotten a lot off the
ground. They are at the ear
liest stages in services for the
blind, but they have come a
long way. I used to use
Recordings for the Blind off
campus extensively; now the
DSS handles the administra
tive side of that for me."
Jim Bouquin, coordinator of
DSS, asserted that the atmo
sphere of his office is non
stigmatizing. He em
phasasized that DSS is not a
charity function, but simply
supplies information in a way
that is appropriate to disabled
individuals so that they can
devote their time to being stu
dents.

"We're very matter-of-fact
about our job," Bouquin said.
"For visually impaired stu
dents, we'll make sure their
textbooks get recorded; for
those with hearing impair
ments, we'll provide paid
note-takers and copy cards."
DSS encourages students to
take an active role in obtaining
accessibility services. For in
stance, a student with hearing
difficulties would be advised
to obtain copies of professors'
or classmates' lecture notes. If
this process is difficult or un
comfortable for the student,
DSS would act as a liaison be
tween the student and profes
sor. If a sufficient transcription
of the lecture material was un
available, DSS would then
supply a paid note-taker from
its office with the proviso that
the student would be respon
sible for monitoring the note

taking schedule and coor
dinating any special arrange
ments.
DSS also uses the student as
the expert about what types of
services need to be provided.
Stanford has spent a great deal
of money over the last four
years to make this campus
structurally accessible — but of
ten a specific area on campus
needs to be renovated to fill
the needs of a certain student.
"This year a mobility
impaired student was ac
cepted as a freshman into the
SLE program, which takes
place in Florence Moore, a
residence which posed tre
mendous access difficulties. It
was important that he live
there, however, so the stu
dent was invited to visit the
campus and attempt to work
out a functional accessibility
scheme. We used the student
as the expert, called him and
said, how will this work?' and
improved Flo Mo in time for
Autumn quarter without
draining our resources. Not all
of Flo Mo is accessible by stan
dard building codes, but it is
now accessible for the capa
bilities of this student," Bou
quin said.
Junior John Brennan, who
uses a wheelchair or crutches

but has no mobility problems
on campus, feels that acces
sibility in the dorms may be a
problem for some other stu
dents in wheelchairs. "The
University has made a lot of
improvements, but even
Storey House, which is
supposed to be their
showplace of accessibility, has
only two rooms on the first
floor and no elevator. This
shows they're not thinking of
anything except the minimum
needs to get by; they're not
considering social aspects.
When everyone gathers on
the second floor stairs at night
to talk, it's not fair to the guy
who can't get up the stairs."
According to Hollister, so
cial integration is one of the
goals of SDS, which is plan
ning parties and other func
tions for the future. "We've
had RA and frosh orientation
workshops, and we plan to
have functions in connection
with fraternities, sororities
and academic departments
such as the Human Biology
Department.
Right now a member of the
Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, Leo
Lapuerta, is working on build
ing a wheelchair ramp in his
fraternity.

"Another project which
we're working on in conjunc
tion with Residential Educa
tion is a video on Stanford
from the eyes of the disabled
student, to show that disability
is not something to be feared;
rather it offers another dimen
sion to the diverse and
stimulating student communi
ty."
Law student Drew Batavia, a
quadriplegic feels that it is es
sential for Stanford to recruit
more disabled students.
"Stanford should send out
materials on accessibility to
high schools, colleges and
schools for the disabled. An
affirmative commitment to ad
mitting more disabled stu
dents is absolutely necessary
in order to more fully in
tegrate disabled students
within the Stanford communi
ty, and thus dispel myths and
alter inappropriate attitudes.,"
he said. I believe that within a
few years, Stanford will be the
most attractive and accommo
dating campus for disabled
students in the country, and
this would be a real affirma
tion of the school's long
standing commitment to
maintaining a diverse student
body."

In fact, the Admissions Of
fice is reported to be sending
a copy of Access Stanford — the
DSS guide to campus re
sources for students with dis
abilities — to all high schools
which receive Stanford
literature. Law School repre
sentatives will also be dis
tributing the brochure on
their recruiting trips.
"The main social barrier of a
disabled student," said Drew,
"Is that you have to demon
strate that you're a person
worthy of respect, just as any
other Stanford student is

worthy of respect. This unfor
tunate barrier is shared by a
lot of minorities."
"Socially, I get along fine,"
Conley said. "Most people
feel comfortable asking me
about my disability, and I
don't mind talking about it. I
don't have a cane, so it's not
immediately apparent that I'm
visually impaired."
"People meet me not
knowing that I am deaf, then
when they try to talk to me
from behind, I may appear
rude. People often don't know
how to handle my handicap.
What some find difficult to un
derstand is that it is my hand
icap, not theirs," said Wyatt.
Bouquin summed up by

saying, "Rather than being a
tragedy, the experience of
being a disabled student at
Stanford is usually described
in terms of 'a challenge' —
ically, emotionally and intel
lectually. Stanford, I believe,
is a responsive institution,
with a genuine commitment to
addressing unique concerns
within a diverse community.
We've certainly come a king
way in accommodating the
concerns of students with dis
abilities. As an institution and
as a community, we need to
continue to eliminate barriers
in the environment, so that
disabled students on campus
can get on with the business
of being students."
