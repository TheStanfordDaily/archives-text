## No. 17 Huskies tough to beat at home Winless Cardinal heads north 
### ADAM BERNS 
Washington was supposed
to have an inexperienced foot
ball team this year. Playboy
magazine even predicted that
the Huskies would be under
.500.
But once again, Washington
coach Don James has another
talented squad up north. The
Huskies boast a 4-1 record, 3-0
at home, but James still feels
that his No. 17 ranked team is
not that good.
"Well, we're not very far
along," James said earlier this
week. "We have a nice record,
but you have to look at the ac
complishments of the oppo
nents.
"It's not that we're that
young, just inexperienced.
Our defense has not played
well."
The Huskies have beaten
Northwestern (44-0), Michigan
(25-24), Navy (24-10), and
Oregon State (44-7), with their
one loss coming to Louisiana
State (14-40).
"Don James always says that
he has the worst team in the
country," Stanford coach Paul
Wiggin said about James' pes
simistic assessment of Husky
football. "But then they come
out and win every Saturday."
While Stanford pulled off an

incredible 43-31 upset of
Washington last year to knock
the Huskies out of the tyo. 2
spot nationally, this year's
game is at Washington and the
Huskies rarely lose at home.
In fact, Washington has one
the last 14 straight games and
homeand 18 out of the last 19.
The Cardinal, 0-5 this
season, 0-2 in Pacific-10 con
ference play, has to get some
thing going on offense to have
a chance against the Huskies
tomorrow.
Senior receiver Don
Lonsinger who saw his first ac
tion of the season last week, is
expected to play a bigger role
in the offense.
"We are not getting the kind
of productivity out of our tight

ends that we got last year,"
Wiggin said. "We wanted to
get someone (Lonsinger) in
the game who could get
open."
Stanford's passing offense is
currently ranked No. 9 nation
ally in passing offense with 275
yards a game, and is first in the
Pac-10 in that category, but is
averaging only 37.8 yards on
the ground.
While the Cardinal defense
has played well this year, it will
be tested tomorrow both on
the ground and through the
air.
"They (the Huskies) have
three outstanding tailbacks
and will put us to the test,"
Wiggin said. (Jacques) Robin
son is a great running back,

and Steve Pelleur is an out
standing quarterback."
Washington's strong suit,
however, has always been
special teams.
"Washington is an interest
ing team," Wiggin said. "They
play really sound football.
They do the conservative
things very well. Where they
put wildness in there game is
in the kicking game. They lull
you to sleep and then they
come after you."
Cardinal cutouts
Backup linebacker Del Det
wiler will be out for the rest of
the season after putting his
hand through a window at a
Theta Delt party last Saturday
night.
