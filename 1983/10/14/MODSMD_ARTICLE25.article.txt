# Machtolf steps in some big cleats

### JASON COLE 
For freshman Mark Machtolf, there
may never be a day in his college
career when he doesn't don cleats for
the Cardinal.
With sophomore Del Detwiler
injured for the remainder of the
season, Machtolf has moved up to co
backup middle linebacker with sopho
more Mark Andrew.

In addition, Machtolf is one of Stan
ford's top baseball prospects,
projected to play either third base or
catcher.
Thus, with Stanford football ending
in mid-November and baseball begin
ning in January, the only Christmas
special that Machtolf, who is from
Spokane, Washington, watches could
be "The Grinch who stole second

base."
"I'll have a lot of catching up to do.
fhey (the baseball team) have been
practicing since before school started.
I'll just do what I can and see where
they want me to play," said Machtolf.
The two-sport athlete is certainly
nothing new to Stanford sports. Quar
terback Steve Cottrell is also a pitcher
on the baseball team, defensive end
Veris is also a member of the
■pack team, and former students John
□way, Mike Dotterer and Phil Wilson
al o played two sports while they were
lla* Stanford.
■ But even among those athletes, with
lithe exception of Elway, few of them
Rhave had such tremendous demands
pi placed upon them during their fresh
|-nun year.
w Although Machtolf may not start in

either sport, he will certainly be ex
pected to contribute a great deal in
each.
At middle linebacker, a position
coach Paul Wiggin has called "pivotal"
to the defense's effectiveness, Mach
tolf is responsible for making the calls.
"There's a lot of pressure in the middle
because you have to make sure
everybody in lined up correctly and
you have to make the checks," Mach
tolf said.
On the baseball diamond, Machtolf
will be expected to make up for some
of the power lost from last year. Coach
Mark Marquess said, "We've got some
freshman, like Machtolf, who can put

the ball out. We don't expect them to
be like (Fric) Hardgrave, but if they
come along fast we'll be all right
In his final year of American Legion
baseball, Machtolf hit 11 home runs
and is confident that he'll add some
punch to the line-up. In his junior and
senior years at Gonzaga Prep High
School, he batted .468 and .458
respectively.
When asked if he thought that
playing football and baseball would be
too demanding on a freshman Mach
tolf said, "I don't think so. So tar I've
had time to study and have a good
time with my friends. It's just kind of
hectic."
