# Greek of the Week
## 
### 
Stanford Chemistry Prof. James Collman, an avid football fan, was chosen as this
week's Guest Greek. While Collman is the first Greek not to pick Stanford this
season, he had his reasons.
"Stanford has no running attack and is likely to make a lot of mistakes,'' Col
lman explains.
Evidently, Collman does not feel that the Stanford football team has the right
chemistry to beat Washington tomorrow.
