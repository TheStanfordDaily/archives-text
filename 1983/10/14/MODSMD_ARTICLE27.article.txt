# Last year Stanford 43, Washington 31
## 
### SID SPAETH Nov. 1, 1982 
Stanford abandoned its star
system and rebounded from
two disastrous opening drives
that nearly dumped the game
in Washington's triek-or-treat
bag to upset overwhelmingly
the undefeated No. 2 Huskies
43-31.
The Cardinal offense,
masquerading itself for the
first time this year, mixed the

run and the pass effectively to
roll up 4i7 yards. Mike Dot
terer rushed for 106 vards and
two touchdowns, while John
Elway completed Â£0-of-*0
passes for 265 yard l - and two
touchdowns.
Vincent White redeemed
himself after a fumble on thp
first play of the game f>\ scoot
ing 76 yards with a magical
punt return touchdown late in
the game to sew up 'he win.
