## Spikers take on No. 4 USC 
### TOM MOORE 
Though Tuesday night's home victory over
UC-Berkeley was a non-conference win, the
Cardinal women's volleyball team took sole
possession of first place in the WCAA last night
courtesy of the UCLA Bruins, who upset previ
ously undefeated and No. 4 ranked USC in four
games.
That match will be all the more significant for
Stanford this Sunday at 3 p.m. when it takes on
the 5-1 Trojans. A Cardinal victory will put the
spikers in a commanding position in the con
ference race.
Before the matchup, however, the Card goes
for its 10th win in a row tonight at 7: iO p.m.
against Cal-State Fullerton in Maples Pavilion.
Though Fullerton owns a dismal 0-5 WCAA
mark, Cardinal Assistant Coach Don Shaw cau
tioned against overconfidence. "CSF is not a
team to be taken lightly," he warned. Shaw
didn't appear overly concerned about the
outcome though. "We'll just concentrate on
our side of the net," he said, "and try to play as
well as we have been."
Shaw stressed the importance of the USC
game Sunday. The No. 4-ranked Trojans rely on
a 5-1 attack in which one primary setter is
utilized. The USC team places heavy emphasis
on its outside hitters. Shaw hopes to counter
their attack with a "really solid team game."
One major advantage the Cardinal takes into
Sunday's match is bench strength. Senior
Brandace Hope and junior Bobbi Broer have
I been providing Stanford with tough blocking.
