### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
Students upset with the recent reduction in weekend
hours at Meyer Library are planning a sit-in protest
tomorrow night..
"Our complaints include the whole policy the Uni
versity has taken towards undergraduate needs.,"
protest organizer Senior Mike Stryer said. "Students
should have an available place to study Friday and Sat
urday nights â€” cutting hours leaves no suitable place.
Stryer said he expects between 150 and iOO students
at the protest tomorrow.
Meyer Head Librarian Elizabeth Salzer said she had
hoped for "more constructive means" than a sit-in to
deal with student discontent, but that she welcomes
student interest in other forms.
"I am sympathetic with students who need to have a
place to study," she said. "This is not an irreversible
decision, and does not rule out restoring original li
brary hours."
Salzer, who said she had not heard about the protest
until contacted by the Daily, said she had not decided
how she will deal with the protesters.
The controversial reduction in hours to 10 p.m. on

Fridav and () p.m. o i Saturday has lett undergraduates
without a place to study on weekend nights. Last year
the library stayed o en until 12 p.m. both nights.
On Tuesday, >112 ASSU voted to investigate the
change to determine if the the cut-back of rt hours each
week was a "fair tradeoff" for about 14 additional hours
during Dead Week.
Salzer explained the policy as an attempt to meet
student needs bv reallocat ng "scarce human re
sources" from a low use period, to a period of high
demand, namely extended hours during Dead Week.
"Everyone has agreed we made this change with the
understanding that it was reversible," she said.
Stryer said that the results of an informal survey he
conducted indicated that diverse groups of students
are upset with the ( hanges.
"Concern comes from both sides of the student
population not only people who want the library as a
place to study on Saturday nights, but partiers who
don't want to < reate an uncomfortable atmosphere for
people studying in the dorm," he said.
Although the original hours will not be reinstituted
by Saturday, Salzer said that they may be by the end of
the quarter.
