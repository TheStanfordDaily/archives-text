# Water Polo

### ROB ZWEIG 
After taking a second-half bath against No. 2
UCLA last Saturday, the Stanford water polo
team may be looking for a breather and a
chance to regroup.
They will get that chance today when the 6-7-
1 Cardinal travels south to tackle UC-San
Diego, a team Stanford pummeled 14-2 in the
recent Nor-Cal Tourney at De Cuerre pool.
But the Card better not rest too long because
they will be thrown back into the fire one day
later as Stanford competes in the PCAA-Pacific
10 tournament at the new Olympic pool in Los
Angeles, a tournament head coach Dante Det
tamanti calls "the toughest water polo tourna
ment in the United States today."
