The Stanford men's soccer team plays host to
the struggling Loyola-Marymount Lions today at
3:30 p.m. on Harry Maloney Field.
The Lions have not exactly had a successful
season although they do have one tie in their
0-10-1 record. Despite Loyola's one tie, Stan
ford is heavily favored in today's game.
"If I were )immy the Creek," said Loyola's
Sports Information Director Barry Zepel, "I'd
have to go with Stanford by five goals."
Nonetheless, Stanford Coach Nelson Lodge
will treat Loyola like any other opponent.
