## Marin: Mediterrean chic, hot tubs and more 
### BUFFIE EILERT 
For a great day or weekend
away from the Farm, try
nearby Marin County on the
north Mde of the Golden Gate
Bridge. You know the place,
where ritzv BMW owners sip
vintage \ino in their hot tubs
that overlook the Bay. Though
\ou could easiK tind examples
to support the stories you've
heard, the area otters more
than just Mediterranean chic.
The county, like California,
is a place ot contrast. Within a
20-mile radius of its center,
you can lie on a beach, climb a
mountain, see working lives

tock ranches, visit a
lighthouse, shop in tash
ionable boutiques or dine in
fine restaurants. If you re into
incredible views or, better \ et,
if you enjoy the out-of-doors,
the 60-mile trip from Stanford
to Marin is worthwhile.
After crossing the Bridge
from San Francisco, drive up
along the cliffs ot the Marin
hleadlands for some of the
most famous views ot the
Golden Gate and the City. Tr\
this both during the day and at
night, if it's clear. You're
bound to be impressed.
From southern Marin, there

are many options for those
who like to hike and bike at all
levels ot difficulty.
I irst, Mt. Tamalpais — Tarn tor
short — towers over laid-back
Mill Valley and, at 2604 feet,
dominates the Marin skvline.
You can drive to the top, but
you'd miss some wonderful
panoramas as well as a healthy
workout. Trails vary from
meandering strolls to vigorous
climbs.
Legend has it that an Indian
maiden lies forever sleeping
on the side of the mountain.
Look for her silhouette as you
drive on Highway 101 into

Marin. The top of Vam forms
her profile and the right side
of the mountain is her body —
really.
It you choose this locale tor
your sightseeing, you might
want to visit Muir Woods Na
tional Monument, a park that
is home for many giant red
wood trees. From this shady
place it is possible to hike up
onto the challenging Pipsea
Trail (jog it, if vou re as crazy
as the rest who do in the fa
mous annual Dipsea Race) and
then down to Stinson State
Beach. Allow a couple of
hours for this hike then

recuperate at the beach and
catch the bus back to Mill Val
ley.
Stinson, which stretches
several miles towards Bolinas,
becomes packed during the
summer, but is a relaxing
beach at anv time ot the year.
It you're a bird buff, just up
Highway I from Stinson is the
Audubon Canyon Ranch. This
nature preserve is home for
egrets and blue herons that
nest in the canyon in late
spring. Viewing areas and
binoculars allow visitors
glimpses ot the baby chicks in
action high atop the trees.
By far the largest, most
diverse and least crowded
open space area in Marin is
the Point Reyes National
Seashore. This moving "island
in time" is separated from the
mainland by the San Andreas
fault and, consequently, has
vegetation and soil quite dif
ferent from the rest of the
county. Headquarters for the
Seashore are near Olema at
the Bear Valley Trailhead
where there is current infor
mation regarding beaches,
trails, campgrounds and horse
and bike rental.
You can choose from over
100 miles of trails which may
lead you to the coast as well as
to a youth hostel or any of four
campgrounds. Tranquil,
secluded Glen Camp rests in
land as does Sky Camp which
lies near the top of Mt. Witten
berg on the Inverness Ridge.
Coast and Wildcat Camps,
which sit next to the beach,
are good bases for exploring
other points of interest along

the coast such as Limantour
Beach to the north or Alamere
Falls and its neighboring lakes
to the south. Marin's wes
ternmost tip, the point itself,
is worth a visit. Flere at the
Point Reves Lighthouse, look
out to sea and do one of three
things — enjoy the scene, look
for whales, or imagine Sir
Franc is Drake, who is believed
to have discovered Marin,
sailing past.
Another beautiful spot for
recreational activities is Angel
Island off the Tiburon Penin
sula.
This whole western part of
the countrv is ideal tor general
touring bv car, bike or even
horse. Open hills with grazing
cattle stretch for miles and
provide the setting for many
traditional Sunday outings by
the city dwellers. Nice res
taurants such as Manka's and
Vladimir's in Inverness Lodge,
Chez Madeleine in Point
Reyes Station, The Olema Inn
and Stinson's Sand Dollar dot
the countryside and offer
relaxed dining.
If you find vourself getting
caught up in a fast-paced life
at this country club county,
then Marin's open lands
should provide the sort of
release you need. If, on the
other hand, you'd like to see
some of those spots that have
given this county its trendy
reputation, stick to the three
main southern towns.
Golden Gate Ferries run
from the City to Larkspur,
Tiburon and Sausalito, and
across 101 lies Mill Valley. In
these hillside hamlets you'll

find unique boutiques,
arcades and tales that exude a
European charm with a touch
of California mellow.
From Stanford, southern
Marin is one hour away (it you
drive like I do). The weather is
close to what we're used to
here except that the tog
lingers longer in these sout
herly spots.
Finally, if you've got a few
extra bucks, cap off your stav
by dining in a Sausalito or
Tiburon restaurant that has a
Hay view. The night light sights
won't disappoint you — unless
the unpredictable fog does.
Or, it you've got some extra
energy left after your hiking,
go to one of Marin's night
spots. For the 21-and-over
crowd, here is a quick list ot
places that usually offer live
music, sometimes during the
week, too. Uncle Charlie's in
Corte Madera; Carlos
O'Brian's or FHarbor Light in
Tiburon; Sleeping lady Cafe
in Fairfax; Sweetwater in Mill
Valley; No Name Bar in
Sausalito and the Mayflower
Inn Pub in San Rafael. Also,
Baxter's at Larkspur Landing
(across from the ferry build
ing) is one of the new hot
spots for dancing.
So, who needs the wine
country when you can arrive
in the best of both worlds of
Marvelous Marin in half the
time? After all, you owe it to
yourself to occasionally
venture beyond the Farm,
right? So, get going, and don't
forget your bathing suit for the
hot tub.

ternmost tip, the point itself,
is worth a visit. Flere at the
Point Reves Lighthouse, look
out to sea and do one of three
things — enjoy the scene, look
for whales, or imagine Sir
Franc is Drake, who is believed
to have discovered Marin,
sailing past.
Another beautiful spot for
recreational activities is Angel
Island off the Tiburon Penin
sula.
This whole western part of
the countrv is ideal tor general
touring bv car, bike or even
horse. Open hills with grazing
cattle stretch for miles and
provide the setting for many
traditional Sunday outings by
the city dwellers. Nice res
taurants such as Manka's and
Vladimir's in Inverness Lodge,
Chez Madeleine in Point
Reyes Station, The Olema Inn
and Stinson's Sand Dollar dot
the countryside and offer
relaxed dining.
If you find vourself getting
caught up in a fast-paced life
at this country club county,
then Marin's open lands
should provide the sort of
release you need. If, on the
other hand, you'd like to see
some of those spots that have
given this county its trendy
reputation, stick to the three
main southern towns.
Golden Gate Ferries run
from the City to Larkspur,
Tiburon and Sausalito, and
across 101 lies Mill Valley. In
these hillside hamlets you'll

find unique boutiques,
arcades and tales that exude a
European charm with a touch
of California mellow.
From Stanford, southern
Marin is one hour away (it you
drive like I do). The weather is
close to what we're used to
here except that the tog
lingers longer in these sout
herly spots.
Finally, if you've got a few
extra bucks, cap off your stav
by dining in a Sausalito or
Tiburon restaurant that has a
Hay view. The night light sights
won't disappoint you — unless
the unpredictable fog does.
Or, it you've got some extra
energy left after your hiking,
go to one of Marin's night
spots. For the 21-and-over
crowd, here is a quick list ot
places that usually offer live
music, sometimes during the
week, too. Uncle Charlie's in
Corte Madera; Carlos
O'Brian's or FHarbor Light in
Tiburon; Sleeping lady Cafe
in Fairfax; Sweetwater in Mill
Valley; No Name Bar in
Sausalito and the Mayflower
Inn Pub in San Rafael. Also,
Baxter's at Larkspur Landing
(across from the ferry build
ing) is one of the new hot
spots for dancing.
So, who needs the wine
country when you can arrive
in the best of both worlds of
Marvelous Marin in half the
time? After all, you owe it to
yourself to occasionally
venture beyond the Farm,
right? So, get going, and don't
forget your bathing suit for the
hot tub.
For a great day or weekend
away from the Farm, try
nearby Marin County on the
north Mde of the Golden Gate
Bridge. You know the place,
where ritzv BMW owners sip
vintage \ino in their hot tubs
that overlook the Bay. Though
\ou could easiK tind examples
to support the stories you've
heard, the area otters more
than just Mediterranean chic.
The county, like California,
is a place ot contrast. Within a
20-mile radius of its center,
you can lie on a beach, climb a
mountain, see working lives

tock ranches, visit a
lighthouse, shop in tash
ionable boutiques or dine in
fine restaurants. If you re into
incredible views or, better \ et,
if you enjoy the out-of-doors,
the 60-mile trip from Stanford
to Marin is worthwhile.
After crossing the Bridge
from San Francisco, drive up
along the cliffs ot the Marin
hleadlands for some of the
most famous views ot the
Golden Gate and the City. Tr\
this both during the day and at
night, if it's clear. You're
bound to be impressed.
From southern Marin, there

are many options for those
who like to hike and bike at all
levels ot difficulty.
I irst, Mt. Tamalpais — Tarn tor
short — towers over laid-back
Mill Valley and, at 2604 feet,
dominates the Marin skvline.
You can drive to the top, but
you'd miss some wonderful
panoramas as well as a healthy
workout. Trails vary from
meandering strolls to vigorous
climbs.
Legend has it that an Indian
maiden lies forever sleeping
on the side of the mountain.
Look for her silhouette as you
drive on Highway 101 into

Marin. The top of Vam forms
her profile and the right side
of the mountain is her body —
really.
It you choose this locale tor
your sightseeing, you might
want to visit Muir Woods Na
tional Monument, a park that
is home for many giant red
wood trees. From this shady
place it is possible to hike up
onto the challenging Pipsea
Trail (jog it, if vou re as crazy
as the rest who do in the fa
mous annual Dipsea Race) and
then down to Stinson State
Beach. Allow a couple of
hours for this hike then

recuperate at the beach and
catch the bus back to Mill Val
ley.
Stinson, which stretches
several miles towards Bolinas,
becomes packed during the
summer, but is a relaxing
beach at anv time ot the year.
It you're a bird buff, just up
Highway I from Stinson is the
Audubon Canyon Ranch. This
nature preserve is home for
egrets and blue herons that
nest in the canyon in late
spring. Viewing areas and
binoculars allow visitors
glimpses ot the baby chicks in
action high atop the trees.
By far the largest, most
diverse and least crowded
open space area in Marin is
the Point Reyes National
Seashore. This moving "island
in time" is separated from the
mainland by the San Andreas
fault and, consequently, has
vegetation and soil quite dif
ferent from the rest of the
county. Headquarters for the
Seashore are near Olema at
the Bear Valley Trailhead
where there is current infor
mation regarding beaches,
trails, campgrounds and horse
and bike rental.
You can choose from over
100 miles of trails which may
lead you to the coast as well as
to a youth hostel or any of four
campgrounds. Tranquil,
secluded Glen Camp rests in
land as does Sky Camp which
lies near the top of Mt. Witten
berg on the Inverness Ridge.
Coast and Wildcat Camps,
which sit next to the beach,
are good bases for exploring
other points of interest along

the coast such as Limantour
Beach to the north or Alamere
Falls and its neighboring lakes
to the south. Marin's wes
ternmost tip, the point itself,
is worth a visit. Flere at the
