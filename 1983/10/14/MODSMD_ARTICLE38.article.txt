## Updike: good, but too much 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
''Hugging the Shore", by
John Updike, Knopf, 919 pp.,
$19.95.
â– sThe author is sufficiently fa
mous to be able to publish a
bulky collection of good, but
not really durable, book
reviews, and reasonably ex
pfec I to sell enough copies of it
to sink a flotilla of little row
boats like the one he so
cheerily occupies on the
dustcover. So what if his ves
sel goes under? He is only
"Hugging the Shore," and the
water is shallow enough for a
sate, unhurried wade to the
e's'uary bank.
if The collection does not con
sist solely of reviews. The
reader first coasts along a se
ries of splendid essays, not on
literary subjects, and still
tangy with the flavor of life on
sh ore. The best of these,
grouped as "Interviews with
insufficiently famous
Americans," have already
, been collected and published
in book form, but are
welcome here. For we soon
strike out into blue water to
traverse the wide expanse of
reviews. Fine reviews they are
-intelligent, knowledgeable,
good-humored, anxiously fair
to book and author, and with
out a trace of meanness. And
this broad sea of criticism is
enlivened by telling observa
tions and figures of speech as
bright as sunlight playing on
the waves.
But the book is like an
ocean in other ways: It is
beautiful, it is endlessly
varied, and yet it is somehow
always the same. Which would
not be so trying except that it
is so big! Before we actually
land at the back cover, it is a
relief to pass through the
pieces "On one's own
Oeuvre," in which the author
says some interesting things
about his own work, and we

are reminded of the crossing's
purpose-the author is famous,
and all his writings must be
preserved.
Seasoned academic tars may
dance a jig at the prospect of
taking an uninterrupted cruise
to get to know the author bet
ter (though they might have
been grateful if more com
plete publication information
had accompanied each piece).
But the author himself is a
Sunday sailor. He is a critic
without the articulate killer in
stinct that imparts a lasting
zest to the notices of Randall

Jarrell or Bernard Shaw, even
in collections, and he does
not use his reviews to develop
a critical theory that would
make it helpful to have them
all on hand together. His
pieces were mostly written for
the impermanent context of
The New Yorker or other jour
nals. In that fluid medium they
sail admirably above the mass
of gray water, but when as
sembled they lose buoyancy.
Newspaper boats can be
remarkably seaworthy, and
the author's ability to fold
them so well individually only

makes it more daunting to find
them flattened into the bulk of
a Sunday New York Times.
Mr. Updike, a master of
style, does write excellent
reviews that stand well on
their own. Discovering them
in a journal is like coming
upon a partiuclarly well-made
figure of speech. But follow
ing them in series, as a set of
pieces to which permanent,
substantial value is attributed,
is like trying to read an at
tempt to pursue a sustained
metaphor through an entire
piece of writing.


John Updike
