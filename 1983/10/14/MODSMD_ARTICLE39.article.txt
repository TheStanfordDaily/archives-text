### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
I he accompanying illus
tration should be referred
to immediately, for a sense
of what is going on in Greg
Constantine's "Vincent van
Gof-h Visits New York"
(Knopf, 77 pp., 64 plates,
$7.9';). Do you pick up the
references to or c itations of
artworks like Daumier's
"The I hircl Class Carriage,"
Picasso's "The Old
Guitarist," Grant Wood's
"American Gothic," and
other more or less famous
paintings?
If you did, you'll have a
wonderful time going
through the series of plates
in which Greg Constantine
depicts what happens to
Van Gogh during his stay in
the center of contemporary
American art. Your less
cultured friends may
accuse you of smug self
congratulation at your own
ability to pick up on Con
stantine's allusions, but
most of the drawings are
genuinely humorous,
despite sometimes being
too literally referential. In a
few pieces the integration
of a famous painting's com
position is so well done
that the result is genuinely
artistic, not merely witty.
Whether someone not well
acquainted with art history
will enjoy tracking down
the citations (given in a in
dex) is hard to say, but the
book is worth flipping
though in the store to find
out for yourself.
If watching a perfor
mance of the 1983 Pulitzer
Prize winner for Drama,
" Mother" (paper and
hardcover, 92 pp., $6.95 and
$13.95 respectively) is as af
fecting as reading it, sitting
in the theater must be a

harrowing experience
indeed. Hill and VVang have
now issued Marsha Nor
man's play, and the play is
one that does not depend
on actual performance for
its effect.
Ihe situation is simple
but dense: Jessie, a middle
aged divorcee, who lives
with and cares for her
healthy but apathetic mo
ther, has decided to kill her
self. The play depicts the
last hours before her
suicide. The two womens'
attempts at explanation,
persuasion, and justifica
tion are moving, and the
speeches' power is only in
creased by the way Jessie,
with appalling calm, con
tinually refers to the
mundane details of running
the household that she
must explain to her mother
so things can pursue their
ordinary course smoothly
after her death.
The two characters are
both unsympathetic
enough to produce an
alienation effect that
provokes consideration of
the morality of suicide, but
the play as a whole does
not thereby lose its impact.
Robert Fitzgerald's new
translation of Virgil's

"Aeneid" (Random House,
402 pp., $20.00) has now
been published to join his
versions of the "Iliad" and
"Odyssey," and it does not
tail to match the high stan
dards tor translation he has
already established. A cita
tion of his rendering of the
first seven lines should best
give evidence of the poetic
level attained by his
transposition of the verse
from Latin into English:
I sing of warfare and a
man at war.
From the sea-coast of
Troy in early days
He came to Italy by des
tiny,
To our Lavinian western
shore,
A fugitive, this captain,
buffeted
Cruelly on land as on the
sea
By blows from powers of
the air â€” behind them
Baleful |uno in her sleep
less rage.
And cruel losses were his
lot in war,
I ill he could found a city
and bring home
His gods to Latium, land
of the Latin race,
The Alban lords, and the
high walls of Rome.
