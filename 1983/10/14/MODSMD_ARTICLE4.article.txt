# Reagan fills Watt's position
## Clark named to Interior post 
### TIM GRIEVE With staff wire reports 
President Reagan nominated
William Clark, his National Security
-\dviser and "a God-fearing west
erner," to succeed James Watt as
Secretary of the Interior yesterday.
Calling Clark, 52, a "result
oriented professional," Reagan told
a group of Christian women leaders
yesterday that Clark will he a "great
Secretary of the Interior."
Although Reagan has named no
replacement for Clark as National
Security Adviser, it is expected that
Robert MacFarlane, Clark's deputy
and the president's special envoy to
the Middle East, will assume the
post.
Reagan's move has shocked even
some of his closest aides and an
gered environmentalists across the
country and at Stanford.
The Sierra Club, the Friends of the
Earth, the Wilderness Society and
the National Audubon Society have
all condemned Reagan's choice of
Clark.
"William Clark doesn't know any
more about national parks or endan
gered species than he did about An
gola or Zimbabwe," complained
Geoff Webb, an energy specialist
with Friends of the Earth, referring
to Clark's ignorance of several
African countries when queried at
his confirmation hearings for a state
department job.
Jennifer Kreger, one of the three
directors of Stanford for Environ
mental Education, said that the
mood of environmentalists in the
area is one of hesitation.
"They're hesitant to try and
describe why Clark was chosen, and
eveti more hesitant to assume that
he is a step up for the cause of the
protection of our natural re
sources."
Kreger said Clark's selection is
"another case of Reagan's not put
ting conservation high on his list of
his priorities."
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall, who at one time worked in
the Office of the Secretary of the In
terior, agreed.
"I think that Clark is totally un
qualified for the job, and it's simply
one more example of Reagan's ap
parent beliet that correct ideology
is the sole requirement for tilling the
highest posts in the government,"
Marshall said.
Marshall said that "unlike a lot of

posts, you can't be a good Secretary
without some knowledge of the de
partment, without having some
knowledge of the interest groups
that the department serves and that
have influence on the department."
"Clark simply doesn't have that,"
Marshall said, "and that means
serious mistakes may he made. Watt
had much more of that knowledge.
If you want to set ideology aside,
Watt was reasonably well
qualified.''
However, Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-
Nevada) said he is "confident" that
Clark will be approved by the sen
ate.

Before replacing Richard Allen as
National Security Adviser, Clark
served as a deputy under former
Secretary of State Alexander Haig
and as a California Supreme Court
judge, both Reagan-appointed posi
tions.
In some ways, however, Marshall
said Clark will be better than Watt.
"In terms of temperment and style,
he's going to be much better, just as
in terms .of temperament and style
(Secretary of State George) Shultz is
better than (former Secretary of
State Alexander) Haig."
Although the Secretary of Interior
post is generally considered less im


William Clark
portant than that of the National Se
curity Adviser, Marshall said Clark
may have actually wanted the post.
"By any ordinary judgement, this
would be a step down because the
job is simply much less important.
But if we assume that (Clark) really
feels his highest wish is to serve
Reagan's needs, then it may bail
Reagan out of a very difficult posi
tion. He is doing the most important

thing he can possibly do for Reagan
and he is accepting this job out of
loyalty."
Watt told reporters in San Bernar
dino, Calif, that Reagan's choice of
Clark "couldn't be a better appoint
ment" and called Clark a
"fantastically fine guy."
Marshall said that Reagan's likely
choice of MacFarlane as Clark's suc
cessor "doesn't mean any certain
change (in policy) but might bring a
degree of sophistication" to
Reagan's foreign policy.
