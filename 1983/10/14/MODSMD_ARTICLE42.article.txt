"The Cannibal Galaxv." b\ Cynthia Ozick, Knopf,
1 56 pp., $11.95.
C\ nthia O/k k has alwa\ s been regarded as some
thing of .i prodig\. In an essa\ published recently in
Art and \rdor, Ozick — best known for her three
books ot short stories sa\s that her model has al
\\a\s been Henr\ James. From the very beginning
her stories haw aspired to match his. Can this wo
man hit such a high standard and be the Henry
James the 1980s somehow seem to need?
Fht> magazines think so. Magazines like prodigies.
Atter all, they make good culture heroes.
And now. with The Cannibal Galaxy' -hersecond
novel Ozick has vv ritten a book about a prodigv who
becomes a culture hero. The response has been im
nediate and adulators Time magazine savs she is
most important and prints a photograph ot her.
Life imitates art.
But is O/ick reallv imitating Henrv lames? T.S.
Eliot said of lames, "He had a mind so tine that no
idea could violate it. Ozick has a mind about which
one certainK cannot sa\ the same thing. "The Can
nibal Galaxv is a novel of ideas in the New York
I iterar\ Crowd tradition of which Saul Bellow is per
haps the hugest example. Important social concerns
are treated here seriously and explicitly. Have lews
given too much weight to the Holocaust's legacy?
How do we educate our voung and nurture the
talented!" What makes a good parent? What makes a
world good? Wh\ does ours suck? And so forth.
The Cannibal Galaxy's" dustcover, more than
an\ other I've seen, makes it practically unnecessary

to go through the pages inside. The "ideas" within
are so detachable, and the rigidly moral construc
tion of the book so predictable, so inexorable, that a
short paraphrase leaves virtually no novel left to
read.
Ozick tells the story ot Joseph Brill, a middle-aged
French lew who spends World War II hiding in a
convent basement. After the war, he gives up his
wish to become an astronomer (read: no more
reaching tor the stars) and comes to the American
Midwest (very sublunary) where he founds a school
based on a "fusion of scholarlv Europe and bur
nished Jerusalem... astronomers and God-praisers
uniting in a majestic dream of peace." But his new
dream is disappointing; his quest to find a prodigy is
a failure. His 40 years as principal have him witness
an amazingly constant stream ot mediocrity, where
"year after year it was the same, the first-graders so
tender-mouthed and little, the eighth-grade girls ex
ploded into puberty, the candle-tips of their breasts
putted up beneath their white dresses in the long
procession down the glowing hill; spring after
spring after spring. Nothing moved, nothing al
tered."
The straight line of his life hits a slippery curve
when he meets Hester Lilt, a famous philosopher,
whose glum daughter Beulah is enrolled in his
school. But Beulah, of course, is a prodigy whom
neither her mother nor Joseph can recognize. And
when, several years after she graduates, she
becomes a brilliant artist-theorist in Paris, the
(ahem) TRUE NATLJRE of loseph's failed life dumps
on him like a lovcean epiphany. But you already

know it will. Vou know most ot this narrative before
it happens. Of course Joseph's adopted son, the off
spring of his mere secretary, ends up a stupid me
chanic in Hamilton, Canada (even farther away from
the stars!), while Joseph's own son, after showing
huge promise, becomes a philistine studying busi
ness administration at the University of Miami.
To be sure, Ozick's prose is superb. She has Bel
low s cleverness and musical ear but none of his
selt-congratulatory bluster. A passage of typical
cleverness: "For (Brill) the cosmos was always in
human, of terrible coldness, and far away, even
though one lived in its midst. For (Hester) it was a
long linger tapping." Other instances show,
however, that her insistent moral objective subvert s
the story's form. More than once, Ozick abandons
her narrative strategy of telling the storv through
Brill s mind in the third person, and attempts to raise
our indignation at his essential wrongness to even
more highlv calculated extremes.
This kind of jarring fault is perhaps what makes
the world of literary journalism like Ozick so much.
She is absolutely clear that she tells stories that need
to be told in this "dangerous" age. But her message
has reduced itself to this: It sure is good to be good.
Ozick, along with a strutting bookishness, also
shares with Bellow that facile condescension
towards her characters which acts to include the
reader in a class (or classroom) of superiority. An
Ozick reader, in other words, has no problem
wading through lots of academic quotations. We are
curious and self-aware and never as stultified as
those we read about.

to go through the pages inside. The "ideas" within
are so detachable, and the rigidly moral construc
tion of the book so predictable, so inexorable, that a
short paraphrase leaves virtually no novel left to
read.
Ozick tells the story ot Joseph Brill, a middle-aged
French lew who spends World War II hiding in a
convent basement. After the war, he gives up his
wish to become an astronomer (read: no more
reaching tor the stars) and comes to the American
Midwest (very sublunary) where he founds a school
based on a "fusion of scholarlv Europe and bur
nished Jerusalem... astronomers and God-praisers
uniting in a majestic dream of peace." But his new
dream is disappointing; his quest to find a prodigy is
a failure. His 40 years as principal have him witness
an amazingly constant stream ot mediocrity, where
"year after year it was the same, the first-graders so
tender-mouthed and little, the eighth-grade girls ex
ploded into puberty, the candle-tips of their breasts
putted up beneath their white dresses in the long
procession down the glowing hill; spring after
spring after spring. Nothing moved, nothing al
tered."
The straight line of his life hits a slippery curve
when he meets Hester Lilt, a famous philosopher,
whose glum daughter Beulah is enrolled in his
school. But Beulah, of course, is a prodigy whom
neither her mother nor Joseph can recognize. And
when, several years after she graduates, she
becomes a brilliant artist-theorist in Paris, the
(ahem) TRUE NATLJRE of loseph's failed life dumps
on him like a lovcean epiphany. But you already

know it will. Vou know most ot this narrative before
it happens. Of course Joseph's adopted son, the off
spring of his mere secretary, ends up a stupid me
chanic in Hamilton, Canada (even farther away from
the stars!), while Joseph's own son, after showing
huge promise, becomes a philistine studying busi
ness administration at the University of Miami.
To be sure, Ozick's prose is superb. She has Bel
low s cleverness and musical ear but none of his
selt-congratulatory bluster. A passage of typical
cleverness: "For (Brill) the cosmos was always in
human, of terrible coldness, and far away, even
though one lived in its midst. For (Hester) it was a
long linger tapping." Other instances show,
however, that her insistent moral objective subvert s
the story's form. More than once, Ozick abandons
her narrative strategy of telling the storv through
Brill s mind in the third person, and attempts to raise
our indignation at his essential wrongness to even
more highlv calculated extremes.
This kind of jarring fault is perhaps what makes
the world of literary journalism like Ozick so much.
She is absolutely clear that she tells stories that need
to be told in this "dangerous" age. But her message
has reduced itself to this: It sure is good to be good.
Ozick, along with a strutting bookishness, also
shares with Bellow that facile condescension
towards her characters which acts to include the
reader in a class (or classroom) of superiority. An
Ozick reader, in other words, has no problem
wading through lots of academic quotations. We are
curious and self-aware and never as stultified as
those we read about.

C\ nthia O/k k has alwa\ s been regarded as some
thing of .i prodig\. In an essa\ published recently in
Art and \rdor, Ozick — best known for her three
books ot short stories sa\s that her model has al

her stories haw aspired to match his. Can this wo
man hit such a high standard and be the Henry
James the 1980s somehow seem to need?
Fht> magazines think so. Magazines like prodigies.
Atter all, they make good culture heroes.
And now. with The Cannibal Galaxy' -hersecond
novel Ozick has vv ritten a book about a prodigv who
becomes a culture hero. The response has been im
nediate and adulators Time magazine savs she is
most important and prints a photograph ot her.
Life imitates art.
But is O/ick reallv imitating Henrv lames? T.S.
Eliot said of lames, "He had a mind so tine that no
idea could violate it. Ozick has a mind about which
one certainK cannot sa\ the same thing. "The Can
nibal Galaxv is a novel of ideas in the New York
I iterar\ Crowd tradition of which Saul Bellow is per
haps the hugest example. Important social concerns
are treated here seriously and explicitly. Have lews
given too much weight to the Holocaust's legacy?
How do we educate our voung and nurture the
talented!" What makes a good parent? What makes a
world good? Wh\ does ours suck? And so forth.
