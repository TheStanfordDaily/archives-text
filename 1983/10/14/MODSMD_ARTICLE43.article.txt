Sir Alfred (Rex Harrison): I doubt that
you played Russian roulette all the time
with your father!
Daphne (Linda Darnell): Oh, I most cer
tainly did. You play it with two packs of
cards...
Sir Alfred: That is Russian Bank. Russian
roulette is a very different amusement
which I can only your father had played
continually before he had you.

Unfaithfully Yours (1948) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Perhaps the best way to
describe this masterful ironic
comedy, written and directed
by Preston Sturges, is to pro
pose that if Noel Coward and
Luis Bunuel had collaborated,
they might have produced
something like this. A conduc
tor — of whom an admirer en
thuses, in a typical Sturges
epigram, "Nobody handles
Handel better than you handle
Handel" — decides that his
beautiful wife has been un
faithful to him, and he dreams
of revenge in fantasy scenes
scored to the music he con
ducts (Rossini's "Semiramide
Overture," Wagner's
"Pilgrims' Chorus," and
Tchaikovsky's "Francesca da
Rimini"). As the jealous hus
band, Rex Harrison gives a vi
brant, precise performance
that is surely his best, and his
wife is played by one of the
most breathtaking stars of the
era, Linda Darnell. Among the
Sturges regulars who show up
are Rudy Vallee, Lionel
Stander, Edgar Kennedy, Al
Bridge, Julius Tannen, Torben
Meyer and Robert Greig.
Plays Thursday with The
Miracle of Morgan's Creek.
The Miracle of Morgan's
Creek (1944) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Preston Sturges gem
gets funnier and funnier as it
runs on; the last 20 minutes
are as good as anything in
American comedy. Betty Hut
ton plays a young woman who
must find a father for her
forthcoming child, and she
picks a dupe who adores her:
Eddie Bracken, whose ner
vous, jangling, adrenalin
pumped personality is perfect
for a Sturges picture. This un
derhanded ploy is all the idea
of Hutton's devious, hard
edged kid sister (Diana Lynn),
who advises her, "He was
made for it - as the ox was made
to be eaten." With William
Demarest, Porter Hall, Brian
Donlevy and Akim Tamiroff (in
the roles they played in
Sturges' The Great McCinty
four years earlier), and Julius
Tannen, Al Bridge, Vic Potel,
Torben Meyer, Jimmy Conlin,
Chester Conklin and assorted
other Sturges folks. Even the
names are memorable in this

film: Hutton and Bracken play
Trudy Kockenlocker and Nor
vel Jones.
Plays Thursday with Unfaith
fully Yours.
Casablanca (1943) ★
Kresge Auditorium
In some theaters, when this
movie is shown, audiences
bring wine to toast the
"Marseillaise" scene and
everyone knows all the famous
lines, from"I stick my head
out for nobody" to "Louis, this
could be the start of a beautiful
friendship." Humphrey
Bogart, at his most romantic,
plays Rick, who owns a cafe in
wartime Casablanca; Ingrid
Bergman, at her most beautiful,
is Use, who deserted him in
Paris and now walks into his
clu' j with Paul Henreid, who
plays Victor Lazlo — the Resis
tance leader the Nazis can't
stop. Dooley Wilson, Peter
Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet
are in it, and so is "As Time
Goes By;" it won the Academy
Award for Best Picture. Of
course, nobody really believes
a word of it, but who cares? It
is one of the most wonderfully
appealing bad movies ever to
come out of Hollywood. Mi
chael Curtiz directed; the
script is by Howard Koch.
Plays tonight.
My Dinner with Andre
(1981)
Cubberley Auditorium
Some people see this picture
— a collaboration by Louis Malle
(director), Andre Gregory and
Wallace Shawn (co-authors
and players) —as a profound es
say on the impossibility of con
nection in our time; it's not,
though it is a reasonably ab
sorbing comedy, and proof, if
we needed it, that a movie
need be no more than a two
hour dinner table dialogue.
Andre Gregory doesn't have
the kind of face a camera can
really explore, but Wallace
Shawn does: amazingly fron
tal, his brow permanently
furrowed and his eyes
narrowed as if he'd spent his
life trying to figure out what
the hell was going on around
him. His piping, hilarious
abrasive voice flies up into the
rafters when he becomes
excited, and he races through

his words. You may find him
more appealing than Gregory
(who is a well-known avant
garde director and disciple of
Jerzy Grotowski's Polish
Theatre Lab).
Plays this evening.

Gandhi (1982)
Memorial Auditorium
A three-and-a-quarter-hour
soporific. Richard Atten
horough doesn't have the right
qualities tor epic filmmaking;
furthermore, out of either a
lack of personal resources or
an ascetic refusal to vulgarize
Gandhi's story, he resists tur
ning it into theater. And in the
process of purifying it of his
torical lumps, he has buried
much essential factual infor
mation and obfuscated the is
sues. Ben Kingsley brings a fas
cinating mixture of under
stated passion and unpredicta
ble wit to the title role — he
humanizes the icon John
Briley's homiletic screenplay
sets up — but the rest of the cast
(John Gielgud, Edward Fox,
Trevor Howard, Martin Sheen,
Candice Bergen, lan Char
leson, Michael Hordern, john

Richard Pryor Live on the
Sunset Strip (1982) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Richard Pryor's 20-minute
freebase routine may repre
sent the farthest leap any com
ic has taken since Lenny
Bruce: simultaneously
hilarious and harrowing, it
plays so many disparate emo
tional chords that one doesn't
know exactly how to respond
to it. The rest of this filmed
nightclub show (directed by
Joe Layton and shot by Haskell
Wexler) isn't up to Richard
Pryor Live in Concert — there are
few serious moments that
come across as sentimental —
but most of it is marvellous,
and liberating.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Alexander Nevsky (1938)
Terman Auditorium
It isn't easy to sort out one's
reactions to this famous Sergei
Eisenstein epic, set in medieval
Russia (where the adversaries
are invading German knights):
the imagery is often
phenomenal, Prokofiev's
music is magnificent, the ice
battle is one of the great war
sequences in movies, and yet a
lot of the movie is unbelievably
boring. Eisenstein certainly
created parts of a masterpiece.
Plays Tuesday evening.

My Dinner with Andre
(1981)
Cubberley Auditorium
Some people see this picture
— a collaboration by Louis Malle
(director), Andre Gregory and
Wallace Shawn (co-authors
and players) —as a profound es
say on the impossibility of con
nection in our time; it's not,
though it is a reasonably ab
sorbing comedy, and proof, if
we needed it, that a movie
need be no more than a two
hour dinner table dialogue.
Andre Gregory doesn't have
the kind of face a camera can
really explore, but Wallace
Shawn does: amazingly fron
tal, his brow permanently
furrowed and his eyes
narrowed as if he'd spent his
life trying to figure out what
the hell was going on around
him. His piping, hilarious
abrasive voice flies up into the
rafters when he becomes
excited, and he races through

his words. You may find him
more appealing than Gregory
(who is a well-known avant
garde director and disciple of
Jerzy Grotowski's Polish
Theatre Lab).
Plays this evening.

Gandhi (1982)
Memorial Auditorium
A three-and-a-quarter-hour
soporific. Richard Atten
horough doesn't have the right
qualities tor epic filmmaking;
furthermore, out of either a
lack of personal resources or
an ascetic refusal to vulgarize
Gandhi's story, he resists tur
ning it into theater. And in the
process of purifying it of his
torical lumps, he has buried
much essential factual infor
mation and obfuscated the is
sues. Ben Kingsley brings a fas
cinating mixture of under
stated passion and unpredicta
ble wit to the title role — he
humanizes the icon John
Briley's homiletic screenplay
sets up — but the rest of the cast
(John Gielgud, Edward Fox,
Trevor Howard, Martin Sheen,
Candice Bergen, lan Char
leson, Michael Hordern, john
Mills, etc., etc.) is just ex
pensive dressing.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
evenings.
Richard Pryor Live on the
Sunset Strip (1982) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Richard Pryor's 20-minute
freebase routine may repre
sent the farthest leap any com
ic has taken since Lenny
Bruce: simultaneously
hilarious and harrowing, it
plays so many disparate emo
tional chords that one doesn't
know exactly how to respond
to it. The rest of this filmed
nightclub show (directed by
Joe Layton and shot by Haskell
Wexler) isn't up to Richard
Pryor Live in Concert — there are
few serious moments that
come across as sentimental —
but most of it is marvellous,
and liberating.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Alexander Nevsky (1938)
Terman Auditorium
It isn't easy to sort out one's
reactions to this famous Sergei
Eisenstein epic, set in medieval
Russia (where the adversaries
are invading German knights):
the imagery is often
phenomenal, Prokofiev's
music is magnificent, the ice
battle is one of the great war
sequences in movies, and yet a
lot of the movie is unbelievably
boring. Eisenstein certainly
created parts of a masterpiece.
Plays Tuesday evening.

Sir Alfred (Rex Harrison): I doubt that
you played Russian roulette all the time
with your father!
Daphne (Linda Darnell): Oh, I most cer
tainly did. You play it with two packs of
cards...
Sir Alfred: That is Russian Bank. Russian
roulette is a very different amusement
which I can only your father had played
continually before he had you.

Unfaithfully Yours (1948) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Perhaps the best way to
describe this masterful ironic
comedy, written and directed
by Preston Sturges, is to pro
pose that if Noel Coward and
Luis Bunuel had collaborated,
they might have produced
something like this. A conduc
tor — of whom an admirer en
thuses, in a typical Sturges
epigram, "Nobody handles
Handel better than you handle
Handel" — decides that his
beautiful wife has been un
faithful to him, and he dreams
of revenge in fantasy scenes
scored to the music he con
ducts (Rossini's "Semiramide
Overture," Wagner's
"Pilgrims' Chorus," and
Tchaikovsky's "Francesca da
Rimini"). As the jealous hus
band, Rex Harrison gives a vi
brant, precise performance
that is surely his best, and his
wife is played by one of the
most breathtaking stars of the
era, Linda Darnell. Among the
Sturges regulars who show up
are Rudy Vallee, Lionel
Stander, Edgar Kennedy, Al
Bridge, Julius Tannen, Torben
Meyer and Robert Greig.
Plays Thursday with The
Miracle of Morgan's Creek.
The Miracle of Morgan's
Creek (1944) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Preston Sturges gem
gets funnier and funnier as it
runs on; the last 20 minutes
are as good as anything in
American comedy. Betty Hut
ton plays a young woman who
must find a father for her
forthcoming child, and she
picks a dupe who adores her:
Eddie Bracken, whose ner
vous, jangling, adrenalin
pumped personality is perfect
for a Sturges picture. This un
derhanded ploy is all the idea
of Hutton's devious, hard
edged kid sister (Diana Lynn),
who advises her, "He was
made for it - as the ox was made
to be eaten." With William
Demarest, Porter Hall, Brian
Donlevy and Akim Tamiroff (in
the roles they played in
Sturges' The Great McCinty
four years earlier), and Julius
Tannen, Al Bridge, Vic Potel,
Torben Meyer, Jimmy Conlin,
Chester Conklin and assorted
other Sturges folks. Even the
names are memorable in this

film: Hutton and Bracken play
Trudy Kockenlocker and Nor
vel Jones.
Plays Thursday with Unfaith
fully Yours.
Casablanca (1943) ★
Kresge Auditorium
In some theaters, when this
movie is shown, audiences
bring wine to toast the
"Marseillaise" scene and
everyone knows all the famous
lines, from"I stick my head
out for nobody" to "Louis, this
could be the start of a beautiful
friendship." Humphrey
Bogart, at his most romantic,
plays Rick, who owns a cafe in
wartime Casablanca; Ingrid
Bergman, at her most beautiful,
is Use, who deserted him in
Paris and now walks into his
clu' j with Paul Henreid, who
plays Victor Lazlo — the Resis
tance leader the Nazis can't
stop. Dooley Wilson, Peter
