# Sober Senior Pub Night drivers offered free soda
## 
### JULIE RYAN 
Seniors who are too "sloshed" to
find the door after having too many
drinks at pub night can now take
some comfort. Starting next week,
all they have to do is find someone
wearing a "Designated Driver'' but
ton to get them home and into bed.
Under a plan conceived by senior
Rob Larkins, "Designated Driver"
buttons and free soda will be
available during pub nights for
those who do not drink. A ride sign
up board will also be available so
seniors can find a sober ride home.
Pepsi has agreed to print up the
buttons and flyers, and all the bars
involved in senior pub nights have
agreed to pay for the soda.
Larkins said he thought of the
plan this summer as a way to "raise
people's awareness about driving
and drinking and to make it easier
for people to form carpools." FHe ap
proached the senior class presidents
who are also helping with the proj
ect.
"We're not going to play Mom,
said Larkins, explaining that the plan

will be self- policed. It someone is
wearing a button and has a beer in
their hand we're not going to grab it
from them"
Larkins said he hopes seniors will
take the program seriously. His
slogan is: "In the American League,
the designated hitter position is vi
tally important. We hope you'll treat
the Designated Driver's Program
with' equal respect."
The response from the pubs has
heen very favorable. "I think it's a
terrific idea," said Linda Page, day
manager of The Glo Worm. "It's a
good idea to have someone sober
when they leave.
"We're responsible when people
leave," she added, "but we don't al
ways know what people can han
dle."
In return for their participation,
the names of the bars will be an
nounced at all football and basket
ball games. Larkins said that beer
companies may also take out ads in
The Daily reminding people about
the program.
