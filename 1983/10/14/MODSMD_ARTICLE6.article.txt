Despite the remote address of i5/i Campus
Drive the people who live in the old /eta Psi
House consider themselves lucky - the house
has onlv two-room doubles, a sand volleyball
court, and a great view of Lake Lagunita.
Everyone is living it up at the /ete house -
everyone but the /etes.
Thev have not been able to live in the house
since October 1981, when the house was
taken away from them and the fraternity itselt
was kicked off campus. But their three-year
suspension is drawing to a close, and the /etes
are hoping to be recognized as a tiaternitv
again, and to get their house back.
In order to get back into the /ete house, the
/etes have to become recognized as a traternitv

again, and then apply tor housing. Most likely,
they will know about their status as a fraternity

"In a nutshell, /etes were kicked off campus

because ot a pattern of inadequate group gover

The last incident before the /etes eviction
was a suit filed by a young Mills College woman
who claimed that the /etes threw her into their
pond.
"/etes claim she was pushed in, she said she
was thrown in," Conklin said. "But this wasn't
the onlv incident that caused the /etes to he
kicked off - it was just the last."
When the /etes were evicted at the end ot tall
quarter 1981, their house was entered in the
open draw and the students with guarantees
were spread around campus.
The rumor that no more than two /etes were
allowed to live together is not true. According
to Conklin, Norm Robinson, dean of residential
