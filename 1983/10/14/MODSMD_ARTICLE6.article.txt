Despite the remote address of i5/i Campus
Drive the people who live in the old /eta Psi
House consider themselves lucky - the house
has onlv two-room doubles, a sand volleyball
court, and a great view of Lake Lagunita.
Everyone is living it up at the /ete house -
everyone but the /etes.
Thev have not been able to live in the house
since October 1981, when the house was
taken away from them and the fraternity itselt
was kicked off campus. But their three-year
suspension is drawing to a close, and the /etes
are hoping to be recognized as a tiaternitv
again, and to get their house back.
In order to get back into the /ete house, the
/etes have to become recognized as a traternitv

again, and then apply tor housing. Most likely,
they will know about their status as a fraternity
by the end of fall quarter.
Since they are not an officially recognized
traternitv at the moment, they do not have the
right to meet or hold rush on campus, and they
cannot call themselves the Stanford chapter of
/eta Psi.
/eta Psi President Jetf Scheel and Vice Presi
dent Clark Beyer have met with Row Director
Diana Conklin many times to formulate
"guidelines" for a new /eta Psi.
"Jeff and Clark and their predecessors have
tried hard to address the issues that caused all
of the trouble,' Conklin said. The "issues she
referred to were a series of destructive acts and
a history of generally destructive behavior.
"In a nutshell, /etes were kicked off campus

because ot a pattern of inadequate group gover
nance," Conkin said.
The last incident before the /etes eviction
was a suit filed by a young Mills College woman
who claimed that the /etes threw her into their
pond.
"/etes claim she was pushed in, she said she
was thrown in," Conklin said. "But this wasn't
the onlv incident that caused the /etes to he
kicked off - it was just the last."
When the /etes were evicted at the end ot tall
quarter 1981, their house was entered in the
open draw and the students with guarantees
were spread around campus.
The rumor that no more than two /etes were
allowed to live together is not true. According
to Conklin, Norm Robinson, dean of residential
education, considered imposing
that rule, but changed his mind
before the group was evicted.
"We didn't want the Zetes simply
regrouping somewhere else on
campus," Conklin said. "But we
figured the luck of the draw would
take care of that, and it has."
Past is past - many of the Zetes
who were actives at the time the
fraternity was kicked off campus

have graduated - and the frat sees
itself as an entirely new house, with
a new outlook and a new form of
government.
"In our meetings with the Univer
sity, we have tried to make improve
ments outlined in the proposal we
have submitted," Scheel said, refer
ring to the finalized proposal for
recognition submitted to Conklin
last week."We've restructured the
leadership of the house, increased
the number of officers from three to
seven and spread out the adminis
trative duties."
