### VALERIE CRITES 
University President Donald Ken
nedy yesterday criticized govern
ment efforts to limit the transfer of
American knowledge to other
countries by limiting visas to foreign
students and visitors.
"The government is trying to
restrict American knowledge," Ken
nedy said during a speech to more
than 130 people at the Bechtel Inter
national Center.
He described these efforts as "a
serious mistake which ignores the
good for scientific enterprise in
world-wide fields that can. result
from the collaboration.,"
Kennedy said the University
"intends to go on complaining"
when the government uses visa re
strictions to block the campus visits
of both students and foreign guests.
Kennedv referred specifically to a
bill proposed last year in Congress
that would have forced most foreign
graduate students to return to their

country after completing their
studies.
The speech, which was titled "The
Role of the University in the World,"
also covered the problem of attract
ing foreign students and visitors,
Stanford's overseas study programs
and the availability of international
fields of study.
Kennedv said that Stanford is
"known nationally as a group of
yentas" for its efforts on behalf of
foreign students and guests.
Stanford admits foreign students
of the basis of merit, and Kennedy
believes that these students present
"other culture's viewpoints which
help students to develop a broader
concept of the world: Without this
consciousness, students would be
much the poorer."
Currently, the number of foreign
graduate students is increasing, a
trend that Kennedy hopes to see
continue.
