# Students shelve sit-in as Meyer lengthens hours
## 
### BOB BARCKLAY 
A sit-in scheduled for Saturday evening to protest
reduced hours at Meyer Library was called off after li
brary officials agreed to lengthen weekend night hours.
In response to student concern over the reduction in
weekend hours and the threat of the planned protest,
library officials released a letter to students Friday indi
cating that they would reinstate night hours on Satur
day nights, probably until at least 10 p.m."
Senior Mike Stryer, who organized the protest, said
the agreement was reached late Friday afternoon after a
discussion with Dale Canelas, associate director for
public services.
I told him it would be in the best interest of both
parties to reinstate the late weekend hours," Stryer
said.
Stryer said Canelas told him it will take about two
weeks before the later hours go into effect. In the
meantime, as stated in the letter released by adminis
trators, a student questionnaire will be circulated in
Meyer in order to 'solicit student advise on the most
necessary hours and services." The library plans to in
form students of the results in a public report.
At 5:40 p.m., twenty minutes before closing time,
students were told over the intercom that the protest
had been canceled.
As a small crowd gathered in the lobby, jesus Caspar,
the library night supervisor, offered his opinion of the
proposed sit-in.
"Its silly," he said. "There are a number of other
important causes that students could put their energy
He cited budgetary cutbacks and the low number of
students in Meyer on Friday and Saturday nights as
reasons for the reduction in weekend hours. "On Sat
urday nights, the bats outnumber the students,"
Gasnar said

His comments were met with a barrage of complaints
Irom students who said the library should be open on
the weekends when the dorms are too noisy. Though
most said they did not use the library every weekend,
they felt it was important to have a place to go during
midterms and other "heavy" periods.
Jim McGrath, a graduate ASSU senator, said library
officials had made the change without consulting stu
dents. "You can't say you didn't get any student
response, he said. "You didn't go through the proper
channels."

Despite the protest's cancellation, a group of about
10 students, several of them clad in bedsheets, entered
the library at closing hours. When Stryer asked them if
they aware that the sit-in had been called off, one
replied, "Yeah, but we're going to protest anyway."
Minutes later, they left without incident.
