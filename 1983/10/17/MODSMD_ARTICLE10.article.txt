The nine-member editorial board ?nter
viewed six of the seven announced candidates
for the three open graduate ASSU Senate spots
from the School of Engineering on Friday.
Only candiates who were interviewed or
who submitted a statement to the editorial
board were considered for endorsement. Our
choices are as follows.
Mary Kay Clinton
Although this is Mary Kay Clinton's first year
at Stanford, her enthusiasm and concern for
graduate students here would make hers a fine
senator. The former Texas A & M student now
working for a master's degree in civil engineer
ing said the major problem she sees for
graduate students is a barrier to information. If
elected, she plans to be a link to the senate for
engineering students by representing their
concerns and then providing feedback to them
at the engineering dorm where she lives. Clin
ton said she, like all graduate students, is inter
erested in the teaching assistant/research assis
tant issue.
Dan Lerner
Dan Lerner, a former Stanford undergradu
ate now in a co-terminal program, said his pri-

Mary objective is to streamline the decision
making process in the senate. Though his hope
to institute "management by objective," a svs
tem currently used at Hewlett-Packard may be
a bit optimistic, Lerner has some good ideas
about reforming the senate's decision-making
process. His opinion that the ASSU has
become more of a forum for outspoken people
than a legislative body is a good one and he
should be given the chance to work within the
system to change it.
Pardner Wynn
Pardner Wynn, a sixth-year student now
working toward a doctorate, has been around
campus long enough to adequately represent
the School of Engineering in the senate. He
believes that the ASSU is not organized "to do
stuff for grad students," and he wants to
change that by representing "the graduate stu
dent frame of mind" in the senate. The
graduate issues Wynn is most concerned about
are on-campus housing and the teaching assis
tant/research assistant program. He also would
like to change the current system whereby stu
dents cannot obtain fee assessment refunds
unless they voted in the previous election, and
feels the ASSU should take positions on iss les
such as the current Reagan library controver y.
