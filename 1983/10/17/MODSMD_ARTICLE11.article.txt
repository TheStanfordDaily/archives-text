# Declaring the week of the wink
## 
### 
They're back. The new people are here with bright
eyes, new backpacks and new bikes.
It's orientation week and at least one-tenth of the
campus population beams a new, bright, gleaming face
full of high expectations. Beaming! Awaiting the
erudite experience. That's week one.
A week later all of those new, bright, beaming faces
(NBBF) seem to be lost in a sea of anomie. All of that
enthusiasm dampened. Anomie and the "stranger"
complex replaces NBBF. And as the intensity of work
accompanying pre-med, pre-law, pre-MBA and pre-
Ph.D. looms, it becomes increasingly difficult to
recapture the moment of that first week — that week
when it was normal to walk around expecting some
minimal sign of human recognition. Look no further.
It's over. And until we bridge the cultural gap, there's
no turning back. Let me clarity.
Scene One: New Bright and Beaming Face (NBBF)
meets ancient and Native Stanfordian (NS) rushing,
walking or biking through White Plaza in the opposite
direction. For one split second their eyes meet. What's
next? More than likely, someone's going to get the Cast
Away. What's that? The Cast Away is the feeling one of
the two will get when one of them breaks that glance
and looks toward UGLY as if its the most interesting
building in the world. There's no further sign, symbol
or indication that the other person exists. Cast Away in
the Sea of Anomie.
Scene Two: NBBF t'reshperson meets NS's glance. NS
nods. NBBF freshperson waves and lights up like a lost
child happy to find a neighborhood where at least the
neighborhood puppv recognizes him.
Most t'reshpeople would probably agree that when it
comes to receiving personal recognition of your
humanity, there are slim pickings on the Farm. I can
still remember my first year. The Cast Away Scene
repeated itself a thousand times. After vou've been

here a month or two you'll learn that it's nothing per
sonal. It's normal — here.
However, did you ever get the impression that a true
sign that vou've graduated from NBBF (low status) to
NS (experienced and high status) rests in vour ability to
view the Cast Away as Normal and Routine (NAR)?
But if you have lived in another culture outside of the
United States, the Cast Away catches you off-guard
everytime. It may take you a few years to grow ac
customed to it. Or, you may never adjust.
Having lived in numerous cultures and subcultures
inside and outside of the United States, I find the NAR a
point of interest. It's a fluke. It's almost like someone
forgot something. There's a gap. An awkward one. And
we have no common non-verhal expression that is both
brief and non-threatening to fill that moment. For most
of us, the Cast Awav is our only option.
As an anthropologist, I find the Cast Away a bit odd.
Most cultures share a common verbal or non-verbal
expression to bridge that brief period of awkwardness,
that period right after that split second of eye contact.
The expression varies. It may range from an exuberant
embrace to a simple nod — depending on how well
acquainted the two individuals are. But seldom will you
find a subculture where there is no customary way to
bridge that gap.
Let me propose another option. Since we're all here,
and its our little farm, we have the unique opportunity
to generate and regenerate new cultural norms. Let's
declare this the week of the wink. The next time you
find yourself approaching NAR, wink, and keep right
on walking or biking or rushing to your next appoint
ment. Try it. I thinkyou'll like it.
