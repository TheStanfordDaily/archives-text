7 rash on campus
In Wednesday's Daily, (Oct. 12)
Neil Haven posited the need for
more trash receptacles around
campi s. A worthy contention, but
I take issue with his reasoning. He
stated with tongue not clearly in
cheek, that "Even a freshman can
not be faulted for hiding his empty
can. . . if there is no trash bin
within half a mile."
The suggestion here is that litter
ing is acceptable if appropriate
disposal is not convenient. It is
quite evident that this ethic has its
adherents. My guess is that most
of us are willing to take responsi
bility for our detritus, no matter
where the nearest waste basket
resides.
Haven's central point, that areas
of our campus are trash-ridden, is
well taken. It is ironic that the
vehicle of his ideas, The Daily, is
responsible for the most visible
component of the problem. The
Daily's inane distribution practice
of scattering tied bundles at
"strategic" locations around
campus, and allowing the wind to
take care of the extras, results, in
Stanford's version of tumbleweed
(papier mache when it rains.)

Editorial shortsighted
To use The Daily's own words, I
found its editorial on campus
parking (Oct. 14) hopelessly
shortsighted. If the University, as it
grows, wishes to control its land
usage in an efficient and aesthetic
manner, it must modify some of
the demands placed on it, rather
than simply respond in a
destructive manner â€” in other

words, construct more parking
facilities. Providing disincentives to
staff and students to drive their
cars is an excellent method of
preventing the campus from re
sembling a shopping mall. In addi
tion, cars on campus impose a
definite cost on all members of the
University, and thus it is not at all
unreasonable that parking fees go
toward subsidizing other forms of
transportation on campus.

Qualifying feminism
My reaction to Leon Dayan's
viewpoint, "Trying to understand
feminism" (Oct. 13), was a combi
nation of anger and frustration.
I was angered because Davan
seems to base his conclusions
about feminism on his limited
encounters with radical feminists.
Dayan explains that he has spoken
with and heard about feminists
who are avid man-haters and has
worked with feminists who are
selfish, promiscuous men-users.
The latter, he appears to conclude,
are the most typical feminists.
Most feminists, I believe, are
concerned with eliminating dis
criminatorv laws and practices
which affect women in our society
in general and in the work force in
particular. They seek to open
doors so that women will have as
many options as men have and will
be able to benefit equally from
society's legal, educational and
professional institutions.
What frustrated me about the
article was that it helped me to
realize how easily misconceptions
about feminism can be arrived at
and how common such misconc >p
tions are likely to be. In any

popular movement, those who
receive the most attention are the
activists whose beliefs are the mos
radical, controversial and reaction
ary. These radicals often draw
needed attention to the move
ment, but they also tend to convev
confusing and inaccurate -deas
about the movement and its goaK
The majority of feminists, however
are not vengeful, unteminine men
haters who want to unravel the
social fabric of the country.

Distorting the Bible
The Dailv article "Christians figh
loneliness'' (Oct. 10) has lowered
the term "fundamentalist Chris
tian" to new depths. I used to
consider myself a fundamentalist
Christian: I believed that the Bible
was the divinely inspired and iner
rant word of Cod; I had believed
in the redemptive work of Jesus
Christ. The extremes of the "Mora
Majority" and articles like tite one
in The Daily, however, hast forcec
me (and I believe many others) to
avoid such terms as
"fundamental."
I absolutely agree that one's
litestvle in no way precludes one
from knowing lesus Christ.
However, to portray the Christian
faith with quotations such .is "the
Bible never puis down sex," and
"lesus isn't going to keep me from
partying," is a gross distortion ot
the Christian gospel and moral
tone of the Bible. Such a portraval
whether it was the intention of the
writer or those interviewed by him
is indeed a "watered down, tail
c ed torm of Christianitv."
