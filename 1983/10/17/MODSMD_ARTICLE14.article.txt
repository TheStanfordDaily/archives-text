## Coffee house, concerts, communication top COP goals 
### 
I suppose it is a little dangerous
making a list ot goals for the coming
year public. By writing this, I am
violating the cardinal rule of elected
officials and erstwhile politicians:
never make specific promises. But
somehow, seeing these ideas in
writing makes them more concrete,
more defined and more practicable.
Some of these goals are very real
istic. Others are goals — they repre
sent something to shoot for but not
necessarily reach. All of them will
occupy the energy of the Council of
Presidents for the coming year.
Without further ado, here is what
we hope to accomplish as the Coun
cil of Presidents for 1983-84:
On Campus
Coffee House — It is no secret that
the Coffee House has worked up
something of a debt in the past few
years. We will not be able to pay off
the debt completely this year.
However, by working with Garv Ver
zani, the Coffee House manager, we
will be able to put the restaurant
back on the road to black ink.
Concerts on Campus — The present
concert system is a mess. With a
multitude of on-campus groups
trying to underbid each other in or
der to do business with off-campus
promoters, it's no wonder that Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
placed a moratorium on campus
concerts. We want to see one
unified alliance of students and Uni
versity administrators responsible
for concert promotion. The empha
sis should be on providing enter
tainment to students, not tund
raising.
Coordinating Committees —
Decentralization seems to be the
watchword at Stantord. Whether the
issue be student groups' rights, the
University budget or tuition rates, it

is near to impossible to find one or
two people who can make a deci
sion and put it into effect. We would
like to establish women's group and
minority group coordinating coun
cils. That way, if there is an issue
that is of interest to either women's
groups or minority groups, an effec
tive mechanism for disseminating
information and coordinating ac
tions would exist.
Communication — It's an old saw,
but part of politics is public rela
tions. vvlll luut a tree-flow of infor
mation, an active interchange be
tween government and those it pur

ports to represent will never take
place. Let's face it — all elective offices
carry with them a constituency — and
our constituency is students. As a
result, we will be submitting
opinions to The Daily, going to
dorm meetings, making speeches,
holding office hours, discussing at
sherry hours, talking on KZSU, put
ting out an ASSU newsletter, or
ganizing a retreat for leaders of stu
dent groups, and whatever else we
can think of.
Inside the ASSU
Part of our job as the Council of
Presidents involves the oversight of

the ASSU as an organization. We
have identified a series of goals that
we have set for the ASSU.
Campus Entertainment Agency —
The Campus Entertainment Agency,
or "CEA" as it is known in ASSU jar
gon, has been reorganized to serve
as a band-booking agency for
campus parties.
Office of Public Affairs — As men
tioned above, communication is
one of our main concerns this year.
The Office of Public Affairs, under
Fernando Pena, will serve to coor
dinate our efforts to publicize issues
of student interest. The office will

put on the Harvest festival, a fair to
promote student groups, in late Oc
tober.
Temporary' Employment Center —
The University contracted for nearly
S1 million in temporary office and
secretarial help in 1982-83. We
would like to establish an agency
that matches students who have of
fice skills with University depart
ments that need temporary help.
That way, students could earn
money at temporary jobs while the
University would not have to pay an
off-campus agency for skills that are
readily available on campus.

Pipe Dreams
The next set of goals are perhaps
the most interesting. They are also
the most wide-ranging and thereby
difficult to achieve. These projects
are by nature long-range goals. We
aim to start the ball rolling in the
right direction.
Student Group Center Sometime
in the next few years, we would like
to see the cornerstone laid lor a new
student group center Ihis building
would house the support systems so
desperately needed by student
groups — officespac e, hlingt abinets,
phone lines, typewr ilei s, and
copiers. Compared with .1 new < lock
tower, I suppose lli.it sur It .1 (enter
is not a really attra< live fund-raising
project tor the University, Hut noth
ing else is so needed by the student
groups that would add so much to
Stanford. Too many ol these campus
groups are run out of dorm rooms,
tunded only by the largesse of their
officers.
House of Representatives — The
most common complaint about stu
dent government at Stanford is that
it is unrepresentative, out ot touch
with students and concerned purely
with its own self-interest. We are
working to change that conception
in all of our actions. But why not
change it by bringing more students
into the process? In other words, es
tablish a bicameral legislature — a
Senate and a House of Representa
tives. The House could be drawn
from on-campus living groups,
graduate departments and off
campus students — ensuring a diver
sity of interests, concerns and back
grounds.
