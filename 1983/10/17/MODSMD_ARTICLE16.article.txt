# Professor's Commentary: Sandy Dornbusch
## Study of Stanford and the Schools: A hidden project? 
### 
Prof. Sandy Dornbusch has
been at Stanford for 24 years,
and was the first head of the
Sociology Department here.
He has served as the elected
chairman of the Faculty Advi
sory Board, the Academic Sen
ate and the American Associa
tion of University Professors.
He is currently involved in 7he
Stanford and the Schools
Study and has a new book
coming out in February en
titled "Teacher Evaluative
Standards and Student Effort."
I appreciate the chance to
write an occasional column for
the Midpeninsula's only daily
morning paper, although I
have no illusions about my
skills as a journalist.
Stanford is a big place, and
one is not surprised when The
Daily's investigative reporters
expose some squalid en
terprise buried under the rock
of academic jargon. In con
trast, I'd like to describe a
project that most Stanford
rooters would be proud of, if
they knew it existed. It's a col
laborative study between the
University and six Bay Area
school districts, designed to
improve high schools on both
the local and national level.
Nobody has been keeping it
secret; yet few know about it,
even thought the first budget
was for $1.6 million.
The leaders of this project
are an unusual pair. One is
Oonald Kennedy, president of
the University and utility in
fielder. The other is Myron At
kin, the new dean of the
School of Education. When At
kin came to Stanford, here

solved to relate the School of
Education more directly to the
schools and their problems.
Uncle Don said he'd like to
join Atkin in a major study of
secondary schools. There
aren't yet results in which we
can take pride, but the goal of
this major Stanford effort is it
self praiseworthy.
The research is called The
Study of Stanford and the
Schools. The"and" in the title
is the most important word in
it. It's not a study "by" Stan
ford or "of" the schools. The
neighboring school districts
and Stanford are supposed to
be equal partners in defining
what ought to be studied, un
derstanding what the findings
mean and evaluating various
attempts to improve teaching

and learning. For its part, Stan
ford wants to increase its
knowledge of the educational
system so it can produce
teachers and administrators
who can be effective in that
tough world out there.
So far the project has gotten
off to a good start and, predic
tably, has big problems. About
30 Stanford faculty and 40
graduate students are working
on a variety of studies. You
can't have that many research
ers without a need for in
creased coordination and con
trol. The speedy start has
meant that the ideas of the
school superintendents, prin
cipals and teachers were not
built into the early design.
Recent meetings with school
administrators have helped

them communicate their
views, and a spirit of col
laboration is beginning to
develop.
Since every week seems to
bring to the front page of The
New York Times a study of
current educational problems,
is there reason to believe that
Stanford's new study will
prove worthwhile? A national
advisory board, composed of
major figures in the educa
tional establishment, an
swered that question af
firmatively.
Most of those highly
publicized studies can point to
empirical evidence on what is
wrong with schools, but their
suggestions for improvement
are the untested products of
armchair speculation. What is
unusual about Stanford and
the Schools is that it can test
suggested remedies and in
itiatives before proclaiming
them to the world.
In a world where the urgent
often drives out the impor
tant, it's nice to think that the
president and a dean of Stan
ford have diverted some of
their time and energy to hel
ping secondary schools in
stead of complaining about
them. Foundations have
recognized the unusual com
mitment that Stanford is
making and have provided the
needed funds. So, in the midst
of our usual griping and bick
ering, it doesn't hurt if the
Stanford community indulges
in a little self-congratulations.
(This is the first in a series of
columns written by University
professors. A different profes
sor will appear each week.)
