## Huskies roll up 465 yards Predictable Card loses again 
### ADAM BERNS 
Seattle, Wash. — It was
homecoming at the University
ot Washington Saturday. The
Stanford football team didn't
spoil it.
Living by the Holiday Inn
motto, the best surprise is no
surprise," Stanford surprised
no one as Washington
dominated the Cardinal from
start to finish, winning the
game i2-15 in a contest which
was not as close as the score
indicated.
Cardinal quarterback |ohn
Paye, who finished the game
with only four completions in
16 attempts for a paltry 13
yards before being taken out
in the fourth quarter, thought
part of the problem was that
Washington had picked up

Stanford s auaioies.
"Fifty percent of our plays
were audibles," Pave said after
the game. "When they heard
our audibles, they checked off
to a different formation. It was
almost as if they knew our
plays."
The Huskies dominated the
Cardinal in every phase of the
game, gaining 465 net yards to
278 for Stanford — much of
which came in the fourth
quarter when the game was
already out of reach.
If there was a bright spot for
the Cardinal, it was the run
ning of fullback Kaulana Park
who rushed for 75 yards on
nine carries tor an 8.5-yard
average to lead the Stantord
team to 137 yards on the
ground.

Unfortunately, Stantord
lives and dies by the pass, and
the aerial attack never got
started. The Cardinal gained
just 141 yards in the air, well
below its season average ot
275.
"The number one thing was
that they pressured us pretft
well," Stanford Coach Paul
Wiggin said following the
game. "Thev have an out
standing defense. I told our
otfense that we couldn't do
anything to get out of
rhythm."
Stanford also had problems
on the defensive side of the
ball, giving up 465 vards, its
highest total this season. Al
though the Huskies had |ust
141 passing vards, they ran the
Stanford defense ragged,

puking up <-4 yards on the
ground.
Stantord is hrst in the Pac
-10 against the pass and last
against the run, Washington
t oach Don lames said follow
ing the contest, " u nd you
hope it they're last, you can
keep them there."
Husk\ tailback Sterling
Hinds led the Washington
ground game with 188 yards
on lb carries for a ".2 average.
He replaced Jacques Robinson
\s ho left the game early with a
bruised foot.
I think they (the Huskies)
are a tine football team," Wig
gin s.nd. "They did some very
clever things that caught us off
guard.
"They had an attack that was
exclusively strong side. Atter
we made some changes, they
changed some things up on
us."
They had a good game plan
against us," Card defensive
tackle Mike Wyman said.
They came out and did some
different stuff. I think they
were the best offensive line
we've played. They were great
technicians and were well
coached as well."
Washington quarterback
Steve Pelleur also was very ef
fective, passing the ball down
the middle. He ended the af
ternoon completing 18-of-30
passes.
Stanford's first offensive se
ries gave an ominous hint of
what was to follow. On Stan
ford's first play, Paye was
crushed by the Husky defense
while throwing a pass out to
the left flat, a pass which was
nearly intercepted by Wash
ington. While this time the
Huskies were called for rough
ing the passer, the rest of the
game brought more of the
same with Washington blitz
ing ail afternoon.

On its next offensive series,
Washington marched 63 yards
and capped the drive with a 3-
yard touchdown run by Robin
son. The Huskies missed the
extra point.
Taking advantage of a
fumble by Cardinal halfback
Kevin Scott, Washington's
Hinds ran over the left side for
13 yards and then came back
with a pitch to the right for 24
yards for the Husky's second
score. Washington missed on
a two-point conversion try as
its lead increased to 12-0.
After a 46-yard field goal by
Stanford's Mark Harmon, the
Huskies came back with two
second-quarter field goals and
led at the half 18-3.
In the third quarter, Wash
ington scored again on a 2-
yard run by Hinds, capping a
60-yard drive.
Washington's final score
came when Husky cornerback

J.C. Pearson recovered a
fumble by Cardinal tight end
Jim Clymer and returned the
ball 42 yards for the touch
down.
Stanford came back late in
the fourth quarter, scoring
two fourth-quarter touch
downs to keep the game
close.
With 8:28 left in the game,
receiver Mike Tolliver caught a
7-yard touchdown pass from
Steve Cottrell who had
replaced Paye earlier in the
fourth quarter. The Cardinal
missed its two-point try.
Stanford scored again with
2:38 left as Emile Harry caught
a 14-yard pass to cap an 88-
yard drive, but again missed a
two-point conversion attempt.
Linebacker Mark Machtolf
recovered an onside kick for
Stanford, but Cottrell fumbled
three plays later before Wash
ington ran out the clock.

From the locker room
Paul Wiggin reaffirmed after
the game that Paye is still his
starting quarterback adding
that the only reason he would
not start Paye would be for
Paye's "own good."
Stanford halfback Scott
reinjured his shoulder Satur
day but as of last night the ex
tent of the injury was not
known. Halfback Thomas
Henley and fullback Rob
Moore also did not play due to
injuries.
During halftime, the Wash
ington band made fun of the
30 or so members of the
Leland Stanford junior Univer
sity Marching Band who
traveled north for the game.
Re-creating the final play of
last year's Big Came, several
Washington band members
teamed up to tackle a mock
California football player.

Seattle, Wash. — It was
homecoming at the University
ot Washington Saturday. The
Stanford football team didn't
spoil it.
Living by the Holiday Inn
motto, the best surprise is no
surprise," Stanford surprised
no one as Washington
dominated the Cardinal from
start to finish, winning the
game i2-15 in a contest which
was not as close as the score
indicated.
Cardinal quarterback |ohn
Paye, who finished the game
with only four completions in
16 attempts for a paltry 13
yards before being taken out
in the fourth quarter, thought
part of the problem was that
Washington had picked up

Stanford s auaioies.
"Fifty percent of our plays
were audibles," Pave said after
the game. "When they heard
our audibles, they checked off
to a different formation. It was
almost as if they knew our
plays."
The Huskies dominated the
Cardinal in every phase of the
game, gaining 465 net yards to
278 for Stanford — much of
which came in the fourth
quarter when the game was
already out of reach.
If there was a bright spot for
the Cardinal, it was the run
ning of fullback Kaulana Park
who rushed for 75 yards on
nine carries tor an 8.5-yard
average to lead the Stantord
team to 137 yards on the
ground.

Unfortunately, Stantord
lives and dies by the pass, and
the aerial attack never got
started. The Cardinal gained
just 141 yards in the air, well
below its season average ot
275.
"The number one thing was
that they pressured us pretft
well," Stanford Coach Paul
Wiggin said following the
game. "Thev have an out
standing defense. I told our
otfense that we couldn't do
anything to get out of
rhythm."
Stanford also had problems
on the defensive side of the
ball, giving up 465 vards, its
highest total this season. Al
though the Huskies had |ust
141 passing vards, they ran the
Stanford defense ragged,

puking up <-4 yards on the
ground.
Stantord is hrst in the Pac
-10 against the pass and last
against the run, Washington
t oach Don lames said follow
ing the contest, " u nd you
hope it they're last, you can
keep them there."
Husk\ tailback Sterling
Hinds led the Washington
ground game with 188 yards
on lb carries for a ".2 average.
He replaced Jacques Robinson
\s ho left the game early with a
bruised foot.
I think they (the Huskies)
are a tine football team," Wig
gin s.nd. "They did some very
clever things that caught us off
guard.
"They had an attack that was
exclusively strong side. Atter
we made some changes, they
changed some things up on
us."
They had a good game plan
against us," Card defensive
tackle Mike Wyman said.
They came out and did some
different stuff. I think they
were the best offensive line
we've played. They were great
technicians and were well
coached as well."
Washington quarterback
Steve Pelleur also was very ef
fective, passing the ball down
the middle. He ended the af
ternoon completing 18-of-30
passes.
Stanford's first offensive se
ries gave an ominous hint of
what was to follow. On Stan
ford's first play, Paye was
crushed by the Husky defense
while throwing a pass out to
the left flat, a pass which was
nearly intercepted by Wash
ington. While this time the
Huskies were called for rough
ing the passer, the rest of the
game brought more of the
same with Washington blitz
ing ail afternoon.

On its next offensive series,
Washington marched 63 yards
and capped the drive with a 3-
yard touchdown run by Robin
son. The Huskies missed the
extra point.
Taking advantage of a
fumble by Cardinal halfback
Kevin Scott, Washington's
Hinds ran over the left side for
13 yards and then came back
with a pitch to the right for 24
yards for the Husky's second
score. Washington missed on
a two-point conversion try as
its lead increased to 12-0.
After a 46-yard field goal by
Stanford's Mark Harmon, the
Huskies came back with two
second-quarter field goals and
led at the half 18-3.
In the third quarter, Wash
ington scored again on a 2-
yard run by Hinds, capping a
60-yard drive.
Washington's final score
came when Husky cornerback

J.C. Pearson recovered a
fumble by Cardinal tight end
Jim Clymer and returned the
ball 42 yards for the touch
down.
Stanford came back late in
the fourth quarter, scoring
two fourth-quarter touch
downs to keep the game
close.
With 8:28 left in the game,
receiver Mike Tolliver caught a
7-yard touchdown pass from
Steve Cottrell who had
replaced Paye earlier in the
fourth quarter. The Cardinal
missed its two-point try.
Stanford scored again with
2:38 left as Emile Harry caught
a 14-yard pass to cap an 88-
yard drive, but again missed a
two-point conversion attempt.
Linebacker Mark Machtolf
recovered an onside kick for
Stanford, but Cottrell fumbled
three plays later before Wash
ington ran out the clock.

From the locker room
Paul Wiggin reaffirmed after
the game that Paye is still his
starting quarterback adding
that the only reason he would
not start Paye would be for
Paye's "own good."
Stanford halfback Scott
reinjured his shoulder Satur
day but as of last night the ex
tent of the injury was not
known. Halfback Thomas
Henley and fullback Rob
Moore also did not play due to
injuries.
