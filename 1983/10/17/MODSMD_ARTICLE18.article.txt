Seattle, Wash. — About all Stanford
defenders saw ot Washington tailback Ster
ling Hinds Saturday afternoon was, well, his
be-hind.
The 5-toot-11,185-pound senior speedster
bounced his way off Cardinal tacklers to 188
yards — the single-game high in Hinds'career
as a Husky and the most by one player
against Stanford this season.
Hinds, who is also a world-class sprinter,
did all this on just 26 carries, an average of
7.2 yards per attempt. More importantly, he
scored two touchdowns, the first on an
electrifying 24-yard run down the right
sideline.
"You gotta be pleased with a performance
like that," said Hinds, who was quick to
credit his supporting actors. "The offensive
line was really opening up holes. I think
anyone can be hot with holes like that.
"Anyone" in Husky talk means running
backs like Jacque Robinson, Ron "Cookie'
jackson and Hinds, a trio of rushers that
would probably start on most teams in the
natinn Rut nnlv nnp tailhark ran nlav at a

time and consequently the Huskies have a
"tailback controversy.
All three have started sometime this
season, but Robinson seemed to have the
upper edge going into Saturday's game. The
6-0, 202-pound junior, who in 1981 became
the first freshman ever to be named the
most valuable player of a Rose Bowl, started
against the Cardinal and scored a touch
down before departing with a bruised foot
and giving way to Hinds' heroics.
But just as things seem to get easier for
Hinds, they get more complicated. Every time
the Washington tailback gains one more
yard and bounces off one more would-be
tackier, his summer plans become more
dubious.
Hinds is Canada's version of Willie Gault,
the American sprinter and hurdler who
sacrificed his amateur status and chance for
a medal in the 1984 Olympics to sign with
the National Football League's Chicago
Bears as a wide receiver.
Hinds has a chance to represent Canada in
those same Olympics next August as a
sprinter. But if he has a few more days like
he did Saturday against Stanford, he may
very well find himself in an NFL training
camp during the month of August.
What will he do? "I'm not really thinking
about the summer yet," he said. "Right
now, it's football. I try not to think about
track right now. After the (football) season,
I'll run track for the school and see what
happens."
Hinds said the thought of foregoing his
last year as a Husky tailback to concentrate
on the Olympics didn't even cross his mind.
"As a matter of fact," he noted, "I didn't go
to the World (Track and Field) Champion
ships at Helsinki (last August).
"I had the plane ticket and everything. But
my leg was a little sore and I wanted to rest
up and get ready for the football season."
In his first three years at Washington,
Hinds' accomplishments on the track have
rivaled those on the football field. Last year,
he ran the second leg of the Huskies' school
record 4 x 100 meter relay team that finished
second in the NCAA Championships. He
also recorded bests of 10.27 and 20.61 in the
100 and 200 meters.
Hinds used that blistering speed to his ad
vantage Saturday, pulling away from Stan
ford defenders once he got into the second
ary, which was quite often.
His first touchdown came in the first quar
ter on a well-disguised counter sweep that

caught the Cardinal defense off guard. "I
lined up on the left and then cut right, be
hind the tackle (Rick Mallory)," he describ
ed.
Hinds' second six-pointer of the after
noon was on 2-yard dive over the left side.
Though Stanford defenders argued with the
officials that he had not crossed the goal
line, Hinds was convinced he had scored. "I
know I was over," he said. "I wouldn't lie."
Besides his two touchdowns, Hinds had
three rushes over 20 yards and six over 9. He
also caught two Steve Pelluer passes for 14
yards, raising his total yardage in the game
to 202.
Much of his rushing yardage came after he
bounced off Cardinal defenders like a pin
ball. "When I run out of room, I just try to
get upfield and I run into them (defenders).
"They're usually not prepared to arm
tackle me, so if you keep your balance, you
can bounce off."
Hinds, a computer science major at Wash
ington, was more than a two-sport man at
Erindale High School, where he was a right
wing on the hockey team. But in 11th grade,
"I had to give it (hockey) up," he said. "It
started becoming too demanding. The deci
sion disappointed my father, but it enabled
me to play football and run track."
Hinds remembers well Stanford's 43-31
upset win over Washington last year. "I was
definitely thinking about last year (during
Saturday's game)," he said.
"We were No. 1 and they knocked us off.
We wanted to get a little payback and I guess
we got that today."

be-hind.
The 5-toot-11,185-pound senior speedster
bounced his way off Cardinal tacklers to 188
yards — the single-game high in Hinds'career
as a Husky and the most by one player
against Stanford this season.
Hinds, who is also a world-class sprinter,
did all this on just 26 carries, an average of
7.2 yards per attempt. More importantly, he
scored two touchdowns, the first on an
electrifying 24-yard run down the right
sideline.
"You gotta be pleased with a performance
like that," said Hinds, who was quick to
credit his supporting actors. "The offensive
line was really opening up holes. I think
anyone can be hot with holes like that.
"Anyone" in Husky talk means running
backs like Jacque Robinson, Ron "Cookie'
jackson and Hinds, a trio of rushers that
would probably start on most teams in the
natinn Rut nnlv nnp tailhark ran nlav at a

time and consequently the Huskies have a
"tailback controversy.
All three have started sometime this
season, but Robinson seemed to have the
upper edge going into Saturday's game. The
6-0, 202-pound junior, who in 1981 became
the first freshman ever to be named the
most valuable player of a Rose Bowl, started
against the Cardinal and scored a touch
down before departing with a bruised foot
and giving way to Hinds' heroics.
But just as things seem to get easier for
Hinds, they get more complicated. Every time
the Washington tailback gains one more
yard and bounces off one more would-be
tackier, his summer plans become more
dubious.
Hinds is Canada's version of Willie Gault,
the American sprinter and hurdler who
sacrificed his amateur status and chance for
a medal in the 1984 Olympics to sign with
the National Football League's Chicago
Bears as a wide receiver.
Hinds has a chance to represent Canada in
those same Olympics next August as a
sprinter. But if he has a few more days like
he did Saturday against Stanford, he may
very well find himself in an NFL training
camp during the month of August.
What will he do? "I'm not really thinking
about the summer yet," he said. "Right
now, it's football. I try not to think about
track right now. After the (football) season,
I'll run track for the school and see what
happens."
Hinds said the thought of foregoing his
last year as a Husky tailback to concentrate
on the Olympics didn't even cross his mind.
"As a matter of fact," he noted, "I didn't go
to the World (Track and Field) Champion
ships at Helsinki (last August).
"I had the plane ticket and everything. But
my leg was a little sore and I wanted to rest
up and get ready for the football season."
In his first three years at Washington,
Hinds' accomplishments on the track have
rivaled those on the football field. Last year,
he ran the second leg of the Huskies' school
record 4 x 100 meter relay team that finished
second in the NCAA Championships. He
also recorded bests of 10.27 and 20.61 in the
100 and 200 meters.
Hinds used that blistering speed to his ad
vantage Saturday, pulling away from Stan
ford defenders once he got into the second
ary, which was quite often.
His first touchdown came in the first quar
ter on a well-disguised counter sweep that

caught the Cardinal defense off guard. "I
lined up on the left and then cut right, be
hind the tackle (Rick Mallory)," he describ
ed.
Hinds' second six-pointer of the after
noon was on 2-yard dive over the left side.
Though Stanford defenders argued with the
officials that he had not crossed the goal
line, Hinds was convinced he had scored. "I
know I was over," he said. "I wouldn't lie."
Besides his two touchdowns, Hinds had
three rushes over 20 yards and six over 9. He
also caught two Steve Pelluer passes for 14
yards, raising his total yardage in the game
to 202.
Much of his rushing yardage came after he
bounced off Cardinal defenders like a pin
ball. "When I run out of room, I just try to
get upfield and I run into them (defenders).
"They're usually not prepared to arm
tackle me, so if you keep your balance, you
can bounce off."
Hinds, a computer science major at Wash
ington, was more than a two-sport man at
Erindale High School, where he was a right
wing on the hockey team. But in 11th grade,
"I had to give it (hockey) up," he said. "It
started becoming too demanding. The deci
sion disappointed my father, but it enabled
me to play football and run track."
Hinds remembers well Stanford's 43-31
upset win over Washington last year. "I was
definitely thinking about last year (during
Saturday's game)," he said.
"We were No. 1 and they knocked us off.
We wanted to get a little payback and I guess
we got that today."
