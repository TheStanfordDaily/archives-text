Seattle, Wash. — About all Stanford
defenders saw ot Washington tailback Ster
ling Hinds Saturday afternoon was, well, his
be-hind.
The 5-toot-11,185-pound senior speedster
bounced his way off Cardinal tacklers to 188
yards — the single-game high in Hinds'career
as a Husky and the most by one player
against Stanford this season.
Hinds, who is also a world-class sprinter,
did all this on just 26 carries, an average of
7.2 yards per attempt. More importantly, he
scored two touchdowns, the first on an
electrifying 24-yard run down the right
sideline.
"You gotta be pleased with a performance
like that," said Hinds, who was quick to
credit his supporting actors. "The offensive
line was really opening up holes. I think
anyone can be hot with holes like that.
"Anyone" in Husky talk means running
backs like Jacque Robinson, Ron "Cookie'
jackson and Hinds, a trio of rushers that
would probably start on most teams in the

time and consequently the Huskies have a
"tailback controversy.
All three have started sometime this
season, but Robinson seemed to have the
upper edge going into Saturday's game. The
6-0, 202-pound junior, who in 1981 became
the first freshman ever to be named the
most valuable player of a Rose Bowl, started
against the Cardinal and scored a touch
down before departing with a bruised foot
and giving way to Hinds' heroics.
But just as things seem to get easier for
Hinds, they get more complicated. Every time
the Washington tailback gains one more
yard and bounces off one more would-be
tackier, his summer plans become more
dubious.
Hinds is Canada's version of Willie Gault,
the American sprinter and hurdler who
sacrificed his amateur status and chance for
a medal in the 1984 Olympics to sign with
the National Football League's Chicago
Bears as a wide receiver.
Hinds has a chance to represent Canada in
those same Olympics next August as a
