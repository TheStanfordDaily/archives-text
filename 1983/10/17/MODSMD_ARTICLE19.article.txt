Eddie Murray broke out
of a post-season slump by
blasting two home runs,
Series Most Valuable Player
Kick Dempsey added a solo
shot and Scott McGregor
twirled a five-hit shutout to
lead the Baltimore Orioles
to a 5-0 victory over the
Philadelphia Phillies,
clinching the 1983 World
Series title four games to
one.
Murray entered the game
with only two hits, but
rifled a Charles Hudson
fastball into the right field
stands leading off the
second inning to give the
Birds a 1-0 lead. After
Dempsey's solo blast in the
third, Murray added a two
run shot off the scoreboard
in right-center that sent
Hudson packing and gave
Baltimore a 4-0 advantage
after four frames.
While Murray exploded
in the fifth and final game,

the series was won in
vintage Oriole fashion,
won by lesser known
players named Dempsey
and Dauer, Shelby and
Lowenstein — and lots ot
good pitching.
After splitting the first
two games in Baltimore,
the Orioles swept three
games from the Phillies in
Veterans Stadium in
Philadelphia.
On Friday night, the
Phillies grabbed a 2-0 lead
behind a Joe Morgan
homer and the pitching of
ace left-hander Steve
Carlton.
But Dan Ford cracked a
solo shot in the top of the
sixth to slice the lead in half
and Dempsey ignited a
two-out, two-run rally in
the seventh with a double
carrying the Orioles and
Jim Palmer to a 3-2 victory.
Game 4 was a seesaw af
fair before Baltimore wiped
out a 3-2 Philadelphia lead

in the sixth inning. After
singling, John Lowenstein
went to third on a Rich
Dauer double. Pitcher John
Denny walked in a run and
John Shelby followed with
a sacrifice fly that scored
another, giving Baltimore a
4-.1 lead that they would not
relinquish en route to a 5-4
victory.
Dempsey's selection for
the Series MVP came on
the strength of a World Se
ries record five extra base
hits in five games and out
standing defense behind
the plate that typifies the
blue-collar baseball
practiced by the American
League champions.
Dempsey was also a key
cog in handling the Oriole
pitching staff which
allowed only 12 runs in 10
post-season games and
brought the world champi
onship back to Baltimore
for the first time since 1970.
