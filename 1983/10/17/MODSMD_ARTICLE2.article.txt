# Reagan library: tensions increase as trustees ponder proposal
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
When senior Luke Cole and other stu
dents were peddling buttons at the
Stantord-UCLA football game in protest of a
Hoover Institution plan to place a Reagan
presidential library complex here, they
were surprised to see Hoover Deputy
Director Dennis Bark striding up to them.
But Bark, a leading advocate of the pro
posal, which would bring to the University
a Reagan library, museum and center for
public affairs run by Hoover, wasn't angry
at his critics.
He just wanted to look at the buttons,
which asked the question, "Ronald Reagan
University?" Telling Cole he planned to
give them away to his friends, Bark bought

10 of them at 50 cents apiece and walked
into Stanford Stadium smiling. Early the
next week, he bought 20 more.
A few days later, though, Bark called Cole
into his office for a different reason. Hold

On one side of the debate is the Hoover

expand Hoover s power in the Uni
\ ersity — power which thev believe is
being used tor political ends — at a
time in which the unique relation
ship between Hoover and the Uni
versity is under consideration by the
Board of Trustees.
Both Manley and Anderson have
become public relations otticers ot
sorts. Their offices are like miniature
littered with clippings,
letters and other documents sup
porting their position, all of which
they gladly pass on to visiting
reporters.
And on this issue, unlike mosl
others at Stanford, even those in the
middle are speaking out. More than
200 ot the 1200 faculty members sent
letters expressing their views to the
faculty committee, which was
headed by Economics Prof, lames
Rosse. Seven of the nine members
of that committee submitted per
sonal statements raising issues that
the committee's report failed to ad
dress. What's more, the Faculty Sen
ate is looking into the matter, and
the ASSU Senate will consider it at
this week's meeting.
Adding to the tension is the pres
sure the White House and Hoover
are putting on the University to ac
cept the proposal as soon as possi
ble, and the suspicion that Reagan
has decided that he should have his
own library, museum and public af
fairs center together at one institu
tion. The speculation is that if Stan

ford denies any part of the proposal —
most likely, the museum, the public
affairs center or both — Reagan and
his aides will pack up their docu
ments and memorabilia and go else
where.
In the next two months, as the
Board of Trustees considers the mat
ter, both the volume and ferocity of
the debate are likely to increase. At
tempting to influence the Board,
both sides will try to rally their
forces, attempting to demonstrate
through a petition drive or solicita
tion ot letters that the community is
either wholeheartedly in favor of or
against the proposed complex.
While those efforts are sure to
have some effect, the single most in
fluential factor will likely be Ken
nedy's own recommendation on the
matter, which may be made private
ly or as a belated public reaction to
the faculty advisory committee
report. The Board of Trustees,
which has the linal say on the mat
ter, usually rubber-stamps the view
of the president and his staff, and
Kennedy himself is part of the five
member Committee on the Hoover
Institution, which has been asked to
look into the proposal and report
back to the Board at its next
meeting.
The Committee's work will be
done quietly, often through confer
ence telephone hook-ups linking its
Los Angeles-, San Francisco- and
Stanford-based members. It will be
up to that panel to recommend to
what degree the Ronald Reagan
presidency will become a per
manent part of Stanford University.

center run bv the Hoover Institu

expand Hoover s power in the Uni
\ ersity — power which thev believe is
being used tor political ends — at a
time in which the unique relation
ship between Hoover and the Uni
versity is under consideration by the
Board of Trustees.
Both Manley and Anderson have
become public relations otticers ot
sorts. Their offices are like miniature
littered with clippings,
letters and other documents sup
porting their position, all of which
they gladly pass on to visiting
reporters.
And on this issue, unlike mosl
others at Stanford, even those in the
middle are speaking out. More than
200 ot the 1200 faculty members sent
letters expressing their views to the
faculty committee, which was
headed by Economics Prof, lames
Rosse. Seven of the nine members
of that committee submitted per
sonal statements raising issues that
the committee's report failed to ad
dress. What's more, the Faculty Sen
ate is looking into the matter, and
the ASSU Senate will consider it at
this week's meeting.
Adding to the tension is the pres
sure the White House and Hoover
are putting on the University to ac
cept the proposal as soon as possi
ble, and the suspicion that Reagan
has decided that he should have his
own library, museum and public af
fairs center together at one institu
tion. The speculation is that if Stan

ford denies any part of the proposal —
most likely, the museum, the public
affairs center or both — Reagan and
his aides will pack up their docu
ments and memorabilia and go else
where.
In the next two months, as the
Board of Trustees considers the mat
ter, both the volume and ferocity of
the debate are likely to increase. At
tempting to influence the Board,
both sides will try to rally their
forces, attempting to demonstrate
through a petition drive or solicita
tion ot letters that the community is
either wholeheartedly in favor of or
against the proposed complex.
While those efforts are sure to
have some effect, the single most in
fluential factor will likely be Ken
nedy's own recommendation on the
matter, which may be made private
ly or as a belated public reaction to
the faculty advisory committee
report. The Board of Trustees,
which has the linal say on the mat
ter, usually rubber-stamps the view
of the president and his staff, and
Kennedy himself is part of the five
member Committee on the Hoover
Institution, which has been asked to
look into the proposal and report
back to the Board at its next
meeting.
The Committee's work will be
done quietly, often through confer
ence telephone hook-ups linking its
Los Angeles-, San Francisco- and
Stanford-based members. It will be
up to that panel to recommend to
what degree the Ronald Reagan
presidency will become a per
manent part of Stanford University.
