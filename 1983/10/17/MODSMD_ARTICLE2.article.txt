# Reagan library: tensions increase as trustees ponder proposal
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
When senior Luke Cole and other stu
dents were peddling buttons at the
Stantord-UCLA football game in protest of a
Hoover Institution plan to place a Reagan
presidential library complex here, they
were surprised to see Hoover Deputy
Director Dennis Bark striding up to them.
But Bark, a leading advocate of the pro
posal, which would bring to the University
a Reagan library, museum and center for
public affairs run by Hoover, wasn't angry
at his critics.
He just wanted to look at the buttons,
which asked the question, "Ronald Reagan
University?" Telling Cole he planned to
give them away to his friends, Bark bought

10 of them at 50 cents apiece and walked
into Stanford Stadium smiling. Early the
next week, he bought 20 more.
A few days later, though, Bark called Cole
into his office for a different reason. Hold

the student group Stanford Community
Against Reagan University, for which Cole
is a spokesman, Bark and Hoover Senior
Fellow Martin Anderson angrily pointed out
a number of potentially libelous errors.
That night, Anderson took on Cole and
his group again, harshly criticizing their
motives and work during a discussion at the
American Studies house.

Together, thetwo episodes- onefriendly
one bitter — are representative of the nature
of the controversy over the proposed li
brary complex.
On the surface, some of the debate ap
pears good-natured, and the process seems
to be moving slowly.
Both proponents and opponents or me
plan wear their "Ronald Reagan Univer
sity?" buttons, and agree to speak at dor
mitory discussions about the proposal.
After two months of deliberation, a fac
ulty committee advising University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy issued a temperate
report to which all its members could agree -
a report so vague that both proponents and
opponents of the library complex have
claimed that it supports their case.

Kennedy has had the report for two
v ?eks now, but has avoided making any
p iblic statement .ibout it. And the Board of
Trustees, which will make the final decision
on the matter, has delegated consideration
of the proposal to its Committee on the
Hoover Institution.

and sometimes manifests itself in personal
attacks.
On one side of the debate is the Hoover
Institution, and its primary spokesmen,
Bark and Anderson. They are the most out
spoken advocates of the presidential com
plex, having helped formulate the White
House-backed proposal to bring it to Stan
ford. They believe that the project would

provide the University with a remarkable
academic resource and long-needed con
ference facilities, and charge that most of
the criticism against the proposal is politi
cally motivated.
On the other side are faculty and student

Manley, and students, most of whom have
studied under Manley.
They complain that it is too early for the
University to commit itself to a Reaguri li

memorialize the president and bring a car
