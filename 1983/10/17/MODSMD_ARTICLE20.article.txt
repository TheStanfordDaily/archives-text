# Poloists take surprising second

### ROB ZWEIG 
The Stanford water polo team beat the
University of Pacific (9-8) and Santa Bar
bara (12-10) yesterday to tie with No. 1
ranked UC-Berkeley at the PCAA-Pacific
-10 Tournament in Los Angeles, but the
Cardinal was awarded second place
based on goal differentials.
The Cardinal's tournament record was
2-0-1 while the Bears went 3-1 in the
tournament.
Yesterday's two wins, coming against
No. 4 ranked UOP and No. 7 ranked Santa
Barbara will vastly improve Stanford's
chances of making it back to the NCAA
tournament.
Freshman Mark Imbernino scored with
17 seconds remaining to complete a
furious Stanford rally as the Cardinal
water polo team garnered their second tie
— an 8-8 heartstopper against No. 3 Long
Beach State — in openingday action Satur
day.
It was a touch of deja vu for anyone at
the new Olympic pool who watched the
Card lock horns with No. 5 UC-lrvine ear
lier on Saturday.
Against the Anteaters, Imbernino
waited until just 20 seconds were left on
the game clock before firing home the
tying goal while Stanford held a 6-on-5
man advantage.
The two ties, combined with a less hec
tic 9-3 non-tourney win over UC-San

Diego on Friday, left Stanford with a 7-7-3
season slate heading into Sunday's con
frontations with No. 4 UOP and No. 7 UC-
San ta Barbara.
The Card spotted Long Beach State a
5-1 first-period lead, allowing the 49ers to
take target practice on junior goalie Steve
Moyer.
"Moyer had 10 saves on the game so it
sure wasn't his fault," recounted Stanford
skipper Dante Dettamanti. "We just com
pletely fell apart defensively, especially
our front-court defense."
The unsung heroes who began the
momentous comeback were the Stanford
substitutes. The second unit outscored
Long Beach 2-0 in the third quarter pul
ling the Cardinal to within 6-4 and giving
the starters a much needed rest.
"These two games show we have made
tremendous strides since the Irvine
Tournament (in which Stanford lost to
both Long Beach and Irvine). Long Beach
State is the hottest team in the country
right now and just to be in position to tie
is a step in the right direction," Detta
manti said.
"We've also shown something new,"
he continued, "some depth and the
ability to come from behind," a quality
unusual for such a youthful and inexperi
enced squad.

Stanford was expecting the return of
starting hole man Chris Thompson to add
some depth for the tournament, but he
will be sidelined for another week leaving
Dettamanti with freshman Craig Klass as
the only legitimate hole man for four
games in two days.
Fortunately, players like freshman Greg
Gamble, who tallied twice in all three
games, have picked up the slack. Gamble
and sophomore Jaime Velez combined to
produce four goals in Stanford's 7-7 tie
with Irvine.
The game was typical of a topsy-turvy
tourney where Stanford was a surprising
third after the first day with one point for
each tie. No. 2 UCLA and Irvine were on
top of the heap with three points on the
strength of a win and one tie.
Stanford fell behind 3-1 in the first
stanza, this time struggling on offense.
Dettamanti blamed his team's inex
perience for the slow starts.
"We're a young team and once we
realize that we can play with these people
we're OK. It just takes a while."
The Cardinal must have remembered
their 9-6 trouncing of Irvine last week be
cause suddenly the game was tied 4-4 at
halftime.
After scoring first in the second half,
Stanford kicked back and watched the
Anteaters dig in to take a 7-5 lead late in
the fourth quarter.
