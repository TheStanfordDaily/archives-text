## No. 3 Card spikers beat No. 4 USC 
### TOM MOORE 
After losing momentum in the
third and fourth games yesterday af
ternoon, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team regained control in the
pivotal contest to thwart USC's
comeback attempt 3-2. With the
score tied 4-4 and a vocal crowd ur
ging them on, the women spikers
scored 10 unanswered points to
clinch the match en route to a 15-5
finale.
"The crowd really picked us up in
the last game," said Cardinal assis
tant coach Don Shaw. "This match
really proved that volleyball is a
game of momentum."
The team started out against the
Trojans with a lot of momentum,
running off 12 straight points as
they demolished USC in the first
game 15-3. USC came out ag
gressively in the next contest,
relying heavily on sophomore Ail-
American Tracy Clark, who finished
the day with 17 kills. Stanford won
the tense seesaw battle 15-13.
Ahead by two games, the Card
seemed to relax a bit while USC,
with its back to the wall, stepped up
the pressure.
"We let up a little bit in the third
game while USC played well," Shaw
said. "Clark and (senior All-
American Dana) Smith could be the
premier pair of outside hitters in
the country."
Smith finished the match with 18
kills. With the momentum shifted
to the Trojan side, the women
spikers took the floor for the fifth
game. "We didn't change our game
plan for them (Smith and Clark),"
said Shaw, "but we executed like

we did at the beginning. It was a
good thing we jumped on top of
USC in the fifth game."
Kim Oden led the Cardinal with
22 kills and six blocks. Kari Rush and
Barbara Fontana fininshed with 13
and 11 kills respectively. Stanford's
team hitting percentage was .308
compared to a poor .188 for USC.
Shaw was also quick to credit the
Cardinal bench for the victory.
"USC just couldn't substitute as
well.as we could," he said.
The victory raises Stanford's
record to 11-2 on the year, 6-0 in
conference play. USC holds a 5-2
conference record.
The victory against USC capped a
weekend sweep igainst conference
opponents for the Card. Friday
night the women spikers
demolished Cal State Fullerton 15-1,
15-2, 15-7 in what Shaw called "a
good tune-up" for the USC match.
"We played consistently and played
well," he said.

In a long, drawn-out victory
Friday, the Stanford men's soccer
team easily disposed of the power
less Loyola-Marymount University
Lions 9-1.
Loyola managed to keep the
game close at 0-0 for the first three
minutes but at 3:36 Todd Rafalovich
took a through ball from Giancarlo
Ferruzzi and fired it home for a
quick 1-0 lead.
Rafalovich then scored the next
two goals and yet another in the

second half for a total of four goals.
As if that was not enough, Ferruzzi
cut the cords for three goals while
Robby West and Jorge Titinger
added one apiece.
The rest of the contest was
agonizingly slow. Only 1:34 into the
second half, Rafalovich made a
quick breakaway toward the goal.
"The keeper was late getting to the
ball and I caught my knee on his
hip," said Rafalovich.
The two collided, Rafalovich
scored, and the goalie was left
squirming with pain. Meanwhile
the spectators were squirming with
boredom in their seats while they
waited 20 minutes for the
paramedics to arrive.
The game should just as well have
ended since Stanford was ahead 7-0
and Loyola did not look like they
were going to score seven goals in
one half. Loyola got a bit frustrated
since the team's loss was being
dragged out longer than usual, and
the players began to hack and flail.
"We don't have much skill," said
Loyola's Ted Saluo, "So we just try
to win in any way we can."
Loyola Head Coach Matt kilasala
said, "My boys get physical, but
today I saw them get a little dirty.
Unfortunately, Stanford
retaliated and the game was
plagued with constant whistles
from the officials.
On Monday, Stanford will have a
tougher time scoring against
Portland on the road. Portland has
held its opponents to an average of
one goal per game in the last three
games.

premier pair of outside hitters in
the country."
Smith finished the match with 18
kills. With the momentum shifted
to the Trojan side, the women
spikers took the floor for the fifth
game. "We didn't change our game
plan for them (Smith and Clark),"
said Shaw, "but we executed like

we did at the beginning. It was a
good thing we jumped on top of
USC in the fifth game."
Kim Oden led the Cardinal with
22 kills and six blocks. Kari Rush and
Barbara Fontana fininshed with 13
and 11 kills respectively. Stanford's
team hitting percentage was .308
compared to a poor .188 for USC.
Shaw was also quick to credit the
Cardinal bench for the victory.
"USC just couldn't substitute as
well.as we could," he said.
The victory raises Stanford's
record to 11-2 on the year, 6-0 in
conference play. USC holds a 5-2
conference record.
The victory against USC capped a
weekend sweep igainst conference
opponents for the Card. Friday
night the women spikers
demolished Cal State Fullerton 15-1,
15-2, 15-7 in what Shaw called "a
good tune-up" for the USC match.
"We played consistently and played

In a long, drawn-out victory
Friday, the Stanford men's soccer
team easily disposed of the power
less Loyola-Marymount University
Lions 9-1.
Loyola managed to keep the
game close at 0-0 for the first three
minutes but at 3:36 Todd Rafalovich
took a through ball from Giancarlo
Ferruzzi and fired it home for a
quick 1-0 lead.
Rafalovich then scored the next
two goals and yet another in the

second half for a total of four goals.
As if that was not enough, Ferruzzi
cut the cords for three goals while
Robby West and Jorge Titinger
added one apiece.
The rest of the contest was
agonizingly slow. Only 1:34 into the
second half, Rafalovich made a
quick breakaway toward the goal.
"The keeper was late getting to the
ball and I caught my knee on his
hip," said Rafalovich.
The two collided, Rafalovich
scored, and the goalie was left
squirming with pain. Meanwhile
the spectators were squirming with
boredom in their seats while they
waited 20 minutes for the
paramedics to arrive.
The game should just as well have
ended since Stanford was ahead 7-0
and Loyola did not look like they
were going to score seven goals in
one half. Loyola got a bit frustrated
since the team's loss was being
dragged out longer than usual, and
the players began to hack and flail.
"We don't have much skill," said
Loyola's Ted Saluo, "So we just try
to win in any way we can."
Loyola Head Coach Matt kilasala
said, "My boys get physical, but
today I saw them get a little dirty.
Unfortunately, Stanford
retaliated and the game was
plagued with constant whistles
from the officials.
On Monday, Stanford will have a
tougher time scoring against
Portland on the road. Portland has
held its opponents to an average of
one goal per game in the last three
games.

Last week, after the Stanford Invi
tational, Coach Brooks Johnson
prophesized that if the men's cross
country team kept its confidence
fans would see results comparable
to the nationally ranked women's
team.
At Saturday's Cal/Nike Invitation
al the Stanford squad proved him
right, running to an impressive
team victory on the 8000 meter
course.
Senior Jim Smith led the way for
the Cardinal, placing third behind
Nevada-Reno's Derrick May and
former Cardinal Rod Berry. Follow
ing closely in fourth was Stanford's
Jeff Atkinson while freshman stand
out Marc Oleson placed ninth.
Other Cardinal finishers were
David Frank (11th), Ed Callaway
(17th), Charles Alexander (19th) and
Pat Fox (24th).
As a team Stanford beat out UC-
Berkeley 48-60 with the Golden Bear
Track Club placing third. The Car
dinal exemplified the concept of
team running as the top five Stan
ford harriers finished in a span of 45
seconds.
The Stanford women's team did
not run a full squad due to injuries
but still displayed an abundance of
talent, placing three runners in the
top 10. Canadian sophomore Alison
Wiley finished second, Regina
Jacobs placed fourth and freshman
Cory Schubert took fifth place. Hil
lary Ellin came in 34th.
After losing momentum in the
third and fourth games yesterday af
ternoon, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team regained control in the
pivotal contest to thwart USC's
comeback attempt 3-2. With the
score tied 4-4 and a vocal crowd ur
ging them on, the women spikers
scored 10 unanswered points to
clinch the match en route to a 15-5
finale.
"The crowd really picked us up in
the last game," said Cardinal assis
tant coach Don Shaw. "This match
really proved that volleyball is a
game of momentum."
The team started out against the
Trojans with a lot of momentum,
running off 12 straight points as
they demolished USC in the first
game 15-3. USC came out ag
gressively in the next contest,
relying heavily on sophomore Ail-
American Tracy Clark, who finished
the day with 17 kills. Stanford won
the tense seesaw battle 15-13.
Ahead by two games, the Card
seemed to relax a bit while USC,
with its back to the wall, stepped up
the pressure.
"We let up a little bit in the third
game while USC played well," Shaw
said. "Clark and (senior All-
American Dana) Smith could be the
premier pair of outside hitters in
the country."
Smith finished the match with 18
