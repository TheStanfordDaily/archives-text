High Noon
Members of that esteemed or
ganization that influences policy
both on local and world-wide events
The Stanford Daily editorial board -
should convene for a brief (get it?)
meeting today at high noon. Gary
Cooper and Grace kellv, or their
relatives and or look-alikes, need
not apply.
If you can't beat 'em. . .
Leading a rag-tag band of Daily
staffers, the Chief squared off
against a motley collection of
geriatric journalists yesterday in the
annual Professional journalism Fel
low Daily softball game. When Daily
staffers weren't trying to figure out
who was friend and who was foe
(three P|Fs had to join The Daily
team in order 10 get the game
going), they were racking up runs.
Storekeeper Mary Tuttle had to
bring si! her note-taking talents to

bear just to record the point.
The final score was 20-12 ... in
The Daily's favor of course.
The geriatrics did put up a valiant
effort, with Fran/albert Joku, Kick
/abler and a few others defying old
age and pounding a few hits past the
outfield. Ffarry Press happily
switched teams from inning to in
ning.
In the end, the spectacular
defense of "Fearless" Jeff Biddulph
(no, he didn't write this), Carl (did I
really catch that?) Johnson and
Heather (where's first base?) Millar
were too much for the P|Fs. Maybe
in the spring, guvs.
Comp
No, not as in Harvard Crimson
hell week. This is Comp as in Comp
uter. If you want to learn how to use
The Daily's VDT s, come to comp
tomorrow and Thursday at I p.m.
and 1:30 p.m. Tell them Heather
sent you.
