an asshole in this case First of all. tor him to
say that I m envious of Eddie is just, it's so
ludicrous"
Piscopo is getting worked up. 1 don't
know how to s.iv this so it doesn't sound ri
diculous. but all I ewr want to do is work All
I ever w anted to do was be a television actor
and just be — I'm perfectly content doing that.

Just give me some bucks, man, and let me get
my little farm and 1 11 he tine My family, the
dog and everything that's all 1 ask in life
And to say that st lift about me and Eddie —1(
just really hurt.
"Ratlin# 'stone is a sleaze magazine, and
that for the record Rolling stone is a hip
Scitiottal Hnqunvr it realh iv"
Little Joey, his girlfriend from next door

and \ll Mar, whom Piscopo sometimes i
Neuro-Brain, shamble into the garden I
performer is getting hot in the sun, mod
to move inside.
You know what I reallv want to do'
Piscopo, a man who's about to make a tin
signed to do a comedy album and doi
weekly syndicated radio show called./oc
cn/X) ai /.arm'
I'ltimately, I'd like to produce I've got
whole career pretty much planned out
want to hire the talent. 1 hate being judge
w ant to be able to go out and s.iy to the u
Now this is what we re going to do I
funny But I'll tell sou what, from writit
the show and performing on the show. I tl
111 become a better producer one da\
cause I'll understand all those facets ot n
that's what I want to do.
Piscopo steps into bis house, closes
sliding glass door behind him lie l
around and moves to the kitchen, gr.tl
beer from the refrigerator
Show business," he says, nodding hap;
Show business is my life. Show business

A close look, tit this man does not
fail to produce bis serious side, as
it would seem here. Below, with his
half-a n d-half All-Star.
