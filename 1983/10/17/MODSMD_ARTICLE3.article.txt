The death of homosexual men
from Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) has led some at
Stanford to live more cautiously, ac
cording to gay students and coun
selors here.
"But compared to the Bay Area
gay community, the Stanford gay
community is pretty conservative,"
said Buck Melton, a senior majoring
in electrical engineering.
"If I think I might go to bed with
someone, I would think twice
before I did," said Melton.
Rhio Hiersch, a gay counselor at
the Bridge and a 1985 Stanford
graduate, said concern about AIDS
has affected sexual activity among
some homosexual men here.
"It (the AIDS outbreak) is prob
ably making them a little less likely
to throw themselves into bed on the
next date," Hiersch said.
Because AIDS has killed
homosexual and bisexual men more
than any other group, a number of
gay writers have viewed the disease
as a fundamental challenge to being
homosexual.
"For longer than any of us have
been alive, promiscuity has been
the mark, if not stigma, of our iden
tity. Sex is the gay man's rhythm.

Now we must discover a new basis
for communion," wrote gay colum
nist Richard Goldstein in a recent
issue of the Village Voice.
Although the disease has struck
more conservative, even
monogamous homosexuals, most of
its victims had more than 1000 differ
ent sexual partners, were frequent
users of recreational drugs and had
long histories of sexually transmit
ted diseases.
Melton said the AIDS outbreak
supports those in the gay communi
ty who argue for monogamy.
"I think AIDS may be a signal that
some people are being extreme.
Maybe the sexual revolution among
gays has gone too far," he said.
But Melton and other homosexual
men interviewed by The Daily said
they worry less about AIDS than
homosexual men in cities where
many have died of the disease.
"I think it is true that Stanford stu
dents tend to be fairly serious and
conservative, including the gay stu
dents. I would not consider myself
or my gay friends at risk of getting
the disease," said Doug Bernard, a
fourth-year graduate student in
aeronautics and astronautics.
"I am career-oriented and not a
party type. Those are also accurate
descriptions of my gay friends," Ber
nard said.

Derek Evan, a gay counselor at the
Bridge and a 1983 Stanford graduate,
said no one has asked him about
AIDS so far this year.
"The less promiscuous one is, the
less one is concerned. Stanford stu
dents are not promiscuous," Evan
said.
The hysteria surrounding AIDS
has not spread to the University, but
some homosexual men here said
there have been a number of dis
plays of homophobic behavior on
campus.
A poster for a party sponsored by
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford was defaced recently when
someone wrote "AIDS â€” America's
Ideal Death Sentence" on it, he
said.
"It is in very poor taste to make a
joke about a disease that has killed
2,000 people. Once people under
stand that we're human beings, that
we really are their friends, relatives
and neighbors then maybe they will
be a lot more compassionate," said
Ralph Samuelson, a fifth-year
graduate student in engineering and
economic systems.
Melton said he has seen no
evidence of AIDS hysteria on
campus. Students here are less sus
ceptible to irrational fears because
most of them are well-informed, he
said.
