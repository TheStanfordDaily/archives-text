## FICTION MARVIN the Tin God 
### MICHAEL D. TAYLOR 
Why don't I sell cal
culators anymore?
Well, I do sell this little
number here that's lust

about up to balancing a
checkbook but nothing
more powerful than that

Used to carry a full line Even had some small
computers That's a natural for a bookstore
sitting on the edge of a big university like
Boltneck U But I had a bad experience, and
it got so it bothered me selling the gadgets
to students Put me in mind of selling fire
crackers to three-year olds Vou think I'm
bats? Vou just listen and tell me how batty
I am when I get through
Last year at the beginning of the fall
semester I was standing here minding the
store when a skinny, popeyed character by
the name of Marvin wandered in with his girl
friend. The girl friend was built on the lines of
Dolly Parton except with glasses and lots of
freckles; I found out later her name was
Ginny Marvin introduced himself and ram
bled off into how he was going to be an elec
trical engineer and an Important Person and
how he was a very serious student who really
worked hard and deserved recognition for
the fact, and he didn't understand why cal
culus was a required course for engineers
since he personally knew an engineer who
never used calculus on his job I tried to look
impressed and asked what I could do for him.
I might as well have yelled halt at a blizzard
On and on he went with dark mutterings
about classes stacked with math whiles and
how sincerity counted for nothing and the
unfairness of professors who demanded you
draw a conclusion without first telling you
what it was My eyes glazed over but I hung
in there, and finally it came oui Marvin had
decided he needed something to give him an
advantage in the struggle He needed a cal
culator
It seemed to me he might need a lot more
than that and I tried to say so tactfully, of

course but you know how it is with suine
people So I said, what the heck, and sold
him a ZORX-45 I thought then and do now
that it's an excellent gadget for a beginning
engineering student All the usual arithmetic
functions, of course And you also have
logarithms and exponentials to bases 2, 10
and e, trig functions that calculate from de
grees, radians, mils, and circular furlongs, in

verse trig values, automatic conversion from
English to metric to ancient Jewish units of
measurement (the last very handy in a Bible
study class), and an error message that
flashes on whenever you do something
stupid like divide by Case designed by
Spumoni and made of molded virilium. Mar
vin's fingers started twitching before he
touched it, and I could scarcely refocus his at
tention long enough to get a check from
him
Beyond hoping the check wouldn't
bounce, I thought nothing more about Mar
vin What brought him faintly to mind again
was that a week later we hired Ginny, his girl
friend, as part time help Nice smile, cheerful
person What made me really feel good
about her was that she came to work every
day, on time, and knew enough arithmetic
not to be a slave to the cash register
One day we got to talking and got onto
Marvin He wore that calculator of his
everywhere in a leather case clipped to his
belt and tied to his leg like a gunfighter's
holster Whenever he got together with the
other double F majors and they started moan

ing about calculus or mechanics or whatever,
Marvin slapped his calculator and started
ranting about his equalizer I chuckled at that
and said somthing about the ZORX-45 being
a good model But a couple of weeks later I
found out how little there was to chuckle at
I was opening the store when Ginny came
in all upset. Seemed Marvin had failed a cal
cuius test and was shook up about it. and he

When they walked to
ward him, the whining
rose to a howl.

was coming to see me about the calculator I
said I was sorry for Marvin but didn't under
stand why he wanted to see me Was some
thing wrong with the calculator? Ginny said
she didn't think so and started to sniffle

Having to figure out
something all on his
own - - that was scary.
MARVIN
Naturally I was all at sea, but before I
could learn more, the door opened and
in came Marvin He had bags under his eyes
and looked like an accident victim who's still
m shock I asked what could I do for him, and
he held up a busted piece of junk and
croaked something about the calculator not
being up to its job
It looked as though someone had thrown
that calculator against a wall and danced on
it a couple of times Marvin didn't act upset,
his face wasn't red and he didn't wave his
arms or scream He quietly dropped the bro
ken calculator in a trash basket and shambled
toward the calculator display I followed, hop
ing he wouldn't go berserk, and when we
got there, he insisted I show him everything I
had. I gathered my courage and tried to talk
to him about his problems. Could he tell me
why the calculator wasn't up to its job 7 It did
no good, I couldn't get his attention He just
kept insisting I show him what I had.
Three-quarters of the way through my
stock, Marvin's eyes glazed over and he
latched onto a Morkley-83 Programmable
Now this is a powerful machine. There's a
built-in reference library with the values of
constants like e and pi and formulas for inte
grals and derivatives and what-have you, four
thousand-odd programming steps available,
eighty accessible registers, continuous mem
ory, and a book that tells how to program it
to calculate lunar launch windows, grade dis
tributions, and presidential primary winners
It has a steel-gray finish, upwards of a hun
dred buttons, five functions indicated beside
each button in microscript, and the mass of a
small brick The overall effect is hypnotic It's
really more suited for a graduate student or
professor than your typical freshman, but
Marvin was beyond such arguments He
wrote out the check while I protested.
After he had gone, I asked Ginny what was
this with Marvin And she told me he was
scared of being a failure Which told me
nothing because lots of kids at Boltneck U.
feel that way, but they don't fling calculators
at walls or walk around like zombies. So
Ginny talked some more
Marvin had been a solid A-B student all
through high school. If the teachers told him
to fill in a blank, he filled it in promptly and
precisely Asked to recite memorized figures
and names, he could regurqitate with the
best, and he was awfully good at putting an
X in the proper box Like most of the people
around him, he had trouble if asked to write
more than a phrase, but it was very rare that
anyone asked
Things began to go sour when he got to col
lege He got professors who didn't ask the
right sort of questions
TORMENTER 1 Based on your assigned read
ing and class lectures, why do you think the
Roman Republic collapsed?
MARVIN. Uh, you want me to explain why
it collapsed?
T 1 I want to hear why you think it col
lapsed
M You mean just my opinion 7
T 1 Your opinion, yes, but I trust it won't
be just opinion I trust there will be some
facts and reasoning to undergird it
((>\ IK NKI in Mil 11 All l'lÂ« >( n

M Oh, well, sure, I've got all kinds of
facts I'm the kind of person who likes to
make sure he has all the facts because I think
facts are what's really important in any sub
ject You want to know when Caesar was kil
led 7 Who the next five emperors were? Just
ask me for any sort of fact from the course,
and you'll see I've really mastered the subject
T 1: A crow can recite facts. I want to see
if you can wring any significance from those
facts And now, if you please, my question
about the Republic
M (after a long pause): If I tell you when
Caesar was killed, canl get partial credit?
Not only did his professors ask the wrong
questions, sometimes they wouldn't even tell
him how to do the work
TORMENTER 2 The projectile is fired at an
angle of thirty degrees from the horizontal
with a muzzle velocity of fifteen hundred feet
per second. Neglecting air friction, how far
down range will it impact?
M Which formula do I use?
T 2 I don't think there's any formula in
the text that applies directly to this problem
M Well, how can I work the problem if I
don't have a formula?
T 2 I think part of the problem is for you
to devise the proper formula
M Who? Me 7
T 2 Sure you What's so startling about
that?
M You mean just make up a formula?
T 2 Yeah But it better be the right one
M. I don't think that's a fair question.
T 2: Oh 7 Why not?
M. It took guys like Newton and Einstein
years and years to figure out their formulas
Well, that's okay for them, they were ge
muses, but you can't expect an average Joe
like me to come up with a completely un
known formula ting! just like that
Marvin wanted some
thing from his calcu
lator no mere gadget
could supply.
T 2 Look, you're not being asked to
found a new scientific theory, just make a
small deduction that ought to be well within
your ability And look at it this way: If you're
going to be a successful engineer, there are
going to be times when you will have to solve
problems not covered by any textbook for
mula or technique. Real life is a lot more than
using prefabricated solutions on set piece
problems Sometimes people have to figure
out their own solutions. Sometimes they have
to think about what they're doing. My class is
a place for you to start learning how to do
that
M Okay, okay, you're the boss Don't
argue with the boss So tell me What's the
rule for figuring out new formulas?
Remember the big splash about the
Compos 9 computer 7 The price was amaz
ingly low Especially considering that here
was a gadget that could carry on a conversa
tion with you It had a sort of buzzing voice,
kind of like an insect droning, but, by golly, a
fellow could tell it what to do instead of hav
ing to punch everything in Its physical ap
pearance was roughly that of an ostrich egg
with a little display screen on top and a flat
place on the bottom so it wouldn't roll. It had
a lot fewer buttons than the Morkley I had
sold Marvin.
My salesman's intuition told me this was

going to be a hot item, so I ordered a dozen.
When they got here, I found if you left the
power on, a funny thing happened. The first I
knew about it was when an old fossil of a
professor told me that either his hearing aid
was going bad or else I had a bad case of
mice. I didn't pay much attention, but when
two or three other customers complained of
strange noises, I started wondering and pok
ing around. Well, it was the Compos-9's talk
ing to one another Whispering, really, so as
not to disturb people. I guess they got lonely.
It was weird to hear, but I finally decided to
let it go since it attracted the customers' at
tention and that was the thing I wanted.
My intuition was in superb working order. I
sold every one of those gadgets in days and
would have ordered more except for what
happened with the last one.
The day I was down to one was the day
Marvin walked in the store. Ginny was off, so
this time I didn't have any warning. I was just
tucking a check in the cash register when I
looked up and there he was He looked
worse than last time, and there was some
thing broken clutched in his hand I repressed
a shudder and said, "Another calculus test?"
He didn't say a thing, just showed me the
remains of his calculator, then carefully drop
ped it in the trash Then he jerked his head
toward the calculator display case. I eased
out from behind the counter and led him
across the store, moving carefully so as not to
startle him I tried to talk to him, tried to get
through to him, but he got this funny expres
sion on his face that reminded me of Rock
Clinchwood in a TV movie just before he kil
led his best friend so as to get money for a
fix So I changed my mind and opened the
case
A buz/ing voice said, 'What are you looking
for?" It was the Compos-9 I had forgotten to
switch it off.
Marvin's head jerked toward the voice, and
he said, "Who's that ?"
What could I do? I introduced them
I knew it was a mistake the instant I did it.
Marvin's eyes got wide and I was afraid he
was going to prostrate himself He started
babbling, telling the machine all his troubles,
jumbling everything together and begging for
help I could feel my eyes bugging out No
course in salesmanship or business administ
ration had ever prepared me for this.
Just then a surly character popped up and
dragged me away to look at a defective dime
pencil he was bringing back Marvin and
friend didn't even notice me leave Frantic to
get loose from the weirdo with the pencil, I
finally shoved a whole boxful in his hands,
wrote a note saying to let him have it, and
went galumphing back
I caught the tag end of the conversation
COMPOS: Yes, I can do your thinking for
you, but this is not what I was meant to do.
You must give me something in return
M : Yeah, sure, but what can a computer
want?
Clam not sure you really have one, but it
is whispered among the machines that men
possess this thing which makes them differ
ent from us.
M Okay, okay, what is it?
C I am told that every human has some
thing called a soul
I missed the rest because the surly charac
ter with the boxful of pencils came up de
manding I test sharpen a few before he ac
cept the lot By the time I got rid of him,
Marvin was leaving the checkout line and
heading for the door A box was under his
arm and bliss on his face
I went in the back and had a little some
thing from my secret bottle to steady my
nerves
Ginny told me what happened later Marvin

rigged a harness so the Compos could ride on
his shoulder It went with him everywhere
and constantly whispered in his ear. He im
mediately shot to the top of his calculus class
and all his other classes as well "He was re
ally excited," said Ginny, "really happy. But
people were - you know uncomfortable
with him. It was that thing sitting on his
shoulder and whispering to him all the time.
That's what did it." Marvin gradually lost all
his friends. After a while only Ginny and his
roommate would have anything to do with
him And he began to grow dull Some sort
of spark or vitality slowly went out of him It
got so the only time he could attempt a joke
or even laugh at one was if the Compos told
him what to do, which wasn't often because
it was much better at calculus than humor
The dullness turned to apathy Marvin began
to miss classes, and soon his grades were
worse than ever Meanwhile the whispering
of the Compos seemed to grow frantic
One night as I was closing the bookstore, a
character walked in who identified himself as
Marvin's roommate. He had the Compos-9
with him, and it wanted to stay in the
bookstore overnight It told me it had run
away from Marvin and that the bookstore
was the only home it had ever known When
I asked why it had left, it said, "It's better
than being flung against a wall." When I
asked about Marvin, his roommate told me
he was gone and no one knew where I got
the impression the computer might know
something about that, but it didn't volunteer
anything. I was tired and since the gadget
had no arms and couldn't steal anything, I
said, sure, stay the night
That night there occurred the first incident
of what people around Boltneck U refer to
as "the haunting." Three students walking
across the campus at two in the morning
heard what they described as a "pitiful whin
He had bags under
his eyes and looked
like an accident victim
who's still in shock.
ing" and saw a figure crouched in the
shadows at the side of Mycroft Hall It was
dark and hard to be sure, but they thought
the figure was that of a man on all fours.
When they walked toward him, the whining
rose to a howl, a desolate sound, and the
figure bounded off, still on all fours like a
dog, as fast as a man could run, and vanished
in the darkness between Mycroft and the
Chemistry Lecture Auditorium Since then,
every few nights, sights of a similar nature
have been reported on and close to campus
Some have probably been hysteria and some
must have been fraternity brothers or sorority
sisters pulling legs
M arvin's roommate tells me he never saw
him again After a couple of weeks, he boxed
his stuff up and sent it to his parents
The Cornpos-9 7 It stayed on at the
bookstore. It hasn't anywhere else to go and
sometimes it's useful, like when the books
need going over Besides, it's really a nice
guy Marvelous personality It wears an
overcoat to disguise the fact it has no body,
but someday we're going to rig it artificial
arms and legs (You'd be surprised at the
things electronics companies are coming out
with ) At night it stays in the office and keeps
watch on the place The only unpleasant
thing is that it tells me some nights, when the
wind is gusting down the empty walkways, it
hears a scratching and whining at the door
and thinks it might be Marvin trying to get
his soul back
