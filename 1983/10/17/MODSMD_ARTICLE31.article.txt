Why don't I sell cal
culators anymore?
Well, I do sell this little
number here that's lust

about up to balancing a
checkbook but nothing
more powerful than that

Used to carry a full line Even had some small
computers That's a natural for a bookstore
sitting on the edge of a big university like
Boltneck U But I had a bad experience, and
it got so it bothered me selling the gadgets
to students Put me in mind of selling fire
crackers to three-year olds Vou think I'm
bats? Vou just listen and tell me how batty
I am when I get through
Last year at the beginning of the fall
semester I was standing here minding the
store when a skinny, popeyed character by
the name of Marvin wandered in with his girl
friend. The girl friend was built on the lines of
Dolly Parton except with glasses and lots of
freckles; I found out later her name was
Ginny Marvin introduced himself and ram
bled off into how he was going to be an elec
trical engineer and an Important Person and
how he was a very serious student who really
worked hard and deserved recognition for
the fact, and he didn't understand why cal
culus was a required course for engineers
since he personally knew an engineer who
never used calculus on his job I tried to look
impressed and asked what I could do for him.
I might as well have yelled halt at a blizzard
On and on he went with dark mutterings
about classes stacked with math whiles and
how sincerity counted for nothing and the
unfairness of professors who demanded you
draw a conclusion without first telling you
what it was My eyes glazed over but I hung
in there, and finally it came oui Marvin had
decided he needed something to give him an
advantage in the struggle He needed a cal
culator
It seemed to me he might need a lot more
than that and I tried to say so tactfully, of

course but you know how it is with suine
people So I said, what the heck, and sold
him a ZORX-45 I thought then and do now
that it's an excellent gadget for a beginning
engineering student All the usual arithmetic
functions, of course And you also have
logarithms and exponentials to bases 2, 10
and e, trig functions that calculate from de
grees, radians, mils, and circular furlongs, in

verse trig values, automatic conversion from
English to metric to ancient Jewish units of
measurement (the last very handy in a Bible
study class), and an error message that
flashes on whenever you do something
stupid like divide by Case designed by
Spumoni and made of molded virilium. Mar
vin's fingers started twitching before he
touched it, and I could scarcely refocus his at
tention long enough to get a check from
him
Beyond hoping the check wouldn't
bounce, I thought nothing more about Mar
vin What brought him faintly to mind again
was that a week later we hired Ginny, his girl
friend, as part time help Nice smile, cheerful
person What made me really feel good
about her was that she came to work every
day, on time, and knew enough arithmetic
not to be a slave to the cash register
One day we got to talking and got onto
Marvin He wore that calculator of his
everywhere in a leather case clipped to his
belt and tied to his leg like a gunfighter's
holster Whenever he got together with the
other double F majors and they started moan

ing about calculus or mechanics or whatever,
Marvin slapped his calculator and started
ranting about his equalizer I chuckled at that
and said somthing about the ZORX-45 being
a good model But a couple of weeks later I
found out how little there was to chuckle at
I was opening the store when Ginny came
in all upset. Seemed Marvin had failed a cal
cuius test and was shook up about it. and he

When they walked to
ward him, the whining
rose to a howl.

was coming to see me about the calculator I
said I was sorry for Marvin but didn't under
stand why he wanted to see me Was some
thing wrong with the calculator? Ginny said
she didn't think so and started to sniffle
