### Kiel Stuart Reefs From Rubbish 
Dumping" has a negative connota
tion Nevertheless, it may not always
be bad, especially in the case of SUNY
Stony Brook's coal waste reef project,
C-WARP
As America's reliance on coal in
creases, electrical power plants will
burn more of it But an average
500 megawatt plant can burn over 1
million tons of coal annually, generat
ing 600,000 tons of solid waste How
will that be managed or used? With
C WARP, say Dr Herbert Carlton, di
rector of the project's material test
ing.
The conventional means of coal
*/vaste disposal is landfill dumping,
but toxins can then leach into the
groundwater For power plants near a
large body of water, creating an arti
ficial reef from lime stabilized coal
i/vaste blocks may be an attractive al
ternative, according to project en
gineer Howard Austerlitz The reef
shows every sign of being ecologically
safe, and providing a home for
marine life (which sports fishermen
should appreciate)
The first on-site test began at Fire
Island, September 1980 Now, an in
terdisciplinary research team boards
the 55 foot vessel Onrust on a
monthly basis, conducting a wide va
riety of tests: chemical, marine life
and structural (determining block
strength) For this last, divers attach
to the blocks a test frame containing
electronics, and receive instructions
from operators on board via coded
lights on the frame Soon, a sophisti
cated computer will automatically
take measurements and communi
cate with divers, saving at least some
personnel from seasickness
In the lab, more extensive tests are
conducted on retreived blocks "We
crush them to determine their com
pressive strength, and this allows us
to verify the accuracy of ultrasonic
testing," says Austerlitz "Our testing
is sensitive enough to measure mi
nute changes in individual blocks
from month to month " A paper
presented by Austerlitz and Carlton at
the Oceans 81 conference outlined
this test equipment
"Project results are very promising
so far," says Di Carlton In fact, un
less vigorously attacked by unfore
seen marine organisms, the 500-ton
reef has an expected life of about 100
years No ill-effects have been de
tected to date
A twenty minute film about the
project was recently made by Jeff
Parker To Build a Reel The C WARP
Project was sponsored by the Elertri
cal Power Research Institute and will
be shown at artificial reef conferences
and technological symposiums

Truth is sometimes stranger than
fiction, more than one person who
seemingly "drowned" has been re
vived, saved by the Mammalian Di
ving Response humans share with
creatures like dolphins.

Michigan college student Brian
Cunningham crashed his car into a
frozen pond Trapped under ice for
over half an hour, he seemed a
goner But that icy water probably
saved him Pulled out at last, Cun
ningham looked dead cold, blue,
no vital signs Alert medics, hearing
a cough, started revival efforts and
within two weeks, Cunningham was
back at college, leading * normal
life
It had always been assumed that a
person could spend only a couple of
minutes under water, deprived of
oxygen, before suffering brain dam
age What kept Cunningham alive
and undamaged, the Mammalian
Diving Response, is a natural adapta
tion which permits seals, dolphins
and whales to go about their busi
ness underwater, using a reduced
oxygen supply Oxygen is re directed
from less critical organs, like muscle
tissue, to the command center of
heart, lungs and brain Known in
animals since the 19305, the Mam
malian Diving Response was only re
cently identified in man by Dr Mar
tin Nemiroff, working with the Na
tional Oceanic <2nd Atmospheric
Administration
A critical factor is water tempera
ture the colder the better, to trigger
this response Age is also important,
the Mammalian Diving Response
seeming to be strongest in young
people, diminishing after the late
teens
"An animal needs every trick in
the book to allow him to dive, get
fcjod and return to the surface," says
Gaetano D'Angelo, a New York
physiologist with a special interest in
cetaceans "Marine scientists might
say there's a difference between the
diving response exhibited by ceta
ceans and that of human beings,'
he says, "but there are similarities "

how it feels might ask Hoover

"Life"from Mars and
Beyond
Two startling and separate find
about our solar system and beyoni

are based on isotope measurements
of meteorites Robert 0 Pepin and
Richard H Becker, University of
Minnesota, contend that a meteorite
they've been analyzing has come
from Mars NASA's Donald D
Bogard analyzed the meteorite, find
ing certain gas isotope ratios similar
to the Viking lander's measurements
of Martian atmosphere
Meanwhile, at the University of
Chicago, Edward Anders and Roy S
Lewis have discovered, in another
meteorite, grams of carbon which
they believe came from outside our
snUr svstem

Isotope ratios in a meteorite are
unique to its point of origin, put an
other way, they are the meteorite's
fingerprints
Robert Dodd, a geologist whose
latest book is called Meteorites A
Petroloqic Chemical Synthesis, says
the two discoveries are indeed signif

icant "If the 'Marsrocks' are trom
large bodies, it might prove to be a
way of studying Mars or Venus
without actually having to go
there." On the interstellar matter
"The search for interstellar matter has
been going on for some time We
know almost nothing about how a
solar system is made. We have
spectral data for stars, but we know
little about their mineralogy "
There is a bit of speculation and
some controversy over how the
measurements in these meteorites
were made. Dodd adds, "The in
terpretive side has gone way beyond
the actual observations at this point
But that is usual for this sort of thing
in this field

When scholarly college folk pull all
nighters, and reach for a chemical
helper to stay awake and alert, their
favorite legal drug has always been
plenty of caffeine Now a study by
Ohio State University Medical
School's Dr. David J Dobmeyer indi
cates that caffeine can sometimes
trigger dangerous heart arrhythmias
A new electrophysiological meth
od was used to provoke arrhythmias
in 12 heart patients and seven nor
mal persons When the subjects had
consumed the equivalent of two
cups of coffee, three of the normals
and seven of the heart patients de
veloped arrhythmias Half the sub
jects had arrhythmias of the upper
heart chambers, which are not par
ticularly dangerous. But two subjects
developed ventricular tachycardia
(excessively rapid beats), which could
be life threatening
What does this have to do with a
supposedly healthy bunch of young
sters 7
Dr Edward Brown, Director of
Cardiology, SUNV Stony Brook De
partment of Medicine, explains
"Anything that ups arrhythmias in
creases the risk of sudden death if
you have certain kinds of heart

trouble " Concentric hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (a disorder of the
heart muscle) and mitral valve pro
lapse (in one study, nearly one fifth
of college age females screened at
random had this) are not uncommon
in young adults Some, but not all,
who suffer fcom these disorders can

be detected through regular exami
nation Some need further tests,
such as an echocardiogram (using
sound waves) or electrocardiogram
Though this doesn't spell doom
for vast numbers of students, it

Well, maybe, according to Isaac
Asimov, NASA's Jesco von Putt
kamer and physicist Max Dresden,
who addressed those topics at a re
cent conference on science fact and
science fiction
Computer literacy for all seems in
evitable "A compu.er is an exten
sion of the self," said Jesco von
Pittkamer "Instead of waiting two
million years for an extra brain to
grow, we have one right now Only
it's steel and aluminum instead of
flesh and bone Like the car being an
extension of the legs or the tele
phone an extension of the ears
When you see these things as part
of the self, you become more com
fortable with them But what you
don't use is lost If you don't use it,
you'll lose this sixth or seventh
sense "
Di Dresden also noted the value
of computers in the field of particle
physics, where they will aid in
creased speculation and mathemati
zation
"Robots now are just com
puterized levers," said Asimov "But
they're building personal household
robots tno which will have to be

roughly humanoid in shape, because
the technology of the household is
designed for human shape " Today's

Asimov, "that some government will
