# ROBOTS
## IS THERE ONE IN YOUR FUTURE? 
### THOMAS A. EASTON 
Yet robots do exist today, and by the year
2025 they may fill almost all jobs in manufac
turing, replacing some eight percent of the
present total work force These industrial
robots are not very much like the humanoid
machines of science fiction They are skeletal
things, mere arms They are computer con
trolled assemblies of hydraulic tubes, servo
motors, hinges and bars tipped with claws,
screwdrivers and welders. They fasten bits of
machines and other manufactured products
together, displacing workers from boring, re
petitive assembly line |obs, doing work for
which they can be programmed with a set
series of stereotyped movements
In 1970, there were only 200 such pro

grammable machines in existence By 1982,
the U S alone had 4500 of them, many in
the auto industry, although by the end of
1981, the Japanese had 14,000 in use To
date, there is only one robot in use for every
3000 production worker - , but the potential is
immense Current analyses' say that the pres
ent generation of robots could replace one
million workers The next generation, with
rudimentary srnsing abilities to permit the
machines to adjust the positions of their tools
and workpieces, could replace three million
workers This generation has already been
born It is the third and later generations,
now in laboratory embryo, that will be felt in
2025
As the robot invasion proceeds, there will
be serious effects on employee patterns
Many workers will have less to do Others will
be replaced completely Both groups, and
their successors among today's students, will
have to seek other jobs They may well find
them in areas opened up by the advent of
the robots, becoming computer and robot
programmers and repairers
Is the "Age of the Robot" truly upon us?
Look
* There is a magazine, Robotics Age, just for
hobbyists and engineers interested in playing
with and building their own self controlled
machines
* lowa Precision Machine, Ltd , offers "Mar
vin," a wheeled chassis with a roughly
human shape which one can wire up to make
a robot The options include a speech synthe
sizer
* There is Genus, the "Housemate of the fu
ture," Robotics International's boxy gizmo
that looks like a Star Wars reject. It talks,
grasps, lifts and carries, vacuums the house,
plays video games with visitors, gives kids
quizzes and acts as a smoke and burglar
alarm When it runs out of juice, it plugs itself
into an outlet and recharges its batteries
♦There are "teaching machine" robots Mic
robot, Inc, makes the Teach Mover, which
resembles a miniature industrial robot arm, it
costs a mere $2595 Rhino Robots, Inc
makes the XR 1, an industrial-type arm that
looks as if it were made of Erector set pieces,
it costs $2400, and it can be controlled with
an Apple II computer Accessories include a
Moto Dremel tool hand
* There is even a Heathkit robot, the model
ET 18 Hero I It comes assembled for $2500
and in kit form for just $1500 Its single arm
can carry 8 16 ounces, and it can sense light
and sound It has rechargeable batteries, an
ultrasonic range-finder, and a speech synthe
sizer And it comes with a Robotics Education
Course that is bound to prime the use for an
ET future
Robotics Age, Marvin, Hero-I, the Teach
Mover, and the XR 1 are serious business
They educate and train, and they pave the
way for the acceptance and use of true
robots, as versatile as humans Genus seems
only a little less trivial than the Tasman Turtle,
an automated picture-drawer 8 inches high
and 15 inches across Yet even the Turtle, if it
reaches enough people, will help condition
people to accept the real thing
Just how near are we to seeing that "real
thing?" The robot of science fiction is an in
telligent machine, able to make independent
decisions and defy its programming Artificial
intelligence is a hot topic these days, but Al
researchers are still a long way from living up

to the story tellers Their computer programs
can correlate information, mimic some kinds
of limited conversation, and play good chess,
but they can't fool anyone into calling them
smart True thinking machines are years in
the future, though they are bound to appear
eventually
If we don't yet have to worry about coping
with mental competition from machines,
then how about physical competition? Lack
ing intelligence, machines are limited to tasks
for which they can be programmed They are
displacing human workers from simple, me
chanical jobs, but any worker whose job de
mands a minimum of initiative is safe, for
now
Perhaps we should simply ask how soon
the robot body will resemble the human
Present robots move on wheels How soon
will they have legs? The problem to be sur
mounted here is not mechanical, for working
legs can be and have been built A few years
ago, General Electric even had a prototype of
a walking truck Its human operator wore a
harness that followed his movements and
commanded the truck's limbs to follow them
as well It was not self-controlled
A legged robot must be able to coordinate
its legs, and this problem is not simple Re
searchers have been trying to master it for
years, but their two legged machines can do
little better than shuffle, while machines with
four or more legs can only crawl A free
swinging stride or a trot has not yet been
achieved
One of the more interesting research teams
working on this problem is that headed by
Marc Raibert at Carnegie-Mellon University in
Pittsburgh Raibert began by simplifying the
problem Rather than worry about the com
plications of coordinating several legs at
once, he decided to focus on learning to con
trol balance and stepping with a single leg
The result of his labors looks like a pogo stick
topped with a cage of steel tubing Protected
by the cage are position sensors and hydrau
lie pistons for positioning the pogo-stick leg
The leg itself can lengthen and shorten, con
trolled by compressed air An external com
puter, linked to the leg by a ribbon cable,
controls its actions
The leg works It hops madly about the
laboratory, balancing on its single foot, lean
ing, backing, leaping small obstacles, con
strained only by its tethers
The next step may be to couple two or four
hopping legs in a single structure Then
Raibert and his fellows will be able to work
out how to make them alternate their steps,
shift gaits, turn and balance all the while
Then it will be time to replace the external
computer with a smaller, dedicated piece of
hardware mounted on the same frame that
holds the legs, and Raibert will have a walk
ing machine with its own "brain," a simple
robot Then, perhaps, he will build jointed
legs and produce something a science fiction
fan would recognize
Yet even then, Raibert will have little more
than the skeleton of a true legged robot It
might be the intellectual equivalent of a
lizard The next step making the equivalent
of a human, or even a dog — requires im
mense advances in artificial intelligence It
also, of course, requires great shrinkage in
the size of large-capacity computers, but that
is probably the least uncertain aspect of the
robotic future By the time the programs for
intelligence are ready, the machines to use
them should certainly be down to roughly the
size of a human brain.


The world's favorite (and most
familiar) robots, Star Wars' R2D2
and C3PO (above), are light years
away from being a reality. To
day's robots ar usually just com
puterized arms, although hu
manity's desire to create some
thing mechanical in our own
image has led to decades of
hopeful tinkering. Two of the
latest resutls: Marvin (right) is one
of several robot kits that may be
mail-ordered and assembled by
the ambitious futurist. Among
the available options are 2-plane
head motion, forward flexing
waist, Votrex speech synthesis,
flexing elbow or wrist, and grip
per.


Genus (above), alleged
"housemate of the future," walks,
talks, lifts, carries, vacuums, plays
video games and is a fire, smoke,
gas and burglar alarm. But can it
dance the hootchey cootchey?


Robots are a dream of sci
ence fiction as old as the
field itself. Writers and
readers have pictured
them as human-shaped
machines, equipped with
arms and legs and elec
tronic or positronic brains,
dedicated to the general
purpose, and able to think
— sometimes better than
ourselves. To our great
disappointment, however,
such marvelous gadgets
have remained things
of fiction.
