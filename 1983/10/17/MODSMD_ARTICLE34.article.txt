# COMPUTING
## WOMEN 
### LIZ GANT 
We you've been pulling all-nighters in
the dorm or swapping Cliff Notes, Big
Changes are being made in the business
world out there. The most notable, you've no
doubt heard, is that computers have invaded
nearly every facet of the workaday world Not
everybody is happy about this, mind you
Some tradition bound folks are already well
into future shock, but there are plenty of
energetic go-getters who recognize com
puters are a great opportunity And you
could be one of them
Women particularly stand to gain from
strides in the computer industry because our
chances of career advancement are always
greater in a growing field
Take Ann Bundy for example A few years
ago she emerged from Berkeley with a trea
sured degree in Women's Studies, a specialty
she found hard to market So, while she
kicked around in retailing for two years, Ann
took night classes in data processing She
saw the possibilities in the field, and "low
ered her standards," as she puts it. She
landed a job as an Administrative Assistant
with a tiny new company, MicroPro, that
manufactured computer software in northern
California's "Silicon Valley." Within a few
years, she has held four important corporate
positions, each with corresponding pay in
creases, because she was able to grow as the
fast-rising company did Today she's one of
MicroPro's top sales executives, earning
commissions and bonuses from product sales
Kathy Grant is an education specialist for
Boston's Honeywell Corporation Nina Junco
is a marketing administrative support repre
sentative in the elite IBM office products store
in Beverly Hills Suzanne Krigel, mother of
two, works from her Los Angeles kitchen ta
ble She's president of TCOP, a mail order
computer sales house
Each of these women has found her niche
in an industry exploding with opportunity In
fact, the Federal Department of Labor expects
the million-odd computer specialty jobs like
programmers and technicians to increase by a
hefty 50 percent in the next seven years
alone
Salaries vary widely, depending on the part
of the country you're in. According to Nina
Junco, an IBM employee in say, Salem, Ore
gon might expect to start out making be
tween $12 $15,000 a year, while her Califor
nia counterpart (depending on skills) could
get $20,000
Whatever the starting pay, however, it's
best to weigh the overall opportunity, like
Ann Bundy did, because even though new
jobs are being created, schools are churning
out more graduates, male and female, with
computer knowledge, and competition is be
coming fiercer
Nobody owes you a job," bluntly states
Mike Farmer, programming supervisor with
TRW, an international aerospace corporation
"But that doesn't mean a sharp woman can't

make it In fact, right now, some of the most
creative people in my department are
women They paid their dues and proved
themselves."
Dues paying usually means an entry level
position. In some large companies like TRW
there are actual "apprentice" programs, but
most operations offer:
KEYPUNCH (becoming obsolete) data
entry using magnetic punch cards
DATA PROCESSING entering figures in a
computer system
WORD PROCESSING typing with a com
puter
INFO PROCESSING combination of the
two.
These jobs do not require a lot of judg
ment From them you can ascend to
Women particularly
stand to gain because
chances of advancement
are always greater in a
growing field.
PROGRAMMER creating instructions that
tell computers how to perform complicated
tasks
SYSTEMS ANALYST evaluating the needs
of a company and making sure its computers
fill them
SYSTEMS ENGINEER high level customs
ing of programs to fit a specialized need
ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE selling a "pack
age" of computer and peripheral machinery.
MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR keeping
equipment running
And as computers permeate more and
more industries, new exotic specialties crop
up each day Anita Coleman, Marketing Sup
port Supervisor for Raytheon Data Systems in
Los Angeles, names two; "Systems Design
and Architecture means figuring out what
the actual equipment and all related compo
nents will look like Another hot ticket is Er
gonomics, or the relation of man to his
equipment Its health aspects will be one of
the most hotly debated issues in the
Eighties," Coleman predicts
So, now that you know what's out there,
how can you get it? Nina Junco advises, "De
cide as early in your college career as possible
if you want to get involved with computers
That way, you can take classes as you go
along." She emphasizes, however, "Do well
in those courses' If you took Stat, but failed,
how will you manage in the performance
oriented real world 7
"Take every opportunity to do field work
or an internship off campus," Junco adds
"Not only will it look good on your resume,
but it will show you how things are really
done "

"Many of the grads I see have learned one
narrow area of computing and can't translate
that to anything else," says Mike Farmer
"Say they've learned the Pascal language
Then they'd better hustle to apply that
knowledge to Fortran, if that's the language
their new company deals with "
Kathy Grant recommends continuous learn
ing as the key to success "Every time I
wanted a promotion, I went to night school
or borrowed a machine after work and
learned a new language or system It helps if
you can make friends with someone more
experienced in the company who'll help you
with your extra-hours work And do get
books from the library on elementary data or
word processing "
If the new boom in personal computers
appeals to you, Ann Bundy suggests that you
study magazines like PC or PC World Or join
groups like the Association of Women in
Computing (Bay Area Chapter, 55 Sutter
Street, Suite 44, San Francisco, CA 91404)
For entrepreneur Suzanne Krigel, the key is
versatility "I had a bookkeeping background
before I decided to launch my own business
If you don't know anything about business,
take courses in that too But mostly," she
urges, "take time to learn about yourself "
Mike Farmer agrees. "Take a programming
course If you don't find it absolutely fascinat
ing, then forget it, because programming can
be one of the most nerve wracking things
you've ever attempted If you don't love it,
you'll go crazy "
Anita Coleman cautions that the basics like
speech and appearance are essential too. "A
company is hiring you to represent them So
you've got to come across like you can do it."
Junco suggests, "Go to as many interviews
as you possibly can to get the hang of talking
about yourself And be sure to make the
most of college recruiters when they're on
campus They really do hang onto the lists
they compile during those visits and choose
from them Learn to research your market,'
she adds; "How many women are in the
company, and in what positions? Does one
tend to get moved from city to city to ad
vance' How aggressive is the work atmos
phere? Don't be afraid to interview the inter
viewer, but diplomatically "
Our final tip involves a different kind of re
search Is a breakthrough in computing hap
pening right on your own campus 7 MIT and
Carnegie Mellon University, for example, are
busy developing a brainchild called Lisp If
successful, Lisp may become the standard
language of "artificially intelligent" com
puters that "think" within a limited sphere
on their own Imagine your marketability if
you've worked with a pioneer in this field
Skip a football game some Saturday after
noon and see what the Prof is doing with his
spare time It could be profitable to you
But whatever area of computers you de
cide to enter, remember Kathy Grant's
words: "Competing in the marketplace is al
ways initially harder for a woman Men will
challenge you in every new situation to prove
your worth You have to be determined that
you're not going to do anything halfway "

landed a job as an Administrative Assistant
with a tiny new company, MicroPro, that

years, she has held four important corporate

Each of these women has found her niche
in an industry exploding with opportunity In
fact, the Federal Department of Labor expects
the million-odd computer specialty jobs like

get $20,000
Whatever the starting pay, however, it's
best to weigh the overall opportunity, like
Ann Bundy did, because even though new
jobs are being created, schools are churning
out more graduates, male and female, with
computer knowledge, and competition is be
coming fiercer
Nobody owes you a job," bluntly states
Mike Farmer, programming supervisor with
TRW, an international aerospace corporation
"But that doesn't mean a sharp woman can't

make it In fact, right now, some of the most
creative people in my department are
women They paid their dues and proved
themselves."
Dues paying usually means an entry level
position. In some large companies like TRW
there are actual "apprentice" programs, but
most operations offer:
KEYPUNCH (becoming obsolete) data
entry using magnetic punch cards
DATA PROCESSING entering figures in a
computer system
WORD PROCESSING typing with a com

So, now that you know what's out there,
how can you get it? Nina Junco advises, "De
cide as early in your college career as possible
if you want to get involved with computers
That way, you can take classes as you go
along." She emphasizes, however, "Do well
in those courses' If you took Stat, but failed,
how will you manage in the performance
oriented real world 7
"Take every opportunity to do field work
or an internship off campus," Junco adds
"Not only will it look good on your resume,
but it will show you how things are really
done "

"Many of the grads I see have learned one
narrow area of computing and can't translate
that to anything else," says Mike Farmer
"Say they've learned the Pascal language
Then they'd better hustle to apply that
knowledge to Fortran, if that's the language
their new company deals with "
Kathy Grant recommends continuous learn
ing as the key to success "Every time I
wanted a promotion, I went to night school
or borrowed a machine after work and
learned a new language or system It helps if
you can make friends with someone more
experienced in the company who'll help you
with your extra-hours work And do get
books from the library on elementary data or
word processing "
If the new boom in personal computers
appeals to you, Ann Bundy suggests that you
study magazines like PC or PC World Or join
groups like the Association of Women in
Computing (Bay Area Chapter, 55 Sutter
Street, Suite 44, San Francisco, CA 91404)
For entrepreneur Suzanne Krigel, the key is
versatility "I had a bookkeeping background
before I decided to launch my own business
If you don't know anything about business,
take courses in that too But mostly," she
urges, "take time to learn about yourself "
Mike Farmer agrees. "Take a programming
course If you don't find it absolutely fascinat
ing, then forget it, because programming can
be one of the most nerve wracking things
you've ever attempted If you don't love it,
you'll go crazy "
Anita Coleman cautions that the basics like
speech and appearance are essential too. "A
company is hiring you to represent them So
you've got to come across like you can do it."
Junco suggests, "Go to as many interviews
as you possibly can to get the hang of talking
about yourself And be sure to make the
most of college recruiters when they're on
campus They really do hang onto the lists
they compile during those visits and choose
from them Learn to research your market,'
she adds; "How many women are in the
company, and in what positions? Does one
tend to get moved from city to city to ad
vance' How aggressive is the work atmos

viewer, but diplomatically "

successful, Lisp may become the standard

puters that "think" within a limited sphere
on their own Imagine your marketability if
you've worked with a pioneer in this field
Skip a football game some Saturday after
noon and see what the Prof is doing with his
spare time It could be profitable to you
But whatever area of computers you de

your worth You have to be determined that
you're not going to do anything halfway "

Changes are being made in the business
