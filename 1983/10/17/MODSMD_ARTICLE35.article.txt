### Liz Gant 
Pale romance or khaki survival
or even the übiquitous
sweatshirt. . .

Come Spring, men and women let
loose in updated versions of this sea
son s three premier looks the Flash
dance, Japanese and Survival Looks
If Flashdance is your thing, then you'll
know to choose one of the latest tee's and
slouch shins with mesh contrast at the shoul
ders You'll find them in all sons of nubby
natural fibers like pure cotton and raw linen
And again, in Pure Pales, variations on earth
tones like celery and mustard, or pastels
(even for men) like aqua and lilac Or take it
to the max with mix n matchers in sweatshirt
fabric with oversized necklines, and do wear
them over ankle pants Your most important
accessory will be your best belt Make it extra
long, extra wide and woven, even multi
colored Then wrap, wrap and keep wrap
ping, waist height or over your hips Very hip
If the Orient beckons, then answer the call
in one of the season s continuing variations
on the big geometric look of Japan Choose
one of any number of square, slightly
oversized jackets, paired with tapered, ankle
length pants
Your primarv colors here will probabh be
white, red and black, like the signature state
ment on some of the popular Kamikaze tee
shirts and big dresses One hamburger too
many? No sweat skip the belt «und just add
layer upon layer, with perhaps .1 generous obi
sash at the hip to make the picture complete
I ike the idea ol Survival? Then hit the quad
in one ot the updates on the safari jacket
theme longer and more tapered, with wider
shoulders and epaulettes, these new jackets
are worn over ankle length cargo pants that
have more marvelous snaps and detailing
than ever before
Khaki softened .1 bit ma\ be the color you
choose or something even more primitive
akin to an African print or camouflage suit
When it's warm, go with gauze, in all sorts ol
soft tie-dyed shades, long and loose and
love I \
lor men and women, shoes will be flat flat
for most of das wear, but in interesting fabrics
like canvas and mesh Norma Kainali herself
the designer best known for her sweatshirt
dressing is bringing out a line ol shoes so
extreme, you II either love or hate em! Nor
mas got a fifties \Xedgie shoe in bright blue
suede straight out of a late night black

troversial is a high heeled penny loafer This

per is her Dungaree shoe, made of, you

So, plan ahead Just remember, your body
si/e determines what style you can earn off
well, take a careful kx)k in a full-length mir
ror before you buy No matter what's 'in," it's
out it it doesn't make von look your best
