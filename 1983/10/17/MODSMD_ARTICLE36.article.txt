# KEEPING WARM

### Claire-France Perez 
A Student's Guide to tall
Fashions '83

It hardly seems fair Just when the semester
begins to settle in, the weather takes a dif
ferent turn Midquarter exams and the on
coming chill simultaneously arrive, and the
old stand-by jacket, cardigan or parka is re
moved from winter storage for a new assess
ment. It becomes a familiar burden, hanging
over the chair until class is over, and then on
again into the weather
Tlte problem of course, is that the familiar
favorite, that might still pass as new winter
warmer, starts out the year just a little more
worn and faded than expected. It's as though
the curse of winter also affects last year's
clothes. It's time to take an inventory
A replacement in fall '83 will end up cost
ing between $70 and $200, depending on the
already very tight funding for campus life and
the desire for quality in spite of price To
merely buy cheaply does not guarantee a
good buy The right investment may seem
expensive, but only at first glance To buy
new or to keep the old remains an emotional
issue to spend or not, that is the question.
When deciding on the right purchase, sev
eral considerations should be examined: is
this item to be used for everyday routine, in
eluding weekends and evenings' It it is. then
the expense is not necessarily the only con
suleraiii>n I)ail\ wear abuses clothes beyond
the normal lifetime of ,i garment a disaster
for those who cannot spend evervtime the
need for replacement comes up Keep in
mind a simple rule tor heavy use, bu\ two
for light use, only one is economical. Two
purchases, two separate jackets (although mi
tialh more expensive when purchased all at
once, this is much less costly in the long run)
have greater longevit\ It also means that one
can be in the cleaner's while the other is in
use
Another consideration is upkeep Dry
cleaning is admittedly a quick drain on the
pocketbook, but must be taken as a mainte
nance cost that adds life to vour purchase It
is one thing to have that expensive winter
warmer, but much like anything else, it is
quite another to keep u
A garment s versatility and your life style
are important when making decisions on

purchases If you do a lot of walking outdoors
and a lot of driving, then a longer coat for the
aalks and a shorter, more comfortable jacket
in the car are the solution Design different
uses for differing garments Sitting in a
stadium requires more protection since the
body is still, but activity between classes and
on weekends doesn't require that blanketed
feeling Think about your needs in terms of
what you are doing while wearing something
to keep warm, as well as figuring just how
long you will wear it per day. Even the num
ber of times you take off and put on a gar
ment should be considered. A coat or jac ket
that fights hack will not make your days
easier

Buying two at the same time now solves
myriad problems: going shopping in January
for the same items you saw in September
could be disastrous. The stores are geared for
spring just then, and the jacket/coat/sweater
inventory has been finally sold off in the
Christmas rush and ensuing January sales
Buying two in October — don't wait for .1 sale
