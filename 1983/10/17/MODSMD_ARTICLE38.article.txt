Carbon Footstrik.es on the
Evolutionary Trail

Twentv years ago. most amateur sporting
was done in canvas and rubber shoes
loosely called "tunnies" or sneakers.
But up in laigene, Oregon, a popular track
coach was promoting a new litness discipline
called jogging Hill Bowerman, leader ol the
t'niversitv ol Oregon's powerhouse NCAA
track si|uad, had induced local people of all
ages and genders to trim their frames by
shuttling at moderate pace around a track. It
was a certified trend when Life magazine, in
the Spring ol 1963, sent a camera crew to the
scene. Carding ahead of the pioneer jogging
squads on a flatbed truck. thev also drew
flocks of freshman boys in leather oxlords,
ties and white shirts, eager to make the pages
0 i Life.
Jogging caught on. Hut oxfords didn't. As
the army of run lor vour lifers grew, common
sneakers took the opportunity to evolve.
Puma and \didas, a pair of German linns,
were the major names in track shoes then.
Adidas had made the shoes in which Jesse
Owens won four gold medals during the 1936
Berlin Olympiad. I'uma had been in business
since 19t8, producing the rarilied, ultra light
footwear demanded bv track competition
When sneakers were crossbred with these
track shoes, the results were lighter and more
sophisticated than the former while more
multi-purpose than the latter Thev were
cooler and more comfortable I lies made
sports performance easier, staved off injuries
and generall\ kept one s dogs from barking.
By the each Seventies, with jogging and other
litness activities on a wild upswing, Nike. New
Balance and several other new linns joined
the ranks ol the Germans and those few es
fablished \merican sneaker companies like
Converse and Keds in the running shoe
market. Bv 19 7 2 there were about twenty
models to chose from. Todav there are about
three hundred. The National Sporting Goods
Association pegs sports shoes as a $1.88 bil
lion business annually, according to 1982
statistics. Onlv (only, he savs!) $i2l million is
specificalh spent on running shoes, a figure
that has tripled in size since 1980. Hut the
inajoritv ol all sports shoes is design-related
to our current running shoes Millions ol re
search and development dollars have been
spent bv firms wanting to stav ahead of the
volatile market Choosing a running shoe is
like being in a candv store, savs Angel Mar
tinez, a marathon runner and representative
01 Reebok I rv ing everything that looks good
can be hazardous to your health.
Section bv section, here are some standards

The outer sOk' smacks the ground re

The best are of carbon black rubber com
pounds KV\ (ethyl vinyl acetate) and other
cushionv compounds are also acceptable.
I'hev inav wear more c|uickly. but thev will be
lighter than the carbon black models
Walllc designs are the best cushions
which becomes important when you consider
that each time a running foot lands, its sub
jected to stress two to si\ times the runner's

boilv weight. Hut the waffles wear quicklv on
pavement Pavement is also hard on you. savs
orthopedic surgeon l)r Ivan lliggins of Port
land, Oregon, who has operated on more
jogging-injured ankles and legs than he cares
to remember.
While the waffles are best for grass and
mud, channeled outersoles are the choice for
general surfaces, I'hev allow water to squeeze
out sideways, reducing slippage on rainy days.
But there should be at least a quarter-inch
between channels, or else you mav collect
mudcakes.
Vans, which sells lots of tough sneakers to
BMX (bicycle motocross) enthusiasts, has just
entered the running shoe field with an outer
sole design that's rippled. It looks capable ol
edging you forward a smidgen with each

stride. New Balance had a similar design on
their prototypes ten years ago, but didn t re
taiti it.
The Midsole diiil the We are the thick,
cushiony layer just above the outer sole. Tliev

memon Otherwise they'll gradualh flatten

slightly and rebound immediately I.VA is a
typical component, but it can be softer or
denser depending on how it is compound
ed. Some makers put .1 softer blend in the
wedge and a harder one in the midsole.
I'olyurethane is an excellent midsole and
wedge material, but it is more expensive.
Nike recently introduced a cushioning

Insole Hoard is another, l-ach has its true be
lievers and you may hear arguments favoring
one over the other An insole board is a
semi rigid, loot shaped piece ol either eel
lulose libers or leather dust libers, bonded in
a glue The upper and lower components of
the shoe are glued to it Some claim that it's a
more solid construction, preventing twisting
motion that may injure a foot, but Saucony,
which placed two models in the top live on
last war's Runner's World poll, makes slip
lasted shoes, as do some other respected
manufacturers still others, like brooks, make
shoes with insole boards at the heel for
strength and slip lasted at the toe for llexi
