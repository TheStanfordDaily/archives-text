McFarlane to replace Clark
Washington-President Reagan has informed senior
members of his staff and cabinet that he has decided
to name Robert McFarlane as his national security
affairs adviser, replacing William Clark, administra
tion officials said yesterday.
These officials said McFarlane, now the presi
dent's special envoy to the Middle East, will be ap
pointed within the next few days. "Only the timing
of the announcement remains to be decided," one
official said.
Administration officials said Reagan has yet to dis
cuss the appointment with McFarlane, who is in
Washington, but they said the. president had per-

sonally assured Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger and CIA Director William Casey, both of
whom were skeptical about the appointment, that
their views would be adequately represented in the
White House.
Weinberger, a longtime ally of Clark, was re
ported to be particularly concerned that Pentagon
views would not be forcefully presented to the Presi
dent.
Weinberger was to said to have favored a much
more restrictive use of U.S. Marines in the multina
tional peacekeeping force in Lebanon than did
McFarlane.
Casey, a friend ot ambassador to the United Na
tions Jeane Kirkpatrick, favored her appointment to
the national securitv Dost.
