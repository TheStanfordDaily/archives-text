more restrictive use of U.S. Marines in the multina
tional peacekeeping force in Lebanon than did
McFarlane.

Reagan chose last week as Interior Secretary atter

lames Baker said.
I'm 100 percent convinced that the president will

be a candidate for re-election s.ud Edward Rollins,
the presidential assistant who has been chosen to
run the campaign.
But, said Baker, "in his own mind the president
will not consider himself a candidate until he makes
a formal announcement of his plans to seek a
second term next year.

Reagan friend who will become general chairperson
of the Reagan-Bush 84 committee, will deposit with
the Federal Election Commission the documents es
tablishing the committee and making Reagan, legal

past three years — a kev theme to a new campaign
effort, aides s t iv .On Saturday he said in his weeklv
radio address that "the qualify of American life is

Another U.S. Marine killed
Beirut, Lebanon — One U.S. Marine was killed and
three were wounded yesterday in seven hours of
sniping and rocket-propelled grenade attacks on
Marine positions at Beirut International Airport,
spokesman Major Robert Jordan said.
It was the third consecutive day of attacks on the
Marines and raised the toll of Marine combat deaths
to six since the American peacekeeping contingent
arrived here 18 months ago. A seventh Marine
perished when a mine he was attempting to defuse
exploded.
Jordon said the Marines fired back with anti-tank

rockets and small arms.
He said the dead Marine suffered a head wound,
one injured man had an urgent head injurs and
another was in serious condition with an arm
wound. Tv\o of the injured Marines were tlown to
the Ivvo lima, the main hospital ship tor the IfoOO
person \merican force, and the third was treated on
shore, said Jordan.
•\t one point, lordan reported that five Marines
had been wounded, but he later corrected that to
three.
None of the Marines was immediateK identified.
\ total ot ">4 have been wounded in the past 1H
months.
On Friday and Saturda\ snipers concentrated on
the Marine positions at the opposite end of the air
port. One Marine was killed and another wounded
in both legs hidav but there were no American
casualties Saturday.
Attacks also were reported against Lebanese army
positions on the mountain ridgeline above the U.S.
Marine camp, and the government-run television
said one Lebanese army soldier was killed by ar
tiller\ tire from positions held by the Dru/e militia.
Renewed lighting was reported in the kharoub
region, just above the Israeli defense line along
southern Lebanon s Awali River, where Christian
and Dru/e militia have been fighting for days.
Shamir pursues cautious policies
Jerusalem — In one of his first decisions after be
coming Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir
vetoed an army plan to cut off Israeli-occupied
southern Lebanon from the rest of the turbulent
country by closing the Awali River bridges.
According to a senior official close to Shamir, the
prime minister agreed with the army's argument that
closing the bridges would increase the security of

Israeli troops but concluded that the political costs
outweighed the military benelits. The move would
look too much like an Israeli-engineered partition ot
Lebanon among toreign powers to he acceptable to
the United States and the rest ot the world, Shamir
dec ided.
The decision illustrates Shamir's approach to
toreign policy. In contrast to tormer Prime Minister
Menachem begin, Shamir is more sensitive to world
opinion and less willing to gi\e the generals a tree
hand in making strategic decisions. His policies in
I ebanon are likely to reflect tins caution.
Despite his years as an underground leader who
would stop at nothing to advance the 1 cause ot a
Jewish homeland, Shamir has mellowed into a
statesman who prefers to avoid unnecessary risks.
I don't think you will see anything as adven
turesome as during Begin s regime, said the senior
official, who asked not to be identified by name.
Shamir is a verv cautious man by nature. He will
weigh seven times anything that could lead to a mili
tary showdown."
For the time being, Shamir has decided to soft
pedal his differences with Begin. The new prime
minister, who served as foreign minister in the Begin
government, has insisted that his primary objective
is continuity. In his first speech to parliament as go
vernment leader, he paid lavish praise to Begin,
describing him as "the man who tor 40 years had
stood at the center of Jewish history as it unfolded
before our eyes."

Partly cloudy today with local morning tog. Highs

Another U.S. Marine killed
Beirut, Lebanon — One U.S. Marine was killed and
three were wounded yesterday in seven hours of
sniping and rocket-propelled grenade attacks on
Marine positions at Beirut International Airport,
spokesman Major Robert Jordan said.
It was the third consecutive day of attacks on the
Marines and raised the toll of Marine combat deaths
to six since the American peacekeeping contingent
arrived here 18 months ago. A seventh Marine
perished when a mine he was attempting to defuse
exploded.
Jordon said the Marines fired back with anti-tank

rockets and small arms.
He said the dead Marine suffered a head wound,
one injured man had an urgent head injurs and
another was in serious condition with an arm
wound. Tv\o of the injured Marines were tlown to
the Ivvo lima, the main hospital ship tor the IfoOO
person \merican force, and the third was treated on
shore, said Jordan.
•\t one point, lordan reported that five Marines
had been wounded, but he later corrected that to
three.
None of the Marines was immediateK identified.
\ total ot ">4 have been wounded in the past 1H
months.
On Friday and Saturda\ snipers concentrated on
the Marine positions at the opposite end of the air
port. One Marine was killed and another wounded
in both legs hidav but there were no American
casualties Saturday.
Attacks also were reported against Lebanese army
positions on the mountain ridgeline above the U.S.
Marine camp, and the government-run television
said one Lebanese army soldier was killed by ar
tiller\ tire from positions held by the Dru/e militia.
Renewed lighting was reported in the kharoub
region, just above the Israeli defense line along
southern Lebanon s Awali River, where Christian
and Dru/e militia have been fighting for days.
Shamir pursues cautious policies
Jerusalem — In one of his first decisions after be
coming Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir
vetoed an army plan to cut off Israeli-occupied
southern Lebanon from the rest of the turbulent
country by closing the Awali River bridges.
According to a senior official close to Shamir, the
prime minister agreed with the army's argument that
closing the bridges would increase the security of

Israeli troops but concluded that the political costs
outweighed the military benelits. The move would
look too much like an Israeli-engineered partition ot
Lebanon among toreign powers to he acceptable to
the United States and the rest ot the world, Shamir
dec ided.
The decision illustrates Shamir's approach to
toreign policy. In contrast to tormer Prime Minister
Menachem begin, Shamir is more sensitive to world
opinion and less willing to gi\e the generals a tree
hand in making strategic decisions. His policies in
I ebanon are likely to reflect tins caution.
Despite his years as an underground leader who
would stop at nothing to advance the 1 cause ot a
Jewish homeland, Shamir has mellowed into a
statesman who prefers to avoid unnecessary risks.
I don't think you will see anything as adven
turesome as during Begin s regime, said the senior
official, who asked not to be identified by name.
Shamir is a verv cautious man by nature. He will
weigh seven times anything that could lead to a mili
tary showdown."
For the time being, Shamir has decided to soft
pedal his differences with Begin. The new prime
minister, who served as foreign minister in the Begin
government, has insisted that his primary objective
is continuity. In his first speech to parliament as go
vernment leader, he paid lavish praise to Begin,
describing him as "the man who tor 40 years had
stood at the center of Jewish history as it unfolded
before our eyes."

McFarlane to replace Clark
Washington-President Reagan has informed senior
members of his staff and cabinet that he has decided
to name Robert McFarlane as his national security
affairs adviser, replacing William Clark, administra

cuss the appointment with McFarlane, who is in
Washington, but they said the. president had per-

sonally assured Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger and CIA Director William Casey, both of
whom were skeptical about the appointment, that
their views would be adequately represented in the
White House.
Weinberger, a longtime ally of Clark, was re
ported to be particularly concerned that Pentagon
views would not be forcefully presented to the Presi
dent.
Weinberger was to said to have favored a much
more restrictive use of U.S. Marines in the multina
tional peacekeeping force in Lebanon than did
McFarlane.
Casey, a friend ot ambassador to the United Na
tions Jeane Kirkpatrick, favored her appointment to
the national securitv Dost.
