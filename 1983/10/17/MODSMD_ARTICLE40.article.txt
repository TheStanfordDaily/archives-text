part of last year diligently touring the States,
bringing their spacey but-danceable techno
rock to large and small audiences And. in

The Flock came together in Liverpool at the

his wav as a hairdresser) hail served as bassist

what on the* outside of the hip British music
circles at the statu. During the hand s early pc
riod, the since laded New Romantic move
ment was the chic development in I k rock.
In contrast to its foppish exponents (includ
ing Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet). a Flock
of Seagulls played with an aggressive edge.
"We'd go out and play with a New Romantic
hand, says Score, and we'd let loose with
this Horrendously powerful sound and thev'd
come up with (his wimpy little thin-White Boy
sound. We'd seem really outrageous, because
it wasn't a fashionable thing back then.
If the Flock's energized approach disturbed
the New Romantics' sense of cool, it poised
the group for success across the Atlantic.
American rock fanciers are .1 lighter hearted
lot than their British counterparts Morose,
brooding bands such as Kclio and the Bun
nymen anil New Order do well in the I K
but have never found equal favor here
"There's a lot of British bands that wouldn't
have done anything in America it we hadn't
come here and toured as much as wv did,'
Store leels. 'We won over a lot ol people by
playing live anil that served as an advertise
ment Ibr new I'.nglish bands. Duran Duran
tried for a year to break in the States, but they
couldn't until we had an album in the Top
Ten here
There are a few dark undercurrents in
the Flock's songs I* veil a group as
technologicallv inclined as ihc\ recognizes
the dangers of science out of control Man
Made, from their ilebul I.l' \ Ihu h i>J s' at
Hulls, is a warning about the misuse ol the
machine The same applies to advances in
music, says Score: "If you can use technology
creatively, it's good if it uses you. it's bail."
I laild in hand with the band's interest in
musical advancements is .1 love Ibr science
fiction, especiallv in films. While their fixation
on extraterrestrial phenomena might've been
too bizarre for the public in the past, the cur
rent mass appetite for outer space movie
epics makes the Flock's songs quite in step
with the times Kverybody wants to believe
in (King saucers nowadavs," savs Store.
"When they go to ,i science fiction film. they
want to est ape into it. to let it saturate them.
It's the same thing when they hear our
music
Score's lyrics often personih (and
eroticize) his cosniii themes I mention to
him that "I Ran, Space Age l.ove Song" ami
Wishing all depict goddess-like women who
visit male earthlings. only to prow elusive in
the end. I find it easy to sing about that, he
acknowledges, "fhe woman in those songs is
a dream woman, always in the mind but
never in the flesh. You always want the one
you can't get, I guess
Does the band worn that such private fan
tasies might be lost on the public That
doesn't concern me at all," Score responds.
I'm sure we've done songs that have com
pletely different meanings to the people who
listen to them than they do to us That's why
we don't put lyric sheets in our albums if
you actually put the words down, maybe it'll
ruin someone's ideas ol what the songs are
about You've got to make people feel things,
not just put it all out on a plate for them
Right now, a Flock ol Seagulls is perceived
as primarily a dance band, but Score doesn't
guarantee they II siav that way We're getting
more Into atmospheric stuff with listen (their
latest allium) We're still developing I think
it takes a band live to ten years to develop a
special way ol playing and recording Record
companies want you to do your hits over anil
over again Sometimes, you have to forget
about success to progress musically
