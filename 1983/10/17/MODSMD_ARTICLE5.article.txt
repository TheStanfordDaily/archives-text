# Medicare legislation may cause problems for Hospital

New Medicare legislation will have a strong impact
on the Stanford Hospital, forcing officials to cut
costs and seek ways to avoid negative repercussions
for long-term research, administrators there say.
Under the new legislation, which took effect Oct.
1, a fixed sum is allocated to Medicare recipients
suffering from a specific illness — regardless of the
actual cost of treatment. This offers a profit to hospi
tals that can provide service at a lower cost.
The intent was to lower the cost of treating
Medicare recipients, who are generally elderly.
But critics fear that the system will encourage
hospitals across the country to use cheaper equip
ment or to discharge patients before they have
recovered completely.

The system divides illnesses into specific
categories, or diagnostically related groups (DRGs),
and assigns each group a flat reimbursement rate for
hospital costs.
Hospital Chief of Staff James Silverman called the
DRG method a "slick way of tying diagnoses and
procedures together, but probably not a good way
to fund health care."
According to Silverman, the central problem with
the DRG method is that it aggregates individual
patients into groups according to their illness, and
"different patients become the same." In using ob
jective data to calculate the average cost of a particu
lar treatment, the DRG makes no allowances for
severity of illness.
Yet the severity of illness does vary, producing a

range of actual costs that differ greatly from the
average cost. For example, the Hospital will receive
the same amount of money for two Medicare gall
bladder operations, although one patient may leave
the hospital in a relatively short period of time, while
the second, sicker patient may require more sophis
ticated equipment and more recovery time — making
for a substantially greater cost.
Theoretically, the less- and more-afflicted patients
will balance out, so that the eventual average costs
meet the DRC reimbursement.
But teaching hospitals like Stanford conduct much
of their research on severe cases, thus skewing the
balance.
"We often get a patient who is sicker," explained
David Sakai, the Hospital's director of finance. "We
treat patients who consume more resources."

Critics complain that the legislation will harm sick
er patients who need more care by encouraging
doctors to release them early.
Vet for Stanford Hospital, which deals routinely
with sicker patients, the changes pose not the prob
lem of physician negligence, but rather the chal
lenge of cutting costs to meet DRG standards, offi
cials say. The hospital must ensure that innovation
and research do not suffer in the process.
"I don't think that physicians are going to start
changing the way they practice," said Sakai. "I think
that we can render the same care more efficiently."
An increase in efficiency could occur in part of the
Hospital's broad spectrum of activities. Sakai em-

phasized that hospital management
must work with physicians to
"identify ways that we can utilize re
sources more efficiently."
Yet others feel that while
Medicare may prompt more effi
ciency in the wards, it should also
force an investigation into the effi
ciency of hospital administration.
A doctor, who asked to remain
unidentified, charged that the ad
ministration has "a way of systemati
cally building inefficiency in the sys
tem" by "protecting their own
flank." He stressed that as part of
cost-cutting actions "the administra
tive hierarchy and all the nonsense
such as workers and pharmaceuti
cals also has to be attacked.
Perhaps the greatest victim ot the
efforts to cut costs will be hospital
innovation in the introduction of
new technology and in clinical re
search, according to officials. New
technology, although producing a
better outcome in the treatment of
patients, greatly increases the costs,
and the equipment and need for
trained employees places a tinancial
burden on the Hospital.
According to the officials, the
Medicare legislation, by alloting
only a fixed sum for the treatment,
puts a disincentive on the use of so
phisticated, more expensive equip
ment that may help treat a patient
more effectively. "Medicare doesn't
pay on the basis of better outcome,"
said Sakai.
Silverman pointed out that the
Hospital in the future might be able

to afford to introduce only new
replacement equipment that would
save money.
As for clinical research, Silverman
admits to "possibly a decline" it the
hospital cannot find alternative re
sources to fund sicker Medicare
patients.
The DRG system penalizes Stan
ford in particular since its area of ex
pertise consists of clinical research
and the introduction of new tech
nology. Because Medicare
recipients constitute 25 percent of
the Hospital's total patient popula
tion, funds for these endeavors will
be cut back sharply.
According to Silverman, the
legislation couldn't have come at a
worse time. Recent developments in
insurance payment methods to
hospitals will complicate the efforts
to meet DRG standards and to
protect hospital research.
Silverman explained that
Medicare always had covered only
the costs of treatment, thus not
reimbursing the hospital for what it
would charge a patient. Usually the
hospital utilized the difference be
tween costs and charges to fund
hospital improvements like renova
tion and the development of new
equipment.
Traditionally, the hospital has in
creased the private sector charges in
order to cover the patients whose
costs are covered by Medicare. Yet
now in response to skyrocketing in
surance rates, many insurance com
panies have introduced a system of
prospective reimbursement, allow
ing them to negotiate with the
hospitals and achieve lower rates.
The result, Silverman said, will be
to place "serious constraints on the
Hospital."

said Sakai.
Silverman pointed out that the
Hospital in the future might be able

to afford to introduce only new
replacement equipment that would
save money.
As for clinical research, Silverman
admits to "possibly a decline" it the
hospital cannot find alternative re
sources to fund sicker Medicare
patients.
The DRG system penalizes Stan
ford in particular since its area of ex
pertise consists of clinical research
and the introduction of new tech
nology. Because Medicare
recipients constitute 25 percent of
the Hospital's total patient popula
tion, funds for these endeavors will
be cut back sharply.
According to Silverman, the
legislation couldn't have come at a
worse time. Recent developments in
insurance payment methods to
hospitals will complicate the efforts
to meet DRG standards and to
protect hospital research.
Silverman explained that
Medicare always had covered only
the costs of treatment, thus not
reimbursing the hospital for what it
would charge a patient. Usually the
hospital utilized the difference be
tween costs and charges to fund
hospital improvements like renova
tion and the development of new
equipment.
Traditionally, the hospital has in
creased the private sector charges in
order to cover the patients whose
costs are covered by Medicare. Yet
now in response to skyrocketing in
surance rates, many insurance com
panies have introduced a system of
prospective reimbursement, allow
ing them to negotiate with the
hospitals and achieve lower rates.
The result, Silverman said, will be
to place "serious constraints on the
Hospital."

New Medicare legislation will have a strong impact
on the Stanford Hospital, forcing officials to cut
costs and seek ways to avoid negative repercussions
for long-term research, administrators there say.
Under the new legislation, which took effect Oct.
1, a fixed sum is allocated to Medicare recipients
suffering from a specific illness — regardless of the
actual cost of treatment. This offers a profit to hospi
tals that can provide service at a lower cost.
The intent was to lower the cost of treating
Medicare recipients, who are generally elderly.
But critics fear that the system will encourage
hospitals across the country to use cheaper equip
ment or to discharge patients before they have
recovered completely.

The system divides illnesses into specific
categories, or diagnostically related groups (DRGs),
and assigns each group a flat reimbursement rate for
hospital costs.
Hospital Chief of Staff James Silverman called the
DRG method a "slick way of tying diagnoses and
procedures together, but probably not a good way
to fund health care."
According to Silverman, the central problem with
the DRG method is that it aggregates individual
patients into groups according to their illness, and
"different patients become the same." In using ob
jective data to calculate the average cost of a particu
lar treatment, the DRG makes no allowances for
severity of illness.
Yet the severity of illness does vary, producing a

range of actual costs that differ greatly from the
average cost. For example, the Hospital will receive
the same amount of money for two Medicare gall
bladder operations, although one patient may leave
the hospital in a relatively short period of time, while
the second, sicker patient may require more sophis
ticated equipment and more recovery time — making
for a substantially greater cost.
Theoretically, the less- and more-afflicted patients
will balance out, so that the eventual average costs
meet the DRC reimbursement.
But teaching hospitals like Stanford conduct much
of their research on severe cases, thus skewing the
balance.
"We often get a patient who is sicker," explained
David Sakai, the Hospital's director of finance. "We
treat patients who consume more resources."

Critics complain that the legislation will harm sick
er patients who need more care by encouraging
doctors to release them early.
Vet for Stanford Hospital, which deals routinely
with sicker patients, the changes pose not the prob
lem of physician negligence, but rather the chal
lenge of cutting costs to meet DRG standards, offi
cials say. The hospital must ensure that innovation
and research do not suffer in the process.
"I don't think that physicians are going to start
changing the way they practice," said Sakai. "I think
that we can render the same care more efficiently."
An increase in efficiency could occur in part of the
Hospital's broad spectrum of activities. Sakai em-

phasized that hospital management
must work with physicians to
"identify ways that we can utilize re
sources more efficiently."
Yet others feel that while
Medicare may prompt more effi
ciency in the wards, it should also
force an investigation into the effi
ciency of hospital administration.
A doctor, who asked to remain
unidentified, charged that the ad
ministration has "a way of systemati
cally building inefficiency in the sys
tem" by "protecting their own
flank." He stressed that as part of
cost-cutting actions "the administra
tive hierarchy and all the nonsense
such as workers and pharmaceuti
cals also has to be attacked.
Perhaps the greatest victim ot the
efforts to cut costs will be hospital
innovation in the introduction of
new technology and in clinical re
search, according to officials. New
technology, although producing a
better outcome in the treatment of
patients, greatly increases the costs,
and the equipment and need for
trained employees places a tinancial
burden on the Hospital.
According to the officials, the
Medicare legislation, by alloting
only a fixed sum for the treatment,
puts a disincentive on the use of so
phisticated, more expensive equip
ment that may help treat a patient
more effectively. "Medicare doesn't
pay on the basis of better outcome,"
