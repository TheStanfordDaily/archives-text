# Medicare legislation may cause problems for Hospital

New Medicare legislation will have a strong impact
on the Stanford Hospital, forcing officials to cut
costs and seek ways to avoid negative repercussions
for long-term research, administrators there say.
Under the new legislation, which took effect Oct.
1, a fixed sum is allocated to Medicare recipients
suffering from a specific illness — regardless of the
actual cost of treatment. This offers a profit to hospi
tals that can provide service at a lower cost.
The intent was to lower the cost of treating
Medicare recipients, who are generally elderly.
But critics fear that the system will encourage
hospitals across the country to use cheaper equip
ment or to discharge patients before they have
recovered completely.

The system divides illnesses into specific
categories, or diagnostically related groups (DRGs),
and assigns each group a flat reimbursement rate for
hospital costs.
Hospital Chief of Staff James Silverman called the
DRG method a "slick way of tying diagnoses and
procedures together, but probably not a good way
to fund health care."
According to Silverman, the central problem with
the DRG method is that it aggregates individual
patients into groups according to their illness, and
"different patients become the same." In using ob
jective data to calculate the average cost of a particu
lar treatment, the DRG makes no allowances for
severity of illness.
Yet the severity of illness does vary, producing a

range of actual costs that differ greatly from the
average cost. For example, the Hospital will receive
the same amount of money for two Medicare gall
bladder operations, although one patient may leave
the hospital in a relatively short period of time, while
the second, sicker patient may require more sophis
ticated equipment and more recovery time — making
for a substantially greater cost.
Theoretically, the less- and more-afflicted patients
will balance out, so that the eventual average costs
meet the DRC reimbursement.
But teaching hospitals like Stanford conduct much
of their research on severe cases, thus skewing the
balance.
"We often get a patient who is sicker," explained
David Sakai, the Hospital's director of finance. "We
treat patients who consume more resources."

Critics complain that the legislation will harm sick
er patients who need more care by encouraging
doctors to release them early.
Vet for Stanford Hospital, which deals routinely
with sicker patients, the changes pose not the prob
lem of physician negligence, but rather the chal
lenge of cutting costs to meet DRG standards, offi
cials say. The hospital must ensure that innovation
and research do not suffer in the process.
"I don't think that physicians are going to start
changing the way they practice," said Sakai. "I think
that we can render the same care more efficiently."
An increase in efficiency could occur in part of the
Hospital's broad spectrum of activities. Sakai em-
