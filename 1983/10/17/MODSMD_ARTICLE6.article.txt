William Clark, President Reagan's
national security adviser, has been
named to succeed lames Watt as inte
rior secretary in a move that signals a
shakeup in the administration's
foreign policy apparatus.
Reagan's decision to appoint
Clark, who the president described

as a "God-fearing Westerner" at the
initial announcement before a
group of evangelical church wo
men, caught even his top aides by
surprise and could lead to heated
debate in Senate confirmation
hearings.
White House spokesman Larry

Speakes conceded that Clark lacks
direct experience with energy devel
opment and pollution issues, but
expressed confidence that the
foreign pMicy adviser's hands-on
knowledge of ranching and the
West enables him "to know the
problems" that confront "people

who love the outdoors."
Some of Clark's colleagues sugges
ted that the interior appointment,
which at first glance appeared to be
a step-down in the Reagan
hierarchy, appealed to Clark be
cause it might offer respite from the
hard work and long hours at the na-

tional security post, according to
The Wall Street Journal.
Clark's successor has prompted a
range of speculation from various
Washington sectors and some con
flict within the administration, but
Reagan seems to be leaning toward
Clark's deputy, Robert McFarlane.
Others have suggested that U.N.
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick is a
possible c hoice for the post.
Washington analysts contend that
Clark's departure is likely to push
foreign policy away from hawkish
conservative ideology and closer to
Secretary ot State George Shultz's
more pragmatic approach. Friction
between Clark and Shultz has been
a source of disharmony in Reagan's
foreign policy strategy.

The Soviet Union may soon suspend
arms control negotiations with the
United States if NATO follows
through with the planned Decem
ber deployment of Pershing II and
cruise missiles in Europe.
A senior Reagan administration
official suggested the possibility of a
Soviet "walkout" at the the Inter
mediate Nuclear Force (IMF)
negotiations and the concurrent
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
(START) in Geneva, possibly as early
as Wednesday. Other officials said
they expected a less dramatic move,
but noted that the administration is
"preparing for any contingency."
"We are not flagging in our inter
est in getting an agreement," a State
Department spokesman said, ad
ding that "if the Russians quit the
talks, the blame has to pinned right
on them."
There has been no significiant
progress since the current round of
negotiations resumed Sept. 6, ac
cording to chief American
negotiator Paul Nitze. The Soviets
refuse to accept any proposal that
allows the United States to deploy
any of the new missiles and insists
instead on maintaining at least 162
SS-20 missiles, to match the total
number of missiles currently
deployed in France and England.
NATO has rejected this inclusion
of French and British missiles.

If no arms accord is reached
before December, the Soviets may
launch a major campaign to try to
persuade Europeans to oppose the
planned American missile deploy
ment. Such a move might augment
major anti-nuclear rallies scheduled
to begin this week in West Ger
many.

The disclosure of a radical plan to
link Israel's entire ec onomy to the U.S.
dollar in order to halt the spiral of
triple-digit inflation prompted the
resignation ot Israeli Finance Mini
ster Yoram Aridor.
Part of the proposal, which was
reported Thursday in the lerusalem
newspaper Vediot Ahronot, sugges
ted that American currency be es
tablished as Israeli legal tender. Crit
ics charged that such a move might
jeopardize Israel's ability to create
its own monetary and economic
policies, leading to increased de
pendency on the United States.
The government ot Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, which assumed
power on Monday, sought to
reassure the public that the Aridor
plan was "never open tor discus
sion."

Eighty-one-year-old American
botanist Barbara McClintock was
awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine
for her work in genetics.
The faculty ot Sweden's
Karolinska Institute said it selected
McClintock for the $190,000 prize
mainly for her 1951 discovery of
moveable genes in Indian corn — a
largely ignored discovery that
became a key factor in the genetic
revolution two decades later.
In other Nobel news, the Polish
government said Tuesday that most
Poles were embarrassed by the
awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize
to Lech Walesa, founder of the
Solidarity labor movement.
The official Polish government
spokesman called the award "simply
one ot the bonuses or incentives
received from the West by those
Polish citizens who harbor
destructive attitudes about their
own country's interests."

A terrorist bomb apparently in
tended for South Korean President
Chun Doo-Hwan exploded at a
memorial site in Rangoon, Burma,
killing tour ot his cabinet ministers,

the South Korean ambassador to
Burma and several top aides.
Seventeen South Koreans and
three Burmese journalists died in
the blast, just minutes before Chun
a/rived for a ceremony at the start of
a scheduled 18-day presidential

goodwill tour. The bombing
devasted the senior leadership ot
Chun's government, prompting the
delegation to immediately cancel
the trip and return to Seoul.
Burmese security agents captured
one suspected terrorist and killed
another in continuing ettorts to as
sign blame to the incident, which
South Korean officials claimed was
engineered by North Korea.
More than one million people at
tended a national funeral Thursday
at Seoul's Toido Plaza for the victims
of the Rangoon blast.

While President Reagan said he is
leaving himself "a little wiggle room"
to decide against a re-election bid,
Republican leaders received his offi
cial authorization to create a re
election panel in perhaps the
clearest signal yet that Reagan will
seek the presidency in 1984.
Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), general
chairman of the Republican party,
said he was certain Reagan would be
a candidate next fall, but added that
the documents the president will
sign today to establish the "Reagan-
Bush '84" committee "leave a little
hole" that allows him to back out.
Reagan is expected to formally
declare his candidacy in mid-
November, after Congress ad
journs. Rumors that the 72-year-old
Reagan might consider himself too
elderly to seek a second term and
speculation that Nancy Reagan
might veto a re-election bid due to
concerns about her health or the
health of her husband "simply
aren't true," Laxalt said.

Former Japanese Prime Minister
Kakuei Tanaka was found guilty ol
having accepted more than $2 mil
lion in bribes to arrange the pur
chase of Lockheed aircraft by his
country's largest domestic airline.
Tanaka was sentenced to four
years in prison and ordered to pay a
$2 million fine by the Tokyo Distrid
Court. He is expected to appeal his
case to a higher court, possibly all
the way to the Japanese Supreme
Court.
