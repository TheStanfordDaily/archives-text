# Students stock up experience

They don't ride around campus in the
back of Cadillac limousines, reading The
Wall Street Journal behind shaded windows.
Servants don't bring them breakfast in
bed while they eagerly scan the information
feeding from the ticker tape machine in
their dorm room.
They may not even all be budding
capitalists following in the footsteps of
Leland Stanford. Still, many Stanford stu
dents have already entered the world of
high finance by investing some of their
money in the stock market.
Actually, student investors don't necessar
ily look upon their stocks as a way to get rich
quickly. Several said they invested mainly to
maintain what money they have, and expect
a moderate return.
"With inflation the way it is, you have to
do something with your money or it's just
eroded away. That's the main reason I
started investing," senior Aaron Morris ex
plained.
Freshman Peg Kilmer said stocks are bet
ter than keeping money in a bank account,
adding, "Even with basically safe invest
ments, you're going to make at least 5 per
cent, if you have staying power and don't
get scared too easily."
Others cited different motives for invest
ing. Senior Wayne Brandt said, "It's not like
I'm flooded with money; it's more like a
hobby that's in my blood. I read the busi
ness page every morning the way some
people read the sports page. More than
anything, I do it because I enjoy it."
Many of the students said they first got
into investing through family or friends.
Senior Dave Levy first became interested in
the market through a friend's father who
was a stockbroker. "I began following the
small companies that were just starting up,"
he recollected. "I started out only buying
five to 10 shares at a time."
One of Levy's early investments was in a
small new computer firm that he learned
about from a high schoof reacner — Appfe
Computers.

Levy and Morris are both members of the
board of directors of the Blyth Fund, which
is used for group investment by Stanford
students. The $75,000 fund was established
by anonymous donors in memory of Califor
nia financier Charles Blyth to educate stu
dents in finance and investment.
Investment of the money in the fund is
controlled by the 11 students on the board
of directors. Each member researches a dif
ferent area of possible investment before
decisions are made, Morris said.
Levy said he joined the fund for the learn
ing experience. "So much here at Stanford
is individual and competitive, it's nice to be
in a situation where people are working to
gether," he said.
Morris pointed out that Blyth Fund
meetings are open, and interested students
or prospective members are welcome.
There is little consensus among Stanford
investors, whether members of the Blyth
Fund fund or not, on investment strat
egy."Everyone has his own system," Brandt
said.
Levy stressed the importance of caution.
"You should never invest more than you can
afford to lose," he said. "Any investment is a
risk, and you always have to balance that
against the possible benefits."
Kilmer agreed. "You can't invest money
that you might need in another month. It's
really just play-money that you invest."
Brandt, however, feels differently. "I
think it's very conservative to say you should
only invest what you can lose," he ex
plained. "If you invest in long-term, stable
companies like IBM or Standard Oil, there's
really very little risk."
Brandt advised the novice investor to start
small and learn as much as possible about
the market. He added, "If you're intent on
creating wealth, the amount of money you
start out with doesn't matter as much as
your intelligence."
That's encouraging news to all those am
bitious students who plan to make their first
million before they turn 25.
