# Special task force reports on University meal system
## Food Service applies many student ideas 
### MARC PEYSER Staff Writer 
In May, 1982, a group of 24 students and
one faculty adviser got together to evaluate
the University Food Service, compare other
universities' programs and make recommen
dations to improve the quality of dorm food
here.
Now, a year later, some of the five major
recommendations made by the task force are
finally being realized. Others remain untried.
The question remains as to just how far the
University has currie i»l thdt yedf.
Although the recommendations were
made with the entire campus in mind, many
of the improvements have come at one loca
tion, Sterling Quadrangle in Governor's Cor
ner.
Sterling's new a la carte meal program is
the most visible of the changes. The task
force has hoped the pay-as-you-eat plan,
with its magnetic cards and food point sys
tem, would cut waste and overconsumption
as well as create a more equitable system for
board charges.
And according to Ed Scoles, director of
housing and food services, all of these ex

pectations have been realized.
"Less food is being consumed by students,
the waste is way, way down and we are notic
ing that students are becoming very inter
ested in the number of points they have —
they're becoming more aware of the money
part of it,"he said.
Scoles cautioned that it is still too early to
come to a final decision on the pay-as-you
eat policy, but he admitted that he is "very
excited about the possibilities."
He credited the task force report for
providing the driving lorce behind the sys
tem."
The magnetic cards used for tallying food
costs, another task force suggestion, have
also been implemented successfully, Scoles
said.
While the Task Force favored the card as a
way to cut fraud and labor costs, it also sug
gested that the card could eventually serve to
link the entire campus, from the Bookstore
to the libraries to the various ticket offices.
Scoles said those suggestions may become
reality.
"We're pretty pleased with the way the sys
tem has functioned. The chances are quite
good that the system will be expanded to in

clude the maximum possible services," he
said.
Sterling Quad isn't the only testing ground
for the task force's ideas, however. The task
force suggested improvements for the Row
as well. Realizing that University-run food
services there have been losing in excess of
$100,000 per year, the task force recommend
ed that row houses be encouraged to change
to a self-op plan.
Diana Conklin, director of the Row, said
she has sen' questionnaires to all row
houses, asking them it they wished to change
food service plans.
Two residences, Storey House and 353
Campus, have switched to the self-op sys
tem, although Conklin credits coincidence as
much as the report for the change.
One task force recommendation — that the
University hire an outside contractor to run
campus food services — has not been realized
"We have looked at private contractors a
number of times over the years, but we're
satisfied that internally, the management of
the food service is competent," Scoles said.
The task force, however, said that a private
contractor could cut 30 to 80 percent from a
system similar to the one now in use.
