## The 						Stanford Daily Why Reagan chose Clark 
### 
When President Reagan announced that
William Clark would move from the White
House and the world of foreign affairs to the
Department of the Interior, we wondered why.
But a little digging and recollecting proved
that, as his universally respected predecessor
pronounced, "Judge" Clark (as he likes to be
called) is a "fantastically fine guy" and
"couldn't be a better appointment." Here are a
few reasons why.
• He went to Stanford for two years — two in
consecutive years. He had a fascinating experi
ence when he stopped out after the academic
competition proved too vigorous for the small
town boy: He broadened his horizons at the
Augustinian Novitiate in New Hamburg, New
York, a training ground for priests.
• He didn't get a degree from the University
of Santa Clara, his next stop after New York
and another tough year on a farm not like the
one he was used to in the Southern California
chaparral of Oxnard.
• He also left the University of Loyola Law
School empty-handed after his dean suggested
he find a different academic route.
• He passed the bar exam on the second try,
even without a law degree.

• When he was appointed to the California
Supreme Court, Chief Justice Donald Wright
said he was "not qualified by education, train
ing or experience" for the spot.
• Sen. Charles Percy (R -111.) said, "Never
again can we accept a man who professes to
have no knowledge in the area for which he
has been nominated," after Clark embarrassed
himself by confessing he could not name the
leaders of Zimbabwe and South Africa in his
confirmation hearings for the No. 2 spot at the
State Department.
• 'William Clark doesn't know any more
about national parks or endangered species
than he did about Angola or Zimbabwe," a
Friends of the Earth energy specialist noted
about the man whose few environmental deci
sions as a justice of the California Supreme
Court were pro-development.
• In the president's words, he is a "God
fearing Westerner"— one with a record of carry
ing out Reagan's policies to a tee.
Clark left Stanford after a second try here,
prompted by the advice of a dean: "Bill, why
don't you consider going back to agriculture "
Give it some thought, Judge.
