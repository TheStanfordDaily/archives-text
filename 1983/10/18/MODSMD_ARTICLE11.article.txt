# Building a tradition
## 
### 
It just wouldn't be home without it. Each
year new buildings are erected, old ones
renovated or even moved. And this year, like
every other, construction runs rampant on the
Stanford campus.
You can't miss it. just try to jog around
Campus Drive and see how many bulldozers,
dump trucks, wooden horses and dirt piles you
have to dodge during your run. It's no better
when you drive. The area near the Medical
Center is especially busy and those metal
planks covering holes in the road seem to just
be waiting to swallow up your car.
And if you want to take the old short cut
behind the physics labs, forget it. With the new
Center for Integrated Systems building going
up and the new white-striped speed bumps,
there is no such thing as a short cut anymore.
Elsewhere on campus, the Braun Auditorium
is still not finished and Lasuen Mall is still
blocked off by the work. While a crane rises
from out of the Braun construction, for once
no cranes dot the Quadrangle skyline. The
Quad at this time is quiet but it won't be too
long until the Inner Quad renovations begin.

This quarter Terman looks like construction
central with its massive scaffolding all about.
But appearances can be deceiving for Terman
is only expecting a facelift and a paint job. No
area around campus seems exempt from addi
tions: the Stanford Shopping Center is getting
a parking garage, the Stanford Synchrotron Ra
diation Laboratory is getting two new beam
lines and Angell Field is getting a new club
house.
The construction even gets you where you
live. Jackhammers and staple guns blast
through the early morning hours like no alarm
clock ever could. The new dorms, Flo Mo and
the row fraternity cluster have suffered
through the incessant pounding to make way
for finishing touches, new courtyards and new
shingles. There's nothing quite like waking up
to the rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat sounds of the
meeting of hammer and nail.
From rooftop to sewer, construction con
tinues all over campus. While it may be annoy
ing for campus drivers, cyclists and
pedestrians, one must remember that at Stan
ford construction is more than an unavoidable
pain. It is an endless tradition.
