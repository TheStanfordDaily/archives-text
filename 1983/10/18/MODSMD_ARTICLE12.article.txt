No to rent control
I question the contention that
East Palo Alto renters are paying
higher rates of rent than renters in
other areas ("Rent control
needed," Oct. 11). Without per
forming a market study of my own,
I will assume for a moment that
their average per room rent is
higher than the county average.
Could this be true? Consider some
problems particular to owners of
low income rental units: Do you
know how much more often these
renters kick in walls and break
refrigerator doors? Budgeting for a
more accelerated rate of wear and
tear on carpets, appliances and
other fixtures considerably raises a
landlord's cost of operations. The
reality faced by the landlord is that
he has mortgage, tax, miscel
laneous service and reserve pay
ments to make, and the only
response is to raise rents or leave
damages unrepaired, or some
combination of the two.
Now let's consider this neat,
idealized plan of rent control of
fered by David Skidmore which
will eliminate "windfall" profits for
the landlords and provide "relief"
for the tenants. I will not buy or
build rental units in an area subject
to rent controls — these areas are
avoided like the plague by
prospective investors! Indeed,
good investors are driven out,
making room for their lower
caliber counterparts.
Yes, the free market will always
overbuild when left unfettered,
and that pays off to the consumer
in the form of lower prices. Rent
controls for East Palo Alto will
mean further stagnation in the
supply and quality of the rental
stock there, and for the landlord
who is budgeting for building
repairs and improvements, it will
mean more faulty hot water
heaters, broken windows and
soiled carpets left unattended.
112 inally, Skidmore's contention
that of the 12,000 evictions in Cali
fornia last year, "many (were)
arbitrary in nature": landlords
don't kick out good tenants. And
when they find them, they hold on
to them dearly.

Nuclear awareness
Here at Stanford there is an
articulate and intoh anti-

nuclear community which is active
ly engaged in working for the
prevention of nuclear war. The
recent symposium "Prescription for
Prevention" is an example of a
concerted effort by part of the
Stanford community to educate the
public about nuclear war and to
think about the means to prevent
one. Still, the organizations and
groups at Stanford related to the
nuclear issue are a surprisingly
small fraction of this entire univer
sity, considering the fact that the
nuclear arsenals are a threat to
each individual, whether he or she
is concerned and informed or not.
There is no excuse for nuclear
ignorance. We must take it upon
ourselves to accomplish (he first
task of becoming informed. A
popular misconception is that the
nuclear issue is arcane and
therefore beyond the public's
grasp. Such an attitude within a
university which claims to actively
seek knowledge in the face of
mystery is particularly disturbing.
But the nuclear issue is not arcane;
only the arcane language of some
politicians leads us to believe it is.
Idealistic as it may sound to say, it
only takes individuals — lots of them
— who exercise influence in their
own ways and in their own spheres
to reverse the course toward nu
clear catastrophe.
The present inertia of many
Americans in this regard is not only
a threat to our survival, but it sug
gests that we do not have a
working democracy because we do
not make it work. It is difficult to
imagine that anyone would not be
against the dangers of nuclear war.
Having concern about nuclear
weapons and the conditions which
might lead to their use without
acting on that concern is as in
sidious as apathy, for it opens the
door to our own annihilation.
