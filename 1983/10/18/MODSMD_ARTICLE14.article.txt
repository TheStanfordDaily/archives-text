# 'Conservatives' on campus
## 
### 
An audible whine can now be heard near co-ops and
coffee houses on the Stanford campus. "This place is
just getting sooo conservative," the bemoaning will
warn in earnest, pronouncing that last word as though
it stains their tongues. "I mean, like, really — they're
everywhere!"
Fear in the ranks of the Stanford student left has risen
understandably in these 1980s, buoyed by a discourag
ing lack of interest in the Old Causes, the fight against
Hoover and the Reagan complex being merely the
latest. The mass of the student body toes what appears
to be a more traditional line, one which includes a
pronounced jump in "traditional" dress or grooming
and a doubling in the number of students interested in
fraternities and sororities.
Yet the left is gnashing its teeth rightly — and in good
company, joined by what few mossbacked con
servatives there are amid those usurping a noble label,
"conservative." What confusion is this? None, to the
observant.
The "Campus Conservative" is a loud animal. He
(they are "he"s more often than not) is unaware or
cares little for the centuries-old body of thought that
began with Aristotle; he knows his Fortune and his
Friedman instead. "Wisdom" is a risky word for him;
he prefers efficiency.
Notions inextricably conservative—that "if it is not nec
essary to change, it is necessary not to change," that
virtue or faith is the end of the state — areforeign to him.
After all, what are conventions and traditions worth
when one might have instead status, convenience or i
percent consistent growth in the GNP? To him, very
little.
One needs only to count the times he says, "in my
best interest" or notice the copies of Rand's Atlas
Shrugged or The Virtues of Selfishness on his desk,
placed there as testaments, to see the pattern: Me first.
In him, the Me Generation has come of age, reaching
its pinnacle in a youth unabashedly selfish.

Politics? He will twist Jefferson's view of government
authority into a case for near-absolution. Economics?
The passions of the marketplace knows no limits, and
should determine everything from educational policy
to family ethics. "Self interest is the root of all human
action," he will insist, daring even the bartender to
disagree.
II he is among the more thoughtful, he will embrace
the label "libertarian conservative" (George Will likens
these tQ "promiscuous celibates"); if now, he will in
stead, help make economics the most popular under
graduate major, lured in bv the notion that one must
first understand the mechanics of money and produc
tion to be truly learned —or, well, eventually wealthy.
Alter all, is that not what being learned is for?
Yet it is more than mere politics and economics; the
preeminent self is found even in simple human behav
ior. He will find little use for the Honor Code, unless its
enforcement serves his wants.
"I don't know why, really," he will recount, "I just
broke up with her. I just wasn't getting anything out ot
it, you know? It had just gotten old, and I got sick of it. I
mean, what doyou want—l'm not going to hang on with
out getting something for my trouble." Or still again: "I
don't think I'll have kids—they are such a hassle and
besides, they are so expensive." Refrain: Get, not give,
rights, not responsibilities—Me first.
This striking ascent of selfishness, noted even in the
recent year's applications by a Stanford admissions offi
cer, helps discount the platitude that "these things are
cyclical," that history's tendency to repeat itselt giving
us a designer version of the 1920s or '50s. On the (con
trary, if youth was once conservative, it turned in the
'60s to a restless, sense of us-against-tliem. It is from
that point, in the same linear direction, thai have
descended to me-against-everyone.
That may not be very liberal, but it certainly is not
conservative.

it, you know? It had just gotten old, and I got sick of it. I
mean, what doyou want—l'm not going to hang on with
out getting something for my trouble." Or still again: "I
don't think I'll have kids—they are such a hassle and
besides, they are so expensive." Refrain: Get, not give,
rights, not responsibilities—Me first.
This striking ascent of selfishness, noted even in the
recent year's applications by a Stanford admissions offi
cer, helps discount the platitude that "these things are
cyclical," that history's tendency to repeat itselt giving
us a designer version of the 1920s or '50s. On the (con
trary, if youth was once conservative, it turned in the
'60s to a restless, sense of us-against-tliem. It is from
that point, in the same linear direction, thai have
descended to me-against-everyone.
That may not be very liberal, but it certainly is not
conservative.
