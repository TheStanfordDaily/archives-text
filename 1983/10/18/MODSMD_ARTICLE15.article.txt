## The 						art of avoiding campus sculptures 
### 
Lies! More lies. I'm really disap
pointed in the Stanford community.
Believing that The Daily actually
conducted the interview reported
below with an unidentified member
of the Outdoor Sculpture Commit
tee (OSC). It never took place.
Shame on yourselves!
Daily: Sir, would you care to address
the apparent conflict between the
aesthetic sense of your Committee
and that of the community at large?
OSC: As far as we're aware, no con
flict exists.
Daily: But many people on campus
feel that recent acquisitions are
garish, meaningless, expensive
trash.
OSC: I think that accurately reflects
our feelings too.
Daily (bewildered): How can you
commission them then?
OSC: It's purely a matter of econom
ics. To keep the money rolling in
from the departments and schools.
Daily (flabbergasted): You mean
that they pay you to put those things
up next to their buildings?
OSC: Don't be absurd. They pay

members of the Committee to con
duct feasibility studies for "site
placement." Which is clearly under
stood to mean some other site than
their own.
Daily (confused): You mqan that
you extort money from them noi >
have any of your sculpture?
OSC: I prefer to think of it as income
redistribution. We concentrate our
efforts on the professional schools.
Try to convince them to be good
citizens and spread some of their
wealth to us.
Daily: It was rumored that Alters'
Wall was originally supposed to be
placed in front of the Law School.
Did they prevent that by buying you
off?
OSC: Please, let's call it a generous
contribution. I was more than
satisified. On the other hand, we've
seen reticence from them lately.
First, we had to put up The Crum
bling Chromium Clothesline in their
distant view. And when that didn't
suffice, we went on to The Insect.
After that, all I had to do was go to
the Law School dean and show him
my proposal for replacing The Fal
con.

Daily: I take it that the Law School is
back as a full contributor. What
about the Business School?
OSC: Those fools always seem to
refuse "offers that the, Cun't
refuse"! I personally put up The
Cables in :!;e â€¢ in from i. .t
Dean's window. He didn't take the
threat seriously. So then came The
Pillars of Hercules.
Daily: You deny then the rumors
that a disgruntled alumnus commis
sioned that as a way to get back at
the Graduate School of Business?
OSC: Not entirely. We arranged the
work with the "artist." But it worked
out even better for us when we
found the person you mentioned to
pay for it. He thought it was
hilarious that he also got a tax break
for his contribution. By now, the
Business School must think of The
Flame Birds as a masterpiece.
Daily: What about the other profes
sional schools?
OSC: You've noticed, I'm sure, the
clean lines at the Medical School.
None of our monstrosities? The
Medical School is well-endowed,
and we on the Committee have got
ten our fair share. But the Engineer

ing School has been cutting back. If
they don't watch themselves, I've
something special planned for
ri pond behind Trrman. I envision
u a c .c.iecting pool, and I dun t
think they'll like looking at what it
> rt.. ting.
Daily: What do you consider to be
thn "reatest accomplishment of the
Outdoor Sculpture Committee! 1
OSC: One of our least known ones,
actually. When the City of Palo Alto
refused to pay us off, we put up The
Dish.
Daily: Well, what do you have
planned for the future?
OSC: With federal cutbacks, the
entire University is becoming more
oriented toward the private sector.
The Outdoor Sculpture Committee
is proud to announce its new plan.
We've been purchasing small plots
of land in residential areas. So, I'd
like to tell your readers that, when a
representative of the OSC comes to
your door soliciting contributions,
pay up or else.
