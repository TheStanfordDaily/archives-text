"It's hard work," said Barb

motivated but she doesn't
know how to put it in words.
"A lot of it is the people," she
said.
Women's captain Jenny
Glockner agreed with
Holdren. "There's a mystique

about it... . The boat feels so
neat when it goes fast across
the water. I love that feeling."
She said that "the people, the
camaraderie, the spirit" are
encouraging factors, explain
ing that the team members are
a "support system that ex

provement does not come
easily. 'It just comes down to
your muscles burning." He
added that perhaps the most
painful parts of training are
"ergometer pieces" on the
rowing machine and running
the stadium steps.
"People think of it as a
masochistic sport. We're not
masochistic, just competi
tive," said King.
Bob Whitford, varsity men's
coach, agreed with King.
"They're competitive in
whatever form that may take,"
he said.
In addition to their competi
tive spirit, there is yet another
trait which almost all Stanford
crew members share — they are
"walk-ons." John Davis, the
women's coach, estimated
that only about 10 percent of
his rowers have had prior
rowing experience while
Whitfield estimated about 20
percent for the men's team.
Davis also said that the num
ber of experienced rowers is
increasing because "Stanford
is just now starting to be an
attractive place to row."
Not only is the quantity of
experienced rowers increas
ing but the quality as well,
Whitford added. "The people
we've been getting in are very
good caliber people from
good caliber programs."
Both coaches agreed,
however, that the success of

tends beyond the boathouse."
The people involved seem
to be a motivating factor for
the men as well.
"Once you get involved
with a sport, you meet friends
you'll have the rest of your
life," said Tom King, men's co
captain.
Still others enjoy the chal
lenge of crew.
"I've always had this great
desire to improve and every
year we've been doing it,"
said senior Dan Cornew,
who's beginning his fourth
season with Stanford crew.
Cornew added that im

their programs lies riot in the
expertise of the veteran
rowers, but in the overall
dedication of the entire crew.
Crew members exemplify
"the Stanford mold of ac
celeration ... If they want to
do it, they'll do it on their
own." Whitford said.
Davis echoed Whitford's
sentiments. "They (the wo
men) have done the work on
their own," he said. Calling
them "excellent people" he
added, "They motivate me."
In viewing the two groups'
records, it is evident that their
hard work has paid off. Last
year, the men placed seventh
in the Intercollegiate Rowing
Association race in Syracuse,
N.V., beating both UC-
Berkeley and Princeton, a
team Whitford called "an
archrival."
The women fared even bet
ter, placing fourth at nation
als. "We're really happy with
that," Holdren said.
And they have reason to be.
Although Stanford's crew
program is technically a club
sport, the two teams compete
against varsity crews from
other schools. Also, despite
the club sport status of crew,
members can earn varsity let
ters.
This is yet another reason
crew is a "unique club sport,"
Whitford said.

week during the fall and six
days during the winter. For the

about crew that keeps her
motivated but she doesn't
know how to put it in words.
"A lot of it is the people," she
said.
Women's captain Jenny
Glockner agreed with
Holdren. "There's a mystique

about it... . The boat feels so
neat when it goes fast across
the water. I love that feeling."
She said that "the people, the
camaraderie, the spirit" are
encouraging factors, explain
ing that the team members are
a "support system that ex

provement does not come
easily. 'It just comes down to
your muscles burning." He
added that perhaps the most
painful parts of training are
"ergometer pieces" on the
rowing machine and running
the stadium steps.
"People think of it as a
masochistic sport. We're not
masochistic, just competi
tive," said King.
Bob Whitford, varsity men's
coach, agreed with King.
"They're competitive in
whatever form that may take,"
he said.
In addition to their competi
tive spirit, there is yet another
trait which almost all Stanford
crew members share — they are
"walk-ons." John Davis, the
women's coach, estimated
that only about 10 percent of
his rowers have had prior
rowing experience while
Whitfield estimated about 20
percent for the men's team.
Davis also said that the num
ber of experienced rowers is
increasing because "Stanford
is just now starting to be an
attractive place to row."
Not only is the quantity of
experienced rowers increas
ing but the quality as well,
Whitford added. "The people
we've been getting in are very
good caliber people from
good caliber programs."
Both coaches agreed,
however, that the success of

tends beyond the boathouse."
The people involved seem
to be a motivating factor for
the men as well.
"Once you get involved
with a sport, you meet friends
you'll have the rest of your
life," said Tom King, men's co
captain.
Still others enjoy the chal
lenge of crew.
"I've always had this great
desire to improve and every
year we've been doing it,"
said senior Dan Cornew,
who's beginning his fourth
season with Stanford crew.
Cornew added that im

their programs lies riot in the
expertise of the veteran
rowers, but in the overall
dedication of the entire crew.
Crew members exemplify
"the Stanford mold of ac
celeration ... If they want to
do it, they'll do it on their
own." Whitford said.
Davis echoed Whitford's
sentiments. "They (the wo
men) have done the work on
their own," he said. Calling
them "excellent people" he
added, "They motivate me."
In viewing the two groups'
records, it is evident that their
hard work has paid off. Last
year, the men placed seventh
in the Intercollegiate Rowing
Association race in Syracuse,
N.V., beating both UC-
Berkeley and Princeton, a
team Whitford called "an
archrival."
The women fared even bet
ter, placing fourth at nation
als. "We're really happy with
that," Holdren said.
And they have reason to be.
Although Stanford's crew
program is technically a club
sport, the two teams compete
against varsity crews from
other schools. Also, despite
the club sport status of crew,
members can earn varsity let
ters.
This is yet another reason
crew is a "unique club sport,"
Whitford said.


ROW, ROW, ROW: Stanford crew members hold their early-morning
workouts at Redwood Shores. In addition to rowing, crew members run and
l«n weights four to six times a week during fall and winter quarters. Despite

the early hours and hard work, team members say they enjoy the
camaraderie — as well as the exercise gained during practice and competition.
