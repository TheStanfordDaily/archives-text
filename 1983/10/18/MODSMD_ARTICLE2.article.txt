## Many oppose new fee refund system 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior Staff Writer 
Caught unaware by changes in the
fee assessment system enacted last
year, several students have ex
pressed dissatisfaction with the cur
rent system because they have been
unable to obtain fee refunds.
these students, who wrote letters
to the ASSU's Council of Presidents
(COP) noting their disapproval of
the new system, said that last year
they often did not receive informa
tion on campus affairs and thus had
no idea that a receipt given to voters
last spring was needed to receive a
refund. Because they had not voted
they are unable to receive their
money.
David Lancaster, a Ph.D. student
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and one of those who
wrote letters, noted that he comes
to the main campus only to see his
adviser; some of his colleagues, he
said, do not even come that often
because their advisers are based at
SLAC. And although he knew about

the election, "I did not know that I
had to vote in order to get a
refund."
Third-year medical student Walt
Seale, another of those who ex
pressed complaints, also found him
self unable to receive his fee retund.
Referring to the election, he said I
never saw it or anything like that."
"I preferred it the way it had
been,"he said, because "I don't like
the idea of having to do something
in order to get something back."
According to Karl Schulz, a San
Carlos resident who manned the
refund table all last week and yester
day, lack of knowledge of the elec
tion and the consequences of not
voting were a common lament of
those unable to get a refund.
"Most of them claim they never
heard of the election and the
refund," he said. However, he said
that those who "really made a big
fuss about" not being able to
receive a refund numbered less than
10 percent.
Kathy Wee of Redwood City, who
also worked at the table, said some
students also faulted the idea of the
voting receipt. "The receipt doesn't
say that they must keep it" was a
common complaint, she said.
Under ASSU rules passed last
year, refunds are only given to those
who voted last year and kept the
receipt they obtained at that time, to
new students and to those who can
prove that for some reason they
were unable to vote during the two
days of the spring election.
These rules were passed in order
to encourage students to vote and
to reduce the high refund rates cer
tain student groups experienced.
Some student organizations lost up
to 40 percent of their fee assess
ments during the refund period of
winter quarter 1982, while a typical
ASSU election has a 20 percent voter
turnout. Under the rules of the old
system, this meant that more stu
dents requested refunds than voted
at all.

Vinnie Freda, a member of the
COP, commented that such com
plaints "were expected . . . it's the
first year it's been in." He said that
as more people become used to the
new process, complaints about it
will be reduced; even now, he
noted, "a lot more people like this
system than dislike it."
One reason given by those who
did not vote, according to Peter
Spivack, chair of the COP, was that
they "claimed not to read The Daily"
and thus were unaware of the
changes in the fee assessment sys
tem.
Lancaster said, "I think it's a little
unreasonable to expect people to
regard The Daily as the official organ
of the University ... in order to
make sure that you're not having
money taken away from you." In
stead, he suggested that changes
that affect students here be
publicized at registration — "one
thing everyone has to go through" —
or through letters mailed to all stu
dents. He acknowledged that the
second option would be expensive
but felt the cost would be worth in
forming all students of changes that
effect them.
