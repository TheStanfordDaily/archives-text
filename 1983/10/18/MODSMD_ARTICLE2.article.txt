## Many oppose new fee refund system 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior Staff Writer 
Caught unaware by changes in the
fee assessment system enacted last
year, several students have ex
pressed dissatisfaction with the cur
rent system because they have been
unable to obtain fee refunds.
these students, who wrote letters
to the ASSU's Council of Presidents
(COP) noting their disapproval of
the new system, said that last year
they often did not receive informa
tion on campus affairs and thus had
no idea that a receipt given to voters
last spring was needed to receive a
refund. Because they had not voted
they are unable to receive their
money.
David Lancaster, a Ph.D. student
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and one of those who
wrote letters, noted that he comes
to the main campus only to see his
adviser; some of his colleagues, he
said, do not even come that often
because their advisers are based at
SLAC. And although he knew about

the election, "I did not know that I
had to vote in order to get a
refund."
Third-year medical student Walt
Seale, another of those who ex
pressed complaints, also found him
self unable to receive his fee retund.
Referring to the election, he said I
never saw it or anything like that."
"I preferred it the way it had
been,"he said, because "I don't like
the idea of having to do something
in order to get something back."
According to Karl Schulz, a San
Carlos resident who manned the
refund table all last week and yester
day, lack of knowledge of the elec
tion and the consequences of not
voting were a common lament of
those unable to get a refund.
"Most of them claim they never
heard of the election and the
refund," he said. However, he said
that those who "really made a big
fuss about" not being able to
receive a refund numbered less than
10 percent.
