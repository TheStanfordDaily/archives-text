I scream for aquatics
ll# Stanford Aquatics teams (water polo and men's and women's swimming and
diving) were honored with a Haagen-Dazs ice cream party last Thursday evening at
DeCuerre Pool. It was the first time in memory that Cardinal aquatic teams have been
honored at once. Branner Hall resident fellow Kennell Jackson arranged with Haagen-
Dazs' David Corsiglia to serve some 400 cups of ice cream to the aquatic teams and
friends. Corsiglia, who competed and coached gymnastics at the University of Georgia
between 1972 and 1981, said, "I like to support college athletics, so it (the Stanford
party) sounded like a natural to me."
