The Stanford women's golf team opened its fall season in high
fashion Saturday. Not only did the Cardinal linksters win the
three-team West Coast Intercollegiate tournament on their
home course, they shot the lowest team score on the Stanford
course in two years.
"It was a great showing for early in the season," said an elated
Cardinal Golf Coach Tim Baldwin.
Freshman Kathleen McCarthy led the way for Stanford with a
one-under-par 72 en route to a team aggregate score of 301.
South-Bay rival San Jose State was second at 312 and Sacramento
State third at 349.
Following medalist McCarthy in second place was Stanford
sophomore Kathy Kostas with a two-over-par 75. San lose State's
Ann Walsh was third with a 76 on the par-73 Stanford Golf
Course.
After Walsh, four golfers-three of them from Stanford -tied for
fourth at 77. Besides San Jose State's Liz Chirelli, Stanford's
Diane Nixon, Julie Carmichael and Kathv Nino fired 77's.
Baldwin and his team travel to Tulsa this week for the Nancy
Lopez Invitational, a large tournament featuring the top 20
teams in the nation. Texas Christian, host Tulsa and Southern
Methodist — the top three finishers in the NCAA last spring — will
compete along with West Coast teams San Jose State, UCLA,
USC, San Diego State and Long Beach State.
"Tulsa (and the tournament) should give us a good indication
of where we stand in the nation," Baldwin said.
