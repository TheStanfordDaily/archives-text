## Final Stanford goal disallowed Portland's late goal sinks Card 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
In a real barn burner of a
game, the Portland Pilots
managed to score with seven
minutes left to defeat the Stan
ford men's soccer team 2-1.
It was a very disappointing
loss for Stanford considering
they almost scored with 30
seconds left in the game
which could have sent the two
teams into overtime. The ref
eree, however, disallowed the
goal.
Stanford Coach Nelson
Lodge repeatedly asked the
referee why the goal was dis
allowed. It was to no avail as
the official refused an explana
tion.
Despite the unlucky break,
Stanford still had opportuni
ties to win the game. "We had
our chances," Lodge said.
"Weoutshot Portland 12-10."
This statistic is quite com
mendable since the Stanford
players feeding the ball to the
scorers are plagued with in
juries. "Injuries have hit us
hard in the midfield," said
Lodge, "most notably to
(Walter) Kingson and (Angel)
Vazquez."
Kingson did not play yester
day and will not be available
tomorrow against St. Mary's
College. He is suffering a se
vere contusion on his calf
muscle.
On the bright side, Todd
Rafalovlch, who scored four
goals against Loyola, con
tinues to play well. On a cen
ter pass from Giancarlo Fer
ruzzi, Rafalovich put it past the
Pilot's keeper to tie the score
1-1 early in the second half.
The loss was the Cardinal's
first in four games and puts
Stanford's season record at 7-
3-1. Portland raised its overall
mark to 6-3.
Stanford remains on the
road this week, taking on St.
Mary's in league action tomor
row at 3 p.m.
Lodge and company should
not have much problem with
St. Mary's, as the Gaels have
yet to win a league game in
five years.
"We have a number of goals
to accomplish this season," St.
Mary's coach Bob Martin said
before the season. "Number
one, to win our first league
game."
