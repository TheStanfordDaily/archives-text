latest |am release, "Snap," is a greatest hits
album tracing The |am sound from their al
bum, "In the City' to their swansong, "Beat
Surrender." This compilation provides an
excellent opportunity to hear the progres
sion of The Jam sound.
The Jam split up in 1982 and decided to
pursue separate projects. "Snap" is an excel

interested in The jam, but doesn't have the
money to buy their first nine albums.
