# UB-40 — 'Labour of Love'
## 
### 
"The title tells the story: the latest album
from the ÜBs is a tribute to the reggae artists
and music of their early days. The band
members were still in school in south
central Birmingham when these songs were
recorded in the early 70s — these days they
are riding the top of the charts in the U.K.
and (as usual) should be discovered on this
side of the Atlantic in several weeks.
The ten songs on "Labour of Love" pro
vide a good range of reggae music; from
early Bob Marley and "Keep on Moving" to
the toasting of Boy Friday's "Version Girl" to
the pop of "Red Red Wine" (written by Neil
Diamond and made famous in the reggae
world by Tony Tribe), these selections are
easy to like.
Five years after their formation in the sum
mer of 1978, ÜB-40 may make their biggest
contribution yet to the widespread accep
tance of reggae in the United States.
