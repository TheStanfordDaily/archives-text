## 'Lonely Hearts' fresh, pleasant 
### CHRIS JARVIS 
It's no secret that the
romantic love story belongs
on the endangered species
list. Often thev are their own
worst enemies. Filled with
drippy sentimentality, artificial
plots and predictable endings,
something of a taboo hangs
over the filmic love-story. But
despite the genre's problems,
Paul Cox's Lonely Hearts, a
new Australian film playing at
The Aquarius, has a freshness
and unpretentiousness that
make it pleasant to watch.
Lonely Hearts does not
create a good first impression:
The title sounds terribly sen
timental, the piano music
cliche. But some tine acting by
Norman kaye and Wendy
Hughes and careful direction of
Cox overcome the initial
awkwardness.
The plot sounds simplistic,
even banal. Peter Thompson
(Kaye), a balding "almost 50-
year-old" piano tuner, has
lived with his mother his
whole life. After attending her
funeral in the first scene, he
sets out on the painful course
of independence. The woman
he's introduced to by a dating
service comes from an equally
repressed background.
Patricia (Hughes), a bank clerk
of perhaps 35, has only recent
ly moved out on her own,
away from the domineering
parents who still want to know
her everv action.

Hughes, whose best-known
role probably has been the
aunt in My Brilliant Career,
brings a worried shyness to
her character. Kaye is just as
timid in his own way. Unfor
tunately this makes the first
halt of the film rather slow at
times, but makes them seem
more charming toward the
end. The film needs more wit
in the beginning, but Cox
(who wrote the screenplay
with Jonathan Hardy) writes as
meticulously as he directs.
To his credit, though, Cox
does keep the film fresh by
several devices. One night
Peter and Patricia go to a
Bingo hall. At another point,
when Peter is rebuffed we see
him at a pornographic movie
house. On another occasion,
he receives a call girl named
Rosemary from Call Kitten.
This is not done to spice up
the film for the American audi
ence, but instead to transmit
Kaye's feelings of frustration.
Cox goes to great pains to
avoid anything suggesting
sentimentality, and by and
large succeeds.
Despite both characters'
ages, thankfully there are no
conversations of flashbacks
about their pasts. Everything
happens in the present tense,
which gives the film a certain
vitality beneath its sometimes
slow surface.
Unfortunately, the film's
charming finish is marred by
an incredibly artificial plot


device. Cox needs a traumatic
event to bring Peter and
Patricia back together again,
so he has Peter shoplift some
cheese from a grocery store.
Serious. Perhaps this was
meant to be funny, but it com
es across as more bizarre than
anything else.

Lonely Hearts's main prob
lem right now is commercial.
The audience I saw it with was
older than the middle-aged
characters in the movie. But
this is not Cox's problem â€” he,
Kaye and Hughes deserve
praise for this pleasant love
story.
