# Sir Ralph Richardson leaves brilliant and rich artistic legacy

### STEVE VINEBERG 
In his lovely piece on Sir
Ralph Richardson in Show
i;People, Kenneth Tynan of
fered the definitive physical
[ description of this extraordi-
Ilnary actor: "There was the
unique physical presence, at
once rakish and stately, as of a
pirate turned prelate. There
was the balsawood lightness
of movement. . .There was
the pop-eyed, poleaxed look,
with one eyebrow balefuily
cocked, whenever he was

faced with a remark that was
baffling or potentially hostile.
Above all there was the
voice. . .something between
bland and grandiose: blan
diose, perhaps."
When Sir Ralph died last
week, at the age of 80, he
began the inevitable exodus of
the greatest generation of En
glish actors the world may
ever have known — the genera
tion of Olivier, of Gielgud, of
Redgrave. In this company
Richardson was always consid
ered the clown. On stage he

played Falstatf, Bottom,
Caliban, and also Kent and
Peer Gynt, and from all
reports he gave dazzling inter
pretations of these roles. It
may have been this comic
bent that denied him the rev
erence afforded Olivier and
Gielgud, but in later years,
when he and Gielgud together
tackled oblique dramas by
Pinter and David Storev, Rich

ardson's detractors vanished
mysteriously.
Sir Ralph made his first film,
The Ghoul, in I'M* and his
last, Dragonslayer, in 1981. In
between he appeared in more
than 50 pictures, usually in
supporting roles. And he was
often brilliant — as the tyranni
cal father in The Heiress
(1949), for example, or as Dr.
Rank in A Doll's House (1973),

or — proving, as Olivier and
Gielgud have, that advancing
age need not constrain an ac
tor of the first water — as the
sorcerer in Dragonslayer. My
own favorite memory of him is
in Long Day's Journey into
Night, which he, Katharine
Hepburn, )ason Robards and
Dean Stockwell starred in for
Sidney Lumet in 1962. Richard
son plays the miserly, retired

actor james Tyrone; in one
scene his son (Robards)
bullies him into leaving a light
burning in the room, even
though Tyrone swears this ex
travagance will send them all
to the poorhouse. The two
men talk and drink and then,
in the warmth of this late-night
chat, Tyrone steps onto his
chair, winks at his son, and
loosens the offending bulb.

It's a magnificent moment,
glowing with the kind of wit
that transforms banality into
magic.
Tynan quotes one of Sir
Ralph's many self-effacing
remarks: "I had a little talent
once. A very Ittle talent. If you
should ever come across a tiny
talent labelled R.R., please let
me know." We have, and we
do — again and again.
