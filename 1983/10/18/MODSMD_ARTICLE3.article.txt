### PAM CLOYD Staff Writer 
The president of the Board of
Trustees said yesterday that he
needs more input from outside
sources before a committee inves
tigating the Hoover Institution's ties
to the University proceeds with its
work.
William Kimball, president of the
Board, said in an interview with The
Daily that he sent a letter to student
members of the Trustee Committee
on Academic Affairs and Develop
ment (TCAAD), in response to their
request last week that he allow more
student and faculty input into the
Hoover probe, saying that the Board
needs more time before it makes a
decision.
Kimball says the committee as
signed to investigate the role of the
Hoover Institution is planning to see

"various people" such as University
Chancellor j.E. Wallace Sterling,
University president emeritus Rich
ard W. Lyman, representatives from
the Hoover Institution, faculty, stu
dent members of the TCAAD (Eric
Berg and Nina Bohlen) and Karol
Watson, ASSU observer of the
TCAAD regarding its investigation.
Watson, speaking tor the student
members of the TCAAD, declined to
comment before further consulta
tion with Kimball.
Kimball also responded to student
complaints that the Reagan library
debate is detracting from discussion
of the role of the Hoover Institution
at Stanford. "I have to admit that the
Reagan library has taken quite a bit
of our time. I can see why they're
impatient. We're not brushing this
under the rug, though. We're just
an anxious as anyone to get this
taken care of," he said.
