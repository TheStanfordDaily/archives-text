# Physics Prof. Wilcox dies during Mexico visit
## 
### 
Adjunct Prof. John Wilcox, direc
tor of the Stanford Solar Obser
vatory for the past 10 years, died
Friday morning while swimming
near Puerto Penasco, Mexico. He
was 58.

A solar physicist, Wilcox worked
around the world studying the influ
ence of solar magnetism on global
weather patterns.
In 1980, scientists working at the
South Pole confirmed his observa
tion that the sun pulses every two
hours and 40 minutes, a finding that
caused major revisions in models of
the solar interior.
Wilcox was visiting friends at the
University of Arizona's Environmen
tal Research Laboratory in Mexico
when he drowned.
He is survived by his wife, Ann; a
daughter, Sharon, of Ann Arbor,
Michigan; a son, David, of Santa
Cruz; two brothers, William and
Ralph, both of San Diego; and his
former wife, Paula, of Stanford.
Cremation is planned in Tucson,
Arizona, with burial of his ashes
next spring in Cedar Falls, lowa, his
home town. Memorial services are
planned for 4 p.m. Friday, at Stan
ford Memorial Church.
