### BOB BARCKLAY 
Results of a three-year experiment
by a chemistry professor here have
made it possible for researchers to
analyze the energy states of chemi
cal reactions and compare data with
earlier theoretical calculations.
"Experimentation has just leap
frogged over theory," said Prof.
Richard /are in describing the
results of his attempt to analyze the
energy dynamics of the "simplest
chemical reaction there is."
The first results of his experiment
were released in |uly and compare
favorably with a si mi I ia r experiment
conducted at the Los Alamos Na
tional Laboratory and predictions
arrived at by theoretical calcula
tions.
Using "state-of-the-art" laser
technology, /are and his associates
have been able to study, for the first
time, the energy states of a chemical
reaction by looking at "one collision
at a time."
The reaction studied is that be
tween atomic hydrogen and its
molecular isotope, deuterium.
The experiment occurs in two
phases. First, a laser breaks up hy

drogen containing molecules to
produce "fast" hydrogen atoms.
These high energy or "hot" atoms
collide and react with deuterium
molecules to form deuterium
hydride.
About five billionths of a second
later, immediately after the reaction
occurs, a second laser is fired into
the mixture and knocks out elec
trons from the new molecules,
forming ionized deuterium hydride
molecules. These are then counted.
"This ionization process makes it
possible to detect reaction products
in the presence of other species and
to obtain a spectrum of their rota
tional and vibrational energies,"
Zare said.
Theoreticians anxiously await fur
ther results of Zare's experiment so
that theory can finally be tested
against actual data on the dynamics
of this chemical reaction.
"This is just the information re
quired to make a direct comparison
with theory, and hence, to test and
develop new approximations for
modeling chemical reactions," Zare
said.
