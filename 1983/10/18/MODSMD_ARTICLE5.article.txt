Local engineer charged as a Soviet spy
San Francisco — An American engineer has been charged with stealing
and passing to Soviet-bloc agents documents aimed at helping the
United States survive a nuclear attack, the justice Department said
yesterday.
About 100 "extremely sensitive" classified documents allegedly
were passed in a series of 14 meetings over a 4'/j-year period. They
were turned over to Polish intelligence agents who routed them to the
Soviet Union, the lustice Department said.
The documents included information on the Minuteman Intercon
tinental Ballistic Missile and the ballistic missile defense research and
development programs, according to federal authorities.
James Durward Harper, a 49-year-old consulting engineer from
Mountain View, was arrested Saturday morning and held without bail
after a brief appearance yesterday before U.S. Magistrate Owen

Woodruff
FBI officials said Harper allegedly asked his
foreign contact for $1 million and received more
than $250,000 as an operative.
The documents apparently were of tremendous
value to the KGB — the Soviet Committee for State
Security — and had been sought unsuccessfully "all
over the world," according to a federal affidavit.
In September 1981, according to the affidavit, Har
per tried unsuccessfully through a lawyer to request
immunity in exchange for cooperating as a U.S. go
vernment informant and counterintelligence
operative. The lawyer did not reveal his client's
name to the government.
"We did not feel it was proper to offer immunity,"
said William McGivern, a chief assistant U.S. attor
ney in San Francisco. He said the investigation
would continue.
Harper, whose identity was discovered in March,
has cooperated with authorities since his arrest. He
faces an espionage charge that could bring a life
term in prison.
Reagan names McFarlane
Washington — President Reagan named Middle East
special envoy Robert McFarlane as his national se
curity adviser yesterday, saying the former Marine
officer "shares my view about the need for a strong
America."
It was an appointment that dismayed hard-line
conservatives who waged a strong lobbying cam
paign on behalf of U.N. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick.
Reagan declined to be drawn into predictions of
Kirkpatrick's future role in his administration during
a brief news conference and said "as far as I know
she's happy" with her U.N. job.
There have been persistent reports in recent days
that Kirkpatrick was eager to return to Washington,
where she formerly was on the faculty at Geor
getown University.
McFarlane, a 45-year-old former Marine lieutenant
colonel and foreign policy professional who worked
in the Nixon and Ford administrations under Henry
Kissinger, immediately took over the job from
William Clark, nominated as secretary of interior.
The White House job does not require Senate con
firmation.

McFarlane does not have the longtime insider
status with Reagan that Clark enjoyed, nor is he
likely to champion Pentagon and CIA views in
battles with the State Department as much as Clark
did.
Acknowledging that he differs at times with
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and CIA
Director William Casey, McFarlane said:
"My role now is not to be an advocate but to be a
coordinator (of policy). I intend to do that. I don't
expect there will be difficulties."
In his new job, McFarlane will be responsible for
briefing the president each day on foreign policy
developments and summarizing for him the various
options presented by the State Department and
other foreign policy experts. In recent administra
tions, NSC advisers such as Kissinger and Zbigniew
Brzezinski have emerged as top members of the
president's foreign policy appartus.
Cal prof wins Nobel Prize
Berkeley — A UC-Berkelev professor who reinforced
the foundation of economics by proving the theory
of supply and demand was awarded the 1983 Nobel
Prize for economics yesterday.
Gerard Debreu, 62, a French native who became a
U.S. citizen in 1976, is the 12th American to win or
share the economics prize since it was first pre
sented in 1969.
Debreu was acclaimed for applying mathematical
rigor to a relationship that goes to the heart of eco
nomics— how prices determine the quantity of goods
that are bought and sold.
While the theory of supply and demand dates to
the 1776 publication of "The Wealth of Nations" by
Scottish economics pioneer Adam Smith, Debreu's
mathematical models furnished proof that prices do
affect the supply of products as companies seek
maximum profits.
The existence of "market prices" determined by
thousands of consumers and producers thinking
and working independently is the basis of capitalist
economies, and Debreu laid out the conditions nec
essary to achieve this balance or "general equilib
rium" between the supply of goods produced and
the demand for them.
In its citation, the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences said Debreu won "for having incorporated
new analytical methods into economic theory and
for his rigorous reformulation of the theory of gen
eral equilibrium."
The Academy said his "foremost contribution" to

economics is "his clarity, analytical stringency and
insistence on always making a clear-cut distinction
between a theory and its interpretation."
The prize, to he presented Dec. 10 in Stockholm,
comes with a gold medal and a cash award of about
$92,000. Debreu said that he had not thought about
what he would do with the prize money vet. "I do
hope that my lite will not change much," he said at a
press conference in Berkeley.
Reagan revamps 1985 budget
Washington — The Reagan administration has begun
preparing a federal budget for the coming election
year that would be a significant retreat from its previ
ous get-tough budgets, with their drastic curbs on
domestic spending.
The fiscal 1985 budget that President Reagan will
submit to Congress in lanuary probably will call for
no significant new spending cuts, according to offi
cials in the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB). In fact, the administration may not even ask
again for cuts itproposed -and Congress rejected- in
the past.
Reagan still has more than two months to decide
to return to the attack and push Congress for more
deep spending cuts. But at this point, OMB has in
structed government agencies to prepare budgets
for fiscal 1985 that generally reflect fiscal 1984's
budget policy extended for another year. According
to current assumptions about the course of the eco
nomy, that would leave the projected deficit for fis
cal 1985, which begins next Oct. 1, at $170 billion.
And the deficit will not even get down to that level
unless Reagan resubmits all his old spending-cut
proposals.
Mondale will continue criticism
Washington — Former Vice President Walter
Mondale, responding to Sen. John Glenn's warnings
that bickering between the two front-runners for the
Democratic presidential nomination could damage
the ultimate nominee, declared yesterday that dif
ferences between the two are fundamental and that
he would continue to attack Glenn's record.
But Democratic Party officials are increasingly
concerned that if the Mondale-Glenn feud persists,
it will shatter party unity and hurt the Democrat's
chances against President Reagan next year. In fact,
party officials plan to meet with campaign managers
of the seven declared Democratic candidates and

urge that they retrain from attacking each other and
instead reserve their criticism tor Reagan, who yes
terday signed a letter legally making him a candidate
tor re-election.
Glenn, who has engaged in several sharp ex
changes with Mondale during the past week, has
already called for a cease-fire.
But Mondale, declaring that Reagan's economic
program was the "most profound domestic issue"
he has seen in his career, said: "I was against
Reaganomics. Glenn was for it. That's a fundamen
tal. And I don't see how we can serve the public by
trying to avoid discussions."
Mondale discussed his differences with Glenn at a
Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau breakfast
session at which Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley
disclosed he is supporting Mondale and plans to
campaign for him. Bradley said he would do
"whatever he asks me to do within the limits of my
time." Mondale and Bradley later appeared at a
press conference at which the mayor announced his
endorsement publicly.
Earlier, Glenn, reacting to a comment by Mondale
that the senator was basing his campaign on support
of Reaganomics, told the Times: "Can you imagine
anything more stupid than that? And feel free to use
that as a quote."
Glenn accused Mondale of citing his record out of
context and said that although he had voted for
Reagan's 25 percent tax cut, he had cast about 30
votes against various other aspects of the president's
economic record.
Stocks up amid mixed trading

U.S. citizen in 1976, is the 12th American to win or
share the economics prize since it was first pre
sented in 1969.
Debreu was acclaimed for applying mathematical
rigor to a relationship that goes to the heart of eco
nomics— how prices determine the quantity of goods
that are bought and sold.
While the theory of supply and demand dates to
the 1776 publication of "The Wealth of Nations" by
Scottish economics pioneer Adam Smith, Debreu's
mathematical models furnished proof that prices do
affect the supply of products as companies seek
maximum profits.
The existence of "market prices" determined by
thousands of consumers and producers thinking
and working independently is the basis of capitalist
economies, and Debreu laid out the conditions nec
essary to achieve this balance or "general equilib
rium" between the supply of goods produced and
the demand for them.
In its citation, the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences said Debreu won "for having incorporated
new analytical methods into economic theory and
for his rigorous reformulation of the theory of gen
eral equilibrium."
The Academy said his "foremost contribution" to

economics is "his clarity, analytical stringency and
insistence on always making a clear-cut distinction
between a theory and its interpretation."
The prize, to he presented Dec. 10 in Stockholm,
comes with a gold medal and a cash award of about
$92,000. Debreu said that he had not thought about
what he would do with the prize money vet. "I do
hope that my lite will not change much," he said at a
press conference in Berkeley.
Reagan revamps 1985 budget
Washington — The Reagan administration has begun
preparing a federal budget for the coming election
year that would be a significant retreat from its previ
ous get-tough budgets, with their drastic curbs on
domestic spending.
The fiscal 1985 budget that President Reagan will
submit to Congress in lanuary probably will call for
no significant new spending cuts, according to offi
cials in the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB). In fact, the administration may not even ask
again for cuts itproposed -and Congress rejected- in
the past.
Reagan still has more than two months to decide
to return to the attack and push Congress for more
deep spending cuts. But at this point, OMB has in
structed government agencies to prepare budgets
for fiscal 1985 that generally reflect fiscal 1984's
budget policy extended for another year. According
to current assumptions about the course of the eco
nomy, that would leave the projected deficit for fis
cal 1985, which begins next Oct. 1, at $170 billion.
And the deficit will not even get down to that level
unless Reagan resubmits all his old spending-cut
proposals.
Mondale will continue criticism
Washington — Former Vice President Walter
Mondale, responding to Sen. John Glenn's warnings
that bickering between the two front-runners for the
Democratic presidential nomination could damage
the ultimate nominee, declared yesterday that dif
ferences between the two are fundamental and that
he would continue to attack Glenn's record.
But Democratic Party officials are increasingly
concerned that if the Mondale-Glenn feud persists,
it will shatter party unity and hurt the Democrat's
chances against President Reagan next year. In fact,
party officials plan to meet with campaign managers
of the seven declared Democratic candidates and

urge that they retrain from attacking each other and
instead reserve their criticism tor Reagan, who yes
terday signed a letter legally making him a candidate
tor re-election.
Glenn, who has engaged in several sharp ex
changes with Mondale during the past week, has
already called for a cease-fire.
But Mondale, declaring that Reagan's economic
program was the "most profound domestic issue"
he has seen in his career, said: "I was against
Reaganomics. Glenn was for it. That's a fundamen
tal. And I don't see how we can serve the public by
trying to avoid discussions."
Mondale discussed his differences with Glenn at a
Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau breakfast
session at which Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley
disclosed he is supporting Mondale and plans to
campaign for him. Bradley said he would do
"whatever he asks me to do within the limits of my
time." Mondale and Bradley later appeared at a
press conference at which the mayor announced his
endorsement publicly.
Earlier, Glenn, reacting to a comment by Mondale
that the senator was basing his campaign on support
of Reaganomics, told the Times: "Can you imagine
anything more stupid than that? And feel free to use
that as a quote."
Glenn accused Mondale of citing his record out of
context and said that although he had voted for
Reagan's 25 percent tax cut, he had cast about 30
votes against various other aspects of the president's
economic record.

Local engineer charged as a Soviet spy
San Francisco — An American engineer has been charged with stealing
and passing to Soviet-bloc agents documents aimed at helping the
United States survive a nuclear attack, the justice Department said
yesterday.
About 100 "extremely sensitive" classified documents allegedly
were passed in a series of 14 meetings over a 4'/j-year period. They
were turned over to Polish intelligence agents who routed them to the
Soviet Union, the lustice Department said.
The documents included information on the Minuteman Intercon
tinental Ballistic Missile and the ballistic missile defense research and
development programs, according to federal authorities.
James Durward Harper, a 49-year-old consulting engineer from
Mountain View, was arrested Saturday morning and held without bail
after a brief appearance yesterday before U.S. Magistrate Owen

Woodruff
FBI officials said Harper allegedly asked his
foreign contact for $1 million and received more
than $250,000 as an operative.
The documents apparently were of tremendous
value to the KGB — the Soviet Committee for State
Security — and had been sought unsuccessfully "all
over the world," according to a federal affidavit.
In September 1981, according to the affidavit, Har
per tried unsuccessfully through a lawyer to request
immunity in exchange for cooperating as a U.S. go
vernment informant and counterintelligence
operative. The lawyer did not reveal his client's
name to the government.
"We did not feel it was proper to offer immunity,"
said William McGivern, a chief assistant U.S. attor
ney in San Francisco. He said the investigation
would continue.
Harper, whose identity was discovered in March,
has cooperated with authorities since his arrest. He
faces an espionage charge that could bring a life
term in prison.
Reagan names McFarlane
Washington — President Reagan named Middle East
special envoy Robert McFarlane as his national se
curity adviser yesterday, saying the former Marine
officer "shares my view about the need for a strong
America."
It was an appointment that dismayed hard-line
conservatives who waged a strong lobbying cam
paign on behalf of U.N. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick.
Reagan declined to be drawn into predictions of
Kirkpatrick's future role in his administration during
a brief news conference and said "as far as I know
she's happy" with her U.N. job.
There have been persistent reports in recent days
that Kirkpatrick was eager to return to Washington,
where she formerly was on the faculty at Geor
getown University.
McFarlane, a 45-year-old former Marine lieutenant
colonel and foreign policy professional who worked
in the Nixon and Ford administrations under Henry
Kissinger, immediately took over the job from
William Clark, nominated as secretary of interior.
The White House job does not require Senate con
firmation.

McFarlane does not have the longtime insider
status with Reagan that Clark enjoyed, nor is he
likely to champion Pentagon and CIA views in
battles with the State Department as much as Clark
did.
Acknowledging that he differs at times with
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and CIA
Director William Casey, McFarlane said:
"My role now is not to be an advocate but to be a
coordinator (of policy). I intend to do that. I don't
expect there will be difficulties."
In his new job, McFarlane will be responsible for
briefing the president each day on foreign policy
developments and summarizing for him the various
options presented by the State Department and
other foreign policy experts. In recent administra
tions, NSC advisers such as Kissinger and Zbigniew
Brzezinski have emerged as top members of the
president's foreign policy appartus.

Reaganomics. Glenn was for it. That's a fundamen
tal. And I don't see how we can serve the public by
trying to avoid discussions."
Mondale discussed his differences with Glenn at a
Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau breakfast
session at which Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley
disclosed he is supporting Mondale and plans to
campaign for him. Bradley said he would do
"whatever he asks me to do within the limits of my
time." Mondale and Bradley later appeared at a
press conference at which the mayor announced his
endorsement publicly.
Earlier, Glenn, reacting to a comment by Mondale
that the senator was basing his campaign on support
of Reaganomics, told the Times: "Can you imagine
anything more stupid than that? And feel free to use
that as a quote."
Glenn accused Mondale of citing his record out of
context and said that although he had voted for
Reagan's 25 percent tax cut, he had cast about 30
votes against various other aspects of the president's
economic record.

Local engineer charged as a Soviet spy
San Francisco — An American engineer has been charged with stealing
and passing to Soviet-bloc agents documents aimed at helping the
United States survive a nuclear attack, the justice Department said
yesterday.
About 100 "extremely sensitive" classified documents allegedly
were passed in a series of 14 meetings over a 4'/j-year period. They
were turned over to Polish intelligence agents who routed them to the
Soviet Union, the lustice Department said.
The documents included information on the Minuteman Intercon
tinental Ballistic Missile and the ballistic missile defense research and
development programs, according to federal authorities.
James Durward Harper, a 49-year-old consulting engineer from
Mountain View, was arrested Saturday morning and held without bail
after a brief appearance yesterday before U.S. Magistrate Owen

Woodruff
FBI officials said Harper allegedly asked his
foreign contact for $1 million and received more
than $250,000 as an operative.
The documents apparently were of tremendous
value to the KGB — the Soviet Committee for State
Security — and had been sought unsuccessfully "all
over the world," according to a federal affidavit.
In September 1981, according to the affidavit, Har
per tried unsuccessfully through a lawyer to request
immunity in exchange for cooperating as a U.S. go
vernment informant and counterintelligence
operative. The lawyer did not reveal his client's
name to the government.
"We did not feel it was proper to offer immunity,"
said William McGivern, a chief assistant U.S. attor
ney in San Francisco. He said the investigation
would continue.
Harper, whose identity was discovered in March,
has cooperated with authorities since his arrest. He
faces an espionage charge that could bring a life
term in prison.
Reagan names McFarlane
Washington — President Reagan named Middle East
special envoy Robert McFarlane as his national se
curity adviser yesterday, saying the former Marine
officer "shares my view about the need for a strong
America."
It was an appointment that dismayed hard-line
conservatives who waged a strong lobbying cam
paign on behalf of U.N. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick.
Reagan declined to be drawn into predictions of
Kirkpatrick's future role in his administration during
a brief news conference and said "as far as I know
she's happy" with her U.N. job.
There have been persistent reports in recent days
that Kirkpatrick was eager to return to Washington,
where she formerly was on the faculty at Geor
getown University.
McFarlane, a 45-year-old former Marine lieutenant
colonel and foreign policy professional who worked
in the Nixon and Ford administrations under Henry
Kissinger, immediately took over the job from
William Clark, nominated as secretary of interior.
The White House job does not require Senate con
firmation.

McFarlane does not have the longtime insider
status with Reagan that Clark enjoyed, nor is he
likely to champion Pentagon and CIA views in
battles with the State Department as much as Clark
did.
Acknowledging that he differs at times with
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and CIA
Director William Casey, McFarlane said:
"My role now is not to be an advocate but to be a
coordinator (of policy). I intend to do that. I don't
expect there will be difficulties."
In his new job, McFarlane will be responsible for
briefing the president each day on foreign policy
developments and summarizing for him the various
options presented by the State Department and
other foreign policy experts. In recent administra
tions, NSC advisers such as Kissinger and Zbigniew
Brzezinski have emerged as top members of the
president's foreign policy appartus.
Cal prof wins Nobel Prize
Berkeley — A UC-Berkelev professor who reinforced
the foundation of economics by proving the theory
of supply and demand was awarded the 1983 Nobel
Prize for economics yesterday.
Gerard Debreu, 62, a French native who became a
U.S. citizen in 1976, is the 12th American to win or
share the economics prize since it was first pre
sented in 1969.
Debreu was acclaimed for applying mathematical
rigor to a relationship that goes to the heart of eco
nomics— how prices determine the quantity of goods
that are bought and sold.
While the theory of supply and demand dates to
the 1776 publication of "The Wealth of Nations" by
Scottish economics pioneer Adam Smith, Debreu's
mathematical models furnished proof that prices do
affect the supply of products as companies seek
maximum profits.
The existence of "market prices" determined by
thousands of consumers and producers thinking
and working independently is the basis of capitalist
economies, and Debreu laid out the conditions nec
essary to achieve this balance or "general equilib
rium" between the supply of goods produced and
the demand for them.
In its citation, the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences said Debreu won "for having incorporated
new analytical methods into economic theory and
for his rigorous reformulation of the theory of gen
eral equilibrium."
The Academy said his "foremost contribution" to

economics is "his clarity, analytical stringency and
insistence on always making a clear-cut distinction
between a theory and its interpretation."
The prize, to he presented Dec. 10 in Stockholm,
comes with a gold medal and a cash award of about
$92,000. Debreu said that he had not thought about
what he would do with the prize money vet. "I do
hope that my lite will not change much," he said at a
press conference in Berkeley.
Reagan revamps 1985 budget
Washington — The Reagan administration has begun
preparing a federal budget for the coming election
year that would be a significant retreat from its previ
ous get-tough budgets, with their drastic curbs on
domestic spending.
The fiscal 1985 budget that President Reagan will
submit to Congress in lanuary probably will call for
no significant new spending cuts, according to offi
cials in the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB). In fact, the administration may not even ask
again for cuts itproposed -and Congress rejected- in
the past.
Reagan still has more than two months to decide
to return to the attack and push Congress for more
deep spending cuts. But at this point, OMB has in
structed government agencies to prepare budgets
for fiscal 1985 that generally reflect fiscal 1984's
budget policy extended for another year. According
to current assumptions about the course of the eco
nomy, that would leave the projected deficit for fis
cal 1985, which begins next Oct. 1, at $170 billion.
And the deficit will not even get down to that level
unless Reagan resubmits all his old spending-cut
proposals.
Mondale will continue criticism
Washington — Former Vice President Walter
Mondale, responding to Sen. John Glenn's warnings
that bickering between the two front-runners for the
Democratic presidential nomination could damage
the ultimate nominee, declared yesterday that dif
ferences between the two are fundamental and that
he would continue to attack Glenn's record.
But Democratic Party officials are increasingly
concerned that if the Mondale-Glenn feud persists,
it will shatter party unity and hurt the Democrat's
chances against President Reagan next year. In fact,
party officials plan to meet with campaign managers
of the seven declared Democratic candidates and

urge that they retrain from attacking each other and
instead reserve their criticism tor Reagan, who yes
terday signed a letter legally making him a candidate
tor re-election.
Glenn, who has engaged in several sharp ex
changes with Mondale during the past week, has
already called for a cease-fire.
But Mondale, declaring that Reagan's economic
program was the "most profound domestic issue"
he has seen in his career, said: "I was against
Reaganomics. Glenn was for it. That's a fundamen
tal. And I don't see how we can serve the public by
trying to avoid discussions."
Mondale discussed his differences with Glenn at a
Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau breakfast
session at which Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley
disclosed he is supporting Mondale and plans to
campaign for him. Bradley said he would do
"whatever he asks me to do within the limits of my
time." Mondale and Bradley later appeared at a
press conference at which the mayor announced his
endorsement publicly.
Earlier, Glenn, reacting to a comment by Mondale
that the senator was basing his campaign on support
of Reaganomics, told the Times: "Can you imagine
anything more stupid than that? And feel free to use
that as a quote."
Glenn accused Mondale of citing his record out of
context and said that although he had voted for
Reagan's 25 percent tax cut, he had cast about 30
votes against various other aspects of the president's
economic record.
