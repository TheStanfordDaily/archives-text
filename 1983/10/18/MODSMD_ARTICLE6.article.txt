# University includes ASSU Recycling in its budget
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff Writer 
ASSU Recycling has picked up something
more valuable than soggy newspapers and
empty Coca-Cola cans.
The University has given the money-losing
project $16,000, thereby making ASSU Recycling
a permanent part of the University's budget.
The project's managers say that the extra
money will allow them to expand their services,
while ASSU officials say it should cover any
future losses Recycling might incur.
Wade Grey, ASSU Recycling project manager
called the University's funding a "saving grace."
He said the new money is being used to
"increase the number of recycling sites, the va
riety of materials we can handle and the sheer
volume of those materials that may be col
lected."
Ihe ASSU has absorbed Recycling's losses
each year since the project began serving the
campus in 1978, according to an ASSU report.
Last year, when losses of more than $10,000
were predicted, the ASSU's Council of Presi
dents (COP) appealed to the University to fund
the loss, saying the continued operation of
campus recycling was cost-beneficial to the Uni
versity.
According to current COP member Peter
Spivack, the report showed the continuation of
the project would save the University from
buying a fourth truck in the near future for its
own garbage service.
Grey said that Recycling sold approximately
$50,000 of waste materials to various buyers, but
spent $60,000 last year. The University picked up
a $10,000 tab to help keep the project alive.
The University's contribution to the project
will be adjusted each year for inflation, Grey
said. Any profits will be turned over to the Uni
versity, Spivak said.
Spivack noted that Recycling is not totally sep
arate from the ASSU, which still handles the ad
ministration and accounting work. He said that
if Recycling wanted to buy more equipment, the
ASSU would be consulted.
Recycling center management includes three
project managers, a full-time site manager and
25 staff members. Managers work six hours a
day, six days a week and are paid about $2 per
hour, while staffers are paid $4.57 an hour, Grey
said.
Presently, 5 to 7 percent of all waste material
on campus is recycled, he said. That equated to
94! tons last year, an increase of 15 percent from
the previous year.

There are now 200 locations on campus for
recycling pickup and more than 300 disposal
barrels, project manager Jen Hill said. The task
now, she noted, is to educate students on the
functions and benefits recycling provides.
Grey said that there are generally three types
of people when it comes to waste material:
those who litter, those who throw away and
those who recycle. "We want to make people
aware of how easy it is to recycle and try to tell
them that if it can be used again, don't throw it
away," he said.
To increase awareness of campus recycling,
slide shows are presented at freshman dorms

throughout the year. Hill said the presentations
explain what materials can be re-used and
where recycling drums are located.
The recycling business is in the midst ot a
boom in the United States, Grey said. Com
panies are paying more this fall tor material than
last spring. Cardboard, for example, is now sold
for $80 a ton, up from last spring's $25.
About 10 tons of newspaper are collected at
the University every week and sold to a firm in
San Jose for reprocessing. Other materials col
lected include glass, computer paper and alumi
num.
