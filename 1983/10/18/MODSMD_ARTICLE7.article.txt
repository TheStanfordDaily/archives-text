## Words reveal prehistory 
### MARCIA HUNT 
Ever wonder how to say hand" in more than
80 American Indian languages?
Extensive collections of such word groups
are the tools of comparative linguistics. Stan
ford Anthropology Prof. Joseph Greenberg has
used them to build a new classification for
native American languages and a new theorv ot
migration to the New World.
Previously, scientists had gene r allv assumed
that the first American*, crossed the Bering Sea
land bridge from Asia to Alaska in two distinct
waves. These groups spread East and South to
populate all of North and South America.
Now Greenberg has identified a third major
American language family, which indicates
three separate migrations.
Moreover, independent research by two
Arizona anthropologists seems to correlate
with and conrirm Greenberg's findings. Dr.
Steven Zegura of the University of Arizona has
traced three genetic blood types in American
Indian populations. Dr. Christy Turner of
Arizona State University has discovered three
distinct tooth formations among these same
groups.
Linguists have previously defined onlv two
major language families: Eskimo-Aleut lan
guages spread across Alaska, Canada and
Greenland and Na-dene tongues prevailing in
the Pacific Northwest and parts of the South
west.
No single root had been found for the many
South American and Eastern North American
languages spoken by about 90 percent of the
native American population. Lacking a general
classification, most linguists have considered
them 200-odd independent families.
Greenberg's classification is not entirely
new. In 1956 he presented a paper arranging
the 200 language groups into 11 large families.
He speculated even then that these were in
turn sub-families of one mother tongue.
Greenberg's "painstaking" compilation of
etvmologies and grammatical analyses for
scores of Indian languages has revealed this
mother tongue, which he calls Amerind. Lan
guage in the Americas, Greenberg's book
detailing his research and findings, is due out
from Stanford University Press next vear.
"The key is to look en masse," comparing
basic words (pronouns, body parts, etc.) in In
dian languages from Canada to the tip of South
America."The languages show striking
similarities," said Greenberg.
The distinctiveness of Amerind, Na-dene and

Eskimo-Aleut families led Greenberg to pro
pose three migrations He hypothesizes that
speakers ot Amerind languages were the first to
migrate to the New World, at least 12,000 to
15,000 vears ago.
The Amerind family shows much more sana
tion among its individual languages than either
\a-dene or Eskimo-Aleut and is spread over a
larger geographical area. These traits implv a
long period of evolution alone in the New
World and as would be expected. Amerind
derivatives are least similar to their earliest
Eurasiatic ipre-migration) roots.
Na-dene speakers came later, about 6000
vears ago. Their languages are more similar to
one another and are spoken in a smaller
region, closer to the assumed land bridge.
Eskimo-Aleut languages show relatively little
internal differentiation and contain marked
resemblances to Eurasiatic languages, includ
ing lapanese and Korean. Greenberg estimates
that this group arrived most recently, roughly
4000 vears ago.
Last November, Greenberg lectured on
Amerind at the University of Arizona. Physical
anthropologist Zegura, a former Stanford un
dergraduate, was in the audience. Zegura ap
proached Greenberg after the lecture to ex
plain his own research on American blood
groups.
Zegura studies frequencies of traits such as
red cell enz\me and serum protein genes in
Indian populations. This allows him to measure
both intragroup genetic similarities and inter
group genetic distinctness. His results show
' population clusters" (groups with like genetic
traits) which match Greenberg's groups.
Zegura also told Greenberg of Turner's work.
Turner has compared dental remains from all
over America. He too finds three major classes,
corresponding to the language and blood
groupings.
Teeth are hard enough to survive for cen
turies, hence they provide a permanent record.
Thev are reliable indicators of genetic relation
ships because they have at least 30 polygenic
features (such as number of roots and molar
cuspsi which evolve only very slowly. The teeth
of living Chilean Indians are almost unchanged
from those of their ancient ancestors, accor
ding to Turner.
Although correlation does not prove
causalitv, Greenberg considers it unlikely that
all three researchers, working independently,
could have come up with such similar results
unless they were correct.

groups.
Linguists have previously defined onlv two
major language families: Eskimo-Aleut lan
guages spread across Alaska, Canada and
Greenland and Na-dene tongues prevailing in
the Pacific Northwest and parts of the South
west.
No single root had been found for the many
South American and Eastern North American
languages spoken by about 90 percent of the
native American population. Lacking a general
classification, most linguists have considered
them 200-odd independent families.
Greenberg's classification is not entirely
new. In 1956 he presented a paper arranging
the 200 language groups into 11 large families.
He speculated even then that these were in
turn sub-families of one mother tongue.
Greenberg's "painstaking" compilation of
etvmologies and grammatical analyses for
scores of Indian languages has revealed this
mother tongue, which he calls Amerind. Lan
guage in the Americas, Greenberg's book
detailing his research and findings, is due out
from Stanford University Press next vear.
"The key is to look en masse," comparing
basic words (pronouns, body parts, etc.) in In
dian languages from Canada to the tip of South
America."The languages show striking
similarities," said Greenberg.
The distinctiveness of Amerind, Na-dene and

Eskimo-Aleut families led Greenberg to pro
pose three migrations He hypothesizes that
speakers ot Amerind languages were the first to
migrate to the New World, at least 12,000 to
15,000 vears ago.
The Amerind family shows much more sana
tion among its individual languages than either
\a-dene or Eskimo-Aleut and is spread over a
larger geographical area. These traits implv a
long period of evolution alone in the New
World and as would be expected. Amerind
derivatives are least similar to their earliest
Eurasiatic ipre-migration) roots.
Na-dene speakers came later, about 6000
vears ago. Their languages are more similar to
one another and are spoken in a smaller
region, closer to the assumed land bridge.
Eskimo-Aleut languages show relatively little
internal differentiation and contain marked
resemblances to Eurasiatic languages, includ
ing lapanese and Korean. Greenberg estimates
that this group arrived most recently, roughly
4000 vears ago.
Last November, Greenberg lectured on
Amerind at the University of Arizona. Physical
anthropologist Zegura, a former Stanford un
dergraduate, was in the audience. Zegura ap
proached Greenberg after the lecture to ex
plain his own research on American blood
groups.
Zegura studies frequencies of traits such as
red cell enz\me and serum protein genes in
Indian populations. This allows him to measure
both intragroup genetic similarities and inter
group genetic distinctness. His results show
' population clusters" (groups with like genetic
traits) which match Greenberg's groups.
Zegura also told Greenberg of Turner's work.
Turner has compared dental remains from all
over America. He too finds three major classes,
corresponding to the language and blood
groupings.
Teeth are hard enough to survive for cen
turies, hence they provide a permanent record.
Thev are reliable indicators of genetic relation
ships because they have at least 30 polygenic
features (such as number of roots and molar
cuspsi which evolve only very slowly. The teeth
of living Chilean Indians are almost unchanged
from those of their ancient ancestors, accor
ding to Turner.
Although correlation does not prove
causalitv, Greenberg considers it unlikely that
all three researchers, working independently,
could have come up with such similar results
unless they were correct.
