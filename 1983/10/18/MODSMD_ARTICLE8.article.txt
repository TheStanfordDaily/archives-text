# Immune response proves potent weapon

### HARA LEVY Staff Writer 
The manufacture ot
monoclonal antibodies has
been hailed as one ot the
20th century's major ad
vances in scientific re
search.
Already valuable as tools
to diagnose disease and
detect cell surtace differ
ences, monoclonal an
tibodies have been tested
for use in cancer therapy by
Dr. Ronald Levy, protessor
of oncology at the Medical
Center.
The first case report of
successful treatment of a
lymphoma cancer using
monoclonal antibodies ap
peared in the March 1982
New England Journal of
Medicine. As part of the re
search team that pioneered
the new treatment, Levy
describes the results as
"encouraging" although he
cautions that it is too soon
to tell precisely what role
the specific antibodies will
play in thwarting precisely
which types of cancer.
Monoclonal antibodies
were first developed by re
searchers George kohler
and Cesar Milstein in 1975,
as a variation of normal an
tibodies, substances
produced by an organism
to attack foreign material
that invades the body.
The combination of an
antigen, matter foreign to
the body, with an antibody
propagates a response that
results in neutralization
and elimination of the
foreign substance.
Apart from this natural
function, antibodies have
been used by researchers
who take advantage of an
tibody specificity to identify
particular molecules or
cells. However, the an
tibody response to antigen
is extremely general.
When a foreign sub
stance enters, the body
responds by making mil
lions of different types of
antibodies directed against
the various antigenic deter
minants (identifying
surface molecules) on the
foreign substance. The tre
mendous number of differ
ent antibodies produced
were virtually impossible to
separate and purify until
Kohler and Milstein

devised their monoclonal
antibodv technique.

results from tusion ot two
different cells: a mouse
myeloma cell (myelomas
are malignant tumors ot the
immune system which
produce large quantities ot
identical antibodies) to a
lymphocyte from the
spleen ot a mouse im
munized with a particular
antigen.
Initially the mouse is in
jected with an antigen that
makes the animal's lym
phocytes produce an
tibodies specific tor that
particular substance. Lym
phocytes containing these
antibodies are extracted
from the spleen of the
mouse. The mouse
myeloma cell is then mixed
and chemically fused with
the lymphocytes. This
process imparts
"immortality" to the lym
phocyte once it is fused to
the myeloma cell.
The resulting hybrid cell
inherits the lymphocyte's
capacity to produce a spe
cific antibody and the
myeloma cell's ability to
produce indefinitely. Once
made, the hybrid cell con

tmues to divide, making
clones of itself that tan be
used to produce an
tibodies. A clone is a
daughter cell which is ge
netically identical to its par
ent. In this case, cloning is
a great advantage because
it provides a natural
"antibody amplifier."
After the original hybrid
cell technique was
developed, kohler made a
mutant myeloma cell that
does not produce any an
tibody. The hybrid cells
made using this mutant
myeloma produce only the
single antibody generated
by the lymphocyte. These
preparations are consid
ered monoclonal an
tibodies because they
come from a single strain of
lymphocyte clones.
Levy and other research
ers have capitalized on the
specificity of monoclonals
to develop a potentially
powerful treatment for
some types of cancer. In
jected antibodies created
by the monoclonal tech
nique attack cancerous
cells while leaving normal
cells intact.
Currently, it takes Levy's
team an average of six
months to produce enough

antibody to treat a single
patient, at a cost of $50,000.
Each of the 26 patients
whom Levy has treated with
monoclonal antibodies suf
fered from one of several
types of lymphoma and
leukemia. These cancer va
rieties are especially
amenable to the
monoclonal treatment be
cause the cancer circulates
in the blood stream and is
therefore most accessible
to the injected antibodies.
"Other universities and
research institutions across
the United States have
begun to explore the use of
monoclonals on virtually
every kind of cancer al
though none of the pro
grams have yet developed
to the point of accepting
patients," said Levy.
While Levy uses the an
tibodies by themselves in
treatment, other research
ers are investigating the
possibility of tagging the
antibody proteins with tar
geted radioactive isotopes
or chemical poisons which
they aim exclusively at can
cer cells. In this way they
spare the healthy tissue
that is inadvertantly killed
through conventional can
cer treatments.

ANTIBODY AMPLIFICATION: This is the goal of the immune system based anti-cancer
scheme detailed above. By manufacturing "immortal" cell lines which only attack cancer
cells, researchers hope to improve patients' chances of survival. When a molecule with
several different surface features (antigenic determinants) enters an animal's body, lym
phocytes produce molecules that selectively attack the determinants. The monoclonal tech
nique (b) isolates molecules specific to particular determinants whereas the conventional
approach (a) yields a non-specific mixture.

ANTIBODY AMPLIFICATION: This is the goal of the immune system based anti-cancer
scheme detailed above. By manufacturing "immortal" cell lines which only attack cancer
cells, researchers hope to improve patients' chances of survival. When a molecule with
several different surface features (antigenic determinants) enters an animal's body, lym
phocytes produce molecules that selectively attack the determinants. The monoclonal tech
nique (b) isolates molecules specific to particular determinants whereas the conventional
approach (a) yields a non-specific mixture.
The manufacture ot
monoclonal antibodies has
been hailed as one ot the
20th century's major ad
vances in scientific re
search.
Already valuable as tools
to diagnose disease and
detect cell surtace differ
ences, monoclonal an
tibodies have been tested
for use in cancer therapy by
Dr. Ronald Levy, protessor
of oncology at the Medical
Center.
The first case report of
successful treatment of a
lymphoma cancer using
monoclonal antibodies ap
peared in the March 1982
New England Journal of
Medicine. As part of the re
search team that pioneered
the new treatment, Levy
describes the results as
"encouraging" although he
cautions that it is too soon
to tell precisely what role
the specific antibodies will
play in thwarting precisely
which types of cancer.
Monoclonal antibodies
were first developed by re
searchers George kohler
and Cesar Milstein in 1975,
as a variation of normal an
tibodies, substances
produced by an organism
to attack foreign material
that invades the body.
The combination of an
antigen, matter foreign to
the body, with an antibody
propagates a response that
results in neutralization
and elimination of the
foreign substance.
Apart from this natural
function, antibodies have
been used by researchers
who take advantage of an
tibody specificity to identify
particular molecules or
cells. However, the an
tibody response to antigen
is extremely general.
When a foreign sub
stance enters, the body
responds by making mil
lions of different types of
antibodies directed against
the various antigenic deter
minants (identifying
surface molecules) on the
foreign substance. The tre
mendous number of differ
ent antibodies produced
were virtually impossible to
separate and purify until
Kohler and Milstein

devised their monoclonal
antibodv technique.

results from tusion ot two
different cells: a mouse
myeloma cell (myelomas
are malignant tumors ot the
immune system which
produce large quantities ot
identical antibodies) to a
lymphocyte from the
spleen ot a mouse im
munized with a particular
antigen.
Initially the mouse is in
jected with an antigen that
makes the animal's lym
phocytes produce an
tibodies specific tor that
particular substance. Lym
phocytes containing these
antibodies are extracted
from the spleen of the
mouse. The mouse
myeloma cell is then mixed
and chemically fused with
the lymphocytes. This
process imparts
"immortality" to the lym
phocyte once it is fused to
the myeloma cell.
The resulting hybrid cell
inherits the lymphocyte's
capacity to produce a spe
cific antibody and the
myeloma cell's ability to
produce indefinitely. Once
made, the hybrid cell con

tmues to divide, making
clones of itself that tan be
used to produce an
tibodies. A clone is a
daughter cell which is ge
netically identical to its par
ent. In this case, cloning is
a great advantage because
it provides a natural
"antibody amplifier."
After the original hybrid
cell technique was
developed, kohler made a
mutant myeloma cell that
does not produce any an
tibody. The hybrid cells
made using this mutant
myeloma produce only the
single antibody generated
by the lymphocyte. These
preparations are consid
ered monoclonal an
tibodies because they
come from a single strain of
lymphocyte clones.
Levy and other research
ers have capitalized on the
specificity of monoclonals
to develop a potentially
powerful treatment for
some types of cancer. In
jected antibodies created
by the monoclonal tech
nique attack cancerous
cells while leaving normal
cells intact.
Currently, it takes Levy's
team an average of six
months to produce enough

antibody to treat a single
patient, at a cost of $50,000.
Each of the 26 patients
whom Levy has treated with
monoclonal antibodies suf
fered from one of several
types of lymphoma and
leukemia. These cancer va
rieties are especially
amenable to the
monoclonal treatment be
cause the cancer circulates
in the blood stream and is
therefore most accessible
to the injected antibodies.
"Other universities and
research institutions across
the United States have
begun to explore the use of
monoclonals on virtually
every kind of cancer al
though none of the pro
grams have yet developed
to the point of accepting
patients," said Levy.
While Levy uses the an
tibodies by themselves in
treatment, other research
ers are investigating the
possibility of tagging the
antibody proteins with tar
geted radioactive isotopes
or chemical poisons which
they aim exclusively at can
cer cells. In this way they
spare the healthy tissue
that is inadvertantly killed
through conventional can
cer treatments.
