# Soviet relations assessed as tense
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
A two-member faculty panel last
night assessed perceptions that the
United States and the Soviet Union
hold about each other and con
cluded that recent relations have
been particularly tense.
Prof. Coit Blacker and Assoc.
Prof. Condoleezza Rice, both of the
political science department, dis
cussed how the recent downing of
the South Korean Air Lines jet has
aggravated the problem, but they
also proposed how arms control
agreements might serve to contain
the antagonism.
Blacker characterized the present
"as a very tense period," and as
"aggravated but restrained from as
sault." He said that the competitive
atmosphere stemmed from the view
of the president that "communism
is organic," and that the Soviet
Union, the embodiment of that
communism, must be destroyed or
contained.
Similarly, the USSR doesn't place
much faith in the arms control talks
because it regards the United States
as a spreading, hostile force.
"Perceptions seldom accord with
reality," Blacker concluded.
Rice said that a more confronta
tional attitude has existed as early as
the last year of the Carter Adminis
tration. She explained that the elec
tion of a "bellicose, rhetorical, and
polemical" Reagan frustrated the
Soviets, since they believed they
couldn't strike rational deals with
him as they did with Nixon.
The death of Brezhnev removed
most of the remaining Soviet cau
tion, since it was the late Soviet
leader who identified with a policy
of detente.
Rice admitted that recently U.S.-
Soviet relations showed some signs
of improving until the downing of
the South Korean Air Lines jet
proved to be a "crucial juncture."
What was being directed
towards more conciliation sudden
ly went towards more confronta
tion," she said.
Blacker noted that an inevitable
U.S. reaction to the incident helped
increase the atmosphere of con
frontation between the two
countries. "The way the president
responded at the outset was a very
true reaction," he said.
Vet hard-core rightists threatened
to "out-Reagan Ronald Reagan."
Identifying the need to protect him
self politically, the president later
reverted to describing the incident
in much more confrontational rhet
oric.
Both Rice and Blacker advocated
some form of arms control in the
face of increasing tensions.
Blacker stressed arms control
should involve a lessening of the
obsession with absolute numbers.
"Eight thousand can incinerate you
just as effectively as 10,000," he
pointed out.
The two countries must concep
tualize the problem of nuclear
weapons by focusing on the situa
tions that might catalyze their use.
Since "nuclear weapons are here to
stay, " the United States and the So
viet Union must concentrate on
avoiding their use, according to the
panelists.
Rice emphasized that "the most
urgent thing is to conclude some
kind, any kind, of arms control
agreement." She described the
arms race as a force continually
moving upward in a spiral.
Rice predicted that the world
today is entering a new phase of the
arms race and that it would find
reaching an agreement now much
more attainable now than later.
