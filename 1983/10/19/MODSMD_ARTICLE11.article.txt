"(Board of Trustees President William) Kim
ball favors broad representation on the study
committee, including individuals from the Uni
versity, the Hoover Institution, and outsiders
not connected with Stanford."
Campus Report, July 13,1983
According to this summer report in the Uni
versity News Service's publication, the presi
dent of the Board of Trustees initially sup
ported the inclusion of representatives or tf
Stanford community on the panel investiga>
ing the ties between the University and the
Hoover Institution.
In fact, Kimball told The Daily early in July
that the ad hoc committee established to
formulate a policy for the Hoover-Stanford in
quiry had three purposes: to "study the whole
situation," to draw up a slate of nominations of
potential members of a larger committee to
study the issue, and to make a charge to that
committee.
Vet when Kimball's ad hoc committee re
ported in September, it merely named its own
members to the continuing investigative com
mittee.
This ad hoc committee, formed in June in
response to the Faculty Senate's request for an
investigation into the relations between Stan
ford and the Hoover Institution, was originally
not intended to become a continuing inves
tigative panel.
Following a student and faculty petition
drive last spring citing Hoover's alleged par
tisanship, the senate had voted to charge the
Board of Trustees to appoint a committee to
"explore and reassess" the ties between the
Institution and the University. But rather than
leaping into the study, Kimball responded to
this charge by appointing trustees Warren
Christopher, Frank Tatum and Nancy Barry
Munger and himself to an ad hoc investigative
group assigned to examine just how the
Hoover-Stanford study should be conducted.
The panel met on and off during the summer,

and issued a report at the Sept. 13 Board
meeting.
In their report, the ad hoc committee mem
bers said they had concluded that "the subject
of the Hoover Institution is one of direct and
special interest to the Stanford Board of Trus
tees" and named themselves to the continuing
committee.
We agree that the Hoover investigation is of
snecial interest to the Board; but it is also of
g eat interest to students, faculty and staff who
are not represented on the committee.
University President Donald Kennedy
defended the composition of the committee at
the Faculty Senate meeting last week by saying
that the committee might "co-opt others to
give them information and advice." While this
is a commendable policy, it seems a poor sub
stitute for actually including students and fac
ulty representatives on the committee.
In addition, several opponents of the
Hoover Institution have criticized the make
up of the committee: Munger serves on the
Hoover Board of Overseers, and Kennedy, an
ex-officio member of the investigative commit
tee, and Kimball are ex-officio Overseers.
While the composition of the committee does
not per se prejudice the handling of the inves
tigation, the University could avoid ch r ges
like these by including other representatives.
In a letter last week to Kimball, three student
members of the Trustee Committee on Aca
demic Affairs and Development said that the
trustees were "deprived of whatever benefit
results from participation of members of the
student body and faculty" by their exclusion
ary policy. We agree completely.
The trustees would best be served by re
turning to their original plan to include other
members of the Stanford community on the
investigative panel. Otherwise, the exclusion
ary and inequitable appearance of the study
may cause it to be labeled unjust, no matter
how fair its deliberations may be.
