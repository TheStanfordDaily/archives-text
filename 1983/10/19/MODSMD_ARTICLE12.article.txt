# Dink: dim, dank, dreary

Question: What has 700 seats, no desks, lim
ited lighting and a disgruntled classroom of
students who have to squint to see their
professor and cross their legs to balance their
notebooks in their laps?
Answer: Dinkelspiel Auditorium, of course.
Having a class in Dink can be bothersome.
Having several hours of classes in Dink right in
a row — a fate suffered by many students for at
least the last two quarters — can practically ruin
one's quarter. . . and one's eyes.
In the heart of White Plaza, Dink is a com
mon site of some of the University's most
popular classes. Yet because of its poor light
ing, Jack of tabletops and huge, airy imper
sonality, it is rightfully one of the least popular
locations.
Dink, designed as a music hall, is not exactly
academically stimulating. Students struggle to
balance their books and papers in their laps,
compete for the few seats directly under the
dim light sources and strain their ears and
eyes from the back rows. And while Dink is

usually reserved for recitals and speeches in
the afternoons and evenings, mornings find it
surrounded by bicycles and inhabited by
bleary-eyed classgoers.
Clearly there is a problem here. Dink is one
of the largest classrooms on campus, and thus
is an indispensable facility. Although classes
are often scheduled elsewhere, frequently
they are rescheduled at Dink because of unex
pectedly large enrollment. Last spring, Eco
nomics 1 and "Criminal Law" met at Dink — two
and a half hours straight for some students.
Currently the human biology core classes
meet there three times a week for two straight
hours.
What's a university to do? We suggest a
simple — or perhaps not simple but neverthe
less necessary — overhaul of the interior. If
classes are going to be held in an auditorium
which is unequipped for such activity, then
changes must be made. Put in lights. Build
those sliding, hideaway lecture hall desks.
Turn upthe heat. Fix Dink.
