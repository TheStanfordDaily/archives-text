# A 						quiet look at abortion
## 
### 
The legality of abortion is one of the most hotly
debated moral issues of our time. Debaters on both
sides have worked themselves into a frenzy, invoking
arguments ranging from constitutional prerogatives to
the word of God. At times, it seems that the rhetoric
becomes so heated that both sides lose sight of what
they are arguing about. They get so engrossed in the
issues that they lose sight of the humanity of the issue:
the trauma of an unwed pregnant teenager facing the
future.
Abortion opponents usually argue that abortion is
wrong for moral and religious reasons. Many of them
are Bible-citing Christians. They say that life begins at
conception, so abortion is murder. However, the
Bible makes it clear that fetuses are treated differently
from people. According to one translation, "And if
men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so
that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow, he shall
surely be fined, according as the woman's husband
shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges
determine" (Exodus 21:22). The death of a fetus is
treated far more lightly than murder.
However, Christianity is not the basis for American
law. No religion can impose its values on others.
Other religions have different moral standards. For ex
ample, under Jewish law abortion is sometimes per
mitted. If the health of the mother is seriously endan
gered, an abortion can even be legally required. And,
whatever the source, no religious ruling should be
given the force of law.
Abortion supporters say that they aren't forcing
anyone to have an abortion, that they just want to give
women a choice. However, it is hard to see how
anyone who goes to a "drop in" abortion center will
have a chance to carefully consider all her options.
Similar "family planning" clinics have appeared in
many cities. Even the Palo Alto phonebook lists two
clinics that advertise abortions.
Legally, any patient about to undergo an operation
must give informed consent. They must agree to the
operation knowing its consequences, side effects, and
possible alternatives. Some abortion and family plan
ning clinics perform abortions after less counseling
than most plastic surgeons give their facelift patients.
At a minimum, the counseling should include a dis
cussion of possible post-abortion mental trauma, and

information on alternatives to abortion such as adop
tion.
Certainly, abortion should not become just another
type of birth control. If someone keeps coming back
for abortions, something is wrong. While abortion
should be kept legal, perhaps there should be some
sort of control put on it, to keep it from being reduced
to this level.
In the recent years, following the Supreme Court
ruling that abortions are legal, much of the abortion
fight has focused on abortion funding. Many women
who want abortions are poor. They want Medicare to
pay for them, just as it does for other medical care.
They have claimed that the constitution guarantees
them equal access to abortions. While this argument
has some validity, there must be a limit. For example,
Medicare will not pay for cosmetic surgery, even tor
psychological reasons. There is a huge grey area as to
when an abortion is medically necessary, and oppo
nents can argue that it is never really necessary.
Anti-abortionists say that even if abortion is legal,
they don't want to pay for them through taxes. Other
groups have used the same arguments. For example,
pacifists have refused to help pay for weapons. For
better or worse, their arguments were not accepted by
the Supreme Court.
From a moral point of view, however, their argu
ments do seem to have some merit. Forcing someone
to pay for something they consider terribl\ immoral
does seem reprehensible. And, there is nothing in the
United States Constitution that guarantees reedom of
abortion on demand.
This is a very tough problem, and there is probably
no solution that will satisfy everyone. One possibility
might be to have a private foundation to pay for abor
tions for the poor. But, pro-choicers would probably
object to paying more than their share of the cost.
Another possibility might be to have a box on income
tax forms to designate $1 to fund abortions, just like
the presidential campaign fund.
Whatever solution is tried, one thing is clear. Until
both sides calm down, listen to each other, and
respond to their concerns, the controversy will keep
boiling, and little progress will be made.
