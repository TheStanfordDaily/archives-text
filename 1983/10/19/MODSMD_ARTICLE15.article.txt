Diversity of opinions
Among the reasons I came to
Stanford, and on a greater scale,
went to a mid-sized college, was
for the diversity of backgrounds,
race, religion, and political think
ing. It is, to my understanding, a
main reason that universities exist.
But now all I have been hearing
about and reading in The Daily are
complaints about diversity; namely
complaints about the Hoover
Institution and the Reagan Library.
Maybe I am naive, being a fresh
man, since I have only been here
for about three weeks. My impres
sion, though, is that lots of the
faculty and the students on
campus are fairly liberal, or else
there is just a very vocal liberal
contingent. This is an asset; it
provides diversity. However, it
also seems to mean that many
persons do not like people of a
conservative bent (or their
thoughts), even if their numbers
are few or if they are not as vocal.
I was told at a speech in my
dorm (Branner) that the Hoover
Institution has approximately one
Social Democrat, about 13
Republicans (of whom a few have
served in the Reagan administra
tion and therefore put them in the
limelight), and 15 or 16 Democrats.
Furthermore, it was said that if the
Reagan Library and Policy Center
are built, they would have facilities
for (at most) 25 visiting scholars.
Of these, it is highly doubtful that
they would all be conservatives.
Therefore, it seems unlikely that
the Hoover Institution and the
proposed library would dominate
the campus in thought or political
representation. Stanford would
not even come close to being
renamed Ronald Reagan Jr. Uni
versity (and its incomparable
marching band). All that the
Hoover Institution does and the
library could do are add to the
diversity and the academic envi
ronment of this university.

Because of the size of and/or
vocalify of the Stanford liberals
(students and faculty alike) it ap
pears that a diversity of thought is
being stagnated by noise from the
more liberal (until it comes to
differing viewpoints on campus)
parts of the Stanford University
campus.

Garbage receptacles
I don't think it is nearly so dis
turbing that garbage cans are not
located at remote locations on
Campus and Palm Drives as it is
that anyone feels this justifies
"hiding his soda can behind a
palm."
Responsible people don't litter.
Carrying a can for 20 minutes to a

trash bin does not strike me as a
great burden. Far greater is the
burden to the community of
cleaning up after people who
won't clean up after themselves.

Parking fees
This letter is in response to the
recent article "USW protests $40
increase in permits" (Daily, Oct. 6)
We urge the entire Stanford com
munity to support USW's efforts
to do something about the out
rageous parking fees at Stanford.
First, the parking fees are a
hardship on all of us, but they are
especially hard on women who
can't afford $100 'A' stickers and
are forced to walk long distances
to work from the cheaper 'C'

lots, often in the dark. In view of
the number of assaults on women
at Stanford, why should safety be
the privilege of those who can
afford $100?
Second, why should parking
convenience be the privilege of
those who can afford $100? Why
should administrators who make
$40,000/ year or more get to park
near work, while workers earn
one-half of that have to hike in
from the 'C' lots?
The University's premise is that
parking near your campus
workplace is a privilege and
luxury. We disagree. For those
who work here, parking is a
necessity, not a luxury. It is a
right, not a privilege. Stanford has
the obligation to provide each
building with sufficient, nearby
and environmentally acceptable

parking areas, just as it has the
obligation to provide sufficient
restroom and food facilities.
There is a USW petition circulat
ing. Please sign it. If we don't
speak up as a community, we may
be faced with even higher fees
next year and less 'C' parking.
The University must get the
message that if they continue this
way and if they don't provide fair
and safe parking, they risk facing a
community-wide boycott of the
sticker system next year.

Gregorio Cortez
How many times will Gregorio
Cortez be misunderstood before
people begin to comprehend what

is to them still foreign. Again our
haunting condemnation surfaces
its all too familiar face — the more
things change the more they
remain the same. If seen without
cultural blinders, "The Ballad of
Gregorio Cortez" is not a "pushy,
weepy" or "manipulative" movie
(Daily, Oct. 13), but a movie that
projects the essence of Mexican
heritage — "Familia."
The Daily critic's first misun
derstanding or oversight is his
simple statement that Cortez was
captured. This simple statement
denies the movie of its sig
nificance. In one of the many
splendidly photographed scenes,
Cortez is shown contemplating the
Rio Grande. After weeks of
eluding the Texas Rangers, he has
finally arrived. His freedom is at
hand, but how could he leave his
wife and children behind?
Gregorio Cortez was not
captured; he turned himself in.
He had to return to his family.
The second misunderstanding
came when the critic called this
movie "manipulative." This movie
is not manipulative. That is the
beauty of the movie, it neither
glorifies nor condemns Cortez (it
also does not glorify or condemn
the Texas Rangers).
The warm, glowing unity of
Gregorio Cortez' family, the warm
glowing unity of the Mexican,
Chicano, Hispanic (label it what
you want) family — this is what is so
passionately and delicately
portrayed in "The Ballad of
Gregorio Cortez."
Please see "The Ballad of
Gregorio Cortez." Please see the
tragic misunderstanding of
Gregorio Cortez, but please do
not misunderstand him again. In
these very sad days when the idea
of family seems so archaic, I urge
you to take comfort as I did by
watching this incredible movie.
