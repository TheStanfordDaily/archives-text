# Toward Your Health: Jack Martin
## Running the Dish made easy — step by step by step 
### 
One of the nice things
about Stanford is that it af
fords plenty of opportunities
to exercise. In order to maxi
mize the benefits of exercise
and minimize injuries, it is im
portant to follow certain
procedures while doing
physical activity. To illustrate
these procedures I would like
to take you on one of the
more popular exercise activi
ties at Stanford — a run up to
the radar telescope, more
commonly known as the
"Dish Run." So put on your
r unning shoes and let's get
started!
Before actually beginning
tr > run we should do some

warm-up and stretching activ
ities. Let's start by going over
to Roble Field, taking off our
shoes and socks, and walking
or jogging slowly around the
field for 5-10 minutes.
Easy warm-up activity helps
to loosen the muscles and
should be done prior to
stretching. Swing the arms,
rotate the shoulders and
neck, and generally do some
slow and easy movements.
Doing this activity barefoot
helps to strengthen the
muscle structure of the feet.
Shoes tend to act as a kind of
cast, protecting feet but also
limiting their motion. The
result is that the muscles in

the foot atrophy and going
barefoot helps to overcome
this problem.
After warming up it is time
to do some stretching.
"Static" stretching — meaning
that we should hold the
stretch for 15-30 seconds — is
the best method. "Dynamic"
stretching — or bouncing
—extends the muscle beyond

Lisa Waltuch/Daily
its normal range thereby
creating little tears in the
muscle. When the body re
pairs these tears the result is a
shortening of the muscle.
Thus the net result of dynamic
stretching is to shorten the
muscle rather than to
lengthen it.
The main point to keep in
mind while stretching is that

you want to feel the stretch
but not to the point of strain
and certainly not to the extent
that is painful. Stretching
should be relaxing and en
joyable, not a test to see how
much you can contort your
self. It is particularly impor
tant to keep your back
straight and to avoid putting
stress on a joint, such as the
knee. A good guideline is to
stretch for as long as you plan
to exercise, but take at least
10-15 minutes each time you
work out.
There are two other things
to do before setting out. First
of all, get a drink of water.
Drinking is especially impor
tant when it's warm, but some
water should be taken even
on cool days. Fancy replace
ment drinks are OK, but plain
water is absorbed quickly and
the normal diet usually con
tains sufficient replacements
for the salt and other minerals
lost during exercise. Most ex
perts now agree that taking

salt tablets is unwise. Second
ly, we should make sure our
shoelaces are securely tied.
Loose shoes can injure the
feet.
At last we are off and run
ning. Let's head out to the left
of Roble Hall, past the Boat
house, and toward the Kappa
Alpha house. At the start of a
run it is a good idea to go at a
slower pace than the average
for the run as a whole. In this
regard the motto of the Angell
Field regulars, the faculty and
staff running group, comes to
mind: "Start off slowly and
taper off."
Continuing on the route,
cross Campus Drive, head
along Cerona, and cut over
toward the Gate 2 entrance to
the Dish. Talk a little during
the run A good way to avoid
overexertion while running is
to use the "talk test." You
should be able to carry on a
conversation in a fairly nor
mal manner while running. If
you can barely . . . get . . . the

. . . words . . . out . . . be
tween gasps for air — you are
going too fast.
Heart rate provides an accu
rate measure of intensity.
Each person has maximum
heart rate which can be
figured by subtracting age
from the number 220.
The best way to check your
heart rate is to stop briefly
and take your pulse for 10
seconds. Multiply this num
ber by six to get the one min
ute rate.
Well, we have crossed
Junipero Serra and hopped
over Gate 2. The route up to
the Dish looks tough and I'm
getting tired. Let's finish our
run next Wednesday when we
will go over how to run hills,
speed running, and what to
do after the run is over.

One of the nice things
about Stanford is that it af
fords plenty of opportunities
to exercise. In order to maxi
mize the benefits of exercise
and minimize injuries, it is im
portant to follow certain
procedures while doing
physical activity. To illustrate
these procedures I would like
to take you on one of the
more popular exercise activi
ties at Stanford — a run up to
the radar telescope, more
commonly known as the
"Dish Run." So put on your
r unning shoes and let's get
started!
Before actually beginning
tr > run we should do some

warm-up and stretching activ
ities. Let's start by going over
to Roble Field, taking off our
shoes and socks, and walking
or jogging slowly around the
field for 5-10 minutes.
Easy warm-up activity helps
to loosen the muscles and
should be done prior to
stretching. Swing the arms,
rotate the shoulders and
neck, and generally do some
slow and easy movements.
Doing this activity barefoot
helps to strengthen the
muscle structure of the feet.
Shoes tend to act as a kind of
cast, protecting feet but also
limiting their motion. The
result is that the muscles in

the foot atrophy and going
barefoot helps to overcome
this problem.
After warming up it is time
to do some stretching.
"Static" stretching — meaning
that we should hold the
stretch for 15-30 seconds — is
the best method. "Dynamic"
stretching — or bouncing
—extends the muscle beyond

Lisa Waltuch/Daily
its normal range thereby
creating little tears in the
muscle. When the body re
pairs these tears the result is a
shortening of the muscle.
Thus the net result of dynamic
stretching is to shorten the
muscle rather than to
lengthen it.
The main point to keep in
mind while stretching is that

you want to feel the stretch
but not to the point of strain
and certainly not to the extent
that is painful. Stretching
should be relaxing and en
joyable, not a test to see how
much you can contort your
self. It is particularly impor
tant to keep your back
straight and to avoid putting
stress on a joint, such as the
knee. A good guideline is to
stretch for as long as you plan
to exercise, but take at least
10-15 minutes each time you
work out.
There are two other things
to do before setting out. First
of all, get a drink of water.
Drinking is especially impor
tant when it's warm, but some
water should be taken even
on cool days. Fancy replace
ment drinks are OK, but plain
water is absorbed quickly and
the normal diet usually con
tains sufficient replacements
for the salt and other minerals
lost during exercise. Most ex
perts now agree that taking

salt tablets is unwise. Second
ly, we should make sure our
shoelaces are securely tied.
Loose shoes can injure the
feet.
At last we are off and run
ning. Let's head out to the left
of Roble Hall, past the Boat
house, and toward the Kappa
Alpha house. At the start of a
run it is a good idea to go at a
