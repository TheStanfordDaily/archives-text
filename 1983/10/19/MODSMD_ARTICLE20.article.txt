# Dishing out radio waves on the hills

Jogging is not the only ac
tivity taking place at the Dish
these days.
The transmitters in the hill
are more than landmarks for
athletes, according to John
Schlobohm, associate direc

research firm in Menlo Park.

much as 12-14 hours a day,
seven days a week."
"There were many experi

things", said Von Eshleman,
professor of electrical engi
neering and assistant dean for
research in engineering. "The

to contact the Pioneer spacecraft which
was losing the ability to communicate
with NASA ground stations, Raley said.

was a possibility of very rapidly contact

"We study how radio waves

research."
Radar research, said Schol
bohm, is concerned with de
tecting targets including
satellites, meteors, planets
and the moon.
SRI built and maintains the
Dish, but they are not the
only group that benefits from
the radio telescope. SRI,
which was part of the Univer
sity until a decade ago, was
very closely associated with
Stanford's Star Lab in the past,
said Lon Raley, Star Lab ad
ministrative assistant "There
was a joint effort to do radar
astronomy. If you totaled up
the number of hours the Dish

early '70s, we did a lot of

transmitted up to the moon
and picked up energy

could then study characteris

moon," he added.

was an attempt to contact the
Pioneer spacecraft which was
losing the ability to communi

stations, Raley said.
"We were interested in
whether there was a pos
sibility of very rapidly contact

another frequency. Using the
Dish as the transmitting an
tenna, we were successful,"
he said.
"The dish did a marvelous
job. Because of the project's
success NASA changed its
operations. Current

spacecraft are different. NASA
was building spacecraft with
only one telemetry channel;
the essential difference now
is because we proved that two
are needed: one high and
one low. The differential ef
fect is then used to do radio
science."
SRI used the dish in con
junction with scientific organ
izations around the world.
Scientists attempted to detect
Haley's Comet, but were un
successful. More recently,
satellites passing close to
Saturn detected lightning on
the planet's surface and SRI
scientists attempted to detect
it through radio transmission,
he said.
"We were interested to
view this from earth, and used
the dish for transmitting and
receiving, but at this point we
have not yet observed any
lightning," he said.
Built in 1960, the dish cost
approximately a half million
dollars, Schlobohm said.
Maintenance entails repairing
the roof on the structure,
oiling and maintaining the
drive mechanisms, caring for
the transmitters and the com
puter which controls
positioning of the antenna.
While the large dish was
used tor the work involving
the Pioneer spacecraft and
the Mariner 5 which went to
Venus, there are smaller
dishes in the hills which are
used for other experiments.
According to Raley, every
now and then a story comes
out in the local paper con
cerning the possiblity of
taking the dish down and
transporting it to Alaska. "It is
talked about, but never done.
I doubt if it is feasible; I don't
think the dish was built with
portability in mind," he said.

was losing the ability to communicate
with NASA ground stations, Raley said.

Radar research, said Schol
bohm, is concerned with de
tecting targets including
satellites, meteors, planets
and the moon.
SRI built and maintains the
Dish, but they are not the
only group that benefits from
the radio telescope. SRI,
which was part of the Univer
sity until a decade ago, was
very closely associated with
Stanford's Star Lab in the past,
said Lon Raley, Star Lab ad
ministrative assistant "There
was a joint effort to do radar
astronomy. If you totaled up
the number of hours the Dish
was used in the late 1960s and
early '70s, we did a lot of

used it to study the moon. We
transmitted up to the moon
and picked up energy
reflected by the moon that
comes back to earth. We
could then study characteris
tics ot the surface of the
moon," he added.
Their most recent project
was an attempt to contact the
Pioneer spacecraft which was
losing the ability to communi
cate with the NASA ground
stations, Raley said.
"We were interested in
whether there was a pos
sibility of very rapidly contact
ing the spacecraft through
another frequency. Using the
Dish as the transmitting an
tenna, we were successful,"
he said.
"The dish did a marvelous
job. Because of the project's
success NASA changed its
operations. Current

spacecraft are different. NASA
was building spacecraft with
only one telemetry channel;
the essential difference now
is because we proved that two
are needed: one high and
one low. The differential ef
fect is then used to do radio
science."
SRI used the dish in con
junction with scientific organ
izations around the world.
Scientists attempted to detect
Haley's Comet, but were un
successful. More recently,
satellites passing close to
Saturn detected lightning on
the planet's surface and SRI
scientists attempted to detect
it through radio transmission,
he said.
"We were interested to
view this from earth, and used
the dish for transmitting and
receiving, but at this point we
have not yet observed any
lightning," he said.
Built in 1960, the dish cost
approximately a half million
dollars, Schlobohm said.
Maintenance entails repairing
the roof on the structure,
oiling and maintaining the
drive mechanisms, caring for
the transmitters and the com
puter which controls
positioning of the antenna.
While the large dish was
used tor the work involving
the Pioneer spacecraft and
the Mariner 5 which went to
Venus, there are smaller
dishes in the hills which are
used for other experiments.
According to Raley, every
now and then a story comes
out in the local paper con
cerning the possiblity of
taking the dish down and
transporting it to Alaska. "It is
talked about, but never done.
I doubt if it is feasible; I don't
think the dish was built with
portability in mind," he said.

such diverse projects as tracking down lightning on Saturn
and studying the surface of the moon.
