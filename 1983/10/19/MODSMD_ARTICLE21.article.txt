## On the Mark Mark Zeigler Winning is nice, but it's not necessary 
### 
The hum of the engines seemed
louder than usual on Air Cal's
charter flight from Seattle to San
lose last Saturday night. That's
probably because the only sound
in the cabin was the chatting of the
stewardesses.
As the plane descended into the
Bay Area through crystal clear
skies, a fantastic view of the night
lights awaited anyone willing to sit
up in his seat and peer out the win
dow. Few bothered to look.
There were reasons for all this.
Stanford had lost a football game
that afternoon. Though the
scoreboard showed a Stanford loss
by 17 points, it wasn't that close.
Washington, Stanford's opponent,
led 32-3 at one point and squan
dered two prime scoring chances.
Stanford was lucky to lose by 17
points.
But the score, like the view out
the plane window, didn't matter.
What mattered was that the loss to
Washington dropped Stanford's
record to 0-6. Zero and six. Think
of it. Six games, six losses. No wins.
Not a single victory.
Evidence of a losing season
grows with each loss. The letters
begin to flow. Students write home
to their parents. "Dear Mom and
Dad, The weather is nice, classes
are fine and the football team
sucks." The same is said between
the hello's and goodbye's of phone
calls.
Attendance begins to plummet at
home games. Scalpers get less and
less for their "50-yard-line" tickets.
Boos outnumber cheers at the
stadium.
But in this most miserable of
miserable seasons, something is
being left behind. Like a mother
leaving her child in a shopping cart
at the supermarket. Stanford as a
community and as a football team
is forgetting a basic — its purpose in
the first place.
Stanford University is just that, a
university ... as in education.
Stanford is not a professional foot
ball franchise. It has a football
team, but it belongs to the National
Collegiate Athletic Assocation with

special emphasis on collegiate.
Though it may not be the case at
some other schools in America,

Stanford athletes aren't here solely
to play sports. They also are here to
learn.

That simple idea has been lost
this season, hidden behind the
large goose egg occupying Stan
ford's win column. With each loss,
it gets filed farther and farther into
the back forty of the mind.
Granted, Stanford is by no means
playing good football this season.
It has come close to winning once —
against UCLA two weeks ago — only
to see its lead vanish in the span of
30 seconds.
The 1983 season is nothing like a
year ago, when John Elway and
company could have easily gone 9-
2 or 10-1 minus a few fourth
quarter errors and lapses of luck.
Elway's team went 5-6, but the op
portunity to reverse five of those
six losses was there.
Those opportunities aren't
around in 1983. Even with more
than a little bit of luck, Stanford
would still be 0-6. And with the
Pacific-10 Conference achieving
some sort of parity, there are no
"gimmes" on the Cardinal's
schedule. An 0-11 season may not
be out of the question.
But so what? Though no one
wants to admit it, the w's and Is
aren't of consequence in collegiate
athletics. Or at least in principle
they're not. Winning is nice, but
it's not necessary.
In professional athletics, a win
here or a loss there can make or
break a career, jobs are on the line.
In college, a good football team
has its advantages. It puts people in
Stanford Stadium at 10 plus dollars
a seat. It puts checks from wealthy
alumni in the mail. It also puts
"character" into the players.
But a bad football team is not the
end of the world. A football player
doesn't learn more in the class
room if his team beats USC.
A sports enthusiast's greatest
fear is to see his passion trivialized,
to see all the last second field goals
and upset victories take a back seat
to geometry and geology.
But as hard as it is to recognize
that winning isn't everything in col
legiate sports, it is a truth that can't
be denied.
Or forgotten.


Soccer streak
Senior Carey Gazis dribbles the ball past a Chico state
defender in yesterday's soccer game here. The Card overtook
Chico State 3-2. The Stanford win followed another women's
soccer success — last Saturday Stanford beat UC-Davis by a
score of 2-1. The women's soccer team plays a rigorous var
sity schedule this season. The team meets St. Mary's here on
Thursday at 3:00 p.m.
