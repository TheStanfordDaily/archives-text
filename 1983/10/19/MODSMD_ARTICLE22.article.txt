# Walk-on success here depends on sport and talent
## 
### MARY CATHERINE FISH 
At first glance, the ranks of
varsity sports here appear
filled with athletes on scholar
ship who were actively
recruited in high school.
Every team, though, has its
share of walk-ons, or non
scholarship athletes who
make the team by trying out.
Occasionally a walk-on will
gain the limelight, such as
Andy Fischer who started for
the basketball team as a fresh
man last year. There are many
other walk-ons among the
varsity athletes who are con
tributing significantly to their
respective teams.
For a variety of reasons,
walk-ons are motivated
enough to muster up the
courage and determination to
try out for a team on their
own. Those who make it are
as devoted to their sports as
other athletes who are
recruited and are on scholar
ship.
"Baseball is my life," said
Seth Bland, a pitcher. He
names it as his first priority,
asserting,"l wouldn't be out
there if it wasn't."
Bland unsuccessfully tried
to walk on at the beginning of
his freshman year, two years
ago. After keeping himself on
a rigorous workout program
throughout the school year,
he tried again in spring and
became a member of the
team.
"I feel that now is the time
when I have to realize all of
my potential. I have to go for
it. If I don't, I'll never know,"
said Bland.
The procedure for attempt
ing to walk on is similar for all
varsity sports. An athlete talks
to coaches in hopes of being
able to work out with the

team. Then there is usually a
tryout period when available
spots are allocated. There may
or may not be a fixed number
of openings.
One sport where opportu
nities for walk-ons is espe
cially limited is tennis. Often
there are no open spots. This
is due in part to practical
limitations. There are a fixed
number of courts. Also the in
dividual nature of the sport
and structure of tournaments
make the team necessarily
small.
lohn DeVincenzo, now a
senior, holds the accomplish
ment of having played on the
tennis team for two years after
walking on as a sophomore.
This was the year following an
NCAA championship for Stan
ford, on which DeVincenzo
called "a rebuilding year".
According to him, two
former members turned pro
fessional, two graduated and
one couldn't make it back.
Thus the situation was unus
ual in terms of opportunities
for walk-ons. That year there
were four. They went through
the process of first playing in
an open ladder in order to get
into the tournament tennis
class which serves as a tryout
mechanism for the team.
Although DeVincenzo was a
top player in his high school
for three years, he was not
actively recruited by Stanford.
"I was from one of those
areas that didn't have a large
junior tennis program, being
on the boundary of the areas
defined as Northern and
Southern California.
"If you're not in an area
known for good tennis
players, you're at a disadvan
tage," he said, referring to
recruiting practices that are
largely based on Junior Ten-

nis Association national
rankings. He also noted that
tennis players start
young."They are developed
to the point where if you've
started after junior high you
pretty much don't have a
chance."
DeVincenzo said the fact
that "recruiters must keep
their reputation as letting
people play " can make it
tough for walk-ons. He
stressed, though, "Once
you're on the team there's
open policy about where
you're ranked."
Soccer is a sport with a
more flexible structure.
Charlie Crane, a senior start
ing at left fullback who
walked on in his sophomore
year said, "It's probably the
easiest to walk on because it
can be a judgment call as far
as talent."
As prospective walk-ons
play with the team, the
coaches often ask team mem
bers if they spot any talent.
Another reason for keeping
the team relatively large is to
make sure there are enough
players to constitute two
teams at practice.
Crane played soccer in high
school as well as competing in
cross-country, swimming,
water polo and tennis.
Among his accomplishments
are winning the Stanford
Challenge twice and placing
eighth a year ago in the
Escape from Alcatraz triat
halon. So why did he choose
to go out for the soccer team
in particular?
"I watched the team play
and thought I had a chance to
make it,"he said. "Also I en
joy it, especially being part of
a team. It's a lot of fun."
The desire to part of the

team is one that is behind the
efforts of some walk-ons.
Mary Patterson tried to walk
on the women's basketball
team as a sophomore last
year. "I never really expected
to make the team. I sort of just
went for the work-out and the
quality basketball. I love the
game. The girls are fun," she
said.
So although she didn't
make the team, Patterson felt
being involved with it for a
while was very valuable. She
was one of five girls that
remained in tryouts for one
spot after three weeks of
playing with the team. After a
final day of drills, the spot
went to a woman who had
previously been on the team
but didn't technically have a
spot because her scholarship
had run out.
There are ten walk-ons on
the football team this year,
one of whom is Cornelius
Williams. Even though he
didn't start on his high school
team, he was determined to
be a part of Stanford football.
"I decided I wanted to play
college football a long time
ago,"he said. "Whatever col
lege I went to I would walk
on."
Williams hasn't played in a
game yet, but it is a goal for
which he strives. "I think I can
if I try hard enough, but that's
still up to the coaches."
How can someone put in
time and effort to training,
games, and trips if he doesn't
even get to play? "It's jus
tifiable,"said Williams,"l like
to know what's going on,
what's actually happening."
Even after breaking his nose
in practice last week he says
without hesitation, "It's
worth it."

others are not so lucky.

a team. It's a lot of fun."
The desire to part of the

team is one that is behind the
efforts of some walk-ons.
Mary Patterson tried to walk
on the women's basketball
team as a sophomore last
year. "I never really expected
to make the team. I sort of just
went for the work-out and the
quality basketball. I love the
game. The girls are fun," she
said.
So although she didn't
make the team, Patterson felt
being involved with it for a
while was very valuable. She
was one of five girls that
remained in tryouts for one
spot after three weeks of
playing with the team. After a
final day of drills, the spot
went to a woman who had
previously been on the team
but didn't technically have a
spot because her scholarship
had run out.
There are ten walk-ons on
the football team this year,
one of whom is Cornelius
Williams. Even though he
didn't start on his high school
team, he was determined to
be a part of Stanford football.
"I decided I wanted to play
college football a long time
ago,"he said. "Whatever col
lege I went to I would walk
on."
Williams hasn't played in a
game yet, but it is a goal for
which he strives. "I think I can
if I try hard enough, but that's
still up to the coaches."
How can someone put in
time and effort to training,
games, and trips if he doesn't
even get to play? "It's jus
tifiable,"said Williams,"l like
to know what's going on,
what's actually happening."
Even after breaking his nose
in practice last week he says
without hesitation, "It's
worth it."

Senior No. 3 Charlie Crane walked-on the Cardinal men's soccer team during his sophomore
year, and now he is a starting defender. Some walk-ons meet Crane's kind of success, but
others are not so lucky.
At first glance, the ranks of
varsity sports here appear
filled with athletes on scholar
ship who were actively
recruited in high school.
Every team, though, has its
share of walk-ons, or non
scholarship athletes who
make the team by trying out.
Occasionally a walk-on will
gain the limelight, such as
Andy Fischer who started for
the basketball team as a fresh
man last year. There are many
other walk-ons among the
varsity athletes who are con
tributing significantly to their
respective teams.
For a variety of reasons,
walk-ons are motivated
enough to muster up the
courage and determination to
try out for a team on their
own. Those who make it are
as devoted to their sports as
other athletes who are
recruited and are on scholar
ship.
"Baseball is my life," said
Seth Bland, a pitcher. He
names it as his first priority,
asserting,"l wouldn't be out
there if it wasn't."
Bland unsuccessfully tried
to walk on at the beginning of
his freshman year, two years
ago. After keeping himself on
a rigorous workout program
throughout the school year,
he tried again in spring and
became a member of the
team.
"I feel that now is the time
when I have to realize all of
my potential. I have to go for
it. If I don't, I'll never know,"
said Bland.
The procedure for attempt
ing to walk on is similar for all
varsity sports. An athlete talks
to coaches in hopes of being
able to work out with the

team. Then there is usually a
tryout period when available
spots are allocated. There may
or may not be a fixed number
of openings.
One sport where opportu
nities for walk-ons is espe
cially limited is tennis. Often
there are no open spots. This
is due in part to practical
limitations. There are a fixed
number of courts. Also the in
dividual nature of the sport
and structure of tournaments
make the team necessarily
small.
lohn DeVincenzo, now a
senior, holds the accomplish
ment of having played on the
tennis team for two years after
walking on as a sophomore.
This was the year following an
NCAA championship for Stan
ford, on which DeVincenzo
called "a rebuilding year".
According to him, two
former members turned pro
fessional, two graduated and
one couldn't make it back.
Thus the situation was unus
ual in terms of opportunities
for walk-ons. That year there
were four. They went through
the process of first playing in
an open ladder in order to get
into the tournament tennis
class which serves as a tryout
mechanism for the team.
Although DeVincenzo was a
top player in his high school
for three years, he was not
actively recruited by Stanford.
"I was from one of those
areas that didn't have a large
junior tennis program, being
on the boundary of the areas
defined as Northern and
Southern California.
"If you're not in an area
known for good tennis
players, you're at a disadvan
tage," he said, referring to
recruiting practices that are
largely based on Junior Ten-

nis Association national
rankings. He also noted that
tennis players start
young."They are developed
to the point where if you've
started after junior high you
pretty much don't have a
chance."
DeVincenzo said the fact
that "recruiters must keep
their reputation as letting
people play " can make it
tough for walk-ons. He
stressed, though, "Once
you're on the team there's
open policy about where
you're ranked."
Soccer is a sport with a
more flexible structure.
Charlie Crane, a senior start
ing at left fullback who
walked on in his sophomore
year said, "It's probably the
easiest to walk on because it
can be a judgment call as far
as talent."
As prospective walk-ons
play with the team, the
coaches often ask team mem
bers if they spot any talent.
Another reason for keeping
the team relatively large is to
make sure there are enough
players to constitute two
teams at practice.
Crane played soccer in high
school as well as competing in
cross-country, swimming,
water polo and tennis.
Among his accomplishments
are winning the Stanford
Challenge twice and placing
eighth a year ago in the
Escape from Alcatraz triat
halon. So why did he choose
to go out for the soccer team
in particular?
"I watched the team play
and thought I had a chance to
make it,"he said. "Also I en
joy it, especially being part of
a team. It's a lot of fun."
