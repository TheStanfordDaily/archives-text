and his twin
Mother Tom have been
Maying soccer together
Bice they were eight years
■d, and they have contin-
Hhl this tradition on the
Brm. Todd is a striker for
Re men's soccer team
ere, and Tom is a
efender.
Todd said having his
vin brother on soccer
?ams with him throughout
is career has been benefi
ial. "It's been very helpful
o have Tom around," he
aid. "When we were
lounger it was a good to
enow that there was always
ane other player on the
f ield who was supporting
me — and there was always
someone I could count on
to get the ball up front."
Rafalovich and his brot
her have not had problems
with sibling rivalry because
of their common interest
in soccer. In fact, they say
it has brought them closer
together.
"We have never really
been in competition with
each other because we
played different posi
tions," he said. The twins
now live together in an
eight-man suite with little
conflict."Some people
think that it's important to
break away from your twin,
but we get along well."
Rafalovich said his par
ents have been supportive
of the twins' soccer
playing, and they have
never put any pressure on
the boys. "My parents are
behind us in everything we
do — especially soccer. They
have always come to our
games." Rafalovich's par
ents continue to support
their sons by coming to
Stanford from nearby
Saratoga to watch games.
The Rafalovich twins
have confused many soc

cer fans. "Our parents
once overheard a spectator
say 'God, that guy is all
over the field!' What they
were really seeing was Tom
playing fullback and me
playing forward. They saw
the same uniform, but the
didn't notice the different
numbers on our shirts. It
was pretty funny," he said.
Another benefit of
playing the same sport as
his twin brother is in

creased recognition.
Rafalovich said that he
feels it is helpful to be
known as one as one of the
"Rafalovich twins."
"There is nothing wrong
with recognition," he said.
"I think that getting atten
tion is better than being
unknown."
As a star player on the
soccer team at Saratoga
High School, Rafalovich
had no trouble with being

recognized. Rafalovich and
brother Tom totaled 45
goals at Saratoga during
their senior years, and
each made the U.S. Under
-19 National team and was a
high school Ail-American.
But being the focal point
of his high school team
made the transition to
Stanford soccer harder for
Rafalovich. "Last year I had
a little trouble fitting in
with the team. It was hard

to get used to college level
soccer where all the
players are good. It's so
different from high school
where you find a lot of
weaker players."
'This year my goal is to
feel more like a part of the
team, and not just an on
coming person." The
sophomore said that last
year he had difficulties ad
justing to playing with a
group of soccer players
who were used to playing
with each other. "I don't
think I got the ball that
much because the other
players weren't used to
me."
The striker feels that he
did not get the ball as
much as he should have
last season, but his
phenomonal freshman
record does not indicate
this. He finished with nine
goals and seven assists for
25 points, and was second
best on the team behind
Jorge Titinger. His playing
last year prompted coach
Nelson Lodge to say that
Rafalovich "always gives
100 percent."
Rafalovich remembers
the UCLA game last year as
his favorite of the season.
"I scored two goals, and
they were both important
ones," he said. "It was a
good game for me even
though we lost 3-2."
Despite his sensational
record, Rafalovich does
see room for improve
ment. He said that he
wants to work on scoring
this season, and "just
score more goals."
As for his hopes for the
Cardinal soccer team this
year, Rafalovich would like
to see it get to the
Regionals. "We have a
good team this year — it is
better than the last couple
of years. We started out
this season well. We won
the first four games, but
then slacked off," he said.

-19 National team and was a
high school Ail-American.
But being the focal point
of his high school team
made the transition to
Stanford soccer harder for
Rafalovich. "Last year I had
a little trouble fitting in
with the team. It was hard

to get used to college level
soccer where all the
players are good. It's so
different from high school
where you find a lot of
weaker players."
'This year my goal is to
feel more like a part of the
team, and not just an on
coming person." The
sophomore said that last
year he had difficulties ad
justing to playing with a
group of soccer players
who were used to playing
with each other. "I don't
think I got the ball that
much because the other
players weren't used to
me."
The striker feels that he
did not get the ball as
much as he should have
last season, but his
phenomonal freshman
record does not indicate
this. He finished with nine
goals and seven assists for
25 points, and was second
best on the team behind
Jorge Titinger. His playing
last year prompted coach
Nelson Lodge to say that
Rafalovich "always gives
100 percent."
Rafalovich remembers
the UCLA game last year as
his favorite of the season.
"I scored two goals, and
they were both important
ones," he said. "It was a
good game for me even
though we lost 3-2."
Despite his sensational
record, Rafalovich does
see room for improve
ment. He said that he
wants to work on scoring
this season, and "just
score more goals."
As for his hopes for the
Cardinal soccer team this
year, Rafalovich would like
to see it get to the
Regionals. "We have a
good team this year — it is
better than the last couple
of years. We started out
this season well. We won
the first four games, but
then slacked off," he said.

B'laying soccer runs in
Todd Rafalovich's family.
and his twin
Mother Tom have been
Maying soccer together
Bice they were eight years
■d, and they have contin-
Hhl this tradition on the
Brm. Todd is a striker for
Re men's soccer team
ere, and Tom is a
efender.
Todd said having his
vin brother on soccer
?ams with him throughout
is career has been benefi
ial. "It's been very helpful
o have Tom around," he
aid. "When we were
lounger it was a good to
enow that there was always
ane other player on the
f ield who was supporting
me — and there was always
someone I could count on
to get the ball up front."
Rafalovich and his brot
her have not had problems
with sibling rivalry because
of their common interest
in soccer. In fact, they say
it has brought them closer
together.
"We have never really
been in competition with
each other because we
played different posi
tions," he said. The twins
now live together in an
eight-man suite with little
conflict."Some people
think that it's important to
break away from your twin,
but we get along well."
Rafalovich said his par
ents have been supportive
of the twins' soccer
playing, and they have
never put any pressure on
the boys. "My parents are
behind us in everything we
do — especially soccer. They
have always come to our
games." Rafalovich's par
ents continue to support
their sons by coming to
Stanford from nearby
Saratoga to watch games.
The Rafalovich twins
have confused many soc

cer fans. "Our parents
once overheard a spectator
say 'God, that guy is all
over the field!' What they
were really seeing was Tom
playing fullback and me
playing forward. They saw
the same uniform, but the
didn't notice the different
numbers on our shirts. It
was pretty funny," he said.
Another benefit of
playing the same sport as
his twin brother is in

creased recognition.
Rafalovich said that he
feels it is helpful to be
known as one as one of the
"Rafalovich twins."
"There is nothing wrong
with recognition," he said.
"I think that getting atten
tion is better than being
unknown."
As a star player on the
soccer team at Saratoga
High School, Rafalovich
had no trouble with being

recognized. Rafalovich and
brother Tom totaled 45
goals at Saratoga during
their senior years, and
each made the U.S. Under
-19 National team and was a
high school Ail-American.
But being the focal point
of his high school team
made the transition to
Stanford soccer harder for
Rafalovich. "Last year I had
