# Escort service expands
## 
### LARRY GREEN 
The Stanford United for Rape
Elimination (SURE) Escort Service is
expanding this year to provide
shuttle service on weekends and
additional hours on weekday nights
in response to increased demand
for the service.
"We have been deluged with a
lot of calls. Most are from women,"
said SURE Director Derek Passarelli.
"There is a greater need for our ser
vice now."
"We had a lot of calls coming
from the Meyer Library-Tresidder
Union area. A lot of people were
requesting escorts after late night
study sessions," Passarelli said.
Passarelli said a larger student fee
assessment from the ASSU helped
pay for the expansion.
"We have to pay more escorts
and drivers," Passarelli said, "but
this year we are getting a larger fee
assessment from the ASSU which
translates to about a dollar extra per
student over last year." SURE also
receives funds from the Dean of
Student Affairs Office and the Stan
ford Police Department.
"We're excited about the shuttle
service and the weekend service
and we want people to use it," Pas
sarelli said.
With the expanded service, dis
patchers will be on call from 8 p.m.
to midnight. Once they receive a
call at SURE headquarters located in
Toyon Hall they promptly send out
an escort to assist the client.
"Usually we dispatch a golf cart,"
Passarelli said, "but we also have
people available on bicycles who
will ride alongside the client."
There is also an hourly shuttle

which originates from points near
Meyer Library and Tresidder Union.
Despite its success, Passarelli said
he is disappointed with the overall
reputation of SURE.
"A lot of people, mostly fresh
man and transfers don't really know
what we do. I got one call from
someone asking whether or not we

were a dating service," Passarelli
said.
Passarelli said he would like to
expand SURE to provide individual
escorts every day of the week, but
he said, "We don't have the money
to handle individual calls on the
weekends, so all we can run is the
shuttle service."
