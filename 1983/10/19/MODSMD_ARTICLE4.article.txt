# Postal service discussed
## Trying to end mail hassles 
### JULIE RYAN 
University administrators are cur
rently meeting with post office per
sonnel to find ways to alleviate the
long lines at the campus station
which one clerk described as the
longest ever.
"We've simply outgrown the size
of the office," said John Fallstead, a
clerk who has worked at the Stan
ford station for four years.
The post office has made several
suggestions to University planning
officials which they hope will create
more space and less crowds in the
present facility. According to Assis
tant Director of Facilities and
Services John Albrecht, post office
officials have suggested having mail
sorted at the main post office on
East Bayshore Drive instead of in
the campus facility where it is cur
rently sorted.
A self-service postal center to be
placed in the Wilbur parking lot on
the corner of Escondido and
Campus Drives has also been pro
posed. This would be an automated
unit where users could post letters,
buy stamps, and weigh and mail
parcels. The post office also plans
to install a dollar bill changer at the
current station within a month.
"I think we're closer to a solution
now than we were when we started
as couple of years ago," said
Albrecht. "I hope we have some
changes this year."
A stream of people out the door
of the post office has become a
familar sight this year. "It's the
longest line I've seen at any post of
fice ever," said graduate student
Eric Strong. "I avoid it like a pas
sion." ... ...

According to Carol Conroy,
manager of customer services of
the Palo Alto Postal Service, the
post office currently has its maxi
mumnumberof staff.
"We already have maximum staff
ing," she said. "But we are
redesigning the front screen and
we hope to raise the number of
front windows (from four) to six by
next year."
Conroy also said that an annual
survey conducted by the Stanford
post office shows its patrons are ba
sically satisfied. Most students do,
in fact, seem happy with the quality
of service they receive after finally
reaching a window.
"I really think these people do
the best they can with the resources
they have," Emeritus History Prof.
George Knoles said, "but I wish
they had more resources."
The root of the problem seems to
be the large number of post office
boxes at Stanford in comparison
with the size of the complex. Con
roy said that the crowds at the post
office is a "seasonal tradition" in
the fall primarily because of the
number of people coming in to ob
tain boxes.
About one-fourth of the boxes
turn over each year, and most
people wait until the fall, Conroy
said. The facility was built in 1960
and since then several thousand
post office boxes have been added.
"Stanford has more boxes than
the rest of Palo Alto combined,"
Conroy said. Stanford has 6980
boxes, yet each September for the
last three years they have run short
and there is current discussion
about the addition of new boxes.
Although University and post of
fice officials have been discussing
these problems for several years,
most of the solutions are not yet
concrete. However, he added that
all post office suggestions will have
to go through the "normal Univer
sity channels" before they can be
realized.
According to Conroy, one of the
main reasons more isn't done to al
leviate the lines is that they tend to
diminish after the first few months
of school.
"If it were permanent we'd be
screaming for a new post office."

she said. "I called over this mor
ning and the average wait between
8:30 and 10:30 was 10-12 minutes,
which shows that the trend is
decreasing.
According to Conroy, Stanford is
one of the only universities to have
a post office on campus. "Most
other campuses have a central
delivery to a dormitory where uni
versity personnel must sort it. Obvi
ously, the University doesn't want
to do this since it would have to pay
the additional expense."
Another reason Conroy gave for
the larger crowds at the post office
this year is that "it is the highest
volume that the post office
nationwide has ever experienced
and there has been 30 percent more
mail to be boxed at this point in his
tory."
