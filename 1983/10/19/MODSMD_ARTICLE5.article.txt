# Dean's teaching awards announced

In choosing between a small
liberal arts college and a large
"research" university, many stu
dents wonder if it is possible that a
school that emphasizes research
will downplay undergraduate edu
cation. But according to three fac
ulty members here, this couldn't be
farther from the truth.
Malcolm Beasley, Richard Holm
and )ody Maxmim, who were
recently announced as the 1982-83
winners of the Dean's Award for
Distinguished Teaching, claim that
the teaching profession is alive and
well at Stanford — on the undergrad
uate as well as graduate level.
"Those of us who went to small
liberal arts colleges weren't
prepared to find as much concern
for teaching here," Maxmim ex
plained. "We were told time and
time again, 'this is the last time
you'll get this much attention.'" In
stead, she said she has found a
"very moving concern for under
graduate education " here.
Beasley, Holm and Maxmim are
the recipients of an award that was
established in 1975 by former Dean
Halsey Royden, now a professor of
mathematics. According to Ja
queline Bryan, assistant to the dean
of humanities and sciences, the
award was not designed so much to
encourage excellence in teaching,
but to recognize it.
"I wouldn't say a need was felt to
improve the quality of teaching at
Stanford," Bryan said. "Rather, a
need was felt to honor those teach
ers who had done distinguished or
superior work."
Richard Holm, professor of bio
logical sciences, said that contrary
to common expectations about a re
search university, Stanford empha
sizes teaching as well as research.

"Teaching and research have al
ways been so closely intertwined,
and I think these awards prove just
how much Stanford does care
about the quality of teaching here,"
Holm said.
"Stanford has a reputation as an
important research institution
rather than an important learning
institution," he said. "But I think
that is just because of a lot of bad
press."
Jody Maxmim, assistant professor
of art, explained that she believed
when she arrived here that Stanford
would be an impersonal research
academy rather than a education
oriented institution.
"Books are being written, can
cers are being cured, and still, stu
dents are getting a great education
. . . students who at Harvard would
be taught by graduate students
without any special qualifications,"
Maxmim said.
Regarding her own teaching
career, Maxmim commented that
she had learned most of what she
knew simply by observing Stanford
professors. "When I was in
graduate school, the way it worked
was that you picked a research
topic, discussed what you were
doing with professors — but you
never get a chance to teach. When I
got to Stanford I had never
lectured, never shown a slide. So I
sat and watched (Art Department
Chairman Lorenz) Eitner and (Art
History Prof. Albert) Elsen teach,
and learned from them," she said.
Holm said he felt that his own
work was not unusual in any way,
but added that he did teach courses
that were of some appeal outside of
his own department.
"For example, I teach a Plants and
Civilization course that attracts stu
