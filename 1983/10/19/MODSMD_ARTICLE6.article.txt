Senate to vote on King holiday
Washington — The Senate, in a stormy flashback to
its bitter civil rights debates of two decades ago,
yesterday emphatically defeated, 76-12, an effort by
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to sidetrack legislation
creating a national holiday in memory of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to
pass the bill today. It has already been approved by
the Democratic-controlled House, and the White
House has said President Reagan will sign it, desig
nating the third Monday in January, starting in 1986,
as the country's 10th official holiday.
Yesterday's vote came on a move by Helms to

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles TimesAVashington Post News Service

send the bill to the Judiciary Committee for
hearings and what Helms called a "comprehensive
report on King's stature as a national hero, includ
ing Helms' charge that King was influenced by com
munists.
The vote, which was even more lopsided than
Senate leaders had anticipated, followed a tense,
angry debate in which Helms repeated his charges
that King had been influenced by "elements of the
Communist Pary USA," and Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.) accussed Helms of conducting a "smear
campaign."
At one point, an angry Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) took a thick binder of FBI docu
ments on King that Helms had distributed to his
colleagues and hurled it to the floor, denouncing it
as "a packet of filth."

Helms refused FBI records
Washington — A federal judge refused yesterday to
give Sen. Jesse Helms (R.-N.C.) access to sealed FBI
records on the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and
suggested that he take his complaints back to the
Senate floor.
Helms, who is seeking the controversial docu
ments in a last-ditch effort to block legislation to
establish a national holiday in honor of the slain
civil rights leader, responded by filing an appeal
and seeking an emergency hearing before the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here.
The Senate is scheduled to cast a final vote Wed
nesday afternoon on the House-passed measure.
Yesterday morning — even as lawyers for Helms were
presenting their case in a courtroom a few blocks

away — the Senate rejected a Helms motion to yank
the bill from the floor and send it to the Judiciary
Committee.
In the courtroom, Helms' chief lawyer, Lawrence
Straw, said "it would be irresponsible" of the Sen
ate to vote on the King holiday "without having
reviewed the documents" in question.
In his ruling a few hours later, U.S. District Court
Judge John Lewis Smith showed little sympathy with
Helms' attempts to embroil the courts in the
dispute.
Smith ordered the FBI tapes and other records,
which grew out of the bureau's bugging and
wiretapping of King in the 1960s , sealed for 50
years in 1977 as the result of litigation between the
Justice Department and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC). The judge said
Helms' attempt to modify the 1977 ruling
represented a "dispute with his fellow legislators,"
and one that Helms was losing.
Artillery fire threatens peace talks
Beirut, Lebanon — Heavy artillery duels flared
around Beirut today, jeopardizing Lebanon's civil
war cease-fire and government plans to convene a
Moslem-Christian peace conference tomorrow.
Police said government troops shelled militia
strongholds in Shiite Moslem neighborhoods with
field artillery and tank cannons to stop night-long
sniping and bazooka attacks on army positions on
the city's southern outskirts.
Druse insurgents in the central Lebanese moun
tains also mounted shelling attacks throughout the
night on the Lebanese army garrison in the strategic
hilltop town of Souk el-Gharb, which overlooks the
U.S. Marine position at Beirut's international air
port, police said.
The fighting broke out yesterday evening, a few
hours after President Amin Gemayel's government
said it had selected the airport as the site for the
"national reconciliation conference" tomorrow.
Shells fell around Gemayel's presidential palace
and the neighboring Defense Ministry compound
as the clashes continued without letup this mor
ning, killing at least six civilians and wounding 27,
police said.
Snipers killed two Lebanese soldiers yesterday
and wounded an Italian member of the multina
tional force.
Global greenhouse effect foreseen
Washington — The federal government warned yes
terday that a dramatic warming of the earth's
climate because of the so-called "greenhouse ef
fect" could begin in the 1990s, with potentially
serious consequences for global food production,
changes in rainfall and water availability and a prob

ably rise in coastal waters.
An Environmental Protection Agency report said
that levels of carbon dioxide in the air created by
the burning of fossil fuels could result in an in
crease of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of
the next century and a 9-degree rise by 2100,
representing "an unprecedented rate of atmo
spheric warming."
"It's going to have a very profound impact on the
way we live," said John Topping, staff director for
the agency's office of air, noise and radiation.
"Some of the effects will be beneficial, some will be
detrimental. But our ability to accomodate them
will depend much on our planning beforehand."
The agency called for "a sense of urgency" in
dealing with the coming changes.
The condition is known as the "greenhouse ef
fect" because carbon dioxide behaves like the glass
in a greenhouse, permitting the sun's warming rays
to reach the earth but not allowing the heat to
escape. The effect, the report said, is like that of a
"thermal blanket" around the globe.
Spy acted for 'money and thrill'
San Francisco — The lawyer for a "Silicon Valley"
engineer arrested for allegedly passing U.S. missile
secrets to Polish agents said yesterday his client was
out for "money and the thrill of it."
"It's sort of romantic to run around different air
ports and meet people," said William Dougherty, a
Southern California lawyer who has handled other
espionage cases.
"To get to Vienna and be told to go someplace,
that's a thrill," Dougherty said. "You get there and
they tell you to go someplace else, then you go to
Warsaw and they take you to a villa in the country."
Why did he want to leave the clandestine,
storybook existence — peopled by shadowy charac
ters dubbed "The Big Man" and"The Minister" —
that brought him a fortune that Justice Department
sources now put at $1 million?
"I hate to use the cliche, but he wanted to come
in out of the cold," Dougherty said by telephone
from Villa Park. "He said he wanted to work for
them (the U.S. intelligence community)."

Governor's mansion finally sold
Sacramento — The state agreed yesterday to sell its
unused 8-year-old governor's mansion to a South
ern California developer who wants Gov. George
Deukmejian to live in the residence.
General Services Director W.j. Anthony said the
state accepted a $1.5.3 million bid from Matt Franich
of Palo Verdes Estates for the house, which the state
is required to sell under a law enacted last year.
He said he would go through with the sale,
planned to put in such improvements as a swim
ming pool and tennis courts and hoped to work out
an arrangement under which Deukmejian and
future governors could live in the 24-room,
Spanish-style residence.
A spokesman for Deukmejian, Kevin Brett, said
neither the governor nor his aides had talked to
Franich. If Franich contacts the governor's office,
Brett added, "We would be interested and would
review the proposal." Franich said he would wait
for the governor or his aides to contact him.
The state's original, Victorian-era governor's
mansion, located a few blocks from the Capitol, has
not been used by a governor since Reagan moved
out of it in 1967.
New Israeli minister approved
Jerusalem — The Israeli Parliament yesterday ap
proved Yigal Cohen-Orgad, a political hawk and
promoter of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as
the country's new finance minister by a vote of 60-
48.
Cohen-Orgad replaces Yoram Aridor, who
resigned Thursday in the midst of one of the worst
economic crises the Jewish state has known. The
annual inflation rate is 131 percent and foreign debt
totals $21.5 billion.
Cohen-Orgad's appointment means the top posts
in Israel will be held by right-wingers who opposed
the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli treaty — Cohen-Orgad,
Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, who also holds the Foreign Mini
stry portfolio.

Sniping at Beirut airport
Beirut, Lebanon — Heavy sniping broke out yester
day along the highway linking Beirut with its
international airport, prompting police to escort
travelers in convoys over safer alternate roads.
A police statement warned outgoing passengers
to consult with police headquarters about arrang
ing safe transit from the city to the airport, the base
for 1600 U.S. Marines serving in the multinational
peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
The sniping was reported as President Amin
Gemayel prepared to announce a site for a
"national reconciliation conference" tomorrow
aimed at working out a new power-sharing formula
to promote peace between Christian and Moslem
factions.
Police did not identify the snipers involved in the
latest violation of Lebanon's 23-day-old civil war
ceasefire. But the state radio and U.S. officials here
referred to "infiltrating elements" who attacked
Marine and Lebanese army positions in the past few
days in an attempt to undermine the truce and
sabotage the reconciliation conference.
Stock prices tumble
New York — Stock prices skidded into a broad
retreat yesterday after a dismal earnings report from
one of its largest computer issues led to a
widespread selloff in technology stocks.
Auto, airline, financial and drug stocks also
slumped as losers closed with a 3-1 lead over
gainers on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off only
5.79 points with two trading hours left, finished
with a 17.89-point loss at 1250.81, thereby erasing its
9.05-point gain over the previous three sessions.
Today's weather
Sunny after morning low clouds and fog. Highs
from the mid 60s to the low 80s. Afternoon winds 10
to 20 mph.

The vote, which was even more lopsided than
Senate leaders had anticipated, followed a tense,
angry debate in which Helms repeated his charges
that King had been influenced by "elements of the
Communist Pary USA," and Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.) accussed Helms of conducting a "smear
campaign."
At one point, an angry Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) took a thick binder of FBI docu
ments on King that Helms had distributed to his
colleagues and hurled it to the floor, denouncing it
as "a packet of filth."

Helms refused FBI records
Washington — A federal judge refused yesterday to
give Sen. Jesse Helms (R.-N.C.) access to sealed FBI
records on the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and
suggested that he take his complaints back to the
Senate floor.
Helms, who is seeking the controversial docu
ments in a last-ditch effort to block legislation to
establish a national holiday in honor of the slain
civil rights leader, responded by filing an appeal
and seeking an emergency hearing before the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here.
The Senate is scheduled to cast a final vote Wed
nesday afternoon on the House-passed measure.
Yesterday morning — even as lawyers for Helms were
presenting their case in a courtroom a few blocks

away — the Senate rejected a Helms motion to yank
the bill from the floor and send it to the Judiciary
Committee.
In the courtroom, Helms' chief lawyer, Lawrence
Straw, said "it would be irresponsible" of the Sen
ate to vote on the King holiday "without having
reviewed the documents" in question.
In his ruling a few hours later, U.S. District Court
Judge John Lewis Smith showed little sympathy with
Helms' attempts to embroil the courts in the
dispute.
Smith ordered the FBI tapes and other records,
which grew out of the bureau's bugging and
wiretapping of King in the 1960s , sealed for 50
years in 1977 as the result of litigation between the
Justice Department and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC). The judge said
Helms' attempt to modify the 1977 ruling
represented a "dispute with his fellow legislators,"
and one that Helms was losing.
Artillery fire threatens peace talks
Beirut, Lebanon — Heavy artillery duels flared
around Beirut today, jeopardizing Lebanon's civil
war cease-fire and government plans to convene a
Moslem-Christian peace conference tomorrow.
Police said government troops shelled militia
strongholds in Shiite Moslem neighborhoods with
field artillery and tank cannons to stop night-long
sniping and bazooka attacks on army positions on
the city's southern outskirts.
Druse insurgents in the central Lebanese moun
tains also mounted shelling attacks throughout the
night on the Lebanese army garrison in the strategic
hilltop town of Souk el-Gharb, which overlooks the
U.S. Marine position at Beirut's international air
port, police said.
The fighting broke out yesterday evening, a few
hours after President Amin Gemayel's government
said it had selected the airport as the site for the
"national reconciliation conference" tomorrow.
Shells fell around Gemayel's presidential palace
and the neighboring Defense Ministry compound
as the clashes continued without letup this mor
ning, killing at least six civilians and wounding 27,
police said.
Snipers killed two Lebanese soldiers yesterday
and wounded an Italian member of the multina
tional force.
Global greenhouse effect foreseen
Washington — The federal government warned yes
terday that a dramatic warming of the earth's
climate because of the so-called "greenhouse ef
fect" could begin in the 1990s, with potentially
serious consequences for global food production,
changes in rainfall and water availability and a prob

ably rise in coastal waters.
An Environmental Protection Agency report said
that levels of carbon dioxide in the air created by
the burning of fossil fuels could result in an in
crease of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of
the next century and a 9-degree rise by 2100,
representing "an unprecedented rate of atmo
spheric warming."
"It's going to have a very profound impact on the
way we live," said John Topping, staff director for
the agency's office of air, noise and radiation.
"Some of the effects will be beneficial, some will be
detrimental. But our ability to accomodate them
will depend much on our planning beforehand."
The agency called for "a sense of urgency" in
dealing with the coming changes.
The condition is known as the "greenhouse ef
fect" because carbon dioxide behaves like the glass
in a greenhouse, permitting the sun's warming rays
to reach the earth but not allowing the heat to
escape. The effect, the report said, is like that of a
"thermal blanket" around the globe.
Spy acted for 'money and thrill'
San Francisco — The lawyer for a "Silicon Valley"
engineer arrested for allegedly passing U.S. missile
secrets to Polish agents said yesterday his client was
out for "money and the thrill of it."
"It's sort of romantic to run around different air
ports and meet people," said William Dougherty, a
Southern California lawyer who has handled other
espionage cases.
"To get to Vienna and be told to go someplace,
that's a thrill," Dougherty said. "You get there and
they tell you to go someplace else, then you go to
Warsaw and they take you to a villa in the country."
Why did he want to leave the clandestine,
storybook existence — peopled by shadowy charac
ters dubbed "The Big Man" and"The Minister" —
that brought him a fortune that Justice Department
sources now put at $1 million?
"I hate to use the cliche, but he wanted to come
in out of the cold," Dougherty said by telephone
from Villa Park. "He said he wanted to work for
them (the U.S. intelligence community)."

Governor's mansion finally sold
Sacramento — The state agreed yesterday to sell its
unused 8-year-old governor's mansion to a South
ern California developer who wants Gov. George
Deukmejian to live in the residence.
General Services Director W.j. Anthony said the
state accepted a $1.5.3 million bid from Matt Franich
of Palo Verdes Estates for the house, which the state
is required to sell under a law enacted last year.
He said he would go through with the sale,
planned to put in such improvements as a swim
ming pool and tennis courts and hoped to work out
an arrangement under which Deukmejian and
future governors could live in the 24-room,
Spanish-style residence.
A spokesman for Deukmejian, Kevin Brett, said
neither the governor nor his aides had talked to
Franich. If Franich contacts the governor's office,
Brett added, "We would be interested and would
review the proposal." Franich said he would wait
for the governor or his aides to contact him.
The state's original, Victorian-era governor's
mansion, located a few blocks from the Capitol, has
not been used by a governor since Reagan moved
out of it in 1967.
New Israeli minister approved
Jerusalem — The Israeli Parliament yesterday ap
proved Yigal Cohen-Orgad, a political hawk and
promoter of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as
the country's new finance minister by a vote of 60-
48.
Cohen-Orgad replaces Yoram Aridor, who
resigned Thursday in the midst of one of the worst
economic crises the Jewish state has known. The
annual inflation rate is 131 percent and foreign debt
totals $21.5 billion.
Cohen-Orgad's appointment means the top posts
in Israel will be held by right-wingers who opposed
the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli treaty — Cohen-Orgad,
Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, who also holds the Foreign Mini
stry portfolio.

Sniping at Beirut airport
Beirut, Lebanon — Heavy sniping broke out yester
day along the highway linking Beirut with its
international airport, prompting police to escort
travelers in convoys over safer alternate roads.
A police statement warned outgoing passengers
to consult with police headquarters about arrang
ing safe transit from the city to the airport, the base
for 1600 U.S. Marines serving in the multinational
peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
The sniping was reported as President Amin
Gemayel prepared to announce a site for a
"national reconciliation conference" tomorrow
aimed at working out a new power-sharing formula
to promote peace between Christian and Moslem
factions.
Police did not identify the snipers involved in the
latest violation of Lebanon's 23-day-old civil war
ceasefire. But the state radio and U.S. officials here
referred to "infiltrating elements" who attacked
Marine and Lebanese army positions in the past few
days in an attempt to undermine the truce and
sabotage the reconciliation conference.
Stock prices tumble
New York — Stock prices skidded into a broad
retreat yesterday after a dismal earnings report from
one of its largest computer issues led to a
widespread selloff in technology stocks.
Auto, airline, financial and drug stocks also
slumped as losers closed with a 3-1 lead over
gainers on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off only
5.79 points with two trading hours left, finished
with a 17.89-point loss at 1250.81, thereby erasing its
9.05-point gain over the previous three sessions.
Today's weather
Sunny after morning low clouds and fog. Highs
from the mid 60s to the low 80s. Afternoon winds 10

Senate to vote on King holiday
Washington — The Senate, in a stormy flashback to
its bitter civil rights debates of two decades ago,
yesterday emphatically defeated, 76-12, an effort by
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to sidetrack legislation
creating a national holiday in memory of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to
pass the bill today. It has already been approved by
the Democratic-controlled House, and the White
House has said President Reagan will sign it, desig
nating the third Monday in January, starting in 1986,
as the country's 10th official holiday.
Yesterday's vote came on a move by Helms to

hearings and what Helms called a "comprehensive

civil rights leader, responded by filing an appeal
and seeking an emergency hearing before the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here.
The Senate is scheduled to cast a final vote Wed
nesday afternoon on the House-passed measure.
Yesterday morning — even as lawyers for Helms were
presenting their case in a courtroom a few blocks

away — the Senate rejected a Helms motion to yank
the bill from the floor and send it to the Judiciary
Committee.
In the courtroom, Helms' chief lawyer, Lawrence
Straw, said "it would be irresponsible" of the Sen
ate to vote on the King holiday "without having
reviewed the documents" in question.
In his ruling a few hours later, U.S. District Court
Judge John Lewis Smith showed little sympathy with
Helms' attempts to embroil the courts in the
dispute.
Smith ordered the FBI tapes and other records,
which grew out of the bureau's bugging and
wiretapping of King in the 1960s , sealed for 50
years in 1977 as the result of litigation between the
Justice Department and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC). The judge said
Helms' attempt to modify the 1977 ruling
represented a "dispute with his fellow legislators,"
and one that Helms was losing.
Artillery fire threatens peace talks
Beirut, Lebanon — Heavy artillery duels flared
around Beirut today, jeopardizing Lebanon's civil
war cease-fire and government plans to convene a
Moslem-Christian peace conference tomorrow.
Police said government troops shelled militia
strongholds in Shiite Moslem neighborhoods with
field artillery and tank cannons to stop night-long
sniping and bazooka attacks on army positions on
the city's southern outskirts.
Druse insurgents in the central Lebanese moun
tains also mounted shelling attacks throughout the
night on the Lebanese army garrison in the strategic
hilltop town of Souk el-Gharb, which overlooks the
U.S. Marine position at Beirut's international air
port, police said.
The fighting broke out yesterday evening, a few
hours after President Amin Gemayel's government
said it had selected the airport as the site for the
"national reconciliation conference" tomorrow.
Shells fell around Gemayel's presidential palace
and the neighboring Defense Ministry compound
as the clashes continued without letup this mor
ning, killing at least six civilians and wounding 27,
police said.
Snipers killed two Lebanese soldiers yesterday
and wounded an Italian member of the multina
tional force.
Global greenhouse effect foreseen
Washington — The federal government warned yes
terday that a dramatic warming of the earth's
climate because of the so-called "greenhouse ef
fect" could begin in the 1990s, with potentially
serious consequences for global food production,
changes in rainfall and water availability and a prob

ably rise in coastal waters.
An Environmental Protection Agency report said
that levels of carbon dioxide in the air created by
the burning of fossil fuels could result in an in
crease of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of
the next century and a 9-degree rise by 2100,
representing "an unprecedented rate of atmo
spheric warming."
"It's going to have a very profound impact on the
way we live," said John Topping, staff director for
the agency's office of air, noise and radiation.
"Some of the effects will be beneficial, some will be
detrimental. But our ability to accomodate them
will depend much on our planning beforehand."
The agency called for "a sense of urgency" in
dealing with the coming changes.
The condition is known as the "greenhouse ef
fect" because carbon dioxide behaves like the glass
in a greenhouse, permitting the sun's warming rays
to reach the earth but not allowing the heat to
escape. The effect, the report said, is like that of a
"thermal blanket" around the globe.
Spy acted for 'money and thrill'
San Francisco — The lawyer for a "Silicon Valley"
engineer arrested for allegedly passing U.S. missile
secrets to Polish agents said yesterday his client was
out for "money and the thrill of it."
"It's sort of romantic to run around different air
ports and meet people," said William Dougherty, a
Southern California lawyer who has handled other
espionage cases.
"To get to Vienna and be told to go someplace,
that's a thrill," Dougherty said. "You get there and
they tell you to go someplace else, then you go to
Warsaw and they take you to a villa in the country."
Why did he want to leave the clandestine,
storybook existence — peopled by shadowy charac
ters dubbed "The Big Man" and"The Minister" —
that brought him a fortune that Justice Department
sources now put at $1 million?
"I hate to use the cliche, but he wanted to come
in out of the cold," Dougherty said by telephone
from Villa Park. "He said he wanted to work for
them (the U.S. intelligence community)."

Governor's mansion finally sold
Sacramento — The state agreed yesterday to sell its
unused 8-year-old governor's mansion to a South
ern California developer who wants Gov. George
Deukmejian to live in the residence.
General Services Director W.j. Anthony said the
state accepted a $1.5.3 million bid from Matt Franich
of Palo Verdes Estates for the house, which the state
is required to sell under a law enacted last year.
He said he would go through with the sale,
planned to put in such improvements as a swim
ming pool and tennis courts and hoped to work out
an arrangement under which Deukmejian and
future governors could live in the 24-room,
Spanish-style residence.
A spokesman for Deukmejian, Kevin Brett, said
neither the governor nor his aides had talked to
Franich. If Franich contacts the governor's office,
Brett added, "We would be interested and would
review the proposal." Franich said he would wait
for the governor or his aides to contact him.
The state's original, Victorian-era governor's
mansion, located a few blocks from the Capitol, has
not been used by a governor since Reagan moved
out of it in 1967.
New Israeli minister approved
Jerusalem — The Israeli Parliament yesterday ap
proved Yigal Cohen-Orgad, a political hawk and
promoter of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as
the country's new finance minister by a vote of 60-
48.
Cohen-Orgad replaces Yoram Aridor, who
resigned Thursday in the midst of one of the worst
economic crises the Jewish state has known. The
annual inflation rate is 131 percent and foreign debt
totals $21.5 billion.
Cohen-Orgad's appointment means the top posts
in Israel will be held by right-wingers who opposed
the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli treaty — Cohen-Orgad,
Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, who also holds the Foreign Mini
stry portfolio.

Sniping at Beirut airport
Beirut, Lebanon — Heavy sniping broke out yester
day along the highway linking Beirut with its
international airport, prompting police to escort
travelers in convoys over safer alternate roads.
A police statement warned outgoing passengers
to consult with police headquarters about arrang
ing safe transit from the city to the airport, the base
for 1600 U.S. Marines serving in the multinational
peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
The sniping was reported as President Amin
Gemayel prepared to announce a site for a
"national reconciliation conference" tomorrow
aimed at working out a new power-sharing formula
to promote peace between Christian and Moslem
factions.
Police did not identify the snipers involved in the
latest violation of Lebanon's 23-day-old civil war
ceasefire. But the state radio and U.S. officials here
referred to "infiltrating elements" who attacked
Marine and Lebanese army positions in the past few
days in an attempt to undermine the truce and
sabotage the reconciliation conference.
Stock prices tumble
New York — Stock prices skidded into a broad
retreat yesterday after a dismal earnings report from
one of its largest computer issues led to a
widespread selloff in technology stocks.
Auto, airline, financial and drug stocks also
slumped as losers closed with a 3-1 lead over
gainers on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off only
5.79 points with two trading hours left, finished
with a 17.89-point loss at 1250.81, thereby erasing its
9.05-point gain over the previous three sessions.
Today's weather
Sunny after morning low clouds and fog. Highs
from the mid 60s to the low 80s. Afternoon winds 10
to 20 mph.
Senate to vote on King holiday
Washington — The Senate, in a stormy flashback to
its bitter civil rights debates of two decades ago,
yesterday emphatically defeated, 76-12, an effort by
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to sidetrack legislation
creating a national holiday in memory of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to
pass the bill today. It has already been approved by
the Democratic-controlled House, and the White
House has said President Reagan will sign it, desig
nating the third Monday in January, starting in 1986,
as the country's 10th official holiday.
Yesterday's vote came on a move by Helms to

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles TimesAVashington Post News Service

send the bill to the Judiciary Committee for
hearings and what Helms called a "comprehensive
report on King's stature as a national hero, includ
ing Helms' charge that King was influenced by com
munists.
The vote, which was even more lopsided than
Senate leaders had anticipated, followed a tense,
angry debate in which Helms repeated his charges
that King had been influenced by "elements of the
Communist Pary USA," and Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.) accussed Helms of conducting a "smear
campaign."
At one point, an angry Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) took a thick binder of FBI docu
ments on King that Helms had distributed to his
colleagues and hurled it to the floor, denouncing it
as "a packet of filth."

Helms refused FBI records
Washington — A federal judge refused yesterday to
give Sen. Jesse Helms (R.-N.C.) access to sealed FBI
records on the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and
suggested that he take his complaints back to the
Senate floor.
Helms, who is seeking the controversial docu
ments in a last-ditch effort to block legislation to
establish a national holiday in honor of the slain
civil rights leader, responded by filing an appeal
and seeking an emergency hearing before the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here.
The Senate is scheduled to cast a final vote Wed
