Senate to vote on King holiday
Washington — The Senate, in a stormy flashback to
its bitter civil rights debates of two decades ago,
yesterday emphatically defeated, 76-12, an effort by
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to sidetrack legislation
creating a national holiday in memory of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to
pass the bill today. It has already been approved by
the Democratic-controlled House, and the White
House has said President Reagan will sign it, desig
nating the third Monday in January, starting in 1986,
as the country's 10th official holiday.
Yesterday's vote came on a move by Helms to

send the bill to the Judiciary Committee for
hearings and what Helms called a "comprehensive
report on King's stature as a national hero, includ
ing Helms' charge that King was influenced by com
munists.
The vote, which was even more lopsided than
Senate leaders had anticipated, followed a tense,
angry debate in which Helms repeated his charges
that King had been influenced by "elements of the
Communist Pary USA," and Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.) accussed Helms of conducting a "smear
campaign."
At one point, an angry Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) took a thick binder of FBI docu
ments on King that Helms had distributed to his
colleagues and hurled it to the floor, denouncing it
as "a packet of filth."

Helms refused FBI records
Washington — A federal judge refused yesterday to
give Sen. Jesse Helms (R.-N.C.) access to sealed FBI
records on the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and
suggested that he take his complaints back to the
Senate floor.
Helms, who is seeking the controversial docu
ments in a last-ditch effort to block legislation to
establish a national holiday in honor of the slain
civil rights leader, responded by filing an appeal
and seeking an emergency hearing before the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here.
The Senate is scheduled to cast a final vote Wed
nesday afternoon on the House-passed measure.
Yesterday morning — even as lawyers for Helms were
presenting their case in a courtroom a few blocks

away — the Senate rejected a Helms motion to yank
the bill from the floor and send it to the Judiciary
Committee.
In the courtroom, Helms' chief lawyer, Lawrence
Straw, said "it would be irresponsible" of the Sen
ate to vote on the King holiday "without having
reviewed the documents" in question.
In his ruling a few hours later, U.S. District Court
Judge John Lewis Smith showed little sympathy with
Helms' attempts to embroil the courts in the
dispute.
Smith ordered the FBI tapes and other records,
which grew out of the bureau's bugging and
wiretapping of King in the 1960s , sealed for 50
years in 1977 as the result of litigation between the
Justice Department and the Southern Christian
