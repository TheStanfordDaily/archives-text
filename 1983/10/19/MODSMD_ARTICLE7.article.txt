## Computer boom hits home for Stanford students A
						major issue for undergrads 
### LIBBY OSBORNE 
In recent years Stanford has made its
reputation on offering high-quality,
diverse, academic opportunities. Yet, even
though it is located in the heart of Silicon
Valley, the University offers no undergrad
uate degree in computer science.
Stanford does have an interdepartmental
degree in mathematical sciences which
gives sufficient preparation to students in
terested in doing graduate work in comput
er science. Approximately one-fourth of the
mathematical sciences majors go on to
graduate school.
The major, a combination of statistics,
computer science, mathematics, and opera
tions research is one of the most pres
tigious offered here. National polls have
rated Stanford's faculty as number one in
both statistics and computer science, and
sixth in mathematics.
Nevertheless, mathematical sciences is
not the computer programming major that
many students seem to want. The terms
"computer science" and "computer pro
gramming" are often confused, said Ralph
Gorin, Director of LOTS and a lecturer for
the Computer Science Department.
"Lovers of programming who won't study
math vigorouly have no business imagining
themselves as computer scientists," Gorin
said.
Both he and Bradley Efron, program
chairman of mathematical sciences, agreed
that computer programming is not a subject
suitable for in-depth, academic study at an
institution like Stanford. Since material
taught in such classes is constantly being

revised and enlarged upon, it comes with
no guarantee of permanent relevance.
Teaching the large number of program
ming classes which would be needed if a
programming major were added would
make maintaining the present standards of
excellence impossible, said Efron. Stan
ford's first-ranked computer science faculty
is already overburdened with its present
advising, teaching and research respon
siblities.
Efron also notes that the students "come
to Stanford to learn something that will last
a lifetime." The rapidly expanding field of
computer programming is too new and un
stable to be studied with that intention.
The subject matter taught at schools
which offer a programming major is "in
great danger of becoming extinct within a
very short period of time," Efron said. This
could prove disasterous for students whose
undergraduate work might be rendered
useless.
The importance of maintaining career op
tions is essential, according to Efron. "In
these times, nobody should be trained just
in computers. It should be computers and
something," he said.
Efron acknowledges the University's con
cern for those students who don't have the
math abilities to complete the mathematical
sciences major but still want to be comput
er literate. "The problem is something
which must be dealt with," he said. A
review of the math sciences department
which takes place every five years is sched
uled for next year. This issue will consti
tute a major portion of that review.
