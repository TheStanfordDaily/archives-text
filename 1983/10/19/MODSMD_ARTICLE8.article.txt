# The
						care and feeding of a terminal hobby

### MICHAEL GOFF 
A growing number of stu
dents are bringing personal
computers as well as trunks
and bicycles to campus each
year.
Most of the systems and
combinations of systems
available would make a dent
in anyone's pocketbook. For
most students, however, the
computer hobby is heavily
supported, financially and in
other ways, by parents.
Students here have found a
seemingly endless number of
uses for their computers.The
most common uses, as one
would expect, are related to
academics. While computers
are frequently used for class
assignments, especially in en
gineering, math and comput
er science classes, students
also use them as checkbook
balancers, as address books
and for sending mail to other
computer users.
One freshman said he even
used his last year for his col
lege applications.
The largest use for com
puters here, however, is for
word processing.
The word processing capa
bility makes a computer as

useful for someone majoring
in the humanities, who is re
quired to do a lot of writing,
as for a person majoring in
math or science.
Finally, many people use
their computers to connect
their terminals with the LOTS
system. Although the campus
time-sharing system is useful,

rooms are hackers with glazed eyes and

it is often difficult to get a ter
minal because of the large
number of people using 'the
facility. Personal computers
make using LOTS a much
simpler experience. Through
the use of a modem, which
provides a phone link to
other computers, one only
has to be on LOTS for the
short amount of time that it
takes to send a program into
the main computer. Because
all of the programming and
debugging is done on the
personal terminal, little LOTS

time is used and the user does
not have to face the frustra
tion of waiting for terminals
late at night.
More people than ever are
asking about communicating
with LOTS from their
microcomputers, according
to Steve Miner, LOTS faculty
liaison. He added that the

LOTS staff is encouraging mi
crocomputer users to com
municate with each other to
overcome problems with
LOTS communication. An
electronic bulletin board has
been set up for this purpose.
Not all personal computer
owners fit the image of the in
telligent electrical engineer
ing student or the rich kid
well off enough to afford an
expensive toy. With the in
creasing number of com
puters around, computer
user stereotypes are falling

apart.
"People shouldn't come
up with the idea that all
people with computers in
their rooms are hackers with
glazed eyes and munching on
potato chips," said micro
computer owner Mike Heller.
Carnegie Mellon University
in Pennsylvania, has recently
started a plan which will even
tually result in a personal
computer for each of its 5500
students. All would be con
nected through a specially de
signed IBM system set up as a
decentralized LOTS-tvpe time
sharing system. Most student >
here feel that this is not an al
ternative for Stanford. "We
are not going in the CMU di
rection because it's too
homogenous of a solution,"
said David Gleba, student
representative to the Commit
tee on Computing and Infor
mation Technology.
He did say that the Univer
sity is working on implement
ing a total network that would
allow even student computers
to dial not only into LOTS, but
also CIT, peripherals in differ
ent departments, and even to


LOTS OF FUN: As the lines at CERAS grow longer, so does
the list of students who opt to buy their own personal com
puter systems. Students use their terminals not only to bypass

queues at CERAS and LOTS, but also to type papers, print
problem sets and list addresses.
