# Stanford professor wins Nobel Prize
## Academy lauds Taube's chemistry work 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
The Swedish Academy yesterday
awarded the Nobel Prize in
Chemistry to Prof. Henry Taube,
calling him "one of the most crea
tive contemporary workers in inor
ganic chemistry."
Taube, a chemistry professor
here since 1962, was commended
by the Nobel Committee for his
work on the mechanisms of
electron transfer reactions, particu
larly in metal complexes.
The $190,000 prize was given to
Taube, 67, for more than 30 years of
research in inorganic chemistry. A
prime experiment, conducted at
the University of Chicago in 1953,
brought new light to the study of
chemistry by showing that reactions
involving the transfer of electrons
from one particle to another is also
often accompanied by the motion
of an atom or group of atoms.
"It's an experiment I'm actually
quite proud of," Taube said at a
news conference in the Chemistry
Gazebo yesterday morning. "It gave
a new dimension to the field . . .
people began to think in concrete
terms about the (electron transfer)
systems."
Taube is one of 10 Nobel
laureates here, four of whom have
been honored for work in

chemistry. Two other U.S. scien
tists, Subrahmanyan Chandrasek
har of the University of Chicago,
and William Fowler of the Califor
nia Institute of Technology, yester
day won the Nobel Prize in Physics
for their work on the evolution of
stars.
Stanford's new Nobel laureate,
bleary-eyed and trembling with
excitement and anxiety told
reporters that a photographer
called him at 6 a.m. — just minutes
after he heard the good news from

the Academy — and asked him what
his feelings were.
"The adjectives are pleasure and
astonishment," he said. "I haven't
had the chance to refer to my
thesaurus yet to find out what other
adjectives I could be using. But I
think those two cover it pretty
well."
Asked what he will do with his
prize money, Taube quickly
responded, "Honestly I haven't
thought about it," but then added,

NOBEL LAUREATE: Chemistry professor Henry Taube speaks at a news conference after winning the Nobel
Prize for his work in inorganic chemistry.
"I'll take my family to Stockholm."
The Nobel laureate plans to at
tend the formal award ceremony in
Sweden in December.
Taube said he had "of course"
thought about winning the prize. "I
think everyone in science or in the
fields that are recognized by the
award, if they get some recognition,
think that if s a possibility."
Members of the Stanford com
munity familiar with Taube and his
work were not surprised by the
Nobel Committee's choice.
James Collman, a professor in the
Chemistry Department, referred to
Taube as a man with"no peers in his
field" and said, "We around here
have anticipated Taube winning for
some time."
Collman, who like a number of
other chemists is currently using
some of the"rules" laid down by
Taube to study metal reactions in
volving oxygen, said he recently
told a group of students, "I
couldn't think of a more powerful
candidate than Taube."
But Collman was disappointed
that the Academy asked him to
make a nomination for next year's
prize, denying him a chance to
nominate Taube. "So I was wonder
fully surprised," he said.
John Brauman, chairman of the

Chemistry Department, said, "It's
presumptuous to say you expect
anybody to do it (win the Nobel
Prize)," but added that Taube's
work "is clearly deserving of it."
Taube's award was called
"terrific" by University President
Donald Kennedy who said it is "no
less wonderful because it was a
little more anticipated."
Collman said Taube could have
won the prize "any time in the last
15 years." He added that because
the Nobel laureate has conducted
"some of the most important work
in a broad area," Taube's work
repeatedly comes to the attention
of other chemists, biologists and
scientists working in industry.
Taube started his work on
electron transfer "when no one was
interested in it," according to Col
lman, and the Nobel laureate him
self said that he "was bored" with
the subject until he was required to
teach it in a course at the University
of Chicago.
"The obligation to give formal
courses I think is an important part
and it really has affected me," he
said.
However, Taube has moved away
from the classroom in the last few
years. He has not gotten good
response from his students, he
said. "I simply have not enjoyed it."
The last year Taube taught an un
dergraduate class was 1981-82, but
he is currently leading a few
graduate seminars, according to

Brauman, who said, "He's certainly
done his share of teaching" at both
the undergraduate and graduate
levels.
Taube no longer works in his lab
oratory at the Stauffer Laboratory
for Physical Chemistry, but
graduate student Rossella Cordone,
a member of Taube's research
group, said he stops by nearly every
day and constantly contributes
ideas.
As the third, fourth and fifth
Americans to win Nobel Prizes in
science this year, Taube and the
two physicists completed the U.S.
domination of the science fields.
U.S. geneticist Barbara McClintock
won the prize in medicine and
Gerard Debreu of UC-Berkeley won
the prize in Economics.
Taube, a native of Neudorf, Sas
katchewan, became a U.S. citizen in
1941. He received master's and bac
helor's degrees from the University
of Saskatchewan, and a doctorate
from UC-Berkeley.
He worked his way to a full
professorship at the University of
Chicago from 1946-61. At Stanford,
he has had two stints — 1972-74 and
1978-79 — as chairman of the
Chemistry Department.
Taube has won numerous prizes,
including the $150,000 Robert
Welch Foundation Award and the
National Academy of Sciences
Award in Chemical Sciences, both
awarded to him earlier this year.

The Swedish Academy yesterday
awarded the Nobel Prize in
Chemistry to Prof. Henry Taube,
calling him "one of the most crea
tive contemporary workers in inor
ganic chemistry."
Taube, a chemistry professor
here since 1962, was commended
by the Nobel Committee for his
work on the mechanisms of
electron transfer reactions, particu
larly in metal complexes.
The $190,000 prize was given to
Taube, 67, for more than 30 years of
research in inorganic chemistry. A
prime experiment, conducted at
the University of Chicago in 1953,
brought new light to the study of
chemistry by showing that reactions
involving the transfer of electrons
from one particle to another is also
often accompanied by the motion
of an atom or group of atoms.
"It's an experiment I'm actually
quite proud of," Taube said at a
news conference in the Chemistry
Gazebo yesterday morning. "It gave
a new dimension to the field . . .
people began to think in concrete
terms about the (electron transfer)
systems."
Taube is one of 10 Nobel
laureates here, four of whom have
been honored for work in

chemistry. Two other U.S. scien
tists, Subrahmanyan Chandrasek
har of the University of Chicago,
and William Fowler of the Califor
nia Institute of Technology, yester
day won the Nobel Prize in Physics
for their work on the evolution of
stars.
Stanford's new Nobel laureate,
bleary-eyed and trembling with
excitement and anxiety told
reporters that a photographer
called him at 6 a.m. — just minutes
after he heard the good news from

the Academy — and asked him what
his feelings were.
"The adjectives are pleasure and
astonishment," he said. "I haven't
had the chance to refer to my
thesaurus yet to find out what other
adjectives I could be using. But I
think those two cover it pretty
well."
Asked what he will do with his
prize money, Taube quickly
responded, "Honestly I haven't
thought about it," but then added,

NOBEL LAUREATE: Chemistry professor Henry Taube speaks at a news conference after winning the Nobel
Prize for his work in inorganic chemistry.
"I'll take my family to Stockholm."
The Nobel laureate plans to at
tend the formal award ceremony in
Sweden in December.
Taube said he had "of course"
thought about winning the prize. "I
think everyone in science or in the
fields that are recognized by the
award, if they get some recognition,
think that if s a possibility."
Members of the Stanford com
munity familiar with Taube and his
work were not surprised by the
Nobel Committee's choice.
James Collman, a professor in the
Chemistry Department, referred to
Taube as a man with"no peers in his
field" and said, "We around here
have anticipated Taube winning for
some time."
Collman, who like a number of
other chemists is currently using
some of the"rules" laid down by
Taube to study metal reactions in
volving oxygen, said he recently
told a group of students, "I
couldn't think of a more powerful
candidate than Taube."
But Collman was disappointed
that the Academy asked him to
make a nomination for next year's
prize, denying him a chance to
nominate Taube. "So I was wonder
fully surprised," he said.
John Brauman, chairman of the

Chemistry Department, said, "It's
presumptuous to say you expect
anybody to do it (win the Nobel
Prize)," but added that Taube's
work "is clearly deserving of it."
Taube's award was called
"terrific" by University President
Donald Kennedy who said it is "no
less wonderful because it was a
little more anticipated."
Collman said Taube could have
won the prize "any time in the last
15 years." He added that because
the Nobel laureate has conducted
"some of the most important work
in a broad area," Taube's work
repeatedly comes to the attention
of other chemists, biologists and
scientists working in industry.
Taube started his work on
electron transfer "when no one was
interested in it," according to Col
lman, and the Nobel laureate him
self said that he "was bored" with
the subject until he was required to
teach it in a course at the University
of Chicago.
"The obligation to give formal
courses I think is an important part
and it really has affected me," he
said.
However, Taube has moved away
from the classroom in the last few
years. He has not gotten good
response from his students, he
said. "I simply have not enjoyed it."
The last year Taube taught an un
dergraduate class was 1981-82, but
he is currently leading a few
graduate seminars, according to

Brauman, who said, "He's certainly
done his share of teaching" at both
the undergraduate and graduate
levels.
Taube no longer works in his lab
oratory at the Stauffer Laboratory
for Physical Chemistry, but
graduate student Rossella Cordone,
a member of Taube's research
group, said he stops by nearly every
day and constantly contributes
ideas.
As the third, fourth and fifth
Americans to win Nobel Prizes in
science this year, Taube and the
two physicists completed the U.S.
domination of the science fields.
U.S. geneticist Barbara McClintock
won the prize in medicine and
Gerard Debreu of UC-Berkeley won
the prize in Economics.
Taube, a native of Neudorf, Sas
katchewan, became a U.S. citizen in
1941. He received master's and bac
helor's degrees from the University
of Saskatchewan, and a doctorate
from UC-Berkeley.
He worked his way to a full
professorship at the University of
Chicago from 1946-61. At Stanford,
he has had two stints — 1972-74 and
1978-79 — as chairman of the
Chemistry Department.
Taube has won numerous prizes,
including the $150,000 Robert
Welch Foundation Award and the
National Academy of Sciences
Award in Chemical Sciences, both
awarded to him earlier this year.
