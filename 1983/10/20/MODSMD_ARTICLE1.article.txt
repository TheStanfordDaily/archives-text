# Stanford professor wins Nobel Prize
## Academy lauds Taube's chemistry work 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
The Swedish Academy yesterday
awarded the Nobel Prize in
Chemistry to Prof. Henry Taube,
calling him "one of the most crea
tive contemporary workers in inor
ganic chemistry."
Taube, a chemistry professor
here since 1962, was commended
by the Nobel Committee for his
work on the mechanisms of
electron transfer reactions, particu
larly in metal complexes.
The $190,000 prize was given to
Taube, 67, for more than 30 years of
research in inorganic chemistry. A
prime experiment, conducted at
the University of Chicago in 1953,
brought new light to the study of
chemistry by showing that reactions
involving the transfer of electrons
from one particle to another is also
often accompanied by the motion
of an atom or group of atoms.
"It's an experiment I'm actually
quite proud of," Taube said at a
news conference in the Chemistry
Gazebo yesterday morning. "It gave
a new dimension to the field . . .
people began to think in concrete
terms about the (electron transfer)
systems."
Taube is one of 10 Nobel
laureates here, four of whom have
been honored for work in

chemistry. Two other U.S. scien
tists, Subrahmanyan Chandrasek
har of the University of Chicago,
and William Fowler of the Califor
nia Institute of Technology, yester
day won the Nobel Prize in Physics
for their work on the evolution of
stars.
Stanford's new Nobel laureate,
bleary-eyed and trembling with
excitement and anxiety told
reporters that a photographer
called him at 6 a.m. — just minutes
after he heard the good news from

the Academy — and asked him what
his feelings were.
"The adjectives are pleasure and
astonishment," he said. "I haven't
had the chance to refer to my
thesaurus yet to find out what other
adjectives I could be using. But I
think those two cover it pretty
well."
Asked what he will do with his
prize money, Taube quickly
responded, "Honestly I haven't
thought about it," but then added,
