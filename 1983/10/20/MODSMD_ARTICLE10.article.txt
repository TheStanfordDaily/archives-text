# Steinem at Bookstore, plugs 'Outrageous Acts'
## 
### REBECCA BUELL 
Gloria Steinem, the feminist jour
nalist and co-editor of Ms. maga
zine, drew a crowd of over 250 to
the Stanford Bookstore yesterday in
a publicity appearance for her new
book, "Outrageous Acts and
Everyday Rebellions."
In reference to the title of the
book, which is a collection of some
of the essays she has written in the
last 20 years, Steinem urged every
one in the audience to commit at
least one outrageous act within the
next 24 hours.
"You don't need an outsider to
stir up rebellion. You have all the
energy and rebellious ideas within
you now, right here," Steinem said.
The essays collected in the new
book represent a cross-section of
Steinem's writings since her first
major article, "I was a Playboy Bun
ny," a 1962 piece in which she
posed as a bunny to report on the
underworld of the New York
Playboy Club.
Steinem broke ground in jour
nalism in a time when "girl
reporters" were assigned to cover
church bazaars and cook-offs. She
gained a reputation for her exposes
of public figures and celebrities in
cluding Truman Capote, John Len
non and Patricia Nixon.
One of her more recent pieces,
"Ruth's Song (Because She Could
Not Sing It)," is an essay on
Steinem's mother and the relation
ship they shared. "In many ways
our roles were reversed: I was the
mother and she was the child," she
writes.
Steinem recommended her es
say, "Why Young Women are More
Conservative," as perhaps the most
interesting to Stanford women for
its analysis of women's roles within
academic institutions. University
women today are unknowingly

being molded by these institutions
to perform certain functions in so
ciety, she said.
In an interview with The Daily,
Steinem said she believed her arti
cles are as applicable in the 1980s as
they were in the 1960s and 19705.
We are still "dictated by patterns of
power and powerlessness," she
said.
Although Steinem has often
railed against commercialism, she
appears in a glossy photo on the
cover of her new book. She said the
photo was necessary because, "I
was told by the publisher that the
average lifespan of a best seller is
somewhere between milk and
cheese."

Steinem opened her one-and-a
half hour autographing session
with a reference to the proposed
Reagan library complex at Stanford.
"You have my deepest sym
pathies," Steinem said. "The
campus in the Midwest that is re
sponsible for his lack of education
should be responsible for his
papers."
