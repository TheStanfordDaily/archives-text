## Organizations look for help at Community Services Faire 
### SHELLY WENTKER Staff Writer 
"I hope none of you will doubt that there is
such a thing as community service," University
President Donald Kennedy said to a crowd of
about 250 people who attended the first Stan
ford Community Service Faire held yesterday
in White Plaza.
Sponsored by the ASSU, the President's Of
fice and Community Outreach Program at
Stanford (CORPS), the faire provided about 30
on-campus service organizations, represent
ing what Kennedy called "almost every dimen
sion of community work in the area surround
ing Stanford," with the opportunity to present
information and recruit new members.
Croups participating in the faire included
SWOPSI, the Women's Center, United
Campus Christian Ministries, Stanford
Amigos, UPSE, Asian American Activities Cen
ter, Project Motivation, and the Stanford Spe
cial Olympics Committee.
The idea for the faire was generated early in
September when the President's Office called
a meeting of representatives from all the on
campus community service organizations. The
committee decided that a faire would be one
way to make people more aware of volunteer

organizations on campus:
This committee is also presently investigat
ing the possibility of setting up a clearing
house on campus tor these various organiza
tions within the next year. The purpose of the
clearinghouse would be to centralize campus
service groups in order to facilitate matching
outside organizations' needs for volunteers
with Stanford's resources, according to junior
Sue Mathison, who is a member of the com
mittee.
Here at Stanford, there are many different
types of service organizations in which stu
dents may get involved. However, many stu
dents "don't know how to go about getting
involved," Mathison said.
Catherine Milton, special assistant to the
president, said that in addition to providing
information, the purpose of the faire was "to
encourage more students to sign up as volun
teers."
The rationale behind this is that while the
student gives something back to the communi
ty in his volunteering, he also gains from it
educationally. Milton cites as an example that

students can get good work experience which,
may help them in obtaining internships or
jobs or in making career decisions.
Students also gain exposure to different
areas through volunteer work, according to
Milton, who said, "If you haven't tried it, you
don't know about it."
"We all have a great deal to learn from these
agencies," said Kennedy emphasizing the edu
cational aspects of volunteerism. He also
urged passers-by to talk to the various repre
sentatives and find out "what has made their
own commitment worthwhile."
Volunteering also "affords great opportuni
ties for personal growth," Kennedy contin
ued. "It's important to your own sense of
being productive."

Being productive in this manner does not
necessarily entail a big time commitment. Mat
hison said, "There are so many little things to
do that brighten other people's lives."
This is exactly what so many of Stanford's
community service organizations aim to do,
and yesterday's faire was a chance for them to
get additional support to continue their work.
Students involved in the organizations seem
to feel that the faire is a good way to help do
this.
Dave Flott, a member of the co-ed service
fraternity Alpha Phi Omega, said, "Service or
ganizations don't get a lot of publicity." He
added that in addition to getting more people
involved in community service, the faire pro
vides the various groups with "opportunity for
exchanges of membership."
The sponsors were pleased with the faire,
according to Mathison, who added,
"Hopefully, the people who were here were
reached in someway."
