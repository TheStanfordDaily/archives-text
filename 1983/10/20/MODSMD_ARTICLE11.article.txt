## Organizations look for help at Community Services Faire 
### SHELLY WENTKER Staff Writer 
"I hope none of you will doubt that there is
such a thing as community service," University
President Donald Kennedy said to a crowd of
about 250 people who attended the first Stan
ford Community Service Faire held yesterday
in White Plaza.
Sponsored by the ASSU, the President's Of
fice and Community Outreach Program at
Stanford (CORPS), the faire provided about 30
on-campus service organizations, represent
ing what Kennedy called "almost every dimen
sion of community work in the area surround
ing Stanford," with the opportunity to present
information and recruit new members.
Croups participating in the faire included
SWOPSI, the Women's Center, United
Campus Christian Ministries, Stanford
Amigos, UPSE, Asian American Activities Cen
ter, Project Motivation, and the Stanford Spe
cial Olympics Committee.
The idea for the faire was generated early in
September when the President's Office called
a meeting of representatives from all the on
campus community service organizations. The
committee decided that a faire would be one
way to make people more aware of volunteer

organizations on campus:
This committee is also presently investigat
ing the possibility of setting up a clearing
house on campus tor these various organiza
tions within the next year. The purpose of the
clearinghouse would be to centralize campus
service groups in order to facilitate matching
outside organizations' needs for volunteers
with Stanford's resources, according to junior
Sue Mathison, who is a member of the com
mittee.
Here at Stanford, there are many different
types of service organizations in which stu
dents may get involved. However, many stu
dents "don't know how to go about getting
involved," Mathison said.
Catherine Milton, special assistant to the
president, said that in addition to providing
information, the purpose of the faire was "to
encourage more students to sign up as volun
teers."
The rationale behind this is that while the
student gives something back to the communi
ty in his volunteering, he also gains from it
educationally. Milton cites as an example that
