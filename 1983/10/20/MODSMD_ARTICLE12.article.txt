# As development chief, Riggs is a happy man

"I think that I have the best
job in development in the
United States." As this
proud proclamation indi
cates, Henry Riggs has found
his niche as the University's
new vice president for devel
opment.
This summer, Riggs left his
post as chairman of the Indus
trial Engineering Department
to become one of the top ex
ecutives in the University ad
ministration.
That Riggs, who got his start
in industry, has become so
deeply involved in the Uni
versity is in some ways
surprising — especially to him.
"It was my original inten
tion to stay a year, then go
back to industry. But I've got
ten hooked on the place like
so many people do. And here
I am, four years later, doing
what I never would have pos
sibly forecasted I was going to
do. I suppose that no one is
more surprised than I am at
this turn of events."
Riggs said he accepted the
position because of the

quality of the University's de
velopment office. Stanford
has a long history of having an
agressive fundraising effort.
With very few exceptions, de
velopment revenues here

have been second only to
Harvard's for about the last
twenty years.
"This is a super place to do
development," said Riggs. "I

think we have at Stanford the
best development staff, and, I
think, we have the best devel
opment environment of any
place in the country. So if
you're offered the opportu-

This is a super place to
do development.... If
you're offered the
opportunity to lead up
what is the best
development operation in
the country, I think
you've gotta be nuts not
to take that job.

nity to head up what is the
best development operation in
the country, I think you've
gotta be nuts not to take that
job."

Riggs said that the the im
portance of development — the
raising of money for the Uni
versity — was another reason
for his decision to take the
post.

"l think it's an important
job that needs to be done and
to be done well," he said.
And, Riggs added, Univer
sity President Donald Ken

nedy "is a very good sales
man, and he convinced me to
do the job."
The vice presidency was
vacated in June of 1982 when
)oel Smith resigned for medi
cal reasons. Bruce Hinchliffe,
now Riggs' associate vice
president, took over as the in
terim vice president until a
search committee finally ap
pointed Riggs in March.
The Office of Development
is primarily concerned with
fund raising—from individuals,
corporations, foundations
and other sources. Alumni
are also a very important
source, but according to
Riggs most people don't
realize that quite a large
amount of funds come from
other sources. The develop
ment office is responsible for
soliciting and controlling all
funds other than those for
sponsored research projects.
"One could consider this a
marketing operation."
