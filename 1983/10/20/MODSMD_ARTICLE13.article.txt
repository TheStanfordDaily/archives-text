## The 						Stanford Daily Duty calls grad students 
### 
At Orientation this year, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy told incoming freshmen
to reach out to graduate students and get in
volved in the advanced research component
of the University. Given the apathy surround
ing this week's ASSU Graduate Senate elec
tion, we think it's also worth encouraging
graduate students to reach out and get in
volved in the University.
Those graduate students who made it to the
polls yesterday and Tuesday found some
notable gaps on the ballot. While seven engi
neering students entered the race for that
school's three seats, not one student from the
Schools of Education or Medicine expressed
an interest in the ASSU by the declaration
deadline, and only last-minute write-in cam
paigns kept the seats from remaining vacant.
Elections Commissioner Brian Mariscal,
noting that six empty seats remained after last
year's ASSU election, lamented, "It's a recur
ring problem."
It's also a difficult problem to solve, for a
number of reasons. Graduate students are
here primarily, if not exclusively, to study.
Their loyalties often lie with their undergradu
ate alma maters, and many have left behind
their interest in extracurriculars. Those who do
become involved in outside activities often do
so within their own departments, which tend
to be isolated from the rest of campus. The
separation is increased due to the large num
ber of graduate students living off campus.
For most graduate students, the only bond
with the University outside their school of
study is Tresidder Union and a couple of foot

ball games. To them, student government is
less than a joke, it doesn't exist.
While the apathy is understandable,
however, it is not excusable. Graduate stu
dents comprise 50 percent of this University,
and they have the potential to greatly enhance
the Stanford community. They bring with
them an undergraduate experience, which
they could use to benefit the ASSU and other
campus organizations. With graduate students
learning and working together with under
graduates, students here could have a
stronger voice.
Many graduate students complain that the
ASSU deals only with undergraduate issues,
but if more graduate students got involved,
the ASSU could deal with more graduate stu
dent issues, and also deal better with univer
sity issues. Guest professorships, the Coffee
House, the Hoover Institution, teaching assis
tants, the University budget and numerous
other issues affect both undergraduates and
graduates alike.
The ASSU requires involvement to survive.
It can live with minimal graduate student par
ticipation, but Stanford suffers when senate
seats remain vacant or are filled by un
publicized write-in campaigns.
Graduate students should heed the words
of one of the Engineering School candidates,
who told The Daily: "Sure we study a lot, but
you can't study 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. Part of getting an education is getting
involved." It's easier for a freshman to follow
that advice, but it's important that graduate
students follow it as well.
