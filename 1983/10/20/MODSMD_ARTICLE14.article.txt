# Buttons and beer

From the kegs of the Donner Street Party to
the bars chosen for Senior Pub Nights, stu
dents sometimes flout the ability to hold liq
uor like a badge of honor.
While this University is hardly a stereotypi
cal "party school," the art of being a super
achiever and a super-partier is cultivated to a
high degree by the undergraduate popula
tion. Many hours are given over to the con
templation and consumption of alcohol.
Unfortunately, drinking safety is not always
considered with equal care, and is often the
subject of derision. It almost seems preten
tious to write about partying and safety. It
shouldn't.
Last night's Senior Pub Night at 42nd Street
marked the beginning of an effort to make
partying safer. Due to a plan designed by
senior Rob Larkins, seniors who were too
blasted to make it home last night didn't have
to worry about Driving Under the Influence
citations or, worse, accidents. They just had to
find a "Designated Driver" to take them
home.
According to the set-up, seniors who volun
teer not to drink during Senior Pub Nights will
receive "Designated Driver" buttons and free

soda for the entire night. A signup board will
be available to those who need a ride home.
People have been joking about the
"Brownie Button" plan, saying that it will
never work. But under closer analysis, the
Designated Driver buttons benefit everyone
involved. The designated drivers get free
soda; the pubs get free publicity from an
nouncements at home football games; the
partying seniors have a good time and get
home safely. There's really nothing funny
about it. In fact it's great to see the businesses,
students and the University working together
on this issue. Two years ago, three students
were driving home from partying at a Senior
Pub Night at the Golden Spike. The car they
were in hit a tree by the side of Campus Drive.
Two students were killed. Last fall, the driver
of that car was sentenced to a year in prison.
It's too bad the sober driver idea wasn't in
itiated years ago.
Rather than being a nagging attempt to put a
damper on a good time, the Designated
Drivers program recognizes a simple fact:
While its fun to party, driving while drunk is
not a joke, and drunk drivers don't always
have the last laugh.
