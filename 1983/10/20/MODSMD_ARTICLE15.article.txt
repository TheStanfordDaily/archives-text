Sex isn't everything
My stomach was churning even
before I finished reading the
headline in Monday's Daily (Oct.
12) claiming that "AIDS threat
instills caution in Stanford gay
community." Each time I read an
article like this, I fear we're a long
way from considering lesbian and
gay individuals as people with
anything but sex as the top
priority in their life. Comments by
two of the people interviewed in
the article left me with the impres
sion that one of my biggest con
* cerns as a gay man, in light of
AIDS, is whether or not I should
toss myself into bed" with the
next man I meet.
I happen to be a human being
with goals and concerns far more
important than my sex life. If I
were a heterosexual person, I'd
wager that I would not expect to
pick up tomorrow's Daily and
confront "Herpes threat instills
caution in Stanford heterosexual
community" as a headline. We
assume that for most heterosexual
people, sexually transmitted
diseases are not of dramatic con
i ern. We further assume that a
heterosexual person's sex life is
but one part of his or her life, and
not the be-all or end-all of
heterosexuality which merits a
frequent splash of ink on the front
page of The Daily and other
papers.
AIDS is not unimportant to the
lesbian and gay community of
Stanford. But issues like jobs,
prejudice, politics, love, romance,
relationships, children and dating
are not unimportant either. I wish
we would see more attention paid
to these concerns as well, in
recognition of the fact that gay
people are more tban merely
sexual beings.

Shelve the library
As a lifetime member ot the
StanTord Alumni Association (class
of 1947), I want to express my
opposition to the proposed

Reagan complex (library, museum
and policy center).
The essence of Stanford is its
distinguished record of intellec
tual achievement. President
Reagan would diminish this record
for two basic reasons: 1) His own
mediocre scholastic record, and 2)
His anti-education record as a
political leader.
Regarding his mediocre scholas
tic record, Reagan received grades
of 'D' in high school (reported in
USA Today). He graduated with
a 'C' average trom a little
known college in Illinois.
As president, Reagan severely
cut back on the student loan pro
gram. This has hurt Stanford and,
even more so, smaller universities.
Moreover, millions of students
from lower income families have
been frustrated by this action.
I have a better idea: Why
doesn't Reagan request that the
Reagan complex be located at
USC? All of his close friends,
including his "kitchen cabinet"
live in the Los Angeles area. Also,
USC is deeply involved with the
movie industry and they could
easily get copies of Reagan's 'B'
movies for his museum.

Bomb scares
It's not every Saturday that I am
asked to evacuated my office be
cause of a bomb scare. Still, I han
dle it with frightening aplomb.
Have I become that used to these
onslaughts on society and on my
personal safety (this is my second
bomb scare)? I hope not â€” for
everyone's sake.
Vou see, I work in international
education. My research takes me
from studies of conflict resolution
in primary school classrooms to
the politics of educational ex
change. I don't relish the thought
of being blown to smithereens on
a tranquil Saturday afternoon
while writing up my research on
international understanding.
This Saturday afternoon I was

escorted from my office in the
basement of Hoover Tower. On
my way out, I was struck by the
sight of a small box, the size of a
child's lunchbox, with wires
protruding out, nestled in the
corner of the foyer, surrounded
by chairs. "Could that be my
bomb?" I thought as the security
guard waltzed me out the door.
I'm just a quiet graduate student
given office space in the basement
of a monolith filled with papers
and the undetermined power of
words. I am cognizant of the con
troversy around the "Tower." Still,
I have to question, on this Satur
day afternoon, the value of
blowing up books and papers . . .
and me. It seems there may be a
more peaceful and, hopefully,
more effective way of registering
disapproval.
So much for international un
derstanding and peaceful Saturday
afternoons.
