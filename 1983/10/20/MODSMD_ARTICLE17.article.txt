# Reagan rescinds civil liberties
## 
### 
Traditionally most Americans are
not very concerned about civil
liberties. People assume that the
United States invented freedom,
and think there is no danger that
such privileges can be eroded.
Consequently, few Americans pay
much attention to their rights.
Social scientists routinely can get
a majority of people to approve
repealing some ot the Bill of
Rights guarantees, when not identi
fied as such, in the interest of
"fighting crime" or "fighting the
Russians." It is not surprising that
the Reagan administration has had
little opposition to its pruning in
the area of civil liberties.
Individually, the Reagan in
itiatives against civil liberties may
not seem terribly troubling. Seen
as a group, they form a pattern
which becomes more unsettling.
For instance, the administration is
demanding lifetime censorship
rights over all government
employees who ever handle classi
fied information. Many of the same
employees must undergo manda
tory, regular lie detector tests about
whether they are leaking scandals
to the press. The FBI has again got
ten permission to conduct surveil
lance on domestic political groups.
It is now a crime to print the
names of CIA agents, even if you
get the information from public
records and even if the agents are

breaking laws. New rules ensure
that many more government docu
ments are kept secret, and old se
cret documents are declassified
more slowly. The administration is
pressing Congress to make it more
difficult to get unclassified informa
tion from government agencies.
Reforms which were passed to
make sure things like Watergate
never happen again are quietly
being repealed.
Some of Reagan's cutbacks in
civil liberties hit close to home.
University federal research contract
conditions have been tightened,
and the decrease in total research
dollars makes the new restrictive
conditions hard to resist. More
professors nationwide than ever
before are doing work which they
cannot publish fully. Stanford offi
cially refuses such contracts.
Not only have government
funded foreign academic ex
changes been drastically cut, but it
is becoming more difficult to get
visas for private exchanges. The
visas of researchers who have lived
in the United States for years have
been pulled, and the State Depart
ment refuses to give justifications.
The administration has tried to limit
the access of students from
"unfriendly" countries to informa
tion and sometimes even specific
courses. The Commerce Depart
ment wants to apply export controls

to private, non-classified research
data in the minds of some profes
sors, for instance cryptographers.
The State Department had denied
visas to speakers seeking to visit
American universities on the
ground that they are critics of the
U.S. If the U.S. really occupies
some kind of moral high ground,
why must we fear the challenge ot
"alien" ideas?
Most Stanford students do not
think they are likely to become
accused criminals, employees in
sensitive government jobs, or poli
tical activists â€” the big losers when
civil liberties are cut back. It is good
to worry anyway. A few months ago,
I was talking to an old friend of
mine who is now working the night
shift for the FBI. Suddenly he
started reading off the FBl's com
puter file on me. I was more than a
little surprised that such a thing
existed, and I asked him about it. I
told him I had worked for the
Census Bureau in 1980, and that was
the answer. In that case, he said,
"Oh, we know everything about
you." Every county sheriff in Ala
bama has access to the files.
1984 is not so far away. I suggest
that our civil liberties are in more
danger than we might assume Vovu
rights are worth your concern.
