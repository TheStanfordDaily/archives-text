## The 						Shockley-Davis connection 
### 
About a month ago William Shockley gave a short
talk to incoming students about certain technical
fields of study and research at Stanford. As always, the
University tried to back down from its invitation to
have him speak. Students protested with signs like
"Shockley â€” Scientist/Racist?" and "No genocide."
These didn't really have anything to do with Shock
ley's talk, but I can understand why his presence might
upset some people.
Angela Davis also spoke here recently. What amazed
me was that before she appeared we saw large signs on
campus hailing and welcoming her. I saw none pro
testing and nobody seemed to mind her coming to
lecture. The next day The Daily ran headlines about
her talk. When Shockley spoke, The Daily ran
headlines about the protest.
Now, I'm no big fan of either of these people, but I
do sense a serious displacement of values here. An
gela Davis is an avowed radical socialist and speaks of
violent revolution. Words from her mouth smack of
anger, violence and hatred. She is not a liberal
thinker. She is rigid and her vision is narrow. She has
been an outspoken advocate of terrorism. I've heard
her speak before and did not attend her recent talk. I
want none of what she has to offer.
William Shockley is a Nobel laureate. What contro
versy surrounds him comes primarily from what other
people have said. Most of what I've heard is at least
second hand. I've heard that he has said, "Blacks are
not as smart as whites." Uncomfortable as this idea
may make us (or at least myself) I'll not condemn the
man on the basis of second-hand information.
Before flying into blind rage at the mention of such

an idea, I suggest we think a little bit. What is meant by
intelligence? What social, cultural and genetic factors
are involved in its determination? Is is the result of
hard work on the part of the individual, the result of
family training or good luck? What would answers to
any of these questions mean?
An individual is or is not valuable because of ac
tions. Thus we must judge, if at all, not on the basis of
social or genetic history but by the actions of the indi
vidual. Furthermore, it is no shame to be less than an
intellectual powerhouse. Do we forget, being at Stan
ford, that we are among the elite, near the top of a
pyramid composed of farmers, miners, mechanics,
secretaries and hotel managers of varying intellectual
abilities ?
History is full of unfulfilled potential. We might en
courage then the belief that hard work is valuable; or
that it's more important to do a job well than bask in
the ego glory of a picture on the cover of the National
Enquirer.
We praise and listen to Angela Davis because she is a
black, woman, outspoken radical. We assume that be
cause Shockley is old, white and male his motives are
racist. This indicates the absurdity of our own fickle
prejudices more than the content of the speakers'
works.
Let us deal with Shockley, giving him a chance to
challenge us and trying to destroy his arguments while
retaining his right to a speaking forum. But let us not
give in to the wild, furious hatred that so characterizes
Angela Davis. If we do we will lose all we have and gain
bloody chaos.
