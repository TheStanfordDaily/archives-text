# Capoeira: fun, fitness and Brazilian slave revolt
## 
### RACHANA KAMTEKAR 
There's always the first-things-first question
about Capoeira — how do you pronounce it?
Well, you say "ka-pu-e-ra."
And then there's the second-things-second
question. What is it?
Capoeira is a martial art with a difference:
It's performed played to music and contains
elements of dance.
One of the 10 grand masters of Capoeira
alive today, Mestre Bira, teaches classes in
the art here. Assisted by Tony Hutchinson,
one of the best Capoeristas in California, Bira
teaches between 10 and 15 members of the
Stanford Capoeira Club three times a week in
the dance room of the Governor's Corner Pro
gram Center.
Capoeira originated among African slaves in
Brazil about 400 years ago. The slaves practiced
fighting in time to music, pretending to be
dancing, thus fooling the slave owners. The
ploy worked; many of these slaves killed their
masters and established independent slave
societies called "quilombos." When slavery
was abolished in Brazil in 1880, the Capoeristas
became outcasts. They were denied jobs and
suffered discrimination because their unique
fighting methods gave them a reputation for
treachery.
In 1937, Mestre Bimba, the father of modern
Capoeira, established a formal school for
Capoeira which was later recognized by the
Brazilian government. Capoeira grew in
popularity, even becoming a dance form in
some schools.
Today, Capoeira is taught in Brazil, Paris,
New York and California. The Stanford
Capoeira Club, which is four years old, is
one of the oldest in California.

Capoeira is pertormed in a "roda," or circle
with pairs of players miming one anothers
movements. A cartwheel begins the act, but
after that, anything goes. The basic movement,
the "jinga," is a side-to-side motion that al
lows for circular attack. The aim of Capoeira is
to surprise your opponent, but the game is
practiced with very little actual contact.
"Sometimes you just click with someone
and you respond really naturally to each
other," explained Elba Serrano, who's been
doing Capoeira for several years.

Capoeristas also learn to play the instru
ments that make Capoeira music. The main in
strument is the Berimbau, a one-stringed bow
that sets the pace for the game; the music
determines whether the performance will be
slow or fast, acrobatic or dance-like, close to
the ground or high-up. The pace is also varied
depending on the player's experience.
"Tony (Hutchison) is very sensitive to your
strength and level of experience when he's
teaching you," said a sophomore who
switched from Jujitsu to Capoeira last year.
"It's a great workout. It exercises your
spine, back, legs and neck. There's nothing
else that can do that," one Capoeira enthusiast
said.
"It's a lot of fun. That's the most important
reason (to do Capoeira) — it's fun."
