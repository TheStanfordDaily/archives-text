# Ehrlichman and ethics didn't mix here
## 
### 
I heard a rumor that while
John Ehrlichman was attending
the Law School here in the
19505, he also taught an under
graduate course in "Ethics."
Can this possibly be true?
Sorry, but from the scant in-

Bug Me

formation I've scraped to
gether on Ehrlichman's
studies at Stanford, your
rumor seems to be nothing
more than just a rumor.
Ehrlichman entered Stanford
Law School in 1948 after being
discharged from the Air Force
as a Ist Lieutenant in 1945 and
attending UCLA on the Gl Bill.
According to the Courses and
Degrees and faculty direc
tories issued back then,
Ehrlichman was just a student
during his three years here.
The only course in Ethics of
fered back then was offered

by the Philosophy Department
and taught by Prof. Mother
shead in 1949 and Prof. Clafe
in 1950.
Ehrlichman could well have
been a TA in this class but no
one seems to keep records on

this sort of trivia. Glafe is
no longer with the University
and Mothershead, now
emeritus, has recently taken ill
and was unavailable for com
ment. Apparently Ehrlich
man's career at Stanford was
somewhat less controversial
than some of his later under
takings as most people I talked
to didn't even know he had
once been a student here.
The jacket flap of Ehrlich
man's latest novel, The Whole
Truth , didn't say much, but
his piece in Current Biog
raphy, revealed that in 1967 he

taught real estate law at the
University of Washington.
I wish I could have shown
that one of the most notorious
Watergate conspirators once
lectured on ethics at Stanford,
but the case for it doesn't look
good.
A correction from last week:
There were apparently a
few bugs in the system last
week and some information
about the Dish area was
somewhat misinformed. Dish
passes have been required for
entrance into the Dish area
for at least five years (which
must classify me and most of
the Stanford community as
habitual criminals.) If you
want to turn from your life of
crime, passes are available for
free at 105 Encina Hall. Most
importantly, I reported that
people are "discouraged"
from penetrating into the
Dish region as far as the lake
hidden back in the foothills
(called Felt Lake). I was in
formed this week that in this
case "discouragement" in
cludes citations for trespass
ing and other ugliness. Accor

ding to Zera Murphy of the
Stanford Investment Manage
ment Organization, "the only
legal area is between Junipero
Serra Boulevard and the 'Big
Dish.'" The passes have a map
on the back showing the
allowed routes exactlv.
Now then, I've got some
thing that's been bugging me.
Last year, Bug Me columnist
emeritus Mike Hale got
enough queries from in
quisitive little minds to fill
whole Sunday Supplements
with dry, witty investigations
into Stanford's archives of
trivial information. The most
interesting question I've
received this year is "Why are
there pre-meds?" and I can't
print it because no one seems
to know the answer.
The contest for the most in
teresting, or just any interest
ing, question continues. First
prize is, of course, the three
