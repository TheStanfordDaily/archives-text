## Rose leaves the Phillies 
### 
Philadelphia <AP) â€” Saying there must be a
major league team that wants him,
infielder-outtielder Pete Rose yesterday said
he refused an otter to stay with the Philadel
phia Phillies as a part-time plaver.
"I don't like to play part-time," Rose said
during a press conference tailed by Phillies
owner Bill Giles to announce that the veteran
player had been released.
"I've been an evervday player for so many
years it is hard tor me to play three days a
week. I'm sure there are some teams out there
who want me," Rose said.
Giles said, "I admire him more than
anybody who has ever been in uniform.
In turn, Rose said he wanted to wish the
Phillies "nothing but success in the future
and added that he had some tond memories of
his years in Philadelphia.
Rose, 42, insisted he can play on a regular
basis and said he would even be willing to
consider switching trom the National League
to the American League as a designated hitter.
"It's major league baseball,'' he said. It's
easier to DH a tew days a week and then play a
few days a week.
Rose said he turned down a part-time role
with the Phillies because he wanted to break
Ty Cobb's all-time major league career hit
record of 4191. Rose has 5990 hits and needs
only 10 hits to become the second player in
major league histor\ to reach to 4000 mile
stone.

His goal, he added, also is one of his major
selling points as a tree agent looking for a
team.
"I'm going after Ty Cobb's record and
they're (another team) going to cash in on that
reward, too," Rose said.
The Phillies released Rose, who hit only .245
with 17 extra base hits in 198.}, because they
plan to go with rookie Len Matuszek next
season.
There were rumors that Rose might sign with
the Atlanta Braves, and play lett field. When
asked about that, Rose turned to his agent,
Reuven Kalz, for an answer.
"Any rumor is a false rumor," katz said.
"We haven't had anv conversations with
anyone. We didn't know until an hour ago
what the Phillies had in mind."
Rose added that league rules prohibit such
"conversations."
Rose was signed by the Phillies on Dec. 5,
1978, as a tree agent. He had played out his
option with the Cincinnati Reds.
The Phillies signed him to a tour-year con
tract estimated at $3.3 million over four years.
When the contract ran out last season, Rose
was signed to a one-year deal with a $300,000
buyout clause, which the Phillies could invoke
if they decided not to renew the contract by
Nov. 15, 1983. Rose collected the $300,000 yes
terday.
