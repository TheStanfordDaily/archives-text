# Survey rates Card women's athletics as the best
## 
### MARGARET SULLIVAN 
When the sports highlights
of the recent past are
recalled, names like John El
way, Tim Mayotte and Jody
Campbell come to mind.
Men's tennis, water polo,
swimming and baseball are
rightly lauded as some of the
University's outstanding pro
grams. But this scenario
precludes a major part of
Stanford athletics: women's
. sports.
With athletics playing a sup
porting role to academics and
men's programs occupying
the traditional focal role, wo
men's athletics tend to be un
derplayed. Few are aware of
the national excellence of wo
men's athletics at Stanford.
Just last summer, however,
| Stanford was named the top
collegiate women's athletic
program in the nation based
on a survey conducted by the
Santa Monica Evening Out
look. This award is given
based on national top 10
112 lishes in the 10 most
I >pular Division I women's
; <-oorts. Stanford's first place
iinish marks the first time in
six years that a school other
than UCLA has taken the top
spot in the competition for
the National Ail-Around Ath
letic Excellence Award.

The sports in which points
were awarded were basket
ball, golf, cross country, gym
nastics, field hockey, Softball,
swimming and diving, track
and field, tennis and volley
ball. Despite the lack of a wo
men's softball intercollegiate
program, Stanford still
managed to accumulate
enough points in the remain
ing sports to finish on top.
Stanford won the NCAA
swimming and diving champi
onship — the first NCAA swim
ming title in Cardinal history.
The volleyball team had its
best-ever season, finishing
fourth. In cross country Stan
ford placed an outstanding
second. Tennis succeeded in
placing fourth while track and
field was not far behind,
tinishing sixth.
Although Stanford did not
place in the top 10 in golf,
basketball, gymnastics or field
hockey, all tour programs ap
pear to have promising
futures. Golf looks especially
strong and it's quite likely that
the women's golf team will
place in the top 10 this com
ing season.
The all-around superiority
of Stanford women's pro
grams may be a surprise to
outsiders, but not to those
who make up the Cardinal

program. Mary Beth
Linzmeier, one of Stanford's
premier swimmers, works
very actively for the Cardinal
Club in recruiting. She
received word of Stanford's
winning the National All-
Around Athletic Excellence
Award while attending a Car
dinal Club meeting. "I'm just
happy to be a part of making
Stanford No. 1," Linzmeier
said. "Our record makes
people realize that Stanford
athletics are tops — just like our
academics."
Susan Compton, a strong
and powerful outside hitter
on the volleyball team, agrees
with Linzmeier.
"I'm proud to play for Stan
ford,'' she said. It's one of the
only schools in the nation that
combines excellent athletics
with excellent education."
Compton feels that she
receives respect by others.
"People realize it's hard to go
to a school and play when
you're at a school like Stan
ford."
Not only do women
exude pride in Stanford ath
letics but they also feel that
their respective programs are
well supported. Compton adds
"People here pump you up.

They're really behind you."
Elise Burgin, one of Stan
ford's star tennis players,
said, "No other university in
the nation offered as out
standing tennis and aca
demic programs as Stanford.
The tennis tradition for men
and women at Stanford is tops
in the country." For Burgin it
is the overall atmosphere at
Stanford that breeds success.
"Coaches emphasize the
importance of studies and
professors are really sup
portive," Burgin says."It
wouldn't be as easy combin
ing college tournaments, pro
circuits and tough academics
at another school, because
here at Stanford the environ
ment is challenging and you
are motivated to excel."
Frank Brennan, the wo
men's tennis coach, believes
that Stanford's athletic pro
gram is really unique. "In
terms of recruiting Stanford is
ideal," Brennan said. "The Ivy
League can match our
academics but not our ath
letics. The West Coast schools
have good athletic programs
but don't offer the same in
terms of academics."
Proof of the dual attraction
of academics and athletics is
reflected by the fact that the
tennis team got three of the
nation's top four recruits this
past year. Tennis is not alone
in this respect. The other wo
men's teams also drew the
cream of the crop.
Brennan believes that the
women's athletic program is
more liberal and progressive
than most of its competitors.
"Women are really treated
well at Stanford," Brennan
said. "At Stanford, athletic
facilities are coed — men don't
monopolize the best athletic
facilities the way they do at
other schools.
"Much of the success for
creating such a liberal pro
gram must be attributed to
Andy Geiger (the school's ath
letic director)," Brennan said.
"He has really done a lot in
making women's athletics so
outstanding at Stanford."
Brennan believes that Stan
ford provides an excellent
training ground for women.
"Girls are motivated to
maximize their potentials,"
Brennan explains. "They are
able to interact and compete
with guys on an equal basis,
lust look at the top female
names in the nation . . .
Sandra Day O'Connor, Sally
Ride ... of course they are
from Stanford. This university
breeds exceptional women."

tinishing sixth.
Although Stanford did not
place in the top 10 in golf,
basketball, gymnastics or field
hockey, all tour programs ap
pear to have promising
futures. Golf looks especially
strong and it's quite likely that
the women's golf team will
place in the top 10 this com
ing season.
The all-around superiority
of Stanford women's pro
grams may be a surprise to
outsiders, but not to those
who make up the Cardinal

program. Mary Beth
Linzmeier, one of Stanford's
premier swimmers, works
very actively for the Cardinal
Club in recruiting. She
received word of Stanford's
winning the National All-
Around Athletic Excellence
Award while attending a Car
dinal Club meeting. "I'm just
happy to be a part of making
Stanford No. 1," Linzmeier
said. "Our record makes
people realize that Stanford
athletics are tops — just like our
academics."
Susan Compton, a strong
and powerful outside hitter
on the volleyball team, agrees
with Linzmeier.
"I'm proud to play for Stan
ford,'' she said. It's one of the
only schools in the nation that
combines excellent athletics
with excellent education."
Compton feels that she
receives respect by others.
"People realize it's hard to go
to a school and play when
you're at a school like Stan
ford."
Not only do women
exude pride in Stanford ath
letics but they also feel that
their respective programs are
well supported. Compton adds
"People here pump you up.

They're really behind you."
Elise Burgin, one of Stan
ford's star tennis players,
said, "No other university in
the nation offered as out
standing tennis and aca
demic programs as Stanford.
The tennis tradition for men
and women at Stanford is tops
in the country." For Burgin it
is the overall atmosphere at
Stanford that breeds success.
"Coaches emphasize the
importance of studies and
professors are really sup
portive," Burgin says."It
wouldn't be as easy combin
ing college tournaments, pro
circuits and tough academics
at another school, because
here at Stanford the environ
ment is challenging and you
are motivated to excel."
Frank Brennan, the wo
men's tennis coach, believes
that Stanford's athletic pro
gram is really unique. "In
terms of recruiting Stanford is
ideal," Brennan said. "The Ivy
League can match our
academics but not our ath
letics. The West Coast schools
have good athletic programs
but don't offer the same in
terms of academics."
Proof of the dual attraction
of academics and athletics is
reflected by the fact that the
tennis team got three of the
nation's top four recruits this
past year. Tennis is not alone
in this respect. The other wo
men's teams also drew the
cream of the crop.
Brennan believes that the
women's athletic program is
more liberal and progressive
than most of its competitors.
"Women are really treated
well at Stanford," Brennan
said. "At Stanford, athletic
facilities are coed — men don't
monopolize the best athletic
facilities the way they do at
other schools.
"Much of the success for
creating such a liberal pro
gram must be attributed to
Andy Geiger (the school's ath
letic director)," Brennan said.
"He has really done a lot in
making women's athletics so
outstanding at Stanford."
Brennan believes that Stan
ford provides an excellent
training ground for women.
"Girls are motivated to
maximize their potentials,"
Brennan explains. "They are
able to interact and compete
with guys on an equal basis,
lust look at the top female
names in the nation . . .
Sandra Day O'Connor, Sally
Ride ... of course they are
from Stanford. This university
breeds exceptional women."

Last year, the women's swimming and diving team won its first-ever NCAA swimming title.
When the sports highlights
of the recent past are
recalled, names like John El
way, Tim Mayotte and Jody
Campbell come to mind.
Men's tennis, water polo,
swimming and baseball are
rightly lauded as some of the
University's outstanding pro
grams. But this scenario
precludes a major part of
Stanford athletics: women's
. sports.
With athletics playing a sup
porting role to academics and
men's programs occupying
the traditional focal role, wo
men's athletics tend to be un
derplayed. Few are aware of
the national excellence of wo
men's athletics at Stanford.
Just last summer, however,
| Stanford was named the top
collegiate women's athletic
program in the nation based
on a survey conducted by the
Santa Monica Evening Out
look. This award is given
based on national top 10
112 lishes in the 10 most
I >pular Division I women's
; <-oorts. Stanford's first place
iinish marks the first time in
six years that a school other
than UCLA has taken the top
spot in the competition for
the National Ail-Around Ath
letic Excellence Award.

The sports in which points
were awarded were basket
ball, golf, cross country, gym
nastics, field hockey, Softball,
swimming and diving, track
and field, tennis and volley
ball. Despite the lack of a wo
men's softball intercollegiate
program, Stanford still
managed to accumulate
enough points in the remain
ing sports to finish on top.
Stanford won the NCAA
swimming and diving champi
onship — the first NCAA swim
ming title in Cardinal history.
The volleyball team had its
best-ever season, finishing
fourth. In cross country Stan
ford placed an outstanding
second. Tennis succeeded in
placing fourth while track and

tinishing sixth.
