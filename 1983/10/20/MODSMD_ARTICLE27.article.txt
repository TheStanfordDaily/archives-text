## Claude Bolling and Herbie Mann: you gotta love 'em 
### SCOTT AREY 
| As what could only be des
cribed as a "hoity-toity" Palo
Alto crowd waited patiently in
phe midafternoon sun for the
Besser among them to enter
■he infamous Memorial
Auditorium, I had to ask
■nyself, "Hey I know Claude
Boiling is great on his
'records, but will he really be
Bible to bring his music to life
|n one of the poorest acoustic
fcettings in the state (Mem
lAud), and for the most pom
fjpous and apathetic audience
In the entire world?"
|{ As the question ran through
ftny mind again and again, I
ffisurveyed the crowd to see if
|my assumptions about them
correct. Indeed they
■were "hoity-toity." Bantering
■about with cheap California
Swine in "elegant" plastic
Ilcups, eating their Mrs. Fields
' cookies and talking about the
great Northern California life,
they were enough to make
lany self-respecting New
Yorker ill.
The only exceptions of
Icourse were the few students
who attended and some
professors who realized that
their only function that after
noon was to add prestige to
the rather unconventional
concert. As both my com
patriot and I noted this was an
unprecedented concert.
Never before has Lively Arts at
I Stanford sponsored an artist
[ with the mass appeal of Bol
| ling. It seemed almost out of
I their realm and the crowd
[ knew it.
I decided that the crowd
I was out to get Boiling. After
I all he was French, or at least
not of this land, and really
! had no right to such niceties
i as an open-minded, attentive
audience. I also decided that I
had better find my seat since
it was now 2:25 and if I did not
get in before those of higher
social status I would be ex-
I eluded entirely.
As the lights dimmed I ex
| pected someone to come out
| and introduce Mr. Boiling as
| is the commom practice at
these events. I was half
shocked, half-amused to find
the band coming on stage
•without an introduction fol
lowed by a jovial yet deter
mined looking Boiling' who
lept into his first number "We
Love You All Madly" with un-
I usual fervor setting the
serious-minded audience
somewhat on edge. During
the course of the piece Boi
ling and his band demon
strated both technical
prowess and fluid musical
phrasing successfully making
a connection between
"classical" development and
a smooth jazz/blues style.
After briefly acknowledging
the rather meager applause
with a nod of his head, Boi
ling began the second num
ber "Allez Francais." Imagine

Johannes Sebastian Bach
playing for beers in a New Or
leans cafe. The resulting
blues-baroque combination
would almost certainly sound
like a rendition of "Allez Fran
cais." The audience was
stirred by this unique
mixture, but seemed to over
look the player most worthy
of attention on the number,
Steve LeStina.
The number showcased
some of LeStina's "hottest
chops," with him traveling
the length of the bass' neck
in record time. LeStina was
later introduced by Boiling as
a "new friend," but he played
as if he and Boiling were
childhood buddies. LeStina
served thoughout the concert
as the heart of the group
around which Boiling and
Mann worked their magic.
Surprisingly, drummer Jean
Claude Dayan was very uni
mpressive although com
petent. Sometimes he would
look bored or distracted and a
number of times he unabas
hedly glared at the audience,
as if trying to see what real
Californians looked like. FHe
seemed to play very much the
part of Richard Starky and I
was certain that before the
show was over he would be
singing "Octopus' Garden."
At the conclusion of "Allez
Francais" there was a warm
though guarded applause
after which Boiling intro
duced himself and his
"orchestra." Appropriately
he referred to LeStina as "the
string section," and then in
troduced his featured guest
soloist — flutist Herbie Mann.
While Boiling and his band
wore mostly white with light
pastels, Mann donned a blue
velvet sport coat, assuming
the stage as if it were Boiling
who was the featured guest
soloist.
After Mann's appearance I
realized a stark contrast be
tween the attitudes of the two
French musicians- Bollingand
Dayan — and that of the two
Americans-Mann and LeStina.
While the Americans had a
certain reverence towards
each other and their music,
the French took a less serious
attitude; making noises, jum
ping up and down and audib
ly chee/itTg oil "froth them
selves and the audience.
The quartet's first number
was a playful questiorvand-an
swer blues selection during
which Mann appeared to be a
nice old guy who was just
starting to lose his stuff. The
second number proved that
appearences are quite deceiv
ing. Suddenly Mann launched
himself into one of three blis
tering solos as the band
worked its way through Boi
ling's "California Suite."
Mann brillantly injected syn
copated rhythms into Boi
ling's classic phrasing, at
times seeming almost poly

rhythmic.
I sensed a change in the
crowds attitude after each
movement of the suite. It
seemed that Boiling's first
numbers had prepared them
for his abrupt style and now
they were becoming cap
tivated, almost entranced by
his impish maneuvers.The
third movement, which was
almost all Boiling, was fol
lowed by truly heartfelt ap
plause and it seemed that Boi
ling was turning the mood of
the afternoon from one of
static disassociation to sur
ging life.
The "California Suite" was
followed by the "Green Dol
phin Street Improv" which
again showcased LeStina's
remarkable talent on the bass,
and two of Mann's own com
positions. The first of these
was Sir Charles Duke, a slow,
though not quite melancholy,
piece that contained a consis
tently low, seductive flute
part, with Boiling arpeggiat
ing over the top of it. It
seemed that Boiling's only
flaw during the concert was
the over-arpeggiation of this
and Mann's second number
"Jazz Dancing." Mann's
studio versions of these songs

are quite beefy and it seemed
that Boiling was over
compensating for the lack of
instrumentation on these
tunes.
At the conclusion of "Jazz
Dancing," Boiling and com
pany bolted the stage before
the applause had a chance to
wane, which was extremely
fast, because as soon as they
hit the last note there was a
mad dash for the rest rooms
and the snack tables. Never
have I seen so much flab
move so fast. It was truly
breathtaking.
Boiling started the second
portion of the concert with
some spectacular solo playing
of classic American ragtime.
He played his versions of
"The Entertainer" and"The
Maple Leaf Rag" followed by a
number dedicated to Fats
Waller which he called "Fatty
Fats." In many of these tunes
he worked in familar folk
themes done in a blues style
like "Yankee Doodle." He
caps his solo performance
with a Janis Johnson song
called "Carolina Shout"
during which he perpetually
bopped up and down to the
beat.
The band with Herbie Mann
then came back on stage and
help Boiling ignite the audi
ence with the Earl Heniz'
composition "Boogie
Woogie." Although the audi
ence applauded furiously, not
one rose to his feet, probably
only because they knew the
best was yet to come.
There was a sudden hush as
Boiling approached the
microphone to annouce the

next number. The anticipa
tion was there and Boiling
capitalized on it by drawing
the mornent out as long as
possible. "We would now like
to play a piece which I re
corded with Jean Pierre Ram
pal .. . ." It was of course Boi
ling's most famous work, "A
Suite for Flute," the one
which brought his music to
the United States. Suddenly
Boiling ran off stage leaving a
confused, garbled trail of
syllables behind him. It seems
that he needed the assistance
of the written music, and he
had left it off-stage. Mann and
the others played "Tea for
Two" during his brief absence
which sent ripples of laughter
though the crowd. "The
Suite" was interpreted beauti
fully by Mann who was able to
give it his own flare while
staying true to the original
score.
At the end of the show, the
audience finally rose to its
feet cheering Boiling on for
two encores. The afternoon
with Claude Boliing and
Herbie Mann was a triumph
for both artists no doubt, with
each contributing to the final
animation of a draining and
pretentious audience;
however some real credit
must go to the sound man
running the boards. Never
before have I seen people
thank the sound man upon
leaving a concert, but his
praisewas well deserved.
In all it was a delightful ex
perience with Boiling direct
ing a spectacular potpourri of
sound that was quite like a
picnic.

tion for stylish covers like the one above.

some of LeStina's "hottest
chops," with him traveling
the length of the bass' neck
in record time. LeStina was
later introduced by Boiling as
a "new friend," but he played
as if he and Boiling were
childhood buddies. LeStina
served thoughout the concert
as the heart of the group
around which Boiling and
Mann worked their magic.
Surprisingly, drummer Jean
Claude Dayan was very uni
mpressive although com
petent. Sometimes he would
look bored or distracted and a
number of times he unabas
hedly glared at the audience,
as if trying to see what real
Californians looked like. FHe
seemed to play very much the
part of Richard Starky and I
was certain that before the
show was over he would be
singing "Octopus' Garden."
At the conclusion of "Allez
Francais" there was a warm
though guarded applause
after which Boiling intro
duced himself and his
"orchestra." Appropriately
he referred to LeStina as "the
string section," and then in
troduced his featured guest
soloist — flutist Herbie Mann.
While Boiling and his band
wore mostly white with light
pastels, Mann donned a blue
velvet sport coat, assuming
the stage as if it were Boiling
who was the featured guest
soloist.
After Mann's appearance I
realized a stark contrast be
tween the attitudes of the two
French musicians- Bollingand
Dayan — and that of the two
Americans-Mann and LeStina.
While the Americans had a
certain reverence towards
each other and their music,
the French took a less serious
attitude; making noises, jum
ping up and down and audib
ly chee/itTg oil "froth them
selves and the audience.
The quartet's first number
was a playful questiorvand-an
swer blues selection during
which Mann appeared to be a
nice old guy who was just
starting to lose his stuff. The
second number proved that
appearences are quite deceiv
ing. Suddenly Mann launched
himself into one of three blis
tering solos as the band
worked its way through Boi
ling's "California Suite."
Mann brillantly injected syn
copated rhythms into Boi
ling's classic phrasing, at
times seeming almost poly

rhythmic.
I sensed a change in the
crowds attitude after each
movement of the suite. It
seemed that Boiling's first
numbers had prepared them
for his abrupt style and now
they were becoming cap
tivated, almost entranced by
his impish maneuvers.The
third movement, which was
almost all Boiling, was fol
lowed by truly heartfelt ap
plause and it seemed that Boi
ling was turning the mood of
the afternoon from one of
static disassociation to sur
ging life.
The "California Suite" was
followed by the "Green Dol
phin Street Improv" which
again showcased LeStina's
remarkable talent on the bass,
and two of Mann's own com
positions. The first of these
was Sir Charles Duke, a slow,
though not quite melancholy,
piece that contained a consis
tently low, seductive flute
part, with Boiling arpeggiat
ing over the top of it. It
seemed that Boiling's only
flaw during the concert was
the over-arpeggiation of this
and Mann's second number
"Jazz Dancing." Mann's
studio versions of these songs

are quite beefy and it seemed
that Boiling was over
compensating for the lack of
instrumentation on these
tunes.
At the conclusion of "Jazz
Dancing," Boiling and com
pany bolted the stage before
the applause had a chance to
wane, which was extremely
fast, because as soon as they
hit the last note there was a
mad dash for the rest rooms
and the snack tables. Never
have I seen so much flab
move so fast. It was truly
breathtaking.
Boiling started the second
portion of the concert with
some spectacular solo playing
of classic American ragtime.
He played his versions of
"The Entertainer" and"The
Maple Leaf Rag" followed by a
number dedicated to Fats
Waller which he called "Fatty
Fats." In many of these tunes
he worked in familar folk
themes done in a blues style
like "Yankee Doodle." He
caps his solo performance
with a Janis Johnson song
called "Carolina Shout"
during which he perpetually
bopped up and down to the
beat.
The band with Herbie Mann
then came back on stage and
help Boiling ignite the audi
ence with the Earl Heniz'
composition "Boogie
Woogie." Although the audi
ence applauded furiously, not
one rose to his feet, probably
only because they knew the
best was yet to come.
There was a sudden hush as
Boiling approached the
microphone to annouce the

next number. The anticipa
tion was there and Boiling
capitalized on it by drawing
the mornent out as long as
possible. "We would now like
to play a piece which I re
corded with Jean Pierre Ram
pal .. . ." It was of course Boi
ling's most famous work, "A
Suite for Flute," the one
which brought his music to
the United States. Suddenly
Boiling ran off stage leaving a
confused, garbled trail of
syllables behind him. It seems
that he needed the assistance
of the written music, and he
had left it off-stage. Mann and
the others played "Tea for
Two" during his brief absence
which sent ripples of laughter
though the crowd. "The
Suite" was interpreted beauti
fully by Mann who was able to
give it his own flare while
staying true to the original
score.
At the end of the show, the
audience finally rose to its
feet cheering Boiling on for
two encores. The afternoon
with Claude Boliing and
Herbie Mann was a triumph
for both artists no doubt, with
each contributing to the final
animation of a draining and
pretentious audience;
however some real credit
must go to the sound man
running the boards. Never
before have I seen people
thank the sound man upon
leaving a concert, but his
praisewas well deserved.
In all it was a delightful ex
perience with Boiling direct
ing a spectacular potpourri of
sound that was quite like a
picnic.

lept into his first number "We
Love You All Madly" with un-

serious-minded audience
somewhat on edge. During
the course of the piece Boi
ling and his band demon
strated both technical
prowess and fluid musical
phrasing successfully making
a connection between
"classical" development and
a smooth jazz/blues style.
After briefly acknowledging
the rather meager applause
with a nod of his head, Boi
ling began the second num
ber "Allez Francais." Imagine

Johannes Sebastian Bach
playing for beers in a New Or

blues-baroque combination
would almost certainly sound

part, with Boiling arpeggiat
ing over the top of it. It
seemed that Boiling's only
flaw during the concert was
the over-arpeggiation of this
and Mann's second number
"Jazz Dancing." Mann's
studio versions of these songs

are quite beefy and it seemed
that Boiling was over
compensating for the lack of
instrumentation on these
tunes.
At the conclusion of "Jazz
Dancing," Boiling and com
pany bolted the stage before
the applause had a chance to
wane, which was extremely
fast, because as soon as they
hit the last note there was a
mad dash for the rest rooms
and the snack tables. Never
have I seen so much flab
move so fast. It was truly
breathtaking.
Boiling started the second
portion of the concert with
some spectacular solo playing
of classic American ragtime.
He played his versions of
"The Entertainer" and"The
Maple Leaf Rag" followed by a
number dedicated to Fats
Waller which he called "Fatty
Fats." In many of these tunes
he worked in familar folk
themes done in a blues style
like "Yankee Doodle." He
caps his solo performance
with a Janis Johnson song
called "Carolina Shout"
during which he perpetually
bopped up and down to the
beat.
The band with Herbie Mann
then came back on stage and
help Boiling ignite the audi
ence with the Earl Heniz'
composition "Boogie
Woogie." Although the audi
ence applauded furiously, not
one rose to his feet, probably
only because they knew the
best was yet to come.
There was a sudden hush as
Boiling approached the
microphone to annouce the

next number. The anticipa
tion was there and Boiling
capitalized on it by drawing
the mornent out as long as
possible. "We would now like
to play a piece which I re
corded with Jean Pierre Ram
pal .. . ." It was of course Boi
ling's most famous work, "A
Suite for Flute," the one
which brought his music to
the United States. Suddenly
Boiling ran off stage leaving a
confused, garbled trail of
syllables behind him. It seems
that he needed the assistance
of the written music, and he
had left it off-stage. Mann and
the others played "Tea for
Two" during his brief absence
which sent ripples of laughter
though the crowd. "The
Suite" was interpreted beauti
fully by Mann who was able to
give it his own flare while
staying true to the original
score.
At the end of the show, the
audience finally rose to its
feet cheering Boiling on for
two encores. The afternoon
with Claude Boliing and
Herbie Mann was a triumph
for both artists no doubt, with
each contributing to the final
animation of a draining and
pretentious audience;
however some real credit
must go to the sound man
running the boards. Never
before have I seen people
thank the sound man upon
leaving a concert, but his
praisewas well deserved.
In all it was a delightful ex
perience with Boiling direct
ing a spectacular potpourri of
sound that was quite like a
picnic.

| As what could only be des
cribed as a "hoity-toity" Palo
Alto crowd waited patiently in
phe midafternoon sun for the
Besser among them to enter
■he infamous Memorial
Auditorium, I had to ask
■nyself, "Hey I know Claude
Boiling is great on his
'records, but will he really be
Bible to bring his music to life
|n one of the poorest acoustic
fcettings in the state (Mem
lAud), and for the most pom
fjpous and apathetic audience
In the entire world?"
|{ As the question ran through
ftny mind again and again, I
ffisurveyed the crowd to see if
|my assumptions about them
correct. Indeed they
■were "hoity-toity." Bantering
■about with cheap California
Swine in "elegant" plastic
Ilcups, eating their Mrs. Fields
' cookies and talking about the
great Northern California life,
they were enough to make
lany self-respecting New
Yorker ill.
The only exceptions of
Icourse were the few students
who attended and some
professors who realized that
their only function that after
noon was to add prestige to
the rather unconventional
concert. As both my com
patriot and I noted this was an
unprecedented concert.
Never before has Lively Arts at
I Stanford sponsored an artist
[ with the mass appeal of Bol
| ling. It seemed almost out of
I their realm and the crowd
[ knew it.
I decided that the crowd
I was out to get Boiling. After
I all he was French, or at least
not of this land, and really
! had no right to such niceties
i as an open-minded, attentive
audience. I also decided that I
had better find my seat since
it was now 2:25 and if I did not
get in before those of higher
social status I would be ex-
I eluded entirely.
As the lights dimmed I ex
| pected someone to come out
| and introduce Mr. Boiling as
| is the commom practice at
these events. I was half
shocked, half-amused to find
the band coming on stage
•without an introduction fol
lowed by a jovial yet deter
mined looking Boiling' who
lept into his first number "We
Love You All Madly" with un-
I usual fervor setting the
serious-minded audience
somewhat on edge. During
the course of the piece Boi
ling and his band demon
strated both technical
prowess and fluid musical
phrasing successfully making
a connection between
"classical" development and
a smooth jazz/blues style.
After briefly acknowledging
the rather meager applause
with a nod of his head, Boi
ling began the second num
ber "Allez Francais." Imagine

Johannes Sebastian Bach
playing for beers in a New Or
leans cafe. The resulting
blues-baroque combination
would almost certainly sound
like a rendition of "Allez Fran
cais." The audience was
stirred by this unique
mixture, but seemed to over
look the player most worthy
of attention on the number,
Steve LeStina.
The number showcased
some of LeStina's "hottest
chops," with him traveling
the length of the bass' neck
in record time. LeStina was
later introduced by Boiling as
a "new friend," but he played
as if he and Boiling were
childhood buddies. LeStina
served thoughout the concert
as the heart of the group
around which Boiling and
Mann worked their magic.
Surprisingly, drummer Jean
Claude Dayan was very uni
mpressive although com
petent. Sometimes he would
look bored or distracted and a
number of times he unabas
hedly glared at the audience,
as if trying to see what real
Californians looked like. FHe
seemed to play very much the
part of Richard Starky and I
was certain that before the
show was over he would be
singing "Octopus' Garden."
At the conclusion of "Allez
Francais" there was a warm
though guarded applause
after which Boiling intro
duced himself and his
"orchestra." Appropriately
he referred to LeStina as "the
string section," and then in
troduced his featured guest
soloist — flutist Herbie Mann.
While Boiling and his band
wore mostly white with light
pastels, Mann donned a blue
velvet sport coat, assuming
the stage as if it were Boiling
who was the featured guest
soloist.
After Mann's appearance I
realized a stark contrast be
tween the attitudes of the two
French musicians- Bollingand
Dayan — and that of the two
Americans-Mann and LeStina.
While the Americans had a
certain reverence towards
each other and their music,
the French took a less serious
attitude; making noises, jum
ping up and down and audib
ly chee/itTg oil "froth them
selves and the audience.
The quartet's first number
was a playful questiorvand-an
swer blues selection during
which Mann appeared to be a
nice old guy who was just
starting to lose his stuff. The
second number proved that
appearences are quite deceiv
ing. Suddenly Mann launched
himself into one of three blis
tering solos as the band
worked its way through Boi
ling's "California Suite."
Mann brillantly injected syn
copated rhythms into Boi
ling's classic phrasing, at
times seeming almost poly

rhythmic.
I sensed a change in the
crowds attitude after each
movement of the suite. It
seemed that Boiling's first
numbers had prepared them
for his abrupt style and now
they were becoming cap
tivated, almost entranced by
his impish maneuvers.The
third movement, which was
almost all Boiling, was fol
lowed by truly heartfelt ap
plause and it seemed that Boi
ling was turning the mood of
the afternoon from one of
static disassociation to sur
ging life.
The "California Suite" was
followed by the "Green Dol
phin Street Improv" which
again showcased LeStina's
remarkable talent on the bass,
and two of Mann's own com
positions. The first of these
was Sir Charles Duke, a slow,
though not quite melancholy,
piece that contained a consis
tently low, seductive flute
part, with Boiling arpeggiat
ing over the top of it. It
seemed that Boiling's only
flaw during the concert was
the over-arpeggiation of this
and Mann's second number
"Jazz Dancing." Mann's
studio versions of these songs

are quite beefy and it seemed
that Boiling was over
