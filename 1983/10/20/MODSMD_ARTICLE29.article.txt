# The 						Motels' 'Little Robbers': and yet another winning effort
## 
### TRACIE LINDEMAN 
The Motels have done it again. Little Rob
bers, the group s fourth and most recent
album, is just as good as anything they have
released so far.
Martha Davis, lead singer and primary
songwriter for The Motels, is the focal point
of the album, as she was for the first three
albums, Through her lyrics, Davis manages
to turn observations of everyday life into
striking images.
In "Where Do We Go From Here,' the
first song on the album, Davis shows the
listener wildly inappropriate scenes as a
means of illustrating a society gone wrong.
"Brothel filled with men of the cloth/The
child whose dreams are terrorist screams."
The great thing about Martha Davis is the
fact that although she can write pretty
serious stuff, she can still have a good time.
The title track of the album, for example,
has no deep inner meaning, but Davis has
fun playing with rhymes, and the song has a
wicked pop hook that keeps vou humming
it for davs.
In addition to her songwriting, Davis
voice is, as usual, tantastic. The onlv disap
pointment is that there isn't a song on Little
Robbers that showcases Davis' voice the
way that "Mission of Mercy" did on The
Motels' third album, All Four One.
"Mission of Mercy" gave Davis a chance
to really belt one out, utilizing her entire
range. Her voice sounds great on Little Rob
bers, but after listening to the album, one is
left wishing that Davis had let loose a little
more.
The Motels have added another member
since All Four One. Scott Thurston is now
handling additional keyboard and guitar
duties. The rest of the band remains the
same, and the overall sound of the album is
not much different from previous releases.
Aside from Davis, probably the most in
fluential member is Marty Jourard, who

plavs keyboards and sax. The saxophone is
the perfect complement and counterpoint
to Davis' voice, and is therefore a crucial
instrument in The Motels' sound, jourard
plays a mean sax, inflecting just the right
amount of sass and petulance to do Davis'
voice justice.
The rest of the members of The Motels
are good musicians, and provide a solid
framework for Davis and jourard.
Little Robbers was produced by Val Garay,
as was All Four One. The first two albums,
The Motels and Careful were not produced
by Garay, but there has not been much of a
change in The Motels' sound over the
years, so one has to believe that the group
retains creative control for the most part.
Little Robbers has a lot to offer, both for
the The Motels devotee, as well as someone
who is not familiar with the group's previ
ous work. One can tell by listening to the
album that The Motels have a professional
attitude toward their music, but it sounds
like the group has fun working together:
1 he allium is not so polished that it loses its
vitality.
The Vlotels collaborate with other people
in rock and roll; "Into the Heartland" on
side two of Little Robbers was co-written by
Martha Davis and Bernie Taupin. The lyrics
are reminiscent of Taupin's early work with
Elton john, and the music has a driving beat
which is very appropriate.
Davis also collaborated with the Tubes on
their most recent album, singing a duet
with Fee Waybill. This move toward col
laboration is a logical one since The Motels
have established their sound pretty well.
Working with other people could be a way
for them to keep their work sounding fresh
without changing the things which work so
well.
All in all, Little Robbers is fun to listen to,
and a good example of what The Motels can
do.
