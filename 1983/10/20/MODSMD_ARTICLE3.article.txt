# Election fills ASSU Graduate Senate seats
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff Writer 
After a special election held Tues
day and yesterday, the six ASSU
Graduate Senate seats which were
left vacant after last spring's ASSU
election have finally been filled,
ASSU Election Commissioner
Brian Mariscal said last night.
The six seats were left unfilled
after last spring's annual ASSU elc
tion when there were fewer can
didates than seats available. A
seventh opening became available
last week when a senator from the
School of Engineering resigned,
Senate Chair Jug Jagadish said.
Mary Kay Clinton, first-year
School of Engineering student, and
Sharon Kinney, a write-in from the
School of Education, were elected
with full voting privileges.
Lov Crover, Pardner Wynn and
Daniel Lerner, each from the
School of Engineering, and Paul
Lewis, a write-in candidate from the
School of Medicine, were elected
as alternates.
One seat in the School of Educa
tion remained vacant as of last night
because the leading candidate is a
write-in who never formally
declared his candidacy, Mariscal
said. He said that the person would
be notified sometime tomorrow
and that the seat is likely to be
filled.
Mariscal said the turnout in the
School of Engineering was "very

good," noting that 190 people
voted. Clinton received 108 votes,
while Grover got 59, Wynn 58 and
Lerner 50.
"The other schools didn't have
that same interest," Mariscal said,
noting that Lewis needed won with
only 11 votes and Kinney with only
five.
Clinton, first notified of her vic
tory by The Daily, said she was
"very pleased" with the results. She
said she plans initially to investigate
an alleged shortage of graduate
housing and parking. She said she
hopes to "facilitate communication
between senators and my con
stituency, because I'm representing
the views of somebody else, not
just myself."
Clinton said that she gained ex
perience in student government as
an undergraduate at Texas A & M (
and that her interest has continued
at Stanford.
The senate will meet next Tues
day to validate the election. The
elected candidates will be invited to
take part in the proceedings to gain
experience in ASSU affairs, said Jim
McGrath, chair of the graduate edu
cation and research committee.
The candidates will be officially
certified as senators two weeks later
in another senate meeting,
jugadish said. At this meeting, the
newly elected members will be eli
gible to vote for the first time, he
said.
