# Moody Blues lose the magic
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Don't you just love those
great old Moody Blues record
titles — Days of Future Passed,
In Search of the Lost Chord,
On the Threshold of a Dream.
They really evoked a type of
psychic revelation and listen
ing to their music has always
been an experience for the
mind to behold — rich or
chestrations, cosmic sound
effects, lush lyrics and
heavenly harmonies all
combined to enhance a rock
backbeat.
The band singlehandedly
must have doubled the LSD
consumption rate during
their classic period in the late
19605. The band continued in
termittently through the
19705, but by the start of the
'80s, they looked finished.
However, a 1981 album, Long
Distance Voyager, was a well
crafted album in the tradition
al Moody Blues vein that
surprisingly went to No. 1 on
the charts.
Their new album though is,
simplistically, entitled The
Present. Now all you Moody
Blues diehards may argue the
double meaning of the title by
stating that the album is a
"present" or that the music
on the album is what the band
is making in the "present."
However, whichever way you
want to argue it, the album it
self is quite weak, overindul
gent and lifeless. This album
is no bargain, let alone a
"present." Furthermore, if
this is the music we can ex
pect from the Moodies in the
"present," then I think I'll
just dust off and play their
records of the past.
To begin with, the Moodies
have forgotten that you first
have to write some adequate
songs before recording. Neat
sound effects and spacy em
bellishments do not an album
make. Yet on The Present, the
Moodies have tried just that.
What was once an innovative
and musically stimulating
form of music is now a stale,
contrived and overblown
mass of sound.
No longer is musical quality
a factor as it was in the past.
On The Present, mediocrity is
all that is striven for. The
Moodies try to compensate
for what the songs lack by ad
ding some feeble synthesizer
fills.
To a listener who has lis
tened in wonder to such
Moody Blues classics as
"Nights in White Satin" and
"Legend of a Mind", this al
bum will easily be seen as an
inferior product. The wool
will not be thrown over the

sheep's eyes in this instance.
To further emphasize the
debilitated state to which the
Moody Blues' music has fal
len, one need only listen to
the single from the album. En
titled "Sitting at the Wheel,"
it is achieving quite good
airplay. However, it is pos
sibly one of the worst at
tempts at rock (or even pop)
done by a major band.
Take away the song's syn
thesizer track and you're left
with an awkward, redundant
drum beat with a minimal
use of any other musical ac
companiment. Yet, the public
will buy it and put it in the up
per reaches of the charts, not
because of its musical worth,
but because it is the Moody
Blues.
In addition, the album con
tains other weaknesses that
may signify the end of the

Moodies as an interesting and
vital musical source. Previ
ously, the lyrical content of
the Moody Blues songs were
filled with sumptuous visions
and insightful philosophies
on life. Such lyrical master
pieces as "Tuesday After
noon" and "Eyes of a Child"
created a beautiful musical
environment in which to
develop a song. On The Pres
ent the lyrics are devoid of life
and spirit. There is even a
song which accurately
describes the state of their
lyrics; the song is titled
"Going Nowhere."
Finally, the band has also
forgotten that it is a rock
band; perhaps the finest "art
rock" band at one point in
their career. This band used
to merge orchestrations with
all-out rock tunes to create
fabulous records. Such rock

ers as "Ride My See-Saw",
"Question," and "I'm Just a
Singer in a Rock and Roll
Band" all elucidate that the
Moody Blues could rock with
its musical contemporaries.
The Present contains not
even the mildest notion of
rock and roll. All the attempts
at up-tempo rock such as
"Under My Feet" and the
aforementioned "sitting at the
Wheel" fail dramatically.
Only on the album's opening
track, "Blue World" does a
well balanced and sincere
rock song come forth. In fact,
this is the only track on the
album that comes close to
what the Moody Blues were
once capable of doing. It cer
tainly is a "blue world" when
this is all that the Moody
Blues can produce. I hate to
admit it, but I think their
search for the lost chord has
been terminated.

for what the songs lack by ad
ding some feeble synthesizer
fills.
To a listener who has lis
tened in wonder to such
Moody Blues classics as
"Nights in White Satin" and
"Legend of a Mind", this al
bum will easily be seen as an
inferior product. The wool
will not be thrown over the

sheep's eyes in this instance.
To further emphasize the
debilitated state to which the
Moody Blues' music has fal
len, one need only listen to
the single from the album. En
titled "Sitting at the Wheel,"
it is achieving quite good
airplay. However, it is pos
sibly one of the worst at
tempts at rock (or even pop)
done by a major band.
Take away the song's syn
thesizer track and you're left
with an awkward, redundant
drum beat with a minimal
use of any other musical ac
companiment. Yet, the public
will buy it and put it in the up
per reaches of the charts, not
because of its musical worth,
but because it is the Moody
Blues.
In addition, the album con
tains other weaknesses that
may signify the end of the

Moodies as an interesting and
vital musical source. Previ
ously, the lyrical content of
the Moody Blues songs were
filled with sumptuous visions
and insightful philosophies
on life. Such lyrical master
pieces as "Tuesday After
noon" and "Eyes of a Child"
created a beautiful musical
environment in which to
develop a song. On The Pres
ent the lyrics are devoid of life
and spirit. There is even a
song which accurately
describes the state of their
lyrics; the song is titled
"Going Nowhere."
Finally, the band has also
forgotten that it is a rock
band; perhaps the finest "art
rock" band at one point in
their career. This band used
to merge orchestrations with
all-out rock tunes to create
fabulous records. Such rock

ers as "Ride My See-Saw",
"Question," and "I'm Just a
Singer in a Rock and Roll
Band" all elucidate that the
Moody Blues could rock with
its musical contemporaries.
The Present contains not
even the mildest notion of
rock and roll. All the attempts
at up-tempo rock such as
"Under My Feet" and the
aforementioned "sitting at the
Wheel" fail dramatically.
Only on the album's opening
track, "Blue World" does a
well balanced and sincere
rock song come forth. In fact,
this is the only track on the
album that comes close to
what the Moody Blues were
once capable of doing. It cer
tainly is a "blue world" when
this is all that the Moody
Blues can produce. I hate to
admit it, but I think their
search for the lost chord has
been terminated.

Don't you just love those
great old Moody Blues record
titles — Days of Future Passed,
In Search of the Lost Chord,
On the Threshold of a Dream.
They really evoked a type of
psychic revelation and listen
ing to their music has always
been an experience for the
mind to behold — rich or
chestrations, cosmic sound
effects, lush lyrics and
heavenly harmonies all
combined to enhance a rock
backbeat.
The band singlehandedly
must have doubled the LSD
consumption rate during
their classic period in the late
19605. The band continued in
termittently through the
19705, but by the start of the
'80s, they looked finished.
However, a 1981 album, Long
Distance Voyager, was a well
crafted album in the tradition
al Moody Blues vein that
surprisingly went to No. 1 on
the charts.
Their new album though is,
simplistically, entitled The
Present. Now all you Moody
Blues diehards may argue the
double meaning of the title by
stating that the album is a
"present" or that the music
on the album is what the band
is making in the "present."
However, whichever way you
want to argue it, the album it
self is quite weak, overindul
gent and lifeless. This album
is no bargain, let alone a
"present." Furthermore, if
this is the music we can ex
pect from the Moodies in the
"present," then I think I'll
just dust off and play their
records of the past.
To begin with, the Moodies
have forgotten that you first
have to write some adequate
songs before recording. Neat
sound effects and spacy em
bellishments do not an album
make. Yet on The Present, the
Moodies have tried just that.
What was once an innovative
and musically stimulating
form of music is now a stale,
contrived and overblown
mass of sound.
No longer is musical quality
a factor as it was in the past.
On The Present, mediocrity is
all that is striven for. The
Moodies try to compensate
for what the songs lack by ad
ding some feeble synthesizer
fills.
