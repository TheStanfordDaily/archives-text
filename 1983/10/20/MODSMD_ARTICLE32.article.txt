Watching You
Every drink you take, every Briefly
you make, every Happy Hour title
you fake, every vanilla-with-rum
shake, Res Ed's watching you. Every
edit that's great, every Sherry Hour
date, every trip around the lake,
every Henry's bottle you break, Res
Ed's watching you. Oh, can't you

see, there's a Friday at Three
(actually at five: poetic license).
Also
Jaba and EEEEEEEid vow to avenge
The Chief's smoking habits at that
Friday at Five. As they say, she will
be shot with her own gun.
