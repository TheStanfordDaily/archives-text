# PA city attorney averts campaign sign dispute
## 
### SAM DELSON 
Palo Alto City Attorney Diane
Lee averted a legal confrontation
with City Council candidate Cas
sandra Moore Monday by
suspending efforts to force
Moore to take down 24 of her
campaign signs.
The elimination ot the sign
dispute returned the council
campaign to an emphasis on is
sues concerning the city's future
growth.
Moore hailed the decision as
"a victory for the first amend
ment rather than a victory for the
Moore campaign." She added
that the sign dispute had
obscured "the other substantive
issues of my campaign â€” such as
affordable housing, closing of
neighborhood businesses and
cable TV."
Lee's decision came after al
most three weeks of legal spar
ring between Moore and the
city. The candidate had hired a
professional sign firm to hang
several hundred of her posters
around Palo Alto, and the city
had contended that 24 of them
were illegally placed on public
property in residential neighbor
hoods.
The city began efforts to force
removal of the signs Sept. 28, but
Moore challenged the con

stitutionality of the anti-sign or
dinance and won a temporary
restraining order Oct. 8 which
allowed her to keep the posters
in position until a hearing,
which has been scheduled for
Tuesday.
The hearing was canceled
when Lee announced that the
city would allow the signs to
remain until the U.S. Supreme
Court renders a decision in Vin
cent vs. Los Angeles, a case that
involves a similar election sign
ordinance.
Lee said she decided to
suspend prosecution because
she thought it unlikely that the
city would be able to force
removal of the signs before the
Nov. 8 council election. "Our
best bet is to wait for the Vincent
decision," she said.
The Supreme Court heard
arguments in the case last Wed
nesday, and is expected to make
a ruling within the next three
months.
Although several of the other
12 candidates had said Moore's
legal battle with the city was hur
ting her campaign, most were
relieved that the sign issue
would no longer dominate the
news coverage of the election.
Appearing together at a neigh
borhood forum Tuesday night,

12 of the candidates spoke al
most entirely about growth is
sues.
Only one candidate, Planning
Commissioner Jack Sutoris,
spoke of the sign issue. Without
referring directly to Moore,
Sutoris said he would limit his

posters to "very few signs,
spread by volunteers on private
property." He added that he
preferred to "spread a little
beauty" by passing out
wildflower seeds to voters.
Sutorius had been critical of


VITAL SIGN: Campaign signs for Palo Alto City Council hopeful
Cassandra Moore have stirred up a controversy that won't be com
pletely settled until the U.S. Supreme Court decides on a similar
case.
Moore's actions, contending that
she should not have challenged the
city.
Most of the candidates confined
their speeches Tuesday to calls for
more restrictive zoning measures
aimed at preserving residential
neighborhoods and limiting devel
opment of new buildings on Cali
fornia and University avenues.
The zoning issue has grown out
of more than 20 years of political
disputes over the city's growth rate.
In 1962, pro-growth and anti
development groups fought over
whether to build the Oregon Ex
pressway, and the project was only
narrowly approved in a city referen
dum.
In the late '60s, the groups favor
ing limits on development became
known as "residentialists," and in
1971 they won a narrow majority in
the City Council.
The residentialists passed a num
ber of strict zoning restrictions in
the early '70s, including a 50-foot
height limit on commercial build
ings and a 35-foot limit on residen
tial construction.
Although pro-growth forces won
a narrow majority in 1975, they
failed to change the new restric
tions.
But despite the laws aimed at

limiting growth, Palo Alto has had
$287 million in commercial con
struction during the last five years,
according to candidate Bob Moss.
Two million square feet of industri
al and office space have been added
in the last two years, Moss said.
Housing construction has failed
to keep pace with commercial
growth, however, and only 669 resi
dential units have been built since
1977 while over 5500 new jobs have
been created during the same per
iod, Moss added.
Planning Commissioner Pat Cul
len, another candidate, noted that,
despite the boom in office con
struction, current regulations per
mit even more growth in years to
come. She said University Avenue is
built to only 40 percent of its legal
potential, and California Avenue
has only 30 percent of the permissi
ble commercial space.
Cullen called for new restrictions
to prevent further development of

those area 6.
Almost all of this year's can
didates support what used to be
known as the residentialist posi
tion, differing primarily on the
degree of restrictions that should
be placed on growth. The residen
tial height limit was reduced to 30
feet earlier this year, and the City
Council adopted a moratorium on
construction of new buildings on
California Avenue Monday night.
Several candidates expressed
support for adding traffic barriers
to many residential neighbor
hoods, and others have suggested
creative zoning techniques to
preserve neighborhoods such as
College Terrace.
The only candidate to speak
against further growth restrictions
was Moore, who said she is
"appalled by the undercurrent of
timidity and unreasoning illogical
fear" of growth exhibited by her
opponents.
