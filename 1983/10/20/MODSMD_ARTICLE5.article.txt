# PA city attorney averts campaign sign dispute
## 
### SAM DELSON 
Palo Alto City Attorney Diane
Lee averted a legal confrontation
with City Council candidate Cas
sandra Moore Monday by
suspending efforts to force
Moore to take down 24 of her
campaign signs.
The elimination ot the sign
dispute returned the council
campaign to an emphasis on is
sues concerning the city's future
growth.
Moore hailed the decision as
"a victory for the first amend
ment rather than a victory for the
Moore campaign." She added
that the sign dispute had
obscured "the other substantive
issues of my campaign â€” such as
affordable housing, closing of
neighborhood businesses and
cable TV."
Lee's decision came after al
most three weeks of legal spar
ring between Moore and the
city. The candidate had hired a
professional sign firm to hang
several hundred of her posters
around Palo Alto, and the city
had contended that 24 of them
were illegally placed on public
property in residential neighbor
hoods.
The city began efforts to force
removal of the signs Sept. 28, but
Moore challenged the con

stitutionality of the anti-sign or
dinance and won a temporary
restraining order Oct. 8 which
allowed her to keep the posters
in position until a hearing,
which has been scheduled for
Tuesday.
The hearing was canceled
when Lee announced that the
city would allow the signs to
remain until the U.S. Supreme
Court renders a decision in Vin
cent vs. Los Angeles, a case that
involves a similar election sign
ordinance.
Lee said she decided to
suspend prosecution because
she thought it unlikely that the
city would be able to force
removal of the signs before the
Nov. 8 council election. "Our
best bet is to wait for the Vincent
decision," she said.
The Supreme Court heard
arguments in the case last Wed
nesday, and is expected to make
a ruling within the next three
months.
Although several of the other
12 candidates had said Moore's
legal battle with the city was hur
ting her campaign, most were
relieved that the sign issue
would no longer dominate the
news coverage of the election.
Appearing together at a neigh
borhood forum Tuesday night,

12 of the candidates spoke al
most entirely about growth is
sues.
Only one candidate, Planning
Commissioner Jack Sutoris,
spoke of the sign issue. Without
referring directly to Moore,
Sutoris said he would limit his

posters to "very few signs,
spread by volunteers on private
property." He added that he
preferred to "spread a little
beauty" by passing out
wildflower seeds to voters.
Sutorius had been critical of


VITAL SIGN: Campaign signs for Palo Alto City Council hopeful
Cassandra Moore have stirred up a controversy that won't be com
pletely settled until the U.S. Supreme Court decides on a similar
case.
