# Self-operated houses angry over room rate hikes
## 
### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer 
Representatives of a number of self-operated
houses last night aired their complaints at a
meeting of the Inter-Fraternity Council, object
ing to the fact that their room rates have risen
substantially more than rates for residents of
University-operated housing.
The meeting gave fraternities, which com
prise the majority of self-ops on campus, a
chance to discuss their grievances with Linda
Mclntyre, a financial analyst for Facilities and
Services. A review of housing rates which she
directed last year resulted in this year's rate in
creases.
Many students, especially those who live in
self-ops, are upset by the dramatic increase in
room rates. While rates for University-operated
residences rose 14.5 percent over last year,
rates for self-ops rose 19.1 percent. And this
occurred at a time when inflation was down
and the economy was on the upswing, and reg

ular tuition did not go up that much, according
to Delta Upsilon president Luke Cole.
The rate increases which have angered Cole
and other residents of self-ops are the result of
a review of housing rates conducted last year
by a task group of students and administrators.
According to Mclntyre, various factors, includ
ing the new Governor's Corner housing and
the reduced occupancy in Manzanita Park,
made it necessary to review the rate structure
forall University housing.
Norm Robinson, dean of Residential Educa
tion, said periodic reviews of housing rates are
normal University procedure. Although the
new housing was not the driving force behind
the review, he said, it was the reason for the
increase in costs. "Clearly, that (the new
housing) has an etfect on rents all across the
board," he said.
Under Res. Ed. policy, room rates should not
reflect differences in amenities, degree of
desirability, number of occupants of the rooms

or differences in the cost of maintaining the
basic facility. Differences in rates based on
such factors would create "enclaves for the
wealthy," Robinson said.
As a result of this policy, the task group main
tained that charges for the basic room ac
comodation — room, bath and the use of some
type of common area — should not vary from one
residence to another. However, room rates
may differ because facilities differ in service or
programming provided by the University and
some houses have kitchen and dining facilities
and others do not.
Consequently, although room rates at self
ops do not include the cost of regular Univer
sity custodial and maintenance service because
these tasks are performed by the residents
themselves, rates do include a charge for their
kitchen and dining facilities.
For residents of University-operated
housing, the comparable charge for maintain
ing food service facilities is included in their
board plans for University Food Service.
