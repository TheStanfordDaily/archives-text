Reagan defends defense system
Washington — President Reagan said last night that
the cost of a plan to build a space-based missile
defense system has been greatly exaggerated and
defended his interest in the system by saying that if
nations build defensive systems, "then nobody's
going to start a war."
Administration sources have said Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger has recommended to
Reagan that the United States develop a system that
would cost $18 billion to $27 billion over the next
five years.
Reagan last March asked for a plan to advance
U.S. defensive capabilities. The Pentagon has said

the proposal has been sent to the White House.
The president said at a news conference that he
had not seen the report.
But, he said, referring to news reports about it,"I
am fascinated with reading all about it . . . and I can
tell you that no one has suggested any such figure
in the billions of dollars that have been proposed."
However, the figure was in one of the four op
tions prepared for Reagan, according to administra
tion sources who spoke on the condition that they
not be identified by name.
The recommendations were reached after
months of scientific study and policy analysis stem
ming from the president's speech on arms control
on March 23. In that address, he called for a study
of a space-based military concept.

Senate approves King holiday
Washington —With Martin Luther King's family and
civil-rights compatriots looking on from the
visitors' gallery, the Senate gave final approval yes
terday to a bitterly contested bill creating a national
holiday in King's memory.
By a vote of 78-22, the measure, which has already
passed the House, was sent to President Reagan,
who has promised to sign it. It would designate the
third Monday in January, beginning in 1986, as a
paid holiday honoring the slain civil-rights leader.
After the Senate roll call, King's widow, Coretta
Scott King, declared that it was "a great day for
America and the world." Joseph Lowery, who now
heads the Southern Christian Leadership Confer
ence that King founded, said that passage of the bill
was a call for "a new beginning to feed the hungry,

house those who are outdoors, clothe the naked
and let justice roll down like water."
Opponents of the bill — 18 Republicans and four
Democrats — mainly expressed concern about the
cost of a new paid holiday, and there were strong
indications that Congress would move quickly to
possibly reduce the total number of holidays or to
let some of the Monday holidays — including the one
honoring King — occasionally fall on weekends. With
the addition of the day honoring King, there will be
a total of 10 federal holidays.
Some critics, notably Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.),
deemed King as being unworthy of the highest
honor the government can bestow. Helms kept up
his relentless attacks on King yesterday and tried to
the end to torpedo the legislation with amend
ments. One rider, rejected 92-5, called on Reagan
to grant a pardon to Marcus Garvey, a back-to-
Africa black nationalist in the 19205.
Helms assaults were countered by soaring bursts
of rhetoric extolling King as a man who, in the
words of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), "brought
us a fuller measure of justice than our nation had
ever known before."
At the same time, Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.)
delivered a startlingly caustic attack on Helms and
Sen. John East (R-N.C.), accusing them of "playing
up to Jim Crow."
Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) also was
critical of Helms in a speech in which she said,
"Unfortunately, the well of debate has been
poisoned by character assassination against Martin
Luther King."
Helms, who accused King of widespread commu
nist connections and, at a press conference yester
day, of womanizing, told reporters: "I'm not a
bigot, I'm not a racist."
Helms charged that the bill had been steamrol
lered by Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.) in an "atmosphere of intimidation." He
explained that senators were told that they faced
retaliation by black voters who would not vote for
them if they opposed the bill. But Helms, who faces
a tough re-election fight next year, said that he did
not expect any blacks to vote for him anyway.
Baker, who put the legislation on a fast track and
helped persuade Reagan to reverse his original op
position to it, concluded three days of debate by
recalling how struck he was by King's famous "I
Have a Dream" speech on the Washington Mall 20
years ago. He said the bill would "memorialize the
extraordinary progress we have made in race rela
tions and renew our commitment to expanding the
horizon of human freedom still more."
Lebanese talks postponed
Beirut — After a day of heavy fighting and a car
bomb explosion that injured four U.S. Marines, the
Lebanese government yesterday night announced
postponement of a national reconciliation confer
ence of leaders of the country's warring factions
that was to have opened today.
The postponement came after leaders of Druze
and other factions said they would not go to Beirut
International Airport, the designated site of the
proposed "national dialogue," because the area
still is unsafe.
The government of President Amin Gemayel said
it was still seeking ways to resolve the impasse over
the site of the conference, but it gave no indication
of when or where it would be held.

The setback came as artillery fire shook the
mountains east of Beirut and the predominantly
Shiite Moslem slum neighborhoods near the air
port in exchanges that lasted from early morning to
late afternoon.
The Marines were injured when a car bomb ex
ploded near the Kuwaiti Embassy not far from the
main road to the airport. Authorities said the bomb,
in an auto parked across from the Sabra and
Chatilla refugee camps, blew up after apparently
being detonated by radio. The injured Marines
were riding in a jeep, at the end of a four-vehicle
convoy, according to a Marine spokesman.
Maj. Robert Jordan described the wounds as
minor — largely superficial head and hand cuts and
damaged ear drums. He said a Palestinian man and
woman rushed out of the camps and helped the
injured Marines.
U.S. officials said they did not know which fac
tion set the bomb, but they said radical elements
intent on sabotaging the conference have
repeatedly attempted to scuttle the talks by trying
to engage the Marines against militias.
Prospects for holding a peace conference to draft
a new power-sharing formula for Lebanon and end
eight years of civil war had begun to dim when
Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, head of the Syrian
backed Progressive Socialist Party, announced ear
lier yesterday at a press conference in Mouktara in
the Shout mountains that he would boycott the
talks.
"It is very strange that Lebanese authorities ex
tended invitations to the conference before we had
even agreed on its location," jumblatt said. "We
must agree on the place first. It is not convenient
security-wise, especially because it has been bom
barded for two days."
Jumblatt, whose militia is in the mountains that
dominate the airport and is in a position to deter
mine whether the airport will function or not,
reiterated his proposal that the conference be held
either aboard a Greek ship in Lebanese waters or in
Tunisia.
Earlier, former prime minister Rashid Karami, one
of three leaders of the Syrian-backed National
Salvation Front, an anti-Gemayel group, said in
Tripoli that leaders of the front would not attend
the reconciliation meetings.
Shultz warns against aid cutoff
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz
warned House leaders yesterday that a vote to cut
off secret U.S. aid to rebels in Nicaragua would
"undermine the cause of peace and democracy"
and "virtually destroy" chances for a negotiated
settlement in the region.
"The administration policies to help bring peace
to Central America are now beginning to bear

fruit," Shultz said in a letter to House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) and Minority
Leader Robert Michel (R-lll.). "I urge the House not
to impose restrictions on this policy and thereby
undermine the cause of peace and democracy that
we all support."
The strongly worded letter was part of last-minute
maneuvering before today's debate on whether to
end covert aid to guerrilla groups attacking the lef
tist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The vote,
expected to be close, will be preceded by a rare
closed session of the full House to discuss classified
information about the "secret war" in Nicaragua.
Unlike the last closed session, which was called
by Reagan administration supporters to defend the
covert aid program there, this one was requested
by Rep. Edward Boland (D-Mass.), chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee and sponsor of the
amendment to cut off U.S. aid to the anti-Sandinista
rebels.
A Democratic staff aide said Boland would use
the closed session to "directly challenge the admin
istration on how the support program helps or
hinders regional negotiations" and to "stress how
U.S. objectives have changed and how the conflict
is deepening there with the concurrent greater risk
of pulling us in militarily."
The aide said congressmen also were likely to dis
cuss recent splits within the ranks of the U.S.-
backed rebels and the degree to which the
anti-Sandinista guerrilla groups respond to U.S. ef
forts to control them.
Israel opposes arms sales
Washington — Israel objects in principle to any sale
of U.S. weapons to hostile Arab nations, including
the sale of equipment to Jordan for use by an
American-trained brigade that would respond to
emergencies in the Persian Gulf, Israeli Ambassa
dor Meir Rosenne said yesterday.
Such weapons, Rosenne told the Los Angeles
Times, are "quite often used against us."
"We had this experience many times, and we saw
even during the war in Lebanon that weapons that
were given to Saudi Arabia were delivered after
wards to the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion)," he said.
Rosenne said that the Israelis "are discussing this
issue with the United States at this time" but would
not give details.
The Israeli envoy also would not comment on any
possible changes in U.S. Middle East policy that
may occur as Robert McFarlane takes over as Presi
dent Reagan's national security adviser. However,
Rosenne, who participated in the negotiations that
led to the 1979 Camp David accords, went out of his
way to praise the U.S. record in the region.
"Maybe we don't share 100 percent the percep

tion on the U.S. policy. I think that if there is one
superpower that did something to encourage the
peace process in the Middle East, it is the United
States," he said.
Tax bill to cut deficit
»
Washington — When Congress approved a federal
budget four months ago, it envisioned a lion of a
tax bill that would help eat into deficits by raising
$73 billion in new revenues over three years. But
the House Ways and Means Committee gave birth
yesterday to a tax bill that, to its critics, looked dis
tinctly more like a mouse.
The bill, which attracted the support of commit
tee Democrats and Republicans alike, would raise
about $8 billion over three years from a variety of
changes in the tax code. Explained committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-lll.), "We try to do
what's doable."
The possibility remains that a somewhat larger tax
bill will prove "doable." Rostenkowski himself
plans to seek the support of his committee
Democrats for a freeze of some tax cuts that are
scheduled to go into effect next year. If he gets it,
he will offer his proposal as an amendment to the
committee bill when it goes before the full House
next week.
Beyond that, some Democratic liberals and fresh
men are preparing an amendment that would raise
the full $73 billion, but that effort appears doomed
to failure in the House. And whatever proves accep
table in the House will have to clear the Republican
controlled Senate, which is well aware that
President Reagan opposes major tax increases of all
kinds.
Stocks fall again
New York — The stock market suffered another
broad decline in heavy trading yesterday, although
a late rebound helped narrow the losses.
Digital Equipment and many other computer
stocks again fell in the aftermath of Digital's
surprise announcement Tuesday that earnings were
well short of expectations for the quarter ended
Oct. 1.
Steel, auto, mining and forest-products issues
also declined.
Today's weather
Sunny except areas of low clouds and fog during
the morning. Highs in the 60s at the coast and the
70s inland. Afternoon winds to 20 mph.

Shultz warns against aid cutoff
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz
warned House leaders yesterday that a vote to cut
off secret U.S. aid to rebels in Nicaragua would
"undermine the cause of peace and democracy"
and "virtually destroy" chances for a negotiated
settlement in the region.
"The administration policies to help bring peace
to Central America are now beginning to bear

fruit," Shultz said in a letter to House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) and Minority
Leader Robert Michel (R-lll.). "I urge the House not
to impose restrictions on this policy and thereby
undermine the cause of peace and democracy that
we all support."
The strongly worded letter was part of last-minute
maneuvering before today's debate on whether to
end covert aid to guerrilla groups attacking the lef
tist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The vote,
expected to be close, will be preceded by a rare
closed session of the full House to discuss classified
information about the "secret war" in Nicaragua.
Unlike the last closed session, which was called
by Reagan administration supporters to defend the
covert aid program there, this one was requested
by Rep. Edward Boland (D-Mass.), chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee and sponsor of the
amendment to cut off U.S. aid to the anti-Sandinista
rebels.
A Democratic staff aide said Boland would use
the closed session to "directly challenge the admin
istration on how the support program helps or
hinders regional negotiations" and to "stress how
U.S. objectives have changed and how the conflict
is deepening there with the concurrent greater risk
of pulling us in militarily."
The aide said congressmen also were likely to dis
cuss recent splits within the ranks of the U.S.-
backed rebels and the degree to which the
anti-Sandinista guerrilla groups respond to U.S. ef
forts to control them.
Israel opposes arms sales
Washington — Israel objects in principle to any sale
of U.S. weapons to hostile Arab nations, including
the sale of equipment to Jordan for use by an
American-trained brigade that would respond to
emergencies in the Persian Gulf, Israeli Ambassa
dor Meir Rosenne said yesterday.
Such weapons, Rosenne told the Los Angeles
Times, are "quite often used against us."
"We had this experience many times, and we saw
even during the war in Lebanon that weapons that
were given to Saudi Arabia were delivered after
wards to the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion)," he said.
Rosenne said that the Israelis "are discussing this
issue with the United States at this time" but would
not give details.
The Israeli envoy also would not comment on any
possible changes in U.S. Middle East policy that
may occur as Robert McFarlane takes over as Presi
dent Reagan's national security adviser. However,
Rosenne, who participated in the negotiations that
led to the 1979 Camp David accords, went out of his
way to praise the U.S. record in the region.
"Maybe we don't share 100 percent the percep

superpower that did something to encourage the
peace process in the Middle East, it is the United
States," he said.
Tax bill to cut deficit
»
Washington — When Congress approved a federal
budget four months ago, it envisioned a lion of a
tax bill that would help eat into deficits by raising
$73 billion in new revenues over three years. But
the House Ways and Means Committee gave birth
yesterday to a tax bill that, to its critics, looked dis
tinctly more like a mouse.
The bill, which attracted the support of commit
tee Democrats and Republicans alike, would raise
about $8 billion over three years from a variety of
changes in the tax code. Explained committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-lll.), "We try to do
what's doable."
The possibility remains that a somewhat larger tax
bill will prove "doable." Rostenkowski himself
plans to seek the support of his committee
Democrats for a freeze of some tax cuts that are
scheduled to go into effect next year. If he gets it,
he will offer his proposal as an amendment to the
committee bill when it goes before the full House
next week.
Beyond that, some Democratic liberals and fresh
men are preparing an amendment that would raise
the full $73 billion, but that effort appears doomed
to failure in the House. And whatever proves accep
table in the House will have to clear the Republican
controlled Senate, which is well aware that
President Reagan opposes major tax increases of all
kinds.

Reagan defends defense system
Washington — President Reagan said last night that
the cost of a plan to build a space-based missile
defense system has been greatly exaggerated and
defended his interest in the system by saying that if
nations build defensive systems, "then nobody's
going to start a war."
Administration sources have said Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger has recommended to
Reagan that the United States develop a system that
would cost $18 billion to $27 billion over the next
five years.
Reagan last March asked for a plan to advance
U.S. defensive capabilities. The Pentagon has said

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles TimesAVashington Post News Service

the proposal has been sent to the White House.
The president said at a news conference that he
had not seen the report.
But, he said, referring to news reports about it,"I
am fascinated with reading all about it . . . and I can
tell you that no one has suggested any such figure
in the billions of dollars that have been proposed."
However, the figure was in one of the four op
tions prepared for Reagan, according to administra
tion sources who spoke on the condition that they
not be identified by name.
The recommendations were reached after
months of scientific study and policy analysis stem
ming from the president's speech on arms control
on March 23. In that address, he called for a study
of a space-based military concept.

Senate approves King holiday
Washington —With Martin Luther King's family and
civil-rights compatriots looking on from the
visitors' gallery, the Senate gave final approval yes
terday to a bitterly contested bill creating a national
holiday in King's memory.
By a vote of 78-22, the measure, which has already
passed the House, was sent to President Reagan,
who has promised to sign it. It would designate the
third Monday in January, beginning in 1986, as a
paid holiday honoring the slain civil-rights leader.
After the Senate roll call, King's widow, Coretta
Scott King, declared that it was "a great day for
America and the world." Joseph Lowery, who now
heads the Southern Christian Leadership Confer
ence that King founded, said that passage of the bill
was a call for "a new beginning to feed the hungry,

house those who are outdoors, clothe the naked
and let justice roll down like water."
Opponents of the bill — 18 Republicans and four
Democrats — mainly expressed concern about the
cost of a new paid holiday, and there were strong
indications that Congress would move quickly to
possibly reduce the total number of holidays or to
let some of the Monday holidays — including the one
honoring King — occasionally fall on weekends. With
the addition of the day honoring King, there will be
a total of 10 federal holidays.
Some critics, notably Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.),
deemed King as being unworthy of the highest
honor the government can bestow. Helms kept up
his relentless attacks on King yesterday and tried to
the end to torpedo the legislation with amend
ments. One rider, rejected 92-5, called on Reagan
to grant a pardon to Marcus Garvey, a back-to-
Africa black nationalist in the 19205.
Helms assaults were countered by soaring bursts
of rhetoric extolling King as a man who, in the
words of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), "brought
us a fuller measure of justice than our nation had
ever known before."
At the same time, Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.)
delivered a startlingly caustic attack on Helms and
Sen. John East (R-N.C.), accusing them of "playing
up to Jim Crow."
Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) also was
critical of Helms in a speech in which she said,
"Unfortunately, the well of debate has been
poisoned by character assassination against Martin
Luther King."
Helms, who accused King of widespread commu
nist connections and, at a press conference yester
day, of womanizing, told reporters: "I'm not a
bigot, I'm not a racist."
Helms charged that the bill had been steamrol
lered by Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.) in an "atmosphere of intimidation." He
explained that senators were told that they faced
retaliation by black voters who would not vote for
them if they opposed the bill. But Helms, who faces
a tough re-election fight next year, said that he did
not expect any blacks to vote for him anyway.
Baker, who put the legislation on a fast track and
helped persuade Reagan to reverse his original op
position to it, concluded three days of debate by
recalling how struck he was by King's famous "I
Have a Dream" speech on the Washington Mall 20
years ago. He said the bill would "memorialize the
extraordinary progress we have made in race rela
tions and renew our commitment to expanding the
horizon of human freedom still more."
Lebanese talks postponed
Beirut — After a day of heavy fighting and a car
bomb explosion that injured four U.S. Marines, the
Lebanese government yesterday night announced
postponement of a national reconciliation confer
ence of leaders of the country's warring factions
that was to have opened today.
The postponement came after leaders of Druze
and other factions said they would not go to Beirut
International Airport, the designated site of the
proposed "national dialogue," because the area
still is unsafe.
The government of President Amin Gemayel said
it was still seeking ways to resolve the impasse over
the site of the conference, but it gave no indication
of when or where it would be held.

The setback came as artillery fire shook the
mountains east of Beirut and the predominantly
Shiite Moslem slum neighborhoods near the air
port in exchanges that lasted from early morning to
late afternoon.
The Marines were injured when a car bomb ex
ploded near the Kuwaiti Embassy not far from the
main road to the airport. Authorities said the bomb,
in an auto parked across from the Sabra and
Chatilla refugee camps, blew up after apparently
being detonated by radio. The injured Marines
were riding in a jeep, at the end of a four-vehicle
convoy, according to a Marine spokesman.
Maj. Robert Jordan described the wounds as
minor — largely superficial head and hand cuts and
damaged ear drums. He said a Palestinian man and
woman rushed out of the camps and helped the
injured Marines.
U.S. officials said they did not know which fac
tion set the bomb, but they said radical elements
intent on sabotaging the conference have
repeatedly attempted to scuttle the talks by trying
to engage the Marines against militias.
Prospects for holding a peace conference to draft
a new power-sharing formula for Lebanon and end
eight years of civil war had begun to dim when
Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, head of the Syrian
backed Progressive Socialist Party, announced ear
lier yesterday at a press conference in Mouktara in
the Shout mountains that he would boycott the
talks.
"It is very strange that Lebanese authorities ex
tended invitations to the conference before we had
even agreed on its location," jumblatt said. "We
must agree on the place first. It is not convenient
security-wise, especially because it has been bom
barded for two days."
Jumblatt, whose militia is in the mountains that
dominate the airport and is in a position to deter
mine whether the airport will function or not,
reiterated his proposal that the conference be held
either aboard a Greek ship in Lebanese waters or in
Tunisia.
Earlier, former prime minister Rashid Karami, one
of three leaders of the Syrian-backed National
Salvation Front, an anti-Gemayel group, said in
Tripoli that leaders of the front would not attend
the reconciliation meetings.

heads the Southern Christian Leadership Confer

was a call for "a new beginning to feed the hungry,

house those who are outdoors, clothe the naked
and let justice roll down like water."
Opponents of the bill — 18 Republicans and four
Democrats — mainly expressed concern about the
cost of a new paid holiday, and there were strong
indications that Congress would move quickly to
possibly reduce the total number of holidays or to
let some of the Monday holidays — including the one
honoring King — occasionally fall on weekends. With
the addition of the day honoring King, there will be
a total of 10 federal holidays.
Some critics, notably Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.),
deemed King as being unworthy of the highest
honor the government can bestow. Helms kept up
his relentless attacks on King yesterday and tried to
the end to torpedo the legislation with amend

to grant a pardon to Marcus Garvey, a back-to-
Africa black nationalist in the 19205.
Helms assaults were countered by soaring bursts

words of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), "brought
us a fuller measure of justice than our nation had

At the same time, Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.)
delivered a startlingly caustic attack on Helms and

Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) also was
critical of Helms in a speech in which she said,
"Unfortunately, the well of debate has been

Helms, who accused King of widespread commu

Helms charged that the bill had been steamrol
lered by Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.) in an "atmosphere of intimidation." He
explained that senators were told that they faced
retaliation by black voters who would not vote for
them if they opposed the bill. But Helms, who faces
a tough re-election fight next year, said that he did
not expect any blacks to vote for him anyway.
Baker, who put the legislation on a fast track and
helped persuade Reagan to reverse his original op
position to it, concluded three days of debate by
recalling how struck he was by King's famous "I

years ago. He said the bill would "memorialize the

Lebanese talks postponed
Beirut — After a day of heavy fighting and a car
bomb explosion that injured four U.S. Marines, the
Lebanese government yesterday night announced
postponement of a national reconciliation confer
ence of leaders of the country's warring factions
that was to have opened today.
The postponement came after leaders of Druze
and other factions said they would not go to Beirut
International Airport, the designated site of the
proposed "national dialogue," because the area
still is unsafe.
The government of President Amin Gemayel said
it was still seeking ways to resolve the impasse over
the site of the conference, but it gave no indication
of when or where it would be held.

The setback came as artillery fire shook the
mountains east of Beirut and the predominantly
Shiite Moslem slum neighborhoods near the air
port in exchanges that lasted from early morning to
late afternoon.
The Marines were injured when a car bomb ex
ploded near the Kuwaiti Embassy not far from the
main road to the airport. Authorities said the bomb,
in an auto parked across from the Sabra and
Chatilla refugee camps, blew up after apparently
being detonated by radio. The injured Marines
were riding in a jeep, at the end of a four-vehicle
convoy, according to a Marine spokesman.
Maj. Robert Jordan described the wounds as
minor — largely superficial head and hand cuts and
damaged ear drums. He said a Palestinian man and
woman rushed out of the camps and helped the
injured Marines.
U.S. officials said they did not know which fac
tion set the bomb, but they said radical elements
intent on sabotaging the conference have
repeatedly attempted to scuttle the talks by trying
to engage the Marines against militias.
Prospects for holding a peace conference to draft
a new power-sharing formula for Lebanon and end
eight years of civil war had begun to dim when
Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, head of the Syrian
backed Progressive Socialist Party, announced ear
lier yesterday at a press conference in Mouktara in
the Shout mountains that he would boycott the
talks.
"It is very strange that Lebanese authorities ex
tended invitations to the conference before we had
even agreed on its location," jumblatt said. "We
must agree on the place first. It is not convenient
security-wise, especially because it has been bom
barded for two days."
Jumblatt, whose militia is in the mountains that
dominate the airport and is in a position to deter
mine whether the airport will function or not,
reiterated his proposal that the conference be held
either aboard a Greek ship in Lebanese waters or in
Tunisia.
Earlier, former prime minister Rashid Karami, one
of three leaders of the Syrian-backed National
Salvation Front, an anti-Gemayel group, said in
Tripoli that leaders of the front would not attend
the reconciliation meetings.
Shultz warns against aid cutoff
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz
warned House leaders yesterday that a vote to cut
off secret U.S. aid to rebels in Nicaragua would
"undermine the cause of peace and democracy"
and "virtually destroy" chances for a negotiated
settlement in the region.
"The administration policies to help bring peace
to Central America are now beginning to bear

fruit," Shultz said in a letter to House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) and Minority
Leader Robert Michel (R-lll.). "I urge the House not
to impose restrictions on this policy and thereby
undermine the cause of peace and democracy that
we all support."
The strongly worded letter was part of last-minute
maneuvering before today's debate on whether to
end covert aid to guerrilla groups attacking the lef
tist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The vote,
expected to be close, will be preceded by a rare
closed session of the full House to discuss classified
information about the "secret war" in Nicaragua.
Unlike the last closed session, which was called
by Reagan administration supporters to defend the
covert aid program there, this one was requested
by Rep. Edward Boland (D-Mass.), chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee and sponsor of the
amendment to cut off U.S. aid to the anti-Sandinista
rebels.
A Democratic staff aide said Boland would use
the closed session to "directly challenge the admin
istration on how the support program helps or
hinders regional negotiations" and to "stress how
U.S. objectives have changed and how the conflict
is deepening there with the concurrent greater risk
of pulling us in militarily."
The aide said congressmen also were likely to dis
cuss recent splits within the ranks of the U.S.-
backed rebels and the degree to which the
anti-Sandinista guerrilla groups respond to U.S. ef
forts to control them.
Israel opposes arms sales
Washington — Israel objects in principle to any sale
of U.S. weapons to hostile Arab nations, including
the sale of equipment to Jordan for use by an
American-trained brigade that would respond to
emergencies in the Persian Gulf, Israeli Ambassa
dor Meir Rosenne said yesterday.
Such weapons, Rosenne told the Los Angeles
Times, are "quite often used against us."
"We had this experience many times, and we saw
even during the war in Lebanon that weapons that
were given to Saudi Arabia were delivered after
wards to the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion)," he said.
Rosenne said that the Israelis "are discussing this
issue with the United States at this time" but would
not give details.
The Israeli envoy also would not comment on any
possible changes in U.S. Middle East policy that
may occur as Robert McFarlane takes over as Presi
dent Reagan's national security adviser. However,
Rosenne, who participated in the negotiations that
led to the 1979 Camp David accords, went out of his
way to praise the U.S. record in the region.
"Maybe we don't share 100 percent the percep

tion on the U.S. policy. I think that if there is one
superpower that did something to encourage the
peace process in the Middle East, it is the United
States," he said.
Tax bill to cut deficit
»
Washington — When Congress approved a federal
budget four months ago, it envisioned a lion of a
tax bill that would help eat into deficits by raising
$73 billion in new revenues over three years. But
the House Ways and Means Committee gave birth
yesterday to a tax bill that, to its critics, looked dis
tinctly more like a mouse.
The bill, which attracted the support of commit
tee Democrats and Republicans alike, would raise
about $8 billion over three years from a variety of
changes in the tax code. Explained committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-lll.), "We try to do
what's doable."
The possibility remains that a somewhat larger tax
bill will prove "doable." Rostenkowski himself
plans to seek the support of his committee
Democrats for a freeze of some tax cuts that are
scheduled to go into effect next year. If he gets it,
he will offer his proposal as an amendment to the
committee bill when it goes before the full House
next week.
Beyond that, some Democratic liberals and fresh
men are preparing an amendment that would raise
the full $73 billion, but that effort appears doomed
to failure in the House. And whatever proves accep
table in the House will have to clear the Republican
controlled Senate, which is well aware that
President Reagan opposes major tax increases of all
kinds.
Stocks fall again
New York — The stock market suffered another
broad decline in heavy trading yesterday, although
a late rebound helped narrow the losses.
Digital Equipment and many other computer
stocks again fell in the aftermath of Digital's
surprise announcement Tuesday that earnings were
well short of expectations for the quarter ended
Oct. 1.
Steel, auto, mining and forest-products issues
also declined.
Today's weather
Sunny except areas of low clouds and fog during
the morning. Highs in the 60s at the coast and the
70s inland. Afternoon winds to 20 mph.
Reagan defends defense system
Washington — President Reagan said last night that
the cost of a plan to build a space-based missile
defense system has been greatly exaggerated and
defended his interest in the system by saying that if
nations build defensive systems, "then nobody's
going to start a war."
Administration sources have said Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger has recommended to
Reagan that the United States develop a system that
would cost $18 billion to $27 billion over the next
five years.
Reagan last March asked for a plan to advance
U.S. defensive capabilities. The Pentagon has said

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles TimesAVashington Post News Service

the proposal has been sent to the White House.
The president said at a news conference that he
had not seen the report.
But, he said, referring to news reports about it,"I
am fascinated with reading all about it . . . and I can
tell you that no one has suggested any such figure
in the billions of dollars that have been proposed."
However, the figure was in one of the four op
tions prepared for Reagan, according to administra
tion sources who spoke on the condition that they
not be identified by name.
The recommendations were reached after
months of scientific study and policy analysis stem
ming from the president's speech on arms control
on March 23. In that address, he called for a study
of a space-based military concept.

Senate approves King holiday
Washington —With Martin Luther King's family and
civil-rights compatriots looking on from the
visitors' gallery, the Senate gave final approval yes
terday to a bitterly contested bill creating a national
holiday in King's memory.
By a vote of 78-22, the measure, which has already
passed the House, was sent to President Reagan,
who has promised to sign it. It would designate the
third Monday in January, beginning in 1986, as a
paid holiday honoring the slain civil-rights leader.
After the Senate roll call, King's widow, Coretta
Scott King, declared that it was "a great day for
America and the world." Joseph Lowery, who now
heads the Southern Christian Leadership Confer
ence that King founded, said that passage of the bill
was a call for "a new beginning to feed the hungry,

house those who are outdoors, clothe the naked
and let justice roll down like water."
Opponents of the bill — 18 Republicans and four
Democrats — mainly expressed concern about the
cost of a new paid holiday, and there were strong
indications that Congress would move quickly to
possibly reduce the total number of holidays or to
let some of the Monday holidays — including the one
honoring King — occasionally fall on weekends. With

to grant a pardon to Marcus Garvey, a back-to-
Africa black nationalist in the 19205.
Helms assaults were countered by soaring bursts
of rhetoric extolling King as a man who, in the
words of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), "brought

Israel opposes arms sales
Washington — Israel objects in principle to any sale
of U.S. weapons to hostile Arab nations, including
the sale of equipment to Jordan for use by an
American-trained brigade that would respond to
emergencies in the Persian Gulf, Israeli Ambassa
dor Meir Rosenne said yesterday.
Such weapons, Rosenne told the Los Angeles
Times, are "quite often used against us."
"We had this experience many times, and we saw
even during the war in Lebanon that weapons that
were given to Saudi Arabia were delivered after
wards to the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion)," he said.
Rosenne said that the Israelis "are discussing this
issue with the United States at this time" but would
not give details.
The Israeli envoy also would not comment on any
possible changes in U.S. Middle East policy that
may occur as Robert McFarlane takes over as Presi
dent Reagan's national security adviser. However,
Rosenne, who participated in the negotiations that
led to the 1979 Camp David accords, went out of his
way to praise the U.S. record in the region.
"Maybe we don't share 100 percent the percep

tion on the U.S. policy. I think that if there is one
superpower that did something to encourage the
peace process in the Middle East, it is the United
States," he said.
Tax bill to cut deficit
»
Washington — When Congress approved a federal
budget four months ago, it envisioned a lion of a
tax bill that would help eat into deficits by raising
$73 billion in new revenues over three years. But
the House Ways and Means Committee gave birth
yesterday to a tax bill that, to its critics, looked dis
tinctly more like a mouse.
The bill, which attracted the support of commit
tee Democrats and Republicans alike, would raise
about $8 billion over three years from a variety of
changes in the tax code. Explained committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-lll.), "We try to do
what's doable."
The possibility remains that a somewhat larger tax
bill will prove "doable." Rostenkowski himself
plans to seek the support of his committee
Democrats for a freeze of some tax cuts that are
scheduled to go into effect next year. If he gets it,
he will offer his proposal as an amendment to the
committee bill when it goes before the full House
next week.
Beyond that, some Democratic liberals and fresh
men are preparing an amendment that would raise
the full $73 billion, but that effort appears doomed
to failure in the House. And whatever proves accep
table in the House will have to clear the Republican
controlled Senate, which is well aware that
President Reagan opposes major tax increases of all
kinds.
