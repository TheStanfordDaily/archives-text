Reagan defends defense system
Washington — President Reagan said last night that
the cost of a plan to build a space-based missile
defense system has been greatly exaggerated and
defended his interest in the system by saying that if
nations build defensive systems, "then nobody's
going to start a war."
Administration sources have said Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger has recommended to
Reagan that the United States develop a system that
would cost $18 billion to $27 billion over the next
five years.
Reagan last March asked for a plan to advance
U.S. defensive capabilities. The Pentagon has said

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles TimesAVashington Post News Service

the proposal has been sent to the White House.
The president said at a news conference that he
had not seen the report.
But, he said, referring to news reports about it,"I
am fascinated with reading all about it . . . and I can
tell you that no one has suggested any such figure
in the billions of dollars that have been proposed."
However, the figure was in one of the four op
tions prepared for Reagan, according to administra
tion sources who spoke on the condition that they
not be identified by name.
The recommendations were reached after
months of scientific study and policy analysis stem
ming from the president's speech on arms control
on March 23. In that address, he called for a study
of a space-based military concept.

Senate approves King holiday
Washington —With Martin Luther King's family and
civil-rights compatriots looking on from the
visitors' gallery, the Senate gave final approval yes
terday to a bitterly contested bill creating a national
holiday in King's memory.
By a vote of 78-22, the measure, which has already
passed the House, was sent to President Reagan,
who has promised to sign it. It would designate the
third Monday in January, beginning in 1986, as a
paid holiday honoring the slain civil-rights leader.
After the Senate roll call, King's widow, Coretta
Scott King, declared that it was "a great day for
America and the world." Joseph Lowery, who now
heads the Southern Christian Leadership Confer
ence that King founded, said that passage of the bill
was a call for "a new beginning to feed the hungry,

house those who are outdoors, clothe the naked
and let justice roll down like water."
Opponents of the bill — 18 Republicans and four
Democrats — mainly expressed concern about the
cost of a new paid holiday, and there were strong
indications that Congress would move quickly to
possibly reduce the total number of holidays or to
let some of the Monday holidays — including the one
honoring King — occasionally fall on weekends. With
the addition of the day honoring King, there will be
a total of 10 federal holidays.
Some critics, notably Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.),
deemed King as being unworthy of the highest
honor the government can bestow. Helms kept up
his relentless attacks on King yesterday and tried to
the end to torpedo the legislation with amend
ments. One rider, rejected 92-5, called on Reagan
