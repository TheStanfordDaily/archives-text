## Cutbacks lift Coffee House out of debt 
### HENRY CHEN 
After having spent the past tew years in the
red, the Coffee House is finally back on the
road to financial solvency, according to Vinnie
Freda, acting Coffee House president and AS
SU Council-of-Presidents (COP) member.
The Coffee House cut the number of student
employees, installed a new service system and
developed a new marketing strategy this year.
Freda said the Coffee House is trying to make
up for the "heavy" debt it has incurred since
the ASSU took over management in 1980. He
declined to discuss how much money the busi
ness has lost.
But Gary Verzani,the new Coffee House
manager, shared the same optimistic views as
Freda. "All indications are that we will make
money this month," Verzani said.
A prime goal of these changes has been to
maintain lower prices and speed up the service
lines. The Coffee House has cut back over 30

percent on its student employees. According to
Verzani, there were around 90 part time
workers last year. This year, there are only 55-60
student employees.
Another change has been the installment of a
new service system. Previous service systems
resulted in long waits, and as a result, many
people chose to eat elsewhere. Verzani claims
that the longest wait during peak hours is now
only six minutes, although several patrons have
said they have waited as long as twelve
minutes.
Included in this new system is a revised order
card that is easier to fill out.
"You don't need a Ph.D. to fill out this card,
" said Verzani.
A host or hostess is also available to help an
swer questions and keep the line moving. Ellen
Cecil, who works as a hostess, agrees that the
new changes have cut down the wait, adding
that "the line can only move as fast as the sand

wich makers."
A "Quik-Fix" line has also been introduced
this year to keep the lines short. The Quik-Fix
line features ready-made sandwiches at lower
prices than custom-made sandwiches. Both
Freda and Verzani have said the Quik-Fix line
has so tar been a tremendous success.
Marketing has been another area of empha
sis for the Coffee House board. "A marketing
plan was crucial," said Freda. "We now have a
marketing strategy and some organization."
As part of the new marketing strategy, the
Coffee House is planning different methods of
operation for day and night. For the daytime,
speed is the main concern, and the Coffee
House will be more like a sandwich shop and
cafe.
During the night, the Coffee House will try to
promote special events like live entertainment
and televised sports to try and draw in the stu
dent community.
