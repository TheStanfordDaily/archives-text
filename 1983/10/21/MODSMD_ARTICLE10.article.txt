## The
						Stanford Daily More minority doctors 
### 
Medical schools across the country should
be quite worried that the number of black
doctors and medical students in the United
States has not significantly increased during
the past three decades.
According to a recent article in the New En
gland Journal of Medicine, in 1980 approxi
mately 2.6 percent of U.S. physicians were
black — an increase of only .5 percent since
1950. In addition, in 1982 there were only 763
blacks among the 15,985 medical school
graduates.
Nationally, these are troubling statistics but
the Stanford Medical School's track record is
more promising. In a rating compiled by New
Physician magazine, the Med School here had
the fourth highest percentage of minority en
rollment in the country last year. Approxi
mately 23.4 percent of its students in 1982-83
were members of minority groups; 8.8 per
cent were black.
Only Morehouse, Howard and Meharry
medical schools — all predominately black
medical schools — rank higher than Stanford.
Those three enroll more than 25 percent of the
total black med student population.
Med School administrators here point to
their minority recruitment as the reason for

their success. While not all med schools have
such an active recruitment drive, the problem
does not rest with the med schools alone. It
extends back to the undergraduate level and
even further.
Those concerned speak of the many bright
minority high school students who are never
encouraged to think of medicine as a career
choice. They are advised to avoid rigorous
course programs that would be the funda
mental preparation for a pre-medical program
in college.
The high cost and time commitment of a
medical education is another factor often in
volved in determining why many minority stu
dents, especially those from low-income
backgrounds, shy away from medicine. Other
fields such as engineering seem to pay-off
much more quickly with good job offers.
With so little progress made toward increas
ing the number of minorities choosing a pro
fessional career in medicine, we only hope
that educators at at all levels try to rectify the
problem. But with recent cutbacks in federal
funds for medical education and the weaken
ing support for affirmative action this trend
sadly seems even more likely to continue.
