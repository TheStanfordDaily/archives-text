# Go team go!

For spectators, alumni, players and coaches
alike, the current football season has been,
well, disappointing at best. Hopes have been
dashed as the team has dropped one game
after another to teams which have simply out
played us — which hasn't been tough.
Now we realize that it's hard to root for a
team that's currently 0-6, indeed, a team thst
could end the season at 0-11. Thus, the
thousands of loyal fans who attend every
game to cheer on the team are to be com
mended.
What disturbs us, however, is the increase
in violence at the last two home games. Two
recent incidents are particularly disturbing.
The first act occurred at the ill-fated game
against San lose State. Several students were
arrested for throwing bottles at law enforce
ment personnel. These attacks were com
pletely unprovoked.
The second incident, at the UCLA game, was
the result of fraternity game-playing. Ice,
bottles, cans and other items were thrown
amidst a barrage of insults between members
of the Zeta Psi ahd Delta Upsilon fraternities.
This increase in tensions and violence may
be due to boredom of the disenchanted fans.

Clearly, though, misfortunes on the field are
not an excuse for violence in the stands.
Every game must have a winner and a loser.
Naturally, it is disappointing when your team
loses. As Vince Lombardi once said, "Winning
isn't everything, it's the only thing." Nonethe
less, we don't think that a lack of victories
should prevent the spectators from enjoying
the game at hand.
One can still bask in the sun, enjoy a few
"equally attractive" beverages and listen to
the music of the incomparable Leland Stan
ford junior University Marching Band.
We hope that the string of defeats will come
to an end tomorrow. Remember though —
things could be worse. Northwestern Univer
sity lost 34 consecutive games in a losing
streak that spanned four seasons.
Clearly, this year's football program is
plagued by a variety of problems. The
coaches, especially the offensive ones, are
failing to guide players to victory.
Yet there is one problem that we can elimi
nate without improved or new coachirig. The
violence in the stands must go, so that the rest
of us can root for the team.
