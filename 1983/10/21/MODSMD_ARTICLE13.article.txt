# Larry Dahl: Ask Swami
## A 						guru's advice for students 
### 
Dear Swami:
Does the fact that movie theaters
show bargain matinees prove that
theater owners have a heart and
aren't just greedy capitalists like oil
company executives, doctors,
lawyers and other tycoons? My dad
owns a hig chain of theaters.
Hopeful
Dear Hopeful:
Sorry kid. Your old man's as
guilty as the rest of them. After
seeing several movies in the last
year it's my opinion that your dad
has a great racket. By all rights he
ought to be paying people to sit
through most of the movies, and
not the other way around.
My advice is to look for a new
father.Your present one has a heap
of bad Karma piled up. He bilked
me out of five bucks just last week.
You might try putting an ad in the
paper for a new dad.
But, if that doesn't work, you can
ask your dad to try purging his soul
by sending 20 percent of his gross
to me. Make sure you get that right
about the gross. If he offers part of
the net it won't do his soul much
good.
I don't ask this for my own per
sonal gain, but for his, to help him
develop the generous heart a good
father needs. He'll be a better dad
for it. I'm sure. Trust your Swami.
I obviously can't accept checks
myself because I could never allow

myself to touch anything as filthy as
money. But you can have him send
the check to my manager, friend,
translator and disciple, Larry Dahl,
in care of this newspaper. He's
filthy enough to touch the stuff. By
the way, he also accepts most major
credit cards.
Dear Swami:
I'm a 30-year-old male and I've
never had a meaningful relation
ship with a woman. My mother asks
all kinds of embarrassing questions
and now I'm worried that I have
some kind of strange new social
disease. What should I do?
Worried.
Dear Worried:
Being a most perfect and pure
swami, I have never been involved
directly in such fleshy matters, but
my disciple used to worry about the
same thing. I'll give you the same
advice I gave him. Leave well
enough alone.
Relationships come in many vari
eties. Meaningful ones are by far
the most dangerous. You don't
need to go out of your way looking
for trouble. If you're like my dis
ciple, you'll learn to fall into it
naturally. And before you can do
anything about it you'll probably
be involved in relationships that
have even more meanings than
you'll care to think about.
Dear Swami:
I have a boyfriend, but he ignores

me a lot now and last week he said
he wants us both to date other
people to help us grow. I'm an at
tractive woman and I have enclosed
a recent picture of us at the beach
to prove to you that I'm honest
about that. I'm a very loving person
and want to do what's right. What
should I do? Ignored.
Dear Ignored:
Dump the jerk. Pronto. From the
picture I can see with my supreme,
clear and impartial vision that he's
nothing but a young lecher out to
take advantage of you. And after
studying your image in the photo
for several hours in a locked room
I've concluded that anyone who
would ignore you must have a
major hormone deficiency.
Dear Swami:
I am still annoyed with lames
Watt. What can we do about him?
Nature Lover.
Dear Nature Lover:
There's an old saying that goes,
"Let nature take its course." I sug
gest that by court order Watt he
given a chance to discuss his views
frankly in a locked room for a day
with 12 grizzly bears who have
recently been evicted from their
homes. Let them thrash things out
directly. I'm sure that $ucb a,dirrci
encounter with nature would teach
him a great deal that could come in
handy in his next lifetime.

tractive woman and I have enclosed
a recent picture of us at the beach
to prove to you that I'm honest
about that. I'm a very loving person
and want to do what's right. What
should I do? Ignored.
Dear Ignored:
Dump the jerk. Pronto. From the
picture I can see with my supreme,
clear and impartial vision that he's
nothing but a young lecher out to
take advantage of you. And after
studying your image in the photo
for several hours in a locked room
I've concluded that anyone who
would ignore you must have a
major hormone deficiency.
Dear Swami:
I am still annoyed with lames
Watt. What can we do about him?
Nature Lover.
Dear Nature Lover:
There's an old saying that goes,
"Let nature take its course." I sug
gest that by court order Watt he
given a chance to discuss his views
frankly in a locked room for a day
with 12 grizzly bears who have
recently been evicted from their
homes. Let them thrash things out
directly. I'm sure that $ucb a,dirrci
encounter with nature would teach
him a great deal that could come in
handy in his next lifetime.
