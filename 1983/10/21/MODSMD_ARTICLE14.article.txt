# One group is creating a great controversy on campus
## 
### 
This quarter at Stanford has been un
usually rich in controversies, as many of
you have doubtless noticed. Few people
realize, however, that all these controver
sies are the brainchildren of just one
group at Stanford, which calls itself
"Stanford Against Stuff and Such." Its
leader, Justin Noying, generously agreed
to talk with our Roving Reporter last week.
Excerpts from that interview:
Roving Reporter (RR): What is your group's
main goal or purpose?
Justin Noying (JN): Our job, as we see it, is
to be resolutely against everything, with
out regard to religion, race or creed, in
such a way that The Daily won't have to put
Once Around The Quad on the front page.
RR: Is boosting The Daily's circulation your
main raison d' etre, then?
JN: Definitely not. We also provide an out
let for the community-minded at Stanford,
providing them with issues to write daily
columns and letters about, to provide a
topic of dinner conversation for the loud
mouthed of this subculture, and, in gen
eral, to keep these people busy when
they're not studying for LSATs. In addition,
through the circulation of petitions, we
give University President Donald Kennedy

something to do between his morning jog
and his nightly alumni dinner, at least
when the Queen's not in town.
RR: What would you consider one of your
greatest recent triumphs?
JN: The Hoover controversy, without a
doubt, which we've kept going since last
spring. First, we organized the petition
against the Hoover Institution, and then
the counterpetition against those against
Hoover. Next, we got some Hoover people
to come out publicly against the contro
versy, and we were also instrumental in
having several reports written which took
strong stances against everybody, and
which were universally condemned.
We were then able to expand the contro
versy with the addition of the Reagan Li
brary, Museum and Public Affairs Center
Controversy, with various petitions and
Daily columns, letters and editorials all op
posing either part of the complex, or
Hoover's potential connections with the
complex, as well as some opposing those
who oppose the complex.
All in all, we estimate that this contro
versy has occupied approximately 3500
yards of Daily column space, has saved

Kennedy from having to eat over 2300
pounds of chicken florentine at alumni
dinners, and has kept roughly 18,000 man
hours of impassioned dining room argu
ments away from Stanford's pre
professionals and returned those contro
versies to the co-op meeting rooms, the
Political Science Department bathroom
walls, and petitions — where they belong. In
addition, we have kept several Poli Sci
professors and almost half of all Hoover
fellows from having the time to write
scholarly articles — which is of critical im
portance to Stanford's Poli Sci students,
who have far too much reserve reading
already.
RR: Speaking of reserve reading, has SASS
been involved in the latest Meyer Library
Controversy?
JN: From the beginning. We were the con
sultants who did the original calculation
that an 80-hour cutback during the quarter
is equal to an additional 14 hours in Dead
Week. We also organized the sit-in at
Meyer last Saturday. Unfortunately,
Meyer, against our advice, gave in and this
controversy appears to have little future
for us, although we're exploring the Green
bicycle parking angle.

RR: What's SASS working on right now?
JN: Well, first of all, we're trying to keep
the Quad Renovation Plan Controversy
simmering, so that when the Hoover Con
troversy peters out in 1985 or so we'll have
something to fall back on. For the hard
core, we currently offer the Coffee House
Controversy, the Campus Concerts Con
troversy, the Fee Assessment Refund Con
troversy, the Stanford Synchrotron Radia
tion Laboratory Controversy, the Zeta Psi
Controversy, and the Steven Mosher Con
troversy.
On a more popular basis, we are cur
rently stirring up controversy on two is
sues: The Parking Controversy, and the
Res. Ed. Alcohol Policy Controversy. The
Parking Controversy is something we've
been working on for some time now, but
we were only able to get our controversial
parking fee increase passed. So far we've
generated a lot of angry letters to the
editor, and we're currently working on a
petition. We also have tentative plans for a
"park-in" sometime this winter.
The Res. Ed. Alcohol Policy Controversy
has been frustrating for us, however, be
cause most people have been cheerfully

ignoring the policy. A week from today,
however, we will be circulating petitions at
Happy Hours — I mean, Fridays at Five —
which will demand that Res. Ed. change its
controversial policy.
Then, in November, we'll be ex
perimenting with a second Big Game Con
troversy. We're in the final stages of our
negotiations with the Band on the precise
details of that one. Winter quarter there
will be a Food Service Controversy, where
we will be exploiting Stern's latent hostility
to everybody, and everybody's latent hos
tility to Sterling Quad, where the pay-as
you eat plan has been, unfortunately,
surprisingly uncontroversial within Ster
ling.
Finally, in the Spring, we'll unveil our
Eighth Annual ASSU Controversy. The
precise issue is still in the works.
RR: Any plans in the long-run?
)N: Next year, we're going to be calling for
our own abolition, which we will vigorous
ly oppose. We hope to generate enough
controversy on that issue to make it a moot
point without anyone hoticing it.
