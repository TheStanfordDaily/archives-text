I would like to thank Mark Du
pont for his letter ("Sex isn't
everything," Oct. 19). I would also
like to add to his thoughts.
While it is true that I was
quoted in Monday's article ("AIDS
threat instills caution in Stanford
gay community/' Oct. 17), The
Daily reporter chose his quotes
very carefully in order to portray
what he wanted, not the true
picture of the Stanford gay com
munity. During our 15 minute
phone conversation, I told the
reporter several times (in response
to his questions) that my life had
not changed due to "the AIDS
threat." Believe it or not, I have
no fear of contracting AIDS in my
room, in Green Library or in
Lagunita Dining Hall. Since I am
rarely anywhere else but these
places, my life has not and will

not change. I he reporter told me
that all the other gay men he had
spoken to also said they had no
need to change their lifestyles.
The amount of sexual activity in
the Stanford gay community is
neither more nor less than the
amount of sexual activity among
Stanford straights. The reporter
knew this from his interviews and
yet he still biased his article. The
longest quote in the article, which
informed us that "sex is the gay
man's rhythm," was from some
unknown columnist in a Green
wich Village newspaper, not from
a Stanford person. Giving a highly
slanted view of an already misun
derstood minority when the
chance exists to write a good,
accurate article is irresponsible.
