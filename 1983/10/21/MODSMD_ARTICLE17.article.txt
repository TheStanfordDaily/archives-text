# Calendar makers say it's not as easy as it looks

Stanford's answer to the
"Men of USC" calendar has
arrived.
The 1984 Campus Classics
calendar, featuring 12 male
models from Stanford, is an
entrepreneurial effort by
Peter Kiplinger and Christina
Reid.
After seeing similar calen
dars from USC and the Uni
versity of Arizona, the two
juniors decided to take on the
responsibility of publishing a
"Men of Stanford" calendar.
They say that when they
first began work on the proj
ect in 1982, they never
realized how much time it
would take.
"I started out thinking that
all we had to do was to find
the guys, take their pictures,
print the calendar and sell it,"
Kiplinger said.
But soon they had in
coporated themselves as Reid
Kiplinger Ltd., obtained a
copyright and an Interna
tional Standard Book Num
ber, and started to make what
seemed like an endless num
ber of phone calls.
Contacts were to be made

with publishers, calendar
buyers, professional photog
raphers, bookstores and any
business connections who
could help them with adver
tising, marketing and dis
tributing their product. The
pair's fathers provided the in
itial financial backing.
Students provided sugges
tions of men on campus who
they thought would make
good models for the calen
dar. Approximately 120 men
were contacted, and a great
deal of those contacted ex
pressed interest in the proj
ect.
Kiplinger, Reid and a group
of friends set up preliminary
photo sessions with about 70
male students.
But they ran into more
snags. NCAA restrictions
against athletes in promo
tional features eliminated
many of their original can
didates.
Finally, they narrowed the
remaining models to 12 and
professional photographer
P.E. Hewitt photographed the
models.
Throughout the photo ses
sions the amateur models —
none had previous modeling
experience — were enthusias
tic but nervous, Kiplinger said.
Publishing the calendar has
required a year of solid work
for the two, and there's still
more to go. Reid and
Kiplinger continue to work on
publicity and sales, although
they say the hardest part — sel
ling the first few thousand
calendars — is behind them.
The first few sales attempts
left them in a Catch-22 situa
tion; they didn't want to print

calendars until they were sure
they could sell them, but
buyers were hesistant to pur
chase a product they couldn't
see.
But the two persevered,
and were able to sell 5000
copies before printing the
first batch of 15,000.
And now the calendar has
caught on. They have sold it
to B. Dalton Booksellers and
Waldenbooks, as well as the
Ingram Book Company.

'It's a good
feeling to take
on a high-risk
oriented project
and come out
successful. It
makes you feel
responsible,
more able/

Several university bookstores
across the country have also
purchased copies to sell.
The Stanford Bookstore
alone sold more than 175
copies of the calendar in its
first three weeks on the
shelves, and sales are ex
pected to increase rapidly as
the new year approaches.
And although they aren't
offering specific figures, Reid
and Kiplinger say they are
making money.
Kiplinger said that reaction
to the calendar has been
overwhelmingly positive.

Even those students who say
they wouldn't be comfortable
with a pin-up calendar of
their classmates on their walls
say that they are impressed
with the quality of the calen
dar.
Surprisingly, feedback has
been positive from males as
well as females.
"To get positive feedback
from guys about a male calen
dar . . . it's a good feeling,"
Kiplinger said.

What is especially
to Reid and Kiplinger is the
actualization of what was only
an idea one year ago. "It's a
good feeling to take on a
high-risk-oriented project
and come out successful. It
makes you feel responsible,
more able," Kiplinger ex
plained.
Reid and Kiplinger have
already started planning for
the 1985 version of the calen
dar, although the two hope to
find a publisher who will take
over the work of marketing,
advertising and distribution.
