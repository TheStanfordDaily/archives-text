# It's still cycle vs. pedestrian in the battle of the bike lanes
## 
### TINA-MARIE BASKIN 
Has this ever happened to you? The
bell rings and your professor keeps
lecturing. And you don't understand
the assignment due tomorrow so you
have to talk to her after she finally
finishes talking. You clear up the
question, but now it's three minutes
before your next class — which is all
the way across campus, of course.
What do you do? What do you f'o?

If you're like the majority of
students, you hop on your
bike and blindly speed to
class. "Don sez walk your
bike," the signs say, but most
students fail to heed this and
the other such messages.
Despite what pedestrians
and bicyclists may think,
those little white arrows
painted on the asphalt, the
nice yield triangles in front of
the Quad, the pedestrian
crossings and the "walk your
bike" signs by Tresidder were
not put there for decorative
purposes.
Two years ago the Bicycle
Safety Committee issued a
study to resolve the conflicts
that were occuring between
pedestrians and cyclists. The
committee looked at other
California campus situations,
keeping in mind that Stan
ford's solution had to be both
aesthetic and effective. The
results of the studv are the

now permanent bike (- iths all
around the campus. Does the
committee feel that the paths
are effective?
)ohn Harbaw, chairman of
the Bicycle Safety Committee,
says that they have been ben
eficial, "but with so many
pedestrians and cyclists it's
difficult to get specific data
on exactly how much they
have helped. The committee
is not planning to create any
more bike paths, so we hope
that their effect will be a pro
gressive one."
Students, however, say that
the paths are not as effective
as they should be.
Sophomore Laura Pal said,
"Maybe if people would get
their acts in gear and not wait
until the last minute to leave
for class, the bike lanes would
serve a purpose. But as it
stands now, there are
hundreds of undergrads with
bikes and lanes that hold
about four bikers.

"It's very annoying — the
bikers get in the pedestrian
lanes and vice versa. It's a real
hassle."
Another sophomore, Jen
nifer Lee, agrees with Pal. "I
don't think they work well
during those 10 minutes of
passing time — you fear for

your life. One pe son going
the wrong way an really
mess it up for everyone."
Why don't bicyclists obey
those little arrows? For the
majority of students, time
seems to be the major factor.
As one student put it, If I'm
coming from the Quad, I

don' 1 want to go all the way
around the fountain just to
get to my post office box. I'm
in a hurry."
Sophomore Winifred
Hegarty said, "People think
the paths are just useless lines
and that they can get there
faster (by not using them). No

one follows them and it
contuses it for everybody."
Senior Dave Cregor put it
another way. "I don't follow
the signs because I'm usually
riding in off-hours.
Sometimes there are people
or mopeds in the lanes and
it's easier to go my own way."

Judy Chan, associate direc
tor of the Planning Office
which played a major role in
implementing the new bike
lanes, sees enforcement as
major problem. "As it stands
now vehicle enforcement is
probably of utmost concern
because of the high risk toe
tor. Mopeds are fine if they
are used as a bike, but usually
they are under power and
that's very dangerous. To
combat this problem, new ve
hicle exclusion signs have
been created to be used in 18
different locations."
Chan explained that these
red diagonally slashed signs
should be more effective than
the non-graphic signs they
replace.
Enforcement is also being
stepped up in the evening
hours. More citations are
going to be given to students
who ride without a light, or
run traffic signs.
While increased law en
forcement around campus
should make traveling safer,
students say it won't solve all
the problems between bikers
and pedestrians. People will
still stand in the bike lanes
and students will continue to
leave late for class, to dis
regard rules of the road, and
to opt for the path of least
resistance to make up for lost
time. Is there any solution for
making the bike paths more
effective?
One student offered a
simple remedy. "If we didn't
have to go to class," he said,
"I'm sure the problem would
solve itself."
