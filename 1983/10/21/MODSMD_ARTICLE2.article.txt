# Study shows link between small classes, high grades

Students in smaller classes receive
higher grades than those in larger
classes, according to a study of Stan
ford student records.
The Stanford Curriculum Study,
conducted by John Boli, research
coordinator from the Office of Un
dergraduate Research, Herant
Katchadourian, vice provost for un
dergraduate education, and
Registrar Sally Mahoney, reports
that grades are "inversely related to
class size in all of the school divi
sions."
The study is based on the entire
academic records of graduating stu
dents from 1975-76 to 1981-82. It is
the first annual report to summarize
University curriculum statistics over
an extended period.
The relationship between class
size and grades is "strongest in the
natural sciences and engineering
and quite substantial in the
humanities and social sciences,"
asserts the study, which was pub
lished as a supplement to Wednes
day's Campus Report.
The University offers many small
classes, with 38 percent of all under
graduate course enrollments in
classes of 30 students or fewer, and
18 percent in classes of 15 at most.
Differences in class size partially
account for the fact that humanities
grades are on the average higher
than engineering grades, according
to the study.
"To a large extent, grades are
higher in the humanities than in en
gineering because classes in the

former are smaller than those in the
latter," assert the researchers. They
note that "this is an important result
that should help moderate the view
that grading in the humanities is
'easy,' and grading in engineering is
'tough.' "
The study concedes that mean
grades differ only slightly among the
natural sciences, social sciences and
humanities when class size differ
ences are taken into account.
However, even after controlling
for class size, the School of Engi
neering has the lowest average
grades -at least partially because, the
authors of the study contend,
grading is "indeed somewhat stric
ter in engineering than in other
areas."
Before controlling for class size,
mean grade point averages in the
four major school divisions during
the 1979-80 school year were 3.45 for
humanities courses, 3.35 for social
sciences, 3.27 for natural sciences,
and 3.21 for engineering. After these
controls were implemented, mean
GPAs in humanities, social sciences,
natural sciences and engineering
courses were 3.45, 3.43, 3.42 and
3.33 respectively.
The study's authors suggest that
the effect of class size on grades
should be taken into account in
making academic awards at gradua
tion. They point out that a student
who has taken relatively few small
classes will have a lower CPA
"through no fault of his own," than
students who have taken many small
classes.
"On the other hand," continue

the researchers, "we think it would
be unwise to try to induce instruc
tors to stiffen their grading stan
dards in smaller classes, for we are
well aware of the great educational
advantages of small classes and do
not want to imply that the higher
grades given in small classes are
usually unjustified."
Another significant finding of the
study is that natural science majors
received higher grades than other
students in nearly all fields. The
study group says this is "a clear indi
cation that the pre-medical sub
culture attracts high-achieving stu
dents."
The researchers also note that nat
ural science students are also more
likely than other students to earn
awards at graduation.
A computer analysis of grades
earned by graduating Stanford
seniors during their undergraduate
years also shows that grades are
only "somewhat related" to
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)
scores.
Women come to Stanford with
lower SAT math scores than do men,
and they are more strongly in
fluenced by their established abili
ties in their choice of major, accor
ding to the study.
While the report reveals that
gender plays an even smaller role
than SATs in determining under
graduate grades, the researchers
note that "there is considerable
conformity to sex stereotypes
among Stanford students in the
