## Last year's loss to Arizona began losing skid Card tries to end it where it started 
### ADAM BERNS 
The Arizona Wildcats have
recently taken a fall in the na
tional rankings — from No. 3
three weeks ago to No. 19 this
week. But if precedence is
any indication, Arizona's fail
ure against Oregon last week
is nothing for Stanford fans to
get too excited about.
Three weeks ago, after a 33-
33 tie with UC-Berkeley, the
Wildcats came back to stomp
all over Colorado State 52-21
in a game which was even
more of a rout than the score
indicated. After losing to
Oregon last weekend, the
Wildcats may be looking to
take out their frustrations
again.
"They (the Wildcats) just
kicked the hell out of
Colorado State," Stanford
Coach Paul Wiggin said this
past week.
But the revenge motive
could also work the other
wav. Stanford, 0-6 on the
season and 0-9 extending
back to last year, started its
losing streak in the Arizona
game last year. The Cardinal
led the Wildcats 27-13 earlv in
the fourth quarter but gave
up four touchdowns in the
final 12 minutes and lost the
game 41-27.
"I think that Stanford is the
best 0-6 team in the country,"
Arizona Coach Larry Smith
said of the Cardinal. Stanford
does not have much competi
tion in that category among
the Division I schools: Kent
State is the only other 0-6
team this season.
Arizona is 5-1-1 overall in
1983, 2-1-1 in Pacific-10 Con
ference play, having beaten
Oregon State (50-6), Utah (38-
0), Washington State (45-6),
and Cal State Fullerton (37-

10), before tying Cal. After
coming back to beat
Colorado State, the Wildcats
lost to Oregon last yveek (19-
10).
While Arizona is on proba
tion and is unable to pby in a
bowl game this seasor>, Smith
refused to blame lack of
motivation for his team's
poor play the past three
weeks.
"It (probation) hurts, but I
don't think that it's been a
factor the last three weeks,"
Smith said. "We have to get
back to having fun on the
field. We have to stay loose."
"I think that they (the
Wildcats) are a good football
team," Wiggin said about
tomorrow's opponent.
"Oregon had an incredible
day. They threyv the timing off
the team (Arizona) early.
Believe me, Arizona is a good
team."
On offense, Arizona relies
on senior quarterback Tom
Tunniclit'fe, possibly the best
quarterback in the Pac-10,
and running back Vance
Johnson.
"Teams are treating Vance
lohnson like teams used to
treat Darrin Nelson for us,"
Wiggin said. "He's an out
standing receiver."
lohnson has rushed for 389
yards in 121 carries and has
eight touchdoyvns. The teams
leading rusher is fullback
Chris Brewer who has 392
yards and sports a 5.5 yard
rushing average.
The Arizona offense has
rushed for 1757 total yards
this season while the Wildcats
have passed for 1147.
"They like to spread you
out," Cardinal defensive back
Dwain Hamilton said of the
Arizona offense. "It is similar

to the way that UCLA does it."
On defense, the Wildcats
are led by All-America
linebacker Ricky Hunley. Last
week, Hunley made 19
tackles, caused one fumble
and made an interception—his
sixth of the year.

"They have a linebacker in
Hunley who is a legitimate
All-America," Wiggin said.
"He made an interception last
week that I couldn't believe."
Last week Washington,
which is not known as a blitz
ing team, harassed Stanford
quarterback John Paye all af
ternoon. Because Arizona is a
blitzing team, Wiggin does
not doubt what he will face
tomorrow.
"They are a blitzing team,"
Wiggin said. "I expect that
same kind of response tomor

row. We're going to have to
deal with that total blitz ap
proach.''
On offense for the Car
dinal, freshman quarterback
John Paye will start again,
despite last week's 4-for-16
performance. "John Paye is
still our No. 1 quarterback,"
Wiggin said.
Stanford's running game,
which has been less than fan
tastic, has hit even harder
times. Fullback Rob Moore
