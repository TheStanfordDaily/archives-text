## Arizona 41, Stanford 27 
### SID SPAETH 
Nov. 6, ICIK21 C IK2 — Bowl-bound
Arizona, capitalizing on key
Stanford late-game blunders,
scored 28 points in the final 12
minutes Saturday to wrestle
an important 41-27 confer
ence win from the tiring Car
dinal.
The Wildcats trailed by 14
points with 12:4b remaining
after Vincent White burst
through the Arizona defense
for a 22-yard touchdown run,
but the Wildcats were about
to break the dike.
Arizona had fourth-and
two at tfie Cardinal 3'i-yard
line when quarterback Tom
Tunnicliffe faked a hand-off
into the line and pulied the
Cardinal secondary in. Tun
nicliffe then stepped back
and lobbed a 67-yard scoring
strike to tight end Mark Keel,
who was 10 vards behind the
Stanford coverage.
"We had a guy (free safety
Vaughn bite on the
running play action," Wiggin
said. "I think that play was the
momentum changer. We
were playing pretty sound
defense up until that point.

That gave them life and put
them back in the ball game."
Arizona quickly shifted into
high gear and, after a Stan
ford punt, drove 78 yards in
10 plays to tie the game.
"They had one good
drive," Wiggin said. "The one
that brought it to a tie was a
sustained well-executed
drive."
Arizona offensive linemen
who had played the Cardinal
defense to a draw for most of
the game, quickly became
dominant. Running backs
Vance Johnson, Brian Hu
land and William Redman
were all key factors in the
drive that ended with a one
yard plunge by Holland be
hind the block of right tackle
Marsharne Craves.
"They were sucking (air)
said Graves, who is from san
Francisco. "We were told at
the beginning of the week
that they weren't a good
fourth quarter team and we
should just go out there and
keep pounding them. We just
went right out there. We
knew we could do it."
