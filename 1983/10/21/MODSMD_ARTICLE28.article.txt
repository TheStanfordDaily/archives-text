The Stanford women's
golf team had a disappoint
ing week in Tulsa for the
Nancy Lopez Invitational, a
20-team tournament that
featured the best teams in
the nation.
It wasn't that the Car
dinal women didn't play
well, it was that they didn't
play at all. Neither did any
of the other 19 teams, as
the tournament was can
celled due to the unusually
heavy rains in Oklahoma
this week.
