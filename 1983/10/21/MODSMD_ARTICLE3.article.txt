# Survey assesses university media policies

Stanford's media access policies at Faculty
Senate meetings are not particularly open or
constrictive in comparison with other leading
universities, according to a survey by the Public
Affairs Office.
While four of the 10 institutions surveyed
have slightly more relaxed press restrictions
than Stanford, another four permit no press
coverage at all. The two other schools have
media access policies similar to those here.
The study was undertaken by Robert Freelen,
vice president for public affairs, after questions
regarding the press policies of other institutions
arose at a meeting of the Faculty Senate Steering
Committee which has been concerned with for
mulating such a policy for Stanford's senate.
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown,
Duke and Dartmouth were included in the sur
vey, in addition to the University of Chicago,
the University of Pennsylvania and the Univer
sity of California.
According to the survey, the faculty senates of
Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania al
low only reporters from internal media into
their meetings, as does Stanford.
Internal newspapers are those associated, di
rectly or indirectly, with a university, such as
Campus Report, the University's newspaper,
and The Daily, a student-run newspaper.
The faculty organizations of Dartmouth,

Brown, Duke and the University of California
campuses permit both internal and outside
press to attend their faculty senate meetings,
but most impose some restrictions on this
coverage.
Under these regulations, faculty members
who speak at Dartmouth faculty meetings can
not be quoted by name, while at Brown no
cameras or electronic devices are allowed into
the meetings.
Duke faculty senate meetings can be con
vened into executive session, in which no press
is allowed. However, the survey says, this is

rarely done on major campus issues; for in
stance, when a proposed Richard Nixon
presidential library was considered by the fac
ulty g'oup the media was admitted.
According to the study, UC schools permit all
press to attend faculty senate meetings, but as
Freelen notes in the report, "a member of the
Berkeley Senate reminded me that most busi
ness is conducted by committees which do not
include members of the press."
Faculty bodies at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and
the University of Chicago have the strictest
media policies, according to the survey. All
media is barred from attending meetings at
these schools, and at Yale access is so limited
that even the president of the university must
obtain an invitation to attend.
In conducting the study, Freelen said that he
"didn't know what to expect," although he was
surprised, he said, that some of the universities
surveyed have no body comparable to Stan
ford's Faculty Senate but instead have meetings
of all or almost all faculty members. Fiowever,
he noted that universities are widely diverse in
the way in which their infrastructure is ar
ranged.
Because of this institutional diversity, he ex
plained, the survey was not conducted to guide
the Faculty Senate Steering Committee in for
mulating a press policy, but to indicate to its
