# Survey assesses university media policies
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Stanford's media access policies at Faculty
Senate meetings are not particularly open or
constrictive in comparison with other leading
universities, according to a survey by the Public
Affairs Office.
While four of the 10 institutions surveyed
have slightly more relaxed press restrictions
than Stanford, another four permit no press
coverage at all. The two other schools have
media access policies similar to those here.
The study was undertaken by Robert Freelen,
vice president for public affairs, after questions
regarding the press policies of other institutions
arose at a meeting of the Faculty Senate Steering
Committee which has been concerned with for
mulating such a policy for Stanford's senate.
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown,
Duke and Dartmouth were included in the sur
vey, in addition to the University of Chicago,
the University of Pennsylvania and the Univer
sity of California.
According to the survey, the faculty senates of
Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania al
low only reporters from internal media into
their meetings, as does Stanford.
Internal newspapers are those associated, di
rectly or indirectly, with a university, such as
Campus Report, the University's newspaper,
and The Daily, a student-run newspaper.
The faculty organizations of Dartmouth,

Brown, Duke and the University of California
campuses permit both internal and outside
press to attend their faculty senate meetings,
but most impose some restrictions on this
coverage.
Under these regulations, faculty members
who speak at Dartmouth faculty meetings can
not be quoted by name, while at Brown no
cameras or electronic devices are allowed into
the meetings.
Duke faculty senate meetings can be con
vened into executive session, in which no press
is allowed. However, the survey says, this is

rarely done on major campus issues; for in
stance, when a proposed Richard Nixon
presidential library was considered by the fac
ulty g'oup the media was admitted.
According to the study, UC schools permit all
press to attend faculty senate meetings, but as
Freelen notes in the report, "a member of the
Berkeley Senate reminded me that most busi
ness is conducted by committees which do not
include members of the press."
Faculty bodies at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and
the University of Chicago have the strictest
media policies, according to the survey. All
media is barred from attending meetings at
these schools, and at Yale access is so limited
that even the president of the university must
obtain an invitation to attend.
In conducting the study, Freelen said that he
"didn't know what to expect," although he was
surprised, he said, that some of the universities
surveyed have no body comparable to Stan
ford's Faculty Senate but instead have meetings
of all or almost all faculty members. Fiowever,
he noted that universities are widely diverse in
the way in which their infrastructure is ar
ranged.
Because of this institutional diversity, he ex
plained, the survey was not conducted to guide
the Faculty Senate Steering Committee in for
mulating a press policy, but to indicate to its


Robert Freelen
members options they might have.
"I'd assume they'd use it and see
how variable other policies are, he
said.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, who
chairs both the Faculty Senate and
the Steering Committee, called the
study "an interesting exercise" but
said that "our decision (will be)
couched in our terms and not what
others do."

He said that the committee's
media policy recommendation
would place greatest weight on the
opinions of senators who, he
asserted, would be most affected by
the policy.
The Steering Committee has
delayed its report on a media policy,
but this occurred, he said, not be
cause of a desire to keep the press
from access to Faculty Senate
meetings on the proposed Reagan
presidential library complex, but be
cause the library issue simply was
considered more important and

thus had priority in the senate.
Heller said that the media policv
issue will be taken up as soon as
possible; the exact date will depend
on how much the Faculty Senate is
able to accomplish at its next
meeting Oct. 27.
Bob Beyers, director of the Uni
versity News Service and the Faculty
Senate information officer, ex
pressed little surprise with the
study's findings. "I expected most
other places would not have as
much open coverage as we do," he
said.

In conducting the study, Freelen said that he
"didn't know what to expect," although he was
surprised, he said, that some of the universities
surveyed have no body comparable to Stan
ford's Faculty Senate but instead have meetings
of all or almost all faculty members. Fiowever,
he noted that universities are widely diverse in
the way in which their infrastructure is ar
ranged.
Because of this institutional diversity, he ex
plained, the survey was not conducted to guide
the Faculty Senate Steering Committee in for
mulating a press policy, but to indicate to its


Robert Freelen
members options they might have.
"I'd assume they'd use it and see
how variable other policies are, he
said.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, who
chairs both the Faculty Senate and
the Steering Committee, called the
study "an interesting exercise" but
said that "our decision (will be)
couched in our terms and not what
others do."

He said that the committee's
media policy recommendation
would place greatest weight on the
opinions of senators who, he
asserted, would be most affected by
the policy.
The Steering Committee has
delayed its report on a media policy,
but this occurred, he said, not be
cause of a desire to keep the press
from access to Faculty Senate
meetings on the proposed Reagan
presidential library complex, but be
cause the library issue simply was
considered more important and

thus had priority in the senate.
Heller said that the media policv
issue will be taken up as soon as
possible; the exact date will depend
on how much the Faculty Senate is
able to accomplish at its next
meeting Oct. 27.
Bob Beyers, director of the Uni
versity News Service and the Faculty
Senate information officer, ex
pressed little surprise with the
study's findings. "I expected most
other places would not have as
much open coverage as we do," he
said.
