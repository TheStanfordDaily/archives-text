Coming off a thrilling fifth
game victory over No. 4
ranked USC Sunday which ex
tended the Cardinal win
streak to 11 matches, the Stan
ford women's volleyball team
hopes to continue its success
at Maples Pavilion against
Arizona tomorrow night at
7:30 p.m., and Arizona State
on Sunday at the same time.
The Arizona match signals
the beginning of the most dif
ficult week in the Card's
schedule. The spikers face
N0.2 University of the Pacific,
UCLA and UC-Berkeley in the
coming seven days.
"We've got a tough
schedule coming up," said
assistant coach Don Shaw.
"All the conference matches
are important."
Leading the WCAA confer
ence with a spotless 6-0
record, the Cardinal must
face Arizona (3-3) and Arizona
State (1-5) on successive
evenings. Though the Card
has beaten both teams earlier
this season , Shaw warned
that the Wildcat and Sun
Devil records are deceiving.
"They are both hot and
cold type squads," he said.
"They might lose poorly one
night and turn around and
pull off an upset the next
night."
Arizona, ranked No. 11 na
tionally, is led by All -
American outside hitter Anita
Moss and middle blocker
Melissa McLinden. Both are
among the WCAA top 10 in
kills, while McLinden is also
tilth in the conference in
blocking.
"Arizona has some great
physical talent. We'll just
have to be ready to play our
best Saturday night," Shaw
said.
The Cardinal has been
playing consistently all
season, and although it plays
five matches in seven days,
Shaw said that he feels the
team will come through. "We
just can't look past these
games (Arizona and Arizona
State). They will be real good
matches."
