# Red Rose for Cincy?

### 
Cincinnati (AP) — The Cin
cinnati Reds said yesterday
they are interested in
talking to Pete Rose about
returning to the team he
left in 1978 after 1b seasons,
but that some of his terms
may be unacceptable.
Reds President Bob Hovv
sam said he had talked on
the telephone with Bill
Giles, president of the
Philadelphia Phillies, who
released Rose on Wednes
day. He also said the Reds
had left a message asking
Rose's lawyer, Reuben J.
katz, to contact the Reds.
Howsam, however, cau
tioned that the Reds may
not be willing to accept all
of Rose's terms, especially
the one demanding that he
be an every-day player.
Rose, 42, has said he
would even consider
switching to the American
League and accepting the
role of designated hitter in
order to find a team that
would play him full time.
Rose wants to break the ali
time record for hits by Ty
Cobb. With 3990 he is 201
hits shy of Cobb's record of
4191. '

"Certainly the Reds
would be interested in
talking with Pete Rose,"
Howsam said. "But it
seems to be the conditions
he has laid down would not
fit our situation that we
have here in Cincinnati. I
can understand what Pete
is looking for and why he
wants it.
"I hope Pete finds what
he is looking for, because
he's been a good player
and good for baseball."
Other teams contacted
by The Associated Press ex
pressed similar reserva
tions about signing Rose,
who has been a first
baseman since he left Cin
cinnati as a free agent in
1978. Rose also played
some 30 games in right field
this season, however.
"If I had a position open,
I'd take him," Chicago
Cubs General Manager Dal
las Green said. "I've got
three first basemen now —
Carmelo Martinez, Bill
Bucknerand Leon Durham.
And over 162 games, it
would be difficult for Pete
to play every day in the out
field."
