# Men face Tigers
## 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
If Stanford sports fans are
still looking for a team that
wins on Saturdays, they need
not look any further.
The Stanford men's soccer
team (9-3-1) is favored in
tomorrow's II a.m. game
against Pacific Soccer Confer
ence opponent the University
of the Pacific Tigers.
UOP is still looking for its
first conference win although
the Tigers are 5-7 in overall
play this season. Ihe ligers
may not lead the conference
in wins, but they do lead the
conference in one depart
ment: individual scoring.
Senior Tiger Da 11 on " D
Duval has recorded seven
goals and nine assists this
season for a total of 23 points.
"He has that unusual combi
nation of speed and skill,"
said UOP's Sports Informa
tion Director Rick Mello. "He
can do it all."
Scoring 75 percent of the
Tiger goals, Duval almost
does do it all. The result is
that teams only have to mark
Duval to shut down UOP's of
fense.

Stanford has lost some of its
individual talent due to injury
which forces them to play as a
team. For example, with Wal
ter kingson out with a leg
contusion, Stanford has made
up for his loss with depth.
Chris Morrow, kingson's
backup, scored two goals
against St. Mary's. "He's
doing an incredible job," said
Stanford Coach Nelson
Lodge. "He'll probably start
on Saturday."
With less experienced
players beginning to play,
Lodge has adjusted to meet
the situation. "With inexperi
enced players there's a ten
dency to lose the midfield,"
Lodge said. "I am putting
Charlie Crane in as a
defender at midfield. It
worked against St. Mary's.
UOP has proved it can play
especially well against
stronger teams. The ligers
lost 2-0 to the highly ranked
University of San Francisco
team â€” and one of those goals
was a penalty kick. The Tigers
will probably keep the game
close unless Stanford shuts
down Duvall, UOP's only of
fensive weapon.
