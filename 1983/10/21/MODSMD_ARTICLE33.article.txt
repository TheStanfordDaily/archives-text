# A 						'gimme' and a 'toughee' for Card

A few weeks ago, Stanford water polo
Coach Dante Dettamanti might have
planned or carving turkey this
Thanksgiving instead of pursuing his
customary holiday duties — guiding the
Cardinal in the NCAA championships.
But after Stanford returned unbeaten
from the PCAA-Pacific-10 Tournament
with wins over teams previously ranked
fourth and seventh and ties with two
clubs rated in the top five nationally Det
tamanti may have to change his
schedule.
"(Those two wins) turned our season
around," said the Stanford mentor. "It
moves us up into a tie (with USC) for fifth
nationally from ninth. But that doesn't
guarantee us anything because the way
this season is going it will probably come
down to the final game of the season."
This week Stanford will get two more
chances to sharpen its skills when it
hosts Santa Clara today at 3 p.m. and No.
8 University of the Pacific tomorrow at 11
a.m. Both matches are at DeCuerre Pool.

According to Dettamanti, these two
games will be the Card's easiest stretch
on a rocky road to the NCAA champion
ships.
"This next three or four weeks is prob
ably the hardest part of the season. We
only play one team outside of the top
five—UOP."
Naturally then, one might conclude
that Santa Clara is a polo power. Think
again. The Broncos apparently do not
count as a "real" opponent.
"Santa Clara's a 'gimme,' " Dettamanti
stated quite matter-of-factly. "They're
the easiest game on our schedule and
we'll play mostly our |Vs."
One varsity player who will see exten
sive playing time on Friday is freshman
Chris Thompson who returns to the
lineup fully recovered from an eye in
jury.
Dettamanti stressed that Thompson
will need a few games to catch up to the
rest of the club. Santa Clara is a start.
"He's missed out on this team's transi
tion. They've improved because they've

played a lot of games together and had a
chance to learn from that experience,"
the coach said.
Thompson's return also spells more
excitement for the Cardinal offense,
led by sophomore Jaime Velez with 29
goals and freshman Mark Imbernino,
who has tallied 28 times.
Thompson "gives us more versatility in
the hole. He's a good passer and an ex
cellent shooter," Dettamanti explained.
"It will also free Imbo (Imbernino) for
driving which adds another dimension
to our offense."
Even with some more offensive punch,
the Card will have to prove that their
rapid ascent into the top five was no
fluke when the UOP Tigers come to
town. Stanford upset UOP last weekend
9-8, storming from behind with six
second-half goals.
Before that game, the Tigers were
rated fourth, but now the shoe is on the
other foot and it is the Cardinal who
must protect their national ranking and
new-found hopes for a playoff berth.
