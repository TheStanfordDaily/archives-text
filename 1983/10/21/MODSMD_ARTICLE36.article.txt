## Hiking in Big Basin: so close and yet so far Redwoods, solitude can help separate self from student 
### MICHAEL HOOD 
Only a couple ot weeks into the
quarter and already the work was
piling up: books to study, papers to
write, reserved readings to put off. I
complained of my all-too-common
predicament to my roommate who
agreed that the pressures were
mounting much too fast for com
fort.
We both knew it was time to
retreat. Or should I sav time for a
retreat? Whichever, it was time to
get off campus, just long enough to
separate the self from the student.
The plan was a backpacking trip to
Big Basin, a state park about an
hour away from Stanford, but cer
tainly located much farther in psy
chic distance.
After minimal preparation Satur
day morning, including packing the
packs and grocery shopping, my
roommate and I were ready to leave
by 9:30 a.m. Big Basin is easily ac
cessible by driving south on Page
Mill Road to Highway 35, heading
southward on 35,and turning west
on 236. After an hour, we were in
the midst of the beautiful redwood
forest of Big Basin.
We checked in at park
headquarters to pick up our per
mits, pay our campsite fee (50 cents
per-person per night), and park the
car ($3 per night). It was advised
that we call ahead for a permit.
Bv 11 a.m., we had started our
hike.
The hike was named the "Skyline
to the Sea" trail, one of the most
popular hikes in the area. A begin
ning to intermediate level trail,
"Skyline to the Sea" requires no
special gear outside of that which
you would need to camp comfor
tably. In addition to the necessary
pack, food and sleeping bag, some
items which can prove useful or en
tertaining include a flashlight, a
Swiss army knife, a rope for
suspending your food, and a map
of the constellations for star
gazing.
Starting at Big Basin

headquarters, we hiked through
the "Rancho del Oso" property
which connects the state park to
the coast. A 12-mile hike in all, we
followed the Waddell Creek Can
yon until we reached Highway 1
and the Waddell Creek Beach.
The trail, well-maintained and
clearly marked, followed the con
tours of the hills among groves of
tall redwoods and green under
brush. The sunlight warmly
flickered through the tops of the
trees to illuminate the many tints of
colors we never seem to notice at
school. The periodic appearance of
ludicrous-looking banana slugs on
the trail kept us from taking the
beauty of the forest too seriously.

We were perturbed by a sign
giving the measurements of red
woods and the occasional markers
designating certain places as
"Memorial Groves." The quiet bril
liance of the forest, however, made
us soon forget the minor man-made
distractions.
The region was first explored by
Captain Caspar de Portola in 1769.
The members of his expedition
paused there for three days to
recuperate from an outbreak of
scurvy. With a population increase
in the Bay Area during the Gold
Rush, the demand for Santa Cruz
Mountains lumber was rampant.
William Waddell first developed
the area, building a lumber mill in

1862. If the fact that Waddell was
later killed by an irate grizzly makes
you fidgety, you'll be relieved to
learn that bears no longer inhabit
the area.
In order to provide a sanctuary
for the few remaining virgin red
woods, the government saved Big
Basin from the lumberjack's saw
and later purchased the Rancho del
Oso from Theodore Hoover
(brother of our own beloved). Big
Basin became the first California
state park in 1902.
We continued on our hiking trek,
stopping for lunch at Berry Creek
Falls. These falls and Silver Falls are
especially popular in the late winter
and early spring when they become

torrents with water plunging more
than 50 feet. Proceeding with the
last leg of our journey, we were
making good time. As Robert Pirsig
wrote, "The emphasis was on good
and not time."
We set camp at Herbert, a shady,
tranquil campground with a faucet
and latrine. Backpacking en
thusiasts who enjoy roughing it
mav be turned off by Big Basin
campgrounds; however, they are
perfect for a casual weekend out
ing.
Our supper consisted of Top
Ramen noodles and cooked
vegetables. The drink complement
ing the meal was Grape Bug Juice
(KooUAid) mixed with Southern

Comfort. Not exactly a drink I
would order in a bar but a good
concoction for the worfds.
After dinner, we took a night hike
down the remaining three miles to
the coast. By moonlight, the forest
loses all colors, transforming into
eerie black and white images.
Beneath stars, we relaxed on the
beach in an ocean breeze, listening
to the steady rumble of the incom
ing tide.
Returning to our campsite, we
slept outside on a very warm night
Morning came and I awoke without
the immediate anxiety about class
attendance or pending assign
ments. The biggest dilemma I was
liable to face all day was scraping
the pot ot noodles from the night
before.
After packing up, we hiked back
to the beach, though the scene was
different this time: Surfers on the
waves and families on the beach.
A suggestion on this hike would
be to either take two cars, leaving
one at park headquarters and one
at the beach, or to catch a Santa
Cruz Transit Bus which stops at
Waddell Creek Beach at scheduled
times (weekends 9:15 and 11:15
a.m.). This bus line would then
transfer you to another bus routed
to park headquarters. (Note: The
5:15 p.m. bus at Waddell Creek
Beach runs too late to make the
connection.)
We missed the buses and hitched
a ride into Santa Cruz, the West
Coast haven tor drifters. We drifted
through Santa Cruz long enough to
catch the bus back to Big Basin. The
bus fares are 50 cents.
Arriving back to campus early
Sunday evening, our weekend
retreat was complete. We returned
a little more relaxed with a better
outlook on the week to come and
with a tale or two to share. If
anyone is interested in more infor
mation on this trip or the many
other hiking trips that are within an
hour of campus, invest in a copy ot
"The Expanded Santa Cruz Moun
tains Trail Book" by Tom Taber (San
Mateo: Oak Valley Press, 1982,
$3.95).

times (weekends 9:15 and 11:15
a.m.). This bus line would then
transfer you to another bus routed
to park headquarters. (Note: The
5:15 p.m. bus at Waddell Creek
Beach runs too late to make the
connection.)
We missed the buses and hitched
a ride into Santa Cruz, the West
Coast haven tor drifters. We drifted
through Santa Cruz long enough to
catch the bus back to Big Basin. The
bus fares are 50 cents.
Arriving back to campus early
Sunday evening, our weekend
retreat was complete. We returned
a little more relaxed with a better
outlook on the week to come and
with a tale or two to share. If
anyone is interested in more infor
mation on this trip or the many
other hiking trips that are within an
hour of campus, invest in a copy ot
"The Expanded Santa Cruz Moun
tains Trail Book" by Tom Taber (San
Mateo: Oak Valley Press, 1982,
$3.95).

Only a couple ot weeks into the
quarter and already the work was
piling up: books to study, papers to
write, reserved readings to put off. I
complained of my all-too-common
predicament to my roommate who
agreed that the pressures were
mounting much too fast for com
fort.
We both knew it was time to
retreat. Or should I sav time for a
retreat? Whichever, it was time to
get off campus, just long enough to
separate the self from the student.
The plan was a backpacking trip to
Big Basin, a state park about an
hour away from Stanford, but cer
tainly located much farther in psy
chic distance.
After minimal preparation Satur
day morning, including packing the
packs and grocery shopping, my
roommate and I were ready to leave
by 9:30 a.m. Big Basin is easily ac
cessible by driving south on Page
Mill Road to Highway 35, heading
southward on 35,and turning west
on 236. After an hour, we were in
the midst of the beautiful redwood
forest of Big Basin.
We checked in at park
headquarters to pick up our per
mits, pay our campsite fee (50 cents
per-person per night), and park the
car ($3 per night). It was advised
that we call ahead for a permit.
Bv 11 a.m., we had started our
hike.
The hike was named the "Skyline
to the Sea" trail, one of the most
popular hikes in the area. A begin
ning to intermediate level trail,
"Skyline to the Sea" requires no
special gear outside of that which
you would need to camp comfor
tably. In addition to the necessary
pack, food and sleeping bag, some
items which can prove useful or en
tertaining include a flashlight, a
Swiss army knife, a rope for
suspending your food, and a map
of the constellations for star
gazing.
Starting at Big Basin

headquarters, we hiked through
the "Rancho del Oso" property
which connects the state park to
the coast. A 12-mile hike in all, we
followed the Waddell Creek Can
yon until we reached Highway 1
and the Waddell Creek Beach.
The trail, well-maintained and
clearly marked, followed the con
tours of the hills among groves of
tall redwoods and green under
brush. The sunlight warmly
flickered through the tops of the
trees to illuminate the many tints of
colors we never seem to notice at
school. The periodic appearance of
ludicrous-looking banana slugs on
the trail kept us from taking the
beauty of the forest too seriously.

We were perturbed by a sign
giving the measurements of red
woods and the occasional markers
designating certain places as
"Memorial Groves." The quiet bril
liance of the forest, however, made
us soon forget the minor man-made
distractions.
The region was first explored by
Captain Caspar de Portola in 1769.
The members of his expedition
paused there for three days to
recuperate from an outbreak of
scurvy. With a population increase
in the Bay Area during the Gold
Rush, the demand for Santa Cruz
Mountains lumber was rampant.
William Waddell first developed
the area, building a lumber mill in

1862. If the fact that Waddell was
later killed by an irate grizzly makes
you fidgety, you'll be relieved to
learn that bears no longer inhabit
the area.
In order to provide a sanctuary
for the few remaining virgin red
woods, the government saved Big
Basin from the lumberjack's saw
and later purchased the Rancho del
Oso from Theodore Hoover
(brother of our own beloved). Big
Basin became the first California
state park in 1902.
We continued on our hiking trek,
stopping for lunch at Berry Creek
Falls. These falls and Silver Falls are
especially popular in the late winter
and early spring when they become

torrents with water plunging more
than 50 feet. Proceeding with the
last leg of our journey, we were
making good time. As Robert Pirsig
wrote, "The emphasis was on good
and not time."
We set camp at Herbert, a shady,
tranquil campground with a faucet
and latrine. Backpacking en
thusiasts who enjoy roughing it
mav be turned off by Big Basin
campgrounds; however, they are
perfect for a casual weekend out
ing.
Our supper consisted of Top
Ramen noodles and cooked
vegetables. The drink complement
ing the meal was Grape Bug Juice
(KooUAid) mixed with Southern

Comfort. Not exactly a drink I
would order in a bar but a good
concoction for the worfds.
After dinner, we took a night hike
down the remaining three miles to
the coast. By moonlight, the forest
loses all colors, transforming into
eerie black and white images.
Beneath stars, we relaxed on the
beach in an ocean breeze, listening
to the steady rumble of the incom
ing tide.
Returning to our campsite, we
slept outside on a very warm night
Morning came and I awoke without
the immediate anxiety about class
attendance or pending assign
ments. The biggest dilemma I was
liable to face all day was scraping
the pot ot noodles from the night
before.
After packing up, we hiked back
to the beach, though the scene was
different this time: Surfers on the
waves and families on the beach.
A suggestion on this hike would
be to either take two cars, leaving
one at park headquarters and one
at the beach, or to catch a Santa
Cruz Transit Bus which stops at
Waddell Creek Beach at scheduled
times (weekends 9:15 and 11:15
a.m.). This bus line would then
transfer you to another bus routed
to park headquarters. (Note: The
