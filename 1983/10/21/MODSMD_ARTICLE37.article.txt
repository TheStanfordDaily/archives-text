# Restaurants
## Quaint, elegant-a favorite restaurant among locals 
### 
Yes, it appears that
the economic recovery has fi
nally arrived. Or so it seemed
last Saturday night at Le Pot
an Feu, "un bon restaurant"
on El Camino Real in Menlo
Park (near the "O"). When we
arrived at this unpretentious

yet elegant restaurant, we
soon realized that it is a favor
ite among the locals of the
Peninsula. We were told that
we would have to wait half an
hour. No need to worry —
there is complimentary wine
to sip while you wait.
Fifteen minutes (and two
glasses of wine) later, the
hostess, a lovely lady who
also manages the restaurant,
escorted us past the kitchen
to our table on the porch un
der the umbrella. The restau
rant, although indoors, has
the atmosphere and appear
ance of an outdoor cafe
(much like the ones you
might frequent in Paris). As is
true in the cafes of France,
the crowd is lively but not
loud. The atmosphere is very
conducive to intimate con
versation.
In addition to the intimate
atmosphere at this quaint res
taurant, the waiters are all
very professional and, to add
to the atmosphere, very

French. We were waited on as
soon as we were seated and
the service was excellent
throughout the entire meal (a
compliment that I rarely give
out). The waiters were at
tentive, however, not too at
tentive.
We began the meal with a
glass of the house wine ("tres
bien"), and the traditional
baguette. As we perused the
menu, we realized that select
ing our meal would not be a
simple task. From the list of
"Les Hors d'Oeuvre" (which
included stuffed clams, escar
gots maison, and veal pate in
a crust), we chose les pates
fraiches au pistou (fresh pasta
pesto, $3.75). (We both lived
in Italy and have an affinity
for pasta.) The pasta was
spinach noodles, which were
cooked perfectly, in a mild
pesto topped with Parmesan
cheese.
After finishing the pasta, we
realized that we were the
"chosen ones" and that we

were in for "une bonne
cuisine." From the long list of
entrees, which includes
soupe du jour, salade
maison, three vegetables and
baguette, we chose "La Longe
d'Agneau" (loin of lamb
stuffed with spinach, $14) and
"Le Saumon en Croute"
(salmon in crust with special
herbs and cream stuffing,
$12.50). The average price for
an entree was $12.50, very
reasonable considering the
quality of the food and the
service.
The soupe du jour, a
creamy pea soup, arrived
soon after we had finished or
dering. It was a light cream
soup that was lightly
seasoned. Delicious.
Next came the salade
maison. It was a simple green
salad with a very good creamy
herb house dressing. (So far,
so good.)
After finishing our discus
sion on the benefits of a Stan
ford education (a discussion

that was prompted by the
thought that we would be
able to go to nice restaurants
like this more often if we were
at UC-Berkeley), we were pre
sented with our entrees, hlave
you ever noticed that the
French don't just give you
your entrees, they present
your entrees to you?
I can best discuss my own
entree. I had the salmon
stuffed in a pastry shell. It was
wonderful. I definitely recom
mend this unique dish if you
eat at Le Pot au Feu, and you
should eat at Le Pot au Feu.
The shell is a flaky pastry in
the shape of a fish. Inside the
shell is moist salmon with
well-selected herbs and on
the side is a cream sauce. The
entrees came with three
vegetables: zucchini, sliced
potatoes and creamed
squash. All of the vegetables
were cooked to perfection
and beautifully displayed. My
date had the loin of lamb,
which he said was tender and

moist.
Finally, the moment that I
had been waiting for all eve
ning (we were seated right
next to the dessert table),
time to order dessert. It was
worth waiting for. It was a
Napolean, a torte with layers
of whipped cream and flaky
pastry. Needless to say, we
enjoyed it. To complement
the sweetness ot the dessert I

had a rich p^nrpcso.

I cannot think of any critical
remarks to make about this
restaurant. All I can say is, if
you're looking for a good res
taurant to spend a romantic
evening, to catch up with an
old friend or to celebrate the
fact that finals are over, this is
a great place. I assure you that
you will not be disappointed.
'Bon appetit!"
