Tucked away behind a well-manicured garden in
the middle of a downtown street, Bagatelle can
definitely be described as a "find. It's the kind ot
place one always hopes to discover in the city, but
rarely does.
Upon entering, we were greeted very pleasantly
by the maitre d', and seated immediately. The res
taurant is not very large, and has the casual
elegance of a country European inn. The decor is
simple and uncluttered (except for a tew countrv
antiques), with gold and white being the primary
colors for the walls and tables. Fortunately/ even
though the restaurant is small, the tables are placed
at a comfortable distance from each other to give
diners a sense of privacy.
Before we ordered, our waiter brought us a bas
ket ot warm sourdough bread, an extra touch par
ticularly appreciated by this rev iew er.
We began our meal with two appetizers — the
shrimp cocktail (Si.75) and escargots de bourgogne
($4). The shrimp, although abundant and covered
with a tangy cocktail sauce, could have been more
flavorful. My first taste of escargot proved to be a
better experience, however. They were cooked in a
rich garlic and butter sauce, perfect for dipping
sourdough bread (as mv partner skillfully demon
strated).
Armetizers are nriced trom S3 to $4.

Fntrees are served with a choice of soup du jour
or salad. Our waiter highly recommended the clam
chowder, a thick, savorv soup with large chunks ot
potatoes and clams. The salad was crisp and tresh,
attractively served with shredded carrots and
shrimp. We also shared an order of crunchy garlic
bread ($1.50).
I ordered one ot the specialties ot the day — tour
nedos with bearnaise and tomato sauce ($12.50).
M\ partner ordered a similar dish — medallions bear
naise, made with tilet mignon. Both dishes were
excellent. The meat was cooked to perfection and
the sauces enhanced the flavor of the meat without
overpowering it.
My entree was served with stuffed mushroom
caps which were covered with the same delicious
sauce. Both entrees came with a choice of potato or
pasta — we opted for the pasta which had sauce a bit
too sweet for our tastes. The entrees were also
served with a vegetable du jour.
The choice ot entrees is quite extensive. Chef's
specialties include canard a I'orange (roast duck
ling) and cuisses de grenouille (frog legs). The
seafood selection includes trout almondine, red
snapper, scallops and prawns.
Bagatelle also otters five different veal selections.
Most entrees are about $10. Broiler selections
range from $7,75 for boeuf bourguignon to $12 for a
New York steak. A final choice of entrees, the

specialties of the day, include roast turkey ($9.50),
roasted leg of lamb ($l2) and (on the night we
dined) prime rib (SM.SO).
Our waiter was efficient and courteous through
out the course of the meal, and was very prompt in
wheeling the dessert cart to our table. From the
mouth-watering selection, I chose mocha
cheesecake ($2.75), a light, flutfy cheesecake on a
chocolate crust. Other possibilities included
amaretto torte, chocolate mousse and plain
cheesecake.
Our meal came to a total of $55 (including a
carafe of house wine and tip) which we thought was
quite reasonable tor the amount and quality of the
food we received.
The manager informed us that Bagatelle has been
in its current location for about four years. It is
frequented primarily by Can Francisco residents
and a few customers from Marin and the Peninsula.
Bagatelle should definitely be placed at the top of
your list of restaurants to try in the city. The atmo
sphere is conducive to a leisurely meal, reminis
cent of those in European cafes, and the food is
characteristically European, prepared bv the chef
with great care and attention to detail.
Bagatelle is open at 5 p.m. every evening for din
ner. and reservations are recommended.

wheeling the dessert cart to our table. From the
mouth-watering selection, I chose mocha
cheesecake ($2.75), a light, flutfy cheesecake on a
chocolate crust. Other possibilities included
amaretto torte, chocolate mousse and plain
cheesecake.
Our meal came to a total of $55 (including a
carafe of house wine and tip) which we thought was
quite reasonable tor the amount and quality of the
food we received.
The manager informed us that Bagatelle has been
in its current location for about four years. It is
frequented primarily by Can Francisco residents
and a few customers from Marin and the Peninsula.
Bagatelle should definitely be placed at the top of
your list of restaurants to try in the city. The atmo
sphere is conducive to a leisurely meal, reminis
cent of those in European cafes, and the food is
characteristically European, prepared bv the chef
with great care and attention to detail.
Bagatelle is open at 5 p.m. every evening for din
ner. and reservations are recommended.
