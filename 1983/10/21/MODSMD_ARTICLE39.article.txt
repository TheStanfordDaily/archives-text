The Seventh Seal (1956)
Festival & New Varsity, Palo
Alto
With this medieval puzzle
drama, Ingmar Bergman rose
to heights that none of his
subsequent "dark" movies,
except for Shame a dozen
years later, has ever equalled.
The knight's chess game with
Death is surely one of the key
images in world cinema, and
the sequence involving the
burning of the young witch
suggests that Bergman may
have been inspired by
Dreyer's Day of Wrath. With
Max vori Sydow as the knight,
Bengt Ekerol as Death, Maud
Hansson as the witch, Bibi An
dersson, Gunnar Bjornstrand
and Nils Poppe.
Plays through Wednesday
with Wild Strawberries
(Festival); Thursday evening
with The Magician (New Var
sity).
The Earrings of Madame de
. . .(1953)
Cubberley High School (4000
Middlefield Road), Palo Alto
Max Ophuls' film of the
Louise de Valmorin novel is
both comic and tragic. The
aristocratic Madame de sells a
pair of diamond earrings, her
husband's wedding gift to her,
to pay her debts; the jewels
change hands with amusing
rapidity, and return to
Madame de as a gift from her
lover. Suddenly they become
meaningful to her. In order to
keep them, she fabricates dif
ferent stories to tell her hus
band and her lover; her hus
band deduces the truth and
confronts her lover, who in
terprets her indiscretion as an
indication of the shallowness
of her love. The astonishingly
deft screenplay suggests de
Maupassant, both in its use of
irony and in its complex emo
tional tone. And Ophuls has
set his film in de Maupassant's
epoch: the late 19th century.
A masterpiece, with peerless
performances by Danielle
Darrieux, Charles Boyer and
Vittorio de Sica.
Plays Wednesday evening.
To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)
kresge Auditorium
Harper Lee probably got the
best ideas for her
autobiographical novel from
Faulkner's Intruder in the
Dust, but To Kill a Mockingbird
has an undeniable appeal
both as a book and in this
rather staid screen adaptation
(by Horton Foote). Gregory
Peck plays the heroic lawyer,
Alticus Finch, who defends a
black man accused of rape in a
small southern town during
the Depression; it's a famous,
lauded performance, but it's
not much more lively than his
usual, sainted liberal acting.
Mary Badham, Philip Alford
and John Megna play the kids
through whose eyes the story
is seen. Directed by Robert
Mullian, who bangs away at
the themes; with Rosemary
Murphy, Frank Overton, Ruth
White and Brock Peters.
Plays tonight.

The Road Warrior (1982)
Memorial Auditorium
Set in Australia in the not
too-distant future, when the
fuel shortage has triggered a
war and the survivors wander
in bands searching for gas to
keep them going. The road is
more or less owned by brutal
marauders, and in the corse of
the film one "family" enlists
the aid of Max (Mel Gibson,
who also played this role in
Mad Max) to defeat their
hoodlum adversaries. The
director, George Miller, is
very talented, and there are
moments of apocalyptic glory
in Dean Semmler's photogra
phy, but the movie is mostly a
long destruction orgy featur
ing bows and arrows and
canon-sized flame throwers.
It's intended to be funny, but
you may not remember that
when you are offered such
delights as a child tossing a
boomerang into the skull of
one of the attackers. In the last
third, the picture has the
nerve to turn self-righteous,
and we are asked to hear
lectures on survival and
despair from characters
dressed like medieval punk
neanderthals.
Plays Sunday evening.
Grand Illusion (1937)
Terman Auditorium
During the First World War,
a band of Frenchmen plot to
escape from a German 1'.0.W
camp; the class bond shared
by their commander, the aris
tocrat de Boeldieu (Pierre
Fresnay), and the German
commandant, von Rauf
fenstein (Erich von Stroheim),
is stronger than the patriotic
ties between de Boeldieu and
the peasant Marechal (Jean
Gabin) or the Jewish bour
geois Rosenthal (Marcel
Dalio). Jean Renoir claimed
that he had made this movie in
order to demonstrate that the
real divisions between men
are "horizontal rather than
vertical," and it is not only
one of the most extraordinary
examinations of class distinc
tions ever filmed, but also one
of the greatest anti-war films.
No one who has seen it is
likely to forget the love scene
between Gabin and the Ger
man frau (Dita Parlo), or the
moment when Stroheim, after
Fresnay's death, cuts the
geranium on his windowsill.
Charles Spaak collaborated
with Renoir on the script;
Christian Matras shot it; and
Joseph kosma wrote the
score.
Plays Tuesday evening.
Bananas(l97l)
Cubberley Auditorium
Woody Allen's funniest
movie (co-written with Mickey
Rose). Much of it takes place in
a banana republic where
Woody is fighting for the
revolution; there is also a
screwball courtroom se
quence in the second half that
is a classic. Louise Lasser co
stars as a woman whose every
action seems to be a parody of
something in an Ingmar
Bergman picture. Ihe direc

tion and photography are
clumsy beyond the telling, but
most of the time you're too
helpless with laughter to
notice.
Plays tonight with 7he Loved
One.
The Loved One (1965)
Cubberley Auditorium
Tony Richardson's film ver
sion of the famous Evelyn
Waugh satire on Southern Cal
ifornia, set at a pet cemetery,
is truly wretched; it's also hys
terically funny. Terry South
ern and Christopher
Isherwood co-wrote the
screenplay, and you wouldn't
believe the people who show
up in it: Robert Morse, Jonat
han Winters, Robert Morley,
Roddy McDowall, Barbara
Nichols, Anjanette Comer,
Dana Andrews, Milton Berle,
lames Coburn, )ohn Cielgud,
Margaret Leighton, Rod
Steiger, Tab Hunter, Lionel
Stander, and even Liberace,
who demonstrates caskets.
Plays tonight with Bananas.

Saturday Night Fever(l977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In many ways this disco mu
sical isn't a very good movie,
but it has so much passion and
high spirits that you watch it
with a kind of glee, as you
would an Astaire-Rogers
picture. John Travolta gives a
star performance as Tony
Manero, who escapes his
draggy Brooklyn existence by
commandeering the local
disco floor one pight a week. If
you think he's not acting — that
he's gliding through the movie
on his personality alone — note
the way his whole bqdy shifts
when he enters the disco,
where he can relax and reign.
That's acting. Karen Lynn Gor-

ney plays the sweetly preten
tious woman Tony falls for;
their scenes together have a
touching freshness. John Bad
ham directed, from Norman
Wexler's script (based on a Nik
Cohn article), and Lester Wil
son choreographed the
fabulous numbers, to infec
tious music by The Bee Gees.
The supporting cast includes
Donna Pescow, Julie Bovasso,

Fran Drescher and Barry Mil
ler.
Plays tonight with Staymi
Alive.
The Phantom of Libert'
(1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Luis Bunuel's movies
anecdotes peripheral to thi
main action are often amonj
the highlights. This off-the-cuf
comedy is all anecdotes. Thi
structure is a lateral movemen
from one story to another sug
gested by a detail in the lirst
the joke is that nothing come

along — a character, a theme,
even a plot device — to tie all the
episodes toether, except that
they all operate on the princi
ple of surprise reversal. Unfor
tunately, very few of the
scenes are genuinely funny.
(One about a missing child is
amusing, and there is one gem

in the collection, depicting a
society in which the bathroom
has become a highly public
chamber, while people eat,
slightly embarrassed, in
private.) The impressive cast
includes Adriana Asti, Jean-
Claude Brialy, Adolfo Celi,
Michel Lonsdale, Julien Ber
theau, Michel Piccoli, Jean
Rochefort, Bernard Verley and
Monica Vitti. Jean-Claude Car
riere worked on the screenplay
with Bunuel.
Plays Monday evening with
The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie.
Staying Alive (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In this Sylvester Stallone
directed sequel to Saturday
Night Fever, the energy comes
pre-packagfd, like the back
stage love-triangle plot; the
songs (some by the Bee Gees,
others by Stallone's brother
Frank) are second-rate; and
the choreography is so silly
that you can't tell if it's well ex
ecuted or not. John Travolta,
terrifically charming but basi
cally regressing, plays Tony
Manero once again; this time
around Tony lands a role in an
all-dance Broadwav show
called Satan's Alley a choreo
grapher's vision of hell which
bears some resemblance to the
out-of-town disaster satirized
in The Band Wagon. Only this
show is a hit: Stallone and his
co-writer, Norman Wexler,
have no sense of irony. Co
starring Cynthia Rhoes and
Finola Hughes, who seems in
tent on challenging Ali
McGraw's status as the worst
actress in Hollywood.
Plays tonight with Saturday
Night Fever.
La Cage aux Folles (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script by Jean Poiret,
Edouard Molinaro, Francis
Veber and Marcello Danon is
the cleverest variation yet on
the oft-tried comic theme of
the parent who pretends to be
something he is not for the
good of his child. (Damon
Runyon may have been the
first to use it, in his story
"Madam La Gimp.") Ugo Tog
nazzi plays Renato, whose son
has just become engaged to
the daughter of a reactionary,
highly placed government offi
cial. The girl's parents naturally
wish to meet their intended in
law, but that poses a delicate
problem: Renato is an avowed
homosexual who lives with his
long-time lover, Albin, played
by Michel Serrault (who gives a
magnificent comic perfor
mance). The direction (by
Molinaro) is sloppy, and Ihe
stage origins are uncomfor
tably clear in the structure of
some of the scenes, but these
flaws seem terribly unimpor
tant when Serrault is on
screen. When he walks, every
movable part of his body flut
ters through a series of care
fully prearranged poses; he
gets more comic mileage out
of his clothing than almost any
other actor ever has.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with La Cage aux Folles 11.

Daniel (1981)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
E.L.Doctorow's novel The
Book of Daniel was an epic
construction that bridged the
two great eras of American
socialism by postulating that
the children of Communists
executed for conspiracy in the
early 1950s might become the
protesters of the Vietnam
years. The movie, adapted by
Doctorow and directed by Sid
ney Lumet, offers large chunks
of the book, delivered by a
huge, impressive cast, and it
contains moments of un
deniable power. But it's mostly
an incoherent jumble, full of
confused signals and halt
formed ideas. There's an unfat
homable flshback structure,
and Lumet's catch-as-catch-can
technique garbles the meaning
of what he has assembled and
plays hell with the perfor
mances.Though they are
poorly lit, haphazardly
costumed, and carelessly shot,
four actresses perform
memorably: Amanda Plum
mer, Lindsay Crouse, Ellen
Barkin and Julie Bovasso. With
Timothy Hutton as Daniel,
Mandy Patinkin, Edward Asner
and many others.
La Cage aux Folles 11 (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Albin (Michel Serrault) and
Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) could
become the Abbott and Cos
tello for the 80s, but not with
material like this tedious spy
thriller-comedy. The few
bright moments are buried un
der the pedestrian, im
plausible plot and the
surprisingly softheaded treat
ment of the relationship be
tween the two men. There is
some Cay Liberation
grandstanding that is notably
sour and lacking in sensitivity.
Directed by Edouard
Molinaro; screenplay by
Francis Veber, jean Poiret and
Marcello Danon.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with La Cage aux Folles.
Risky Business (1983)
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
This teen comedy, written
and directed by Paul Brickman,
has its own style and, in the
nighttime exteriors, an eerily
erotic dream landscape.
(Reynaldo Villalobos and Bruce
Surtees share credit for the
photography.) Brickman
demonstrates wit in a few
silent sequences, and there's a
wonderful scene in which his
hero, |oel (played by a winning
ail-American suburban type
named Tom Cruise), free from
the constraints imposed on
him by his parents, who are
now on vacation, dances
around the living room in his
underwear, miming the words
to a Bob Seger song. But this
film about a high school senior
who somehow winds up
managing a whorehouse in his
parents' home is indifferently
written and — except for Cruise
flatly acted. Furthermore, the
way in which it is pointed
squarely at the wish fulfillment
fantasies of its adolescent
audiences is a little dispiriting.

fuel shortage has triggered a
war and the survivors wander
in bands searching for gas to
keep them going. The road is
more or less owned by brutal
marauders, and in the corse of
the film one "family" enlists
the aid of Max (Mel Gibson,
who also played this role in
Mad Max) to defeat their
hoodlum adversaries. The
director, George Miller, is
very talented, and there are
moments of apocalyptic glory
in Dean Semmler's photogra
phy, but the movie is mostly a
long destruction orgy featur
ing bows and arrows and
canon-sized flame throwers.
It's intended to be funny, but
you may not remember that
when you are offered such
delights as a child tossing a
boomerang into the skull of
one of the attackers. In the last
third, the picture has the
nerve to turn self-righteous,
and we are asked to hear
lectures on survival and
despair from characters
dressed like medieval punk
neanderthals.
Plays Sunday evening.
Grand Illusion (1937)
Terman Auditorium
During the First World War,
a band of Frenchmen plot to
escape from a German 1'.0.W
camp; the class bond shared
by their commander, the aris
tocrat de Boeldieu (Pierre
Fresnay), and the German
commandant, von Rauf
fenstein (Erich von Stroheim),
is stronger than the patriotic
ties between de Boeldieu and
the peasant Marechal (Jean
Gabin) or the Jewish bour
geois Rosenthal (Marcel
Dalio). Jean Renoir claimed
that he had made this movie in
order to demonstrate that the
real divisions between men
are "horizontal rather than
vertical," and it is not only
one of the most extraordinary
examinations of class distinc
tions ever filmed, but also one
of the greatest anti-war films.
No one who has seen it is
likely to forget the love scene
between Gabin and the Ger
man frau (Dita Parlo), or the
moment when Stroheim, after
Fresnay's death, cuts the
geranium on his windowsill.
Charles Spaak collaborated
with Renoir on the script;
Christian Matras shot it; and
Joseph kosma wrote the
score.
Plays Tuesday evening.
Bananas(l97l)
Cubberley Auditorium
Woody Allen's funniest
movie (co-written with Mickey
Rose). Much of it takes place in
a banana republic where
Woody is fighting for the
revolution; there is also a
screwball courtroom se
quence in the second half that
is a classic. Louise Lasser co
stars as a woman whose every
action seems to be a parody of
something in an Ingmar
Bergman picture. Ihe direc

tion and photography are
clumsy beyond the telling, but
most of the time you're too
helpless with laughter to
notice.
Plays tonight with 7he Loved
One.
The Loved One (1965)
Cubberley Auditorium
Tony Richardson's film ver
sion of the famous Evelyn
Waugh satire on Southern Cal
ifornia, set at a pet cemetery,
is truly wretched; it's also hys
terically funny. Terry South
ern and Christopher
Isherwood co-wrote the
screenplay, and you wouldn't
believe the people who show
up in it: Robert Morse, Jonat
han Winters, Robert Morley,
Roddy McDowall, Barbara
Nichols, Anjanette Comer,
Dana Andrews, Milton Berle,
lames Coburn, )ohn Cielgud,
Margaret Leighton, Rod
Steiger, Tab Hunter, Lionel
Stander, and even Liberace,
who demonstrates caskets.

Saturday Night Fever(l977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In many ways this disco mu
sical isn't a very good movie,
but it has so much passion and
high spirits that you watch it
with a kind of glee, as you
would an Astaire-Rogers
picture. John Travolta gives a
star performance as Tony
Manero, who escapes his
draggy Brooklyn existence by
commandeering the local
disco floor one pight a week. If
you think he's not acting — that
he's gliding through the movie
on his personality alone — note
the way his whole bqdy shifts
when he enters the disco,
where he can relax and reign.
That's acting. Karen Lynn Gor-

ney plays the sweetly preten
tious woman Tony falls for;
their scenes together have a
touching freshness. John Bad
ham directed, from Norman
Wexler's script (based on a Nik
Cohn article), and Lester Wil
son choreographed the
fabulous numbers, to infec
tious music by The Bee Gees.
The supporting cast includes
Donna Pescow, Julie Bovasso,

Fran Drescher and Barry Mil
ler.
Plays tonight with Staymi
Alive.
The Phantom of Libert'
(1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Luis Bunuel's movies
anecdotes peripheral to thi
main action are often amonj
the highlights. This off-the-cuf
comedy is all anecdotes. Thi
structure is a lateral movemen
from one story to another sug
gested by a detail in the lirst
the joke is that nothing come

along — a character, a theme,
even a plot device — to tie all the
episodes toether, except that
they all operate on the princi
ple of surprise reversal. Unfor
tunately, very few of the
scenes are genuinely funny.
(One about a missing child is
amusing, and there is one gem

in the collection, depicting a
society in which the bathroom
has become a highly public
chamber, while people eat,
slightly embarrassed, in
private.) The impressive cast
includes Adriana Asti, Jean-
Claude Brialy, Adolfo Celi,
Michel Lonsdale, Julien Ber
theau, Michel Piccoli, Jean
Rochefort, Bernard Verley and
Monica Vitti. Jean-Claude Car
riere worked on the screenplay
with Bunuel.
Plays Monday evening with
The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie.
Staying Alive (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In this Sylvester Stallone
directed sequel to Saturday
Night Fever, the energy comes
pre-packagfd, like the back
stage love-triangle plot; the
songs (some by the Bee Gees,
others by Stallone's brother
Frank) are second-rate; and
the choreography is so silly
that you can't tell if it's well ex
ecuted or not. John Travolta,
terrifically charming but basi
cally regressing, plays Tony
Manero once again; this time
around Tony lands a role in an
all-dance Broadwav show
called Satan's Alley a choreo
grapher's vision of hell which
bears some resemblance to the
out-of-town disaster satirized
in The Band Wagon. Only this
show is a hit: Stallone and his
co-writer, Norman Wexler,
have no sense of irony. Co
starring Cynthia Rhoes and
Finola Hughes, who seems in
tent on challenging Ali
McGraw's status as the worst
actress in Hollywood.
Plays tonight with Saturday
Night Fever.
La Cage aux Folles (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script by Jean Poiret,
Edouard Molinaro, Francis
Veber and Marcello Danon is
the cleverest variation yet on
the oft-tried comic theme of
the parent who pretends to be
something he is not for the
good of his child. (Damon
Runyon may have been the
first to use it, in his story
"Madam La Gimp.") Ugo Tog
nazzi plays Renato, whose son
has just become engaged to
the daughter of a reactionary,
highly placed government offi
cial. The girl's parents naturally
wish to meet their intended in
law, but that poses a delicate
problem: Renato is an avowed
homosexual who lives with his
long-time lover, Albin, played
by Michel Serrault (who gives a
magnificent comic perfor
mance). The direction (by
Molinaro) is sloppy, and Ihe
stage origins are uncomfor
tably clear in the structure of
some of the scenes, but these
flaws seem terribly unimpor
tant when Serrault is on
screen. When he walks, every
movable part of his body flut
ters through a series of care
fully prearranged poses; he
gets more comic mileage out
of his clothing than almost any
other actor ever has.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with La Cage aux Folles 11.

Daniel (1981)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
E.L.Doctorow's novel The
Book of Daniel was an epic
construction that bridged the
two great eras of American
socialism by postulating that
the children of Communists
executed for conspiracy in the
early 1950s might become the
protesters of the Vietnam
years. The movie, adapted by
Doctorow and directed by Sid
ney Lumet, offers large chunks
of the book, delivered by a
huge, impressive cast, and it
contains moments of un
deniable power. But it's mostly
an incoherent jumble, full of
confused signals and halt
formed ideas. There's an unfat
homable flshback structure,
and Lumet's catch-as-catch-can
technique garbles the meaning
of what he has assembled and
plays hell with the perfor
mances.Though they are
poorly lit, haphazardly
costumed, and carelessly shot,
four actresses perform
memorably: Amanda Plum
mer, Lindsay Crouse, Ellen
Barkin and Julie Bovasso. With
Timothy Hutton as Daniel,
Mandy Patinkin, Edward Asner
and many others.
La Cage aux Folles 11 (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Albin (Michel Serrault) and
Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) could
become the Abbott and Cos
tello for the 80s, but not with
material like this tedious spy
thriller-comedy. The few
bright moments are buried un
der the pedestrian, im
plausible plot and the
surprisingly softheaded treat
ment of the relationship be
tween the two men. There is
some Cay Liberation
grandstanding that is notably
sour and lacking in sensitivity.
Directed by Edouard
Molinaro; screenplay by
Francis Veber, jean Poiret and
Marcello Danon.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with La Cage aux Folles.
Risky Business (1983)
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
This teen comedy, written
and directed by Paul Brickman,
has its own style and, in the
nighttime exteriors, an eerily
erotic dream landscape.
(Reynaldo Villalobos and Bruce
Surtees share credit for the
photography.) Brickman
demonstrates wit in a few
silent sequences, and there's a
wonderful scene in which his
hero, |oel (played by a winning
ail-American suburban type
named Tom Cruise), free from
the constraints imposed on
him by his parents, who are
now on vacation, dances
around the living room in his
underwear, miming the words
to a Bob Seger song. But this
film about a high school senior
who somehow winds up
managing a whorehouse in his
parents' home is indifferently
written and — except for Cruise
flatly acted. Furthermore, the
way in which it is pointed
squarely at the wish fulfillment
fantasies of its adolescent
audiences is a little dispiriting.

The Seventh Seal (1956)
Festival & New Varsity, Palo
Alto
With this medieval puzzle
drama, Ingmar Bergman rose
to heights that none of his
subsequent "dark" movies,
except for Shame a dozen
years later, has ever equalled.
The knight's chess game with
Death is surely one of the key
images in world cinema, and
the sequence involving the
burning of the young witch
suggests that Bergman may
have been inspired by
Dreyer's Day of Wrath. With
Max vori Sydow as the knight,
Bengt Ekerol as Death, Maud
Hansson as the witch, Bibi An
dersson, Gunnar Bjornstrand
and Nils Poppe.
Plays through Wednesday

(Festival); Thursday evening

sity).
The Earrings of Madame de
. . .(1953)
Cubberley High School (4000
Middlefield Road), Palo Alto
Max Ophuls' film of the
Louise de Valmorin novel is
both comic and tragic. The
aristocratic Madame de sells a
pair of diamond earrings, her
husband's wedding gift to her,
to pay her debts; the jewels
change hands with amusing
rapidity, and return to
Madame de as a gift from her
lover. Suddenly they become
meaningful to her. In order to
keep them, she fabricates dif
ferent stories to tell her hus
band and her lover; her hus
band deduces the truth and
confronts her lover, who in
terprets her indiscretion as an
indication of the shallowness
of her love. The astonishingly
deft screenplay suggests de
Maupassant, both in its use of
irony and in its complex emo
tional tone. And Ophuls has
set his film in de Maupassant's
epoch: the late 19th century.
A masterpiece, with peerless
performances by Danielle
Darrieux, Charles Boyer and
Vittorio de Sica.
Plays Wednesday evening.
To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)
kresge Auditorium
Harper Lee probably got the
best ideas for her
autobiographical novel from
Faulkner's Intruder in the
Dust, but To Kill a Mockingbird
has an undeniable appeal
both as a book and in this
rather staid screen adaptation
(by Horton Foote). Gregory
Peck plays the heroic lawyer,
Alticus Finch, who defends a
black man accused of rape in a
small southern town during
the Depression; it's a famous,
lauded performance, but it's
not much more lively than his
usual, sainted liberal acting.
Mary Badham, Philip Alford
and John Megna play the kids
through whose eyes the story
is seen. Directed by Robert
Mullian, who bangs away at
the themes; with Rosemary
Murphy, Frank Overton, Ruth
White and Brock Peters.
Plays tonight.

Cubberley Auditorium
Tony Richardson's film ver
sion of the famous Evelyn
Waugh satire on Southern Cal
ifornia, set at a pet cemetery,
is truly wretched; it's also hys
terically funny. Terry South

Roddy McDowall, Barbara

Saturday Night Fever(l977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In many ways this disco mu
sical isn't a very good movie,
but it has so much passion and
high spirits that you watch it
with a kind of glee, as you
would an Astaire-Rogers
picture. John Travolta gives a
star performance as Tony
Manero, who escapes his
draggy Brooklyn existence by
commandeering the local
disco floor one pight a week. If
you think he's not acting — that
he's gliding through the movie
on his personality alone — note
the way his whole bqdy shifts
when he enters the disco,
where he can relax and reign.
That's acting. Karen Lynn Gor-

ney plays the sweetly preten
tious woman Tony falls for;
their scenes together have a
touching freshness. John Bad
ham directed, from Norman
Wexler's script (based on a Nik
Cohn article), and Lester Wil
son choreographed the
fabulous numbers, to infec
tious music by The Bee Gees.
The supporting cast includes
Donna Pescow, Julie Bovasso,

Fran Drescher and Barry Mil
ler.
Plays tonight with Staymi
Alive.
The Phantom of Libert'
(1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Luis Bunuel's movies
anecdotes peripheral to thi
main action are often amonj
the highlights. This off-the-cuf
comedy is all anecdotes. Thi
structure is a lateral movemen
from one story to another sug
gested by a detail in the lirst
the joke is that nothing come

along — a character, a theme,
even a plot device — to tie all the
episodes toether, except that
they all operate on the princi
ple of surprise reversal. Unfor
tunately, very few of the
scenes are genuinely funny.
(One about a missing child is
amusing, and there is one gem

in the collection, depicting a
society in which the bathroom
has become a highly public
chamber, while people eat,
slightly embarrassed, in
private.) The impressive cast
includes Adriana Asti, Jean-
Claude Brialy, Adolfo Celi,
Michel Lonsdale, Julien Ber
theau, Michel Piccoli, Jean
Rochefort, Bernard Verley and
Monica Vitti. Jean-Claude Car
riere worked on the screenplay
with Bunuel.
Plays Monday evening with
The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie.
Staying Alive (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In this Sylvester Stallone
directed sequel to Saturday
Night Fever, the energy comes
pre-packagfd, like the back
stage love-triangle plot; the
songs (some by the Bee Gees,
others by Stallone's brother
Frank) are second-rate; and
the choreography is so silly
that you can't tell if it's well ex
ecuted or not. John Travolta,
terrifically charming but basi
cally regressing, plays Tony
Manero once again; this time
around Tony lands a role in an
all-dance Broadwav show
called Satan's Alley a choreo
grapher's vision of hell which
bears some resemblance to the
out-of-town disaster satirized
in The Band Wagon. Only this
show is a hit: Stallone and his
co-writer, Norman Wexler,
have no sense of irony. Co
starring Cynthia Rhoes and
Finola Hughes, who seems in
tent on challenging Ali
McGraw's status as the worst
actress in Hollywood.
Plays tonight with Saturday
Night Fever.
La Cage aux Folles (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script by Jean Poiret,
Edouard Molinaro, Francis
Veber and Marcello Danon is
the cleverest variation yet on
the oft-tried comic theme of
the parent who pretends to be
something he is not for the
good of his child. (Damon
Runyon may have been the
first to use it, in his story
"Madam La Gimp.") Ugo Tog
nazzi plays Renato, whose son
has just become engaged to
the daughter of a reactionary,
highly placed government offi
cial. The girl's parents naturally
wish to meet their intended in
law, but that poses a delicate
problem: Renato is an avowed
homosexual who lives with his
long-time lover, Albin, played
by Michel Serrault (who gives a
magnificent comic perfor
mance). The direction (by
Molinaro) is sloppy, and Ihe
stage origins are uncomfor
tably clear in the structure of
some of the scenes, but these
flaws seem terribly unimpor
tant when Serrault is on
screen. When he walks, every
movable part of his body flut
ters through a series of care
fully prearranged poses; he
gets more comic mileage out
of his clothing than almost any
other actor ever has.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with La Cage aux Folles 11.

Daniel (1981)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
E.L.Doctorow's novel The
Book of Daniel was an epic
construction that bridged the
two great eras of American
socialism by postulating that
the children of Communists
executed for conspiracy in the
early 1950s might become the
protesters of the Vietnam
years. The movie, adapted by
Doctorow and directed by Sid
ney Lumet, offers large chunks
of the book, delivered by a
huge, impressive cast, and it
contains moments of un
deniable power. But it's mostly
an incoherent jumble, full of
confused signals and halt
formed ideas. There's an unfat
homable flshback structure,
and Lumet's catch-as-catch-can
technique garbles the meaning
of what he has assembled and
plays hell with the perfor
mances.Though they are
poorly lit, haphazardly
costumed, and carelessly shot,
four actresses perform
memorably: Amanda Plum
mer, Lindsay Crouse, Ellen
Barkin and Julie Bovasso. With
Timothy Hutton as Daniel,
Mandy Patinkin, Edward Asner
and many others.
La Cage aux Folles 11 (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Albin (Michel Serrault) and
Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) could
become the Abbott and Cos
tello for the 80s, but not with
material like this tedious spy
thriller-comedy. The few
bright moments are buried un
der the pedestrian, im
plausible plot and the
surprisingly softheaded treat
ment of the relationship be
tween the two men. There is
some Cay Liberation
grandstanding that is notably
sour and lacking in sensitivity.
Directed by Edouard
Molinaro; screenplay by
Francis Veber, jean Poiret and
Marcello Danon.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with La Cage aux Folles.
Risky Business (1983)
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
This teen comedy, written
and directed by Paul Brickman,
has its own style and, in the
nighttime exteriors, an eerily
erotic dream landscape.
(Reynaldo Villalobos and Bruce
Surtees share credit for the
photography.) Brickman
demonstrates wit in a few
silent sequences, and there's a
wonderful scene in which his
hero, |oel (played by a winning
ail-American suburban type
named Tom Cruise), free from
the constraints imposed on
him by his parents, who are
now on vacation, dances
around the living room in his
underwear, miming the words
to a Bob Seger song. But this
film about a high school senior
who somehow winds up
managing a whorehouse in his
parents' home is indifferently
written and — except for Cruise
flatly acted. Furthermore, the
way in which it is pointed
squarely at the wish fulfillment
fantasies of its adolescent
audiences is a little dispiriting.

The Seventh Seal (1956)
Festival & New Varsity, Palo
Alto
With this medieval puzzle
drama, Ingmar Bergman rose
to heights that none of his
subsequent "dark" movies,
except for Shame a dozen
years later, has ever equalled.
The knight's chess game with
Death is surely one of the key
images in world cinema, and
the sequence involving the
burning of the young witch
suggests that Bergman may
have been inspired by
Dreyer's Day of Wrath. With
Max vori Sydow as the knight,
Bengt Ekerol as Death, Maud
Hansson as the witch, Bibi An
dersson, Gunnar Bjornstrand
and Nils Poppe.
Plays through Wednesday
with Wild Strawberries
(Festival); Thursday evening
with The Magician (New Var
sity).
The Earrings of Madame de
. . .(1953)
Cubberley High School (4000
Middlefield Road), Palo Alto
Max Ophuls' film of the
Louise de Valmorin novel is
both comic and tragic. The
aristocratic Madame de sells a
pair of diamond earrings, her
husband's wedding gift to her,
to pay her debts; the jewels
change hands with amusing
rapidity, and return to
Madame de as a gift from her
lover. Suddenly they become
meaningful to her. In order to
keep them, she fabricates dif
ferent stories to tell her hus
band and her lover; her hus
band deduces the truth and
confronts her lover, who in
terprets her indiscretion as an
indication of the shallowness
of her love. The astonishingly
deft screenplay suggests de
Maupassant, both in its use of
irony and in its complex emo
tional tone. And Ophuls has
set his film in de Maupassant's
epoch: the late 19th century.
A masterpiece, with peerless
performances by Danielle
Darrieux, Charles Boyer and
Vittorio de Sica.
Plays Wednesday evening.
To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)
kresge Auditorium
Harper Lee probably got the
best ideas for her
autobiographical novel from
Faulkner's Intruder in the
Dust, but To Kill a Mockingbird
has an undeniable appeal
both as a book and in this
rather staid screen adaptation
(by Horton Foote). Gregory
Peck plays the heroic lawyer,
Alticus Finch, who defends a
black man accused of rape in a
small southern town during
the Depression; it's a famous,
lauded performance, but it's
not much more lively than his
usual, sainted liberal acting.
Mary Badham, Philip Alford
and John Megna play the kids
through whose eyes the story
is seen. Directed by Robert
Mullian, who bangs away at
the themes; with Rosemary
Murphy, Frank Overton, Ruth
White and Brock Peters.
Plays tonight.

The Road Warrior (1982)
Memorial Auditorium
Set in Australia in the not
too-distant future, when the
fuel shortage has triggered a
war and the survivors wander
in bands searching for gas to
keep them going. The road is
more or less owned by brutal
marauders, and in the corse of
the film one "family" enlists
the aid of Max (Mel Gibson,
who also played this role in
Mad Max) to defeat their
hoodlum adversaries. The
director, George Miller, is
very talented, and there are
moments of apocalyptic glory
in Dean Semmler's photogra
phy, but the movie is mostly a
long destruction orgy featur
ing bows and arrows and
canon-sized flame throwers.
It's intended to be funny, but
you may not remember that
when you are offered such
delights as a child tossing a
boomerang into the skull of
one of the attackers. In the last
third, the picture has the
nerve to turn self-righteous,
and we are asked to hear
lectures on survival and
despair from characters
dressed like medieval punk
neanderthals.
Plays Sunday evening.
Grand Illusion (1937)
Terman Auditorium
During the First World War,
a band of Frenchmen plot to
escape from a German 1'.0.W
camp; the class bond shared
by their commander, the aris
tocrat de Boeldieu (Pierre
Fresnay), and the German
commandant, von Rauf
fenstein (Erich von Stroheim),
is stronger than the patriotic
ties between de Boeldieu and
the peasant Marechal (Jean
Gabin) or the Jewish bour
geois Rosenthal (Marcel
Dalio). Jean Renoir claimed
that he had made this movie in
order to demonstrate that the
real divisions between men
are "horizontal rather than
vertical," and it is not only
one of the most extraordinary
examinations of class distinc
tions ever filmed, but also one
of the greatest anti-war films.
No one who has seen it is
likely to forget the love scene
between Gabin and the Ger
man frau (Dita Parlo), or the
moment when Stroheim, after
Fresnay's death, cuts the
geranium on his windowsill.
Charles Spaak collaborated
with Renoir on the script;
Christian Matras shot it; and
Joseph kosma wrote the
score.
Plays Tuesday evening.
Bananas(l97l)
Cubberley Auditorium
Woody Allen's funniest
movie (co-written with Mickey
Rose). Much of it takes place in
a banana republic where
Woody is fighting for the
revolution; there is also a
screwball courtroom se
quence in the second half that
is a classic. Louise Lasser co
stars as a woman whose every
action seems to be a parody of
something in an Ingmar
Bergman picture. Ihe direc

tion and photography are
clumsy beyond the telling, but
most of the time you're too
helpless with laughter to
notice.

Rochefort, Bernard Verley and
Monica Vitti. Jean-Claude Car
riere worked on the screenplay
with Bunuel.
Plays Monday evening with
The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie.
Staying Alive (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In this Sylvester Stallone
directed sequel to Saturday
Night Fever, the energy comes
pre-packagfd, like the back
stage love-triangle plot; the
songs (some by the Bee Gees,
others by Stallone's brother
Frank) are second-rate; and
the choreography is so silly
that you can't tell if it's well ex
ecuted or not. John Travolta,
terrifically charming but basi
cally regressing, plays Tony
Manero once again; this time
around Tony lands a role in an
all-dance Broadwav show
called Satan's Alley a choreo
grapher's vision of hell which
bears some resemblance to the
out-of-town disaster satirized
in The Band Wagon. Only this
show is a hit: Stallone and his
co-writer, Norman Wexler,
have no sense of irony. Co
starring Cynthia Rhoes and
Finola Hughes, who seems in
tent on challenging Ali
McGraw's status as the worst
actress in Hollywood.
Plays tonight with Saturday
Night Fever.
La Cage aux Folles (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script by Jean Poiret,
Edouard Molinaro, Francis
Veber and Marcello Danon is
the cleverest variation yet on
the oft-tried comic theme of
the parent who pretends to be
something he is not for the
good of his child. (Damon
Runyon may have been the
first to use it, in his story
"Madam La Gimp.") Ugo Tog
nazzi plays Renato, whose son
has just become engaged to
the daughter of a reactionary,
highly placed government offi
cial. The girl's parents naturally
wish to meet their intended in
law, but that poses a delicate
problem: Renato is an avowed
homosexual who lives with his
long-time lover, Albin, played
by Michel Serrault (who gives a
magnificent comic perfor
mance). The direction (by
Molinaro) is sloppy, and Ihe
stage origins are uncomfor
tably clear in the structure of
some of the scenes, but these
flaws seem terribly unimpor
tant when Serrault is on
screen. When he walks, every
movable part of his body flut
ters through a series of care
fully prearranged poses; he
gets more comic mileage out
of his clothing than almost any
other actor ever has.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with La Cage aux Folles 11.

Daniel (1981)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
E.L.Doctorow's novel The
Book of Daniel was an epic
construction that bridged the
two great eras of American
socialism by postulating that
the children of Communists
executed for conspiracy in the
early 1950s might become the
protesters of the Vietnam
years. The movie, adapted by
Doctorow and directed by Sid
ney Lumet, offers large chunks
of the book, delivered by a
huge, impressive cast, and it
contains moments of un
deniable power. But it's mostly
an incoherent jumble, full of
confused signals and halt
formed ideas. There's an unfat
homable flshback structure,
and Lumet's catch-as-catch-can
technique garbles the meaning
of what he has assembled and
plays hell with the perfor
mances.Though they are
poorly lit, haphazardly
costumed, and carelessly shot,
four actresses perform
memorably: Amanda Plum
mer, Lindsay Crouse, Ellen
Barkin and Julie Bovasso. With
Timothy Hutton as Daniel,
Mandy Patinkin, Edward Asner
and many others.
La Cage aux Folles 11 (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Albin (Michel Serrault) and
Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) could
become the Abbott and Cos
tello for the 80s, but not with
material like this tedious spy
thriller-comedy. The few
bright moments are buried un
der the pedestrian, im
plausible plot and the
surprisingly softheaded treat
ment of the relationship be
tween the two men. There is
some Cay Liberation
grandstanding that is notably
sour and lacking in sensitivity.
Directed by Edouard
Molinaro; screenplay by
Francis Veber, jean Poiret and
Marcello Danon.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with La Cage aux Folles.
Risky Business (1983)
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
This teen comedy, written
and directed by Paul Brickman,
has its own style and, in the
nighttime exteriors, an eerily
erotic dream landscape.
(Reynaldo Villalobos and Bruce
Surtees share credit for the
photography.) Brickman
demonstrates wit in a few
silent sequences, and there's a
wonderful scene in which his
hero, |oel (played by a winning
ail-American suburban type
named Tom Cruise), free from
the constraints imposed on
him by his parents, who are
now on vacation, dances
around the living room in his
underwear, miming the words
to a Bob Seger song. But this
film about a high school senior
who somehow winds up
managing a whorehouse in his
parents' home is indifferently
written and — except for Cruise
flatly acted. Furthermore, the
way in which it is pointed
squarely at the wish fulfillment
fantasies of its adolescent
audiences is a little dispiriting.

The Seventh Seal (1956)
Festival & New Varsity, Palo
Alto
With this medieval puzzle
drama, Ingmar Bergman rose
to heights that none of his
subsequent "dark" movies,
except for Shame a dozen
years later, has ever equalled.
The knight's chess game with
Death is surely one of the key
images in world cinema, and
the sequence involving the
burning of the young witch
suggests that Bergman may
have been inspired by
Dreyer's Day of Wrath. With
Max vori Sydow as the knight,
Bengt Ekerol as Death, Maud
Hansson as the witch, Bibi An
dersson, Gunnar Bjornstrand
and Nils Poppe.
Plays through Wednesday
with Wild Strawberries
(Festival); Thursday evening
with The Magician (New Var
sity).
The Earrings of Madame de
. . .(1953)
Cubberley High School (4000
Middlefield Road), Palo Alto
Max Ophuls' film of the
Louise de Valmorin novel is
both comic and tragic. The
aristocratic Madame de sells a
pair of diamond earrings, her
husband's wedding gift to her,
to pay her debts; the jewels
change hands with amusing
rapidity, and return to
Madame de as a gift from her
lover. Suddenly they become
meaningful to her. In order to
keep them, she fabricates dif
ferent stories to tell her hus
band and her lover; her hus
band deduces the truth and
confronts her lover, who in
terprets her indiscretion as an
indication of the shallowness
of her love. The astonishingly
deft screenplay suggests de
Maupassant, both in its use of
irony and in its complex emo
tional tone. And Ophuls has
set his film in de Maupassant's
epoch: the late 19th century.
A masterpiece, with peerless
performances by Danielle
Darrieux, Charles Boyer and
Vittorio de Sica.
Plays Wednesday evening.
To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)
kresge Auditorium
Harper Lee probably got the
best ideas for her
autobiographical novel from
Faulkner's Intruder in the
Dust, but To Kill a Mockingbird
has an undeniable appeal
both as a book and in this
rather staid screen adaptation
(by Horton Foote). Gregory
Peck plays the heroic lawyer,
Alticus Finch, who defends a
black man accused of rape in a
small southern town during
the Depression; it's a famous,
lauded performance, but it's
not much more lively than his
usual, sainted liberal acting.
Mary Badham, Philip Alford
and John Megna play the kids
through whose eyes the story
is seen. Directed by Robert
Mullian, who bangs away at
the themes; with Rosemary
Murphy, Frank Overton, Ruth
White and Brock Peters.
Plays tonight.

The Road Warrior (1982)
Memorial Auditorium
Set in Australia in the not
too-distant future, when the
fuel shortage has triggered a
war and the survivors wander
in bands searching for gas to
keep them going. The road is
more or less owned by brutal
marauders, and in the corse of
the film one "family" enlists
the aid of Max (Mel Gibson,
who also played this role in
Mad Max) to defeat their
hoodlum adversaries. The
director, George Miller, is
very talented, and there are
moments of apocalyptic glory
in Dean Semmler's photogra
phy, but the movie is mostly a
long destruction orgy featur
ing bows and arrows and
canon-sized flame throwers.
It's intended to be funny, but
you may not remember that
when you are offered such
delights as a child tossing a
boomerang into the skull of
one of the attackers. In the last
third, the picture has the
nerve to turn self-righteous,
and we are asked to hear
lectures on survival and
despair from characters
dressed like medieval punk
neanderthals.
Plays Sunday evening.
Grand Illusion (1937)
Terman Auditorium
During the First World War,
a band of Frenchmen plot to
escape from a German 1'.0.W
camp; the class bond shared
by their commander, the aris
tocrat de Boeldieu (Pierre
Fresnay), and the German
commandant, von Rauf
fenstein (Erich von Stroheim),
is stronger than the patriotic
ties between de Boeldieu and
the peasant Marechal (Jean
Gabin) or the Jewish bour
geois Rosenthal (Marcel
Dalio). Jean Renoir claimed
that he had made this movie in
order to demonstrate that the
real divisions between men
are "horizontal rather than
vertical," and it is not only
one of the most extraordinary
examinations of class distinc
tions ever filmed, but also one
of the greatest anti-war films.
No one who has seen it is
likely to forget the love scene
between Gabin and the Ger
man frau (Dita Parlo), or the
moment when Stroheim, after
Fresnay's death, cuts the
geranium on his windowsill.
Charles Spaak collaborated
with Renoir on the script;
Christian Matras shot it; and
Joseph kosma wrote the
score.
Plays Tuesday evening.
Bananas(l97l)
Cubberley Auditorium
Woody Allen's funniest
movie (co-written with Mickey
Rose). Much of it takes place in
a banana republic where
Woody is fighting for the
revolution; there is also a
screwball courtroom se
quence in the second half that
is a classic. Louise Lasser co
stars as a woman whose every
action seems to be a parody of
something in an Ingmar
Bergman picture. Ihe direc

tion and photography are
clumsy beyond the telling, but
most of the time you're too
helpless with laughter to
notice.
Plays tonight with 7he Loved
One.
The Loved One (1965)
Cubberley Auditorium
Tony Richardson's film ver
sion of the famous Evelyn
Waugh satire on Southern Cal
ifornia, set at a pet cemetery,
is truly wretched; it's also hys
terically funny. Terry South
ern and Christopher
Isherwood co-wrote the
screenplay, and you wouldn't
believe the people who show
up in it: Robert Morse, Jonat
han Winters, Robert Morley,
Roddy McDowall, Barbara
Nichols, Anjanette Comer,
Dana Andrews, Milton Berle,
lames Coburn, )ohn Cielgud,
Margaret Leighton, Rod
Steiger, Tab Hunter, Lionel
Stander, and even Liberace,
who demonstrates caskets.
Plays tonight with Bananas.

Reviews by Steve Vineberg

Saturday Night Fever(l977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In many ways this disco mu
sical isn't a very good movie,
but it has so much passion and
high spirits that you watch it
with a kind of glee, as you
would an Astaire-Rogers
picture. John Travolta gives a
star performance as Tony
Manero, who escapes his
draggy Brooklyn existence by
commandeering the local
disco floor one pight a week. If
you think he's not acting — that
he's gliding through the movie
on his personality alone — note
the way his whole bqdy shifts
when he enters the disco,
where he can relax and reign.
That's acting. Karen Lynn Gor-

ney plays the sweetly preten
tious woman Tony falls for;
their scenes together have a
touching freshness. John Bad
ham directed, from Norman
Wexler's script (based on a Nik
Cohn article), and Lester Wil
son choreographed the
fabulous numbers, to infec
tious music by The Bee Gees.
The supporting cast includes
Donna Pescow, Julie Bovasso,

Fran Drescher and Barry Mil
ler.
Plays tonight with Staymi
Alive.
The Phantom of Libert'
(1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Luis Bunuel's movies
anecdotes peripheral to thi
main action are often amonj
the highlights. This off-the-cuf
comedy is all anecdotes. Thi
structure is a lateral movemen
from one story to another sug
gested by a detail in the lirst
the joke is that nothing come

along — a character, a theme,
even a plot device — to tie all the
episodes toether, except that
they all operate on the princi
ple of surprise reversal. Unfor
tunately, very few of the
scenes are genuinely funny.
(One about a missing child is
amusing, and there is one gem

in the collection, depicting a
society in which the bathroom
has become a highly public
chamber, while people eat,
slightly embarrassed, in
private.) The impressive cast
includes Adriana Asti, Jean-
Claude Brialy, Adolfo Celi,
Michel Lonsdale, Julien Ber
theau, Michel Piccoli, Jean
Rochefort, Bernard Verley and
Monica Vitti. Jean-Claude Car
riere worked on the screenplay
with Bunuel.
