# Law and business students join jet-set early
## 
### TED LEMPERT 
It begins with an all-expenses
paid interview trip, or "fly-back," to
Los Angeles, including a fancy lunch
and dinner and a night at a first-class
hotel, with limitless room service.
Next comes the summer, featuring a
salary around $650 per week, and
extras such as free lunches, trips to
Angels and Dodgers games and the
theatre, dinner parties and a retreat
to Malibu Beach. In sight is the full
time job, with an average starting
salary of $38,500 and climbing, on
the wav to joining America's elite.
This "What I Did This Summer"
story belongs to Mark Sobil, a
fourth-year student in the joint
Law/Business School (JD/MBA) pro
gram, but it is not atypical. While
there are wide variations in the cor
porate job-hunt — the number of fly

backs range from one to a dozen,
summer salaries range from $500 per
week to over $1000 at New York City
consulting or law firms, and starting
salaries range from $27,000 to
$65,000 — Sobil's story is similar to
those of three-fourths of the law stu
dents and virtually all of the busi
ness students at Stanford.
The wining and dining and high
salaries often sound excessive to
those outside the law and business
community, and even some of those
within it, but the Stanford students
who take these summer jobs for the
most part strongly defend their
choice.
"I admit the salaries are
ridiculously high, but the money
goes quickly when you have to wear
nice clothes, pay high rents and go
out to expensive lunches," explains

Sobil, who has worked for Atari and
a small Chicago law firm in addition
to last summer's job in Los Angeles.
"If they make that much of an offer,
should I take less?"
Sobil also says that the jobs allow
him to pay off his four-year invest
ment in his Stanford graduate edu
cation. With Business School tuition
at $9117, Law School at $9178 and
total expenses estimated at $15,000
per year, many students look to the
lucrative summer positions as a
necessity.
"Stanford Law School is extremely
expensive," says second-year stu
dent Evan Tager. "Those people
who are supporting themselves
have to take corporate jobs to pay
tuition."
The firms who do the hiring,
however, have something else in

mind besides providing money to
repay tuition loans. JD/MBA student
Tom Russo says that the law firms
sponsor the summer parties and
outings to get to know the students
as individuals, so they can decide
who they want back after gradua
tion.
"The lavish programs are de
signed to see how people conduct
themselves outside of work, since
the firms are hiring the person as
well as the product," says Russo,
who has worked for Dean VVhilter
and the large San Francisco law firm
Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro.
"However, I don't think you can
make as informed a decision about
the kind of practice you want to
pursue if you're not expected to
