# Law and business students join jet-set early
## 
### TED LEMPERT 
It begins with an all-expenses
paid interview trip, or "fly-back," to
Los Angeles, including a fancy lunch
and dinner and a night at a first-class
hotel, with limitless room service.
Next comes the summer, featuring a
salary around $650 per week, and
extras such as free lunches, trips to
Angels and Dodgers games and the
theatre, dinner parties and a retreat
to Malibu Beach. In sight is the full
time job, with an average starting
salary of $38,500 and climbing, on
the wav to joining America's elite.
This "What I Did This Summer"
story belongs to Mark Sobil, a
fourth-year student in the joint
Law/Business School (JD/MBA) pro
gram, but it is not atypical. While
there are wide variations in the cor
porate job-hunt — the number of fly

backs range from one to a dozen,
summer salaries range from $500 per
week to over $1000 at New York City
consulting or law firms, and starting
salaries range from $27,000 to
$65,000 — Sobil's story is similar to
those of three-fourths of the law stu
dents and virtually all of the busi
ness students at Stanford.
The wining and dining and high
salaries often sound excessive to
those outside the law and business
community, and even some of those
within it, but the Stanford students
who take these summer jobs for the
most part strongly defend their
choice.
"I admit the salaries are
ridiculously high, but the money
goes quickly when you have to wear
nice clothes, pay high rents and go
out to expensive lunches," explains

Sobil, who has worked for Atari and
a small Chicago law firm in addition
to last summer's job in Los Angeles.
"If they make that much of an offer,
should I take less?"
Sobil also says that the jobs allow
him to pay off his four-year invest
ment in his Stanford graduate edu
cation. With Business School tuition
at $9117, Law School at $9178 and
total expenses estimated at $15,000
per year, many students look to the
lucrative summer positions as a
necessity.
"Stanford Law School is extremely
expensive," says second-year stu
dent Evan Tager. "Those people
who are supporting themselves
have to take corporate jobs to pay
tuition."
The firms who do the hiring,
however, have something else in

mind besides providing money to
repay tuition loans. JD/MBA student
Tom Russo says that the law firms
sponsor the summer parties and
outings to get to know the students
as individuals, so they can decide
who they want back after gradua
tion.
"The lavish programs are de
signed to see how people conduct
themselves outside of work, since
the firms are hiring the person as
well as the product," says Russo,
who has worked for Dean VVhilter
and the large San Francisco law firm
Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro.
"However, I don't think you can
make as informed a decision about
the kind of practice you want to
pursue if you're not expected to
work and live the life of a normal
associate," continues Russo.
"When you're in the position of
being solicited, people will treat you
differently."
Others argue that the summer
jobs, especially those in business,
are comparable to those of the full
time employees starting out, and
that therefore it is fair that the wages
are similar. JD/MBA student Davis
Goodman, who has worked with
Strategic Planning Association in
Washington, D.C. and a San Fran
cisco law firm, says that students in
summer consulting jobs work 60-
hour weeks; those in marketing
work 50 hours; and those in law
firms put in 45-55 hours.
"These aren't cushy jobs by any
means," says Goodman, who says
he was doing the same amount of
work as first-year associates and
managers. "If you divide the salaries
by the hours you put in, it's more
like $15 or $16 an hour."
Figures released by Law School
Placement Director Gloria Pyszka
show that the summer salaries are
slightly below the starting full-time
salaries for recent graduates. In the
summer of 1982, second-year stu
dents working in major law firms
averaged $625 a week in San Fran
cisco, $650 in Los Angeles and $850
in New York City. Annual salaries for
1983 graduates working in firms in
those cities averaged $37,000,
$39,500 and $46,000 respectively,
roughly $90 more per week in the
California cities and $30 more in
New York.
Goodman says the high summer
and starting salaries are enticing,
and while he personally is interested
in teaching law someday, he admits
that it is difficult to see alternate
careers when one is surrounded by

the corporate environment.
"You get caught up in the
process," he says. "You stay in first
class hotels, you get taken out to
meals and everyone around you is
saying this is what they want to do
with their lives. You don't have the
time or space to think about it for
yourself."
Some students decide early on
that the corporate world is for them,
and a few abuse the selection
process. One third-year student
says a classmate was staying in the
same hotel during a fly-back and
invited friends to his room for $300
worth of steak dinners — all charged
to the company sponsoring his in
terview. The third-year student also
says a few classmates take . -hacks
week after week to Los Angeles and
other cities, some to visit their
girlfriends or boyfriends.
"Some people are just hawks," he
says. "They'll interview with a mil
lion people. It satisfies their egos to
have a fly-back."
Other students see the lucrative
jobs as a temporary step, keeping
them long enough to pay back loans
and then move to smaller practices
or the public sector. Tager says he
knows several people who take cor
porate jobs during their second
summer and then go to work for the
government or public interest law
organizations after graduation.
"It's nice to be treated well once
in life," he says. "Public interest
work is life without pampering.
There's nothing wrong with taking
one summer and getting pam
pered."
Those who go corporate for just
one summer, however, are in the
minority. It is natural for the entire
Business School class to enter the
business world, while over 70 per
cent of recent graduates of the Law
School have headed toward private
firms or business after graduation.
That trend can be frustrating for
educators such as Law School Dean
John Ely, who has tried to encourage
students to look at a variety of

employment opportunities. Last
year, Ely established the Public In
terest Summer Loan Program,
through which students who take
public interest jobs over the sum
mer are given a loan, which does
not have to be repaid if the student
returns to public interest law after
graduation.
While Ely says he has nothing
against big law firms, he does not
want students to pursue that career
blindly. "We're trying to get stu
dents to think whether it's right for
them," he says.
A small but active group of stu
dents have taken that message to
heart, and both the Business and
Law Schools have public interest
foundations which solicit monev
from students to donate to worthy
public interest causes and to stu
dents working in lower-paying
public jobs.
While the public interest organi
zations are growing in numbers, stu
dents joining downtown consulting,
marketing and law firms remain the
norm. The tendency toward high
paying private practice has also ex
panded the definition of public in
terest.
According to Goodman, one stu
dent listed as working in the public
sector was employed by a bank in
the Caribbean.
