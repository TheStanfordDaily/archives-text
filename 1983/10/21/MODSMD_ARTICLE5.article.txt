# Newsweek: criminal law course is a 'mick'
## 
### PAM CLOYD Staff Writer 
Law Prof. John Kaplan's popular
spring quarter course, Political Sci
ence 183k: "Criminal Law," gained
national attention last week when
Newsweek magazine selected it as
one of the country's top "mick"
(nee Mickey Mouse) classes.
Criminal Law ranked with
Berkeley's Botany 20: "Chocolate,"
and Yale's History of Art 379 A: "The
Structure of the New York
Mambo."
According to the article, attend
ing "Crirn Law" is unnecessary
since the lectures are broadcast
over kZSU and recorded by ASSU
lecture note takers. "It's not unus
ual to find students listening to the
lectures on portable radios while
sunning themselves on the grassy
slopes above DeCuerre Pool," it
says.
"If Newsweek says it, it must be
true," Kaplan said. "At least they
spelled my name right." He later
added, "If you think it's true you
might be upset. I'm not upset.

"Maybe it is a mick, but I don't
understand how, with the grading
system," Kaplan continued. "I give
the same proportion of A's, B's and
C's as the rest of the Humanities
and Sciences department."
When asked about the poolside
lectures, Kaplan said, "I'm not
going to worry about the details,
but the lectures were broadcast be
tween 6:30 and 8 p.m. Not only
that, I believe that meals in the
dorm are served until about 6. If
they're swimming then, they must
sink like stones."
The article also mentioned that
two students in top hats and three
piece suits took the exam, "calmly
checking off answers between sips
of champagne."
To this Kaplan responded, "All I
know is that when I was in Law
School I came to an exam in a tux to
give people the impression I'd
been partying all night, but of
course they knew me better than
that. The fact that people came in a

tux doesn't bother me. I assume it
was their last exam. If they were
having a good time, more power to
them."
Senior Trey Ellis, Newsweek's
campus stringer, said that the mag
azine asked him for a list of five or
six classes that are well-known for
being easy A's.
"Everyone's got a favorite mick,"
Ellis said. "I gave them four from
about 20 friends that I talked to,"
he said. "Religions of the East,"
"Survey of the Energy Industries,"
and "Dramatic Exposition" were
some of the other classes he sug

gested.
"Harvard, Princeton and Yale
were in the article, too. They
wanted to show that all the big
schools have easy classes, too. It's
just for fun," Ellis said.
Some students, though, were
surprised to see the course in
cluded in the article. "I didn't think
it was a mick," said junior Brad
Cohen, who took the class in the
spring of his freshman year. "Some
of the things in the article were
wrong, too. For instance, we didn't
have a take-home midterm."
Kaplan's classes at the Law
School, like his undergraduate
course, are well-attended. "Mr.
Kaplan is one of the smartest men
I've met," said second-year student

Dan Bussel, who took Criminal Law
at the Law School last year and is
now enrolled in Kaplan's Evidence
class. "His classes are among the
most interesting I've had, and I
would never cut his class.
"I can understand his undergrad
uate course may be graded highly
because he's a real softie, but don't
underestimate the man," Bussel
said.
Kaplan said, jokingly, that he is
demanding an investigation into his
undergraduate course. "I want to
know, for one, why there is such an
easy class being offered at Stanford
and, two, why more people aren't
taking it if it is so easy. There are at
least two or three students out
there who haven't taken it."
