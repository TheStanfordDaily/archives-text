Executions claimed in Grenada
Bridgetown, Barbados — Gen. Hudson Hustin
proclaimed himself head of Grenada's new revolu
tionary military council yesterday as reports
mounted that Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and
five of his top followers were executed by the army
Wednesday not killed in a shoot-out as had been
originally reported by the new government.
The killings provoked revulsion in neighboring
Caribbean countries and the Caribbean Common
Market, CARICOM, scheduled an emergency
foreign minister's meeting for tomorrow to consider
proposals for economic and political sanctions
against the island's Marxist-oriented military leader
ship, including possible expulsion.

"I was horrified at these brutal and vicious mur
ders, the most vicious act to disfigure the West
Indies since the days of slavery," said Prime Minister
Tom Adams of Barbados, 90 miles northeast of
Grenada. "It will be very difficult indeed to see what
future the regime that is stained by this record of
murder can have in an association of peaceful and
peace-loving CARICOM states. I for one will not be
able to sit down at a table with these disgusting mur
derers."
In Jamaica, Prime Minister Edward Seaga, a critic
of Bishop's pro-Cuba policies, called an urgent
cabinet meeting, saying the coup had caused "the
greatest anxieties" within the Caribbean communi
ty. Cuban media yesterday did not acknowledge Bis
hop's death, although President Fidel Castro hosted
a Havana reception for the Grenadan leader less

than two weeks ago, the keuter News Agency re
ported.
Officially, the State Department declined to
characterize the new military-led government on the
island, but officials who spoke only on condition
that they not be identified said the government ap
pears to be dominated by a group more radical than
Bishop's was.
The Reagan administration had cool relations with
Bishop's government, but State Department spokes
man )ohn Hughes said he did not believe this policy
was related to Bishop's downfall.
Radio Free Grenada, the official broadcasting
facility monitored here, warned islanders of Hustin's
orders for an "all day, all night" curfew, in effect
until 6 p.m. Monday and said any violators would be
shot on sight. It said only workers in "essential
services" could obtain passes to move about the
133-square-mile island, which was best known for
lovely beaches and nutmeg until March 13, 1979,

when Bishop took power in a coup d' etat and began
a close alliance with Cuba and the Soviet Union.
Sandanistas submit accords
Washington — Nicaragua yesterday submitted to
the Reagan administration a package of four binding
.accords under which the leftist Sandanista govern
ment would pledge not to support guerrillas in El
Salvador if the United States would stop supporting
anti-Sandanista rebels in Nicaragua.
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto pre
