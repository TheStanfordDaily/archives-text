Executions claimed in Grenada
Bridgetown, Barbados — Gen. Hudson Hustin
proclaimed himself head of Grenada's new revolu
tionary military council yesterday as reports
mounted that Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and
five of his top followers were executed by the army
Wednesday not killed in a shoot-out as had been
originally reported by the new government.
The killings provoked revulsion in neighboring
Caribbean countries and the Caribbean Common
Market, CARICOM, scheduled an emergency
foreign minister's meeting for tomorrow to consider
proposals for economic and political sanctions
against the island's Marxist-oriented military leader
ship, including possible expulsion.

"I was horrified at these brutal and vicious mur
ders, the most vicious act to disfigure the West
Indies since the days of slavery," said Prime Minister
Tom Adams of Barbados, 90 miles northeast of
Grenada. "It will be very difficult indeed to see what
future the regime that is stained by this record of
murder can have in an association of peaceful and
peace-loving CARICOM states. I for one will not be
able to sit down at a table with these disgusting mur
derers."
In Jamaica, Prime Minister Edward Seaga, a critic
of Bishop's pro-Cuba policies, called an urgent
cabinet meeting, saying the coup had caused "the
greatest anxieties" within the Caribbean communi
ty. Cuban media yesterday did not acknowledge Bis
hop's death, although President Fidel Castro hosted
a Havana reception for the Grenadan leader less

than two weeks ago, the keuter News Agency re
ported.
Officially, the State Department declined to
characterize the new military-led government on the
island, but officials who spoke only on condition
that they not be identified said the government ap
pears to be dominated by a group more radical than
Bishop's was.
The Reagan administration had cool relations with
Bishop's government, but State Department spokes
man )ohn Hughes said he did not believe this policy
was related to Bishop's downfall.
Radio Free Grenada, the official broadcasting
facility monitored here, warned islanders of Hustin's
orders for an "all day, all night" curfew, in effect
until 6 p.m. Monday and said any violators would be
shot on sight. It said only workers in "essential
services" could obtain passes to move about the
133-square-mile island, which was best known for
lovely beaches and nutmeg until March 13, 1979,

when Bishop took power in a coup d' etat and began
a close alliance with Cuba and the Soviet Union.
Sandanistas submit accords
Washington — Nicaragua yesterday submitted to
the Reagan administration a package of four binding
.accords under which the leftist Sandanista govern
ment would pledge not to support guerrillas in El
Salvador if the United States would stop supporting
anti-Sandanista rebels in Nicaragua.
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto pre
sented the draft documents in Spanish, accompa
nied by unofficial English translations, to Assistant
Secretary of State Langhorne Motley during an hour
long meeting at the State Department yesterday.
The four documents, which deal with U.S.-
Nicaraguan relations and relations among the
countries of Central America, represent the most
substantive and specific offer by the Sandanistas to
stop the flow of any arms traffic across their territory
to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.
The proposed accords would permit on-site in
spections of Nicaragua and its neighbors and pro
vide for fines and international legal penalties
against any country violating the terms of the agree
ments.
In one of the documents, a proposed treaty with
the United States, Nicaragua pledges that "it will not
permit" its territory "to be utilized to effect or to
threaten the security of the United States or to attack
any other state." A senior Sandanista official said
this provision would prohibit the establishment of
Cuban or Soviet military installations in Nicaragua.
A State Department spokesman said after yester
day's meeting that "our people are looking at
them."

House votes to cut off covert aid
Washington — A bitterly divided House yesterday
voted tor the second time in three months to cut off
CIA support for Nicaraguan counter-revolutionaries.
The 227-194 vote, largely along party lines, came
after Democratic leaders charged the covert action
amounted to war.
Like the first cut-off proposal, the new one is seen
as unlikely to win approval in the Republican
controlled Senate, but White House Democratic
leaders said the vote should help them in negotia
tions with the Senate on limiting covert action.
There were 209 Democrats and 18 Republicans
voting tor the cut-off proposal, while 48 Democrats
and 14b Republicans voted against it.
The House vote came after a heated debate in
which each side accused the other of risking deeper
U.S. involvement in Central America's wars.
Conservatives: no King holiday
Washington — The Conservative Caucus delivered
43,700 signatures to the White House yesterday in a
last-ditch effort to persuade President Reagan to

veto legislation creating a national holiday in honor
of Martin Luther King, |r.
The petitions used King's own words — that
people should be judged by "the content of their
character, not the color of their skin" — in urging
Reagan to return to his original opposition to the
measure.
The bill, however, passed the House and the Sen
ate by such lopsided margins that Reagan would risk
the futile and politically awkward exercise of seeing
a veto overridden by Congress and the measure
enacted anvway.
At his news conference Wednesday night, a few
hours after the Senate voted 78-22 to establish a King
holiday, the President reluctantly promised to sign
the bill "since thev seem bent on making it a nation
al holiday."
Reagan did not make clear who he meant by
"they" but said he would have preferred some ob
servance of the slain civil rights leader's birthday
short of establishing a 10th national holiday.
Former CIA agent convicted
New York — Former CIA agent Edwin Wilson was
convicted yesterday of the attempted murder of two

federal prosecutors, a business associate and five
government witnesses who linked him to sale of ex
plosives to Libya.
Wilson, already serving 32 years in prison for sale
of weapons and explosives to Libya, was acquitted of
the most serious charge against him: conspiracy to
murder two federal prosecutors who had inves
tigated his weapons dealings.
Stock market rebounds
New York — Stocks advanced modestly yesterday
to rebound from two sessions of broad losses.
Retail, auto, airline and drug issues paced the
gainers, but investors continued to dump Digital
Equipment and several other computer stocks.
The Dow jones average of 30 industrials off 21.95
points over the previous two days, recovered 4.77 to
1251.52. The Dow Jones transportation and utility
averages also rose.
Today's weather
Sunny inland with patchy fog along the coast.
Highs in the 70s to low 80s inland and the 60s near
the coast. Light winds.
