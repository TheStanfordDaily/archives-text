## Cyprus official blasts Turks 
### BRYCE LEE Staff writer 
A prominent Greek Cypriot
yesterday assailed Turkey's
continued military presense in
Cyprus, condemning what he
called the "brutal ways" in
which the Turks have
"looted" the cultural heritage
of his people.
"We fight for a just cause,"
said H.E. Patroklos Stavrou,
undersecretary to the presi
dent of Cyprus, during a
speech at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center. Stavrou describ
ed this "cause" as his govern
ment's attempt to remove
Turkish troops from the small
island nation, located off the
coast of Turkey and Syria in
the eastern Mediterranean
Sea.
He stressed that despite the

tact that more than 80 percent
of the country's population is
Greek and only a small per
cent is Turkish, the Turks have
stationed troops in Cyprus
since 1974.
The Greeks have been living
in Cyprus for 33 centuries, but
most of the Turks are descen
dants from the Ottoman inva
sion in 1561, Stavrou said.
"We oppose this (the
Turkish military in Cyprus),"
he declared, noting that "the
struggle imposed on us since

1974 is still here."
Strife in Cyprus between
Turks and Greek Cypriots has
been frequently dubbed the
"Cyprus question," a label
which Stavrou approached
disdainfully. "The deprivation
of our right was called a
question' even though" the
Greek Cypriots have been the
victims, he said.
"The Turks have displaced
one-third of our population
and they looted our cultural
heritage," he added.
