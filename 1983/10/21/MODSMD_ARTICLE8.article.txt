# Cyprus conflict reaches crucial juncture
## 
### Bill AINSWORTH 
United Nation* — So mans immediate
crises confront the world that the often
tense relations between the Greek and
Turkish populations on Cyprus get little
attention. But developments there are at
a critical juncture that could cause serious
trouble in the coming years for Greece,
Turkey, NATO and the United States.

News Analysis

Presently, U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cueller is making a major
effort to resume negotiations between
Turkish and Greek Cypriots. The talks are
aimed at working out a form of govern
ment that would be satisfactory to the
Greek population, which comprises 80
percent of the nation's population and
controls the central government, and that
would be agreeable to the Turkish
population, which has set up an indepen
dent community on the northern part of
the island.
A source close to the negotiations said
last week that resumption of the talks
hinges on whether the Greek Cypriots
will accept a summit meeting with the
leader of the Turkish Cypriots.
This summit meeting would include
Spyros kyrianou, the president of the
Cyprus Republic, and Rauf Denktash, the
head of the Turkish area of Cyprus, as
well as U.N. representatives.
Diplomats at the United Nations are
worried that the Greek Cypriots will not

agree to a summit because they tear that
Denktash will use it to declare a unilateral
independence tor the northern part of
the island under 1 urkish control.
1 he\ also fear that if the negotiations,
which have been suspended for four
years, do not resume quickly, the increas
ing tensions between the two groups will
exacerbate relations between Greece and
Turkes and possibly draw them into war
over the issue.
Meanwhile, members of NATO, which
includes Turkey and Greece, are con
cerned that continued deterioration in re
lations between the two nations will un
dermine the effectiveness of the al
liance s southeastern flank.
Both Greek Cypriots and U.N. officials
oppose an independent Turkish Cypriot
state. One U.N. official predicted
"horrendous consequences" if the
Turkish section becomes independent.
The reason for this opposition con
cerns the role of the 18,000 to 30,000
Turkish troops stationed on the island
and the 2500 U.N. peacekeeping troops
that are monitoring the 100-mile border
between the two areas of Cyprus.
If an independent Turkish state were
set up, the U.N. peacekeeping troops
would most likely be recalled because the
Turkish Cypriots would probably
withdraw their approval of the troops.
Without U.N. troops, the Greek Cypriots
would be virtually unprotected against
the Turkish troops.

A IJ.N. diplomat feared that in this sit
uation, "the lurks could exert military
pressure to achieve political objectives."
However, the alternative — Creek
Cvpriots sanctioning troops from Greece
to protect them — is potentially even more
explosive. A situation in which Greek
troops are placed face-to-face with
Turkish troops would exacerbate tensions
and drastically increase the chances of
some small incident setting off a war be
tween the two nations.
Since the 1974 invasion, the Greek
C\priots have thrived economically. The
economy has registered one of the fastest
rates of growth in the world and the per
capita income has risen to $4600 a year.
But because of this prosperity, which has
occurred largely as a result of increased
tourism and trade fleeing war-torn Beirut,
many Greek Cypriots are satisfied with
the status quo.
For this reason, there is no real pres
sure for the Greek Cypriots to participate
in negotiations or achieve any agree
ments in talks upon which agree.
But U.N. officials have warned that as it
stands, the current situation does not
provide a stable status quo. They worry
that if talks do not begin soon, Cyprus
may, in a few years, turn into a major area
of conflict — one that may seriously
threaten to undermine an important area
of NATO.
