## Resident fellows: learning and laughing and living with students 
### BOB FRANKLIN 
Tailgaters, guest speakers,
toga parties, dorm plays,
beach trips, house govern
ment, San Francisco
scavenger hunts and adviser
dinners all have one element
in common: They are all stu
dent acfivines which resident
fellows have initiated in their
ttempts to establish a feeling
of community within a
residence.
From a student's point of
iev\ these activities are both
educational and entertaining.
They serve as common events
which strengthen friendships
and produce memories.
From a resident fellow's
perspective, these activities
are just as entertaining and
educational as they are for
students. Dorm events all
serve to help the resident fel
low better understand the life
of the undergraduate — one of
the principle reasons an RF
becomes an RF.
Ron Rebholz, the RF of
Trancos for the past three
years, enjoys his |ob because

the "students are wonderful
and bright people." Watching
them grow intellectually,
emotionally and socially
makes his job gratifying, he
said.
A professor in tfie English
Department for more than 21
years, Rebholz's interest and
enthusiasm for William
Shakespeare are conveyed to
the students in Trancos' year
ly dorm plays. He hopes As
You Like It will be this year's
dorm production, and says
that "becoming involved in a
common activity" such as the
play enables him to form
close, meaningful and lasting
relationships with his stu
dents.
For Elizabeth Fliyama in the
Residential Education office,
these are some important
goals of Residential Educa
tion: "To inspire the students
and to stimulate students' in
terest in the University and
the community."
Having served as the RF for
two years in Otero, when it
was a four-class dorm 15 years

ago, Rebholz has had the op
portunity to compare the
four- class dorm to the ail
freshmen Trancos.
Working in a four class
dorm, says Rebholz, "is less
challenging and (less) ex
hausting.' This difference
may he attributed to the con
tinuity of the house's image
and to the large number of re
turning residents. On the
other hand, Rebholz adds, "It
is easier to get freshmen to do
things."
But Rebholz has also seen
the negative aspects of dorm
life.
He often sees " the
residence as an escape, not
an extension, from the class
room." He attempts to coun
teract this tendency at meal
time, which is the major time
for interaction between the
RF and the students. To break
the wall between the class
room and the residence, says
Rebholz, "is the ideal of Resi
dential Education."
Fie has learned that the
consideration of others is es

sential for a good year as an
RF — and as a student. Be
cause of this, he sees a dire
need for a sense .1 communi
ty within the residence.
Rebholz begins the forma
tion of this community >\i n
before the school year start-,,
when the RF and resident as
sistants go on a retreat to
gether. Thus, the freshmen
come into a setting which
already lias a sense of com
munity established, which
makes it easier for th< fresh
men to become < ni )t this
team He attributes ilns year's
"team" spirit to his "great"
RAs.
In an established communi
ty, Rebholz says, students can
express their interests more
readily and have more open,
knowledgeable and interest
ing discussions.
For Law Prof. John Kaplan,
in his second and final year as
an RF, life at Yost House is
quite different from the fast
paced, enthusiasm-filled and
energetic life of an all
freshmen house.
Housing only upperclass
men and housing them
elegantly, Yost is "mellow,
nice and intelligent," as
Kaplan describes it. As he
relaxes in his comfortable
suite, his calm voice, tone
and mannerisms reflect the
house characteristics perfect
ly-
Taking the job because he
thought it would be fun,
Kaplan says,"I like to have
kids around. And I want to
know the nitty-gritty of un
dergraduate life and the
workings of a complicated in
stitution."
As for raising a family in
Sterling Quad, Kaplan has no
qualms. FHis daughter, a
senior in high school, laughs,
lives and lunches with the
residents, Kaplan says. "She
participates in dorm activities
and is treated nicely."
Kaplan enjoys the students
as friends, and talks with
them on this level about
anything: "Extracurricular ac
tivities, politics, sports and
just nothing much. It's relax
ing."
One thing that he has
learned from these talks with
the students is the mirror
image of faculty and student
opinions. Fie points out that
being a member of a
research-oriented faculty, fel
low professors generally
respect the research skills of
their colleagues, while taking
little notice of their classroom
abilities. For the students,
teaching methods are a

higher priority generally than
research achievements.
Kaplan, reemphasizing the
mellowness of being an RF at
Yost, refrains from socializing
in the students rooms,
saying, "I try to give them
enough 100 m Their rooms
are their own."
Nonetheless, he knows
them well enough to partici
pate in activities with them —
especially an occasional game
of ping pong — to write recom
mendations for them and to
laugh with them.
Cal Lai, who tor the past
three years has been the RF at
Okada in Wilbur Hall, says
that being an RF for the Asian

theme house has been a
gratifying experience. "I am
still friends with the students
(who lived in Okada the last
two years). It is great to see
people develop and feel par
tially responsible for that de
velopment."
Lai says that he, too, has
developed during his term as
RF in Okada. "You feel
sometimes that time isn't un
der your own control," when
RF responsibilities clash with
duties outside the residence.
"But," he adds, "you get
used to this."
He says the biggest draw
back of being an RF is that he

cannot do enough for the stu
dents. "There is always more
you can do," says Lai, who is
currently writing, directing
and producing hi- on
movie.
He shares his cooking hob
by with students by serving
desserts and cot ktail to .1 dif
terent handful of student
regularly in his Rh cottage lat
explains, "Tins way 1 share
what I do in my cottage and
make myself available "
The fact that Okada is a
theme house gives us a
focus to rally around and
gives us more to work with (in
establishing a sense of com
munity," says Lai.
Also, getting a wide range

ot colleagues to speak to
Okada residents enables the
students to see the other op
tions of life, besides law, en
gineering and medicine, says
Lai.
Lai admits that even in his
best year as the RF of Okada,
the theme house can be
"exclusionary", but this is not
his intention. His goal is to
"get others involved in the
house."
"Everybody," said Lai,
"needs to be with friends."
Kathleen Namphy has been
the RF of Madera for the past
four years. A recipient of the
Dinkelspiel Award for out

standing service to under
graduate education. Namphy

Lai admits that even in his

the theme house can be
"exclusionary", but this is not
his intention. His goal is to

MIXING BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE: Madera RF Kalhy Namphy talks with students at
Wilbur Food Service.
Tailgaters, guest speakers,
toga parties, dorm plays,
beach trips, house govern
ment, San Francisco
scavenger hunts and adviser
dinners all have one element
in common: They are all stu
dent acfivines which resident
fellows have initiated in their
ttempts to establish a feeling
of community within a
residence.
From a student's point of
iev\ these activities are both
educational and entertaining.
They serve as common events
which strengthen friendships
and produce memories.
From a resident fellow's
perspective, these activities
are just as entertaining and
educational as they are for
students. Dorm events all
serve to help the resident fel
low better understand the life
of the undergraduate — one of
the principle reasons an RF
becomes an RF.
Ron Rebholz, the RF of
Trancos for the past three
years, enjoys his |ob because

the "students are wonderful
and bright people." Watching
them grow intellectually,
emotionally and socially
makes his job gratifying, he
said.
A professor in tfie English
Department for more than 21
years, Rebholz's interest and
enthusiasm for William
Shakespeare are conveyed to
the students in Trancos' year
ly dorm plays. He hopes As
You Like It will be this year's
dorm production, and says
that "becoming involved in a
common activity" such as the
play enables him to form
close, meaningful and lasting
relationships with his stu
dents.
For Elizabeth Fliyama in the
Residential Education office,
these are some important
goals of Residential Educa
tion: "To inspire the students
and to stimulate students' in
terest in the University and
the community."
Having served as the RF for
two years in Otero, when it
was a four-class dorm 15 years

ago, Rebholz has had the op
portunity to compare the
four- class dorm to the ail
freshmen Trancos.
Working in a four class
dorm, says Rebholz, "is less
challenging and (less) ex
hausting.' This difference
may he attributed to the con
tinuity of the house's image
and to the large number of re
turning residents. On the
other hand, Rebholz adds, "It
is easier to get freshmen to do
things."
But Rebholz has also seen
the negative aspects of dorm
life.
He often sees " the
residence as an escape, not
an extension, from the class
room." He attempts to coun
teract this tendency at meal
time, which is the major time
for interaction between the
RF and the students. To break
the wall between the class
room and the residence, says
Rebholz, "is the ideal of Resi
dential Education."
Fie has learned that the
consideration of others is es

sential for a good year as an
RF — and as a student. Be
cause of this, he sees a dire
need for a sense .1 communi
ty within the residence.
Rebholz begins the forma
tion of this community >\i n
before the school year start-,,
when the RF and resident as
sistants go on a retreat to
gether. Thus, the freshmen
come into a setting which
already lias a sense of com
munity established, which
makes it easier for th< fresh
men to become < ni )t this
team He attributes ilns year's
"team" spirit to his "great"
RAs.
In an established communi
ty, Rebholz says, students can
express their interests more
readily and have more open,
knowledgeable and interest
ing discussions.
For Law Prof. John Kaplan,
in his second and final year as
an RF, life at Yost House is
quite different from the fast
paced, enthusiasm-filled and
energetic life of an all
freshmen house.
Housing only upperclass
men and housing them
elegantly, Yost is "mellow,
nice and intelligent," as
Kaplan describes it. As he
relaxes in his comfortable
suite, his calm voice, tone
and mannerisms reflect the
house characteristics perfect
ly-
Taking the job because he
thought it would be fun,
Kaplan says,"I like to have
kids around. And I want to
know the nitty-gritty of un
dergraduate life and the
workings of a complicated in
stitution."
As for raising a family in
Sterling Quad, Kaplan has no
qualms. FHis daughter, a
senior in high school, laughs,
lives and lunches with the
residents, Kaplan says. "She
participates in dorm activities
and is treated nicely."
Kaplan enjoys the students
as friends, and talks with
them on this level about
anything: "Extracurricular ac
tivities, politics, sports and
just nothing much. It's relax
ing."
One thing that he has
learned from these talks with
the students is the mirror
image of faculty and student
opinions. Fie points out that
being a member of a
research-oriented faculty, fel
low professors generally
respect the research skills of
their colleagues, while taking
little notice of their classroom
abilities. For the students,

makes his job gratifying, he
said.
A professor in tfie English
Department for more than 21
years, Rebholz's interest and
enthusiasm for William
Shakespeare are conveyed to
the students in Trancos' year
ly dorm plays. He hopes As
You Like It will be this year's
dorm production, and says
that "becoming involved in a
common activity" such as the
play enables him to form
close, meaningful and lasting
relationships with his stu
dents.
For Elizabeth Fliyama in the
Residential Education office,
these are some important
goals of Residential Educa
tion: "To inspire the students
and to stimulate students' in
terest in the University and
the community."
Having served as the RF for
two years in Otero, when it
was a four-class dorm 15 years

ago, Rebholz has had the op
portunity to compare the
four- class dorm to the ail
freshmen Trancos.
Working in a four class
dorm, says Rebholz, "is less
challenging and (less) ex
hausting.' This difference
may he attributed to the con
tinuity of the house's image
and to the large number of re
turning residents. On the
other hand, Rebholz adds, "It
is easier to get freshmen to do
things."
But Rebholz has also seen
the negative aspects of dorm
life.
He often sees " the
residence as an escape, not
an extension, from the class
room." He attempts to coun
teract this tendency at meal
time, which is the major time
for interaction between the
RF and the students. To break
the wall between the class
room and the residence, says
Rebholz, "is the ideal of Resi
dential Education."
Fie has learned that the
consideration of others is es

sential for a good year as an
RF — and as a student. Be
cause of this, he sees a dire
need for a sense .1 communi
ty within the residence.
Rebholz begins the forma
tion of this community >\i n
before the school year start-,,
when the RF and resident as
sistants go on a retreat to
gether. Thus, the freshmen
come into a setting which
already lias a sense of com
munity established, which
makes it easier for th< fresh
men to become < ni )t this
team He attributes ilns year's
"team" spirit to his "great"
RAs.
In an established communi
ty, Rebholz says, students can
express their interests more
readily and have more open,
knowledgeable and interest
ing discussions.
For Law Prof. John Kaplan,
in his second and final year as
an RF, life at Yost House is
quite different from the fast
paced, enthusiasm-filled and
energetic life of an all
freshmen house.
Housing only upperclass
men and housing them
elegantly, Yost is "mellow,
nice and intelligent," as
Kaplan describes it. As he
relaxes in his comfortable
suite, his calm voice, tone
and mannerisms reflect the
house characteristics perfect
ly-
Taking the job because he
thought it would be fun,
Kaplan says,"I like to have
kids around. And I want to
know the nitty-gritty of un
dergraduate life and the
workings of a complicated in
stitution."
As for raising a family in
Sterling Quad, Kaplan has no
qualms. FHis daughter, a
senior in high school, laughs,
lives and lunches with the
residents, Kaplan says. "She
participates in dorm activities
and is treated nicely."
Kaplan enjoys the students
as friends, and talks with
them on this level about
anything: "Extracurricular ac
tivities, politics, sports and
just nothing much. It's relax
ing."
One thing that he has
learned from these talks with
the students is the mirror
image of faculty and student
opinions. Fie points out that
being a member of a
research-oriented faculty, fel
low professors generally
respect the research skills of
their colleagues, while taking
little notice of their classroom
abilities. For the students,
teaching methods are a

higher priority generally than
research achievements.
Kaplan, reemphasizing the
mellowness of being an RF at
Yost, refrains from socializing
in the students rooms,
saying, "I try to give them
enough 100 m Their rooms
are their own."
Nonetheless, he knows
them well enough to partici
pate in activities with them —
especially an occasional game
of ping pong — to write recom
mendations for them and to
laugh with them.
Cal Lai, who tor the past
three years has been the RF at
Okada in Wilbur Hall, says
that being an RF for the Asian

theme house has been a
gratifying experience. "I am
still friends with the students
(who lived in Okada the last
two years). It is great to see
people develop and feel par
tially responsible for that de
velopment."
Lai says that he, too, has
developed during his term as
RF in Okada. "You feel
sometimes that time isn't un
der your own control," when
RF responsibilities clash with
duties outside the residence.
"But," he adds, "you get
used to this."
He says the biggest draw
back of being an RF is that he

cannot do enough for the stu
dents. "There is always more
you can do," says Lai, who is
currently writing, directing
and producing hi- on
movie.
He shares his cooking hob
by with students by serving
desserts and cot ktail to .1 dif
terent handful of student
regularly in his Rh cottage lat
explains, "Tins way 1 share
what I do in my cottage and
make myself available "
The fact that Okada is a
theme house gives us a
focus to rally around and
gives us more to work with (in
establishing a sense of com
munity," says Lai.
Also, getting a wide range

ot colleagues to speak to
Okada residents enables the
students to see the other op
tions of life, besides law, en
gineering and medicine, says
Lai.
Lai admits that even in his
best year as the RF of Okada,
the theme house can be
"exclusionary", but this is not
his intention. His goal is to
"get others involved in the
house."
"Everybody," said Lai,
"needs to be with friends."
Kathleen Namphy has been

"Being an RP is a public life

RF said.
However, Namohv is a oer-

son who lives for the public.
Madera participates in many
community activities, includ
ing reading for the blind, or
ganizing the Maderathon -- a
benefit for the Peninsula
Children's Center — and hel
ping Amnesty International.
Dorm-based classes and
play readings by the Western

the educational programs
that Namphy has initiated.
Her appeal to a wide spec
trum of interests helps her
create the intellectual and so

dorm, which she calls
"pleasurable and useful."
