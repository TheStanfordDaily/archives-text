## Terrorist bomb kills 161 Americans in Beirut 
### TROY EID With wire reports 
In the single greatest loss of life
suffered by U.S. military forces
since the Vietnam War, a suicide ter
rorist crashed a pickup truck packed
with explosives into the barricaded
iobby of a building full of sleeping
U.S. Marines and sailors at the
American compound in Beirut early
yesterday.
The ensuing explosion killed at
least 161 Americans and wounded
more than 59 others.
Moments later, another suicide
bomber rammed a truck-bomb into
a building housing French troops.
Civil Defense workers on the scene
said at least 27 French soldiers
perished in the blast, while 12
others sustained injuries.
Amid reports of rising death tolls,
the State Department received a
communique from Beirut in which
the previously unknown Islamic
Revolutionary Movement claimed
responsibility for the attacks.
In Beirut, an anonymous caller
telephoned the office of the French
news service Agence France Presse,
identifying the two suicide bombers
and asserting that their movement
will not rest until Beirut is controlled
by "revolutionary Moslems and
combative democratic youth."
Leaders of nations around the
world joined President Reagan in
denouncing the bombings, which

the president vowed "will not drive
us out of that area."
Reagan abandoned a golfing vaca
tion in Georgia to meet with his na
tional security advisers in Washing
ton, and Secretary of State George
Shultz cancelled today's trip to El
Salvador and Brazil. Pentagon and
State Department task forces were
immediately initiated to explore op
tions available to protect the Marine
peacekeeping force.
Standing before reporters on the
White House lawn, Reagan said the
attack makes "so evident the bestial
nature of those who would assume
power" if U.S. forces were

withdrawn from Lebanon.
"We must be more determined
than ever that they cannot take over
the vital and strategic area of the
earth or, for that matter, any other
part of the earth," he said. "There
are no words that can express our
sorrow and grief over the loss of
those splendid young men and the
injury to so many others."
French Premier Pierre Mauroy
said the French contingent of the
multinational force would also
remain in Lebanon despite the at
tack. Mauroy called the bombings
"an odious and cowardly attack
against France and against peace"

and said the issue of withdrawal "is
a question that does not arrive at the
present time."
In Lebanon, Marine leaders
debated methods of reducing U.S.
vulnerability. Earlier in the week,
the administration stepped up its
military assistance to Lebanon, ship
ping more armaments to the
country in an attempt to transfer
power from the multinational force
to the Lebanese army.
The other nations involved in the
Lebanon peacekeeping effort also
appeared to pledge their continued
military support in the region. En
glish Foreign Office Minister Rich
ard Luce said the British government
would make no immediate decision
on the future of its Beirut contin
gent.
In Italy, the source of the largest
contingent of the multinational
force, Italian Prime Minister Bettino
Craxi pledged to keep the Italians in
Lebanon, while Pope John Paul II
told a crowd of 80,000 at St. Peter's
Square that the incident constituted
"a new act of war."
Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger charged that
"circumstantial evidence" impl
icates Iran as a perpetrator in the
crisis. White House spokesman Lar
ry Speakes fell short of openly back
ing Weinberger's claim but assured
reporters that "we do have intelli
gence that points to this incident."

While some Stanford experts dis
agree as to what course the United
States should take in the wake of the
latest Lebanon crisis, concern seems
to focus on the purpose — or lack of
purpose — of the multinational
force.
Political Science Prof. Seymour
Martin Lipset, a Hoover Institution
senior research fellow, said, "The
U.S. went into Lebanon with too few
troops to perform any real mission."
While the original function of the
Marines "was to facilitate maintain
ing peace," Lipset noted that ten
sions have not decreased in the
region, which may indicate that,"at

least in this respect, the mission has
failed."
Hoover Research Fellow Paul
Ryan, a former U.S. Navy admiral,
also said he does not know "what
our military objectives in Lebanon
are," and added that he has "a
feeling the American public might
not be fully aware of" or fully under
stand the role of the multinational
force.
History Prof. Joel Beinin further
questioned the contingent's pur
pose. "I don't know why they're
there," he said in reference to the
