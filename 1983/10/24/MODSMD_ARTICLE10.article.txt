# Pride...with caution
## 
### 
Last Tuesday, some Stanford students felt
that little twinge of disappointment, bred by
competition, when they picked up their news
paper and learned that a UC-Berkeley profes
sor had won the Nobel Prize in Economics.
But they felt better again on Wednesday,
thanks to Chemistry Prof. Henry Taube and the
Nobel Committee.
We congratulate Stanford's new Nobel Prize
winner — by all accounts, a modest, sensitive
and brillant man.
Taube is Stanford's 10th Nobel laureate.
(Those who have died or are associated only
with the Hoover Institution are not included in
the University's count.) Only Cal, which has a
larger faculty, has more among the universities
in this state.
Stanford should be proud of its scholars, as
should California, which claims nearly 30 per

cent of all American Nobel Prize winners, and
the United States, whose citizens have won
twice as many prizes in the three scientific
fields as any other country.
But that pride should be cautious. The five
Americans who were recognized by the
Swedish Academy this year were honored for
work they did decades ago — at a time when
the trend in funding for the sciences was up
not down, and academic salaries were attrac
tive enough that there was no need to worry
about the loss of top-notch thinkers to the
more wealthy world outside universities.
We don't want to put a damper on last
week's honor, but some things may have to
change if Stanford and the United States are
going to have many Henry Taubes 20 years
from now.
