'C' lots needed
What sort of veiled logic led to
the decision to convert a large
portion of the lot near the High
Energy Physics Laboratories
endstation from 'C' to 'A' classifi
cation? One can't assume it had
anything to do with the
desirability of the parking area,
since the 'C' and 'A' areas are
directly adjacent, and neither
offers immediate access to the
more populated areas of campus.
Therefore, one must assume the
decision had something to do with
a determination of the relative
need for 'A' parking places in that
corner of campus.
This morning as I drove into the
lot, the 'C' area was completely
full, and cars littered the red "no
parking" curbs in that area, while
50 to 75 spaces in the A' zone
remained unoccupied. The same
has been true each morning.
The evidence would seem to
indicate that the conversion has
simply aggravated an already acute
shortage of 'C' slots. Perhaps the
Committee on Parking and Trans
portation would be willing to
reconsider this unfortunate deci
sion before bad weather com
pounds the problem.

Legal advice
Our office recently authored an
advisory legal opinion indicating
that the Reagan museum and
public affairs center, as presently
planned, could violate a provision
of the Stanford Charter. Last week,
in a column published by The
Daily, (Oct. 14) titled "SCAREU,
law firm should not scare us," one
Stanford student called the logic of
the opinion "absurd."
The relevant provision of the
Charter, entitled, "The University,
Nonpolitical and Nonpartisan" was
written by Mrs. Leland Stanford
herself, subsequently approved by
the California legislature, and held
forever binding upon the Univer
sity by the Superior Court of Santa
Clara County in 1902. It reads:

"I desire that the University shall
forever be kept out of politics, and
that no professor shall electioneer
among or seek to dominate other
professors or the students for the
success of any political party or
candidate in any political contest.
If it is possible to operate the
planned Reagan complex in such a
way that it is politically neutral and
divorced from the political success
of its namesake and the ideology
he represents, a court of law might
not find any conflict between the
proposed institution and the
Charter provision above. The cur
rent plans, however, indicate that
such a value-neutral institution is
unlikely to result.
The essential point of our
opinion was to advise our clients,
SCAREU (Stanford Community
Against Reagan University), that
any decision to go forth with the
proposed Reagan complex could
clearly be challenged in a court of
law as a violation of the Charter
Trust by even one dissenting mem
ber of the Board of Trustees, and
possibly by students, faculty and
alumni who feel the project as
planned would violate the Charter.
That is, the ultimate decision with
regard to the Reagan complex may
lie with the courts and not the
Board of Trustees.

Energy brochure
I would like to voice my opinion
regarding the recent mass mailing
of energy conservation brochures
from Stanford utilities groups. It
seems that these were mailed to
almost every faculty and staff mem
ber on the campus including many
persons who have been gone for
years!
These brochures were quite
clearly done professionally and are,
I suppose, quite interesting to
those dealing with the problem.
However, I wonder why it was
decided that these brochures
should have been distributed to
such a large percentage of the

University community, many of
whom I saw discard it without a
minute's glance.
It states in the brochure that"
. . . when energy costs rise, other
more adjustable parts of the
budget suffer. Since this means a
reallocation of funds earmarked for
academic programs and salaries,
everyone at Stanford is affected."
Perhaps someone should have
thought about (1) the cost of
designing the brochure, (2) the
cost of printing such a large quan
tity, and (3) the cost of distributing
it.
Recently, my department re
quested funds to renovate and
redesign our main office, someth
ing that would greatly aid in em
ployee job performance, interac
tion and happiness. This request
was turned down. It seems to me
that money (always a sensitive
subject at Stanford) is being
(literally) thrown away on such
ineffective campaigns as the one
represented by these brochures.
