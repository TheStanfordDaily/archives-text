# Why is U.S. fighting Nicaragua?
## 
### 
The United States of America was born in the fire and
blood of a revolution against the oppression of a foreign
pOwer. It was an uneven war, matching the pathetic
resources of the colonial army against the military and
financial might of the British Crown. Vet it was a war the
colonies eventually won.
A similar revolution goes on today. This revolution,
like our own 200 years ago, is being carried out by a
small, ill-equipped country against an infinitely superior
foreign power. Only now, the roles are reversed: It is
the U.S. that is trying to dominate and control a small,
struggling nation. The nation is Nicaragua.
Of course, U.S. intervention in Nicaragua is nothing
new. U.S. Marines occupied parts of Nicaragua off and
on for the 24 years between 1909 and 1933. And U.S.
financial experts ran the Nicaraguan customs, national
bank and railroads in the early 19205. But it is only with
the advent of the Reagan administration that the U.S.
has actively and systematically sought to overthrow the
government of Nicaragua.

The Dole Fruit Company followed
the government's advice and left
just as the banana harvest was
about to begin. The result was
chaos.

Economically, the U.S. is doing all it can to damage
Nicaragua. For example, the government is trying to
dissuade new U.S. businesses from setting up in
Nicaragua, as it encourages companies to pull out. The
Dole Fruit Company followed the government's advice
and left just as.the banana harvest was about to begin.
The result was chaos.
Furthermore, in the multilateral lending agencies of
which the U.S. is a member, the government is using its
influence to deny loans to Nicaragua — loans that are
meant to be free of political bias. Finally, recent attacks
by U.S.-backed contras have been aimed primarily at
economically vital targets, such as oil depots and fac
tories.
On the diplomatic level, the U.S. is doing everything
in its power to discredit the Sandanista regime, labeling
it "totalitarian" and a "threat to security." The U.S. is
also spearheading efforts to form a Central American
alliance against Nicaragua. And of course, the U.S.
downplays as much as possible the positive changes the
Sandanistas have brought about, such as the
phenomenal drop in in the illiteracy rate, agrarian
reform and improvements in health care.
Finally, on the military level, the U.S. has been back
ing the anti-Sandanista contras, most of whom are
former members of Anastosio Samoza's National
Guard. They have little popular support, and are surely
losing whatever support they have as reports of the
atrocities they commit against their own people drift
back every day from the border region with Honduras.
In this regard, two news stories that appeared in last
Friday's papers were extremely important. First more
than 100 U.S.-backed contras launched their most fero
cious attack against Nicaragua yet, killing 32 people in
the northern town of Pantasma. They also destroyed

three food distribution centers, an adult education
headquarters and two peasant cooperative buildings.
And these are the men who, with the aid of the CIA, are
trying to "liberate" Nicaragua.
The ferocity of this attack made all the more important
and appropriate the second news item of last Friday: the
vote in the House of Representatives to cut off all covert
aid to the contras. This was a great step in the direction
of justice, and gave some cause for hope. Yet the
Republican-controlled Senate will pass its own bill on
the matter sometime this week, undoubtedly leaving aid
for the contras intact. And even if all direct military aid is
cut off, the United States has diplomatic and economic
measures at its disposal. Thus, the matter is far from
resolved, and in the meantime, the not-so-covert war
will continue.
So the question remains. Why is the United States
fighting Nicargua? All evidence points to an eventual
overthrow of the Sandanista government — a govern
ment which is trying to implement and institutionalize
the very principles upon which our country is founded.
In pursuing such an overthrow, the U.S..is not oflly
committing a hypocritical, morally untenable offense
against the Nicaraguan people, it is also damaging its
own interests in Central America. If our government
continues its present policy in Nicaragua, it will only
strengthen the determination of the Nicaraguan people
against the United States — regardless of the composi
tion of their government. Installing another Samoza-like
puppet catering to U.S. interests would be meaningless
in a country where the government ruled by terror and
had no popular support. The revolution would simply
continue.
If, by contrast, the United States supported the San
danistas, it could achieve the dual roles of democratiz
ing Nicaraguan society and establishing Nicaragua as a
strong U.S. ally. This would, of course, be "changing
boats in midstream," and would be confusing to friends

ment - a government which is

and foes alike. It would also probably be viewed as a loss
of political will by some foreign countries. However,
consider the alternatives: As the U.S. applied more and
more pressure to the Sandanistas, Nicaraguan society
would become increasingly polarized and repressive
out of necessity, and would turn more and more to the
Cubans and Russians for aid. Thus we would have exact
ly what our government is trying to prevent: A
repressive Russian-puppet regime in the heart of the
Central America.
Nicaragua in 1983 is much like the American colonies
were in 1776. If the United States can look to its own
revolutionary roots and perceive there the elements of
today's Nicaragua, it may be able to contribute to the
ultimate victory of democracy, there. If it cannot, it is we
Americans — as well as the people of Nicaragua — who
will lose out in the end.

also spearheading efforts to form a Central American
alliance against Nicaragua. And of course, the U.S.
downplays as much as possible the positive changes the
Sandanistas have brought about, such as the
phenomenal drop in in the illiteracy rate, agrarian
reform and improvements in health care.
Finally, on the military level, the U.S. has been back
ing the anti-Sandanista contras, most of whom are
former members of Anastosio Samoza's National
Guard. They have little popular support, and are surely
losing whatever support they have as reports of the
atrocities they commit against their own people drift
back every day from the border region with Honduras.
In this regard, two news stories that appeared in last
Friday's papers were extremely important. First more
than 100 U.S.-backed contras launched their most fero
cious attack against Nicaragua yet, killing 32 people in
the northern town of Pantasma. They also destroyed

three food distribution centers, an adult education
headquarters and two peasant cooperative buildings.
And these are the men who, with the aid of the CIA, are
trying to "liberate" Nicaragua.
The ferocity of this attack made all the more important
and appropriate the second news item of last Friday: the
vote in the House of Representatives to cut off all covert
aid to the contras. This was a great step in the direction
of justice, and gave some cause for hope. Yet the
Republican-controlled Senate will pass its own bill on
the matter sometime this week, undoubtedly leaving aid
for the contras intact. And even if all direct military aid is
cut off, the United States has diplomatic and economic
measures at its disposal. Thus, the matter is far from
resolved, and in the meantime, the not-so-covert war
will continue.
So the question remains. Why is the United States
fighting Nicargua? All evidence points to an eventual
overthrow of the Sandanista government — a govern
ment which is trying to implement and institutionalize
the very principles upon which our country is founded.
In pursuing such an overthrow, the U.S..is not oflly
committing a hypocritical, morally untenable offense
against the Nicaraguan people, it is also damaging its
own interests in Central America. If our government
continues its present policy in Nicaragua, it will only
strengthen the determination of the Nicaraguan people
against the United States — regardless of the composi
tion of their government. Installing another Samoza-like
puppet catering to U.S. interests would be meaningless
in a country where the government ruled by terror and
had no popular support. The revolution would simply
continue.
If, by contrast, the United States supported the San
danistas, it could achieve the dual roles of democratiz
ing Nicaraguan society and establishing Nicaragua as a
strong U.S. ally. This would, of course, be "changing
boats in midstream," and would be confusing to friends

and foes alike. It would also probably be viewed as a loss
of political will by some foreign countries. However,
consider the alternatives: As the U.S. applied more and
more pressure to the Sandanistas, Nicaraguan society
would become increasingly polarized and repressive
out of necessity, and would turn more and more to the
Cubans and Russians for aid. Thus we would have exact
ly what our government is trying to prevent: A
repressive Russian-puppet regime in the heart of the
Central America.
Nicaragua in 1983 is much like the American colonies
were in 1776. If the United States can look to its own
revolutionary roots and perceive there the elements of
today's Nicaragua, it may be able to contribute to the
ultimate victory of democracy, there. If it cannot, it is we
Americans — as well as the people of Nicaragua — who
will lose out in the end.

The United States of America was born in the fire and
blood of a revolution against the oppression of a foreign
pOwer. It was an uneven war, matching the pathetic
resources of the colonial army against the military and
financial might of the British Crown. Vet it was a war the
colonies eventually won.
A similar revolution goes on today. This revolution,
like our own 200 years ago, is being carried out by a
small, ill-equipped country against an infinitely superior
foreign power. Only now, the roles are reversed: It is
the U.S. that is trying to dominate and control a small,
struggling nation. The nation is Nicaragua.
Of course, U.S. intervention in Nicaragua is nothing
new. U.S. Marines occupied parts of Nicaragua off and
on for the 24 years between 1909 and 1933. And U.S.
financial experts ran the Nicaraguan customs, national
bank and railroads in the early 19205. But it is only with
the advent of the Reagan administration that the U.S.
has actively and systematically sought to overthrow the
government of Nicaragua.

The Dole Fruit Company followed
the government's advice and left
just as the banana harvest was
about to begin. The result was
chaos.

Economically, the U.S. is doing all it can to damage
Nicaragua. For example, the government is trying to
dissuade new U.S. businesses from setting up in
Nicaragua, as it encourages companies to pull out. The
Dole Fruit Company followed the government's advice
and left just as.the banana harvest was about to begin.
The result was chaos.
Furthermore, in the multilateral lending agencies of
which the U.S. is a member, the government is using its
influence to deny loans to Nicaragua — loans that are
meant to be free of political bias. Finally, recent attacks
by U.S.-backed contras have been aimed primarily at
economically vital targets, such as oil depots and fac
tories.
On the diplomatic level, the U.S. is doing everything
in its power to discredit the Sandanista regime, labeling
it "totalitarian" and a "threat to security." The U.S. is
