# Professor's Commentary: James Adams
## Tech or Fuzzy? Get some of both, balanced is best 
### 
Prof. James Adams has been
teaching at Stanford for 17
years, and has been associate
dean of the School of Engineer
ing for the past seven years. He
is currently teaching a course
entitled "The Nature of Engi
neering" which is an introduc
tion to and overview of the
field of engineering. Adams is
the author of the well-received
book "Conceptual Blockbust
ing," which was published in
1974, and is currently working
on another book concerned
with the management of
creativity in organizations.
I've been invited by The Dai
ly to write a short paper on my
activities at Stanford. Since
they cannot grade me, I will
diverge slightly from that, only
mention what I-am doing, and
spend most of my words telling
you why I am doing it. I am
presently chairing the Program
in Values, Technology, Sci
ence and Society, a 10-year-old
effort to increase the amount
of attention paid to the interac
tion of human values, technol
ogy, science and social institu
tions in the Stanford under
graduate curriculum.
I am also scheming with a
few other faculty members to
develop course material which
will enable non-majors to bet
ter learn the nature of technol
ogy and the mathematical and
physical sciences. My crusade
is to do what I can to promote
better integration of technol
ogy and the sciences into gen
eral education.
Why am I doing this? I like
crusades and this is a particu

larly important one right now
for Stanford. There is increas
ing national recognition of the
fact that our educational sys
tem is not handling technical
and scientific matters as well as
it could and Stanford is in a
strong position to do someth
ing about it. We have a unique
combination of strengths in
engineering, the sciences, the
humanities and the social
sciences on one campus.
Why should these concerns
receive better treatment? The
answer has to do with the in

creasingly critical roles of tech
nology and science as human
activities. As individuals we
pay an escalating cost for being
ignorant of their nature and of
the social costs and effects.
First, we sacrifice opportunity
for intellectual excitement and
reward, for there is beauty and
power in the technological and
scientific disciplines. We also
deny ourselves easy interac
tion with concepts and tech
niques that can be profes
sionally important. Finally, we
handicap our ability to play a

productive role as citizens in a
society which has rightfully
exerted political control over
many aspects of science and
technology. If one examines
our present state of national af
fairs it is easy to find examples
of the problems evolving from
a political decision-making
process which lacks people
who understand the subtleties
of technology and science.
Our society unfortunately
has many of the characteristics
of C.P. Snow's two-cultural
world: the mathematical and
the verbal. Stanford is certainly
not an exception. Students
dislike, but still use the rather
antagonistic terms "tech" and
"fuzzy." Faculty isolate them
selves into "engineering" and
"science" units and trade
misunderstandings and verbal
jabs with those in the
"humanities" while those in
the "social sciences" join one
group or the other depending
upon the extent to which they
utilize mathematical models.
I applaud specialization and
strongly believe in a deep com
mitment to a discipline in or
der to gain a truer understand
ing of the nature of a field and
to acquire a better ability to
utilize its bodies of knowl
edge. However, I have met few
successful people who have
been able to sustain a monastic
dedication to a single dis
cipline throughout their life.
Existence seems to imply
breadth. It is inconvenient to
get through life feeling
awkward around the concepts
and techniques of technology
and science. It is impossible to

avoid issues of human value
and social complexity.
This breadth is unfortunately
often hampered by negative at
titudes as such attitudes are
quite common toward tech
nology and science in our cul
ture. I do not think that my
crusade is particularly more
important than its mirror
image; promoting under
standing of the humanities and
social sciences on the part of
technical majors. However, I
believe that the need for the
latter has been better estab
lished, the benefits have been
accepted, the coursework is
available and the attitudinal
difficulties are less. It is in
dealing with the more quan
titative disciplines that one is
more likely to find the other
wise well-educated person
who exhibits an obvious
allergy.
As I have suggested earlier,
such allergies are costly and
unfortunately not always
based on reasonable grounds.
Among Stanford students, ap
titude is not the reason. Even
though you may be relatively
low in mathematical or verbal

SAT scores compared to your
classmates you are high in the
general population.
Neither is there much of a
genetic explanation. Trends
change too rapidly to allow us
to hold on to explanations
based on convenient biologi
cal stereotyping. About one
quarter of the undergraduate
engineering students at Stan
ford are women and the frac
tion is climbing rapidly. Fifteen
years ago there were almost no
women in engineering. The
general student body at Stan
ford is much more quantitative
in its interests now than it was
10 years ago (the number of
engineering majors has
tripled).
Unfortunately, many of our
negative attitudes are based on
obsolete data concerning so
cial acceptance, mispercep
tions of the true nature of disci
plines, ancient models and
poor teaching in our youth. In
the case of technology and sci
ence many are never given a
fairchance. Stanford, though it
can claim some outstanding
coursework in the interactions
of human values, technology,

science and social institutions
and some excellent introduc
tory courses in the nature of
technology and science, can
do much better. There is a
wealth of knowledge concern
ing the interactions which has
not yet been integrated into
courses. It is certainly possible
to design more introductory
courses which are tailored to
the needs of the non-major
and yet have the intellectual
and conceptual level expected
in our curriculum.
I would like to end by asking
you to examine your own atti
tudes toward academic materi
al outside of your own
preferred fields. Granted that
you are not going to become
an expert in these fields, since
none of us have the time or
even the inclination to become
universal experts, do you have
a true idea of the nature of
these fields and of the activities
of the practitioners and can
you deal with the content with
an open mind? Should you find
that you are queasy about tech
nology and science, look me
up. You are missing a good
deal.

latter has been better estab
lished, the benefits have been
accepted, the coursework is
available and the attitudinal
difficulties are less. It is in
dealing with the more quan
titative disciplines that one is
more likely to find the other
wise well-educated person
who exhibits an obvious
allergy.
As I have suggested earlier,
such allergies are costly and
unfortunately not always
based on reasonable grounds.
Among Stanford students, ap
titude is not the reason. Even
though you may be relatively
low in mathematical or verbal

SAT scores compared to your
classmates you are high in the
general population.
Neither is there much of a
genetic explanation. Trends
change too rapidly to allow us
to hold on to explanations
based on convenient biologi
cal stereotyping. About one
quarter of the undergraduate
engineering students at Stan
ford are women and the frac
tion is climbing rapidly. Fifteen
years ago there were almost no
women in engineering. The
general student body at Stan
ford is much more quantitative
in its interests now than it was
10 years ago (the number of
engineering majors has
tripled).
Unfortunately, many of our
negative attitudes are based on
obsolete data concerning so
cial acceptance, mispercep
tions of the true nature of disci
plines, ancient models and
poor teaching in our youth. In
the case of technology and sci
ence many are never given a
fairchance. Stanford, though it
can claim some outstanding
coursework in the interactions
of human values, technology,

science and social institutions
and some excellent introduc
tory courses in the nature of
technology and science, can
do much better. There is a
wealth of knowledge concern
ing the interactions which has
not yet been integrated into
courses. It is certainly possible
to design more introductory
courses which are tailored to
the needs of the non-major
and yet have the intellectual
and conceptual level expected
in our curriculum.
I would like to end by asking
you to examine your own atti
tudes toward academic materi
al outside of your own
preferred fields. Granted that
you are not going to become
an expert in these fields, since
none of us have the time or
even the inclination to become
universal experts, do you have
a true idea of the nature of
these fields and of the activities
of the practitioners and can
you deal with the content with
an open mind? Should you find
that you are queasy about tech
nology and science, look me
up. You are missing a good
deal.

Prof. James Adams has been
teaching at Stanford for 17
years, and has been associate
dean of the School of Engineer
ing for the past seven years. He
is currently teaching a course
entitled "The Nature of Engi
neering" which is an introduc
tion to and overview of the
field of engineering. Adams is
the author of the well-received
book "Conceptual Blockbust
ing," which was published in
1974, and is currently working
on another book concerned
with the management of
creativity in organizations.
I've been invited by The Dai
ly to write a short paper on my
activities at Stanford. Since
they cannot grade me, I will
diverge slightly from that, only
mention what I-am doing, and
spend most of my words telling
you why I am doing it. I am
presently chairing the Program
in Values, Technology, Sci
ence and Society, a 10-year-old
effort to increase the amount
of attention paid to the interac
tion of human values, technol
ogy, science and social institu
tions in the Stanford under
graduate curriculum.
I am also scheming with a
few other faculty members to
develop course material which
will enable non-majors to bet
ter learn the nature of technol
ogy and the mathematical and
physical sciences. My crusade
is to do what I can to promote
better integration of technol
ogy and the sciences into gen
eral education.
Why am I doing this? I like
crusades and this is a particu

larly important one right now
for Stanford. There is increas
ing national recognition of the
fact that our educational sys
tem is not handling technical
and scientific matters as well as
it could and Stanford is in a
strong position to do someth
ing about it. We have a unique
combination of strengths in
engineering, the sciences, the
humanities and the social
sciences on one campus.
Why should these concerns
receive better treatment? The
answer has to do with the in

creasingly critical roles of tech
nology and science as human
activities. As individuals we
pay an escalating cost for being
ignorant of their nature and of
the social costs and effects.
First, we sacrifice opportunity
for intellectual excitement and
reward, for there is beauty and
power in the technological and
scientific disciplines. We also
deny ourselves easy interac
tion with concepts and tech
niques that can be profes
sionally important. Finally, we
handicap our ability to play a

productive role as citizens in a
society which has rightfully
exerted political control over
many aspects of science and
technology. If one examines
our present state of national af
fairs it is easy to find examples
of the problems evolving from
a political decision-making
process which lacks people
who understand the subtleties
of technology and science.
Our society unfortunately
has many of the characteristics
of C.P. Snow's two-cultural
world: the mathematical and
the verbal. Stanford is certainly
not an exception. Students
dislike, but still use the rather
antagonistic terms "tech" and
"fuzzy." Faculty isolate them
selves into "engineering" and
"science" units and trade
misunderstandings and verbal
jabs with those in the
"humanities" while those in
the "social sciences" join one
group or the other depending
upon the extent to which they
utilize mathematical models.
I applaud specialization and
strongly believe in a deep com
mitment to a discipline in or
der to gain a truer understand
ing of the nature of a field and
to acquire a better ability to
utilize its bodies of knowl
edge. However, I have met few
successful people who have
been able to sustain a monastic
dedication to a single dis
cipline throughout their life.
Existence seems to imply
breadth. It is inconvenient to
get through life feeling
awkward around the concepts
and techniques of technology
and science. It is impossible to

avoid issues of human value
and social complexity.
This breadth is unfortunately
often hampered by negative at
titudes as such attitudes are
quite common toward tech
nology and science in our cul
ture. I do not think that my
crusade is particularly more
important than its mirror
image; promoting under
standing of the humanities and
social sciences on the part of
technical majors. However, I
believe that the need for the
latter has been better estab
lished, the benefits have been
accepted, the coursework is
available and the attitudinal
difficulties are less. It is in
