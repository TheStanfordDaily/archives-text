# New eating plan gets mixed reviews

### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Sterling Quad residents are becoming more
mathematical in their eating habits as the ex
perimental Food Service plan there continues
its second month.
They calcuate the difference between a hot
dog and mineral water and a slice of pizza, and
"How many points do you have left?" is becom
ing as popular an expression as "What's your
major?"

But despite the initial raves, the new meal
plan is now playing to mixed reviews.
There are several advantages immediately ap
parent with the new plan â€” waste has been vir
tually eliminated, meal hours have been
lengthened and an attempt has been made to
equalize food pricing. But according to both the
management of Sterling Food Service and the
residents of Sterling Quad, the program still is

the same, but everyone doesn't eat the same.
The heavy eater gets a good deal and the light
eater doesn't," she said. She explained that the
food-point system might cost a really heavy
eater more than an A' plan, but called that pos
sibility highly unlikely.
"A lot of people are spending fewer points
than we estimated," she said, "so possibly we
even overestimated the amount of food points a
student needs."
Gordon Hecker, a member of the ASSU task
force that designed the new program, said that
he felt that rather than concentrating on saving
the light eater money, Food Service was focus
ing on eliminating waste.
"They've been very successful in eliminating
waste," Hecker said, "but although they seem
concerned with the other goals of the plan, they
aren't giving them enough attention."
Hecker said he felt that there was still not
enough equity in food pricing. "At the moment,
