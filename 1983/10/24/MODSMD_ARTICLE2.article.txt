# New eating plan gets mixed reviews
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Sterling Quad residents are becoming more
mathematical in their eating habits as the ex
perimental Food Service plan there continues
its second month.
They calcuate the difference between a hot
dog and mineral water and a slice of pizza, and
"How many points do you have left?" is becom
ing as popular an expression as "What's your
major?"

But despite the initial raves, the new meal
plan is now playing to mixed reviews.
There are several advantages immediately ap
parent with the new plan — waste has been vir
tually eliminated, meal hours have been
lengthened and an attempt has been made to
equalize food pricing. But according to both the
management of Sterling Food Service and the
residents of Sterling Quad, the program still is
far from perfect.

"This is our learning period," explained Kirby
Tubb, a Food Service manager at Sterling Quad.
"Next quarter, we may follow quite a different
program."
Tubb stressed that the emphasis of the Ster
ling Quad plan was to prevent the light eaters
from subsidizing heavy eaters.
"With the regular meal plan, everyone pays
the same, but everyone doesn't eat the same.
The heavy eater gets a good deal and the light
eater doesn't," she said. She explained that the
food-point system might cost a really heavy
eater more than an A' plan, but called that pos
sibility highly unlikely.
"A lot of people are spending fewer points
than we estimated," she said, "so possibly we
even overestimated the amount of food points a
student needs."
Gordon Hecker, a member of the ASSU task
force that designed the new program, said that
he felt that rather than concentrating on saving
the light eater money, Food Service was focus
ing on eliminating waste.
"They've been very successful in eliminating
waste," Hecker said, "but although they seem
concerned with the other goals of the plan, they
aren't giving them enough attention."
Hecker said he felt that there was still not
enough equity in food pricing. "At the moment,

students are required to purchase a
minimum amount of food points —
the same as a 'B' plan. But there are
still some light eaters who simply
aren't eating that much food," he
said.
According to senior Jeff Ballard,
the Adams House representative to
the Sterling Quad Food Service
Committee, the new plan has been
addressing all concerns of the
original ASSU plan, but the results

were different then the ASSU had
predicted.
"The ASSU was possibly under
the assumption that saving students
money comes with saving waste,"
Ballard said, "but according to the
director of Food Service, these
things do not necessarily go hand
in-hand."
Ballard explained that only when
and if the new plan goes cam
puswide will Food Service be able to
eliminate overhead almost entirely
and bring prices almost down to
retail, which was a goal of the ASSU
plan.

Other complaints about Sterling
Food Service are that the food is of
ten cold, the lines are too long and,
unlike other dorms, Sterling Quad
will not prepare late plates for ath
letes and others who must miss
meals.
Tubb explained that the first two
complaints stem from problems
with the building itself, and the third
is a result of the food point system.
"The serving area is crowded be
cause this building basically is not
being used the way it was de
signed," Tubb said.
