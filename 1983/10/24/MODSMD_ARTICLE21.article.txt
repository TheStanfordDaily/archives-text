## Paye passes for 280 yards in 31-22 Card victory Football team wins — finally 
### 
By^DAM BERNS
Cinderella's Fairy Godmother could
not have done a better job.
Stanford's long slumbering offense fi
nely awoke, its defense learned how to
stop the run and most importantly, Stan
ford won a football game, beating the
University of Arizona 31-22 and bringing a
nme-game losing streak to an end.
■t seemed only fitting that the Car
dinal's losing skid, its longest since 1960,
miiuld end against an Arizona team which
(Heated Stanford to start the streak on
|3v. 6, 1982. Stanford is now 1-6 while
tM Wildcats dropped to 5-2-1.
■coring 31 points, its largest output of
thr season, the Cardinal offense was the
tjMgest surprise.
■fl want to commend the offensive staff
on;,damn near doing the impossible,"
Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin said smiling
*§* r the game. "That's what I feel about
OUf coaching staff.
Hi had a meeting with our offensive
staff on Sunday night. We realized that
wftat we had been trying to do wasn't
working and we had to make some
changes. Our kids responded well."
In an attempt to deal with the blitz, the
Stanford coaches made some changes in
thd Cardinal's passing game. While Stan
ford did not exactly steal San Jose State's
playbook, Wiggin noted the similarity be
tween his team's new passing game and
that of San Jose State.
"We went to a three-step drop, as
opposed to our usual five-seven-step ap
proach," Wiggin said. "A lot of the things
were things that you might have seen
with San Jose State."
The key to the offensive success was
freshman quarterback John Paye. Coming
off an abysmal 4-of-16 performance last
week, Paye cpmpleted 22-of-28 passes for
280 yards arid three touchdowns. Even
more importantly, he did not throw an in
terception.
"He (Paye) had an incredible after
noon," Wiggin said. "He kept the team

on the field with our kind of offense. He
is a hell of a football player. We did not
have to accept that (Arizona quarterback
Tom) Tunnicliffe was the best quarter
back on the field today."
Stanford receiver Emile Harry, who had
caught only 17 passes in six games, finally
broke loose Saturday, grabbing 10 passes
for 179 yards and two touchdowns. Tol
liver also had a fine afternoon, catching
eight passes for 79 yards.
"Harry and Tolliver are perhaps two of
the finest wide receivers in the game,"
Arizona Coach Larry Smith said after the
game. "We tried both zone and man
coverage. They did a good job of picking
up the blitzes, and Paye made the big
plays. Paye probably had the best day of
his career"
While the Cardinal had success
through the air, it also moved the ball fair
ly well on the ground, grinding out 138
yards, 80 yards of it by halfback Shaun
Avant. Stanford also scored its first rus
hing touchdown of the season when run
ning back Stan Gill ran the ball in over
right tackle from three yards out for the
Cardinal's first score.
The Stanford defense also played well
Saturday, especially against the run,
giving up only 82 yards on the ground.
The Cardinal came into the game last in
the Pacific-10 Conference against the run.
The Cardinal, which came into the
game 10th in the nation against the pass,
did a good job of shutting down the
Arizona passing game. Tunnicliffe was 18-
of-30 for 203 yards, with one interception
and no touchdowns, but the statistics are
in some sense misleading because much
of the yardage came against a prevent
Stanford defense in the closing minutes
of the game.
"I think the defense played the best it
has played the whole year," Wiggin said
after the game. "The defensive plan was
simple: Let's go do what we do best."
On the Cardinal's opening series, Paye
fumbled the second snap from center and

Arizona recovered on the Stanford 19-
yard line. Although the Stanford defense
held, Max Zendejas booted a 37-yard field
goal to give Arizona an early 3-0 lead.
The Wildcats came back on their next
series to march 54 yards down the field
for a touchdown, and Stanford was down
10-0.
Stanford came back to score a touch
down on an 80-yard drive, but looked like
it was going back to charity football on its
following series when Arizona recovered
a fumble by Gill on the Stanford 7-yard
line to set up a touchdown.
The Cardinal, however, came right
back. Paye capped a 68-yard drive, throw
ing a perfect 35-yard scoring strike to Har
ry who beat Arizona defensive back Greg
Turner on a post pattern. Paye had called
an audible on the play, picking up an
Arizona blitz.
Stanford tied the score at 17-17 just
before the end of the first half as Avant
led a barrage of running against an
Arizona prevent defense which put Har
mon in field goal range.
Arizona took the lead only one more
time, at the start of the second half, when
Stanford punter Trip Hardin had a punt
blocked, and the Wildcats cashed in with
a Zendejas field goal.
The Cardinal scored on the next series
when Harry took a pass in the right flat,
made an inside move to beat linebacker
Steve Boadway and noseguard Joe Drake,
and then sprinted to the right corner of
the end zone for the score, giving Stan
ford a 24-20 lead.
Stanford's final score came with just
over eight minutes left in the game as
Avant plunged the ball in over right
tackle. Harry held the drive together,
catching passes of 11, 20 and 23 yards.
The Wildcats added two points in the
closing seconds when Paye took an inten
tional safety to negate the risk of having a
punt blocked.

Eric Mullins hauls in a fourth-quarter touchdown pass from John Pave to put Stanford
ahead 31-20 and put the game on ice. On the day, Paye completed 22-of-28 passes for
280 yards and three touchdowns.
From the locker room
Arizona Coach Smith may
| have been just a week off on
j his assessment of Paye. Before
the game, Smith said that he
thought Paye had been im
proving every week, a some
what silly comment following
Paye's 4-for-16 performance

one week ago, but rather apt
following Saturday's game.
Cardinal defensive tackle
Terry Jackson started Saturday
in place of Mike Wyman who
was suffering from the flu.
Jackson started last year as a
nose guard but was relegated
to a reserve role this year as
Stanford changed from a 3-4
defense to a 4-3.
The person who seemed

most pleased by Stanford's
new offense was Paye. "I think
we had a great scheme going
into the game," Paye said.
"We did something (3-step
drops) that they hadn't seen
before."
But according to Paye, the
key thing may have been just
going out and having a good
time. "I think the key to our
pre-game speech was just to
go out and have fun."
