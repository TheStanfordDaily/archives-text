# Forgotten Harry breaks away in new offense
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
For anyone else, it would
have been the game of a
lifetime. For Stanford's
Emile Harry, it was about
time.
Harry, the junior wide
receiver from Fountain Val
ley, had not been having the
kind of season one would
expect from a pre-season
Ail-American candidate. In
six games, he had caught
just 17 passes — an average
of less than three recep
tions an outing.
That all changed Satur
day.
The 5-foot-11, 166-pound
Harry was nothing less than
spectacular Saturday in
Stanford's 31-22 upset vic
tory over Arizona. His statis
tics — 10 catches for 179
yards and two touchdowns
— speak for themselves.
The 179 yards was the
third best day for a Stanford
receiver in University his
tory. Only halfback Darrin
Nelson and receiver James
Lofton, both presently Na
tional Football League stars,
have recorded more receiv
ing yardage in a single day
wearing a Stanford uniform.
"Everybody's kind of
looking for a day like
today," Harry said.
"(Quarterback) John (Paye)
was putting the ball right
there and all the (passing)
leads were just perfect."
Harry's performance
came as no surprise to
Arizona Coach Larry Smith,
however. "He's a great
wide receiver," Smith
praised. "We've said all
along, both Harry and (Mike
Tolliver) are perhaps two of
the finest wide receivers
we'll see all year on one
team. I still believe that."
Much of Harry's in
creased role in the offense
Saturday compared to Stan
ford's first six games can be
attributed to the Cardinal's
new offensive scheme, one
oased on shorter quarter
back drops and quicker
pass patterns.
"This thing (the new of
fense) is built for him
(Harry)," Stanford Coach
Paul Wiggin said. "This of
fense ends up featuring
him. He got a lot of one-on
one (coverage) because of
the diversion that comes
from it. And he's pretty hard
to cover one-on-one."
Arizona's defensive back
field found that out the hard
way on Harry's first touch
down grab, a 35-yarder at
the 10:22 mark in the
second quarter with Stan
ford trailing 17-7.
Paye saw Arizona prepar
ing to blitz, so he audibled a
play that sent Harry, lined

up on the right, into the
right corner of the end zone
against man-to-man
coverage. Stanford's offen
sive line picked up the blitz
well and gave Paye enough
time to complete the 35-
yard pass to Harry, who
made a sensational over
the-shoulder catch.
Harry's second TD in the
third quarter put Stanford
ahead for good, 24-20.
"When Mike (Tolliver) went
into motion, they rotated
back into man-to-man and I
could see that the inside
linebacker (Rickey Hunley)
was blitzing, so I knew there
was nobody inside to help
him," he explained. ")ohn
(Paye) threw it around the
defensive end and I just
took off."
"Took off" in the sense
that once Harry caught the
ball at the Arizona 20, he put
a brilliant fake on corner
back Greg Turner and then
outran the rest of Wildcat
defense into the end zone
to complete the 27-yard
play.
With Saturday's num

bers, Harry moved up in
many Stanford statistical
categories. In two and a half
seasons, he has caught 81
passes for 1555 yards and 10
touchdowns.
His career yards per catch
figure of 19.2 ranks second
on the Stanford all-time list
and his 1555 receiving yards
is seventh, just a yard shy of
the No. 6 ranked Cardinal
pass-catcher, Bill McColl.
If Harry averages five
catches a game for the
remainder of this season,
he will move into the top
ten in Stanford career
receptions, a list that in
cludes such names as Ken
Margerum, Tony Hill and
Gene Washington.
Though Harry caught 10
passes — more than half his
season output at that point
— Saturday as a result of the
new offensive scheme, he
believes his job on the team
is the same.
"I don't see my role as
changing," he said. "I'm a
receiver and I'm there to
catch passes whenever my
number is called."

Much of Harry's in
creased role in the offense
Saturday compared to Stan
ford's first six games can be
attributed to the Cardinal's
new offensive scheme, one
oased on shorter quarter
back drops and quicker
pass patterns.
"This thing (the new of
fense) is built for him
(Harry)," Stanford Coach
Paul Wiggin said. "This of
fense ends up featuring
him. He got a lot of one-on
one (coverage) because of
the diversion that comes
from it. And he's pretty hard
to cover one-on-one."
Arizona's defensive back
field found that out the hard
way on Harry's first touch
down grab, a 35-yarder at
the 10:22 mark in the
second quarter with Stan
ford trailing 17-7.
Paye saw Arizona prepar
ing to blitz, so he audibled a
play that sent Harry, lined

up on the right, into the
right corner of the end zone
against man-to-man
coverage. Stanford's offen
sive line picked up the blitz
well and gave Paye enough
time to complete the 35-
yard pass to Harry, who
made a sensational over
the-shoulder catch.
Harry's second TD in the
third quarter put Stanford
ahead for good, 24-20.
"When Mike (Tolliver) went
into motion, they rotated
back into man-to-man and I
could see that the inside
linebacker (Rickey Hunley)
was blitzing, so I knew there
was nobody inside to help
him," he explained. ")ohn
(Paye) threw it around the
defensive end and I just
took off."
"Took off" in the sense
that once Harry caught the
ball at the Arizona 20, he put
a brilliant fake on corner
back Greg Turner and then
outran the rest of Wildcat
defense into the end zone
to complete the 27-yard
play.
With Saturday's num

bers, Harry moved up in
many Stanford statistical
categories. In two and a half
seasons, he has caught 81
passes for 1555 yards and 10
touchdowns.
His career yards per catch
figure of 19.2 ranks second
on the Stanford all-time list
and his 1555 receiving yards
is seventh, just a yard shy of
the No. 6 ranked Cardinal
pass-catcher, Bill McColl.
If Harry averages five
catches a game for the
remainder of this season,
he will move into the top
ten in Stanford career
receptions, a list that in
cludes such names as Ken
Margerum, Tony Hill and
Gene Washington.
Though Harry caught 10
passes — more than half his
season output at that point
— Saturday as a result of the
new offensive scheme, he
believes his job on the team
is the same.
"I don't see my role as
changing," he said. "I'm a
receiver and I'm there to
catch passes whenever my
number is called."

Stanford receiver Emile Harry, who had caught just 17
passes in his first six games, grabbed 10 Paye tosses
Saturday for 179 yards and two touchdowns in the Car
dinal's 31-22 victory.
For anyone else, it would
have been the game of a
lifetime. For Stanford's
Emile Harry, it was about
time.
Harry, the junior wide
receiver from Fountain Val
ley, had not been having the
kind of season one would
expect from a pre-season
Ail-American candidate. In
six games, he had caught
just 17 passes — an average
of less than three recep
tions an outing.
That all changed Satur
day.
The 5-foot-11, 166-pound
Harry was nothing less than
spectacular Saturday in
Stanford's 31-22 upset vic
tory over Arizona. His statis
tics — 10 catches for 179
yards and two touchdowns
— speak for themselves.
The 179 yards was the
third best day for a Stanford
receiver in University his
tory. Only halfback Darrin
Nelson and receiver James
Lofton, both presently Na
tional Football League stars,
have recorded more receiv
ing yardage in a single day
wearing a Stanford uniform.
"Everybody's kind of
looking for a day like
today," Harry said.
"(Quarterback) John (Paye)
was putting the ball right
there and all the (passing)
leads were just perfect."
Harry's performance
came as no surprise to
Arizona Coach Larry Smith,
however. "He's a great
wide receiver," Smith
praised. "We've said all
along, both Harry and (Mike
Tolliver) are perhaps two of
the finest wide receivers
we'll see all year on one
team. I still believe that."
