# Water polo team beats No. 8 UOP

### ROB ZWEIG 
Junior goalie Steve Moyer
and a hustling Stanford
defense strangled No. 8
ranked University of Pacific
and its potent offense to lead
the water polo team to a 6-3
win that completed the Card's
weekend sweep of two Nor
thern California opponents at
De Guerre pool.
Saturday's victory was the
rubber match of a three-game
season set with UOP, now 10-
10, and followed a 13-4 shel
lacking of Santa Clara of
Friday. Those two triumphs

pushed the No. 5 Cardinal's
season record to 11-7-3 and
extended its unbeaten string
to six games.
Moyer, a third-team All-
American in 1982 and the
club's only returning starter
from a year ago, racked up 18
saves, including five in a tense
final quarter in which the Card
nursed a precarious two-goal
lead.
"It doesn't do a lot of good
if you make the first quarter
saves and then don't do it in
the fourth quarter," Moyer
said afterwards, "but credit a

great part of our success to
great team defense."
The swarming Stanford
defense conceived by Head
Coach Dante Dettamanti was
an attempt to bottle-up UOP's
strong outside shooting attack
led by Mike Haley (35 goals)
and Kevin Hernandez (25).
"We wanted to put the pres
sure on them outside and
force them to take low
percentage shots," Detta
manti explained. "You end up
giving them the inside water
off the drive, but against this
team you have to keep the

pressure on."
The strategy worked
through a closely contested
first quarter in which Stanford
jumped to a 1-0 advantage
when freshman David Imber
nino connected on a feed
from freshman Craig Klass, a
sight that would become
familiar as the game wore on.
The Tigers came out growl
ing in the second frame as
Redwood City native Carl
Gunn twice caught the Car
dinal switching defensive as
signments. He beat Moyer
with two bullets from six

Craig Klass, one of Stanford's crew of fantastic frosh, goes after a loose ball in Friday's win over Santa (lara.
meters away to give UOP a
brief 2-1 lead in a game that
was shaping up as one of
those events where you
wonder if it is good defense or
sloppy offense that is causing
all the confusion.
A little bit of both,"
responded Dettamanti. "Our
was off when we tried
t'6 drive, so the offense never
really clicked."
Part of the problem was that
freshman Chris Thompson
: replaced Klass in the hole, and
k-Thompson and his teammates
had not played together since
jpthe ex-high school star from
' Lafayette was injured one

month ago.
Still, when Chris Woolfolk
skipped a low shot by UOP
goalie Michael Ennis with 1: 37
to go, Stanford had knotted
the count at two entering the
intermission.
Imbernino chalked up his
31st and 32nd goals on assists
from Klass, and Grant Stanley
added another as the Cardinal
built a three-goal lead in the
third period.
The home team tried to
keep the contest interesting
by giving up a cheap goal
when UOP's John Lautze
tapped in a rebound as the
horn sounded ending the
third period.
That goal cut Stanford's cus
hion to 5-3 and was the type of
play that prompted Detta
manti to say that he was "not

100 percent satisfied with the
defense."
"But," he added, "you must
be something right when they
only score three goals."
Moyer and company wea
thered a fourth quarter
onslaught by the Tigers, but
refused to yield as the only
goal of the period came at the
other end of the pool when
Chris Thompson scored with
just two seconds left.
Moyer recognized that he
may have escaped alive with
out a little help. "The Wings
played super 'D' all game. It's
not hard to look good in the
goal when everyone's helping
out on defense," he said.
Everyone looked good on
Friday as Stanford flattened
the Santa Clara Broncos by
scoring the game's first 11

goals and then coasting to a
13-4 victory. Greg Ocasek led
the Cardinal attack with four
scores, all of them in the
second period.
Stanford must now prepare
for two important home
matches this week. Friday the
Card will square off against
USC (tied for sth nationally
with Stanford) Saturday mor
ning the team plays Long
Beach State. Both matches are
at home.
