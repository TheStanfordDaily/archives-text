# Water polo team beats No. 8 UOP
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Junior goalie Steve Moyer
and a hustling Stanford
defense strangled No. 8
ranked University of Pacific
and its potent offense to lead
the water polo team to a 6-3
win that completed the Card's
weekend sweep of two Nor
thern California opponents at
De Guerre pool.
Saturday's victory was the
rubber match of a three-game
season set with UOP, now 10-
10, and followed a 13-4 shel
lacking of Santa Clara of
Friday. Those two triumphs

pushed the No. 5 Cardinal's
season record to 11-7-3 and
extended its unbeaten string
to six games.
Moyer, a third-team All-
American in 1982 and the
club's only returning starter
from a year ago, racked up 18
saves, including five in a tense
final quarter in which the Card
nursed a precarious two-goal
lead.
"It doesn't do a lot of good
if you make the first quarter
saves and then don't do it in
the fourth quarter," Moyer
said afterwards, "but credit a

great part of our success to
great team defense."
The swarming Stanford
defense conceived by Head
Coach Dante Dettamanti was
an attempt to bottle-up UOP's
strong outside shooting attack
led by Mike Haley (35 goals)
and Kevin Hernandez (25).
"We wanted to put the pres
sure on them outside and
force them to take low
percentage shots," Detta
manti explained. "You end up
giving them the inside water
off the drive, but against this
team you have to keep the

pressure on."
The strategy worked
through a closely contested
first quarter in which Stanford
jumped to a 1-0 advantage
when freshman David Imber
nino connected on a feed
from freshman Craig Klass, a
sight that would become
familiar as the game wore on.
The Tigers came out growl
ing in the second frame as
Redwood City native Carl
Gunn twice caught the Car
dinal switching defensive as
signments. He beat Moyer
with two bullets from six
