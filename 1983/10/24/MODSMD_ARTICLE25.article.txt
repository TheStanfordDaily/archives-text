# Defense bottles up Arizona
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Stanford's 31-22 victory
over 19th-ranked Arizona
Saturday was a game Mike
Wyman was sorry he
missed.
Wyman, normally the
Cardinal's starting left de
fensive tackle, contracted
the flu last week. With the
exception of a few plays,
Wyman did not see action,
and he missed playing a part
in a win to which the Stan
ford defensive line contrib
uted.
"The most impressive
thing about the defensive
line was its pass rush,"

Wyman said after the game.
"They (the defensive line)
also did a good job stringing
out against the quick tosses.
That's one play we knew
they'd hurt us with and we
did an excellent job stop
ping it."
Senior strong safety
Vaughn Williams said one
of the keys to stopping the
Wildcat passing game was
the four-man rush of the de
fensive line.
The Cardinal defensive
line was able to penetrate
effectively when Arizona
passed, chasing Arizona
quarterback Tom Tun

nicliffe out of the pocket
and forcing hurried throws.
As a unit, the defensive line
recorded two sacks and
deflected two Tunnicliffe
passes.
Junior Terry Jackson, who
started in Wyman's place,
teamed with Carin Veris for
one sack. Jackson also was
one of two Stanford
defenders who recorded
double figures in tackling.
"He (Jackson) had to
come and play because
Mike Wyman was in Cowell
(Student Health Center) on
Wednesday with a tempera
ture of 103," Stanford

Coach Paul Wiggin said
after the game. "They (the
Arizona offensive line) went
from the up position a lot.
We felt like we could con
trol that, at least penetrate
that, and I was disappointed
a little bit at the end of the
game — and our kids might
have been tired — that we
didn't do a little better job
with that. But they played
well."
While the Cardinal con
tained Tunnicliffe and the
Wildcat passing game to the
tune of 208 yards, it put a lid
on Arizona's running game.
Vance Johnson, whose
breakaway speed (he has
run a 4.3-second 40-yard
dash) enabled him to score
eight touchdowns in seven
games prior to Saturday,
was held to 46 yards on 15
carries. Wildcat rushing
leader Chris Brewer, who
was averaging 5.5 yards per
carry before Saturday,
gained only 15 yards on five
carries.
Oddly enough, Stanford
had a simple solution for
the problem of the Arizona
running game.
"The plan was simple.
From the standpoint of con
cept, we did not create a
new defense. I think the
deployment of people, in
particular, had a lot to do
with what we were doing,"
Wiggin said, adding that de
fensive coach Andy Chris
toff provided valuable input
in the situations when Stan
ford used a three-and four
man defensive fronts.
While Wiggin had
numerous reasons for his
defense's improved perfor
mance, Smith had a concise
way of summarizing his
team's defeat. "They out
played us, outcoached us
and outeverythinged us."
