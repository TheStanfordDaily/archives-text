# Soccer team beats UOP 1-0
## 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
The Stanford men's soccer
team hung on to an early 1-0
lead to quell the University of
the Pacific (UOP) Saturday
morning.
"Stanford did a good job to
shut us down," UOP coach
Bruce Spaulding said. Specifi
cally, Stanford's goal keeper
Willie Burkhardt shut UOP
down.
"He (Burkhardt) was
definitely the main player in
Stanford's lineup today,"
Spaulding said. Each lime UOP
began to dominate play on
Stanford's end of the field,
Burkhardt would take the wind
out of their sails with an easy
save.
"They (UOP) attacked well,"
Burkhardt said. "This is one of
the games where I had to do
the most."
The "most" included catch
ing a rocket of a shot off UOP's
leading scorer Dalton Duvall
who is also the league's
leading scorer.

"A goalie gains a psychologi
cal edge over the opposing
team when he is able to catch
one of their hardest hit shots,"
Spaulding said. "If he had just
deflected it, I would have felt
better."
Saturday's game was
Burkhardt's fifth shutout in
nine victories. "They were
good until Duvall got red
carded," Burkhardt said.
With 14:20 left in the game,
Duvall and Burkhardt charged
toward the ball. Stanford
goalie Burkhardt leapt for the
ball and grasped it safely in his
arms. Duval barreled into
Burkhardt while he was in
midair. When the official took
Duval out of the game it also
took the punch out of UOP's
offense.
On Stanford's only goal,
Todd Rafalovich came blazing
toward the goal but got
pushed by a worried defender.
Rafalovich recovered and pen
etrated to the goal mouth with
a chance to score. Then the

same defender slide tackled
him illegally in the penalty box.
As a result, Jorge Titinger
had a free penalty shot. He had
no problem converging on the
shot at 28:04. "It was a hard
low shot," Titinger said. "It
wasn't well placed, but for
tunately, it went in."
Although Stanford only
scored one goal, it had many
opportunities later in the
game. "We penetrated well
but we were trying to get too
close to the goal before taking
a shot," Titinger said.
Since Stanford had a one
goal lead, it spent most of its
time setting up a goal and was
unable to actually get the ball
in the net. "We had two quick
attacks," Stanford Coach Nel
son Lodge said, "We played
well and dominated but did
not finish strong."
The victory puts Stanford's
season record at 9-3-2, but it
must face one of its toughest
matches on Wednesday
against Fresno Pacific.
