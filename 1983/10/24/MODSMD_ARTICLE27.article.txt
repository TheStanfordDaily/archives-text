## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The Stanford men's golf team finished
hird in its Fall Intercollegiate this week;
>ut there were a lot of "ands, ifs, or buts"
vith this one.
Stanford's top golfer, freshman Rich
4ari k, finished with a 54-hole total of 219,
ood enough for a tie for fifth place in the
idividual competition. Marik's score,
lowever, did not count toward Stanford's
earn tally since he was one of four Car
linal golfers entered as an individual.
Had Marik been among the six Stanford
team" golfers, the Cardinal would have
inished second — by a stroke — to first
ilace USC and ahead of Nevada-Reno,
/hich took second.
The two-day, 18-team tournament was
layed over the par-71, 6835-yard Stanford
loif Course and divided into two 27-hole
Segments Friday and Saturday.

Marik's first-day score of 107 was the
lowest among the 10 Stanford golfers. On
the second day, sophomore Doug
Monroe fired an even par 106, the Car
dinal's low. Monroe, like Marik, was en
tered in the individual portion of the invi
tational and thus his score didn't count for
Stanford either.
USC totalled 1109, seven shots ahead of
second-place Nevada-Reno at 1116. Stan
ford tied for third with Fresno State in third
at 1119, followed by UCLA at 1126, and
Oregon and Arizona State at 1127.
USC's Sam Randolph took medalist
honors with a one-over-par 214 and Trojan
teammate John Flannery was tied for
second at 216 with Pacific's Ken Earl an
Mark Gilmartin. Tied with Marik in fifth
was Miami's Woody Austin at 219, six
strokes over par.
But it was the seventh-place finisher that

received the most attention. Nathaniel
Crosby, the former US Amateur champion
and son of the late Bing Crosby, slipped to
a 220 after leading the tournament for 27
holes.
Crosby and Austin, however, had little
help from their teammates as Miami
finished 12th in the team competition.
Other Stanford linksters in the top 20
were Don Walsworth who tied for ninth at
221 and Carl Wagner who tied for 16th at
222. Tim Robinson checked in at 227, in
cluding a one-under-par 35 on the front
nine during the first day.
Scott Erickson, who suffered a hand in
jury the first day, and Doug Thompson
each had 228's, while Lanny Sawchuck
fired a 229. Two other Cardinal golfers
competing in the individual competition
were Cole Thompson (240) and Phil
Rowley (234).


tJathaniel Crosby, the son of the late Bing Crosby, finished
eventh in the Stanford Fall Intercollegiate. Crosby, a redshirt

Art Streiber/Daily
senior at Miami, led the two-day tournament after the first
day.
