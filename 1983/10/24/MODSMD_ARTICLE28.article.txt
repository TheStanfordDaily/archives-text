## 
### TOM MOORE 
In its most exciting home
match this season, the Stan
ford women's volleyball team
outlasted the Arizona State
University Sun Devils 15-11 in
the fifth game to record its
eighth conference victory.
Winning the first two games
handily by scores of 15-6 and
15-7, the women spikers
seemed to have the match
clinched, but ASU roared back
behind senior Ail-American
Lisa Stuck to knot the match at
two apiece.
"ASU was ice-cold the first
two games but red-hot the

next two," said Cardinal assis
tant coach Don Shaw after the
match,"but any team is going
to have a letdown now and
then, especially with a
schedule like ours."
After scoring a combined
seven points in the two losses,
the women spikers got tough
when it ( ounted, battling back
from a 4-0 deficit to turn back
ASU's momentum. Finally,
with a key block from Bobbi
Broer at 10-10, Stanford se
cured the victory.
Kim Oden and Barbara Fon
tana led the offense for the

Card with 14 and nine kills
respectively. Oden also con
tributed seven blocks.
Saturday night the Cardinal
defeated the University of
Arizona behind an impressive
display of ball control offense.
Ahead again 2-0, the women
spikers succumbed in the
third game 12-15 to the
Wildcats. Regaining control in
the fourth contest, however,
Stanford broke a 6-6 tie with
nine straight points to take the
match 15-9, 15-4, 12-15, 15-6.
The weekend victories im
proved the Cardinal's record
to 13-2 overall.
