### SEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
I the most comprehensive review since 1975 of the
fjv<extradepartmental programs, an ad hoc committee
ha been formed to look at both the structure of these
udergraduate programs and their relationship to
oler University academic bodies.
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences Carolyn
i/jgee was asked by the Committee on Undergraduate
lidies of the Faculty Senate to form the ad hoc body,
le Review Committee on Extradepartmental Educa
l>n. The Faculty Senate committee, which has usually
[viewed only two of the programs, SCIRE and
[wOPSI, every three years, decided this year to in
clude the Action Research Liaison Office (ARLO), the Un
dergraduate Research Opportunity Program and the
Undergraduate Special Program in the study.
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow will chair the ad hoc
committee, which includes seven other faculty mem
bers, two student members and Lougee, who is also an
associate professor of history, as a member ex-officio.
The committee will undertake a study of the five pro
grams, including the first review ever of the Undergrad
uate Special Program, and will, according to Lougee,
consider "any educational activities that ought to take
place extradepartmentally and are not."
Asked to explain this, Lougee said that "there have
been discussions from time to time of looking at the ex
tent to which Stanford students do extracurricular
work," such as internships. She said that the commit

tee would investigate whether undergraduates should
be encouraged to undertake such outside work.
The committee will also, according to Lougee, study
residence-based classes and a possible system of up
perclass seminars, modeled after the Freshman and
Sophomore Seminar programs.
Directors of extradepartmental programs inter
viewed by The Daily generally welcomed the review, al
though they were unsure of changes it might recom
mend.
"I think all programs should be reviewed occasion
ally to see what they're supposed to do and what
they're doing," said Andre Burnett, co-director of
SWOPSI. However, he noted that "I really have no idea
of what they'll come up with, and I don't think they do
either."
Laura Selznick, director of both the Undergraduate
Special Program and the Undergraduate Research Op
portunity Program, mentioned that "we hope that the
programs are changed as little as possible," but added
that her organizations would implement changes as di
rected.
The committee has had one meeting so far, at which
only administrative details were discussed, according
to Arrow. Its next meeting, set for tomorrow, will con
sist of a day-long interview process with the heads of
each of the programs. Lougee said that she asked the
committee to make its report to the Office of the Dean
of Humanities and Sciences by the end of winter quar
ter.
