Grenada fears U.S. invasion
Port of Spain, Trinidad — Grenada's ruling military
council placed its armed forces on alert and called
up militia reserves yesterday in the face of what it
said was an approaching threat of U.S. invasion.
The actions, announced over the official Radio
Free Grenada, came as eastern Caribbean leaders
met for the second day here to decide on sanctions
against General Hudson Hustin and his If>-member
council, which seized control of the tiny island last
Wednesday in a bloody coup that killed Prime Mini
ster Maurice Bishop and 16 others by official
Grenadian count.
Sources involved in the discussions here said the
Caribbean prime minsters were mainly seeking

agreement on economic and political santions. The
likelihood of U.S. military action on the 133-square
mile island also was part of their talks, they added,
because Washington would be reluctant to act with
out at least tacit approval from the region's demo
cratic governments.
Expressions of concern in Washington about the
safety of nearly 1000 Americans on Grenada have
been interpreted by officials here as a possible effort
to set the stage for their evacuation by a pair of U.S.
Navy task forces reported sailing toward the eastern
Caribbean.
One problem facing the leaders gathered here is
how to portray any U.S. intervention to avoid the
issue of "imperialism'' already raised by Grenada
and the Soviet Union, the officials said.
Lt. Col. Liam James, one of the council's two vice
chairmen under Hustin, declared that the Reagan
adminstration's expressions of concern "are blatant
lies and a fabricated excuse tor staging an invasion
of our country." In a radio broadcast he called on
the people to get readv to tight and "protect the in
tegrity and sovereignity of our homeland to the last
man."
Grenada has received Soviet-designed weapons
since the March 13, 1979 revolution which led to an
alliance with Cuba and the Soviet Union. It has or
ganized armed forces estimated by U.S. officials to
number more than 2000. Some troops are armed
with Ak-47 assault rifles and can call on at least 60
armored personnel carriers equipped with machine
guns.
But for the most part, Grenada's armed forces are
made of poorly-trained and poorly-armed
militiamen. During a war of words with the Reagan
administration last spring, for instance, Hustin
called on the population to bring in hunting rifles
and even shovels to help the militia prepare
defenses against what he declared then was going to
be a CIA-led invasion by counterrevolutionary
Grenadians from a neighboring island.
In his broadcast lames urged all militiamen who
have not yet reported to their stations to call in their
locations. It also ordered Grenadians in possession
of government vehicles to drive them to several
points on the island pinpointed by the announcer.
As a measure of Grenadian concern over possible
U.S. intervention, the information ministry in St.
George's, the capitol, telephoned the text of James'
statement to the Barbados headquarters of the
Caribbean news agency, Cana.
In addition, Radio Free Grenada Saturday night
broadcast a statement by Maj. Chris Stroude, a
council member, pledging to form a national recon
ciliation cabinet, "within the next 10 to 14 days."
"In appointing a new cabinet, the Revolutionary
Military Council will operate on the basis of ensur
ing that all social classes and interests in our country
are represented," Stroude said.
He said the council places greatest emphasis on
economic development for the island's 110,000 in
habitants and, ironically, expressed belief that in
creasing tourism to Grenada's white-sand beaches
"is a critical factor in ensuring the most rapid devel
opment of our country."
The late Prime Minister Bishop had insisted that
Grenada's construction of a 9000 foot airport would
boost tourism sharply, removing the need for
European travelers to stop on neighboring islands
and transfer to small planes able to land at the is
land's outdated Pearl Airport.
The Reagan administration charged, however, that
the new facility, built with Cuban aid and engineers,
presented the Soviet Union with a potential air base
amid vital oil-shipping lanes.
Western Europe: no U.S. missiles
Nearly a halt-million demonstrators poured
through the streets of Brussels, Madrid and Paris
yesterday in the second day of Western European
protest against deployment of new U.S. nuclear
missiles.
Anti-missile campaigners hailed the weekend tur
nout of more than one and a half million people as a
clear sign of widespread opposition to the impend
ing deployment of 572 Pershing II and cruise
missiles.
There were no reports of arrests or violence yes
terday. On Saturday, when more than a million
Western Europeans sat in, formed human chains
and marched, West German police arrested 450
protestors.
In Brussels, marchers converged in three columns
on the city center in the biggest anti-missile protest
ever in Belgium. There was no official count, but
police said the crowd was much larger than the tur

nout of 200,000 in an October 1981 demonstration.
Organizers estimated the number yesterday at
300,000.
The rally took place about five miles from the
headquarters of the NATO, where it was decided
four years ago to deploy the medium-range U.S.
missiles to counter 243 Soviet SS-20 missiles targeted
on Europe. The deployment begins in less than 10
weeks unless a U.S.-Soviet arms control accord is
first reached.
Under the NATO plan, West Germany will take
108 Pershing II missiles and 96 cruise missiles. Bel
gium will deploy 48 cruise missiles, the Netherlands
60, Britain 160 and Italy 112.
In Madrid, police said about 150,000 people took
part in a march behind a banner that read, "For A
Europe Without Missiles." An additional 6000 dem
onstrated in Barcelona and 10,000 in Oviedo.
Gerardo Iglesias, Secretary General of the Spanish
Communist Party, said the demonstration showed
that the "people are against NATO," which Spain
joined last year.
In Paris, the demonstration was against both the
Soviet and NATO missiles, in contrast to a Saturday
protest march aimed solely at the NATO deploy
ment.
About 10,000 protesters linked arms from the U.S.
Embassy just off the Place de la Concorde, across
two Seine bridges to the Soviet Embassy on
Boulevard Lannes — a distance of three miles. They
chanted "No! No! Nyet! Nyet! Neither Pershing
Nor SS-20."
In Saturday's protests, some 200,000 people
marched to a rally in London's Hyde Park, a similar
number paraded in Rome and tens of thousands
demonstrated in Paris, Vienna and Stockholm. In
West Germany, more than 850,000 turned out
nationwide Saturday.
Western governments continued to insist that the
marches won't stop the scheduled deployment.
"There is no change," said a spokesman at the of
fice of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
London.
Asked if the government would consider the
feelings expressed by the protestors, the spokes
man, who declined to be identified, said, "The go
vernment has always borne in mind the public
feeling on the necessity to have nuclear weapons for
the defense of this country."
Nicaragua announces measures
Managua, Nicaragua — Nicaragua plans to declare
a 25-mile security zone off both its coasts and move
thousands of people away from vulnerable fuel
storage tanks in the nation's largest port in response
to recent attacks by U.S.-backed counterrevolution
ary guerrillas, government officials said yesterday.
The steps reflect concern over the rebels' success
at staging raids on coastal facilities from the sea. The
security zone could lead to tensions between
Nicaragua and the United States, which reportedly
still has warships in waters off the Honduran coast,
north of Nicaragua.
Under the naval and air security proposed by the
junta, foreign warplanes or warships would have to
ask permission 15 days in advance before coming
within 25 miles of Nicaragua's coastline. Civilian
craft would have to seek permission a week in ad
vance.
While the United States technically only respects a
three-mile coastal limit, it has in practice kept ships
more than 12 miles from Nicaragua's coasts, a U.S.
embassy spokesman said.
The United States or other countries with ships in
the area might object to the 25-mile zone. A flotilla
of U.S. warships was dispatched to waters near
Nicaragua's Caribbean and Pacific coasts last sum
mer in a show of force coinciding with U.S. military
maneuvers in neighboring Honduras.
The Nicaraguan plan, outlined in the pro
government newspaper Nuevo Diario, does not ex
plicitly threaten to attack ships or warplanes that in
fringe the 25-mile limit. Instead, it provides for fines
of up to $75,000 if the vessel or plane resists aut
horities seeking to expel it.

To enforce the zone, Nicaragua would have to rely
on its small navy, made up mostly of small patrol
boats.
The Council of State or national legislature is
scheduled to begin considering the plan Wednes
day. It is dominated by the Sandanistas and approval
is considered routine.
The Sandanista government also began over the
weekend to promote a peace proposal it had pre
sented in Washington Thursday aimed at negotiating
a halt in guerrilla attacks.
Daniel Ortega, coordinator of the ruling revolu
tionary junta, sounded conciliatory when asked to
comment on a U.S. statement calling the Nicaraguan
proposals "deficient."
"We hope that they really will study them and
plan political solutions," Ortega said Saturday.
The pro-government media had given relatively
little attention to the peace proposals Thursday and
Friday, but the official newspaper of the ruling San
danista front today ran a long editorial stressing
Nicaragua's willingness to negotiate.
Askew, Mondale lead straw poll
Hollywood, Fla. — Former Florida Gov. Reubin As
kew won an expected victory at the Florida Demo
cratic Party convention's presidential straw poll yes
terday, but former Vice President Walter Mondale
stole much of the thunder with an unexpectedly
strong second place finish.
Askew got 45.9 percent of the votes cast by 2325
delegates, a lower percentage than many had ex
pected him to receive, considering his favorite son
status and convention rules that allowed pro-Askew
party officials to appoint more than 55 percent of the
delegates representing Florida's 67 counties.
Thus, Mondale's 35 percent was seen as a signifi
cant indication of Mondale's strength in the state,
which next spring will elect the largest Southern
delegation to the Democratic National Convention.
Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, who is Mondale's
closest rival in national presidential preference
polls, received 17 percent of the vote in the non
binding balloting.
California Sen. Alan Cranston, who neither made
much of an effort here nor addressed the three-day
convention, ran fourth with 1 percent of the vote.
Former South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, who
did speak here, drew less than one percent. South
Carolina Sen. Earnest Hollings and Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart did not appear and did not compete for
votes.
Both Askew and Mondale's campaign organiza
tions claimed to be pleased with the result of the
poll.
"I'm delighted," Askew said. He called the victory
"the first of many all the way to the White House."
Askew called the margin over Mondale com
fortable and said "a win is a win is a win."
Askew said that many of the delegates did not vote
for him because they did not live in the state when
he served as governor from 1970 to 1978 and
therefore were unfamiliar with his record.
Mondale's strong showing was aided by heavy
votes from the state's most populous counties,
where his recent endorsement by the AFL-CIO and
the National Education Association activated strong
efforts on his behalf.
Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.), a Mondale supporter,
told reporters he was "extremely pleased" with
Mondale's second-place finish, adding that while
Askew won "in raw numbers," Mondale won
delegates' "hearts and minds."
DeLorean videotapes broadcast
Los Angeles — An FBI videotape showing
automaker John DeLorean examining contents of a
suitcase purportedly containing cocaine was broad
cast nationally last night by CBS News, which had
won a court battle about the tape earlier in the day.
The tape is thought to be the government
evidence against DeLorean, who is facing a trial on

drug trafficking charges. An attorney for DeLorean
had warned showing the tape would "unleash a
circus unprecedented in court history."
The tape showed DeLorean lounging on a couch
in a hotel guest room with a glass in hand and talking
to a man sitting across from him, who is barely
visible.
Another man, identified by CBS as an undercover
agent, entered carrying a suitcase, which he placed
on a coffee table and opened.
"This is the other batch that's going out of here,"
the man is heard to say, and he added, "It'll
generate about four and a half, not less than four
and a half mill."
DeLorean responded, "(Unintelligable) good as
gold. Gold weighs more than this, for God's sake."
Then the suitcase is put out of sight,a champagne
cork is popped and DeLorean raised his glass in a
toast.
"Here's to . . . lots of success," said the man iden
tified as an agent.
Then another man entered, identified himself as
an FBi agent and arrested DeLorean, who put his
arms behind his back to be handcuffed.
"Hi john. We're the FBI," the agent said. "We're
here to arrest you on narcotics law violation. Would
you stand up please?"
DeLorean responded, "I don't understand," but
stood. He was handcuffed and sat back down again,
where he was read his rights.
Earlier yesterday, at a hastily called hearing that
drew attorneys to court in blue jeans and sweat
shirts, three justices of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals indicated that they had no authority to
impose prior restraint on the press to publish or
broadcast the material.
DeLorean attorney Howard Weitzman and co
counsel Donald Re told the appeals court judges
that broadcasts of the surveillance tapes would
make it virtually impossible to find an impartial jury
anywhere in the country to judge DeLorean on
cocaine conspiracy charges. They indicated the
broadcast might lead to a motion to dismiss all
charges and abort DeLorean's scheduled Nov. 1 tri
al.
Augusta gate crasher was alcoholic
Augusta, Georgia — The bearded outdoorsman
who crashed the gate of the Augusta National Golf
Club, took five hostages and demanded to speak to
President Reagan had been hospitalized in the past
suffering from alcoholism, a doctor said yesterday.
Charles Harris also was despondent over the loss
of his job and recent death of his father, friends said.
Harris, 45, remained under observation yesterday
at Augusta's University Hospital as federal and local
officials prepared charges against him.
Harris rammed a gate at the prestigious club with a
pickup truck Saturday and took two White House
aides and three others hostage, officials said. He
demanded to speak with Reagan, who was vacation
ing at the club and was on the 16th fairway at the
time.
Reagan called Harris five or six times but Harris
hung up on the president, apparently because he
wanted to speak to him in person, said Richmond
County Sheriff J.B. Dykes.
Dykes said he persuaded Harris to release four of
the hostages, but he declined to say how. The last
hostage escaped after promising to bring Harris
some whiskey, he said.
Harris faces federal charges of threatening the
president and could face a variety of state charges
including kidnapping, aggravated assault, criminal
trespassing and criminal damage to property, said
U.S. attorney Hinton Pierce.
Today's weather
Sunny and warmer today with highs in the 70s to
low 80s inland and the mid-60s to low-70s near the
coast. Light winds. Fair and mild tonight and tomor
row with highs in the mid-70s to mid-80s indland and
upper 60s to mid-70s near the coast.

Grenada fears U.S. invasion
Port of Spain, Trinidad — Grenada's ruling military
council placed its armed forces on alert and called
up militia reserves yesterday in the face of what it
said was an approaching threat of U.S. invasion.
The actions, announced over the official Radio
Free Grenada, came as eastern Caribbean leaders
met for the second day here to decide on sanctions
against General Hudson Hustin and his If>-member
council, which seized control of the tiny island last
Wednesday in a bloody coup that killed Prime Mini
ster Maurice Bishop and 16 others by official
Grenadian count.
Sources involved in the discussions here said the
Caribbean prime minsters were mainly seeking

agreement on economic and political santions. The
likelihood of U.S. military action on the 133-square
mile island also was part of their talks, they added,
because Washington would be reluctant to act with
out at least tacit approval from the region's demo
cratic governments.
Expressions of concern in Washington about the
safety of nearly 1000 Americans on Grenada have
been interpreted by officials here as a possible effort
to set the stage for their evacuation by a pair of U.S.
Navy task forces reported sailing toward the eastern
Caribbean.
One problem facing the leaders gathered here is
how to portray any U.S. intervention to avoid the
issue of "imperialism'' already raised by Grenada
and the Soviet Union, the officials said.
Lt. Col. Liam James, one of the council's two vice
chairmen under Hustin, declared that the Reagan
adminstration's expressions of concern "are blatant
lies and a fabricated excuse tor staging an invasion
of our country." In a radio broadcast he called on
the people to get readv to tight and "protect the in
tegrity and sovereignity of our homeland to the last
man."
Grenada has received Soviet-designed weapons
since the March 13, 1979 revolution which led to an
alliance with Cuba and the Soviet Union. It has or
ganized armed forces estimated by U.S. officials to
number more than 2000. Some troops are armed
with Ak-47 assault rifles and can call on at least 60
armored personnel carriers equipped with machine
guns.
But for the most part, Grenada's armed forces are
made of poorly-trained and poorly-armed
militiamen. During a war of words with the Reagan
administration last spring, for instance, Hustin
called on the population to bring in hunting rifles
and even shovels to help the militia prepare
defenses against what he declared then was going to
be a CIA-led invasion by counterrevolutionary
Grenadians from a neighboring island.
In his broadcast lames urged all militiamen who
have not yet reported to their stations to call in their
locations. It also ordered Grenadians in possession
of government vehicles to drive them to several
points on the island pinpointed by the announcer.
As a measure of Grenadian concern over possible
U.S. intervention, the information ministry in St.
George's, the capitol, telephoned the text of James'
statement to the Barbados headquarters of the
Caribbean news agency, Cana.
In addition, Radio Free Grenada Saturday night
broadcast a statement by Maj. Chris Stroude, a
council member, pledging to form a national recon
ciliation cabinet, "within the next 10 to 14 days."
"In appointing a new cabinet, the Revolutionary
Military Council will operate on the basis of ensur
ing that all social classes and interests in our country
are represented," Stroude said.
He said the council places greatest emphasis on
economic development for the island's 110,000 in
habitants and, ironically, expressed belief that in
creasing tourism to Grenada's white-sand beaches
"is a critical factor in ensuring the most rapid devel
opment of our country."
The late Prime Minister Bishop had insisted that
Grenada's construction of a 9000 foot airport would
boost tourism sharply, removing the need for
European travelers to stop on neighboring islands
and transfer to small planes able to land at the is
land's outdated Pearl Airport.
The Reagan administration charged, however, that
the new facility, built with Cuban aid and engineers,
presented the Soviet Union with a potential air base
amid vital oil-shipping lanes.
Western Europe: no U.S. missiles
Nearly a halt-million demonstrators poured
through the streets of Brussels, Madrid and Paris
yesterday in the second day of Western European
protest against deployment of new U.S. nuclear
missiles.
Anti-missile campaigners hailed the weekend tur
nout of more than one and a half million people as a
clear sign of widespread opposition to the impend
ing deployment of 572 Pershing II and cruise
missiles.
There were no reports of arrests or violence yes
terday. On Saturday, when more than a million
Western Europeans sat in, formed human chains
and marched, West German police arrested 450
protestors.
In Brussels, marchers converged in three columns
on the city center in the biggest anti-missile protest
ever in Belgium. There was no official count, but
police said the crowd was much larger than the tur

nout of 200,000 in an October 1981 demonstration.
Organizers estimated the number yesterday at
300,000.
The rally took place about five miles from the
headquarters of the NATO, where it was decided
four years ago to deploy the medium-range U.S.
missiles to counter 243 Soviet SS-20 missiles targeted
on Europe. The deployment begins in less than 10
weeks unless a U.S.-Soviet arms control accord is
first reached.
Under the NATO plan, West Germany will take
108 Pershing II missiles and 96 cruise missiles. Bel
gium will deploy 48 cruise missiles, the Netherlands
60, Britain 160 and Italy 112.
In Madrid, police said about 150,000 people took
part in a march behind a banner that read, "For A
Europe Without Missiles." An additional 6000 dem
onstrated in Barcelona and 10,000 in Oviedo.
Gerardo Iglesias, Secretary General of the Spanish
Communist Party, said the demonstration showed
that the "people are against NATO," which Spain
joined last year.
In Paris, the demonstration was against both the
Soviet and NATO missiles, in contrast to a Saturday
protest march aimed solely at the NATO deploy
ment.
About 10,000 protesters linked arms from the U.S.
Embassy just off the Place de la Concorde, across
two Seine bridges to the Soviet Embassy on
Boulevard Lannes — a distance of three miles. They
chanted "No! No! Nyet! Nyet! Neither Pershing
Nor SS-20."
In Saturday's protests, some 200,000 people
marched to a rally in London's Hyde Park, a similar
number paraded in Rome and tens of thousands
demonstrated in Paris, Vienna and Stockholm. In
West Germany, more than 850,000 turned out
nationwide Saturday.
Western governments continued to insist that the
marches won't stop the scheduled deployment.
"There is no change," said a spokesman at the of
fice of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
London.
Asked if the government would consider the
feelings expressed by the protestors, the spokes
man, who declined to be identified, said, "The go
vernment has always borne in mind the public
feeling on the necessity to have nuclear weapons for
the defense of this country."
Nicaragua announces measures
Managua, Nicaragua — Nicaragua plans to declare
a 25-mile security zone off both its coasts and move
thousands of people away from vulnerable fuel
storage tanks in the nation's largest port in response
to recent attacks by U.S.-backed counterrevolution
ary guerrillas, government officials said yesterday.
The steps reflect concern over the rebels' success
at staging raids on coastal facilities from the sea. The
security zone could lead to tensions between
Nicaragua and the United States, which reportedly
still has warships in waters off the Honduran coast,
north of Nicaragua.
Under the naval and air security proposed by the
junta, foreign warplanes or warships would have to
ask permission 15 days in advance before coming
within 25 miles of Nicaragua's coastline. Civilian
craft would have to seek permission a week in ad
vance.
While the United States technically only respects a
three-mile coastal limit, it has in practice kept ships
more than 12 miles from Nicaragua's coasts, a U.S.
embassy spokesman said.
The United States or other countries with ships in
the area might object to the 25-mile zone. A flotilla
of U.S. warships was dispatched to waters near
Nicaragua's Caribbean and Pacific coasts last sum
mer in a show of force coinciding with U.S. military
maneuvers in neighboring Honduras.
The Nicaraguan plan, outlined in the pro
government newspaper Nuevo Diario, does not ex
plicitly threaten to attack ships or warplanes that in
fringe the 25-mile limit. Instead, it provides for fines
of up to $75,000 if the vessel or plane resists aut
horities seeking to expel it.

To enforce the zone, Nicaragua would have to rely
on its small navy, made up mostly of small patrol
boats.
The Council of State or national legislature is
scheduled to begin considering the plan Wednes
day. It is dominated by the Sandanistas and approval
is considered routine.
The Sandanista government also began over the
weekend to promote a peace proposal it had pre
sented in Washington Thursday aimed at negotiating
a halt in guerrilla attacks.
Daniel Ortega, coordinator of the ruling revolu
tionary junta, sounded conciliatory when asked to
comment on a U.S. statement calling the Nicaraguan
proposals "deficient."
"We hope that they really will study them and
plan political solutions," Ortega said Saturday.
The pro-government media had given relatively
little attention to the peace proposals Thursday and
Friday, but the official newspaper of the ruling San
danista front today ran a long editorial stressing
Nicaragua's willingness to negotiate.
Askew, Mondale lead straw poll
Hollywood, Fla. — Former Florida Gov. Reubin As
kew won an expected victory at the Florida Demo
cratic Party convention's presidential straw poll yes
terday, but former Vice President Walter Mondale
stole much of the thunder with an unexpectedly
strong second place finish.
Askew got 45.9 percent of the votes cast by 2325
delegates, a lower percentage than many had ex
pected him to receive, considering his favorite son
status and convention rules that allowed pro-Askew
party officials to appoint more than 55 percent of the
delegates representing Florida's 67 counties.
Thus, Mondale's 35 percent was seen as a signifi
cant indication of Mondale's strength in the state,
which next spring will elect the largest Southern
delegation to the Democratic National Convention.
Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, who is Mondale's
closest rival in national presidential preference
polls, received 17 percent of the vote in the non
binding balloting.
California Sen. Alan Cranston, who neither made
much of an effort here nor addressed the three-day
convention, ran fourth with 1 percent of the vote.
Former South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, who
did speak here, drew less than one percent. South
Carolina Sen. Earnest Hollings and Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart did not appear and did not compete for
votes.
Both Askew and Mondale's campaign organiza
tions claimed to be pleased with the result of the
poll.
"I'm delighted," Askew said. He called the victory
"the first of many all the way to the White House."
Askew called the margin over Mondale com
fortable and said "a win is a win is a win."
Askew said that many of the delegates did not vote
for him because they did not live in the state when
he served as governor from 1970 to 1978 and
therefore were unfamiliar with his record.
Mondale's strong showing was aided by heavy
votes from the state's most populous counties,
where his recent endorsement by the AFL-CIO and
the National Education Association activated strong
efforts on his behalf.
Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.), a Mondale supporter,
told reporters he was "extremely pleased" with
Mondale's second-place finish, adding that while
Askew won "in raw numbers," Mondale won
delegates' "hearts and minds."
DeLorean videotapes broadcast
Los Angeles — An FBI videotape showing
automaker John DeLorean examining contents of a
suitcase purportedly containing cocaine was broad
cast nationally last night by CBS News, which had
won a court battle about the tape earlier in the day.
The tape is thought to be the government
evidence against DeLorean, who is facing a trial on

drug trafficking charges. An attorney for DeLorean
had warned showing the tape would "unleash a
circus unprecedented in court history."
The tape showed DeLorean lounging on a couch
in a hotel guest room with a glass in hand and talking
to a man sitting across from him, who is barely
visible.
Another man, identified by CBS as an undercover
agent, entered carrying a suitcase, which he placed
on a coffee table and opened.
"This is the other batch that's going out of here,"
the man is heard to say, and he added, "It'll
generate about four and a half, not less than four
and a half mill."
DeLorean responded, "(Unintelligable) good as
gold. Gold weighs more than this, for God's sake."
Then the suitcase is put out of sight,a champagne
cork is popped and DeLorean raised his glass in a
toast.
"Here's to . . . lots of success," said the man iden
tified as an agent.
Then another man entered, identified himself as
an FBi agent and arrested DeLorean, who put his
arms behind his back to be handcuffed.
"Hi john. We're the FBI," the agent said. "We're
here to arrest you on narcotics law violation. Would
you stand up please?"
DeLorean responded, "I don't understand," but
stood. He was handcuffed and sat back down again,
where he was read his rights.
Earlier yesterday, at a hastily called hearing that
drew attorneys to court in blue jeans and sweat
shirts, three justices of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals indicated that they had no authority to
impose prior restraint on the press to publish or
broadcast the material.
DeLorean attorney Howard Weitzman and co
counsel Donald Re told the appeals court judges
that broadcasts of the surveillance tapes would
make it virtually impossible to find an impartial jury
anywhere in the country to judge DeLorean on
cocaine conspiracy charges. They indicated the
broadcast might lead to a motion to dismiss all
charges and abort DeLorean's scheduled Nov. 1 tri
al.
Augusta gate crasher was alcoholic
Augusta, Georgia — The bearded outdoorsman
who crashed the gate of the Augusta National Golf
Club, took five hostages and demanded to speak to
President Reagan had been hospitalized in the past
suffering from alcoholism, a doctor said yesterday.
Charles Harris also was despondent over the loss
of his job and recent death of his father, friends said.
Harris, 45, remained under observation yesterday
at Augusta's University Hospital as federal and local
officials prepared charges against him.
Harris rammed a gate at the prestigious club with a
pickup truck Saturday and took two White House
aides and three others hostage, officials said. He
demanded to speak with Reagan, who was vacation
ing at the club and was on the 16th fairway at the
time.
Reagan called Harris five or six times but Harris
hung up on the president, apparently because he
wanted to speak to him in person, said Richmond
County Sheriff J.B. Dykes.
Dykes said he persuaded Harris to release four of
the hostages, but he declined to say how. The last
hostage escaped after promising to bring Harris
some whiskey, he said.
Harris faces federal charges of threatening the
president and could face a variety of state charges
including kidnapping, aggravated assault, criminal
trespassing and criminal damage to property, said
U.S. attorney Hinton Pierce.

hostage escaped after promising to bring Harris
some whiskey, he said.
Harris faces federal charges of threatening the

including kidnapping, aggravated assault, criminal

U.S. attorney Hinton Pierce.

Grenada fears U.S. invasion
Port of Spain, Trinidad — Grenada's ruling military
council placed its armed forces on alert and called
up militia reserves yesterday in the face of what it
said was an approaching threat of U.S. invasion.
The actions, announced over the official Radio
Free Grenada, came as eastern Caribbean leaders
met for the second day here to decide on sanctions
against General Hudson Hustin and his If>-member
council, which seized control of the tiny island last
Wednesday in a bloody coup that killed Prime Mini
ster Maurice Bishop and 16 others by official
Grenadian count.
Sources involved in the discussions here said the
Caribbean prime minsters were mainly seeking

agreement on economic and political santions. The
likelihood of U.S. military action on the 133-square
mile island also was part of their talks, they added,
because Washington would be reluctant to act with
out at least tacit approval from the region's demo
cratic governments.
Expressions of concern in Washington about the
safety of nearly 1000 Americans on Grenada have
been interpreted by officials here as a possible effort
to set the stage for their evacuation by a pair of U.S.
Navy task forces reported sailing toward the eastern
Caribbean.
One problem facing the leaders gathered here is
how to portray any U.S. intervention to avoid the
issue of "imperialism'' already raised by Grenada
and the Soviet Union, the officials said.
Lt. Col. Liam James, one of the council's two vice
chairmen under Hustin, declared that the Reagan
adminstration's expressions of concern "are blatant
lies and a fabricated excuse tor staging an invasion
of our country." In a radio broadcast he called on
the people to get readv to tight and "protect the in
tegrity and sovereignity of our homeland to the last
man."
Grenada has received Soviet-designed weapons
since the March 13, 1979 revolution which led to an
alliance with Cuba and the Soviet Union. It has or
ganized armed forces estimated by U.S. officials to
number more than 2000. Some troops are armed
with Ak-47 assault rifles and can call on at least 60
armored personnel carriers equipped with machine
guns.
But for the most part, Grenada's armed forces are
made of poorly-trained and poorly-armed
militiamen. During a war of words with the Reagan
administration last spring, for instance, Hustin
called on the population to bring in hunting rifles
and even shovels to help the militia prepare
defenses against what he declared then was going to
be a CIA-led invasion by counterrevolutionary
Grenadians from a neighboring island.
In his broadcast lames urged all militiamen who
have not yet reported to their stations to call in their
locations. It also ordered Grenadians in possession
of government vehicles to drive them to several
points on the island pinpointed by the announcer.
As a measure of Grenadian concern over possible
U.S. intervention, the information ministry in St.
George's, the capitol, telephoned the text of James'
statement to the Barbados headquarters of the
Caribbean news agency, Cana.
In addition, Radio Free Grenada Saturday night
broadcast a statement by Maj. Chris Stroude, a
council member, pledging to form a national recon
ciliation cabinet, "within the next 10 to 14 days."
"In appointing a new cabinet, the Revolutionary
Military Council will operate on the basis of ensur
ing that all social classes and interests in our country
are represented," Stroude said.
He said the council places greatest emphasis on
economic development for the island's 110,000 in
habitants and, ironically, expressed belief that in
creasing tourism to Grenada's white-sand beaches
"is a critical factor in ensuring the most rapid devel
opment of our country."
The late Prime Minister Bishop had insisted that
Grenada's construction of a 9000 foot airport would
boost tourism sharply, removing the need for
European travelers to stop on neighboring islands
and transfer to small planes able to land at the is
land's outdated Pearl Airport.
The Reagan administration charged, however, that
the new facility, built with Cuban aid and engineers,
presented the Soviet Union with a potential air base
amid vital oil-shipping lanes.
Western Europe: no U.S. missiles
Nearly a halt-million demonstrators poured
through the streets of Brussels, Madrid and Paris
yesterday in the second day of Western European
protest against deployment of new U.S. nuclear
missiles.
Anti-missile campaigners hailed the weekend tur
nout of more than one and a half million people as a
clear sign of widespread opposition to the impend
ing deployment of 572 Pershing II and cruise
missiles.
There were no reports of arrests or violence yes
terday. On Saturday, when more than a million
Western Europeans sat in, formed human chains
and marched, West German police arrested 450
protestors.
In Brussels, marchers converged in three columns
on the city center in the biggest anti-missile protest
ever in Belgium. There was no official count, but
police said the crowd was much larger than the tur

nout of 200,000 in an October 1981 demonstration.
Organizers estimated the number yesterday at
300,000.
The rally took place about five miles from the
headquarters of the NATO, where it was decided
four years ago to deploy the medium-range U.S.
missiles to counter 243 Soviet SS-20 missiles targeted
on Europe. The deployment begins in less than 10
weeks unless a U.S.-Soviet arms control accord is
first reached.
Under the NATO plan, West Germany will take
108 Pershing II missiles and 96 cruise missiles. Bel
gium will deploy 48 cruise missiles, the Netherlands
60, Britain 160 and Italy 112.
In Madrid, police said about 150,000 people took
part in a march behind a banner that read, "For A
Europe Without Missiles." An additional 6000 dem
onstrated in Barcelona and 10,000 in Oviedo.
Gerardo Iglesias, Secretary General of the Spanish
Communist Party, said the demonstration showed
that the "people are against NATO," which Spain
joined last year.
In Paris, the demonstration was against both the
Soviet and NATO missiles, in contrast to a Saturday
protest march aimed solely at the NATO deploy
ment.
About 10,000 protesters linked arms from the U.S.
Embassy just off the Place de la Concorde, across
two Seine bridges to the Soviet Embassy on
Boulevard Lannes — a distance of three miles. They
chanted "No! No! Nyet! Nyet! Neither Pershing
Nor SS-20."
In Saturday's protests, some 200,000 people
marched to a rally in London's Hyde Park, a similar
number paraded in Rome and tens of thousands
demonstrated in Paris, Vienna and Stockholm. In
West Germany, more than 850,000 turned out
nationwide Saturday.
Western governments continued to insist that the
marches won't stop the scheduled deployment.
"There is no change," said a spokesman at the of
fice of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
London.
Asked if the government would consider the
feelings expressed by the protestors, the spokes
man, who declined to be identified, said, "The go
vernment has always borne in mind the public
feeling on the necessity to have nuclear weapons for
the defense of this country."
Nicaragua announces measures
Managua, Nicaragua — Nicaragua plans to declare
a 25-mile security zone off both its coasts and move
thousands of people away from vulnerable fuel
storage tanks in the nation's largest port in response
to recent attacks by U.S.-backed counterrevolution
ary guerrillas, government officials said yesterday.
The steps reflect concern over the rebels' success
at staging raids on coastal facilities from the sea. The
security zone could lead to tensions between
Nicaragua and the United States, which reportedly
still has warships in waters off the Honduran coast,
north of Nicaragua.
Under the naval and air security proposed by the
junta, foreign warplanes or warships would have to
ask permission 15 days in advance before coming
within 25 miles of Nicaragua's coastline. Civilian
craft would have to seek permission a week in ad
vance.
While the United States technically only respects a
three-mile coastal limit, it has in practice kept ships
more than 12 miles from Nicaragua's coasts, a U.S.
embassy spokesman said.
The United States or other countries with ships in
the area might object to the 25-mile zone. A flotilla
of U.S. warships was dispatched to waters near
Nicaragua's Caribbean and Pacific coasts last sum
mer in a show of force coinciding with U.S. military
maneuvers in neighboring Honduras.
The Nicaraguan plan, outlined in the pro
government newspaper Nuevo Diario, does not ex
plicitly threaten to attack ships or warplanes that in
fringe the 25-mile limit. Instead, it provides for fines
of up to $75,000 if the vessel or plane resists aut
horities seeking to expel it.

To enforce the zone, Nicaragua would have to rely
on its small navy, made up mostly of small patrol
boats.
The Council of State or national legislature is
scheduled to begin considering the plan Wednes
day. It is dominated by the Sandanistas and approval
is considered routine.
The Sandanista government also began over the
weekend to promote a peace proposal it had pre
sented in Washington Thursday aimed at negotiating
a halt in guerrilla attacks.
Daniel Ortega, coordinator of the ruling revolu
tionary junta, sounded conciliatory when asked to
comment on a U.S. statement calling the Nicaraguan
proposals "deficient."
"We hope that they really will study them and
plan political solutions," Ortega said Saturday.
The pro-government media had given relatively
little attention to the peace proposals Thursday and
Friday, but the official newspaper of the ruling San
danista front today ran a long editorial stressing
Nicaragua's willingness to negotiate.
Askew, Mondale lead straw poll
Hollywood, Fla. — Former Florida Gov. Reubin As
kew won an expected victory at the Florida Demo
cratic Party convention's presidential straw poll yes
terday, but former Vice President Walter Mondale
stole much of the thunder with an unexpectedly
strong second place finish.
Askew got 45.9 percent of the votes cast by 2325
delegates, a lower percentage than many had ex
pected him to receive, considering his favorite son
status and convention rules that allowed pro-Askew
party officials to appoint more than 55 percent of the
delegates representing Florida's 67 counties.
Thus, Mondale's 35 percent was seen as a signifi
cant indication of Mondale's strength in the state,
which next spring will elect the largest Southern
delegation to the Democratic National Convention.
Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, who is Mondale's
closest rival in national presidential preference
polls, received 17 percent of the vote in the non
binding balloting.
California Sen. Alan Cranston, who neither made
much of an effort here nor addressed the three-day
convention, ran fourth with 1 percent of the vote.
Former South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, who
did speak here, drew less than one percent. South
Carolina Sen. Earnest Hollings and Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart did not appear and did not compete for
votes.
Both Askew and Mondale's campaign organiza
tions claimed to be pleased with the result of the
poll.
"I'm delighted," Askew said. He called the victory
"the first of many all the way to the White House."
Askew called the margin over Mondale com
fortable and said "a win is a win is a win."
Askew said that many of the delegates did not vote
for him because they did not live in the state when
he served as governor from 1970 to 1978 and
therefore were unfamiliar with his record.
Mondale's strong showing was aided by heavy
votes from the state's most populous counties,
where his recent endorsement by the AFL-CIO and
the National Education Association activated strong
efforts on his behalf.
Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.), a Mondale supporter,
told reporters he was "extremely pleased" with
Mondale's second-place finish, adding that while
Askew won "in raw numbers," Mondale won
delegates' "hearts and minds."
DeLorean videotapes broadcast
Los Angeles — An FBI videotape showing
automaker John DeLorean examining contents of a
suitcase purportedly containing cocaine was broad
cast nationally last night by CBS News, which had
won a court battle about the tape earlier in the day.
The tape is thought to be the government
evidence against DeLorean, who is facing a trial on

drug trafficking charges. An attorney for DeLorean
had warned showing the tape would "unleash a
circus unprecedented in court history."
The tape showed DeLorean lounging on a couch
in a hotel guest room with a glass in hand and talking
to a man sitting across from him, who is barely
visible.
Another man, identified by CBS as an undercover
agent, entered carrying a suitcase, which he placed
on a coffee table and opened.
"This is the other batch that's going out of here,"
the man is heard to say, and he added, "It'll
generate about four and a half, not less than four
and a half mill."
DeLorean responded, "(Unintelligable) good as
gold. Gold weighs more than this, for God's sake."
Then the suitcase is put out of sight,a champagne
cork is popped and DeLorean raised his glass in a
toast.
"Here's to . . . lots of success," said the man iden
tified as an agent.
Then another man entered, identified himself as
an FBi agent and arrested DeLorean, who put his
arms behind his back to be handcuffed.
"Hi john. We're the FBI," the agent said. "We're
here to arrest you on narcotics law violation. Would
you stand up please?"
DeLorean responded, "I don't understand," but
stood. He was handcuffed and sat back down again,
where he was read his rights.
Earlier yesterday, at a hastily called hearing that
drew attorneys to court in blue jeans and sweat
shirts, three justices of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals indicated that they had no authority to
impose prior restraint on the press to publish or
broadcast the material.
DeLorean attorney Howard Weitzman and co
counsel Donald Re told the appeals court judges
that broadcasts of the surveillance tapes would
make it virtually impossible to find an impartial jury
anywhere in the country to judge DeLorean on
cocaine conspiracy charges. They indicated the
broadcast might lead to a motion to dismiss all
charges and abort DeLorean's scheduled Nov. 1 tri
al.
Augusta gate crasher was alcoholic
Augusta, Georgia — The bearded outdoorsman
who crashed the gate of the Augusta National Golf
Club, took five hostages and demanded to speak to
President Reagan had been hospitalized in the past
suffering from alcoholism, a doctor said yesterday.
Charles Harris also was despondent over the loss
of his job and recent death of his father, friends said.
Harris, 45, remained under observation yesterday
at Augusta's University Hospital as federal and local
officials prepared charges against him.
Harris rammed a gate at the prestigious club with a
pickup truck Saturday and took two White House
aides and three others hostage, officials said. He
demanded to speak with Reagan, who was vacation
ing at the club and was on the 16th fairway at the
time.
Reagan called Harris five or six times but Harris
hung up on the president, apparently because he
wanted to speak to him in person, said Richmond
County Sheriff J.B. Dykes.
Dykes said he persuaded Harris to release four of
the hostages, but he declined to say how. The last
hostage escaped after promising to bring Harris
some whiskey, he said.
Harris faces federal charges of threatening the
president and could face a variety of state charges
including kidnapping, aggravated assault, criminal
trespassing and criminal damage to property, said
U.S. attorney Hinton Pierce.

ing at the club and was on the 16th fairway at the
time.
Reagan called Harris five or six times but Harris
hung up on the president, apparently because he
wanted to speak to him in person, said Richmond
County Sheriff J.B. Dykes.
Dykes said he persuaded Harris to release four of
the hostages, but he declined to say how. The last
hostage escaped after promising to bring Harris
some whiskey, he said.
Harris faces federal charges of threatening the
president and could face a variety of state charges
including kidnapping, aggravated assault, criminal
trespassing and criminal damage to property, said
U.S. attorney Hinton Pierce.

Grenada fears U.S. invasion
Port of Spain, Trinidad — Grenada's ruling military
council placed its armed forces on alert and called
up militia reserves yesterday in the face of what it
said was an approaching threat of U.S. invasion.
The actions, announced over the official Radio
Free Grenada, came as eastern Caribbean leaders
met for the second day here to decide on sanctions
against General Hudson Hustin and his If>-member
council, which seized control of the tiny island last
Wednesday in a bloody coup that killed Prime Mini
ster Maurice Bishop and 16 others by official
Grenadian count.
Sources involved in the discussions here said the
Caribbean prime minsters were mainly seeking

agreement on economic and political santions. The
likelihood of U.S. military action on the 133-square
mile island also was part of their talks, they added,
because Washington would be reluctant to act with
out at least tacit approval from the region's demo
cratic governments.
Expressions of concern in Washington about the
safety of nearly 1000 Americans on Grenada have
been interpreted by officials here as a possible effort
to set the stage for their evacuation by a pair of U.S.
Navy task forces reported sailing toward the eastern
Caribbean.
One problem facing the leaders gathered here is
how to portray any U.S. intervention to avoid the
issue of "imperialism'' already raised by Grenada
and the Soviet Union, the officials said.
Lt. Col. Liam James, one of the council's two vice
chairmen under Hustin, declared that the Reagan
adminstration's expressions of concern "are blatant
lies and a fabricated excuse tor staging an invasion
of our country." In a radio broadcast he called on
the people to get readv to tight and "protect the in
tegrity and sovereignity of our homeland to the last
man."
Grenada has received Soviet-designed weapons
since the March 13, 1979 revolution which led to an
alliance with Cuba and the Soviet Union. It has or
ganized armed forces estimated by U.S. officials to
number more than 2000. Some troops are armed
with Ak-47 assault rifles and can call on at least 60
armored personnel carriers equipped with machine
guns.
But for the most part, Grenada's armed forces are
made of poorly-trained and poorly-armed
militiamen. During a war of words with the Reagan
administration last spring, for instance, Hustin
called on the population to bring in hunting rifles
and even shovels to help the militia prepare
defenses against what he declared then was going to
be a CIA-led invasion by counterrevolutionary
Grenadians from a neighboring island.
In his broadcast lames urged all militiamen who
have not yet reported to their stations to call in their
locations. It also ordered Grenadians in possession
of government vehicles to drive them to several
points on the island pinpointed by the announcer.
As a measure of Grenadian concern over possible
U.S. intervention, the information ministry in St.
George's, the capitol, telephoned the text of James'
statement to the Barbados headquarters of the
Caribbean news agency, Cana.
In addition, Radio Free Grenada Saturday night
broadcast a statement by Maj. Chris Stroude, a
council member, pledging to form a national recon
ciliation cabinet, "within the next 10 to 14 days."
"In appointing a new cabinet, the Revolutionary
Military Council will operate on the basis of ensur
ing that all social classes and interests in our country
are represented," Stroude said.
He said the council places greatest emphasis on
economic development for the island's 110,000 in
habitants and, ironically, expressed belief that in
creasing tourism to Grenada's white-sand beaches
"is a critical factor in ensuring the most rapid devel
opment of our country."
The late Prime Minister Bishop had insisted that
Grenada's construction of a 9000 foot airport would
boost tourism sharply, removing the need for
European travelers to stop on neighboring islands
and transfer to small planes able to land at the is
land's outdated Pearl Airport.
The Reagan administration charged, however, that
the new facility, built with Cuban aid and engineers,
presented the Soviet Union with a potential air base
amid vital oil-shipping lanes.
Western Europe: no U.S. missiles
Nearly a halt-million demonstrators poured
through the streets of Brussels, Madrid and Paris
yesterday in the second day of Western European
protest against deployment of new U.S. nuclear
missiles.
Anti-missile campaigners hailed the weekend tur
nout of more than one and a half million people as a
clear sign of widespread opposition to the impend
ing deployment of 572 Pershing II and cruise
missiles.
There were no reports of arrests or violence yes
terday. On Saturday, when more than a million
Western Europeans sat in, formed human chains
and marched, West German police arrested 450
protestors.
In Brussels, marchers converged in three columns
on the city center in the biggest anti-missile protest
ever in Belgium. There was no official count, but
police said the crowd was much larger than the tur

nout of 200,000 in an October 1981 demonstration.
Organizers estimated the number yesterday at
300,000.
The rally took place about five miles from the
headquarters of the NATO, where it was decided
four years ago to deploy the medium-range U.S.
missiles to counter 243 Soviet SS-20 missiles targeted
on Europe. The deployment begins in less than 10
weeks unless a U.S.-Soviet arms control accord is
first reached.
Under the NATO plan, West Germany will take
108 Pershing II missiles and 96 cruise missiles. Bel
gium will deploy 48 cruise missiles, the Netherlands
60, Britain 160 and Italy 112.
In Madrid, police said about 150,000 people took
part in a march behind a banner that read, "For A
Europe Without Missiles." An additional 6000 dem
onstrated in Barcelona and 10,000 in Oviedo.
Gerardo Iglesias, Secretary General of the Spanish
Communist Party, said the demonstration showed
that the "people are against NATO," which Spain
joined last year.
In Paris, the demonstration was against both the
Soviet and NATO missiles, in contrast to a Saturday
protest march aimed solely at the NATO deploy
ment.
About 10,000 protesters linked arms from the U.S.
Embassy just off the Place de la Concorde, across
two Seine bridges to the Soviet Embassy on
Boulevard Lannes — a distance of three miles. They
chanted "No! No! Nyet! Nyet! Neither Pershing
Nor SS-20."
In Saturday's protests, some 200,000 people
marched to a rally in London's Hyde Park, a similar
number paraded in Rome and tens of thousands
demonstrated in Paris, Vienna and Stockholm. In
West Germany, more than 850,000 turned out
nationwide Saturday.
Western governments continued to insist that the
marches won't stop the scheduled deployment.
"There is no change," said a spokesman at the of
fice of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
London.
Asked if the government would consider the
feelings expressed by the protestors, the spokes
man, who declined to be identified, said, "The go
vernment has always borne in mind the public
feeling on the necessity to have nuclear weapons for
the defense of this country."
Nicaragua announces measures
Managua, Nicaragua — Nicaragua plans to declare
a 25-mile security zone off both its coasts and move
thousands of people away from vulnerable fuel
storage tanks in the nation's largest port in response
to recent attacks by U.S.-backed counterrevolution
ary guerrillas, government officials said yesterday.
The steps reflect concern over the rebels' success
at staging raids on coastal facilities from the sea. The
security zone could lead to tensions between
Nicaragua and the United States, which reportedly
still has warships in waters off the Honduran coast,
north of Nicaragua.
Under the naval and air security proposed by the
junta, foreign warplanes or warships would have to
ask permission 15 days in advance before coming
within 25 miles of Nicaragua's coastline. Civilian
craft would have to seek permission a week in ad
vance.
While the United States technically only respects a
three-mile coastal limit, it has in practice kept ships
more than 12 miles from Nicaragua's coasts, a U.S.
embassy spokesman said.
The United States or other countries with ships in
the area might object to the 25-mile zone. A flotilla
of U.S. warships was dispatched to waters near
Nicaragua's Caribbean and Pacific coasts last sum
mer in a show of force coinciding with U.S. military
maneuvers in neighboring Honduras.
The Nicaraguan plan, outlined in the pro
government newspaper Nuevo Diario, does not ex
plicitly threaten to attack ships or warplanes that in
fringe the 25-mile limit. Instead, it provides for fines
of up to $75,000 if the vessel or plane resists aut
horities seeking to expel it.

To enforce the zone, Nicaragua would have to rely
on its small navy, made up mostly of small patrol
boats.
The Council of State or national legislature is
scheduled to begin considering the plan Wednes
day. It is dominated by the Sandanistas and approval
is considered routine.
The Sandanista government also began over the
weekend to promote a peace proposal it had pre
sented in Washington Thursday aimed at negotiating
a halt in guerrilla attacks.
Daniel Ortega, coordinator of the ruling revolu
tionary junta, sounded conciliatory when asked to
comment on a U.S. statement calling the Nicaraguan
proposals "deficient."
"We hope that they really will study them and
plan political solutions," Ortega said Saturday.
The pro-government media had given relatively
little attention to the peace proposals Thursday and
Friday, but the official newspaper of the ruling San
danista front today ran a long editorial stressing
Nicaragua's willingness to negotiate.
Askew, Mondale lead straw poll
Hollywood, Fla. — Former Florida Gov. Reubin As
kew won an expected victory at the Florida Demo
cratic Party convention's presidential straw poll yes
terday, but former Vice President Walter Mondale
stole much of the thunder with an unexpectedly
strong second place finish.
Askew got 45.9 percent of the votes cast by 2325
delegates, a lower percentage than many had ex
pected him to receive, considering his favorite son
status and convention rules that allowed pro-Askew
party officials to appoint more than 55 percent of the
delegates representing Florida's 67 counties.
Thus, Mondale's 35 percent was seen as a signifi
cant indication of Mondale's strength in the state,
which next spring will elect the largest Southern
delegation to the Democratic National Convention.
Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, who is Mondale's
closest rival in national presidential preference
polls, received 17 percent of the vote in the non
binding balloting.
California Sen. Alan Cranston, who neither made
much of an effort here nor addressed the three-day
convention, ran fourth with 1 percent of the vote.
Former South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, who
did speak here, drew less than one percent. South
Carolina Sen. Earnest Hollings and Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart did not appear and did not compete for
votes.
Both Askew and Mondale's campaign organiza
tions claimed to be pleased with the result of the
poll.
"I'm delighted," Askew said. He called the victory
"the first of many all the way to the White House."
Askew called the margin over Mondale com
fortable and said "a win is a win is a win."
Askew said that many of the delegates did not vote
for him because they did not live in the state when
he served as governor from 1970 to 1978 and
therefore were unfamiliar with his record.
Mondale's strong showing was aided by heavy
votes from the state's most populous counties,
where his recent endorsement by the AFL-CIO and
the National Education Association activated strong
efforts on his behalf.
Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.), a Mondale supporter,
told reporters he was "extremely pleased" with
Mondale's second-place finish, adding that while
Askew won "in raw numbers," Mondale won
delegates' "hearts and minds."
DeLorean videotapes broadcast
Los Angeles — An FBI videotape showing
automaker John DeLorean examining contents of a
suitcase purportedly containing cocaine was broad
cast nationally last night by CBS News, which had
won a court battle about the tape earlier in the day.
The tape is thought to be the government
evidence against DeLorean, who is facing a trial on

drug trafficking charges. An attorney for DeLorean
had warned showing the tape would "unleash a
circus unprecedented in court history."
The tape showed DeLorean lounging on a couch
in a hotel guest room with a glass in hand and talking
to a man sitting across from him, who is barely
visible.
Another man, identified by CBS as an undercover
agent, entered carrying a suitcase, which he placed
on a coffee table and opened.
"This is the other batch that's going out of here,"
the man is heard to say, and he added, "It'll
generate about four and a half, not less than four
and a half mill."
DeLorean responded, "(Unintelligable) good as
gold. Gold weighs more than this, for God's sake."
Then the suitcase is put out of sight,a champagne
cork is popped and DeLorean raised his glass in a
toast.
"Here's to . . . lots of success," said the man iden
tified as an agent.
Then another man entered, identified himself as
an FBi agent and arrested DeLorean, who put his
arms behind his back to be handcuffed.
"Hi john. We're the FBI," the agent said. "We're
here to arrest you on narcotics law violation. Would
you stand up please?"
DeLorean responded, "I don't understand," but
stood. He was handcuffed and sat back down again,
where he was read his rights.
Earlier yesterday, at a hastily called hearing that
drew attorneys to court in blue jeans and sweat
shirts, three justices of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals indicated that they had no authority to
impose prior restraint on the press to publish or
broadcast the material.
DeLorean attorney Howard Weitzman and co
counsel Donald Re told the appeals court judges
that broadcasts of the surveillance tapes would
make it virtually impossible to find an impartial jury
anywhere in the country to judge DeLorean on
cocaine conspiracy charges. They indicated the
broadcast might lead to a motion to dismiss all
charges and abort DeLorean's scheduled Nov. 1 tri
al.
Augusta gate crasher was alcoholic
Augusta, Georgia — The bearded outdoorsman
who crashed the gate of the Augusta National Golf
Club, took five hostages and demanded to speak to
President Reagan had been hospitalized in the past
suffering from alcoholism, a doctor said yesterday.
Charles Harris also was despondent over the loss
of his job and recent death of his father, friends said.
Harris, 45, remained under observation yesterday
at Augusta's University Hospital as federal and local
officials prepared charges against him.
Harris rammed a gate at the prestigious club with a
pickup truck Saturday and took two White House
aides and three others hostage, officials said. He
demanded to speak with Reagan, who was vacation
ing at the club and was on the 16th fairway at the
time.
Reagan called Harris five or six times but Harris
hung up on the president, apparently because he

of his job and recent death of his father, friends said.
Harris, 45, remained under observation yesterday
at Augusta's University Hospital as federal and local
officials prepared charges against him.
Harris rammed a gate at the prestigious club with a
pickup truck Saturday and took two White House
aides and three others hostage, officials said. He
demanded to speak with Reagan, who was vacation
ing at the club and was on the 16th fairway at the
time.
Reagan called Harris five or six times but Harris
hung up on the president, apparently because he
wanted to speak to him in person, said Richmond
County Sheriff J.B. Dykes.
Dykes said he persuaded Harris to release four of
the hostages, but he declined to say how. The last
hostage escaped after promising to bring Harris
some whiskey, he said.
Harris faces federal charges of threatening the
president and could face a variety of state charges
including kidnapping, aggravated assault, criminal
trespassing and criminal damage to property, said
U.S. attorney Hinton Pierce.
