Grenada fears U.S. invasion
Port of Spain, Trinidad â€” Grenada's ruling military
council placed its armed forces on alert and called
up militia reserves yesterday in the face of what it
said was an approaching threat of U.S. invasion.
The actions, announced over the official Radio
Free Grenada, came as eastern Caribbean leaders
met for the second day here to decide on sanctions
against General Hudson Hustin and his If>-member
council, which seized control of the tiny island last
Wednesday in a bloody coup that killed Prime Mini
ster Maurice Bishop and 16 others by official
Grenadian count.
Sources involved in the discussions here said the
Caribbean prime minsters were mainly seeking

agreement on economic and political santions. The
likelihood of U.S. military action on the 133-square
mile island also was part of their talks, they added,
because Washington would be reluctant to act with
out at least tacit approval from the region's demo
cratic governments.
Expressions of concern in Washington about the
safety of nearly 1000 Americans on Grenada have
been interpreted by officials here as a possible effort
to set the stage for their evacuation by a pair of U.S.
Navy task forces reported sailing toward the eastern
Caribbean.
One problem facing the leaders gathered here is
how to portray any U.S. intervention to avoid the
issue of "imperialism'' already raised by Grenada
and the Soviet Union, the officials said.
