# ASSU Senate to consider Reagan library options
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff Writer 
A resolution supporting the find
ings of a faculty committee report
on the Reagan presidential library
complex will be submitted for ap
proval at the ASSU Senate meeting
tomorrow night.
Su Uhland, author of the resolu
tion and member of the Council of
Presidents, said her resolution
"endorses" the report of Economics
Prof. James Rosse and eight other
faculty members submitted to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy in
early October.
The Rosse report stated that the
proposed Reagan library "could
become a valuable academic
resource," while a Reagan museum
would have "little or no academic
value." In addition, the committee
said that the proposed center for
public affairs should be "better in
tegrated in to Stanford's process of
academic governance."
Uhland's resolution calls for the
three components of the complex to
be "considered separately" and for

"careful consideration" to be taken
regarding the benefits and costs of
the library. The need to examine the
public's perception of the political
stance of the University should also
be considered, Uhland said.
Her resolution was cleared last
week by the Graduate Education
and Research Committee for sub
mission to the senate for considera
tion, according to GER chair Jim
McGrath. The committee put the
resolution in a "more balanced"
form for voting purposes, he said.
A second resolution on the com
plex was submitted to the GER ear
lier by Mark Soble, alternate under
graduate senator, and Roland Van
Gaalen, graduate senator, but was
not acted upon, McGrath said. It will
be offered as a substitute to Uh
land's and will probably be dis
cussed on the ASSU's agenda of
new business.
The Soble-Van Gaalen resolution
differs from Uhland's primarily on
the proposed center for public af
fairs. Van Gaalen said the issue is
"not political" and that there is "too
much concern about the appear
ance" of the center being con
nected with the Hoover Institution.
"We oppose the idea that the
Hoover Institution is guilty until
proven innocent," Van Caalen said.
He said that his resolution remains
"silent" on the connection with
Hoover.
"The real issue is academic
freedom," Van Caalen said. "Our
resolution is much more positive

(than Uhland's). We approve of the
center for public affairs provided it
be used as an academic facility. It
would increase the academic
strength of the University."
He said that Uhland's resolution
"doesn't say very much," noting
that her analysis does not state what
the costs and benefits are.
If passed by the senate, the effect
of Uhland's resolution, McGrath
said, would depend on how much
the Board of Trustees and the Fac
ulty Senate believe it represents the
legitimate feelings of the student
body.
