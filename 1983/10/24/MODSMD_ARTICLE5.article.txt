# ASSU Senate to consider Reagan library options
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff Writer 
A resolution supporting the find
ings of a faculty committee report
on the Reagan presidential library
complex will be submitted for ap
proval at the ASSU Senate meeting
tomorrow night.
Su Uhland, author of the resolu

Presidents, said her resolution
"endorses" the report of Economics
Prof. James Rosse and eight other
faculty members submitted to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy in
early October.
The Rosse report stated that the
proposed Reagan library "could
become a valuable academic
resource," while a Reagan museum
would have "little or no academic

be "considered separately" and for

"careful consideration" to be taken
regarding the benefits and costs of
the library. The need to examine the
public's perception of the political
stance of the University should also
be considered, Uhland said.
Her resolution was cleared last
week by the Graduate Education
and Research Committee for sub
mission to the senate for considera

McGrath. The committee put the
resolution in a "more balanced"
form for voting purposes, he said.

graduate senator, and Roland Van

not acted upon, McGrath said. It will
be offered as a substitute to Uh
land's and will probably be dis
cussed on the ASSU's agenda of
new business.
The Soble-Van Gaalen resolution
differs from Uhland's primarily on
the proposed center for public af
fairs. Van Gaalen said the issue is
