An estimated 1.5 million people
jammed streets in major Western
European cities this weekend, calling
for the cancellation of NATO's
planned December deployment of
medium-range nuclear missiles and
demanding an end to the arms race.
In West Germany, protest or
ganizers said about 1.2 million
demonstrators marched in Bonn,
Hamburg, West Berlin, Stuttgart and
Neu Ulm. Local police officials put
total nationwide rally attendance at
over 620,000.
It was estimated that over 180,000
took part in a demonstration at
Bonn University, while anti-missile
protesters managed a 64.8 mile
human chain from U.S. Army VII
headquarters in Stuttgart to an
American artillery unit at Neu Ulm,
site of a planned Pershing II installa
tion.
The Bonn rally included an ad
dress by former West German Chan
cellor Willy Brandt, a Nobel Peace
Prize winner and chairman of the
Social Democratic Party. Brandt
voiced his party's most explicit
rejection of the Atlantic alliance's
1979 decision to deploy the new
missiles.
"We don't need more means for
mass destruction," Brandt said.
"We need less. Therefore we say no
to all new nuclear missiles."
Brandt's remarks were challenged
in a later address by Petra Kelly,
chief of the radical Greens Party,
who pointed to Brandt's pro-
American orientation and support of
NATO. "A no to missiles and a yes
to NATO is absurd," Kelly said.
In London, hundreds of
thousands rallied in what was called
the largest protest of its kind in
British history. An estimated 350,000
marchers staged a mass lie-down
before Rome's St. Peter's Basilica, in
which demonstrators fell to the
ground on a pre-arranged signal —
symbolizing death — then rose,
chanting "Peace now."
Some 100,000 protestors brought
Vienna to a virtual standstill, while
an estimated 25,000 people marched
in Paris, 20,000 in Stockholm and
4000 in Dublin.
In the United States, thousands
participated in demonstrations at

more than 140 sites. Several
hundred protestors marched in San
Francisco, and demonstrators in
New York formed a 22-block human
chain between the United States
and Soviet missions to the United
Nations.
While local authorities reported
arrests at an Air Force base near Tuc
son, Arizona and at an arms manu
facturing plant in Newington, New
Hampshire, observers generally
described the protests as peaceful.
Administration officials agree that
the demonstrations are unlikely to
have any effect on the scheduled in
stallation of 108 Pershing II and 464
cruise missiles. In Saturday's nation
al radio address, President Reagan
accused the Soviets of "knee-jerk"
responses to American arms control
offers at the Geneva talks.
"What is the credibility of a
regime which exploits peace
demonstrations in the West," he
asked, "but puts down any
demonstrations for reduced
weaponry in its own country?"

An armed man demanded to talk to
President Reagan after crashing his
truck through the gates of an Augusta,
Georgia golf course and taking five
hostages, including two presidential
aides.
The president was isolated from
the incident and while one of the
aides said a shot was fired during
the two-hour siege Saturday after
noon, no injuries were reported. A
White House spokesman stressed
that "at no time was the president
ever in danger" in the most serious
breach of Reagan's personal secur
ity since John Hinckley's assassina
tion attempt in March, 1981.
While the president played golf
with Secretary of State George
Schultz, Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan, and former Sen. Nicholas
Brady (R-N.J.), a man later identified
as Charles Harris entered the pro
shop of the Augusta National Golf
Club and confronted two Reagan
aides.
Harris, a 45-year-old Augusta man
who officials later described as
seriously depressed and suffering

from a history of alcohol-related
problems, produced a .38 caliber
revolver and said "perhaps some
one would be killed" if his presiden
tial interview was not granted, ac
cording to one of the aides.
Harris dispatched one of the
hostages to summon the president,
who relayed the situation to Reagan.
Secret Service officials rushed him
down the fairway and into his
limousine, where the president
called the gunman on the mobile
telephone several times in an at
tempt to calm him.
While Harris apparently refused
to speak with Reagan, he agreed to
release the remaining hostages and
surrendered peacefully.
As Reagan was whisked back to
his quarters inside the golf com
pound, nine Secret Service agents
followed in an open car, each
waving a small machine gun. The
president appeared unaffected by
the incident and waved at
bystanders along the route.

Clashes between Democratic
presidential hopefuls escalated this
week, with Ohio Sen. John Glenn
declaring himself "the champion of
real Democrats" in response to an
earlier remark by former Vice-

President Walter Mondale, who
called Glenn "an anti-Democrat"
and a past Reaganomics supporter.
Mondale later apologized for his
comments, but indirectly attacked
Glenn on other fronts in a contest
that is increasingly overshadowing
the activities of other party
presidential aspirants.

The Swedish Academy awarded the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Stanford
Prof. Henry Taube, calling him "one
of the most creative contemporary
workers in inorganic chemistry."
Taube joined nine other Nobel
laureates on the Stanford faculty. An
additional five Nobel laureates are
associated with the Hoover Institu
tion.
A chemistry professor here since
1962, Taube was commended for his
work on the mechanisms of electron
transfer reactions, particularly in
metal complexes.
Across the Bay, UC-Berkeley Eco
nomics Prof. Gerard Debreu
received the Nobel Prize in econom
ics for what the Swedish Academy
called his incorporation of "new
analytical methods into economic
theory and for his rigorous refor
mulation of the theory of general
equilibrium."

Debreu's work seeks to mathema
tically substantiate the theory of
supply and demand. The Swedish
Academy said his mathematical
models furnish proof that prices do
affect the supply of products as
companies seek to maximize profits.

President Reagan named Middle
East special envoy Robert McFarlane
as his national security adviser, saying
the former Marine officer "shares
my views about the need for a
strong America."
The appointment reportedly
dismayed hard-line conservatives
who waged a strong lobbying cam
paign on behalf of U.N. Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick.
McFarlane, a former official in the
Nixon and Ford administrations, im
mediately assumed the job from
William Clark, nominated as secre
tary of the interior. The White
House job does not require Senate
confirmation.

Two United States diplomats left
Barbados yesterday to monitor the
safety of the estimated 1000 to 1200
Americans in Grenada, and 10 U.S.
warships heading for Lebanon were

diverted toward the island in a move
which the Grenada government
asserted foreshadows "imminent
military invasion."
A new revolutionary military
council assumed power in Grenada
Thursday after the executions of
Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and
five of his top followers by the army
and the installation of Gen. Fludson
Hustin as ruler.
The Reagan administration had
maintained cool relations with the
Bishop government, but a State De
partment spokesman stressed that
the United States did not play a role
in Bishop's downfall.
• • •
A national holiday for Martin Luther
King, Jr. received Congressional ap
proval despite efforts by the Conserva
tive Caucus to defeat the measure.
President Reagan promised to sign
the bill "since they seem bent of
making it a national holiday."
While Reagan did not identify the
meaning of "they," King's widow
said the president later apologized
for the remark, although White
FHouse aides claimed that the
Reagan "didn't know what he said"
when he issued the apology.
