## A
						look at U.S.-Soviet relations: Where do we stand? Congressman calls situation 'frigid' Big jump in Russian studies here 
### TROY EID BOB ORTTUNG 
Rep. Timothy Wirth (D-
Colo.) received his Ph.D. from
Stanford in 1967 after earning
bachelor's and master's
degrees at Harvard. First
elected to Congress in 1974, he
has become one of the 25 most
powerful members of the
House, according to The Al
manac of American Politics.
His brother, Prof. John
Wirth, serves on the faculty of
the I iistory Department here.
In an interview with The Dai
ly, Wirth discussed July's U.S.
Congress-Supreme Soviet talks
in Moscow - the first formal
parliamentary exchange be
tween the superpowers since
1979. During five days of exten
sive talks, the bipartisan U.S.
delegation met with counter
parts in the Soviet legislative
hierarchy, including the head
of the equivalent of the Envi
ronmental Protection Agency
and the chairman of the Soviet
Central Bank.
A member of the Budget
Committee and the Energy and
Commerce Committee and
chief of the House Democratic
Caucus' special task force on
long-term economic planning,
Wirth chaired the U.S. delega
tion on trade and economic re
lations at the Moscow talks.
The interview, conducted
shortly before the downing of
Korean Airlines flight 007 by the

Soviets, provides insight into
the course of superpower rela
tions, which experts generally
agree are not likely to improve
if the United States moves
ahead with its planned Decem
ber deployment of Pershing II
missiles in Europe.
Daily: How would you com
pare this latest Congressional
visit to the Soviet Union with
that of the 1979 parlimentary
exchange, in which you also
participated?
Wirth: It was much colder
this time around than it was
then. It was a much more frigid
rilationship.
In 1979 there was an enor
nous amount of hope. There
vas a great deal of progress
Deing made on a whole variety
of fronts and there was a very

positive feeling between the
two countries.
This time everything was
pretty well frozen.
Daily: You have said that you
"feel strongly that the Soviets
want to negotiate seriously" to
reduce nuclear weapons.
What factors have helped you
arrive at that opinion?
Wirth: I think it's what
they've said over and over
again. They have everything to
gain from negotiations and so
do we.
There's a sort of ideological
basis which seems to dominate
what the (Reagan) administra
tion is doing, (an ideology)
which says, "don't negotiate
and be tough" when discuss
ing arms control. It doesn't
make any sense.
Daily: In the past you've
talked about the "Walk in the
Woods" plan for reducing nu
clear weapons. Could you
summarize this concept?
Wirth: What Walk in the
Woods does is say that we will
not deploy Pershing II
(medium-range missiles) in
Europe, and in return the
Soviets will limit the number of
SS-19s or SS-20s.
There would also be limita
tions on the number of bom
bers and a freeze on any kind
of missiles in Asia.
Daily: Are these the kind of
negotiations you would like to

see take place?
Wirth: Absolutely. It's a
start. Everyone knows what
(Walk in the Woods) is and it's
a basis that ought to be
pursued.
Daily: Are you optimistic as
to whether or not these
negotiations will be fulfilled in
the near future?
Wirth: That's entirely up to
the administration. Unhappily,
we have running the adminis
tration's arms control negotia
tions an individual who said
that prior to assuming the job
he didn't believe in arms con
trol.
It's a bit difficult to assume
that the administration really
believes in arms control. It
seems to me that probably the
thing that will drive them more

than anything else is the politi
cal necessity of having some
kind of arms control agree
ment before the election in
November of 1984.
Daily: Do you think that
some kind of arms control
package is essential to a
Reagan re-election bid?
Wirth: I'm not sure that they
view it as essential, but I think
it's a major part of the founda
tion. They will be on much
more secure ground with an
arms control agreement than
without one.
Daily: Do you think the
Soviets would like to see
Reagan re-elected or ousted?
Wirth: I think the Soviets are
between a rock and a hard
place. On the one hand, if they
don't negotiate with Reagan,
they might say, "Well, that will
not help his re-election," and
it would be helpful for his op
ponent not to negotiate and
therefore they might have
someone else to deal with in
1985. That argues for them not
negotiating and coming to
some kind of an agreement.
On the other hand, if Reagan
wins in November of 1984, and
the Soviets negotiate with him
between now and 1984, he will
probably be easier to deal with
in the period between now and
the election than he will be
from 1985 to 1989 — at which
point he cannot run for re
election and is unaccountable
to anybody (except) the
ideologues who got him
elected.
So it cuts both ways. That's
the political decision that the
Soviets have to make.
Daily: How do you view the
Reagan decision to renew
grain sales to the Soviets
despite the fact that very little,
if anything, appears to have
changed in Poland and Af
ghanistan?
Wirth: I think that's a reality.
It doesn't do any good to
boycott grain (sales); they go
somewhere else and buy the
grain. It's only hurting us. It's
not changing the situation at
all.
I believe in the doctrine
which says the more involved
you get with the other guy, the
less likely it is thatyou're going
to come to blows. If we can
become more and more
embroiled with them in
various kinds of endeavors,
that's better for both sides.
Daily: How do you think the
Soviet government perceives
American involvement in
Nicaragua and El Salvador?
Wirth: I think they like to
tweek us about that. When we
talk about their involvement in
Afghanistan, the first thing
they turn around and say is
"What about El Salvador and
Nicaragua?"
Daily: Do you think there's a
correlation in their minds?
Wirth: In their minds, ab
solutely. Afghanistan is in their
backyard; Nicaragua and. El
Salvador are in our backyard.
Daily: Some scholars con-

While vodka sales may be
slumping off in the aftermath
of the Korean airliner incident,
the number of people taking
beginning Russian has in
creased by 25 percent this year.
Although most of the stu
dents and professors involved
see no direct correlation, fac
ulty members say the downing
of the Korean jetliner is a
manifestation of what lies un
derneath.
"The USSR was in the news a
lot this past year; one could
(easily) see the world as drawn
between the two great camps.
This confrontation mentality
makes the Soviet Union loom
largely in people's eyes," ex
plained William Todd, chair
man of the Slavic Languages
Department.
In the past, enrollment in
Russian language and policy
classes has increased in
response to non-violent
events: the publication of Al
exander Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag
Archipelago" and the launch
ing of Sputnik.
But because Russian lan
guage classes attract such a

wide variety of people, it is dif
ficult to explain why interest is
now increasing. There has
been a rise in the number of
social scientists taking the
courses, but there are also
many students interested in

Slavic literature or engineering
who are now studying the Rus
sian langauge, Todd said.
Many students say they are
concerned about the shortage
of qualified experts on Russian

foreign policy, a problem
brought to national attention
by a recent article in The Wash
ington Post. If the president
were to call together all the
American experts on Soviet
foreign policy, Post writer John
Stremlau claimed, they could
all meet around one card table.
But a number of students
here plan to change that.
The Korean airiiner incident
"cemented" Jennifer Her
man's decision to learn more
about the Soviet Union, she
said. Herman plans to use her
knowledge as a foreign adviser
to the government. "We need
good diplomacy (in the. Soviet
Union)," she said.
Todd said that it is very im
portant for Americans to learn
about the Soviet Union be
cause Soviets may not be able
to learn about the United
States.
"I think in someways we can
understand things better than
the people in the USSR; not
necessarily the big city intellec
tuals (in the Soviet Union), but
the people in the rural areas,
who don't have information on

the most interesting literary or
political events," Todd said.
"People here have access to
that information."
David Getzinger is studying
Russian because he thinks "it

will be an important language
in the next few years because
the two great superpowers are
working together more."
Getzinger hopes to use his
knowledge of Russian in inter
national law or the Foreign Ser
vice.
Wendy Koba, an aerospace
engineer, sees the Soviet
Union as a "nation that has a
lot of impact on the world" and
said she wants at least a little
knowledge of the language to
read about what the Soviet
Union is doing.
Some students here have
also had the opportunity to
visit the Soviet Union. Senior
Heather Purcell took one of
History Prof. Alexander Dal
lin's Soviet foreign policy
classes and then decided she
wanted to find out about Rus
sia for herself.
Purcell said that she felt
lucky because her tour group
let her wander around on her
own, allowing her to meet the
Soviet people.
"I even found an Elvis Cos
tello fan," she said.
Although Purcell toured the
Soviet Union before the
Korean airliner incident, she

said her travels did give her a
certain perspective on it.
"From the people I met, I
can't believe that the Russians
are all bad or completely anti-
American," she said.

what they've
said over and
over again.
They have
everything to

negotiations
and so do
we.'

Since the
Korean
jetliner
incident,
there's been
a 25 percent
increase in
the number
of students
in beginning
Russian
classes here.

ways we can
understand things
better than the
people in the USSR.'
