Students once again lined up outside the
ASSU office last week for the annual fee assess
ment refund ritual. Students waited in line with
open wallets, our duly-elected officers
searched their official files, and irritated stu
dents complained about the "new system."
Amid the hustle and bustle, we took a moment
to ask ourselves — why does the ASSU give
refunds, anyway?
The ASSU holds elections each year to find
out which groups students are and are not will
ing to fund. But the purpose of the election is
defeated if students know that in the end they
don't have to dish out the money. The balloting
is no longer an effective reading of student in
terest. The only way to accurately gauge student
interest is to have them vote on the money they
will spend.
Under the current system, only students who
voted in the election can get their money back.
(Freshmen and overseas students are exempt
from the rule.) This rule was enacted this year
after record numbers of students — including
those who voted and those who did not — lined
up outside the ASSU offices last year to get
refunds. It was clear that the elections did not
accurately gauge student interest when almost
40 percent of the students wanted their money
back.
The new system, which only gives refunds to
people who voted, does not solve the problem.
While the number of refunds is down, people
who vote in the election still know they don't
have to pay the assessments. They can get their
money back.
Part of the rationale for the refund system
may be found in its history. More than
ten years ago a few controversial groups des
perate for money began promising students
they could get a refund if the assessment
passed. As a result, students approved the

groups more willingly. After the elections,
these groups set up booths in White Plaza and
dished out thousands of dollars to students re
questing refunds.
The ASSU took on the task as an official ASSU
service after they became concerned about the
"lack of financial control." As a result, every
year since then the ASSU has had to deal with
the problem of low voter turnout in elections.
And student groups have gone crazy trying to fix
their budgets without knowing how much
money they would have to return to open
walleted students.
Supporters of the system argue that freshman
and students who were overseas during the
election should not have to pay the assessments
because they did not have an opportunity to
vote. This is a difficult problem given the tran
sient nature of our community. But these stu
dents still enjoy the benefits of ASSU services
when they are here, and they should help pay.
Another rationale for fee assessment refunds,
according to ASSU graduate senator Jim
McGrath, is that " if you have a violent
philosophical difference with that group on an
individual level, you have the right to get your
money back."
In response to McGrath, we can only say that
in a democratic system, "violent philisophical
differences" are most effectively expressed
through voting.
The no-refund system would have great ben
eficial results. Students would no longer sign
petitions allowing groups a spot on the ballot
unless they truly supported their interest. More
students would vote, and they would think
carefully about whether a group is worth the
money. In addition, student groups would be
able to budget their money without worrying
about refunds. Finally, the ASSU and students
would be rid of a lot of administrative hassles.
