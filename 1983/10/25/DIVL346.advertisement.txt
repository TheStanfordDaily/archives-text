Peace
Corps
Being a Peace Corps volunteer means taking what you
know, sharing it with others, and learning about life in
another country, another culture.
Developing nations want to grow more food to feed their
people . . . improve schools and expand public education
. . . provide adequate shelter and clean drinking water . . .
insure good health care and basic nutrition . . . build roads
and transportation systems.
The person who becomes a Peace Corps volunteer must
have a strong committment to helping other people. He or
she must be willing to learn their language . . . appreciate
their culture . . . and live modestly among them.
If this sounds like you, we'd like to show you the many
opportunities beginning soon in 65 developing nations. You
