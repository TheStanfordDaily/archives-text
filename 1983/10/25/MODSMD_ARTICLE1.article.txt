# Gender gap
## Women behind in computer age, study says 
### LARRY ESTAVAN 
Because computers are geared toward a
male audience, young girls find little interest
in developing computer skills, according to a
study c onducted by researchers here recent
ly-
In a new report, "Gender and Socioeco
nomic Differences in Enrollment in Comput
er Camps and Classes," Stanford researchers
Irene Miura and Robert Hess noted that
"three times as many boys as girls were en
rolled" in a camp designed to develop com
puter competency. They also said "the ratio
of males to females increased with grade,
cost of program and level of difficulty of
course offerings."
Judith Edwards Allen, director of the com
puter technology program at the Northwest
Regional Fducational Laboratory in Portland,

Oregon, predicted that "an enormous lead
ership gap" could occur between the sexes
in a decade, given the findings of the Miura-
Hess report.
"Women who have the leadership promise
and intellectual ability who don't pick up the
computer skills now will be left way behind,"
she said.
Apple Computer's G. Gregory Smith,
director of educational marketing, admitted
that his company targets its advertisements
toward males â€” and has no intention of
changing its pitch.
"The buyers of Apple computers are 98
percent male," he said. "We do not feel that
women represent any great untapped audi
ence."
In the report, Miura and Hess speculated

that this gender difference may be caused by
parents investing more in the future of their
sons' careers than their daughters', "as if the
parents were engaging in a cost-benefit analy
sis in their decisions about sending their
children to computer camps."
In addition, the researchers contended
that computers have become stereotyped in
the public media by being associated with
images ot science, mathematics, engineering
and other male-dominated professions.
Many computer games are also male
oriented, according to the study. "Even the
reputedly most popular computer game for
women is called Pacman,' " Miura and Hess
said.
The report pointed out that computers are

men are becoming computer- literate. The study points to the
training of young boys and girls as the foundations of the inequity.

LOTS TO FEW: Stanford's own LOTS seems to be no exception to a
study by researchers here which shows that more men than wo-
frequently used in schools to teach
mathematics and mathematical ap
plications, despite the documenta
tion in numerous studies that many
girls have "math phobia." It added
that women are also giving com
puters a lukewarm reception at the
college level.
Linda Caporael, an assistant
professor of psychology at the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and
a current researcher in student use
of microcomputers, concurred with
the study findings.
"Women are not involved with
computing as an extended activity"
she said. "They are cutting them
selves out. They're not participating
in what will be the predominant
technology of the very near future."
Veronica Falco, a teaching assis
tant and graduate student in com
puter science here, said, "the
proportion of women to men we see
in the computer science classes is
pretty low. I don't know what the
exact proportion is, but my guess is
it's around 20 to 30 percent women.
"For me and for other women it is
discouraging to be such a small part
of the field," she said. "You walk
into computer stores and get the
feeling they don't really care about
you."
Another student, Liz Berecz, a
junior majoring in economics, said
she works at the bookstore selling
computer science books, has taken
three quarters of computer science
and is interested in selling com
puters some time in the future. She
predicted that this will allow her to
stay more up-to-date with recent
developments in the field than some

managers.
"Most managers don't know
enough about the computer they
are using," she said.
However, other Stanford women
indicated that their interest in com
puters was minimal.
"I'm not into computers," said
Julie Womack, a senior majoring in
religious studies. "I had a lot of fun
learning flow-charting and program
ming and I've got a lot of friends
who are into computers, but other
things came along."
Although computers may not play
a dominant role in her current aca
demic cirriculum, Womack ad
mitted that "computers are basic for
any area you go into."
It is not surprising to find Stanford
students are computer-literate,
however, as Miura and Hess point
out in their report.
"Some observers fear that current
trends in computer use will lead to a
society in which high-income stu
dents will instruct computers and
low-income students will be in
structed by computers," they said.
They added that "new technolo
gies may threaten gains in education
and career opportunities for women
and minorities that have been
achieved at great effort in the past
two decades."
Miura and Hess concluded that
"the use of microcomputers in edu
cation started as a grass-roots move
ment and has followed traditional
lines of affluence, education, and
gender bias.
"Intervention by schools and
other public agencies may be
needed to prevent these inequities
from becoming even more deeply
ingrained into the society," they
said.
