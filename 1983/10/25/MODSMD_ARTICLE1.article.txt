# Gender gap
## Women behind in computer age, study says 
### LARRY ESTAVAN 
Because computers are geared toward a
male audience, young girls find little interest
in developing computer skills, according to a
study c onducted by researchers here recent
ly-
In a new report, "Gender and Socioeco
nomic Differences in Enrollment in Comput
er Camps and Classes," Stanford researchers
Irene Miura and Robert Hess noted that
"three times as many boys as girls were en
rolled" in a camp designed to develop com
puter competency. They also said "the ratio
of males to females increased with grade,
cost of program and level of difficulty of
course offerings."
Judith Edwards Allen, director of the com
puter technology program at the Northwest
Regional Fducational Laboratory in Portland,

Oregon, predicted that "an enormous lead
ership gap" could occur between the sexes
in a decade, given the findings of the Miura-
Hess report.
"Women who have the leadership promise
and intellectual ability who don't pick up the
computer skills now will be left way behind,"
she said.
Apple Computer's G. Gregory Smith,
director of educational marketing, admitted
that his company targets its advertisements
toward males â€” and has no intention of
changing its pitch.
"The buyers of Apple computers are 98
percent male," he said. "We do not feel that
women represent any great untapped audi
ence."
In the report, Miura and Hess speculated

that this gender difference may be caused by
parents investing more in the future of their
sons' careers than their daughters', "as if the
parents were engaging in a cost-benefit analy
sis in their decisions about sending their
children to computer camps."
In addition, the researchers contended
that computers have become stereotyped in
the public media by being associated with
images ot science, mathematics, engineering
and other male-dominated professions.
Many computer games are also male
oriented, according to the study. "Even the
reputedly most popular computer game for
women is called Pacman,' " Miura and Hess
said.
The report pointed out that computers are

men are becoming computer- literate. The study points to the
training of young boys and girls as the foundations of the inequity.

LOTS TO FEW: Stanford's own LOTS seems to be no exception to a
study by researchers here which shows that more men than wo-
