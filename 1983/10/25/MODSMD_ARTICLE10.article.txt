## The
						Stanford Daily Stop the covert aid now 
### 
Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos) met with the
Daily editorial board on Oct. 7 and strongly ex
pressed his opposition to U.S. covert aid to the
rebels fighting the Sandanista government in
Nicaragua.
Zschau, who represents Stanford voters in
Washington, had recently completed an 11-day
fact-finding tour of Central America. This tour
had "tended to confirm" his oppositior tc
covert aid, he said, and convinced him tc
become the only California Republican to vote
against the aid.
Last week, the House of Representatives
voted 227-194 to cut off covert U.S. aid to th
Nicaraguan counterrevolutionaries. Zschai.
this time bowed to party pressure and sup
ported the continued aid.
One of Zschau's aides in Washington said
the congressman had voted against the mea
sure authorizing the suspension of aid because
it was attached to an intelligence authorization
bill that called for an additional $50 million in
"overt" aid.
Actually, the bill stipulated that the $50 mil
lion would be used to help friendly Central
American nations intercept the alleged flow of
arms from Nicaragua to rebels in the region.
Rather than reaching for an excuse for change
in position, Zschau should have stuck to his
purported convictions and voted to end the
ClA's secret war in Nicaragua.
That the CIA does fund the Somocista forces
in Nicaragua is no longer open to debate.
Through the agency, the United States is sup
porting a collection of counterrevolutionaries
seeking to overthrow a legitimate government.
Not only is this policy illegal, but also it is in
efficient and foolish. By seeking to undermine

other governments that do not share its politi
cal views, the Reagan administration is eroding
the United States' already discredited standing
among nations throughout Central America
and the Third World.
In a related development the day of the
House vote, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Miguel d'Escoto presented four accords to the
Reagan administration calling for the end ot
U.S. support of the contras. In return, the
Nicaraguan government pledged not to sup
port the rebels in El Salvador.
But the next day, administration officials dis
missed the Nicaraguan proposals. A State De
partment spokesman justified this rejection by
saying that the accords could not be verified
and that they did not contain many of the
points outlined by the so-called Contadora
group — four countries in the region trying to
stop the warfare in Central America — in its
plan for regional peace.
Like Zschau's excuse for voting to support
covert aid, this reasoning seems to be another
attempt at rationalization to fulfill a purely poli
tical purpose. The Reagan administration is ap
parently committed to following the dictat of
bipolar politics and rejecting any compro lise
with the leftist Sandanistas.
The Senate is not expected to cut oft the
covert aid in its version of the 1984 intelligence
authorization bill. The issue will then have to
be resolved in a House/Senate conference
committee.
We hope that this conference committee will
refuse to support rebels against a legitimate
government and not, like Zschau, grasp for
weak excuses to follow a politically expedient
path.
