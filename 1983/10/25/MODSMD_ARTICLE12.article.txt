Boiling concert
"Pretentious," "hoity toity," and
pc npous"â€”those are three of
he many unjustified words than
rev iewer Scott Arey uses to
describe the audience at last Sun
day's Claude Boiling concert (Daily,
Oct. 20).
Though all three words have
elated meanings, let me restrict
nyself to "pretentious," which
means "claiming or demanding a
position of distinction or merit,
especially when unjustified." This
definition applies much more to
Arey s review than it does to the
audience he seems so appalled and
or fascinated by.
What could be more pretentious

than ridiculing the crowd for drink
ing wine and eating cookies, the
food served at the concert? How
about deciding (on some unex
plained basis) that the crowd was
"out to get Boiling?" That's a very
strange decision, since the non
subscription concert was practically
sold out, and most concert-goers
know don't buy tickets so they can
"get" a performer.
Is Arey's "position of distinc
tion," i.e., half a page of The Daily,
unjustified? I know he got his facts
wrong on the only music of the
program that I was familiar with.
Boiling did not play his version of
"The Entertainer" and "Maple Leaf
Rag," "working in familiar folk
themes. . . like Yankee Doodle."

Rather, he played "The Enter
tainer's Rag" by lay Roberts, which
incorporates "Yankee Doodle" and
"Dixie," and he played a rag of his
own, a tribute to Scott Joplin,
whose opening motif only im
itated )oplin's "Maple Leaf Rag." I
can only suspect how many more of
Arey's "facts" on the concert are
incorrect.
Arey probably felt (and probably
was) out of place at the concert. Bui
it is facile for an outsider feeling
uncomfortable (he apparently is a
"a self-respecting New Yorker"
who was made "ill" by the Nor
thern California audience) to label
the public's self-confidence and
comfortableness as pretentious
ness. I hope Arey and The Daily
editors who approved the article
will realize where the real pretense
lies before another such article
appears.

Grad students
I was disappointed, though not
surprised, by your editorial
headlined "Duty calls grad stu
dents," (Daily, Oct. 20), suggesting
that graduate students should
"reach out and get involved in the
University," This phrase, like the
frequent assertions that "almost all
students are now housed on
campus," shows the strong grip of
the idea that undergraduates are
the real University, and graduates
just an appendage on the same
level as the Stanford Shopping
Center.
Graduate students make up al
most half of the student body
around here, and to say that we
should "get involved" is like saying
that women should reach out and
get involved in America. We are
involved, but not in the way you
might want us to be.
fhe kind of involvement you are
talking about requires that under
graduates drop most of their
preconceptions about graduate
students, and that won't be easy.
So far as I know, most of the con
tact between the two occurs in
student-TA settings, and tends to
be quite formal, even adversarial, in
nature.
Moreover, I have been a graduate
student for 16 quarters and a TA for
one. The "working and learning
together" that you mention is
already taking place, and does not
promote much communication, or
commonality of interest. Until there
are opportunities (plenty of them)
for all of us to live, eat, play, talk
and drink together, you will have
little hope of understanding us. We
pretty much understand you, be
cause we used to be you. You need
to understand us, becuase many of
you are going to become us.
So where are these opportuni
ties? Res. Ed. has not provided
them. It just about stretches as far
as trying to get seniors and sop
homores (or was it juniors and
frosh?) together, but ignores grad
students almost totally. The one
small step taken in the direction I
advocate, namely allowing grad
students to live in co-op houses,
was literally forced by the action of
undergrads who refused to live
there themselves.
You can hardly expect the
Graduate Student Association to do
much; in budget and staff levels it
compares to Res. Ed. like a paper
airplane to a space shuttle, and it is
(quite rightly) devoting its efforts to
getting grad students together with
each other. Nor can you expect any
number of single-issue campaigns
to unite the student body. Most
graduate concerns are raised and
settled at the department level.
You need to put pressure on Res.
Ed. (they would never listen to us)
to dream up ways of putting the
two halves of the student body in
touch with each other, so we can
find out each other's attitudes,
interests and motivations. I'm not
actually suggesting integrated
housing; living in a dorm would
drive me nuts, frankly. Maybe Res.
Ed. isn t even the right vehicle for
such an effort.
Why don't you people think
about it some more?
