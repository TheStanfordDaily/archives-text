# U.S. must decide where it stands in the world
## 
### 
I'm tired of little countries. I'm tired of
them knocking the U.S., which is a pretty
great (and big) country. I'm tired of them sit
ting pretty in the United Nations, as if there
was even some justification of a podunk,
paltry Third World country having a near
equal discussion with a country like the U.S.
or the USSR. I'm tired of world opinion.
\\ seems that it the Seychelles has an equal
representation in the General Assembly of the
United Nations, then Bassett, Neb., ought to
have a couple of seats in the Senate. "It's not
the same thing," you say, "the U.N. is more
of a World Forum. It really can't legislate
much." Fine. Let the kids have their say. But
let's not wine them and dine them as they
spout off ignoble perturbations against the
host country.
The United Nations really has no power, so
there's not much sense in worrying about
what they say. Israel doesn't. South Africa
doesn't. The Russians don't. But I guess that
some folks have to humor the Third
Worlders. We're good at that.
I know, I know. People in little countries
deserve a voice. We should not be rude or
ignore little countries. They deserve many of

the rights and privileges which we extend to
our more powerful allies. But their opinion
should be observed only in relation to their
power and size, especially when their own
basic human rights are not an issue. Giving lip
service to a relatively powerless nation only
enhances the vague and inconsistent foreign
policies which seem to characterize the post-
Vietnam era.
Since Central America is made up of our
closest "little country" neighbors, let's talk
about them.
There are two solutions to the Central
American problem.
One: Take the whole region over. Another
Vietnam would be a very big mistake, of
course. What would work would be total and
complete control. We could force out the go
vernment and crush guerrilla resistance. Then
we'd start in with some good, solid land
reform. Fix up the economy. Show the people
what the good life is all about. And then,
when democracy was rolling along smoothly,
we could just leave and never come back.
Two: Leave now and never come back. The
people down south need to get a few
hundred years of pain and frustration off their
chests, and from an historical viewpoint it

seems that they are very close to or are now in
a revolutionary era. We can allow the blood to
be shed. From the rubble, let's hope, will
emerge some kind of consensus.
The problem with solution one, of course,
is that it just won't happen that way. The
United States has too little faith in itself to do
something so radical. It's kind of a rude solu
tion, too.
The problem with solution two is that the
Soviets and Cubans do not quite share our
view of national self-determination (if that
was the way we decided to go).
If this sounds as if Central America is unim
portant, then I've been a bit glib and I
apologize. While we sit, Nicaraguan children
are being bombarded with anti-U.S.
propaganda, taught by Cubans in villages
across the nation. We cannot deny the
banana republic legacy, but the skewed Marx
ist re-education program can only lead to a
tragic and mentally cloned generation. If we
are to preach self-determination, it should be
a cautious and watchful policy, with an eye on
Russian freighters.
But back to little countries. It would be nice
if they liked us, but it seems that we may be a
bit too busv throwing diplomatic parties and

feigning attention. What we should do is
decide how we, the United States, stand in
terms of the world international system. By
formulating a more even-handed and ag
gressive policy, we can show the world just
what we are made of, and what we stand for.
If we are to stand for democratic imperialism
or self-determination or a New International
Order then so be it. We must open up, so that
others can define us.
All of this thinking may sound a bit too Big
Brotherish. Yet I've known a great many
people who, if they had had a cool big brot
her, would have turned out much better.
Many smaller countries are not ready for the
changes which are about to engulf their
regions. If they desire the fruits of world eco
nomy (which the United States dominates)
then they are going to have to look to the
United States for guidance. The extent of the
guidance they seek (or in the case of many,
deny) will determine their future status as
free-thinking, independent nations.

I'm tired of little countries. I'm tired of
them knocking the U.S., which is a pretty
great (and big) country. I'm tired of them sit
ting pretty in the United Nations, as if there
was even some justification of a podunk,
paltry Third World country having a near
equal discussion with a country like the U.S.
or the USSR. I'm tired of world opinion.
\\ seems that it the Seychelles has an equal
representation in the General Assembly of the
United Nations, then Bassett, Neb., ought to
have a couple of seats in the Senate. "It's not
the same thing," you say, "the U.N. is more
of a World Forum. It really can't legislate
much." Fine. Let the kids have their say. But
let's not wine them and dine them as they
spout off ignoble perturbations against the
host country.
The United Nations really has no power, so
there's not much sense in worrying about
what they say. Israel doesn't. South Africa
doesn't. The Russians don't. But I guess that
some folks have to humor the Third
Worlders. We're good at that.
I know, I know. People in little countries
deserve a voice. We should not be rude or
ignore little countries. They deserve many of

the rights and privileges which we extend to
our more powerful allies. But their opinion
should be observed only in relation to their
power and size, especially when their own
basic human rights are not an issue. Giving lip
service to a relatively powerless nation only
enhances the vague and inconsistent foreign
policies which seem to characterize the post-
Vietnam era.
Since Central America is made up of our
closest "little country" neighbors, let's talk
about them.
There are two solutions to the Central
American problem.
One: Take the whole region over. Another
Vietnam would be a very big mistake, of
course. What would work would be total and
complete control. We could force out the go
vernment and crush guerrilla resistance. Then
we'd start in with some good, solid land
reform. Fix up the economy. Show the people
what the good life is all about. And then,
when democracy was rolling along smoothly,
we could just leave and never come back.
Two: Leave now and never come back. The
people down south need to get a few
hundred years of pain and frustration off their
chests, and from an historical viewpoint it

seems that they are very close to or are now in
a revolutionary era. We can allow the blood to
be shed. From the rubble, let's hope, will
emerge some kind of consensus.
The problem with solution one, of course,
is that it just won't happen that way. The
United States has too little faith in itself to do
something so radical. It's kind of a rude solu
tion, too.
The problem with solution two is that the
Soviets and Cubans do not quite share our
view of national self-determination (if that
was the way we decided to go).
If this sounds as if Central America is unim
portant, then I've been a bit glib and I
apologize. While we sit, Nicaraguan children
are being bombarded with anti-U.S.
propaganda, taught by Cubans in villages
across the nation. We cannot deny the
banana republic legacy, but the skewed Marx
ist re-education program can only lead to a
tragic and mentally cloned generation. If we
are to preach self-determination, it should be
a cautious and watchful policy, with an eye on
Russian freighters.
