## We've learned our lessons on energy conservation 
### 
Last week was the 10th anniver
sary of the Arab oil embargo, a time
for energy experts to blink and rub
their eyes. Service stations are again
giving away car washes and din
nerware. Mexico, a non-OPEC na
tion, has replaced Saudi Arabia as
America's largest foreign supplier of
petroleum. American oil imports
have declined for the fifth year in a
row.
What in the world happened to
the energy crisis? Have we scored a
secret victory in the Moral Equiva
lent of War?
The answer is yes and no.
The Reagan administration, taking
former Sen. George Aiken's Viet
nam advice to heart, has declared
the war won. Vet, during the last de
cade: A revolution in Iran has un
seated America's oldest ally in the
region; Iraq and Iran have engaged
in a vicious war that has proven both
mindless and endless; Anwar Sadat
has been assassinated; The Soviet
Union has crushed Afghanistan; Is
rael has bombed an Iraqi nuclear
plant; and once-beautiful Lebanon
has been turned into rubble.
France has just sold Iraq five
Super-Entendard jets that can
launch French-built Exocet missiles.
Iraq already owns the missiles. Iran
has announced that it will close the
Persian Gulf if the jets are used
against Iranian oil targets. (Sixty per
cent of Gulf oils flows though five
pumping stations in three ports.) A
recent study by the Congressional
Research Service concluded that an
interruption of Gulf oil could lead to
prices higher than $100 a barrel.
As in 1973, our leaders claim that
an interruption in oil supplies is in
conceivable. It is not obvious that
they are right this time either.
Nevertheless, the Reagan admin
istration has dismantled most of the
stand-by apparatus to cope with
future oil crises. For budgetary

reasons, it has even slowed the fil
ling of the strategic petroleum
reserve.
So what accounts for the good en
ergy news? The answer lies not in
our leaders but in ourselves. Per
capita energy use in the United
States has fallen to its lowest level
since 1967 because a large number
of Americans, in their own eco
nomic self-interest, have started
saving energy. Even while their go
vernment suppressed consumer in
formation, slashed conservation re
search, abolished energy-efficiency
standards, and resumed its pur
chases of large black limosines,
many Americans read their utility
bills and decided to get serious.
There were lessons to be learned

in 1973, and smart Americans
learned them. Smart Americans are
now buying high-mileage vehicles,
energy-efficient dwellings, and
thrifty appliances. The most efficient
new cars get 67 miles per gallon on
the highway — a five-fold improve
ment over the average car sold in
1973. Today's most frugal new
furnaces operate with 95-percent
efficiency. The most efficient new
refrigerators require about half as
much electricity as the average
refrigerator now in use.
Directly and indirectly, the
average American will use about 54
barrels of oil this year. Smart
Americans — without sacrificing
comfort, convenience or produc
tivity — will use fewer than 20 If the

whole nation followed their exam
ple, America could a significant ex
porter of fuel.
Regrettably, many Americans,
lulled by talk of an oil "glut," are
again buying gas guzzlers. Many
homebuilders are again building
flimsy energy sieves. Such short
sightedness may or may not lead to
another "crisis." But it will certainly
lead the average family to pay $1000
more per year in energy bills than it
needs to. Nationally, it will lead
America to waste half the fuel it
consumes — perhaps $4 trillion
worth during the next 20 years.
In some respects, 1983 appears to
vindicate the Reagan energy vision.
The inept federal government is
fumbling around, while individual

citizens and corporations save vast
amounts of energy in the private
marketplace.
Some unreconstructed liberals
will argue that the government is
not constitutionally required to be
inept, and that the President should
not be given too much credit for the
self-fulfilling scorn he heaps upon
his government. But even these
idealists — and I suppose I am one
of them — agree that, in the cur
rent context, the less we rely on the
government for salvation, the more
likely we are to be saved.
