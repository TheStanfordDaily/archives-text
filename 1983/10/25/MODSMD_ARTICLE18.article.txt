## UOP's last loss was to Stanford Card takes on No. 2 Tigers 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The simple tact that the
No. 2 and No. 3 ranked wo
men's volleyball teams in
the nation square oft
tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion makes it a
big match.
But there's more to it
than that.
Stanford, ranked third
and possessor of a 13-game
winning streak, knocked
the Universitv of the Pacific
Tigers out of the NCAA
post-season tournament
last December in the finals
of the Southern Regional in
Houston.
Not only did Stantord ad
vance to the Final Four, it
ruined UOP's chance to
have the home-court ad
vantage in the NCAA finals.
The finals site was Stock
ton, Calit., on the campus
of the University of the
Pacific.
"UOP's really going to be
atter us," Stanford assistant
coach Don Shaw said.
"They remember the
regionals."
The second-rated Tigers,
who are in first place in the
NorPac Conference, are
owners of a perfect 17-0
overall mark in 1983, with
their last loss coming 10
months ago in Houston to
Stanford, which is 13-2 and
undefeated in the WCAA.
UOP is led bv a pair of re
turning Ail-Americans,
llene Dempster and Jan
Saunders. Dempster leads
the team with 148 kills,
while Terese Boyle has 128
Perhaps the most as
tounding UOP statistic is
hitting percentage. The
Tigers hit at a .2b4 clip while
their opponents have
managed a mere .140 fig
ure. Stanford's team hitting
percentage is .190.
UOP also is known for its
fans, as busloads of Tiger
rooters are expected to be
on hand tonight .
