# Scholars debate policy council
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
A plan to enlist academics and government officials
in a proposed national international relations research
corporation has sparked debate concerning the par
ticipatory role of social scientists in American foreign
policy.
Prof. Robert Ward, director of Stanford's Center for
Research in International Affairs, co-authored the pro
posal with Prof. Samuel Huntington, director of Har
vard's Center for International Affairs.
The plan calls for a non-profit corporation composed
of a council of 15 to 20 presidents of the nation's major
research universities, a board of trustees made up of
scholars and a council of high-level representatives of
U.S. government agencies directly involved in foreign
policy-making, including the CIA and the Defense De
partment.
The scholars and federal officials would annually
draw up an agenda of "international or foreign area re
search fields or topics that relate to the basic and long
term shared interests of the U.S. government and and
American scholarship," Ward noted in a recent article
on the proposal.
He added that the corporation would spend federal
money on research projects that help meet its agenda,
and the scholars would decide which research
proposals to fund.
The results of the research projects would, with the
researchers' permission, be sent to interested federal
agencies, Ward said.
Authorities said the debate concentrates on at least
four questions:

— Is research on long-range issues useful to govern
ment officials who deal with short-term problems ?
— Is the academic freedom of a social scientist com
promised when his research is indirectly sponsored by
defense and intelligence agencies ?
— Can scholars work in developing countries if their
research is supported by foreign policy agencies ?
— What should be the relationship between social
scientists and the foreign policy agencies ?
Ward stressed that schoJarly research can help
federal officials formulate coherent policies, adding
that U.S. conduct in pre-revolutionary Iran provides
just one example of a region where the American go
vernment could have implemented more effective
policies had it utilized the numerous scholarly reports
stressing the fragility of the Shah's power.
"It would be helpful if sound and accurate informa
tion on trends within nations were at the disposal of the
federal government," Ward said.
Political Science Prof. Robert North said scholars of
international relations can provide valuable insights to
policy-makers.
"The value of a scholar's position is that he has the
time to bring historical considerations to bear upon the
present. I think it would be highly desirable if policy
makers could be exposed in some systematic way to
the long-range views of scholars," North said.
Political Science Prof. Richard Fagen disagreed. He
said the proposal is partly an attempt to co-opt scholars
who became estranged from the federal government
after the Vietnam War.
"It is a way of controlling dissent by centralizing the
flow of money and shutting off the kind of independent
and high critical scholarship that is going on now,"
Fagen said.
Leading scholars of international relations and area
studies would not participate in the council because
"many of the very best people really won't have any as
sociation with the government, Fagan said. "They are
not 'patriotic Americans' in the way Ward is," he said.
Fagen said he questions contentions that policy
makers are overly critical of scholarly viewpoints.
"The officials just reflect the culture they come
from,"he said. "There is no party of the left. There
really isn't a rich discussion of political ideas. Discus
sion runs from the center to the extreme right."
Prof. Elie Abel, chairman of the communication de
partment, said officials in federal agencies should pay
close attention to the findings of scholars.
He stressed that while "people from the academic
world have played a fairly important role" in formulat
ing policies, "they have not turned out to be very suc
cessful" in every case.
"I think scholars ought to be very careful to avoid
thinking they are uniquely qualified to answer ques
tions much of humanity has been grappling with for
centuries," he said.
Some professors said defense and intelligence
agencies tend to sponsor narrow research projects de
signed to meet their immediate goals rather than
promoting studies directly aimed at serving broad
based societal needs.
North, who has conducted research funded by the
Defense Department and earlier interned for the State
Department, noted that although the agencies did not
try to control his work, "the definition of the problem
they wanted me to look at tended to limit my freedom
of investigation."
Fagen said good basic research cannot be performed
under the direct or even indirect sponsorship of
foreign policy agencies.
"None of (those agencies) are really interested in a
broad range of debate," he said. "They are interested
in finding ideas which suppport their viewpoint."
Ward said the proposal's council of scholars would
assure that all projects focus upon issues of broad con
cern. He added that representatives of defense and in
telligence agencies would only participate in setting the

yearly research agenda.
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy said involve
ment by intelligence and defense agencies in interna
tional relations research could hamper research in de
veloping countries by American scholars.
People would be reluctant to talk with American
scholars for fear that researchers would hand over
sensitive information to an intelligence agency, he said.
He added that Americans conducting research in de
veloping countries might be assumed to be secret U.S.
government agents by local authorities, which could
place scholars in potentially intimidating, even danger
ous positions.
Fagan said the participation of the CIA or the Defense
Department in area studies research would destroy
trust between Latin Americans and U.S. scholars.
Latin Americans might believe that a scholar who
receives funding from a council that includes such go
vernment representatives "is a person who is at the ser
vice of those agencies," he said.
Ward acknowledged that the participation of defense
and intelligence agencies in the proposed corporation
could hurt the image of American scholars.
"We are very much concerned about the problem
ourselves," he said. "But they (American scholars of
developing countries) already have difficulties of
access.
"The notion of free access to research sites clearly no
longer exists," he said.
The professors interviewed by The Daily offered
various opinions as to what types of relationship should
exist between scholars of international relations and
foreign policy agencies.
Poltical Science Prof. Robert Packenham said each in
ternational relations scholar should be free to form
ulate his individual link to the government.
A range of relationships between researchers and the
government would prevent international relations ex
perts from being compelled to align with government
objectives, he said.
Fagen said scholars cannot work as advisers to
foreign policy agencies without losing some of their in
dependence.
"If you want to get involved in government, get a po
sition in government," he said. "I think you are either
in or out. Vou cannot be a handmaiden."
Ward noted that American international relations
scholars have obligations to serve their country.
"It is the only government we have," he said.

vernment representatives "is a person who is at the ser
vice of those agencies," he said.
Ward acknowledged that the participation of defense
and intelligence agencies in the proposed corporation
could hurt the image of American scholars.
"We are very much concerned about the problem
ourselves," he said. "But they (American scholars of
developing countries) already have difficulties of
access.
"The notion of free access to research sites clearly no
longer exists," he said.
The professors interviewed by The Daily offered
various opinions as to what types of relationship should
exist between scholars of international relations and
foreign policy agencies.
Poltical Science Prof. Robert Packenham said each in
ternational relations scholar should be free to form
ulate his individual link to the government.
A range of relationships between researchers and the
government would prevent international relations ex
perts from being compelled to align with government
objectives, he said.
Fagen said scholars cannot work as advisers to
foreign policy agencies without losing some of their in
dependence.
"If you want to get involved in government, get a po
sition in government," he said. "I think you are either
in or out. Vou cannot be a handmaiden."
Ward noted that American international relations
scholars have obligations to serve their country.
"It is the only government we have," he said.
A plan to enlist academics and government officials
in a proposed national international relations research
corporation has sparked debate concerning the par
ticipatory role of social scientists in American foreign
policy.
Prof. Robert Ward, director of Stanford's Center for
Research in International Affairs, co-authored the pro
posal with Prof. Samuel Huntington, director of Har
vard's Center for International Affairs.
The plan calls for a non-profit corporation composed
of a council of 15 to 20 presidents of the nation's major
research universities, a board of trustees made up of
scholars and a council of high-level representatives of
U.S. government agencies directly involved in foreign
policy-making, including the CIA and the Defense De
partment.
The scholars and federal officials would annually
draw up an agenda of "international or foreign area re
search fields or topics that relate to the basic and long
term shared interests of the U.S. government and and
American scholarship," Ward noted in a recent article
on the proposal.
He added that the corporation would spend federal
money on research projects that help meet its agenda,
and the scholars would decide which research
proposals to fund.
The results of the research projects would, with the
researchers' permission, be sent to interested federal
agencies, Ward said.
Authorities said the debate concentrates on at least
four questions:

— Is research on long-range issues useful to govern
ment officials who deal with short-term problems ?
— Is the academic freedom of a social scientist com
promised when his research is indirectly sponsored by
defense and intelligence agencies ?
— Can scholars work in developing countries if their
research is supported by foreign policy agencies ?
— What should be the relationship between social
scientists and the foreign policy agencies ?
Ward stressed that schoJarly research can help
federal officials formulate coherent policies, adding
that U.S. conduct in pre-revolutionary Iran provides
just one example of a region where the American go
vernment could have implemented more effective
policies had it utilized the numerous scholarly reports
stressing the fragility of the Shah's power.
"It would be helpful if sound and accurate informa
tion on trends within nations were at the disposal of the
federal government," Ward said.
Political Science Prof. Robert North said scholars of
international relations can provide valuable insights to
policy-makers.
"The value of a scholar's position is that he has the
time to bring historical considerations to bear upon the
present. I think it would be highly desirable if policy
makers could be exposed in some systematic way to
the long-range views of scholars," North said.
Political Science Prof. Richard Fagen disagreed. He
said the proposal is partly an attempt to co-opt scholars
who became estranged from the federal government
after the Vietnam War.
"It is a way of controlling dissent by centralizing the
flow of money and shutting off the kind of independent
and high critical scholarship that is going on now,"
Fagen said.
Leading scholars of international relations and area
studies would not participate in the council because
"many of the very best people really won't have any as
sociation with the government, Fagan said. "They are
not 'patriotic Americans' in the way Ward is," he said.
Fagen said he questions contentions that policy
makers are overly critical of scholarly viewpoints.
"The officials just reflect the culture they come
from,"he said. "There is no party of the left. There
really isn't a rich discussion of political ideas. Discus
sion runs from the center to the extreme right."
Prof. Elie Abel, chairman of the communication de
partment, said officials in federal agencies should pay
close attention to the findings of scholars.
He stressed that while "people from the academic
world have played a fairly important role" in formulat
ing policies, "they have not turned out to be very suc
cessful" in every case.
"I think scholars ought to be very careful to avoid
thinking they are uniquely qualified to answer ques
tions much of humanity has been grappling with for
centuries," he said.
Some professors said defense and intelligence
agencies tend to sponsor narrow research projects de
signed to meet their immediate goals rather than
promoting studies directly aimed at serving broad
based societal needs.
North, who has conducted research funded by the
Defense Department and earlier interned for the State
Department, noted that although the agencies did not
try to control his work, "the definition of the problem
they wanted me to look at tended to limit my freedom
of investigation."
Fagen said good basic research cannot be performed
under the direct or even indirect sponsorship of
foreign policy agencies.
"None of (those agencies) are really interested in a
broad range of debate," he said. "They are interested
in finding ideas which suppport their viewpoint."
Ward said the proposal's council of scholars would
assure that all projects focus upon issues of broad con
cern. He added that representatives of defense and in
telligence agencies would only participate in setting the

yearly research agenda.
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy said involve
ment by intelligence and defense agencies in interna
tional relations research could hamper research in de
veloping countries by American scholars.
People would be reluctant to talk with American
scholars for fear that researchers would hand over
sensitive information to an intelligence agency, he said.
He added that Americans conducting research in de
veloping countries might be assumed to be secret U.S.
government agents by local authorities, which could
place scholars in potentially intimidating, even danger
ous positions.
Fagan said the participation of the CIA or the Defense
Department in area studies research would destroy
trust between Latin Americans and U.S. scholars.
