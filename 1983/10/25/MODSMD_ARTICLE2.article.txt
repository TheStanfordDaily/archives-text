### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
A plan to enlist academics and government officials
in a proposed national international relations research
corporation has sparked debate concerning the par
ticipatory role of social scientists in American foreign
policy.
Prof. Robert Ward, director of Stanford's Center for
Research in International Affairs, co-authored the pro
posal with Prof. Samuel Huntington, director of Har
vard's Center for International Affairs.
The plan calls for a non-profit corporation composed
of a council of 15 to 20 presidents of the nation's major
research universities, a board of trustees made up of
scholars and a council of high-level representatives of
U.S. government agencies directly involved in foreign
policy-making, including the CIA and the Defense De
partment.
The scholars and federal officials would annually
draw up an agenda of "international or foreign area re
search fields or topics that relate to the basic and long
term shared interests of the U.S. government and and
American scholarship," Ward noted in a recent article
on the proposal.
He added that the corporation would spend federal
money on research projects that help meet its agenda,
and the scholars would decide which research
proposals to fund.
The results of the research projects would, with the
researchers' permission, be sent to interested federal
agencies, Ward said.
Authorities said the debate concentrates on at least
four questions:

— Is research on long-range issues useful to govern
ment officials who deal with short-term problems ?
— Is the academic freedom of a social scientist com
promised when his research is indirectly sponsored by
defense and intelligence agencies ?
— Can scholars work in developing countries if their
research is supported by foreign policy agencies ?
— What should be the relationship between social
scientists and the foreign policy agencies ?
Ward stressed that schoJarly research can help
federal officials formulate coherent policies, adding
that U.S. conduct in pre-revolutionary Iran provides
just one example of a region where the American go
vernment could have implemented more effective
policies had it utilized the numerous scholarly reports
stressing the fragility of the Shah's power.
"It would be helpful if sound and accurate informa
tion on trends within nations were at the disposal of the
federal government," Ward said.
Political Science Prof. Robert North said scholars of
international relations can provide valuable insights to
policy-makers.
"The value of a scholar's position is that he has the
time to bring historical considerations to bear upon the
present. I think it would be highly desirable if policy
makers could be exposed in some systematic way to
the long-range views of scholars," North said.
Political Science Prof. Richard Fagen disagreed. He
said the proposal is partly an attempt to co-opt scholars
who became estranged from the federal government
after the Vietnam War.
"It is a way of controlling dissent by centralizing the
