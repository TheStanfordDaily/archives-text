## The 						Killer kills Berkeley 
### MIKE HALE 
The Killer played Berkeley Saturday night,
but Berkeley didn't seem to notice — a lot of
people made it to the Community Theatre
for the show, but they looked as if they'd
driven a ways to get there. Berkeley High
had probably never seen so many leisure
suits, leather jackets and pompadours.
When Jerry Lee Lewis is in town, the true
believers come out of the woodwork, and in
this area I suspect most of the woodwork
lies south of Oakland and east of Sunnyvale.
Lewis's music and his show are the em
bodiment — the powerful, polished, beauti
fully planned and tremendously satisfying
embodiment — of certain American (male)
values you rarely encounter in their pure
form at, for instance, Stanford. Lewis talks
and sings to the men in his audience; wo
men are welcome to come and listen, and
possibly swoon in the face of Jerry Lee's
sexual bravado, but they can't really be a
part of things — they're what all the songs
are about, after all.
Lewis' recording career falls neatly into
two parts, the early rock phase and the late
country phase — pre- and post-fall, as it
were — with the change coming 10 years
after his 1958 marriage to his 14-year-old
cousin. Lewis spent the 1960s blacklisted,
playing rock and roll to faithful audiences
across the South but not getting airplay and
not selling any records. In 1968, in an at
tempt to rekindle his dead career, Lewis
began recording country albums. The com
promise was a success, and since then he
has worked more and more of the country
material into his live show. Saturday night
he alternated rock shouters and country bal
lads almost one-for-one (opening and
closing, of course, with the fastest, loudest

numbers imaginable).
An awful Marin-based band named Bill
and the Boppers opened for Lewis, and
played rockabilly and country standards as if
they were at a Tamalpais High sock hop.
There show was like a wax museum of '50s
and early '60s pop music — imitations (and I
mean imitations) of Gene Vincent, Hank
Williams, Roy Orbison, Chuck Berry, Johnny
Cash, and Elvis. Lewis, who at 48 deserves to
be in a museum himself, exhibited 10 times
as much life. The two acts pointed up the
difference between playing great songs, and
putting on a great show; Lewis, often
working with decidedly inferior material,
transformed his simple-minded rock shouts
and often insipid country ballads into some
thing profound. Part of this is choreography
— what often seemed like chaos on stage
was a carefully planned procession, carried
along on effortless changes of tempo and
mood. (Lewis's band was doubtless the best
Tennessee has to offer.) But more important
is the musical skill that supports Lewis'
wildman pose — listen closely while he
shouts out "Great Balls of Fire" or
"Chantilly Lace," and you hear a masterful,
rich voice that creates the illusion of aban
don while maintaining complete control.
When Lewis took the stage, he promised
"Jerry Lee is gonna lose control." It was a
baldfaced lie, of course, but believing for an
hour that it might happen was a joyous ex
perience. Lewis didn't even get up off his
piano bench until the last number ("Whole
Lotta Shakin' "), at which point he kicked
back the bench, as everyone knew he
would, and pounded away standing up. He
came back for one encore ("Good Golly
Miss Molly" and "Tutti Frutti"), then
strutted offstage without a backward glance.
