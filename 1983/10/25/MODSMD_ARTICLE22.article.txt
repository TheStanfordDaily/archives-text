# AC/DC on tour: another great show
## 
### DEAN AVARY 
Query: "So, how would you
like to go to the AC/DC con
cert on Wednesday night? I've
got two free tickets."
Answer: "No Dean, I'd
rather die."
The preceding is just a
sample ot the responses I got
to what I thought was a fairly
reasonable invitation. I am
now aware that asking your
typical Stanford student to an
AC/DC concert is not unlike
offering them a healthy dose
of herpes.
Well, so be it. For the few
and the brave who dared to
venture into the Cow Palace
last Wednesday night were
treated to an impressive show
of heavy metal rock.
Before I begin to describe
the concert, I would like to say
that I was highly unap
preciative of the holy water

sprinkled upon me by various
people from rather rigid religi
ous backgrounds before I left.
Just because 70 percent of
AC/DC's songs are either
about Hell or sex doesn't nec
essarily mean they're demons
from below. Hmmmmmm
Perhaps the only unfortun
ate part of the concert was the
opening band, Fastway. They
hit the stage at 8 p.m. and
began to crank through 45
minutes of an unfortunate
blend of dubious showman
ship and even worse music.
This flash-in-the-pan band
with one hit ("Say What You
Will") somehow managed,
very annoyingly, to work in
the words "San Francisco"
into every song they played,
and to excessively pump a
quickly deflated audience for
response.
Undaunted by the feeble re
action, they returned for an
encore (mercifully, only one),
then left â€” hopefully never to
be seen again.
A half hour later, the house
lights dimmed again and a
spotlight picked out Angus
Young, AC/DC's bad-boy lead
guitarist atop one of the enor
mous speaker cabinets.
Dressed in his traditional
school-boy garb, he let fly
with a couple of riffs from his
Gibson, then jumped 15 feet
to the stage hitting the ground
on the first beat of "Guns for
Hire", one of the stronger
songs off their recent Flick of
the Switch release. They in
cluded three other songs from
Flick of the Switch: the title
track, "This House is on Fire"
and "Rising Power".
While this recent work is
less potent than previous
AC/DC endeavors, stylistically
it comes close to the 1980
gear-change album Back in
Black. In a recent review, Rol
ling Stone cynically asserts: "

. . . the Australian mega-bar
band . . . has now made the
same album nine times . . . ."
This brings us to why it is
that people buy AC/DC al
bums, much less go to their
concerts? We know these
strange creatures are out
there: Back in Black sold bet
ter in 1980 than any other rock
release that year. The Cow
Palace was completely sold
out Wednesday night, as are
most AC/DC concerts around
the world. Why?
Well, if you go beyond Brian
Johnson's raspy voice, many
find a hardcore, stripped
down version of rock that ap
peals to one's baser instincts.
In fact, the primal scream
release of listening to an
AC/DC concert or album may
in fact leave you in better
mental health than trying to
unravel the metaphorical mys
teries and intricacies of an al
bum such as Pink Floyd's The
Wall. It may also leave you
deaf. LojJ i> definitely the or
der of the day and earplugs
are a must. AC/DC's only
saving grace is that they tour
with one of the best sound
systems around.
It also seems that AC/DC
can afford the best in other
areas: an awesome array of
gold-chromed, computer
controlled lights, a 1.5 ton bell
for the intro to "Hell's Bells"
and two authentic, restored
English battle cannons for the
21-gun salute on "For Those
About to Rock, We Salute
You."
Though no expense has
been spared for some fancy
effects, these are mainly the
exception, as AC/DC was
more concerned with string
ing together song after song,
slowly blasting away your
defenses until you were a
mass of undulating jelly.
One of their principal ways
of accomplishing this is with

their rhythm section. During
the concert the burning ques
tion in any AC/DC af
icionado's mind was whether
the replacement drummer for
Phil Rudd would keep things
moving. The answer was not
long in coming. AC/DC's
crunching rhythm section with
Cliff Williams on bass and Mal
colm Young on rhythm guitar
was as strong as ever.
The star of the show, as al
ways, was of course Angus
Young. Either thrashing
around on the ground or on
his feet Angus was the ul
timate showman. His strip
tease during "Bad Boy
Boogie" has become famous
in rock circles, as have his
forays out into the audience
on Brian Johnson's shoulders
during "Let There Be Rock".
Though certainly not one of
rock's more diverse guitarists,
his lightening-fast bluesy style
is a good foil for the more
lugubrious rhythm section.
One certainly has to be
amazed at his energy and
stamina, and the show is de
signed around this fact.
Malcolm Young and Cliff
Williams come to the front of
the stage only for backup vo
cals, and Brian lohnson,
though energetic, stays pretty
much out of the way as Angus
tears up the stage.
By the end of two hours,
AC/DC had crunched through
material from Bon Scott's era
("Highway to Hell"," Whole
Lotta Rosie", "The lack" and
of course "Sin City") as well as
material from the post "Back
in Black" period. After a five
minute break, they returned
to perform "You Shook Me All
Night Long" and "For Those
About To Rock" during which
the two cannons were
levitated 60 feet into the air to
fire at each other. AC/DC fans
were transported to hard-rock
heaven.


HEAVY METAL ROCK GUITARISTS FROM HELL: Australian
rock group AC/DC appeared at the Cow Palace last Wednes-

day night. As expected, they provided another of their
deafening performances.
