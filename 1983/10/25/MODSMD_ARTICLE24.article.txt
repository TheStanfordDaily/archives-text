Preview airing Tuesdays from 5-8 p.m. and on Dance for
Vour Dinner Thursdays from 5-8 p.m.

The Chameleons — Script of the Bridge

This debut album prom
ises to be one of the most
significant import albums
of the year. Although it may
be difficult to place the
Chameleons' sound in a
particular class, this proves
to be a great asset. Rather
than following the latest
rage of mimicking "new
music" acts that have
proven successful, this
British quartet has created a
sound unlike anything else.
If you enjoy deep English

vocals with driving distor
tion melodies, you should
definitely give this record a
listen. —Frank Bird

Madness — 'Wings of a Dove'

"Wings of a Dove"
becomes an appropriate
follow-up to the commer
cial success achieved with
the hit single "Our

House." The "Wings of a
Dove" sound incorporates
the current pseudo/reggae
steel band instrumentation
with Elvis Costello's "I
Write the Book" backing
vocals. This combination,
in effect, removes Madness
from the "new-ska" cate
gory and allows them to en
ter the mainstream scene.
The song, subtitled "A
Celebratory Song," seems
to celebrate their new
popularity with wittv Mad
ness lyrics and a lively
dance beat. —Kate Sessions
