## MTV: marriage of music and video 
### 
Titillating the youth culture and changing the way
the music industry operates, Music Television, or
MTV, plays videoclips by rock bands 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. Provided as a basic cable service,
as opposed to pay-TV programs like HBO or
Showtime, MTV has entered the homes of 15 million
Americans, thus spurring record sales and creating
an industry out of thin air and technology.
Owned by corporate spouses Warner Brothers
and American Express, MTV is a typically well-run
capitalist enterprise that curiously has yet to turn a
profit. It targets the 14-34 age group, and its basic
aim is to keep these youth glued to the blue glow of
their Trinitrons. Since MTV relies solely on advertis
ing as its revenue source, its profitability depends
on its market penetration and its appeal to a high
percentage of its target audience.
Toward this end MTV has created a fantasy world
accessible via the nearest cable-ready TV set. Clever
promotions, including a contest in which the winner
is whisked off by jet to see and meet the Police, and
the presence of perpetually exuberant "video jock
eys" attest to the astuteness of MTV's promoters.
Even more important to MTV's rise in the music
business has been its format which combines hard
rock with marketable new wave. Trying to strike a
balance between America's heavy metal fans —who
have been weaned on a steady diet of AC/DC, Jour
ney, and Loverboy — and new wave veterans — who
have graduated from the Sex Pistols to Spandau Bal
let — is a delicate task.
MTV caters to both worlds; scantily-clad models
in American-made videos target the young male
libido, while English videos feature artists trying to
charm America's new progressive set.
MTV's very simple weapon, the frequency of song
rotation, attempts to reconcile the tastes of these
two audiences. Radio programmers have long
known that if they play a given song often enough,
they can create a market for that song. Programmers

influence tastes by placing a song in light, medium,
or heavy rotation. Familiarity in this case breeds af
finity. Billy Idol is thus seen as tolerable strangeness
to the average Def Leppard fan.
Major rock radio stations are so risk-averse in their
programming that they probably never considered
giving Men At Work's debut LP any airplay. MTV'
recognized the group's commercial potential and in
troduced them to U.S. viewers, thereby launching
the Australians' careers.
The correlation between MTV video play and
record sales is well documented. A high quality
videoclip is becoming a prerequisite to commercial
success. Clips are shown on more than 100 music
video television shows, and many nightclubs now
feature dancing to video.
The video phenomenon has given unknown
performers another avenue toward recognition by
record companies. A group which makes and
finances a good independent video gives a record
company an added incentive to sign the band, since
they already have a finished product.
Videos play a dual role for bands. They are a crea
tive expression of the band's material, but more im
portantly they are a walking advertisement for the
group. This second function is most obvious in
videos in which the images have nothing to do with
the song, and many videos are sex and violence
montages designed to appeal to the lowest common
denominator of American taste.
MTV's main problem is that it underestimates its
ability to provide a more eclectic range of music
styles. Critics have leveled one major attack on MTV'
— that it is a racist form nf media because it plays
mostly white performers, with notable exceptions
including Prince and Michael Jackson. Yet as a
profit-seeking venture MTV wants to maximize its
commercial appeal, and it obviously feels it can do
that by targeting a certain demographic group and
catering to that group's perceived tastes.
MTV is not racist, only capitalistic and thus not ter

ribly interested in providing what many think of as a
social good, that of highlighting black as well as
white performers. MTV errs in its assumption that
young white people will only appreciate a mix of
heavy metal and flashy new wave. With its rotation
system, MTV' could play more funk and get away
with it; in fact it would probably enlarge its audi
ence, and soon we could see Midwesterners
hippity-hopping their way to high school. Breaking
down traditional racial barriers in music, much like
Elvis Presley did when he introduced "black" music
to American teenagers, is not incongruous with
MTV's principal aim of making money.
MTV's main accomplishment has been to bolster
the music industry by giving increased exposure to
both new and established performers. Few consu
mers are willing to spend $7 to $8 on an album they
have never heard. MTV's effect on record sales is
clear and can be expected to increase as more areas
acquire cable. The appeal of Music Television lies in
its seductive mindlessness; it furnishes a constant
supply of escapism in a world where demand is
high.

developed a cult following at Stanford, as evidenced
by their well-received show last Saturday at the
Keystone Palo Alto. The Combo has added a new
keyboard player, which enables Bonnie to strut
more often. They will return to the Keystone in late
November . . . Romeo Void headlines a Halloween

tive expression of the band's material, but more im
portantly they are a walking advertisement for the
group. This second function is most obvious in
videos in which the images have nothing to do with
the song, and many videos are sex and violence
montages designed to appeal to the lowest common
denominator of American taste.
MTV's main problem is that it underestimates its
ability to provide a more eclectic range of music
styles. Critics have leveled one major attack on MTV'
— that it is a racist form nf media because it plays
mostly white performers, with notable exceptions
including Prince and Michael Jackson. Yet as a
profit-seeking venture MTV wants to maximize its
commercial appeal, and it obviously feels it can do
that by targeting a certain demographic group and
catering to that group's perceived tastes.
MTV is not racist, only capitalistic and thus not ter

ribly interested in providing what many think of as a
social good, that of highlighting black as well as
white performers. MTV errs in its assumption that
young white people will only appreciate a mix of
heavy metal and flashy new wave. With its rotation
system, MTV' could play more funk and get away
with it; in fact it would probably enlarge its audi
ence, and soon we could see Midwesterners
hippity-hopping their way to high school. Breaking
down traditional racial barriers in music, much like
Elvis Presley did when he introduced "black" music
to American teenagers, is not incongruous with
MTV's principal aim of making money.
MTV's main accomplishment has been to bolster
the music industry by giving increased exposure to
both new and established performers. Few consu
mers are willing to spend $7 to $8 on an album they
have never heard. MTV's effect on record sales is
clear and can be expected to increase as more areas
acquire cable. The appeal of Music Television lies in
its seductive mindlessness; it furnishes a constant
supply of escapism in a world where demand is
high.
NOTES: Bonnie Hayes and the Wild Combo have
developed a cult following at Stanford, as evidenced
by their well-received show last Saturday at the
Keystone Palo Alto. The Combo has added a new
keyboard player, which enables Bonnie to strut
more often. They will return to the Keystone in late
November . . . Romeo Void headlines a Halloween

Titillating the youth culture and changing the way
the music industry operates, Music Television, or
MTV, plays videoclips by rock bands 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. Provided as a basic cable service,
as opposed to pay-TV programs like HBO or
Showtime, MTV has entered the homes of 15 million
Americans, thus spurring record sales and creating
an industry out of thin air and technology.
Owned by corporate spouses Warner Brothers
and American Express, MTV is a typically well-run
capitalist enterprise that curiously has yet to turn a
profit. It targets the 14-34 age group, and its basic
aim is to keep these youth glued to the blue glow of
their Trinitrons. Since MTV relies solely on advertis
ing as its revenue source, its profitability depends
on its market penetration and its appeal to a high
percentage of its target audience.
Toward this end MTV has created a fantasy world
accessible via the nearest cable-ready TV set. Clever
promotions, including a contest in which the winner
is whisked off by jet to see and meet the Police, and
the presence of perpetually exuberant "video jock
eys" attest to the astuteness of MTV's promoters.
Even more important to MTV's rise in the music
business has been its format which combines hard
rock with marketable new wave. Trying to strike a
balance between America's heavy metal fans —who
have been weaned on a steady diet of AC/DC, Jour
ney, and Loverboy — and new wave veterans — who
have graduated from the Sex Pistols to Spandau Bal
let — is a delicate task.
MTV caters to both worlds; scantily-clad models
in American-made videos target the young male
libido, while English videos feature artists trying to
charm America's new progressive set.
MTV's very simple weapon, the frequency of song
rotation, attempts to reconcile the tastes of these
two audiences. Radio programmers have long
known that if they play a given song often enough,
they can create a market for that song. Programmers

influence tastes by placing a song in light, medium,
or heavy rotation. Familiarity in this case breeds af
finity. Billy Idol is thus seen as tolerable strangeness
to the average Def Leppard fan.
Major rock radio stations are so risk-averse in their
programming that they probably never considered
giving Men At Work's debut LP any airplay. MTV'
recognized the group's commercial potential and in
troduced them to U.S. viewers, thereby launching
the Australians' careers.
The correlation between MTV video play and
record sales is well documented. A high quality
videoclip is becoming a prerequisite to commercial
success. Clips are shown on more than 100 music
video television shows, and many nightclubs now
feature dancing to video.
The video phenomenon has given unknown
performers another avenue toward recognition by
record companies. A group which makes and
finances a good independent video gives a record
company an added incentive to sign the band, since
they already have a finished product.
