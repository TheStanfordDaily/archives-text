# Rumble Fish': Coppola tries and misses yet again
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
J lis is the kind of season that makes a
critic nervous. By the end of the year,
Dst all of the most gifted directors
king in America today will have released
ies — Robert Altman, Francis Ford Cop
, Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Irvin
hner, Carroll Ballard, Philip Kaufman,
)dy Allen, Steven Spielberg, Bob Fosse,
s Malle, Sam Peckinpah — and yet at
moment, before we've seen The Right
112, Never Cry Wolf, Streamers, Star 80,
Scarface or The Ostermann
Weekend, American movies are in a dis-
Hiting slump.
Bs|he best of our pictures this year have
been — with the exception of George
' Kllerenberg's Say Amen, Somebody — light
f|re (Zelig, Superman 111, Never Say Never
the first two-thirds of War Games).
Arid two of the most audacious gamblers
We have, Coppola and Scorsese, have been
• taking the sorts of chances bound to land
|lhem in blind alleys. When you make a
jflfiovie like The King of Comedy, which is
insulated, with characters who
Behave in creepy, unexplained ways and a
denouement fueled by anger we can't un
derstand and pointed peculiarly inward; or
The Outsiders and the new Rumble Fish,
Which are stylistically insulated — then
you've abandoned your audience.
j' s We can't respond to these films, except
fo admire their technique (and I didn't
dtimire anything about The King of Comedy
except for jerry Lewis' performance), be
cause we're denied a point of entry to
them; they might have been shot on an
6ther planet.
jr When Francis Coppola turned to
S.E.Hinton's adolescent fiction for film ma
terial, some of us hoped that the sympa
i thetic, down-to-earth subject — the prob
lem of growing up tough — might lead him
back out of the jungle he'd gotten lost in
during Apocalypse Now. His Las Vegas mu
sical, One from the Heart, seemed aimed at
an audience of one or two dozen cinephiles
• who wanted to applaud the reverential gaze
at a younger Hollywood and write paeans
on Coppola's style for magazines like Sight
and Sound, while the rest of us stared in
disbelief that turned into depression long
before the end of the movie. (The One from
the Heart enthusiasts must have squealed
with delight when they saw The Moon in
the Gutter.)
But The Outsiders, which should have
been made on a small scale, was impossibly
grandiose and glittering, and it presented a
[ 'Father Knows Best vision of teenage life:
• The golden sunsets and that honeyed
theme song by Stevie Wonder stuck to your
teeth when you left the theater. Rumble
Fish, which Coppola himself had a hand in

writing (along with S.E.Hinton), eschews
this softness for something grittier and
more obscene, played by a cast of expert
young actors who've all proven themselves
in other pictures. But Coppola and his
photographer, Stephen Burum, have made
it in a style so obtrusively self-conscious
that everyone's trapped in it, including the
audience.
Remember the dream clouds in The Ele
phant Man ? All of Rumble Fish looks like that
— we never get to wake up in this movie.
Burum laid his black and white photogra
phy on with a trowel: It's so film noir that
the Xanadu scenes in Citizen Kane look
naturalistic in comparison. Steam erupts
from every corner, street signs seem to
float in space, and the camera looms so
close to faces that they distort and age.
(Diane Lane, who plays Patty, the young
hero's girl friend, looks weathered here,
and at one point I started to count the pock
marks on Mickey Rourke's face.)
When Patty and Rusty james (Matt Dillon)
make love, the camera fixes on an antique
timepiece on Patty's shelf; later, the
proprietor of the local pool hall (Tom Waits,
who wrote and performed the songs in One
from the Heart), shot from above, delivers a
metaphysical monologue on time, and then
to reinforce this theme, Coppola poses the
two brothers, Dillon and Rouke, against a
huge clock with no hands that is on the side
of a truck.
Doesn't this sound like a film student's
parody of Ingmar Bergman? Rusty James is
always called by both his names, like Rusty
Charlie and Harry the Horse in Guys and
Dolls, and Mickey Rourke plays a mythic
character who goes by the moniker "The
Motorcycle Boy." (He's the worn-out, enig
matic spirit of old gang wars, just as Nastas
sia Kinski was the spirit of Las Vegas in One
from the Heart.) And I haven't told you the
most outrageous stroke of all: Whenever
we see the "rumble fish" of the title — fish
supposedly made hostile by their alien,
caged environment, clearly intended to
symbolize the plight of the two brothers —
they're in bright, shining red and blue,
swimming in the middle of a black and
white frame.
Rumble Fish must be one of the craziest
movies ever made commercially in this
country. You'd never guess that Coppola
was trying to make a movie about anything
as accessible as frustrated adolescents or
restless young nomads. He's so in love with
his own dumb metaphors and his own
amazing technical skills that they take over
the film. Yet only one scene resonated in
my head afterwards — a gang fight in the
subway. And there were only a few mo
ments I honestly enjoyed: a bit in which a
hooker (S.E.Hinton, in a walk-on) picks up

Rusty James' pal Steve (Vincent Spano, of
Baby It's You) in one corner of the screen,
while we're supposed to be paying atten
tion to a dialogue between Rusty James and
his brother; and the way Matt Dillon jumps
when he's fooling around with a local girl
and someone tells him Patty's just walked
into the room.
The charisma and imagination of the
three central performers can't successfully
combat the approach Coppola, at one time
the premier actor's director in the country,
has taken to them: He lets them act and act,
never imposing any controls, until finally
they become excessive, narcissistic. This is
especially true of Matt Dillon (the saving
grace of some parts of The Outsiders), who
falls into a peculiarly Methody angst —
peculiar for an actor whose intuition so
rarely fails him.

Mickey Rourke, whose gracefully
weighted presence suggests the Brando of
The Men and On the Waterfront, at least
holds himself in check when the script
doesn't call for him to deliver bons mots
like "California is like a beautiful wild girl
on heroin."
Rumble Fish has a large cast and crew,
and you get the feeling that all of them were
working at full heat — the composer,
Stewart Copeland, the editor, Barry Malkin,
the production designer, Dean Tavoularis,
San Francisco Ballet's Michael Smuin, who
supervised the "special choreography" (in
the gang fight, presumably). But all their
energy pours into the center of this weird,
remote oeuvre and we don't understand it
or want to watch it.
Nicolas Cage, who plays Smokey, the guy

who's after Rusty lames' girl, looks wonder
ful and his acting is crisp and committed,
but in last spring's junky, enjoyable Valley
Girl he had one scene —driving down Hol
lywood Boulevard and yelling greetings to
his friends — that, for sheer joie de vivre,
eclipses anything he does here. And, as the
boys' alcoholic father and The Motorcycle
Boy's dope-addicted girl friend, Dennis
Hopper and Diana Scarvvid give classic bad
performances — the kind that ramble and
drift out toward some fixed point in space,
so that it looks like they're acting for a mir
ror.
These two communicate no recognizable
human emotions, in a movie that takes
place on no recognizable spot on earth.
The credits list a "student observer," but I
can't imagine what she could have been ob
serving.

Arid two of the most audacious gamblers
We have, Coppola and Scorsese, have been
• taking the sorts of chances bound to land
|lhem in blind alleys. When you make a
jflfiovie like The King of Comedy, which is
insulated, with characters who
Behave in creepy, unexplained ways and a
denouement fueled by anger we can't un
derstand and pointed peculiarly inward; or
The Outsiders and the new Rumble Fish,
Which are stylistically insulated — then
you've abandoned your audience.
j' s We can't respond to these films, except
fo admire their technique (and I didn't
dtimire anything about The King of Comedy
except for jerry Lewis' performance), be
cause we're denied a point of entry to
them; they might have been shot on an
6ther planet.
jr When Francis Coppola turned to
S.E.Hinton's adolescent fiction for film ma
terial, some of us hoped that the sympa
i thetic, down-to-earth subject — the prob
lem of growing up tough — might lead him
back out of the jungle he'd gotten lost in
during Apocalypse Now. His Las Vegas mu
sical, One from the Heart, seemed aimed at
an audience of one or two dozen cinephiles
• who wanted to applaud the reverential gaze
at a younger Hollywood and write paeans
on Coppola's style for magazines like Sight
and Sound, while the rest of us stared in
disbelief that turned into depression long
before the end of the movie. (The One from
the Heart enthusiasts must have squealed
with delight when they saw The Moon in
the Gutter.)
But The Outsiders, which should have
been made on a small scale, was impossibly
grandiose and glittering, and it presented a
[ 'Father Knows Best vision of teenage life:
• The golden sunsets and that honeyed
theme song by Stevie Wonder stuck to your
teeth when you left the theater. Rumble
Fish, which Coppola himself had a hand in

writing (along with S.E.Hinton), eschews
this softness for something grittier and
more obscene, played by a cast of expert
young actors who've all proven themselves
in other pictures. But Coppola and his
photographer, Stephen Burum, have made
it in a style so obtrusively self-conscious
that everyone's trapped in it, including the
audience.
Remember the dream clouds in The Ele
phant Man ? All of Rumble Fish looks like that
— we never get to wake up in this movie.
Burum laid his black and white photogra
phy on with a trowel: It's so film noir that
the Xanadu scenes in Citizen Kane look
naturalistic in comparison. Steam erupts
from every corner, street signs seem to
float in space, and the camera looms so
close to faces that they distort and age.
(Diane Lane, who plays Patty, the young
hero's girl friend, looks weathered here,
and at one point I started to count the pock
marks on Mickey Rourke's face.)
When Patty and Rusty james (Matt Dillon)
make love, the camera fixes on an antique
timepiece on Patty's shelf; later, the
proprietor of the local pool hall (Tom Waits,
who wrote and performed the songs in One
from the Heart), shot from above, delivers a
metaphysical monologue on time, and then
to reinforce this theme, Coppola poses the
two brothers, Dillon and Rouke, against a
huge clock with no hands that is on the side
of a truck.
Doesn't this sound like a film student's
parody of Ingmar Bergman? Rusty James is
always called by both his names, like Rusty
Charlie and Harry the Horse in Guys and
Dolls, and Mickey Rourke plays a mythic
character who goes by the moniker "The
Motorcycle Boy." (He's the worn-out, enig
matic spirit of old gang wars, just as Nastas
sia Kinski was the spirit of Las Vegas in One
from the Heart.) And I haven't told you the
most outrageous stroke of all: Whenever
we see the "rumble fish" of the title — fish
supposedly made hostile by their alien,
caged environment, clearly intended to
symbolize the plight of the two brothers —
they're in bright, shining red and blue,
swimming in the middle of a black and
white frame.
Rumble Fish must be one of the craziest
movies ever made commercially in this
country. You'd never guess that Coppola
was trying to make a movie about anything
as accessible as frustrated adolescents or
restless young nomads. He's so in love with
his own dumb metaphors and his own
amazing technical skills that they take over
the film. Yet only one scene resonated in
my head afterwards — a gang fight in the
subway. And there were only a few mo
ments I honestly enjoyed: a bit in which a
hooker (S.E.Hinton, in a walk-on) picks up

Rusty James' pal Steve (Vincent Spano, of
Baby It's You) in one corner of the screen,
while we're supposed to be paying atten
tion to a dialogue between Rusty James and
his brother; and the way Matt Dillon jumps
when he's fooling around with a local girl
and someone tells him Patty's just walked
into the room.
The charisma and imagination of the
three central performers can't successfully
combat the approach Coppola, at one time
the premier actor's director in the country,
has taken to them: He lets them act and act,
never imposing any controls, until finally
they become excessive, narcissistic. This is
especially true of Matt Dillon (the saving
grace of some parts of The Outsiders), who
falls into a peculiarly Methody angst —
peculiar for an actor whose intuition so
rarely fails him.

Mickey Rourke, whose gracefully
weighted presence suggests the Brando of
The Men and On the Waterfront, at least
holds himself in check when the script
doesn't call for him to deliver bons mots
like "California is like a beautiful wild girl
on heroin."
Rumble Fish has a large cast and crew,
and you get the feeling that all of them were
working at full heat — the composer,
Stewart Copeland, the editor, Barry Malkin,
the production designer, Dean Tavoularis,
San Francisco Ballet's Michael Smuin, who
supervised the "special choreography" (in
the gang fight, presumably). But all their
energy pours into the center of this weird,
remote oeuvre and we don't understand it
or want to watch it.
Nicolas Cage, who plays Smokey, the guy

who's after Rusty lames' girl, looks wonder
ful and his acting is crisp and committed,
but in last spring's junky, enjoyable Valley
Girl he had one scene —driving down Hol
lywood Boulevard and yelling greetings to
his friends — that, for sheer joie de vivre,
eclipses anything he does here. And, as the
boys' alcoholic father and The Motorcycle
Boy's dope-addicted girl friend, Dennis
Hopper and Diana Scarvvid give classic bad

who's after Rusty lames' girl, looks wonder
ful and his acting is crisp and committed,
but in last spring's junky, enjoyable Valley
Girl he had one scene —driving down Hol
lywood Boulevard and yelling greetings to
his friends — that, for sheer joie de vivre,
eclipses anything he does here. And, as the
boys' alcoholic father and The Motorcycle
Boy's dope-addicted girl friend, Dennis
Hopper and Diana Scarvvid give classic bad
performances — the kind that ramble and
drift out toward some fixed point in space,
so that it looks like they're acting for a mir
ror.
These two communicate no recognizable
human emotions, in a movie that takes
place on no recognizable spot on earth.
The credits list a "student observer," but I
can't imagine what she could have been ob
serving.
