191 found dead in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — The number of U.S. Marines
killed in the terrorist bombing of their base here
reached 191 yesterday as the United States sharply
increased security at its peace-keeping facilities
newr the Beirut Airport and awaited the arrival of
new forces being flown in to replace those killed
and wounded.
As rescue workers continued to dig more bodies
from the rubble of the collapsed Marine building,
French President Francois Mitterand made a surprise
visit to France's contingent in the multinational
peace-keeping force here, which lost at least 23 sol
diers in a similar bombing minutes after the explo-

sion at the U.S. hose Sunday morning.
Mitterrand, who toured the sites of the two bom
bings and met with Lebanese President Anun
Gemayel and other senior officials during his seven
hour stay, made no public comment before return
ing to Paris last night aboard a French military plane.
Back in Paris, he pledged that French troops would
remain in Lebanon despite the heavy casualties.
U.S. military officials said 191 Marines have now
been confirmed dead, including two who died of in
juries while being evacuated to hospitals. But it v\as
feared that another 50 may be buried under tons of
rubble in the collapsed battalion landing team
headquarters.
So far, 75 wounded Marines, several of them in
critical condition, have been flown out of Lebanon
to U.S. military hospitals in Europe.
The death toll is the highest the U.S. military has
suffered on a single day since the Vietnam war, and
on only two days in that war were more Americans
killed. On Jan. 31, 1968, in the Tet offensive, 246 U.S.
servicemen died and 208 were killed on Feb. 23,
1969.
As the enormity of the bombings became clearer
rescue workers continued efforts to remove
debris and bodies from the devastated sites.
Efforts to convene a national reconciliation con
ference of Lebanon's warring religious and political
factions moved forward with signs that the meeting
might begin as scheduled in Switzerland next Mon
day.
The replacements for the killed and wounded
Marines were being flown into Beirut from Camp
Lejeune, N.C., by way of Frankfurt in three C-141
transport planes, Marine officials said.
Marines will stay in Beirut
Washington — Reagan declared yesterday that the
United States has "vital interests" in Lebanon and
implied that the Soviet Union and its surrogates
would swiftly fill the vacuum if U.S. Marines were
withdrawn from the multinational peace-keeping
force there.
Reaffirming his commitment to keep U.S. troops
in Lebanon despite the terrorist suicide bombing
that killed 191 Marines in their Beirut Airport com
pound. Reagan said a continued American presence

there "is central toourcredibility on a global scale."
"It would be a disaster if a force took over the
Middle East, and a force is now ready to do that, as
witness what has taken place in Yemen, in Ethiopia
. . . and Syria," Reagan said, in a clear reference to
the Soviet Union.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who is to travel
to Europe later this week to meet foreign ministers
of France, Italy and Britain — the other three partici
pants in the multinational force — was even more
explicit.
"If we are driven out of Lebanon, radical and
rejectionist elements will have scored a major vic
tory," Shultz told senators and congressmen in
briefings on Capitol Hill. "The message will be sent
that relying on the Soviet Union pays off and that
relying on the United States is a fatal mistake."
Despite Reagan's determination to keep U.S.
troops in Lebanon, officials close to him said he was
"shattered" by the magnitude of Marine casualties,
the worst for an American force in a single day since
the most intense fighting in Vietnam.
"We're all frustrated by the fact these terrorists
can hit and run and disappear into the society and
you can't do anything about it. The president was an
unhappy and tired man Sunday night."
The administration suspects that a radical fringe
group with ties to Iran carried out the bombing at
tack. Shultz said, "Iranian elements in Lebanon
operate from behind Syrian lines and are allied with
Syria . . . Syria must bear a share of the responsibil
ity for any Iranian actions in Lebanon, whether or
not Syria knew of any specific terrorist plans."
Shultz also criticized the Soviets for encouraging
Syria and contributing to "the climate of violence
and intimidation" in Lebanon.

Congress divided on Lebanon
Washington — The bombings of the Marine
bivouac in Beirut reignited national congressional
debate yesterday and deepened an already bitter
division over whether members should support
President Reagan's call to remain in strife-torn
Lebanon or move to pull U.S. troops out.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill, (D-Mass),
hoping to stave oft a possible revolt in the Demo
cratic controlled House, said a pullout would be
"the worst possible thing we could do . . . it would
be victory for our adversaries, particularly Russia
and Syria, which is acting as a satellite for the Rus
sians."
O'Neill called for members of his party to be
"Americans first and Democrats second," and said,
"if we run, (similar incidents) will happen in all our
embassies in various parts of the world."
But Rep. Clarence Long (D-Md) said he planned to
move for a cutoff of funds for the Lebanese opera
tion when the Department of Defense's appropria
tions bill for the current fiscal year come before the
House this week. He criticized O'Neill's stand,
saying Democrats should ask their leadership,
"whom are they working for? Are they working for
the Democrats or the Republicans."
A handful of House members, led by Rep. Lane
Evans (D-lll.) a former Marine, announced they were
introducing a resolution calling for "prompt and or
derly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon," ex
cept for personnel assigned as guards at the U.S.
Embassy there.

dustrials rose .21 points to 1249.08 at yesterday's

ly late Friday also triggered a rise in interest rates
both Friday and yesterday.
