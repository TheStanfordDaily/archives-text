In response to student requests,
Meyer Undergraduate Library will
be open until 11 p.m. on weekend
nights beginning Friday, according
to Elizabeth Salzer, head librarian.
Salzer said the library made the
decision based on responses to a
recent questionnaire on library
services.
Of the 200 students who
responded to the questionnaire, the
majority said they felt Meyer should
remain open until at least 10 p.m. on
both Fridays and Saturdays. Some
indicated they favored closing at 11
p.m. or midnight.
The library's weekend hours were
reduced this year after a student
committee recommended that the
library extend its hours during dead
week and finals week. This would
entail a total of about 14 additional
hours of operation at the end of the
quarter. To make up for the extra
hours, the library administration
decided to close Meyer at 10 p.m.
on Fridays and 6 p.m. on Saturdays.
Meyer previously was open until
midnight seven days a week.
Salzer said the library will still
keep extended hours during dead
week and finals week.

Students planned a sit-in Oct. 15
that was cancelled after library
spokespersons said the library
would increase its weekend hours.
The library did not specify then how
much the library hours would be ex
tended.
Salzer said a primary reason for
reducing the weekend hours was
that those students who go to the li
brary on Friday and Saturday nights
primarily study and do not utilize
Meyer's services or check out
books.
"I had said from the beginning
that it would be possible to change
the hours of the library," Salzer
said, adding that, "We will be moni
toring the amount of use of the li
brary during the new hours."
Salzer also said Meyer will be
hiring students to work during the
additional hours of operation. She
did not specify, however, the num
ber of students needed.
In the future, decisions regarding
services at Meyer will be made by
the proposed subcommittee of the
Academic Council Committee on Li
braries. Although the committee ha<-
been authorized, no appointment
have been made yet. The library ad
ministration has recommended tha
six to eight students be on the com
mittee.
