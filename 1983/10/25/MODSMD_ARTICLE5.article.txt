# New energy system to save $200,000

### JERRY BALL Staff writer 
The University has earned a
$110,000 rebate from the Pacific Gas
and Electric Company for the instal
lation of a new Energy Management
and Control System (EMCS) on
campus, according to a company
spokesman.
Peter Skinner, a Pacific Gas and
Electic representative, said the
rebate is part of the utility compa
ny's Customized Energy Manage
ment Incentives (CEMI) program
and is designed "as an incentive to
get the customer to reduce his
demands on the system."
The $1.1 million EMCS will replace
the existing Honeywell/IBM system,
which officials say has become
outdated and is difficult to maintain.

The new EMCS will consist of a com
puter located in the Central Energy
Facility that will be linked to a net
work of microprocessor-based units
distributed throughout the campus.
Skinner said the new EMCS sys
tem should save Stanford more than
2.5 million kilowatt-hours per year
â€” nearly $200,000 at today's prices
by allowing the University to
implement more sophisticated ener
gy management strategies than are
now utilized. He added that the sys
tem will "monitor and operate
building equipment such as fans,
pumps and valves" and predicted an
additional $50,000 savings from the
EMCS's regulation of "steam and
chilled water use."
Members of the Utilities Systems
Department have "no idea" what to
do with the old computer system.
Skinner called it "so obsolete that it
really doesn't have any surplus
value."
Representatives submitted an ap
plication for the rebate in late Au
gust and have now received an ac
ceptance letter, Skinner said. Stan
ford's $1.1 million EMCS project
qualified for a $100,000 rebate, the
maximum amount offered under the
program, plus a $10,000 bonus for
submitting the application early.
The University will receive 30 per
cent of this rebate when the project
is initiated and the remainder upon
completion in late 1984.
