# Former Rep. Anderson to speak on formation of new party for 1984
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Former congressman and
presidential candidate John Ander
son will speak three times on
campus tomorrow as part of his
campaign to form a National Unity
Party in another possible presiden
tial bid.
Anderson, who ran lor president
in 1980 and was a guest professor
here in the spring of 1981, told The
Daily in an interview yesterday from
a Chicago hotel that the National
Unity Party will be a "broader, more
cohesive coalition" than the two es
tablished parties.
The former Republican represen
tative from Illinois said the "issue of
war and peace" is the crucial ele
ment of the 1984 campaign. He
blasted the Reagan administration's
defense policy, which he claims is
leading to a "resumption of the
Cold War."
The defense budget could be cut
by at least 25 percent, he added,
without jeopardizing our national
security."
Anderson will speak tomorrow at
3 p.m. at the Delta Upsilon house, at
4:30 p.m. in Branner Hall lounge
and at 8 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
Although he would not explicitly
say he would run in 1984, Anderson
left few doubts as to his intentions.
He said he is coming to California
"to see what the possibilities (are)
for getting a new party on the 1984
ballot."
Calling U.S. policy in strife-torn
C.entral America "an egregious
mistake," Anderson said more at
tention must be paid to otters of a
regional settlement, such as
negotiations proposed by the so
called Contadora group of nations.
Anderson said he fears the admin
istration 'is paying lip service" to
regional proposals such as those ot
tered by the Contadora group and

instead favors a return to an era of
gunboat diplomacy.
He also cited Lebanon as another
area in which an "incorrect" admin
istration policy was in force. He pro
posed that the United Nations
create a standby force to deal with
such situations, especially in the
wake of Sunday's explosions in
Beirut which killed at least 191 U.S.
Marines and 23 French members of
the multinational peacekeeping
force.
Anderson further criticized Presi
dent Reagan's fiscal and monetary
policies, which he charged "are not
addressing the basic economic
needs of the economy as we
should."
To promote a real recovery — he
called the current economic upturn
"not the kind of lasting recovery the
nation needs" — Anderson sugges
ted that public enterprise com
panies be formed. These companies
would hire the long-term un
employed, whom he said are not "in
the current agenda" of policy al
ternatives.
He said he would also reduce the
military budget and eliminate trom
the tax code "the S3 billion in

credits and exemptions .. .
available to the powerful and af
fluent."
Anderson spared no criticism tor
either the Republican or Democratic
parties. He said the "parties are al
most captured by PACs (political ac -
tion committees)" and have conse
quently "lost the position or role
they should have."
It was for this reason, he stressed,
that Americans "desperately need a
new party."
Anderson denounced charges
that his proposals closely resemble
those of Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), a
candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
"Mr. Hart believes that under the
old party system one can navigate
on a different course in reconstruct
ing a different world," he said, ad
ding that this is impossible because
"the party itself is controlled by an
interlocking directorate of vested in
terests."
If Hart were elected, Anderson
predicted that "he would be locked
into an existing two-party system
that has produced a succession of
failed presidencies."
