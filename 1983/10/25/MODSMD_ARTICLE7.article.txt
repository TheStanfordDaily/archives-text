## Brain tells doctors what baby can't 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Due to advances in intant in
tensive care, premature
babies have a far better
chance of surviving than they
did a decade ago. However,
many "premies" suffer brain
injuries, caused by asphyxia or
cerebral hemorrhaging, that
may not be noticed until it is
too late for treatment.
Dr. Barry Tharp, a re
searcher at the Medical Center
and associate professor of
neurology here, claims to
have discovered a way to mea
sure the extent of neurological
damage and detect epileptic
seizures in premies. Accor
ding to Tharp, using an EEC
(electroencephalograph) to
monitor the brain waves of in
fants can give physicians a
vivid picture of the activities of
the infant's brain.
Tharp and his research asso
ciate, Robert Clancy of the
Philadelphia Children's Hospi
tal, did a retrospective study
of 44 infants. All subjects were
born seven to eight weeks
prematurely and suffered a
brain hemorrhage, internal
bleeding in the brain's
ventricles which puts pressure
on the brain's cerebral cortex
by compressing it against the
unyielding skull.
Noting that some of the in
fants were normal at age two,
while some showed signs of
cerebral palsy, Tharp checked
to see if there was anything

significant in the diseased
children's medical records.
He found a correlation be
tween EEGs, which were given
to determine the nature and
extent of brain hemorrhaging,
and the infants' neurological
development.
"All 2i infants who demon
strated one or more markedly
abnormal EECs had an un
favorable outcome," the
scientists reported. Of those,
20 died and the three remain
ing had measurable brain
damage.
Tharp explained that EEGs
are usually given only to
patients suspected of having a
neurological problem, and
they are not part of an in
tensive care nursery's routine
monitoring. After studying
brain-hemorrhaged infants
who would routinely be given
an EEG, Tharp began to study
the EECs of healthy premies,
attempting to establish a
"standard" of normal EEG ac
tivity. So far Tharp has studied
70 infants in the intensive care
nursery and hopes to develop
a standard of EEC activity for
each week of a premie's life.

Besides being an excellent
predictive tool, the EEC has a
more immediate diagnostic
use in neonatal care. Brain
injured infants are prone to
frequent epileptic seizures,
scrambled bursts of electrical
activity in the brain. Because
these infants are also often
paralyzed with drugs such as
curare (once used to tip blow
gun darts) to aid mechanical
respiration, it is hard to see
the muscle spasms which are
the most common method of
observing seizures. By using
the EEC, a physician can tell if
an infant is having a seizure
and determine the frequency
of seizures in a particular pa
tient.
"We think these seizures
may damage a child's brain,"
Tharp said. He explained that
although many epileptics are
not seriously affected by their
seizures, some infants have
hundreds of seizures in a few
days' time, far more fre
quently than a full-grown
epileptic.
Tharp eventually plans to in
stall an EEG monitor in the in
tensive care nursery (the pres

ent one is transported from
the EEG lab). The consent
form explains that he plans to
screen premature infants, and
continuously monitor those
who may be suffering from
seizures.
The EEG is also beginning to
be used to determine how
severely brain-damaged a
premature infant may be. If
the EEG shows the child suf
fers from severe neurological
damage, Tharp said he meets
with the child's parents and
dicusses whether to continue
treatment.
"The EEG is still not the sole
criteria for doing this," Tharp
said. "If we decide it is neces
sary, we'll meet with the par
ents to explain the situation.
No one has asked us to take a
baby off the machines that are
keeping him alive, but if the
child needs major surgery, the
parents might ask that we not
perform the operation."
Tharp explained that he
feels strongly about prolong
ing the life of a child with no
hope of recovery. "There are
attempts at legislation now
that would force doctors to
keep all children alive to the
best of their ability, regardless
of the child's condition,"
Tharp said. "But I don't think
that a child who is severely
brain-damaged should be
allowed to survive."
