# EEG: finding nirvana the fast, electronic way

### ALEX TARC 
For thousands of years Eastern mystics
and yogis have demonstrated amazing con
trols over mind and body. Now, even the
uninitiated can duplicate some of these feats
with the electronic assistance of an
EEC (electroencephalograph) "brain-wave
analyzer."
The EEC machine functions much like a
stereo amplifier system, detecting very small
shifts in electric potential within the brain
with electrodes glued to the surface of the
scalp. The patterns of the brain-waves are
not fully understood, but seem to represent
a continual shift within brain cells from a
positive to a negative charge.
EEGs tremendously amplify the brain's
bioelectric rhythms to drive a row of inked
pens. Each pen, moved by a signal from an
electrode connected to a particular part of
the brain, swings up when the charge is
negative and down when it is positive. As a
continuous sheet of paper slides beneath
the oscillating pens, the up-and-down mo
tion of the pens traces out the subjects
brain-waves.
To aid in analysis, researchers have
catagorized the patterns observed in normal
people during waking and sleeping. Brain
waves are grouped on the basis of speed of

change (frequency) and the amount of
voltage in the the change (amplitude).
A wide-awake person will generate very
low voltage signals and the waves will typi
cally be irregularly shaped and rapidly
changing (high frequency).
As a person relaxes, the chaotic scrawl on
the EEG graph will show a burst of regular
waves somewhere between 8 to 13 cycles
per second and at relatively high voltage.
This rhythm, which is observed on occasion
during sleep and during yoga and Zen medi
tation is called the alpha rhythm.
Brain-waves from the right and left hemi
spheres of the brain sometimes differ and
there is substantial evidence that the two
halves have different functions. The left half
is concerned with verbal, rational and ana
lytic functions and the right with non-verbal,
subjective and emotional matters.
The skilled yogis who learned to master
their autonomic nervous systems hundreds
of years ago in India had no need for
electronic devices. However, for the un
trained person, EEG-assisted relaxation ex
ercises have proven themselves as a helpful
path to self mastery.
Although it takes some practice, EEG
biofeedback has been used as an aid to
sleep, introspection, and reduced blood
pressure and heart disease.
