## Synchronized swimming – a different water sport 
### GEOFF KEITH 
All most people today know
about synchronized swim
ming is what they have seen in
1940s movies with Esther Wil
liams and her sultry back
stroke. Some may have heard
that it is one of the three or
four sports the International

Olympic Committee has cho
sen to feature for the first time
at the 1984 Olympic Games.
But very few realize what a
serious, demanding sport
synchronized swimming has
become in recent years. No
longer does "synchro," as it is
called by its devotees, consist

solely of pretty legs making
pretty patterns in the water.
While those elements are still
there, they consist only a small
part of the physically grueling
moves the swimmers must
execute during their routines.
Synchronized swimming
has often been compared to

figure skating, and on a purely
organizational level this com
parison is a valid one. Every
swimmer must complete a se
ries of compulsory figures, op
tional figures and a four to five
minute routine set to music,
much like in figure skating.
Swimmers compete on three
different skill levels (novice,
junior and senior), and are
judged on both artistic con
tent and execution.
On a physical level, the
sport is compared most often
to gymnastics and ballet.
Swimmers are judged largely
on their body control and
their ability to hold difficult
positions for long periods of
time.
While performing these
maneuvers, however, the
swimmers must .tread water
and hold their breaths for ex
tended periods of time. They
hold their breaths usually for a
minute or so during the most
difficult of their maneuvers
and then, in the words of team
member Sabrina Smith,
"come up and smile as if it
were the easiest thing in the
world."
The maneuvers competitors
must complete are also remi
niscent of gymnastics and bal
let. Compulsory moves for
novices include front and back
walkovers (performed without
touching the sides or the bot
tom of the pool), front pike
somersault, and a move called
a ballet leg. They keep them
selves afloat by using the egg
beater technique, borrowed
from water polo, and propel
themselves along by
"sculling" with their hands.

All this is designed to give
them a look of effortlessness
which couldn't be further
from the truth.
Synchronized swimming at
Stanford is a club sport enter
ing its fifth year of competi
tion. Membership is open to
all students, but only under
graduates are eligible for com
petition.
Although men are as
welcome on the team as wo
men, none ever try out, club
secretary/treasurer Andrea
Wilson said.
The team begins practice at
the start of fall quarter and
competes in the winter. Be
cause synchronized swimming
has not gained widespread
popularity at the college level,
the swimmers attend only a
few meets each year. They
have two dual meets with rival
UC-Berkeley, the East-West
Invitational Tournament at the
University of Arizona, the
Western Regionals (which will
be held here this March) and
the National Championships
at Austin, Texas. Although a
fledgling organization, the
Stanford synchro team placed
fourth and fifth at the Nation
als in 1981 and 1982,
respectively.
The club has 15 members,
about half of whom have had
no previous experience in the
sport. Although these mem
bers are new to the mechanics
of synchronized swimming,
they were all strong swimmers
before joining the team. Many
of them were competitive
swimmers in high school. The
other members of the squad

were all experienced synchro
competitors before they came
to Stanford.
Almost all the athletes who
swim synchro made the transi
tion from straightforward
swimming at some point.
Many became bored with the
unchanging discipline of tradi
tional swimming, and decided
to involve themselves in a
sport where they could un
leash their creative spirits.
"Swimming laps and laps
and laps gets to be a real
drag," said Coach Vickey
Wein a synchro veteran of 13
years.
One of the team's strongest
members is Smith, a senior
from Toronto. She learned to
swim when she was 4-years
old and switched to
synchronized swimming at
age eight. She swam with her
friends during grade and high
school and competed ex
tensively in Canadian ranks.
By her own admission she was
in the pool 40 hours a week,
and her life was "51 percent
synchro, 49 percent school."
As a freshman, she was
good enough to be invited to
tryouts for the U.S. National
team, although she didn't win
a spot. This year will be her
last competitive season in the
collegiate ranks. She admits,
however, that universities
have meets too infrequently
for a swimmer to maintain a
competitive edge.
Wilson, like many team
members, was a competitive
swimmer in high school and
picked up synchronized swim
ming as a freshman here. She

joined the sport because she
got bored with swimming laps
in a pool, even though she en
joys the water. She also likes
the fact that she is able to
meet other girls while keeping
in shape and appreciates the
lack of pressure often associ
ated with other varsity sports.
The only thing Wilson
dislikes about the club, she
said, is having to get up for
6:30 a.m. practice three times
a week.
Interestingly, land drills are
also an integral part of the
team's practice. Not only does
the team do stretching and con
ditioning out of the pool, they
also choreograph and practice
their routines on land to get the
timing down before running
through it in water.
With so much of the routine
going on under water it would
seem difficult for the swim
mers to keep track of their
place in the music, but this
problem is alleviated by the
use of underwater speakers,
which, Wilson said, sound
"really terrific." The condi
tioning part of practice con
sists of weight training, op
tional running, underwater
laps to improve breath
stamina and drills.
Synchronized swimmers
today must combine a number
of qualities to be successful.
They must be strong swim
mers with the athletic ability of
gymnasts, the creativity of fig
ure skaters and the endurance
of water polo players. When
well-done, the sport looks
easy and effortless, but this
impression is nothing but a
carefully cultivated image.

good enough to be invited to
tryouts for the U.S. National
team, although she didn't win
a spot. This year will be her
last competitive season in the
collegiate ranks. She admits,
however, that universities
have meets too infrequently
for a swimmer to maintain a
competitive edge.
Wilson, like many team
members, was a competitive
swimmer in high school and
picked up synchronized swim
ming as a freshman here. She

joined the sport because she
got bored with swimming laps
in a pool, even though she en
joys the water. She also likes
the fact that she is able to
meet other girls while keeping
in shape and appreciates the
lack of pressure often associ
ated with other varsity sports.
The only thing Wilson
dislikes about the club, she
said, is having to get up for
6:30 a.m. practice three times
a week.
Interestingly, land drills are
also an integral part of the
team's practice. Not only does
the team do stretching and con
ditioning out of the pool, they
also choreograph and practice
their routines on land to get the
timing down before running
through it in water.
With so much of the routine
going on under water it would
seem difficult for the swim
mers to keep track of their
place in the music, but this
problem is alleviated by the
use of underwater speakers,
which, Wilson said, sound
"really terrific." The condi
tioning part of practice con
sists of weight training, op
tional running, underwater
laps to improve breath
stamina and drills.
Synchronized swimmers
today must combine a number
of qualities to be successful.
They must be strong swim
mers with the athletic ability of
gymnasts, the creativity of fig
ure skaters and the endurance
of water polo players. When
well-done, the sport looks
easy and effortless, but this
impression is nothing but a
carefully cultivated image.

All most people today know
about synchronized swim
ming is what they have seen in
1940s movies with Esther Wil
liams and her sultry back
stroke. Some may have heard
that it is one of the three or
four sports the International

Olympic Committee has cho
sen to feature for the first time
at the 1984 Olympic Games.
But very few realize what a
serious, demanding sport
synchronized swimming has
become in recent years. No
longer does "synchro," as it is
called by its devotees, consist

solely of pretty legs making
pretty patterns in the water.
While those elements are still
there, they consist only a small
part of the physically grueling
moves the swimmers must
execute during their routines.
Synchronized swimming
has often been compared to

figure skating, and on a purely
organizational level this com
parison is a valid one. Every
swimmer must complete a se
ries of compulsory figures, op
tional figures and a four to five
minute routine set to music,
much like in figure skating.
Swimmers compete on three
different skill levels (novice,
junior and senior), and are
judged on both artistic con
tent and execution.
On a physical level, the
sport is compared most often
to gymnastics and ballet.
Swimmers are judged largely
on their body control and
their ability to hold difficult
positions for long periods of
time.
While performing these
maneuvers, however, the
swimmers must .tread water
and hold their breaths for ex
tended periods of time. They
hold their breaths usually for a
minute or so during the most
difficult of their maneuvers
and then, in the words of team
member Sabrina Smith,
"come up and smile as if it
were the easiest thing in the
world."
The maneuvers competitors
must complete are also remi
niscent of gymnastics and bal
let. Compulsory moves for
novices include front and back
walkovers (performed without
touching the sides or the bot
tom of the pool), front pike
somersault, and a move called
a ballet leg. They keep them
selves afloat by using the egg
beater technique, borrowed
from water polo, and propel
themselves along by
"sculling" with their hands.

All this is designed to give
them a look of effortlessness
which couldn't be further
from the truth.
Synchronized swimming at
Stanford is a club sport enter
ing its fifth year of competi
tion. Membership is open to
all students, but only under
graduates are eligible for com
petition.
Although men are as
welcome on the team as wo
men, none ever try out, club
secretary/treasurer Andrea
Wilson said.
The team begins practice at
the start of fall quarter and
competes in the winter. Be
cause synchronized swimming
has not gained widespread
popularity at the college level,
the swimmers attend only a
few meets each year. They
have two dual meets with rival
UC-Berkeley, the East-West
Invitational Tournament at the
University of Arizona, the
Western Regionals (which will
be held here this March) and
the National Championships
at Austin, Texas. Although a
fledgling organization, the
Stanford synchro team placed
fourth and fifth at the Nation
als in 1981 and 1982,
respectively.
The club has 15 members,
about half of whom have had
no previous experience in the
sport. Although these mem
bers are new to the mechanics
of synchronized swimming,
they were all strong swimmers
before joining the team. Many
of them were competitive
swimmers in high school. The
other members of the squad

were all experienced synchro
competitors before they came
to Stanford.
Almost all the athletes who
swim synchro made the transi
tion from straightforward
swimming at some point.
Many became bored with the
unchanging discipline of tradi
tional swimming, and decided
to involve themselves in a
sport where they could un
leash their creative spirits.
"Swimming laps and laps
and laps gets to be a real
drag," said Coach Vickey
Wein a synchro veteran of 13
years.
One of the team's strongest
members is Smith, a senior
from Toronto. She learned to
swim when she was 4-years
old and switched to
synchronized swimming at
age eight. She swam with her
friends during grade and high
school and competed ex
tensively in Canadian ranks.
By her own admission she was
in the pool 40 hours a week,
and her life was "51 percent
synchro, 49 percent school."
As a freshman, she was
good enough to be invited to
tryouts for the U.S. National
team, although she didn't win
a spot. This year will be her
last competitive season in the
collegiate ranks. She admits,
however, that universities
