Wanted: highly motivated
college graduate with love of
both the humanities and
sciences to travel and work on
four continents. Requires fre
quent relocation. Must be
willing to teach, trap wild
animals, compete in interna
tional athletic events, raise a
family, write foreign cor
respondence and do graduate
work at illustrious academic
institutions.
Interested? Madera Resi
dent Fellow Kathie Namphy
can tell you more about this
job opportunity. She
graduated from the University
of Washington in 1956 with
degrees in chemistry and En
glish. Spurred on by her intel
lectual mentor, Washington
professor and poet, Theodore
Koethke, Namphy went to

study humanities at Oxford as
a Fulbright scholar.
She took time out during
her graduate work to compete
with the U.S. track team and
to win a gold medal in the high
jump at the East-West Games
in Moscow in the summer of
1957. Then she found herself
the following year in the
Peruvian jungle, working on a
language analysis project with
the Cashibo Indians.
After completing her studies
at Oxford in Elizabethan
drama, Namphy was off to fol
low in the footsteps of Marco
Polo and Alexander the Great.
Aged 21 and traveling alone,
she drove and walked through
Europe, the Middle East and
Asia and then sailed through
the China Sea with two friends
in a 35-foot yawl before com
ing home across the Pacific in

a ship. There, she worked in
the laundry room to earn her
passage.
Namphy returned to Iran in
1959 and went into business
with two Iranian friends, trap
ping wild animals for
European zoos. She caught
the first pair of onagars —
small wild horses resembling
the zebra — ever delivered
into captivity. During her
travels she supported herself
by contributing articles to the
Journal of the Explorers' Club
and other publications.
From 1963 to 1969, Namphy
taught English literature and
linguistics at the American
University of Beirut in
Lebanon. During the summers
she retraced the missionary
journeys of St. Paul, visiting
the sites of his churches in
Asia Minor. She married in

1965 and two of her four
children were born in Beirut.
Namphy came to Stanford in
1970 as a graduate student in
English literature and
humanities, receiving her
Ph.D. in 1977. She has since
taught courses in literature
and social ethics. In 1980 she
joined the Western Culture
Program as an instructor, and
is currently the assistant coor
dinator of the Great Works
track.
In addition to raising her
four children and a new puppy
named Fiske, she is the Resi
dent Fellow for 84 freshmen in
Madera House.
In 1982, Namphy received
the Dinkelspiel Award for
Outstanding Service to Under
graduate Education. The cita
tion congratulated her on
"persuading six Stanford
Nobel laureates to dine in a
dormitory and argue with
freshmen," and praised her
"for the friendly and coura
geous humanism that allows
her to be simultaneously mot
her of four, teacher of dozens
and counselor to hundreds."
The Daily interviewed
Kathie Namphy about her
work, travel and advising to
students.
Daily: Tell us about your
childhood.
Namphy: My father was a
forest ranger at remote sta
tions in the Pacific Northwest.
We were a very close family
and my parents took a major
role in educating their
children. From my mother, I
learned to love classical
literature, art and music. From
my father, a Vale forester, I

learned botany, geology, zool
ogy and engineering. He was
also my first high jumping
coach.
Daily: What inspired you to
travel?
Namphy: I had from child
hood a desire to experience
other cultures firsthand.
Growing up in the isolation of
Cascade Mountain ranger sta
tions, I had lots of time to
read. Books like "Hajji Baba of
Isfahan" and"The Arabian
Nights" sparked my imagina
tion. I read biographies of
Lawrence of Arabia, Alexander
of Macedonia and Paul of
Tarsus. My family's involve
ment in the Christian faith was
also an inspiration for me to
live in, and learn about, the
history and cultures of the
Middle East.
Daily: What have been the
significant changes in your life
since childhood?
Namphy: Many, of course,
but I am fortunate to have had

with my 10-year-old son,
Andre.
Daily: Have students
changed at all in the 13 years
you have been at Stanford?
Namphy: I would say that
now, on the whole, fewer stu
dents see the values in a
humanistic education.
Working with undergraduates
has been very satisfying and
reinforces my belief that the
value-centered inquiry in
herent in a humanities educa
tion is no less important than
the seemingly value-neutral
questions that are central to
the sciences and engineering.
Daily: What about the con
flict students feel between
majoring in a field they enjoy
and majoring in a field Ihey
feel will get them a job?
Namphy: That seems to be a
current problem in our atti
tudes toward education. I
think that undergraduates, es
pecially freshmen, should
avoid feeling pressured to

'Students should choose courses in
subjects they really love. If I were a
Stanford undergraduate I would try to take
courses that I knew would always be
memorable for me/

a lot of consistency in my life.
So much of what was impor
tant and shaping then still has
primacy for me now — mainly
my commitment to my family,
my interest in literature and
arts and my love of the natural
beauty of the Northwest
mountains. I spent last sum
mer hiking in the Cascades

make very rigid long-term
career plans. And, above all,
they should avoid falling into a
feeling of desperation about
choosing a major. It is impor
tant for a student to wait until
she/he is very comfortable
about the choice. Meanwhile
students should choose
courses in subjects they really

love. If I were a Stanford un
dergraduate I would try to
take courses that I knew
would always be memorable
for me.
Daily: How can students
avoid this pressure?
Namphy: By remaining open
to many kinds of experience,
by disabusing themselves of
the notion that a biology or
chemistry major is necessarily
the best major for a pre-med
seeking admission to medical
school. It is simply not true.
Major in what you love. If you
feel pressured to make a deci
sion, take some time out;
stopping out or spending
some time at an overseas
campus is usually time
productively spent.
Daily: Why do you like
working at Stanford?
Namphy: Teaching and
being a resident fellow give
me an opportunity to bring to
gether many of the things
which are important to me —
continuing to think about im
portant humanistic concerns
with a community of in
quirers, and having opportu
nities for a fairly intimate in
volvement in the lives of un
dergraduates. I really enjoy
my jobs.
Daily: Do you have any fur
ther adventures planned?
Namphy: Next summer my
son Andre and I are going to
walk the Pacific Crest trail
from Canada to Mexico. Also,
teaching "Great Works of
Western Culture" and raising
four adolescent children is in
itself an enormous adventure.
