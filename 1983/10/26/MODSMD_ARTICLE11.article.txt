# Medical Center resumes kidney transplants after 12-year halt
## 
### KEVIN CRACRAFT 
After a hiatus of nearly 12 years, Stanford
University Medical Center is resuming its
renal (kidney) transplant program. The Of
fice of Statewide Health Planning and De
velopment approved an application for a
Certificate of Need (CON) last Aug. 19
which allows the Med Center to resume
operations at any time.
To obtain a CON, the Med Center had to
meet the published criteria established by
the Office of Statewide Health Planning and
Development and the Santa Clara Health
System 1 - Agency. Usually, one or both of
these agencies calls for a public hearing.
But, apparently because the Med Cen
ter's application was especially
"meritorious," both agencies granted ap

proval without the hearings, said Rex
Jamison, professor of medicine and chief of
the Med Center's nephrology division.
The Med Center's previous program
lasted from 1965 to 1971. It was discon
tinued "because the transplant surgeon left
the University," according to Mike Good
kind, a Med Center spokesman.
Now, however, there are three compel
ling reasons for resumption of a renal
transplant program.
First, there is a definite need in the Bay
Area. Currently, the only two hospitals in
the area that have renal transplant pro
grams are Pacific Medical Center and the
UC-San Francisco Medical Center, both in
San Francisco. There are over 80 people un
der the age of 50 in Santa Clara County who

need transplants, but there are no pro
grams in the immediate area to provide for
these needs.
Second, the procedure is now more suc
cessful because of new advances in
immuno-suppressive drugs. The greatest
difficulty in transplant operations is tissue
rejection, which occurs when the patient's
antibodies reject and attempt to destroy the
transplanted organ. The key to the success
of the transplant operation, then, is the
suppression of immunity agents. Newly dis
covered drugs have proven more success
ful at limiting the rejection of the "foreign''
tissue.
A third reason for resumption of the
transplant program is to continue research
in immunity suppression and ot the body's

defense mechanisms in general. Although
the renal transplant program is a joint
venture between the Med Center's Depart
ment of Surgery and Department of
Nephrology, others in medicine may also
benefit from advances made in the re
search.
Currently, the Med Center is making
plans to recruit both a transplant surgeon,
whose primary concern will be the opera
tion itself, and a nephrologist, whose re
sponsibilities will lie in the area of pre- and
post-operative patient care.
Once the two positions are tilled, the
program can be resumed. This is likely to
take place "within the year," Jamison said.
There are two types of renal transplant
operations. The first is a transplant from a

live donor, usually a sibling. (A healthy per
son can live with one kidney.) In this opera
tion, the organ is removed from the donor,
then placed in the body of the recipient.
The second type of operation involves a
donor kidney taken from a brain-dead
human. This operation can be more com
plex simply because the organ has to be
preserved for a short time, and often has to
be transported from another part of the
country. In this case, a special pump is used
to bathe the organ in a life-preserving solu
tion.
In order to keep tabs on possible donors
and recipients, SUMC will work with the
Pacific Medical Center and the UCSF Medi
cal Center to compile a computerized list
that all three facilities will share.
