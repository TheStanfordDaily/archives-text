## The 						Stanford Daily Stay in your lane 
### 
It really was one of the better pranks on
campus. A bunch of pledges from the Sigma
Chi fraternity got together one day a few week
ago to direct noon bicycle and pedestrian traf
fic at the busy intersection near the clock
tower. They wore white uniforms and hardhats
and wildly blew whistles at bicyclists who vio
lated traffic rules.
The pledges weren't just demonstrating thr
fact that it's more difficult to wend one's
through that intersection at noon than it is ti
find someone from the School of Education to
run for an ASSU Senate seat. Riding a bicyJ
here can be a harrowing experience, anc i:
you've seen one too many collisions betwee
bike-riders — as we have — you begin to a|
preciate any proffered guidance.
This is why we laud those silly white bike
lanes that popped up all over campus more
than a year ago. While many continue to deride
the system of lanes as "Mem Funnel" and
question both its effectiveness and its aesthetic
value, we wonder.
Perhaps some of these doubts would dis
sipate if the doubters — both bikers and

pedestrians — would actually pay attention to
the lanes. And maybe the aesthetes would
reconsider if faced with results.
The bike lanes do need to be followed even
more strictly. Bikers weave from lane to lane,
tten veering into "pedestrian lanes." No
nanded riders wreak havoc as they confidently
glide and swerve wherever they please.
Pedestrians chat to their friends and wander
aimlessly off track, oblivious to the Raleighs,
and Peugeots whizzing by. People
who are interested in getting from class to class
in one piece — especially on the dangerous
rush hour stretch between Cubberley
Au iitorium and History Corner — need to be
more aware; in the words of a good cop, "Stay
in your lane."
Overall, however, the system is working. A
lot of people actually do follow those silly
white lines.
Thus, the fraternity prank was an appropriate
birthday commemoration for a good idea that
is working well — but could be working splen
didly.
