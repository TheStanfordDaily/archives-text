## More TV sex, less violence 
### 
As any other technological inven
tion, TV can be, and has been, put
to good and bad use. Among the
many people that I've had the plea
sure to meet during my years at
Stanford I've found some kind of
repulsion toward watching TV, and
some valid reasons for it.
There are so many examples of
bad programs. TV may even be
"addictive," to the point where one
can no longer exercise any control
over what one watches. I do not
take these objections too seriously:
Liking wine doesn't mean that one
has to drink bad wine to become an
alcoholic. It's in the nature of life to
make choices.
Clearly there are also excellent
programs. TV makes learning easy
and pleasurable, particularly about
subjects in which one has no previ
ous knowledge. I've learned about
biology, chemistry, history, physics,
astronomy, painting, music and I
don't know how many other things
from the often criticized "box."
In fact, I would even say that I
learned some of these things better
from the TV than from any other
means. After all, the patience, re
sources, expertise and technical
skills that went into the production
of some programs is of such great

magnitude that it's hard to believe
that anything better could be done.
In terms of entertainment, TV can
not be matched. It would be
impossible to have access to the
performances ot opera, ballet and
music, and to see with our own eyes
so many different places and
cultures without this extraordinary
invention.
It remains true that the program
ming in general is quite mediocre.
That's probably only a reflection of
what we, as a society, ask from the
system. On the other hand, TV has
an enormous, and certainly dis
proportionate, role in the education
of society. Then one has to ask
oneself if TV isn't a contributing fac
tor in the mediocratization of
people. The answer is yes, and that
brings me to Ihe thought that made
me write this article.
The public debate about too
much sex and violence on TV has
been going on for years. The main
argument of that debate has been
that watching so many deaths and
sexual insinuations on the screen
leads people to behave violently in
their real lives, that it "educates" us
into crime, or that it makes us indif
ferent to violence.
What I have a difficult time trying

to understand is why should we put
sex and violence under the same
class. After all, we live in the late
part of the 20th century and Freud
has already explained to us that in
fact they are the opposite of one an
other. His explanation is easy to un
derstand. We have in us, two oppo
site forces working against each
other. The forces of death, destruc
tion and violence (those are the bad
ones!) against the forces of love and
eroticism of sex (nothing of which to
be ashamed.)
It's hard to point out when and
how we started to feel embarrassed
about our sexual and sensual char
acters, which are so basic and so in
separable from life itself. It's quite
likely that religion is to blame. The
truly paradoxical thing is that we are
"perfectly happy" watching people
die (in fiction or for real) when we
watch TV, but we are still waiting for
the day when we'll see an explicit
sex scene on a TV program or
movie. Most of the editing that we
"see" is done to Eros, but not to
Thanatos.
I'd like to ask for more sex and
less violence.
