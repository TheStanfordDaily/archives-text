# Clearing up the Ron Lib issue
## 
### 
At tirst both the Meyer Library controversy and the
Reagan center conflict seemed to have a simple solu
tion: )ust keep the Reagan librarv open until midnight
on weekends.
Unfortunately, the threat of a library sit-in, which
might have escalated into the first riot consisting mostly
of pre-meds, forced the library to make unilateral con
cessions.
This leaves the Reagan controversy festering on
campus like a big dead fish. Already angry words have
been excha lged. Late night prank phone calls could be
the next step. I feel it my civic duty, as an impartial ob
server, to clear up the confusion surrounding the at
tempts being made to turn Stanford into Reaganland.
The Reagan-O-Rama proposal, much like Gaul, is
divided into three par s. First there is the library itself,
which, if placed here, vill immediately be dubbed Ron
Lib.
Some people, known as "libraritarians," would like
to see this alone be President Reagan's memorial on
campus. Sure, they say, it will glorify the Barry Manilow
of presidents, but think of all the secret stuff we'll get
to look at. To mollify critics, they would have the name
written only on the back of the librarv in very small let
ters.
Others aren't so sure. They fear Stanford will be
stuck with thousands of Reader's Digest condensed
books. Plus maybe Ron's Cliff Notes from college.
Other problems, however, seem to be more impor
tant. Will the chairs there be comfortable enough to
stay awake in? Will the librarians give change for the
copiers? Will it stay open later during Dead Week? It
seems these questions were ignored by the faculty
committee's report on the library.
The library, however, is only the non-alcoholic al
ternative at this party. More debate is raised by the real

grotesqueries of the plan: the Reagan museum an :
policy center.
People argue vehemently about the museum even
about its tentative sight. However, with a little bit ul
creativity, the Reagan museum could he made into
something very worthwhile. The tolks at Disney'dnd
could make us a robot Reagan that would spout sto k
phrases about free enterprise and the commu.
threat. They could make another one for the V\ tt>
House so Reagan could go on vacation without anyone
noticing.
The policy center is the part I don't understand
What's wrong with the Coffee House? You can gei
something to eat there and when it's nice you c an sit
the patio. Maybe they're afraid the video games next
door are too loud.
Some pe >le are worried that Hoover would cont;ol
the policy ' enter. They already control the nation's
policies — why would they want a center to discuss
them? This brings us to the whole Hoover controve s\
a can of worms I will only touch on at one point
It has been said that it's a good thing that we ha\i
Hoover, because it provides diversity sorely la
here, since our professors, as everyone knows.
bunch of bleeding heart liberals
Has it ever occurred to anyone that there might !•> i

Also, professors n hard" sciences are generally
more conservative than those in the humanities and so
cial sciences. It follows, then, that fuzzies are smarter
than techies.
