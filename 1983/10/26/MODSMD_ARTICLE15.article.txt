## Kennedy should reconsider Reagan, Hoover committees 
### 
An open letter to University President
Donald Kennedy:
When I appeared before the advisory
committee that you appointed I argued a
point that I still think is true: 10 years from
now we may have a Reagan complex (and
an expanded Hoover) on this campus, but it
will be a lot better for this University if
those who have doubts and questions now
are given a fair opportunity to be heard —
publicly.
I also believe that if the Stanford commu
nity is given the chance to be heard, most
of its members will comport themselves
responsibly and with dignity. Indeed, if we
follow fair procedures now, 10 years from
now, when we all look back on this debate
and the outcome, we may be able to say:
For all our differences and whatever the
result, we conducted ourselves as members
of an academic community should. This
would represent no small achievement in
the face of the proposals we confront.
There are, of course, many good reasons
for concern over the committee's member
ship, but it should be emphasized that in
calling attention to who is on the commit
tee we also call attention to who is not: no
students, no faculty and no signers of last

spring's petitions for an independent inves
tigation of Hoover's alleged political activi
ties.
The central question for many of us,
then, is not the intention behind the com
mittee but rather the committee's
representativeness (or lack of it). If this
committee is supposed to be in some way
responsive to those students and faculty
who have publicly expressed concern
about the Hoover Institution's alleged poli
tical activities, should not some direct rep
resentation of these concerns be members?
To some people this seems a matter of
elemental fairness. It is just such a consid
eration that seemed to lie behind Board
Chairman William Kimball's initial reaction
to the Faculty Senate vote and the petitions,
when he spoke of establishing a committee
of between five and 20 members that would
be "broadly representative" of the Stanford
community. Following the campus debate
and the Faculty Senate vote he also told the
press that he would like to "see the com
mittee as balanced as possible and
representing several different viewpoints."
He said further that he tould not commit
himself to having students and faculty on
the committee, but added "I'd be

surprised if it didn't" (Peninsula Times
Tribune, July 3; Palo Alto Weekly, July 13).
Given the small size of the trustee com
mittee, which rather limits the extent to
which it can he representative of the hroad
Stanford community, and given what might
be termed its apparent representational im-

I think the trustees have
simply not been responsive
to the full range of concerns
that have been expressed
about Hoover and the
Reagan complex.

balance in Hoover's direction, how can it
be claimed, as you did before the Faculty
Senate, that such a committee is responsive
to the Faculty Senate vote or to the range of
views on Hoover that clearly exists on
campus?
An official committee has much to rec
ommend it when one bears in mind that un
less and until some such vehicle is provid

ed, those members of the Stanford commu
nity who want to speak publicly — and have
a chance to influence the decision-making
process — will in effect be denied a full
voice. When you were asked about thi<;
beiore, you said write the Rosse Commit
tee, whose nine members were assigned to
investigate the proposed Reagan complex.
But the Rosse Committee held only one day
of hearings, and that behind closed doors.
Now that the Rosse Committee has dis
charged its responsibility, the Stanford
community awaits the opportunity to ex
press itself in open hearings and in an offi
cial forum before decisions are made
that many c us feel could damage an insti
tution about which we all care deeply.
These questions, as you know, have been
raised in the Faculty Senate and elsewhere.
Although it is oFviously rare for any mem
ber of the Stanford community publicly to
raise questions about actions by the Board
of Trustees, I think it is true to say — and
should be said — that to date the trustees
have simply not been responsive to the full
range of concerns that have been ex
pressed about Hoover and the Reagan com
plex.
Last spring, when faculty and students

appealed to the Faculty Senate for an inde

I may, of course, be wrong in my readin;
of these events. If the Faclty Senate dot

ask whether or not the senate will stand uf
to the implicit challenge laid down by tht
