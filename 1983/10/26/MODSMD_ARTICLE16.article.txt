Telephone ripoff
I hold that the Pacific Telephone
Company systematically attempts to
exploit many of us at Stanford. To
see how, let us follow a typical
student as he attempts to get a
telephone for his room.
It is registration day. Our student
endures the long line outside
Maples Pavilion to rent a phone.
Like so many of us, he has a tight
budget. He decides beforehand to
rent one of those reliable rotary
phones that have served him so
well in the past. Imagine his
surprise when he discovers that the
phone company has decided not to
stork the rotary model that day.
The phone company representa
tive tells our poor student that the
Touchtone, the phone they cur
rently carry, is a "superior" phone.
It does cost a bit more, but it's
newer, easier for the phone compa
ny to store, and more convenient.
Most importantly, the Touchtone

phone allows all students to get
special services like three-way
calling and call forwarding.
However, our typical student
does not find these reasons com
pelling. As far as he knows, both
the rotary and the Touchtone
phones work equally well for him.
Furthermore, he has absolutely
no need for frills such as three-way
calling (or at least he has no desire
to pay extra for them). Vet the fact
that rotary phones are rented just
about everywhere else except on
the Stanford campus bothers him
the most. Well, he figures, the
Touchtone only costs 55 cents more
monthly to rent, so he agrees to it.
In his eagerness to finally get away
from Maples, he barely hears the
representative mention that the
Touchtone phone requires a special
Touchtone line, which, you
guessed it, costs a nice $1.20 a
month.
