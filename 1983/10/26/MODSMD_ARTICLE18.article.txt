# Nursery school strives to educate students and teachers
## 
### LISA CAPPS 
Among the eight child care
services at Stanford, Bing Nur
sery School stands out as
unique. Indeed, Ladies Home
Journal declared it one of
America's most prestigious
nursery schools.
The school has earned na
tional and international
recognition for its unusual
child care program, which in
cludes centers for teacher
training and educational re

search. Professionals in child
development have come to
Stanford from as far away as
China to tour Bing.
"Bing is world-renowned
not because it is a pressure
filled program geared toward
preparing children for Har
vard. The people at Bing
believe in preserving the
child, in giving the children
space and support," Bing
School Director Carol Young-
Holt said.

Many pieces of research in
child development known
throughout the world have
been and continue to be done
at Bing. One such study, en
titled "Imitation of Film
Mediation of Aggressive
Models," has been referred to
as a classic study on how
viewing violence on film af
fects the behavior of children.
According to Deepa Rai, re
search coordinator, 32 studies
were completed at Bing last

year. While the majority of re
search is done by the Depart
ment of Psychology, she said,
studies have been conducted
through the Departments of
Linguistics, Communication,
Education and Medicine as
well.
Research being done this
year includes a comparison of
the effectiveness of educa
tional computers and educa
tional television programs in
teaching children. Jennifer

Brawer, a communication
major, is conducting this
study.
"Bing is an excellent place
to do all kinds of research with
children," Rai said.
The school was founded in
1949 under the guidance of
Edith Dowley to serve the
families of Stanford students.
"Bing has always been a
center for training and re
search. Its connection with
the University enabled Bing to
come into existence," Dowley
said.
In 1966 Bing moved from its
original location in Menlo Park
to Escondido Road. The land
was donated by Stanford for
Research. The laboratory was
constructed with funds from a
grant given by the National
Science Foundation.
Anna Bing Arnold provided
funding for the remainder of
the building.
Bing and Dowley worked
with architects to create a
beautiful environment, in
doors and out, conducive to
the founders' belief that
"children learn by experienc
ing the world," Young-Holt
said.
According to the school's
philosophy, children can best
gain this experience through
recreation. "Play is a child's
most important function.
Children learn about them
selves, and about the world
through play," Dowley said.
Bing offers a wide variety of
programs for children be

tween the ages of eight
months and five years. The
school consists of 25 profes
sional staff members and ap
proximately 300 children.
Tuition ranges from $250 per
quarter for toddlers who come
for five hours a week, to $1700
per quarter for three- to five-

year-olds who are there nine
hours a day, five days a week.
Bing offers partial financial as
sistance to a small number of
families. But despite the cost,
there is an enormous waiting
list for entrance into the
school.
Bing welcomes parents to

participate in the daily pro
gram. The school also spon
sors lectures and workshops
which are open to the public.
Upcoming speakers and top
ics include Ann Piestrup on
"Computers and the Young,"
and Psychology Prof. Philip
Zimbardo on "The Shy Child."
In addition to educational
programs for parents and
members of the community,
Bing provides a place for Stan
ford students to begin training
for a career in teaching. Be
cause Stanford does not-offer
an undergraduate major in
education, Bing gives students
a much-needed opportunity
to work with children
firsthand.
Formal classes are offered
through the Psychology De
partment, which enables stu
dents to observe and partici
pate in the classroom.
Paraprofessional internships
are offered through the de
partment, and students can
gain internship experience
through human biology
workshops.
Susan Strong, a senior
majoring in child psychology,
is one of 50 students working
at Bing this quarter. She has
been involved in research and
training for three years. "It is a
fantastic opportunity to gain
experience with children. I've
learned more from working
with staff members at Bing
than I have in other classes in
child development at Stan
ford," she said.

Many pieces of research in
child development known
throughout the world have
been and continue to be done
at Bing. One such study, en
titled "Imitation of Film
Mediation of Aggressive
Models," has been referred to
as a classic study on how
viewing violence on film af
fects the behavior of children.
According to Deepa Rai, re
search coordinator, 32 studies
were completed at Bing last

year. While the majority of re
search is done by the Depart
ment of Psychology, she said,
studies have been conducted
through the Departments of
Linguistics, Communication,
Education and Medicine as
well.
Research being done this
year includes a comparison of
the effectiveness of educa
tional computers and educa
tional television programs in
teaching children. Jennifer

Brawer, a communication
major, is conducting this
study.
"Bing is an excellent place
to do all kinds of research with
children," Rai said.
The school was founded in
1949 under the guidance of
Edith Dowley to serve the
families of Stanford students.
"Bing has always been a
center for training and re
search. Its connection with
the University enabled Bing to
come into existence," Dowley
said.
In 1966 Bing moved from its
original location in Menlo Park
to Escondido Road. The land
was donated by Stanford for
Research. The laboratory was
constructed with funds from a
grant given by the National
Science Foundation.
Anna Bing Arnold provided
funding for the remainder of
the building.
Bing and Dowley worked
with architects to create a
beautiful environment, in
doors and out, conducive to
the founders' belief that
"children learn by experienc
ing the world," Young-Holt
said.
According to the school's
philosophy, children can best
gain this experience through
recreation. "Play is a child's
most important function.
Children learn about them
selves, and about the world
through play," Dowley said.
Bing offers a wide variety of
programs for children be

tween the ages of eight
months and five years. The
school consists of 25 profes

In addition to educational
programs for parents and
members of the community,
Bing provides a place for Stan
ford students to begin training
for a career in teaching. Be
cause Stanford does not-offer
an undergraduate major in
education, Bing gives students
a much-needed opportunity
to work with children
firsthand.

Paraprofessional internships
are offered through the de

Susan Strong, a senior
majoring in child psychology,
is one of 50 students working
at Bing this quarter. She has
been involved in research and
training for three years. "It is a
fantastic opportunity to gain
experience with children. I've
learned more from working
with staff members at Bing
than I have in other classes in
child development at Stan
ford," she said.
