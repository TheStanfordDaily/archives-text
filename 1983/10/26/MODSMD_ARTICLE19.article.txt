# Preserving Stanford's buildings can be a moving experience

As the last dabs of paint are applied to
the recently relocated and renovated
Serra House, home of the Center for Re
search on Women (CROW), the ques
tion naturally arises: Why bother?
First Ventura Hall last fall and then Ser
ra this summer have been taken off their
foundations and moved from their
original location near the northwest cor
ner of campus, across Campus Drive
from the Med Center. Serra is now lo
cated behind the Law School, and Ven
tura has moved down the street to the
corner of Campus Drive and Panama
Street.
Why weren't these buildings torn
down and others erected at the new
sites? According to Valerie Veronin, as
sistant to the provost for facilities admin
istration, there are several reasons.
!n the case of Ventura, which was

moved to make way for the new Center
for Integrated Systems, relocating the
building was more economical than
tearing it down and constructing a new
one .The move itself and all its related
costs amounted to $825,000, which is a
significant savings over the estimated $1
million it would have cost to house the
Institute for Mathematical Studies in the
Social Sciences (IMSSS) and the recently
added Center for the Study of Language
and Information (CSLI) in new offices.
Serra had to be moved because it was
too close to energy facilities being built
nearby, and although cost estimates for
moving the building and constructing a
new one were about the same, Serra was
saved from the wrecker's ball largely due
to its historical significance — the house
was originally the home of Stanford's
first president, David Starr lordan.
Altogether, relocating Serra cost the

University $696,000.
Surprisingly, moving the buildings
cost from $90,000 to $100,000 for each
structure, accounting for only a fraction
of the total expenditures. Costs were ap
proximately the same for both. Although
Ventura is much larger than Serra, the
latter has a basement and had to be
moved a greater distance than Ventura,
which posed extra difficulties for the
movers.
Far more expensive than the moves
themselves were the related costs, par
ticularly "code upgrading." Code
upgrading refers to the money that must
be spent to make old buildings meet cur
rent building standards whenever they
undergo any construction. If no con
struction is done, these buildings are not
forced to meet current standards.
While the moves were taking place, in
terim space was found for IMSSS and

CROW in the Old Chemistry Building,
which has not been occupied in years
and had to be renovated before the
groups could move in.
Moving the buildings seems an almost
Herculean undertaking. Each building
was cut into four pieces, jacked up off its
foundation, moved at night to avoid traf
fic problems, and then carefully set
down upon its new foundation. The
moves were so skillfully performed that
it is now impossible to tell where the
buildings were cut.
According to Veronin, no future
moves are planned. Relocating these
buildings was just part of a larger Univer
sity plan to meet the growing need for
building space on campus. The Univer
sity is facing a severe space deficit —
over 100,000 square feet is required to
meet the needs of 30 departments.
This is approximately equal to the

floor space in three buildings the size of
the Math Corner, and this figure does
not include space needed for the Medi
cal School, the Athletics Department or
student residences.
"Our ambitions just exceed our sup
ply," Veronin said.
All the effort that went into the moves
seems to have been worthwhile. The
CROW staff is particularly pleased that
Serra is now close to the heart of
campus, CROW deputy director Marilyn
Yalom said. "Now that we're in this new
location we've gotten more traffic," she
said.
Yalom considers CROW's more visible
presence, along with the recent tenure
of History Prof. Estelle Freedman, a sign
of growing acceptance of the campus
feminist movement by the University.
"We feel as if we've arrived," she said.
