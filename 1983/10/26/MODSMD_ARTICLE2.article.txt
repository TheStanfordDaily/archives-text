# Reagan policy center
## Hoover committee outlines University relationship 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
A Hoover Institution committee
has released a lengthy report
describing in detail the relationship
that would exist between a Ronald
Reagan center for public affairs and
the University if the Hoover-backed
proposal to establish a Reagan
presidential library complex here is
accepted.
The report, made public yester
day, goes to great lengths to defend
the Hoover plan to operate the cen
ter, which has been the focus of
much of the criticism from faculty
and students opposed to the Reagan
complex.
The committee said that it is

"perplexed and dismayed" by those
who feel the public affairs center
would be acceptable if administered
by the provost's office, but unac
ceptable if managed by the Hoover
Institution.
The 21-page report, in the form of
a memorandum to Hoover Director
W. Glenn Campbell, reaffirmed that
the proposed public affairs center
would consist of a first-class confer
ence facility and a program of visit
ing fellows to do research in public
policy issues, and would be
operated by the Hoover Institution.
"The administrator of the center
. . . would be selected by the direc
tor of the Hoover Institution and
then submitted to the president of

Stanford University for approval, as
is the case with other senior admin
istrative appointments in the Institu
tion," the report said.
Fund raising would be
"noncompetitive with the fund
raising activities of either the
Hoover Institution or Stanford Uni
versity," the committee said, and
would be conducted by a private
presidential library foundation,
which would establish and direct
the endowment fund for the public
affairs center, and would not partici
pate in political activites.
