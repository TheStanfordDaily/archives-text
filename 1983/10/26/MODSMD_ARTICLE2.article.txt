# Reagan policy center
## Hoover committee outlines University relationship 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
A Hoover Institution committee
has released a lengthy report
describing in detail the relationship
that would exist between a Ronald
Reagan center for public affairs and
the University if the Hoover-backed
proposal to establish a Reagan
presidential library complex here is
accepted.
The report, made public yester
day, goes to great lengths to defend
the Hoover plan to operate the cen
ter, which has been the focus of
much of the criticism from faculty
and students opposed to the Reagan
complex.
The committee said that it is

"perplexed and dismayed" by those
who feel the public affairs center
would be acceptable if administered
by the provost's office, but unac
ceptable if managed by the Hoover
Institution.
The 21-page report, in the form of
a memorandum to Hoover Director
W. Glenn Campbell, reaffirmed that
the proposed public affairs center
would consist of a first-class confer
ence facility and a program of visit
ing fellows to do research in public
policy issues, and would be
operated by the Hoover Institution.
"The administrator of the center
. . . would be selected by the direc
tor of the Hoover Institution and
then submitted to the president of

Stanford University for approval, as
is the case with other senior admin
istrative appointments in the Institu
tion," the report said.
Fund raising would be
"noncompetitive with the fund
raising activities of either the
Hoover Institution or Stanford Uni
versity," the committee said, and
would be conducted by a private
presidential library foundation,
which would establish and direct
the endowment fund for the public
affairs center, and would not partici
pate in political activites.
The in-house Hoover committee,
headed by Martin Anderson, a
Hoover senior fellow and a former
assistant to President Reagan, has
functioned in recent months as the
architect and advocate of plans to
bring the complex here.
A faculty commmittee advising
University President Donald Ken
nedy on the issue has said that while
a public affairs center would have
great academic value, it should be
"better integrated" within the
governance structure of the Univer
sity. The committee, headed by Eco
nomics Prof, lames Rosse, has rec
ommended that that the center's
governing committee "be ap
pointed by the (University) provost
with substantial faculty member
ship."
Kennedy has yet to comment
publicly on the faculty report, but
the ASSU Senate last night approved
a resolution supporting, in essence,
the Rosse report. A student group
calling itself Stanford Community
Against Reagan University has also
made clear its vehement opposition
to a public affairs center run by
Hoover.
In response, the Anderson com
mittee said that "Hoover has earned
a reputation as one of the leading
research institutions" in the country
and now "seems preeminently
qualified to administer a new center
for public affairs," the report said.

In defending Hoover's proposed
administration of the public affairs
center, the committee went on to
point out that the initiative for the
complex came from Hoover staff
members, who have also done
much of the planning and analysis
for the project and are expected to
devote much of their time and effort
to raising the money necessary to
fund the project.
The center "promises an exten
sive involvement of Stanford faculty
and staff in both the operations of
the conference facility and the visit
ing fellows program," the report
said.
The Hoover committee report
also gave a revised description of
the fund raising necessary to sup
port the Hoover proposal.
Between 560 and $65 million must
be raised to cover construction and
endowment costs for the proposed
Reagan presidential library complex,
the report said.
Of that total, $40 and $45 million
would be used to build a library,
museum and center for public af
fairs, with another $20 million to en
dow the public affairs center.
Once built, the library and
museum would be operated by the
federal government as part of the
National Archives at an annual cost
of approximately $2 million. The en
dowment fund would support the
programs, activities and visiting fel
lowships for the private public af
fairs center, which Hoover proposes
to operate.
