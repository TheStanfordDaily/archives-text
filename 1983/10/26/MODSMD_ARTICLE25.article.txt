# Good running style ensures no pain, no strain
## 
### 
Last Wednesday, a run to
the Dish was used as a way of
illustrating appropriate ex
ercise procedures. Always
start with some easy warm-up
and stretching movements.
Along the way, measure the
intensity of your exercise by
monitoring your heart rate.
Using the formula 220 minus
your age. you can determine
your maximum heart rate.
Your exercise rate should be
70 to 80 percent of your maxi
mum rate.
In this way you can maxi
mize the health and physical
fitness benefits of endurance
exercise, while also reducing
the risk of injury from over
exertion.
Before vou start up the hill
to the Dish, let's go over good
form for running on flat
ground. First, and most impor
tant, be relaxed. Relax your

shoulder and neck muscles
and try to avoid making a fist
with your hands. Second, try
to keep everything going in a
straight line: That is, you
should try to place each step
directly in front of the other.
Women in particular, be
cause they have wider hips
than men, need to guard
against lateral movement and
the tendency to swing the
arms and upper body from
side to side. Such movement
puts a twisting force on the
joints, especially the knee,
and could result in injury. The
back should be relatively
straight.
Stanford track and cross
country Coach Brooks
Johnson advocates running
with a slight forward lean. In
any case you should not be
leaning backward. Most en
durance runners land on the

outer border of the heel and
roll across the foot to push off
with the big toe. Some run
ners land in this mid-sole area,
and few run entirely on their
toes. A good guide is to land
farther up your foot as you in
crease speed.
As you start up the hill, you
want to change your tech
nique by taking shorter
strides, lifting your knees
higher, landing more on your
toe;- and leaning slightly into
the hill. Perhaps most impor
tantly, vou want to use your
arms more, extending them
through at least a 180-degree
range of motion.
Hill running is a form of
strength training. It is a partic
ularly good way to develop the
quadricep, the major muscle
in the front of the thigh.
Having strong quads helps in
any activity where speed is in

volved â€” tennis, soccer, etc.
Strong quads can also help
protect the knee from injury
by strengthening the muscle
structure around that |oint.
When you reach the crest,
try to hold vour pace as you
return to running on flat
ground. Remember, you want
to keep your heart beating
within the target range.
If you exen ise regularly you
will get taster with the same
effort (as measured by heart
rate) as your body becomes
more efficient. At some point,
however, you will reach a
plateau and then you will need
to do speed v\ork to be able to
run faster.
"Fartlek" running is one
way to improve your speed.
The term comes trom Sweden
and means "speed play." Basi
cally it involves picking up
your pace for a while during a

run. A fartlek is not a full
sprint, but working on im
proving your speed in general
requires a proper technique
slightly different from that
already discussed. First of all,
you want to extend your stride
and lift your knees more. You
should be striking the ground
at about the mid-sole of your
foot. Then, you want to use
your arms more, in much the
same fashion as when you
were going up the hill.
At the peak of the climb to
the Dish you can see San Fran
cisco (on a clear day), across
the Bay and well into the
Silicon Valley. You can also
see the smog covering the val
ley In one study done in New
York City, it was found that
runners took in three times as
much carbon monoxide as
non-runners. If you wind up
living in New York or Los An
geles, it would be a good idea
to exercise early in the day and
to stay away from areas which
are close to motor vehicle traf
fic.
As you start down the steep
descent toward Gate 1, be
careful. Running downhill can
be very hard on your joints,

especially the knees. Try to
keep your body perpendicular
to the plane of the hill. That
means leaning forward, not
backward. Leaning backward
to "brake" yourself will over
extend your stride and put ex
cessive shock on your knees.
Run slowly in small steps,
using your arms for balance.
Listen to your feet. If you hear
them slapping the ground and
making noise, you are landing
improperly.
You should begin to slow
your pace in the last 10
minutes of your run. Some
people speed up at the end of
a run which is a poor idea for
two reasons. First of all, the
sudden shock of going trom a
rapid heart beat while sprint
ing to a slower one when stop
ping abruptly puts a great
strain on your heart and has
resulted in heart attacks.
Secondly, injuries tend to oc
cur at the end of a run when a
person is getting very tired. To
raise the exercise level at this
point only serves to increase
the risk of injury. After you
have warmed-down, you
should finish up with some ad
ditional stretching. In particu
lar, you should stretch the

muscles you have used the
most during your exercise
since they will have become
tight with use. You will also
feel better the next day if you
stretch after exercise.
We have been using run
ning as an example of proper
exercise procedures, but the
points apply to other forms of
exercise as well. Be sure to
warm up and stretch, start out
slowly, pay attention to proper
technique and warm down
and stretch again before en
ding your exercise. The result
will be better performance,
more enjoyment and fewer in
juries.
How about doing the Dish
run sometime with President
Donald Kennedy? He normally
runs every Tuesday and Friday
morning when he is on
campus and invites runners of
all levels to join him. Meet him
at 6:30 a.m. at the back lawn of
Hoover House and have a
good run.
