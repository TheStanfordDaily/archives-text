## IMs on Farm: fun and friendly 
### LARRY GREEN 
The Intramural Program at Stanford
is popular and growing with nearly
1500 students competing in over 10
sports this quarter. Athletic activities
range from the mundane, like
weightlitting and arm-wrestling, to the
inane, like football and inner-tube
water polo.
No matter what the sport, IM con
tests are taken very seriously, up to a
point. If all IM contestants could sum
up their experiences in one word, it
would be "tun."
Fssentially, the intramural program
i> run by students under the supervi
sion of the director of the Intramural
Program, an office connected with the
Department of Athletics.
Operating under the director is a
staff composed wholly of students.
These students coordinate the student
managers of each team who, in turn,
serve as the final link between a team
and the IM program. Managers have
[signiiirant responsibility in that they

must register their teams for sports,
report scores, understand all rules ap
plicable to their sports and organize
their teams.
The level of competition which an
IM team encounters is dependent on
the league in which a team competes.
There are A, Band C leagues.
One IM supervisor, a student, said
of the IM football leagues, "A league is
the most intense competition. A lot of
the frats play in A. B league is pretty in
tense too. C league, everyone's out
just to play. No one really kills himself
in IMs here."
Most teams are out to have fun first.
These are the teams with names like
the Newts, Death From Above and the
Porcelain Gods that play football every
Sunday on the IM fields. These stu
dents play because they are friends
and the competition in IMs brings
them together.
One Porcelain God said as he
watched his B-league tootball team
play last Sunday, "We're all guys from

our freshman dorm . . . three years
later."
Intramurals seem to vastly contrib
ute to dorm unity. One football game
between all-freshman teams from
Alondra and Paloma even caused the
resident assistants to jump up and
down on the sidelines. One girl was so
intense that she yelled, half-seriously,
"Where's your loyalty to Alondra?"
The most popular sport this quarter
is football, followed closely bv volley
ball. Volleyball games are played
during the week on afternoons at
courts all around campus, while foot
ball games are on Sundays at the IM
fields bv Stanford Stadium.
In the spring, Softball is the most
popular sport, but the strange game of
inner-tube water polo comes in
second.
|oe Coyne, an IM staffer said that
water polo is "a lot of fun for people in
the spring." A sport like this perfectly
captures the spirit of intramural ath
letics at Stanford: lively competition,
driving intensity and a lot of fun.

football at the IM fields near the stadium yesterday.
