## Oden has 'killer' instinct 
### BETH KLEID 
Odenmania.
The term is not in
Webster's, but the Stanford
sports fan knows what it
means. It means phenom
enal volleyball. It means
Kim Oden.
Sophomore Oden, b
foot-2-inch star middle
blocker on the women's
volleyball team, is one ot
the country's finest volley
ball players. Oden has ac
cumulated quite an impres
sive array ot honors in her
volleyball career. She was
named to the All-America
First Team at the United
States Volleyball Associa
tion Championships. She
was First Team All -
Conference in the VVCAA,
All-tournament at the
NCAA Regional Champion
ships, World University
Games team member,
Stickney's Athlete of the
month of October 1982 and
VVCAA Athlete of the week
in October 1983. And so
Odenmania is further
defined.
Coming into Stanford as
a ireshman Oden said she
set out to "burn-up the
scene." Obviously, she
achieved her goal. As a
freshman Oden was caught
up in the "newness" of her
experiences on the Farm.
She hardly had time to
realize that she felt under
pressure to perform.
'Getting all that recogni
tion was great. I like to be
recognized for my hard
work," Oden said, "but it
got to be a pressure."
The middle-blocker felt
the pressure at the end of
last season, and she contin
ued to feel it at the begin

ning of this season.
"At the beginning of this
season I had trouble coping
with the pressure , but now
I'm handling it much bet
ter," she said.
The way that Oden is
coping with pressure is
simple — she is just talking
about it."I talk about what
I am feeling, and work from
there," she said. ' Friends,
teammates, coaches and
tamilv have all been verv
helpful."
The sophomore noted a
special brand ot closeness
among Cardinal volleyball
team members that makes
it easy to talk things out.
"The team here is unique.
We don't just end it on the

volleyball court, we do so
cial things together — and
we confide in each other."
Oden and some of
the players on the team,
such as Kari Rush and Bar
bara Fontana, were not al
ways friends. In fact, they
were competitors in South
ern California high school
volleyball games. Oden,
who hails from Irvine, said
that no hard feelings
remain from these days of
rivalry. "We remember
high school as fun, and
good volleyball competi
tion — not with any bitter
ness." Oden also remem
bers high school for its
easier caliber of volleyball
play.

"The main difference be
tween high school and col
lege volleyball is that in col
lege a lot more girls can hit
hard and block well. And a
lot more girls are 6-foot-2,"
said Oden, who shares this
stature.
The volleyball coaching
staft here pleases Oden.
She desribes Head Coach
Fred Sturm and assistant
coach Don Shaw as two
men who really know their
volleyball. Both played on
Olympic teams, and Oden
said they are up on volley
ball theories and strategies.
"They are also under
standing as far as players
are concerned. When I was
having problems at the

beginning of the season
they could tell that some
thing was wrong, and they
helped. They are rare, and I
appreciate and admire
them," Oden said.
The admiration between
the player and her coaches
is mutual. Sturm said that
Oden is "a natural for this
game."
"Her unique athletic
ability, her temperament
and her court sense all
combine to make her a real
threat on the court/' Sturm
said. "What sets Kim apart
is that there is still room for
her volleyball skills to
grow."
Oden herself sees room
for improvement. She said

she would like to work on
backcourt play and block
ing, and better her court
sense for hitting. But Oden
is very much aware of her
strong points. "Hitting is
my best asset," she said,
and she consistently proves
this match after match.
Her superior volleyball
ability may open many
doors for Oden in the
tuture. "My ultimate goal is
the 1988 Olympics. I'm
working to achieve it by
just playing and keeping in
shape, but my main con
cern now is to work for
Stanford volleyball."
Oden said that the Card
has more depth than it did
last year, and it has great

potential. It we pull every
thing together we should
do extremely well this
season," she said. She
wants to see the team end
up in the Final Four t ham
pionships.
The team-oriented player
describes herself as
"intense and competitive."
She notes her favorite
match of last season as the
University of the Pacific
match, because it was one
in which the team did well
as a whole. "Everyone on
the team played well. The
match lasted three hours
and went live games — and
we barely won. It was so ex
citing, and the crowd was
great."
The middle-blocker
looks forward to this year's
match against No. I Hawaii.
The N0.2 ranked Cardinal
lost to Hawaii earlier this
season. "But with our im- |
provernent I think we can
beat them."
Oden, who plans to
major in public policy, is
satisfied with academic life
on the Farm. She noted that
it is very frustrating to suc
cessfully combine her
studies with her sport be
cause of the intensity of
academics here.
But Oden did not always
plan to attend school here.
As the lop recruit out of
high school in 1982, she
had her pick of tine volley
ball schools. "I wanted to
go to UCLA, but I ch.inged
my mind at the very last
minute."
Oden said that she made j
the right decision. I think
it was fate," she said.

means. It means phenom
enal volleyball. It means
Kim Oden.
Sophomore Oden, b
foot-2-inch star middle
blocker on the women's
volleyball team, is one ot
the country's finest volley
ball players. Oden has ac
cumulated quite an impres
sive array ot honors in her
volleyball career. She was
named to the All-America
First Team at the United
States Volleyball Associa
tion Championships. She
was First Team All -
Conference in the VVCAA,
All-tournament at the
NCAA Regional Champion
ships, World University
Games team member,
Stickney's Athlete of the
month of October 1982 and
VVCAA Athlete of the week
in October 1983. And so
Odenmania is further
defined.
Coming into Stanford as
a ireshman Oden said she
set out to "burn-up the
scene." Obviously, she
achieved her goal. As a
freshman Oden was caught
up in the "newness" of her
experiences on the Farm.
She hardly had time to
realize that she felt under
pressure to perform.
'Getting all that recogni
tion was great. I like to be
recognized for my hard
work," Oden said, "but it
got to be a pressure."
The middle-blocker felt
the pressure at the end of
last season, and she contin
ued to feel it at the begin

ning of this season.
"At the beginning of this
season I had trouble coping
with the pressure , but now
I'm handling it much bet
ter," she said.
The way that Oden is
coping with pressure is
simple — she is just talking
about it."I talk about what
I am feeling, and work from
there," she said. ' Friends,
teammates, coaches and
tamilv have all been verv
helpful."
The sophomore noted a
special brand ot closeness
among Cardinal volleyball
team members that makes
it easy to talk things out.
"The team here is unique.
We don't just end it on the

volleyball court, we do so
cial things together — and
we confide in each other."
Oden and some of
the players on the team,
such as Kari Rush and Bar
bara Fontana, were not al
ways friends. In fact, they
were competitors in South
ern California high school
volleyball games. Oden,
who hails from Irvine, said
that no hard feelings
remain from these days of
rivalry. "We remember
high school as fun, and
good volleyball competi
tion — not with any bitter
ness." Oden also remem
bers high school for its
easier caliber of volleyball
play.

"The main difference be
tween high school and col
lege volleyball is that in col
lege a lot more girls can hit
hard and block well. And a
lot more girls are 6-foot-2,"
said Oden, who shares this
stature.
The volleyball coaching
staft here pleases Oden.
She desribes Head Coach
Fred Sturm and assistant
coach Don Shaw as two
men who really know their
volleyball. Both played on
Olympic teams, and Oden
said they are up on volley
ball theories and strategies.
"They are also under
standing as far as players
are concerned. When I was
having problems at the

beginning of the season
they could tell that some
thing was wrong, and they
helped. They are rare, and I
appreciate and admire
them," Oden said.
The admiration between
the player and her coaches
is mutual. Sturm said that
Oden is "a natural for this
game."
"Her unique athletic
ability, her temperament
and her court sense all
combine to make her a real
threat on the court/' Sturm
said. "What sets Kim apart
is that there is still room for
her volleyball skills to
grow."
Oden herself sees room
for improvement. She said

she would like to work on
backcourt play and block
ing, and better her court
sense for hitting. But Oden
is very much aware of her
strong points. "Hitting is
my best asset," she said,
and she consistently proves
this match after match.
Her superior volleyball
ability may open many
doors for Oden in the
tuture. "My ultimate goal is
the 1988 Olympics. I'm
working to achieve it by
just playing and keeping in
shape, but my main con
cern now is to work for
Stanford volleyball."
Oden said that the Card
has more depth than it did
last year, and it has great

potential. It we pull every
thing together we should
do extremely well this
season," she said. She
wants to see the team end
up in the Final Four t ham
pionships.
The team-oriented player
describes herself as
"intense and competitive."
She notes her favorite
match of last season as the
University of the Pacific
match, because it was one
in which the team did well
as a whole. "Everyone on
the team played well. The
match lasted three hours
and went live games — and
we barely won. It was so ex
citing, and the crowd was
great."
The middle-blocker
looks forward to this year's
match against No. I Hawaii.
The N0.2 ranked Cardinal
lost to Hawaii earlier this
season. "But with our im- |
provernent I think we can
beat them."
Oden, who plans to
major in public policy, is
satisfied with academic life
on the Farm. She noted that
it is very frustrating to suc
cessfully combine her
studies with her sport be
cause of the intensity of
academics here.
But Oden did not always
plan to attend school here.
As the lop recruit out of
high school in 1982, she
had her pick of tine volley
ball schools. "I wanted to
go to UCLA, but I ch.inged
my mind at the very last
minute."
Oden said that she made j
the right decision. I think
it was fate," she said.
