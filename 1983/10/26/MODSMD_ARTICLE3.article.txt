# Marines invade Grenada, fight 'brutal leftist thugs'
## 
### TIM GRIEVE With wire reports 
American and Caribbean forces
were poised to take full control of
Grenada this morning despite re
ceiving unexpectedly heavy resis
tance from Grenadian and Cuban
fighters that left 26 U.S. servicemen
wounded.
Nearly 2000 American troops
invaded the Marxist-ruled eastern
Caribbean island yesterday morning
in order to "restore democracy"
and protect American residents.
At least two Americans, 12 Cubans
and three Grenadians were killed in
the invasion, as U.S. Marines and
Army Rangers fought with
Grenadian troops and armed Cuban
workers late into the night, accor
ding to U.S. Defense Department
sources. A spokesmen said that the
two Americans — a Navy commando
and an Army Ranger — died as they
were being deployed on Grenada
early yesterday morning, and not in
the fighting with Cuban workers
later in the day.
In addition, the spokesmen ac
knowledged that several U.S.
helicopters had been lost in the in
vasion, although they would not
confirm radio reports from Bar
bados that two of the aircraft had
been shot down over Grenada.
In an emergency session of the
United Nations early this morning,
the deputy chief of Grenada's U.N.
mission claimed that "several
hundred people, many of them civil
ian, have been killed as a result of
the attack."
President Reagan ordered U.S.
Marines and Army Rangers to move
in "to protect innocent lives, to
forestall further chaos and to assist
in the restoration of law and order"
in Grenada.
Reagan, who said that a "bruta!
j*roup of leftist thugs" have ruled
Grenada since Prime Minister
Maurice Bishop was '\!led last week,
explained that the country had
become a "strategic threat" to the
United States because Soviet-bloc
aircraft might use the airport at Point
Salines, which Cuban workers were
building until yesterday's invasion.

Under a plan outlined early this
morning by American officials, the
United States and its Caribbean
allies hope to install the British
governor general on Grenada as the
head of a provisional government
that would rule the island until elec
tions can be held.
Sir Paul Scoon was appointed to
the largely ceremonial governor
general post in 1978 by Queen
Elizabeth 11, but his role was under
cut when Bishop seized power in a
coup a year later. Reports from Bar
bados said Scoon was under house
arrest in Grenada. Britain relin
quished colonial control over
Grenada in 1974.

The invasion began before dawn
when 1900 U.S. soldiers quickly
seized the two airports and secured
the area around an American medi
cal school on the mountainous, 21-
mile-long island.
An additional 300 troops from the
neighboring Caribbean countries
that requested the U.S. invasion
landed on the island a few hours
after the American forces.
Approxiamately 1000 Americans
live on the island, 650 of whom are
students at St. George's University
School of Medicine.
An administration official said late
last night that units of the 82nd Air
borne Division, based in Ft. Bragg,
North Carolina, will probably be

sent to control one of the two air
ports and free the Rangers to attack
pockets of resistance.
Thirty Soviet advisers and 600
Cuban workers were captured in the
invasion, U.S. sources said.
U.S. officials have beefed up se
curity at the U.S. Naval base at
Gauntanamo, Cuba, in anticipation
of a possible retaliatory move by
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
Meanwhile, Grenada has asked
the United Nations to condemn the
invasion, saying that "unless we do
not (condemn the invasion), what is
happening to Grenada will happen
to somebody else."
Outside Grenada, the invasion

Paul Irvin/Daily
has received mixed reaction interna
tionally, nationally and locally.
Predictably, congressional
Democrats have criticized the
surprise invasion, while many
Republicans have praised it.
In San Francisco, a chanting,
shouting group of about 400
protested the invasion in front of
the Federal Building yesterday, and
thousands of marchers took to thf>
streets in Berkeley. Speakers in San
Francisco claimed the Grenada inva
sion was "an effort to move
Lebanon off the front page."
Later last night three
demonstrators were arrested for
vandalism in Berkeley as an esti
