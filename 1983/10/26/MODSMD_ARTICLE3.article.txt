# Marines invade Grenada, fight 'brutal leftist thugs'
## 
### TIM GRIEVE With wire reports 
American and Caribbean forces
were poised to take full control of
Grenada this morning despite re
ceiving unexpectedly heavy resis
tance from Grenadian and Cuban
fighters that left 26 U.S. servicemen
wounded.
Nearly 2000 American troops
invaded the Marxist-ruled eastern
Caribbean island yesterday morning
in order to "restore democracy"
and protect American residents.
At least two Americans, 12 Cubans
and three Grenadians were killed in
the invasion, as U.S. Marines and
Army Rangers fought with
Grenadian troops and armed Cuban
workers late into the night, accor
ding to U.S. Defense Department
sources. A spokesmen said that the
two Americans — a Navy commando
and an Army Ranger — died as they
were being deployed on Grenada
early yesterday morning, and not in
the fighting with Cuban workers
later in the day.
In addition, the spokesmen ac
knowledged that several U.S.
helicopters had been lost in the in
vasion, although they would not
confirm radio reports from Bar
bados that two of the aircraft had
been shot down over Grenada.
In an emergency session of the
United Nations early this morning,
the deputy chief of Grenada's U.N.
mission claimed that "several
hundred people, many of them civil
ian, have been killed as a result of
the attack."
President Reagan ordered U.S.
Marines and Army Rangers to move
in "to protect innocent lives, to
forestall further chaos and to assist
in the restoration of law and order"
in Grenada.
Reagan, who said that a "bruta!
j*roup of leftist thugs" have ruled
Grenada since Prime Minister
Maurice Bishop was '\!led last week,
explained that the country had
become a "strategic threat" to the
United States because Soviet-bloc
aircraft might use the airport at Point
Salines, which Cuban workers were
building until yesterday's invasion.

Under a plan outlined early this
morning by American officials, the
United States and its Caribbean
allies hope to install the British
governor general on Grenada as the
head of a provisional government
that would rule the island until elec
tions can be held.
Sir Paul Scoon was appointed to
the largely ceremonial governor
general post in 1978 by Queen
Elizabeth 11, but his role was under
cut when Bishop seized power in a
coup a year later. Reports from Bar
bados said Scoon was under house
arrest in Grenada. Britain relin
quished colonial control over
Grenada in 1974.

The invasion began before dawn
when 1900 U.S. soldiers quickly
seized the two airports and secured
the area around an American medi
cal school on the mountainous, 21-
mile-long island.
An additional 300 troops from the
neighboring Caribbean countries
that requested the U.S. invasion
landed on the island a few hours
after the American forces.
Approxiamately 1000 Americans
live on the island, 650 of whom are
students at St. George's University
School of Medicine.
An administration official said late
last night that units of the 82nd Air
borne Division, based in Ft. Bragg,
North Carolina, will probably be

sent to control one of the two air
ports and free the Rangers to attack
pockets of resistance.
Thirty Soviet advisers and 600
Cuban workers were captured in the
invasion, U.S. sources said.
U.S. officials have beefed up se
curity at the U.S. Naval base at
Gauntanamo, Cuba, in anticipation
of a possible retaliatory move by
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
Meanwhile, Grenada has asked
the United Nations to condemn the
invasion, saying that "unless we do
not (condemn the invasion), what is
happening to Grenada will happen
to somebody else."
Outside Grenada, the invasion

Paul Irvin/Daily
has received mixed reaction interna
tionally, nationally and locally.
Predictably, congressional
Democrats have criticized the
surprise invasion, while many
Republicans have praised it.
In San Francisco, a chanting,
shouting group of about 400
protested the invasion in front of
the Federal Building yesterday, and
thousands of marchers took to thf>
streets in Berkeley. Speakers in San
Francisco claimed the Grenada inva
sion was "an effort to move
Lebanon off the front page."
Later last night three
demonstrators were arrested for
vandalism in Berkeley as an esti

mated 1000-3000 protestors marched
through the city with Mayor Gus
Newport.
Leaders of Britain, Nicaragua,
Cuba and Mexico have sharply
criticized the move, and Salazar
Paredes, Bolivia's ambassador to the
United Nations and the chairman of
the Organizations of American
States ((DAS), said the invasion was a
violation of the organization's
charter, which prohibits interven
tion "for any reason whatsoever in
the internal or external affairs of anv
other state" in the organization.
Reagan administration members
did not address the OAS charter yes
terday."The U.S. is responding to
an urgent appeal (by) the Organiza
tion of Eastern Caribbean States for
assistance .... That is our legal
basis for involvement," White
House spokesman Larry Speakes
said.
)ohn Wirth, the director of Latin
American studies here, said that the
U.S. government has long been
concerned with Marxist influence
on the island and the events of the
past week gave the United States an
opportunity to act on its concerns.
"The justification is to protect the
lives of American citizens," Wirth
said. But, he added, "the Reagan ad
ministration is concerned with stra
tegic and military questions and

Grenada lies on a shipping lane and
the airstrip being built links with
Cuban policy in Africa."
Wirth said he is concerned that
the invasion is "clearly an interven
tion of East-West rivalries in a part of
the world that was removed from
that," he explained.
However, he said he believes
Reagan's contention that U.S.
troops will occupy the island for
only a few days.
"Let's not kid ourselves," he said.
"It's a confrontation and I think
we'll be out as soon as possible."
However, Classics Prof. Gregson
Davis, a native of Antigua, a small is
land about 300 miles from Grenada,
said he thinks the U.S. troops will
stay in Grenada for a much longer
period of time.
"I don't think it will be a 'few
days' at all. They want a government
that's anti-Communist. They will
stay there as long as it takes," he
said." If they said, 'Let's have free
elections tomorrow,' and the
people elected a Marxist govern
ment, they wouldn't leave. That's
not what they're there for."
Law School Prof. Thomas Heller,
who has lived in Grenada, also said
it is unlikely the U.S. troops will be
able to leave the island any time
soon. "I don't know what they
believe they can set up," he said.
"In general in Latin America, the
U.S. has the image of a third force in
white hats" that are neither right
wing dictators or Marxists.
"If they had actual people waiting

in the wings, and not just phantoms,
then they could put them in. But it
doesn't seem likely that unless they
have some of those people handy, I
don t see how they can get out of
there," Heller said.
Davis said the invasion sets a dan
gerous precedent of U.S. interven
tion, but agrees with Wirth that the
Marxist government in Grenada has
long troubled Reagan.
"It smacks of the whole 'this is
our hemisphere' notion. The U.S.
has wanted for many years to go in
there and get rid of the Cubans and
the Russians. The only thing that's
surprising is that they didn't do it
before," he said.
Wirth said one of the greatest
dangers of the invasion is the possi
ble reaction from Cuba.
"The question is how many
Cubans have been killed. When you
have martyrs, you have something,"
he said early yesterday afternoon.
Heller said late last night that the
situation in Grenada is "all too
sketchy to know who these people
are we're trying to replace.
"It's a complicated question.
Technically, the invasion was de
signed to replace a government
that's been in since last week and
about which we know very little.
The whole thing takes place in a
background of American hostility to
any kind of progressive social
change," he said.

"It's a confrontation and I think
we'll be out as soon as possible."
However, Classics Prof. Gregson
Davis, a native of Antigua, a small is
land about 300 miles from Grenada,
said he thinks the U.S. troops will
stay in Grenada for a much longer
period of time.
"I don't think it will be a 'few
days' at all. They want a government
that's anti-Communist. They will
stay there as long as it takes," he
said." If they said, 'Let's have free
elections tomorrow,' and the
people elected a Marxist govern
ment, they wouldn't leave. That's
not what they're there for."
Law School Prof. Thomas Heller,
who has lived in Grenada, also said
it is unlikely the U.S. troops will be
able to leave the island any time
soon. "I don't know what they
believe they can set up," he said.
"In general in Latin America, the
U.S. has the image of a third force in
white hats" that are neither right
wing dictators or Marxists.
"If they had actual people waiting

in the wings, and not just phantoms,
then they could put them in. But it
doesn't seem likely that unless they
have some of those people handy, I
don t see how they can get out of
there," Heller said.
Davis said the invasion sets a dan
gerous precedent of U.S. interven
tion, but agrees with Wirth that the
Marxist government in Grenada has
long troubled Reagan.
"It smacks of the whole 'this is
our hemisphere' notion. The U.S.
has wanted for many years to go in
there and get rid of the Cubans and
the Russians. The only thing that's
surprising is that they didn't do it
before," he said.
Wirth said one of the greatest
dangers of the invasion is the possi
ble reaction from Cuba.
"The question is how many
Cubans have been killed. When you
have martyrs, you have something,"
he said early yesterday afternoon.
Heller said late last night that the
situation in Grenada is "all too
sketchy to know who these people
are we're trying to replace.
"It's a complicated question.
Technically, the invasion was de
signed to replace a government
that's been in since last week and
about which we know very little.
The whole thing takes place in a
background of American hostility to

change," he said.
American and Caribbean forces
were poised to take full control of
Grenada this morning despite re
ceiving unexpectedly heavy resis
tance from Grenadian and Cuban
fighters that left 26 U.S. servicemen
wounded.
Nearly 2000 American troops
invaded the Marxist-ruled eastern
Caribbean island yesterday morning
in order to "restore democracy"
and protect American residents.
At least two Americans, 12 Cubans
and three Grenadians were killed in
the invasion, as U.S. Marines and
Army Rangers fought with
Grenadian troops and armed Cuban
workers late into the night, accor
ding to U.S. Defense Department
sources. A spokesmen said that the
two Americans — a Navy commando
and an Army Ranger — died as they
were being deployed on Grenada
early yesterday morning, and not in
the fighting with Cuban workers
later in the day.
In addition, the spokesmen ac
knowledged that several U.S.
helicopters had been lost in the in
vasion, although they would not
confirm radio reports from Bar
bados that two of the aircraft had
been shot down over Grenada.
In an emergency session of the
United Nations early this morning,
the deputy chief of Grenada's U.N.
mission claimed that "several
hundred people, many of them civil
ian, have been killed as a result of
the attack."
President Reagan ordered U.S.
Marines and Army Rangers to move
in "to protect innocent lives, to
forestall further chaos and to assist
in the restoration of law and order"
in Grenada.
Reagan, who said that a "bruta!
j*roup of leftist thugs" have ruled
Grenada since Prime Minister
Maurice Bishop was '\!led last week,
explained that the country had
become a "strategic threat" to the
United States because Soviet-bloc
aircraft might use the airport at Point
Salines, which Cuban workers were
building until yesterday's invasion.

Under a plan outlined early this
morning by American officials, the
United States and its Caribbean
allies hope to install the British
governor general on Grenada as the
head of a provisional government
that would rule the island until elec
tions can be held.
Sir Paul Scoon was appointed to
the largely ceremonial governor
general post in 1978 by Queen
Elizabeth 11, but his role was under
cut when Bishop seized power in a
coup a year later. Reports from Bar
bados said Scoon was under house
arrest in Grenada. Britain relin
quished colonial control over
Grenada in 1974.

The invasion began before dawn
when 1900 U.S. soldiers quickly
seized the two airports and secured
the area around an American medi
cal school on the mountainous, 21-
mile-long island.
An additional 300 troops from the
neighboring Caribbean countries
that requested the U.S. invasion
landed on the island a few hours
after the American forces.
Approxiamately 1000 Americans
live on the island, 650 of whom are
students at St. George's University
School of Medicine.
An administration official said late
last night that units of the 82nd Air
borne Division, based in Ft. Bragg,
North Carolina, will probably be

sent to control one of the two air
ports and free the Rangers to attack
pockets of resistance.
Thirty Soviet advisers and 600
Cuban workers were captured in the
invasion, U.S. sources said.
U.S. officials have beefed up se
curity at the U.S. Naval base at
Gauntanamo, Cuba, in anticipation
of a possible retaliatory move by
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
Meanwhile, Grenada has asked
the United Nations to condemn the
invasion, saying that "unless we do
not (condemn the invasion), what is
happening to Grenada will happen
to somebody else."
Outside Grenada, the invasion

Paul Irvin/Daily
has received mixed reaction interna
tionally, nationally and locally.
Predictably, congressional
Democrats have criticized the
surprise invasion, while many
Republicans have praised it.
In San Francisco, a chanting,
shouting group of about 400
protested the invasion in front of
the Federal Building yesterday, and
thousands of marchers took to thf>
streets in Berkeley. Speakers in San
Francisco claimed the Grenada inva
sion was "an effort to move
Lebanon off the front page."
Later last night three
demonstrators were arrested for
vandalism in Berkeley as an esti

mated 1000-3000 protestors marched
through the city with Mayor Gus
Newport.
Leaders of Britain, Nicaragua,
Cuba and Mexico have sharply
criticized the move, and Salazar
Paredes, Bolivia's ambassador to the
United Nations and the chairman of
the Organizations of American
States ((DAS), said the invasion was a
violation of the organization's
charter, which prohibits interven
tion "for any reason whatsoever in
the internal or external affairs of anv
other state" in the organization.
Reagan administration members
did not address the OAS charter yes
terday."The U.S. is responding to
an urgent appeal (by) the Organiza
tion of Eastern Caribbean States for
assistance .... That is our legal
basis for involvement," White
House spokesman Larry Speakes
said.
)ohn Wirth, the director of Latin
American studies here, said that the
U.S. government has long been
concerned with Marxist influence
on the island and the events of the
past week gave the United States an
opportunity to act on its concerns.
"The justification is to protect the
lives of American citizens," Wirth
said. But, he added, "the Reagan ad
ministration is concerned with stra
tegic and military questions and

Grenada lies on a shipping lane and
the airstrip being built links with
Cuban policy in Africa."
Wirth said he is concerned that
the invasion is "clearly an interven
tion of East-West rivalries in a part of
the world that was removed from
that," he explained.
However, he said he believes
Reagan's contention that U.S.
troops will occupy the island for
only a few days.
"Let's not kid ourselves," he said.
"It's a confrontation and I think

Meanwhile, Grenada has asked
the United Nations to condemn the
invasion, saying that "unless we do
not (condemn the invasion), what is
happening to Grenada will happen
to somebody else."
Outside Grenada, the invasion

Paul Irvin/Daily
has received mixed reaction interna
tionally, nationally and locally.
Predictably, congressional
Democrats have criticized the
surprise invasion, while many
Republicans have praised it.
In San Francisco, a chanting,
shouting group of about 400
protested the invasion in front of
the Federal Building yesterday, and
thousands of marchers took to thf>
streets in Berkeley. Speakers in San
Francisco claimed the Grenada inva
sion was "an effort to move
Lebanon off the front page."
Later last night three
demonstrators were arrested for
vandalism in Berkeley as an esti

mated 1000-3000 protestors marched
through the city with Mayor Gus
Newport.
Leaders of Britain, Nicaragua,
Cuba and Mexico have sharply
criticized the move, and Salazar
Paredes, Bolivia's ambassador to the
United Nations and the chairman of
the Organizations of American
States ((DAS), said the invasion was a
violation of the organization's
charter, which prohibits interven
tion "for any reason whatsoever in
the internal or external affairs of anv
other state" in the organization.
Reagan administration members
did not address the OAS charter yes
terday."The U.S. is responding to
an urgent appeal (by) the Organiza
tion of Eastern Caribbean States for
assistance .... That is our legal
basis for involvement," White
House spokesman Larry Speakes
said.
)ohn Wirth, the director of Latin
American studies here, said that the
U.S. government has long been
concerned with Marxist influence
on the island and the events of the
past week gave the United States an
opportunity to act on its concerns.
"The justification is to protect the
lives of American citizens," Wirth
said. But, he added, "the Reagan ad
ministration is concerned with stra
tegic and military questions and

Grenada lies on a shipping lane and
the airstrip being built links with
Cuban policy in Africa."
Wirth said he is concerned that
the invasion is "clearly an interven
tion of East-West rivalries in a part of
the world that was removed from
that," he explained.
However, he said he believes
Reagan's contention that U.S.
troops will occupy the island for
only a few days.
"Let's not kid ourselves," he said.
"It's a confrontation and I think
we'll be out as soon as possible."
However, Classics Prof. Gregson
Davis, a native of Antigua, a small is
land about 300 miles from Grenada,
said he thinks the U.S. troops will
stay in Grenada for a much longer
period of time.
"I don't think it will be a 'few
days' at all. They want a government
that's anti-Communist. They will
stay there as long as it takes," he
said." If they said, 'Let's have free
elections tomorrow,' and the
people elected a Marxist govern
ment, they wouldn't leave. That's
not what they're there for."
Law School Prof. Thomas Heller,
who has lived in Grenada, also said
it is unlikely the U.S. troops will be
able to leave the island any time
soon. "I don't know what they
believe they can set up," he said.
"In general in Latin America, the
U.S. has the image of a third force in
white hats" that are neither right
wing dictators or Marxists.
"If they had actual people waiting

in the wings, and not just phantoms,
then they could put them in. But it
doesn't seem likely that unless they
have some of those people handy, I
don t see how they can get out of
there," Heller said.
Davis said the invasion sets a dan
gerous precedent of U.S. interven
tion, but agrees with Wirth that the
Marxist government in Grenada has
long troubled Reagan.
"It smacks of the whole 'this is
our hemisphere' notion. The U.S.
has wanted for many years to go in
there and get rid of the Cubans and
the Russians. The only thing that's
surprising is that they didn't do it
before," he said.
Wirth said one of the greatest
dangers of the invasion is the possi
ble reaction from Cuba.
"The question is how many
Cubans have been killed. When you
have martyrs, you have something,"
he said early yesterday afternoon.
Heller said late last night that the
situation in Grenada is "all too
sketchy to know who these people
are we're trying to replace.
"It's a complicated question.
Technically, the invasion was de
signed to replace a government
that's been in since last week and
about which we know very little.
The whole thing takes place in a
background of American hostility to
any kind of progressive social
change," he said.
