Stanford will be very evenly
matched when it faces NAIA
power Fresno Pacific today at 3
p.m. on Harry Maloney Field.
Both teams have similar
season records although
Fresno has one more loss at 9-
4-2.
"The teams will match up
fairly well," Fresno Pacific
Coach Ben Norton said, "if
they play up to their poten
tial."
Playing up to its potential
might be a bit harder for Stan
ford since the team is ham
pered by injuries.
Stanford's playmaker Walter
Kingson will play but he has

lost much of his speed due'to
a contusion on his calf.
In the last game, Robby
West was limping on and off
the field and Chris Morrow,
Kingson's replacement, also
limped off the field.
Though the loss of these in
dividuals is crucial to the
lineup, Stanford has the depth
to cover for them.
"Neither of our teams has
any one player we rely on,"
Norton said. "However, Stan
ford does rely a great deal on
(lorge) Titinger for creative
work up front."
Fortunately, Titinger is still
going strong and has set up
manv scoring opportunities by

drawing two men to him,
leaving others open in the
middle. This seems to be Stan
ford's most successful play. It
also explains why many differ
ent players have scored in
stead of just a few individuals.
Fresno Pacific has a scoring
machine named Raphael
Dicicco, who is only a fresh
man. This Brazilian youth
leads Fresno with five goals
and has a "great shot and a
powerful header," according
to Norton.
Stanford is presently ranked
seventh in the Western Divi
sion while Fresno is ranked
18th among NAIA teams.
