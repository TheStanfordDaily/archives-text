# Harry, Wyman honored
## 
### 
For their efforts in Saturday's 31-22 upset of
19th-ranked Arizona, Stanford wide receiver
Emile Harry and middle linebacker Dave
Wyman were two of three players named
Pacific-10 Players of the Week .
Harry, the Cardinal junior who caught 10
John Paye passes for 179 yards and two touch
downs, and Washington State fullback Kerry
Porter, who rushed 134 yards on 19 carries,
were honored as Co-Offensive Players of the
Week.
Harry's 179 yards is the top reception yardage

mark in the Pac-10 this year and the third best
in Stanford history.
Wyman, a sophomore from Reno, Nevada,
was named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the
Week for leading a Stanford defense that
allowed Arizona just 82 yards rushing. Wyman
recorded 16 tackles, 13 of them unassisted, and
caused one fumble.
Harry and Wyman are the first Stanford
players to reap the Pac-10 weekly honor this
season.
