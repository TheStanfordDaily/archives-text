# ASSU Senate backs faculty report on presidential library complex
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU passed a resolution last night
endorsing the proposed Reagan library at
Stanford, but agreeing with a faculty com
mittee's opinion that a presidential
museum would have "little or no academic
value."
The senate also moved to request that li
brary hours at Meyer be extended to mid
night, and that Green Library hours be
lengthened until midnight seven days a
week.
The Reagan library resolution, authored
by Council of Presidents member Su Uh
land, reaches the same conclusions as the

report of a faculty committee, headed by
Economics Prof, lames Rosse, advising that
the library should be considered favorably
and asking for further advice from the Fac
ulty Senate. It was approved over a resolu
tion that discouraged placing the Reagan
museum here, but encouraged the location
of the library and a public affairs center at
Stanford.
Senator Mark Soble, who co-authored
the discarded resolution with graduate
senator Roland Van Gaalen, said he felt the
senate should act "swiftly and with strong
resolution" on the issue.
"It is not within our scope to be strongly
opinionated," Uhland said, "especially

since many of you seem uninformed about
the (Ffoover) issue."
Soble defended his stand on the Reagan
museum by explaining that since it, in his
opinion, would have absolutely no academ
ic value, it would be equally suitable in an
other location. "For example, it could be
placed in President Reagan's hometown,"
he said.
Several senators debated the importance
of considering the "effect of the public per
ception of the political orientation of the
University," as Uhland suggested. Van
Gaalen insisted that the University's image
should not be a consideration in the Reagan
library issue.

COP-member Karol Watson said she felt
the University was already perceived as
conservative, and the Reagan library ac
quisition would emphasize this image.
On the library issue, Meyer has officially
reopened until 11 p.m. on weekends, and
has decided to keep extended dead week
and finals week hours, but the senate
decided to ask that the original midnight
closing be reinstated. In addition, the Sen
ate moved to advise that Green's hours be
extended to midnight.
The Meyer-Green resolution, authored
by graduate senator )im McGrath, replaced
a resolution authored by senator Mark
Fleischauer that concerned only the Meyer

closing.
"I don't think there's been enough inter
est to consider expanding Green's hours,"
Fleischauer said. He explained that he felt
more study should be done by the ASSU on
the need for extended hours at Green
before any action is taken.
"There has been significant student input
on the Green issue," McGrath argued.
"Green library hours are very sharply cur
tailed with respect to Meyer, and, as far as
personal priority, Green hours are more im
portant than Meyer hours. There's nothing
that Meyer has and Green doesn't beside
reserve reading for undergraduate
courses."
