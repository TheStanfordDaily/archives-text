# Fewer students get ASSU refunds
## 
### PAM CLOYD Staff writer 
Students collected much less money this year than
last year in ASSU fee assessment refunds, Student
Financial Manager Mindy Basham said yesterday.
"It (the total) was quite a lot lower," Basham said.
"About one-third lower than last year."
Basham said $26,216, or 14.1 percent of the total col
lected, was refunded. Last year students collected
$32,90*, which was 21.1 percent of the total fee assess
ment.
Basham said the two-week long refund process
which ended last Friday went "smoothly," although
there were some problems associated with the new
rule that allows only students who voted in last year's
ASSU elections to collect refunds.
Students approved the new rule in a general election
held two years ago, after a record 42.2 percent of fee as
sessments was refunded that year.
Freshmen, transfer students, first-year graduate stu
dents and students studying overseas last spring were
exempted from the requirement, but Basham said that
some students who were on campus last spring were

not aware of the rule.
"Whenever you initiate a new rule, there are always
people who think they should be the exceptions," she
said. "But other than that it went pretty well."
Of the 11 groups on the ballot, the Graduate Stu
dents Association lost the highest percentage of their
budget, 16.6 percent. The ASSU Legal Counseling Of
fice lost 8.3 percent, the lowest of all the groups.
The losses of other groups were- Academic Organi
zations Board, 16.2 percent; Publications Board, 16.2
percent; Guest Professorship Board, 16.2 percent; Pro
gram Board, 16.1 percent; KZSU, 15 percent; the Band,
14.5 percent; Club Sports, 13.4 percent; The Daily, 11
percent; and SURE, 10.8 percent.
Basham did not release the dollar amounts that each
groups lost, because those figures can be "very mis
leading," she said.
Basham said that most of the groups planned for a 25
percent refund rate in their budgets. If the refund rate
is "exceedingly' below 25 percent again next quarter,
groups will receive the extra money in their winter
quarter disbursement of funds, she said.
