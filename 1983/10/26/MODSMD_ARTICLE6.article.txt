Reagan guts rights commission
Washington — President Reagan tired half the Civil
Rights Commission to make room for his own team
of conservatives yesterday in a move that effectively
put the gadfly agency out of business at least tempo
rarily.
Outraged civil rights groups said the three ousted
members, appointed by two previous presidents,
were guilty only of criticizing the administration's
record.
A bipartisan effort has launched in the Senate to
reconstitute the commission as an independent arm
of Congress, and House Democrats unanimously
approved a statement "strongly" disapproving of

Reagan's action, which it said was taken "without
cause."
Reagan's surprise move came after five months of
wrangling between the administration and congres
sional liberals over the makeup of the independent
commission.
Vice president en route to Beirut
Washington — Vice President George Bush was en
route early today to Beirut, where he planned to
meet with Lebanese President Amin Cemayel and
visit with the Marine peace-keeping force.
Robin Cray, a White House spokesperson, said
shortly atter 9 p.m. that he expected Bush to arrive
in Lebanon shortly but did not know exactly when.
The trip was not announced prior to the vice presi-

dent's departure
First injured Marines return
Washington — The first of the Marines injured in
the Beirut bombing came back to America yesterday
as the administration dispatched its top officials to
explain why their barracks were so easily pene
trated.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger brieted the
Senate Armed Services Committee in a closed ses
sion and chairman John Tower (R-Texas) emerged
saying, "It is the consensus of the committee that
security was not adequate."
"Quite clearly, every security measure was not
taken," said Sen. Edward Kennedy, (D-Mass.).
There was a call from House leaders that the
families of the injured be flown to Europe to be with
their hospitalized loved ones.
Meanwhile, the count of the dead in Sunday's ex
plosion at the Marine headquarters rose to 216. The
bodies of 197 already were undergoing processing
and identification in Frankfurt, Germany. They will
be tlown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware but no
date has been set.
Secretary of State George Shultz told a news con
ference that security in Beirut was not as tight as offi
cials would like because the Marines were at an
operating airport.

Congress questions security
Washington — Angry members of Congress, still
divided over the wisdom of keeping Marines in
Lebanon, demanded yesterday to know why set urit\
was not tighter around the U.S. troop headquarters
when it was leveled Sunday by a terrorist bomb that
killed 216 Marines.
In a closed 90-minute meeting with the Senate
Armed Forces Services Committee, Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger reiterated the
ott-stated warning that terrorist attacks are in
evitable in faction-torn Lebanon. But committee
members made it clear that they will insist on a
detailed explanation of how the terrorists
explosive-laden truck was able to crash into a major
Marine facility with apparent ease, despite the long
history ot such bombings in Beirut.
Consensus on Mitterand's policy
Paris — French political leaders and editorial com
mentators from left to right rallied strongly yester
day behind President Francois Mitterand's declara
tion that "France remains and will remain faithful to
its history and its engagements" in Lebanon.
Even the Communist Party, which has four cabinet
ministers in the Mitterand government, appeared to
back off to some extent trom a statement made by
party leader Georges Marchais several weeks ago in
which he called tor withdrawal of French troops

after an earlier wave of sniper casualties and their
replacement by a U.N. torce.
With the toll of French casualties in the Beirut
bombing still mounting, there was across-the-board
praise here yesterday tor the Socialist president's
quick visit to the Lebanese capital Monday and his
declaration that the troops will remain.
Cost of living rises
Washington — Rising prices tor cars, food and
housing drove up the cost of living by 0.5 percent
during September, the largest increase in four
months, the Department of Labor reported yester
day.
''rices are accelerating gradually as the nation
recovers from its severe economic slump, but the
underlying inflation rate is still relatively moderate,
economists believe. They say the cost of living is
likely to rise less that 5 percent this year, compared
with a 3.9 percent increase during 1982.
"While this monthly increase is small, and infla
tion remains at a very low level, this month's in
crease reminds us that keeping inflation under con
trol requires constant vigilance," White House
spokesman Larry Speakes said. "Today's inflation
rate is just another indication that the economy is
adjusting to a sustainable level of activity."
The long-range outlook for inflation is good be
cause wages, the biggest single expense of produc

tion, are rising at an annual rate of 4.5 percent, down
drastically from a pace ol nearly II percent in 1981.
"The most dramatic economic story is the slowing of
wages," Robert Wescott ot Wharton Econometrics,
a forecasting firm, said.
"There are no cost pressures" to drive up prices
significantly, agreed Ronals Utl, deputy chief econo
mist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Stocks rise slightly
New York — Stock prices rose yesterday, follow
ing through on a recovery from early losses Monday.
Seven stocks climbed in price for every five that
fell in the midday tally of New York Stock Exchange
listed issues.
Ihe Dow |ones average of 30 industrials climbed
3.45 points to 1252.4 5 at the end of trading. On Mon
day, the blue-chip average rebounded from a loss of
nearly 16 points in the early going to close with a
gain of .10.
Today's weather
Mostly fair today except increasing high clouds.
Variable clouds tonight and tomorrow with a few
showers. Highs in the low 80s, lows in the 50s.
