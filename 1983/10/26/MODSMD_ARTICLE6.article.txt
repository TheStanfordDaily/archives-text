put the gadfly agency out of business at least tempo
rarily.
Outraged civil rights groups said the three ousted

were guilty only of criticizing the administration's

of Congress, and House Democrats unanimously
approved a statement "strongly" disapproving of

Reagan's surprise move came after five months of
wrangling between the administration and congres
sional liberals over the makeup of the independent
commission.
