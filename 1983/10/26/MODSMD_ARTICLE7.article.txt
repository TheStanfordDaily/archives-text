# Former Treasury chief says U.S. no longer rules business

### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
The days of U.S. domination in in
ternational business are "clearly
gone" due to a "total change of
landscape" in world economics and
politics, W. Michael Blumenthal,
secretary of the Treasury during the
Carter administration, said last night
at Bishop Auditorium.
Blumenthal said that "no
developed country has yet to solve
the problem of economic manage
ment" for the 1980s and '90s. The
need for knowledge of how foreign
governments operate and impose
trade restrictions and market limita
tions is essential for success today in
international business, he said.
The United States must "get off its
ideological high horse" belief that
foreign interference in economic
markets is wrong and must
eliminate talk about restrictions"
on foreign products to compete
today, Blumenthal said.
New attitudes of cooperation be
tween countries and corporations
must be taken in international busi
ness, he said.
The study of the "externalities
relating to understanding monetary
,ind fiscal policies" of developing
and European nations must be ac
quired by management, Blumenthal
said.
He cited the "wholesale, uncoor
dinated, unmanageable movement
of currencies against each other" as

one of the pressing problems facing
international business today. The
rapid movement of capital, a result
of new technological advance
ments, is the cause of this problem,
as investors overreact in deals
causing sudden changes in currency
rates, he said.

Any democracy, the former Trea
sury secretary said, is "inherently
slower than an autocratic system" to
adjust to the changes in global eco
nomics and politics and to form a
policy to adapt to the situation.
While no "fundamental" changes
are necessary in the system of the
United States, Blumenthal favors

"joint management of monetary and
fiscal policy."
Blumenthal, presently chairman
of the board and chief executive of
Burroughs Corporation, also served
as president and chief executive of
ficer of Bendix Corporation in the
early 19705.

He is involved in the civic devel
opment of Detroit and sits on the
boards of the Detroit Renaissance
Inc. and New Detroit Inc.
Blumenthal's speech, "How to do
Business in an International Environ
ment," was part of a series to be
presented this vear by the Business
School,
