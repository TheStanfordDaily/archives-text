## Campus activists urge Zschau to reverse MX missile stand 
### ALEXANDER PAYNE 
To the disappointment of Stanford anti
nuclear activists, Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Los
Altos) has reaffirmed his intention to vote in
favor of funding the MX-missile system in a
House vote scheduled for this week.
Speaking Saturday at a town meeting in
Menlo Park, Zschau, who advocated a nu
clear freeze in his 1982 campaign, said he
has "become convinced that the MX plays
an important role in the current (Strategic
Arms Reduction Talks).
"So long as I feel that the administration
is reaching out and making sincere at
tempts to find solutions to the arms control
negotiation deadlock," he said, "and so
long as I feel the MX plays as positive role in
that, then I will support it."
Zschau said he thinks Reagan has shown
"a major shift in flexibility" in his most
recent disarmament proposals.
But Stanford MX opponents here say they
are disillusioned with what they perceive in
Zschau as a change in position from his
anti-nuclear stance during last year's cam
paign.
Anti-nuclear activist John Mattox, a
graduate student in applied physics, said he
was ' dumbfounded" when the freshman
congressman first indicated last spring that
he intended to vote in favor of the MX.
Sidney Drell, deputy director of the Stan
ford Linea r Accelerator, said he is "very dis
appointed" by Zschau's position on the

MX. He said he has spoken to Zschau many
times to express his anti-MX views.
Drell, an adviser to the National Security
Council during the Carter administration,
said he objects to the MX on the basis of its
being a relatively easy target.
"My position is that it does not contrib
ute to deterrence since in a silo it is so vul
nerably based," he said. "It would increase

the existing problem of vulnerable sys
tems."
Byron Bland, minister of United Campus
Christian Ministry which has taken an anti
nuclear stand, said he considers Zschau
"very vulnerable at this point, especially as
strong as he campaigned for the freeze."
"He has been maneuvering back and
forth to try to convince the people who
supported him on the basis of the freeze
that he hasn't waffled on this point," he
said. "I think the perception that he waffled
on the freeze and voted for the MX could
lose him the election next year."
Asked by Mattox at the meeting to
delineate the "positive role" of the MX in
arms control, Zschau noted the alleged su
periority of the Soviets in silo-based missies
and suggested that the MX, a silo-based
missile, would aid the United States' posi
tion at the bargaining table.
"I feel that (the MX) indicates that arms
control agreements would benefit the So
viet Union by limiting our building up, just
as those agreements would benefit us. But
if we say we're not going to build up
anyway, then I wonder whether the agree
ment would be beneficial to them," he
said.
Zschau further qualified his acceptance
of the MX, saying that he sees its value only
in the arms control context. "If we were
looking at it in terms of its military capabil
ity, then I wouldn't support it."

Mattox said later he finds Zschau's argu
ment "specious. What I hear him saying is
that we need to use the MX to buy arms
control. I'm asking, 'What is arms control?'
It it's something we need to deploy accu
rate ICBM's to attain, then arms control is
empty, useless."
Mattox said, however, that he thinks
Zschau is sincere in his position on the MX.
"But there are people within the peace
movement who would disagree. They
would say he's playing partisan politics and
being a Republican."
Mattox, along with other anti-nuclear
members of the Stanford community, has
tried in the past months to convince Zschau
to vote against the MX. These attempts have
included letters, phone calls and visits to
Zschau's Washington and Sunnyvale
offices.
But Zschau has stood firm, convinced,
speculates Mattox, by a report issued last
April by the Scowcroft Commission ap
pointed by the President. The report claims
that deployment of the MX and Midgetman
missies is a necessary prerequisite for arms
control.
Scott Elrod, a graduate student in applied
physics and an anti-nuclear activist,
believes Zschau was also persuaded by Ed
ward Rowny, chief U.S. negotiator at the
START talks. "Rowny said we need the MX
as a bargaining chip, as something to give
away in the negotiations," Elrod said.

Elrod said he opposes the deployment ot
the MX as a weapon only to be bargained
away. "Unfortunately, we've had other
cases like that â€” the MIRV (multiple inde
pendently targetable re-entry vehicle), tor
instance. My understanding is that Henrv
Kissinger had the same attitude about the
MIRV as being a bargaining chip. Now both
we and the Soviets have the MIRV, and it's
one of the most destabilizing elements of
both arsenals."
The MX is a highly accurate missile whose
ostensible target, if used in a first strike,
would be Soviet missile silos. Such a high
degree of accuracy is not needed in missiles
aimed at cities.
Elrod said he thinks deployment of such a
missile is a destabilizing risk rather than a
bargaining asset. "The MX threatens their
hard targets, missle silos predominantly,
but it is no enhancement of our security to
put (the Soviets) in a situation where they
feel more vulnerable."
In defending the MX, Zschau has often
quoted Soviet Nobel Peace Prize winner
Andrei Sakharov, who wrote that since the
Soviets have "a great advantage" in
"powerful silo-based missies," then
"perhaps talks about the limitation and re
duction of these most powerful missies
could become easier if the United States
were to have MX missies, albeit only poten
tially." Sakharov expressed this view in an
open letter to Drell.
