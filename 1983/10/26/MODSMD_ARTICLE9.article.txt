# Candidate removes signs
## 
### SAM DELSON 
Palo Alto City Council candidate Cas
sandra Moore has removed more than 20 of
her campaign signs from public property in
residential neighborhoods, bringing her
month-long legal battle with the city to an
end.
The placement of the signs had violated
provisions of a city ordinance, but Moore
took the city to court, contending that the
sign law violated the First Amendment.
Moore said the signs themselves were
unimportant, but she decided to contest the
city ordinance "in order to uphold the prin
ciple at stake."
She acknowledged that "a significant
number of Palo Altans feel that my signs are
not appropriate," and added, "We must be
. . . sensitive to what will make Palo Alto a
pleasing place to live."
Approximately 300 Moore signs remain
posted in areas which are not on public
property in residential neighborhoods.

Moore said she removed other signs
during the weekend because she has
already proven her point about violation of
the First Amendment. She said her "legal
and constitutional stance has been vind
icated in the courts."
City Attorney Diane Lee was happy with
the removal of the posters, but she disputed
Moore's claim that the right to post the signs
had been upheld by the courts. She said the
city had achieved its goal of getting the
posters down and had saved the taxpayers
money by avoiding further legal wrangling.
Lee suspended efforts to force removal of
the signs on Oct. 17. At the time, she said
the issue would be settled by the U.S. Su
preme Court when it renders a decision in
Vincent vs. Los Angeles, a case that involves
a similar election sign ordinance.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule on
the Los Angeles case before the end of the
year.
