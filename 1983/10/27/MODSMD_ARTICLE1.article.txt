# Are tickets this valuable?

Students eager for Big Game
Gaieties tickets decided to beat
the expected rush by sleeping
overnight in the Old Firehouse.
Tickets went on sale at 2 p.m.
yesterday and many people
were there as early as 9 p.m.
Tuesday night. Later in the day,
some hearty souls sunned them
selves in front of the Old
Firehouse. Shows will be given
during Big Game week on
Thursday night, Friday after
noon and Friday night. Tickets
for Friday night's performance,
by far the most popular of the
three, sold out within half an
hour. After the final show,
there will be a pep rally in San
Francisco as the Cardinal revs
up for its clash with Cal.
