# Mem Chu's Caughey won't stop talking
## 
### BOBAN MATHEW 
When a minister otters a
sermon called "Worshipping
American," you have to
wonder. Church and state and
politics and religion don't mix,
they say. But Donald Caughey
isn't apologizing.
Caughey is the assistant
dean of the Chapel in
Memorial Church. He has
served Stanford in that
capacity since September of
1979.
As assistant dean, he has
worked to expand the ministry
of Memorial Church to the
professional schools at Stan
ford, since these schools tend
to be isolated from the rest of
the Stanford community. He
also works with the shared
ecumenical programs at here.
Within this ministry, he and
others work to advance the
causes of justice and peace in
all areas of the world, espe
cially in South Africa and
Central America.
It's partly because of this
work that many consider
Caughey to be perhaps a little
too outspoken politically. This
past summer, he and Ted Har
wood, a Hoover Fellow, were
engaged in a debate regarding
the Hoover controversy.
On that issue, Caughey
maintains that the discussion
of academic freedom is a
"rather sterile argument." He
says he approaches the issue
by trying to answer the ques
tion of why Hoover thrives
while groups at the other end
of the political spectrum
struggle to exist.
Very few people here, he
says, are willing to address

questions of conscience and
human quality." He wishes
that more faculty members
would speak out on such is
sues, and says that his own
comments are all the more
conspicuous when they don t.
He also said that he sees no
conflict between his political
frankness and his role as a
minister. He maintains that is
sues of "morality and ethics'
are an essential part of real life
that people should evaluate
One of Caughey's main in
terests is American religious
history — especially because it
is his own religious heritage.
Caughey believes that many <>t
the political myths today have
religious roots. The super
power myth in which America
is to be the strongest nation
on earth, is the result of the
belief that America is a chosen
country blessed by Cod, he
claims.
He asserts that the nuclear
arms race hn«; forced many
Americans to realize that
nations cannot live without
each other and that they do
have common futures. The
one reason why nations
haven't taken advantage of
this situation, according to
Caughey, is that they "fear
peace" since they associate
peace with loss of power.
Caughey feels that it is
redemptive to examine one's
society in a critical fashion. He
believes that it is especially
true in our society where
"truth is devalued in TV com
mercials and politics has
become nothing but public re
lations." A democracy such as
ours, Caughey insists, needs
to be nurtured.
