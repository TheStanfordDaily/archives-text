# Nuclear reactors? Here? At Stanford?
## 
### 
Judging from the number of
inquiries I've received this
quarter concerning this
week's subject, I have come to
the conclusion that the
definitive answer provided by
Bug Me's own Mike Hale last
year deserves a reprint, if only
to prevent another epidemic
of melt-down hysteria. So
without further ado we pres
ent a Bug Me classic: Mike
Hale's Nuclear Reactors at
Stanford.
If you walk out Stanford Av-

Bug Me

enue past Peter Coutts Road,
almost to Raimundo Way, you
can't miss the big gray barn.
It's huge, for one thing, very
ugly, for another, and it has a
great view of the foothills.
Since 1973, nothing in particu
lar has been done with the
building — it's used for
storage, and some members
of the Art Department have
private studios there. The ac
tion in the barn used to be a
little hotter, though. From
1959 to 1973, it was the home
for a working nuclear reactor.
The building is still called
the Ryan Lab, a name which
goes back to the days when
Prof. Harris Ryan did electrical
engineering research there.
Then it was used for electrical
research by a private compa
ny. In 1959, Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. George Leppert
brought the reactor to
campus. At that time the
Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC) ran a fellowship pro
gram for the training of nu
clear engineers at universities.
With fellowship money from
the AEC, a grant from the Na
tional Science Foundation for
construction, and fuel loaned
by the government, the Nu
clear Engineering Division of
the Mechanical Engineering
Department was in business.
, .The reactor was an extreme
ly low power one, and it was
started up only when needed
for specific projects.
Compared to a power reactor
(one used for the production

of electricity) which might
operate at 1000 megawatts,
Stanford's reactor was a meas
ly 10-kilowatt job. The reactor
was operated by students,
who after a year in the pro
gram could be licensed by the
AEC.
It was never used for power
purposes, of course, just
teaching and research. Accor
ding to Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. Rudolph Sher, one of
the directors of the experi
mental program at the reactor

(and my source for the above),
the doctoral students in the
program went into research or
management in the industry
or government labs, while the
master's students generally
became plant engineers at nu
clear power plants. There are
one or two Stanford grads
working now at Diablo Can
yon, he said.
According to Sher, the pres
ence of the reactor never drew
any serious protest, not even
during the height of anti-war,
anti-military activism. He spec
ulates that the reactor's loca
tion, in an area considered
"off-campus" by students,
kept it out ol the public mind.
The Stanford police warned
the M.E. Department at one
point that students were plan
ning a march on the reactor,
but the march never
materialized.
Several events came to
gether in 1973 that forced the
shutdown of the reactor: The
AEC terminated the fellowship
program; the University had
budget problems; and the
low-power reactor gradually
became un< ompetative in a
research scene which
demanded more and more
powerful reactors. The fuel on
hand was shipped to Idaho,
and the console and control
rod drives were shipped to the
nuclear museum in Oak
Ridge, Tennessee, where you
can see them today in a
working-model reactor.
That wasn't the end of the
story, though. For the last 11

years, the University has been
trying to get the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC)
to certify the Ryan Lab for gen
eral use, a process known as
"decommissioning." Still in
the building is the shield that
housed the reactor core — a
24-foot tall, eight-foot thick
concrete tank — and at the
bottom of the tank, right
below where the reactor used
to be, the radiation is still
above legal levels.
According to John Holmes,
a senior health physicist in the
Office of Risk Management,
an area isn't considered safe
until a person could live there,
24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
safely. The legal limit for gen

eral use is 10 millirems of radi
ation above background
levels; the current level at the
bottom of the tank (but
nowhere else in the building)
is 35 millirems above back
ground. (Background radia
tion is about 100 millirems.)
Holmes said this level
compares to what you would
get from living continuously in
front of a color television set.
Holmes said he feels the
decommissioning is "99 per
cent" complete, but he would
have said the same three years
ago. In the meantime, the Uni
versity is paying the NRC a
$100 "indemnity fee" each
year until the building is cer
tified.

If you walk out Stanford Av-

Bug Me

enue past Peter Coutts Road,
almost to Raimundo Way, you
can't miss the big gray barn.
It's huge, for one thing, very
ugly, for another, and it has a
great view of the foothills.
Since 1973, nothing in particu
lar has been done with the
building — it's used for
storage, and some members
of the Art Department have
private studios there. The ac
tion in the barn used to be a
little hotter, though. From
1959 to 1973, it was the home
for a working nuclear reactor.
The building is still called
the Ryan Lab, a name which
goes back to the days when
Prof. Harris Ryan did electrical
engineering research there.
Then it was used for electrical
research by a private compa
ny. In 1959, Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. George Leppert
brought the reactor to
campus. At that time the
Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC) ran a fellowship pro
gram for the training of nu
clear engineers at universities.
With fellowship money from
the AEC, a grant from the Na
tional Science Foundation for
construction, and fuel loaned
by the government, the Nu
clear Engineering Division of
the Mechanical Engineering
Department was in business.
, .The reactor was an extreme
ly low power one, and it was
started up only when needed
for specific projects.
Compared to a power reactor
(one used for the production

of electricity) which might
operate at 1000 megawatts,
Stanford's reactor was a meas
ly 10-kilowatt job. The reactor
was operated by students,
who after a year in the pro
gram could be licensed by the
AEC.
It was never used for power
purposes, of course, just
teaching and research. Accor
ding to Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. Rudolph Sher, one of
the directors of the experi
mental program at the reactor

(and my source for the above),
the doctoral students in the
program went into research or
management in the industry
or government labs, while the
master's students generally
became plant engineers at nu
clear power plants. There are
one or two Stanford grads
working now at Diablo Can
yon, he said.
According to Sher, the pres
ence of the reactor never drew
any serious protest, not even
during the height of anti-war,
anti-military activism. He spec
ulates that the reactor's loca
tion, in an area considered
"off-campus" by students,
kept it out ol the public mind.
The Stanford police warned
the M.E. Department at one
point that students were plan
ning a march on the reactor,
but the march never
materialized.
Several events came to
gether in 1973 that forced the
shutdown of the reactor: The
AEC terminated the fellowship
program; the University had
budget problems; and the
low-power reactor gradually
became un< ompetative in a
research scene which
demanded more and more
powerful reactors. The fuel on
hand was shipped to Idaho,
and the console and control
rod drives were shipped to the
nuclear museum in Oak
Ridge, Tennessee, where you
can see them today in a
working-model reactor.
That wasn't the end of the
story, though. For the last 11

years, the University has been
trying to get the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC)
to certify the Ryan Lab for gen
eral use, a process known as
"decommissioning." Still in
the building is the shield that
housed the reactor core — a
24-foot tall, eight-foot thick
concrete tank — and at the
bottom of the tank, right
below where the reactor used
to be, the radiation is still
above legal levels.
According to John Holmes,
a senior health physicist in the
Office of Risk Management,
an area isn't considered safe
until a person could live there,
24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
safely. The legal limit for gen

eral use is 10 millirems of radi
ation above background
levels; the current level at the
bottom of the tank (but
nowhere else in the building)
is 35 millirems above back
ground. (Background radia
tion is about 100 millirems.)
Holmes said this level
compares to what you would
get from living continuously in
front of a color television set.
Holmes said he feels the
decommissioning is "99 per
cent" complete, but he would
have said the same three years
ago. In the meantime, the Uni
versity is paying the NRC a
$100 "indemnity fee" each
year until the building is cer
tified.

Judging from the number of
inquiries I've received this
quarter concerning this
week's subject, I have come to
the conclusion that the
definitive answer provided by
Bug Me's own Mike Hale last
year deserves a reprint, if only
to prevent another epidemic
of melt-down hysteria. So
without further ado we pres
ent a Bug Me classic: Mike
Hale's Nuclear Reactors at
Stanford.
