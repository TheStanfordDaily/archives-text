While preparing for the Daily's new computer system recently, Daily
photography editors discovered a box of photographs from the early
19505. These old photographs, taken with four-by-five cameras, provide a
slightly different view of both the campus and the campus community.
Starting today, the Daily will run one of these photos every Thursday. In

this shot, taken from Hoover Tower sometime between 1V49 and 1954,
Stern Hall and Crothers Hall are visible, but Crothers Memorial, Wilbur
Hall Estondido Village, the Cowell Cluster and Mirrieles are only plans
tor the future. Crothers Memorial wasn't completed until 1955, followed
by Wilbur Hall in 1956.
