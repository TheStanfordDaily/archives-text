Tuesday, two days after we, as Americans,
were stunned by the death of more than 200
men representing our country in Lebanon, we
were dumbfounded to learn that our president
had taken the offensive in a small island off the
coast of South America.
Forecasts that the United States would
invade — a word not preceded by our
country's name in more than a decade —
Grenada had been hiding under the surface,
behind huge headlines announcing numbers
of dead Marines and sailors, lying just low
enough that most people were taken b>
surprise.
By first reports, President Reagan had set
skeletal plans for the raid while golfing Satur
day in Georgia with Secretary of State George
Shultz, who had been awakened at 2:45 a.m.
that day with an urgent message that several
Caribbean nations were worried about vio
lence on Grenada. The next day's tragedy in
the Middle East then provided the perfect set
ting — a meeting with the National Security
Council in the White House basement's Situa
tion Room — for the president to firm up his
military decision.
Yesterday, however, State Department offi
cials countered the first accounts of the presi
dent's decision-making scenario, protesting
that Reagan had planned the invasion a week
ago. The administration may be attempting to
take the suspected political motives out of the
decision to attack. A quick speculation was that
the president, faced with his first major foreign
policy crisis, scrambled to preserve confidence
in his administration by showing strength in a
country that was, in his eyes, in danger of be

coming a communist satellite in the wake of
Prime Minister Maurice Bishop's death in a
bloody coup.
If the decision to go into Grenada was a poli
tical one, it can only be said that Reagan was
uncharacteristically rot playing skillfully. The
president has, in the course of only a few days,
turned the country's foreign policy into min
cemeat.
Since the invasion, the United States has
been condemned from nearly everv corner of
the globe. Even England's Margaret Thatcher
could not defend Reagan's actior before an
emergency session of Parliament. And under
standably so. No one can be expect d to
defend a violent action which is at best shakil>
justified by a little-known treaty.
Key administration officials explain that the
1900 troops were sent into Grenada because of
worries that the 1000 Americans there — most
of whom are medical students — were in a sit
uation that was likely to turn into a second
Iranian hostage crisis. The true extent of the
danger in Grenada and the Americans'
freedom to leave the island before the troops
came in is not now, and may never be, known.
But being in the middle of a war can cert, 'ily
be only somewhat more pleasant than si' ing
prisoner in a battered embassy compound
At a time when the United States has fo ces
covering troubled spots from the Caribbean to
the Persian Gulf, and is not without enemies in
the Philippines and Korea, not to mention the
anti-nuclear sectors of Western Europe,
Reagan needs to stop fighting and start talking.
Otherwise this country may soon be held
hostage by the rest of the world.
