Cashing in . . .
I see that you have again chosen
to put in your two cents worth in
favor of non-refundable fee assess
ments (Daily, Oct. 24). As I dislike
pointing out the obvious, I will only
mention in passing that The Daily
— invariably one of the major
recipients of fee assessments —
stands to gain quite a bit of money,
should they be made non
refundable.
You state that the argument that
the present system allows one to
take one's money from groups with
which one has "violent philosophi
es] differences" is not a sufficient
justification, that these differences
are better expressed at the ballot
box. That is self-serving-hogwash.
There is no group on campus that
deserves my money if I don't want
to give them any, even if 20 percent
of the student body says they have
a right to take it. I leave my money
with those groups that I think have
provided me or will provide me
with some benefit, and I see no
moral justification for using the
power that the University exerts at
registration time in order to force
me to fund any other group.
However, if it be deemed that the
present system need improvement,
I propose the following system to
replace it: Each spring, the ASSU
shall follow the current system for
approving organizations to be
placed on the fee assessment bal
lot. Instead of holding an election,
however, tables will be set up at the
usual polling places to accept dona
tions to the groups that won ap
proval from the ASSU Senate.
Needless to say, I do not think
that this system will ever be
adopted. It is designed to keep the
great mass of students who care
very little about most fee assess
ments from giving money, while
the present system is geared
towards taking money away from
these very students, and making it
inconvenient for them to get it
back. I would submit, however,
that taking money from people who
might not want to give it to you is
not far removed from theft, even if
those people do not care enough tc
try to recover the funds.

.. .on fee refunds
The Daily suggests that no fee
assessment refunds would have
"great finanical results," "No more
cashing in," (Daily, Oct. 24). I con
cur, great financial results — not for
everyone, but certainly for The
Daily. Let me explain.
When students vote for an or
ganization to receive a fee assess
ment they are saying that the or
ganization is a desirable component
of the Stanford community. They
are not necessarily saying that the
organization provides them, as
individuals, with any particular
service. For example, I voted for
the Graduate Student Association,
but as an undergraduate, I do not
expect to attend any of its func
tions. The status quo system allows
me, thus, to vote for the GSA, but
collect my fee refund.
Other organizations such as The
Daily provide services utilized by
almost every member of the Stan
ford community. Such organiza
tions have little to fear when fee
assessment elections come up.
People vote for organizations they
use. But if one can't get a fee as
sessment refund, one is less prone
to vote for the fee assessement of
an organization that one sees as a
positive element, but one that isn't
personally put to use.

Speak out on abortion
In his column of Oct. 18, "A
quiet look at abortion," Spencer
Klein describes quite fairly the
various social, emotional, economic
and religious issues surrounding
abortion. He fails, however, to
present the ultimate question — Is
the unborn child human?
If not, then we can rationally
discuss these issues as determining
factors in the choice of whether or
not to abort.
If so, then these issues fade
before the decision to destroy or
support life. If so, then we have
chosen to kill in the last 10 years
more than 15 million helpless,
innocent children. In this country,
more babies are dying each year by
abortion than all Americans killed
in all our wars.

We should not take a "quiet look
at abortion, " we must speak out for
the rights of those who cannot
speak for themselves.

I'd like to thank Scott Arey for
reminding us "hoity toity" Palo
Altans just how despicable we
really are. It's been a long time
since a native New Yorker graced
the review section of The Daily
with his enlightening and revealing
criticism of the people he has
forced himself to live with.
I imagine this is because most
native New Yorkers are content to
espouse their views at small hap
penings with other New Yorkers
who drink plain water from their
hands (so as not to seem elegant)
and wonder why their fathers
didn't marry their mothers.

you may end up smashing your

But I'm really fond of my car, and
I'd hate to see it scratched or

funny about me getting involved in

of the student body says they have
a right to take it. I leave my money
with those groups that I think have
provided me or will provide me
with some benefit, and I see no
moral justification for using the
power that the University exerts at
registration time in order to force
me to fund any other group.
However, if it be deemed that the
present system need improvement,
I propose the following system to
replace it: Each spring, the ASSU
shall follow the current system for
approving organizations to be
placed on the fee assessment bal
lot. Instead of holding an election,
however, tables will be set up at the
usual polling places to accept dona
tions to the groups that won ap
proval from the ASSU Senate.
Needless to say, I do not think
that this system will ever be
adopted. It is designed to keep the
great mass of students who care
very little about most fee assess
ments from giving money, while
the present system is geared
towards taking money away from
these very students, and making it
inconvenient for them to get it
back. I would submit, however,
that taking money from people who
might not want to give it to you is
not far removed from theft, even if
those people do not care enough tc
try to recover the funds.

.. .on fee refunds
The Daily suggests that no fee
assessment refunds would have
"great finanical results," "No more
cashing in," (Daily, Oct. 24). I con
cur, great financial results — not for
everyone, but certainly for The
Daily. Let me explain.
When students vote for an or
ganization to receive a fee assess
ment they are saying that the or
ganization is a desirable component
of the Stanford community. They
are not necessarily saying that the
organization provides them, as
individuals, with any particular
service. For example, I voted for
the Graduate Student Association,
but as an undergraduate, I do not
expect to attend any of its func
tions. The status quo system allows
me, thus, to vote for the GSA, but
collect my fee refund.
Other organizations such as The
Daily provide services utilized by
almost every member of the Stan
ford community. Such organiza
tions have little to fear when fee
assessment elections come up.
People vote for organizations they
use. But if one can't get a fee as
sessment refund, one is less prone
to vote for the fee assessement of
an organization that one sees as a
positive element, but one that isn't
personally put to use.

Speak out on abortion
In his column of Oct. 18, "A
quiet look at abortion," Spencer
Klein describes quite fairly the
various social, emotional, economic
and religious issues surrounding
abortion. He fails, however, to
present the ultimate question — Is
the unborn child human?
If not, then we can rationally
discuss these issues as determining
factors in the choice of whether or
not to abort.
If so, then these issues fade
before the decision to destroy or
support life. If so, then we have
chosen to kill in the last 10 years
more than 15 million helpless,
innocent children. In this country,
more babies are dying each year by
abortion than all Americans killed
in all our wars.

We should not take a "quiet look
at abortion, " we must speak out for
the rights of those who cannot
speak for themselves.

I'd like to thank Scott Arey for
reminding us "hoity toity" Palo
Altans just how despicable we
really are. It's been a long time
since a native New Yorker graced
the review section of The Daily
with his enlightening and revealing
criticism of the people he has
forced himself to live with.
I imagine this is because most
native New Yorkers are content to
espouse their views at small hap
penings with other New Yorkers
who drink plain water from their
hands (so as not to seem elegant)
and wonder why their fathers
didn't marry their mothers.

Bicycles, stop!
Although I have only been on
campus for a short time, I have
alreadv noticed a disturbing habit
that Tord bit yclists have ai
quired. They don't stop for stop
signs. I know wh t 1 n'-o <» ' '
now. You're thinking, " 1 hat s all
very nice, Steve, but I do have the
rest A The Daily to read, so could
you please make your point?" Glad
ly-
I'm sure that you all know that
you may end up smashing your
bike to bits, but that's not my
point. And I don't really care if all
of your bodily parts end up scat
tered all over the road. I can take it.
But I'm really fond of my car, and
I'd hate to see it scratched or
dented. And my insurance agent is
funny about me getting involved in
accidents — it upsets him no end.
So please, for the sake of my
car's finish, and for the sake of my
insurance agent's peace of mind
(he really is a great guy), stop at
those eight-sided signs that say
"STOP."

Cashing in . . .
I see that you have again chosen
to put in your two cents worth in
favor of non-refundable fee assess
ments (Daily, Oct. 24). As I dislike
pointing out the obvious, I will only
mention in passing that The Daily
— invariably one of the major
recipients of fee assessments —
stands to gain quite a bit of money,
should they be made non
refundable.
You state that the argument that
the present system allows one to
take one's money from groups with
which one has "violent philosophi
es] differences" is not a sufficient
justification, that these differences
are better expressed at the ballot
box. That is self-serving-hogwash.
There is no group on campus that
deserves my money if I don't want
to give them any, even if 20 percent
of the student body says they have
a right to take it. I leave my money
with those groups that I think have
