# Leon Dayan Midnight Ramblings
## Creativity and Soviet 'news' 
### 
I never appreciated the poetic precision of the Pravda
polemic or the understated elegance of Tass reporting
until I started writing this biweekly column. While I
rnly have to make up facts every two weeks, there are
oviet writers who must do it every day.
The success of these writers in producing quality fic
tion day-in and day-out has to be attributed not only to
their individual prowess with the pen, but also to the
system under which they work. The manpower,
creativity and organization that goes into the system is
awe-inspiring and may explain why most Russians have
never heard of a toastei oven.
!n my quest to find out more ahoi't the workings of
the Soviet propaganda machine, I first decided to con
sult a local Kremlinologist. After a little effort, I found
one in the Yellow Pages under "Scientists, Occult." He
didn't help me too much so I took an imaginative leap
to the Soviet Union and found myself at the Depart
ment of Propaganda.
The elite of the Soviet news manufacturers work
here, for it is at Agitp' p (the still-familiar acronym for
the old Department 112 Agitation and Propaganda)
where intelligence agents inform propaganda members
of the facts so that they may create better fiction.
The writers at Agitprop are all loyal members of the
Communist party, kept loyal by the prospect of great
material rewards. A top-notch Soviet journalist who
never strays from the party line is treated almost as well
as a good Soviet athlete, enjoying the fringe benefits 90
percent of the population must do without, such as
toilet paper for the whole family.
I was excited at the prospect of meeting some great
Soviet journalists and perhaps learning a few of their
literary techniques, but I soon became disillusioned. I
discovered that the brilliant articles which appear in
Tass are more the product of a standard operating pro
cedure than the kind of individual genius that won
Janet Cooke the Pulitzer Prize in 1981 for her dramatic
(but falsified) account of an eight-year-old heroin ad
dict.
I found out about this standard procedure from the
Manager of International Propaganda, an imposing
man with imposing tobacco breath. Unintimidated, I
asked him if he could answer a few questions.

At first, he seemed reluctant to talk, but he loosened
up after a few rounds ot chess and vodka. He then told
me about the procedure.
"To denounce American actions, we quote American
sources. That way we look more moderate to the
world. Everyone knows The Washington Post isn t pro-
Communist, so if we find a Post editorial that criticizes
American policy, we can quote it and still look fair. We
can't do this all the time. Some controversies unite
liberals and conservatives, in which case The Post is
useless and we have to find an American source further
to the left."
lit; put away diioiiiet shot of Stoii and continued.
"For example, Larry Flynt, your famous pornographer,
recently ran an ad in the I .A. Times condemning U.S.
foreign policy which we found useful. We don't like to
use that kind of source, but sometimes we must.
"When even your pornographers don't see it our
way, we have to resort to quoting your professors. But
we only do that when we are really desperate, as in the
first few davs after the Korean Airliner incident, when
we weren't >-.ire what to say. Instead we relied on a c er
tain revisior :st historian at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology who was convinced the incident was a
U.S. ploy to end the peace movement.
I jokingly asked the Soviet official if Tass was inter
ested in hiring the professor.
He replied, "Why hire him if we can have him lor
free?"
The Russian "man in the street," must find this all
rather confusing. After years of schooling which taught
him that Western bourgeois media are nothing more
than propagandists for. imperialist policy and subver
sion of socialism, suddenly he finds that the American
press has broken free of its Pentagon stranglehold to
side with the Soviet Union in its time of need.
Will the man in the street write a letter to Pra\da
demanding an explanation of this contradiction?
Unlikely. He'll probably just save the newspaper in
case he runs out of toilet paper and thank Cod there is
never a shortage of vodka.
