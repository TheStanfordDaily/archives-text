## MX missile tops nuclear scare

In less than a m.inth the Defense

the final and most important step in
the series of congressional decisions
which precede the actual produc
tion and deployment of United
States weapons systems. As such, it
represents a rare opportunity for
Congress and the American people
to significantly influence U.S.
defense policy.
Buried and nearly forgotten
beneath the mounds of paperwork
and billions of dollars in expendi
tures in ihe Appropriations Bill are a
number of highly controversial and
potentially destabilizing weapons —
binary chemical nerve gas, the B-l
bomber and President Reagan's
"star wars" anti-satellite technol
ogy.
Among these weapons, however,
the MX missile poses by far the
gravest threat to world peace.
The MX missile program was con
ceived nearly a decade ago when

Minuteman 111 missiles. Delense De
partment officials urgued that an ef
fects deterrent strategy required
the maintenance of a nuclear arse
nal capable of surviving a Soviet first
strike. Possessing such a force, they
argued, would enable the U.S. to
threaten the Soviet Union with a
retaliatory strike so devastating as to
make it highly unlikely that the
Soviets would ever launch a
preemptive first strike.
From its inception, the MX missile
program was intended to be the
foundation for a modernized U.S.
deterrence force. The proponents
of the MX argued that survivability
in the missile — and hence ef
fectiveness as a deterrence weapon
— could be ensured by finding an
effective basing mode.
Today the terms "dense-pack,"
"super-hardened silos," and
"racetrack basing" serve to remind
the public that the U.S. government
has not yet devised an acceptable
solution to the basing problem. In
fact, the Reagan administration no
longer speaks of developing a new
basing mode, but argues instead
that the MX can be an effective
deterrent when deployed in exist
ing, vulnerable Minuteman 111 silos.
The U.S. Air Force in a report
dated September 15, 1982, had the
following to say regarding the sur
vivability of the MX: "It does not
provide the required pre-launch
survivability to withstand a Soviet
first strike and promote strategic
stability." The Congressional
Budget Office concurred, estimat
ing that only 10 percent of the MXs
would survive a Soviet first strike in
1990, and less than 5 percent in 1996.
In testimony before the Senate
Armed Services Committee in April
of this year. Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff General John Vessey
stated: "If we rode out the attack,
probably 30 percent would survive
today."

Vet, the Scowcroft Commission,
established by President Reagan to
evaluate the MX missile, completely
rejects the argument that the MX
can function as a deterrent if
deployed in existing silos.
In fact, the commission argues
that the MX would dramatically in
crease the chances of a nuclear con
flict.
Because of its large number of ex
tremely accurate and powerful war
heads, the MX would, if deployed,
make the Soviets own missiles vul
nerable to a first strike by the U.S.
Consequently, the report states, the
Soviet Union would be forced to
move to a "launch on warning"
policy, "or worst yet, to fire first in
the belief, however inaccurate, that
(it) is about to be attacked."
In turn, the MX's own vulnerability
would force the U.S. to move to a
launch on warning policy, a "use it
or lose it" philosophy. In sum, the
report says the MX's "combination
of threat and vulnerability gives
credence to the Soviet suspicion
that it is not a deterrent weapon at
all but a weapon designed for a first
strike...(the) MX meets perfectly the
definition of a destabilizing weap
ons system."
Not only is the MX not a deter
rent, it is a destabilizing first-strike
weapon. The existence of the MX
missile during a crisis such as the
recent downing of the Korean
Airlines plane might very well have
led to a far more dangerous ex
change between the two super
powers that the one of words which
occurred.
In a world already perched on the
edge of nuclear disaster, can the
United States afford to take one
more step in the wrong direction?

From its inception, the MX missile
program was intended to be the
foundation for a modernized U.S.
deterrence force. The proponents
of the MX argued that survivability
in the missile — and hence ef
fectiveness as a deterrence weapon
— could be ensured by finding an
effective basing mode.
Today the terms "dense-pack,"
"super-hardened silos," and
"racetrack basing" serve to remind
the public that the U.S. government
has not yet devised an acceptable
solution to the basing problem. In
fact, the Reagan administration no
longer speaks of developing a new
basing mode, but argues instead
that the MX can be an effective
deterrent when deployed in exist
ing, vulnerable Minuteman 111 silos.
The U.S. Air Force in a report
dated September 15, 1982, had the
following to say regarding the sur
vivability of the MX: "It does not
provide the required pre-launch
survivability to withstand a Soviet
first strike and promote strategic
stability." The Congressional
Budget Office concurred, estimat
ing that only 10 percent of the MXs
would survive a Soviet first strike in
1990, and less than 5 percent in 1996.
In testimony before the Senate
Armed Services Committee in April
of this year. Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff General John Vessey
stated: "If we rode out the attack,
probably 30 percent would survive
today."

Vet, the Scowcroft Commission,
established by President Reagan to
evaluate the MX missile, completely
rejects the argument that the MX
can function as a deterrent if
deployed in existing silos.
In fact, the commission argues
that the MX would dramatically in
crease the chances of a nuclear con
flict.
Because of its large number of ex
tremely accurate and powerful war
heads, the MX would, if deployed,
make the Soviets own missiles vul
nerable to a first strike by the U.S.
Consequently, the report states, the
Soviet Union would be forced to
move to a "launch on warning"
policy, "or worst yet, to fire first in
the belief, however inaccurate, that
(it) is about to be attacked."
In turn, the MX's own vulnerability
would force the U.S. to move to a
launch on warning policy, a "use it
or lose it" philosophy. In sum, the
report says the MX's "combination
of threat and vulnerability gives
credence to the Soviet suspicion
that it is not a deterrent weapon at
all but a weapon designed for a first
strike...(the) MX meets perfectly the
definition of a destabilizing weap
ons system."
Not only is the MX not a deter
rent, it is a destabilizing first-strike
weapon. The existence of the MX
missile during a crisis such as the
recent downing of the Korean
Airlines plane might very well have
led to a far more dangerous ex

In less than a m.inth the Defense
Appropriations Bill will come before

the final and most important step in
the series of congressional decisions
which precede the actual produc
tion and deployment of United
States weapons systems. As such, it
represents a rare opportunity for
Congress and the American people
to significantly influence U.S.
defense policy.
Buried and nearly forgotten
beneath the mounds of paperwork
and billions of dollars in expendi
tures in ihe Appropriations Bill are a
number of highly controversial and
potentially destabilizing weapons —
binary chemical nerve gas, the B-l
bomber and President Reagan's
"star wars" anti-satellite technol
ogy.
Among these weapons, however,
the MX missile poses by far the
gravest threat to world peace.
The MX missile program was con
ceived nearly a decade ago when

Minuteman 111 missiles. Delense De
partment officials urgued that an ef
fects deterrent strategy required
the maintenance of a nuclear arse
nal capable of surviving a Soviet first
strike. Possessing such a force, they
argued, would enable the U.S. to
threaten the Soviet Union with a
retaliatory strike so devastating as to
make it highly unlikely that the
Soviets would ever launch a
preemptive first strike.
