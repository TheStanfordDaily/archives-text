# ROTC uses classtime for recognition push
## 
### SHIRISH DATE 
As a substitute for required clas
stime, Stanford members of the Air
Force Reserve Officer Training
Corps are lobbying to bring the
ROTC back to campus.
Four Stanford students are trying
to recruit support at local high
schools and on campus as part of a
program to convince University offi
cials to allow the teaching of ROTC
military science courses at Stanford.
The ROTC has not been allowed to
teach such courses for credit here
for the last 10 years.
Stanford's ROTC program here
was discontinued for a variety of
reasons including widespread oppo
sition to the Vietnam war.Faculty
and students argued that military
training courses are inferior in aca
demic and analytic content to other
courses here. They also said they
had ethical problems with teaching
military science in a University set
ting.
Seniors Bill Hook, Bill Ashby, and
Steve Widtfeldt and junior Erik En
gebreth, are doing what could be
called "outside classroom officer
training" as part of their ROTC re
quirements because of conflicts
arising from Stanford and San lose
State University's differing
schedules.
Because Stanford doesn't have its
own program, Air Force ROTC stu
dents here are cross-enrolled at San
Jose State. Cadets must go to San
Jose every Thursday morning from 8
a.m. to 10:20 a.m. to attend a class
in military science and a "leadership
lab."
For freshmen and sophomores,
this consists of drilling in military
skiiis including marching. Juniors
and seniors participate in inspec
tions, briefings, and outside instruc

tion including guest lectures from
military officials. Upperclassmen
must attend military science class
Tuesday mornings in addition to
Thursdays.
The morning instruction poses
conflicts to commuting students be
cause it means they cannot take
morning classes at Stanford that
meet on Thursdays — Tuesdays and
Thursdays for upperclassmen. For
all students, particularly juniors and
seniors, this presents a problem be
cause of major and distribution re
quirements at Stanford.
None of the four was able to
schedule around their ROTC classes
this quarter. As a resuit, they made
an official agreement with their
leader, It. Col. Richard Barton, a
professor of aerospace studies at
San Jose State and the AFROTC
commander there.
In lieu of attending "leadership
lab," they recruit at high schools
and on campus and try to get
AFROTC instruction, if not credit,
back here.

Barton said the activities must be
"in the field of promoting Air Force
ROTC."
Other Stanford AFROTC students
also participate in many of these ac
tivities, but Hook, Ashby, Widtfeldt
and Engebreth are the only ones
with contractual agreements with
the Air Force.
There are 40 Stanford students en
rolled in the AFROTC program.
These recruiting attempts repre
sent a general increase in efforts to
get AFROTC classes back on
campus. Last autumn, Hook regis
tered the Stanford AFROTC mem
bers as a volunteer student organi
zation with the office of student af
fairs. The group was re-registered
this fall.
Last spring, the Stanford AFROTC
contingent undertook a letter
writing campaign to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, asking him
for a return of military science
classes to campus.
Hook spoke last winter quarter


'If they give credit for
feminist studies, they
should give credit for
military studies/
- Bill Hook
vith Robert Hamrdla, assistant to
he president, in an effort to get ad
ninistrative approval of AFROTC
jse of Stanford classroom space
/vith instructors provided by the Air
"orce.
Hamrdla told them that the Uni
t'ersity would agree to let the
courses be taught here, but the plan
fell through after the Air Force
refused to allow instruction here un
ess academic credit is given.
Hamrdla said that credited ROTC
:ould not return "until and unless
the issue came before" the Faculty
Senate and was approved there. He
added that as far as he knew, "the

question is not on their agenda."
Despite this immediate obstacle,
many AFROTC students believe the
program will return here — eventu
ally.
Bill Shadle, a senior in the
AFROTC program, said he thought a
vote taken tomorrow in the Faculty
Senate would be fairly even, and
that the reason votes haven't been
taken is because "the tar, far left" of
the faculty is discouraging ROTC
supporters who "aren't as vocal."
Hook said he doesn't understand
why other non-traditional classes
are accredited while ROTC is not.
"If they give credit for feminist
studies, they should give credit for
military studies," he remarked.
AFROTC students here are also
engaging in more activities as a
group. These include a required

timed one-and-a-half mile run that
was held last Friday and a fund
raising car wash planned for this Sat
urday.
