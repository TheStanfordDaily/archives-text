# Hoyt wins Cy Young award

### 
Chicago (AP) — After walking through
most of baseball's valleys, LaMarr Hoyt
stood at its peak yesterday, acknowl
edged as the finest pitcher in the Ameri
can League.
"The year I got called up (1980, by the
White Sox), I was ready to say, 'You'll
spend the rest of your life in the minors
and you might as well get comfortable
with it,' " Hoyt recalled yesterday at a
news conference called by the Chicago
White Sox to celebrate the right-hander's
Cy Young Award-winning season.
"But they changed me to a reliever and
it put some excitement back into the
game, made it fun again," he added.
"That was an important juncture."
The 28-year-old South Carolinan joined
the Chicago organization in 1977, a last
minute sweetener in the deal that sent
Bucky Dent to the Yankees tor Oscar
Gamble. The White Sox promptly
dropped him to Class A ball.
But in his first year with the team, he
also pitched against — and later that win

ter played for — Tony Laßussa, soon
destined to become Chicago's big-league
manager.
Hoyt patiently mastered his craft and
went 9-3 with a 4.58 earned run average in
his first major league season, working as
both starter and reliever.
He was 9-3 again the following season
— the strike year of 1981 — starting only
one of the 43 games in which he ap
peared. Then, converted to starting for
1982, he made his first big national splash
— winning his first nine games en route
to a team-record 14 consecutive victories
over two seasons.
But after a hot start, he faded to 19-15 in
1982 — one reason, perhaps, why he
tailed .to. make the ballot of a single Cy
Young voter. He also failed to make the
American League All-Star team either this
year or last.
"The thing about last year is that if you
take out my four wins in relief, I'm only a
15-15 starter. I'm not sure I would have
voted for mvself."

But this season, the streaky Hoyt went
in the opposite direction, starting out 2-6
and finishing with 15 straight victories, a
24-10 record and a 3.66 ERA.
He became the anchor ot a pitching
staff that led the White Sox to the West
Division crown, their first title of any kind
since winning the AL in 1959. They lost
the playoffs this year in four games to the
world champion Baltimore Orioles.
In 260% innings, Hoyt struck out 148
batters and walked only 31, a remarkable
average of only 1.07 walks per nine in
nings — and four of the walks were inten
tional.
But even this season was not without
problems. His wife, Sylvia, lost their baby
the night he took Ihe mound against Oak
land seeking victory No. 18, and was still
hospitalized when he faced California
looking for No. 19.
"The first was probably the hardest
game I ever pitched. It was hard keeping
my head," said Hovt. "But after those two
games, I learned what an advantage con
centrating can be."
