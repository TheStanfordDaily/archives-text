## Cardinal soccer team squeaks by Fresno Pacific 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
With 4:33 left in the game, Giancarlo Ferruzzi
fired the ball into the left corner of the net to
give the Stanford soccer team a 1-0 victory over
Fresno Pacific.
Both coaches were thinking overtime once
the clock hit the five minute mark. "We were
doing all we could to score," Fresno Pacific
Coach Ben Norton said. "But we knew that
even if we didn't score the game would go into
overtime. I was wrong."
Stanford Coach Nelson Lodge also thought
the game would go into overtime and was
confident that Stanford would score if it did.
"We were striking better than they were so the
odds were on our side," Lodge said.
Meanwhile Lodge did everything he could to
set up a scoring situation. FHe sent in player
after player to see who had the scoring touch.
"We sent in extra strikers to strengthen our
midfield," Lodge said.
Finally, on a corner kick, Lodge called center
fullback Tom McGannon to come up front on a
corner kick.
"Before the game, we threw in a new plav on
corner kicks," McGannon said. "(Walter)
Kingson told me to run toward the goalie if the
ball clears me and wait tor him to bobble the
ball."
The goalie did bobble the ball and McGan
non knocked the ball out of his hands. "I guess
I hit it with my head," McGannon added.
After McGannon disrupted the goalie, the
ball fell at the feet of Ferruzzi. Ferruzzi had an
easy shot and placed it perfectly into the cor
ner.
Fresno also had many chances but was never
able to converge. "They're lucky," Fresno's
Leon Berno said, "I hit that shot about as hard
as I could and there was no way the goalie was
going to get it if it went in."
The shot from Berno came on a free kick.
"There were only two men in Stanford's wall so
I had a lot of angle to work with," Berno said.

"But basically I just tried to surprise the goalie
with a fast shot."
The ball hit the top left corner ot the goal
post and ricocheted off the bar.
Stanford goalie Willie Burkhardt again had an
excellent game in the goal. "He saved us,"
Lodge said. Once again, Burkhardt chalked up
a shutout, his sixth of the season.
Yesterday's game was also Burkhardt's
second shutout in a row. Stanford has had to
depend more and more on the outstanding
play of Burkhardt since it lacks the sroring po
tential that it had without its injuries
"We may have been the weaker team," Nor
ton said, "But it was anybody's ball game
today." When Norton came into the game, he
thought he would have to shut down Stantord
with a strong defense.
"I knew we would get a couple of breaks on
offense," Norton said. "I didn't know we could
have concentrated offensively the whole game.
Stanford's offense wasn't as potent as I thought
it was."
Stanford has won its last two games by a
score of 1-0. Fortunately, it had held its oppo
nents effectively, but this will not work against
the strong upcoming games against Berkeley,
Fresno State and USF.
Much of the scoring punch has been lost to
injuries. The most recent injury is that to Robby
West. West, who had broken his right arm
before, fell on it in the University ot the Pacific
game.
"I had it checked out and since it wasn't
swollen and did not hurt that much, I went
home," West said. "When I got home, I tried
to wrestle with it and I noticed I had no
strength in it."
Since West chose not to have surgery he will
be lost for the season. His loss, along with that
of the other offensive power Angel Vazsquez,
will be felt all too harshly.
