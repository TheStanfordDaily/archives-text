# Adam Berns Berns Aside
## The 						lifting of a dark cloud 
### ADAM BERNS 
It all started on a dreary
day at Stanford stadium.
Coming oft an upset of No.
2 ranked Washington, the
Stanford football team was
not just looking for a bowl
bid, but a national ranking.
Then Arizona scored 28
fourth quarter points.
So the dark clouds came
in almost one year ago.
Slowly at first, but there
was no mistaking them.
The following week, it
was the same story. The
Cardinal offense came back
brilliantly to within three
points against UCLA, but
fell short.
But it was the last week
that the clouds went totally
dark.
The loss to UC-Berkeley
defied explanation, reason,
precedence, but it didn t
matter. After the Cardinal's
brilliant comeback, the 29-
yard pass completion from
Elway to Emile Harry in the
game's waning moments,
the 19-yard toss to Mike
Tolliver which followed it,
and the 35-yard field goal
by Mark Harmon with eight
seconds left, it was still a
loss.
It turned a successful
season into a nightmare.
Talk about the Hall of Fame
Bowl was replaced with
speculation about Stanford
coach Paul Wiggin quitting.
And the clouds stayed dark.
The first six games this
year brought more of the
same. The team's frustra
tion was evident.
Stanford had forgotten
how to win. It wasn't that
the players weren't trying.

It wasn't that the coaches
weren't working. The
players had simply lost
faith.
When the clouds are
dark week after week,
when you begin to think
that Murphy's Law was
written with your team in
mind, it is easy to lose faith.
Last year was a crazy one
for Stanford football. The
team could easily have won
every game, except USC.
The Big C tne was the
craziest thing of all, and it
had a snowball effect.
That's why Stanford's vic
tory against Arizona last
week was so important.
Bringing Stanford's
longest losing streak since

1960 to an end, the victory
against the Wildcats has to
be an immense psychologi
cal boost to the team. It
must make them think that
maybe fortune is a two
sided coin.
Just last week, a large
proportion of the student
bodv was talking in terms
of an 0-11 season for the
team. That has to rub off on
the players.
While it may be
premature, the attitude
around campus is chang
ing: "Well, if we can beat
Arizona, why not Oregon
State, USC, Oregon and
Cal." The football team has
to feel the same way.

Freshman quarterback
]ohn Paye, following the
Arizona game, said that one
of the key points in the
pregame speech before the
playing the Wildcats was to
go out and have tun. That
may have been Stanford's
problem. When you're
trying too hard, when
you're tight, it's easy to
make mistakes.
The football team has
been here since the end of
August, nearly a month
longer than the rest of us.
Dutifully showing up a
practice gets tiring, but you
really start to question whe
ther its worth it with an 0-6
record. While the first vic
tory doesn't turn the

season around, it is some
consolation.
Following last Saturday's
victory, Wiggin was the first
person to put the win in
perspective, noting that his
team was still l-b atter the
victory. Yet Wiggin was a
relieved man. The losing
streak had come to an end
and he was smiling.
It's nice to finally have a
sunny dav.
The teams that win every
week sometimes are often
fired up after a loss. Teams
that lose every week are
different. One doesn't get
fired up after losing nine in
a row.
One writer asked Wiggin
at his weekly press confer
ence this week i'f he
thought his team might be
overconfident for Oregon
State this Saturday. Wiggin
politelv laughed and shot
back, "I think Nebraska
might have a problem. I
hope to God that we don't
think we're so good that
we're going to just show
up."
While Stanford has the
sixth hardest schedule in
the nation according to
NCAA rankings, the last
four games are also prob
ably the easiest four.
Now that Stanford has fi
nally won a football game,
maybe the dark cloud will
drift away For th.it to hap
pen, however, Stanfoid
must look ahead with
renewed confidence.
Maybe then, the football
team will be singing a new
song.
Here comes the sun.
