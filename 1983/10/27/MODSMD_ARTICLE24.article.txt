# Referees unhappy, threaten strike

### 
Washington — The National Basketball Association and the
referees union are at such an impasse in contract negotiations
that both sides say it appears the NBA regular season will begin
Friday with substitute officials.
"I say there is no way we'll settle by Friday,' Richie Phillips,
counsel tor the National Association of Basketball Referees, said
this week. "They (the NBA) broke off negotiations last Sunday
and we haven't talked since."
The NBA, however, said it was the referees union that broke
off negotiations.
"We made them a proposal, and we were promised a coun
terproposal by Sunday, but we never got it," said Russ Granik,
general counsel for the NBA. "We told them to call us whenever
they have an offer and we're still waiting."
The old contract expired Sept. 1.
Phillips informed the NBA at the time that if an acceptable
contract wasn't reached, the referees would strike during the
regular season. As a result, the NBA locked out the officials and
replaced them with substitutes who worked the exhibition
season. Granik said the league is ready to open the regular
season with those same officials.
"They told us they would strike in the regular season if this
wasn't resolved," Granik said last week. "So we said, It you re
going to strike in the regular season, don't bother showing up
now.'
"We'd prefer the regular officials, but it we have to go with
the ones we have been using, we're satisfied with the job
they've done."
Both sides said Tuesday that they aren't near an agreement. In
fact, they could not even agree on what has been offered or why
the meetings broke off. Granik said, "We're offering each guy
under contract an average of a 27 percent increase over the next
three years, with 10 percent ot it coming in the first year."
Phillips said the increase isn't what it's made out to be.
"They're saying it's a 27 percent increase. Actually, it's only a
2.55 percent increase, and over three years, and that's less than
1 percent a year," said Phillips.
Under terms of the old contract, a first-year referee made
$24,000, a second-year official $25,500 and a third-year man
$27,501) liie NBA s proposal cails tor a second-year otficial to
earn $2b,400 and a third-year man $28,000.
A second-year official who earned $24,000 in his first year
would therefore be given a 10 percent raise, to $26,400, for this
season. But Phillips said that under the old contract he would
have been given $25,500 anyway, so the NBA's proposal is in es
sence only a 3.52 percent increase.
In the case of a 10-year man, his salary would go from the
$43,000 earned as a nine-year man to $47,300. That is a 10 per
cent raise, but under the old contract, a 10-year man would have
earned $46,500, anyway. Phillips is saying the NBA's increase, in
this case, amounts to only 1.72 percent.
The NBA does not dispute the figures.
Salaries now range from $24,000 to $65,000. Phillips said he
wants the top salary raised to $95,000. But salary is only part of
the problem.
"There are 17 issues involved and they've offered nothing but
cutbacks in every one of them," said Phillips. "There hasn't
been much progress since we started negotiations. They want
the cutbacks and they locked us out. We told them we wouldn't
strike as long as they negotiated in good faith."
The referees also want a reduction in the number of games
worked in a season.
Phillips also said the NBA has offered a flat sum of $144,000 for
referees working the playoffs. There are 89 possible playoff
games, and with three officials working each game (one as an al
ternate), that averages to $539 a referee for each game.
Last season, referees working the playoffs averaged $1240 a
game. "The NBA's contract offer is a tremendous step back
wards," said Phillips.

1 percent a year," said Phillips.
Under terms of the old contract, a first-year referee made
$24,000, a second-year official $25,500 and a third-year man
$27,501) liie NBA s proposal cails tor a second-year otficial to
earn $2b,400 and a third-year man $28,000.
A second-year official who earned $24,000 in his first year
would therefore be given a 10 percent raise, to $26,400, for this
season. But Phillips said that under the old contract he would
have been given $25,500 anyway, so the NBA's proposal is in es
sence only a 3.52 percent increase.
In the case of a 10-year man, his salary would go from the
$43,000 earned as a nine-year man to $47,300. That is a 10 per
cent raise, but under the old contract, a 10-year man would have
earned $46,500, anyway. Phillips is saying the NBA's increase, in
this case, amounts to only 1.72 percent.
The NBA does not dispute the figures.
Salaries now range from $24,000 to $65,000. Phillips said he
wants the top salary raised to $95,000. But salary is only part of
the problem.
"There are 17 issues involved and they've offered nothing but
cutbacks in every one of them," said Phillips. "There hasn't
been much progress since we started negotiations. They want
the cutbacks and they locked us out. We told them we wouldn't
strike as long as they negotiated in good faith."
The referees also want a reduction in the number of games
worked in a season.
Phillips also said the NBA has offered a flat sum of $144,000 for
referees working the playoffs. There are 89 possible playoff
games, and with three officials working each game (one as an al
ternate), that averages to $539 a referee for each game.
Last season, referees working the playoffs averaged $1240 a
game. "The NBA's contract offer is a tremendous step back
wards," said Phillips.
