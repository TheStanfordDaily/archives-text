### STEVE VINEBERG 
In Peter Weir's The Year of
living Dangerously, released
last spring, the disintegration
of a government — President
Sukarno's in Indonesia in 1965
— provided a vivid, exotic
backdrop for a love affair be
tween two journalists, played
by Mel Gibson and Sigourney
Weaver. The Year of Living
Dangerously gave off sparks,
ma. y of them because of the
pairing of these two sexy stars.
Desnite its setting the movie
was essentially a (brilliantly
ma ') romantic adventure.
T .e new Under Fire, which
is the third feature directed by
one-time editor Roger Spottis
woode, takes place in
Nic ragua in 1979, where the
activities of the rebel
Sandinistas" threaten the
American-supported regime
ol General Anastasio "Tacho"
Somoza *ene Enriquez).
The leading characters, all
finely acted, are American
journalists — Alex Grazier
(Gene Hackman), Claire
Str der (Joanna Cassidy) and
ph tographer Russell Price
(Nick Nolte) — and they share
an uneasy sexual triangle in
the midst of a terrifying civil
w But in Under Fire the
mi aland political issues
.noted in Ron Shelton and
Frohman's strong, un
sentimental script dictate the
shape of the movie.
'Jnder Fire achieves what
hssing could not: it shows us
the staggering effect America
can have on the fate of a strug
gling young country. In Mis
sing the director Costa-
Gavras' venom toward the
U.S. supplied much of the
film's dramatic energy. So
though he brought a violent,
almost Bertolucci-like poetry
to the straight state-of-siege
horror scenes, the rest of the
movie sank in the mire of the
Uame counterculture

America's-corrupt-at-the-core
platitudes some of us had
been listening to since the
'60s.
Under Fire avoids cliche
smartly by presenting the
American political influence in
its many faces: the Madison
Avenue advertising executive
engaged to improve Somoza's
image (Richard Masur), the
mercenary hopping from one
hotbed to the next (Ed Harris),
the C.I.A. agent as elegant
Parisian (Jean-Louis Trintig
nant) and the journalists them
selves, two of whom — Price
and Claire — fall in love with
the rebels' cause.
This balanced view of the
way politics works in the Third
World prepares us for the fo
cal scene of the picture, which
occurs almost at the midway
point. Somoza announces the
death of Rafael, the Sandinista
leader who has captured the
love of the Nicaraguan poor,
but Price, sensing a fraud,
takes Claire into the north in
search of the young idol.
At a rebel camp they learn
that Rafael is indeed dead, but
that if the Sandinistas can con
vince the world otherwise
they have an excellent chance
of defeating Somoza. The
belief that the president has
lied will taint his image ir
reparably, inspire Nicaraguans
to fight against him, and —
significantly — discourage the
U.S. from sending him any
further arms. So the rebels ask
Price to photograph Rafael's
corpse to look like he's still
alive. "You'll win a prize,"
Claire tells him. "I've won
enough prizes," he answers,
and she adds, "But you've
never won a war."
Spottiswoode and the
screenwriters present t ie
loaded issue of journalistic et
hics versus moral responsibil
ity with a full appreciation of

its implications; unlike the
makers of Absence of Malice,
they're not sure how everyone
should have behaved, and
they neither praise nor con
demn Price or the rebels. Yes,
the movie has a leftist bias
(and it's unfortunate that Rene
Enriquez, as Somoza, gives
the least rounded perfor
mance). But it doesn't reduce
the political content to car
toon — it forces us to respond
intellectually as well as emo
tionally. And the script is
beautifully structured so that
as the movie goes on, the
ironies layer around the core
of the focal object — the pho
tograph — as the relations of
the three protagonists
become more complicated
(Alex returns from New York,
where he has taken a
newscaster's job, to find
Claire, his old lover, deeply in
volved with Russell) and the
tension of the civil war
mounts.
Spottiswoode, a first-rate
editor (he cut Straw Dogs, Pat
Garrett and Billy the Kid and
Hard Times, among others), is
not yet a first-rate director:
Under Fire takes a little while
to get going, and some of the
early scenes are awkwardly
staged. But his touch grows
more assured as the story un
winds, and because the street
battle scenes are not gaudy or
overheated, but rather quiet,
the shootings almost casual
and incidental, they seem
frighteningly authentic.
And, intelligently, he relies
on his splendid actors to inter
pret the intricacies of the
moral and political conflict in
human terms. (Gene Hackman
is particularly excellent; can
anyone remember a bad Gene
Hackman performance?) Un
der Fire is held together by the
working out, dramatically and
visually, of a gripping theme.
Throughout the picture

Spottiswoode employs the
familiar technique of freezing
the frame and going to black
and white, hut in this context
it takes on a special meaning.
When action metamorphoses
into a series of snapshots, it is
defined, its perspective fixed
forever. That's what a great
photojournalist can do —
force us to think of an event,
from that point on, in terms of
a single image. The most fa
mous photos of \ietnam ac
complished that in this
country, and so did the
Newsweek cover shot of the
student weeping over a dead
body at Kent State in 1970. Un
der Fire gives us pause.

Under Fire avoids cliche
smartly by presenting the
American political influence in
its many faces: the Madison
Avenue advertising executive
engaged to improve Somoza's
image (Richard Masur), the
mercenary hopping from one
hotbed to the next (Ed Harris),
the C.I.A. agent as elegant
Parisian (Jean-Louis Trintig

selves, two of whom — Price
and Claire — fall in love with
the rebels' cause.
This balanced view of the
way politics works in the Third
World prepares us for the fo
cal scene of the picture, which
occurs almost at the midway
point. Somoza announces the
death of Rafael, the Sandinista
leader who has captured the
love of the Nicaraguan poor,
but Price, sensing a fraud,
takes Claire into the north in
search of the young idol.
At a rebel camp they learn
that Rafael is indeed dead, but
that if the Sandinistas can con
vince the world otherwise
they have an excellent chance
of defeating Somoza. The
belief that the president has
lied will taint his image ir
reparably, inspire Nicaraguans
to fight against him, and —
significantly — discourage the
U.S. from sending him any
further arms. So the rebels ask
Price to photograph Rafael's
corpse to look like he's still
alive. "You'll win a prize,"
Claire tells him. "I've won
enough prizes," he answers,
and she adds, "But you've
never won a war."
Spottiswoode and the
screenwriters present t ie
loaded issue of journalistic et
hics versus moral responsibil
ity with a full appreciation of

its implications; unlike the
makers of Absence of Malice,
they're not sure how everyone
should have behaved, and
they neither praise nor con
demn Price or the rebels. Yes,
the movie has a leftist bias
(and it's unfortunate that Rene
Enriquez, as Somoza, gives
the least rounded perfor
mance). But it doesn't reduce
the political content to car
toon — it forces us to respond
intellectually as well as emo
tionally. And the script is
beautifully structured so that
as the movie goes on, the
ironies layer around the core
of the focal object — the pho
tograph — as the relations of
the three protagonists
become more complicated
(Alex returns from New York,
where he has taken a
newscaster's job, to find
Claire, his old lover, deeply in
volved with Russell) and the
tension of the civil war
mounts.
Spottiswoode, a first-rate
editor (he cut Straw Dogs, Pat
Garrett and Billy the Kid and
Hard Times, among others), is
not yet a first-rate director:
Under Fire takes a little while
to get going, and some of the
early scenes are awkwardly
staged. But his touch grows
more assured as the story un
winds, and because the street
battle scenes are not gaudy or
overheated, but rather quiet,
the shootings almost casual
and incidental, they seem
frighteningly authentic.
And, intelligently, he relies
on his splendid actors to inter
pret the intricacies of the
moral and political conflict in
human terms. (Gene Hackman
is particularly excellent; can
anyone remember a bad Gene
Hackman performance?) Un
der Fire is held together by the
working out, dramatically and
visually, of a gripping theme.
Throughout the picture

Spottiswoode employs the
familiar technique of freezing
the frame and going to black
and white, hut in this context
it takes on a special meaning.
When action metamorphoses
into a series of snapshots, it is
defined, its perspective fixed
forever. That's what a great
photojournalist can do —
force us to think of an event,
from that point on, in terms of
a single image. The most fa
mous photos of \ietnam ac

student weeping over a dead
