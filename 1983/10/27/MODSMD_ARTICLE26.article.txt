# Motels dynamic, boost L.A. image
## 
### STEPHAN MALMOLI 
Not being from Los Angeles, I
naturally dislike anything from that
city. Whether it's the Lakers, the
smog, the Hollywood industry or the
total lack of culture found in L.A., I just
cannot accept the city as a worthy
place. However, in my years at Stan
ford, I have been "stuck" with
roommates from the L.A. area. Ironi
cally, though, they all have been to my
liking. Their personalities have been
much more noteworthy that the city
from which they hail, and through
them, I have gradually begun to think
more highly of L.A. (Instead of a waste
ful, decadent and devoid place. I now
acknowledge it to be an enjoyable,
wasteful, decadent and devoid place!).
Anyhow, my long-standing buddy
from L.A., whose name is Rudy (I told
him he'd get into one of these reviews
one day), has had a long-standing fixa
tion with the music emerging from the
L.A. scene. One of the bands that he
has praised is the Motels, whom he
saw when they were an unknown new
wave group playing a free concert on
the USC campus. Now, the Motels are
one of the leading L.A. bands and are
on the verge of breaking out national
ly. Therefore, at his insistence, he
decreed that I should accompany him
to their recent concert at the Warfield
Theater in San Francisco. I went on the
condition that he would refrain from
mentioning Malibu Beach or wearing
Dodger blue. Thankfully, he abided by
my terms, and I became aware that
L.A. did have culture, as far as new
wave music was concerned.

Sitting in the packed Warfield
Theater, surrounded by some of the
clothed new wavers found in northern
California, I tried to downplay the
band's L.A. origins. After all, the
band's lead guitarist is from New York
City, I said. However, when the house
lights went down and the sound sys
tem blasted out the theme from
"Mission Impossible," I sensed that
maybe I had judged the Motels and
L.A. too hastily. As the "Mission
Impossible" theme faded out, the cur
tain went up and there were the
Motels belting out "Mission of
Mercy," the band's finest all-out rock
er from last year's All Four One album.
Led by the dynamic lead vocalist
Martha Davis, the Motels presented a
fine 75-minute show that triumphantly
delighted the crowd. They thoroughly
proved themselves to be a tight, pro
fessional outfit whose assets far out
weigh any of their liabilities. No, they
aren't the type of band who are going
to blow the crowd away, but they
gradually sweep up the audience with
their enthusiasm and musical adept
ness.
Of course, they have the voice and
charm of Martha Davis to showcase. As
lead vocalist, Martha Davis has an out
standing range which encapsulates an
all-out Tina Turner screaming style as
on "Mission of Mercy" to the smooth
and soft evocative phrasings as on
"Only The Lonely." She displayed a
firm command and presence in all of
the varied styles of songs the band pre
sented, and thus, was the main focus
of attention for the show.

The other major asset of the band is
the saxophone playing of Martin
jourard, who also doubled on
keyboard. His sax playing allowed the
band's sound to take on an extra verve
which greatly enhanced such tunes as
"Little Robbers" (which is the title
track off their most recent album) and
"Total Control" which may have been
the finest song of the band's set.
However, as I expressed earlier, al
though the band's assets far outweigh
their liabilities, the band still needs
some pointers in certain areas to
realize their full potential. For one, the
band fails to utilize Martin Jourard's
sax playing enough. Instead, they
relegated him to keyboard for about
two-thirds of the set, which prevented
the band from branching out and
gaining more diversified and intensi
fied sound.
But the band, even with Martha
Davis' vocals, still needs a better pool
of material. Although the majority of
the band's songs are good (if not ex
tremely good), the weaker material
sounds too much like filler. However,
this can only improve over time and
with future albums. The band has so
much in their favor though, that these
minor faults should be overcome easi
ly. They only have four albums and on
this tour they should improve their
reputation. In fact, they are doing a
fine job in representing L.A. So, you'll
get no more ranks on L.A.'s music
scene from me, Rudy. But, did you hear
about what you get when you cross a
Valley Girl with the L.A. Rams' defen
sive line? ....

firm command and presence in all of
the varied styles of songs the band pre
sented, and thus, was the main focus
of attention for the show.

The other major asset of the band is
the saxophone playing of Martin
jourard, who also doubled on
keyboard. His sax playing allowed the
band's sound to take on an extra verve
which greatly enhanced such tunes as
"Little Robbers" (which is the title
track off their most recent album) and
"Total Control" which may have been
the finest song of the band's set.
However, as I expressed earlier, al
though the band's assets far outweigh
their liabilities, the band still needs
some pointers in certain areas to
realize their full potential. For one, the
band fails to utilize Martin Jourard's
sax playing enough. Instead, they
relegated him to keyboard for about
two-thirds of the set, which prevented
the band from branching out and
gaining more diversified and intensi
fied sound.
But the band, even with Martha
Davis' vocals, still needs a better pool
of material. Although the majority of
the band's songs are good (if not ex
tremely good), the weaker material
sounds too much like filler. However,
this can only improve over time and
with future albums. The band has so
much in their favor though, that these
minor faults should be overcome easi
ly. They only have four albums and on
this tour they should improve their
reputation. In fact, they are doing a
fine job in representing L.A. So, you'll
get no more ranks on L.A.'s music
scene from me, Rudy. But, did you hear
about what you get when you cross a
Valley Girl with the L.A. Rams' defen
sive line? ....
Not being from Los Angeles, I
naturally dislike anything from that
city. Whether it's the Lakers, the
smog, the Hollywood industry or the
total lack of culture found in L.A., I just
cannot accept the city as a worthy
place. However, in my years at Stan
ford, I have been "stuck" with
roommates from the L.A. area. Ironi
cally, though, they all have been to my
liking. Their personalities have been
much more noteworthy that the city
from which they hail, and through
them, I have gradually begun to think
more highly of L.A. (Instead of a waste
ful, decadent and devoid place. I now
acknowledge it to be an enjoyable,
wasteful, decadent and devoid place!).
Anyhow, my long-standing buddy
from L.A., whose name is Rudy (I told
him he'd get into one of these reviews
one day), has had a long-standing fixa
tion with the music emerging from the
L.A. scene. One of the bands that he
has praised is the Motels, whom he
saw when they were an unknown new
wave group playing a free concert on
the USC campus. Now, the Motels are
one of the leading L.A. bands and are
on the verge of breaking out national
ly. Therefore, at his insistence, he
decreed that I should accompany him
to their recent concert at the Warfield
Theater in San Francisco. I went on the
condition that he would refrain from
mentioning Malibu Beach or wearing
Dodger blue. Thankfully, he abided by
my terms, and I became aware that
L.A. did have culture, as far as new
wave music was concerned.

Sitting in the packed Warfield
Theater, surrounded by some of the
clothed new wavers found in northern
California, I tried to downplay the
band's L.A. origins. After all, the
band's lead guitarist is from New York
City, I said. However, when the house
lights went down and the sound sys
tem blasted out the theme from
"Mission Impossible," I sensed that
maybe I had judged the Motels and
L.A. too hastily. As the "Mission
Impossible" theme faded out, the cur
tain went up and there were the
Motels belting out "Mission of
Mercy," the band's finest all-out rock
er from last year's All Four One album.
Led by the dynamic lead vocalist
Martha Davis, the Motels presented a
fine 75-minute show that triumphantly
delighted the crowd. They thoroughly
proved themselves to be a tight, pro
fessional outfit whose assets far out
weigh any of their liabilities. No, they
aren't the type of band who are going
to blow the crowd away, but they
gradually sweep up the audience with
their enthusiasm and musical adept
ness.
Of course, they have the voice and
charm of Martha Davis to showcase. As
lead vocalist, Martha Davis has an out
standing range which encapsulates an
all-out Tina Turner screaming style as
on "Mission of Mercy" to the smooth
and soft evocative phrasings as on
"Only The Lonely." She displayed a
firm command and presence in all of
the varied styles of songs the band pre
sented, and thus, was the main focus
of attention for the show.
