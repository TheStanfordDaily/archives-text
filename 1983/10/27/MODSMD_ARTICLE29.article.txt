# 'Never Cry Wolf' beautiful but passive and pointless
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Never Crv \\olt contains the
best 20 minutes of filmmaking
viHJ re hkelv to see all year.
Tvler (Charles Martin Smith)
ha> been sent to the Arctic by
the Canadian government to
execute The Lupine Project,
an investigation that will (the
bgwigs in Ottawa assume)
connrm the widelv held beliet
that wolves are causing the
gradual elimination ot caribou
in the tar north. After several
months however Tvler has
discovered no evidence to
support th s theorv: the
wolves he > been observing
survive on a diet ot mice.
Tvler lives m a cabin belong
ing to an old Innuit named
Ootek Zacharv Ittimangnaq),
who appears and disappears
without notice and vv ho seems
to possess 3 shaman s powers
— the legend goes that the
wolf is his helping spirit and

that he can therefore under
stand the wolf's howl.
Perhaps two-thirds of the
way through the picture, the
director, Carroll Ballard, gives
us a scene in which Tyler sits
around the fire with Ootek
and his family and hears the
myth of the wolf and the
caribou: that the first woman
on earth enlisted the aid of the
wolf to keep the caribou
strong by feeding on the old
and diseased of the herd. As
Tvler listens to the tale, wolves
howl outside and Ootek's
tiny, bright eyes — sparkling
pools embedded in the moun
tainous landscape of his wea
thered face — register the
messages they carry to each
other in their song.
This firelit interlude, like
much of Kurosawa's Dersu
Uzala (which featured an old
man — a northern guide —
bearing some resemblance to

Ootek), has a kind of power
difficult to explain, lust as the
beauty of the fable lies in its
simplicity and in the
generosity of its vision — that
each animal has its place in the
world, and is indispensable to
the balance of nature — so the
beauty of the scene derives
from its purity, its clarity and
the sage presence of It
timangnaq and his wife
Martha (as Ootek's wife), who
has regal high cheekbones
and black hair in braids down
her back. This scene is serene,
still.
The sequence that follows it
— in which Tyler runs naked
with a herd of caribou and
sees the truth of the myth for
himself in the behavior of the
wolves — presents a startling
contrast to it: it is wide, ex
travagant, full of activity. The
caribou disappear over a ridge
and fly out again from beneath

it in a tog of dust their horns
piercing the air like living
Christmas tree ornaments,
their breath creating little
spirals of mist. I've never seen
anything quite like this
caribou run, and the combina
tion of the two scenes — the
telling of the myth and the
working out of it — reveal the
gitts of a director at the height
ot his powers.
Carroll Ballard made only
educational and experimental
films from 1%4 to 1979 — Pigs!
and Harvest for the United
States Information Agency,
The Perils of Prise ilia for the
Humane Society, the aborted
PBS-commissioned Seems
Like Only Yesterday, Rodeo,
Crystallization — and then,
with the support of his UCLA
classmate, Francis Ford Cop
pola, he directed The Black
Stallion. (Coppola did Ballard
— and movie lovers — an in
valuable service by giving Bal
lard the opportunity to make
this picture, but Coppola's
name appeared so prominent
ly in the ads for it that many
people are still under the
misapprehension that he di
rected the movie.)
Ballard's pre-commercial
work has a lyrical, rhapsodic
quality that achieves its apot
heosis in The Black Stallion,
which is, I think, a master
piece (and probably the most
exquisite children's movie
ever released). Its detractors
claim that the second half —
the horse race story — tar
nishes the effect of the unor
thodox scenes on the burning
ship and on the island, where
only the child and the horse
exist, but the movie needs the
strong narrative force of the
second hour to complete its
structure: Ballard must in
clude the Walter Farley plot in
order to transcend it.
Perhaps if the book "Never
Cry Wolf" had provided a
more compelling story, the
movie would have a sense of
movement, or urgency. Splen
did as almost all of the footage
is, the picture as a whole
seems peculiarly passive.
The Canadian writer Farley
Mowat presented his own ex
periences in the Arctic without
frills in "Never Cry Wolf," and
though these memoirs have
an endearing unpretentious
ness and the virtue of authen
ticity — and your fascination
in Mowat's discoveries carry
you along as you read — there
isn't much drama in them.
The ads for the movie
proclaim that it deals with

Tyler's discovery ot himself in
the wilderness, but in the
book you get the teeling that
Mowat already knew who he
was (and how to take care of
himself) by the time he got to
the Arctic. And except for the
caribou scene, in which we
can see Tyler transformed, the
movie really confines this ad
vertised progression to the
observations Tyler makes in an
overwritten, unconvincing in
terior monologue supplied by
C.M. Smith, tugene Corr and
Christina Luescher.
The choice of Charles Mar
tin Smith to play Tyler ex
acerbates the problem. It
would have made more sense
to cast an actor who creates
the impression of physical
strength necessary to survive
months alone in the Arctic
(like almost any of the men
who play the astronauts in The
Right Stuff). Smith, who is best
known for his (pretty dreadful)
performance as Terry the Toad
in American Graffiti, looks like
The Little Tramp in a Cold
Rush setting. And he doesn't
have much depth as an actor,
so the philosophical lows of
the narration are particularly
jarring. What he does have is a
modest comic adroitness, a
slight charm. But he's
upstaged by wolves, Huskies,
even baby mice — all of which
are infinitely richer camera
subjects. And when Zachary
Ittimangnaq or Samson )orah
(who plays Ootek's adopted
son Mike) is on screen, almost
every move of Smith's seems
overstated, preening, cutesy.
These Innuit actors don't have
to fight for the camera — it
belongs to them by natural
right.
A total of half a dozen
credited writers worked on
Never Cry Wolf - three on the
narration, and three more
(Curtis Hanson, Sam Hamm
and Richard Kletter) on the
rest of the screenplay. God
knows how many drafts were
discarded in the course of the
three and a half years between
the movie's inception and its
release.
In an article in last week's
New York Times Magazine
describing the making of the
film, Bruce Brown relates that
Ballard shot so much footage
that the crew nicknamed it
"Never Cry Wrap." The rough
cut Ballard first showed to his
distributors, Walt Disney
Productions, ran three and a
half hours and did not contain
a voice-over, and indeed, the
completed Never Cry Wolf

looks like it might have been
culled from twice or even
three times as much film. It
has a strange, arbitrary quality,
as it no one had devised a
strategy for linking its gener
ally magnificent invidivual
scenes. It's a wonderful col
lection ot observations with
out a point.
Even Mowat's obvious,
ironic message — that men,
not wolves, are responsible
for the devastation ot the
caribou — hasn't made it into
the final print. At the end of
the film, we see that men are
guilty of slaughtering the
wolves, but Ballard has ap
parently forgotten the pur
pose of Tyler's mission.
Ballard and his photog
rapher, Hiro Narita, have done
such glorious work in Never
Cry Wolf that its semi
formlessness doesn't spoil
one's pleasure in it — the
movie simply becomes an
oddly leisurely experience. I
loved Mark Isham's music,
and I loved the early scenes
with Brian Dennehy as a
rough-and-ready pilot in a

ramshackle plane. Until the
movie begins to score (unfair)
points against him at the end,
lie gives it the same kind of
warm, folksy presence Hoyt
\\ton supplied at the begin
ning of The Mack Stallion as
the boy's father. And you
know while you're watching
the caribou sequence, or an
other scene, in which Tyler
tails through the ice, that
you'll probably never forget it,
and that Ballard has the most
unusual eye and ear of any
American working in movies
today. (The visual and aural
contrasts in the ice adventure
scene are so astonishing that
you don't breathe until it's
over.) It's difficult to say that
someone should have
tightened the controls over
Ballard while he was shooting
Never Cry Wolf — I'd hate to
think that we might not have
had the great pieces in it, and
besides, a lot of its trouble
stems from the choice ot ma
terial. But perhaps even an art
ist shouldn't spend nearly four
years on a single movie. Too
often, the results indicate
greatness gone awry.

Crystallization — and then,
with the support of his UCLA
classmate, Francis Ford Cop
pola, he directed The Black

— and movie lovers — an in
valuable service by giving Bal
lard the opportunity to make
this picture, but Coppola's
name appeared so prominent
ly in the ads for it that many
people are still under the
misapprehension that he di

Ballard's pre-commercial
work has a lyrical, rhapsodic
quality that achieves its apot
heosis in The Black Stallion,
which is, I think, a master
piece (and probably the most
exquisite children's movie
ever released). Its detractors
claim that the second half —
the horse race story — tar
nishes the effect of the unor
thodox scenes on the burning
ship and on the island, where
only the child and the horse
exist, but the movie needs the
strong narrative force of the
second hour to complete its
structure: Ballard must in
clude the Walter Farley plot in
order to transcend it.
Perhaps if the book "Never
Cry Wolf" had provided a
more compelling story, the
movie would have a sense of
movement, or urgency. Splen
did as almost all of the footage
is, the picture as a whole
seems peculiarly passive.
The Canadian writer Farley
Mowat presented his own ex
periences in the Arctic without
frills in "Never Cry Wolf," and
though these memoirs have
an endearing unpretentious
ness and the virtue of authen
ticity — and your fascination
in Mowat's discoveries carry
you along as you read — there
isn't much drama in them.
The ads for the movie
proclaim that it deals with

Tyler's discovery ot himself in
the wilderness, but in the
book you get the teeling that
Mowat already knew who he
was (and how to take care of
himself) by the time he got to
the Arctic. And except for the
caribou scene, in which we
can see Tyler transformed, the
movie really confines this ad
vertised progression to the
observations Tyler makes in an
overwritten, unconvincing in
terior monologue supplied by
C.M. Smith, tugene Corr and
Christina Luescher.
The choice of Charles Mar
tin Smith to play Tyler ex
acerbates the problem. It
would have made more sense
to cast an actor who creates
the impression of physical
strength necessary to survive
months alone in the Arctic
(like almost any of the men
who play the astronauts in The
Right Stuff). Smith, who is best
known for his (pretty dreadful)
performance as Terry the Toad
in American Graffiti, looks like
The Little Tramp in a Cold
Rush setting. And he doesn't
have much depth as an actor,
so the philosophical lows of
the narration are particularly
jarring. What he does have is a
modest comic adroitness, a
slight charm. But he's
upstaged by wolves, Huskies,
even baby mice — all of which
are infinitely richer camera
subjects. And when Zachary
Ittimangnaq or Samson )orah
(who plays Ootek's adopted
son Mike) is on screen, almost
every move of Smith's seems
overstated, preening, cutesy.
These Innuit actors don't have
to fight for the camera — it
belongs to them by natural
right.
A total of half a dozen
credited writers worked on
Never Cry Wolf - three on the
narration, and three more
(Curtis Hanson, Sam Hamm
and Richard Kletter) on the
rest of the screenplay. God
knows how many drafts were
discarded in the course of the
three and a half years between
the movie's inception and its
release.
In an article in last week's
New York Times Magazine
describing the making of the
film, Bruce Brown relates that
Ballard shot so much footage
that the crew nicknamed it
"Never Cry Wrap." The rough
cut Ballard first showed to his
distributors, Walt Disney
Productions, ran three and a
half hours and did not contain
a voice-over, and indeed, the
completed Never Cry Wolf

looks like it might have been
culled from twice or even
three times as much film. It
has a strange, arbitrary quality,
as it no one had devised a
strategy for linking its gener
ally magnificent invidivual
scenes. It's a wonderful col
lection ot observations with
out a point.
Even Mowat's obvious,
ironic message — that men,
not wolves, are responsible
for the devastation ot the
caribou — hasn't made it into
the final print. At the end of
the film, we see that men are
guilty of slaughtering the
wolves, but Ballard has ap
parently forgotten the pur
pose of Tyler's mission.
Ballard and his photog
rapher, Hiro Narita, have done
such glorious work in Never
Cry Wolf that its semi
formlessness doesn't spoil
one's pleasure in it — the
movie simply becomes an
oddly leisurely experience. I
loved Mark Isham's music,
and I loved the early scenes
with Brian Dennehy as a
rough-and-ready pilot in a

ramshackle plane. Until the
movie begins to score (unfair)
points against him at the end,
lie gives it the same kind of
warm, folksy presence Hoyt
\\ton supplied at the begin
ning of The Mack Stallion as
the boy's father. And you
know while you're watching
the caribou sequence, or an
other scene, in which Tyler
tails through the ice, that
you'll probably never forget it,
and that Ballard has the most
unusual eye and ear of any
American working in movies
today. (The visual and aural
contrasts in the ice adventure
scene are so astonishing that
you don't breathe until it's
over.) It's difficult to say that
someone should have
tightened the controls over
Ballard while he was shooting
Never Cry Wolf — I'd hate to
think that we might not have
had the great pieces in it, and
besides, a lot of its trouble
stems from the choice ot ma
terial. But perhaps even an art
ist shouldn't spend nearly four
years on a single movie. Too
often, the results indicate
greatness gone awry.



Charles Martin Smith
Never Crv \\olt contains the
best 20 minutes of filmmaking
viHJ re hkelv to see all year.
Tvler (Charles Martin Smith)
ha> been sent to the Arctic by
the Canadian government to
execute The Lupine Project,
an investigation that will (the
bgwigs in Ottawa assume)
connrm the widelv held beliet
that wolves are causing the
gradual elimination ot caribou
in the tar north. After several
months however Tvler has
discovered no evidence to
support th s theorv: the
wolves he > been observing
survive on a diet ot mice.
Tvler lives m a cabin belong
ing to an old Innuit named
Ootek Zacharv Ittimangnaq),
who appears and disappears
without notice and vv ho seems
to possess 3 shaman s powers
— the legend goes that the
wolf is his helping spirit and

that he can therefore under
stand the wolf's howl.
Perhaps two-thirds of the
way through the picture, the
director, Carroll Ballard, gives
us a scene in which Tyler sits
around the fire with Ootek
and his family and hears the
myth of the wolf and the
caribou: that the first woman
on earth enlisted the aid of the
wolf to keep the caribou
strong by feeding on the old
and diseased of the herd. As
Tvler listens to the tale, wolves
howl outside and Ootek's
tiny, bright eyes — sparkling
pools embedded in the moun
tainous landscape of his wea
thered face — register the
messages they carry to each
other in their song.
This firelit interlude, like
much of Kurosawa's Dersu
Uzala (which featured an old
man — a northern guide —
bearing some resemblance to

Ootek), has a kind of power
difficult to explain, lust as the
beauty of the fable lies in its
simplicity and in the
generosity of its vision — that
each animal has its place in the
world, and is indispensable to
the balance of nature — so the
beauty of the scene derives
from its purity, its clarity and
the sage presence of It
timangnaq and his wife
Martha (as Ootek's wife), who
has regal high cheekbones
and black hair in braids down
her back. This scene is serene,
still.
The sequence that follows it
— in which Tyler runs naked
with a herd of caribou and
sees the truth of the myth for
himself in the behavior of the
wolves — presents a startling
contrast to it: it is wide, ex
travagant, full of activity. The
caribou disappear over a ridge
and fly out again from beneath

it in a tog of dust their horns
piercing the air like living
Christmas tree ornaments,
their breath creating little
spirals of mist. I've never seen
anything quite like this
caribou run, and the combina
tion of the two scenes — the
telling of the myth and the
working out of it — reveal the
gitts of a director at the height
ot his powers.

slight charm. But he's
upstaged by wolves, Huskies,
even baby mice — all of which
are infinitely richer camera
subjects. And when Zachary
Ittimangnaq or Samson )orah
(who plays Ootek's adopted
son Mike) is on screen, almost
every move of Smith's seems
overstated, preening, cutesy.
These Innuit actors don't have
to fight for the camera — it
belongs to them by natural
right.
A total of half a dozen
credited writers worked on
Never Cry Wolf - three on the
narration, and three more
(Curtis Hanson, Sam Hamm
and Richard Kletter) on the
rest of the screenplay. God
knows how many drafts were
discarded in the course of the
three and a half years between
the movie's inception and its
release.
In an article in last week's
New York Times Magazine
describing the making of the
film, Bruce Brown relates that
Ballard shot so much footage
that the crew nicknamed it
"Never Cry Wrap." The rough
cut Ballard first showed to his
distributors, Walt Disney
Productions, ran three and a
half hours and did not contain
a voice-over, and indeed, the
completed Never Cry Wolf

looks like it might have been
culled from twice or even
three times as much film. It
has a strange, arbitrary quality,
as it no one had devised a
strategy for linking its gener
ally magnificent invidivual
scenes. It's a wonderful col
lection ot observations with
out a point.
Even Mowat's obvious,
ironic message — that men,
not wolves, are responsible
for the devastation ot the
caribou — hasn't made it into
the final print. At the end of
the film, we see that men are
guilty of slaughtering the
wolves, but Ballard has ap
parently forgotten the pur
pose of Tyler's mission.
Ballard and his photog
rapher, Hiro Narita, have done
such glorious work in Never
Cry Wolf that its semi
formlessness doesn't spoil
one's pleasure in it — the
movie simply becomes an
oddly leisurely experience. I
loved Mark Isham's music,
and I loved the early scenes
with Brian Dennehy as a
rough-and-ready pilot in a

ramshackle plane. Until the
movie begins to score (unfair)
points against him at the end,
lie gives it the same kind of
warm, folksy presence Hoyt
\\ton supplied at the begin
ning of The Mack Stallion as
the boy's father. And you
know while you're watching
the caribou sequence, or an
other scene, in which Tyler
tails through the ice, that
you'll probably never forget it,
and that Ballard has the most
unusual eye and ear of any
American working in movies
today. (The visual and aural
contrasts in the ice adventure
scene are so astonishing that
you don't breathe until it's
over.) It's difficult to say that
someone should have
tightened the controls over
Ballard while he was shooting
Never Cry Wolf — I'd hate to
think that we might not have
had the great pieces in it, and
besides, a lot of its trouble
stems from the choice ot ma
terial. But perhaps even an art
ist shouldn't spend nearly four
years on a single movie. Too
often, the results indicate
greatness gone awry.



Charles Martin Smith
Never Crv \\olt contains the
best 20 minutes of filmmaking
viHJ re hkelv to see all year.
Tvler (Charles Martin Smith)
ha> been sent to the Arctic by
the Canadian government to
execute The Lupine Project,
an investigation that will (the
bgwigs in Ottawa assume)
connrm the widelv held beliet
that wolves are causing the
gradual elimination ot caribou
in the tar north. After several
months however Tvler has
discovered no evidence to
support th s theorv: the
wolves he > been observing
survive on a diet ot mice.
Tvler lives m a cabin belong
ing to an old Innuit named
Ootek Zacharv Ittimangnaq),
who appears and disappears
without notice and vv ho seems
to possess 3 shaman s powers
— the legend goes that the
wolf is his helping spirit and

that he can therefore under
stand the wolf's howl.
Perhaps two-thirds of the
way through the picture, the
director, Carroll Ballard, gives
us a scene in which Tyler sits
around the fire with Ootek
and his family and hears the
myth of the wolf and the
caribou: that the first woman
on earth enlisted the aid of the
wolf to keep the caribou
strong by feeding on the old
and diseased of the herd. As
Tvler listens to the tale, wolves
howl outside and Ootek's
tiny, bright eyes — sparkling
pools embedded in the moun
tainous landscape of his wea
thered face — register the
messages they carry to each
other in their song.
This firelit interlude, like
much of Kurosawa's Dersu
Uzala (which featured an old
man — a northern guide —
bearing some resemblance to

Ootek), has a kind of power
difficult to explain, lust as the
beauty of the fable lies in its
simplicity and in the
generosity of its vision — that
each animal has its place in the
world, and is indispensable to
the balance of nature — so the
beauty of the scene derives
from its purity, its clarity and
the sage presence of It
timangnaq and his wife
Martha (as Ootek's wife), who
has regal high cheekbones
and black hair in braids down
her back. This scene is serene,
still.
The sequence that follows it
— in which Tyler runs naked
with a herd of caribou and
sees the truth of the myth for
himself in the behavior of the
wolves — presents a startling
contrast to it: it is wide, ex
travagant, full of activity. The
caribou disappear over a ridge
and fly out again from beneath

it in a tog of dust their horns
piercing the air like living
Christmas tree ornaments,
their breath creating little
spirals of mist. I've never seen
anything quite like this
caribou run, and the combina
tion of the two scenes — the
telling of the myth and the
working out of it — reveal the
gitts of a director at the height
ot his powers.
Carroll Ballard made only
educational and experimental
films from 1%4 to 1979 — Pigs!
and Harvest for the United
States Information Agency,
The Perils of Prise ilia for the
Humane Society, the aborted
PBS-commissioned Seems
Like Only Yesterday, Rodeo,
Crystallization — and then,
with the support of his UCLA
classmate, Francis Ford Cop
pola, he directed The Black
Stallion. (Coppola did Ballard
— and movie lovers — an in
valuable service by giving Bal
lard the opportunity to make
this picture, but Coppola's
name appeared so prominent
ly in the ads for it that many
people are still under the
misapprehension that he di
rected the movie.)
Ballard's pre-commercial
work has a lyrical, rhapsodic
quality that achieves its apot
heosis in The Black Stallion,
which is, I think, a master
piece (and probably the most
exquisite children's movie
ever released). Its detractors
claim that the second half —
the horse race story — tar
nishes the effect of the unor
thodox scenes on the burning
ship and on the island, where
only the child and the horse
exist, but the movie needs the
strong narrative force of the
second hour to complete its
structure: Ballard must in
clude the Walter Farley plot in
order to transcend it.
Perhaps if the book "Never
Cry Wolf" had provided a
more compelling story, the
movie would have a sense of
movement, or urgency. Splen
did as almost all of the footage
is, the picture as a whole
seems peculiarly passive.
The Canadian writer Farley
Mowat presented his own ex
periences in the Arctic without
frills in "Never Cry Wolf," and
though these memoirs have
an endearing unpretentious
ness and the virtue of authen
ticity — and your fascination
in Mowat's discoveries carry
you along as you read — there
isn't much drama in them.
The ads for the movie
proclaim that it deals with

Tyler's discovery ot himself in
the wilderness, but in the
book you get the teeling that
Mowat already knew who he
was (and how to take care of
himself) by the time he got to
the Arctic. And except for the
caribou scene, in which we
can see Tyler transformed, the
movie really confines this ad
vertised progression to the
observations Tyler makes in an
overwritten, unconvincing in
terior monologue supplied by
C.M. Smith, tugene Corr and
Christina Luescher.
The choice of Charles Mar
tin Smith to play Tyler ex
acerbates the problem. It
would have made more sense
to cast an actor who creates
the impression of physical
strength necessary to survive
months alone in the Arctic
(like almost any of the men
who play the astronauts in The
Right Stuff). Smith, who is best
known for his (pretty dreadful)
performance as Terry the Toad
in American Graffiti, looks like
The Little Tramp in a Cold
Rush setting. And he doesn't
have much depth as an actor,
so the philosophical lows of
the narration are particularly
jarring. What he does have is a
modest comic adroitness, a
slight charm. But he's
upstaged by wolves, Huskies,
even baby mice — all of which
are infinitely richer camera
subjects. And when Zachary
Ittimangnaq or Samson )orah
(who plays Ootek's adopted
son Mike) is on screen, almost
every move of Smith's seems
overstated, preening, cutesy.
