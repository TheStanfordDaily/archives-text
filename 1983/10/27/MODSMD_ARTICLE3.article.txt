# Nicaragua fears Grenada harbinger of US invasion

### BRAD BARHAM 
Managua, Nicaragua — Citizens took to the streets
throughout Nicaragua Tuesday and yesterday to protest
the U.S. invasion of Grenada, which some here fear is a
dress rehearsal for an invasion of this country.
News of the American intervention spread rapidly in
Managua Tuesday morning, and by afternoon,
Nicaraguans were demonstrating by the tens of
thousands in cities and towns all across the country, ex
pressing their solidarity with the people of Grenada
and their willingness to defend Nicaragua from any in
vading force.
The American invasion of Grenada came Tuesday
morning as President Reagan sent nearly 2000 American
troops to the Caribbean island to protect American
citizens there and restore order to the violence-ridden
country. He ordered the invasion after six Caribbean
countries, who also contributed troops to the opera
tion, asked the United States for assistance.
In Managua, more than 50,000 people gathered at the

office of the United Nations. Comandante Leticia Her
rera, the secretary general of Nicaragua's neighbor
hood defense committees and vice-president of the
council of states, condemned the U.S. invasion, called
on Reagan to respect the principles of the United Na
tions charter that guarantee the sovereignty of nations
to rule their internal affairs.
"The demented, warring ways of the Reagan admin
istration are carrying humanity toward a horrible
holocaust — generalized world war," Herrera said.
At the Casa Del Gobierno, the government
headquarters, Daniel Ortega, leader of the governing
junta in Nicaragua, called for immediate international
support to help prevent a regional war in Central
America.
He said, "tomorrow's meeting in Tegucigalpa, Hon
duras, of military leaders from Guatemala, El Salvador,
Honduras and the United States to coordinate concrete
plans of aggression against Nicaragua, as well as the
presence of U.S. troops in Honduras and U.S. Naval

fleets off of both coasts of Nicaragua, as proof that an
invasion of Nicaragua may be imminent."
He also said that Nicaragua has evidence that the CIA
plans to provoke or simulate military attacks from
Nicaragua on targets in Honduras and Costa Rica. Such
an "attack" would then provide the pretext, according
to Ortega, for major aggression against Nicaragua.
Yesterday morning, a group of more than 100
Americans calling itself the Committee of U.S. Citizen
Residents in Nicaragua called a press conference at the
entrance to the U.S. Embassy. They stated that they
"refuse to serve as pretext for another invasion," refer
ring to the fact that U.S. officials said the most impor
tant reason for the invasion of Grenada was concern for
the 1000 Americans living there.
lames Coff, a retired chaplain of the U.S. Naval
Reserve and a Presbyterian minister, read the commit
tee's statement.
"Nicaragua is struggling to construct a democratic
system after half a century of the U.S.-supported

Somoza dictatorship. If the Reagan administration
favored democracy, it would not now be financing the
remnants of Somoza's military to block this effort.
"The alliance between the Reagan administration
and these forces is precisely what threatens our secur
ity. These counter-revolutionaries have already killed
hundreds of Nicaraguan civilians and several foreigners
like ourselves," he said.
Marco Romero, a retired Boeing engineer living in
Managua, called on his "fellow Americans to wake up
to what is really happening in Central America and the
Caribbean, and to turn the Reagan administration
around."
Nicaraguans at Tuesday's demonstration chanted
loudly was "Aqui, alia, el yanqui morira." ("Here,
there, the Yankee will die.")
