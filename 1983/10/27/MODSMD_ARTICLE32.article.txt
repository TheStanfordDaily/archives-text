"Do you know what it's like to get
mail delivered to Lisa ," a senior
staff writer recently queried an un
repentant Briefly writer as she beat
him about the head with a turgid,
day-old Daily. So the Briefly writer
made Lisa a promise. Never
again would he mistake her last
name for a meal. Fortunately,

however, the Daily staff seems to be
replete with last names beginning
with "I"and ending with "h."
Therefore, please come to a Richard
Lunch (a close friend of the person
who wrote the front-page story on
John Anderson today) at noon
today. There won't be a guest
speaker but there won't be a lynch
ing either, except, maybe, of an un
repentant Briefly writer.
