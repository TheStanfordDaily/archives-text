# Kennedy to address senate on Reagan library complex
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL DAVID SANCHEZ Senior staff writers 
University President Donald Ken
nedy is expected to make a major
statement regarding the proposed
Reagan presidential library complex
at today's meeting of the Faculty
Senate.
Kennedy is scheduled to com
ment publicly for the first time on a
faculty advisory committee report
that expressed reservations about
elements of the proposed complex.
A Kennedy recommendation on
the complex would carry tremen
dous weight not only in the Senate,
whose role is purely advisory, but
also on the Board of Trustees, which
is currently considering the pro
posal and may make a decision as
early as December.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, a

vocal opponent of the Reagan com
plex, said that today's meeting will
be "extremely interesting" if Ken
nedy makes a personal recommen
dation on the proposal.
The advisory committee, headed
by Economics Prof, lames Rosse, re
ported to Kennedy early this month
that a presidential library "could
become a valuable academic
resource at Stanford."
But it also said that a Reagan
museum would have "little or no
academic value," and that a pro
posed policy center should be
"better integrated" into the Univer
sity, with the provost, instead of the
Hoover Institution, appointing its
governing committee.
Since the report's release, other
groups have mobilized to state their
opinion on the proposed complex

in an effort to influence the Board's
decision.
In the latest development, 25
Stanford history professors — a
majority of the department — have
written in two separate letters to
Kennedy that they "strongly
oppose" creation of a public affairs
center administered by Hoover as
part of the complex.
They join more than 200 other fac
ulty members, including a majority
of the law school faculty, who sub
mitted letters — most opposing at
least part of the proposed complex
— to the Rosse committee. Some of
those letters were printed in yester
day's Campus Report.
Hundreds more letters have been
submitted by the Hoover Institu
tion, which sent letters and
telegrams to former Hoover
scholars across the nation request
ing their support.
On Tuesday, a Hoover committee
headed by Senior Fellow Martin An
derson issued its second report on
the complex, this one defending its
controversial proposal to operate
the public affairs center. That night,
the student senate approved a
resolution echoing the opinions ex
pressed by the Rosse committee.

Meanwhile, student members of a
group calling itself Stanford Com
munity Against Reagan University
have begun circulating petitions op
posing "the proposed expansion of
the Hoover Institution's role and in
fluence that would occur if Hoover
. . . administers or controls the pro
posed Ronald Reagan complex in
whole or part."
In an attempt to solicit even more
input from the Stanford faculty, the
Faculty Senate steering committee
has scheduled three hearings for
next week to allow faculty members
to express their opinions on the pro
posal. The meetings will be closed
to the public, according to Academ
ic Secretary Clara Bush, because
they are solely intended to obtain
input from the constituents of the
Faculty Senate.

Each meeting will be chaired by a
different steering committee mem
ber: History Prof. Paul Robinson will
be in charge on Nov. 1, Economics
Prof. Kenneth Arrow on Nov. 2 and
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch
on Nov. 3.

Rebholz criticized the plan to
close the meetings to the public and
press, calling it "very strange." He
said he would ask the steering com
mittee at today's senate meeting
why non-faculty members should be
excluded from the hearings.
