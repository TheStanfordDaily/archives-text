Troops rescue students in Grenada
Washington — American combat troops com
pleted the rescue of United States students from
Cuban and Grenadian control yesterday and, in the
face of diminishing resistance, appeared ready to
wind up their conquest of the tiny Caribbean island
and its two-week-old leftist government.
About 36 hours after 1900 U.S. Marines and Army
Rangers and other troops stormed ashore, helicop
ters lifted the last American students from the Grand
Anse campus of St. George's University Medical
School, where Cuban and Grenadian armed forces
had held off American troops since Tuesday.
Word that the armed resistance had ended at the
campus on a beach southwest of the capital ot St.

Georges came as the first two planes to evacuate
U.S. citizens from the island, carrying a total of 141
passengers, landed at Charleston, S.C.
As the second day of the intensely controversial
intervention ended, Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger reported that six Americans had been
killed and 33 wounded, with eight listed as missing
in action.
Although U.S. officials continued to say that the
operation was proceeding smoothly, Gen. John Ves
sey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowl
edged that the defense of the island — particularly
by Cubans — had been stiffer and better organized
than U.S. planners had anticipated. An additional
1000 army paratroopers were sent to Grenada Wed
nesday to back up the original invading force.
However, administration officials clearly an
tic ipated that the fighting would soon be over today,
when President Reagan delivers a nationally
televised address at 8 p.m. EDT on both the crisis in
Lebanon and the invasion of Grenada. More than
that, they were anxious to bring the operation to a
close in order to minimize widespread opposition to
the move both at home and abroad.
Congressional criticism of the intervention
mounted as the fighting apparently neared an end.
Demonstrators took to the streets in Washington,
and journalists lodged strong complaints about the
administration's sharp restrictions on news from the
island.
Weinberger refused to say when he expected
American troops to begin leaving the island, but he
| predic ted it would be "very soon — days or weeks."
"We want to withdraw as many of our troops as
we possibly can," he told reporters.
The United States landed about 800 paratroopers
in Grenada today to reinforce the almost 2000-strong
U.S. invasion lorce, crushed Cuban resistance and
began evacuating Americans. Pentagon sources re
ported six U.S. troops killed, eight missing and 33
wounded.
A Cuban government announcement in Havana
said six helicopter gunships attacked Cuban posi
tions on Grenada before dawn yesterday, destroying
the Cubans' main building at the Point Salines air
field. It said the last six Cuban defenders
"sacrificed" themselves rather than surrender.
The Barbados state-owned Caribbean Broadcast
ing Co. said at least 30 Cubans were killed in the at
tack. It said Grenadian troops in armoured cars and
snipers in houses were firing on American forces
j trying to advance into the southern part of St.
Georges, the capital.
Another report by the radio said the landing force
"rescued" the British governor general, Sir Paul
Scoon, from house arrest in St. George's. The U.S.
government said it wants Scoon to form a provincial
government. There was no mention of the man who
led last week's bloody coup, Gen. Hudson Austin.
Reagan rejects evacuation offers
Washington — Grenada's leftist military rulers of
fered at least twice to help evacuate American
citizens from the island prior to the U.S. invasion,
but President Reagan rejected the offers as un
trustworthy and ordered troop movements to go
ahead, U.S. officials said yesterday.
As late as Monday, on the eve of the U.S. military
action, the Grenadians sent Washington a
diplomatic note giving assurances that U.S. citizens
were free to leave. But the Reagan administration
sent back a message saying that it could not respond
because it did not consider Grenada's military go
vernment to be a legitimate authority.
"It was a floating crap game down there and we
never knew who was in charge," White House
spokesperson Larry Speakes told reporters yester
day, in explaining the President's decision. "There
was just no way . . . that we could be at all assured
that their promises would be kept."
"It we felt we could have accomplished this short
of a military operation, we would have," he said.
"Bui we did n't believe a word they said."
Grenadian and Cuban officials charged yesterday
that the United States thus ignored opportunities to
assure the safety of the estimated 1000 Americans in
Grenada through diplomacy, and mounted the inva
sion solely to overthrow the leftist regime.
"This was an application of a philosophy and a
policy of force, and attempts are being made to ex
tend it to the entire world," Cuban President Fidel
Castro said in a Havana press conference.
He said Cuba, too, had offered last week to
cooperate in any evacuation efforts, but the United
States ignored the message until the invasion was
, already underway.
j lan )acobs, Grenada's acting representative to the

Organization ot American States, told an OAS emer
gency session that his government had said it would
"willingly allow any Americans to leave or enter
freely," and called the U.S. doubts of the regime's
trustworthiness "a smokescreen."
Administration officials said they tried diplomacy,
but quickly abandoned it because the leftist
Grenadian military junta, which seized power Oct.
19, was too disorganized to deliver on any of its prom
ises. "We're satisfied that we took all the measures
we possibly could," State Department spokesper
son John Hughes said.
Bush tours Beirut bomb site
Beirut, Lebanon — Vice President George Bush
declared during a whirlwind four-hour visit to Beirut
yesterday that "we're not going to let a bunch of in
sidious terrorists, cowards, shape the foreign policy
of the United States."
Wearing a flak jacket and Marine helmet, Bush
toured the site of the massive explosion that col
lapsed the tour-story U.S. Marine administrative
headquarters building and barracks at Beirut airport
Sunday, killing at least 219 Marines and sailors and
injuring more than 75.
Visibly moved, the vice president said, "I hadn't
expected this much destruction. You've heard it.
You've read it. But until you feel, see it, see the size
of those reinforcing steel bars . . his voice trailed
off.
As the laborious picking apart ot the shattered,
steel-reinforced building continued for the fourth
day, Marines remained on their highest "condition
1" alert all day yesterday after their positions were
the taiget of early-morning fire by automatic weap
ons and rocket-propelled grenades.
"The shooting all along our eastern perimeter
stopped shortly before 7 a.m., when we fired two
rounds from an 81-milimeter mortar," Marine
spokesman Maj. Robert Jordan said.
The Marines also increased security measures
around their headquarters area at the airport, block
ing access roads to prevent a repetition of the
suicidal Sunday morning attack when an explosives
laden truck roared through the Marines' parking lot
and into the lobby of the headquarters building
before exploding.
At the site of the French peacekeeping force's
headquarters 1.2 miles away, where a second bomb
exploded Sunday, the toll of dead reached 53 as res
cue workers continued to dig into the collapsed
nine-story building.
In the first public description of what happened
when the French headquarters was attacked only
seconds after the Marines were hit, a French spokes
man, Col. Philippe De Longeaux, said that neighbor
hood residents had rushed to their windows when
they heard the airport explosion.
He said that they saw a small red truck speeding
toward the French force's building, then watched as
it smashed into the building's entrance and ex
ploded, almost instantly bringing the entire
structure down.
O'Neill supports efforts in Lebanon
Washington — In what was described as "the most
emotional speech of his career," House Speaker
Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass) yesterday apparently
scuttled a rebellion among House Democrats who
want a rapid withdrawal of Marines from Lebanon.
During a closed-door Democratic caucus, O'Neill
reportedly yelled and pounded his fist as he argued
with members of his own party that now is not the
time to "undermine" President Reagan's efforts to
resolve the Lebanon crisis, according to several who
attended the caucus.
"It was the most emotional speech I've ever heard
him make," said Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis), who said
the pitch had changed his mind on this issue.
"I had been planning to vote for a rapid
withdrawal from Lebanon, basically to send the

president a message," Aspin said.
But I decided that if the Speaker teels that
strongly, I'm inclined to vote with him."
O'Neill's plea came at a time when many
Democrats have been openly critical of the Speaker
tor his strong support of Reagan on Lebanon.
O'Neill's negotiated agreement with the President,
which resulted in passage of legislation allowing
Marines to stay in Lebanon for up to 18 more
months, has been especially criticized.
As one O'Neill aide put it,"The Speaker is very
old-fashioned about this. He believes that partisan
ship should stop at the water's edge."
However, O'Neill's view has frustrated and an
gered his opponents including Rep. Clarence Long
iD-Md) who had prepared an amendment to the
Defense Appropriations Bill cutting off tunds for
Marines in Lebanon after 30 days.
I think (O'Neill) made a great mistake to wrap the
mantle of Americanism around himself," long said
angrily after the caucus, "We're all Americans."
Atter the Speaker's booming denouncement of
the amendment, Long and his allies were forced to
change it to allow the White House to keep Marines
in Beirut until March 1.
"Obviously, the Speaker did get modifications (in
the Long amendment)," said Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-
Calit"). But when he finished up and said, 'You have
to do what you think is best for this country.' I
realized that what I think is best is somewhat differ
ent from what he thinks is best."
Andropov gives arms proposals
Moscow — Soviet President Yuri Andropov yester
day night announced new arms-control proposals to
demonstrate Soviet "flexibility" but said
that the Geneva talks will collapse when U.S.
medium-range nuclear missile deployments in
Western Europe get under way.
In an apparent bid to induce a delay in the U.S.
deployments, scheduled to start in December,
Andropov said the talks would continue if the
United States "renounced the deployment of its
missiles in Europe within the announced
deadlines."
Andropov disclosed that Moscow is now prepared
to cut down to "about 140" the number of its triple
warhead SS-20 missiles in the European theater. This
he added, "is noticeably less" than the combined
number of French and British nuclear delivery sys
tems.
Andropov reaffirmed his earlier assertion that
Moscow would "liquidate" all other missiles, in
cluding the SS-20s, in the European theater if an
agreement were to be reached at Geneva. Yesterday
night, he went a step further by asserting that no
new SS-20 missiles would be deployed in the Asian
part of the country if agreement were reached at
Geneva.
Moreover, the Soviet leader asserted he was
prepared to show additional flexibility on the ques
tion of medium-range nuclear-capable aircraft. He
said Moscow did not want to "undercut" the United
States on this issue despite the fact that the Soviet
Union did not have similar aircraft in Third World
countries capable of reaching the United States.
The package was interpreted by western
specialists here as containing both "cosmetic"
changes and substantive ones.
The timing of Andropov's proposal was signifi
cant, as it comes at a time of divisions within the
western alliance over the American invasion of
Grenada. It also coincides with a series of anti
nuclear demonstrations in Western Europe and
presumably was designed to increase pressures on
Western European governments to seek a delay in
U.S. deployments.
But the subtle substantive shifts appear to have
been designed to precede next month's scheduled
West German parliamentary debate on the deploy
ment questions and at the same time to calm fears
generated in China and Japan over a possible SS-20
build up in Asia.

Speaking in an interview with the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda, Andropov rejected a view
held in the west that the Russians would begin to
negotiate in earnest in Geneva once Pershing II and
cruise missiles were deployed.
He described such views as "an utter deception
designed to dampen the intensity of the struggle by
the West European peoples against the appearance
of American nuclear missiles in Europe."
"Everything must be totally clear here," he said.
"The appearance of new American missiles in West
ern Europe will make continuation of the present
talks in Geneva impossible. On the other hand, the
Geneva talks can be continued if the United States
does not start the actual deployment of missiles."
Treasury announces record deficit
Washington — It's official: The federal deficit for
the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 set a record of
$195.4 billion, the Treasury Department announced
yesterday.
The new record, enormous as it is, represents
something of a triumph for the Reagan administra
tion. The administration had predicted as recently as
three months ago that the deficit, which never had
exceeded $100 billion before fiscal 1982, would burst
through the $200 billion mark in fiscal 1983.
Hut by any measure, the actual deficit still is im
pressive, these comparisons show:
—The $195.4 billion is nearly double the previous
record of $110.7 billion, set only the year before.
—It is larger than total federal outlays for any year
before 1967.
—It is larger than the cumulative federal deficit from
the beginning of the republic through fiscal 1944,
when World War II was causing deficits that were
then setting records.
The Office of Management and Budget gave con
siderable credit for the smaller-than-expected deficit
to the summer drought, which reduced agricultural
supplies and drove up farm prices. As a result, many
farmers bought back their crops from the
Agriculture Department so that they could sell them
for more on the open market.
Agricultural outlays for fiscal 1983 fell $3 billion the
July estimate.
Defense spending, although a record $205 billion,
was $3.9 billion lower than estimated three months
ago, for a variety of reasons. Inflation in goods pur
chased by the Defense Department proved less than
expected, for example, and contract delays in the
purchase of some weapons systems pushed costs
into the next fiscal year.
Sales to foreign governments of military equip
ment also contributed and greater sales than ex
pected provided $1.4 billion in increased revenue.
Altogether, spending totaled $795.9 billion, nearly
$70 billion more than in the previous year but $14.5
billion less than the )uly estimate.
Stock prices drift lower
New York — Stock prices drifted lower yesterday
as traders kept a cautious eye on developments in
the American invasion of Grenada.
Precious metals and some technology stocks were
the most notable losers, while many utility issues
gained ground.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 8.64 to
1243.80, bringing its loss since it reached a record
closing high of 1284.65 on Oct. 10 to 40.85 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to
79.57 million shares, against 82.53 million in the pre
vious session.
Today's weather
Sunny through tomorrow except for lingering
overnight fog near the ocean. Highs from 65 to 70 at
the ocean to the 70s and low 80s inland.

Anse campus of St. George's University Medical
School, where Cuban and Grenadian armed forces
had held off American troops since Tuesday.
Word that the armed resistance had ended at the
campus on a beach southwest of the capital ot St.

Georges came as the first two planes to evacuate
U.S. citizens from the island, carrying a total of 141
passengers, landed at Charleston, S.C.
As the second day of the intensely controversial
intervention ended, Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger reported that six Americans had been
killed and 33 wounded, with eight listed as missing
in action.
Although U.S. officials continued to say that the
operation was proceeding smoothly, Gen. John Ves
sey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowl
edged that the defense of the island — particularly
by Cubans — had been stiffer and better organized
than U.S. planners had anticipated. An additional
1000 army paratroopers were sent to Grenada Wed
nesday to back up the original invading force.
However, administration officials clearly an
tic ipated that the fighting would soon be over today,
when President Reagan delivers a nationally
televised address at 8 p.m. EDT on both the crisis in
Lebanon and the invasion of Grenada. More than
that, they were anxious to bring the operation to a
close in order to minimize widespread opposition to
the move both at home and abroad.
Congressional criticism of the intervention
mounted as the fighting apparently neared an end.
Demonstrators took to the streets in Washington,
and journalists lodged strong complaints about the
administration's sharp restrictions on news from the
island.
Weinberger refused to say when he expected
American troops to begin leaving the island, but he
| predic ted it would be "very soon — days or weeks."
"We want to withdraw as many of our troops as
we possibly can," he told reporters.
The United States landed about 800 paratroopers
in Grenada today to reinforce the almost 2000-strong
U.S. invasion lorce, crushed Cuban resistance and
began evacuating Americans. Pentagon sources re
ported six U.S. troops killed, eight missing and 33
wounded.
A Cuban government announcement in Havana
said six helicopter gunships attacked Cuban posi
tions on Grenada before dawn yesterday, destroying
the Cubans' main building at the Point Salines air
field. It said the last six Cuban defenders
"sacrificed" themselves rather than surrender.
The Barbados state-owned Caribbean Broadcast
ing Co. said at least 30 Cubans were killed in the at
tack. It said Grenadian troops in armoured cars and
snipers in houses were firing on American forces
j trying to advance into the southern part of St.
Georges, the capital.
Another report by the radio said the landing force
"rescued" the British governor general, Sir Paul
Scoon, from house arrest in St. George's. The U.S.
government said it wants Scoon to form a provincial
government. There was no mention of the man who
led last week's bloody coup, Gen. Hudson Austin.
Reagan rejects evacuation offers
Washington — Grenada's leftist military rulers of
fered at least twice to help evacuate American
citizens from the island prior to the U.S. invasion,
but President Reagan rejected the offers as un
trustworthy and ordered troop movements to go
ahead, U.S. officials said yesterday.
As late as Monday, on the eve of the U.S. military
action, the Grenadians sent Washington a
diplomatic note giving assurances that U.S. citizens
were free to leave. But the Reagan administration
sent back a message saying that it could not respond
because it did not consider Grenada's military go
vernment to be a legitimate authority.
"It was a floating crap game down there and we
never knew who was in charge," White House
spokesperson Larry Speakes told reporters yester
day, in explaining the President's decision. "There
was just no way . . . that we could be at all assured
that their promises would be kept."
"It we felt we could have accomplished this short
of a military operation, we would have," he said.
"Bui we did n't believe a word they said."
Grenadian and Cuban officials charged yesterday
that the United States thus ignored opportunities to
assure the safety of the estimated 1000 Americans in
Grenada through diplomacy, and mounted the inva
sion solely to overthrow the leftist regime.
"This was an application of a philosophy and a
policy of force, and attempts are being made to ex
tend it to the entire world," Cuban President Fidel
Castro said in a Havana press conference.
He said Cuba, too, had offered last week to
cooperate in any evacuation efforts, but the United
States ignored the message until the invasion was
, already underway.
j lan )acobs, Grenada's acting representative to the

Organization ot American States, told an OAS emer
gency session that his government had said it would
"willingly allow any Americans to leave or enter
freely," and called the U.S. doubts of the regime's
trustworthiness "a smokescreen."
Administration officials said they tried diplomacy,
but quickly abandoned it because the leftist
Grenadian military junta, which seized power Oct.
19, was too disorganized to deliver on any of its prom
ises. "We're satisfied that we took all the measures
we possibly could," State Department spokesper
son John Hughes said.
Bush tours Beirut bomb site
Beirut, Lebanon — Vice President George Bush
declared during a whirlwind four-hour visit to Beirut
yesterday that "we're not going to let a bunch of in
sidious terrorists, cowards, shape the foreign policy
of the United States."
Wearing a flak jacket and Marine helmet, Bush
toured the site of the massive explosion that col
lapsed the tour-story U.S. Marine administrative
headquarters building and barracks at Beirut airport
Sunday, killing at least 219 Marines and sailors and
injuring more than 75.
Visibly moved, the vice president said, "I hadn't
expected this much destruction. You've heard it.
You've read it. But until you feel, see it, see the size
of those reinforcing steel bars . . his voice trailed
off.
As the laborious picking apart ot the shattered,
steel-reinforced building continued for the fourth
day, Marines remained on their highest "condition
1" alert all day yesterday after their positions were
the taiget of early-morning fire by automatic weap
ons and rocket-propelled grenades.
"The shooting all along our eastern perimeter
stopped shortly before 7 a.m., when we fired two
rounds from an 81-milimeter mortar," Marine
spokesman Maj. Robert Jordan said.
The Marines also increased security measures
around their headquarters area at the airport, block
ing access roads to prevent a repetition of the
suicidal Sunday morning attack when an explosives
laden truck roared through the Marines' parking lot
and into the lobby of the headquarters building
before exploding.
At the site of the French peacekeeping force's
headquarters 1.2 miles away, where a second bomb
exploded Sunday, the toll of dead reached 53 as res
cue workers continued to dig into the collapsed
nine-story building.
In the first public description of what happened
when the French headquarters was attacked only
seconds after the Marines were hit, a French spokes
man, Col. Philippe De Longeaux, said that neighbor
hood residents had rushed to their windows when
they heard the airport explosion.
He said that they saw a small red truck speeding
toward the French force's building, then watched as
it smashed into the building's entrance and ex
ploded, almost instantly bringing the entire
structure down.
O'Neill supports efforts in Lebanon
Washington — In what was described as "the most
emotional speech of his career," House Speaker
Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass) yesterday apparently
scuttled a rebellion among House Democrats who
want a rapid withdrawal of Marines from Lebanon.
During a closed-door Democratic caucus, O'Neill
reportedly yelled and pounded his fist as he argued
with members of his own party that now is not the
time to "undermine" President Reagan's efforts to
resolve the Lebanon crisis, according to several who
attended the caucus.
"It was the most emotional speech I've ever heard
him make," said Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis), who said
the pitch had changed his mind on this issue.
"I had been planning to vote for a rapid
withdrawal from Lebanon, basically to send the

president a message," Aspin said.
But I decided that if the Speaker teels that
strongly, I'm inclined to vote with him."
O'Neill's plea came at a time when many
Democrats have been openly critical of the Speaker
tor his strong support of Reagan on Lebanon.
O'Neill's negotiated agreement with the President,
which resulted in passage of legislation allowing
Marines to stay in Lebanon for up to 18 more
months, has been especially criticized.
As one O'Neill aide put it,"The Speaker is very
old-fashioned about this. He believes that partisan
ship should stop at the water's edge."
However, O'Neill's view has frustrated and an
gered his opponents including Rep. Clarence Long
iD-Md) who had prepared an amendment to the
Defense Appropriations Bill cutting off tunds for
Marines in Lebanon after 30 days.
I think (O'Neill) made a great mistake to wrap the
mantle of Americanism around himself," long said
angrily after the caucus, "We're all Americans."
Atter the Speaker's booming denouncement of
the amendment, Long and his allies were forced to
change it to allow the White House to keep Marines
in Beirut until March 1.
"Obviously, the Speaker did get modifications (in
the Long amendment)," said Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-
Calit"). But when he finished up and said, 'You have
to do what you think is best for this country.' I
realized that what I think is best is somewhat differ
ent from what he thinks is best."
Andropov gives arms proposals
Moscow — Soviet President Yuri Andropov yester
day night announced new arms-control proposals to
demonstrate Soviet "flexibility" but said
that the Geneva talks will collapse when U.S.
medium-range nuclear missile deployments in
Western Europe get under way.
In an apparent bid to induce a delay in the U.S.
deployments, scheduled to start in December,
Andropov said the talks would continue if the
United States "renounced the deployment of its
missiles in Europe within the announced
deadlines."
Andropov disclosed that Moscow is now prepared
to cut down to "about 140" the number of its triple
warhead SS-20 missiles in the European theater. This
he added, "is noticeably less" than the combined
number of French and British nuclear delivery sys
tems.
Andropov reaffirmed his earlier assertion that
Moscow would "liquidate" all other missiles, in
cluding the SS-20s, in the European theater if an
agreement were to be reached at Geneva. Yesterday
night, he went a step further by asserting that no
new SS-20 missiles would be deployed in the Asian
part of the country if agreement were reached at
Geneva.
Moreover, the Soviet leader asserted he was
prepared to show additional flexibility on the ques
tion of medium-range nuclear-capable aircraft. He
said Moscow did not want to "undercut" the United
States on this issue despite the fact that the Soviet
Union did not have similar aircraft in Third World
countries capable of reaching the United States.
The package was interpreted by western
specialists here as containing both "cosmetic"
changes and substantive ones.
The timing of Andropov's proposal was signifi
cant, as it comes at a time of divisions within the
western alliance over the American invasion of
Grenada. It also coincides with a series of anti
nuclear demonstrations in Western Europe and
presumably was designed to increase pressures on
Western European governments to seek a delay in
U.S. deployments.
But the subtle substantive shifts appear to have
been designed to precede next month's scheduled
West German parliamentary debate on the deploy
ment questions and at the same time to calm fears
generated in China and Japan over a possible SS-20
build up in Asia.

Speaking in an interview with the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda, Andropov rejected a view
held in the west that the Russians would begin to
negotiate in earnest in Geneva once Pershing II and
cruise missiles were deployed.
He described such views as "an utter deception
designed to dampen the intensity of the struggle by
the West European peoples against the appearance
of American nuclear missiles in Europe."
"Everything must be totally clear here," he said.
"The appearance of new American missiles in West
ern Europe will make continuation of the present
talks in Geneva impossible. On the other hand, the
Geneva talks can be continued if the United States
does not start the actual deployment of missiles."
Treasury announces record deficit
Washington — It's official: The federal deficit for
the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 set a record of
$195.4 billion, the Treasury Department announced
yesterday.
The new record, enormous as it is, represents
something of a triumph for the Reagan administra
tion. The administration had predicted as recently as
three months ago that the deficit, which never had
exceeded $100 billion before fiscal 1982, would burst
through the $200 billion mark in fiscal 1983.
Hut by any measure, the actual deficit still is im
pressive, these comparisons show:
—The $195.4 billion is nearly double the previous
record of $110.7 billion, set only the year before.
—It is larger than total federal outlays for any year
before 1967.
—It is larger than the cumulative federal deficit from
the beginning of the republic through fiscal 1944,
when World War II was causing deficits that were
then setting records.
The Office of Management and Budget gave con
siderable credit for the smaller-than-expected deficit
to the summer drought, which reduced agricultural
supplies and drove up farm prices. As a result, many
farmers bought back their crops from the
Agriculture Department so that they could sell them
for more on the open market.
Agricultural outlays for fiscal 1983 fell $3 billion the
July estimate.
Defense spending, although a record $205 billion,
was $3.9 billion lower than estimated three months
ago, for a variety of reasons. Inflation in goods pur
chased by the Defense Department proved less than
expected, for example, and contract delays in the
purchase of some weapons systems pushed costs
into the next fiscal year.
Sales to foreign governments of military equip
ment also contributed and greater sales than ex
pected provided $1.4 billion in increased revenue.
Altogether, spending totaled $795.9 billion, nearly
$70 billion more than in the previous year but $14.5
billion less than the )uly estimate.
Stock prices drift lower
New York — Stock prices drifted lower yesterday
as traders kept a cautious eye on developments in
the American invasion of Grenada.
Precious metals and some technology stocks were
the most notable losers, while many utility issues
gained ground.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 8.64 to
1243.80, bringing its loss since it reached a record
closing high of 1284.65 on Oct. 10 to 40.85 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to
79.57 million shares, against 82.53 million in the pre
vious session.
Today's weather
Sunny through tomorrow except for lingering
overnight fog near the ocean. Highs from 65 to 70 at

Troops rescue students in Grenada
Washington — American combat troops com
pleted the rescue of United States students from
Cuban and Grenadian control yesterday and, in the
face of diminishing resistance, appeared ready to
wind up their conquest of the tiny Caribbean island
and its two-week-old leftist government.
About 36 hours after 1900 U.S. Marines and Army
Rangers and other troops stormed ashore, helicop
ters lifted the last American students from the Grand
Anse campus of St. George's University Medical
School, where Cuban and Grenadian armed forces

killed and 33 wounded, with eight listed as missing
in action.
Although U.S. officials continued to say that the
operation was proceeding smoothly, Gen. John Ves
sey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowl
edged that the defense of the island — particularly
by Cubans — had been stiffer and better organized
than U.S. planners had anticipated. An additional
1000 army paratroopers were sent to Grenada Wed
nesday to back up the original invading force.
However, administration officials clearly an
tic ipated that the fighting would soon be over today,
when President Reagan delivers a nationally
televised address at 8 p.m. EDT on both the crisis in
Lebanon and the invasion of Grenada. More than
that, they were anxious to bring the operation to a
close in order to minimize widespread opposition to
the move both at home and abroad.
Congressional criticism of the intervention
mounted as the fighting apparently neared an end.
Demonstrators took to the streets in Washington,
and journalists lodged strong complaints about the
administration's sharp restrictions on news from the
island.
Weinberger refused to say when he expected
American troops to begin leaving the island, but he
| predic ted it would be "very soon — days or weeks."
"We want to withdraw as many of our troops as
we possibly can," he told reporters.
The United States landed about 800 paratroopers
in Grenada today to reinforce the almost 2000-strong
U.S. invasion lorce, crushed Cuban resistance and
began evacuating Americans. Pentagon sources re
ported six U.S. troops killed, eight missing and 33
wounded.
A Cuban government announcement in Havana
said six helicopter gunships attacked Cuban posi
tions on Grenada before dawn yesterday, destroying
the Cubans' main building at the Point Salines air
field. It said the last six Cuban defenders
"sacrificed" themselves rather than surrender.
The Barbados state-owned Caribbean Broadcast
ing Co. said at least 30 Cubans were killed in the at
tack. It said Grenadian troops in armoured cars and
snipers in houses were firing on American forces
j trying to advance into the southern part of St.
Georges, the capital.
Another report by the radio said the landing force
"rescued" the British governor general, Sir Paul
Scoon, from house arrest in St. George's. The U.S.
government said it wants Scoon to form a provincial
government. There was no mention of the man who
led last week's bloody coup, Gen. Hudson Austin.
Reagan rejects evacuation offers
Washington — Grenada's leftist military rulers of
fered at least twice to help evacuate American
citizens from the island prior to the U.S. invasion,
but President Reagan rejected the offers as un
trustworthy and ordered troop movements to go
ahead, U.S. officials said yesterday.
As late as Monday, on the eve of the U.S. military
action, the Grenadians sent Washington a
diplomatic note giving assurances that U.S. citizens
were free to leave. But the Reagan administration
sent back a message saying that it could not respond
because it did not consider Grenada's military go
vernment to be a legitimate authority.
"It was a floating crap game down there and we
never knew who was in charge," White House
spokesperson Larry Speakes told reporters yester
day, in explaining the President's decision. "There
was just no way . . . that we could be at all assured
that their promises would be kept."
"It we felt we could have accomplished this short
of a military operation, we would have," he said.
"Bui we did n't believe a word they said."
Grenadian and Cuban officials charged yesterday
that the United States thus ignored opportunities to
assure the safety of the estimated 1000 Americans in
Grenada through diplomacy, and mounted the inva
sion solely to overthrow the leftist regime.
"This was an application of a philosophy and a
policy of force, and attempts are being made to ex
tend it to the entire world," Cuban President Fidel
Castro said in a Havana press conference.
He said Cuba, too, had offered last week to
cooperate in any evacuation efforts, but the United
States ignored the message until the invasion was
, already underway.
j lan )acobs, Grenada's acting representative to the

Organization ot American States, told an OAS emer
gency session that his government had said it would
"willingly allow any Americans to leave or enter
freely," and called the U.S. doubts of the regime's
trustworthiness "a smokescreen."
Administration officials said they tried diplomacy,
but quickly abandoned it because the leftist
Grenadian military junta, which seized power Oct.
19, was too disorganized to deliver on any of its prom
ises. "We're satisfied that we took all the measures
we possibly could," State Department spokesper
son John Hughes said.
Bush tours Beirut bomb site
Beirut, Lebanon — Vice President George Bush
declared during a whirlwind four-hour visit to Beirut
yesterday that "we're not going to let a bunch of in
sidious terrorists, cowards, shape the foreign policy
of the United States."
Wearing a flak jacket and Marine helmet, Bush
toured the site of the massive explosion that col
lapsed the tour-story U.S. Marine administrative
headquarters building and barracks at Beirut airport
Sunday, killing at least 219 Marines and sailors and
injuring more than 75.
Visibly moved, the vice president said, "I hadn't
expected this much destruction. You've heard it.
You've read it. But until you feel, see it, see the size
of those reinforcing steel bars . . his voice trailed
off.
As the laborious picking apart ot the shattered,
steel-reinforced building continued for the fourth
day, Marines remained on their highest "condition
1" alert all day yesterday after their positions were
the taiget of early-morning fire by automatic weap
ons and rocket-propelled grenades.
"The shooting all along our eastern perimeter
stopped shortly before 7 a.m., when we fired two
rounds from an 81-milimeter mortar," Marine
spokesman Maj. Robert Jordan said.
The Marines also increased security measures
around their headquarters area at the airport, block
ing access roads to prevent a repetition of the
suicidal Sunday morning attack when an explosives
laden truck roared through the Marines' parking lot
and into the lobby of the headquarters building
before exploding.
At the site of the French peacekeeping force's
headquarters 1.2 miles away, where a second bomb
exploded Sunday, the toll of dead reached 53 as res
cue workers continued to dig into the collapsed
nine-story building.
In the first public description of what happened
when the French headquarters was attacked only
seconds after the Marines were hit, a French spokes
man, Col. Philippe De Longeaux, said that neighbor
hood residents had rushed to their windows when
they heard the airport explosion.
He said that they saw a small red truck speeding
toward the French force's building, then watched as
it smashed into the building's entrance and ex
ploded, almost instantly bringing the entire
structure down.
O'Neill supports efforts in Lebanon
Washington — In what was described as "the most
emotional speech of his career," House Speaker
Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass) yesterday apparently
scuttled a rebellion among House Democrats who
want a rapid withdrawal of Marines from Lebanon.
During a closed-door Democratic caucus, O'Neill
reportedly yelled and pounded his fist as he argued
with members of his own party that now is not the
time to "undermine" President Reagan's efforts to
resolve the Lebanon crisis, according to several who
attended the caucus.
"It was the most emotional speech I've ever heard
him make," said Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis), who said
the pitch had changed his mind on this issue.
"I had been planning to vote for a rapid
withdrawal from Lebanon, basically to send the

president a message," Aspin said.
But I decided that if the Speaker teels that
strongly, I'm inclined to vote with him."
O'Neill's plea came at a time when many
Democrats have been openly critical of the Speaker
tor his strong support of Reagan on Lebanon.
O'Neill's negotiated agreement with the President,
which resulted in passage of legislation allowing
Marines to stay in Lebanon for up to 18 more
months, has been especially criticized.
As one O'Neill aide put it,"The Speaker is very
old-fashioned about this. He believes that partisan
ship should stop at the water's edge."
However, O'Neill's view has frustrated and an
gered his opponents including Rep. Clarence Long
iD-Md) who had prepared an amendment to the
Defense Appropriations Bill cutting off tunds for
Marines in Lebanon after 30 days.
I think (O'Neill) made a great mistake to wrap the
mantle of Americanism around himself," long said
angrily after the caucus, "We're all Americans."
Atter the Speaker's booming denouncement of
the amendment, Long and his allies were forced to
change it to allow the White House to keep Marines
in Beirut until March 1.
"Obviously, the Speaker did get modifications (in
the Long amendment)," said Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-
Calit"). But when he finished up and said, 'You have
to do what you think is best for this country.' I
realized that what I think is best is somewhat differ
ent from what he thinks is best."
Andropov gives arms proposals
Moscow — Soviet President Yuri Andropov yester
day night announced new arms-control proposals to
demonstrate Soviet "flexibility" but said
that the Geneva talks will collapse when U.S.
medium-range nuclear missile deployments in
Western Europe get under way.
In an apparent bid to induce a delay in the U.S.
deployments, scheduled to start in December,
Andropov said the talks would continue if the
United States "renounced the deployment of its
missiles in Europe within the announced
deadlines."
Andropov disclosed that Moscow is now prepared
to cut down to "about 140" the number of its triple
warhead SS-20 missiles in the European theater. This
he added, "is noticeably less" than the combined
number of French and British nuclear delivery sys
tems.
Andropov reaffirmed his earlier assertion that
Moscow would "liquidate" all other missiles, in
cluding the SS-20s, in the European theater if an
agreement were to be reached at Geneva. Yesterday
night, he went a step further by asserting that no
new SS-20 missiles would be deployed in the Asian
part of the country if agreement were reached at
Geneva.
Moreover, the Soviet leader asserted he was
prepared to show additional flexibility on the ques
tion of medium-range nuclear-capable aircraft. He
said Moscow did not want to "undercut" the United
States on this issue despite the fact that the Soviet
Union did not have similar aircraft in Third World
countries capable of reaching the United States.
The package was interpreted by western
specialists here as containing both "cosmetic"
changes and substantive ones.
The timing of Andropov's proposal was signifi
cant, as it comes at a time of divisions within the
western alliance over the American invasion of
Grenada. It also coincides with a series of anti
nuclear demonstrations in Western Europe and
presumably was designed to increase pressures on
Western European governments to seek a delay in
U.S. deployments.
But the subtle substantive shifts appear to have
been designed to precede next month's scheduled
West German parliamentary debate on the deploy
ment questions and at the same time to calm fears
generated in China and Japan over a possible SS-20
build up in Asia.

Speaking in an interview with the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda, Andropov rejected a view
held in the west that the Russians would begin to
negotiate in earnest in Geneva once Pershing II and
cruise missiles were deployed.
He described such views as "an utter deception
designed to dampen the intensity of the struggle by
the West European peoples against the appearance
of American nuclear missiles in Europe."
"Everything must be totally clear here," he said.
"The appearance of new American missiles in West
ern Europe will make continuation of the present
talks in Geneva impossible. On the other hand, the
Geneva talks can be continued if the United States
does not start the actual deployment of missiles."
Treasury announces record deficit
Washington — It's official: The federal deficit for
the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 set a record of
$195.4 billion, the Treasury Department announced
yesterday.
The new record, enormous as it is, represents
something of a triumph for the Reagan administra
tion. The administration had predicted as recently as
three months ago that the deficit, which never had
exceeded $100 billion before fiscal 1982, would burst
through the $200 billion mark in fiscal 1983.
Hut by any measure, the actual deficit still is im
pressive, these comparisons show:
—The $195.4 billion is nearly double the previous
record of $110.7 billion, set only the year before.
—It is larger than total federal outlays for any year
before 1967.
—It is larger than the cumulative federal deficit from
the beginning of the republic through fiscal 1944,
when World War II was causing deficits that were
then setting records.
The Office of Management and Budget gave con
siderable credit for the smaller-than-expected deficit
to the summer drought, which reduced agricultural
supplies and drove up farm prices. As a result, many
farmers bought back their crops from the
Agriculture Department so that they could sell them
for more on the open market.
Agricultural outlays for fiscal 1983 fell $3 billion the
July estimate.
Defense spending, although a record $205 billion,
was $3.9 billion lower than estimated three months
ago, for a variety of reasons. Inflation in goods pur
chased by the Defense Department proved less than
expected, for example, and contract delays in the
purchase of some weapons systems pushed costs
into the next fiscal year.
Sales to foreign governments of military equip
ment also contributed and greater sales than ex
pected provided $1.4 billion in increased revenue.
Altogether, spending totaled $795.9 billion, nearly
$70 billion more than in the previous year but $14.5
billion less than the )uly estimate.
Stock prices drift lower
New York — Stock prices drifted lower yesterday
as traders kept a cautious eye on developments in
the American invasion of Grenada.
Precious metals and some technology stocks were
the most notable losers, while many utility issues
gained ground.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 8.64 to
1243.80, bringing its loss since it reached a record
closing high of 1284.65 on Oct. 10 to 40.85 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to
79.57 million shares, against 82.53 million in the pre
vious session.
Today's weather
Sunny through tomorrow except for lingering

Troops rescue students in Grenada
Washington — American combat troops com
pleted the rescue of United States students from
Cuban and Grenadian control yesterday and, in the
face of diminishing resistance, appeared ready to
wind up their conquest of the tiny Caribbean island
and its two-week-old leftist government.
About 36 hours after 1900 U.S. Marines and Army
Rangers and other troops stormed ashore, helicop
ters lifted the last American students from the Grand
Anse campus of St. George's University Medical
School, where Cuban and Grenadian armed forces
had held off American troops since Tuesday.
Word that the armed resistance had ended at the
campus on a beach southwest of the capital ot St.

Georges came as the first two planes to evacuate
U.S. citizens from the island, carrying a total of 141
passengers, landed at Charleston, S.C.
As the second day of the intensely controversial
intervention ended, Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger reported that six Americans had been
killed and 33 wounded, with eight listed as missing
in action.

tic ipated that the fighting would soon be over today,
when President Reagan delivers a nationally
televised address at 8 p.m. EDT on both the crisis in
Lebanon and the invasion of Grenada. More than
that, they were anxious to bring the operation to a
close in order to minimize widespread opposition to
the move both at home and abroad.
Congressional criticism of the intervention
mounted as the fighting apparently neared an end.
Demonstrators took to the streets in Washington,
and journalists lodged strong complaints about the
administration's sharp restrictions on news from the
island.
Weinberger refused to say when he expected
American troops to begin leaving the island, but he
| predic ted it would be "very soon — days or weeks."
"We want to withdraw as many of our troops as
we possibly can," he told reporters.
The United States landed about 800 paratroopers
in Grenada today to reinforce the almost 2000-strong
U.S. invasion lorce, crushed Cuban resistance and
began evacuating Americans. Pentagon sources re
ported six U.S. troops killed, eight missing and 33
wounded.
A Cuban government announcement in Havana
said six helicopter gunships attacked Cuban posi
tions on Grenada before dawn yesterday, destroying
the Cubans' main building at the Point Salines air
field. It said the last six Cuban defenders
"sacrificed" themselves rather than surrender.
The Barbados state-owned Caribbean Broadcast
ing Co. said at least 30 Cubans were killed in the at
tack. It said Grenadian troops in armoured cars and
snipers in houses were firing on American forces
j trying to advance into the southern part of St.
Georges, the capital.
Another report by the radio said the landing force
"rescued" the British governor general, Sir Paul
Scoon, from house arrest in St. George's. The U.S.
government said it wants Scoon to form a provincial
government. There was no mention of the man who
led last week's bloody coup, Gen. Hudson Austin.
Reagan rejects evacuation offers
Washington — Grenada's leftist military rulers of
fered at least twice to help evacuate American
citizens from the island prior to the U.S. invasion,
but President Reagan rejected the offers as un
trustworthy and ordered troop movements to go
ahead, U.S. officials said yesterday.
As late as Monday, on the eve of the U.S. military
action, the Grenadians sent Washington a
diplomatic note giving assurances that U.S. citizens
were free to leave. But the Reagan administration
sent back a message saying that it could not respond
because it did not consider Grenada's military go
vernment to be a legitimate authority.
"It was a floating crap game down there and we
never knew who was in charge," White House
spokesperson Larry Speakes told reporters yester
day, in explaining the President's decision. "There
was just no way . . . that we could be at all assured
that their promises would be kept."
"It we felt we could have accomplished this short
of a military operation, we would have," he said.
"Bui we did n't believe a word they said."
Grenadian and Cuban officials charged yesterday
that the United States thus ignored opportunities to
assure the safety of the estimated 1000 Americans in
Grenada through diplomacy, and mounted the inva
sion solely to overthrow the leftist regime.
"This was an application of a philosophy and a
policy of force, and attempts are being made to ex
tend it to the entire world," Cuban President Fidel
Castro said in a Havana press conference.
He said Cuba, too, had offered last week to
cooperate in any evacuation efforts, but the United
States ignored the message until the invasion was
, already underway.
j lan )acobs, Grenada's acting representative to the

Organization ot American States, told an OAS emer
gency session that his government had said it would
"willingly allow any Americans to leave or enter
freely," and called the U.S. doubts of the regime's
trustworthiness "a smokescreen."
Administration officials said they tried diplomacy,
but quickly abandoned it because the leftist
Grenadian military junta, which seized power Oct.
19, was too disorganized to deliver on any of its prom
ises. "We're satisfied that we took all the measures
we possibly could," State Department spokesper
son John Hughes said.
Bush tours Beirut bomb site
Beirut, Lebanon — Vice President George Bush
declared during a whirlwind four-hour visit to Beirut
yesterday that "we're not going to let a bunch of in
sidious terrorists, cowards, shape the foreign policy
of the United States."
Wearing a flak jacket and Marine helmet, Bush
toured the site of the massive explosion that col
lapsed the tour-story U.S. Marine administrative
headquarters building and barracks at Beirut airport
Sunday, killing at least 219 Marines and sailors and
injuring more than 75.
Visibly moved, the vice president said, "I hadn't
expected this much destruction. You've heard it.
You've read it. But until you feel, see it, see the size
of those reinforcing steel bars . . his voice trailed
off.
As the laborious picking apart ot the shattered,
steel-reinforced building continued for the fourth
day, Marines remained on their highest "condition
1" alert all day yesterday after their positions were
the taiget of early-morning fire by automatic weap
ons and rocket-propelled grenades.
"The shooting all along our eastern perimeter
stopped shortly before 7 a.m., when we fired two
rounds from an 81-milimeter mortar," Marine
spokesman Maj. Robert Jordan said.
The Marines also increased security measures
around their headquarters area at the airport, block
ing access roads to prevent a repetition of the
suicidal Sunday morning attack when an explosives
laden truck roared through the Marines' parking lot
and into the lobby of the headquarters building
before exploding.
At the site of the French peacekeeping force's
headquarters 1.2 miles away, where a second bomb
exploded Sunday, the toll of dead reached 53 as res
cue workers continued to dig into the collapsed
nine-story building.
In the first public description of what happened
when the French headquarters was attacked only
seconds after the Marines were hit, a French spokes
man, Col. Philippe De Longeaux, said that neighbor
hood residents had rushed to their windows when
they heard the airport explosion.
He said that they saw a small red truck speeding
toward the French force's building, then watched as
it smashed into the building's entrance and ex
ploded, almost instantly bringing the entire
structure down.
O'Neill supports efforts in Lebanon
Washington — In what was described as "the most
emotional speech of his career," House Speaker
Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass) yesterday apparently
scuttled a rebellion among House Democrats who
want a rapid withdrawal of Marines from Lebanon.
During a closed-door Democratic caucus, O'Neill
reportedly yelled and pounded his fist as he argued
with members of his own party that now is not the
time to "undermine" President Reagan's efforts to
resolve the Lebanon crisis, according to several who
attended the caucus.
"It was the most emotional speech I've ever heard
him make," said Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis), who said
the pitch had changed his mind on this issue.
"I had been planning to vote for a rapid
withdrawal from Lebanon, basically to send the

president a message," Aspin said.
But I decided that if the Speaker teels that
strongly, I'm inclined to vote with him."
O'Neill's plea came at a time when many
Democrats have been openly critical of the Speaker
tor his strong support of Reagan on Lebanon.
O'Neill's negotiated agreement with the President,
which resulted in passage of legislation allowing
Marines to stay in Lebanon for up to 18 more
months, has been especially criticized.
As one O'Neill aide put it,"The Speaker is very
old-fashioned about this. He believes that partisan
ship should stop at the water's edge."
However, O'Neill's view has frustrated and an
gered his opponents including Rep. Clarence Long
iD-Md) who had prepared an amendment to the
Defense Appropriations Bill cutting off tunds for
Marines in Lebanon after 30 days.
I think (O'Neill) made a great mistake to wrap the
mantle of Americanism around himself," long said
angrily after the caucus, "We're all Americans."
Atter the Speaker's booming denouncement of
the amendment, Long and his allies were forced to
change it to allow the White House to keep Marines
in Beirut until March 1.
"Obviously, the Speaker did get modifications (in
the Long amendment)," said Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-
Calit"). But when he finished up and said, 'You have
to do what you think is best for this country.' I
realized that what I think is best is somewhat differ
ent from what he thinks is best."
Andropov gives arms proposals
Moscow — Soviet President Yuri Andropov yester
day night announced new arms-control proposals to
demonstrate Soviet "flexibility" but said
that the Geneva talks will collapse when U.S.
medium-range nuclear missile deployments in
Western Europe get under way.
In an apparent bid to induce a delay in the U.S.
deployments, scheduled to start in December,
Andropov said the talks would continue if the
United States "renounced the deployment of its
missiles in Europe within the announced
deadlines."
Andropov disclosed that Moscow is now prepared
to cut down to "about 140" the number of its triple
warhead SS-20 missiles in the European theater. This
he added, "is noticeably less" than the combined
number of French and British nuclear delivery sys
tems.
Andropov reaffirmed his earlier assertion that
Moscow would "liquidate" all other missiles, in
cluding the SS-20s, in the European theater if an
agreement were to be reached at Geneva. Yesterday
night, he went a step further by asserting that no
new SS-20 missiles would be deployed in the Asian
part of the country if agreement were reached at
Geneva.
Moreover, the Soviet leader asserted he was
prepared to show additional flexibility on the ques
tion of medium-range nuclear-capable aircraft. He
said Moscow did not want to "undercut" the United
States on this issue despite the fact that the Soviet
Union did not have similar aircraft in Third World
countries capable of reaching the United States.
The package was interpreted by western
specialists here as containing both "cosmetic"
changes and substantive ones.
The timing of Andropov's proposal was signifi
cant, as it comes at a time of divisions within the
western alliance over the American invasion of
Grenada. It also coincides with a series of anti
nuclear demonstrations in Western Europe and
presumably was designed to increase pressures on
Western European governments to seek a delay in
U.S. deployments.
But the subtle substantive shifts appear to have
been designed to precede next month's scheduled
West German parliamentary debate on the deploy
ment questions and at the same time to calm fears
generated in China and Japan over a possible SS-20
build up in Asia.

Speaking in an interview with the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda, Andropov rejected a view
held in the west that the Russians would begin to
negotiate in earnest in Geneva once Pershing II and
cruise missiles were deployed.
He described such views as "an utter deception
designed to dampen the intensity of the struggle by
the West European peoples against the appearance
of American nuclear missiles in Europe."
"Everything must be totally clear here," he said.
"The appearance of new American missiles in West
ern Europe will make continuation of the present
talks in Geneva impossible. On the other hand, the
Geneva talks can be continued if the United States
does not start the actual deployment of missiles."
Treasury announces record deficit
Washington — It's official: The federal deficit for
the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 set a record of
$195.4 billion, the Treasury Department announced
yesterday.
The new record, enormous as it is, represents
something of a triumph for the Reagan administra
tion. The administration had predicted as recently as
three months ago that the deficit, which never had
exceeded $100 billion before fiscal 1982, would burst
through the $200 billion mark in fiscal 1983.
Hut by any measure, the actual deficit still is im
pressive, these comparisons show:
—The $195.4 billion is nearly double the previous
record of $110.7 billion, set only the year before.
—It is larger than total federal outlays for any year
before 1967.
—It is larger than the cumulative federal deficit from
the beginning of the republic through fiscal 1944,
when World War II was causing deficits that were
then setting records.
The Office of Management and Budget gave con
siderable credit for the smaller-than-expected deficit
to the summer drought, which reduced agricultural
supplies and drove up farm prices. As a result, many
farmers bought back their crops from the
Agriculture Department so that they could sell them
for more on the open market.
Agricultural outlays for fiscal 1983 fell $3 billion the
July estimate.
Defense spending, although a record $205 billion,
was $3.9 billion lower than estimated three months
ago, for a variety of reasons. Inflation in goods pur
chased by the Defense Department proved less than
expected, for example, and contract delays in the
purchase of some weapons systems pushed costs
into the next fiscal year.
Sales to foreign governments of military equip
ment also contributed and greater sales than ex
pected provided $1.4 billion in increased revenue.
Altogether, spending totaled $795.9 billion, nearly
$70 billion more than in the previous year but $14.5
billion less than the )uly estimate.
Stock prices drift lower
New York — Stock prices drifted lower yesterday
as traders kept a cautious eye on developments in
the American invasion of Grenada.
Precious metals and some technology stocks were
the most notable losers, while many utility issues
gained ground.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 8.64 to
1243.80, bringing its loss since it reached a record
closing high of 1284.65 on Oct. 10 to 40.85 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to
79.57 million shares, against 82.53 million in the pre
vious session.
Today's weather
Sunny through tomorrow except for lingering

Troops rescue students in Grenada
Washington — American combat troops com
pleted the rescue of United States students from
Cuban and Grenadian control yesterday and, in the
face of diminishing resistance, appeared ready to
wind up their conquest of the tiny Caribbean island
and its two-week-old leftist government.
About 36 hours after 1900 U.S. Marines and Army
Rangers and other troops stormed ashore, helicop
ters lifted the last American students from the Grand
Anse campus of St. George's University Medical
School, where Cuban and Grenadian armed forces
had held off American troops since Tuesday.
Word that the armed resistance had ended at the
campus on a beach southwest of the capital ot St.

Georges came as the first two planes to evacuate
U.S. citizens from the island, carrying a total of 141
passengers, landed at Charleston, S.C.
As the second day of the intensely controversial
intervention ended, Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger reported that six Americans had been
killed and 33 wounded, with eight listed as missing
in action.
Although U.S. officials continued to say that the
operation was proceeding smoothly, Gen. John Ves
sey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowl
edged that the defense of the island — particularly
by Cubans — had been stiffer and better organized
than U.S. planners had anticipated. An additional
1000 army paratroopers were sent to Grenada Wed
nesday to back up the original invading force.
However, administration officials clearly an
tic ipated that the fighting would soon be over today,
when President Reagan delivers a nationally
