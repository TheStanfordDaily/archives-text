John Anderson, a former Con
gressman and a probable
presidential candidate in 1984,
yesterday spoke here as part of
an effort to rally support for a
third national political party, tel
ling three campus audiences yes
terday the United States should
"change (its) thinking on national
survival, and only a new party can
do that."
Anderson, who is trying to or
ganize the National Unity Party,
Anderson appeared at the Delta
Upsilon House, Branner Hall and
Kresge Auditorium.
The reason the nation needs a
new political party is that "the
two major parties have become
entangled in the web of special
interests, and thus have allowed
those interests to set the agenda
for them.
"I am disturbed that both old
parties have been captured by
the interests which they should
be mediating," Anderson said.
Anderson, a guest professor here
in spring quarter, 1981, noted
several times in his presentations
that money has always tended to
corrupt the political process.
In order to avoid that problem
the National Unity Party would
refuse to accept contributions
from Political Action Committees
(P.A.C.) and so would be able to
take advantage of the idea most
appropriate for a situation with
out regard for which interest
groups it effects.
Once the party has that

freedom, Anderson feels that it
will fundamentally reconsider the
basis on which the government is
run. A major plank of the Nation
al Unity Party is national defense.
Free from ties to the military in
dustrial complex, the party, An
derson believes, would pursue a
policy based on international law

and order, rather than one based
on "vigilantism."
Anderson said he is trying to
begin a new political party with
the thought that "the tyranny of
ideas of the past can be broken
by a party willing to think in
terms not of reclaiming the past
but of reconquering the future."
