## Randhava: the Sikh man under the turban 
### RACHANA KAMTEKAR 
Did you park your car in a
"Security Vehicles Only"
zone today? It you did, the
sight of Parking Inspector
M.S. Randhava zooming
down Campus Drive in his
sleek blue three-wheeler is
probably enough to make
your blood run cold.
Randhava is one ot the
Stanford Police Depart
ment's six parking officers
on campus. But he's prob
ably better known as the
man with the blue turban
— which, although it
matches his uniform, isn't
really regulation.
"I wear this turban be
cause of my religion: Sik
khism", says Randhava.
Sikkhism is a progressive
offshoot of Hinduism. Sikh
males are not allowed to
cut their hair, so they wear
it tied up in a turban.
"I'm the first Sikh in the
department here, actually,
the first Sikh in the police
in the Bay Area. They had to
make an exception for me
about wearing a turban,"
says Randhava, fixing a
searing glare on a yellow
Chevette nosing around a
restricted parking area.
Defeated, the Chevette
backs away, and the inspec
tor's glare fades.
Randhava began working
on the Stanford campus six
years ago on night duty.
Last year he was transferred
to daytime work.
"I much prefer this, be
cause I have a chance to
see students, talk to them,
explain to them about my
religion," he explained.
On the subject of parking

offenses, Randhava has
mixed feelings about Stan
ford students.
"Some of them are diffi
cult — they say, 'I'm in a
hurry; I have to get to class'
— and they don't move the
car. I give about 50 tickets
in one day — the police de
partment here issues an
average of 300 every day,
and it's the same cars over
and over again. But most
students are very
cooperative; they say
'sorry' and move their

cars.
As a parking inspector,
Randhava says he has to
handle all types of people.
"Last week, a visiting
professor parked in an 'A'
zone area, and I gave him a
ticket after waiting forty
minutes for him to come
back. When he saw the
ticket, he got very angry
and said he was a guest
here, why did he have to
pay? I said sorry, he could
get a temporary parking
permit, and he shouldn't

be angry, please, because I
had to do my job. So he
said, 'Ask (University Presi
dent) Donald Kennedy to
pay for my parking ticket,
then — he invited me
here.' "
Randhava first came to
the U.S. from India in 1976.
Before moving here, he
spent 30 years in New
Delhi, where he went to
college. Then he moved to
Western India to go to law
school, worked as a coal
miner for six years, as a

construction miner for
several more and then
moved to San Jose. He
worked for Atari for a few
years before joining the
Stanford Police Depart
ment.
With that much under his
belt — or tuban, as the case
may be — Randhava is
hard-pressed to say where
he'll go next.
"I'll stay for five years
while my son's at UC-San
Francisco," he says. "After
that, who knows?"
