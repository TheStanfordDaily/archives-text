# Admit Reagan to Stanford

STANFORD professors don't have to like
P.onald Reagan to like the proposal for a
presidential library, museum and public
affairs center on campus — but it helps.
Most universities would give a ton of ivy
and a good right tackle for the academic
resources and prestige of a presidential
library complex. But a few liberal Stanford
professors don t want the university associ
ated with a conservative president — espe
cially if it would expand the conservative
influence of the Hoover Institution, which has
taken a leading role in getting the Reagan
library and proposes to run the public affairs
center
"Some people around here are already jok
ing about changing the name of the university
to Ronald Reagan University," said John Man
ley, a political science professor Manley and
other faculty members charged Hoover with
partisan bias in a petition drive this spring,
complaining that 43 Hoover scholars had cur
rent or former ties with the Reagan adminis
tration. Stanford trustees formed a committee
to study the university's relationship with the
quasi-independent think tank
Stanford President Donald Kennedy also
has named a committee to report by Saturday
on the academic value of the Reagan com
plex. and Hoover Director W Glenn Campbell
has his own committee advisinfi him on the
public affairs center
The academic value of a presidential
library, which would be open to Stanford stu
dents and faculty as well as visiting scholars,
is unquestionable The library would include
the papers of presidential advisers. Cabinet
members, ambassadors and others associated
with the office, as well as Reagan's personal
documents. Hoover already has Reagan's
gubernatorial papers and presidential cam
paign files
The museum would contain educational
exhibits historic documents, photographs,
videotapes and the like — but no souvenirs or
presidential bric-a-brac, presidential aide Ed
Meese ha- promised
The library and museum would be built
with private donations and run by the
National Archives at government expense As
taxpayers, we hope the complex will

come in under the proposed 160,000 square
feet; that's comparable to the Johnson library,
which cost the government $2 million this
year to maintain.
Plans for the public affairs center include
conference facilities, overnight housing for
conferees and offices for visiting scholars
studying public policy issues.
Certainly, Stanford can't jump at the pro
posal without deciding how to handle as many
as 700,000 visitors to the museum in the first
year, expected to level off at 300,000 in follow
ing years. Already sites close the campus
center have been ruled out, but there are
several potential locations that minimize traf
fic problems.
Keeping the museum small and educational
— as opposed to the lavish shrine to LBJ at
the Lyndon B. Johnson Library at the Univer
sity of Texas — also would discourage casual
tourists and maintain the academic character
of the complex. (All but one of the presidential
libraries include museums.)
Perhaps the Hoover Institution should not
control the public affairs center, although
Hoover is expected to take the lead in raising
money to build and endow the center. That is a
legitimate subject for study, debate and nego
tiation. The feared "Reaganization" of
Stanford is a phony.
John F. Kennedy's library is located at the
University of Massachusetts, Gerald Ford's at
the University of Michigan, and Jimmy Cart
er's will be adjacent to Emorv University,
with a university-run policy center. Surely
Stanford can house a Reagan library without
endangering the university's identity or integ
rity Surely Stanford professors should be able
to distinguish between studying the Reagan
presidency and glorifying it
"As more and more Stanford faculty find
out about the proposal, they agree that it's a
great scholarly asset," says Hoover scholar
Martin Anderson, a former domestic policy
adviser to Reagan "Unfortunately, a small
number of Stanford faculty oppose the idea
for illegitimate reasons, political bias "
Like Anderson, we haven't heard any real
reasons for the opposition to the Reagan
library complex — just complaints from peo
ple who don't like his policies
