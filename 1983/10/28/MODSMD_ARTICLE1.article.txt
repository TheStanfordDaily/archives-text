# Kennedy tells faculty he supports Reagan library
## Action stalls as Reagan reviews plan 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
If President Reagan is to get a li
brary complex at Stanford, he will
have to do it Stanford's way — and
that, it became clear yesterday, is
not the Hoover Institution's way.

News analysis

University President Donald Ken
nedy's statement to the Faculty Sen
ate showed that the controversial
Hoover proposal to include a
Hoover-run public affairs center in
the complex is anathema not only to
extremist faculty members but also
to him and the majority of the Board
of Trustees.
Because the only reason the
White House wants Stanford as a li
brary site is because of Reagan's
long-time association with the
Hoover Institution, this blow to the
Hoover plan may mean that the
president will take his library and go
elsewhere.
Or it may not. It is almost as likely
that the president will accept the
deal on Stanford's terms, abandon
ing the notion of having a Reagan
center under Hoover's auspices.
Because it was Hoover and not the
White House that came up with the
idea to establish a library here, it is
not known if the president really
cares whether a public affairs center

built in his name is run by Hoover or
the University.
For months, Hoover scholars led
by Director W. Glenn Campbell and
Senior Fellow Martin Anderson have
advocated the idea of having a
Hoover-run public affairs center
here, and in recent weeks they have
made it apparent that they want it
badly.
But at the same time the proposed
center has emerged as the most
criticized element of the project,
largely because of widespread worry
about the effects of expanding
Hoover's role and influence on
campus.

Kennedy hinted yesterday that he
and the Board of Trustees share in
that concern. To a full house, Ken
nedy said the White House has
already been told that a center run
by the Hoover Institution "would
have little chance of approval" by
the Board.
Kennedy was speaking only for
himself, but what he proposed is al
most sure to be what the Board of
Trustees would be willing to ap
prove: a library, a small exhibit hall
and perhaps a policy center — but
one run by the University rather
than Hoover.
