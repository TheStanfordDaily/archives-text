## The
						Stanford Daily Reagan's domestic bomb 
### 
This week's third major news story was over
shadowed by reports from Grenada and
Lebanon, but like these foreign events the
firing of three members of the Civil Rights
Commission told us a lot about Ronald Reagan.
The President ousted the three members
who have sharply criticized his policies toward
minorities and women. He wanted to replace
them last May with three of his own team, in
cluding John Bunzel, a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution. The Senate refused
to act on these nominations, however, and
now the President is fighting back with a move
that will likely put the commission out of busi
ness.
The commission was established in 1957 as
an independent, bipartisan agency to investi
gate discrimination and to monitor the en
forcement of civil rights by federal agencies.
Unless Congress renews the commission's au
thorization next month — and Reagan is
leaving them little opportunity to do so — the
commission will die. The current commission
features only three members, two of whom are
Reagan appointees, and can't conduct busi
ness without a quorum. Thus the commission's
only lifeline is if Congress gives in, allowing

Reagan to control five out of the six seats.
The most attractive alternative is a resolution
introduced in both houses this week which
would put the commission under the control
of Congress. Reagan opposed an earlier com
promise measure which would divide appoint
ment power between the President and
Congress, and his latest act will probably not
leave Congress enough time to consider the
new proposal before the commission expires.
The ouster of the three commissioners is
clear evidence of Reagan's feelings, or lack
thereof, toward civil rights. The fired commis
sioners had criticized the administration
during the past two years for its position on af
firmative action and the erosion of civil rights
enforcement. With this week's firings, the
President has leveled another blow at civil
rights.
We do not know why Reagan chose the day
of the Grenada invasion to effectively destroy
the civil rights commission, but if he was
hoping to minimize the publicity of the firings
we hope he fails. The cause of civil rights is one
which this country must embrace, and Presi
dent Reagan's opposition to the movement
should not go unnoticed.
