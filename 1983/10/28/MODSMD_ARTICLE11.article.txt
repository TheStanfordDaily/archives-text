# Postage due
## 
### 
It's better than Pony Express — but not
much.
Rumor has it that the only way to get even
close to the Stanford post office during peak
hours these days is if you're selling refresh
ments, reading material or a cheap folding
chair.
Perhaps we exaggerate. But the situation at
the post office is grim. The usual long lines that
define autumn quarter are noticeably longer.
Postal clerks rarely man all four windows at any
given time. Employees are often overwhelmed
when mail for almost 7000 post office boxes
must be sorted each day. And customers walk
around campus with little yellow package
notification slips stuffed in their pockets,
waiting for the line to dwindle or their
schedule to accommodate the queue.
The post office recognizes that problems
have been brewing for several years, and
thankfully they are beginning to take action.
University administrators are meeting with
postal officials; some of the proposed changes
include sorting Stanford mail at a main post of
fice, adding two more service windows and in
stalling a dollar bill changer to facilitate the
purchase of stamps from machines. In addi
tion, plans for a self-service postal center —
where users could post letters, buy stamps and
weigh and mail parcels — in Wilbur parking lot
are being considered.
Most of these changes seem attractive.
While sorting mail off-campus may delay
delivery by one day, this may be necessary. A

complex in Wilbur parking lot could ease the
crowds at the White Plaza office and be a real
convenience to residents on that side of
campus. The prospect of adding more win
dows sounds great, but seems a bit useless if
the staff is already at the "maximum" level, as
postal administrators claim. They can't even
keep the existing windows manned.
But the most bothersome — and controver
sial — proposal is to build more post office
boxes. Many laud this as the solution to an in
sufficient number of boxes. But the real prob
lem is that students who don't need their
boxes because of a change in residence often
renew them anyway; others move away with
out informing the post office of their status.
Dorms like Wilbur, Florence Moore and Roble
don't get mail delivery and thus their residents
need P.O. boxes. But people who move from
one of these dorms into a row house or Gover
nor's Corner often renew their boxes merely
for convenience — and those who need a box
are out of luck.
It's inconvenient to change your address.
But it's selfish to commandeer two addresses
— which is effectively what these greedy box
mongers are doing —when some poor soul is
waiting in that unbearable line every day just to
see if his mail has a home yet.
The postman delivers in ail kinds of weather.
But whether or not you give up what you don't
need will determine whether the next guy gets
his mail.
