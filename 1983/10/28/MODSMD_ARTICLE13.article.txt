## The 						real threat to liberty 
### 
Hardy Callcott's column (Daily, Oct. 20) makes a
number of allegations about the Reagan administra
tion's civil liberties record that originate, I would
guess, less from a careful review of the facts than from
an anti-Reaganism that, like lichen to granite, has
become inseparable from the political outlook that
"progressive" members of the Stanford community are
expected to hold.
Let's deal first with Callcott's major confusion. The
contractual obligations that an individual willingly ac
cepts as a condition for accepting a government grant
or job should not be confused with basic civil liberties
If a professor agrees to accept a contract to do sensitive
defense research but there are restrictions on what can
be published and the restrictions are disliked, that
professor is perfectly free to apply to private founda
tions. The government's unwillingness to fund re
search on the professor's terms no more constitutes a
violation of rights than does the voluntarily accepted
restrictions on the disclosure of trade and other
proprietary secrets constitute a violation of the rights of
engineers working in private industry.
Restrictions on the right of government employees to
disseminate classified government documents, though
occasionally fraught with excessive caution, also have a
reasonable basis and have been repeatedly affirmed by
the federal courts. There are many secrets that, in the
wrong hands, could damage our nation's security.
Those pertaining to CIA espionage and FBI coun
terespionage operations could endanger the lives not
just of our own agents but of our penetration agents in
the East Bloc, who whatever their motives, are serving
the defense of the Western democracies against a
power that means us no good and has no respect for
civil liberties.'
And before condemning the State Department's
denial of visas to certain foreign nationals, it might pay
to check out the facts and put them in the proper per
spective. The fact is that some foreign nationals abuse
their access to our open society in order to acquire
technology and secrets for the Soviet Union and other
foreign powers.
Exchange scholars from the Soviet Union and other
East Bloc countries often have no choice but to run er
rands for the KGB if they hope to travel to the West.
Working as information gatherers or as "spotters" on

the lookout for U.S. citizens and lawful residents who
might be susceptible to recruitment as agents of influ
ence or espionage is often one of the conditions of
their travel.
Callcott's claim that the Reagan administration has
given the FBI permission to conduct surveillance on
domestic political groups is, I believe, quite untrue if he
means that the FBI is now free to engage in the kind of
COINTELPRO spying on domestic dissidents that tar
nished its image a decade ago.
The FBI, now as before, can conduct surveillance on
domestic groups when there are reasonable grounds
for believing that criminal activity is afoot (terrorists,
espionage, etc.) though no longer merely because of
the political or philosophical advocacy of such groups.
We must get over the naive and pernicious view that
whenever our government seeks to protect the
legitimate security interests of our democracy — in
defense, I must add, of our freedoms — it is only doing
so as a cover for an assault on our liberties.
As I continue to read the sampling of student
columns in The Daily, I'm much disheartened at how
the paranoia of Right McCarthyism which I and many of
my fellow students at Stanford strenuously opposed in
the 1950s and 1960s has simply been replaced by the
new paranoia of the Left. This new paranoia goes un
challenged, I suspect, because the Left succeeded in
persuading so many that anyone whe opposes com
munism must necessarily be a "McCarthyite" of some
kind.
Just as many liberals were tarred as "pinkos" merely
for reading socialist and Marxist literature or advocat
ing the right of Marxists to speak and be heard during
the 'SOs/so today, those of us who believe communism
poses a threat to Western freedoms and further believe
that our government should defend us from this threat
are either glibly dismissed as Cold War "reactionaries"
or accused of harboring anti-libertarian designs on the
Republic.
There is a real threat to our liberties. It comes from
the Soviet Union and it is aggravated by the willingness
of too many Americans to strip away the legitimate
defenses that our government seeks to erect against it.

domestic groups when there are reasonable grounds
for believing that criminal activity is afoot (terrorists,
espionage, etc.) though no longer merely because of
the political or philosophical advocacy of such groups.
We must get over the naive and pernicious view that
whenever our government seeks to protect the
legitimate security interests of our democracy — in
defense, I must add, of our freedoms — it is only doing
so as a cover for an assault on our liberties.
As I continue to read the sampling of student
columns in The Daily, I'm much disheartened at how
the paranoia of Right McCarthyism which I and many of
my fellow students at Stanford strenuously opposed in
the 1950s and 1960s has simply been replaced by the
new paranoia of the Left. This new paranoia goes un
challenged, I suspect, because the Left succeeded in
persuading so many that anyone whe opposes com
munism must necessarily be a "McCarthyite" of some
kind.
Just as many liberals were tarred as "pinkos" merely
for reading socialist and Marxist literature or advocat
ing the right of Marxists to speak and be heard during
the 'SOs/so today, those of us who believe communism
poses a threat to Western freedoms and further believe
that our government should defend us from this threat
are either glibly dismissed as Cold War "reactionaries"
or accused of harboring anti-libertarian designs on the
Republic.
There is a real threat to our liberties. It comes from
the Soviet Union and it is aggravated by the willingness
of too many Americans to strip away the legitimate
defenses that our government seeks to erect against it.
