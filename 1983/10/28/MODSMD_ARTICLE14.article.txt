# Robert Larkins: Gramps' Gripes
## Reagan complex is a golden opportunity for University 
### 
Last spring when all the contro
versy began about the Hoover Insti
tution, the arguments advanced by
the vocal minority attacking the In
stitution were incredibly circular.
The Institution, they contended, is
too "political" to be located here at
"independent, value-neutral" Stan
ford University. When reminded
that the individual political inclina
tions of the scholars are irrelevant
under the University's policy of aca
demic freedom and that the Institu
tion has never taken a stance on any
political issue, the attackers
retreated, changed their tune and
charged again. This time they at
tacked Hoover's role at Stanford.
When asked what they opposed
specifically, they answered with a
vague, "They have too much influ
ence." Pressed further, they added,
"Well . . . they have too much influ
ence for such a political group."
The same arguments used last
spring are being voiced now in op

position to the proposed presiden
tial library complex. The same vocal
minority who wave the same ban
ners about academic freedom are
committing the same hypocrisy. The
point that everyone seems to miss
and that I cannot over-emphasize is
that politics should have no role in
this debate. What we should look at
are the academic merits of the com
plex.
The proposed presidential com
plex, consisting of a library,
museum and public affairs center,
would contribute inestimably to the
resources of the University and the
pursuit of scholarship at Stanford.
And it wouldn't cost us a nickel.
Opponents charge that the library
would be political, but they can't ex
plain what they mean because they
have yet to figure out how a building
full of books and papers can be poli
tical. No one has ever challenged
the propriety of the Government

Documents collection at Green Li
brary.
The potential of the library, which
would be run by the National Ar
chives, is mind boggling. In a net

which, according to Hoover deputy

one quarter of all archives in the

work that would make the new
Socrates system look like a stone-
age card catalog, the University
would gain access to the entire re-

In order to provide the historial
context for scholar's research at the
library, the complex would contain a
small museum of the

presidency — the institution, not
the man. Museums are not built for
the present. In 2010, when most of
us will have children in college, how
many of us will remember the
Falklands Crisis, the failure of the
ERA, the Euromissile controversy, or
the President's trip to China sched
uled for next spring? These events
are hardly trivial, but without a
museum to remind future scholars
of the role they played during the
Reagan presidency it is unlikely that
their full significance will be ap
preciated.
The third component of the com
plex would be a public affairs cen
ter. Fellows at the center would be
selected by a national visiting fel
lows board, similar to the one which
now oversees Hoover's National
Fellows Program.
One of the most ridiculous argu
ments advanced against the com
plex is that it would cause too much
traffic and bring too many visitors to

Stanford. No one complains when
every home game 60,000 visitors and
their cars descend upon Stanford,
leaving the campus a pigpen in the
wake of their tailgaters. And people
here are rejoicing that 100,000
rowdies will "drop in" for the Super
Bowl in January of 1985. Where are
our priorities? The fact is that the
Rosse Committee predicts that traffic
would increase by less than 2 per
cent.
Politics are temporal. Disputes
over Reagan's policies should not
distract us from the issue. The cen
ter is ours for the asking; it's
Hoover's to administer. Rather than
criticizing Hoover, we ought to b?
thanking it, because it is Hoover that
makes it possible that we migh
capture this coveted academic trea
sure.

resources of the University and the
pursuit of scholarship at Stanford.
And it wouldn't cost us a nickel.
Opponents charge that the library
would be political, but they can't ex
plain what they mean because they
have yet to figure out how a building
full of books and papers can be poli
tical. No one has ever challenged
the propriety of the Government

Documents collection at Green Li
brary.
The potential of the library, which
would be run by the National Ar

which, according to Hoover deputy
archivist Charles Palm, "holds over
one quarter of all archives in the
United States."

The point that everyone seems to miss is
that politics should have no role in this
debate. What we should look at are the
academic merits of the complex.

In order to provide the historial
context for scholar's research at the
library, the complex would contain a
small museum of the

presidency — the institution, not
the man. Museums are not built for
the present. In 2010, when most of
us will have children in college, how
many of us will remember the
Falklands Crisis, the failure of the
ERA, the Euromissile controversy, or
the President's trip to China sched
uled for next spring? These events
are hardly trivial, but without a
museum to remind future scholars
of the role they played during the
Reagan presidency it is unlikely that
their full significance will be ap
preciated.
The third component of the com
plex would be a public affairs cen
ter. Fellows at the center would be
selected by a national visiting fel
lows board, similar to the one which
now oversees Hoover's National
Fellows Program.
One of the most ridiculous argu
ments advanced against the com
plex is that it would cause too much
traffic and bring too many visitors to

Stanford. No one complains when
every home game 60,000 visitors and
their cars descend upon Stanford,
leaving the campus a pigpen in the
wake of their tailgaters. And people
here are rejoicing that 100,000
rowdies will "drop in" for the Super
Bowl in January of 1985. Where are
our priorities? The fact is that the
Rosse Committee predicts that traffic
would increase by less than 2 per
cent.
Politics are temporal. Disputes
over Reagan's policies should not
distract us from the issue. The cen
ter is ours for the asking; it's
Hoover's to administer. Rather than
criticizing Hoover, we ought to b?
thanking it, because it is Hoover that
makes it possible that we migh
capture this coveted academic trea
sure.
