Campus art
One wonders what Ed Robbins'
viewpoint is in his article "The art
of avoiding campus sculptures"
(Daily, Oct. 18). The clever satirical
style that the article is written in
makes it hard to discern what he
thinks should reflect the aesthetic
sense of the Stanford community.
This is too small a space to
heighten Robbins' awareness of his
own paleo-aesthetic sense, which
for right now is all I can handle. To
call Kenneth Snelson's "Mozart I"
sculpture "the crumbling
chromium clothesline" is especially
ludicrous..
It is a sorry state of our elemen
tary and secondary educational
system that more people don't
appreciate modern contemporary
outdoor sculpture.

Energy brochures
In her letter to The Daily (Oct.
24), Mary Beth Willers suggests that
the recent energy conservation
brochure distributed to the Stan
ford community represented an
ineffective campaign equatable to
money being thrown away.
The $3000 spent for designing,
printing and distributing the bro
chure is equivalent to supplying the
campus with energy for two hours,
or less than the cost of erecting one
wall in a simple office renovation
project.
It is indeed unfortunate that the
brochure was sent to some who are
no longer on campus. It is more
unfortunate that some recipients
discarded it without a glance.
Energy management is
everybody's business.
