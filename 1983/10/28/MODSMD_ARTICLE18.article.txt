## The 						Card looks for win No. 2 
### ADAM BERNS 
Tomorrow afternoon the Stanford foot
ball team will try to keep its one game
winning streak alive against Oregon State
at Parker Stadium.
Last week, the Cardinal ended its
longest losing streak since 1960 by upset
ting then No. 19 ranked Arizona. While
Oregon State does not have the talent of
the Wildcats, it has performed better than
its 1-6 mark might indicate.
In many ways, the Beavers have more in
common with Stanford than just their
record. Like the Cardinal, Oregon State
has had a tendency to self destruct.
"They are a very profitable offensive
team," Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin said
about the Beavers. "They've been doing
many of the things that we've been
doing. They've just sort of self
destructed."
Oregon has had its problems offensive
ly. After losing its first two quarterbacks,
the Beavers were forced to use a senior
walk-on with no previous collegiate expe
rience.
"There is no question when we started
the season, we were a better football
team," said Oregon State Coach Joe
Avezzanno. "There was nothing more
damaging than the loss of Ricky Green
(OSU's starting quarterback). The impor
tant thing was that our team had a lot of
confidence in this young man. It put us in
a situation where we were playing a walk
on quarterback.

"The inexperience of this young man
really affects our offense, but he's im
proved each week. Where we have hurt
ourselves is turning the ball over."
One ot the most frustrating losses for
the Beavers was their loss to California.
Oregon State lost the game 45-19 while
outgaining the Bears in almost every cate
gory. In that game, Oregon State had
more than 500 yards of total offense.
Wiggin noted that the Beavers have
been throwing the ball much more this
year than in the past, although much of
this has been due to the adverse circum
stances in wh.ch the team has found it
self.
"They've gone to much more of a pass
oriented • 'me than I think they want to,"
Wiggin s. d. "They are a run-oriented
footb.'l te. m and they've had some awful
long r ir They've moved the ball very
well, the ,gh not in the end zone."
Oregon State's leading ball carrier is
senior fullback Bryce Oglesby who is the
top rusher in the conference. Oglesby
has rushed for 589 yards on 95 carries, an
average of 6.2 yards per carry.
"The bright spot for us has been
Oglesby," Avezzanno said. "He will
probably end the season as one of the
best rushers in the conference."
Avezzanno has not been pleased with
his defense, although he thinks that it is
improving.
"Defensively we have not been playing
hard enough," Avezzano explained.

"However, in the last two hallgames our
team has really made a reversal. In the last
two games we've had 10 or 11 sacks while
we had only one or two in the first four
weeks."
One advantage the Beavers will have is
that they have had two weeks to prepare
for this game because of a bye last week.
Avezzanno was as pleased with the extra
preparation time as he was with the
chance to let some of his players' injuries
heal.
For Stanford, injuries at the running
back slot could be a major problem.
"We're hurting at the halfback slot,"
Wiggin said. We just can t tool around
with it during the week which means that
the timing among our running backs is
likely to be on."
In the earlv part of this week, halfbacks
Thomas Henley, Kevin Scott and Shaun
Avant were all being held out of practice.
Last week, Stanford added some new
wrinkles to its passing game which
produced big dividends Saturday against
Arizona. Paye who was held to only 13
yards passing the previous week, con
nected on 22-of-28 passt s for 280 yards
and three touchdowns, using the quick
short passing game to open up the bigger
plays later in the game.
"The new passing game has helped our
running game," Wiggin said. "It's
developed off the pass. A lot of the
change also had to do with re
establishing the confidence of our young
quarterback."

confidence in this young man. It put us in
a situation where we were playing a walk
on quarterback.

"The inexperience of this young man
really affects our offense, but he's im
proved each week. Where we have hurt
ourselves is turning the ball over."
One ot the most frustrating losses for
the Beavers was their loss to California.
Oregon State lost the game 45-19 while
outgaining the Bears in almost every cate
gory. In that game, Oregon State had
more than 500 yards of total offense.
Wiggin noted that the Beavers have
been throwing the ball much more this
year than in the past, although much of
this has been due to the adverse circum
stances in wh.ch the team has found it
self.
"They've gone to much more of a pass
oriented • 'me than I think they want to,"
Wiggin s. d. "They are a run-oriented
footb.'l te. m and they've had some awful
long r ir They've moved the ball very
well, the ,gh not in the end zone."
Oregon State's leading ball carrier is
senior fullback Bryce Oglesby who is the
top rusher in the conference. Oglesby
has rushed for 589 yards on 95 carries, an
average of 6.2 yards per carry.
"The bright spot for us has been
Oglesby," Avezzanno said. "He will
probably end the season as one of the
best rushers in the conference."
Avezzanno has not been pleased with
his defense, although he thinks that it is
improving.
"Defensively we have not been playing
hard enough," Avezzano explained.

"However, in the last two hallgames our
team has really made a reversal. In the last
two games we've had 10 or 11 sacks while
we had only one or two in the first four
weeks."
One advantage the Beavers will have is
that they have had two weeks to prepare
for this game because of a bye last week.
Avezzanno was as pleased with the extra
preparation time as he was with the
chance to let some of his players' injuries
heal.
For Stanford, injuries at the running
back slot could be a major problem.
"We're hurting at the halfback slot,"
Wiggin said. We just can t tool around
with it during the week which means that
the timing among our running backs is
likely to be on."
In the earlv part of this week, halfbacks
Thomas Henley, Kevin Scott and Shaun
Avant were all being held out of practice.
Last week, Stanford added some new
wrinkles to its passing game which
produced big dividends Saturday against
Arizona. Paye who was held to only 13
yards passing the previous week, con
nected on 22-of-28 passt s for 280 yards
and three touchdowns, using the quick
short passing game to open up the bigger
plays later in the game.
"The new passing game has helped our
running game," Wiggin said. "It's
developed off the pass. A lot of the
change also had to do with re
establishing the confidence of our young
quarterback."
