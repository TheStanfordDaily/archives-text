# Warns that trustees are not likely to accept Hoover-administered public policy center
## 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Senior staff writer 
In a major statement on the proposal to house a
Reagan library complex here, University President
Donald Kennedy told the Faculty Senate yesterday that
he would welcome a presidential archive at Stanford,
but that the Board of Trustees probably would not ac
cept a proposed center for public affairs if it were ad
ministered by the Hoover Institution.
Kennedy also said a proposed Reagan museum
would be acceptable only if it were a "modest facility"
that was "structurally part of the (Reagan) library, dis
playing a select collection of educational materials from
the Reagan presidency rather than a broader set of 1
memorabilia."
Kennedy's statement essentially echoes the recom
mendations of a faculty advisory committee appointed
by Kennedy and headed by Economics Prof, lames
Rosse, but it will have much influence on the Board of
Trustees' decision as to whether or not the University
will accept the complex. The Board will meet in Decem
ber, at which time it may vote to accept or refuse the
White House's offer.
Kennedy said he has mailed the text of his statement
to Washington and that the University is "now at a
point where we (the University) must wait for a
response from the White House before we go further."
White House Counselor Fdwin Meese has urged the
University to come to a speedy decision regarding the
complex, but Kennedy said yesterday that he and
William Kimball, president of the Board of Trustees,
have separately informed the White House that "to
work out a satisfactory proposal for (a center for public
affairs) would require substantially more time than the
schedule Mr. Meese was suggesting would seem to al
low."
Kennedy said a public affairs center could be an im
portant asset to the University, but it should "involve
programs that must be harmonized with and contribute

to a broad range of academic activities across the
(University).
"These qualities," continued Kennedy, "mandate a
center which is part of our normal academic and ad
ministrative structure — part of the University as a
whole — rather than an extension of the Hoover Insti
tution."
Though attendance at the senate meeting yesterday
was unusually high, reaction to Kennedy's statement
was mild. Discussion was limited, however, because
Kennedy left an hour and 45 minutes into the meeting
to attend the dedication of Governor's Corner, a new
student housing facility.
Discussion on the Reagan complex will continue on
Nov. 10 at the next senate meeting, according to Senate
Chair Craig Heller.
Some professors expressed concern that the Univer
sity might seem to be endorsing Reagan's presidency
by accepting the library complex. Kennedy said,
however, he doubted that would be the case. In a
written statement given to The Daily during yesterday's
senate meeting, Political Science Prof. |ohn Manley, a
vocal opponent of the proposed complex, said that he
was "saddened by the president's acceptance of the
Reagan library, museum and center for public affairs."
"When the full Stanford community is heard from,"
wrote Manley, "I hope Hoover's proposals will be
rejected as not in the best long-term interest of the Uni
versity."
Citing some of the 200 faculty letters included in the
Rosse report, Kennedy proposed three models for the
proposed policy center.
In the first model, the policy center would "stress an
enriched and coordinated curriculum for graduate and
undergraduate students." Such a center would allow
students to enhance their educations by introducing
public policy issues into the teaching curriculum.
A second model would organize, consolidate and ex
tend the University's existing policy-oriented pro
grams.
A third alternative would be a center that housed and
provided administrative support for conferences on
public affairs isbues sponsored by interested groups.
This approach would draw scholars from other institu
tions, according to Kennedy.
"In sum," Kennedy said, "I think there are many ex

citing possibilities for a public affairs center. But we are
now at a point where we must wait for a response from
the White House before we can go further."
Kennedy said that before the University can begin to
formulate a detailed proposal for the policy center, it
must "know which, if any, of these models the Presi
dent and his advisers would want as part of a presiden
tial library complex.
"If we receive word to go forward, I am certain that a
plan can be devised that will have widespread and en
thusiastic support," Kennedy said.

written statement given to The Daily during yesterday's
senate meeting, Political Science Prof. |ohn Manley, a
vocal opponent of the proposed complex, said that he
was "saddened by the president's acceptance of the
Reagan library, museum and center for public affairs."
"When the full Stanford community is heard from,"
wrote Manley, "I hope Hoover's proposals will be
rejected as not in the best long-term interest of the Uni
versity."
Citing some of the 200 faculty letters included in the
Rosse report, Kennedy proposed three models for the
proposed policy center.
In the first model, the policy center would "stress an
enriched and coordinated curriculum for graduate and
undergraduate students." Such a center would allow
students to enhance their educations by introducing
public policy issues into the teaching curriculum.
A second model would organize, consolidate and ex
tend the University's existing policy-oriented pro
grams.
A third alternative would be a center that housed and
provided administrative support for conferences on
public affairs isbues sponsored by interested groups.
This approach would draw scholars from other institu
tions, according to Kennedy.
"In sum," Kennedy said, "I think there are many ex

citing possibilities for a public affairs center. But we are
now at a point where we must wait for a response from
the White House before we can go further."
Kennedy said that before the University can begin to
formulate a detailed proposal for the policy center, it
must "know which, if any, of these models the Presi
dent and his advisers would want as part of a presiden
tial library complex.
"If we receive word to go forward, I am certain that a
plan can be devised that will have widespread and en
thusiastic support," Kennedy said.
