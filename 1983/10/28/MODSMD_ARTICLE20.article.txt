# Avant finally gets his turn
## 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
Although both Stanford
football starters Thomas Hen
ley and Kevin Scott have been
injure I, the team's running
game has improved dramati
cally ' the last two weeks due
to the play of Shaun Avant.
The junior back finally got a
chance to prove his running
ability in last Saturday's game
against / rizona. As a result, he
had his best day as a Cardinal
with 80 yards in 15 carries for
an average of 5.3 yards per
carry.
Avant was also very produc
tive as the team's kickoff
return man with a total of 93
yards on four carries.
It is surprising that when
Stanford's two starting backs
were out, Stanford had its best
day yet. But it was no surprise
to Avant.
"I've got confidence in my
abilities," Avant said, "And
I've been waiting for this op
portunity for a long time." Un

fortunately for Avant, the
coaches felt Henley and Scott
had more potential as fresh
men. Although he is a junior,
he has been playing behind
the other two.
"It was frustrating at first,"
Avant said, "because I feel I
play just as well or better than
they do but I gu 3 s everyone
else has the same feeling
when they watch somebody
start ahead of them."
Before the Arizona game,
Avant waited game after game
for his opportunity "I've been
here two years, ar J I was ex
pecting to play a whole lot this
year. Since Darrin Nelson and
Vince White graduated I felt it
was my turn," Avant said.
His desire to finally start
became a reality as he came
into spring training as the No.
1 back. "I did everything I was
capable of doing," Avant said.
"They (the coaches) figured
that we (Avant, Scott and Hen
ley) were equal. And since we

were equal, they decided not
to start me. The others were
younger so they had four
years to develop whereas I
had only two."
With the two freshmen
injured (Scott redshirted last
year), Avant still did not get his
chance to start. Only when
Stan Gill was hurt did Avant
get his chance to gain his long
awaited recognition.
"Usually when I first get
into the game, I'm really con
servative. I don't try to do \oo
much," Avant explains.
"Saturday, everything was
going right before I got into
the game. On the first play
they gave me some room so I
took it." The modest Avant
gives more credit to his block
ers than he does to his run
ning ability.
But his running ability can
not be ignored. On the first
play of the drive, Avant took
the room his blockers gave to
