# Kilters travel to Berkeley

### JOHN LIS 
Stanford women's field hockey Coach Onnie
Killefer left no doubt as to the importance of
tomorrow's match at UC-Berkeley. "This is sin
gularly the most important game of the sea
son," she said. "The outcome of the game will
definitely affect the outcome of the final
rankings."
Killefer was referring to this week's NCAA
Field Hockey Poll, which ranked the Cardinal
No. 13 in the country, down from No. 11 last
week, while placing the Bears at No. 11. Only
12 teams will qualify for the NCAA tournament,
which begins Nov. 11.
This game is, then, more than just the tradi
tional Stanford-Cal rivalry. A Stanford win
would most likely vault the Cardinal into the
top 12, while a loss would all but end Stanford's
tournament hopes.
The game will begin tomorrow at 11 a.m.,

and will be played on Cat's field. Killefer point
ed out a double benefit for the Bears. "They
will have an advantage not only on their home
field, but on the astroturf as well, " she said.
Stanford practices and plays on natural grass.
The Cardinal, 9-7-1 this season, has played
Cal three times this year, winning once while
losing twice. Stanford lost, 2-1, Sept. 24 at the
Long Beach Invitational, but came back that
week to hand the Bears a 3-1 loss Sept. 28 on
the Farm. Last Sunday, Cal beat the Card in the
final game of the California Invitational, 2-1.
Should Stanford win tomorrow, it would
seem the only obstacle between the Cardinal
and a tournament berth would be a Long Beach
State team that Stanford has already defeated
once this year. The Cardinal will face Long
Beach next Wednesday on the Farm in the final
regular season game. The game had originally
been scheduled for today.
