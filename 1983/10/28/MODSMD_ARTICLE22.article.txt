# Spikers meet UCLA tonight
## 
### TOM MOORE 
Coming off a convincing up
set of No. 2 ranked University
of the Pacific Tuesday night,
the Stanford women's volley
ball team faces a similar chal
lenge tonight when it takes
the Maples Pavilion floor
against its toughest WCAA
rival. The No. 4 ranked UCLA
Bruins, owners of a 27-3 over
all mark and a 7-1 league slate,
are just one match behind the
Cardinal in the conference
race.
"This is a real big match for
us," said Cardinal assistant
coach Don Shaw. "UCLA
could seriously be the best
team we've seen all year."
The Bruins are led by two
outstanding outside hitters
who rank first arid third in
conference hitting

percentage. Senior All-
America candidate Patty
Orozco has played
phenomenally since coming
back from knee problems and
leads the Bruins in kills with
132 in eight conference
matches. Sophomore Lisa
Masakayan provides a balance
to the UCLA attack. She's re
corded 129 kills in eight con
tests.
"They're two of the best
outside hitters around," Shaw
said, "and the Bruin lineup is
as good as anybody else's."
Stanford will try to counter
the Bruin attack with the same
aggressive defensive play that
has produced results all year.
"We'll try to be even more dis
ciplined in our blocking,"
Shaw explained. "UCLA
moves the ball around well so

we need to play good position
defense."
Offensively, the Cardinal
will continue to rely on a
deceptive passing game that
utilizes the hitting abilities of
all six players. Shaw attributes
the team's success to its team
work and unselfish play on the
court. He also praises the
home fans for their support.
"The crowd and the band
made all the difference in the
world (Tuesday night)," he
said. "They really pumped us
up for the match."
Stanford will try to extend
its unbeaten streak to 15
tonight at 7:30 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion. The Cardinal then
travels to UC-Berkeley Satur
day night for a non
conference contest against the
Bears. That match also begins
at 7:30 p.m.
