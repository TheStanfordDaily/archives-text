### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
The Stanford men's soccer team, which
recently has had problems scoring, will certain
ly have its work cut out against the No. 8
ranked UC-Berkeley Bears today at 3 p.m. on
Harry Maloney Field.
The Cardinal, 10-3-2 overall, is ranked sixth in
the Pacific Soccer Conference while the 16-2
Bears are rated first in the PSC.
Not only does Cal as a team lead in the PSC
rankings, but two of its players lead the league
in scoring and defense.
Cal's Mike Nieto, with seven goals and nine
assists, has a league-leading point total of 23.
Henry Foulk, Cal's goal keeper, has allowed
only nine goals all season and has eight
shutouts to his credit.
"Only in one game has a team scored more
than one goal against Foulk," Cal's Sports In
formation Director Kevin Reneau said, "And
that was against Santa Clara who we beat 3-2."
"He's a great goalie," Stanford Coach Nel
son Lodge admits, but adds that it is not im
posible to score on Foulk.
"We'll play to his weakness," Lodge said yes
terday, "which is going down on the ball. Since
he gets everything in the air, we're practicing
our low shots in practice today."
Cal's All-Conference player, Ron Hansen,
will provide another sturdy link in the Bear's
defensive chain. Hansen will lead Cat's hard
tackling defense in the open field.
Although Cal does have an aggressive team,

Stanford will not be intimidated.
"We knov\ it will be a physical game," Lodge
said. "We will be prepared."
Stanford players call Cal's type of game
hack and run." Yet they will counter the at
tack. "I am putting some real fighters into our
lineup," Lodge said. "I'd hate to be the referee
in this game."
Under all that physical style of play, there is a
tremendous amount of skill on Cal's part of
which Stanford must be especially careful.
In order to keep the game close, Stanford
will have to play defensively. "We're going to
five fullbacks and we might mark up their num
ber one scorer (Mike Nieto)," Lodge noted.
Playing with five fullbacks, Stanford has been
shutting down opponents effectively. But
marking Nieto will not stop the potent Bear of
fense. The brothers Deleray (Mark and Mike)
have combined for 15 goals and five assists for a
total of 35 points.
Of course, Stanford is still playing to win and
will not sit back and let Cal control the field.
"We won't wait for them to go to us," Lodge
said. "We will attack their backs with full
force."
A Cal victory would put the Bears in excellent
position to win the conference.
Though Cal is heavily favored today,
"Stanford is capable of beating any team in the
league," said Fresno Pacific Coach Ben Norton
Wednesday after the Cardinal booters defeated
his team.
