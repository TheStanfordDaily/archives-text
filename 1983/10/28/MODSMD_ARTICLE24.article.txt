# Polo plays USC
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Things are getting back
to normal at DeCuerre Pool
these days, now that the
Stanford water polo team is
on a six-game unbeaten
skein and back in the thick
of a fight for an NCAA
playoff berth.
"We're really close to
playing what I call good
water polo," said Head
Coach Dante Dettamanti
earlier this week. "We are
playing the best team
defense we've played all
season and becoming
knowledgeable about the
game."
In that case, the Cardinal
sure picked a darn good
time to figure out this game
because No. 5 USC (tied
with Stanford) and second
ranked Long Beach State
roll into Palo Alto this
weekend to begin the final,
and most important,
stretch of Stanford's
season.
Stanford is 11-7-3 on the
year and has six games
remaining â€” two with USC
and No. 1 UC-Berkeley and
a single contest with both
Long Beach State and No. 4
UCLA.
Note, that except for
Long Beach State, each is a

Pacitic-10 conference
game. The conference
standing will loom impor
tant in the NCAA commit
tee's selection process for
the eight-team nationals in
late November.
Right now, Cal and UCLA
share the Pac-10 lead with
2-1 marks while Stanford
and USC stand at 0-1. So
the Cardinal and Trojans
will be dead even in the
tournament race when they
square off at 3 p.m. this af
ternoon.
"USC is the team we
have to beat," explained
Dettamanti. "They are the
team we're fighting with for
a tournament spot. Any
other win is just frosting on
the cake."
To get by the Trojans,
Stanford will have to con
tain Mike Spicer, one of the
few collegian members of
the U.S. national team and
a "first-team All-America
candidate" in Dettamanti's
opinion.
"He's an excellent driver
and shooter," the Card
skipper continued, "and he
has a good supporting cast
of big, strong players."
The two clubs have yet to
face each other this year,
but Dettamanti guarantees
that "USC will come out
like gangbusters. That's
typical of 'SC."
In this and other respects
the Cardinal will battle a
similar opponent in Long
Beach State.
"Both teams play and
drive with a lot of inten
sity," according to Detta
manti, "and both are older
and experienced.
"But Long Beach State
tries to beat you with speed

and quickness.
The Forty-Niners present
another dilemma for the
Stanford defense because
they play a European style
of water polo that features
constant driving around the
hole and constant penetra
tion.
Fortunately, Stanford has
more than just the law of
averages in its corner for
the third go-round. Long
Beach State must play two
other tough road contests
against UOP and California
on Thursday and Friday.
