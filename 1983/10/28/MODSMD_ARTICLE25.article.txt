# Runners in WCAA meet
## 
### RICK BILODEAU 
During the next tew days Stanford's cross
country teams will compete in its conference
championships. The women will compete in
the WCAA title meet tomorrow at Tucson while
the men will host the Pacific-10 meet at the golf
course, Monday at 11 a.m.
Coach Brooks Johnson looks forward to
these meets as "the first measure of success in
the varsity season. A conference championship
stands well on its own, regardless of what hap
pens afterward."
As things stand now, the Stanford women are
easy favorites to defend the WCAA title they
captured in 1982, their first year in the confer
ence. The Card women will compete without
Ceci Hopp who is still recovering from a knee
injury. Also hampered by injuries, but still in
the competition will be PattiSue Plumer and
Michelle Mason. Despite these problems, Stan
ford still has a healthy Alison Wiley, Regina
Jacobs and Cory Schubert — all national-class
athletes — to insure a conference victory. Win

ning the NCAAs at less than full strength will,
however, be a more difficult task.
The men, coming off an impressive victory at
the Cal-Nike Invitational, are looking to surprise
some teams at this year's Pac-10 meet. Having
lost only one harrier to graduation, the team is
a year older and more mature. They have also
gained the services of freshman standout Marc
Oleson, who showed his potential by placing
I4th in the Cal-Nike meet. Only senior Jim
Smith linished better for the Cardinal.
In order to win, Stanford will have to
overcome a perennially strong Oregon team
led by last year's Pac-10 champ jim Hill; the
best Arizona squad in years, including six mem
bers of last year's team, which placed 11th in
the country; and a UCLA team that handily
defeated the Cardinal three weeks ago at the
Stanford Invitational. Coach Johnson is not
concerned with these formidable opponents,
however, stating "We have to worry about our
own team. If we maximize our own potential,
winning will take care of itself."
