### TRASK LEONARD 
Coming off a third place
finish in the Stanford Intercol
legiate Tournament last
weekend, the Cardinal men
golfers took fourth place in
the highly competetive Uni
versity of Pacific Fall Invita
tional Wednesday.
Senior Tim Robinson led the
way for the Cardinal, taking
second place in the individual
competition with rounds of
74-68-71 for a total of 218.
Robinson's outstanding per
formance was overshadowed,
however, by Duffy Waldorf of
UCLA, who posted a tourna
ment record 206 in capturing
medalist honors.
Waldorf's score contributed
to UCLA's team title with an
other record of 1074 strokes.
Grouped behind the Bruins

were Arizona State at 1100,
Arizona at 1102, Stanford at
1109 and San Jose State at
1110. Other team scores were
host UOP at 1118, Fresno State
at 1124, USC at 1125 and Cali
fornia at 1183. USC won the
Stanford Fall Intercollegiate
last weekend.
For the Cardinal, consistent
junior Scott Erickson shot 221,
while senior Doug Thompson
and sophomore Don
Walsworth checked in at 225
and 226, respectively. Sopho
more Carl Wagner (227) and
freshman Rich Marik (237)
rounded out the Stanford six.
"We had putting problems
all tournament," Stanford
Coach Tim Shaaf said, "or we
would have done better. I'm
proud of our guys anyway.

Though we haven't won a
tournament yet, with our high
finishes in the last two tourna
ments against very tough com
petition, I'd say that right now
we rank in the top two teams
on the West Coast, as well as
toward the top of the NCAA."
Robinson's second place
finish was his best since his
victory at the Morris Williams
Invitational against a tough
field as a freshman. "Tim and I
are pleased with his play so far
this year, and we hope it will
continue," Shaaf said. "He
has another year of eligibility
left, so we're expecting good
things."

season in two weeks at the
