## Santa Cruz: Diversity amid sand, sun and surf 
### LAUREN FREED 
There is something about
the coastal city ot Santa Cruz
that keeps pulling the visitor
back again and again once he
or she has had a taste ot the
life. For some, especially non-
Californians, the name Santa
Cruz conjures up an image ot
golden sand, sunny skies, sur
fers and the "laid back life
style of the state. The city
definitely has these things, but
it also offers a whole range ot
other charms.
Perfect escape distance
from campus, Santa Cruz lies
about an hour southwest of
Stanford. The drive alone is
worth the visit, especially this
time ol year. Taking Highway
280 south and then crossing
the mountains by way of High
way 17 offers the most direct
route and the most spectacu
lar scenery. At present the
drive really gives a taste ot fall;
there are tinges ol gold and a
few splashes of red on the
hills. The final sight of Santa
Cruz and the ocean in the dis
tance makes an exciting
climax.
Santa Cruz is near enough
to offer simply a day-long ex
cursion, but there is so much

to do and see in the area that
spending a night is well worth
the time. There are a number
oi nice lodging facilities both
in the city and in adjacent
communities. A good choice
is the Salt Air Motel (510
Leibrant A\e, Santa Cruz, (40ft)
423-6020), located just two
blocks from the Boardwalk
and beach. It is clean, com
fortable and offers rooms at a
price students can afford
(particularly now that it is the
off-season.)
A good way to start your stay
is to take a walking tour
through the heart of Santa
Cruz and see its old Victorian
homes, many of which date
trom the latter part of the I9th
century. In addition to these
there are some old adobe
homes such as the last remain
ing structure of the Santa Cruz
Mission. (Information about
these tours can be found at
the Convention and Visitors
Bureau at Church and Center
Streets.)
A visit to the mission site is a
must. Although the actual mis
sion no longer stands (it was
destroyed in a series of
earthquakes) the beautiful
structure of Holy Cross Catho

lic Church marks the site. Its
white tower dominates the
city and is the focal point upon
leaving Highway 17.
Santa Cruz is famous for its
Beach Boardwalk. It is Califor
nia's only remaining seaside
amusement park and has a
spectacular roller coaster, as
well as 20 other major rides. In
addition there are arcades, gift
shops and restaurants.
If vou are more interested in

the mountains than the
beaches, there are several
state parks to explore. Henry
Cowell Redwoods State Park
presents miles of nature trails
through the redwoods, al
though its restaurant and
souvenir shop are a negative
feature. Big Basin State Park
offers a little more isolation,
and the same superb sur
roundings.
Getting back to the city,

Santa Cruz holds an assort
ment of shops and res
taurants. Pacific Garden Mall,
which is about five blocks long
on Pacific Avenue in the
central district, is lined with
trees and has limited motor
traffic.
Wandering off the beaten
track, you can explore some
good vintage clothing stores
and antique shops. They have
some fun memorabilia from
the Victorian period of the city
among other items.
If this puts you in a historical
mood, you can follow it up by
visiting the Santa Cruz City
Museum. Located at 1305 E.
Cliff Drive, the museum hosts
permanent displays of local
history, natural history and
regional Indian lifestyle and
artifacts (the museum
specialty).
Santa Cruz boasts a number
of fine restaurants giving the
visitor a choice of foods and
atmospheres. Malio's and
Gilda's on the Municipal
Wharf are both good bets as
well as the Ideal Fish Company
in the same location (seafood
is a no-miss in this area.) If
Mexican food interests you,
try the Tampico Lounge or the

Alcapulco Restaurant, both
situated on the Pacific Garden
Mall.
Santa Cruz night life might
be something to explore after
a relaxing dinner. There are a
number of night spots featur
ing music and dancing. Some
good choices are O.T. Price's
Music Hall in Soquel which
specializes in rock rhythm and
blues; Dietrich's in Santa
Cruz, which offers pop-jazz;
the Albatross, also in Santa

Cruz, where you can find roc k
new wave; and Coconut
Grove, another Santa Cru/
spot particularly for big-band
tans.
In the case of Santa Cruz,
the old cliche is true: It has
something for everyone. For a
change of scenery and change
of lifestyle, a visit to Santa
Cruz is a perfect answer this
fall. All this plus sand, sun and
surfers too!
