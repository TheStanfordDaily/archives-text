# Students protest Grenada invasion
## 
### BRYCE LEE Staff writer 
More than 300 people gathered at
Jordan Hall last night to listen to
three Stanford professors express
their concern over the U.S. invasion
of Grenada.
The meeting, labeled a "teach-in
on Grenada," capsuled a day of
growing protest that included a
silent vigil at White Plaza and a
demonstration at the corner of El
Camino and Embarcadero. The
protests will continue tomorrow
with a march to Secretary of State
George Shultz's campus residence.
Sponsored by the Stanford
Central American Action Network
(SCAAN), last night's teach-in was
designed to make students more
aware of the situation in Grenada.
The speakers included Classics
Prof. Gregson Davis, Education Prof.
Martin Carnoy and History Prof. Bar
ton Bernstein.
Carnoy denounced the Reagan
administ r ation, saying the United
States has returned to "the pre-
Vietnam era of foreign policy with
out the are-Vietnam power."
"The Reagan administration can
not hardle being a world power that

is not omnipotent anymore," Car
noy said."And since we are no
longer omnipotent, we can only
deal with the 'little folks.'
"The bottom line ... ," Carnoy
continued, "Nothing has changed
since 1920 in the way we look at the
world."
The day of protest began in White
Plaza when a group of nearly 30 stu
dents held hands in a "circle of
silent vigil" amid placards protest
ing the invasion.
According to Dana Price, one of
the organizers of the protest, the
vigil took place "because lots of
people really wanted to do someth
ing and express their concern over
the situation in Grenada."
"The whole world scene upsets
me," Price said. "Our government
is using military force instead of
negotiating, which is the much
more difficult approach."
During the afternoon demonstra
tion on El Camino, a group of faculty
members and students held up
signs stating "Stop Reagan's war ma
chine" and "Honk for peace."
"The demonstration here today is
to call attention to our march on Sat-


GRENADA PROTEST: Students protest the U.S. invasion of Grenada by
conducting a silent vigil in White Plaza, one of a series of such protests

urday when a letter denounc
ing the U.S. invasion of
Grenada will be presented to
Shultz," said Joanne Scott, a
SCAAN member and a teacher
of a SWOPSI course on
Central America.
"It is important for the
people who oppose the mili
tary intervention in Grenada

to speak out and question the
motives behind the invasion,"
Scott added.
Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall participated
in the protest because, he
said, he has "been opposing
U.S. imperialism for over 30
years."
Protests here were light in
comparison to UC-Berkeley
where an estimated 2000
people marched from Sproul
Plaza on the campus into the
Berkeley city center yesterday.
