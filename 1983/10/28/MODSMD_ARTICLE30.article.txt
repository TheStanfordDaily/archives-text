## Trevor's 'Fools of Fortune' lamed but graceful

"Fools of Fortune," by William
Trevor, Viking, 239 pp., $13.95.
■Criticizing fiction requires either
an unquestioning acceptance of
one's own unexamined reactions,
or a morbid scrupulousness
demanding an explanation and jus
tification of how a novel affected
one. A critic of the latter sort may be
embarrassed when faced with a
| hook as inexplicably excellent as
§ William Trevor's "Fools of Fortune."
Bv rights its plot should hobble it
like a badly set broken leg. But the
characters and writing have such a
tranquilizing effect that it takes a
disagreeable effort to
lee the flaw and condemn it.
I The novel is set in Ireland, and its
principal action takes place in the
lears following 1918. The central
larrator, Willie Quinton, describes
lis childhood and youth in a
household of Protestant gentry.
Both his mother, an Englishwoman,
fend his father support the Irish
rationalists, but it is by mere acci
pent that an informant to the British
■orces is murdered on their prop
erty, provoking an atrocious reprisal
by the Black and Tans, in which
[most of the family is killed. Willie
kind his shattered mother move to
Cork, where he continues his
schooling and she collapses into al
coholism. During a visit from his En
glish relatives, Willie falls in love
with his cousin Marianne, but does
not declare himself. His romantic

obsession occupies the narrative
until Willie's part in the storytelling
is interrupted by his mother's sud
den suicide.
Willie's narrative makes up the
first half of the novel, and is its finest
part. With an economy untainted by
stinginess, Trevor depicts the pas
toral idyll to which the novel is al
ways looking back. The author's un
canny sense of detail might usually
serve a dense, objective realism. But
throughout "Fools of Fortune" his
lyrical descriptions shine with the
radiance of vision. Trevor will occa
sionally alternate dreamlike
memories with flat impressions of
the present so unobtrusively that
what could be a display of technical
virtuosity is discreetly subordinated
to bringing the reader into Willie's
mind.
The flaws in the novel's plot arise
only as Willie's section ends, so its
perfection is unspoiled. But just as
the suicide of Willie's mother seems
inadequately motivated, so do many
of the actions narrated by Marianne,
the cousin with whom Willie is in
love, and whose story carries almost
to the novel's end. She and her moth
er come from England for the fu
neral, and during their brief stay she
becomes pregnant by Willie. When
she discovers this and returns to
Ireland, Willie has mysteriously
gone away.

She remains to have his child and
wait for him, and here the plot dis
solves. Up to this point the amount
of narrative proportionate to events
described is constant and sufficient,

With an economy
untainted by stingi
ness, Trevor depicts
the pastoral idyll to
which the novel is
always looking back.

but Marianne ends up waiting 50
years before Willie finally returns.
Nothing much happens in all that
time, except the sifting of a lot of
tender memories by the remaining
characters, who live forlornly in the
past. Since the little that does occur
is mysterious and inadequately
motivated, the strong impressions
from Willie's narrative are indispen
sable to keep the book alive. And by
some authorial miracle, they do so
very well. Despite the structural
problems, "Fools of Fortune"
retains the reader's interest all the
way through. The charm of the first
section captures the reader as well
as the characters, and one really
does not want the novel to treat the
people in it as active adults. They are

much more appealing as observing
children.
The sense of tranquility with
which the book leaves one is, in a
way, as much an effect of manipula
tion as the worst kind of romantic
tear-jerking. But the evocation is so
tender and subtle, and feels so ap
propriate, that I am ashamed to
analyze its mechanism and object to
the book's problems. The charac
ters' passivity seems so attractive
that one wants to adopt it oneself.
There are very few books which,
however satisfying their ending, can
fairly be excused for faults or omis
sions like those in "Fools of
Fortune." But then, there are very
few books as beautiful as this one.
