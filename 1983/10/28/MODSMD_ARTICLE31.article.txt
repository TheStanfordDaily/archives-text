# Donleavy's satyric Dublin romp
## 
### S. WHITT AKER 
"Leila," by J.P. Donleavy,
Delacorte Press, 380 pp.,
$17.90.
A racy" book. Sounds like
a condemnation? I'm not sure.
Dropped on me to review,
the initial plunge provoked a
startled "I'm not sure I want to
admit to having read this
book."
Quickly followed by, "And
worse, to reveal that I en|oyed
it. (What will my professors
think?)"
On demolishing my previ
ous prudery, the book moved
forward to reveal how it really
feels to have a phallic
dominated sexualty. Excited?
Buy it and hide it from Granny.
This novel explores the life
of Darcy, the Irish gentleman
(with traces of America). His
ludicrous exploits involve the
mad Irish contingent of

Dublin societ\ and wickedly
tunny gallivantings of servants
and guests at his remote,
dilapidated Irish estate.
To illustrate Donleavy's
style, here's my reaction to
the book as he would write it:
"Asked m\self difference
between erotk and porno and
this. Thought stopped by
more mirth. On reading next
line, glasses took leap from
nose.
"One muffles the spasms of
gurgling. Not what one would
like neighbors to hear.
"Might think one was enjoy
ing oneself. Sarah of Stanford
thought of study. Downed
hook. Lett delights of Dublin
promiscuity. 2 a.m. and hard
to be a grad student."
The triple-lavered pronoun
system imitated above is used
by Donleavy to create a witty
varietv of viewpoints:

I he I persona of Darcy is
devoid of socially required
masks, t h o inner, strip p e d
hare character, revealing
through dreams, tantasy and
actuality his preoccupation
with the activity ot his penis
from urination to ejaculation,
involving the monstrously tun
ny influence ot various wo
men, religion, society and
family.
Subtle mudslinging at
gentry, the Hunt, gambling,
high society, pseudo-artsy
parties and gentlemen's clubs
appears when Darcy is pre
sented as "one".
I he third-person narrative,
using the Darcy Dancer per
sona, shows our hero mock
ing himself for his upper-class
facade with its inherent valua
tion ot sexual liberty, drink,
wealth and good living
The repeated references to
a variety of sexual activities is
mostly subtle, wittv and deli

ciously lewd, but the big fault
ot this novel occurs when this
theme is treated in excess. It
becomes boringly obscene.
The book's value lies in the
clear depiction of the over
powering drive i»i thi' phallus,
a clearly constructed insight
into what it is like to be male.
As such, it cannot be dis
missed with puritan piudery
for being worthlessly erotic, as
it takes great skill to reveal
such insights into male
sexuality.
With the exception of Leila,
Darcy's "Beatrice" figure, the
women are all portrayed as
equally rapacious. It is the
startling contrast to the rest of
the novel that makes Darcy's
touching, tender and pure
love of Leila so effective. She
appears as an incarnation of
what is lacking in our ob
sessive, excessive society by a
masterly juxtaposition of
pathos and bathos.
