Carrie (1976)
Kresge Auditorium
The film in which Brian
De Pdlma found his style:
Gothic satirical. Carrie is
a Catholic fairy tale in
which Cinderella —
repressed, friendless
Carrie — is punished for
going to the ball (the
prom) by having a bucket
of blood dropped on her;
instead of a fairy godmot
her she has telekinetic
powers that can destroy
her enemies. This outre
blend of satanic and mes
sianic elements contains
astonishing twists on
other (mostly horror)
movies. A gleeful, infec
tious scare picture, with
unforgettable perfor
mances by Sissy Spacek as
Carrie and Piper Laurie as
her evangelist mother.
The mostly young, fresh
cast also includes John
Travolta, Nancy Allen,
William Katt and Amy Ir
ving.
Plays tomorrow eve
ning with Demon Seed.
The Return of the Pink
Panther (1975)
Kresge Auditorium
So much of this movie
rehashes the earlier In
spector Clouseau pictures
that Blake Edwards might
have brought it out as an
afterthought. Very little in
it is actually funny except
for the way Peter Sellers
looks from scene to scene,
and two-thirds of the way
through the film Edwards
runs out of even second
hand gags and starts
repeating bits we've just
seen. He and Frank
Waldman wrote the
script, and the bland sup
porting cast is headed by a
tired-looking Christopher
Plummer, Catherine
Schell and Herbert Lom.
Plays tonight.

An American Werewolf
in London (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
John Landis' movies are
so cheerfully adolescent
that one can't take them
seriously. He lacks the in
ventiveness and the tech
nique to transform his
sophomoric jokes into
comic fantasy, but his
buoyant silliness
energizes his pictures, and
he doesn't trash his ac
tors. The two young stars
of this comedy-thriller,
David Naughton and Grif
fin Dupne, have pleasing
screen presence and an
easy rapport; their giddi
ness on screen suggests
partying rather than ac
ting. (They've caught the
true John Landis spirit.)
An American Werewolf in
London is a series of gags,

some of them moronic, a
number of them clever,
none of them inspired.
The best idea in the movie
is sustained the longest:
The two heroes are nice
(ewish boys from Long Is
land whose friendly
banter continues even
after the werewolf attack
that turns one of them
into the next werewolf
generation and the other
into the undead. Unfor
tunately, the picture is a
spoof of a genre of movies
that Landis either doesn't
understand especially
well or doesn't feel com
fortable with; whenever
' he has to focus on the hor
ror film plot, he loses his
style.
Plays Sunday evening.

Demon Seed (1977)
Kresge Auditorium
Julie Christie makes so
few movies that her ap
pearance in this
expensive-looking and
entirely fatuous science
fiction film is an infuriat
ing waste of her time and
talent. The director is
Donald Cammell, who
collaborated with Nicolas
Roeg on Performance;
judging from this film and
the far more intriguing
ones Roeg has made by
himself, Cammell must
have had the upper hand
on Performance. Christie
plays the wife of a semi
mad scientist (Fritz
Weaver) whose computer
impregnates her — it's a
perversion of the Nativity
story, though it's puz
zlingly solemn. (Demon
Seed isn't really an appro

priate title, but I guess the
filmmakers couldn't call it
Computer Seed.) Script by
Robert Jaffe and Robert
O. Hirson; Gerrit Graham
shows up in a supporting
role.
Plays tomorrow eve
ning with Carrie.
Pride and Prejudice
(1940)
Festival, Palo Alto
M-G-M did rather bet
ter by Jane Austen's comic
masterpiece than it did by
most of the authors it pur
ported to serve between
1933 and 1940, when it
put out its canon of
"prestige" pictures
adapted from classic En
glish novels. Liberties are
% taken, and the flavor isn't
as close to Austen as one
would like, but the
screenplay (by Aldous
Huxley and Jane Murfin)
is witty, and there are
some marvelous perfor
mances. Laurence Olivier
is a dream Darcy; Greer
Garson, who had not yet
traded in her freshness for
the wearying stoicism of
Mrs. Miniver and the
many insufferable
pictures that followed, is
Elizabeth; Edna May
Oliver (Aunt Catherine),
Mary Boland (Mrs. Ben
net), Melville Cooper (Mr.
Collins), Edmund Gwenn
(Mr. Bennet) and
Maureen O'Sullivan
(jane), at her prettiest and
most ingenuously charm
ing, highlight the large
supporting cast. The first
rate cinematography is by
Karl Freund.
Plays through Wednes
day with The Pickwick
Papers.

Plays through Wednes

Papers.

Carrie (1976)
Kresge Auditorium
The film in which Brian
De Pdlma found his style:
Gothic satirical. Carrie is
a Catholic fairy tale in
which Cinderella —
repressed, friendless
Carrie — is punished for
going to the ball (the
prom) by having a bucket
of blood dropped on her;
instead of a fairy godmot
her she has telekinetic
powers that can destroy
her enemies. This outre
blend of satanic and mes
sianic elements contains
astonishing twists on
other (mostly horror)
movies. A gleeful, infec
tious scare picture, with
unforgettable perfor
mances by Sissy Spacek as
Carrie and Piper Laurie as
her evangelist mother.
The mostly young, fresh
cast also includes John
Travolta, Nancy Allen,
William Katt and Amy Ir
ving.
Plays tomorrow eve
ning with Demon Seed.
The Return of the Pink
Panther (1975)
Kresge Auditorium
So much of this movie
rehashes the earlier In
spector Clouseau pictures
that Blake Edwards might
have brought it out as an
afterthought. Very little in
it is actually funny except
for the way Peter Sellers
looks from scene to scene,
and two-thirds of the way
through the film Edwards
runs out of even second
hand gags and starts
repeating bits we've just
seen. He and Frank
Waldman wrote the
script, and the bland sup
porting cast is headed by a
tired-looking Christopher
Plummer, Catherine
Schell and Herbert Lom.
Plays tonight.

An American Werewolf
in London (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
John Landis' movies are
so cheerfully adolescent
that one can't take them
seriously. He lacks the in
ventiveness and the tech
nique to transform his
sophomoric jokes into
comic fantasy, but his
buoyant silliness
energizes his pictures, and
he doesn't trash his ac
tors. The two young stars
of this comedy-thriller,
David Naughton and Grif
fin Dupne, have pleasing
screen presence and an
easy rapport; their giddi
ness on screen suggests
partying rather than ac
ting. (They've caught the
true John Landis spirit.)
An American Werewolf in
London is a series of gags,

some of them moronic, a
number of them clever,
none of them inspired.
The best idea in the movie
is sustained the longest:
The two heroes are nice
(ewish boys from Long Is
land whose friendly
banter continues even
after the werewolf attack
that turns one of them
into the next werewolf
generation and the other
into the undead. Unfor
tunately, the picture is a
spoof of a genre of movies
that Landis either doesn't
understand especially
well or doesn't feel com
fortable with; whenever
' he has to focus on the hor
ror film plot, he loses his
style.
Plays Sunday evening.

Demon Seed (1977)
Kresge Auditorium
Julie Christie makes so
few movies that her ap
pearance in this
expensive-looking and
entirely fatuous science
fiction film is an infuriat
ing waste of her time and
talent. The director is
Donald Cammell, who
collaborated with Nicolas
Roeg on Performance;
judging from this film and
the far more intriguing
ones Roeg has made by
himself, Cammell must
have had the upper hand
on Performance. Christie
plays the wife of a semi
mad scientist (Fritz
Weaver) whose computer
impregnates her — it's a
perversion of the Nativity
story, though it's puz
zlingly solemn. (Demon
Seed isn't really an appro

priate title, but I guess the
filmmakers couldn't call it
Computer Seed.) Script by
Robert Jaffe and Robert
O. Hirson; Gerrit Graham
shows up in a supporting
role.
Plays tomorrow eve
ning with Carrie.
Pride and Prejudice
(1940)
Festival, Palo Alto
M-G-M did rather bet
ter by Jane Austen's comic
masterpiece than it did by
most of the authors it pur
ported to serve between
1933 and 1940, when it
put out its canon of
"prestige" pictures
adapted from classic En
glish novels. Liberties are
% taken, and the flavor isn't
as close to Austen as one
would like, but the
screenplay (by Aldous
Huxley and Jane Murfin)
is witty, and there are
some marvelous perfor
mances. Laurence Olivier
is a dream Darcy; Greer
Garson, who had not yet
traded in her freshness for
the wearying stoicism of
Mrs. Miniver and the
many insufferable
pictures that followed, is
Elizabeth; Edna May
Oliver (Aunt Catherine),
Mary Boland (Mrs. Ben
net), Melville Cooper (Mr.
Collins), Edmund Gwenn
(Mr. Bennet) and
Maureen O'Sullivan
(jane), at her prettiest and
most ingenuously charm
ing, highlight the large
supporting cast. The first
rate cinematography is by
Karl Freund.
