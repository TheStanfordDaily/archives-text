## 
### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
While to some "recognition"
me.ns having everyone say hello at
the post office on Monday mor
nirgs, this particular Monday it
meant much more to the 24 women
of Alpha Kappa Alpha as the group
became the newest officially
recognized sorority on campus.
In order to join the other four
recognized sororities here, Alpha
Kappa Alpha went through 10
months of petition-signing and
negotiating with the national chap
ter and Row Director Diana Conklin,
all toward securing a letter of
autonomy, the key to University

recognition of fraternities and
sororities.
This autonomy, according to Con
klin, "is in harmony with the way
the University views students and
has always viewed students.
"They must show that the local
group of Stanford students has total
independence in membership se
lection and group governance," she
explained.
According to Alpha Kappa Alpha
President Tami Fountain, the
recognition has considerable impor
tance.
"Practically, it means that we'll be
able to use University facilities for
parties and meetings and rush par

ties. Emotionally, it means we don't
have to feel guilty about trying to
sneak around on campus. It's en
couraging to be the first recognized
black sorority at Stanford," she said.
In 1944, sororities were banned
from the University, partly because
of "the influence that people
outside the University had on Stan
ford students and Stanford stu
dents' access to certain houses and
certain groups," Conklin said.
The Board of Trustees amended
the ban on sororities "with the cru
cial catch that groups be totally au
tonomous" in 1977, Conklin said.
Alpha Kappa Alpha is the fifth
sorority to fulfill the Board's re
quirement and gain recognition.
