Reagan defends Grenada invasion
Washington — President Reagan, speaking to the
nation after a week of foreign-policy crises, last
night defended the U.S. invasion of Grenada and
the continuing deployment of U.S. Marines in
Lebanon as a response to what he called Soviet en
couragement of violence in both countries.
If the United States had not acted in Grenada or if
the Marines were withdrawn from Lebanon, Reagan
suggested strongly in his televised speech, the So
viet Union and its "surrogates" would become the
dominant force in those areas.
Speaking in emotional terms about the deaths of
221 Marines in last Sunday's suicide terrorist bom-

bing in Beirut, Reagan said, "They gave their lives in
defense of our national security every bit as much as
any man who ever died in fighting a war. We must
not strip every ounce of meaning and purpose from
their courageous sacrifice."
But Reagan offered no new initiatives to achieve a
peaceful settlement in Lebanon, and gave no indica
tion of how long the Marines would remain there.
Nor did he say anything about when U.S. forces
would be pulled out of Grenada.
In contrast to many of his past denunciations of
the Soviet Union, Reagan's tone and choice of
words were deliberately muted last night. But he
made clear his view that the Soviets were at the root
of what he contended was the necessity of the U.S.
presence both in the Middle East and the eastern
Caribbean island of Grenada.
The events in Lebanon and Grenada, though
oceans apart, are closely related,'' the president
said. "Not only has Moscow assisted and encour
aged the violence in both countries, but it provides
direct support through a network of surrogates and
terrorists.
"If terrorism and intimidation succeed, it will be a
devastating blow to the peace process and to Israel's
search for genuine security," Reagan said in refer
ence to Lebanon. "It won't just be Lebanon sen
tenced to a future of chaos. Can the United States or
the free world, for that matter, stand by and see the
Middle East incorporated into the Soviet Bloc?"
The president turned to a similar emotional
touchstone in defending his decision to invade
Grenada, which he said was necessary in part to
prevent the taking of American hostages.
Panel votes to invoke War Powers
Washington — The House Foreign Affairs Com
mittee, with some members protesting that there
was inadequate notification by the Reagan adminis
tration of the plan to invade Grenada, voted over
whelmingly yesterday to give Congress a say on
whether U.S. troops should be allowed to stay there
longer than 60 days.
Under the resolution, which sets the provisions of
the War Powers Act in motion, the president will
have to withdraw U.S. troops from the Caribbean
nation within that time, unless Congress allows
them to remain.
The full House is expected to consider the resolu
tion, which passed the committee 32-2, within the
next few days. In the Senate, Sen. Gary Hart (D-
Colo.) planned to offer a similar resolution as an
amendment to a pending bill that would raise the
government's debt ceiling.
The only negative votes in the House committee
came from congressmen who had wanted to
strengthen the resolution or to add language
denouncing the invasion. Rep. George Crockett jr.
(D-Mich.) voted against the measure after an unsuc
cessful attempt to attach an amendment calling for
forces to be withdrawn no later than Nov. 24. Rep.
Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) opposed it after he failed to per
suade committee members to insert language that
described the invasion as a violation of international
and U.S. law.
Marines crush resistance
St. George's, Grenada — American forces crushed
a final stronghold of Grenada's defenders yesterday,
but the Caribbean Island's diehard Marxist leader
was reported still resisting the invaders and holding
a woman hostage.
The United States poured hundreds of fresh
paratroopers into the fight for the tiny nation yester

day. President Reagan said a fully equipped Cuban
base was found and that the operation thwarted a
planned Cuban takeover of the island.
Artillery fire could still be heard at the Point
Salines airport last night. The shelling was to head
off a possible counterattack, Marines told 12
reporters flown to the island.
Six hundred Cuban soldiers and 200 Cuban civil
ian prisoners were being held at a hill overlooking
the airport, the reporters were told.
During a stay of several hours, reporters were
taken to five warehouses full of crated arms that
Ackers said were from Cuba and the Soviet Union —
"enough arms there to arm guerillas around the
world for years," Ackers said. He said Grenada had
served as a 'dropping off point" for arms Cuba ap
parently was shipping to Africa. Some weapons had
Soviet markings.
Beirut death toll rises to 221
Beirut, Lebanon — Pro-government Lebanese car
rying U.S. and French flags rallied yesterday to show
support for the multinational force in Lebanon. The
Marine commander said new security measures had
been enforced to prevent a repeat of the suicide
bombings that killed more than 270 Americans and
French soldiers.
The death toll from the attacks at the French and
U.S. bases continued to rise: 221 U.S. servicemen
were killed, according to the Pentagon, and 56
French soldiers died, according to French military
officials in Beirut.
The search for missing bodies, including two
Frenchmen presumed dead, went on at both camps.
Marines formed long lines at their base at Beirut's
International Airport to telephone assurances to
relatives in the United States. Up to 50 Marines at a
time lined up to use two international telephone cir
cuits to the United States.
Sgt. David Lawson, 23, said he was waiting to call
his mother, Shirley Lenartowiz, in Philadelphia, and
tell her "I'm still kicking and alive and I'll be home
soon."
Marine spokesman Maj. Robert Jordan said about
750 calls had been placed by midday. He said the
phone lines would be kept open until every Marine
and Navy man on the base at the time of the blast
had a chance to place a call.
Stock prices decline
New York — Stock prices declined yesterday in
selling ascribed to fresh doubts about interest-rate
prospects.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
1.73 to 1242.07 by the end of trading.
Losers held a 9-5 lead over gainers among New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today. Highs from the 60s to the low
80s. Lows in the mid 50s.
