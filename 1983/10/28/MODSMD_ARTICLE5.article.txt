Reagan defends Grenada invasion
Washington â€” President Reagan, speaking to the
nation after a week of foreign-policy crises, last
night defended the U.S. invasion of Grenada and
the continuing deployment of U.S. Marines in
Lebanon as a response to what he called Soviet en
couragement of violence in both countries.
If the United States had not acted in Grenada or if
the Marines were withdrawn from Lebanon, Reagan
suggested strongly in his televised speech, the So
viet Union and its "surrogates" would become the
dominant force in those areas.
Speaking in emotional terms about the deaths of
221 Marines in last Sunday's suicide terrorist bom-

bing in Beirut, Reagan said, "They gave their lives in
defense of our national security every bit as much as
any man who ever died in fighting a war. We must
not strip every ounce of meaning and purpose from
their courageous sacrifice."
But Reagan offered no new initiatives to achieve a
peaceful settlement in Lebanon, and gave no indica
tion of how long the Marines would remain there.
Nor did he say anything about when U.S. forces
would be pulled out of Grenada.
In contrast to many of his past denunciations of
the Soviet Union, Reagan's tone and choice of
words were deliberately muted last night. But he
made clear his view that the Soviets were at the root
of what he contended was the necessity of the U.S.
presence both in the Middle East and the eastern
Caribbean island of Grenada.
