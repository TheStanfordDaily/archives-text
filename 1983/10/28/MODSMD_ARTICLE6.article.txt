# Americans' presence exacerbates the conflict in Lebanon, scholar says

### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The deaths of more than 200
Americans in the bombing of the
American compound in Beirut Sun
day will deepen U.S. involvement in
Lebanon's protracted civil war, Asst.
History Prof. Joel Beinin said in a
speech here yesterday.
Beinin said the attack on the com
pound will result in even stronger
U.S. support of the government of
Amin Gemayel and is only the
logical conclusion" to the U.S. go
vernment's continued support of
Gemayel's Phalangist party.
Speaking to about 100 people at
the Bechtel International Center,
Beinin said that rather than keeping
the peace, the U.S. forces in
Lebanon are actually intensifying
sectarian conflict because the
United States is supporting
Gemayel's Maronite Christian go
vernment over the country's Mos
lem and Druse groups.
"The apparent role of the U.S.
Marines in Lebanon is not to keep
the peace, but to support the Pha
langists. All of those groups who
oppose Phalangist control oppose
us," Beinin said.
He said the Reagan administration
has sided U.S. forces with the
Gemayel government because of
the assumptions "that all the prob
lems in the world are caused by the
Soviets and that military force is the

solution for all these problems. Both
of these assumptions are incorrect."
The Phalangists and the Moslem
and Druse groups will never com
promise to form a democratic, non
sectarian government until the
United States, Syria and Israel
withdraw their forces, Beinin said.

"If the foreign forces on which
each faction relied for support
withdrew, the factions would be
forced to confront the reality of the
country. Otherwise, they will never
have to talk, " Beinin explained.
The root cause of Lebanon's in
stability is the political formula used
to divide power between Christians,

Sunni Moslems and Shi'ite Mos
lems, Beinin said.
The arrangement requires a
Maronite Christian president, a Sun
ni Moslem prime minister and a
Shiite Moslem speaker of the parlia
ment.
Beinin said the Phalangists have
resisted repeated attempts to make
the government representative of
the country's Moslem majority.
But a democratic system would
force the Phalangists to give up the
power they have in government,
which is disproportionate to the
number of Maronite Christians in
Lebanon, he said.
The Phalangists' unwillingness to
give up power has further divided
the Lebanese society into factions,
Beinin said.
The United States' credibility was
seriously eroded among Moslem
Arabs after last year's invasion of
Lebanon by Israel, Beinin said. The
Reagan administration "gave the
green light" to the invasion, but ad
ministration officials were surprised
by the invasion's ferocity, he said.
The United States' role as a
peacemaker was destroyed when it
fought with the Gemayel govern
ment against Druse forces for con
trol of Souk el Gharb, a strategic
town overlooking Beirut, he said.
