# Steve Vineberg's list of
## The 						10 scariest movies I've ever seen 
### 
We all make lists. Shopping lists, homework
lists, class lists, even lists of lovers. Today the Dai
ly presents the first in a new occasional Friday
feature. We'll present a different kind of list here;
noted University community members will be
asked to submit their own lists with their ideas of
the 10 best, the 10 worst, the 10 most important -
that sort of thing. Daily movie critic Steve
Vineberg begins on a frightening Halloween
weekend note with the 10 scariest movies he's
ever seen.
Truly frightening movies, like the most
evocative ghost stories we heard as kids, never
quite desert our imagination. And so when it was
suggested that, in the spirit of Halloween, I sub
mit my list of the 10 scariest movies I've ever
seen, I found I could pluck them off the top of my
head, even though I hadn't seen most of them tor
years. Here they are (in alphabetical order):
Cape Fear (1962): A Hollywood hack, J. Lee
Thompson, made this movie, proving that you
don't have to be a fine technician to make an au
thentic shocker. Gregory Peck plays a lawyer who
finds his safety and that of his family imperilled
when a vengeful ex-con shows up; Robert
Mitchum plays the threat, so there's no doubt in
our minds that Peck is justified in fearing the
worst. Aside from Mitchum's performance, this
movie has no merit whatsoever beyond its ef
fectiveness as a thriller; it's even morally ques

tionable. But I saw it 13 years ago and I've never
forgotten it.
Carrie (1976): It you were to read a synopsis of
the plot of this giddy Gothic (or, presumably, the
Stephen King novel on which it was based), you
might wonder how a director could transcend its
unholy mixture of stock and schlock elements.
But the director is Brian De Palma, and the movie
is both terrifying and terribly funny. Sissy Spacek
gives a startling performance as the naive, timid
girl who takes telekinetic revenge on all her ad
versaries, and Piper Laurie does a variation on the
wicked stepmother motif (this is, after all, a Cin
derella story) that finishes it off for good.
Dead of Night (1945): An architect (Mervyn
Johns) awakens from a dreadful recurring
nightmare and sets out for the country house of
one of his clients. As he nears it, he begins to
sense the presence of something horribly
familiar: The house, the host and all the other
visitors are details in his dream. The
screenwriters, John Baines and Angus McPhail,
use this pretty effective idea as a canvas to hang
five short stories on, as each of the other guests
relates the tale of his own brush with the super
natural. Alberto Cavalcanti directed the best seg
ment in this British anthology film — it features
Michael Redgrave in a brilliant performance as a
mad ventriloquist. (This episode was the unoffi
cial source for the novel and the movie Magic.)
Diabolique (1955): This is Henri-Georges
Clouzot's chilling anatomy of a conspiracy to

murder a sadistic, tyrannical headmaster (Paul
Meurisse). The conspirators are his wife (Vera
Clouzot) and his mistress (Simone Signoret). This
film is creepily effective, but I'm not sure I'd ex
actly recommend it to anyone — it isn't a very
pleasant experience.
Freaks (1932): Tod Robbins' story "Spurs" pro
vided the material for this celebrated Tod Brown
ing film, which came out of a fertile period for
horror movies: the early sound era in Hollywood.
A preface assures us that the movie rose out of a
sympathy for those who must seek their living as
circus freaks, but when the characters crawl into
the nighttime rain at the end to take their revenge
on a woman who has cuckolded one of them,
we're too frightened to respond with compassion
to their plight. The movie doesn't succeed as a
human document, but it's a hell of a horror film.
Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956): The first
time I saw this cheaply made sci-fi picture about
extra-terrestrials that grow from pods into the
images of the earthlings who (unwittingly) house
them, I was so shaken that I kept checking the
face of the friend who had taken me for alien
signs. Don Siegel's classic could be another
xenophobic Cold War film, or it could be a
protest against the mindless conformity of the
'50s that condoned the Cold War mentality. But
even if it weren't such a fascinating relic of its
epoch, it would still be a terrific scare picture.





laws (1975): Steven Spiel
berg's movie may be more fun
than any other horror film;
when it's over, you don't
know whetheryou spent more
time screaming or laughing —
like the best roller coaster ride
of your life. Made with appeal
ing sophomoric humor (the
script is by Peter Benchley,
who wrote the book, and Carl
Gottlieb, who went on to
make Caveman), and a love of
film technique — and what
marvelous, perverse things a
director can do with it. The
memorable shark fighters are
Roy Scheider, Richard
Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw.
The Night of the Hunter
(1955): James Agee wrote the
I unorthodox, poetic

screenplay (out of a Davis
Grubb novel), and Charles
Laughton directed — for the
first and last time, since the
movie was a financial disaster.
Yet this terrifying movie,
structured as a fairy tale (a pair
of children escape from their
wicked stepfather, Robert
Mitchum, to a benevolent
godmother figure, played by
Lillian Gish), is probably the
best American film of its de
cade. Much of the credit for
the heavy, German Expres
sionist atmosphere must go to
the cinematographer, Stanley
Cortez, but it is Robert
Mitchum's performance,
more than anything else in the
film, that qualifies it for inclu
sion in this list.
Psycho (1960): I doubt that
any movie lover would leave
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho off
a list of this kind, especially if
he first saw it (as I did) in high

school. No, I don't think this
movie is one of the great
works of art of our century,
and no, I don't hold with the
auteur critics' evaluation of
Hitchcock as one of the
world's greatest filmmakers.
But Psycho is undeniably dett
ly assembled, powerfully sug
gestive and unforgettable.
With Anthony Perkins, of
course, in the role that made
him famous.
Vampyr (1932): One of the
greatest exercises in the hor
ror genre came from the
Danish director Carl Dreyer.
It's all imagery — the story is
hardly coherent at all, and the
actors, except perhaps for
Sybille Schmitz, are
presences. But what imagery!
When you walk away after
wards, you may feel the aura
of death following you for a
few blocks. Shot by the
prodigious Rudolph Mate.


WHODUNIT: The suspense builds in a scene from the classic thriller Dead of Night.

Meurisse). The conspirators are his wife (Vera
Clouzot) and his mistress (Simone Signoret). This
film is creepily effective, but I'm not sure I'd ex

pleasant experience.
Freaks (1932): Tod Robbins' story "Spurs" pro
vided the material for this celebrated Tod Brown
ing film, which came out of a fertile period for
horror movies: the early sound era in Hollywood.
A preface assures us that the movie rose out of a
sympathy for those who must seek their living as
circus freaks, but when the characters crawl into
the nighttime rain at the end to take their revenge
on a woman who has cuckolded one of them,
we're too frightened to respond with compassion
to their plight. The movie doesn't succeed as a
human document, but it's a hell of a horror film.
Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956): The first
time I saw this cheaply made sci-fi picture about
extra-terrestrials that grow from pods into the
images of the earthlings who (unwittingly) house
them, I was so shaken that I kept checking the
face of the friend who had taken me for alien
signs. Don Siegel's classic could be another
xenophobic Cold War film, or it could be a
protest against the mindless conformity of the
'50s that condoned the Cold War mentality. But
even if it weren't such a fascinating relic of its
epoch, it would still be a terrific scare picture.

berg's movie may be more fun
than any other horror film;
when it's over, you don't
know whetheryou spent more
time screaming or laughing —
like the best roller coaster ride
of your life. Made with appeal
ing sophomoric humor (the
script is by Peter Benchley,
who wrote the book, and Carl

make Caveman), and a love of
film technique — and what
marvelous, perverse things a
director can do with it. The

Roy Scheider, Richard

The Night of the Hunter
(1955): James Agee wrote the

Yet this terrifying movie,
structured as a fairy tale (a pair
of children escape from their
wicked stepfather, Robert
Mitchum, to a benevolent
godmother figure, played by
Lillian Gish), is probably the
best American film of its de
cade. Much of the credit for
the heavy, German Expres
sionist atmosphere must go to
the cinematographer, Stanley

Mitchum's performance,
more than anything else in the
film, that qualifies it for inclu

Psycho (1960): I doubt that
any movie lover would leave
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho off
a list of this kind, especially if
he first saw it (as I did) in high

school. No, I don't think this
movie is one of the great
works of art of our century,
and no, I don't hold with the
auteur critics' evaluation of
Hitchcock as one of the
world's greatest filmmakers.
But Psycho is undeniably dett

With Anthony Perkins, of
course, in the role that made
him famous.
Vampyr (1932): One of the
greatest exercises in the hor

Danish director Carl Dreyer.
It's all imagery — the story is
hardly coherent at all, and the

Sybille Schmitz, are
presences. But what imagery!

We all make lists. Shopping lists, homework
lists, class lists, even lists of lovers. Today the Dai
ly presents the first in a new occasional Friday
feature. We'll present a different kind of list here;
noted University community members will be
asked to submit their own lists with their ideas of
the 10 best, the 10 worst, the 10 most important -
that sort of thing. Daily movie critic Steve
Vineberg begins on a frightening Halloween
weekend note with the 10 scariest movies he's
ever seen.
Truly frightening movies, like the most
evocative ghost stories we heard as kids, never
quite desert our imagination. And so when it was
suggested that, in the spirit of Halloween, I sub
mit my list of the 10 scariest movies I've ever
seen, I found I could pluck them off the top of my
head, even though I hadn't seen most of them tor
years. Here they are (in alphabetical order):
Cape Fear (1962): A Hollywood hack, J. Lee
Thompson, made this movie, proving that you
don't have to be a fine technician to make an au
thentic shocker. Gregory Peck plays a lawyer who
finds his safety and that of his family imperilled
when a vengeful ex-con shows up; Robert
Mitchum plays the threat, so there's no doubt in
our minds that Peck is justified in fearing the
worst. Aside from Mitchum's performance, this
movie has no merit whatsoever beyond its ef
fectiveness as a thriller; it's even morally ques

tionable. But I saw it 13 years ago and I've never
forgotten it.
Carrie (1976): It you were to read a synopsis of
the plot of this giddy Gothic (or, presumably, the
Stephen King novel on which it was based), you
might wonder how a director could transcend its
unholy mixture of stock and schlock elements.
But the director is Brian De Palma, and the movie
is both terrifying and terribly funny. Sissy Spacek
gives a startling performance as the naive, timid
girl who takes telekinetic revenge on all her ad
versaries, and Piper Laurie does a variation on the
wicked stepmother motif (this is, after all, a Cin
derella story) that finishes it off for good.
Dead of Night (1945): An architect (Mervyn
Johns) awakens from a dreadful recurring
nightmare and sets out for the country house of
one of his clients. As he nears it, he begins to
sense the presence of something horribly
familiar: The house, the host and all the other
visitors are details in his dream. The
screenwriters, John Baines and Angus McPhail,
use this pretty effective idea as a canvas to hang
five short stories on, as each of the other guests
relates the tale of his own brush with the super
natural. Alberto Cavalcanti directed the best seg
ment in this British anthology film — it features
Michael Redgrave in a brilliant performance as a
mad ventriloquist. (This episode was the unoffi
