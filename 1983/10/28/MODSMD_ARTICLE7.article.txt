# Steve Vineberg's list of
## The
						10 scariest movies I've ever seen 
### 
We all make lists. Shopping lists, homework
lists, class lists, even lists of lovers. Today the Dai
ly presents the first in a new occasional Friday
feature. We'll present a different kind of list here;
noted University community members will be
asked to submit their own lists with their ideas of
the 10 best, the 10 worst, the 10 most important -
that sort of thing. Daily movie critic Steve
Vineberg begins on a frightening Halloween
weekend note with the 10 scariest movies he's
ever seen.
Truly frightening movies, like the most
evocative ghost stories we heard as kids, never
quite desert our imagination. And so when it was
suggested that, in the spirit of Halloween, I sub
mit my list of the 10 scariest movies I've ever
seen, I found I could pluck them off the top of my
head, even though I hadn't seen most of them tor
years. Here they are (in alphabetical order):
Cape Fear (1962): A Hollywood hack, J. Lee
Thompson, made this movie, proving that you
don't have to be a fine technician to make an au
thentic shocker. Gregory Peck plays a lawyer who
finds his safety and that of his family imperilled
when a vengeful ex-con shows up; Robert
Mitchum plays the threat, so there's no doubt in
our minds that Peck is justified in fearing the
worst. Aside from Mitchum's performance, this
movie has no merit whatsoever beyond its ef
fectiveness as a thriller; it's even morally ques

tionable. But I saw it 13 years ago and I've never
forgotten it.
Carrie (1976): It you were to read a synopsis of
the plot of this giddy Gothic (or, presumably, the
Stephen King novel on which it was based), you
might wonder how a director could transcend its
unholy mixture of stock and schlock elements.
But the director is Brian De Palma, and the movie
is both terrifying and terribly funny. Sissy Spacek
gives a startling performance as the naive, timid
girl who takes telekinetic revenge on all her ad
versaries, and Piper Laurie does a variation on the
wicked stepmother motif (this is, after all, a Cin
derella story) that finishes it off for good.
Dead of Night (1945): An architect (Mervyn
Johns) awakens from a dreadful recurring
nightmare and sets out for the country house of
one of his clients. As he nears it, he begins to
sense the presence of something horribly
familiar: The house, the host and all the other
visitors are details in his dream. The
screenwriters, John Baines and Angus McPhail,
use this pretty effective idea as a canvas to hang
five short stories on, as each of the other guests
relates the tale of his own brush with the super
natural. Alberto Cavalcanti directed the best seg
ment in this British anthology film — it features
Michael Redgrave in a brilliant performance as a
mad ventriloquist. (This episode was the unoffi
cial source for the novel and the movie Magic.)
Diabolique (1955): This is Henri-Georges
Clouzot's chilling anatomy of a conspiracy to

CLASSIC FRIGHT: Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) gets more than hot water and clean skin in the classic shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

murder a sadistic, tyrannical headmaster (Paul
Meurisse). The conspirators are his wife (Vera
Clouzot) and his mistress (Simone Signoret). This
film is creepily effective, but I'm not sure I'd ex
actly recommend it to anyone — it isn't a very
pleasant experience.
Freaks (1932): Tod Robbins' story "Spurs" pro
vided the material for this celebrated Tod Brown
ing film, which came out of a fertile period for
horror movies: the early sound era in Hollywood.
A preface assures us that the movie rose out of a
sympathy for those who must seek their living as
circus freaks, but when the characters crawl into
the nighttime rain at the end to take their revenge
on a woman who has cuckolded one of them,
we're too frightened to respond with compassion
to their plight. The movie doesn't succeed as a
human document, but it's a hell of a horror film.
Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956): The first
time I saw this cheaply made sci-fi picture about
extra-terrestrials that grow from pods into the
images of the earthlings who (unwittingly) house
them, I was so shaken that I kept checking the
face of the friend who had taken me for alien
signs. Don Siegel's classic could be another
xenophobic Cold War film, or it could be a
protest against the mindless conformity of the
'50s that condoned the Cold War mentality. But
even if it weren't such a fascinating relic of its
epoch, it would still be a terrific scare picture.
