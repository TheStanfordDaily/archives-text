# Athletic Department $500,000 in red

### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
I[ The Department of Athletics lost
fc507,000 in the last fiscal year and
[aces another large deficit this year,
according to Athletic Director Andy
Alan Cummings, associate athletic
director, said that while last fiscal
year's deficit was covered by bor
rowing against a trust fund held by
the Athletic Department, "We're
in not exactly sure how we're going to
make up for the deficit."
The 1982-83 shortfall was caused

by a $200,000 operating deficit and a
$300,000 gap between money
needed for women's athletic
scholarships and money raised,
Geiger said.
Since the start of this fiscal year,
which began Sept. 1, the football
program, which produces much of
the department's income, has lost
$400,000. Half of the loss stems from
reduced gate receipts and the other
half is a result of the University's in
ability to obtain television coverage
for any football games.
Geiger said football revenues

were expected to provide $4 million
of the the department's total
income of $10 million but may total
as low as $3.5 million.
The team's performance so far has
led to speculation about the fate of
Paul Wiggin, head football coach,
who is in the fourth year of a five
year contract.
Geiger refused to comment on
Wiggin's status, and denied reports
cited in last Thursday's The Mercury
News that he has approached two
other coaches, Jack Bicknell of Bos
ton College and Watson Brown of

the University of Cincinnati, pos
sibly in search of Wiggin's replace
ment.
Brown, reached for comment at
his office in Cincinnati, denied
mefting anyone from Stanford.
Bicknell also said he has not talked
to anyone here about replacing Wig
gin.
In order to combat the deficit,
Geiger suggested that the depart
ment might utilize another trust or
"other sources" which he did not
specify.
He added that some trimming had

occurred in the Athletic Depart
ment, including a move to not fill
vacant departmental positions. Al
though Geiger noted that this has
not posed any immediate difficulties
"yet," he said he would be unable
to replace an associate athletic
director were one to leave.
To solve future budgetary prob
lems, Geiger said he would like to
change some of the department's
fund-raising operations by raising
money for the department, and not
solely for scholarships.

The Buck Club for men and the
Cardinal Club for women raised
about $4.5 million last year, accor
ding to Geiger, and the Buck Club
recorded a $560,000 surplus.
However, the Athletic Depart
ment was unable to use these funds
to cover its deficit because only
$43,000 of the money raised could
be spent at the department's discre
tion, as most of the money was
restricted to scholarships in men's
athletic programs.
Buck Club Director John Laird
said his organization was studying
ways to raise money for the Athletic
Department, most likely outside of
the club, which has by-laws restrict
ing it to raising money only for
men's athletic scholarships.
Geiger also noted other structural
problems in the Athletic Depart
ment's budget. For instance, the de
partment began a women's athletic
program without significant new
funding sources.

Part of last year's deficit was
caused by money used for scholar
ships for female athletes because
the Cardinal Club was unable to
raise enough money for scholar
ships.
"It's been very difficult for us to
operate at a profit for a long, long
time," said Geiger.
Both Geiger and Cummings said
the deficits will not affect the athlet
ic program. "We're not cutting
back" this year, said Cummings,
"we're just trying to spend each dol
lar as wisely as possible."
