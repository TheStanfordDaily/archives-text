## The
						Stanford Daily Scared out of our fatigues 
### 
Last week was scary.
This week is getting off to a downright
frightening start.
A vast array of ghouls and alien beings have
passed through campus in recent days:
skeletons and wraiths, pirates and villains,
civilians in Marine fatigues, Fidel Castro
preaching Marxism around the Mausoleum, a
John Anderson look-alike dancing around the
Stanfords' last resting place, black cats crossine
paths at every turn of a bike. Halloween i
upon us.
You could see it in the night trees set against
the backdrop of the first fall storm which ble .
in last weekend. Their leaves on the ground
and their gnarled branches reaching for 'he
clouds crowding the moonless sky — the black
oaks became one-dimensional spectres out of
a nightmare. Scary.
It takes you back to the days when your older
brother told you that a ghoul lived in the storm
drain. You believed him. In college, you
thought that you were too old to believe that
kind of stuff. But now you're not so sure. It's as
true as anything seems to be these days.
There seems to be a little bit of Halloween in

everything lately — all the masks and unmask
ings. A rescue mission in the Caribbean turns
into a "routing out" that officials predict may
take weeks. A man all took for the national se
curity adviser becomes the secretary of the in
terior. A presidential library turns into a politi
a! Disneyland. A terrorist in Beirut brings
more tricks than treats to the American
peacekeeping forces there.
Sycamore leaves crunch under the weight of
your duck shoes as you walk to your last mid
term. The pungent smell of carved pumpkins
hangs in the air. Thanksgiving and finals and
the holidays are just around the corner. Then
winter. The storms. Spring. Summer intern
ships. Another Halloween. Another year.
Graduation. Very scary.
Kids will be trick-or-treating in the faculty
ghetto tonight — Luke Skywalkers, Smurfs,
football players, skeletons, ghouls, villains
and maybe even a few little Marines in battle
fatigues. They probably believe in storm drain
ghouls. But they're probably not scared.
The terror of Halloween is all around us. Hal
loween is monsters in the storm drain. It's mys
tery, the supernatural, the unexpected. It's life.
