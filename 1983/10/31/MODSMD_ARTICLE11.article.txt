## What Reaganomics means 
### 
I had a strange moment of politi
cal epiphany recently, while watch
ing the C-Span cable broadcast of a
live House debate. A Republican
congressman was screaming bloody
murder about federal budget
deficits. And who was he blaming?
Why, his Democratic colleagues
across the aisle, of course, for their
"profligate, free-spending' policies
on social welfare programs. All very
typical for a Republican congress
man, one would think. Except:
Wait a mintute. What in the world is
he talking about?

If there is one political verity which has
been quite effectively blown up in the last
few years, it is that strange and laughable
notion that Reagan is a fiscal conservative/
He is ar» enthusiastic free spender. He just
has different spending priorities from the
liberals - namely, defense instead of social
welfare.

By some bizarre process of
double think, he has blinded him
self to the real cause of the federal
megadeficits—which will total
more than $200 billion in fiscal 1983,
and more than that for the next five
years. And who is to blame for the
megadeficits, in this day and time
when it is so frustratingly difficult to
assign blame for all the things that
are going wrong with the country?
The answer is obvious; it is plain
as day; it is crystal clear — and it is
perhaps too much for some Repub
lican congressmen to face while re
taining their sanity —it is, of
course, President Reagan.
Everyone can agree on one fact
about deficits: They are caused by
too much spending and too little
revenue. As for the revenue side of
the ledger, we all know who slashed
income taxes by 25 percent over the
past two years. It sure wasn't the
"free spending, liberal Democrats."
Now, tax cuts may be a very pleasant
and desirable thing, but if one is
unwilling or unable to cut spending
accordingly (and Reagan was both)
even a 3-year-old could tell you
what's going to happen.
Of course, Reagan claimed that
his tax cuts would generate an im
mediate economic boom of such
magnitude that revenues (even with
the lower tax rate) would rise
enough to balance the budget.

Well, how bluntly can it be put? He
was wrong.
On the spending side of the
ledger we reach the real irony of
that Republican congressman's ac
cusations. For if there is one politi
cal verity which has been quite ef
fectively blown up in the last few
years, it is that strange and
laughable notion that Reagan is a
"fiscal conservative." In fact, he is
an enthusiastic free spender. He just
has different spending priorities
from the liberals — namely, defense
instead of social welfare.

Now, the objective necessarily (if
any) of Reagan's massive military
buildup is irrelevent to the point I
am trying to make. That point is that
Reagan, while he was busily cutting
taxes, was unwilling to cut spending
because he was planning and carry
ing out all along a veritable binge of
military spending. If that spending
was necessary for national security
reasons, he should have confessed
honestly that hp was not a fiscal con
servative, that in fact, spending was
going to have f o go up a ">t deal
in his administration (as it has), and
that therefore tax cuts were not in
order. If he really believed in his
defense programs he should have
called honestly for tax increases.
Added to this frank unwillingness
to cut spending is the predictable
fact that Reagan has been unable to
make major cuts in social spending.
Oh, he and Congress managed to
hold the line a bit on increases in so
cial spending, but everyone knows
that this kind of spending is periodi
cally immune from any serious cuts.
So, that's who got us into this
mess, and how. The question is how
to get out. The obvious answer, of
course, is to raise taxes. Everyone
knows that government spending is
never going to be cut enough (in
fact, probably shouldn't be cut
enough) to erase $200 billion
megadeficits. The only question is:
Do we pay honestly for the govern
ment with more taxes, or do we per

sist in our illusions?
Unfortunately, asking politicians
to raise taxes (especially in an elec
tion year) is like asking kinder
gartners to volunteer for vaccina
tions: "I'm not going to do it, you
do it!" Reagan is probably mentally
incapable of conceiving of the mag
nitude of his folly in cutting taxes so
drastically. Republicans aren't about
to lead a charge for tax increases.
And why should Democrats, tradi
tionally the more responsible party,
want to do it? Why should they open
themselves up for Republican pot
shots all through the campaign?
One Democrat with the uncom
mon courage to call for a tax in
crease is presidential candidate John
Glenn. Glenn's problem is that he
may be too honest to get elected.
just as Thomas Jefferson said "a
little revolution now and then is a
good thing," so it can be said that a
littfe deficit now and then is a good
jolt for the economy, so long as the
money supply is expanded enough
to accommodate government bor
rowing and keep interest rates down
(which Reagan's Federal Reserve has
not done.) But we're talking about
megadeficits that will double the
trillion-dollar national debt in five
years — and we're already shelling
out 12 percent of all federal expen
ditures a year just to pay interest on
that debt. We're talking about
deficits that should make even a
free-spending liberal cry. And these
deficits weren't created by any free
spending liberal! They were created
by the crackpot economic mis
management and tax cuts of true
blue conservative Ronald Wilson
Reagan
As we enter the 19«4 campaign
season and start to hear Republican
politicians prating about the
recovery as an example of the
"success" of Reaganomics, let's just
keep in mind what Reaganomics has
really consisted of: tax cuts for the
rich which have destroyed the go
vernment's revenue base, uncon
trolled leaps in military spending
which Reagan refused to pay tor
honestly (by making the political
sacrifice of asking for higher taxes),
painstakingly high interest rates
which unnecessarily lengthened
and deepened a severe recession,
causing massive unemployment and
delaying the long-overdue recovery
for which he now takes credit, and
the pyrrhic success of massacring
the mosquito of inflation (a piddling
3 percent in 1982) with a sledgeham
mer of economic suffering.

(which Reagan's Federal Reserve has
not done.) But we're talking about
megadeficits that will double the
trillion-dollar national debt in five
years — and we're already shelling
out 12 percent of all federal expen
ditures a year just to pay interest on
that debt. We're talking about
deficits that should make even a
free-spending liberal cry. And these
deficits weren't created by any free
spending liberal! They were created
by the crackpot economic mis
management and tax cuts of true
blue conservative Ronald Wilson
Reagan
As we enter the 19«4 campaign
season and start to hear Republican
politicians prating about the
recovery as an example of the
"success" of Reaganomics, let's just
keep in mind what Reaganomics has
really consisted of: tax cuts for the
rich which have destroyed the go
vernment's revenue base, uncon
trolled leaps in military spending
which Reagan refused to pay tor
honestly (by making the political
sacrifice of asking for higher taxes),
painstakingly high interest rates
which unnecessarily lengthened
and deepened a severe recession,
causing massive unemployment and
delaying the long-overdue recovery
for which he now takes credit, and
the pyrrhic success of massacring
the mosquito of inflation (a piddling
3 percent in 1982) with a sledgeham
mer of economic suffering.

I had a strange moment of politi
cal epiphany recently, while watch
ing the C-Span cable broadcast of a
live House debate. A Republican
congressman was screaming bloody
murder about federal budget
deficits. And who was he blaming?
Why, his Democratic colleagues
across the aisle, of course, for their
"profligate, free-spending' policies
on social welfare programs. All very
typical for a Republican congress
man, one would think. Except:
Wait a mintute. What in the world is
he talking about?

If there is one political verity which has
been quite effectively blown up in the last
few years, it is that strange and laughable
notion that Reagan is a fiscal conservative/
He is ar» enthusiastic free spender. He just
has different spending priorities from the
liberals - namely, defense instead of social
welfare.

By some bizarre process of
double think, he has blinded him
self to the real cause of the federal
megadeficits—which will total
more than $200 billion in fiscal 1983,
and more than that for the next five
years. And who is to blame for the
megadeficits, in this day and time
when it is so frustratingly difficult to
assign blame for all the things that
are going wrong with the country?
The answer is obvious; it is plain
as day; it is crystal clear — and it is
perhaps too much for some Repub
lican congressmen to face while re
taining their sanity —it is, of
course, President Reagan.
Everyone can agree on one fact
about deficits: They are caused by
too much spending and too little
revenue. As for the revenue side of
the ledger, we all know who slashed
income taxes by 25 percent over the
past two years. It sure wasn't the
"free spending, liberal Democrats."
Now, tax cuts may be a very pleasant
and desirable thing, but if one is
unwilling or unable to cut spending
accordingly (and Reagan was both)
even a 3-year-old could tell you
what's going to happen.
Of course, Reagan claimed that
his tax cuts would generate an im
mediate economic boom of such
magnitude that revenues (even with
the lower tax rate) would rise
enough to balance the budget.

Well, how bluntly can it be put? He
was wrong.
On the spending side of the
ledger we reach the real irony of
that Republican congressman's ac
cusations. For if there is one politi
cal verity which has been quite ef
fectively blown up in the last few
years, it is that strange and
laughable notion that Reagan is a
"fiscal conservative." In fact, he is
an enthusiastic free spender. He just
has different spending priorities
from the liberals — namely, defense
instead of social welfare.

Now, the objective necessarily (if
any) of Reagan's massive military
buildup is irrelevent to the point I
am trying to make. That point is that
Reagan, while he was busily cutting
taxes, was unwilling to cut spending
because he was planning and carry
ing out all along a veritable binge of
military spending. If that spending
was necessary for national security
reasons, he should have confessed
honestly that hp was not a fiscal con
servative, that in fact, spending was
going to have f o go up a ">t deal
in his administration (as it has), and
that therefore tax cuts were not in
order. If he really believed in his
defense programs he should have
called honestly for tax increases.
Added to this frank unwillingness
to cut spending is the predictable
fact that Reagan has been unable to
make major cuts in social spending.
Oh, he and Congress managed to
hold the line a bit on increases in so
cial spending, but everyone knows
that this kind of spending is periodi
cally immune from any serious cuts.
So, that's who got us into this
mess, and how. The question is how
to get out. The obvious answer, of
course, is to raise taxes. Everyone
knows that government spending is
never going to be cut enough (in
fact, probably shouldn't be cut
enough) to erase $200 billion
megadeficits. The only question is:
Do we pay honestly for the govern
ment with more taxes, or do we per

sist in our illusions?
Unfortunately, asking politicians
to raise taxes (especially in an elec
tion year) is like asking kinder
gartners to volunteer for vaccina
tions: "I'm not going to do it, you
do it!" Reagan is probably mentally
incapable of conceiving of the mag
nitude of his folly in cutting taxes so
drastically. Republicans aren't about
to lead a charge for tax increases.
And why should Democrats, tradi
tionally the more responsible party,
want to do it? Why should they open
themselves up for Republican pot
shots all through the campaign?
One Democrat with the uncom
mon courage to call for a tax in
crease is presidential candidate John
Glenn. Glenn's problem is that he
may be too honest to get elected.
just as Thomas Jefferson said "a
little revolution now and then is a
good thing," so it can be said that a
littfe deficit now and then is a good
jolt for the economy, so long as the
money supply is expanded enough
to accommodate government bor
rowing and keep interest rates down
(which Reagan's Federal Reserve has
not done.) But we're talking about
