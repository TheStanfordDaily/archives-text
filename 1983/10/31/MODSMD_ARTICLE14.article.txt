# President's papers belong in capital
## 
### 
Since the Reagan library-museum
policy center complex seems to
have occupied The Daily daily, I
apologize for providing one more
opinion on the issue. In truth, the
debate seems cloaked in so many
disguibes it has been a bit difficult to
sort the crucial and more sub
stantive issues. I mean, has any
president made an academic contri
bution to any m. ; or university? Has
any presidential museum ever pro
vided great academic worth? Has
any presidential poli' center ever
ensured statesman 1 ip or leader
ship for future generations? What is
the real issue?
After all, the United States is a
democracy. Our heads of state are
elected officials. Ad as a
democracy, one would li*e to think
that it is people, and not the head of
state, that makes the nation great.
So where does that place the one
issue that si • rcedes nuclear dis
armament, the invasion of Grenada
and the massacre in Beirut in the
various campus newspapers?
Let us assume that the nation, in
general, values all presidential
papers. Indeed, the 1978 Presiden
tial Papers Act recognizes the value
of these papers. Furthermore, the
federal government maintains the
United States National Archives and
Records Service at taxpayers' ex
pense in full recognition of their
value. So let us agree that there is
value in all presidential papers.
Now the issue of librarie at aca
demic institutions. Perhaj > some
universities feel that some presi
dents are more academically in
clined thar others. Or, perhaps,
they would like to bestow the honor
on a favorite alurr-"'s.
Lyndon lohnson was a graduate of
Southwest Texas State Teacher's
College at San Marcos, lexas. His
presidential papers and library are at
the University of Texas.
Gerald Ford was a Yale University
law student. His undergraduate
alma mater, the University of Mic
higan, where he is remembered for
his football career, has his presiden
tial papers — not Yale.
John F. Kennedy graduated cum
laude from Harvard. His presidential
library is at the University of Massa
chusetts.
President Reagan received his
bachelor's degree from Eureka Col
lege in Illinois in 1932. Following a
successful screen acting career, he
switched to public service where he
has been equally successful. In 1962,
he switched from a liberal Democrat
to a conservative Republican. When
in California, he usually vacations in
the southlands. It seems his only

link to Stanford is his affiliation with
the Hoover Institution, where he is
an honorary fellow.
Now, if the issue is the high aca
demic value of presidential papers,
it is reasonable to expect that the na
tion's top universities should be
clamoring to be recipients. Harvard,
Yale, Princeton, University of Cali
fornia, University of Chicago —
where are your presidential libraries
and museums?
So what is the real issue? And why
the great debate? Does the presi
dent need an endorsement? >oes
Hoover want another tower?
Doesn't Stanford have enough ,rou
ble allocating sufficient park ig lhan
to be creating additional parking
problems for students and staff?
Aren't the National Archives enough
for right now?
In our democracy, elected offi
cials are public figures, not c'eities.
As such, I feel the presic .*nt i a I
papers and libraries should be as
public as possible.
And if museums become the
popular manner to commemorate
presidents, tax dollars can be set
aside to accommodate them all.
While we're at it, perhaps we should
include a special site away from Ar
lington for presidential tombs as
well. We could commemorate our
great leaders in a fashion similar to
that of the Egyptians.

In our democracy,
elected officials are
public figures, not
deities. As such. /
reel me presidential
papers and libraries
should be as public
as possible.

Future generations could cruise
along the Mississippi and visit one
shrine after another, one museum
after another. And should public
opinion grow to favor museums and
libraries for presidential wives,
there will be room for their
memorabilia as well without creat
ing any new parking problems.
Until then, the National Archives
located in Washington seems appro
priate for all presidents — regard
less of race, color, religion, creed or
affiliation with the right or left wing.
