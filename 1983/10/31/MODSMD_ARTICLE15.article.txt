Columnist tired of. . .
What is it going to take to con
vince many Americans, and if I may
single one out, Daily columnist
Michael Henry Olvera, that the
United States has for some time
now demonstrated its gunboat
diplomacy to these "little
countries" of Central America?
Since Olvera concentrates his views
on Central America, then I shall
discuss the policy of gunboat
diplomacy in Central America. And
since he's also tired of world
opinions, then I shall present him
with an American opinion.
Olvera says that these "little
countries" deserve the rights and
privileges of our more powerful
allies. One of these is the right of
self-determination. But how does
assess the view of the present
administration when a senior offi
cial at the State Department was
quoted by the Los Angeles Times
on Sept. 18, 1983: "The United
States must make sure that the
Sandinistas do not consolidate
power." The United States has no
right to undermine the privileges of
any nation, regardless of size.
Nevertheless, some may say that
this issue of rights and privileges is
insufficient to disclose the position
of the United States in Central
America. Just last week the Associ
ated Press reported that the San
d rirta government offered ap
point proposal aimed at easing
ti isions with the United States.
But the United States literally
ruled out the proposal and
desires little, if any diplomatic
relations with the San
dinista government. What solution
is h ' after a country refuses to
con promise? We are all too familiar
nov\ with the term gunboat
diplomacy and its implications. Any
president who calls rebels sup
ported by American dollars
"freedom fighters" is only thinking
in one manner: Military might is
right.

will not let Olvera's rhetoric con
vin e them that the United States
has its hands clean in this volatile
region, but rather that others will
weigh the daily reports out of
Central America and assess the
position of the United States fairly.

Michael Henry Olvera clearly has
a future in the Reagan government
if he wants to pursue a public life.
His column (Daily, Oct. !5) fits so
perfectly with the <t official
view of the world that one suspects
he's already been reading the State
Department cables. He begins his
pronouncements on where the
United States must stand in the
world by asserting, "I'm tired of
little countries," and then goes on
to complain at length about these
"podunk, paltry" places that dare
to criticize American policies. All
this on the very day that American
troops are storming that little island
country of Grenada. Olvera must
be elated to see that we're finally
noting the inconsequential "power
and size" of such places — and
acting accordingly.
Olvera worries that "while we sit,
Nicaraguan children are being
bombarded with anti-U.S.
propaganda," but the real problem
for these children is that "while we
sit" they're being bombarded with
U.S. bombs that come from ClA
funded contras.
But Olvera, smug in his imperial,
big-brother vision, can't be both
ered by what actually happens in
such small places or by what the
people there might think. No doubt
about it, he's on his way to the top,
ready to "guide" (or rule) the poor
misguided people of the world.
Meanwhile, the people in those
small "podunk" countries had
better look for cover.
