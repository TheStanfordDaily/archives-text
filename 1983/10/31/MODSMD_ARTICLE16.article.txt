# Professor's Commentary: William Lyell
## The 						route from Greenmeadow Way to campus 
### 
Prof. William Lyell is in his
nth year at Stanford. Most of
his courses are taught in
Chinese and are in the field of
modern Chinese language and
literature. He teaches two
courses in English: Asian Lan
guages 91 ("Traditional East
Asian Civilization" - team
taught with faculty members
from the History and Religious
Studies departments); and
Asian Languages 133 ("Modern
Chinese Literature in English

Translation.")
His wife's people are Jewish
immigrants from Lithuania and
Russia. Her maiden name was
Cranetz - from the German
'grentz' for border.
Lyell's mother came over
from Ireland when she was 18
years old. His father was from
Tennessee.
It is 4.2 miles from home
(224 Greenmeadow Way —
close to San Antonio Road just

off Alma Street) to my office.
Biking is often faster than
driving. I would never spend
$100 lor an 'A' parking permit,
and so, by the time I walk from
a 'C' lot to my office after
parking the car, it usually
takes longer than biking.
I think that too much expla
nation would spoil the poem.
Most of it is self-explanatory.
It's just that biking to school
gives you time to think about a
lot of things.

Bicycle Route to Campus
I have the route now:
Alma to Charleston,
left on Charleston to Park Boulevard,
right on Park and down to California,
zigzag around the Co-op,
and straight into campus.
And as I ride other routes come to mind:
from the cotton mills of Belfast,
across the Atlantic to New York,
a long left to Philadelphia and being an Irish maid,
another hard left to Rahway, New Jersey,
where she gives birth to me.
Alma to Charleston,
Charleston to Park,
down Park, zigzag around the Co-op,
and straight into campus.
I do it every day.

Fleeing a pogrom in Lithuania,
Right? Left? No one remembers now,
but somehow to New York,
a hard right to Lawrence, Massachusetts,
to mills, strikes, and delicatessens —
that's how my wife's people came.
Alma, Charleston, Park,
zigzag round the Co-op,
and into campus.
I do it every day.
From birth to school,
a hard right to work,
an easy left to warm lips and love,
another hard right to old age,
a zigzag around loneliness,
and straight into the grave —
a route known most anywhere,
a route you and I both share.
