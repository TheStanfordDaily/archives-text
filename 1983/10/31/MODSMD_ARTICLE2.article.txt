### HARA LEVY Staff writer 
Approximately 400 people
marched from White Plaza to Secre
tary of State George Shultz's
campus home Saturday afternoon to
protest the U.S. invasion of
Grenada.
Chanting, "One, two, three, four
— bring back the Marines and stop
the war," and "Reagan, Shultz, CIA

policy-makers with public opinion
concerning U.S. conduct in the in

member Carol Baume stressed that
"the letter is a symbolic effort."
On behalf of the ad hoc Coalition
Against U.S. Intervention in
Grenada, an organization consisting
of mid-Peninsula citizens and Uni

letter denounced the invasion as "a
shameful and disastrous foreign
policy decision" and demanded that
Reagan "immediately withdraw all
troops from Grenada and release all
Cuban prisoners on an uncondition-
