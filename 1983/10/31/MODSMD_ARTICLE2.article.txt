## 
### HARA LEVY Staff writer 
Approximately 400 people
marched from White Plaza to Secre
tary of State George Shultz's
campus home Saturday afternoon to
protest the U.S. invasion of
Grenada.
Chanting, "One, two, three, four
— bring back the Marines and stop
the war," and "Reagan, Shultz, CIA
— sending troops is not the way,"
protesters walked to Shultz's house
to present him with a letter, signed
by 13 Stanford and Bay Area organi
zations. In the letter, each group
cited reasons for opposing the
Grenada invasion.
Lisa Fuentes, a spokeswoman for
the Stanford Central American Ac
tion Network (SCAAN), one of the
groups that organized the protest,
said the demonstrators descended
on Shultz's home "to voice opposi
tion and show outrage to the direc
tion in which the Reagan administra
tion is taking this country.
"Let the people of the Third
World decide for themselves — stop
military aid and intervention."

Fuentes said the demonstration
was designed to increase conscious
ness and encourage people to take
constructive action against the ad
ministration's foreign policy. She
added, however, that the march "is
not enough" to thoroughly acquaint
policy-makers with public opinion
concerning U.S. conduct in the in
ternational community.
"People should write or call their
congressmen and express their op
position," Fuentes said. "Hopefully
this march is only the beginning."
Even though Shultz was not at
home to accept the letter, SCAAN
member Carol Baume stressed that
"the letter is a symbolic effort."
On behalf of the ad hoc Coalition
Against U.S. Intervention in
Grenada, an organization consisting
of mid-Peninsula citizens and Uni
versity community members, the
letter denounced the invasion as "a
shameful and disastrous foreign
policy decision" and demanded that
Reagan "immediately withdraw all
troops from Grenada and release all
Cuban prisoners on an uncondition-

The letter was concerned
wth not only the invasion of
Grenada, which the writers
said ' directly violates the
charter of the United Nations
. . . and, more importantly,
stands in blatant contradiction
with the democratic principles
on which the United States is
based, but also the prece

protest because she was
"worried that the president is

Another protester was
"outraged with the invasion of

are not good. We have no
