## Card nightmare isn't over yet Beavers win first Pac-10 game in 4 years 
### ADAM BERNS 
Corvallis, Ore. â€” The Stanford football
team looked like it was rehearsing for
Shakespeare's "A Comedy of Errors." But
even then, it didn't get its parts right.
In front of only 20,000 fans, Oregon
State got its first Pacific-10 victory in four
years, thoroughly trustrating Stanford en
route to a 31-18 victory. The victory
boosted the Beavers record to 2-6 while
Stanford dropped to last in the Pac-10
with an overall record of 1-7.
The loss was particularly disappointing
for Stanford coming off last week's upset
victory over then-No. 19 ranked Arizona.
While the Cardinal offense was able to
move the ball, it was not able to score
many points, four times having to settle
for field goals by place-kicker Mark Har
mon.
"I didn't think the offense played
anywhere near what we were capable
of," Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin said
after the game. "I'm not sure our team in
general played all that well, either. I still
think to some degree, we're a frustrated
football team."
Oregon State Coach Joe Avezzano
thought the key to the game was the pres
sure put on freshman quarterback John
Paye who was replaced in the fourth quar
ter by senior Steve Cottrell.
"Going into this game, we felt that
there were some key points," a smiling
Avezzano said. "We felt that we would
have to limit the big plays of the wide
receivers and we felt that we would have
to harass the quarterback."
Another thing that the Beavers did was
hold on to the ball, something they have
not done in previous games. Oregon
State did not lose a fumble and had just
one pass intercepted.
"We felt that if we protected the foot
ball better than we had done in the past
and played with enough enthusiasm, we
would win," Avezzano said. "By not tur
ning the ball over, we got ourselves in
volved in a normal kind of a football
game. Our offense did what it had to do
at the very crucial times."
If there were any bright spots in this

game for Stanford, it was the play of
freshman fullback Marshall Dillard who
played in his first collegiate game due to
injuries to Rob Moore and Kaulana Park.
After Moore left the game early due to a
knee sprain, Dillard came in to rush for 66
yards on 13 carries. He also caught three
passes for 50 yards.
But while Dillard was impressive, the
rest of the Stanford offense was not. Paye
completed just 15-of-29 passes for 125
yards in over three quarters of play and
while he was in, the Cardinal did not
score a touchdown. Cottrell figures were
more impressive, as he hit on 8-of-22
passes for 191 yards, but one of his passes
was intercepted by Beaver noseguard
John Gonzales for a touchdown.
Oregon State effectively mixed the run
and the pass to keep the Stanford defense
off balance all afternoon. Beaver quarter
back Ladd McKittrick also ran for crucial
first down yardage at key points during
the game, rushing for a total of 45 yards if
sacks are not included.
"Ladd, I thought, was a pretty heady
football player," Avezzano said.
"Overall, I thought, he led the football
team well."
Oregon State running back Bryce
Ogleby, who entered the contest first in
the conference in rushing, had another
fine day, rushing for 99 yards on 19
carries.
The Beavers got on the board first,
scoring on an 80-yard touchdown drive
with 6:34 remaining in the first quarter.
Oregon State running back James Terrell
capped the drive with a 7-yard run over
right tackle for the score.
Stanford immediately came right back
thanks to the leg of Harmon who booted
a 52-yard field goal which hit the crossbar
before bouncing over, closing the gap to
7-3.
On Oregon State's next series,
linebacker Mike Noble deflected a pass
which was intercepted by linebacker
Dave Wyman on the Beaver 25-yard line
and returned to the 15. Stanford,
however, could not move the ball, and

was forced to settle for another field goal.
In the second quarter the Beavers
added another touchdown when McKit
trick hit receiver Reggie Bynum in the
right corner of the end zone with a 19-
yard touchdown pass. Bynum was smo
thered by Cardinal cornerback Kevin Baird
and safety Charles Hutchings, but still
managed to hold on to the pass after ini
tially bobbling the ball.
After Beaver safety intercepted a Paye
pass on the following series, the Beavers
were faced with a fourth-and-two on the
Stanford 22. Avezzano opted to go for it
rather than attempting the sure field goal.
The decision could have left Avezzano
open for criticism if Stanford had won the
game, but the Cardinal never let it get
that close.
Stanford added three more points in
the third quarter, closing the gap to 14-12,
but Oregon State game back to blow the
game open in the fourth quarter, scoring
17 points while the Cardinal answered
with only six.
Harmon's fourth field goal came on
Stanford's first drive of the second half
and travelled 38 yards. As the fourth in
the game, the three-pointer tied an all
time Stanford record already shared by
Harmon and place kicker Rod Garcia.
Near the end of the quarter, Harmon
missed his chance of breaking the Stan
ford record when he missed on a 48-yard
field goal try.
The Beavers scored with just three
seconds elapsed in the fourth quarter
when running back Donald Beavers
swept over the left end for the score.
After one more Stanford series, Cottrell
replaced Paye. After an illegal procedure
penalty, Cottrell's first pass was picked
off by nose guard Gonzales for a touch
down as Cottrell was trying to set up a
screen to running back Shaun Avant.
With just more than eight minutes left
in the game, Harmon attempted another
field goal, this one 55 yards, and just
missed as the ball fell short.

Stanford place kicker Mark Harmon booted three field goals, including a 52-yarder, but it
wasn't nearly enough as the Cardinal was on the short end of a 31-18 score Saturday to
Oregon State, a team that suffered 30 straight Pacific-10 Conference defeats over the last
four years.
Stanford finally scored with
4:46 left in the game as Avant
ran the ball wide left for an 8-
yard touchdown run, but Cot
trell's pass on the two-point
conversion try fell short.
From the locker room
Stanford receiver Emile Har
ry, suffered a partially dis
located shoulder and a bruised
sternum in the closing
minutes of the game. While
the injuries are not serious,
they are painful, and it is not
certain whether Harry will be
able to play next week.
Stanford ended the game
with more first downs (20) and
total yards (428) than the
Beavers (20 first downs and
319 total yards) but the figure
is deceptive because much of
the yardage came in the fourth
quarter when the game was
already out of reach.
Oregon State fans who have
not been used to winning tore
down one of the stadium's
goal posts with two seconds
left on the clock, bringing a
delay- of-game penalty against
the Beavers. After the game,
students tore down the other
goal post.
In the locker room after the
victory, Avezzano gave a
speech of a different kind. In
stead of his usual postgame
speech about losing, Avez
zano had to calm down his
excited players to give a
speech about winning with
class.
