### RICK BILODEAU 
The Stanford women's cross
country team stated its post
season on tiie right foot, so
the speak, by handily winning
the VVCAA championships Sat
urday in Tucson.
Regin I irobs paced the
way for iinal, sprinting
past te<. imate Alison Wiley
vards the finish to take
line i. dual in 17:41
The team as a whole defeated
runner-up UCI A by a 26-point
(32-58) margin.
Lynn Nelson of Arizona
State took the early lead, fol
lowed closely by a pack of Car
dinals. Halfway through the
race Wiley and Jacobs passed
the Wildcat runner and
pushed home to the finish.
Following Nelson in third
were Stanford's Cory
Schubert and PattiSue Plumer
in fourth and fifth respective
ly. Michelle Mason <. I ->ed out
the Cardinal team score with a
20th place finish. Also running
for Stanford were Hillary Ellin
(33rd) and Angela Nervi (53rd).

For Jacobs, Saturday's per
formance was by far her best
this year, as she usually runs
third or fourth on the team.
However the potential has
been there, as shown by a fine
freshman track season which
featured a fourth place finish
in the N AA 800-meter final,
and he: irst cross country
season, last year, in which she
parned All-America honors,
placing 27th in the Nl \As.
Conspicuously absent from
the race was 19' ' WCAA
champion Ceci Hopp, who
was held out of the competi
tion due to a hip injury. Coach
Brooks Johnson hopes to keep
her sidelined for the District
meet on Nov. 12 as well
to protect her from further in
jury so she can compete in the
NCAA meet on Nov. 19 in
Lehigh, Pennsylvania.
Today the men's team will
attempt to follow the women's
example with a good showing
in the Pac -10 champion .hips at
the Stanford Golf Course. The
race is scheduled for an 11
a.m. start.
