The Stanford men's soccer team stunned No. 8 ranked
UC-Berkeley Friday with a 3-0 victory in a very physical
game.
"Whenever Cal plays Stanford the play is going to be
rough," said Cardinal fullback Phil Horvath. "The rivalry
extends beyond football."
With the win, Stanford improved its record to 11-3-2
overall and 3-1-1 in the Pacific Soccer Conference. Cal fell
to 16-3 and 4-1. The Card stayed alive in the running for a
berth in the NCAA post-season tournament, but must win
all its last games to assure such a bid.
In the early going, it appeared the Bears — ranked No. 1
in the Far West — would live up to their high ranking and
beat the Card. Cal used skilled passing to maneuver down
field, but Cardinal goalie Willie Burkhardt, who recorded
his fourth shutout of the season, made save after save.
Stanford took a 1 -0 lead at the 24 minute mark in the first
half on the first of two Jorge Titinger goals. "I was open on
the right side and Todd (Rafalovich) made a perfect
cross," Titinger said. "I headed the ball but the goalie
deflected it. The ball came right back to me and i headed it
past him."
Cal appeared to have tied the game later in the half, but
an offsides call negated the goal. The disallowed Cal score
seemed to be a turning point in the contest, as it stripped
the Bears of any momentum they might have had.
As the second half progressed, Stanford began to
assume more dominance as Cardinal Coach Nelson
Lodge's strategy in the game started to work. "Our strat
egy was to spread the defense (of Cal) out and let our
strikers work one-on-one against their fullbacks," Lodge
explained.
The Card booters used this strategy to raise the score to
2-0 on Walter Kingson's goal at the 70-minute mark. Gian
carlo Ferruzzi took a pass from Mike Mossner, who passed
to a wide-open Kingson for the score.
"I took the ball to the neat (left) post," Ferruzzi said.
"This forced the goalie and sweeper to commit. Walter
was unmarked and I just pushed the ball to him."
Titinger tallied his second goal and the Card s third at
the 81-minute mark, with Kingson receiving credit for the
assist.
