# Cardinal water polo team loses by a point twice
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
There's an old saying that "the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away."
After two heartbreaking losses to co-
No. 5 USC and No. 2 Cal State Long
Beach, the Stanford water polo team, also
ranked fifth, must be asking when the
Lord giveth.
The Cardinal dropped to 11-9-3 and 0-2
in the Pacific-10 and watched two game
ending goals nearly wash away its hopes
for an NCAA tournament bid.
As the final horn sounded on Friday,
USC forward Kile Hardesty rifled a cross
cage shot into the upper left corner of the
goal to lift the Trojans to an important 6-5
victory over the Card.
"The play was designed to open up
(Mike) Spicer," USC Head Coach )ohn
Williams happily recalled, "but it didn't
when Stanford switched, so the second
was to Kile (Hardesty)."
The goal culminated a frantic final quar
ter in which Stanford rallied to score
three unanswered goals and take a 5-4 ad
vantage with 2:07 to go.
But USC Ail-American hope Mike
Spicer connected with his fourth goal of
the contest 17 seconds later to set the

stage for Hardesty's heroics.
Stanford Head Coach Dante Dettamanti
was livid afterwards, particularly upset
about his team's overall performance
rather than a few "critical errors" in the
final minute that led to the winning goal.
"I was completely disappointed," he
said. "We weren't ready to play against
the team we had to beat to get to the
NCAAs.
"We played good defense, but had no
intensity on offense. The only time we did
was in the fourth quarter and that's when
we scored three goals."
The Cardinal bounced back on Satur
day morning to turn in their "best game
of the year," according to Dettamanti,
only to see it end in a 7-6 loss to Long
Beach State when the 49ers' Randy Leach
tallied 20 seconds into a sudden death,
seventh period.
Like USC, the 49ers gave the comeback
Card a taste of their own medicine,
wiping out a 4-2 third quarter deficit to tie
the game in regulation at 6-6.
The sudden death goal that followed
gave Long Beach a 2-0-1 slate against Stan
ford this year and capped a battle that was
every bit as close as the score indicated.

Spectators were treated to sharp shoot
ing, solid goaltending, nail-biting drama
and even a few heated discussions with
the officials.
Despite the loss, the superb play
prompted Dettamanti to conclude, "If
there is such a thing as a good loss, today
was a good loss against the second best
team in the country."
The "good" loss helped to spoil a spar
kling weekend by Jaime Velez. The soph
omore forward from Puerto Rico scored a
pair against USC and pumped home four
more in vain on Saturday â€” each appear
ing to be a prettier shot than the time
before.
"It's pretty demoralizing," Velez said in
summing up the Cardinal's feelings. "We
really worked and were playing well. All
that effort and you come away with noth
ing."
Velez got things started against the
Niners converting a steal into a
breakaway goal after 1:14 of the first
stanza. Freshman David Imbonino fol
lowed with a sweet backhander with the
shot clock winding down and the Card

the net in Friday's 6-5 victory over Stanford. On Saturday, the Card lost another one-point
game, this time to Long Beach State 7-6.
