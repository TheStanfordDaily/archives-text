# Dillard plays, but pays

Corvallis, Ore. — To play Marshall Dillard
or not to play Marshall Dillard, that is the
question. And it's a question that the Stan
ford coaching staff has been trying to an
swer the past couple of weeks. But like
Hamlet, their decision to play Dillard may
have come too late.
Because of injuries to fullbacks Kaulana
Park and Rob Moore, the freshman, Dillard,
was called into action tor the first time Satur
day and responded tor 67 yards on 12 carries
and had another 50 yards in pass receiving.
The Stanford coaches had wanted to red
shirt Dillard, but Moore's injury in the first
quarter on Saturday game forced them to
put the freshman in the game.
"I didn't realize that they (Stanford) had a
fullback that was so big," Oregon State

Coach Joe Avezzano responded after the
game. "He made some real big short runs.''
Dillard. at 6-foot-3, 210 pounds is the big
bruising fullback that Stanford has never
had. The kind of back that breaks tackles
and gets yardage when there is nothing
there.

While most of the sportswriters were
trying to figure out why Dillard had not
played sooner, the Cardinal freshman ex
plained why it took so long foi him to finally
get his chance.
"The coaches were taking their time with
me," Dillard said after the game. "They
haven't really needed me until this point. I
may or may not have been able to play ear
lier. I thought after last week I would have to
redshirt. Today, they really had to use me."
After being hampered by a groin pull in
the early part of training camp Dillard finally
made the travelling team alter the Okla
homa game. Only this past week did Dillard
learn that he might have a chance to play.
Because Dillard plaved Saturday, he lost
his chance to redshirt this year, but he said
he doesn't mind because the team comes
first. "I wanted to play," Dillard said. "If I'm
going to help the team by playing, forget
about me."
Stanford Coach Paul Wiggm said Dillard
may start next week.
"There is a chance that Marshall Dillard
could start next week, especially consider
ing the way he responded today, and be
cause of the condition of Rob Moore's
knee," VViggin said after the game. "He
(Dillard) is everything I thought he would
be. Perhaps we can now make a commit
ment to him."
In high school. Dillard rushed for 2115
yards for Bakersfield in his senior year, the
second highest total by a California running
back ever, and he was a Blue Chip National
High School All-American.
Dillard, who hasn't played since high
school, is happy to be involved in a game
once again. "It was a great feeling to be out
on the playing field again," he said.
Vet many writers and fans were wonder
ing why he hadn't been out there sooner.
