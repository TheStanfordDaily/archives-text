# UCLA upsets spikers in 5 games
## Bruins halt Card streak 
### TOM MOORE 
Relying on tenacious outside hitting and
clutch inside blocking, UCLA upset Stanford 3-
2 (10-15, 9-15, 15-11, 15-9, 15-13) in women's
volleyball action Friday night at Maples
Pavilion.
The defeat snapped a 14-match winning
streak for Stanford and left it tied for first place
in the competitive WCAA with the Bruins. Both
teams have 8-1 records in league play.
"It (ending the streak) had to happen sooner
or later," said Cardinal assistant coach Don
Shaw. "You have to give UCLA credit. They're a
good team." Stanford now has five conference
matches remaining, including one against
UCLA in Los Angeles.
"It's a dogfight now," Shaw continued.
"We've got our work cut out for us."
With Friday's match knotted at two games
apiece, Stanford fell behind 12-8 in the third
and deciding game. But with a vocal home
crowd of nearly 2000 urging them on, the Card
spikers climbed back into the match.
Senior ]ulie Baker and sophomore Kim Oden
teamed for a crucial block to regain the Card's
serve. Two Oden smashes and two errant
UCLA kills later, the score was tied at 12-12.
UCLA forged ahead on a thunderous block
by Patty Orozco and Merja Connolly, but Stan
ford again tied it when junior Deidr.* Dvorak set
Oden for an intimidating slam.
UCLA assumed a 14-13 lead on a cross-court
smash by Liz Masakayan. Suddenly, it was
match point and the Card's back was against
the wall. However, a key block by junior Bobbi

Broer and senior Kari Rush kept Stanford alive
and regained its serve.
But the Cardinal could not capitalize on it*
opportunity to tie the match. After a side-out
UCLA again went to Orozco and the match wa
quickly over.
As a team, Stanford outhit UCLA 74 to 67 in
kills. The advantage was most apparent in the
first two games, both of which the Card won
handily by scores of 15-10 and 15-9. After taking
a 2-0 lead in games, Stanford appeared to be in
control of the match.
But the Bruins clawed back, taking advantage
of a Cardinal letdown in the third game to win it
15-11 and then ripping off the first eight point
in the fourth game en route to the 15-9 score
that set the stage for the dramatic fifth game.
"We were really organized the first two
games," Shaw said after the match. "We've
come from behind (in fifth games) before, but
you can't rely on it every time."
Oden, freshman Barbara Fontana and innioi
Lisa Murphy led the Stanford offensive attack
with 21, 13 and eight kills, respectively.
UCLA's Orozco finished with an astounding
26 kills and a .446 hitting percentage.
Saturday night, the Cardinal travelled to U(
Berkeley for a non-conference match. After
losing the first game and falling behind 8-0 in
the second, the Card spikers regrouped to take
the game 15-11 en route to another fifth game
This time, however, Stanford emerged the
victor on the high side of a 14-16, 15-11, 15-6,
14-16, 15-6 decision. The win improved the
Card's overall mark to 15-3.

Pavilion. The next night, however, the Card rebounded to hand UC-Berkeley a 3-2 setback
on the Cal home court.
