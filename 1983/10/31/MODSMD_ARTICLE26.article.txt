# Bears beat Card kilters on home (astro) turf
## 
### JOHN LIS 
Berkeley — On a gray, drizzling
Saturday morning, on an astroturf
field in the shadow of California
Memorial Stadium, the Stanford
women's field hockey team's
hopes of gaining an NCAA tourna
ment berth were dealt a crippling
blow, as the No. 13 ranked Car
dinal dropped a heartbreaking 1-0
decision to UC-Berkeley.
Cal sophomore forward Renee
Thiels took a pass from junior
teammate Bunny Freud at the top
of the circle and drove it home be
hind Stanford goalie Bonnie
Warner to give the No. 11 ranked
Bears the only goal they needed.
The score came at 4:11 into the
second half.
Cal, now 10-6-1, came out

strong to begin the game, keeping
play in the Stanford end for most
of the first 15 minutes, firing eight
shots on goal in that time. The last
of those early shots seemed
destined for the Cardinal goal, but
Stanford defender Suzanne Doi
alertly got her stick on the ball and
flicked it clear of the goal mouth.
The last 20 minutes of the half
remained in Cal's favor, though
the Cardinal managed to mount
some attacks of its own. The best
of these opportunities came when
freshman midfielder Mary Chung
came clear on a breakaway in the
final minute of the half, but a good
defensive play prevented her from
getting off a shot.
Cal's control of the first half was
evident in the statistics. The Bears

had 12 shots on goal to three for
Stanford.
Cal struck after halftime when
Thiels scored what would prove to
be the game's only goal. The Bears
had another excellent scoring op
portunity 12 minutes later off a
penalty corner, but Cal senior
midfielder Renee Chatas hit the
P< )st with her shot.
With five minutes left in the
game, the Stanford offense began
to press hard for the tying goal.
Junior forward Jennifer Bleakley
broke in all alone on Cal freshman
goalie Kim Haas, but Haas came
out of the cage to break up the
play.
The Cardinal continued to con
trol play, forcing a penalty corner.
Senior forward Patsy Huntington

took the pass off of the corner and
fired what appeared to be the
tying score. The officials,
however, ruled the shot too high,
and the goal was disallowed.
Stanford continued to press,
and, with 45 seconds left in the
game, junior forward Karen
Chamberlain broke clear and
weaved around two Cal
defenders, but could not get past
the final blue-clad player. The Car
dinal desperately tried to tie the
contest, and managed to get a
penalty corner in the closing
seconds, but time expired before
a shot could be taken.
Killefer was particularly im
pressed by her defense, and cited
the play of Warner, Doi, and
freshman Janet Lohman — who

took a ball in the face early on, but
later returned — as particularly
outstanding.
Cal dominated the statistical de- *
partment. The Bears outshot Stan
ford, 21-5, and had 15 penalty cor
ners to the Cardinal's nine.
Stanford, which fell to 9-8-1, still
has a chance at a post-season bid.
Although only 12 teams are taken
for the NCAA tournament, the se
lection is done by regions, which
might allow the No. 13 Cardinal to
slip in. Killefer, though, looked at
this possibility realistically. "We
still have an opportunity, " she
said, "but our chances are very
slim."
The Cardinal returns home to
face Long Beach State Wednesday
in the final game of the season.
