### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy hosted more than 175 students
Friday evening at his residence,
Hoover House, to honor their sum
mer involvement in public service.
In last spring's commencement
address, Kennedy urged students to
take part in some form of public ser
vice in the near future. The recep
tion, he said, was not just a means to
re-emphasize his words then, but to
help "popularize and facilitate"
public service activities among stu
dents now.
Kennedy said students par
ticipated in a "remarkable array of
experiences" this summer.
Priorities now are to "focus more at
tention" and "raise consciousness"
of public service opportunities to

University students, he said.
Kennedy noted that students were
involved in public service at the na
tional, state and local levels.
Over 100 students participated in
Stanford-in-Government in Wash
ingtort, D.C. last summer, said Cat
herine Milton, special assistant to
the president and a chief organizer
of Kennedy's project for public ser
vice.
Milton said she contacted various
University departments to seek out
other students who took part in
public or community service over
the summer.
The University, for the first time,
sent coordinators to Washington to
organize a series of social, political
and educational events, said coor
dinator Diane Stewart.
