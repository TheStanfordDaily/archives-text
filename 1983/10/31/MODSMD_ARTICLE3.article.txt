# Law students ready opening of East Palo Alto legal office
## 
### GINNY GUISER 
After securing nearly $200,000 in
donations and grants, law stu
dents here continue the drive to
establish a legal aid office in East
Palo Alto by February, 1984.
"It is astonishing what the stu
dents have done in fund raising,
considering the economy," said
Law School Prof. William Simon.
Planning began two years ago
on the Palo Alto community law
project, which was initiated to
improve legal services in East
Palo Alto," according to Steven
Dinkelspiel, fund-raising chair
man of the group.
East Palo Alto, a city of 18,000,
now has only two lawyers, and
they handle mostly criminal
cases. The San Mateo Legal Aid

Office in Redwood City has lim
ited resources because of federal
budget cuts and cannot ade
quately cover East Palo Alto, ac
cording to Peggy Russell, third
year law student and president of
the group.
Both Dinkelspiel and Russell
stressed the importance of the
program's community education
plan, which is designed to help
East Palo Alto residents become
more "self-reliant" in legal mat
ters. Several community semi
nars on issues such as consumer
and landlord-tenant law are
scheduled this fall.
For law students, the project is
also intended "to provide a pre
viously unavailable clinical law
experience and to encourage

public interest career al
ternatives," Dinkelspiel said.
Dinkelspiel further described
the group's efforts as an attempt
to bring more diversity to the Law
School and provide more balance
to a school from which most
graduates enter corporate law.
Students, who are now
"farmed out" to area legal aid
programs, will work at the East
Palo Alto office as part of their
course work in poverty law, ac
cording to Dinkelspiel.
The group originally planned
to open the East Palo Alto office
in September. It was forced to
move back the date because of
problems in securing the neces
sary financial backing.
