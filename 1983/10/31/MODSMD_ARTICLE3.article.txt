# Law students ready opening of East Palo Alto legal office
## 
### GINNY GUISER 
After securing nearly $200,000 in
donations and grants, law stu
dents here continue the drive to
establish a legal aid office in East
Palo Alto by February, 1984.
"It is astonishing what the stu
dents have done in fund raising,
considering the economy," said
Law School Prof. William Simon.
Planning began two years ago
on the Palo Alto community law
project, which was initiated to
improve legal services in East
Palo Alto," according to Steven
Dinkelspiel, fund-raising chair
man of the group.
East Palo Alto, a city of 18,000,
now has only two lawyers, and
they handle mostly criminal
cases. The San Mateo Legal Aid

Office in Redwood City has lim
ited resources because of federal
budget cuts and cannot ade
quately cover East Palo Alto, ac
cording to Peggy Russell, third
year law student and president of
the group.
Both Dinkelspiel and Russell
stressed the importance of the
program's community education
plan, which is designed to help
East Palo Alto residents become
more "self-reliant" in legal mat
ters. Several community semi
nars on issues such as consumer
and landlord-tenant law are
scheduled this fall.
For law students, the project is
also intended "to provide a pre
viously unavailable clinical law
experience and to encourage

public interest career al
ternatives," Dinkelspiel said.
Dinkelspiel further described
the group's efforts as an attempt
to bring more diversity to the Law
School and provide more balance
to a school from which most
graduates enter corporate law.
Students, who are now
"farmed out" to area legal aid
programs, will work at the East
Palo Alto office as part of their
course work in poverty law, ac
cording to Dinkelspiel.
The group originally planned
to open the East Palo Alto office
in September. It was forced to
move back the date because of
problems in securing the neces
sary financial backing.
"Fund raising is difficult in these
economic times," Russell said.
"We've been successful, but it has
taken longer than we projected."
The project has raised $108,000 for
its first year. This will pay for three
staff attorneys to handle landlord
tenant, public benefits, domestic
and other cases, Dinkelspiel said.

The funds raised include $62,500
from the San Francisco Foundation,
$25,000 from the Peninsula Founda
tion and $12,500 from individual
donors.
Dinkelspiel said that the project
has raised $90,000 for the second
year. If the project can raise enough
money to sustain itself for two years
and is academically successful, Law
School Dean John Ely will consider
funding the program.
The enthusiasm of the project's
organizers has spread to other law
students. The school's 1-year-old
poverty law seminar is very popular
and usually over-subscribed, indica
ting a high level of interest, Russell
said.
"About 50 students are working
on project committees such as fund
raising, publicity and community
education seminars," Russell said.
According to Dinkelspiel, "First
year law students have shown an in
credible interest in the project. Out
of 170 students, 50 to 60 came to the
project orientation and half of those
have taken an interest in active in
volvement in the program."
