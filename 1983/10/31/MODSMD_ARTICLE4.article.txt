# Loan program will help faculty pay for housing
## 
### JERRY BALL Staff writer 
The new "10/30" loan program, recently ap
proved by the Board of Trustees, will make it
easier for faculty and staff members to afford
housing here.
The 10/30 program will replace the second
loan mortgage coinvestment (COIN) program
which was in effect until this month.
According to Robin Hamill, director of the Of
fice of Housing and Transportation Programs, a
borrower in the new program will take out
"what looks like a conventional 30-year loan
from an outside lender, but will be able to defer
a portion of his monthly payments for the tirst
10 years of the loan.
According to the Board of Trustees agenda,

the aim of the 10/30 program is to enable and
encourage faculty to purchase homes in the
local community, thereby facilitating the Uni
versity's goal of "attracting and retaining an out
standing faculty and senior staff."
Hamill said the ease of owning a home in the
local area plays a crucial role in faculty recruit
ing. She said before the University began offer
ing housing loans, "We had a couple of nearly
disastrous recruiting seasons."
According to Hamill, when asked why they
went elsewhere, former faculty recruits "in al
most all cases replied that the reason was
housing." She said recruits were not nearly as
likely to come to Stanford if they "had to pay
$100,000 for a house in Palo Alto when they

could buy the same house in Cambridge
(Massachusetts) for $75,000."
Hamill said that the 10/30 program should
even out these differences.
The amount a borrower can now defer is a
function of purchase price," Hamill said. In
most cases the interest rate a faculty member
pays will be 7 percent plus 0.2 percent for every
$10,000 that the purchase price exceeds
$250,000. The sum of these deferred payments
and the interest they have accrued is due at the
end of 10 years.
The portion of this debt that the University in
curs is determined by the market value of the
house. The borrower in the 10/30 program is re-
