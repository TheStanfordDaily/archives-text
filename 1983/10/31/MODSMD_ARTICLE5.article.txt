U.S. captures Soviet documents in Grenada
Washington — Deputy Secretary of State Kenneth Dam said yester
day that the United States has captured a treasure trove of docu
ments" in Grenada, including an agreement for the Soviet Union to
ship weapons through Cuba to the ousted Grenadian regime.
Dam said the documents also include separate agreements for
Grenada to receive supplies from communist C üba and North Korea.
To further bolster the administration's contentions that Grenada was
being turned into a base for insurgency in the Caribbean, he disputed
media reports that many of the stock-piled arms found by U.S. forces
were "antiquated," and he asked: "Why would the Grenadian mili
tary," which had an estimated 1200 men, "require 18,000 uniforms?''
Dam, interviewed on CBS' "Face the Nation ', was one ot three
senior administration officials who went on television yesterday to
defend U.S. intervention as necessary to rescue U.S. citizens and

block a Soviet-Cuban plan to use the tiny eastern Caribbean island as
a center for aiding subversion and insurgency in the region.
The others were U.N. Ambassador K ane Kirkpatrick and Lawrence
Eagleberger, undersecretary of state to political affairs.
Although the Defense Department earlier had scaled back by about
300 its estimate of the number of Cubans on the island, Dam and the
others insisted that, when captured equipment and documents are
analyzed and the results made public, administration charges will be
validated.
The three officials spoke as the Pentagon announced that 16
Americans died in the fighting that be gan last Tuesday. The revised
casualty report increased the number of Americans dead by five and
reported 77 wounded and three missing. Of the five new deaths, four
men had been listed as missing.
As Pentagon officials confirmed th.it the fighting now has largely
ended, attention began to focus anew on when the approximately
6000 U.S. troops involved in the invasion will be withdrawn and what
steps will be taken to create an independent government for the
110,000 people of Grenada.
Prime Minister Tom Adams of Barbados, one of six Caribbean na
tions joining the United States in the intervention, said the U.S. mili
tary role will be finished when Grenadian Governor General Paul
Scoon completes the plan for an interim government.
Adams, interviewed from Barbados on ABC's "This Week With
David Brinkley," said he expects Scoon to announce his arrangements
this week.
U.S. officials have spoken only in vague terms about their expecta
tion for Grenada's political future. However, they are known to
believe that the situation should follow the pattern used after the 1965
U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic.
Grenadians begin picking up the pieces
St. George's, Grenada — Grenadians will begin picking up the pieces
of their lives in shops, schools, and government offices today as the
tiny island begins to total the astronomical economic and human cost
of foreign intervention.
Sir Paul Scoon, the island's sole surviving constitutional authority,
summoned Grenadians back to work yesterday in a radio address
promising creation of a non-political interim government within the
next few days.
"Let it be clearly understood that this will not be an administration
of politicians," said Scoon, the British governor-general here. "This
interim administration will provide us with the necessary breathing
space to enable arrangements to be made for an early return to full
constitutional government by way of general elections."
Scoon ordered schools and government offices reopened this mor
ning for the first time since the assassination of Prime Minister
Maurice Bishop Oct. 19 set the stage for last week's American inva
sion. Scoon also urged businessmen to reopen their doors on an is
land whose basic commodities are in short supply.
Military specialists and civilian technicians flown to the island
worked yesterday to repair essential services disrupted by civil unrest
and the intervention that followed.
Some sections of the capital had electricity and running water, but
others did not. The island's telecommunications system was still out,
to the chagrin of an army of foreign news reporters finally unleashed
on Grenada yesterday by beleaguered military authorities who had
restricted their access for five days.
Overall, Grenada's losses are both tangible and intangible.
The new government will have to wrestle with everything from res
toration of garbage collection to creation of a new police force to
recreation of a tourist economy.
Political sources here believe that the new interim government may
have to include Grenadians living abroad as private citizens or interna
tional public servants. Who might run for office once the elections are
scheduled is an enigma, since the resident political class has been
decimated on a island with fewer than 100,000 residents.

Lebanon's factions prepare for negotiations
Geneva, Switz. — Lebanon's warring Christian and Moslem
patriarchs intensified preparations yesterday for their first peace con
ference in 40 years aimed at renegotiating the nation's shredded pact
for sharing power and maintaining peaceful co-existence.
Delegations that will participate in the national reconciliation con
ference scheduled to open today or tomorrow were nearly complete
with the arrival yesterday of Sheik Pierre Gemayel, leader of the Chris
tian Maronite Phalangist political party.
The conference's results are likek to decide not only the fate of the
war-battered and badly fragmented nation, but also the degree of
future U.S. support for Gemayel's son, Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel, U.S. and Lebanese officials agree.
The talks will open in an atmosphere of strong pessimism. Druze
leader Walid Jumblatt, who arrived here Friday, told Swiss television
that "everything has to be changed He held consultations in nearby
Montreux over the weekend with his collegues in the opposition Na
tional Salvation Front — former Prime Minister Kashid Karame, a Sun
ni Moslem, and former President Soleiman Franjeik, a Christian
opposed to Gemayel.
lumblatt said the conference's success depended on the Gemayels
and their Phalangist backer making the "necessary concessions" to
establish a new Democratic and non-sectarian Lebanon. Otherwise,
he said, it was back to war.
The fear, hate and mutual distrust built up among the 17 religious
communities of Lebanon over the past nine years of political turmoil
are so strong that the conference's participants acknowledge that un
controllable "events" could overtake the reconciliation process long
before any agreement reached here can be implemented.
In the five weeks that have passed since the Sept. 26 cease-fire
agreement, "events" nearly succeeded in sabotaging the reconcilia
tion conference.
Even before the bomb attacks on U.S. and French peacekeeping
troops in Beirut a week ago yesterday, Washington and Paris had
warned President Gemayel that a failure of this conference because of
intransigence by him or the Christians could seriously jeopardize their
continued backing of the multinational peacekeeping force.
Jesse jackson announces candidacy
New York — The Rev. Jesse Jackson announced yesterday he will
seek the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination and said he would
try to choose a female running mate.
The civil rights leader, in an interview recorded for the CBS-TV pro
gram "60 Minutes," said he would formally announce his candidacy
Thursday in Washington. He is seeking to become the first black
presidential candidate nominated by a major party.
Although many black political leaders have said they will not sup
port him, fearing such a campaign would be divisive, Jackson said,
"No candidate can expect to have unanimous support from any given
community."
On the subject of a running mate, Jackson was asked by CBS corre
spondent Mike Wallace, "Are you now saying that you will choose, if
you can, a woman, be she white or black?"

"There's no doubt about it," Jackson replied.
Jackson said he will try to win votes from younger Americans.
"Twenty-five percent of all the eligible black voters are between the
ages of 18 and 24," Jackson said. "The group had been voting at about
a 10 percent level. It's obvious it would move above 50 percent now."
Jackson said of 18 million eligible black voters, only 10 million are
registered.
"(If) we move to get another 3 million on the books by next Novem
ber, we will have changed Democratic options in the primaries," he
said.
The 42-year-old Jackson heads Operation PUSH, a Chicago-based
community-service organization that concentrates on registering
voters.
Earthquake in Turkey kills 509
Istanbul, Turkey — A major earthquake struck eastern Turkey early
yesterday and officials said at least 509 people were killed.
Newspapers said 50 villages were leveled, and the death toll was ex
pected to climb.
About three hours earlier a quake rolled through the Hindu Kush
mountain range, 1400 miles to the east on the border between Af
ghanistan and Pakistan, shaking Islamabad and reaching as far as In
dia's Kashmir state. There were no immediate reports of casualties or
damage. More than 12 hours later, a strong quake shook southwes
tern Japan, but no casualties were reported.
Election held in Argentina
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Nearly 18 million Argentines voted yester
day in the first elections in 10 years, designed to replace a military
regime that seized power in 1976, led a bloody crackdown on leftists
and lost the Falklands War.
Whoever wins will have to deal with the worst economic crisis in Ar
gentina's history.
Polls opened at 8 a.m. and long lines formed in front of schools and
other public buildings as voters hurried to cast ballots before the 6
p.m. closing time. The Federal Police Office said voting was peaceful.
The national election headquarters in Buenos Aires reported that
the 17.9 million registered voters were casting ballots nationwide
without incident." All citizens between the ages of 18 and 70 years
must vote in election for national, state and local office. For those
over 70, voting is optional. Preliminary results were expected late yes
terday with official returns not likely before noon today.
Sunny weather prevailed throughout most of the country. But thun
derstorms in the far northeast forced officials to use Army helicopters
to transport ballot boxes to isolated communities.
The military government agreed to the elections after Argentina lost
a 74-day war with Britain last year for control of the Falkland Islands.
Today's weather
Rain likely through Tuesday. Highs in the 60s. Southerly winds to 15
to 25 mph. Lows in the 50s.
