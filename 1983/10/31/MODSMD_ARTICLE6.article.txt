# Deferments harm University funds
## 
### VAL CRITES 
The University has 3598 student bills outstanding,
delaying the receipt of more than $7.7 million in ex
pected revenues because an unusually high number of
students are deferring payment of their bills while
waiting for finalized Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL)
papers, according to officials in the Student Accounting
Office.
And the delaying of payment has reduced the
amount of money the University has as its disposal for
investment, which could cause a significant — though
now undetermined — loss of revenue.
'The cost to the University is tremendous," said Uni
versity Bursar Joseph Jedd. "We have very good cash
management and utilize our money to the best advan
tage. Consequently, every day the money is not here
the University is losing anticipated revenue. The more
deferments we have, the more problems we face."
There was a 29-percent increase over last year in the
total monetary amount deferred by students this year.
And there was a 13-percent rise in the amount collected
at registration. The 16-percent difference represents
the University's shortfall this year.
The Financial Aids Office's processing of student aid
forms was delayed at least two weeks this summer
when the student group Stanford Against Conscription
requested that the University include in financial aid

mailings a statement pointing out that the University
would meet student needs regardless of draft registra
tion status.
Although the majority of students name CSLs as the
cause of their deferment, it is impossible to pinpoint
for exactly how many students this is the case or how
much money is involved in GSL deferments, |edd said.
"We don't have any statistics readily available that
tell us how much of the delay is attributable to the ear
lier delays in our mailing of aid offers," Jedd said. "This
would involve the review of thousands of bills to deter
mine how many indicate GSLs as cause for deferment.
This process is relatively easy but extremely time
consuming. We intend to review the bills eventually
but we are too pressed for time to do it now."
Because more money is being deferred each year the
University enacted stiffer penalties last year that were
expected to reduce this year's deferments.
"Last year we stiffened deferment policy with the
purpose in mind of reducing the ease of deferring, and
we hoped, the number of deferments," Jedd said. "We
expected that the new system would result in fewer
deferments. This has not been true. Although we don't
have the figures yet, we expect a vast majority of these
deferments to be linked with delays in the GSL process
ing. This would tie in directly with our delays of last
summer."
