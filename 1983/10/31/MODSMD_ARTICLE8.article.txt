Sunday, Oct. 23
A suicide terrorist drives a truck
packed with 2000 pounds of TNT
through low-security barricades into
the headquarters of the American
Marine peacekeeping force in
Beirut. The ensuing explosion takes
at least 161 lives, according to initial
reports; about 75 others are injured.
Many other casualties are believed
to buried under rubble.
Moments after the attack on the
Marines, another suicide terrorist
crashes a truck-bomb into French
military headquarters; officials on
the scene initially put the toll at 27
dead, 13 wounded and 48 missing.
As the previously unknown Is
lamic Revolutionary Movement
takes responsibility for the incident
and threatens continued violence,
administration officials implicate
Iran as a perpetrator in the crisis.
In concert with other Western
leaders, President Reagan
denounces the attack and expresses
grief over "the loss of those splen
did young men and the injury to so
many others."
The president also vows to con
tinue the American military pres
ence in Lebanon. Members of the
multinational peacekeeping force
generally express solidarity with
Reagan's decision not to allow the
bombings to "drive us out of that
area."
In Washington and Beirut, Ameri
can military and foreign policy
leaders debate ways to increase the
safety and effectiveness of the
Marine contingent. Pentagon and
State Department task forces are im
mediately initiated to explore op
tions available to the peacekeeping
force.
Meanwhile in Grenada, the ruling
military council places its armed
forces on alert and mobilizes militia
reserves in preparation for an
"imminent invasion" by the United
States.
The Radio Free Grenada an
nouncement arrives as eastern
Caribbean leaders meet for a
second day of talks in Port of Spain,
Trinidad, to decide on sanctions
against Gen. Hudson Austin and his
16-member council. Austin seized
control of Grenada Wednesday after
the execution of Prime Minister
Maurice Bishop and 16 cabinet
members.
Citing concern for the safety of
nearly 1000 Americans on the island,
administration officials disclose that
10 warships heading for Lebanon

have been diverted to Grenada to
assist in a possible evacuation of
U.S. citizens. The officials add that
two American diplomats are leaving
Barbados for St. George's, the
Grenadian capital, to monitor the
safety of Americans confronted with
the Austin regime.
Monday, Oct. 24
As the American death toll in
Beirut climbs to 191, Reagan admin
istration officials reaffirm commit
ment to keeping U.S. troops in
Lebanon and imply that the Soviet
Union and its surrogates — namely
Syria — will swiftly fill the vacuum if
the multinational force abandons its
mission.
"If we are driven out of Lebanon,
radical and rejectionist elements will
have scored a major victory," Secre
tary of State George Shultz asserts.
"The message will be sent that
relying on the Soviet Union pays off
and that relying on the United States
is a fatal mistake.
"We're all frustrated by the fact
that these terrorists can hit and run
and disappear into the society and
you can't do anything about it,"
Shultz tells reporters as the adminis
tration confronts mounting criticism
from conservative and liberal
leaders questioning the mission of
the Marine contingent.
Shultz also stresses that "the pres
ident was an unhappy and tired man
Sunday night."
In Grenada, rumors of U.S. inva
sion persist. Late Monday night, the
Associated Press says an unknown
number of Marines are heading for
the island, but additional informa
tion is sketchy.
Tuesday, Oct. 25
The invasion of Grenada by 1900
U.S. Marines and Army Rangers
meets "unexpectedly strong" resis
tance from Cuban military person
nel involved with the construction
of new airport.
News reporters are banned from
the island and compelled to quote
administration sources, who note
the deaths of six U.S. servicemen
and the wounding of at least 26
others.
While the administration says 12
Cubans and three Grenadians
perished in the initial assault, the
deputy chief of Grenada's U.N.
delegation claims that "several
hundred people, many of them
civilians, have been killed as a result
of the attack/'
The American troops, with the as
sistance of 300 military personnel
from neighboring Caribbean

countries, capture 30 Soviet advisers
and 600 Cubans. Security at the U.S.
military hast* at Gauntanamo, Cuba,
is beefed up in anticipation of a pos
sible retaliatory move by Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
In the face of mixed reaction na
tionally and worldwide, President
Reagan asserts that the invasion is a
necessary move to rid Grenada of a
"group ot brutal leftist thugs," a ref
erence to last week's coup and ex
ecutions by the Hustin regime.
Reagan stresses that the removal
ot these "thugs" is essential "to
protect innocent lives, to forestall
further chaos and to assist in the res
toration of law and order" in
Grenada. The attack, Reagan con
tinues, is a crucial step "to restore
democracy" on the island.
In Lebanon, workers continue to
dig for bodies as the American death
toll rises to 216. French President
Francois Mitterand visits the disaster
scene and reaffirms France's com
mitment to the multinational force.
Wednesday, Oct. 26
Students are rescued from St.
George's University Medical School
in Grenada, and the Grenadian army
headquarters falls to U.S. invaders.
While Havana claims that Cuban
military action on Grenada has
ended, Washington contends that
U.S. troops are still drawing fire
from isolated pockets of Cuban
resistance.
The first two planes carrying U.S.
citizens from the island land at
Charleston, South Carolina, with
141 passengers aboard.
Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger says six Americans are
dead, 33 wounded and eight missing
in the conflict. And 800 U.S.
paratroopers join the invasion force,
which the administration now says
consists of about ?000 troops.
In Cuba, government officials say
the last remaining Cuban troops
"sacrificed" themselves rather than
surrender to U.S. forces. The Bar
bados state-owned Caribbean
Broadcasting Co. reports that at
least 30 Cubans died in the fight.
Meanwhile, the remains of 219
Americans have been unearthed in
Beirut, and 53 bodies have been
recovered at the French military
compound. Vice President George
Bush visits the scene and other ad
ministration officials admit that defi
cient security at Marine
headquarters contributed to the dis
aster.
Thursday, Oct. 27
Calling Grenada a "Soviet-Cuban

colony" on the brink of exporting
terrorism, President Reagan tells
America that the invaders "got there
just in time."
Reagan's words draw heavy fire
from the United Nations, where the
Security Council votes 11-1 to con
demn the American attack. In the
first Congressional action, the
House Foreign Affairs Committee
votes 32-2 to approve legislation
aimed at applying the War Powers
Act to U.S. military involvement in
Grenada.
As fighting continues on the is
land, Gen. Austin and a small con
tingent continue to hold out against
the U.S. assault.
Reagan administration officials say
they have discovered 1100 Cubans
on Grenada, about 400 more than
previously believed — an indication
that Cuba planned to take complete
control of the island.
In Havana, government officials
announce that Cuba has accepted
an offer from Colombia and Spain to
mediate the return of 638 Cubans
taken into custody in Grenada. Eas
tern Bloc leaders continue to con
demn U.S. actions in the Caribbean
and Lebanon.
While the death toll climbs to 221
in Beirut, backers of the Gemayel
government stage demonstrations
to show support for the multination
al peacekeeping force. President
Reagan says events in Lebanon and
Grenada are linked to Soviet
schemes to promote terrorism
worldwide.

"Can the United States or the free
world, for that matter, stand by and
see the Middle East incorporated
into the Soviet Bloc?" the president
asks in Thursday's nationally
televised address.
Friday, Oct. 28
Fighting against Grenadian and
Cuban holdouts in the mountains of
Grenada could go on for days or
weeks, according to U.S. military of
ficials. The Senate votes 64-20 to re
quire the president to remove
troops from the island within 60
days under the War Powers Act.
In the latest news from Beirut, the
release of a diagram yesterday
detailing how the driver of the
truck-bomb managed to penetrate
the security parameter of American
headquarters prompts criticism
from various U.S. officials, who
charge that Marines could have
been better protected from possible
terrorist attacks.
There are 225 known dead in the
explosion at the American com
pound.
Saturday, 0ct.29
While about 6000 Americans at
tempt to dislodge an estimated 300
to 600 Cubans from mountain strong
holds in Grenada, St. George's is
looted and burned.
Senate leaders call for a fact
finding trip to the island. Members
of the Senate Select-Committee on
Intelligence say the administration
exaggerated the role of Cuba in
Grenada.

Deputy Assistant Secretary ot
State Richard Gillespie is named
charge d'affaires at the American
embassy in St. George's. Adminis
tration officials say 1200 Marines will
soon leave the island to augment
American forces in Lebanon.
In Beirut, Marines attempting to
uncover the dead contend with
renewed sniper fire, and the first of
the 229 servicemen uncovered from
the rubble arrive at Dover Air Force
Base in Delaware.
IN OTHER NEWS:
President Reagan fired half the Civil
Rights Commission to make room for
his own team of supporters, prompt
ing an outcry from major civil rights
groups.
Soviet leader Yuri Andropov an
nounced a new arms control plan to
demonstrate what he called Soviet
"flexibility," but warned that the
Geneva arms control talks will col
lapse if new U.S. medium-range nu
clear missiles are deployed in
Europe in December.
In Washington, experts said
changes in the new proposal are
both "cosmetic" and substantive.
They noted that the Soviets are at
tempting to hedge the United States
and its NATO allies by introducing
this new plan in the wake of the J
Grenada invasion. American con- J
duct in Grenada has been sharply i
criticized by many western
European leaders.

BEIRUT BLAST: A U.S. Marine is carried away from the site of the Oct. 23 terrorist bombing at the
American compound in Beirut. The American death toll now stands at 229.
C ompiled from the Associated Press and the I os Angeles TimesAA/ashington Post News Service and the New York Times

Sunday, Oct. 23
A suicide terrorist drives a truck
packed with 2000 pounds of TNT
through low-security barricades into
the headquarters of the American
Marine peacekeeping force in
Beirut. The ensuing explosion takes
at least 161 lives, according to initial
reports; about 75 others are injured.
Many other casualties are believed
to buried under rubble.
Moments after the attack on the
Marines, another suicide terrorist
crashes a truck-bomb into French
military headquarters; officials on
the scene initially put the toll at 27
dead, 13 wounded and 48 missing.
As the previously unknown Is
lamic Revolutionary Movement
takes responsibility for the incident
and threatens continued violence,
administration officials implicate
Iran as a perpetrator in the crisis.
In concert with other Western
leaders, President Reagan
denounces the attack and expresses
grief over "the loss of those splen
did young men and the injury to so
many others."
The president also vows to con
tinue the American military pres
ence in Lebanon. Members of the
multinational peacekeeping force
generally express solidarity with
Reagan's decision not to allow the
bombings to "drive us out of that
area."
In Washington and Beirut, Ameri
can military and foreign policy
leaders debate ways to increase the
safety and effectiveness of the
Marine contingent. Pentagon and
State Department task forces are im
mediately initiated to explore op
tions available to the peacekeeping
force.
Meanwhile in Grenada, the ruling
military council places its armed
forces on alert and mobilizes militia
reserves in preparation for an
"imminent invasion" by the United
States.
The Radio Free Grenada an
nouncement arrives as eastern
Caribbean leaders meet for a
second day of talks in Port of Spain,
Trinidad, to decide on sanctions
against Gen. Hudson Austin and his
16-member council. Austin seized
control of Grenada Wednesday after
the execution of Prime Minister
Maurice Bishop and 16 cabinet
members.
Citing concern for the safety of
nearly 1000 Americans on the island,
administration officials disclose that
10 warships heading for Lebanon

have been diverted to Grenada to
assist in a possible evacuation of
U.S. citizens. The officials add that
two American diplomats are leaving
Barbados for St. George's, the
Grenadian capital, to monitor the
safety of Americans confronted with
the Austin regime.
Monday, Oct. 24
As the American death toll in
Beirut climbs to 191, Reagan admin
istration officials reaffirm commit
ment to keeping U.S. troops in
Lebanon and imply that the Soviet
Union and its surrogates — namely
Syria — will swiftly fill the vacuum if
the multinational force abandons its
mission.
"If we are driven out of Lebanon,
radical and rejectionist elements will
have scored a major victory," Secre
tary of State George Shultz asserts.
"The message will be sent that
relying on the Soviet Union pays off
and that relying on the United States
is a fatal mistake.
"We're all frustrated by the fact
that these terrorists can hit and run
and disappear into the society and
you can't do anything about it,"
Shultz tells reporters as the adminis
tration confronts mounting criticism
from conservative and liberal
leaders questioning the mission of
the Marine contingent.
Shultz also stresses that "the pres
ident was an unhappy and tired man
Sunday night."
In Grenada, rumors of U.S. inva
sion persist. Late Monday night, the
Associated Press says an unknown
number of Marines are heading for
the island, but additional informa
tion is sketchy.
Tuesday, Oct. 25
The invasion of Grenada by 1900
U.S. Marines and Army Rangers
meets "unexpectedly strong" resis
tance from Cuban military person
nel involved with the construction
of new airport.
News reporters are banned from
the island and compelled to quote
administration sources, who note
the deaths of six U.S. servicemen
and the wounding of at least 26
others.
While the administration says 12
Cubans and three Grenadians
perished in the initial assault, the
deputy chief of Grenada's U.N.
delegation claims that "several
hundred people, many of them
civilians, have been killed as a result
of the attack/'
The American troops, with the as
sistance of 300 military personnel
from neighboring Caribbean

countries, capture 30 Soviet advisers
and 600 Cubans. Security at the U.S.
military hast* at Gauntanamo, Cuba,
is beefed up in anticipation of a pos
sible retaliatory move by Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
In the face of mixed reaction na
tionally and worldwide, President
Reagan asserts that the invasion is a
necessary move to rid Grenada of a
"group ot brutal leftist thugs," a ref
erence to last week's coup and ex
ecutions by the Hustin regime.
Reagan stresses that the removal
ot these "thugs" is essential "to
protect innocent lives, to forestall
further chaos and to assist in the res
toration of law and order" in
Grenada. The attack, Reagan con
tinues, is a crucial step "to restore
democracy" on the island.
In Lebanon, workers continue to
dig for bodies as the American death
toll rises to 216. French President
Francois Mitterand visits the disaster
scene and reaffirms France's com
mitment to the multinational force.
Wednesday, Oct. 26
Students are rescued from St.
George's University Medical School
in Grenada, and the Grenadian army
headquarters falls to U.S. invaders.
While Havana claims that Cuban
military action on Grenada has
ended, Washington contends that
U.S. troops are still drawing fire
from isolated pockets of Cuban
resistance.
The first two planes carrying U.S.
citizens from the island land at
Charleston, South Carolina, with
141 passengers aboard.
Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger says six Americans are
dead, 33 wounded and eight missing
in the conflict. And 800 U.S.
paratroopers join the invasion force,
which the administration now says
consists of about ?000 troops.
In Cuba, government officials say
the last remaining Cuban troops
"sacrificed" themselves rather than
surrender to U.S. forces. The Bar
bados state-owned Caribbean
Broadcasting Co. reports that at
least 30 Cubans died in the fight.
Meanwhile, the remains of 219
Americans have been unearthed in
Beirut, and 53 bodies have been
recovered at the French military
compound. Vice President George
Bush visits the scene and other ad
ministration officials admit that defi
cient security at Marine
headquarters contributed to the dis
aster.
Thursday, Oct. 27
Calling Grenada a "Soviet-Cuban

colony" on the brink of exporting
terrorism, President Reagan tells
America that the invaders "got there
just in time."
Reagan's words draw heavy fire
from the United Nations, where the
Security Council votes 11-1 to con
demn the American attack. In the
first Congressional action, the
House Foreign Affairs Committee
votes 32-2 to approve legislation
aimed at applying the War Powers
Act to U.S. military involvement in
Grenada.
As fighting continues on the is
land, Gen. Austin and a small con
tingent continue to hold out against
the U.S. assault.
Reagan administration officials say
they have discovered 1100 Cubans
on Grenada, about 400 more than
previously believed — an indication
that Cuba planned to take complete
control of the island.
In Havana, government officials
announce that Cuba has accepted
an offer from Colombia and Spain to
mediate the return of 638 Cubans
taken into custody in Grenada. Eas
tern Bloc leaders continue to con
demn U.S. actions in the Caribbean
and Lebanon.
While the death toll climbs to 221
in Beirut, backers of the Gemayel
government stage demonstrations
to show support for the multination
al peacekeeping force. President
Reagan says events in Lebanon and
Grenada are linked to Soviet
schemes to promote terrorism
worldwide.

"Can the United States or the free
world, for that matter, stand by and
see the Middle East incorporated
into the Soviet Bloc?" the president
asks in Thursday's nationally
televised address.
Friday, Oct. 28
Fighting against Grenadian and
Cuban holdouts in the mountains of
Grenada could go on for days or
weeks, according to U.S. military of
ficials. The Senate votes 64-20 to re
quire the president to remove
troops from the island within 60
days under the War Powers Act.
In the latest news from Beirut, the
release of a diagram yesterday
detailing how the driver of the
truck-bomb managed to penetrate
the security parameter of American
headquarters prompts criticism
from various U.S. officials, who
charge that Marines could have
been better protected from possible
terrorist attacks.
There are 225 known dead in the
explosion at the American com
pound.
Saturday, 0ct.29
While about 6000 Americans at
tempt to dislodge an estimated 300
to 600 Cubans from mountain strong

Senate leaders call for a fact

Grenada.

BEIRUT BLAST: A U.S. Marine is carried away from the site of the Oct. 23 terrorist bombing at the
American compound in Beirut. The American death toll now stands at 229.
C ompiled from the Associated Press and the I os Angeles TimesAA/ashington Post News Service and the New York Times

Sunday, Oct. 23
A suicide terrorist drives a truck
packed with 2000 pounds of TNT
through low-security barricades into
the headquarters of the American
Marine peacekeeping force in
Beirut. The ensuing explosion takes
at least 161 lives, according to initial
reports; about 75 others are injured.
Many other casualties are believed
to buried under rubble.
Moments after the attack on the
Marines, another suicide terrorist
crashes a truck-bomb into French
military headquarters; officials on
the scene initially put the toll at 27
dead, 13 wounded and 48 missing.
As the previously unknown Is
lamic Revolutionary Movement
takes responsibility for the incident
and threatens continued violence,
administration officials implicate
Iran as a perpetrator in the crisis.
In concert with other Western
leaders, President Reagan
denounces the attack and expresses
grief over "the loss of those splen
did young men and the injury to so
many others."
The president also vows to con
tinue the American military pres
ence in Lebanon. Members of the
multinational peacekeeping force
generally express solidarity with
Reagan's decision not to allow the
bombings to "drive us out of that
area."
In Washington and Beirut, Ameri
can military and foreign policy
leaders debate ways to increase the
safety and effectiveness of the
Marine contingent. Pentagon and
State Department task forces are im
mediately initiated to explore op
tions available to the peacekeeping
force.
Meanwhile in Grenada, the ruling
military council places its armed
forces on alert and mobilizes militia
reserves in preparation for an
"imminent invasion" by the United
States.
The Radio Free Grenada an
nouncement arrives as eastern
Caribbean leaders meet for a
second day of talks in Port of Spain,
Trinidad, to decide on sanctions
against Gen. Hudson Austin and his
16-member council. Austin seized
control of Grenada Wednesday after
the execution of Prime Minister
Maurice Bishop and 16 cabinet
members.
Citing concern for the safety of
nearly 1000 Americans on the island,
administration officials disclose that
10 warships heading for Lebanon

have been diverted to Grenada to
assist in a possible evacuation of
U.S. citizens. The officials add that
two American diplomats are leaving
Barbados for St. George's, the
Grenadian capital, to monitor the
safety of Americans confronted with
the Austin regime.
Monday, Oct. 24
As the American death toll in
Beirut climbs to 191, Reagan admin
istration officials reaffirm commit
ment to keeping U.S. troops in
Lebanon and imply that the Soviet
Union and its surrogates — namely
Syria — will swiftly fill the vacuum if
the multinational force abandons its
mission.
"If we are driven out of Lebanon,
radical and rejectionist elements will
have scored a major victory," Secre
tary of State George Shultz asserts.
"The message will be sent that
relying on the Soviet Union pays off
and that relying on the United States
is a fatal mistake.
"We're all frustrated by the fact
that these terrorists can hit and run
and disappear into the society and
you can't do anything about it,"
Shultz tells reporters as the adminis
tration confronts mounting criticism
from conservative and liberal
leaders questioning the mission of
the Marine contingent.
Shultz also stresses that "the pres
ident was an unhappy and tired man
Sunday night."
In Grenada, rumors of U.S. inva
sion persist. Late Monday night, the
Associated Press says an unknown
number of Marines are heading for
the island, but additional informa
tion is sketchy.
Tuesday, Oct. 25
The invasion of Grenada by 1900
U.S. Marines and Army Rangers
meets "unexpectedly strong" resis
tance from Cuban military person
nel involved with the construction
of new airport.
News reporters are banned from
the island and compelled to quote
administration sources, who note
the deaths of six U.S. servicemen
and the wounding of at least 26
others.
While the administration says 12
Cubans and three Grenadians
perished in the initial assault, the
deputy chief of Grenada's U.N.
delegation claims that "several
hundred people, many of them
civilians, have been killed as a result
of the attack/'
The American troops, with the as
sistance of 300 military personnel
from neighboring Caribbean

countries, capture 30 Soviet advisers
and 600 Cubans. Security at the U.S.
military hast* at Gauntanamo, Cuba,
is beefed up in anticipation of a pos
sible retaliatory move by Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
In the face of mixed reaction na
tionally and worldwide, President
Reagan asserts that the invasion is a
necessary move to rid Grenada of a
"group ot brutal leftist thugs," a ref
erence to last week's coup and ex
ecutions by the Hustin regime.
Reagan stresses that the removal
ot these "thugs" is essential "to
protect innocent lives, to forestall
further chaos and to assist in the res
toration of law and order" in
Grenada. The attack, Reagan con
tinues, is a crucial step "to restore
democracy" on the island.
In Lebanon, workers continue to
dig for bodies as the American death
toll rises to 216. French President
Francois Mitterand visits the disaster
scene and reaffirms France's com
mitment to the multinational force.
Wednesday, Oct. 26
Students are rescued from St.
George's University Medical School
in Grenada, and the Grenadian army
headquarters falls to U.S. invaders.
While Havana claims that Cuban
military action on Grenada has
ended, Washington contends that
U.S. troops are still drawing fire
from isolated pockets of Cuban
resistance.
The first two planes carrying U.S.
citizens from the island land at
Charleston, South Carolina, with
141 passengers aboard.
Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger says six Americans are
dead, 33 wounded and eight missing
in the conflict. And 800 U.S.
paratroopers join the invasion force,
which the administration now says
consists of about ?000 troops.
In Cuba, government officials say
the last remaining Cuban troops
"sacrificed" themselves rather than
surrender to U.S. forces. The Bar
bados state-owned Caribbean
Broadcasting Co. reports that at
least 30 Cubans died in the fight.
Meanwhile, the remains of 219
Americans have been unearthed in
Beirut, and 53 bodies have been
recovered at the French military
compound. Vice President George
Bush visits the scene and other ad
ministration officials admit that defi
cient security at Marine
headquarters contributed to the dis
aster.
Thursday, Oct. 27
Calling Grenada a "Soviet-Cuban

colony" on the brink of exporting
terrorism, President Reagan tells
America that the invaders "got there
just in time."
Reagan's words draw heavy fire
from the United Nations, where the
Security Council votes 11-1 to con
demn the American attack. In the
first Congressional action, the
House Foreign Affairs Committee
votes 32-2 to approve legislation
aimed at applying the War Powers
Act to U.S. military involvement in
Grenada.
As fighting continues on the is
land, Gen. Austin and a small con
tingent continue to hold out against
the U.S. assault.
Reagan administration officials say
they have discovered 1100 Cubans
on Grenada, about 400 more than
previously believed — an indication
that Cuba planned to take complete
control of the island.
In Havana, government officials
announce that Cuba has accepted
an offer from Colombia and Spain to
mediate the return of 638 Cubans
taken into custody in Grenada. Eas
tern Bloc leaders continue to con
demn U.S. actions in the Caribbean
and Lebanon.
While the death toll climbs to 221
in Beirut, backers of the Gemayel
government stage demonstrations
to show support for the multination
al peacekeeping force. President
Reagan says events in Lebanon and
Grenada are linked to Soviet
schemes to promote terrorism
worldwide.

"Can the United States or the free
world, for that matter, stand by and
see the Middle East incorporated
into the Soviet Bloc?" the president
asks in Thursday's nationally
televised address.
