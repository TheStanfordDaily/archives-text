# Collider project begins
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
Construction began yesterday on
the newest addition to the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAQ, a
$113 million subatomic particle col
lider.
The collider will crash electrons
and anti-matter positrons together
at upwards of 100 billion electron
volts to study the nature of matter. It
will be the first such machine ever
built.
The collider is scheduled for com
pletion in 1986. The U.S. Depart
ment of Energy will pick up the $113
million tab for the project. Research
will start at the collider in early 1987.
At ground-breaking ceremonies
yesterday at SLAC, Secretary of En
ergy Donald Hodel said the collider
shows the Reagan administration's
commitment to basic science.
"I believe (and) the President
believes that we see mankind at his
exalted best when we see our pur
suit of knowledge for knowledge's
sake," Hodel said to the more than
300 people who attended the
ground-breaking.
The United States has spent about
$25 billion over 40 years on basic sci
entific research, he said.
But Hodel said record federal
deficits could lead some congress
men to vote against substantial fun
ding of basic science.
"When you have a budget prob
lem, it is routine that funds for sci
entific research are the first thing
that is cut. But we have a pretty
strong commitment from President
Reagan," he said.
Although basic research is not im
mediately profitable, the long-term
benefits of such research to the
United States and the world are con
siderable, Hodel said.
"1 earnestly believe that if vuu
(the researchers who will work at
the collider) do your jobs here,
mankind will benefit in educational
terms and economic terms," he
said.
Wolfgang Panofsky, director of
SLAC, said the collider "is a new
tool which will extend our opportu
nities to do high energy physics re
search." Panofsky said the col
lider has two objectives.
"It has an objective to provide an
additional tool for the scientific
community at large. It also has the
opportunity, the object, of advanc
ing the technology of going to these
very high energies at a considerably
lower cost than was possible,"
Panofsky said.
A beam of electrons and positrons
will be shot through the two-mile
long accelerator. The beam will split
when it reaches the entrance of the
collider, which is made up of two
underground arcs of magnets.
The magnets will guide the
positron and electron beams around
to the collision point. The atomic
particles will create a form of matter
called "Z"s at the rate of thousands
each day when they crash.
Zs carry the weak force, one of
the three subatomic forces that hold
together and interact with sub
atomic particles called quarks and
leptons. Quarks form protons and
neutrons. Leptons are a kind of
electron.
John Rees, director of the collider
project, said study of the weak force
will help scientists test the validity of

theories about the composition of
matter.
"What we're looking for is a few
laws that govern all phenomena,"
Rees said.
Panofsky said the collider will pro
vide data for about 10 years of future
research.
