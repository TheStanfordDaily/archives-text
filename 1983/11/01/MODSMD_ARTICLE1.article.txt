Construction began yesterday on
the newest addition to the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAQ, a
$113 million subatomic particle col
lider.
The collider will crash electrons
and anti-matter positrons together
at upwards of 100 billion electron
volts to study the nature of matter. It
will be the first such machine ever
built.
The collider is scheduled for com
pletion in 1986. The U.S. Depart
ment of Energy will pick up the $113
million tab for the project. Research
will start at the collider in early 1987.
At ground-breaking ceremonies
yesterday at SLAC, Secretary of En
ergy Donald Hodel said the collider
shows the Reagan administration's
commitment to basic science.
"I believe (and) the President
believes that we see mankind at his
exalted best when we see our pur
suit of knowledge for knowledge's
sake," Hodel said to the more than
300 people who attended the
ground-breaking.
The United States has spent about
$25 billion over 40 years on basic sci
entific research, he said.
But Hodel said record federal
deficits could lead some congress
men to vote against substantial fun
ding of basic science.
"When you have a budget prob
lem, it is routine that funds for sci
entific research are the first thing
that is cut. But we have a pretty
strong commitment from President
Reagan," he said.
Although basic research is not im
mediately profitable, the long-term
benefits of such research to the
United States and the world are con
siderable, Hodel said.
