## MBA student's happiness is a javelin's throw away 
### HEIDI MOLBAK 
Being an MBA student at
Stanford may provide enough
work for most people — but
not for Bruce Kennedy.
Besides being a full-time
student, Kennedy is cur
rently ranked among the top
javelin throwers in the nation.
Over the past 14 years, Ken
nedy has been selected to
compete in three Olympic
games — but has yet to do so.
Kennedy, a native of
Rhodesia, first came to the
United States in 1969 to attend
UC-Berkeley. Although he was
still eligible to compete for the
Rhodesian team at the time,
the team was forbidden to
compete in both of the follow
ing games.
In 1972, the first time Ken
nedy was selected, the
Rhodesian team was barred
from competition the day
before the Games opened be
cause of a threatened boycott
by other African countries.
"(It was like) going to a dinner

party and the guy at the door
says sorry, we don't have an
invitation anymore," Kennedy
said. He lost his second
chance to compete four years
later when once again,
Rhodesia was barred from the
games.
Finally in 1980, Kennedy se
cured a spot on the U.S. team,
only to be set back by the U.S.
boycott of the Moscow games.
The irony for Kennedy is
that in 1980, the Rhodesian
team succeeded in attending
the Games.
Despite these setbacks,
Kennedy remained un
daunted. "I think you've got
to put a sport in a perspective;
ifs not the be-all and end-all of
everything," he said.
When the Games were
boycotted, he began to once
again look ahead to his future.
"There comes a point," he
said, "when you're no longer
going to be an athlete. Then
what are you going to do?" He
decided to get his MBA and
end his javelin career.

But he found it difficult to
give up his sport. "I had
retired at the end of '82. I felt
that coming here would be a
great transfer of energies and
focus but I missed the train
ing."
After getting his "core
classes" out of the way last
year, he began to train once
again, this time his goal being
the 1984 Olympics in Los An
geles.
Kennedy said that whether
he makes the team or not is
unimportant. Personal satis
faction is his primary reason
for sticking with his sport.
"My talent is about as obscure
as you can get. I'm not doing it
for money, I'm doing it for
love," he said.
Kennedy said he finds his
sport a challenge because,
"your result is a direct result
of you. That makes you push
harder."
Kennedy has had no prob
lems combining his time as
both a student and an athlete.
Because the work load in the

MBA program is much lighter
in the second year, he only
has four classes this quarter.
Training has just become a
fifth course.
Despite his ambitions in
sports, Kennedy still believes
school is his first priority. He
said he feels that coming to
Stanford is the best thing he's
done for himself in his life.
"There's not this cut-throat
competitiveness. It's more of
a cooperation between stu
dents and a real closeness to
professors. It's ambitious in a
pleasant way," he said.
What comes after his MBA?
"I'm not sure what I want to
do when I grow up," he said.
His interests, however, lie in
non-analytical, people
oriented work.
Kennedy said he realizes
that succeeding in the busi
ness world will be a challenge.
"I'm not going in saying 'no, I
won't make it,' but that 'it's
going to be real hard,' " he
said.

as you can get. I'm not doing it
for money, I'm doing it for
love," he said.
Kennedy said he finds his
sport a challenge because,
"your result is a direct result
of you. That makes you push
harder."
Kennedy has had no prob
lems combining his time as
both a student and an athlete.
Because the work load in the

MBA program is much lighter
in the second year, he only
has four classes this quarter.
Training has just become a
fifth course.
Despite his ambitions in
sports, Kennedy still believes
school is his first priority. He
said he feels that coming to
Stanford is the best thing he's
done for himself in his life.
"There's not this cut-throat
competitiveness. It's more of
a cooperation between stu
dents and a real closeness to
professors. It's ambitious in a
pleasant way," he said.
What comes after his MBA?
"I'm not sure what I want to
do when I grow up," he said.
His interests, however, lie in
non-analytical, people
oriented work.
Kennedy said he realizes
that succeeding in the busi
ness world will be a challenge.
"I'm not going in saying 'no, I
won't make it,' but that 'it's
going to be real hard,' " he
said.
