## The
						Stanford Daily Next move up to Reagan 
### 
Anticipation preceded University President
Donald Kennedy's crucial statement on the
proposed Reagan complex at last Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting. Relief, pleasure and
respect followed.
Kennedy endorsed a Reagan library, contain
ing a modest museum with educational dis
plays, but opposed a center for public affairs
run by the Hoover Institution. His stance is to
be applauded for its basic merits, but maybe
even more importantly for the fact that it
represents what most people on campus seem
to favor.
The University president's opinion concurs
closely with that of the nine-member fa< ilty
committee appointed by Kennedy. The
mendations of that report have been endorsi
implicitly also by the majority of the faculty in
the History Department and the Law Schrol,
and by the ASSU Senate.
A petition being circulated by the student
group Stanford Community Against Reagan
University (SCAReU), whose leaders worry that
any further association with the president may
label Stanford as a conservative institution,
supports the construction of a Reagan library

and opposes a Hoover-run policy center — but
is against any decision made without student
and faculty input.
So it seems there is not a strong body of op
position to the idea of a Reagan library on
campus. And the University group with the
final say — the Board of Trustees — appears
likely to be in favor of it.
The Board Committee on the Hoover Institu
on will report to the trustees at the December
meeting, but not much more is going to be said
until there is word from the White House.
Yet the willingness of officials in the White
House and Hoover to rethink their original
plan and allow a policy center administered
by normal University channels in q jestionable.
If Hoover and the White Hou<- don't relax
their demands, it will be a shame. 1 Jt not such a
big one that the Board of Trustees shoi think of
doing anything different than what » Rosse
committee and Kennedy have suggested. The
possible damage to the University's reputation
as an academic institution by the creation of a
Hoover-administered Reagan policy center is
not worth the risk.
