# Work, study, then what?

What do you want to be when you grow up?
The famous childhood question is thought
about a lot on campus, but these days Univer
sity administrators are urging students to think
about it even more. Their concern is that the
notion of community service, whether full
time, part-time, or volunteer, will be lost
within the scramble for high salaries.
University President Donald Kennedy is
leading the effort to remind students of their
societal obligations, and we applaud him for it.
In his commencement address last June, he
urged graduates to take part in some form of
public service in the near future and through
out their lifetimes. This fall, Kennedy has con
centrated on popularizing public service activi
ties among students while they are at Stanford.
He helped initiate a Community Services Faire
in White Plaza that brought together 30 on
campus service organizations to recruit more
volunteers. Last Friday night at Hoover House,
he honored more than 175 students who were
involved in public service last summer.
Kennedy is not the only one ringing the bell
of community service. Another notable
campus example is Law School Dean John Hart
Ely, who instituted the Public Interest Summer
Loan Program, which enables law students

who hold public interest jobs over the summer
to take out a significant loan, which does not
have to be repaid if they remain in the public
sector after graduation.
Why are these and other educators spending
their time emphasizing public service? Ask stu
dents what kind of jobs they want and why and
you will probably realize the answer. Engineer
ing and economics lead the pack in popularity,
and for many students in these majors the sub
ject matter is not the main reason why they are
there. Business school students and the
majority of law students are flying to the top
consulting, marketing and law firms in the
country for interviews, often without consider
ing other career possibilities.
There is obviously nothing wrong with
careers in business, but what is upsetting is
students going into it blindly or ignoring com
munity service while they are in it. There are
opportunities to serve the public while in the
private sector, to take off some years to do
community service work, or to find a career in
a public or community organization. Economic
considerations make such options harder, but
there is always some opportunity to serve:
right now, in one of the campus service organi
zations for example.
