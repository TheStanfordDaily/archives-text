## Exporting U.S. 'democracy' 
### 
Every great power has had an elaborate mythology to
justify trampling on the rest of the world. Britain
colonized and exploited Africa, southern Asia and the
Caribbean, citing the "white man's burden" of bring
ing civilization and economic development to those
poor starving black and brown people. Never mind that
the only ones who benefited from all this were Britons
at home (particularly the major capitalists) and a hand
ful of collaborators in the colonies.
The American media and government are quite fond
of pointing to another great mythological construct,
that erected by the Soviet Union: the fabulous myth of
"international socialism." Guaranteeing the great ad
vances of Soviet-style socialism has been a perfect jus
tification for sending the Red Army to put down at
tempts by Hungarians and Czechs to gain a degree of
independence. The socialist solidarity myth also is of
prime importance in gaining the approval of the Soviet
populace for these policies.
One myth that we don't read about in our
newspapers — because these newspapers are among
the principal sources of the myth — is the one that
keeps the great-power game going here at home: the
myth 01 "supporting democracy." The latest invocation
of this so-called principle was made in support of last
week's invasion of Grenada. Those who heard President
Reagan's announcement of the invasion by U.S.
Marines got the standard treatment applied whenever
the U.S. decides to trash the uppity natives: We are
strictly interested in "restoring democracy" to a society
in turmoil.
Reagan was very careful this time in announcing that
the invasion — one he has been itching to launch since
he came into office — was being staged in unison with
the other "democracies" of the Caribbean. Note the
key word "democracy," which is to be repeated as fre
quently as possible until it becomes a sort of chant or
mantra. After all, what decent American citizen can
oppose "restoring democracy" to an island in turmoil?
Why, they would have to be communists or some other

sort of venomous creatures!
The recent Grenadian cou may have brought to
power some perfectly miserable people, but that h a
nothing to do with the U.S. invasion (soon to pass ii >
our official history as another "peacekeeping" mis
sion). The invasion was the 'ogical outcome of j >at
power paranoia and, in the context of history, wu al
most inevitable. Readers may recall that shortly „ er
Reagan came into office, the American public was in
undated with several "White Papers" on the civil wars
rocking Central America. As part of that public relations
campaign, designed to win support for further inter
vention in Central America, the President made much
ado about a new airport being built on Grenada. Some
how, this airport became, in the eyes of Reagan and his
advisers, a "security threat" to the United States. Why?
Because Grenada had a socialist government and was
on friendly terms with Cuba, who was assisting in the
construction of the airport.
The coup in Grenad was strictly a pretext for the
U.S. invasion. "Restoration of democracy" had nothing
to do with it. Restoration of Grenada into the U.S.
sphere of influence had everything to do with it.
We can be fairly confident in predicting the course ot
events in Grenada. The first thing the United States will do
after invading will be to set up a provisional government
headed by people who had been connected with the
British colonial government — hardly socialists.
Much ado was made by Reagan about having elections,
the standard media fare whenever the U.S. intervenes;
observe how U.S.-sponsored massacres in Nicaragua
are supposed to encourage the Sandinistas to "hold
elections." Keeping socialists out of power and further
ing the penetration of American capital will become the
primary jobs of whatever puppets are installed in
power on Grenada.
Too bad for all you folks on Grenada — you should
know better than to disobey your benevo/enf Uncle
Sam. Now he has to teach you a lesson.
