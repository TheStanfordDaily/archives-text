# United States is defending its principles in Grenada
## 
### 
As the television camera has
taught the 20th century, enthusiasm
for war is produced only by a mind
warped or naive. As unenthusiasti
cally as is imaginable — in an atmo
sphere of resignation and compel
ling desire to finish and leave —
U.S. troops were sent to the Carib
bean last week, meeting pockets of
resistance from the predictable
domestic corners, some here on
campus.
The ultra-liberal, in their distaste
for U S. military activity abroad, are
again serving up words which were
once proudly indignant and
seductive: . . NO RIGHT to
meddle in the affairs of other
countries. . . These claims of the
critics now sound shrill and hollow,
shrinking in significance as each cat
egory — diplomatic, strategic and
moral — falls under and passes the
gaze of a press hungry for wrong
doing.
"Grenada is tiny, and we are
huge." Quite true, and precisely the
reason for which the Organization
of Eastern Caribbean States, half of
which have no military at all, turned
to us. Columnist and Caribbean cor
respondent Georgie Anne Geyer
found heads of the concerned states
unanimously convinced that the
entire archipelago could have easily
collapsed in a chain — yes, like
dominoes. Oust one consideration
were the Cuban troops which Geyer
flatly said were being trained for that
purpose, in conjunction with new
Russian broadcasts over the other
six islands, urging rebellion.) The
Daily editorial board found
the OECS treaty explicitly calling for
this type of collective security mea
sure "little-known," thus insig
nificant. After all, they had never
heard of it.
As for the reported rash of con
demnations, the British have calmed
with the healing of post-imperial
pride, and more importantly the Or
ganization of American States
passed a condemnation by a margin
of only one vote. Geyer also found
the condemning "higher-ups" only
"cool" toward the invasion — off
the record, liftle mention was given
by The Daily board of those
corners" of the world — Australia,
Spain and |apan, for instance —
which endorsed the move.

Those claiming the U.S. medical
student-, on the island were not in
danger iave news for the students,
who were on front pages across
America (but not here) kissing U.S.
runway ground and saying things
outrage*" sfc ost-Vi otnam, col
legiate tongjes. I don't think there
is any more be. itiful s'ght than
being back in the U.S., or perhaps
seeing the Rangers arrive to save
us"; "Until I got here, I would have
pooh-poohed this sort of thing, but
the Soviet-Cuban influence really
existed"; and surely the most dis
tressing of all for the Left, "We are
very, very proud to be part of this
nation." Critics who do not want to
believe intelligence reports of
Cuban hostage plans simply,
reasonlessly, do not. Pooh-pooh.
It is true that strategic reasons
were most likely beneath the deci
sion to remove the Cubans, but is it
not advisable — indeed, rare, even
with the Reagan administration —
for the U.S. to act swiftly in strategic
affairs? Only the imbecile will con
tend that the island's Cuban
dominance was just, preferable or
innocuous, or apologize for the 33
Soviet embassy officials (the U.S.
equivalent would be 77,000 Soviets)
and the battalion of Cuban troops. If
the construction of a military cargo
length runway by Cuban soldiers is
so harmless, then what of the
Grenadian position as a transfer
spot for Soviet arms shipments to
Latin America or a perch for swift
control of Caribbean trade routes?
Indeed, on arrival, the Rangers
found, as one reporter put it, "all
the evidence (of Soviet-Cuban stra
tegic expansion) Reagan could have
prayed for": heavy combat and
guerrilla weaponry for 8000 to 10,000
persons, enough for "years." Said
one lieutenant colonel, "I spent
years in Vietnam hunting for arms
caches, and I never saw anything
like this." Just who is conducting
the meddlesome offensive in the af
fairs of whose country?
So, then, is the strategy wise? Ap
parently so: One Eastern Caribbean
prime minister was quoted as con
sidering this the biggest setback to
Castro since the onset of his revolu
tion. The Caribbean Basin and
Castro (ould stand a few more such
setbacks.

And what of the Grenadians, who
have self-appointed spokespersons
here saying quite the opposite of
the inhabitants themselves?
"We felt so sorry for the
p iple. . ." one U.S. medical stu
dent was quoted as saying. "They

wanted to get rid of (the Cubans)
but the radio kept telling them to
defend their country. After a few
hours, most of them put down their
guns." Still again, jeering in
habitants were reportedly held back
Saturday by U.S. Marines after they
led troops to the hiding place of the

man considered by the U.S. to be
the father of the bloody coup two
weeks ago. Allistair Hughes, said to
be "generally regarded as the most
respected journalist on the isiand"
said upon his rescue from house ar
rest, "Than'; God the, came. If
someone had not come in and done

something, I hesitate to say what the
situation in Grenada would be." Yet
someone did, and the Crenadians
have thanks to offer for it.
The hols of succes abounr
The students are exultant, safe and
grateful, j Grena . itizenry
soon to re-discover seh
government, freedom in the Easter
Caribbean is secure for now, and
the U.S. has been shaken from the
paralysis of Vietnam in preventing
the development of another major
local Soviet and Cuban stronghold
at its elbow. The decisive losers, for
once, are the local Left and the
Cubans and Soviets, having taken
with them in defeat the lives from
the bodies that arrived Saturday at
the military mortuary in Dover, Del
aware.
It is in the vie»v ot that grim row of
flag-draped coffins that Americans
can feel the truth in the words of the
Marine commander from the
memorial service: "If America is to
be the land of the free, it must
remain the home of the brave."
