## Card faces 1-13 San Diego 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
Coming off one of the biggest soccer vic
tories in years, the Cardinal flys south to meet
San Diego today at 3 p.m.
Stanford must be careful not to suffer a let
down which often occurs after a major upset
like the victory over No. 8 UC-Berkeley last
112 riday. "I've seen it where we've turned an up
set in one game and lost to a no-name the next
game," said Stanford Coach Nelson Lodge ear
lier in the season.
A Stanford victory is a must if it is to make to
PacTic Soccer Conference playoffs. If Stanford
does not win the rest of its games, its playoff
hopes will be slim.
Usually a weaker team is able to play for a tie
witn no trouble at all. And San Diego can prob
ably be considered weak since it is currently
sporting a 1-13 record for the season.
San Diego's defense is not to be overlooked
and might be able to stop an overconfident
Stanford offense. "When they (San Diego) play
well, they are defensively superb," said San
Diego Coach Seamus McFadden. "The only
problem is we don't play that well very often."
One of the strengths San Diego has going for
it is Bo Kaemerle who has tallied seven goals

and one assist. He is backed by a defensive star
Louis Zeli, a "spark plug" in the words of
McFadden.
But San Diego's main strength is the coach
ing of Seamus McFadden, who is an Irish im
migrant.
Once a high school coach in Los Angeles, he
led two teams to CIF championships and
moved up to the collegiate level because of his
talent to win.
He has had a harder time in San Diego,
though. McFadden, who is an excellent judge
of talent, complained, "We just aren't getting
the players."
McFadden would know what good talent is
since he played professional soccer in both
Ireland and the United States.
As a young man growing up in Ireland,
McFadden used to collect potatoes from his
family's garden and used to kick the rotten
ones over the fence.
"We used to juggle them for awhile and
them boot them away," McFadden said. "I got
quite good at it, too."
Unfortunately for San Diego, it has not had
the talent of one like McFadden on the field
and as a result has not played well this season.
