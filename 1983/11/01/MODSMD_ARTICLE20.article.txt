# Swimmers look to big year

The Cardinal men's swim
team is looking more powerful
than ever in the early going,
with a promise of continued
excellence throughout the
1983-84 season.
"We've won the Pac-10
championship two years in a
row now," said Head Coach
Skip Kenney, "and we also
had our first undefeated
season last year. These previ
ous goals aren't all that impor

tant to us anymore. We're
concentrating on winning an
NCAA championship."
The only opportunity to see
the men in dual competition
this,quarter will be when Stan
ford hosts rival Texas Nov. 18.
Stanford has a tremendous
amount of talent. This year's
freshman class — the fourth
class assembled by Kenney —
has promise of being the
strongest ever. "There has
been an inspiring amount of

leadership and energy from
the new class this year which
has contributed to a higher
level of intensity in practices,"
he noted.
Leading this new addition to
the team are Pan American
Games medalists Jeff Kostoff
and Pablo Morales, with sig
nificant contributions ex
pected from Dave Louden and
Sam McAdam. The upperclas
smen are highlighted by Pan

Am medalists John Moffet and
Dave Bottom, along with, ac
cording to Kenney, "about a
dozen guys who are training
seriously for a spot on the U.S.
Olympic team."
This substantial number of
dedicated swimmers seems to
have propogated a wave of
"Olympic fever" at DeGuerre
pool. A large sign outside the
main gate at DeGuerre dis
plays the home meet schedule
while offerinp the spectator a
"Preview of Olympic Swim
ming."
Kenney feels this emphasis
is very much needed because
"the entire sport of swimming
was hurt by the 1980 U.S.
Olympic boycott. What we're
trying to do here at Stanford is
to remind people that swim
ming is a very exciting Olym
pic sport."

The Stanford men's swim team practices for its only dual meet this quarter, a Nov. 18
date with rival Texas at DeGuerre Pool. The Card, the defending Pacific-10 Conference
champion, hope to improve on its fourth place finish in the NCAAs last year.
