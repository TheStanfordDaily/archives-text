# Runners take 4th in Pac-10s
## 
### RICK BILODEAU 
The Arizona Wildcats,
with possibly their
strongest cross country
team ever, placed five run
ners in the top 11 to win the
Pacific-10 Conference title
yesterday at the Stanford
Golf Course. Stanford
finished fourth.
Arizona squeaked by
defending champion
Oregon 38-43 in what could
be considered a mild upset.
Individually, however,
Oregon's Jim Hill easily
outran the field to capture
his second straight confer
ence crown.
Following Arizona and
Oregon in third place was
UCLA, which edged Stan
ford from the third position
by the narrow margin of 74-
80. UC- Berkeley finished
fifth with 126 points.
The Cardinal showed
some improvement over
last year by taking fourth
and putting two runners in
the top 10. Senior Jim Smith
led the way by finishing
fourth in the individual
competition.
Nonetheless, Smith was
not completely satisfied. "I
really wanted to catch the
guy in second, but I started
to tire at about the five mile
mark," he said. "I'm a little
disappointed."
Also in the top ten for
Stanford was freshman
Marc Olsen, who raised
some eyebrows with his
seventh-place finish although
he was the youngest runner
in the race.
Farther back for the Card
were Charles Alexander in
20th, Jeff Atkinson in 22nd

and Ryan Stoll in 28th. Also
running for Stanford but
not scoring were Ed Cal
loway in 35th and David
Frank in 38th.
Overall, Stanford Coach
Brooks Johnson had mixed
emotions about his team's
performance. "Our top
two or three ran well, but
after that we got into some
difficulties," he said.
"We're making progress,
though."
Progress will be neces
sary if the Card hopes to
advance to the NCAA
Championships in Lehigh,
Pa., later this month. On
Nov. 12, Stanford will have

a chance to run against
many of the Pac-10 squads
it faced yesterday in the dis
trict meet at Corvallis, Ore.
Oregon's Hill was the
highlight of the race as he
took the lead quickly and
left the field behind. He
covered the rolling 10,000-
meter course in 30:09:6,
winning by a hefty margin
of 22 seconds and some 150
yards.
Although the individual
competition was decided
early and easily by Hill, the
battle for the team title was
nip and tuck.
Halfway through the
race, three teams —

Oregon, Arizona and Stan
ford — dominated the top
20 places with a UCLA pack
running farther back. As
the runners headed
through miles four and
five, the Card pack began
to break up while the
Wildcat group stayed intact
and clawed its way into the
top 10.
Though Oregon runners
were in first and second,
Arizona had placed four
harriers between the
Ducks' second and third
runners, a strategy which
turned out to be the key to
the Wildcat victory.

fourth in the Pacific-10 Conference Championships.
