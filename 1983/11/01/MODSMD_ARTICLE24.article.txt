## 'Dan ton' enlivens crazy epoch 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
After the debacle of The Moon in the Gutter,
it's a pleasure to watch Gerard Depardieu in
Danton. Depardieu is an extraordinarily in
stinctual actor, but his performance in The
Moon in the Gutter consisted of a series of
poses suggested by every restless young Hol
lywood actor from |ohn Garfield to lames
Dean, presented seriously. The director, )ean
lacques Beinix, blocked the flow of Depar
dieu s impulses: He continued to take the
i amera wonderfully but he acted like a corpse.
As the French Revolutionary leader whose
last days Danton chronicles, Depardieu looks
more alive than he has in any role since the
well-intentioned, blundering husband in Get
Out Your Handkerchiefs, and he has so much
wit and personality that no one else on screen
is a match tor him. His Danton is a sensualist
and a star — he knows he enjoys the idolatry of
the Parisians and he plays up to them as well as
playing hard-to-get with them. He has the savvy
of a celebrity. Depardieu has said that he used
Muhammad Ali as a role model for some of
Danton's flourishes, and (as usual) his instincts
served him well — Danton is a champion, even
in defeat (i.e., under the guillotine). The last
words he speaks to the crowd are hushed, be
cause davs of shouted oratory at his trial have
made him hoarse; he exhibits his laryngitis like
a battle scar.
Danton, directed by the Polish filmmaker
Andrzej Wajda and written by )ean-Claude Car
riere and others (based on Stanislawa Prsybvs
zewska's play L'Affaire Danton), is a vigorous
historical spectacle that gives the constant im
pression ot forward motion. Characters and
events are drawn in bold strokes, so that we
have no trouble determining the issues or in
terpreting which side the film is on: A humanis
tic treatment of the French Revolution, it con
demns the Reign of Terror unequivocally.
(Apparently Wajda's unsympathetic depiction
of the revolution caused a stir when the film
premiered in Paris.) Except for Depardieu, the
ictors — including two directors, Patrice
Chereau and Roger Planchon, who are among
tht luminaries of the Parisian — work as
expert caricaturists. Whatever you may think of
their aggressive, emblematic performances,
you can tell the characters apart: nervous,
morally ngid Philippeaux; wide-eyed
who speaks rousingly in the Con
vention in Danton's defense the editor Des

moulins, who squints and buries his anger in
his compulsive writing; Fouquier, the head of
the People's Tribunal, with his aristocratic
mien. And of course Robespierre (Wojcieck
Pszoniak), Danton's opposite number and
nemesis, who denies himself physical
pleasures and, on the morning ot Danton's ex
ecution, looks more drained of life than his
enemy's trunkless head.
When you see the riots in the Convention,
the speakers shouting the crowd to silence and
twisting their faces into hilarious grimaces, the
tactions whispering urgently to each other in
the corridors, where of course their foes can
easily overhear them, you think, "What an
amazing, crazy epoch!" Wajda's passionate
sweep and his recognition of the farcical ele
ment embedded in any grand gesture may not
add up to great historv, hut they are a welcome
relief from the usual cautious approach taken
bv the makers of historical epics. In the courtly,
boring la Nuit de Varennes, set in the same
period, the actors could barely summon up
enough energy to change costumes, and in last
\ear's scandalously beribboned Gandhi, his
torical events were shunted off into the corners
ot the film — as if to actually enjoy the story
would have been a crass self-indulgence in the
midst of all this spirituality. Unlike
Robespierre, Wajda is no ascetic. In Danton,
vou keep vour eves open and you laugh right
out loud.
