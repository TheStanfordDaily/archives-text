# 'The Grass House' flimsy, opaque

### MIKE HALE 
Calitornian \dele Edling Shank claims
that her latent play, The Grass House
(currently being given its world premiere
at the Magic heat re), grew out ot her in
terest in "the desire in some to escape to
the simpler life of 19th-century
(California) pioneers." But something ap
pears to have been lost between concept
and product - the play as we have it
deals with the California past in the most
i ursory and c Itched manner. And as if this
weren't frustrating enough, the subject
she does end up focusing on — the im
mediate of various individual
Californians is an empty one, because
as we all know tor as this play seems to in
dicate) , Californians don't have pasts.
The Grass House doesn't really seem to
be about anything; it's an assemblage of
currently fashionable motifs: marijuana
farmers, marriage and babies, ritual,
shamans (preferably female ones) and
whores with hearts of gold, the whole
thing held together by what used to be
Marin jokes but now can just as well be
Mendocino or Humboldt jokes. In an oc
tagonal redwood house on a pot farm
somewhere in northern California, a
small group has gathered for a wedding:
the call girl/mother of the bride and her
man-hating iperhaps lesbian) com
panion; the bride's father, a strait-laced
judge whom she has never met (and who
thinks that the mother works for an insur
ance firm); the groom's brother, the
agriculturalist, who hates the city and
desperately wants a baby, and his
"woman" (he introduces her by saying
"This here's my woman"), who wants to
go to Guadalajara and lie on the beach.
If this sounds suspiciously like soap
opera — As the Grass Dries, perhaps —
you're on the right track. The characters
are ciphers; they exist only as vehicles for
crises (mellow crises, to be sure). At the
end of the play, as the young couple
climbs into the wedding bed, we are left
with the sentimental satisfaction of
knowing that they've learned something
from the mistakes of their elders. We, un
fortunately, don't learn anything new.
The thinness of the characters may
have something to do with the fact that
this is part of a series of "California
plays. Several of the characters are
carried over from Sand Castles, Shank's
last play, and perhaps too much knowl
edge is assumed on the part of the audi

ence. But I think there's a more basic
problem than this: Shank doesn't appear
to like her characters. Not only are they
inturiatingly opaque — even the charac
ters new to her oeuvre are the merest
sketches ot people, with no detail to grab
onto — but they are constantly made to
look absurd, in a play that is otherwise
scrupulously realistic. The most
egregious example, perhaps, is Naomi,
the woman ot the farmhouse, who con
stantly draws our sympathy because she
seems to be the only sensible character
on stage; but we're not allowed to like
her, because in between her sensible
comments she spouts howling mel
lowisms about "centers" and so forth,
and brews everyone raspberry root tea,
and talks about the beaches in
Guadalajara, a city 150 miles trom the
ocean.
Shank is a good writer, and her charac
ters trite, melodramatic problems are art
fully presented, in dialogue that might be
believable were it more forcefully pre
sented. The performances the night I saw
The Grass House were decidedly under

par tor the Magic Theatre; only Elizabeth
Pearson, a* Naomi, seemed to know what
she was about. It was probably the play's,
or the director's, fault, more than the ac
tors'; Paul Drake, a fine actor, was com
pletely unconvincing as Ben the pot
farmer — having been given a caricature
to play, all he could do was bluster about
the stage.
Much ot the play had a faint echo built
into it — as if the lines were taken from
bad pop songs — and I think Shank prob
ably meant this as an ironic, distancing
device. But as directed by Shank's hus
band, Theodore, any possibility of irony
in the production is lost. Everything is
played perfectly straight, and lines that
cry out for some sort of self
consciousness on the part of the actor, or
some sort of stylization, are delivered like
the most casual small talk. Maybe Shank
thinks this is the way northern Calitor
nians really talk. If she's right, then the
play probably has value as a sociological
document, but it's not going to convince
anyone to move.
