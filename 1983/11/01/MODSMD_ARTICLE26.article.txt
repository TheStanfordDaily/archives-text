# 'Right Stuff' makes right moves
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
There are pleasures to be
derived from a movie that
pursues a single vision, and an
entirely different set of
pleasures in a movie that tries
to do so many things at once
that it's bursting at the seams.
In The Right Stuff, Philip
Kaufman has three or four vi
sions — too many for even a
three-and-a-quarter-hour $27
million enterprise to bear, es
pecially since they often con
tradict each other. But this
movie, which Kaufman him
self adapted from Tom
Wolfe's celebrated comic
chronicle of America's partici
pation in the space race in the
late 1950s and early 19605, is
deliriously entertaining.
It has such an eccentric tem
perament that while you're
watching it and trying to keep
track of the lightning shifts in
tone, you realize that there's
never been a comparable
American movie of its size and
(commercial) stature. The
season's most eagerly an
ticipated release turns out to
be a madcap epic.
In the only extended (i.e.,
novel-length) example thus far
of his deliberately purplish,
pop-hyperbolic New jour
nalist's style, Tom Wolfe
defined the ethic and motivat
ing force of the last American
heroes, the astronauts. "The
right stuff" is a peculiarly
American strain of machismo:
It consists of a combination of
excellence, courage, over
weening ambition, extreme
competitiveness and polar
cool.
Several of the astronauts
(Gordon "Gordo" Cooper,
Gus Grissom, Deke Slayton)
had been test pilots at Ed
wards Air Force Base in South
ern California, taking up
fighter planes at incredible,
dangerous speeds; Wolfe

locates the origin of "the right
stuff" in Chuck Yeager, the
unsurpassable ace among the
Edwards pilots who — back in
1947, when Edwards was
called Muroc — had broken
the sound barrier. (In what
Wolfe calls the pilots'
"amputated language," this is
called achieving "Mach 1.")
Kaufman uses Yeager as a
framing device for the movie,
beginning with the historic
1947 flight (which the Air Force
kept unpublicized at the time
for vague "security reasons")
and ending — almost — with
his near-fatal attempt to break
the existing speed record in
1963 in an NF 104, the last first
rate plane ever tested at Ed
wards. Caleb Deschanel has
shot the early Yeager scenes in
an extraordinary blend of
florid and muted colors, so
that they look like Hollywood
Technicolor specials from the
late '40s now yellowing with
age, and Kaufman has given
them the tone of a tongue-in
cheek tall tale.
The opening narration,
delivered in his down-home
drawl by Levon Helm (who
also plays Yeager's engineer,
Jack Ridley), tells of the
"demon" living behind the
sound barrier, and of the great
rocket plane, the X-1: "They
came to the desert of Califor
nia to ride it. They were called
test pilots — and nobody
knew their names." As apot
heosis of this breed, Yeager is
equated in Kaufman's scheme
with the westerner: He's long
and tall, he rides a horse and
hangs out in a pilot's bar
called Pancho's that in spirit
harkens back to the days of
the Old West saloons, and
he's played (impeccably) by
Sam Shepard, who has a clas
sically handsome American
face — he's in the Gary
Cooper-|ohn Wayne mold.

(Those familiar with Shepard's
own plays, which usually deal
with the western myth on
some level, may appreciate his
performance even more.)
Kaufman scores points for
taking the "right stuff" ethic
even farther back than Wolfe
does, tying it in with our
Hollywood-nurtured notion of
the western hero. It makes
perfect sense, especially con
sidering that many of the
astronauts are western-born,
and Wolfe has a very funny
passage in his book about the
way airline pilots strive to im
itate Yeager's vocal patterns.
(There's also a scene, much
later, at a gargantuan bar
becue in honor of the
astronauts hosted by Vice
President Lyndon Johnson
inside the Houston
Astrodome.) And despite the
inappropriate affectations of
Kim Stanley as Pancho and
Barbara Hershey as Yeager's
wife Glennis, these opening
scenes work brilliantly: They
have a wonderful mock
mythic quality, and the combi
nation of the distinctive pho
tography (some of it in black
and white) and the odd, self
conscious staging results in a
weird, hybrid look — Walker
Evans crossed with Maxfield
Parrish. Yeager's first
encounter with the X-1 — he's
on horseback, and the plane
breathes fire like some fairy
tale monster — is a glorious
comic moment.
The Edwards scenes don't
bear much resemblance to
anything else in the movie.
Once Kaufman moves onto Al
buquerque (where the pool of
potential astronauts as
sembles to undergo a series of
humiliating medical examina
tions), Washington and Cape
Canaveral, he mostly ap
proximates Wolfe's hyped-up
ironic style.

The best of these sequences
iemonstrates "the right stuff"
n enormously clever, tremen-
Jously enjoyable ways, like
he one in which a nurse tests
he lungs of the astronaut can
didates by having them blow
nto test tubes containing
ightweight balls; as long as a
nan's breath hold 1 out, the
:>alls will stay afloat The men
a/ith "the right stuff"
Gordo Cooper (Dennis
Quaid), who affects a don't
'ive-a-damn pose, his chin
>unk practically down on the
table and one eye closed, and
|ohn Glenn (Ed H.irris) and
Scott Carpenter (Charles
Frank), who congratulate each
other on their fine perfor
mances — attack this test as if
it were a championship tennis
or handball match, psyching
each other out and working
up strategies.
Kaufman takes parody so far
in this movie that every time
he gets away with a particu
larly wild idea — like having a
White House staffer (Jeff
Goldblum, in a hairstyle aspir
ing to Eraserhead's) race
through the halls in a mad,
surreal whirl to announce the
latest Soviet space launches —
you want to cheer. The White
House scenes appear to have
started from a different point
than the rest of the film —
from Dr. Strangelove, I would
say. Goldblum and Harry
Shearer, whose job it is to
recruit the astronauts, show
President Dwight Eisenhower
(Robert Beer) and then-
Senator Johnson (Donald Mof
fat, in a rather thin improvisa
tion) newsreels of possible
candidates: surfers, acrobats,
fire swallowers, human can
nonballs. Whenever
Goldblum and Shearer show
up, we know we're in tor a low
good time: They dig out some
of the most archaic vaudeville
tricks in the book, like don
ning each other's jackets
(Goldblum is a good half-toot
taller than Shearer) and trying
to talk while suttering from
seasickness. You can't believe
these gags are in the same
movie as the satiricially over
scaled Yeager scenes or the
subversive comic strip White
House scenes, or that this
lunatic patchwork works as
welt as it does.
The center of The Right Stuff
is in the scenes involving the
seven astronauts, of course,
and here Kaufman runs into
trouble. In the book, Wolfe
retains his ironic distance to
these men straight through, so
that while he clearly admires
them, he doesn't imperil his
status as detached commen
tator on their ascension to the
top of what he alternately calls
the "pyramid" and the
"ziggurat."
But Kaufman tries to have it
both ways: He wants to kid
the pants off these guys but he
also wants to share in the thrill
of their heroic exploits. Con
sequently the movie un
dergoes some very bizarre al
terations in tone. When the
astronauts vote to present a
united front to NASA and the
American public and, now as
Life Magazine-covered
celebrities and no longer "lab
rabbits," begin to take com
mand, Kaufman engineers
their victory over the
bureaucrats so that we'll ap
plaud them, and then fails to
step back and comment on
the way we too have been
caught up in the idolatry.
When )ohn Glenn makes his

flight, a heavenly choir sings
and below half a dozen
Aborigines execute a ritual
dance — and suddenly we're
in the mystical realm of 2007: A
Space Odyssey and Peter
Weir's The Last Wave. (David
Gulpilil and Wandjuk Marika,
two of the Aboriginal actors,
actually appeared in The Last
Wave.) And the Houston
Astrodome sequence is the
damnedest thing: All traces of
satire fade, despite the rich
possibilities for it, and when
an aging Sally Rand (Peggy
Davis) performs her famous
fan dance on a stage that looks
like it could house most of
NASA, the meticulous, cathe
dral lighting and the deeply —
spiritually — contented looks
on the faces of the astronauts
and their wives betray a
reverential awe that smacks
rudely up against the extrava
gant jokiness of most of the
rest of the film.
There are other bum mo
ments, too — Gordo Cooper's
nostalgic tribute to the
greatest pilot he ever saw
(Yeager, of course, though
Cooper doesn't mention him
by name), Glennis Yeager's
speech about the terrors of
being a test pilot's wife — that
point straight to the movie's
divided heart.
No movie since Nashville
has gathered together such a
fantastic cast, and Kaufman
must have written the
screenplay with these actors in
mind, because he provides
great roles for the best of
them. As Alan Shepard, Scott
Glenn (who played the coach
in Personal Best) employs
every muscle in that leathery,
Marine-tough face for comic
purposes, and his drum-tight,
pop-up timing is so fiercely
original that it's always
surprising. Fred Ward (of
Southern Comfort), with his
deep-cellar voice, makes Gus
Grissom's "gus gruffisms"
really bristle, and his big scene
— the disastrous splashdown
that explodes his capsule
hatch and nearly drowns him
— is a model of tension and
economy. As his wife Betty,
Veronica Cartwright (a veteran
of Kaufman's marvelous Inva
sion of the Body Snatchers)
first appears in spit curls and
exudes a joyous, life-loving
spirit with a keen inside edge.
Though her role climaxes in

the movie's worst written
scene (in which she and Gus
weep over the way NASA and
the White House have treated
them), she gives a crackling
performance.
Ed Harris, whose ail-
American face is put to dis
tinctly different uses in Under
Fire, gets )ohn Glenn's
double-pronged appeal —
that declarative openness that
also operates as salesmanship
— and he has an amazing
smile, so broad and irresistible
that you're afraid it'll swallow
you up. In his scenes with
Mary Jo Deschanel (the
cinematographer's wife) as
Annie Glenn, he has a patient
tenderness that somehow
mysteriously dovetails right
into his public persona. (He
uses the same open smile with
her, too, but it means someth
ing different, more private.)
Harris doesn't violate the John
Glenn enigma, but he makes it
playable, and Mary Jo Des
chanel, who looks like a cross
between Teresa Wright and
Carolyn Jones, gives a warm,
charming performance as
Annie. (I've never seen
anyone do more creative
things with a stutter.)

Dennis Quaid, as Gordo
Cooper, contributes his
relaxed presence and that
sleepy, crinkled grin; he's so
lazily delightful that you may
have to strain to remember
how good he's been in taut
roles, too (like the restless ball
player, Mike, in Breaking
Away). As his wife Trudy,
Pamela Reed (who played Paul
Le Mat's second wife in Melvin
and Howard) registers delicate
emotional nuances in that
slightly overdeveloped baby
face, and she and Quaid un
derplay the Coopers' difficult
relationship brilliantly.
The casting of so many ter
rific, little-known actors is one
of Kaufman's major coups in
The Right Stuff, and one of the
film's many unconventional
qualities. Another is the way in
which Kaufman restrains him
self in the space flight scenes.
He resists the temptation to
make the movie a spectacle;
the only really sensuous flight
is Veager's final one. This
represents a kind of integrity, I
think — a refusal to turn The
Right Stuff into a picture in
anyone else's league. He in
sists on coming up with a
cockeyed original.
