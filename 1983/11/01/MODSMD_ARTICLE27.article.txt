Help!
Richard Lunch does it. A Dam
Good Man does it. Jabba the Grieve
does it. Mr. EEEEEEEEid does it. The
Chief does it â€” but only occasion
ally. And Heather does it ... by her
self! All of these people have writ
ten stories for The Daily. And as
mid-terms descend, all of the writ
ers who think they should be study
ing for these tests should come in
and take a story so Kay-Oh and Jay-
Bee don't have to do it.
Donald Who?
A famous university president
known for his soliloquies on trifling
subjects like biology, food, drugs
and the location of a presidential li
brary will speak at a staff lunch this
Thursday. This one will be on the
record and The Chief promises to
buy tomatoes and lettuce for those
of us who don't care for dead cow
flesh.
