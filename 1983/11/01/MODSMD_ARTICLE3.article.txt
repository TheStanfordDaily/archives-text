# Male profs still far outnumber female faculty

At Stanford, female students have
the opportunity to pursue careers in
what until recently were considered
"male" fields. But they still have to
learn from an almost entirely male
faculty.
The statistics: Out of 1266 faculty
members here, only 118 are women.
At the end of last year, 785 men, but
only 48 women, had tenure. The fac
ulty of some departments, such as
Humanities, is over one-third wo
men; other areas of the University,
such as the School of Business, have
only one woman in a faculty of 67.
Why are there so few women
teachers? Administrators and female
faculty members disagree. Some say
the problem lies in the tenure sys
tem here — women realize they
have little or no chance of getting a
tenured position and choose to
work at an institution where the
chances for advancement are better.
Others say the problem lies not at
the tenure level, but at the appoint
ment level.
"We don't have such a problem
tenuring women — we're just not
hiring them," said Barbara Babcock,
a tenured professor at the Law
School. Babcock was the first wo
man hired in her department and
the first woman to receive tenure
there.
"When I was first hired, I was the
only woman here," Babcock said,
"and the department took the atti
tude of, 'Well, now we've got one.' I
think my department has changed
its outlook substantially in the past
10 years, but I don't think some
departments have come very far."
Babcock explained that the dearth
of female faculty members creates a
sort of Catch-22 situation. "Women

look for a supportive atmosphere
where they work," she said, "and
when they see how few women
there are at Stanford they wonder
about the working conditions for
women here. If they have a choice,
they'll probably look elsewhere —
and Stanford is only interested in
faculty members who have a
choice."

One possible solution, Babcock
said, is to "tip the scales" with af
firmative action until there is some
equity in hiring. "If a department is
considering a man and a woman
who are both equally qualified, they
really should hire the woman," she
said. "It's basically the same tactic
that a minority college admissions
program follows — we have to
create a better atmosphere."
However, not everyone believes
in the effectiveness of affirmative ac
tion. "A.A. really has no power at
Stanford," said Bella Mody, an assis
tant professor in communications
who was recently denied tenure
here. The staff of the Affirmative Ac
tion Office is "■very well
