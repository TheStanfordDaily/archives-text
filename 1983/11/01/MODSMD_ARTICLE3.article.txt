# Male profs still far outnumber female faculty
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
At Stanford, female students have
the opportunity to pursue careers in
what until recently were considered
"male" fields. But they still have to
learn from an almost entirely male
faculty.
The statistics: Out of 1266 faculty
members here, only 118 are women.
At the end of last year, 785 men, but
only 48 women, had tenure. The fac
ulty of some departments, such as
Humanities, is over one-third wo
men; other areas of the University,
such as the School of Business, have
only one woman in a faculty of 67.
Why are there so few women
teachers? Administrators and female
faculty members disagree. Some say
the problem lies in the tenure sys
tem here — women realize they
have little or no chance of getting a
tenured position and choose to
work at an institution where the
chances for advancement are better.
Others say the problem lies not at
the tenure level, but at the appoint
ment level.
"We don't have such a problem
tenuring women — we're just not
hiring them," said Barbara Babcock,
a tenured professor at the Law
School. Babcock was the first wo
man hired in her department and
the first woman to receive tenure
there.
"When I was first hired, I was the
only woman here," Babcock said,
"and the department took the atti
tude of, 'Well, now we've got one.' I
think my department has changed
its outlook substantially in the past
10 years, but I don't think some
departments have come very far."
Babcock explained that the dearth
of female faculty members creates a
sort of Catch-22 situation. "Women

look for a supportive atmosphere
where they work," she said, "and
when they see how few women
there are at Stanford they wonder
about the working conditions for
women here. If they have a choice,
they'll probably look elsewhere —
and Stanford is only interested in
faculty members who have a
choice."

One possible solution, Babcock
said, is to "tip the scales" with af
firmative action until there is some
equity in hiring. "If a department is
considering a man and a woman
who are both equally qualified, they
really should hire the woman," she
said. "It's basically the same tactic
that a minority college admissions
program follows — we have to
create a better atmosphere."
However, not everyone believes
in the effectiveness of affirmative ac
tion. "A.A. really has no power at
Stanford," said Bella Mody, an assis
tant professor in communications
who was recently denied tenure
here. The staff of the Affirmative Ac
tion Office is "■very well

intentioned, and they try to change
things in a low-key manner. Individ
ually, they are magnificent people
— but they don't have much pull."
Mody explained that her sex was
not a major issue in her tenure
denial. "I don't think my being a
woman was the issue here," she
said.
Although the Office of Affirmative
Action helped Mody's cause ini
tially, providing half of her academic
salary during her two years as a
tenure-tract professor, due to what
Mody termed "an unfortunate set of
circumstances" her position will be
terminated at the end of this quar
ter, and neither she nor the AA of
fice can fight her denial.
"Affirmative Action really got
ripped off by the Communications
Department," Mody said. " The
money that is used for nurturing and
growing faculty women was used to
pay a woman who was subsequently
terminated," she explained.
Cecilia Burciaga, who has served
in the past as an affirmative action
officer, was more positive about the
role of affirmative action and the
tenure situation in general. She ex
plained in an affirmative action
report issued in June that "since
1970, the number of women in
tenure-track positions has increased
from 49 to 103. The number of wo
men tenured has increased form 24
to 48."
At present, there are at least 52

tenured women here, Burciaga said.
In a study she released of the arts
and sciences departments of
"comparable" institutions, Stanford
fell behind only the University of
Pennsylvania in the number of
tenured women. Vet Burciaga feels
this ranking is simply not good
enough — and the problem, she
believes, lies not at the hiring level,
but in promotion.
"From my viewpoint, women
have been far more successful
recently at the appointment stage
and this has a lot to do with af
firmative action," she said. "But al
though there has been some suc
cess at the promotion level, there is
still a real problem here."
Burciaga said the lack of female
faculty members creates an addi
tional strain on the few women who
do teach here. She explained that
the few women who make it into the
faculty often find themselves over
loaded with the double duty of
teaching and serving as a role model
in an institution where 40 percent of
the student body — and less than 10
percent of the faculty — are women.
Women faculty also often feel
obligated to serve on more than the
normal number of academic com
mittees in order to ensure that the
women's community is adequately
represented, she said.
"This sort of work is very time
consuming, and often not ap
preciated. And it certainly has an ef
fect on the time a tenure-track wo
men has to spend on her research,"
she said. "So, in addition to dis
crimination there is this problem of
an overload of responsibility for wo
men here."
