# Coffee House, Store to expand in Tresidder renovation plans
## 
### KAREN BOLLERMANN 
The Coffee House will expand, the bowling alley will
disappear, the Store will enlarge and Tresidder's lobby
will be revamped if plans for the renovation of Tresid
der Memorial Union are approved by the Tresidder
Union Board and the University later this month.
Spencer Associates architects presented these plans
to the Tresidder Board last week.
Ellie Oppenheim, director of Tresidder and a mem
ber of the Board, said that Tresidder should function as
a "diverse but unified gathering place for the Stanford
community," but that the building's physical structure
has made that impossible.
She emphasized that the chief concern with the
renovation is first to improve and enlarge existing func
tions, and then to create additional facilities where
needed.
Although the plans are still incomplete, the Board
has agreed upon certain definite conceptual changes.
In describing the nature of the changes, Bill Busse,
president of Spencer Associates, said that it is similar to
a "checkers game," where "pieces" will be moved
around within the basic Tresidder framework.
The 20-year-old building has become "pressed for
space," as the Coffee House and the Store continue to
receive high-density traffic flows, whereas the bowling

alley, which takes up 11,000 square feet, has fallen out
of use. In addition, there is no central entrance to or
clearly defined pedestrian walkway through Tresidder,
but instead a confused mass flow through the building
that adds to the already overcrowded indoor seating
areas.
With these problems in mind, Spencer Associates
proposed a feasibility plan based on a comprehensive
plan submitted by the Space Use Committee of the
Tresidder Union Board. The plan consists of five major
"clusters," two involving the lower level and two the
upper. The final cluster deals with the front and back
patio areas.
The first part involves enclosing the spiral staircase in
glass and expanding the lobby area to include the infor
mation center and the ticket office, thus defining a
central entrance to the building. Also, the Coffee
House will be moved to the old bowling alley space,
with the games arcade adjoining it.The Store will be
moved into the old Coffee House space. This would si
multaneously enlarge the Coffee House and The Store,
give each a better identity, and allow "circulation
through Tresidder without having to go outside in
inclement weather," according to the plan.
