# University seeks $19 million bond
## 
### SHELLY WENTKER Staff writer 
The University will seek up to $19
million through a bond issue later
this month, according to Harry
Turner, associate treasurer of the
University.
The proceeds from the bond
would be used for the purchase of
capital equipment for service center
operations. Specifically, $10 million
would go to the central telephone
system, $3 million to computer
equipment, $1.6 million to energy

management control systems and
$500,000 to the Stanford University
Network (SUNet). The remainder of
the proceeds would be used for
costs of issuance of the bond, debt
reserve and insurance.
With this issue, the University's
total debt would increase to $163
million, a figure which, Turner said,
is not unusually large.
This set of bonds will be issued
through the California Educational
Facilities Authority (CEFA), a state
authority which issues bonds at tax

exempt interest rates on behalf of
private higher education in Califor
nia.
Turner also said this will be the
fifth time the University has issued
through CEFA and that this particu
lar issue is unique because it is a col
lective issue that "involves a good
many institutions with no rating or
low ratings." Stanford will be one of
18 private institutions of higher edu
cation in the pool.
The University first received an
AAA rating, the best rating available,
from both Moody's and Standard
and Poor's in 1978 and currently
maintains this rating. On account of
this rating, Turner said Stanford's in
volvement in this issue has
"broadened access to tax exempt
financing by a large number of insti
tutions that wouldn't otherwise
have that access."
