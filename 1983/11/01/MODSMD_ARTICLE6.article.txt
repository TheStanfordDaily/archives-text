U.S. admits hitting hospital
Washingtonâ€”Reagan administration officials,
who last week insisted that U.S. forces had invaded
Grenada without inflicting any civilian casualties, ac
knowledged yesterday that an unknown number of
Grenadian civilians died in a U.S. Navy air attack on
an unmarked mental hospital on the first day of the
invasion.
In a statement issued late yesterday, the Pentagon
said that 12 bodies had been recovered from the
wreckage of the hospital and that four or five more
could be buried there. However, Pentagon officials
said the dead may include a number of Grenadian
soldiers who they said had been firing on American
troops from the hospital, located with the Fort Fred

erick military complex outside the capital of St.
George's.
"As far as we know, these are the only civilian
deaths," Pentagon spokesman Michael Burch said.
"One of the problems is that we've been taking ter
ritory and moving on, not occupying it, and the
Grenadians have just buried people on the spot."
Official confirmation of the civilian deaths, which
came six days after the attack and then only after
press accounts of the incident surfaced Sunday,
added to a growing controversy over the credibility
of U.S. government accounts from Grenada. White
House and Pentagon public-affairs officials have said
privately that they were upset at the administration's
lack of candor in dealing with the invasion of the tiny
Caribbean nation.
