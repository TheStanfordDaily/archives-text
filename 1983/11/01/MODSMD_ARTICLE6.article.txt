U.S. admits hitting hospital
Washington—Reagan administration officials,
who last week insisted that U.S. forces had invaded
Grenada without inflicting any civilian casualties, ac
knowledged yesterday that an unknown number of
Grenadian civilians died in a U.S. Navy air attack on
an unmarked mental hospital on the first day of the
invasion.
In a statement issued late yesterday, the Pentagon
said that 12 bodies had been recovered from the
wreckage of the hospital and that four or five more
could be buried there. However, Pentagon officials
said the dead may include a number of Grenadian
soldiers who they said had been firing on American
troops from the hospital, located with the Fort Fred

erick military complex outside the capital of St.
George's.
"As far as we know, these are the only civilian
deaths," Pentagon spokesman Michael Burch said.
"One of the problems is that we've been taking ter
ritory and moving on, not occupying it, and the
Grenadians have just buried people on the spot."
Official confirmation of the civilian deaths, which
came six days after the attack and then only after
press accounts of the incident surfaced Sunday,
added to a growing controversy over the credibility
of U.S. government accounts from Grenada. White
House and Pentagon public-affairs officials have said
privately that they were upset at the administration's
lack of candor in dealing with the invasion of the tiny
Caribbean nation.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Leslie )anka
announced yesterday that he was resigning because,
he said, his "personal credibility" had been com
promised by the lack of accurate information being
provided by the administration.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass),
meanwhile, announced that a group of House mem
bers would make a fact finding trip to Grenada to
"try to find out as much information as they can" to
determine whether the invasion was justified. A
resolution by Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd
(D-W.Va.) noting restrictions on press coverage of
the invasion, also urged a Senate fact finding mis
sion, but that proposal was stalled by Republican op
position.
The Pentagon statement released late yesterday
said U.S. forces occupying the Governor General's
residence outside St. George's called in an air strike
last Tuesday to suppress enemy fire, and that a
single Navy A-7 jet from the aircraft carrier Indepen
dence responded. The statement said that the Navy
jet had been fired on from the hospital area while it
was on its bombing run.
"The Marines did not know a hospital had been
hit and, since they encountered no resistance from
the hospital site, did not visit the site," the state
ment said in explaining the six-day delay in reporting
that a hospital had been attacked.
Fort Frederick, one of four military installations
along a ridge east of St. George's, was captured by
U.S. Marines late Tuesday afternoon.
The Pentagon statement quoted the hospital's
director, Dr. Clement Gabrial, as saying that the
Grenada Peoples Revolutionary Army had "armed
both patients and staft and posted them in the
vicinity of the building," and that at the time of the
air strike Grenadian soldiers were firing at American
troops.
Lebanese leaders convene
Geneva, Switzerland — Lebanon's warring Mos
lem, Druze and Christian leaders yesterday opened
their long-awaited national reconciliation confer

ence aimed at ending more than eight years of
fratricidal war and drawing up a new political sys
tem.
The historic meeting here of the country's nine
most important sectarian leaders — the first such
meeting in 40 years — took place in a solemn atmo
sphere, with President Amin Gemayal reminding
them that they were all "the vanquished" of the
prolonged political turmoil that has brought
Lebanon to the brink of partition.
"We all bear our share of the responsibility," he
said in an opening 10-minute speech. "Whoever
among us is without sin or fault, let him throw the
first stone."
"We came here to save Lebanon, to unite
people, to recover its sovereignty and to strengthen
the brotherly bonds amongst the Lebanese them
selves on the one hand and between the Lebanese
and their Arab brothers on the other," he said. "We
want these bonds on the basis of justice, equity and
human dignity."
Gemavel said Lebanon was "dying" and "moans
under the weight of ruin and fears." He admonished
that they were all responsible for "saving Lebanon
and the aspirations of the Lebanese for unity, secur
ity and sovereignty" of the country.
In a gesture of reconciliation toward the Moslem
opposition leaders seated to his left, Gemayel said
Lebanon could not cut itself off from its Arab neigh
bors or "take an individual stand ... in matters ot
peace and destiny."
Alfonsin wins Argentine election
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Raul Alfonsin and his
left-of-center radical Civic Union yesterday won Ar
gentina's first general elections in a decade, to
replace the military government. It was a stunning
defeat for the Peronist Party which has dominated
national politics for nearly 40 years.
The military government that has ruled since a
1976 coup said Alfonsin and vice presidential run
ning mate Victor Martinez, both attorneys, had
received 7.43 million of the more than 14 million bal
lots cast in Sunday's elections — good for 318 votes
in the electoral college. The college will meet Nov.
30 to ratify the results.
The government says the new leadership will take

over by January 1984, but could move up the date.
The Peronist presidential candidates, former Sen.
Italo Luder and his running mate Deolindo Bittel,
received 5.71 million votes — 258 electoral college
votes, the government said.
"We've won the election, but we haven't defeated
anyone," Altonsin, 56, told cheering supporters at
party headquarters in downtown Buenos Aires as
election returns showed the radicals building an un
beatable advantage.
Senate bickers over credit limit
Washington — A defiant Senate edged the govern
ment perilously close to its credit limit last night in
what Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) called
a "giant game of chicken" over tax increases and
spending cuts to reduce deficits.
Facing a midnight deadline for approval of legisla
tion to raise the debt ceiling, the Senate nonetheless
spent most of the day in intermittent debate on is
sues that ranged as far from the debt issue as a nu
clear freeze and a limit on state severance taxes on
coal and other energy sources.
As it waited for the approach of midnight in hopes
that a deadline crisis would force action on the debt
measure, the Senate:
— rejected, 55-42, a call from Sen. Robert Kasten (R-
Wis.) to put the Senate on record against any major
tax increases until Congress makes more substantial
cuts in spending.
—approved, 92-6, a proposal from Sen. Max Baucus
(D-Mont.) to urge that the United States and lapan
eliminate all nonessential restrictions on imports of
beef.
—approved by voice vote a watered-down version of
an earlier proposal to force the lifting or modifica
tion of Pentagon restrictions on press coverage in
Grenada.
As the Senate marked time on the debt measure
for the fourth day, it ignored appeals both from the
Reagan administration and its leadership for prompt
action to avoid potentially costly disruptions in the
government's financing operations.
"It may already be too late ... I think we may
have just lost $250 million," said Finance Committee
Chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.), as the Senate, still

quarreling over extraneous amendments, headed
into an evening session without acting on the bill.
Judge overturns Craft decision
Kansas City, Mo. — A federal judge yesterday
threw out a $500,000 verdict-won by former anchor
woman Christine Cratt and ruled that her demotion
by a TV station was not the result of sex discrimina
tion.
U.S. [District ludge Joseph Stevens said the jury
verdict on Craft's allegations of fraud against
Metromedia Inc. was the result of "passion, preju
dice, confusion or mistake," and ordered a new tri
al.
The former anchorwoman, in Milwaukee on a
speaking tour, said she was "appalled" by the deci
sion and vowed to pursue the case "to its highest
level if I have to."
Craft had claimed that she was demoted trom co
anchor of news broadcasts to reporter because she
wasn't attractive or deferential enough to men, but
Stevens wrote that the Kansas City TV station had to
contend with Craft's "below-average aptitude in
matters of clothes and makeup."
Texas Instruments' stock soars
New York — A sharp rise in Texas Instruments
shares was the highlight of a mixed session in the
stock market yesterday.

eight points at midday, finished with a 1.72 gain at
1225.20.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to
79.42 million shares, against 81.18 million Friday.
Texas Instruments jumped 22'/4 to 124 Vi after a
delayed opening. Late Friday the company an
nounced a decision to withdraw from the home
computer business, cutting its losses in that market.

dershowers. Highs from the upper 50s to mid 60s.
