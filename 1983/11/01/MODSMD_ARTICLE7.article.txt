## Invasion affects community

A Hoover library assistant awaits news from her
son who is still there, two students have sisters who
just arrived home from there, and one Palo Alto wo
man just returned from there herself.
The U.S. invasion of Grenada last week has
become very personal for a few members of the
Stanford community.
Kathy Lavicka of Palo Alto returned to the United
States Saturday. She is a second-year student at St.
George's Medical School and said the situation in
Grenada was very frightening. During the invasion,
Cuban and Grenadian soldiers fired on American
helicopters and American forces bombed an area
close to her house. "A bomb came close to the
house one time," she said, "and I felt like I had to
keep low."
Lavicka said she wished the invasion was not nec
essary, but under the circumstances supported Pres
ident Reagan's decision to invade. "It was necessary
to try and get us," she said. "I feel that people here
demonstrating against the invasion don't really
know what was going on."
Lia Borshchevsky, a library specialist for the
Hoover Institution, received word yesterday mor
ning that her son, Michael, is safe. He is a medical
student in Grenada and was one of the few who did
not come home last week.
"It was a very hard time for me," said
Borshchevsky. "Only this morning I got information
that he's alright." Although she has not talked to her
son, she did receive a call from representatives from
the State Department. "I still do not know his
plans," she said, "and I don't know if he wanted to
stay in Grenada or not."
Borshchevsky herself supports Reagan's decision

to invade the island. "I think he was absolutely
right/' she said. "I would advise those who are pro
testing against the Grenadian invasion to protest
against the USSR also, not just Reagan and his deci
sion."
Kathy Nelson, a senior in human biology, learned
Sunday that her sister and brother-in-law were safely
back in the United States. Her sister, Marci Suit, and
her husband Tom were second-year students at St.
George's.
"I was worried about them last week," said Nel
son, "but I knew they would be pretty safe because
they had rented a sailboat and were on it when the
invasion occurred. After they left on the sailboat
they never went back to the island."
Nelson said she has not attended any of the inva
sion protests. "Before I might have been indifferent
to the invasion, but it changes the whole situation
when you've got a family member or someone you
love down there. I wanted them out."
Sophomore Melanie Mueller also has a sister who
just returned home from Grenada. She said she is
glad her sister is home but declined further com
ment.
Kathy Lavicka decided she wanted to get out of
Grenada after the military coup led by General Hud
son Austin. She said the students were not sure of
the new military government's intents.
"The American Consul took 500 names of
Americans who wanted to get off the island to Austin
but he said it was too many. He had only expected 50
and would not allow the evacuation," she ex
plained. "Formerly he had said we could all leave,
but suddenly we had no alternative but to stay put."
