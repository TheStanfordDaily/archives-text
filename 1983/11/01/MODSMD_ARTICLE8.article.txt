## Floating to achieve the high road to success 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
A tennis player watches a tennis pro playing
in a tournament. He becomes so involved with
the moves the pro is making, with the intensity
of the expert's concentration, that his muscles
begin to twitch in anticipation of the pro's
movements. But when he is out on the court
himself, he cannot imitate the finesse he so
admires in the professional's game. How can
he improve his playing?
Stanford graduate student Brian Hennessy
claims he has the answer to these questions.
Hennessy, a graduate student in education
and director of Palo Alto's Psykon Industries,
uses what he calls "achievement imaging" to
help clients achieve goals ranging from a better
backhand to more consistent harnessing of
psychic powers. With the aid of a sensory
deprivation (or flotation isolation) tank and
some high-tech computer and video equip
ment, Hennessy practices REST (Restricted En
viornmental Stimulation Therapy.)
Hennessy owns two isolation tanks. One on
the fifth floor of Jordan Quad, is equipped for
electrophysiological research that Hennessy
has postponed due to lack of funding. The
other tank, belonging to Psykon, is at Water
course Way, a hot tub spa in Palo Alto.
The tank is a 12-foot long acrylic rectangle,
equipped with a video monitor and high
fidelity speakers. Inside the tank is a 10-inch
deep epsom salt solution, kept at 93.5 degrees
Fahrenheit (skin temperature, plus or minus .5
degrees.) When the door of the tank is closed
and the floater relaxes inside, he cannot see,
hear or feel anything around him.
Entirely deprived of outside stimuli, Hennes
sy's clients are forced to concentrate on the
"goals" that they and Hennessy discuss. Some

watch what Hennessy describes as "images of
perfection" on the video screen. These images
are videotapes of champion golfers, dancers,
skiers, tennis players, etc., whose perfor
mances are among the best in their field.
Some go through scripts that they and Hen
nessy have prepared. He talks to them inside
the tank, asking them to visualize themselves in
certain situations and to clarify certain objec
tives. Other floaters simply listen to tapes,
either self-help tapes or their favorite music.
The result, according to Hennessy, is im
proved performance or a better sense of direc
tion for his clients. "If you look through his
tory, you'll see that cults have always used iso
lation to change the way in which people think.
At Psykon, we use the isolation tank to help the
client control his own changes," he explained.
"You have to understand that I don't consider
the tank itself as important as the entire
process — we use the tank as a tool," he ex
plained.
Hennessy uses the tank three day a week for
research. For another three days, the tank is
available to paying customers at Watercourse
Way for those who want to try the experience
without Hennessy's program. However, he
does not recommend the flotation experience
unless the client fully understands the process.
"We lose a lot of customers this way —
people who expect the wrong things and who
don't realize they won't get the full benefits of
the tank on the first float," he said.
In addition to the athletic videotapes he now
has, Hennessy plans to develop a video library
of superachievers, or "heroes," going through
an average day in their lives. Another of his
projects is to create a corporate library that
presents the atmosphere of a corporation to
recruits.
