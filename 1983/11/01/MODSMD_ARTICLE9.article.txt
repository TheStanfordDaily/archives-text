# An insider's tanking guide

The first thing I notice is
that the inside of the isola
tion tank isn't entirely dark.
A crack of light frames the
door to the tank. Although
barely perceptible, it is
enough to shatter the ex
pected effect of total dark
ness and absolute silence.
"Uh . . . Brian?" Ambi
ent music begins to
resonate softly throughout
the tank. "Shouldn't it be
totally dark in here," I ask.
"There's a light coming in
from the door."
"It looks like you're
having your first hallucina
tion." says Brian Hennessy,
the tank's proprietor. "Or
maybe when I turn off the
light in the room . . .
Absolute darkness. I
notice my feet touching the
side of the tank. I wiggle
until I can't touch the walls
of the tank, relax my
muscles, and lean back. I
can't feel the salt water on
my skin, but I certainly feel
it in my eyes if I leave them

open.
At last, I begin to feel
somewhat — deprived. I
can hear my heart beating
but nothing else. If I hold
my hand in front of my
face, I can't really tell it's
there. I contemplate the
feeling (or lack of it) of
being suspended in a body
temperature solution of ep
som salts. Most of my body
feels weightless, but my
head seems too heavy for
my neck. A pillow floats in
the tank, but Hennessy said
he prefers that first-time
floaters keep their ears un
der water.
Occasionally i become
aware of the filmy coating
of salt sticking to my skin.
(Before and after tanking,
Hennessy requires his
clients to shower in a stall
adjacent to the tank.) My
neck is becoming stiff; I
slosh around inside the
tank to find the floating pil
low and prop it under my
neck and shoulders.
A few minutes after I

begin to use the pillow,
music floats into the cham
ber again. At first, I wonder
if Brian has followed my
original suggestion of tur
ning the music on after 10
minutes of silence. Then I
realize I have probably
been in the tank for longer
than 10 minutes, although I
don't know exactly for how
long.
"How are you doing?"
Brian asks. I say I feel com
pletely relaxed. How long
do you think you've been
floating?" he asks.
I guessed. "Between 35
and 45 minutes?". t
"Not even close," Brian
says. "You've been floating
for 90 minutes." My ses
sion is over. "Take your
time getting out of the
tank," he says.
The light reappears
around the door; I climb
out of the tank and take a
slow, warm shower. I don't
feel transformed, just
relaxed and revitalized —
except for a stiff neck.
