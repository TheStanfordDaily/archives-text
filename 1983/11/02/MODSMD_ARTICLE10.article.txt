## The 						Stanford Daily Anderson's personal party 
### 
It's that time of year again.
Right after the jack-o-lanterns disappear, the
Thanksgiving decorations emerge. Pretty soon
we'll be seeing Christmas decorations in th- 1
shopping center. But wait — somebod s
ahead of schedule. Looking like the ghost of
Christmas past, john Anderson visited Stanford
last week in an effort to generate a baso of sup
port.
Clearly Anderson fits the role of the "self
interested politician." His new party is little
more than a front for his personal ambition
Unlike the Democrats, the Republicans and
even the Libertarians, the party has no con oil
ing ideology. It exists solely for the purpo if
running Anderson's presidential campaig
and will probably cease to exist after Novem
ber of 1984.
This time around, Anderson isn't running as
an independent candidate. He's forming a new
political party, which is seductively called the
"National Unity Party" (NUP). He said that the
two party system is a failure because both the
Democrats and the Republicans have been
captured by PACs. Thus, the NUP will not ac
cept a single dollar of PAC money.
Wait a minute. Is this the same ex-
Republican congressman from Illinois who ran
for President in 1980? Does Anderson mean to
tell us that he has never taken any PAC money
for his congressional campaigns? And how are
his local and state candidates going to run for
office without the generous financial support
from political action committees?
While Anderson apparently has problems

with taking money from PACs, he has no
qualms about taking it from the taxpayers. Un
der recent campaign financing laws, a can
didal who receives more than 5 percent of the
votes in a general election is entitled to money
t orn the presidential campaign fund.
Ironically, though, what bothers us the most
about Anderson is his lack of new ideas. Ironic
because Anderson says that the problem with
'e current two-party system is their lack of en
couragement for new ideas. His platform,
rather than being an "independent" one, falls
somewhere in the leit of today's American poli
tical spectrum.
He is not the first candidate to suggest that
we seriously negotiate with the G ntradoras in
Central America. Nor is he the fir i t to propose
slashing the defense budget, albe his sugges
tion ot a 25 percent cut seems a L it excessive.
Anderson also joins most of the D< locratic
contenders in an endorsement of th luclear
freeze.
Moreover, his suggestion that we eliminate
$3 billion in credits and exemptions for the
wealthy — while a noble concept — amounts
to a mere pittance when stacked against a
federal budget deficit that topped $195 billion
for the year just ended.
The creation of new political parties is not a
bad thing. On the contrary — new parties
would give the electorate some much needed
alternatives to today's highly polarized party
system. But Anderson's NUP is not an alterna
tive — it's not really a party. It's a blatant at
tempt by a self-interested politician to use
federal money in furthering his own ambitions.
