## Don't sell weapons to China 
### 
Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, recently announced
that America will sell sophisticated
weaponry to the world's most
populous communist state: China.
America's moral claim to uphold
democracy and civil liberty abroad
has been dealt yet another blow by
its decision to arm what
remains — 34 years after the
Chinese Revolution — a closed,
morally bankrupt and brutal regime.
In part, the West's decision to arm
China stems from the contemporary
influence of those policy-makers
who are preoccupied with short
term — and if I may add,
myopic — geopolitical calculations.
But more importantly, the decision
to arm China stems from large scale
naivete, on the part of Americans
and West Europeans alike, as to the
nature of the Chinese regime.
The U.S. decision to arm China is
a tribute to the public relations ef
forts of Deng Xiao Ping and his
comrades. They have, after all, suc
cessfully carried out a systematic
deception of the Western public
over the years that would turn the
Kremlin green.
The idea propagated by Deng and
his comrades is that of a China on
the road to reform, mixing a form
of quaint, home-spun communism
with liberal doses of capitalism.
Deng's regime has assumed a
devastatingly deceptive garb. Its

trappings are different from those of
Mao's regime, hut in its fundamen
tals it is the same. After all, the hall
marks of a free society — a free
press, the presence of overt political
dissent and opposition, safeguards
against the arbitrary use of the
state's coercive machinery,
etc. — are as absent in China today
as they were in the days of Chairman
Mao.
The state run? rough-shod over its
citizen's decisions. For example, it
regulates the choice of having
children (it keeps tabs on women's
menstruation and carries out forced
abortions.) It incarcerates and tor
ments citizens who hold ideas con
trary to those of its ideologues.
The Western public and press has
remained largely indifferent to all
this. In aggregate, the Chinese
regime inflicts a great deal more
misery on the citizens of this planet
that does that of the Soviet Union.
By country, in per capita terms, it
probably inflicts about the same.
And abroad, China's tyranny
rivals, if not exceeds that of the So
viet Ur on. While the average west
erner s aware of the Soviet Union's
systen tic destruction of Afghanis
tar she is unaware of China's spon
sorship, not too long ago, f hr>
destruction of Cambodia by the Pol
Pot ->o~r-,ir Cambodian
tragedy, iiivolved the

butchery of some two million
people, has been the world's most
horrific experience since the
holocaust.
Even on the less consequential
level of international wind-baggery,
China recently refused to vote for a
United Nations Security Council
resolution condemning the Soviet
Union for its downing of the Korean
Airlines jet.
The fact is that China effectively
remains a hermetically sealed soci
ety. The state heavily regulates in
formation gathering and we are
unable to find out what exactly it is
that the government takes such
pains to conceal. The stories that do
filter out of China are often ghastly.
Not only is the Chinese regime's
treatment of its own people
deplorable, but its foreign policy
has a history of brutality and
amorality. Its diplomatic postures
are often contrary to U.S. interests.
Further, the United States ought
not to be playing little geopolitical
games that tend to destabilize the
balance of power between the
United States and the Soviet Union.
In the final analysis, the United
States simply ought not to be in the
business of selling arms to a govern
ment that does not respect the
rights of its citizens.
