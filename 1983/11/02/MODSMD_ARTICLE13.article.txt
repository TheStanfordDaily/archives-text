# The
						high cost of commuting
## 
### 
Few phenomena can waste time, money and energy
while causing aggravation and pollution. One of the
most wasteful of these is the practice of commuting.
Commuting causes staggering waste. Many people
spend an hour or more each way getting to work. They
spend a significant portion of their lives travelling. If
someone spends one and a half hours a day commuting
with lormal sleeping and eating habits, they waste 375
hours a year, over 10 percent of their non-working
waking hours. While train and bus riders may do some
work while in transit, they can't be as efficient as in an
office
Commuting is also expensive. If someone lives 40
miles om work, they travel 20,000 miles each year, just
commuting. If they drive, they spend several thousand
dollars a year to do so. They could take a lower paying
job near home and still come out ahead financially.
While carpools save a large fraction of the cost, they
still take just as much time. Or, they could take the bus
or train. While publ•' transportation is much cheaper
than driving, at even $5 a day it is still over a $1000 a
year. You still have to get to and from the station.

The should encourage
people to live close to their work ...
planners must work harder to ensure
that housing and jobs are placed in
proximity to each other.

Of course, the further someone lives from work, the
more likely they are to get delayed or stopped, by
breakdowns, accidents or even bad weather.
Aside from individual considerations, commuting
harms the economy. It is a major cause of the energy
shortage. Someone driving an energy efficient car 40
miles to work uses about 600 gallons of gas each year.lf
50 million people each drive 30 miles each way to work,
that is 20 billion gallons of gas each year, or 480 million
barrels, about half our current oil imports. This ac
counts for a large chunk of our trade deficit.
This gas ends up in our air, in the form of pollution.
Although cars are much cleaner now than a few years
ago, they are still a major source of pollution.
Besides the varied physical effects, commuting can
be psychologically devastating. Who can remain cheer
ful after wasting an hour stuck in a traffic jam; or mis
sing an important meeting because the car wouldn't
start; or worse, never seeing a child because bedtime is
before the commute is over.

While commuting may be a communal insanity, it is
not going to go away. Like it or not, commuting is an in
grained part of our lifestyle. The days of living in small
villages and walking to work are gone forever.
However, the commuting problem has a simple solu
tion. People should live near where they work, study
and shop. While this solution is trivial, putting it into
practice is very complex. It requires a lot of individual
action.
People must make a conscious effort to live close to
their place of employment. Before accepting a job, they
should consider whert »v This is especially rele
vant for job-huniing se s. Do you really want a job
where you will h ve to travel an hour each way, adding
two extra hours to your workday? If so, commuting will
become a major pat. of your life, a big drain on time,
energy and money
When housenunting, many people will neglect
slightly less attractive areas near their work, opting for
distant, but nicer areas, forgetting that after two hours
of travel, they will be too .ired to enjoy it. The few
thousand dollars that they may save will be quickly
eaten u" by commuting costs.
Even i people must commute, some modes of travel
are worse than others. Driving alone is by far the
costliest, in terms of money, time, pollution and ag
gravation. Carpools will at least divide the cost, pollu
tion and aggravation. Buses, trains and other mass
transit will greatly reduce aggravation, pollution and
cost, while allowing for semi-productive use of travel
time.
In view ot the co-.; to society, the government should
encourage people lo in e close to their work or to use
these alternatives. While it might be politically un
popular, an increase in the gasoline tax would greatly
encourage people to use these alternatives. Additional
ly, the money could be used to help alleviate some of
the effects of the pollution from commuting.
Of course, society is partly responsible for long
commutes. Urban planners must work harder to
ensure that housing ar I jobs are placed in proximity to
each other. Bedroon communities and industrial
enclaves must be merj. 'd. Of course, some industries
cause noise and pollution, making people reluctant to
live nearby. However, in many cases, this pollution can
be alleviated with relative ease. The money required
could easily be saved by the reduced commuting costs
of the workers.
But, v liie socit-ty is partlv esponsibh for mmut
ing madness, it is i ally the decision ( iiieind
vidual. No one can force people to live near their jobs.
