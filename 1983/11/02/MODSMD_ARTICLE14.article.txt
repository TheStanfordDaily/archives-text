ROTC & feminism
About giving credit to ROTC
classes, I must agree wholehearted
ly with Bill Hook's incisive observa
tion (Daily, Oct. 27) that "if they
give credit for feminist studies, they
should give credit for military
studies."
It makes perfect sense! After all,
feminism amd militarism deal with
the same subject, namely life:
Feminists search for ways to raise
the quality of life while militarists
are perfecting methods for lower
ing the quantity.
Since it is widely agreed that
quality and quantity are inversely
proportional, it can be shown that

the two groups are merely advocat
ing widely disparate means for
achieving a Glorious End.

After reading The Daily
article "AIDS threat instills caution
in Stanford gay community"
(Oct. 17), we feel it is crucial to
address the misconceptions sup
ported by quotations and ideas
attributed to us. The phrases ex
tracted from our respective inter
views appear, out of context, to
support a position contrary to our
actual views.

In our experience as gay coun
selors at the Bridge, AIDS has not
been an issue for those who have
sought counseling this quarter.
Issues such as coming out to par
ents and friends, loneliness, frustra
tion in dealing with limited social
alternatives, and feelings about
adopting a gay lifestyle have always
been and continue to be of primary
concern to many gay men at Stan
ford.
The AIDS "scare" has not
changed our own lifestyles or those
of our friends at Stanford and at
large. This disease has affected only
a minute percentage of America's
approximately 10 million gay men;
those affected nonetheless remain

valued members of our community.
We do not perceive AIDS as a per
sonal threat.
Heightened awareness of sexual
responsibility is a constructive
response to this serious health
crisis. We do not mean abstinence
or monogomy: Sexual responsibil
ity can be an integral part of a
sexually active lifestyle. It is appro
priate to label the Stanford gay
community as "conservative" in
this regard; in fact, we see sexual
responsibility as a progressive ap
proach.
The mythology about AIDS and
the gay community promulgated by
the straight press primarily affects
straight people, who can use this

distorted information as an excuse
for homophobic hostility. We feel
that an article implying that some
dire threat of contagion hangs over
gay men is unfortunate, as it gives
our detractors another weapon in
their u tt icks on our liberty.

Protests as usual
If you listened carefully, you
could hear the sound of jerking
knees. From every corner of
campus came the the swift, inevi
table and wholly predictable
response to our military action in
Grenada. There was the silent vigil
in White Plaza, the "teach in" over
in Jordan Hall and of course the
mandatory march to the home of
Secretary of State George Shultz.
"U$ OUT OF GRENADA" said the
banner. "Honk your horn for
peace," they bellowed. It was all
very routine.
Funny how some things weren't
mentioned, though. Like the
hundreds of flag-waving students
rescued from Grenada who praised
the whole operation.
We didn't hear much about the
Cubans either. There were sup
posedly 300 or so of
them — construction workers,
right? Just building an airport.
Strange how it turned out that there
were at least three times that many.
Most well-armed, too.
The Soviets! What about them?
Just because three warehouses
stuffed with their weapons were
found, that's no need for concern,
is it?
And finally, what of the
Grenadian citizens? Did we hear of
how they tried to lynch the new
second-in-command, Bernard

Coard, after the Marines captured
him?
Ask yourself — why weren't
these issues raised? Could it be that
the answers might have under
mined the activists' moral thrust,
namely, "self determination" for
Grenada?

Executive abuse
We would like to express our
dismay at the growing aggressive
ness of the United States in foreign
policy, especially with respect to
the recent military actions in
Grenada. We feel the invasion and
resulting deaths were morally un
justifiable given that no threat had
been made to American lives and
that the political situation there
appeared to be stabilizing.
The only "justification" made by
the Reagan administration has been
one of propaganda and rhetoric.
While the American public is told
that "leftist thugs" are terrorizing
Grenada and that our job is to
"restore democracy," no substan
tial reason has been given for the
action taken.
We are also amazed at the
Reagan administration's lack of
creativity in dealing with foreign
policy problems. Diplomacy seems
to have been rejected in favor of
the cry "Send in the Marines!"
The covert war in Nicaragua, the
use of U.S. military aid in the civil
war in El Salvador, the stationing of
Marines in Beirut, and finally the
invasion of Grenada all exemplify
abuses of executive privileges.

ROTC & feminism
About giving credit to ROTC
classes, I must agree wholehearted
ly with Bill Hook's incisive observa
tion (Daily, Oct. 27) that "if they
give credit for feminist studies, they
should give credit for military
studies."
It makes perfect sense! After all,
feminism amd militarism deal with
the same subject, namely life:
Feminists search for ways to raise
the quality of life while militarists
are perfecting methods for lower
ing the quantity.
Since it is widely agreed that
quality and quantity are inversely
proportional, it can be shown that

the two groups are merely advocat
ing widely disparate means for
achieving a Glorious End.

AIDS fear disputed
After reading The Daily
article "AIDS threat instills caution
in Stanford gay community"
(Oct. 17), we feel it is crucial to
address the misconceptions sup
ported by quotations and ideas
attributed to us. The phrases ex
tracted from our respective inter
views appear, out of context, to
support a position contrary to our
actual views.

In our experience as gay coun
selors at the Bridge, AIDS has not
been an issue for those who have
sought counseling this quarter.
Issues such as coming out to par
ents and friends, loneliness, frustra
tion in dealing with limited social
alternatives, and feelings about
adopting a gay lifestyle have always
been and continue to be of primary
concern to many gay men at Stan
ford.
The AIDS "scare" has not
changed our own lifestyles or those
of our friends at Stanford and at
large. This disease has affected only
a minute percentage of America's
approximately 10 million gay men;
those affected nonetheless remain

valued members of our community.
We do not perceive AIDS as a per
sonal threat.
Heightened awareness of sexual
responsibility is a constructive
response to this serious health
crisis. We do not mean abstinence
or monogomy: Sexual responsibil
ity can be an integral part of a
sexually active lifestyle. It is appro
priate to label the Stanford gay
community as "conservative" in
this regard; in fact, we see sexual
responsibility as a progressive ap
proach.
The mythology about AIDS and
the gay community promulgated by
the straight press primarily affects
straight people, who can use this

distorted information as an excuse
for homophobic hostility. We feel
that an article implying that some
dire threat of contagion hangs over
gay men is unfortunate, as it gives
our detractors another weapon in
their u tt icks on our liberty.

Protests as usual
If you listened carefully, you
could hear the sound of jerking
knees. From every corner of
campus came the the swift, inevi
table and wholly predictable
response to our military action in
Grenada. There was the silent vigil
in White Plaza, the "teach in" over
in Jordan Hall and of course the
mandatory march to the home of
Secretary of State George Shultz.
"U$ OUT OF GRENADA" said the
banner. "Honk your horn for
peace," they bellowed. It was all
very routine.
Funny how some things weren't
mentioned, though. Like the
hundreds of flag-waving students
rescued from Grenada who praised
the whole operation.
We didn't hear much about the
Cubans either. There were sup
posedly 300 or so of
them — construction workers,
right? Just building an airport.
Strange how it turned out that there
were at least three times that many.
Most well-armed, too.
The Soviets! What about them?
Just because three warehouses
stuffed with their weapons were
found, that's no need for concern,
is it?
And finally, what of the
Grenadian citizens? Did we hear of
how they tried to lynch the new
second-in-command, Bernard

Coard, after the Marines captured
him?
Ask yourself — why weren't
these issues raised? Could it be that
the answers might have under
mined the activists' moral thrust,
namely, "self determination" for
Grenada?

Material science
Executive abuse
We would like to express our
dismay at the growing aggressive
ness of the United States in foreign
policy, especially with respect to
the recent military actions in
Grenada. We feel the invasion and
resulting deaths were morally un
justifiable given that no threat had
been made to American lives and
that the political situation there
appeared to be stabilizing.
The only "justification" made by
the Reagan administration has been
one of propaganda and rhetoric.
While the American public is told
that "leftist thugs" are terrorizing
Grenada and that our job is to
"restore democracy," no substan
tial reason has been given for the
action taken.
We are also amazed at the
Reagan administration's lack of
creativity in dealing with foreign
policy problems. Diplomacy seems
to have been rejected in favor of
the cry "Send in the Marines!"
The covert war in Nicaragua, the
use of U.S. military aid in the civil
war in El Salvador, the stationing of
Marines in Beirut, and finally the
invasion of Grenada all exemplify
abuses of executive privileges.
