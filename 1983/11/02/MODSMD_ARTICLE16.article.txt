## Midterm stress? Twinkies are not the answer 
### 
When The Store in Tresid
der Union is out of Grandma's
cookies, it is a sure sign that
midterm exams have arrived.
When the Twinkies and Ho-
Hos disappear, you can be
sure finals are at hand.
Eating foods high in refined
sugar is one reaction to aca
demic stress at Stanford. Un
fortunately, this response is
counter-productive. There are
better ways to deal with the
pressure of exams and papers
than gorging on Ding-Dongs
and fro yo.
Stress is a natural and even a
healthy reaction to the
demands of day to day life.
Fians Selye, one of the
pioneers in research on the
subject, defined stress as the
"nonspecific response of the
body to any demand made
upon it."
This process is useful in
some situations today. But
there is no natural release
from the kind of chronic stress
developed from the pressure
associated with papers and ex
ams The fight or flight
response is not possible and
the tension thus created is
retained to the ultimate detri
ment of the individual.
Eating foods high in refined
sugar is a typical response to
this pressure. Sugar, or more
technically sucrose, is the
most common ingredient in
cookies, candy, ice cream,
and similar desserts. A disac
charide, sucrose is rapidly
broken down into glucose, a
monosaccharide and the form
sugar which the body is
able to use for energy. The
glucose enters the blood
in a matter of minutes
and a rise in energy level is ex

perienced.
But this rise is short-lived.
When the glucose level rises
much above the normal range,
insulin is secreted by the
pancreas to bring the blood
sugar level back down. There
is no accurate sensing mecha
nism in the body and thus in
sulin will continue until the
blood glucose level drops
below normal. The result is a
feeling of fatigue and perhaps
depression. Thus eating high
sugar foods for energy is
counter-productive — the end
result is a decrease, and not an
increase of energy. The
response is often to eat an
other sugar item, thus creating
a vicious circle.
The solution to the problem
of academic stress is to under
stand the nature of the aca
demic process at Stanford, to
view yourself as capable of
dealing with that process, and
to use effective stress reduc
tion techniques.
The academic process at
Stanford is a cooperative
venture in which you and your
professors and their TAs work
together to provide you with
knowledge, it is not a compe
tition in which you and your
teachers are adversaries. Your
professors want you to learn.
Go see professors. Gst to
know them on a first name
basis. Ask them what concepts
in the course are important to
study.
TAs are especially good
sources for test information.
For example, prior to my test
last Friday, I asked my TA how
to spend my study time and
what specific information
would be covered on the test.
Her answers made my study

time more efficient and I did
well on the test.
Stress is often experienced
as time pressure — too many
tests and papers at the same
time. Once I had two finals
back-to-back on the same day.
I went to see one of the pro
fessors and he allowed me to
take his final later in the week.
Professors are often under
standing about these things.
The quarter system puts a lot
of pressure on us. Don't be
afraid to take an incomplete in
order to do the work in a
quality way without excessive
pressure.
Watch out for the "frog
pond effect." This concept is
the tendency to rate ourselves
by comparison to others, not
on our own abilities. In high

school you were a big frog in a
rather small pond. You might
have been valedictorian, pres
ident of the senior class, star
of the basketball team, or all
of the above. Stanford is a big
ger pond and there are a lot of
other big frogs here, some
even bigger than you. But that
fact does not make you a small
frog. In other words, don't
doubt your abilities.
There are many specific
techniques to manage stress. I
will mention only three of
them: laughter, systematic
desensitization, and muscle
relaxation.
Telling jokes is a great way
to relax. Laughter is a healthy
release from tension, and
taking time off from studying
to have a good laugh will

prove beneficial to both your
mental and physical well
being.
Systematic desensitization
was developed by Joseph

Woipe. It involves establishing
a hierarchy of threatening
situations and then develop
ing solutions to each. For ex
ample, assume the following
to be progressively more
threatening academic situa
tions: homework assignment,
quiz, 10-page paper, mid-term
exam worth 30 percent of
grade, final exam worth 50
percent of grade.
Now imagine yourself
dealing with each of these
situations in order. Go
through the steps involved in
successfully completing the
homework assignment. Once
you feel comfortable with the
first situation, move up to the
second, etc. Finally you will be
able to deal with the most
threatening situation.
One popular relaxation
technique was developed by
Dr. FHerbert Benson in "The
Relaxation Response." This
book describes a simple medi
tation technique that has been
shown to be effective in
reducing stress. The four es
sential elements in Benson's
technique are:

1. Find a quiet place without
distractions.
2. Sit or lie in a comfortable
position.
3. Use a mental device such
as a silently repeated word or
phrase. Counting from one to
10 is an example. Breathe
slowly through the nose and
count on each exhalation.
After reaching 10, begin again
with one.
4. Adopt a passive attitude.
When distracting thoughts oc
cur, let them pass. Don't wor
ry about how you are doing,
lust relax and count as you
breathe.
Benson suggests that use of
this method for 10-20 minutes
daily will bring about a reduc
tion in chronic stress and
lower blood pressure.
There it is: know your profs,
know you are good, laugh,
relax, cut back on the
Twinkies and stress will
become a thing of the past.
