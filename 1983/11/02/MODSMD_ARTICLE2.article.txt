# Provost search begins
## 
### 
The search for a new provost is
scheduled to begin today with the
first meeting of a 13-member com
mittee headed by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
Current University Provost Albert
Hastorf announced last month his
intention to return to teaching and
research in psychology after the cur
rent academic year.
In a letter to the committee,
which includes 11 faculty and two
students, Kennedy stressed the im
portance of extending the search
beyond the boundaries of the uni
versity.
"I am, of course, convinced that
the Stanford faculty includes a num
ber of colleagues who could serve
Stanford with distinction in their
role/' he said. "I am equally con
vinced, however, that we should
lose no opportunities that may be
available elsewhere to add to Stan
ford's strengths.

"A search that focused entirely or
primarily on internal candidates
would, I think, be less thorough and
produce a less satisfying and
confidence-inspiring result than one
in which we endeavor to locate the
very best candidate available,
anywhere. For that reason, I am
charging us to conduct a truly na
tional search."
Stanford's last four provosts have
been chosen from the Stanford fac
ulty.
The provost, the University's
highest-ranking academic officer, is
responsible for the quality of aca
demic programs and faculty, and su
pervises the operating budget. He
also develops institutional policy
through the management of the Ad
ministrative Council.
