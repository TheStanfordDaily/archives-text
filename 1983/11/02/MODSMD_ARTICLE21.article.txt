## When one varsity sport is not enough for an athlete 
### TRASK LEONARD 
It's Nov. 20, the day
after the last game of the foot
ball season. Most players hang
up their cleats for at least a few
months. But a few talented
athletes just take off the foot
ball shoes and exchange them
for a different pair.
Only a few athletes have the
good fortune of playing a
sport on the Farm. Even fewer
have the ability, dedication
and desire to participate and
e\ jn stand out in two.
Vet playing two sports is
quite taxing, both on the spirit
and the body.

"Being a double-sport ath
lete here is extremely difficult,
yet we encourage those that
have the talent and desire to
try," noted Athletic Director
Andy Geiger.
Perhaps even Geiger under
estimates the magnitude of
the accomplishment.
For Steve Amonetti the time
devoted to football and track
was so great over the last
several years that he was
forced to return for a fifth year
to finish the requirements for
his major in graphic design.
"I found it really hard
keeping up on my studies. It

was tough spending four or
five hours a day almost every
day of the school year in
practice and after that getting
up the necessary energy to
spend the same amount or
even more time on studying."
Steve Cottrell, quarterback
in the fall and pitcher in the
spring, described the feeling
in more detail.
"Sometimes I tried to study
or do a problem set after a
tough practice, but was just
too worn out to do it.
When I had to stay up and
finish it, my system was out of
sync for three or four days;

and I'd have to go to sleep a
lot in the next few days to
make up," Cottrell explained.
The grind on the studies
also affected football and track
standout Garin Veris. "I
struggled academically for a
while, but now I'm back in
pretty good shape," Veris
said.
Vet if the physical drain on
the athletes was the only
aspect of double sport partici
pation, no athlet" would even
attempt to juggle two sports
and studies. For all of them,
the pluses of the opportunity
to excel in two sports greatly
outweigh the minuses.
Cottrell, who is looking
toward a career in profes
sional baseball, decided long
ago that he wanted to play
both sports.
"As a kid, I hat! the dream of
playing big-time college
sports, especially football.
And, I wished to someday play
professional football or
baseball. So choosing to play
two sports here was just an ex
tension of that dream," he
said.
Though he looks toward
baseball as a career opportu
nity, Cottrell nevertheless
derives equal satisfaction from
both baseball and football, but
in different respects. The
"intensity and structure" of
the football program appeals
to him a great deal. Yet in the
spring, Cottrell enjoys the
"more relaxing" aspects of
being a pitcher in day-to-day
practice.
Since the skills involved in
both positions are relatively
the same, each benefits from
the other.
For Garin Veris, this is one
of the reasons why he chose
to compete in the shot put and
play defensive end for the Car
dinal football team.
"The conditioning required
for both sports, especially the
weight lifting, definitely helps
my overall performance in
both," Veris explained.
For Veris, a future career in
the NFL looks quite possible,
yet he still looks forward to
spring and the track season,
which begins a week after the
Big Game.
Amonetti, who also com
petes in football and track,
finds football the more en
joyable of the two. "The
excitement of a large crowd at
the football games gets me
really excited to play every Sat

urday," he said. Amonetti also
said he feels that the strength
training involved in his throw
ing the shot put greatly helps
his conditioning to play offen
sive lineman.
Hoping to follow the

footsteps of the Cottrells,
Verises and Amonettis, fresh
man Mark Machtolf, who
plays inside linebacker and
catcher/third base, looks to
the future with great anticipa
tion. Machtolf was a nationally

recruited football and baseball
star, and it is hoped that he
will continue to excel in both
here on the Farm.
"I'm ready to do my best
and work hard for both pro
grams," said the freshman.
