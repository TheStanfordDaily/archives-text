# Card overtakes San Diego 4-1
## 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
The men's soccer team did
not let down its guard after
defeating Cal last Friday, and
yesterday quelled the Univer
sity of San Diego by a score of
4-1.
Stanford has now won its
last five games in a row while
San Diego has won its last 14
out of 15 games.
The game began iri a normal
enough fashion with both
teams threatening to score but
unable to converge. Although
San Diego got a couple of
good breaks Stanford began
to dominate.
Exactly 15 minutes into the
game, Stanford's leading
scorer took over. Ciancarlo
Ferruzzi left the defenders be
hind by streaming by them
and taking the ball in for an
unassisted score.
"He out manuevered our
defenders pretty well today,"
San Diego Coach Seamus
McFadden said of Ferruzzi.
Ferruzzi not only started the
scoring but also finished the
day with another unassisted
shot at the 76:00 minute mark.
He now leads all Stanford
players in points with an im

pressive 10 goals and four as
sists for a total of -4 points.
Cassio Conciedo, who was
unable to play in the last two
games because of the flu, ob
viously came prepared to play
today. Conceido smashed in
the Cardinal's second goal
after receiving an assist from
Angel Vasquez.
Vasquez is also back in ac
tion after suffering a broken
foot earlier in the season. If
Stanford is able to win without
these two key players, their
presence in the last few im
portant games to come should
be a major bonus.
San Diego managed to cut
the lead to 2-1 with a shot from
Louis Zeli. The shot also cut
Stanford's shutout streak to
four games.
Although the Cardinal had
15 shots on goal to San
Diego's five, Stanford Coach
Nelson Lodge was not overly
excited about Stanford's play.
"We didn't play well,"
Lodge said. "But we played
well enough to win."
If Lodge considers a 4-1 vic
tory not playing well , the Car
dinal will be in good shape
when it faces some fierce chal
lenges later in the season.
