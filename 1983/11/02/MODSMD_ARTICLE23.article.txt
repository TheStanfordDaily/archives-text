## Blevins blends fencing with brains on the Farm 
### BETH KLEID 
When senior Nik Blevins
was a sophomore in high
school he knew as much
about fencing as the
average person does
— very little.
But things changed when
a Spanish teacher at Oak
wood, the small private
school that Blevins attend
ed in Los Angeles, offered
to teach some of her stu
dents how to fence. Blevins
and some friends took the
teacher up on her offer,
and eventually they started
a fencing team at the
school.
"At first we were
stomped on," said Blevins,
"but then we started to do
well. And I really grew to
like fencing."
As a founder of his high
school team Blevins main
tains an interest in it."I like
to go back once in a while
to see if it's still running,"
he said.
"It has given me another
source of athletic recrea
tion that is special," said
Blevins. "It has allowed me
to be on a varsity team at
Stanford, and to work with
a great group of people."
The senior also noted
that he has transferred
skills he learned in fencing,
such as dealing with pres
sure and learning how to

concentrate intensely, to
other aspects of his life. "If
you can deal with someth
ing in one situation, you
can apply it to another," he
said.
Blevins has applied the
lessons he learned in fen
cing to his academics. A bi
ology major, he is a mem
ber of Phi Beta Kappa and
plans to attend medical
school. Despite spending
10 or more hours per
week on his sport, he has
managed his studies with
little trouble.
"My time committment

to fencing just makes me
more efficient. I have to
push things around, but
they always get done," he
said.
Blevins admits that
people have misconcep
tions about fencing. "Most
people don't have a clue.
They think that fencing is
just like what they see in
old Errol Flynn movies, but
it is more exciting than
that."
He said that people seem
to be interested in finding
out what fencing is really
like, and it has served him

as a conversation piece. He
explained that there are
three weapons in fencing:
foil, saber and epee — the
one in which he competes.
"In epee the whole body
is the target area. Being tall
helps me in epee — at
times body builds can de
termine at which weapon a
player will be most adept,"
said Blevins, who is 6-foot
4.
The senior certainly
seems to be suited to epee.
He has participated in the
junior Olympus three
times, and during his fresh
man year here he finished
fourth in the 20-and-under
category at the event. He
has competed in the Col
legiate Nationals twice,
taking 11th place during his
freshman year, and 17th
when he was a sophomore.
Blevins describes himself
as a fencer who relies on
tactics. "I see what needs
to be done and I do it. A
strong point of mine is to
be able to see moves and
openings," he said. "I also
have the ability to con
centrate, which is impor
tant in fencing."
But the fencer does see
room for improvement. He
would like to work on
bringing consistency into
his game because "when
you aren't 'on' it really

snowballs."
According to Blevins,
people do not realize how
strenuous fencing is —

mentally as well as physi
cally. The team here
prepares itself for both
aspects of the sport. "We

do concentration drills that
teach us the mental attitude
of scoring."
The fencing program on
the Farm satisfies Blevins.
Coach Edwin Buzz' Hurst
teaches the players helpful
hints and strategies. "He
has good insight into where
I need to improve and how
to do it."
Hurst coaches his players
individually twice weekly.
Blevins said these private
sessions help him a great
deal. Fencing is a sport that
offers the a combination of
individual competition with
team unity, and this is a
quality of fencing that
Blevins particularly enjoys.
"In a bout you are the
only one out there, and you
make things happen," he
said. "But it is good to
know that a supportive
team is behind you."
This year's fencing team
is optimistic about the com
ing season. "We have a lot
of potential and I think we
can live up to it. We really
have been proving our
selves; we have finished in
the top 20 nationally
for the past couple of
years," Blevins said.
The senior's aspirations
for the team this year in
clude beating their rival,
San Jose State. Blevin is
aiming for the Nationals.

tion that is special," said
Blevins. "It has allowed me
to be on a varsity team at
Stanford, and to work with
a great group of people."
The senior also noted
that he has transferred
skills he learned in fencing,
such as dealing with pres
sure and learning how to

concentrate intensely, to
other aspects of his life. "If
you can deal with someth
ing in one situation, you
can apply it to another," he
said.
Blevins has applied the
lessons he learned in fen
cing to his academics. A bi
ology major, he is a mem
ber of Phi Beta Kappa and
plans to attend medical
school. Despite spending
10 or more hours per
week on his sport, he has
managed his studies with
little trouble.
"My time committment

to fencing just makes me
more efficient. I have to
push things around, but
they always get done," he
said.
Blevins admits that
people have misconcep
tions about fencing. "Most
people don't have a clue.
They think that fencing is
just like what they see in
old Errol Flynn movies, but
it is more exciting than
that."
He said that people seem
to be interested in finding
out what fencing is really
like, and it has served him

as a conversation piece. He
explained that there are
three weapons in fencing:
foil, saber and epee — the
one in which he competes.
"In epee the whole body
is the target area. Being tall
helps me in epee — at
times body builds can de
termine at which weapon a
player will be most adept,"
said Blevins, who is 6-foot
4.
The senior certainly
seems to be suited to epee.
He has participated in the
junior Olympus three
times, and during his fresh
man year here he finished
fourth in the 20-and-under
category at the event. He
has competed in the Col
legiate Nationals twice,
taking 11th place during his
freshman year, and 17th
when he was a sophomore.
Blevins describes himself
as a fencer who relies on
tactics. "I see what needs
to be done and I do it. A
strong point of mine is to
be able to see moves and
openings," he said. "I also
have the ability to con
centrate, which is impor
tant in fencing."
But the fencer does see
room for improvement. He
would like to work on
bringing consistency into
his game because "when
you aren't 'on' it really

snowballs."
According to Blevins,
people do not realize how
strenuous fencing is —

mentally as well as physi
cally. The team here
prepares itself for both
aspects of the sport. "We

do concentration drills that
teach us the mental attitude
of scoring."
The fencing program on
the Farm satisfies Blevins.
Coach Edwin Buzz' Hurst
teaches the players helpful
hints and strategies. "He
has good insight into where
I need to improve and how
to do it."
Hurst coaches his players
individually twice weekly.
Blevins said these private
sessions help him a great
deal. Fencing is a sport that
offers the a combination of
individual competition with
team unity, and this is a
quality of fencing that
Blevins particularly enjoys.
"In a bout you are the
only one out there, and you
make things happen," he
said. "But it is good to
know that a supportive
team is behind you."
This year's fencing team
is optimistic about the com
ing season. "We have a lot
of potential and I think we
can live up to it. We really
have been proving our
selves; we have finished in
the top 20 nationally
for the past couple of
years," Blevins said.
The senior's aspirations
for the team this year in
clude beating their rival,
San Jose State. Blevin is
aiming for the Nationals.

When senior Nik Blevins
was a sophomore in high
school he knew as much
about fencing as the
average person does
— very little.
But things changed when
a Spanish teacher at Oak
wood, the small private
school that Blevins attend
ed in Los Angeles, offered
to teach some of her stu
dents how to fence. Blevins
and some friends took the
teacher up on her offer,
and eventually they started
a fencing team at the
school.
"At first we were
stomped on," said Blevins,
"but then we started to do
well. And I really grew to
like fencing."
As a founder of his high
school team Blevins main
tains an interest in it."I like
to go back once in a while
to see if it's still running,"
he said.
"It has given me another
source of athletic recrea
tion that is special," said
Blevins. "It has allowed me
to be on a varsity team at
Stanford, and to work with
a great group of people."
The senior also noted
that he has transferred
