# Reagan library talk draws only one
## 
### 
The first of three scheduled fac
ulty discussions of the proposed
Reagan presidential library complex
at Stanford drew only one professor
yesterday.
Associate Medical School Prof.
Dorothy Huntington, the only
professor to show up, said she
opposed the complex because it
"promises to be a headache."
She spoke informally with the aca
demic secretary and four members
of the Faculty Senate, which had
scheduled the meetings to allow fac
ulty members to make their feelings
known on the issue.
Individual notices were not
mailed to faculty members. Other
meetings, open only to faculty
members and the media, will be
held today and tomorrow.
In other developments, Board
of Trustees President William Kim
ball said yesterday that the White
House has still not responded to a
Board request that it allow the three
elements of the proposal — library,
museum, and Hoover Institution
run center for public affairs — to be
considered separately rather than as
part of a package deal.
