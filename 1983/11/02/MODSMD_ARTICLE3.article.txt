# Activist condemns missiles
## German rallies support for Europe's peace movement 
### KATE WATERHOUSE 
A West German peace activist strongly opposed the
further deployment of nuclear missiles in Western
Europe in a speech last night in Haus Mitteleuropa.
Irene Eckert, a West German high school teacher,
said she is currently touring the United States to
"spread an understanding among the American people
about the concerns of the Europeans."
"I am part of a movement backed, actively backed,
by 300 million West German people," she said.
Eckert chose to take a leave of absence from teaching
to volunteer her time and energy to the peace move
ment, specifically the Women's International League
for Peace and Freedom in Geneva, Switzerland.
Last year, Eckert became president of the Berlin
chapter of the league before coming to the United
States.
"I first became interested," she said, "when I was
working for quite a time in a committee for peace
sponsored by the Protestant Church. The more I read
about this (the deployment), I became so scared, I can
not tell you. I felt I had to do something."
She further explained the reasons behind her ac
tivism.
"Once you become aware of it (the danger) you can't
live with it anymore," she said.
The Europeans have lived with the presence of nu
clear weapons on their soil since the late 19505. Eckert
traced the buildup of nuclear weapons since that time.

"First there was the Mutually Assured Destruction
(MAD) strategy," she said, referring to the Cold War
theory that if both superpowers massed enough nu
clear force to assure that conflict would produce no
winners then neither would push the button. "MAD
was developed to help prevent a nuclear war because it
would allow a nuclear balance between the super
powers.
"There is a balance right now, and this balance keeps
either side from attacking."
However, Eckert explained that current proposals to
deploy the new Nuclear Utilization Strategy are causing
this growth in the European peace movement.
"People are finally realizing that there's no reason for
more missiles," she said. "From a military strategist's
point of view, these missiles are not needed. If there is
a balance, there is a balance.
"We don't need anything more. We need to stop."
Eckert also cited the rise of participation in the peace
movement by all sectors of the society.
"The peace movement is not a socialist movement,"
she said. "It is a heterogenous movement united
toward the non-deployment of these dangerous nu
clear missiles."
Although the German peace movement is not a solid
front, all the different factions support one common
goal, Eckert said.
"There is a consensus on one question: we must not
allow the further deployment of these missiles."
