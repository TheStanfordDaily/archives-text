### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek
addressed the topic of moral sys
tems and their support of capitalism
at a speech yesterday in Stauffer
Auditorium.
Stressing the existence of a spon
taneous moral order, which man has
neither invented nor understood,
Hayek said, "No human mind ra
tionally invented our morals. Man
devised a system of order without
understanding it. We owe the
benefits of our morals not to our in
telligence, but to things that spread
without our approval."
Hayek, 83, who is an honorary
senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, was awarded the Nobel Prize in
Economics in 1974.
Born in Austria, Hayek studied
law, psychology and economics at
the University of Vienna after ser
ving in the Austrian army as an ar
tillery officer. He has taught at the
University of Chicago and the Lon
don School of Economics. He has
opposed the ideology of John
Maynard Keynes, a proponent of go

vernment intervention in the eco
nomy.
Hayek said that although man al
ways expresses dissatisfaction with
his morals, private property and
marriage are the two most important
aspects of a moral tradition that has
enabled man to increase and main
tain his population.
Hayek believes that our moral

code, although less than ideal, has
benefitted mankind as a whole.
"Morals keep us alive. Our morals
are materialistic, we resent them,
but are dependent upon them. If
abandoned, a large part of humanity
would die," he said.
Although Hayek believes
socialism offers superior morals, he
is an advocate of capitalism and the
free market. "Karl Marx was perfect
ly right" that capitalism causes une
qual distribution of income, he said,
but it is capitalism that has created a
condition of employment in which
we have thrived.
Explaining the guide function of
prices in a capitalist society, Hayek
said, "Prices tell people what they
must do."
Hayek also discussed the effects
of man's present moral code on his
immediate and long-range future.
"Our morals enable us to adapt our
selves to remote, unknown circum
stances in place and time. As our
moral order is indefinitely ex
tended, so our morals extend in
time â€” to effects we cannot see, or
perhaps accept," he said.
