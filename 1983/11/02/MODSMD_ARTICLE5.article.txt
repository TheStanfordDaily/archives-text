# Grenada protest
## Minorities fear more invasions 
### BRYCE LEE Staff writer 
Protest over the U.S. invasion of
Grenada continued here yesterday
when a coalition of black, Chicano
and Asian-American students held a
noon rally in White Plaza condemn
ing the action.
About 200 people turned out to
listen to eight speakers, represent
ing both students and faculty, ad
dress the "black community's
response to the invasion of
Grenada."
The principal speaker, junior
Simon Jones, linked the plight of the
blacks in Grenada to the freedom
movement in the United States by
arguing that blacks have historically
been mistreated.
"The U.S. invasion of Grenada
was morally wrong; the people of
Grenada should be able to decide
for themselves what type of gover
ment they want," Jones said. "I am
shocked by the audacity of the
United States (in invading Grenada)
and by their disregard for human
rights."
Jones added that the "excuses"
that the United States used as a
pretense for invading Grenada were
"hypocritical."
"The students were not in dan
ger," Jones said, concluding that
democracy cannot be restored
"with the butt of a gun."
Jones reiterated his fear of the
way Americans view Caribbean
citizens, adding that there "has al
ways been a general historic fear
that white people have of black
people."
"I fear the way the Americans
look at independent black countries
as a threat,"he said.
Faye Knox, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs, started the rally by
describing Reagan's Grenada policy

as "macho-type politics." She urged
people to wear red ribbons — which
were distributed during the rally
until the United States is out of
Grenada.
St. Claire Drake, emeritus profes
sor of anthropology and sociology,
addressed the international implica
tions of the invasion. Amid cheers
from the crowd, he demanded that
the United States "get out ot
Grenada."
Drake said that U.S. invasion was
only part of a larger policy designed
to obtain military bases in the south
em Caribbean.
"How can anyone in Washington
condone the actions, when every
one in the European community
repudiated the event?" Drake
asked.
"Let us not make (this invasion) a
dry run for Nicaragua ... Let the
Grenadians set up any government
they want, even if it is Marxist," he
said.
"The invasion is being called a
war against the Cubans. Don't buy
this line," Drake admonished, war
ning that the same reasoning can be
used as an excuse in the future to
invade other areas influenced by the
Cuban government. "We do not
want to see paratroopers and Rang
ers dropping down in Angola."
Mwesiga Baregu, a graduate stu
dent from the Caribbean, described
U.S. foreign policy as "gun-point
diplomacy," adding that he was dis
appointed with the public response
to the invasion.
Francis Wong, a member of the
Asian American Student Associa
tion, condemned the invasion,
describing the attitude of the United
States as "racist" and "arrogant
Wong warned that "the United
States is getting closer to war and
farther away from democracy."
