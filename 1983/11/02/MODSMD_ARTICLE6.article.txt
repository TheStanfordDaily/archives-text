Release of Cubans discussed
Bridgetown, Barbados — The Red Cross
negotiated with U.S. forces in Grenada yesterday
over how to evacuate 50 wounded and ill Cuban
prisoners while hundreds of Marines stormed a
nearby island in a fruitless hunt for resisters.
The Pentagon said the Marines found only a few
local residents on the Grenadian island of Carriacou,
20 miles north of Grenada, and withdrew later in the
day. Last week ham radio operators in the Caribbean
said Cuban and Grenadian holdouts had fled to Car
riacou to escape the invading Americans.
In the Grenadian capitol of St. George's, shoppers
crowded markets returning to normal despite the
week-old invasion, schools were open for a second

day and telephone workers toiled to restore normal
service.
Work crews pressed the search for people killed
when U.S. warplanes bombed a mental hospital last
week, killing as many as 20 patients. The United
States has said the bombing was accidental.
It was one of several accidents reported in the
Grenada invasion. Wounded army troops brought to
Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington have
said 19 comrades were wounded because a U.S.
plane inadvertently bombed their position instead
of an enemy target.
The Washington Post, quoting Pentagon sources it
did not identify, said several Army Rangers were
killed and several others wounded when two U.S.
helicopters collided and four Navy Seals in a com
mando unit drowned in a pre-invasion accident.

The Pentagon says 18 U.S. servicemen have been
killed, 86 wounded and one missing since the inva
sion. It has listed about 100 Cuban casualties without
specifying dead and wounded.
House invokes War Powers Act
Washington — The House called on President
Reagan yesterday to withdraw troops from Grenada
within 60 days as provided in the War Powers Act
which Congress passed during the Vietnam era to
prevent lengthy, undeclared wars.
The vote was 403-32.
The measure now goes to the Senate, where a
spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee said it is expected to be acted upon quickly.
The Senate passed an identical resolution last
Friday as an amendment to bill extending the nation

al debt limit so that the government could borrow
more money.
But on Monday, senators defeated the debt limit
measure, even though it could be reconsidered and
passed with or without a war powers provision.
President Reagan regards the 1973 War Powers Act
as an encroachment on his constitutional powers as
commander-in-chief, but it is not certain whether he
would veto or sign the bill if it reached his desk. A
White House spokeperson said last week a decision
would be made depending on the situation at the
time.
The war powers act requires that the president
withdraw troops within 60 days. That timetable
could be extended to 90 days if the president sa>
the extra time is needed to withdraw the troops saft
ly. Congress could also authorize a longer stay.
