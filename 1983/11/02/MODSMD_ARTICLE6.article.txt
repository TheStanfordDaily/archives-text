Release of Cubans discussed
Bridgetown, Barbados — The Red Cross
negotiated with U.S. forces in Grenada yesterday
over how to evacuate 50 wounded and ill Cuban
prisoners while hundreds of Marines stormed a
nearby island in a fruitless hunt for resisters.
The Pentagon said the Marines found only a few
local residents on the Grenadian island of Carriacou,
20 miles north of Grenada, and withdrew later in the
day. Last week ham radio operators in the Caribbean
said Cuban and Grenadian holdouts had fled to Car
riacou to escape the invading Americans.
In the Grenadian capitol of St. George's, shoppers
crowded markets returning to normal despite the
week-old invasion, schools were open for a second

day and telephone workers toiled to restore normal
service.
Work crews pressed the search for people killed
when U.S. warplanes bombed a mental hospital last
week, killing as many as 20 patients. The United
States has said the bombing was accidental.
It was one of several accidents reported in the
Grenada invasion. Wounded army troops brought to
Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington have
said 19 comrades were wounded because a U.S.
plane inadvertently bombed their position instead
of an enemy target.
The Washington Post, quoting Pentagon sources it
did not identify, said several Army Rangers were
killed and several others wounded when two U.S.
helicopters collided and four Navy Seals in a com
mando unit drowned in a pre-invasion accident.

The Pentagon says 18 U.S. servicemen have been
killed, 86 wounded and one missing since the inva
sion. It has listed about 100 Cuban casualties without
specifying dead and wounded.
House invokes War Powers Act
Washington — The House called on President
Reagan yesterday to withdraw troops from Grenada
within 60 days as provided in the War Powers Act
which Congress passed during the Vietnam era to
prevent lengthy, undeclared wars.
The vote was 403-32.
The measure now goes to the Senate, where a
spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee said it is expected to be acted upon quickly.
The Senate passed an identical resolution last
Friday as an amendment to bill extending the nation

al debt limit so that the government could borrow
more money.
But on Monday, senators defeated the debt limit
measure, even though it could be reconsidered and
passed with or without a war powers provision.
President Reagan regards the 1973 War Powers Act
as an encroachment on his constitutional powers as
commander-in-chief, but it is not certain whether he
would veto or sign the bill if it reached his desk. A
White House spokeperson said last week a decision
would be made depending on the situation at the
time.
The war powers act requires that the president
withdraw troops within 60 days. That timetable
could be extended to 90 days if the president sa>
the extra time is needed to withdraw the troops saft
ly. Congress could also authorize a longer stay.
In a preliminary debate in the House Monday, Rep. Cle
ment Zablocki, (D-Wisc), chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said, "The president's decision to
ignore the War Powers Resolution ignored also the realities
of the situation in Grenada."
Zablocki said the resolution was not intended to reflect
on "the rights or wrongs" of the invasion but to declare
that U.S. troops have been sent into hostilities and the war
powers act must be obeyed.
Commonwealth may send troops
London — Commonwealth Secretary General Dir
Shridath Kamphal said yesterday that he has received offers
of assistance from more than enough of the member states
to enable a commonwealth force to replace U.S. troops in
Grenada within a matter of weeks.
Kamphal stressed in an interview that the precise role
and composition of such a force would depend on the
needs of the Grenadians and that it would only be sent
when the security situation on the island permits. "We
want to be ready when the time comes," he said.
He spoke in terms of 500 to 1000, probably organized
along paramilitary or police lines, but definitely not to be
called a "peacekeeping" force because of the implication
that it might be drawn into fighting. That risk would be un
acceptable to most Commonwealth states, he said, adding
that the cost of the force would be borne by the Common
wealth participants.
The Commonwealth of former British colonies, including
Grenada, is a loose confederation of states rather than a
formal alliance. It has assisted on several other occasions
when one of its members was in trouble. In recent years, it
has supervised elections after civil strife in Zimbabwe and
Uganda, where an eight-nation military training team is still
active.
After canvassing among the Commonwealth's 48 mem
bers, Kamphal said an early American withdrawal is an es
sential precondition as it is a commitment by the Grenadian
authorities — meaning the governor general, Sir Paul
Scoon — to "a genuine return to constitutional govern
ment and elections." He said he had talked to Scoon three
times in recent days and believed the political assurances
were no problem.
However, Kamphal said he has no idea of American in
tentions because despite his taking a visible part of the ef
fort to set up a mechanism for returning Grenada to demo
cratic rule, no U.S. official has approached him. Aside from
exchanging a few words with American diplomats at a din
ner last week Kamphal said, he has had no contacts indica
ting U.S. interest in a Commonwealth presence.
Syrians warn Lebanese
Geneva, Switzerland — Syria demanded at the Lebanese
national reconciliation conference yesterday that Lebanon
cancel its May 1 agreement with Israel and recognize spe
cial security interests of Damascus in that war-devasted na
tion.
Speaking at the second session of the historic meeting of
Beirut's leading Moslem and Christian leaders, Syrian
Foreign Minister Hbdel Halim Khaddam reportedly said
Syria could not accept that Israel become the protector of
Lebanon. He said its independence was "vital and strate
gic" to Syria's independence and security..
The Syrian official, here in theory as only an observer,
was reported to have made the same points in even blunter
terms during a one-hour meeting with President Amin

Gemayel, the first contact between the Lebanese leader
and a high-ranking Syrian in seven months.
The meeting, in a suite adjacent to the main conference
room on the 18th floor of the Intercontinental Hotel, was
the highlight of the second day of the Lebanese "national
dialogue," and was widely interpreted as an indication of
Syrian determination to make the May 1 accord a major
issue here.
Both Gemayel and the leader of the Phalangist-led
Lebanese Front, former president Camille Chamoun, were
said to have challenged Khaddam to offer the Lebanese a
better alternative to the accord as a means of getting the Is
raelis to evacuate their country.
According to one version of his reply, Gemayel asked,
"Do you think you are more attached to Lebanon's inde
pendence than i am."
"Help us find a way out, instead of creating obstacles,"
he reportedly said. Chamoun was said to have been even
more openly defiant, retorting that if Syria had no alterna
tive and Lebanon did not accept the accord, "the fate of the
south would be sealed like the fate of the (Syrian) Golan
Heights" which have become "part and parcel of Israel."
Postal Service approves rate increase
Washington — In a move that would raise the cost of a
first-class stamp to 23 cents next fall, the board of gover
nors of the U.S. Postal Service voted 5-3 yesterday to seek a
15.4 percent general postal rate increase.
To take effect, the increase must be approved by the in
dependent Postal Rate Commission following detailed
hearings that are expected to last about 10 months. If the
commission concurs, the boost would be the sixth
imposed since Congress established the Postal Service in
1970 under a mandate to make revenues from rates recover
the cost of each class of mail. The first increase, in 1971,
raised the price of a first-class stamp from six cents to
eights cents. Currently, a first-class stamp costs 20 cents.
Robert Hardesty, chairman of the Postal Service board,
said the decision was taken because the postal system,
after operating for more than three years in the black, once
again is running in the red. He said preliminary data of the
last 28 days of September, the final reporting period for fis
cal 1983, showed a $90 million deficit. Although the service
will report a surplus of about $606 million for all of fiscal
1983, an $800 million deficit is indicated for fiscal 1984, Har
desty said.
"Three and a half years of rising costs have caught up
with us... without a rate increase, our operating losses
during fiscal 1985 could exceed $2.3 billion," Hardesty
predicted.
Postmaster General William Bolger noted that consumer
prices have rise about 25 percent since the postal service
file for the 20-cent-first-class rate in April 1980, while the
proposed new increase would boost first-class rates only
15.9 percent.
"I still think that 23 cents is going to be a bargain to mail a
letter," Bolger said.
Bolger told reporters that the postal board will submit its
formal request to the rate commission "by Nov. 10 at the
latest" and thereby will get the hearing process under way.
Hardesty predicted "there will be no rate increase until
Oct. 1, 1984, at the earliest" and denied a reporter's sug
gestion that the close vote on the board indicated opposi
tion to the increase.
Six navy men die in fire
San Diego — Six men died and 35 suffered minor injuries
in a fire in the engineering spaces of the aircraft carrier USS
Ranger as it operated in the Arabian Sea, the Navy said yes
terday.
It was the worst Navy accident in two years, and the
second fatal incident aboard the 1071-foot Ranger since
July.

The fire broke out at 9:50 p.m. PST on Monday, and was
extinguished within an hour, said Lt. Cmdr. Tom
Jurkowsky, in San Diego where the ship is based.
The names of the dead were not immediately released,
pending notification of their relatives.
Clark keeps mum
Washington — Interior Secretary-designate William Clark
refused yesterday to assess the performance of his
predecessor, lames Watt, saying Watt and other former
secretaries "don't work here anymore."
But Clark, testifying at his Senate confirmation hearing,
also offered no promise of change in Watt's controversial
policies. He said his orders from the president are simply to
evaluate those policies.
I didn't think it's fair for me to sit and judge the job of
Secretary Watt or any of the other secretaries before him,"
Clark told the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
To use the vernacular, they don't work here anymore.
But that should in no way suggest that there is going to
be change in any particular area," he added.
"My mandate is from President Reagan," Clark said. "I
take my direction from President Reagan. I communicate
back to President Reagan. And President Reagan has asked
me to evaluate . . . I'm making no announcements on any
changes of policy other than announcing that the president
has directed me to review policies."
Reagan eases Poland stance
Washington — President Reagan has approved
renegotiating a portion of the massive debt Poland owes to
the United States and its European allies, but will maintain
most other economic sanctions imposed on Poland two
years ago, administration officials said yesterday.
The decision, scheduled to be announced today by the
State Department, will set the stage for a meeting in Paris
on Nov. 16 and 17 between treasury officials from Poland
and a 14 other nations who collectively are owed a total of
more than $16 billion by the Polish government.
White House officials said yesterday that Reagan remains
opposed to allowing Poland to receive economic assistance
from the International Monetary Fund and was displeased
at the human rights record of the Soviet-backed regime.
"In view of Poland's lack of progress, the president
remains firm that no new credit should be extended to
Poland," one official said.
He said that a ban will continue against Polish airline lan
ding rights in this country and that a prohibition on eco
nomic and high-technology aid will remain in place.
What will be renegotiated in Paris is the 1981 Polish debt,
totaling $11 billion in all and $420 million to the United
States. Poland had agreed to pay the United States $42 mil
lion of that debt, but still owed $28 million of that payment
when martial law was imposed in December, 1981, and the
free trade union Solidarity was outlawed.
Stock market mixed
New York — The stock market turned in a mixed perfor
mance yesterday, aided by a late rally among glamour is
sues that derailed a broad retreat.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 1.72 points
Monday, added another 4.07 to close at 1229.27. The blue
chip average had been down more than 4 points as the final
hour of trading began and recovered from a loss of more
than 9 points halfway through the session.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy with highs in the 60s. Tonight and tomor
row: Fair with local night and morning fog. Lows in the 40s
or low 50s. Highs from the mid 60s to the low 70s.

Speaking at the second session of the historic meeting of
Beirut's leading Moslem and Christian leaders, Syrian
Foreign Minister Hbdel Halim Khaddam reportedly said
Syria could not accept that Israel become the protector of
Lebanon. He said its independence was "vital and strate
gic" to Syria's independence and security..
The Syrian official, here in theory as only an observer,
was reported to have made the same points in even blunter
terms during a one-hour meeting with President Amin

Gemayel, the first contact between the Lebanese leader
and a high-ranking Syrian in seven months.
The meeting, in a suite adjacent to the main conference
room on the 18th floor of the Intercontinental Hotel, was
the highlight of the second day of the Lebanese "national
dialogue," and was widely interpreted as an indication of
Syrian determination to make the May 1 accord a major
issue here.
Both Gemayel and the leader of the Phalangist-led
Lebanese Front, former president Camille Chamoun, were
said to have challenged Khaddam to offer the Lebanese a
better alternative to the accord as a means of getting the Is
raelis to evacuate their country.
According to one version of his reply, Gemayel asked,
"Do you think you are more attached to Lebanon's inde
pendence than i am."
"Help us find a way out, instead of creating obstacles,"
he reportedly said. Chamoun was said to have been even
more openly defiant, retorting that if Syria had no alterna
tive and Lebanon did not accept the accord, "the fate of the
south would be sealed like the fate of the (Syrian) Golan
Heights" which have become "part and parcel of Israel."
Postal Service approves rate increase
Washington — In a move that would raise the cost of a
first-class stamp to 23 cents next fall, the board of gover
nors of the U.S. Postal Service voted 5-3 yesterday to seek a
15.4 percent general postal rate increase.
To take effect, the increase must be approved by the in
dependent Postal Rate Commission following detailed
hearings that are expected to last about 10 months. If the
commission concurs, the boost would be the sixth
imposed since Congress established the Postal Service in
1970 under a mandate to make revenues from rates recover
the cost of each class of mail. The first increase, in 1971,
raised the price of a first-class stamp from six cents to
eights cents. Currently, a first-class stamp costs 20 cents.
Robert Hardesty, chairman of the Postal Service board,
said the decision was taken because the postal system,
after operating for more than three years in the black, once
again is running in the red. He said preliminary data of the
last 28 days of September, the final reporting period for fis
cal 1983, showed a $90 million deficit. Although the service
will report a surplus of about $606 million for all of fiscal
1983, an $800 million deficit is indicated for fiscal 1984, Har
desty said.
"Three and a half years of rising costs have caught up
with us... without a rate increase, our operating losses
during fiscal 1985 could exceed $2.3 billion," Hardesty
predicted.
Postmaster General William Bolger noted that consumer
prices have rise about 25 percent since the postal service
file for the 20-cent-first-class rate in April 1980, while the
proposed new increase would boost first-class rates only
15.9 percent.
"I still think that 23 cents is going to be a bargain to mail a
letter," Bolger said.
Bolger told reporters that the postal board will submit its
formal request to the rate commission "by Nov. 10 at the
latest" and thereby will get the hearing process under way.
Hardesty predicted "there will be no rate increase until
Oct. 1, 1984, at the earliest" and denied a reporter's sug
gestion that the close vote on the board indicated opposi
tion to the increase.
Six navy men die in fire
San Diego — Six men died and 35 suffered minor injuries
in a fire in the engineering spaces of the aircraft carrier USS
Ranger as it operated in the Arabian Sea, the Navy said yes
terday.
It was the worst Navy accident in two years, and the
second fatal incident aboard the 1071-foot Ranger since
July.

The fire broke out at 9:50 p.m. PST on Monday, and was
extinguished within an hour, said Lt. Cmdr. Tom
Jurkowsky, in San Diego where the ship is based.
The names of the dead were not immediately released,
pending notification of their relatives.

To use the vernacular, they don't work here anymore.
But that should in no way suggest that there is going to

"My mandate is from President Reagan," Clark said. "I

changes of policy other than announcing that the president
has directed me to review policies."
Reagan eases Poland stance
Washington — President Reagan has approved
renegotiating a portion of the massive debt Poland owes to
the United States and its European allies, but will maintain
most other economic sanctions imposed on Poland two
years ago, administration officials said yesterday.
The decision, scheduled to be announced today by the
State Department, will set the stage for a meeting in Paris
on Nov. 16 and 17 between treasury officials from Poland
and a 14 other nations who collectively are owed a total of
more than $16 billion by the Polish government.
White House officials said yesterday that Reagan remains
opposed to allowing Poland to receive economic assistance
from the International Monetary Fund and was displeased
at the human rights record of the Soviet-backed regime.
"In view of Poland's lack of progress, the president
remains firm that no new credit should be extended to
Poland," one official said.
He said that a ban will continue against Polish airline lan
ding rights in this country and that a prohibition on eco
nomic and high-technology aid will remain in place.
What will be renegotiated in Paris is the 1981 Polish debt,
totaling $11 billion in all and $420 million to the United
States. Poland had agreed to pay the United States $42 mil
lion of that debt, but still owed $28 million of that payment
when martial law was imposed in December, 1981, and the
free trade union Solidarity was outlawed.
Stock market mixed
New York — The stock market turned in a mixed perfor

Release of Cubans discussed
Bridgetown, Barbados — The Red Cross
negotiated with U.S. forces in Grenada yesterday
over how to evacuate 50 wounded and ill Cuban
prisoners while hundreds of Marines stormed a
nearby island in a fruitless hunt for resisters.
The Pentagon said the Marines found only a few
local residents on the Grenadian island of Carriacou,
20 miles north of Grenada, and withdrew later in the
day. Last week ham radio operators in the Caribbean
said Cuban and Grenadian holdouts had fled to Car
riacou to escape the invading Americans.
In the Grenadian capitol of St. George's, shoppers
crowded markets returning to normal despite the
week-old invasion, schools were open for a second

day and telephone workers toiled to restore normal
service.
Work crews pressed the search for people killed
when U.S. warplanes bombed a mental hospital last
week, killing as many as 20 patients. The United
States has said the bombing was accidental.
It was one of several accidents reported in the
Grenada invasion. Wounded army troops brought to
Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington have
said 19 comrades were wounded because a U.S.
plane inadvertently bombed their position instead
of an enemy target.
The Washington Post, quoting Pentagon sources it
did not identify, said several Army Rangers were
killed and several others wounded when two U.S.
helicopters collided and four Navy Seals in a com
mando unit drowned in a pre-invasion accident.

The Pentagon says 18 U.S. servicemen have been
killed, 86 wounded and one missing since the inva
sion. It has listed about 100 Cuban casualties without
specifying dead and wounded.
House invokes War Powers Act
Washington — The House called on President
Reagan yesterday to withdraw troops from Grenada
within 60 days as provided in the War Powers Act
which Congress passed during the Vietnam era to
prevent lengthy, undeclared wars.
The vote was 403-32.
The measure now goes to the Senate, where a
spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee said it is expected to be acted upon quickly.
The Senate passed an identical resolution last
Friday as an amendment to bill extending the nation

al debt limit so that the government could borrow
more money.
But on Monday, senators defeated the debt limit
measure, even though it could be reconsidered and
passed with or without a war powers provision.
President Reagan regards the 1973 War Powers Act
as an encroachment on his constitutional powers as
commander-in-chief, but it is not certain whether he
would veto or sign the bill if it reached his desk. A
White House spokeperson said last week a decision
would be made depending on the situation at the
time.
The war powers act requires that the president
withdraw troops within 60 days. That timetable
could be extended to 90 days if the president sa>
the extra time is needed to withdraw the troops saft
ly. Congress could also authorize a longer stay.
In a preliminary debate in the House Monday, Rep. Cle
ment Zablocki, (D-Wisc), chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said, "The president's decision to
ignore the War Powers Resolution ignored also the realities
of the situation in Grenada."
Zablocki said the resolution was not intended to reflect
on "the rights or wrongs" of the invasion but to declare
that U.S. troops have been sent into hostilities and the war
powers act must be obeyed.
Commonwealth may send troops
London — Commonwealth Secretary General Dir
Shridath Kamphal said yesterday that he has received offers
of assistance from more than enough of the member states
to enable a commonwealth force to replace U.S. troops in
Grenada within a matter of weeks.
Kamphal stressed in an interview that the precise role
and composition of such a force would depend on the
needs of the Grenadians and that it would only be sent
when the security situation on the island permits. "We
want to be ready when the time comes," he said.
He spoke in terms of 500 to 1000, probably organized
along paramilitary or police lines, but definitely not to be
called a "peacekeeping" force because of the implication
that it might be drawn into fighting. That risk would be un
acceptable to most Commonwealth states, he said, adding
that the cost of the force would be borne by the Common
wealth participants.
The Commonwealth of former British colonies, including
Grenada, is a loose confederation of states rather than a
formal alliance. It has assisted on several other occasions
when one of its members was in trouble. In recent years, it
has supervised elections after civil strife in Zimbabwe and
Uganda, where an eight-nation military training team is still
active.
After canvassing among the Commonwealth's 48 mem
bers, Kamphal said an early American withdrawal is an es
sential precondition as it is a commitment by the Grenadian
authorities — meaning the governor general, Sir Paul
Scoon — to "a genuine return to constitutional govern
ment and elections." He said he had talked to Scoon three
times in recent days and believed the political assurances
were no problem.
However, Kamphal said he has no idea of American in
tentions because despite his taking a visible part of the ef
fort to set up a mechanism for returning Grenada to demo
cratic rule, no U.S. official has approached him. Aside from
exchanging a few words with American diplomats at a din
ner last week Kamphal said, he has had no contacts indica
ting U.S. interest in a Commonwealth presence.

Reagan eases Poland stance
Washington — President Reagan has approved
renegotiating a portion of the massive debt Poland owes to
the United States and its European allies, but will maintain
most other economic sanctions imposed on Poland two
years ago, administration officials said yesterday.
The decision, scheduled to be announced today by the
State Department, will set the stage for a meeting in Paris
on Nov. 16 and 17 between treasury officials from Poland
and a 14 other nations who collectively are owed a total of
more than $16 billion by the Polish government.
White House officials said yesterday that Reagan remains
opposed to allowing Poland to receive economic assistance
from the International Monetary Fund and was displeased
at the human rights record of the Soviet-backed regime.
"In view of Poland's lack of progress, the president
remains firm that no new credit should be extended to
Poland," one official said.
He said that a ban will continue against Polish airline lan
ding rights in this country and that a prohibition on eco
nomic and high-technology aid will remain in place.
What will be renegotiated in Paris is the 1981 Polish debt,
totaling $11 billion in all and $420 million to the United
States. Poland had agreed to pay the United States $42 mil
lion of that debt, but still owed $28 million of that payment
when martial law was imposed in December, 1981, and the
free trade union Solidarity was outlawed.

Release of Cubans discussed
Bridgetown, Barbados — The Red Cross
negotiated with U.S. forces in Grenada yesterday
over how to evacuate 50 wounded and ill Cuban
prisoners while hundreds of Marines stormed a
nearby island in a fruitless hunt for resisters.
The Pentagon said the Marines found only a few
local residents on the Grenadian island of Carriacou,
20 miles north of Grenada, and withdrew later in the
day. Last week ham radio operators in the Caribbean
said Cuban and Grenadian holdouts had fled to Car
riacou to escape the invading Americans.
In the Grenadian capitol of St. George's, shoppers
crowded markets returning to normal despite the
week-old invasion, schools were open for a second

day and telephone workers toiled to restore normal
service.
Work crews pressed the search for people killed
when U.S. warplanes bombed a mental hospital last
week, killing as many as 20 patients. The United
States has said the bombing was accidental.
It was one of several accidents reported in the
Grenada invasion. Wounded army troops brought to
Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington have
said 19 comrades were wounded because a U.S.
plane inadvertently bombed their position instead
of an enemy target.
The Washington Post, quoting Pentagon sources it
did not identify, said several Army Rangers were
killed and several others wounded when two U.S.
helicopters collided and four Navy Seals in a com
mando unit drowned in a pre-invasion accident.

The Pentagon says 18 U.S. servicemen have been
killed, 86 wounded and one missing since the inva
sion. It has listed about 100 Cuban casualties without
specifying dead and wounded.
House invokes War Powers Act
Washington — The House called on President
Reagan yesterday to withdraw troops from Grenada
within 60 days as provided in the War Powers Act
which Congress passed during the Vietnam era to
prevent lengthy, undeclared wars.
The vote was 403-32.
The measure now goes to the Senate, where a
spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee said it is expected to be acted upon quickly.
The Senate passed an identical resolution last
Friday as an amendment to bill extending the nation

al debt limit so that the government could borrow
more money.
But on Monday, senators defeated the debt limit
measure, even though it could be reconsidered and
passed with or without a war powers provision.
President Reagan regards the 1973 War Powers Act
as an encroachment on his constitutional powers as
commander-in-chief, but it is not certain whether he
would veto or sign the bill if it reached his desk. A
White House spokeperson said last week a decision
would be made depending on the situation at the
time.
The war powers act requires that the president
withdraw troops within 60 days. That timetable
could be extended to 90 days if the president sa>
the extra time is needed to withdraw the troops saft
ly. Congress could also authorize a longer stay.
In a preliminary debate in the House Monday, Rep. Cle
ment Zablocki, (D-Wisc), chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said, "The president's decision to
ignore the War Powers Resolution ignored also the realities
of the situation in Grenada."
Zablocki said the resolution was not intended to reflect
on "the rights or wrongs" of the invasion but to declare
that U.S. troops have been sent into hostilities and the war
powers act must be obeyed.
Commonwealth may send troops
London — Commonwealth Secretary General Dir
Shridath Kamphal said yesterday that he has received offers
of assistance from more than enough of the member states
to enable a commonwealth force to replace U.S. troops in
Grenada within a matter of weeks.
Kamphal stressed in an interview that the precise role
and composition of such a force would depend on the
needs of the Grenadians and that it would only be sent
when the security situation on the island permits. "We
want to be ready when the time comes," he said.
He spoke in terms of 500 to 1000, probably organized
along paramilitary or police lines, but definitely not to be
called a "peacekeeping" force because of the implication
that it might be drawn into fighting. That risk would be un
acceptable to most Commonwealth states, he said, adding
that the cost of the force would be borne by the Common
wealth participants.
The Commonwealth of former British colonies, including
Grenada, is a loose confederation of states rather than a
formal alliance. It has assisted on several other occasions
when one of its members was in trouble. In recent years, it
has supervised elections after civil strife in Zimbabwe and
Uganda, where an eight-nation military training team is still
active.
After canvassing among the Commonwealth's 48 mem
bers, Kamphal said an early American withdrawal is an es
sential precondition as it is a commitment by the Grenadian
authorities — meaning the governor general, Sir Paul
Scoon — to "a genuine return to constitutional govern
ment and elections." He said he had talked to Scoon three
times in recent days and believed the political assurances
were no problem.
However, Kamphal said he has no idea of American in
tentions because despite his taking a visible part of the ef
fort to set up a mechanism for returning Grenada to demo
cratic rule, no U.S. official has approached him. Aside from
exchanging a few words with American diplomats at a din
ner last week Kamphal said, he has had no contacts indica
ting U.S. interest in a Commonwealth presence.
Syrians warn Lebanese
Geneva, Switzerland — Syria demanded at the Lebanese
national reconciliation conference yesterday that Lebanon
cancel its May 1 agreement with Israel and recognize spe
cial security interests of Damascus in that war-devasted na
tion.
Speaking at the second session of the historic meeting of
Beirut's leading Moslem and Christian leaders, Syrian
Foreign Minister Hbdel Halim Khaddam reportedly said
Syria could not accept that Israel become the protector of
Lebanon. He said its independence was "vital and strate
gic" to Syria's independence and security..
The Syrian official, here in theory as only an observer,
was reported to have made the same points in even blunter
terms during a one-hour meeting with President Amin

Gemayel, the first contact between the Lebanese leader
and a high-ranking Syrian in seven months.
The meeting, in a suite adjacent to the main conference
room on the 18th floor of the Intercontinental Hotel, was
the highlight of the second day of the Lebanese "national
dialogue," and was widely interpreted as an indication of
Syrian determination to make the May 1 accord a major
issue here.
Both Gemayel and the leader of the Phalangist-led
Lebanese Front, former president Camille Chamoun, were
said to have challenged Khaddam to offer the Lebanese a
better alternative to the accord as a means of getting the Is
raelis to evacuate their country.
According to one version of his reply, Gemayel asked,
"Do you think you are more attached to Lebanon's inde
pendence than i am."
"Help us find a way out, instead of creating obstacles,"
he reportedly said. Chamoun was said to have been even
more openly defiant, retorting that if Syria had no alterna
tive and Lebanon did not accept the accord, "the fate of the
south would be sealed like the fate of the (Syrian) Golan
Heights" which have become "part and parcel of Israel."
Postal Service approves rate increase
Washington — In a move that would raise the cost of a
first-class stamp to 23 cents next fall, the board of gover
nors of the U.S. Postal Service voted 5-3 yesterday to seek a
15.4 percent general postal rate increase.
To take effect, the increase must be approved by the in
dependent Postal Rate Commission following detailed
hearings that are expected to last about 10 months. If the
commission concurs, the boost would be the sixth
imposed since Congress established the Postal Service in
1970 under a mandate to make revenues from rates recover
the cost of each class of mail. The first increase, in 1971,
raised the price of a first-class stamp from six cents to
eights cents. Currently, a first-class stamp costs 20 cents.
Robert Hardesty, chairman of the Postal Service board,
said the decision was taken because the postal system,
after operating for more than three years in the black, once
again is running in the red. He said preliminary data of the
last 28 days of September, the final reporting period for fis
cal 1983, showed a $90 million deficit. Although the service
will report a surplus of about $606 million for all of fiscal
1983, an $800 million deficit is indicated for fiscal 1984, Har
desty said.
"Three and a half years of rising costs have caught up
with us... without a rate increase, our operating losses
during fiscal 1985 could exceed $2.3 billion," Hardesty
predicted.
Postmaster General William Bolger noted that consumer
prices have rise about 25 percent since the postal service
file for the 20-cent-first-class rate in April 1980, while the
proposed new increase would boost first-class rates only
15.9 percent.
"I still think that 23 cents is going to be a bargain to mail a
letter," Bolger said.
Bolger told reporters that the postal board will submit its
formal request to the rate commission "by Nov. 10 at the
latest" and thereby will get the hearing process under way.
Hardesty predicted "there will be no rate increase until
Oct. 1, 1984, at the earliest" and denied a reporter's sug
gestion that the close vote on the board indicated opposi
tion to the increase.
Six navy men die in fire
San Diego — Six men died and 35 suffered minor injuries
in a fire in the engineering spaces of the aircraft carrier USS
Ranger as it operated in the Arabian Sea, the Navy said yes
terday.
It was the worst Navy accident in two years, and the
second fatal incident aboard the 1071-foot Ranger since
July.

The fire broke out at 9:50 p.m. PST on Monday, and was
extinguished within an hour, said Lt. Cmdr. Tom
Jurkowsky, in San Diego where the ship is based.
The names of the dead were not immediately released,
pending notification of their relatives.
Clark keeps mum
Washington — Interior Secretary-designate William Clark
refused yesterday to assess the performance of his
predecessor, lames Watt, saying Watt and other former
secretaries "don't work here anymore."
But Clark, testifying at his Senate confirmation hearing,
also offered no promise of change in Watt's controversial
policies. He said his orders from the president are simply to
evaluate those policies.
I didn't think it's fair for me to sit and judge the job of
Secretary Watt or any of the other secretaries before him,"
Clark told the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
To use the vernacular, they don't work here anymore.
But that should in no way suggest that there is going to
be change in any particular area," he added.
"My mandate is from President Reagan," Clark said. "I
take my direction from President Reagan. I communicate
back to President Reagan. And President Reagan has asked
me to evaluate . . . I'm making no announcements on any
changes of policy other than announcing that the president
has directed me to review policies."

London — Commonwealth Secretary General Dir
Shridath Kamphal said yesterday that he has received offers
of assistance from more than enough of the member states
to enable a commonwealth force to replace U.S. troops in
Grenada within a matter of weeks.
Kamphal stressed in an interview that the precise role
and composition of such a force would depend on the
needs of the Grenadians and that it would only be sent
when the security situation on the island permits. "We
want to be ready when the time comes," he said.
He spoke in terms of 500 to 1000, probably organized
along paramilitary or police lines, but definitely not to be
called a "peacekeeping" force because of the implication
that it might be drawn into fighting. That risk would be un
acceptable to most Commonwealth states, he said, adding
that the cost of the force would be borne by the Common
wealth participants.
The Commonwealth of former British colonies, including
Grenada, is a loose confederation of states rather than a
formal alliance. It has assisted on several other occasions
when one of its members was in trouble. In recent years, it
has supervised elections after civil strife in Zimbabwe and
Uganda, where an eight-nation military training team is still
active.
After canvassing among the Commonwealth's 48 mem
bers, Kamphal said an early American withdrawal is an es
sential precondition as it is a commitment by the Grenadian
authorities — meaning the governor general, Sir Paul
Scoon — to "a genuine return to constitutional govern
ment and elections." He said he had talked to Scoon three
times in recent days and believed the political assurances
were no problem.
However, Kamphal said he has no idea of American in
tentions because despite his taking a visible part of the ef
fort to set up a mechanism for returning Grenada to demo
cratic rule, no U.S. official has approached him. Aside from
exchanging a few words with American diplomats at a din
ner last week Kamphal said, he has had no contacts indica
ting U.S. interest in a Commonwealth presence.
Syrians warn Lebanese
Geneva, Switzerland — Syria demanded at the Lebanese
national reconciliation conference yesterday that Lebanon
cancel its May 1 agreement with Israel and recognize spe
cial security interests of Damascus in that war-devasted na
tion.
Speaking at the second session of the historic meeting of
Beirut's leading Moslem and Christian leaders, Syrian
Foreign Minister Hbdel Halim Khaddam reportedly said
Syria could not accept that Israel become the protector of
Lebanon. He said its independence was "vital and strate
gic" to Syria's independence and security..
The Syrian official, here in theory as only an observer,
was reported to have made the same points in even blunter
terms during a one-hour meeting with President Amin

Gemayel, the first contact between the Lebanese leader
and a high-ranking Syrian in seven months.
The meeting, in a suite adjacent to the main conference
room on the 18th floor of the Intercontinental Hotel, was
the highlight of the second day of the Lebanese "national
dialogue," and was widely interpreted as an indication of
Syrian determination to make the May 1 accord a major
issue here.
Both Gemayel and the leader of the Phalangist-led
Lebanese Front, former president Camille Chamoun, were
said to have challenged Khaddam to offer the Lebanese a
better alternative to the accord as a means of getting the Is
raelis to evacuate their country.
According to one version of his reply, Gemayel asked,
"Do you think you are more attached to Lebanon's inde
pendence than i am."
"Help us find a way out, instead of creating obstacles,"
he reportedly said. Chamoun was said to have been even
more openly defiant, retorting that if Syria had no alterna
tive and Lebanon did not accept the accord, "the fate of the
south would be sealed like the fate of the (Syrian) Golan
Heights" which have become "part and parcel of Israel."
Postal Service approves rate increase
Washington — In a move that would raise the cost of a
first-class stamp to 23 cents next fall, the board of gover
nors of the U.S. Postal Service voted 5-3 yesterday to seek a
15.4 percent general postal rate increase.
To take effect, the increase must be approved by the in
dependent Postal Rate Commission following detailed
hearings that are expected to last about 10 months. If the
commission concurs, the boost would be the sixth
imposed since Congress established the Postal Service in
1970 under a mandate to make revenues from rates recover
the cost of each class of mail. The first increase, in 1971,
raised the price of a first-class stamp from six cents to
eights cents. Currently, a first-class stamp costs 20 cents.
Robert Hardesty, chairman of the Postal Service board,
said the decision was taken because the postal system,
after operating for more than three years in the black, once
again is running in the red. He said preliminary data of the
last 28 days of September, the final reporting period for fis
cal 1983, showed a $90 million deficit. Although the service
will report a surplus of about $606 million for all of fiscal
1983, an $800 million deficit is indicated for fiscal 1984, Har
desty said.
"Three and a half years of rising costs have caught up
with us... without a rate increase, our operating losses
during fiscal 1985 could exceed $2.3 billion," Hardesty
predicted.
Postmaster General William Bolger noted that consumer
prices have rise about 25 percent since the postal service
file for the 20-cent-first-class rate in April 1980, while the
proposed new increase would boost first-class rates only
15.9 percent.
"I still think that 23 cents is going to be a bargain to mail a
letter," Bolger said.
Bolger told reporters that the postal board will submit its
formal request to the rate commission "by Nov. 10 at the
latest" and thereby will get the hearing process under way.
Hardesty predicted "there will be no rate increase until
Oct. 1, 1984, at the earliest" and denied a reporter's sug
gestion that the close vote on the board indicated opposi
tion to the increase.
Six navy men die in fire
San Diego — Six men died and 35 suffered minor injuries
in a fire in the engineering spaces of the aircraft carrier USS
Ranger as it operated in the Arabian Sea, the Navy said yes
terday.
It was the worst Navy accident in two years, and the
second fatal incident aboard the 1071-foot Ranger since
July.

The fire broke out at 9:50 p.m. PST on Monday, and was
extinguished within an hour, said Lt. Cmdr. Tom
Jurkowsky, in San Diego where the ship is based.
The names of the dead were not immediately released,
pending notification of their relatives.
Clark keeps mum
Washington — Interior Secretary-designate William Clark
refused yesterday to assess the performance of his
predecessor, lames Watt, saying Watt and other former
secretaries "don't work here anymore."
But Clark, testifying at his Senate confirmation hearing,
also offered no promise of change in Watt's controversial
policies. He said his orders from the president are simply to
evaluate those policies.
I didn't think it's fair for me to sit and judge the job of
Secretary Watt or any of the other secretaries before him,"
Clark told the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
To use the vernacular, they don't work here anymore.
But that should in no way suggest that there is going to
be change in any particular area," he added.
"My mandate is from President Reagan," Clark said. "I
take my direction from President Reagan. I communicate
back to President Reagan. And President Reagan has asked
me to evaluate . . . I'm making no announcements on any
changes of policy other than announcing that the president
has directed me to review policies."
Reagan eases Poland stance
Washington — President Reagan has approved
renegotiating a portion of the massive debt Poland owes to
the United States and its European allies, but will maintain
most other economic sanctions imposed on Poland two
years ago, administration officials said yesterday.
The decision, scheduled to be announced today by the
State Department, will set the stage for a meeting in Paris
on Nov. 16 and 17 between treasury officials from Poland
and a 14 other nations who collectively are owed a total of
more than $16 billion by the Polish government.
White House officials said yesterday that Reagan remains
opposed to allowing Poland to receive economic assistance
from the International Monetary Fund and was displeased
at the human rights record of the Soviet-backed regime.
"In view of Poland's lack of progress, the president
remains firm that no new credit should be extended to
Poland," one official said.
He said that a ban will continue against Polish airline lan
ding rights in this country and that a prohibition on eco
nomic and high-technology aid will remain in place.
What will be renegotiated in Paris is the 1981 Polish debt,
totaling $11 billion in all and $420 million to the United
States. Poland had agreed to pay the United States $42 mil
lion of that debt, but still owed $28 million of that payment
when martial law was imposed in December, 1981, and the
free trade union Solidarity was outlawed.
