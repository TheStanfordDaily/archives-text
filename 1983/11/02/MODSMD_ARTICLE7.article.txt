## Exit anxiety: Coping with the fear of leaving 
### TINA-MARIE BASKIN 
To a harried freshman struggling with
that first Western Culture paper on "The
Epic of Gilgamesh," the thought of
graduation may seem like a dream.
But for many seniors, the idea of facing
the real world — and the unknown —
seems more like a nightmare. This fear of
facing the future, often called "exit anx
iety", is a common phenomenon.
Said Charlotte Siegel, a clinical social
worker at Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), "A new change always
brings some anxiety with it. Sure it's ex
citing, but it means you're leaving a nest:
a comfortable and secure place you've
built up. Leaving behind a network of
contacts, professors, relationships and
the thought of having to start all over
again is scary."
Siegel, along with other CAPS coun
selors, sees a large number of students
with this common set of fears. In
response, they decided to put together a
winter workshop on exit anxiety.
"If a student can come in and talk with
other students and realize that it's okay,
that they're not the only one in the boat,
then some of that pressure can be
relieved. When you can talk about your
fears and anticipate future problems then
you're significantly ahead of the game,"
Siegel said.
"Students feel anxiety about the time,
energy and money spent on their educa
tions because the test comes now and
they worry about making it: 'Am I ready
for the real world? What if it doesn't jell
together? Am I going to be marketable
with the major I've chosen?'," Siegel
said. "Some students even feel anger be
cause this energy and great major only
landed them a mediocre job."
Some of this pressure comes from
outside sources as well. "Parental pres
sure usually adds to this anxiety. Parents
feel 'We've put all this into you and now

you're going to take oft, right?' Parents
have to be tolerant ," Siegel said. "A stu
dent's education is a wonderfully impor
tant part of their life. It's the tools for
their whole future. But, we explain to the
students that there may be a gap between
this inner reinforcement and the actual
practicing of it."
Chris Shinkman, director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center, (CPPC)
agreed with Siegal. "We offer opportuni
ties for students to get part- or full-time
jobs, summer jobs and internships to test
occupations. This way, many students
don't have to have to experience the
shock of the real world at graduation.
The CPPC serves two primary func
tions. One is the career planning side
which is designed to relieve some of the
preliminary anxiety by helping the stu
dent in the career decision-making
process.
"Many students come in and they
aren't sure what they like or what the pos
sibilities are. That's why we have a variety
of workshops which are designed for the
student to explore possible interests and
assess them and learn skills as well,"
Shinkman said.
Among the workshops offered are in
terviewing and job-hunting techniques,
resume writing and mock interviewing.
The other function of the CPPC is
career placement. About 500 organiza
tions conduct interviews at the CPPC
each year.
During the recruiting period between
Oct. 10 and May 1 is when the anxiety
really shows. "Students are anxious to get
that job. It's not so much their fear of en
tering the real world. It's a kind of a good
news-bad-news thing. Of course there's a
separation anxiety — this is a happy,
friendly place and it's hard to think of
leaving it, but we don't want it to be
traumatic. We want students to be ready
to get on with their lives and put their

education to use."
Even students who feel certain they can
cope with the working world can under
stand other students' apprehension.
"I've been out in the real world before,"
said senior Richard Esquibel. "Because
I've worked, I'm not feeling like I can't
cope but I'm sure for some there is anx
iety there."
Verity Powell, an on-call counselor at
the Academic Information Center, said
she sees very few students who fear the
outside world. "I see maybe two students
per year who fear graduation. I see more
sophomores and juniors who are anxious
because they haven't found a major," she
said. Usually it's the seniors who are
more settled. I don't disagree that those
anxious students are out there but we just
don't see them — fear can sometimes im
mobilize you.
"About half of this year's graduates will
be going to graduate school but I don't
see this as an escape from the real world.
It's much more for intellectual
purposes."
Senior Fran Ada agreed. "I'm very anx
ious about grad school . . . But I'm going
because I want to further my interest in
medicine," she said.
Patti Yukawa, a counselor at the CPPC,
sees student anxiety stemming from the
transition between "being a student to
being a worker. Finals are difficult, but as
a working person there are different
demands and expectations," she said.
While commonplace, exit anxiety is not
a universal phenomenon. "Sure, there
are a lot of people who say they wish they
were a frosh again because they don't
know what the future holds. But most
seniors I know are looking forward to it,
too," said senior Dave Charron. "I'm an
engineering major and the market is
pretty tight now so of course I'm anxious,
but I'm sort of looking forward to getting
a job."
