# Student group learns through work with Third World nations
## 
### LIBBY OSBORNE 
Students interested in in
creasing awareness about in
ternational developmental is
sues or are concerned with
the problems of Third World
countries may be able to find
an outlet for their concern in
the new Stanford International
Development Organization
(SIDO).
This newly formed organiza
tion is a part of the Overseas
Development Network, an ex
panding network of innovative
groups located in various
campuses and communities
throughout the nation. Other
branches of the network have
been established at Amherst,
Columbia, Harvard, North
western, Tufts and Wellesley.
The purpose of this group is
threefold: to provide viable,
effective solutions to small
scale problems in developing
countries, to educate the Stan
ford community about
developmental issues and to
compile up-to-date catalogs
listing internship/employment
opportunities with overseas
and U.S.-based organizations.
The Stanford International
Development Organization
stresses direct involvement.
For this reason, the projects
sponsored will be typically
small and designed to encour
age local initiative, benefit the
ve.y poor and emphasize the
creation of opportunities,
rather than provide temporary
h^rdouts

Third World communities
that have been helped by
groups such as SIDO will be
expected to intitiate similar
programs to benefit other
members of their society.

Some of the projects
being planned are
supplying com
munities in
Bangladesh with the
raw materials for
fishing nets and vac
cinations for farm
animals.

These projects will have a
personal emphasis, allowing
Stanford students an opportu
nity to become intimately and
constructively involved in the
lives of poor communities in
the Third World.
Some of the projects being
planned by SIDO are supply
ing communities in
Bangladesh with the raw ma
terials for fishing nets and vac
cinations for farm animals.
Groups sponsoring a spe
cific project will study that par
ticular community and try to
respond to its needs. Students
who participate in this type of
program will then utilize their
experience to educate the
Stanford community with ex
hibits, films, discussion

groups and slide shows about
subjects on a personal level.
The Overseas Development
Network will also extend in
vitations to individuals from
various Third World countries
who have made outstanding
contributions to the allevia
tion of poverty and the en
hancement of human dignity,
inviting them to spend time in
the United States. These indi
viduals will share their
perspectives with the network
members at other schools.
Two other large-scale proj
ects which the Overseas De
velopment Network is
working on are a com
puterized clearinghouse of
overseas internships and a
directory of groups within the
United States and Canada that
are involved with international
development.
The clearinghouse will pro
vide a much needed, up-to
date source of information for
people seeking intern
ships/employment in specific
fields and countries. The
directory of North American
institutions will serve those
who are unable or unwilling to
go overseas but are genuinely
interested in international de
velopment.
Although the philosophy of
SIDO and the entire Overseas
Developmental Network is
firmly established, the success
and actual organization
depends entirely on the inter
est, initiative and enthusiam of
those who join.
