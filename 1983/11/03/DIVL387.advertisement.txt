STUDENTS FOR THE
PRESIDENTIAL COMPLEX AT STANFORD
We Students for the Presidential Complex at Stanford believe that informed, rat\ona\
examination leaves no doubt about the great academic value of the proposed Presiden- â– 
tial Library Complex.
We believe that opponents of the complex are hiding behind a smokescreen of
politically-motivated issues Politics should have no role whatsoever in this debate.
We believe it is not enough to want this great scholarly asset. We must demonstrate
to the Board of Trustees that we will not allow a vocal minority to deprive Stanford of this
invaluable academic resource.
