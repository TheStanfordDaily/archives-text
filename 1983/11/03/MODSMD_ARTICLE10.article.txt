# What went on at Stanford?
## 
### 
Students try to censor a guest
professor's lectures. A graduate
student is expelled when his re
search findings offend a foreign
government. A prestigious re
search organization comes under
attack because of the political
views of some of its scholars
Such violations of academic
freedom might be expected
under a totalitarian regime that
requires political obedience in
schools and colleges But these
incidents all occurred in Califor
nia at Stanford University.
Although any threat to aca
demic freedom can impede vig
orous, independent inquiry re
quired for quality scholarship, a
single violation might be excused
as an isolated incident. Unfor
tunately, Stanford's reputation
has been tarnished by a series of
events.
The most serious include ef
forts to censure a seminar taught
by former Hep. Paul N "Pete"
McCloskey, the expulsion of an
anthropology student who discov
ered repeated instances of forced
abortion in rural China, and ef
forts by some liberal faculty
members and students to force
the renowned Hoover Institution
off the campus.
The problems at Stanford
began earlier this year when the
student organization that had in
vited Mr. McCloskey as a guest
professor objected to his class
room criticisms of Israel. To his
credit. Mr. McCloskey resisted
the improper pressure and
refused to delete material criti
cal of Israel from his seminar
reading list The students then
threatened to block his pay.

We commend the Stanford ad
ministration for apologizing to
Mr. McCloskey for the students'
conduct. But the administration's
own conduct has raised serious
questions about its commitment
to academic freedom.
Indeed, there is reason to be
lieve the university succumbed to
pressure from the government of
China in the curious expulsion of
Steven Mosher, who had been
considered a brilliant graduate
student of anthropology.
While conducting research in
China for his doctoral disserta
tion, Mr Mosher discovered
widespread infanticide and
forced abortions in rural villages.
Unhappy with the publication of
Mr. Mosher's findings, the Chi
nese government accused him of
bribing informants and other
unethical behavior.
Mr. Mosher's revelations have
not been disputed. Nevertheless,
Stanford did not support Mr.
Mosher and the principle of free
scholarly research. Instead, it ex
pelled him. The fact that no rea
sons for the expulsion have been
made public gives credibility to
the suspicion by many academics
that Stanford acted to appease
the Chinese.
The case of the Hoover Institu
tion is especially egregious be
cause Hoover scholars include
some of the most respected intel
lectuals in the nation In effect,
the liberals, who want the institu
tion off the campus, are saying
they will tolerate no political
viewpoint different from their
own.
It is cynical and hypocritical
for them to assert that the insti

tution has no place at Stanford
because some Hoover s< holars
hold or have held positions in the
Reagan administration Many
liberal scholars from Harvard
and other academic institutions
actively served previous Ameri
can presidents.
The Stanford administration
should be defending the Hoover
Institution and its record of non
partisan scholarship. But the uni
versity's administrators have not
resisted what obviously is a polit
ically motivated assault on aca
demic freedom. Instead, the Stan
ford administration has meekly
agreed to study whether to re
evaluate the relationship be
tween Stanford and the Hoover
Institution.
These are not the only threats
to diversity of thought at Stan
ford. Some liberal professors and
students are demanding that sci
entists from Livermore and Los
Alamos be denied access to the
university's nuclear research fa
cilities because their work may
have military applications And,
the Stanford Review, a conserva
tive student newspaper, has been
denied the funds and facilities
that have been accorded liberal
student publications
A distinguished history of
scholarly research and academic
achievement has made Stanford
University one of the nation's
premier institutions of higher ed
ucation But to maintain its pres
tigious reputation, the university
will have to ensure that threats
to diversity of thought and aca
demic freedom no longer will be
tolerated at Stanford
