# Out Of Our Past

The lines at the post office haven't always been as long as they are now.
But then, the post office hasn't always been what it is now, either. The
Stanford branch post office was once located between Old Union and
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, on what is now the grassy oval in front of Tresid-

der Union. In this photograph, taken in the early 19505, the old post of
fice sits in the foreground, and the arch on the front of Old Union is in the
rear. Cars are parked on the now non-existent street in front of Old
Union.
