# Invading the Oval to 'restore order?'
## 
### 
Why is the grass dying in the
Oval? Donors gave money to
the University to maintain the
Oval and now it looks like the
grass is dying.
In 1980 the Office of Devel
opment announced that a
monetary gift had been
received which was intended
specifically for the upkeep and
maintenance of the lawn and
garden areas inside the oval of
asphalt which marks the end
of Palm Drive and the main en
trance to the Quad.

The donors, who wished to
remain anonymous, jog
through the Oval regularly
and wanted to ensure that the
Oval's appearance wouldn't
suffer for lack of funding.
True to the anonymous
philanthropist's wishes, the
Oval has been maintained as
one of the most meticulously
groomed patches of green on
campus up to this date. (OK,
so it's only been three years,
but campus legends have to
start somewhere.)
At any rate, when I received

the question I felt obliged to
investigate the situation per
sonally. True to the (also
anonymous) questioner's
claim, about three-quarters of
the grass in the Oval is brown
and bone-dry and the surviv
ing portion is less than
healthy.
The funny thing about
writing a column like Bug Me
is the constant fear that you
are about to uncover some
sort of Ovalgate scandal right
when you should be studying

tor the latest round of mid
terms. But, oblivious to the
consequences, I rushed back
to The Daily offices and dialed
up Herbert Fong, manager of
University labor and grounds.
Fong confirmed my fears.
The awful truth behind the
brown spots in the Oval is ex
actly the kind of thing Presi
dent Reagan was trying to
warn us about last week on
television. A massive insur
gent invasion from the Carib
bean Islands was sweeping


Bug
Me
through the American fabric
of the Oval. The (red, white
and) bluegrass strain of grass
especially seeded in the Oval
some years ago was giving way
to a hideously insideous strain
of . . . Bermuda Crabgrass!

The University has been
combating the invasion with a
series of chemical sprayings
which should clear the Oval of
all the Bermuda strains within
a couple of weeks. After this
eradication has been com
pleted, the entire Oval area
will be reseeded with the
original bluegrass strain.

All-in-all, the restoration to
greenness and democracy
shouldn't take more than
"about a month" and labor
and grounds troops should be
able to withdraw at that time.
No thanks are needed for
this bit of research — just
trying to keep the University
safe for bare feet.
