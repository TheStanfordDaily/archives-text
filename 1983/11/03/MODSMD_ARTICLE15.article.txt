After several violent demonstrations,
numerous faculty votes and prolonged contro
versy, the 1970 Faculty Senate finally agreed to
eliminate academic credit for Reserve Officers
Training Corps (ROTC) classes.
The faculty's decision was the culmination of
months of discussion and protest. A few radical
student organizations had angrily opposed the
ROTC here, claiming that military studies was
not an appropriate subject for a liberal arts in
stitution. In addition, many professors ques
tioned the academic quality of ROTC courses.
But the Vietnam war ended, and the anti
military sentiment on campus died down. A
few years ago, the University began to allow
Stanford students to "cross-enroll" in ROTC
programs in nearby colleges. Presently, Stan
ford Navy ROTC students attend military
classes at Berkeley, Army ROTC members go to
Santa Clara and Air Force ROTC students at
tend military science and leadership classes at
San Jose State.
In addition, the movement towards reinstat
ing academic credit for ROTC classes here has
gained momentum in recent months. Last
spring, the Air Force ROTC students organized
a letter-writing campaign to urge University
President Donald Kennedy to allow the return
# of military science classes to the campus.
Recently four Stanford Air Force ROTC stu
dents concluded an arrangement with the Air

Force in which they earn class credit by con
ducting efforts to convince the University to al
low ROTC courses here. Many ROTC students
feel that it is only a matter of time before mili
tary science is again taught on the Stanford
campus.
In fact, the University has already agreed to
give the Air Force classroom space for its ROTC
classes. However, the Air Force has refused to
allow instruction here unless academic credit is
given.
The renewed effort towards recognizing mil
itary studies as a legitimate academic discipline
here troubles us deeply. For we believe that
the faculty acted wisely and rationally in 1970
when it revoked credit for ROTC classes: Mili
tary studies have no place in an academic insti
tution.
In addition, military science courses are in
ferior in academic content to other Stanford
classes. The "science" of killing people more
efficiently is not an appropriate subject to
receive Stanford University credit.
The faculty was correct in eliminating credit
for ROTC courses in the tumultuous years of
the early 19705. Campus radicals are no longer
trashing the campus to urge the elimination of
ROTC, but the conservative nature of the
times should not influence the University to
reverse its wise decision to oppose military in
struction on campus.
