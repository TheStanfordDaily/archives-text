# Why send more missiles
## 
### 
Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators
marched through European cities last week
protesting the scheduled deployment of new
American medium-range missiles. In London,
more than 200,000 poured into Hyde Park.
Some 350,000 marched through Rome and
about 100,000 protestors brought Vienna to a
standstill. Demonstrators in West Germany
formed a 70-mile human chain between a
NATO headquarters and a Pershing II missile
base while more than 1.2 million people held
rallies in West German cities.
The protests came just weeks before the
planned deployment of 108 Pershing II and 464
cruise missiles in Europe next month. Sadly,
the deployment marks just one more step in a
dangerous nuclear build-up between the two
superpowers.
The U.S. began plans to deploy Pershing
missiles in the late 1970s in response to the So
viet deployment of some 350 medium-range
SS-20s. Reagan has explained that the Soviet
SS-20s created an "imbalance," with 800 for
them and nil for us. But that imbalance all
depends on what you hold your hand over
while you count. Western forces include some
6000 short-range tactical weapons, U.S.
Poseidon submarines, aircraft-launched weap
ons, British Polaris submarine-launched
missiles, the whole French armory and U.S. air
launched and sea-launched cruise missiles.
Our short-range tactical nuclear weapons
defend against a Soviet conventional attack on
Europe. And our strategic forces deter a Soviet
nuclear attack. In short, the Europeans don't
need any new missiles.

Not only are the weapons unnecessary, but
they are also destabilizing. The Pershing
missiles are first-strike weapons because of
their accuracy and ability to destroy Soviet
cities and command centers with only a six to
eight minute time for error.
The cruise missiles also threaten targets in
the Soviet Union because they are hard to
detect and destroy. There once was a
widespread belief that NATO forces were in
tended only to defend Western nations. But
the deployment of the new Pershing missiles
has placed doubt about NATO intentions in the
minds of many people, especially the Soviets.
The Soviet response has been too predic
table. The Warsaw Pact commander has said
that if the Pershing missiles are put in place,
Moscow will "deploy additional nuclear weap
ons to offset NATO's growing nuclear might in
Europe" and "take corresponding measures
with regards to United States territory." These
new Soviet missiles might be placed in East
Germany, Czechoslavakia or in Eastern Siberia,
in range of Alaska and the U.S. Northwest.
Somehow, it seems that we have gotten caught
up in a mindless numbers game that only takes
us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear
war.
As the deployment of the Pershing missiles
gets closer, demonstrators will continue to fill
European cities. U.S. and Soviet negotiators
will continue talks in Geneva, and the two na
tions may even reach an interim agreement
that limits our deployment to some number.
But the spiralling arms race will continue â€”
with no end in sight.
