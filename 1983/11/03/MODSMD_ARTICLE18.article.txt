# We need political moderates
## 
### 
The national press in America likes to present its
stories as simple contrasts. In global affairs we have the
Americans versus the Russians. In the Middle East, it's
the Israelis versus the Arabs. Such oppositions are pre
sented in terms of the charismatic leaders of the two
hostile camps: President Reagan against Yuri
Andropov, or Menachem Begin against Yasser Arafat.
The press is at its worst in a situation like Lebanon,
where there is a whole spectrum of competing interests
and personalities.
The oldest simplifications of the media are in domes
tic policy: The Democrats versus the Republicans, and
the liberals versus the conservatives. Day after day
House Speaker Tip O'Neill and Reagan seem to square
off on the evening news. And stories are much easier to
cover if you assume that the liberals are the same
people as the Democrats, and the conservatives are the
same people as the Republicans.
Of course, Washington is not so simple a city. Even
the national news has to recognize the apparent
anomolous conservative Democrats, who have won
Reagan so many victories. But this third bloc is about as
much complexity as most news stories can stomach.
Such simplifications seriously misrepresent much of
American politics. The group most ignored by the na
tional media is the moderate Republicans. This bloc has
a distinguished heritage, from Abraham Lincoln and
Teddy Roosevelt to Earl Warren and Nelson Rockefel
ler. Only seven years ago the right-wing of the Republi
can party, led by Reagan, was soundly beaten by the
moderates in the presidential primaries.
Of course, no one denies that conservatives like
Sens. Jesse Helms, Strom Thurmond and Paul Laxalt
predominate in the Republican Party today. And the
most liberal members of Congress, such as Ted Ken
nedy and Ron Dellums are Democrats. But the ac
complishments of the moderate Republicans during
the Reagan administration have not been incon
siderable.
Sen. Robert Stafford (R-Vt.) spearheaded the exten
sion of the Clean Water Act, and has stopped all at-

tempts to weaken the Clean Air Act. Sen. Bob Pack
wood (R-Ore.) leads the fight against the anti-abortion
constitutional amendments. Sen. Charles Mathias (D-
Md.) was instrumental in passing the Voting Rights Act
extension and the Martin Luther King holiday. Sen.
Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) originated the nuclear freeze in
Congress. Other Republicans in the House and Senate
have saved funding ior child nutrition, handicapped,
education, environmental and foreign economic aid
programs.
In fact, the effectiveness of the relatively few
moderate Republicans is one of the great unpublished
stories of the past three years. The failure of the media
to cover the success of moderate Republicans is espe
cially notable when compared to the failure of the
Democratic Party to come up with any initiatives since
Reagan's election. Even the conservative Republicans
have failed to get many of their pet projects, such as the
balanced budget amendment, school prayer and an
end to school busing, through Congress.
The existence of moderate Republicans forms an im
portant check on the excesses of the far right. Really
bad ideas can be identified before they become a mat
ter of party loyalty. The dynamics of a two-party system.
is such that the Democrats can never hope tor a
monopoly on power. The existence of moderates in
both parties keeps a constructive dialogue going be
tween them. It prevents the polarization of American
politics into sterile ideologies, like the European
countries which do not allow such diversity within each
party.
Liberals need allies in both parties, and should not
write off all Republicans. The alternative to preserving
diversity in both parties is to swing every few years
from extreme to extreme, with neither continuity nor
compromise. If the media stereotype of solely liberal
Democrats and solely conservative Republicans is
allowed to become reality, the already low quality of
American government will deteriorate even further.
