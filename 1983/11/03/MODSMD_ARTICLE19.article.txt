## Marine deaths in Lebanon are a human – not political- loss 
### 
The deaths of the young Marines
in Lebanon bring many questions
to mind. Why are we there? Is this
the start of another Vietnam? Was it
a leftist or a rightist who drove the
bomb-laden truck? These questions
seem to elicit a variety of responses
as suggestions as to where we
should go from here. The topic
seems to be the center of dinner
conversation but the point seems to
have been lost. In our scramble to
defend our political position,
whatever it may be, we seem to have
forgotten the essence of the
tragedy, i.e., the human element.
Has this society so molded our
thoughts that we no longer think in
terms of human compassion and un
derstanding but rather in terms of
statistics, political feasibility and the
effect of this or that action on the
upcoming election? The tragedy is
not that our objective in Lebanon is
not being accomplished, the
tragedy is that 221 men died. So
what's 221, only one sixth of our
total force in Lebanon: Their
replacements have already arrived
so what's the big deal? 221 fully
developed lives were lost.
My sorrow over the loss of life in
Lebanon brought clearly to mind an
article I read years ago but which
has remained taped on my wall ever
since. The article was written by
Lynda Van Devanter, a registered
nurse who served as a first
lieutenant in the U.S. Army in Plieku
and Qui Nhon, South Vietnam from
1969-1970. She is now the women's
director of Vietnam Veterans of
America.

"In memory of the young bleeder,
the children, the world ..."
It is 3 a.m. in Pleiku, South Viet
nam. The fighting in the central
highlands is heavy, and I am called
out of my sleep to the operating
room. I had been sleeping on the
floor under my cot, having been

awakened an hour earlier by a rock
et attack, as on most other nights.
Even in my groggy state, the gruff
words on the phone, "Casualties!
Get down here on the double," are
enough to send the adrenalin
flowing, and I am alert by the time I
arrive in the O.R. I change quickly to
scrub clothes and report to the head
nurse for my assignment.
It is the largest trail of blood
leading to the table that I have ever
seen. I slip on it because my eyes
are drawn to the gurney where
several people are transferring the
soldier to the operating table. I
watch in horror as the lower portion
of his jaw, teeth exposed, dangles
from what is left of his face. It
swings in the air as he is moved from
the gurney to the table, and I hold
my breath to keep from getting sick.
For a moment I am glued to the
spot. I thought I had gotten used to
it, but it keeps getting worse.
The shout of the anesthetist
brings me up sharply, and I rush to
his side to assist him in a trach
eotomy. "We've got to get an air
way into him fast — he's drowning
in blood," he yells, and my training
moves me into action. I grab a tray
of instruments and open it. For the
sake of speed, we perform the trach
without donning gloves. Once the
opening into the boy's windpipe is
completed, and he is being vent
ilated, I move to help the surgeon.
He grabs instruments from the tray
to clamp off the largest bleeders in
the face and jaw.
Meanwhile the scrub technician is
setting up the sterile field of linens
and instruments, and once the larg
est bleeders are tied off, the sur
geon puts on his gown and gloves
and they begin to work in earnest to
try to repair the damage. Now I
realize what the head nurse meant
when she told me that I was needed
to pump blood: The young soldier is
bleeding so fast that it is necessary

to start four large needles in his leg,
neck and both arms, and pump
blood into all of them simultane
ously. I do only this for the next
several hours.
During one of my circuits around
the table, I move his clothes to one
side, and a snapshot falls out of the
pocket of his fatigues. It is of a
young couple — him and his girl, I
guess — dressed for a prom. Tears
come to my eyes. He is gazing
sweetly at the girl. Straight, blond
and tall, he looks proud in his
tuxedo. She, too, is tall, with shining
dark hair. She is wearing a long pas
tel gown. Love for him shines in her
eyes.
The scene is in stark contrast to
what I see in this room. The lovely
young man is now a mass of blood

vessels and skin, so macerated that
nothing could hold them to
gether.The more the surgeon works
the more the boy bleeds ....
I pump 120 units of blood into that
young man. But as fast as I pump it
in he pumps it out. After hours of
work the surgeon finally realizes
that it is futile. He wraps the boy's
head in layers of pressure dressing
and sends him to post-op/intensive
care unit to die. As I clean up the
room, I keep telling myself that a
miracle could happen. He could
stop bleeding. He'd be all right. I
move about the mess, picking up
blood-soaked linens and putting
them into the hamper. I come upon
the photograph again, pick it up and
stare. He had been real. He was a
person who could love and think

and plan and dream — and now he
is lost to himself, to her and to their
future. I sit on the floor, my head in
my hands and sob.
After making the room ready for
the next person — I walk over to
post-op/ICU to see him. His
bandages have become saturated
with blood several times over, and
the nurses have reinforced it with
more rolls of bandages, mostly to
cover it up, so that now his head is
grotesquely large under the swath
of white, the red stains beginning to
seep through. I hold his hands for a
few moments and ask if he is in
pain. He squeezes my hand weakly,
and I tell him that I'll request some
pain medication. He squeezes my
hand again in answer, and I stand
holding hands with him for another

few moments, the last of his life. My
hands shake as I write this, as they
did then, and the tears return ....
• ••
The issue isn't the draft anymore;
no, that has been conveniently
faded from our list of tenable topics,
but please, I beg you, don't allow
Van Devanter's message to fade. Let
us mourn, not for the number 221
but for what that number
represents — people, real people
who laughed, who cried, and who
loved, but will be able to no more,
and the Marines' mothers, wives
and friends who, although their loss
constitutes only one, are left with
only memories of the ones they
dearly loved.

sake of speed, we perform the trach
without donning gloves. Once the
opening into the boy's windpipe is
completed, and he is being vent
ilated, I move to help the surgeon.
He grabs instruments from the tray
to clamp off the largest bleeders in
the face and jaw.
Meanwhile the scrub technician is
setting up the sterile field of linens
and instruments, and once the larg
est bleeders are tied off, the sur
geon puts on his gown and gloves
and they begin to work in earnest to
try to repair the damage. Now I
realize what the head nurse meant
when she told me that I was needed
to pump blood: The young soldier is
bleeding so fast that it is necessary

to start four large needles in his leg,
neck and both arms, and pump
blood into all of them simultane
ously. I do only this for the next
several hours.
During one of my circuits around
the table, I move his clothes to one
side, and a snapshot falls out of the
pocket of his fatigues. It is of a
young couple — him and his girl, I
guess — dressed for a prom. Tears
come to my eyes. He is gazing
sweetly at the girl. Straight, blond
and tall, he looks proud in his
tuxedo. She, too, is tall, with shining
dark hair. She is wearing a long pas
tel gown. Love for him shines in her
eyes.
The scene is in stark contrast to
what I see in this room. The lovely
young man is now a mass of blood

vessels and skin, so macerated that
nothing could hold them to
gether.The more the surgeon works
the more the boy bleeds ....
I pump 120 units of blood into that
young man. But as fast as I pump it
in he pumps it out. After hours of
work the surgeon finally realizes
that it is futile. He wraps the boy's
head in layers of pressure dressing
and sends him to post-op/intensive
care unit to die. As I clean up the
room, I keep telling myself that a
miracle could happen. He could
stop bleeding. He'd be all right. I
move about the mess, picking up
blood-soaked linens and putting
them into the hamper. I come upon
the photograph again, pick it up and
stare. He had been real. He was a
person who could love and think

and plan and dream — and now he
is lost to himself, to her and to their
future. I sit on the floor, my head in
my hands and sob.
After making the room ready for
the next person — I walk over to
post-op/ICU to see him. His
bandages have become saturated
with blood several times over, and
the nurses have reinforced it with
more rolls of bandages, mostly to
cover it up, so that now his head is
grotesquely large under the swath
of white, the red stains beginning to
seep through. I hold his hands for a
few moments and ask if he is in
pain. He squeezes my hand weakly,
and I tell him that I'll request some
pain medication. He squeezes my
hand again in answer, and I stand
holding hands with him for another

few moments, the last of his life. My
hands shake as I write this, as they
did then, and the tears return ....

The issue isn't the draft anymore;
no, that has been conveniently
faded from our list of tenable topics,
but please, I beg you, don't allow
Van Devanter's message to fade. Let
us mourn, not for the number 221
but for what that number
represents — people, real people
who laughed, who cried, and who
loved, but will be able to no more,
and the Marines' mothers, wives
and friends who, although their loss
constitutes only one, are left with
only memories of the ones they
dearly loved.

The deaths of the young Marines
in Lebanon bring many questions
to mind. Why are we there? Is this
the start of another Vietnam? Was it
a leftist or a rightist who drove the
bomb-laden truck? These questions
seem to elicit a variety of responses
as suggestions as to where we
should go from here. The topic
seems to be the center of dinner
conversation but the point seems to
have been lost. In our scramble to
defend our political position,
whatever it may be, we seem to have
forgotten the essence of the
tragedy, i.e., the human element.
Has this society so molded our
thoughts that we no longer think in
terms of human compassion and un
derstanding but rather in terms of
statistics, political feasibility and the
effect of this or that action on the
upcoming election? The tragedy is
not that our objective in Lebanon is
not being accomplished, the
tragedy is that 221 men died. So
what's 221, only one sixth of our
total force in Lebanon: Their
replacements have already arrived
so what's the big deal? 221 fully
developed lives were lost.
My sorrow over the loss of life in
Lebanon brought clearly to mind an
article I read years ago but which
has remained taped on my wall ever
since. The article was written by
Lynda Van Devanter, a registered
nurse who served as a first
lieutenant in the U.S. Army in Plieku
and Qui Nhon, South Vietnam from
1969-1970. She is now the women's
director of Vietnam Veterans of
America.

"In memory of the young bleeder,
the children, the world ..."
It is 3 a.m. in Pleiku, South Viet
nam. The fighting in the central
highlands is heavy, and I am called
out of my sleep to the operating
room. I had been sleeping on the
floor under my cot, having been

awakened an hour earlier by a rock
et attack, as on most other nights.
Even in my groggy state, the gruff
words on the phone, "Casualties!
Get down here on the double," are
enough to send the adrenalin
flowing, and I am alert by the time I
arrive in the O.R. I change quickly to
scrub clothes and report to the head
nurse for my assignment.
It is the largest trail of blood
leading to the table that I have ever
seen. I slip on it because my eyes
are drawn to the gurney where
several people are transferring the
soldier to the operating table. I
watch in horror as the lower portion
of his jaw, teeth exposed, dangles
from what is left of his face. It
swings in the air as he is moved from
the gurney to the table, and I hold
my breath to keep from getting sick.
For a moment I am glued to the
spot. I thought I had gotten used to
it, but it keeps getting worse.
The shout of the anesthetist
brings me up sharply, and I rush to
his side to assist him in a trach
eotomy. "We've got to get an air
way into him fast — he's drowning
in blood," he yells, and my training
moves me into action. I grab a tray
of instruments and open it. For the
sake of speed, we perform the trach
without donning gloves. Once the
opening into the boy's windpipe is
completed, and he is being vent
