# UCSB chancellor wants complex
## Hoover pursues center as key to Reagan complex 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Despite a warning that a Hoover
run center for public affairs is not
likely to be accepted by the Board of
Trustees, the Hoover Institution still
considers such a center an in
separable part of its proposal to
bring a Reagan presidential library
complex to Stanford, according to
Associate Director Dennis Bark.
Bark, in an interview yesterday,
also said he expects the White
House to re-endorse that plan,
which offers a Reagan library,
museum and Hoover-run center to
Stanford on what is essentially an
all-or-nothing basis.
This means that in the 40 days
before the Board of Trustees next
convenes, ardent proponents and
opponents of the library complex
are likely to focus their support and
criticism on the center, which seems
to be the only part of the proposal
that is still controversial among large
numbers of people here.
If the warning — issued by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy at
a Faculty Senate meeting last week
— is accurate, Hoover and its sup

porters face an uphill battle. They
must overcome the apparently
growing campus consensus that a
center run by Hoover would
unwisely and unnecessarily extend
Hoover's role on campus, and that a
center, if built, should be run by the
University itself.
If they are unable to do so, and
the Board decides a Hoover-run
center is unacceptable, then
Hoover's decision to stick to its
guns may well mean that the Reagan
presidential papers — which Hoover
and many others on campus want
desperately — will end up some
where else.
That somewhere could be UC-
Santa Barbara, whose chancellor,
Robert Hottenbeck, has written a
personal letter suggesting that if the
Stanford plan falls through, UCSB
would be a logical and attractive site
for a presidential library.
White House Counselor Edwin
Meese told Rep. Robert Lagomar
sino (R-Santa Barbara) yesterday that
he appreciated the offer but that for
now Stanford is Reagan's first
choice.
Hoover officials, while refusing to
name names, have said that a num
ber of other schools have expressed
a desire to house a Reagan complex.
At least two are believed to be other
private California universities.
A Board of Trustees committee
headed by Board President William
Kimball is supposed to be looking
into the library proposal but is
waiting for the White House to state

formally whether it would accept
anything but the Hoover proposal.
Neither Meese nor his White
House deputy, Jim Jenkins, was
available for comment on the library
issue yesterday.

Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell, who has worked most
closely with the White House on the
proposal, refused to talk with The
Daily yesterday, saying that he is not
granting any interviews at the pres
ent time.
