## Basketball team 'opens'season against Japan tonight 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford fans will get a
sneak preview of the 1983-84
Cardinal basketball team in a
special showing tonight
against the Japanese National
Team. Showtime is 7:30 p.m.
at Maples Pavilion.
Coach Tom Davis, who with
a 14-14 record last year led
Stanford to its first non-losing
season in 10 years, kicks off
his second campaign with the
Cardinal in tonight's exhibi

tion contest with Japan.
Though the game will not
count towards Stanford's
overall record, it does carry
importance as far as Davis and
his team are concerned.
Stanford calls the )apanese
squad "old friends" because
the Card hoopsters played
against it twice last summer at
the Kirin World Games, a tour
team international basketball
tournament hosted by Japan.
"The entertainment and

hospitality we received in
japan was first-rate in every
way," Davis said yesterday at a
news conference. "We
couldn't have been treated
better."
Stanford beat japan in both
meetings last june, once in
Nagoya 94-74 and once in
Toyko 119-98, and can be con
sidered the favorite tonight.
Davis, however, does not
plan to use the exhibition
game as simply a workout for

his players. And although the
Card has been officially prac
ticing for barely more than
two weeks, Davis hopes to get
a good indication of his team's
progress in tonight's game.
"We'll use all our plays, our
whole package and then
review it," Davis said, indica
ting he will take an especially
close look at the Card's man
to-man defense and its fast
break.
Because of Davis' pressing
and fast-breaking brand of
basketball, Stanford was the
second highest scoring team
in the Pacific-10 Conference
last year. "I think we're capa
ble of being an even higher
scoring team than we were a
year ago," he prophesized.
Another feature of Davis'
coaching is his frequent sub
stituting, something he'll do
even more often against
Japan. "We'll play a lot more
players than we would in the
regular season," he said.
Starting tonight's game will
be five returning players from
last year's team which finished
eighth in the competitive Pac
-10.
A pair of Keiths will get the
call at guard, senior Keith
Jones and sophomore Keith
Ramee, while sophomore Earl
Koberlein and junior Charles
Hunt will take the floor at for
ward. Senior John Revelli,
who along with Jones is a pre
season All-America can
didate, will start at center.
The surprise of tonight's
starters is Hunt, a 6-toot-3, 195-
