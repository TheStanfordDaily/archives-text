## Basketball team 'opens'season against Japan tonight 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford fans will get a
sneak preview of the 1983-84
Cardinal basketball team in a
special showing tonight
against the Japanese National
Team. Showtime is 7:30 p.m.
at Maples Pavilion.
Coach Tom Davis, who with
a 14-14 record last year led
Stanford to its first non-losing
season in 10 years, kicks off
his second campaign with the
Cardinal in tonight's exhibi

tion contest with Japan.
Though the game will not
count towards Stanford's
overall record, it does carry
importance as far as Davis and
his team are concerned.
Stanford calls the )apanese
squad "old friends" because
the Card hoopsters played
against it twice last summer at
the Kirin World Games, a tour
team international basketball
tournament hosted by Japan.
"The entertainment and

hospitality we received in
japan was first-rate in every
way," Davis said yesterday at a
news conference. "We
couldn't have been treated
better."
Stanford beat japan in both
meetings last june, once in
Nagoya 94-74 and once in
Toyko 119-98, and can be con
sidered the favorite tonight.
Davis, however, does not
plan to use the exhibition
game as simply a workout for

his players. And although the
Card has been officially prac
ticing for barely more than
two weeks, Davis hopes to get
a good indication of his team's
progress in tonight's game.
"We'll use all our plays, our
whole package and then
review it," Davis said, indica
ting he will take an especially
close look at the Card's man
to-man defense and its fast
break.
Because of Davis' pressing
and fast-breaking brand of
basketball, Stanford was the
second highest scoring team
in the Pacific-10 Conference
last year. "I think we're capa
ble of being an even higher
scoring team than we were a
year ago," he prophesized.
Another feature of Davis'
coaching is his frequent sub
stituting, something he'll do
even more often against
Japan. "We'll play a lot more
players than we would in the
regular season," he said.
Starting tonight's game will
be five returning players from
last year's team which finished
eighth in the competitive Pac
-10.
A pair of Keiths will get the
call at guard, senior Keith
Jones and sophomore Keith
Ramee, while sophomore Earl
Koberlein and junior Charles
Hunt will take the floor at for
ward. Senior John Revelli,
who along with Jones is a pre
season All-America can
didate, will start at center.

starters is Hunt, a 6-toot-3, 195-

"He's had some good

Hunt.
Revelli is recovering from a
knee injury he sustained last
January that sidelined him for
most of the Pac-10 season and
prevented him from collecting
the numerous All-America and
All-Conference honors he
seemed destined to receive.
According to Davis, Revelli
has recovered 100 percent
from the injury, but will wear a
light knee brace tonight as a
protective measure. In his 15
games before the injury, the 6-
7, 220-pound senior averaged
19.1 points and 7.8 rebounds
per game.

Stanford fans will also get
their first look at Davis' three
freshman prospects — Grady
lohnson, Doug Wall and
Novian Whitsitt.
Though the Japan team is
the underdog in tonight's
game, it should not be taken
too lightly by Stanford. "I

Kitahara, the most valuable

in the first contest and an
amazing 37 in the second.
Japan also features one of
the tallest (and largest) basket
ball players in the world at
center, the 7-9%, 320-pound

Yasutaka Okayama.
Nicknamed "Chibi" (Japanese
for "tiny"), Okayama is tough

because of his size. Speed is
not one of his assets.

Stanford center John Revelli is back in full strength this year
after suffering a knee injury last season that sidelined him for
the better part of the Pacific-10 Conference season. He will,
however, wear a protective knee brace in tonight's exhibi
tion game.
Stanford fans will get a
sneak preview of the 1983-84
Cardinal basketball team in a
special showing tonight
against the Japanese National
Team. Showtime is 7:30 p.m.
at Maples Pavilion.
Coach Tom Davis, who with
a 14-14 record last year led
Stanford to its first non-losing
season in 10 years, kicks off
his second campaign with the
Cardinal in tonight's exhibi

tion contest with Japan.
Though the game will not
count towards Stanford's
overall record, it does carry
importance as far as Davis and
his team are concerned.
Stanford calls the )apanese
squad "old friends" because
the Card hoopsters played
against it twice last summer at
the Kirin World Games, a tour
team international basketball
tournament hosted by Japan.
"The entertainment and

hospitality we received in
japan was first-rate in every
way," Davis said yesterday at a
news conference. "We
couldn't have been treated
better."
Stanford beat japan in both
meetings last june, once in
Nagoya 94-74 and once in
Toyko 119-98, and can be con
sidered the favorite tonight.
Davis, however, does not
plan to use the exhibition
game as simply a workout for

his players. And although the
Card has been officially prac
ticing for barely more than
two weeks, Davis hopes to get
a good indication of his team's
progress in tonight's game.
"We'll use all our plays, our
whole package and then
review it," Davis said, indica
ting he will take an especially
close look at the Card's man
to-man defense and its fast
break.
Because of Davis' pressing
and fast-breaking brand of
basketball, Stanford was the
second highest scoring team
in the Pacific-10 Conference
last year. "I think we're capa
ble of being an even higher
scoring team than we were a
year ago," he prophesized.
Another feature of Davis'
coaching is his frequent sub
stituting, something he'll do
even more often against
Japan. "We'll play a lot more
players than we would in the
regular season," he said.
