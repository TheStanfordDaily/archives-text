# Ticket sales ex-selling

### MARK ZEIGLER 
While football season is still three weeks
from completion and the official start of
Stanford's basketball season is not until
Nov. 26, it is certainly not too early to be
thinking about basketball tickets.
In fact, it may soon be too late.
More than 6700 season tickets have been
purchased for the upcoming Cardinal hoop
campaign in a ticket sales drive unequalled
in Stanford history. Fewer than 800 season
tickets in the 7457-seat Maples Pavilion are
left.
And if ticket sales continue at their pres
ent pace, Maples Pavilion will be sold-out
for all the Cardinal's 17 home contests
before the first shot is taken in the first
game.
The biggest push has been in the Stanford
community, especially with the students.
Nearly half the 6700 figure are student tick
ets, an amazing amount compared to two
years ago when just 123 student season tick
ets were sold.
The man behind the surge in season tick
ets sales is Steve Odell, who graduated from

Stanford in june.
"College basketball is one of the best en
tertainment values out there," Odell said
yesterday, "especially for the price we're
selling it at."
Basketball was especially exciting on the
Farm last year mostly due to first-year coach
Tom Davis' brand of play, one that is non
stop action on all 94 feet of the court and all
40 minutes on the clock.
In Davis' inaugural season at Stanford, the
former Boston College coach guided the
Card to its first non-losing season in 10
years. And with All-American candidates
John Revelli and Keith jones returning for
their senior seasons, Davis does not think a
post-season tournament bid is out of the
question.
Another reason for the increased ticket
sales is Stanford's home schedule. Besides
the usual Pacific-10 Conference foes like
UCLA and Oregon State, Coach Dean
Smith's highly-rated North Carolina Tar
Heels will roll into Maples Pavilion for two
games in December as part of the Hewlett-
Packard Stanford Invitational tournament.
