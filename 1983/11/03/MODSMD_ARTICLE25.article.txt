The Stanford men's soccer
team will have a chance to
warm up before the University
of San Francisco game on
Wednesday when the Cardinal
faces a strong U.S. Interna
tional University team today at
3 p.m.
USIU almost h.id a shot at
making the NCAA playoffs un
til it lost 2-1 to UCLA. The loss
puts USIU at 10 7-1 for the
season.
On the other hand (or foot),
Stanford playoft hopes are
alive and well after winning its
fifth game in a row Stanford
Coach Nelson Lodge believes
his team will peak by the USF
game. Therefore today's game
is very important for Stanford
if it is to build up momentum
for USF and possibly the
playoffs.
The selection committee
will choose a division winner
from the Pacific Soccer Con
ference and the Southern Col
legiate International Soccer
Association for an extended
season in the playoffs. It may
also choose up to two wild
card teams from both these
divisions.

Stanford will not win the
PS( division but the Cardinal
may be picked for the wild
card position.
The selection committee
will surely take a careful look
at a team that has beaten the
eighth-ranked team in the na
tion, Cal. But the real test will
come for Stanford when it
plays USF and Fresno, who are
also, jockeying for the same
wild card position.
Today's game against USIU
is not a walkover for the Car
dinal. USIU is a melting pot of
skilled foreign soccer players,
who have been playing soccer
all their lives.
For example, Gary Vander
molon from Southern England
leads USIU's attack and his
league in scoring with
goals. Also in the forward po
sition is Rachid El Bekraouj
from Morocco. He has tallied
nine goals this season but was
first in scoring last year. Both
sophomores are very danger
ous on offense.
Stanford goes into the game
12-5-2, and needs all the wins
it can get to gain a vote from
the committee for a playoff
