# Killifer's kilters kill Long Beach St.

### JOHN LIS 
With its hopes of making the NCAA
playoffs all but ended following last Satur
day's 1-0 loss to UC-Berkeley, the Stan
ford women's field hockey team closed
out its 1983 season with an uninspired 2-0
win over visiting Long Beach State.
Coach Onnie Killefer realized that,
after the loss to Cal, the team appeared to
be playing out the string. "There was a lot
of just going through the motions and
getting the job done, " she said. "It was
not one of our stronger performances.
The Cardinal controlled the tirst half,
outshooting the overmatched 49ers, 16-3,
but came out with only one goal. That
came 12:08 into the game, when junior
forward Karen Chamberlain took a pass
off a penalty corner and fed freshman
midfielder Mary Chung in front of the
Long Beach State net. Chung put the ball
behind the 49er netminder for her eighth

goal of the season.
Stanford got another excellent scoring
opportunity with under a minute left in
the half when senior forward Patsy Hunt
ington broke in alone on the Long Beach
State goalie. Huntington decked the
goalie out of position, but fired wide.
Stanford controlled the first seven
minutes of the second halt, but the 49ers
then took the play to the Cardinal. Long
Beach State got three quick shots in close
on Stanford goalie Bonnie Warner, but
Warner was equal to the task.
Stanford got the next scoring opportu
nity near the 15-minute mark when junior
forward Jennifer Bleakley broke in all
alone on goal, but the 49er goalie came
up with the save.
Stanford's second goal came at the
30:25 mark of the second half. Hunting
ton took a pass directly off a penalty cor
ner at the top of the penalty circle and

fired it into the lower right-hand corner ot
the cage. It was Huntington's ninth goal
of the season, high for the Cardinal this
year.
Long Beach State tried to break the ice
in the final four minutes, but Warner and
the Stantord detense held on for the
shutout.
Stanford, ranked No. 14 in the nation in
this week's NCAA poll, tinishes the year
with a 10-8-1 record, barring a highly
unlikely NCAA tournament bid. The
squad will lose only five seniors from this
year's team â€” starters Julie Erman,
Valerie lackson and Linda De Los Reyes,
along with Terri Boyle and Mary
Donahue. Though a senior, Huntington
was redshirted last year, and should
return next season to join 11 other return
ing lettermen.

The Stanford's women's field hockey team easily defeated Long Beach State 2-0 at home yes
terday. Due to last Saturday's loss to UC-Berkeley, however, the Cardinal's chances of
making the playoffs are considered slim.
