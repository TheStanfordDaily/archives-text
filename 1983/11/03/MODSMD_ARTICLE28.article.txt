They tore down the goal posts
in Corvallis, Oregon last Satur
day.
The Oregon State students dis
mantled the first goal post with
0:02 left on the clock and were
asked to clear the field so the
game could be finished.
Oregon State had not won the
Rose Bowl. The Beavers hadn't
even beaten their in-state rivals,
the Oregon Ducks. They had
beaten Stanford, their roommate
in the Pacific-10 Conference cel
lar.
But the fact that they had won
was what counted. Won in the
Pac-10, that is. Won for the first
time in the conference since
1979.
While Oregon State's football
program had risen to new heights

with the victory, Stanford s pro
gram had hit the bottom of a pit it
has been falling into for the last
five years.
Ever since Bill Walsh left for the
head coaching job with the San
Francisco 49ers, Stanford football
has gone downhill. Walsh's
second and last team went 8-4,
including a thrilling 25-22 win
over Georgia in the Bluebonnet
Bowl.
Since that 1978 season, Stan
ford football has been a losing
proposition. The Card went 5-5-1
in 1979, 6-5 in 1980, 4-7 in 1981, 5-
6 in 1982 and is 1-7 in 1983. That
adds up to a 21-30-1 record A.B.
(After Bill).
And now, after four years of
mediocrity, Stanford football is
about to know how teams like
Oregon State feel year in and

year out. Unless the Card does
what at this point appears to be
the impossible and wins all three
of its last games, numbers like 1-
10 or 2-9 will suddenly become a
reality.
They are numbers that bring
hate mail to the Athletic Depart
ment and coaches' resignation
notices to the athletic director.
But they are also numbers that
shouldn't matter in collegiate
athletics.
In principle, 1-10 or 2-9
shouldn't make a difference. In
dollars and sense, unfortunately,
they do.
The Stanford Athletic Depart
ment recently admitted it overes
timated its projected income
from football this season. The de
partment is already $400,000 in
the red.

Some reports said the problem
stems from the department plan
ning on 10,000 more fans at the
last two home games and one na
tional television appearance.
What they forgot to plan on
was a one- or two-win season.
Now they're paying the price, so
to speak.
It's sad that college football has
turned into big business. Most
NCAA Division I schools depend
on their football programs to pay
for the minor sports. Stanford is
no exception.
As goes the football team, so
goes the Athletic Department.
It's too bad that's the way it is,
but that's the way it is.
And if this wasn't something
new to the folks over in the Ath
letic Department before the 19JH
football season, it is now.
