## The
						wrong way for this 'World' 
### MIKE HALE 
A San Francisco critic has called
Berkeley Repertory Theatre's current
production of The Way of the World
"relatively painless." Fie meant this as
praise — Restoration comedy, after all,
is so convoluted, and the language is
so hard to understand, and the plays
are just plain boring, don't you know?
Well, I don't know — the last thing
The Way of the World and The Beaux'
Strategem and The Country Wife are is
boring. And they're not hard to follow
if you pay attention, certainly no more
difficult than Shakespeare. The
Chronicle critic's comment shed light
mainly on his own close-mindedness;
but it also (accidentally) got to the
heart of what's wrong with the
Berkeley Rep production. The compa
ny has taken a play whose virtue is that
it's wildly entertaining at the same as
it's the nastiest, cruelest, most cynical
play in the English language, and
turned it into a comedy of manners —
and a "sparkling" comedy of manners
at that.
This doesn't mean the production is
bad. It's a huge crowd-pleaser, it's full
of good (if narrow) performances, and
it's often very funny. But Berkeley
Rep's approach robs the play of its
power in a number of ways, large and
small, and finally deadens it. A parlor
comedy about nasty people just can't
hold up over three hours.

The situation in the play is really per
fectly simple. Mirabell loves Mil
lamant, but Millamant's aunt, Lady
Wishfort, hates Mirabell and will dis
own Millamant if the two marry, so
Mirabell has his servant Waitwell im
personate a gentleman and make love
to Lady Wishfort, who can be com
promised in the ensuing scandal; Mrs.
Marwood, who secretly loves Mirabell
also but is stuck in an affair with
Mirabell's friend Fainall, uncovers the
plot, but Mrs. Fainall, Lady Wishfort's
daughter, who once had an affair with
Mirabell but was forced by him to
marry Fainall when she appeared to be
pregnant, takes Mirabell's side. See?
No problem.
As you might gather from the plot,
these are not endearing characters.
Everyone in the play is, if not down
right evil, manipulative in some way,
and all excuse their actions by saying
that duplicity is "the way of the
world." Some of them, though — es
pecially Mirabell and Millamant, and
Mrs. Fainall — are attractive because of
their wit, and their verbal prowess.
The play's power lies in this split —
you are simultaneously drawn by the
characters' brilliance, and repelled by
their insincerity.
Director Albert Takazauckas has
taken one side of this — the wit — and
built his whole production around it.

This is a production of marvelous
surfaces, with beautifully costumed
(by Deborah Dryden) actors gliding
across beautiful sets (by Bernard
Vyzga) beautifully mouthing the
dialogue and bringing out the play's
comic elements as strongly as possi
ble. But when the characters do ter
rible things — when MarwooeJ betrays
Mirabell, when Fainall makes his bid
for Lady Wishfort's fortune — we don't
know how to respond; Takazauckas
either rushes the moments past us or
plays them as farce. And crucial
scenes, such as the one in which
Mirabell and Millamant agree on the
terms under which they can stand to
live with one another, are halt over
before you realize they're to be taken
seriously.
As usual at Berkeley Rep, the acting
and design outshine the direction.
Wayne Alexander, in his first perfor
mance with the company, is an in
tensely charming Mirabell; Michelle
Morain is a bit mousy as Millamant,
but brings an insouciance to the role
that goes well with Takazautkas' ap
proach. Most impressive is Berkeley
Rep veteran Charles Dean as Fainall —
he's the only performer who really
works against the grain here, bringing
some needed gravity to the produc
tion. It's almost as if Malvolio had
stumbled into the wrong play
