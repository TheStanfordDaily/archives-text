# University receives a record $91 million in private donations
## 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Senior staff writer 
The University received a record
breaking $91.9 million in private
monetary gifts during the 1982-83
fiscal year, making it the most suc
cessful fund-raising year ever, ac
cording to the Office of Develop
ment.
David Fulton, the Office of Devel
opment's director of communica
tions, said Stanford is now in second
place among American universities
in terms of donations received each
year.
The new figure surpasses the pre
vious record of $79.5 million raised
by Stanford in the 1980-81 fiscal
year.
According to figures released by
the Development Office, Stanford
averaged $67.7 million in annual
donations for the five years prior to
last year.
For the past 20 years, Harvard has
ranked first in donations and Stan
ford has nearly always ranked
second, Fulton said, noting that Yale
captured the second place slot in
the 1981-82 fiscal year.
Fulton noted that Harvard, which
raised $126 million last year, has
been in existence longer than Stan

ford, and also has a "richer alumni
body."
Major financial gifts to the Univer
sity — donations of $25,000 or more
from living individuals — accounted
for most of this year's dramatic in
crease, Fulton said.
In the five years prior to the last
fiscal year, major gifts averaged
$14.9 million per year. Last year
Stanford received $21.2 million in
major gifts.
Fulton said this increase could be
attributed primarily to the economic
recovery that occurred during this
period.
"I think it happened because
there were a lot of gifts that were
motivated by a very, very dramatical
ly improved stock market and busi
ness climate," Fulton said.
He indicated that the University
did not seem to have done anything
in particular that would have
sparked such an unprecedented in
crease in donation dollars.
In addition to major gifts, the Uni
versity received approximately $25
million from corporations and an
other $25 million from charitable
foundations and associations.
Fulton explained that these types
of funds are usually restricted by the
donors. He noted that research

foundations will usually contribute
money for specific research at Stan
ford, and that corporations often
donate money specifically to the
Graduate School of Business or to
research that directly relates to the
corporation's business.
Donors designate very few gifts
for humanities studies, Fulton said.
The total amount obtained from
trusts and bequests last year was
$12.4 million, and the University's
Annual Fund, which solicits all
alumni each year, raised $10 million.

The Annual Fund, which solicits
donations via mail and phone ap
peals, is subdivided into three
categories: the General Appeal Pro
gram, seeking annual gifts of up to
$34 ci the Personal Solicitation Pro
gram, seeking gifts of $350 to
$10,000; and the Special Gift Pro
gram, seeking gifts of $10,000 to
$25,000
The Fund also has four programs
based on the nature and interests of
its prospective donors: Parents,
Stanford University Now (dealing
with younger alumni), Student De
velopment and Class Funds.
The Office of Development is re
sponsible for conducting the Uni
versity fund-raising program. It
relies heavily on a group of veteran
volunteer fund raisers who, accor
ding to Fulton, "are mostly alumni
(and who) are mostly people who
have an especially strong interest in
the University.
"Now those people have an ex
tremely important role in our
scheme of things: They are both
facilitators, and they are askers,"
Fulton said.
Fulton explained that each volun
teer is assigned a number of
prospective donors. The volunteer


David Fulton

is expected to keep in close contact
with each of these individuals and to
attempt to pursuade each person to
donate a large sum of money to the
University.
This process sometimes takes
many years, Fulton said.
