# Ex-Doobie on his own
## McDonald: barely worth it 
### SCOTT AREY 
When ex-Doobie Brother
Michael McDonald took the
stage for his final show at the
Circle Star Theatre last Friday
night, I had to ask myself,
"Will the somewhat lack
luster Mike be able to hold the
audience's attention without
the contrast of the Doobie's
pop-rock hits (by Patrick Sim
mons and Tom Johnston) and
their syncopated R & B to set
him up?" Well, the answer
turned out to be "yes" but
just by a couple of ear hairs.
I had often gone past the
Circle Star on my way to the
San Francisco airport, but I
had never really considered
going to a concert there, so
for those of you who find
yourself in a similar situation, I
will give a brief description of
the theatre.
The Circle Star(CS) has the
virtue of not having one bad
seat in the house, the only
drawback being that there is
not one good seat in the
house either. It is basically a
theatre in the round with a
revolving stage, giving the
viewer a good look at all the
possible perspectives, while
making him a little dizzy and
in some cases nauseous.
While the CS does have
some of the "hoity-toity" trap
pings one might expect to find
in a more local setting, such as
the usual cheap California
swill in fake Waterford crystal
plastic cups, the audience was
definitely not of that charac
ter.
Due to an awful accident on
101 and some specious
vehicular misinformation I
missed some of the warm-up
and what I did see made me
deeply regret it. The warm-up
person was Jack Tempchin, a
singer/songwriter who just
happened to be hanging out
with the Glenn Frey/Don FHen
ley gang around the time the
Eagles band was put together.
Although he never played
with the band, they recorded a
number of his songs which
became "smash-hits," such as
"Peaceful Easy Feeling" and
"Party Town." Tempchin was
witty and forthright and did as
much with one acoustic guitar
and his voice as most men do
with a full band.
Despite Tempchin's ad

mirable performance the audi
ence was unquestionably anx
ious to see McDonald, who
hasn't played the Bay Area
since the Doobie's farewell
tour (which was not exactly a
major success). McDonald
came out after his band and
instead of going right into his
first mini-set the way most
bands do, he addressed the
crowd.
Because McDonald's speak
ing voice is so strikingly differ
ent from his distinct singing
voice, for a second some
people looked like they felt
they had come to the wrong
show. But before confusion
could set in McDonald con
cluded his intro and jumped
right into his Doobie Brothers'
hit "Real Love."

This number, which I
thought would win a Grammy
when it first came out, was the
best performed of the show.
The band, particularly the
drummer, was fresh, eagar,
crisp and tight. It almost
seemed like a reincarnation of
the Doobies. With star players
Willie Weeks on bass, and
Edgar Winner (that's right) on
keyboards, sax, percussion
and vocals, the band cruised
through a seemingly inspired
version of the McDonald tune
"If That's What It Takes," from
his solo ablum of the same
name. Winner, who calls his
home N.Y.C., looked like the
spirit of Michael McDonald
yet to come, with silver white
beard and hair to match
crowning a tall, gaunt frame.
When the band came to its
third tune, "Keep this Train
Runnin' " from the "One Step

Closer" album, things began
to change. The drummer, who
I ultimately concluded was
swopping energy for talent at
wholesale prices, started to
slow down, and began to rely
on veteran Weeks to keep the
beat. The impact of this on the
band's crispness coefficient
was devastating.
The other problem with the
solo McDonald show was the
understated character of
McDonald having nothing to
offset it, other than one wild,
but good attempt by Winner at
"Keep on PI ay in ' Rock 'n'
Roll." Missing were the great
Doobie rockers like "China
Grove" or "Long Train Run
ning." Those tunes help
create a receptive atmosphere
for the more funky-bluesy
McDonald tunes like "What a
Fool Believes," and "Minute
by Minute." While both those
tunes were featured in
McDonald's solo show, they
just didn't have the same im
pact on the audience as they
did when he played with the
Doobies. McDonald's
humility before the crowd as
well as in his music and inter
action with other players,
served to give a dull edge to
the remainder of the show's
tunes, with three noteworthy
exceptions.
First, "You Belong to Me,"
the tune written with Carly
Simon off of the "Livin' on the
Fault Line" album, with Weeks
on Fender precision and
McDonald himself covering
the horns on one of his two
Yamaha DX-7s, was spectacu
lar. Second, "I Keep Forgettin'
" off of his solo album, an
other Weeks special perfor
mance (though it lacked the
Steve Gadd riffs on the end of
the studio tracks). And finally,
a surprise tune that McDonald
did as an encore: "The Only
Way We Can," made famous
by Patti Austin, a McDonald
cohort from the Steely Dan
days.
These three songs,
combined with the first three
and minus an awful version of
"Takin' it to the Streets,"
made the McDonald show a
marginal success, worth
seeing, worth the price of ad
mission, but offered no rea
son to return.

instead of going right into his
first mini-set the way most
bands do, he addressed the
crowd.
Because McDonald's speak
ing voice is so strikingly differ
ent from his distinct singing
voice, for a second some
people looked like they felt
they had come to the wrong
show. But before confusion
could set in McDonald con
cluded his intro and jumped
right into his Doobie Brothers'
hit "Real Love."

This number, which I
thought would win a Grammy
when it first came out, was the
best performed of the show.
The band, particularly the
drummer, was fresh, eagar,
crisp and tight. It almost
seemed like a reincarnation of
the Doobies. With star players
Willie Weeks on bass, and
Edgar Winner (that's right) on
keyboards, sax, percussion
and vocals, the band cruised
through a seemingly inspired
version of the McDonald tune
"If That's What It Takes," from
his solo ablum of the same
name. Winner, who calls his
home N.Y.C., looked like the
spirit of Michael McDonald
yet to come, with silver white
beard and hair to match
crowning a tall, gaunt frame.
When the band came to its
third tune, "Keep this Train
Runnin' " from the "One Step

Closer" album, things began
to change. The drummer, who
I ultimately concluded was
swopping energy for talent at
wholesale prices, started to
slow down, and began to rely
on veteran Weeks to keep the
beat. The impact of this on the
band's crispness coefficient
was devastating.
The other problem with the
solo McDonald show was the
understated character of
McDonald having nothing to
offset it, other than one wild,
but good attempt by Winner at
"Keep on PI ay in ' Rock 'n'
Roll." Missing were the great
Doobie rockers like "China
Grove" or "Long Train Run
ning." Those tunes help
create a receptive atmosphere
for the more funky-bluesy
McDonald tunes like "What a
Fool Believes," and "Minute
by Minute." While both those
tunes were featured in
McDonald's solo show, they
just didn't have the same im
pact on the audience as they
did when he played with the
Doobies. McDonald's
humility before the crowd as
well as in his music and inter
action with other players,
served to give a dull edge to
the remainder of the show's
tunes, with three noteworthy
exceptions.
First, "You Belong to Me,"
the tune written with Carly
Simon off of the "Livin' on the
Fault Line" album, with Weeks
on Fender precision and
McDonald himself covering
the horns on one of his two
Yamaha DX-7s, was spectacu
lar. Second, "I Keep Forgettin'
" off of his solo album, an
other Weeks special perfor
mance (though it lacked the
Steve Gadd riffs on the end of
the studio tracks). And finally,
a surprise tune that McDonald
did as an encore: "The Only
Way We Can," made famous
by Patti Austin, a McDonald
cohort from the Steely Dan
days.
These three songs,
combined with the first three
and minus an awful version of
"Takin' it to the Streets,"
made the McDonald show a
marginal success, worth
seeing, worth the price of ad
mission, but offered no rea
son to return.


Michael McDonald
When ex-Doobie Brother
Michael McDonald took the
stage for his final show at the
Circle Star Theatre last Friday
night, I had to ask myself,
"Will the somewhat lack
luster Mike be able to hold the
audience's attention without
the contrast of the Doobie's
pop-rock hits (by Patrick Sim
mons and Tom Johnston) and
their syncopated R & B to set
him up?" Well, the answer
turned out to be "yes" but
just by a couple of ear hairs.
I had often gone past the
Circle Star on my way to the
San Francisco airport, but I
had never really considered
going to a concert there, so
for those of you who find
yourself in a similar situation, I
will give a brief description of
the theatre.
The Circle Star(CS) has the
virtue of not having one bad
seat in the house, the only
drawback being that there is
not one good seat in the
house either. It is basically a
theatre in the round with a
revolving stage, giving the
viewer a good look at all the
possible perspectives, while
making him a little dizzy and
in some cases nauseous.
While the CS does have
some of the "hoity-toity" trap
pings one might expect to find
in a more local setting, such as
the usual cheap California
swill in fake Waterford crystal
plastic cups, the audience was
definitely not of that charac
ter.
Due to an awful accident on
101 and some specious
vehicular misinformation I
missed some of the warm-up
and what I did see made me
deeply regret it. The warm-up
person was Jack Tempchin, a
singer/songwriter who just
happened to be hanging out
with the Glenn Frey/Don FHen
ley gang around the time the
Eagles band was put together.
Although he never played
with the band, they recorded a
number of his songs which
became "smash-hits," such as
"Peaceful Easy Feeling" and
"Party Town." Tempchin was
witty and forthright and did as
much with one acoustic guitar
and his voice as most men do
with a full band.
Despite Tempchin's ad

mirable performance the audi
ence was unquestionably anx
ious to see McDonald, who
hasn't played the Bay Area
since the Doobie's farewell
tour (which was not exactly a
major success). McDonald
came out after his band and
instead of going right into his
first mini-set the way most
bands do, he addressed the
crowd.
Because McDonald's speak
ing voice is so strikingly differ
ent from his distinct singing
voice, for a second some

could set in McDonald con
cluded his intro and jumped
