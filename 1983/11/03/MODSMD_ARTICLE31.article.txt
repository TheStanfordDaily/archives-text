# 'Spokesong' is both timely and entertaining

Theatre Works opened its 15th
Winter Festival Friday night at the
Lucie Stern Community Center in
Palo Alto with a production of
Spokesong by Stewart Parker. The
play is about tradition and violence
in Northern Ireland; it seemed par
ticularly relevant in places because
of the nature of last week's
headlines. While the play itself has
some faults, director Robert kelley
brings out both the humor and hor
ror of life in modern Belfast and
creates an often tunny, occasionally
moving and always interesting
show.
The structure of the play is a bit
unusual. The stories of a modern
day bicycle shop keeper, Frank
Stock (Steven Young) and of his
grandfather (George Ward) are in
terwoven. In between the jumps
h«ifk and forth through time, two

men (Eric Wenburg and Richard
tdgar) referred to as "trick cyclists"
do song-and-dance homage to the
bicycle. In the modern section of
the story, the bicycle shop is going
to be torn down to make room for a
new highway. Frank, convinced that
the combustion engine is the root of
all evil, proposes that free bicycles
be provided in the city center to
eliminate the need tor the new high
way system, a proposal that does
not fare well.
While this fight is pending, he
meets and woos the girl of his
dreams, appropriately named Daisy
Bell (Jod i Babbington). Their
courtship is interrupted by the
return of her cynical brother Julian
(Jeff Schwamberger) from London,
who has come home to sell the old
shop. Young, as the slightly crazy
shopkeeper, has some wonderful
moments demonstrating his obses
sion with the bikes. When Daisy first

brings in her bicycle tor repair, he
waltzes gleefully around with it.
When he begins to take it apart, in
order to examine it, he plays out a
wonderful and hysterical seduction
scene with the bike. He also has
little lecture routines that he plavs
out for Daisy, such as "The History
of the Bicycle."
These speeches are marvelous as
examples of poetic Irish oratory and
are well-acted and well-staged. Bab
bington gives a winning and charm
ing performance as Daisy, a school
teacher hardened by the realities of
life in Belfast. Her speech to Frank in
the second act when she decides to
leave the city is a brilliantly per
formed recreation of a difficult and
moving piece and is the high point
of the show. Schwamberger is also
very good as Julian. His superb
delivery of the cynical lines (for ex
ample, when the pet shop next door
is blown up, "For one glorious mo

ment, it was actually raining cats and
dogs") acts as excellent counter
point to the flowery idealism of his
brother.
The grandfather's story, in con
trast to the violence of the other, is a
rather gentle love story. The kind
and rather ineffectual Francis,
whose most important memory is of
being the first bike racer to use
pneumatic tires, finds and marries
the girl of his dreams, Kitty (Vicki
Willey), who is a little more progres
sive than he bargained for.
Together, they share a vision of
the bicycle as bringing new freedom
and life to mankind. Ward is very
engaging as the sweet Francis, and
his obsession seems rather charm
ing. Willey is a bit less successful as
the often acerbic Kitty, and doesn't
quite give enough humanity to the
character.

As the play progresses, we
become increasingly aware of the
ironic nature of the bicycle-filled
dreams of the protagonists. Their vi
sions of the world made safe by
their two-wheeled panacea have
clearly been made dim by the
realities of the modern world, and it
becomes increasingly painful to
watch Frank cling to tradition as the
world explodes around him. The
continual vaudevillian routines by
the trick cyclists help point out the
distance between the dreams and
reality, though they don't always
work well. Richard tdgar, especially,
is a bit cloying at times. However, in
general, these bits of business are
tunny and do help the show along.
The ending does not live up to its
general promise. A long drunken
monologue by Young does not work
very well, and drags a good deal.
The "happy" ending that is grafted
onto the show does not ring true

amid the sounds of violence and
hopelessness that have been heard
so clearly throughout the evening.
Still, as a whole the production is
well worth seeing.
After a week of violence of various
types around the world, Spokesong
hits home in a variety of ways. Refer
ences to automobiles as instruments
of violence drew especially poignant
reactions from the audience. The
lovely set (by W. Truett Roberts) and
lighting ( by John Rathman) as well as
Fumiko Bielefeldt's costumes care
fully create a world steeped in lore
and tradition. The fact that violence
pervades the same world makes the
play a thought-provoking one at this
particular time. The production runs
through Nov. 12, and, at a time
when looking at the world situation
makes one feel, in the words of Tom
Lehrer, "like a Christian Scientist
with appendicitis," it provides an in
teresting set of ideas to ponder.

terwoven. In between the jumps
h«ifk and forth through time, two

men (Eric Wenburg and Richard
tdgar) referred to as "trick cyclists"
do song-and-dance homage to the
bicycle. In the modern section of
the story, the bicycle shop is going
to be torn down to make room for a
new highway. Frank, convinced that
the combustion engine is the root of
all evil, proposes that free bicycles
be provided in the city center to
eliminate the need tor the new high
way system, a proposal that does
not fare well.
While this fight is pending, he
meets and woos the girl of his
dreams, appropriately named Daisy
Bell (Jod i Babbington). Their
courtship is interrupted by the
return of her cynical brother Julian
(Jeff Schwamberger) from London,
who has come home to sell the old
shop. Young, as the slightly crazy
shopkeeper, has some wonderful
moments demonstrating his obses
sion with the bikes. When Daisy first

brings in her bicycle tor repair, he
waltzes gleefully around with it.
When he begins to take it apart, in
order to examine it, he plays out a
wonderful and hysterical seduction
scene with the bike. He also has
little lecture routines that he plavs
out for Daisy, such as "The History
of the Bicycle."
These speeches are marvelous as
examples of poetic Irish oratory and
are well-acted and well-staged. Bab
bington gives a winning and charm
ing performance as Daisy, a school
teacher hardened by the realities of
life in Belfast. Her speech to Frank in
the second act when she decides to
leave the city is a brilliantly per
formed recreation of a difficult and
moving piece and is the high point
of the show. Schwamberger is also
very good as Julian. His superb
delivery of the cynical lines (for ex
ample, when the pet shop next door
is blown up, "For one glorious mo

ment, it was actually raining cats and
dogs") acts as excellent counter
point to the flowery idealism of his
brother.
The grandfather's story, in con
trast to the violence of the other, is a
rather gentle love story. The kind
and rather ineffectual Francis,
whose most important memory is of
being the first bike racer to use
pneumatic tires, finds and marries
the girl of his dreams, Kitty (Vicki
Willey), who is a little more progres
sive than he bargained for.
Together, they share a vision of
the bicycle as bringing new freedom
and life to mankind. Ward is very
engaging as the sweet Francis, and
his obsession seems rather charm
ing. Willey is a bit less successful as
the often acerbic Kitty, and doesn't
quite give enough humanity to the
character.

As the play progresses, we
become increasingly aware of the
ironic nature of the bicycle-filled
dreams of the protagonists. Their vi
sions of the world made safe by
their two-wheeled panacea have
clearly been made dim by the
realities of the modern world, and it
becomes increasingly painful to
watch Frank cling to tradition as the
world explodes around him. The
continual vaudevillian routines by
the trick cyclists help point out the
distance between the dreams and
reality, though they don't always
work well. Richard tdgar, especially,
is a bit cloying at times. However, in
general, these bits of business are
tunny and do help the show along.
The ending does not live up to its
general promise. A long drunken
monologue by Young does not work
very well, and drags a good deal.
The "happy" ending that is grafted
onto the show does not ring true

amid the sounds of violence and
hopelessness that have been heard
so clearly throughout the evening.
Still, as a whole the production is
well worth seeing.
After a week of violence of various
types around the world, Spokesong
hits home in a variety of ways. Refer
ences to automobiles as instruments
of violence drew especially poignant
reactions from the audience. The
lovely set (by W. Truett Roberts) and
lighting ( by John Rathman) as well as
Fumiko Bielefeldt's costumes care
fully create a world steeped in lore
and tradition. The fact that violence
pervades the same world makes the
play a thought-provoking one at this
particular time. The production runs
through Nov. 12, and, at a time
when looking at the world situation
makes one feel, in the words of Tom
Lehrer, "like a Christian Scientist
with appendicitis," it provides an in
teresting set of ideas to ponder.
Theatre Works opened its 15th
Winter Festival Friday night at the
Lucie Stern Community Center in
Palo Alto with a production of
Spokesong by Stewart Parker. The
play is about tradition and violence
in Northern Ireland; it seemed par
ticularly relevant in places because
of the nature of last week's
headlines. While the play itself has
some faults, director Robert kelley
brings out both the humor and hor
ror of life in modern Belfast and
creates an often tunny, occasionally
moving and always interesting
show.
The structure of the play is a bit
unusual. The stories of a modern
day bicycle shop keeper, Frank
Stock (Steven Young) and of his
grandfather (George Ward) are in
terwoven. In between the jumps

men (Eric Wenburg and Richard
tdgar) referred to as "trick cyclists"
