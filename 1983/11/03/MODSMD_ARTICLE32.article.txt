# The
						return of the Animals: finally a happy reunion
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Ever since Abbott and Cos
tello broke up, people have
been clamoring for reunions.
It it's not talk of Liz and Dick
getting back together, then
it's the reunion of the Brady
Bunch. People, basically, hate
change and they love to live
nostalgically. Reunions,
therefore, accomplish the
bringing back of more youth
ful, and supposedly, more
cheerful times.
This is all good and well, ex
cept, for the most part, these
reunions desecrate and ruin
the past images ot the original
participants. Rather than
reuniting for artistic reasons,
most reunions just try to get in
on all the cash that was missed
the tirst time around.
This sad case of reunions is
ever present in the music in
dustry as well. Disbanded
groups who never deserved to
record even one album in the
first place, see fit to return to
the rock world and cash in on
their nostalgic past. Even great
bands like the Byrds and the
Allman Brothers have had
reunions that have been utter
ly horrendous from a musical
standpoint. However, the
public is quite susceptible to
these reunions no matter what
their musical competence.
Money is raked in at the cost
of musical ineptitude.
Therefore, when I heard the
"Original Animals" had
reunited, I almost started
crying. After all, this was a
classic British Invasion band
which between the years 1964
and 1967 put forth some of the
greatest blues rock anthems
ever â€” "House of the Rising
Sun," "It's My Life," "We

Gotta Get Out of This Place,"
Don't Bring Me Down;" the
list is endless. Therefore, why
should they reunite and dis
color the band's past glories?
Sure, Eric Burden, the
Animals' lead vocalist (or
more accurately, lead shouter)
may have some fine solo mo
ments (such as the top 10 hit
"Spill the Wine" with War),
but why take a risk on destroy
ing the name that the Animals
carved out for themselves in
rock history? Why should they
jeopardize their musical worth
for a couple of quick dollars?
Well, ironically, the best
rock and roll has often been
created when risk was in
\olved (for example, Dylan's
risky move from folk to
electric rock at the Newport
Folk Festival, or Clapton's
Layla album recorded when he
was heavily addicted to
heroin). In keeping with this
tradition, the Animals have left
their name untarnished by,
thankfully, putting out a fine,
bluesy reunion album called
Ark.
On initial hearing of the al
bum, it is apparent that the
Animals have lost none of
their original gutsy intensity.
With Eric Burden screaming
ferociously over tense, tight
R & B rift's, the band still com
mands a domineering and
defiant image. Even the lyrical
content of their songs reflects
this tough intensity. Instead of
the usual ditties of "boy-girl
infatuations" that dominate
too much of rock music, the
Animals use the same harsh
lyrical content that made them
famous.
In addition, Ark has some
fine touches that show the

band to be much more than a
bunch of sex-starved
musicians. "Love Is For All
Time" is an incredibly poig
nant reggae flavored ballad
that is sung with much
delicacy by Burden. There is
also a mean acoustic rocker,
"Hard Times," that is very re
flective of the times, and
"Night": a solid radio tune
with just the right enough of
synthesizer rifting to in
troduce the band to a
younger, more new-wave
oriented audience.
The best (and most surpris
ing) thing about this album
though, is that besides faring
well with the band's older '60s
material, the band plays with
an intensity unusual for a
bunch of guvs all around 40
years of age. This album and
their recent live shows this
summer were thoroughly
dynamic, tough, sweat-faced
ventures. In fact, they easily
pack more musical energy
than the majority of the new
wave bands around.
It is this same mixture of
musical dedication and power
that now hits the listener on
the Ark. Instead of a band of
"dinosaurs" cashing in on a
good name, as I originally
feared, the Animals' reunion
has turned out to be a redis
covery of the essence of rock
and roll, British Invasion style.
Is it any wonder, then, that the
majority of the pantheon of
present-day rock heroes are
such British Invasion
luminaries like the Who, Rol
ling Stones, Kinks and Eric
Clapton? Now, to this list, we
can add the Animals in per
manent black ink.
