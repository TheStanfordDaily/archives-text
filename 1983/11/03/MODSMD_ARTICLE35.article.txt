The last frontier
SPACE. Sometimes you need to

fill it. Sometimes they give you that
call at 2 a.m. and say, hey, you, write
a 26-inch Briefly. Now. So you sit
yourself down at a friendly Micro
term and you type. And sometimes
you write something good, like
"Lisa Lunch" or "Richard Lunch" or
even Heather Feather Whips And
Leather. And sometimes you just
come up blank and you can't even
think of anything funny to say about
Donald Kennedy because
everybody has already used up
those big words to say it all. There's
nothing left to do but type. And
wish Troy a happy birthday. Happy
birthday, misery.
