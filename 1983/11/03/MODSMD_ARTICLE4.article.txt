# Opposition to Quad renovation delays approval, not construction
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Opposition to the proposed plans for the renovation
of the Inner Quad courtyard has forced the postpone
ment of final approval of the design but will not affect
the project's construction schedule, according to Max
Mazenko, manager of the project.
In a meeting Oct. 31 the advisory committee on the
project decided to delay from December to February
the presentation of the plans for final approval to the
Board of Trustees.
Construction will still start early next summer as
originally planned, according to Mazenko, who said,
"at the 11th hour we had a strong appeal from mem
bers of the Art Department to look at the historical
aspects of the design."
Several professors in the Art Department oppose the
plans for the renovation as developed by the Facilities
Project Management Office. According to Gerard Kos
kovich, a graduate student in art history, "A fairly clear
consensus emerged in favor of supporting a more his

torically accurate approach" to the renovation project
at a meeting of about 15 Art Department faculty, staff
and students Oct. 31.
Those opposing the plan have said they believe more
attention should be paid to the original blueprints for
the Quad drawn by Frederick Olmsted, the noted
American landscape architect who designed the layout
of the campus with Leland Stanford. Some of these
blueprints were found in the University archives by
Koskovich, who opposes the plans for the renovation
proposed by the Project Management Office.
The proposed plans, designed by Anthony Cuzzardo
and Associates, will enlarge the eight planting circles to
88 feet in diameter, restore the two pathways to their
original concrete paving and pave the rest of the area
with red brick.
For Mazenko the issue is not "whether Olmsted de
signed a plan" but if and how much this original plan
should be changed. The historical issue is credible, he
said, but the planners had to use their judgment in cer-
tain aspects of the plan.
For example, because the original
plans made no provision for light
ing, the project's planners had to
make a decision on the type of lights
to use, Mazenko said.
"No one is arguing that the basic
geometries of the space aren't his
(Olmsted's)," Mazenko said, but
those overseeing the renovation
had to exercise judgment to fill in
the gaps" in Olmsted's plans.
He also said those pressing for a
historically accurate plan have them
selves suggested changes in
Olmsted's plans. Koskovich, he
said, has suggested that benches be
placed in the Quad, but Olmsted
never mentioned placing any there.
Koskovich called his suggestion
about benches "a possible solution
to the seating problem" because
seating and lighting were not ad
dressed in the Olmsted plan.
Wanda Corn, an associate profes

sor of art, said she opposes the cur
rent plan because "I would like to
see it done in the best way possible
... by preserving as much as possi
ble the Olmsted plan."
The advisory committee on the
project is planning to make a
presentation to the Administrative
Council next Wednesday on the
status of the project, while Kos
kovich and Assoc. Prof. Paul Turner
of the Art Department have planned
a forum on the proposed renovation
for next Tuesday.

events, according to Fulton. In
stead, the office relies much more
on contacts between an individual
fund raiser or a small group of fund
raisers and a prospective donor.
"A big fund-raising event that
could have immense consequences
for us is often a private lunch be
tween a volunteer and a prospective
donor, and maybe a University offi
cer or a faculty member," said Ful
ton.
"Most of our large fund-raising ef
forts really are very quietly done,"
said Fulton, "and they take the form
of individual transactions."
