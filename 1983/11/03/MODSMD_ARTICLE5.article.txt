U.S. troops to begin withdrawal
Point Salines, Grenada —U.S. officials yesterday
announced plans to withdraw about 2300 troops
from Grenada by tomorrow, a move they said would
reduce the U.S. military presence on the island to
about 3000.
The announcement came as 57 sick and wounded
Cubans and 10 Cuban doctors flew out of Grenada
en route home and diplomats in the Cuban embassy
in St. George's defied an order from Gov. Gen. Paul
Scoon to leave.
In Washington, the Pentagon said Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger had informed President
Reagan that all hostilities have ceased in Grenada

and U.S. forces would "begin a pullout within a few
days."
It was also announced that Vice Adm. Joseph Met
calf, who commanded the Grenada invasion last
week, has transferred responsibilities to Maj. Gen.
Edward Trobaugh, commander of the 82nd Airborne
Division, and to Brig. Rudyard Lewis, a Jamaican offi
cer commanding what U.S. officials called the
"Caribbean peace force" of several hundred troops
from neighboring islands. The Pentagon said the
two officers will coordinate their efforts through the
office of the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to
Grenada.
As the withdrawals were announced in Washing
ton, however, Navy officals said the aircraft carrier
USS America, in a nine-ship battle group, has left
Norfolk to conduct exercises in the western Atlantic
and eastern Caribbean. The officers insisted that the
new deployment was a routine exercise uncon
nected to events in Grenada.
U.S. military spokesman Maj. Douglas Frey said
here that about one-third of the troops remaining
would be stationed around St. George's. The others
will sweep the north to flush out any remaining
resistance to the 8-day-old invasion.
The impending withdrawal was clearly visible yes
terday as truckloads of sometimes whooping
paratroops in camouflage fatigues rolled toward the
Point Salines airport with trailers of weapons and
baggage in tow.
Paratroops dismantled an artillery base on a golf
course near the airport. One field gun was later seen
being loaded onto a C-141 jet transport at the air
port.
Shiites toughen stand
Geneva, Switzerland — Lebanese Shiite leader
Nabeh Berri yesterday called for the withdrawal of
all U.S. Marines from the Southern suburbs of Beirut
and said if they did not comply he would demand
that they leave the country altogether.
The toughened Shiite stand toward the U.S. pres
ence there came as Lebanon's national reconcilia
tion conference reached its first agreement — over
the Arab identity of Lebanon — and formally began
what is expected to be a long and possibly explosive
debate over the fate of the May 17 Lebanese-Israeli
agreement that Syria insists must be cancelled.
There were initial signs here yesterday, however,
that a way was being found to skirt the contentious
issue of that accord largely by freezing it for now
without formally cancelling it. This was understood
to be an acceptable alternative — to the United
States and possibly to Syria if not to Israel — to
prevent an impasse here over the accord.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Berri
said he had relayed his demands on the Marines to
U.S. Middle East envoy Richard Fairbanks, whom he
saw here three days ago and again Tuesday night.
"I ask the Marines to remove from that area," he
said referring to the southern suburbs, populated
mainly by Shiite Moslems.
If the Marines refuse to go, he said, he will ask for
their full withdrawal from Lebanon.
Indicating he was extremely worried about a

major confrontation between the Marines and the
Shiite militia in the southern suburbs, Berri said he
wanted them moved to another place in west Beirut
and replaced by the Italian or British forces in the
multinational peacekeeping force.
He said he was convinced the explosion that killed
more than 230 Marines at the Beirut airport last
month changed the nature of their mission in
Lebanon and that the Marines are now seeking a
confrontation with the Shiite Amal militia, which he
said had been falsely blamed for the bomb attack.
He said he had demanded an apology for accusa
tions by U.S. officials against Amal but that none had
come. This has left the impression in the American
public's mind that Amal was responsible, Berri said,
and he called the U.S. attitude "something like
racist."
Berri's demand that the Marines leave his area put
the United States in a difficult position, for it they
now stay, as is likely, the danger of a bloody con
frontation seems more likely that ever.
His comments came at the end of the third day of
the national reconciliation conference that he and
eight other Lebanese Moslem, Druze and Christian
leaders are holding in hopes of finding a way to end
more than eight years of political turmoil in that war
devastated land.
Reagan signs King bill
Washington — With the stroke of a pen on a cool
autumn morning, President Reagan ended the long
battle tor a national holiday honoring the Rev. Mar
tin Luther King Jr., saluting the slain civil rights
leader as a man who "stirred our nation to the very
depths of its soul."
The strains ot the civil rights anthem "We Shall
Overcome" welled up in the White House Rose Gar
den after the audience of black leaders, members of
Congress and veterans of the civil rights movement
watched Reagan sign legislation creating the nation
al holiday and hand the pen to King's widow.
Reagan did not join in the singing, but he was
praised by Loretta Scott King and others afterward
for remarks in which he warned that "traces of
bigotry still mar America"and called on the nation
to remember King's ideals and live up to them.
It was a marked contrast to the President's
defense two weeks ago of the sincerity of Sen. Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.), in his effort to open sealed FBI files
that Helms claimed would show that King had ties to
communists. "Well, we'll know in about 35 years,
won't we?" Reagan had said in a nationally-televised
news conference when he was asked if he agreed
with Helms, who tried unsuccessfully to obtain the
transcripts of wiretaps and bugs on King during the

1960s that were sealed in 1977 by court order tor 50
years.
Reagan called Loretta Scott King a tew days later to
apologize. The White House then set up a full
fledged ceremony to celebrate the signing of the
King legislation, and Reagan sought by his remarks
yesterday to try and rise above the controversy he
had created.
The president, who had originally, opposed the
creation of a 10th national holiday to mark King's
birthday, declared that the civil rights leader, assas
sinated on April 4, 1968, at the age of 39, had ". . .
awakened something strong and true, a sense that
true justice must be colorblind, and that among
white and black Americans, as he put it, 'Their des
tiny is tied up with our destiny, and their freedom is
inextricably bound to our freedom, we cannot walk
alone.' "
House rejects Lebanon pullout bill
Washington — The House rejected, 274-153, an at
tempt to cut off money for American peacekeeping
troops in Lebanon, a move that would have ordered
the battered Marine force home in four months and
defied President Reagan's Middle East policy.
After an emotional, 90-minute debate, members
sided with a call by Democratic Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill, to support the Republican adminis
tration and defeat the measure, a proposed amend
ment to a $247.3 billion defense spending bill.
But some of the speaker's Democratic colleagues
scoffed at the appeal for bipartisanship.
"A bipartisan policy, if it is wrong, should be
rejected; it should not be acquiesced in," said Rep.
William Ratchford (D-Conn.).
Rep. Samuel Stratton (D-N.Y.), one of the House's
most fervent hawks, added his voice to those calling
for a pullout, saying: "The American people want
the Marines out of that Lebanese trap."
Voting against the amendment were 126
Democrats and 148 Republicans. Voting for it were
136 Democrats and only 17 Republicans.
The vote marked the most direct congressional
challenge of Reagan's decision to keep the Marines
in Lebanon even after a terrorist bombing of their
headquarters in Beirut killed 238 servicemen.
Still pending was an amendment that would force
a pullout of American invasion forces from the
Caribbean island of Grenada 15 days after the bill
was enacted. The House had set a 60-day limit under
the War Powers Act by a 403-23 vote on Tuesday.
The House had voted 253-156 in September to let
the Marines stay at their posts in Beirut for up to 18
more months. The 1600 troops were deployed to the
war-torn city in September 1982 as part of a four
nation peacekeeping force.

Senate questions nominees
Washington — Three of President Reagan's
nominees to the Legal Service Corporation's board
of directors came under heavy fire yesterday from
members of Senate committee who questioned
their commitment to providing legal assistance to
the poor.
Sens. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and Thomas
Eagleton (D-Mo.) led the intense questioning, which
at times was shouted across the room at nominees
Michael Wallace, Robert Kane and Robert Valois.
At one point, Eagleton said in disgust: "Not one of
today's nominees is representative of the corpora
tion's clients."
The agency, which provides legal services to the
poor, has been a center of controversy for more
than two years. Reagan repeatedly has tried to
abolish it and it has been rocked by charges that its
funds have been used as political contributions.
After much debate about the corporation's value,
Reagan said earlier this year that he would nominate
11 new board members. One nominee withdrew un
der criticism, and four of the names have not been
sent to Congress.
Yesterday, Wallace, a former aide to House
Minority Whip Trent Lott (R-Miss.), was repeatedly
challenged before the Senate Committee on Labor
and Human Resources to explain his opposition to
legislation this year to extend the Voting Rights Act,
his support for tax exemptions for racially
segregated private schools and his efforts in 1981 to
keep federal inspectors out of Mississippi jails.
Stock market rises
New York — The stock market recorded its best
gain in more than three weeks yesterday with a tech
nical rally aided by some favorable economic news.
Mobile home and utility issues turned in some of
the best showings in a fairly active session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.03
to 1237.30, for its largest daily advance since it
climbed 12.50 points on Oct. 10.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange reached
95.21 million shares, up from 84.46 million Tuesday.
Today's weather
Mostly fair in the morning with increasing clouds
in the afternoon. Highs in the 60s to low 70s. Sout

U.S. troops to begin withdrawal
Point Salines, Grenada —U.S. officials yesterday
announced plans to withdraw about 2300 troops
from Grenada by tomorrow, a move they said would
reduce the U.S. military presence on the island to
about 3000.
The announcement came as 57 sick and wounded
Cubans and 10 Cuban doctors flew out of Grenada
en route home and diplomats in the Cuban embassy
in St. George's defied an order from Gov. Gen. Paul
Scoon to leave.
In Washington, the Pentagon said Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger had informed President
Reagan that all hostilities have ceased in Grenada

and U.S. forces would "begin a pullout within a few
days."
It was also announced that Vice Adm. Joseph Met
calf, who commanded the Grenada invasion last
week, has transferred responsibilities to Maj. Gen.
Edward Trobaugh, commander of the 82nd Airborne
Division, and to Brig. Rudyard Lewis, a Jamaican offi
cer commanding what U.S. officials called the
"Caribbean peace force" of several hundred troops
from neighboring islands. The Pentagon said the
two officers will coordinate their efforts through the
office of the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to
Grenada.
As the withdrawals were announced in Washing
ton, however, Navy officals said the aircraft carrier
USS America, in a nine-ship battle group, has left
Norfolk to conduct exercises in the western Atlantic
and eastern Caribbean. The officers insisted that the
new deployment was a routine exercise uncon
nected to events in Grenada.
U.S. military spokesman Maj. Douglas Frey said
here that about one-third of the troops remaining
would be stationed around St. George's. The others
will sweep the north to flush out any remaining
resistance to the 8-day-old invasion.
The impending withdrawal was clearly visible yes
terday as truckloads of sometimes whooping
paratroops in camouflage fatigues rolled toward the
Point Salines airport with trailers of weapons and
baggage in tow.
Paratroops dismantled an artillery base on a golf
course near the airport. One field gun was later seen
being loaded onto a C-141 jet transport at the air
port.
Shiites toughen stand
Geneva, Switzerland — Lebanese Shiite leader
Nabeh Berri yesterday called for the withdrawal of
all U.S. Marines from the Southern suburbs of Beirut
and said if they did not comply he would demand
that they leave the country altogether.
The toughened Shiite stand toward the U.S. pres
ence there came as Lebanon's national reconcilia
tion conference reached its first agreement — over
the Arab identity of Lebanon — and formally began
what is expected to be a long and possibly explosive
debate over the fate of the May 17 Lebanese-Israeli
agreement that Syria insists must be cancelled.
There were initial signs here yesterday, however,
that a way was being found to skirt the contentious
issue of that accord largely by freezing it for now
without formally cancelling it. This was understood
to be an acceptable alternative — to the United
States and possibly to Syria if not to Israel — to
prevent an impasse here over the accord.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Berri
said he had relayed his demands on the Marines to
U.S. Middle East envoy Richard Fairbanks, whom he
saw here three days ago and again Tuesday night.
"I ask the Marines to remove from that area," he
said referring to the southern suburbs, populated
mainly by Shiite Moslems.
If the Marines refuse to go, he said, he will ask for
their full withdrawal from Lebanon.
Indicating he was extremely worried about a

major confrontation between the Marines and the
Shiite militia in the southern suburbs, Berri said he
wanted them moved to another place in west Beirut
and replaced by the Italian or British forces in the
multinational peacekeeping force.
He said he was convinced the explosion that killed
more than 230 Marines at the Beirut airport last
month changed the nature of their mission in
Lebanon and that the Marines are now seeking a
confrontation with the Shiite Amal militia, which he
said had been falsely blamed for the bomb attack.
He said he had demanded an apology for accusa
tions by U.S. officials against Amal but that none had
come. This has left the impression in the American
public's mind that Amal was responsible, Berri said,
and he called the U.S. attitude "something like
racist."
Berri's demand that the Marines leave his area put
the United States in a difficult position, for it they
now stay, as is likely, the danger of a bloody con
frontation seems more likely that ever.
His comments came at the end of the third day of
the national reconciliation conference that he and
eight other Lebanese Moslem, Druze and Christian
leaders are holding in hopes of finding a way to end
more than eight years of political turmoil in that war
devastated land.
Reagan signs King bill
Washington — With the stroke of a pen on a cool
autumn morning, President Reagan ended the long
battle tor a national holiday honoring the Rev. Mar
tin Luther King Jr., saluting the slain civil rights
leader as a man who "stirred our nation to the very
depths of its soul."
The strains ot the civil rights anthem "We Shall
Overcome" welled up in the White House Rose Gar
den after the audience of black leaders, members of
Congress and veterans of the civil rights movement
watched Reagan sign legislation creating the nation
al holiday and hand the pen to King's widow.
Reagan did not join in the singing, but he was
praised by Loretta Scott King and others afterward
for remarks in which he warned that "traces of
bigotry still mar America"and called on the nation
to remember King's ideals and live up to them.
It was a marked contrast to the President's
defense two weeks ago of the sincerity of Sen. Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.), in his effort to open sealed FBI files
that Helms claimed would show that King had ties to
communists. "Well, we'll know in about 35 years,
won't we?" Reagan had said in a nationally-televised
news conference when he was asked if he agreed
with Helms, who tried unsuccessfully to obtain the
transcripts of wiretaps and bugs on King during the

1960s that were sealed in 1977 by court order tor 50
years.
Reagan called Loretta Scott King a tew days later to
apologize. The White House then set up a full
fledged ceremony to celebrate the signing of the
King legislation, and Reagan sought by his remarks
yesterday to try and rise above the controversy he
had created.
The president, who had originally, opposed the
creation of a 10th national holiday to mark King's
birthday, declared that the civil rights leader, assas
sinated on April 4, 1968, at the age of 39, had ". . .
awakened something strong and true, a sense that
true justice must be colorblind, and that among
white and black Americans, as he put it, 'Their des
tiny is tied up with our destiny, and their freedom is
inextricably bound to our freedom, we cannot walk
alone.' "
House rejects Lebanon pullout bill
Washington — The House rejected, 274-153, an at
tempt to cut off money for American peacekeeping
troops in Lebanon, a move that would have ordered
the battered Marine force home in four months and
defied President Reagan's Middle East policy.
After an emotional, 90-minute debate, members
sided with a call by Democratic Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill, to support the Republican adminis
tration and defeat the measure, a proposed amend
ment to a $247.3 billion defense spending bill.
But some of the speaker's Democratic colleagues
scoffed at the appeal for bipartisanship.
"A bipartisan policy, if it is wrong, should be
rejected; it should not be acquiesced in," said Rep.
William Ratchford (D-Conn.).
Rep. Samuel Stratton (D-N.Y.), one of the House's
most fervent hawks, added his voice to those calling
for a pullout, saying: "The American people want
the Marines out of that Lebanese trap."
Voting against the amendment were 126
Democrats and 148 Republicans. Voting for it were
136 Democrats and only 17 Republicans.
The vote marked the most direct congressional
challenge of Reagan's decision to keep the Marines
in Lebanon even after a terrorist bombing of their
headquarters in Beirut killed 238 servicemen.
Still pending was an amendment that would force
a pullout of American invasion forces from the
Caribbean island of Grenada 15 days after the bill
was enacted. The House had set a 60-day limit under
the War Powers Act by a 403-23 vote on Tuesday.
The House had voted 253-156 in September to let
the Marines stay at their posts in Beirut for up to 18
more months. The 1600 troops were deployed to the
war-torn city in September 1982 as part of a four
nation peacekeeping force.

Senate questions nominees
Washington — Three of President Reagan's
nominees to the Legal Service Corporation's board
of directors came under heavy fire yesterday from
members of Senate committee who questioned
their commitment to providing legal assistance to
the poor.
Sens. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and Thomas
Eagleton (D-Mo.) led the intense questioning, which
at times was shouted across the room at nominees
Michael Wallace, Robert Kane and Robert Valois.
At one point, Eagleton said in disgust: "Not one of
today's nominees is representative of the corpora
tion's clients."
The agency, which provides legal services to the
poor, has been a center of controversy for more
than two years. Reagan repeatedly has tried to
abolish it and it has been rocked by charges that its
funds have been used as political contributions.
After much debate about the corporation's value,
Reagan said earlier this year that he would nominate
11 new board members. One nominee withdrew un
der criticism, and four of the names have not been
sent to Congress.
Yesterday, Wallace, a former aide to House
Minority Whip Trent Lott (R-Miss.), was repeatedly
challenged before the Senate Committee on Labor
and Human Resources to explain his opposition to
legislation this year to extend the Voting Rights Act,
his support for tax exemptions for racially
segregated private schools and his efforts in 1981 to
keep federal inspectors out of Mississippi jails.

At one point, Eagleton said in disgust: "Not one of
today's nominees is representative of the corpora
tion's clients."
The agency, which provides legal services to the
poor, has been a center of controversy for more
than two years. Reagan repeatedly has tried to
abolish it and it has been rocked by charges that its
funds have been used as political contributions.
After much debate about the corporation's value,
Reagan said earlier this year that he would nominate
11 new board members. One nominee withdrew un
der criticism, and four of the names have not been
sent to Congress.
Yesterday, Wallace, a former aide to House
Minority Whip Trent Lott (R-Miss.), was repeatedly
challenged before the Senate Committee on Labor
and Human Resources to explain his opposition to
legislation this year to extend the Voting Rights Act,
his support for tax exemptions for racially
segregated private schools and his efforts in 1981 to
keep federal inspectors out of Mississippi jails.

U.S. troops to begin withdrawal
Point Salines, Grenada —U.S. officials yesterday
announced plans to withdraw about 2300 troops
from Grenada by tomorrow, a move they said would
reduce the U.S. military presence on the island to
about 3000.
The announcement came as 57 sick and wounded
Cubans and 10 Cuban doctors flew out of Grenada
en route home and diplomats in the Cuban embassy
in St. George's defied an order from Gov. Gen. Paul
Scoon to leave.
In Washington, the Pentagon said Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger had informed President
Reagan that all hostilities have ceased in Grenada

and U.S. forces would "begin a pullout within a few
days."
It was also announced that Vice Adm. Joseph Met
calf, who commanded the Grenada invasion last
week, has transferred responsibilities to Maj. Gen.
Edward Trobaugh, commander of the 82nd Airborne
Division, and to Brig. Rudyard Lewis, a Jamaican offi
cer commanding what U.S. officials called the
"Caribbean peace force" of several hundred troops
from neighboring islands. The Pentagon said the
two officers will coordinate their efforts through the
office of the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to
Grenada.
As the withdrawals were announced in Washing
ton, however, Navy officals said the aircraft carrier
USS America, in a nine-ship battle group, has left
Norfolk to conduct exercises in the western Atlantic
and eastern Caribbean. The officers insisted that the
new deployment was a routine exercise uncon
nected to events in Grenada.
U.S. military spokesman Maj. Douglas Frey said
here that about one-third of the troops remaining
would be stationed around St. George's. The others
will sweep the north to flush out any remaining
resistance to the 8-day-old invasion.
The impending withdrawal was clearly visible yes
terday as truckloads of sometimes whooping
paratroops in camouflage fatigues rolled toward the
Point Salines airport with trailers of weapons and
baggage in tow.
Paratroops dismantled an artillery base on a golf
course near the airport. One field gun was later seen
being loaded onto a C-141 jet transport at the air
port.
Shiites toughen stand
Geneva, Switzerland — Lebanese Shiite leader
Nabeh Berri yesterday called for the withdrawal of
all U.S. Marines from the Southern suburbs of Beirut
and said if they did not comply he would demand
that they leave the country altogether.
The toughened Shiite stand toward the U.S. pres
ence there came as Lebanon's national reconcilia
tion conference reached its first agreement — over
the Arab identity of Lebanon — and formally began
what is expected to be a long and possibly explosive
debate over the fate of the May 17 Lebanese-Israeli
agreement that Syria insists must be cancelled.
There were initial signs here yesterday, however,
that a way was being found to skirt the contentious
issue of that accord largely by freezing it for now
without formally cancelling it. This was understood
to be an acceptable alternative — to the United
States and possibly to Syria if not to Israel — to
prevent an impasse here over the accord.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Berri
said he had relayed his demands on the Marines to
U.S. Middle East envoy Richard Fairbanks, whom he
saw here three days ago and again Tuesday night.
"I ask the Marines to remove from that area," he
said referring to the southern suburbs, populated
mainly by Shiite Moslems.
If the Marines refuse to go, he said, he will ask for
their full withdrawal from Lebanon.
Indicating he was extremely worried about a

major confrontation between the Marines and the
Shiite militia in the southern suburbs, Berri said he
wanted them moved to another place in west Beirut
and replaced by the Italian or British forces in the
multinational peacekeeping force.
He said he was convinced the explosion that killed
more than 230 Marines at the Beirut airport last
month changed the nature of their mission in
Lebanon and that the Marines are now seeking a
confrontation with the Shiite Amal militia, which he
said had been falsely blamed for the bomb attack.
He said he had demanded an apology for accusa
tions by U.S. officials against Amal but that none had
come. This has left the impression in the American
public's mind that Amal was responsible, Berri said,
and he called the U.S. attitude "something like
racist."
Berri's demand that the Marines leave his area put
the United States in a difficult position, for it they
now stay, as is likely, the danger of a bloody con
frontation seems more likely that ever.
His comments came at the end of the third day of
the national reconciliation conference that he and
eight other Lebanese Moslem, Druze and Christian
leaders are holding in hopes of finding a way to end
more than eight years of political turmoil in that war
devastated land.
Reagan signs King bill
Washington — With the stroke of a pen on a cool
autumn morning, President Reagan ended the long
battle tor a national holiday honoring the Rev. Mar
tin Luther King Jr., saluting the slain civil rights
leader as a man who "stirred our nation to the very
depths of its soul."
The strains ot the civil rights anthem "We Shall
Overcome" welled up in the White House Rose Gar
den after the audience of black leaders, members of
Congress and veterans of the civil rights movement
watched Reagan sign legislation creating the nation
al holiday and hand the pen to King's widow.
Reagan did not join in the singing, but he was
praised by Loretta Scott King and others afterward
for remarks in which he warned that "traces of
bigotry still mar America"and called on the nation
to remember King's ideals and live up to them.
It was a marked contrast to the President's
defense two weeks ago of the sincerity of Sen. Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.), in his effort to open sealed FBI files
that Helms claimed would show that King had ties to
communists. "Well, we'll know in about 35 years,
won't we?" Reagan had said in a nationally-televised
news conference when he was asked if he agreed
with Helms, who tried unsuccessfully to obtain the
transcripts of wiretaps and bugs on King during the

1960s that were sealed in 1977 by court order tor 50
years.
Reagan called Loretta Scott King a tew days later to
apologize. The White House then set up a full
fledged ceremony to celebrate the signing of the
King legislation, and Reagan sought by his remarks
yesterday to try and rise above the controversy he
had created.
The president, who had originally, opposed the
creation of a 10th national holiday to mark King's
birthday, declared that the civil rights leader, assas
sinated on April 4, 1968, at the age of 39, had ". . .
awakened something strong and true, a sense that
true justice must be colorblind, and that among
white and black Americans, as he put it, 'Their des
tiny is tied up with our destiny, and their freedom is
inextricably bound to our freedom, we cannot walk
alone.' "
House rejects Lebanon pullout bill
Washington — The House rejected, 274-153, an at
tempt to cut off money for American peacekeeping
troops in Lebanon, a move that would have ordered
the battered Marine force home in four months and
defied President Reagan's Middle East policy.
After an emotional, 90-minute debate, members
sided with a call by Democratic Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill, to support the Republican adminis
tration and defeat the measure, a proposed amend
ment to a $247.3 billion defense spending bill.
But some of the speaker's Democratic colleagues
scoffed at the appeal for bipartisanship.
"A bipartisan policy, if it is wrong, should be
rejected; it should not be acquiesced in," said Rep.
William Ratchford (D-Conn.).
Rep. Samuel Stratton (D-N.Y.), one of the House's
most fervent hawks, added his voice to those calling
for a pullout, saying: "The American people want
the Marines out of that Lebanese trap."
Voting against the amendment were 126
Democrats and 148 Republicans. Voting for it were
136 Democrats and only 17 Republicans.
The vote marked the most direct congressional
challenge of Reagan's decision to keep the Marines
in Lebanon even after a terrorist bombing of their
headquarters in Beirut killed 238 servicemen.
Still pending was an amendment that would force
a pullout of American invasion forces from the
Caribbean island of Grenada 15 days after the bill
was enacted. The House had set a 60-day limit under
the War Powers Act by a 403-23 vote on Tuesday.
The House had voted 253-156 in September to let
the Marines stay at their posts in Beirut for up to 18
more months. The 1600 troops were deployed to the
war-torn city in September 1982 as part of a four
nation peacekeeping force.

Senate questions nominees
Washington — Three of President Reagan's
nominees to the Legal Service Corporation's board
of directors came under heavy fire yesterday from
members of Senate committee who questioned
their commitment to providing legal assistance to
the poor.
Sens. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and Thomas
Eagleton (D-Mo.) led the intense questioning, which
at times was shouted across the room at nominees
Michael Wallace, Robert Kane and Robert Valois.
