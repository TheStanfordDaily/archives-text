# Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity gets University recognition
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
The University granted Sigma
Alpha Mu full recognition yester
day in a decision that signals a
"major hurdle" in the drive to es
tablish the fraternity here, accor
ding to Mike Weis, president of
the campus group.
The final petition for recogni
tion was submitted to the Univer
sity last Wednesday, Weis said,
adding that he was was
"pleasantly surprised" by the
University's swift action.
The fraternity now has colony
status in the national chapter,
and will be fully recognized by
the national Sigma Alpha Mu or
ganization after the Stanford
group increases its membership
to approximately 40, according to
Weis.
He noted that the University's
stamp of approval may lead to in
creased campus visibility of
Sigma Alpha Mu — which could
assist in recruiting new members.
Weis and Ethan Orlinsky, the
campus vice president, became
the first members of the frater
nity when they signed up at last
spring's housing draw. They
gained interest in the fraternity
when they were contacted last
spring by a field secretary from
the national chapter, Weis said.
Sigma Alpha Mu members —
known also as "Sammies" —
now have the right to conduct

meetings and hold parties on
campus, and to make use of Uni
versity facilities, Weis said.
The fraternity, which now has
seven members, is "laying the
foundation" for its operations
and recruitment of new mem
bers, Weis said. He said he is
looking for "more than people
who just show interest in the
fraternity, but are willing to make
a certain type of commitment"
and who get along with present
members.
Founded in 1909 as a lewish
fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu
changed its constitution in the
1950s to open its membership to
all religions. The fraternity, which
has its headquarters in Nebraska,
has 50 to 55 chapters located

primarily in the Midwest.
Weis said the fraternity, which
does not have a house on
campus, is awaiting a report to be
made later this month on the
present moratorium on campus
housing.
Weis said he saw the founding
of the fraternity as "a challenge, a
chance to build something from
nothing." The fraternity will give
each member the opportunity to
be with people who share similar
interests, as well as the chance to
build leadership and responsibil
ity skills, he said.
Weis, who called the Sammies
a "normal fraternity," said the
group will serve as both a neces
sary social outlet and will "enrich
the atmosphere" of the campus.
