## He isn't skirting politics when he wears a dress 
### ALEXANDER PAYNE 
David Hall, 50, enters a Palo
Alto restaurant sporting a frilly
Indian bodice and a roomy
calf-length skirt. His lunch
date, Sally Ransom, and her
13-year-old son are wearing
shirts and pants. What's
wrong with this picture?
Absolutely nothing, says
Hall, a former senior research
engineer in computer science
at SRI in Menlo Park. He's
been wearing skirts regularly
in public for the past 13 years.
Hall thinks all men should
start wearing skirts as a funda
mental step toward nuclear
arms control. "I'm trying to
promote some type ot gar
ment that can be associated

with disarmament, and I think
the skirt is it,"he said. "Only
women wear skirts, and they
don't go to war, so there's an
obvious association between
the garment and pacifism."
According to Hall, women
enjoy greater freedom since
they can choose between
pants and skirts, while men
are "programmed" into
wearing only pants, a garment
which Hall contends is
synonymous with masculinity
— and militarism. Were men
able to wear skirts, they would
"get in touch with their inner,
so-called 'feminine' feelings
and be less belligerent. The
beauty about a skirt is that it
immediately makes you

gentle."
A native of South Africa,
Hall first became interested in
skirts during a 1970 trip to In
dia, where he was introduced
to the lungi, a loose-fitting
waist cloth used by men. Hall
was impressed by the comfort
of the garment. "When you
look at the human anatomy,
skirts make much more sense
for a man than for a woman,"
he said.
Upon his return from India,
he experimented with don
ning his wife's skirts and later
began designing and making
his own. He says he is now
used to all the stares and
giggles his attire elicits in
public. "I think people think

I'm homosexual," he said,
"although that is not the case.
I'm the father of four sons."
One of his sons, Steve, 26,
says he is embarrassed by his
father's practice and rarely
goes out in public with him.
I've asked him not to do it for
years now," he said, referring
to his father's "damn irritating
passion to make trouble with
his dress-wearing. I think he
uses it as a power-play over
people, to be sensational, get
attention and maybe to get
back at women for some
thing."
But 18-year-old son Patrick
is more supportive. "I still get
embarrassed sometimes with
him in restaurants or grocery
shopping," he said, "but I un
derstand why he does it."
Hall thinks disaster will
result unless men change their
"military, business-suit kind
of mentality. In the last few
days, we've had the Beirut
bombing, the invasion in
Grenada and before that the
Korean airplane incident. One
day one of these things is
going to provoke the Kremlin
or the Pentagon into pushing
the button. We've got to do
something urgent, and putting
on a skirt is a simple thing to
do. It's not even expensive."
Hall once suggested in a
Palo Alto Times interview that
Jimmy Carter wear a skirt.
"But I'm not sure I'd like to
advise Reagan to wear a skirt,"
he said, "because somehow I
don't think he deserves that
privilege. I'd like to see a bet
ter man do it. I wish John Ken
nedy were around to wear a
skirt."
Hall has appeared on "The
Tonight Show" and"The Phil
Donahue Show" to discuss
his skirt-wearing. He has also
begun marketing a line of
custom-made skirts for men,
ranging in price from $14-$47,
under the name "Soft Wear,"
but he confesses he has sold
very few. "It's an idea that
hasn't caught on. There's
something resisting this
change, and I think it's ignor
ance and fear."

DRESSING THE PART: Palo Altan David Hall believes that by wearing dresses, men arc less
likely to cause the third World War. Hall, formerly a senior research engineer at SRI and
now a yoga instructor, has been wearing dresses in public tor 13 years.

This ignorance, according to
Hall, has propagated what he
sees as "sexual apartheid." He
objects to the fact that women
can wear either pants or skirts
but men are restricted to
pants. "The Bank of America
and Safeway say, 'We're equal

opportunity employers,' but
that's really just lip service. If a
guy went to work in a bank in
a skirt, how long would he
last?"
Hall speculates there are
thousands of ordinary men
who are ready to start wearing
skirts but are deterred by
societal pressure. "One of

these days it's going to erupt.
All it would take is for some
body like Paul Newman or one
of our macho heroes to come
out in a skirt and say, 'This is
OK, you guys.' "
Hall, who worked at SRI for
13 years, currently teaches
yoga in Half Moon Bay and at
his Palo Alto home.

Hall, who worked at SRI for
13 years, currently teaches
yoga in Half Moon Bay and at
his Palo Alto home.
David Hall, 50, enters a Palo
Alto restaurant sporting a frilly
Indian bodice and a roomy
calf-length skirt. His lunch
date, Sally Ransom, and her
13-year-old son are wearing
shirts and pants. What's
wrong with this picture?
Absolutely nothing, says
Hall, a former senior research
engineer in computer science
at SRI in Menlo Park. He's
been wearing skirts regularly
in public for the past 13 years.
Hall thinks all men should
start wearing skirts as a funda
mental step toward nuclear
arms control. "I'm trying to
promote some type ot gar
ment that can be associated

with disarmament, and I think
the skirt is it,"he said. "Only
women wear skirts, and they
don't go to war, so there's an
obvious association between
the garment and pacifism."
According to Hall, women
enjoy greater freedom since
they can choose between
pants and skirts, while men
are "programmed" into
wearing only pants, a garment
which Hall contends is
synonymous with masculinity
— and militarism. Were men
able to wear skirts, they would
"get in touch with their inner,
so-called 'feminine' feelings
and be less belligerent. The
beauty about a skirt is that it
immediately makes you

gentle."
A native of South Africa,
Hall first became interested in
skirts during a 1970 trip to In
dia, where he was introduced
to the lungi, a loose-fitting
waist cloth used by men. Hall
was impressed by the comfort
of the garment. "When you
look at the human anatomy,
skirts make much more sense
for a man than for a woman,"
he said.
Upon his return from India,
he experimented with don
ning his wife's skirts and later
began designing and making
his own. He says he is now
used to all the stares and
giggles his attire elicits in
public. "I think people think

I'm homosexual," he said,
"although that is not the case.
I'm the father of four sons."
One of his sons, Steve, 26,
says he is embarrassed by his
father's practice and rarely
goes out in public with him.
I've asked him not to do it for
years now," he said, referring
to his father's "damn irritating
passion to make trouble with
his dress-wearing. I think he
uses it as a power-play over
people, to be sensational, get
attention and maybe to get
back at women for some
thing."
But 18-year-old son Patrick
is more supportive. "I still get
embarrassed sometimes with
him in restaurants or grocery
shopping," he said, "but I un
derstand why he does it."
Hall thinks disaster will
result unless men change their
"military, business-suit kind
of mentality. In the last few
days, we've had the Beirut
bombing, the invasion in
Grenada and before that the
Korean airplane incident. One
day one of these things is
going to provoke the Kremlin
or the Pentagon into pushing
the button. We've got to do
something urgent, and putting
on a skirt is a simple thing to
do. It's not even expensive."
Hall once suggested in a
Palo Alto Times interview that
Jimmy Carter wear a skirt.
"But I'm not sure I'd like to
advise Reagan to wear a skirt,"
he said, "because somehow I
don't think he deserves that
privilege. I'd like to see a bet
ter man do it. I wish John Ken
nedy were around to wear a
skirt."
Hall has appeared on "The
Tonight Show" and"The Phil
Donahue Show" to discuss
his skirt-wearing. He has also
begun marketing a line of
custom-made skirts for men,
ranging in price from $14-$47,
under the name "Soft Wear,"
but he confesses he has sold
very few. "It's an idea that
hasn't caught on. There's
something resisting this
change, and I think it's ignor
ance and fear."

DRESSING THE PART: Palo Altan David Hall believes that by wearing dresses, men arc less
likely to cause the third World War. Hall, formerly a senior research engineer at SRI and
now a yoga instructor, has been wearing dresses in public tor 13 years.

This ignorance, according to
Hall, has propagated what he
sees as "sexual apartheid." He
objects to the fact that women
can wear either pants or skirts
but men are restricted to
pants. "The Bank of America
and Safeway say, 'We're equal

opportunity employers,' but
that's really just lip service. If a
guy went to work in a bank in
a skirt, how long would he
last?"
Hall speculates there are
thousands of ordinary men
who are ready to start wearing
skirts but are deterred by
societal pressure. "One of

these days it's going to erupt.
All it would take is for some
body like Paul Newman or one
of our macho heroes to come
out in a skirt and say, 'This is
OK, you guys.' "
