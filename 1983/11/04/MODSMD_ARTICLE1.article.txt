Stanford undergraduates who consider themselves
Democrats would choose former Vice President Walter
Mondale as the party's presidential candidate, but
Mondale would not win in a race against President
Reagan, according to a campuswide straw poll con
ducted by the American Studies House.
When asked who they would like to see as President
from a list of 12 individuals, Reagan led with 24.1 per
cent of the vote. Former Independent presidential can
didate John Anderson finished second with 11.4 per
cent of the votes, more than any of the Democratic can
didates.
While Mondale would lose in a race against Reagan,
Ohio Sen. John Glenn would draw enough votes to
beat the president, according to the poll which sur
veyed 1288 students between 0ct.19 and Nov.l.
Though Glenn would not receive enough votes in his
party to win the nomination, he would draw enough
conservative votes away from Reagan to win the elec
tion.
Mondale, when matched against Reagan, only got
3- .6 percent of the votes, while Reagan garnered 40.4
percent; 22.0 percent were undecided.
When Glenn was matched against Reagan, 37.1 per
cent chose Glenn, as opposed to only 33.5 percent for
Reagan; 29.4 percent were undecided.
Mondale won in the Democratic primary category
with 20.9 percent of the votes. Following him were Cali
fornia Sen. Alan Cranston, Colorado Sen. Gary Hart,

and Glenn with 18.2 percent, 14.1 percent and 12.8 per
cent of the votes, respectively.
When asked to choose from a list of 12 individuals,
Reagan led with 24.1 percent, and Anderson came in
second with 11.4 percent.
Glenn, Cranston and Mondale all tied for third with
7.8 percent. Hart, Vice President George Bush, Rever
end Jesse jackson, and Sen. Majority Leader Howard
Baker came next with 7.7 percent, 6.6 percent, 4.7 per
cent, and 3.3 percent of the votes, respectively.
Completing the list were George McGovern, Ernest
Hollings, and Reuben Askew with tallies of 2.4 percent,
0.7 percent, and 0.5 percent, respectively.
Of the students polled, 34.6 percent identified them
selves as Democrat, 32.8 percent as Republican, and
32.5 percent as Independent.
The poll, conducted by seniors Tod Bergstrom,
Andrew Eills, and Howard Goldberg, is accurate to
within 1.5 percentage points, according to the pol
lsters.
Registered voters comprised 63.6 of those polled,
while the remainder classified themselves as unregis
tered.
Bergstrom said the poll, an American Studies House
project, was taken to "assess the political climate
among undergraduates with respect to the
presidency."
Students filled out ballots given to them while stand
ing in food service lines in large campus dining halls or
during freshman house meetings.
