## Priest explains Central America sanctuary movement 
### BRAD BARHAM 
Nicaragua — Philip Wheat
on is the director of the Ecu
menical Program for Inter-
American Communication and
Action (EPICA), a project of
the National Council of
Churches which provides edu
cational materials and a forum
for North Americans inter
ested in issues of justice and
peace in Central America.
Wheaton was a missionary in
the Dominican Republic for 12
years and is now an ordained
Episcopal priest. He is one of
the organizers of (he rapidly
growing sanctuary movement
in the United States.
DAILY: How did the move
ment to offer sanctuary to
refugees from El Salvador,
Guatemala and Haiti arise?
WHEATON: The movement
arose spontaneously out of
Tuscon, Arizona, where
churches had worked for two
years within the boundaries of
the U.S. immigration law to
obtain political asylum for the
refugees. Every route they
took was blocked by Immigra
tion and Naturalization
Services (INS). Bail for
refugees under detainment
was pushed out of sight. Arbi
trary deportations were run
ning rampant. INS was making
political asylum almost
impossible for the refugees.
Churches were going broke
and were deeply frustrated.
Sanctuary thus came out of a
natural process. Churches in
Tuscon came together and
decided to step outside the
corrupt system and turn their
churches into sanctuaries. The

sanctuary movement is a grass
roots, religious movement
that has spread spontaneously
throughout the United States.
DAILY: How many churches
are involved now?
WHEATON: In the year
since the movement began, 65
churches have become public
witnesses, while 650 have
agreed to sponsor. The former
have announced publically
that Salvadoran, Guatemalan
and Haitian refugees seeking
sanctuary will be protected.
The latter have signed on to
help the public witness
churches and are in the
process of deciding whether
to go public, a democratic
process that takes three to six
months.
DAILY: Have there been any
conflicts with INS or the State
Department?
WHEATON: No. They have
decided to ignore the move
ment for the time being, figur
ing that it would involve only a
small number of refugees.
Dragging deaths would make
great media stories and lousy
public relations for current
U.S. policy in Central
America. Future confronta
tions depend on how quickly
the movement grows and
future events in Central
America. Expansion of sanctu
ary will probably lead to con
flict.
DAILY: Recently the CIA and
Somocista forces allegedly
sabotaged oil storage facilities
in the Port of Corinto here in
Nicaragua. What was the pur
pose of that action?
WHEATON: I am convinced
that its basic function was to

destabilize the Nicaraguan
economy and to prevent the
economy from showing the
healthiness that, if left alone,
it would certainly show. They
can't have Nicaragua setting a
bad example for the rest of
Central America by having
positive economic results.

DAILY: Will they be success
ful in destabilizing the eco
nomy?
WHEATON: Perhaps, but
the strategy of the Reagan ad
ministration angers the whole
Nicaraguan society and inter
national opinion as well. We
will see more and more liberal
and progressive governments
come to the aid of Nicaragua.

Columbia, Cuba and Mexico
all came to the aid of
Nicaragua to put out the fire in
Corinto. They sent tec hnicians
and fire fighting equipment
within hours of th< ( ia attack.
I expect to see countries from
throughout the world offering
material aid to Nicaragua if

CIA sabotage continues.
DAILY: Father Wheaton, can
you suggest the principles for
an alternative policy for the
United States that is vaible?
WHEATON: Two types of
principles need to be consid
ered: emergency short term
measures to avoid the imme
diate threat of regional war
and the loss of tens of

thousands of lives. . . .
DAILY: Can you elaborate
on the immediate threat?
WHEATON: Certainly. Take
a look at the borders between
countries in Central America.
Starting from the north, the
Mexico-Guatemala border is

aflame. Thousands of
Guatemalan Indians have fled
the government massacres by
crossing the Mexico border.
Guatemalan troops have fre
quently gone across the bor
der after the refugees. The
U.S. and Guatemalan govern
ments are now pressuring
Mexico to involve themselves
in the liquidation of the Indi

ans. The same goes for El Sal
vador and Honduras. The
Nicaraguan-Honduras border
is shot to hell. CIA-Somocista
attacks against Nicaragua are
based out of Honduras. Only
great restraint and fear of a
regional war has kept the
Nicaraguans from going into

FHonduras after the
Somocistas. And, within the
last month, the Nicaraguan-
Costa Rican border has
crumbled, as the recent
destruction of the border
crossing by Pastora's forces il
lustrates. If the United States
intervenes directly with
Marines out of its hlonduran
bases, look for progressive

forces to unite and cross bor
ders. Thousands of Cenfr.il
Americans and Marines will
die, and the United States will
lose. These people are fight
ing for their lives.
DAILY: What are the emer
gency short-term measures tor
resolving the cribs'
WHEATON: Contadora is
the only thing going.
Nicaragua has received it
warmly despite the many re
strictions it imposes on inter
nal policies. In fact, Nicaragua
has agreed for
months — years now —to
discuss anthing and every
thing with the United States
and Honduras. Their
overtures to the Honduran go
vernment have been rejected
under pressure from the
Reagan administration. Any
hopes for a negotiated solu
tion rests in the hands of the
U.S. people, Congress and
Wall Street.
DAILY: Are there any hopes
for a long-term change in
policy?
WHEATON: Definitely A
group of social scientists and
experts on the regional crisis
are meeting in Washington
over the next several weeks to
propose an alternative policy
and to begin the steps neces
sary to sell it to Wall Street as
well as to a variety of social or
ganizations, including
churches, academics, grass
roots groups and the media.
They will need all the help
they can get against the
Reagan hard-line policy, and
thousands of lives may stand
in the balance.

Nicaragua has received it
warmly despite the many re

has agreed for
months — years now —to
discuss anthing and every
thing with the United States
and Honduras. Their
overtures to the Honduran go

under pressure from the
Reagan administration. Any
hopes for a negotiated solu

U.S. people, Congress and
Wall Street.
DAILY: Are there any hopes
for a long-term change in
policy?
WHEATON: Definitely A
group of social scientists and
experts on the regional crisis
are meeting in Washington
over the next several weeks to
propose an alternative policy
and to begin the steps neces
sary to sell it to Wall Street as
well as to a variety of social or
ganizations, including
churches, academics, grass
roots groups and the media.
They will need all the help
they can get against the
Reagan hard-line policy, and
thousands of lives may stand
in the balance.

Wheaton was a missionary in
the Dominican Republic for 12
years and is now an ordained
Episcopal priest. He is one of
the organizers of (he rapidly
growing sanctuary movement
in the United States.
DAILY: How did the move
ment to offer sanctuary to
refugees from El Salvador,
Guatemala and Haiti arise?
WHEATON: The movement
arose spontaneously out of
Tuscon, Arizona, where
churches had worked for two
years within the boundaries of
the U.S. immigration law to
obtain political asylum for the
refugees. Every route they
took was blocked by Immigra
tion and Naturalization
Services (INS). Bail for
refugees under detainment
was pushed out of sight. Arbi
trary deportations were run
ning rampant. INS was making
political asylum almost
impossible for the refugees.
Churches were going broke
and were deeply frustrated.
Sanctuary thus came out of a
natural process. Churches in
Tuscon came together and
decided to step outside the
corrupt system and turn their
churches into sanctuaries. The

sanctuary movement is a grass
roots, religious movement
that has spread spontaneously
throughout the United States.
DAILY: How many churches
are involved now?
WHEATON: In the year
since the movement began, 65
churches have become public
witnesses, while 650 have
agreed to sponsor. The former
have announced publically
that Salvadoran, Guatemalan
and Haitian refugees seeking
sanctuary will be protected.
The latter have signed on to
help the public witness
churches and are in the
process of deciding whether
to go public, a democratic
process that takes three to six
months.
DAILY: Have there been any
conflicts with INS or the State
Department?
WHEATON: No. They have
decided to ignore the move
ment for the time being, figur
ing that it would involve only a
small number of refugees.
Dragging deaths would make
great media stories and lousy
public relations for current
U.S. policy in Central
America. Future confronta
tions depend on how quickly
the movement grows and
future events in Central
America. Expansion of sanctu
ary will probably lead to con
flict.
DAILY: Recently the CIA and
Somocista forces allegedly
sabotaged oil storage facilities
in the Port of Corinto here in
Nicaragua. What was the pur
pose of that action?
WHEATON: I am convinced
that its basic function was to

destabilize the Nicaraguan
economy and to prevent the
economy from showing the
healthiness that, if left alone,
it would certainly show. They
can't have Nicaragua setting a
bad example for the rest of
Central America by having
positive economic results.

DAILY: Will they be success
ful in destabilizing the eco
nomy?
WHEATON: Perhaps, but
the strategy of the Reagan ad
ministration angers the whole
Nicaraguan society and inter
national opinion as well. We
will see more and more liberal
and progressive governments
come to the aid of Nicaragua.

Columbia, Cuba and Mexico
all came to the aid of
Nicaragua to put out the fire in
Corinto. They sent tec hnicians
and fire fighting equipment
within hours of th< ( ia attack.
I expect to see countries from
throughout the world offering
material aid to Nicaragua if

CIA sabotage continues.
DAILY: Father Wheaton, can
you suggest the principles for
an alternative policy for the
United States that is vaible?
WHEATON: Two types of
principles need to be consid
ered: emergency short term
measures to avoid the imme
diate threat of regional war
and the loss of tens of

thousands of lives. . . .
DAILY: Can you elaborate
on the immediate threat?
WHEATON: Certainly. Take
a look at the borders between
countries in Central America.
Starting from the north, the
Mexico-Guatemala border is

aflame. Thousands of
Guatemalan Indians have fled
the government massacres by
crossing the Mexico border.
Guatemalan troops have fre
quently gone across the bor
der after the refugees. The
U.S. and Guatemalan govern
ments are now pressuring
Mexico to involve themselves
in the liquidation of the Indi

ans. The same goes for El Sal
vador and Honduras. The
Nicaraguan-Honduras border
is shot to hell. CIA-Somocista
attacks against Nicaragua are
based out of Honduras. Only
great restraint and fear of a
regional war has kept the
Nicaraguans from going into

FHonduras after the
Somocistas. And, within the
last month, the Nicaraguan-
Costa Rican border has
crumbled, as the recent
destruction of the border
crossing by Pastora's forces il
lustrates. If the United States
intervenes directly with
Marines out of its hlonduran
bases, look for progressive

forces to unite and cross bor
ders. Thousands of Cenfr.il
Americans and Marines will
die, and the United States will
lose. These people are fight
ing for their lives.
