c■ mputer revolution is happening a little
aster than expected.
When we were in junior high school, and
alt ulators were just coming on the mar
t veryone said that someday computers
would revolutionize our lives. "Someday"
< emed to mean the 21st century.
But then in high school, computer program
ming courses gave rise to a whole new sub
culture The banks introduced computer teller
sen. ice to handle that first checking account,
airlines used computer booking to
• hedule the first trip to college. Now
Kimmates are living at LOTS. It seems as if
everyone is talking about "computer literacy.
And the University is beginning to study the
possibility of putting computers in the dorms,
is all happened so quickly we've barely had
time to think about it.
> few pilot projects started this year. At the
. nnmg of fall quarter, a computer center
opened in Larkin House of Stern Hall. Larkin
• nts now have the option of taking a corn
er literacv course in their dorm. In Potter
House of Sterling Quad, the installation of a
nputer in each room of the house is an
ip. ted in the next few months. A computer
i>ultant lives in the house and will help stu

dents learn to use the machines once they
arrive.
The prospect of a campus computer network
which links each student's room with LOTS
and eventually with other students and profes
sors is breathtaking. Studies at the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology have shown that
the effective use of computers can fundamen
tally alter the way people think. It seems that
computers, rather than isolating the user,
foster a collaborative learning process. Accor
ding to these studies, people work together
when working on computer projects. Their
minds are also freed from the drudgery of
things like arithmetic and editing on paper, al
lowing more concentration on the substance
rather than the process of a task.
It seems perfectly appropriate that an educa
tional institution should explore the residential
uses of computers. Experts anticipate that com
puters will revolutionize education. What bet
ter place to test this theory than in a student
dorm? But at present, the University is just
beginning to study the integration of residen
tial life and computers. The dorm computer ex
plosion remains at least a few years away. It will
not descend upon us until the University has
worked out the formidable logistical and
philosophical problems posed by the prospect
of a residential computer network.
