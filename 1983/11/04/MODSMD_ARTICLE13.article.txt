# De Lorean decision
## 
### 
The John DeLorean cocaine case took an in
teresting turn last week.
V\ hat began as a somewhat routine case of
; i o nai re-businessman-turned-suspected
dri ,:-dealer has transformed into an issue of
institutional rights.
; ie First Amendment to the U.S. Constitu
o i guarantees freedom of the press. The
:h Amendment guarantees a defendant's
ight to a fair trial. These rights were pitted
gainst each other when CBS News sought
urt permission to air an FBI videotape of
)eLorean's arrest.
!•.<■ videotape in question was somehow ob
ned by Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler mag
and Republican candidate for President,
nd presumably sold to CBS. The tape, which is
'h<>ught to be government evidence against
Korean, was broadcast on national televi
sion.
hus millions of Americans saw DeLorean
unging on a couch, popping open a bottle of
impagne and toasting to a suitcase allegedly
'; v ith four and a half million dollars worth
v.i a powdery white substance.
Good as gold," DeLorean said. But "gold
■ghs more than this this, for God's sake."
And then an FBI agent showed up:
Hi John. We're the FBI. We're here to arrest
j on narcotics law violation. Would you
tand up please?"

The issue of the ethics of this FBI "sting" not
withstanding, the romance and espionage-like
intrigue of the arrest is probably embedded in
the minds of all who saw the broadcast. And
the legal question is, just how many people did
see the tape?
DeLorean's attorneys contend that this na
tional broadcast has. made it virtually
impossible to assemble an impartial jury for
their client's cocaine conspiracy trial. And they
suggested that the broadcast might lead to a
motion to dismiss all charges against the defen
dant because his Sixth Amendment rights had
been infringed. Meanwhile, the DeLorean trial
enters its fourth day in Los Angeles, but the
constitutional rights issue has taken a back seat
to the escapades of Flynt, who has refused to
turn over a second tape, threatened to shoot
anyone who tries to arrest him for contempt of
court and cursed at the district judge.
Still, the balancing of such constitutional
rights is always tricky. But if the court was able
to find impartial juries in the Kennedy or King
assassination cases — which clearly received
more publicity than DeLorean — then the hip
pest automaker can be given fair trial too. CBS'
claim to run the tapes was well-founded. The
right of the press to "go with it" is not abso
lute, but divesting them of this right should be
given careful consideration. Thankfully, it was.
