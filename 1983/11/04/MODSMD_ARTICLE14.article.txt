Reagan parking lots
Recognizing President Reagan's
obsession for occupying space in
Lebanon, Grenada and Central
America, Stanford should create
more parking space areas as a sym
bolic tribute to Reagan instead of a
library or museum.
With a picture of Reagan
at each new parking site,
Stanford can designate a "G" lot
for Grenada by the Hospital, a "N"
lot for Nicaragua and a "L" lot for
Lebanon and El Salvador.

Chalk one down
Must we be subjected to yet
another one of Philip Chalk's ex
cruciatingly dull diatribes informing
us of what is good for our country?
His claim to fame as an "old school
conservative" does not justify a
shallow and longwinded "analysis"
of the Grenada situation, nor do his
turn-of-the-century foreign policy
concepts sound like anything more
than the "William F. Buckley
Primer."
His defense of the Grenada inva
sion is based on random newspaper
quotes from students on the island
who seemed glad to be back in the
United States; not surprising con
sidering they were under 24-hour
curfew prior to the "liberation." He
seems to find victory in the fact that
the Organization of American

States passed a condemnation by a
margin of only one vote, yet he fails
to mention the results of the U.N.
Security Council vote, which con
demned Reagan's move by a
resounding 11-1 margin.
Not since the Vietnam War has
the United States conducted such
widespread and blatant acts pur
porting to "make the world safe for
democracy" that were so soundly
and emphatically disapproved by
the global community. But, with
diehard supporters like Chalk, it's
likely that we'll go on "defending
our principles," as we have in El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Chile, the
Dominican Republic, et al. God
bless America.

Recycling rebuttal
it tter is in response to the

osts of all of the community's
vva te removal.
The importance of this point is
it Ih> Daily articles have consis
tently used phrases like "money
losing to describe ASSU Recycling
i saving grace" to describe the
actions of the University. Neither
phrase is inaccurate — ASSU Recy-
Ii 11; did lose money and the grant
is needed tor continued operation.
! lowever, the articles have used
h< »> catchwords to gloss over
ignificant issues in the agreement
between the University and ASSU
Recycling.
In paying tor an alternative waste
disposal system, the University is
upporting the global concept of

hon Stanford University is among
very tew, if any, major institutions
that have come to terms with the
global problem of unreclaimed
wastes.
\t the same time, it is important
i,. realize that ASSU Recycling is not
some shoddy, idealistic student
organization that needs a bail-out
( hrysler Corporation-style) from
I I Diversity. The recycling
« enter houses a nearly profit
making business that turns your
garbage into money and student
jobs.
I ast year, ASSU Recycling re

and income.
Simply wanting more materials,
however, will not lead to that goal.
Public awareness and participation
is the key to successful operation of
ASSU Recycling. Individuals must
decide not to throw away alumi
num, glass and paper, and make
the small effort to recycle them
instead. The administration had
acknowledged that ASSU Recycling
is an important part of the Univer
sity. Now it is time for the members
of the community to do the same
through participation.

Reagan parking lots
Recognizing President Reagan's
obsession for occupying space in
Lebanon, Grenada and Central
America, Stanford should create
more parking space areas as a sym
bolic tribute to Reagan instead of a
library or museum.
With a picture of Reagan
at each new parking site,
Stanford can designate a "G" lot
for Grenada by the Hospital, a "N"
lot for Nicaragua and a "L" lot for
Lebanon and El Salvador.

Chalk one down
Must we be subjected to yet
another one of Philip Chalk's ex
cruciatingly dull diatribes informing
us of what is good for our country?
His claim to fame as an "old school
conservative" does not justify a
shallow and longwinded "analysis"
of the Grenada situation, nor do his
turn-of-the-century foreign policy
concepts sound like anything more
than the "William F. Buckley
Primer."
His defense of the Grenada inva
sion is based on random newspaper
quotes from students on the island
who seemed glad to be back in the
United States; not surprising con
sidering they were under 24-hour
curfew prior to the "liberation." He
seems to find victory in the fact that
the Organization of American

States passed a condemnation by a
margin of only one vote, yet he fails
to mention the results of the U.N.
Security Council vote, which con
demned Reagan's move by a
resounding 11-1 margin.

widespread and blatant acts pur
