# United States invades House
## 
### 
Washington—President Reagan announced last
night to a closed Senate session that the United States
had just launched an invasion of the House of Repre
sentatives. The astonished Republican-controlled Sen
ate gave its cautious approval of the move, agreeing
with the president that it was necessary, both for Amer
ican interests in the region and for the sake of
democracy.
The move came after several months of turmoil in the
House, including severe disorganization among the
House leadership. According to unconfirmed reports
from the capitol, House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.), leader of the ruling Democratic party, and
who has been without enunciated policy for several
years, was finding himself increasingly under attack
from a radical wing of the Democratic Party known as
the "Liberals," who have seemed at various times in
the past few months to be in a position to gain influ
ence in the House.
Among other things, these liberals support a nuclear
freeze, and oppose increased U.S. defense spending
and Reagan's economic policies, positions described
by the president as "dangerous to the national security
of the United States."
It was the threat of a liberal coup in the House leader
ship which prompted the president to send in the
Marines, a high government official confirmed yester
day. He also said the president was troubled by the fact
that he has been unable either to quiet liberal criticism
or to make them disappear entirely, and that it was this
frustration, combined with a lack of creative policy
making, which led Reagan to choose a military solution
to the problem.
The pretext for the invasion, however, centered
around a tour group from Orange County, California,
which was visiting Washington, D.C. during the crisis.
This group, as a part of its four-day tour, was visiting
the House of Representatives chamber when it was
exposed to such bombastic liberal rhetoric that it was
feared they would be captured and held hostage by the
Democratic party until after the 1984 presidential elec
tion. The participants of this tour were the first Ameri
can military objective liberated in yesterday's action,
and were safely returned to Orange County by
nightfall, where they all pledged to vote republican in
1984.
"It was terrifying," said Mortimer Fats, an Anaheim
dentist, of his experience yesterday. "Especially when
they started debating a national health insurance
plan — it was almost too much to bear. I'm glad the
president did something about it."
There were not yet any confirmed reports of
casualties from yesterday's fighting, although an un
confirmed source reported that two Marines were
killed and a third wounded when a liberal in the
visitor's gallery dropped a budget proposal on them.
The proposal was rumored to include real cuts in
defense spending, including the total abandonment of
further development on the B-1 bomber.
Another unconfirmed source claimed that the
Marines have uncovered significant evidence pointing
towards major environmentalist influence in the
House. The evidence cited consists of an environmen
talist cache including 12 attache cases belonging to pro
environment lobbyists, as well as more than 3000
bumper stickers bearing the cryptic "Save the

Whales." These bumper stickers, it is believed, may
point to Greenpeace backing of the liberals on a
heretofore unimagined scale. This confirms govern
ment suspicions of "the evil empire," as the president
has termed Greenpeace, as being behind the recent
political death of former Secretary of the Interior James
Watt.
These and other reports could not be confirmed,
however, as the Marines have refused to grant
reporters access to the scene of the fighting. Such a
ban on war correspondents, unprecedented in the
country's history, was justified by Deputy Press Secre
tary Larry Speakes as being in the interests of safety ot
the reporters covering the invasion. Later in the press
conference, however, Speakes characterized the
Washington press corps as a group of "brutal liberal
thugs," saying that he wished they'd all just drop dead,
thus making the administration's professed concerns
over the safety of these reporters somewhat less
credible.
There were as of last night no official statements con
cerning Reagan's plans for the House of Representa
tives once liberated. Several top aides have indicated,
however, that the United States is trying to form a new
House leadership under House Minority Leader Robert
Michel (R-lll.) who is said to support the president's
foreign and defense policies. Michel was rumored to
be concerned, however, about how the invasion will
play in Peoria, which, not coincidentally, is in his home
district.
Foreign governments, including American allies
as England and-France, generally condemned the presi
dent's move. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
said that the United States had no business in the West
ern Hemisphere, which she described as being in the
British sphere of influence. She was joined in her con
demnation by French President Francois Mitterrand,
who is known to sympathize with many of the liberal's
positions. An editorial in the Russian newspaper
Pravda, also criticized Reagan's invasion, calling in "an
example of Reagan's gangsteristic imperial space cow
boy mentality, which is a tool of the exploitive capitalist
class whose hooliganism all proletarian supporters of
the House of Representatives can only condemn."
Senate reaction to the president's news however, has
so far been tentatively favorable. Senate Majority
Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) lent his support for the
invasion, but expressed concern over the safety of
those House Republicans trapped in the fighting. He
was joined in his support by the rest of the Senate Re
publican leadership, who issued a brief statement
saying, "Our president, right or wrong — so long as
he's Republican." Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), on
the other hand, condemned the invasion as a "clear
case of, uh, well, something or other on the part of the
president."
The president, who rushed back from a weekend
horseback ride through the Sierras to read a letter from
a four-year-old St. Louis girl supporting his interest
rates policies at a press conference yesterday, would
not comment on the situation in the House, telling
reporters it was none of their business.
