## Mendocino: California's version of New England 
### MARY WILLIAMSON 
Ever wanted to feel a million
miles from schools A five-hour
drive will put you in the town
of Mendocino, where you'll
be hard put to imagine Stan
ford even exists.
This village of 1100 is built
on headlands on the northern
California coast, but its weath
er-beaten wood buildings and
fresh sea air are reminiscent of
New England.
Founded as a port for the
lumber industry, Mendocino

is now a thriving artists'
colony. A local guide to the
town lists 13 art galleries,
some of which double as
studios where you can talk
with artists as they work. One
ramshackle hut I found is
probably not listed in any
guide, but housed a particu
larly chatty and somewhat
drunken painter. It's easy and
worthwhile to strike up con
versations with many of the
town's residents.
Along with the galleries,

there are good shops for
crafts, books, clothing and
other items. At "Alphonso's,"
a long-time Mendocino native
has collected classical and jazz
records, local crafts, do-it
yourself jewelry makings and
more in a hodge-podge shop
with lots of local flavor.
Several small antique shops
are also fun for browsing.
Mendocino is a completely
walkable village. Exploring the
side streets and strolling along
the wooden sidewalk of the
main oceanfront street is the
best way to get to know it. The
architecture in the village calls
for wandering through the
residential blocks as well, to
see the classic New England
salt box houses and the ornate
Victorian homes, along with
some beautiful gardens. On
Saturdays a walking tour gives
more complete historical in
formation on the town and its
buildings.
The cliffs and meadows of
the headlands surrounding
the village are a state park,
with wonderful nooks and
crannies for picnicking and
perhaps trying your hand with
watercolors. Waves have cut
spectacular tunnels through

(he rocks; and there are lively
tide pools to investigate at low
tide. I discovered too late that
poison oak is a problem; so
explore the headland but be
careful.
If you do decide to picnic,
the Main Street Deli and
Bakery offers lots of take-out
goodies. Or there's Lu's Bay
Kitchen, with delicious and
portable Mexican food, and
the Mendocino Ice Cream
Company boasts gold-medal
winning cones. The village
also has a variety of res
taurants, featuring charming
interiors and some very good
food. The Chocolate Moose is
a reasonably priced cafe with a
simple menu of soups, pate,
fresh bread and extravagant
desserts. Brannon's Whale
Watch restaurant specializes
in seafood and has a beautiful
second story view of Men
docino Bay. My dinner in the
Sea Gull was fairly good, and
this restaurant features a bar
and dance floor upstairs.
Information on restaurants,
shops, and other village attrac
tions is available from a free
brochure distributed at many
stores and restaurants. Local
nightclubs post upcoming
events on the walls along the
main street, and another free
publication covers the arts, in
cluding information on Men
docino's four permanent
theater companies.
Mendocino is too far for a
day trip from Stanford, but it is
a wonderful weekend destina
tion with a variety of lodging
choices. In the town itself,
bed and breakfasts start at
about $35 a night for a room
with a double bed. I stayed at
the Blue Heron Inn, a charm

ing old house with just two
bedrooms and a small cafe
downstairs. The largest inn in
town is the Mendocino Hotel,
established in 1878, with 26
rooms with prices starting at
$45.
Many other bed and break
fasts are located in the village,
along nearby Highway 1, and
in Fort Bragg and other coastal
towns in Mendocino County.
Inexpensive motels can be
found in Ukiah, inland about
an hour and a half. For smaller
inns, you may need reserva
tions at least a month in ad
vance.
In the spring and fall, camp
ing is also a good bet. There
are several state parks on the
coast, where reservations will
be needed well in advance for
popular weekends such as
Memorial Day. The Chamber
of Commerce lists private
campgrounds, which don't fill

up as fast, or you might look
for small unmarked beaches
off Highway 1.
There's plenty to do for a
weekend in the village of
Mendocino itself, but Men
docino County has other at
tractions. The coastline is uni
formly spectacular, and a drive
along Highway 1 is a must for
camera buffs. There are few
coastal towns, and some are
ghost towns left over from the
last century.
Fort Bragg is the largest
town on the county's coast,
and has some interesting his
tory though it is less pictur
esque than Mendocino. In
land, the deep forests still
supply the lumber industry,
and north of Fort Bragg the
coast becomes so rugged that
Highway 1 turns east to join
Highway 101. This is a gor
geous drive, and the inland
portion of the county is full of

beautiful mountain scenery
and quaint hamlets.
The quickest route from the
Bay Area to Mendocino is over
the Golden Gate and up 101.
Two roads lead from 101 to the
village of Mendocino; both
are pretty so you might take
one over and the other back.
Route 128 leaves 101 at
Cloverdale and goes
northwest to the coast, or a
smaller road leaves 101 at
Ukiah and goes through Com
ptche to Mendocino.
Travelling time is compara
ble to Tahoe, and you'll find
Mendocino a treat that makes
the drive well worthwhile. The
Mendocino region is known
as "The Forgotten Coast,"
and while its charm comes
from its remote and timeless
feeling, it shouldn't be forgot
ten as a perfect weekend
getaway.

are also fun for browsing.
Mendocino is a completely
walkable village. Exploring the
side streets and strolling along
the wooden sidewalk of the
main oceanfront street is the
best way to get to know it. The
architecture in the village calls
for wandering through the
residential blocks as well, to
see the classic New England
salt box houses and the ornate
Victorian homes, along with
some beautiful gardens. On
Saturdays a walking tour gives
more complete historical in
formation on the town and its
buildings.
The cliffs and meadows of
the headlands surrounding
the village are a state park,
with wonderful nooks and
crannies for picnicking and
perhaps trying your hand with
watercolors. Waves have cut
spectacular tunnels through

(he rocks; and there are lively
tide pools to investigate at low
tide. I discovered too late that
poison oak is a problem; so
explore the headland but be
careful.
If you do decide to picnic,
the Main Street Deli and
Bakery offers lots of take-out
goodies. Or there's Lu's Bay
Kitchen, with delicious and
portable Mexican food, and
the Mendocino Ice Cream
Company boasts gold-medal
winning cones. The village
also has a variety of res
taurants, featuring charming
interiors and some very good
food. The Chocolate Moose is
a reasonably priced cafe with a
simple menu of soups, pate,
fresh bread and extravagant
desserts. Brannon's Whale
Watch restaurant specializes
in seafood and has a beautiful
second story view of Men
docino Bay. My dinner in the
Sea Gull was fairly good, and
this restaurant features a bar
and dance floor upstairs.
Information on restaurants,
shops, and other village attrac
tions is available from a free
brochure distributed at many
stores and restaurants. Local
nightclubs post upcoming
events on the walls along the
main street, and another free
publication covers the arts, in
cluding information on Men
docino's four permanent
theater companies.
Mendocino is too far for a
day trip from Stanford, but it is
a wonderful weekend destina
tion with a variety of lodging
choices. In the town itself,
bed and breakfasts start at
about $35 a night for a room
with a double bed. I stayed at
the Blue Heron Inn, a charm

ing old house with just two
bedrooms and a small cafe
downstairs. The largest inn in
town is the Mendocino Hotel,
established in 1878, with 26
rooms with prices starting at
$45.
Many other bed and break
fasts are located in the village,
along nearby Highway 1, and
in Fort Bragg and other coastal
towns in Mendocino County.
Inexpensive motels can be
found in Ukiah, inland about
an hour and a half. For smaller
inns, you may need reserva
tions at least a month in ad
vance.
In the spring and fall, camp
ing is also a good bet. There
are several state parks on the
coast, where reservations will
be needed well in advance for
popular weekends such as
Memorial Day. The Chamber
of Commerce lists private
campgrounds, which don't fill

up as fast, or you might look
for small unmarked beaches
off Highway 1.
There's plenty to do for a
weekend in the village of
Mendocino itself, but Men
docino County has other at
tractions. The coastline is uni
formly spectacular, and a drive
along Highway 1 is a must for
camera buffs. There are few
coastal towns, and some are
ghost towns left over from the
last century.
Fort Bragg is the largest
town on the county's coast,
and has some interesting his
tory though it is less pictur
esque than Mendocino. In
land, the deep forests still
supply the lumber industry,
and north of Fort Bragg the
coast becomes so rugged that
Highway 1 turns east to join
Highway 101. This is a gor
geous drive, and the inland
portion of the county is full of

beautiful mountain scenery
and quaint hamlets.
The quickest route from the
Bay Area to Mendocino is over
the Golden Gate and up 101.
Two roads lead from 101 to the
village of Mendocino; both
are pretty so you might take
one over and the other back.
Route 128 leaves 101 at
Cloverdale and goes
northwest to the coast, or a
smaller road leaves 101 at
Ukiah and goes through Com
ptche to Mendocino.
Travelling time is compara
ble to Tahoe, and you'll find
Mendocino a treat that makes
the drive well worthwhile. The
Mendocino region is known
as "The Forgotten Coast,"
and while its charm comes
from its remote and timeless
feeling, it shouldn't be forgot
ten as a perfect weekend
getaway.


Ever wanted to feel a million
miles from schools A five-hour
drive will put you in the town
of Mendocino, where you'll
be hard put to imagine Stan
ford even exists.
This village of 1100 is built
on headlands on the northern
California coast, but its weath
er-beaten wood buildings and
fresh sea air are reminiscent of
New England.
Founded as a port for the
lumber industry, Mendocino

is now a thriving artists'
colony. A local guide to the
town lists 13 art galleries,
some of which double as
studios where you can talk
with artists as they work. One
ramshackle hut I found is
probably not listed in any
guide, but housed a particu
larly chatty and somewhat
drunken painter. It's easy and
worthwhile to strike up con
versations with many of the
town's residents.
Along with the galleries,

there are good shops for
crafts, books, clothing and
other items. At "Alphonso's,"
a long-time Mendocino native
has collected classical and jazz
records, local crafts, do-it
yourself jewelry makings and
more in a hodge-podge shop
with lots of local flavor.
Several small antique shops
are also fun for browsing.
