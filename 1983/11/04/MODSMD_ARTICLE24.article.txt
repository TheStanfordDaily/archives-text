## Cardinal hoopsters win psuedo-opener over Japan Jones scores 23, Revelli 17 in 91-77 victory 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
More than 4000 fans got
their first view of Stanford bas
ketball last night in the form of
a 91-77 win over the Japan Na
tional team at Maples Pavilion.
For the most part, they liked
what they saw.
Although it was an exhibi
tion game and does not count
on the Cardinal's season
record, Stanford coach Tom
Davis treated it as more than a
pre-season scrimmage.
"I thought it (the game) was
just about right," Davis said.
"There were some positive
things and enough negative
ones to keep us busy." Stan
ford plays for keeps beginning
Nov. 26 against Hawaii Pacific.
"This (playing so early in the
season) has some benefit in
that we now have two and a
half weeks until we play for
real."

Senior guard Keith jones led
the Cardinal offensive attack
with 23 points, 17 of which he
scored in the first half. An
other senior, center John
Revelli, added 17 points while
sweeping the backboards for
14 rebounds.
lapan guard Yomohide Ut
sumi shared high point honors
with )ones at 23. Guard Akira
Rikukawa, with 12 points, was
the only other Japan player in
double figures.
Stanford led all the way,
jumping to early leads of 6-0,
15-5 and finally 29-13 with
10:05 left in the first half.
Japan gave the Card a
momentary scare in the
opening period when, in a
four-minute stretch, it out
scored their American oppo
nents 12-4 and cut Stanford's
lead to 33-25.
Japan coach Voshiaki

Shimizu benched 7-foot-9, 320
pound center Yasutaka
Okayama in favor of a smaller,
quicker line-up that staged the
12-4 spurt. After Stanford
broke its four-minute dry
spell, the two teams traded
baskets until the half, at which
time the Card was ahead 46-
35.
In the second half, Japan got
no closer than nine points as
Stanford gradually extended
its lead. With 11:58 left in the
game, it was 68-51 and ten
minutes later the Americans
had their biggest advantage at
90-67.
All 13 Cardinal players suited
up for the game saw action
and nine of them scored.
"With John (Revelli) and Keith
(Jones) out of there, you can
see a real drop off," Davis
said. "So we were looking at
our other players a lot."

Probably the most pleasant
surprise of the evening for
Davis was the play of junior
forward Charles Hunt, who
started because both Steve
Brown and Andy Fischer were
out with injuries. Hunt, who
sat on the bench his first two
years at Stanford, played 22
minutes, scoring 13 points and
pulling down six rebounds.
"I thought he handled him
self very, very well tonight,'
Davis said of Hunt. "He
showed some positive signs
that his game is coming
around."
Davis also unveiled his three
freshman recruits — Novian
Whitsitt, Doug Wall and Grady
Johnson.
"Tonight I was playing some
of the new kids to get them
some experience and speed

up the learning process," he
said.
Whitsitt, a 6-1, 180 pound
guard, saw the most time,
playing nearly 20 minutes and
scoring 7 points. The lanky
Johnson did not score, but
blocked two shots, one of
which set up an electrifying
fast break. The 6-6 Wall also
went scoreless, but showed
promising ball handling skills
that may have him playing
guard before his career at
Stanford is over.
Rounding out the Card
scoring were three players
with eight points apiece — for
ward Hans Wichary and
guards Ricky Lewis and Keith
Ramee.
While Jones, who was 9-for
-14 from the field, scored most
of points off the fast break,
Revelli was clearly the domi
nant force inside. After taking
just two shots and scoring four
points in the first half, the 6-8,
220 pounder came on strong
in the second, going 5-for-5
from the floor and 3-for-3 from
the free throw line.
Revelli, wearing a protective
brace on his right knee, is
recovering from a knee injury
that sidelined him for most of
the Pacific-10 Conference

season last year and required
surgery.
"My legs felt fine and my
wind felt good out there," he
said. "I got up and down the
court really well."
Stanford's only bugaboo
last night was the turnover.
The Card had 14 in the first
half and 13 in the second for a
total of 27. Japan had just 18 in
the losing effort.
The Card had a shooting
percentage of .559 for the
game while Japan hit only .395
of its attempts. The Japanese,
however, were perfect from
the free throw stripe, making
all 13 of its tries.
While Japan made only one
less field goal in the game than
Stanford, the Card made 12
more free throws as the
Japanese had 25 personal
fouls. Stanford fouled only 14
times.
Japan's monstrous center
Okayama played only eight
minutes and did not score, al
though he pulled down two
rebounds.
Hoop notes
Davis said he plans to hold
open scimmages immediately
following each of Stanford's
two remaining home football
games. The scrimmages will
be in Maples Pavilion and are
free.
