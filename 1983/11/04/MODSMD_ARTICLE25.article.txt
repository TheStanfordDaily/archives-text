# Japan's big man with big problem
## 
### LARRY GREEN Staff writer 
Tall enough to dunk a basketball without jumping,
japan's 7-toot-9 center, Yatsuka Okayama, stands head
and-shoulders above the basketball world.
Although his game is not as solid as it could be, his pres
ence on the court is intimidating enough to opponents.
And just because his nickname is Chibi, Japanese for
"tiny," he is not. Okayama is becoming something of a
legend in basketball circles.
The Japanese giant began the exhibition game against
Stanford last night by winning the opening tip-off from
lohn Revelli. But it became apparent that his presence was
limiting to the Japanese attack. Japan had to play a much
slower, halt-court game to work him into the offense.
He was guarded by Stanford's John Revelli, who said,
"It's really strange. He's really big, but actually easy to
defense because you always know where he is. You never
lose your man when you're guarding him."
But at 325 pounds, Okayama was an open threat to a
Stanford team not used to the physical style characterizing
the Japan National team.
While he was in, Okayama shot four balls, failing to net
any, but it was later discovered that he was playing on a
sore foot. Okayama, as big as he is, is no stranger to pain.
Five years ago, Okayama came over from Japan to study
and to learn the game of basketball at the University of
Portland. Then, he was 23 and just under 7 feet tall. In less
than a year, his height soared five inches, the result of an
overactive pituitary gland. Doctors asked him to return to
Japan and give up basketball. For two years, he did not
play basketball as he followed a medication program de
signed to arrest his growth.
Apparently the treatment was successful. Okayama's
growth became gradual and he was able to return to the

basketball court. But he was measured this summer and it
was discovered that once again his height, and conse
quently his weight, was surging.
"The problem (of Okayama's growth) has to be arrested
or they don't think he'll live a normal life," said Pete
Newell, f ormer UC-Berkeley basketball coach and now a
consultant for the Japanese team.
Okayama, though, appears to be coping well with the
problem. Apparently, he is fun-loving and an enjoyable
person to associate with. Newell noted that he is "a very
bright, delightful person who probably speaks the most
fluent English of anyonp on the team."


Yasutaka Okayama
Okayama is not blessed with great speed or Jtwesome
natural basketball skill. In last night's game, he lagged be
hind on fast breaks and did not show much interest in
handling the ball. His main asset is that he is a crowd
pleaser.
The Stanford crowd greeted him with awe when he was
announced and seemingly cheered in amazement
whenever he touched the ball. Maples Pavilion seemed to
grow quiet for a moment when he attempted to make a
lay-up without jumping, and failed to score. And even
though Okayama does not consider himself the strength
of the team, he is never ignored when on the court.
Stanford beat Yasutaka Okayama and his Japan National
team last night, 91-77. Okayama only played for about
eight minutes, and his team outscored Stanford 14-4 when
he left.
