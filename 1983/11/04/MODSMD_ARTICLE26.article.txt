# Freshman Dillard to start at fullback
## Card travels south to face (not so) invincible USC 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
USC is ineligible for post
season play this year. But
Coach Ted Tollner and his
troops won't be sitting home
New Year's Day watching a
bowl game on TV that they
should be playing in, the case
with some past USC teams.
USC is going nowhere,
regardless of its NCAA proba
tion. The Trojans are 3-4-1 and
that's not a misprint.
Stanford, however, is by no
means in any better shape
heading into tomorrow's 1:30
p.m. showdown against USC
at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Stanford is 1-7 (1-4 in the
Pacific-10 Conference) and the
way things have gone for the
Cardinal this season, people
are considering its only victory
— a 31-22 upset over then No.
19 ranked Arizona — a fluke.
Cardinal Coach Paul Wiggin
and his staff are trying their
hardest to forget last Satur
day's 31-18 drubbing by an
Oregon State team that had
lost 30 straight Pac-10 games
going into the Stanford con
test.
Asked in his Tuesday mor
ning press conference if he

had looked at the Oregon
State films, Wiggin joked, "No
I didn't. We burned those
(films).
"It was just a tentative foot
ball game in many ways," he
continued. "I wish I could ex
plain it (the loss), but I can't. I
wish I could lie about it, but I
can't even do that."
Stanford, which has not
defeated USC since 1975, will
go with basically the same
starting lineup as last week.
Freshman John Paye will start
at quarterback with senior
Steve Cottrell ready to come
off the bench in relief, some
thing he did against Oregon
State.
junior wide receiver Fmile
Harry, although he suffered a
badly bruised shoulder last
week, is probable at split end,
while Shawn Avant will take
the field at halfback.
The surprise starter for Stan
ford is at fullback, where
freshman sensation Marshall
Dillard will get the nod. In his
Cardinal debut last Saturday,
Dillard rushed for 66 yards on
13 carries and caught three
passes for 50 yards.
Like Stanford's Wiggin, USC

head mentor Tollner has had
his share of troubles this
season. Besides having a quar
terback and tailback contro
versy, USC simply has not
risen up to win the big games.
After tying Florida in their
Sept. 10 opener 19-19, the
Trojans easily disposed of
Oregon State 33-10 before
running into problems and
losing games to Kansas 26-20
and South Carolina 38-14.
USC got untracked with a
38-17 whalloping of Washing
ton State, but then watched
Arizona State and Notre Dame
do the kicking to the tune of
34-14 and 27-6 defeats,
respectively.
Six weeks into the season,
USC at 2-4-1 had twice as many
losses as wins and Trojan fans
started wondering if El Nino
affected more than the wea
ther.
Remember, USC is
supposed to finish 10-1 or, at
worst, 9-2 each year. In fact,
the Trojans are 189-47-10 since
its last losing season in 1961,
when Coach John McKay was
4-5-1 in his second of 16
seasons with USC.
But last week Tollner, who is

in his debut campaign as the
Trojans' head coach, showed
Bay Area fans that USC is a
much better football team
than its record indicates by
silencing Joe Kapp and UC-
Berkeley 19-9.
"Our defense played as well
as it has all year," Tollner said.
"We were able to put some
pressure on a quarterback,
Gale Gilbert, that is leading
the conference."
The key to that 3-4 defense
are outside linebackers Keith
Browner and Jack Del Rio.
Against the Bears, Tollner put
Del Rio into a variety of spots
across the defensive line, a
strategy that paid big
dividends as the junior All-
America candidate sacked
Cal's Gilbert four times for 44
yards in losses.
"Offensively," Tollner said,
"we still find ways to lose
good opportunities at scoring.
We just haven't been able to
make the big plays on offense
and not take ourselves out of
scoring position."
The Trojans were quite
adept at the latter skill Satur
day, fumbling twice in the Cal
end zone and being penalized
16 times for 110 yards, includ
ing eight holding penalties.
Nonetheless, the victory
over Cal boosted the Trojans'
Pac-10 record to 3-1, tying
them for second place with
Washington. And with vic
tories over Stanford, Washing
ton and UCLA, their last three
opponents, USC could con
ceivably finish first in the con
ference with a 6-1 league
mark.
While junior Sean Salisbury,
102-of-184 (55.4 percent) for
1342 yards and nine touch
downs on the season, is ex
pected to play the entire game
for Tollner, the USC coach

loss of the season tomorrow at the Los Angeles Coliseum. USC, however, has not had the
best of seasons as its 3-4-1 record indicates.
may use all three of his tail
backs — Michael Harper,
Todd Spencer and Fred
Crutcher.
"We haven't been able to
dominate at that position as
we have in past years," Tollner
said. "So we've been playing a
number of people there."
Each tailback has started at
one time or another this
season and consequently they
have similar statistics.
Crutcher (111 carries, 482
yards, 4.3 yards per carry) has
the most yards and Spencer
ran for 99 yards against Stan
ford last year, but Harper (84
carries, 414 yards, 4.9 yards
per carry) will start tomorrow.
In his first start of the season
last week, Harper rushed for
100 yards on 27 attempts and
caught three passes for an ad
ditional 45 yards against a

stingy Bear defense.
Another offensive force for
the Trojans is junior place
kicker Steve Jordan, who
booted four field goals against
Cal to set a single-game USC
record, jordan also owns the
career field goal (33) and dis
tance (52 yards) marks.
USC punter Troy Richard
son ranks second in the Pac
-10, averaging 42.5 yards per
kick. Washington State's Glen
Harper is first at 42.6, while
Stanford's Trip Hardin in
fourth at 42.0.
USC ranks eighth in the
conference in total offense
and fourth in total defense, in
cluding a No. 2 rating (behind
Stanford) in pass defense. The
Card is ninth in offense and
seventh in defense.
"We're a lot like Stanford
this season," Tollner noted.
"We're got some reels of film
where we look pretty damn
good. And then you can put
some on where we stink the
place up.

"You can't win if you're
going to have that kind of
football team (like Stanford)
and we've found that out,
too."
Card notes:
Cardinal fullback Rob
Moore, a fifth-year senior, re
injured his knee last week
against Oregon State and will
be out for the remainder of
the season.
Oregon State sophomore
noseguard )ohn Gonzales was
named Pac-10 Defensive
Player of the Week for his ef
forts in the Beavers' 31-18 win
over Stanford. Gonzales had
four tackles, one quarterback
sack and, most importantly, an
interception returned 15 yards
for a touchdown that iced the
game for the Beavers.

big send-off to the Cardinal
football players today, the
team busses leave from the
front of Encina Gym on
Campus Drive at 11:50 a.m.

carries, 414 yards, 4.9 yards
per carry) will start tomorrow.
In his first start of the season
last week, Harper rushed for
100 yards on 27 attempts and
caught three passes for an ad
ditional 45 yards against a

stingy Bear defense.
Another offensive force for
the Trojans is junior place
kicker Steve Jordan, who
booted four field goals against
Cal to set a single-game USC
record, jordan also owns the
career field goal (33) and dis
tance (52 yards) marks.
USC punter Troy Richard
son ranks second in the Pac
-10, averaging 42.5 yards per
kick. Washington State's Glen
Harper is first at 42.6, while
Stanford's Trip Hardin in
fourth at 42.0.
USC ranks eighth in the
conference in total offense
and fourth in total defense, in
cluding a No. 2 rating (behind
Stanford) in pass defense. The
Card is ninth in offense and
seventh in defense.
"We're a lot like Stanford
this season," Tollner noted.
"We're got some reels of film
where we look pretty damn
good. And then you can put
some on where we stink the
place up.

"You can't win if you're
going to have that kind of
football team (like Stanford)
and we've found that out,
too."
Card notes:
Cardinal fullback Rob
Moore, a fifth-year senior, re
injured his knee last week
against Oregon State and will
be out for the remainder of
the season.
Oregon State sophomore
noseguard )ohn Gonzales was
named Pac-10 Defensive
Player of the Week for his ef
forts in the Beavers' 31-18 win
over Stanford. Gonzales had
four tackles, one quarterback
sack and, most importantly, an
interception returned 15 yards
for a touchdown that iced the
game for the Beavers.
For those wishing to give a
big send-off to the Cardinal
football players today, the
team busses leave from the
front of Encina Gym on
Campus Drive at 11:50 a.m.
USC is ineligible for post
season play this year. But
Coach Ted Tollner and his
troops won't be sitting home
New Year's Day watching a
bowl game on TV that they
should be playing in, the case
with some past USC teams.
USC is going nowhere,
regardless of its NCAA proba
tion. The Trojans are 3-4-1 and
that's not a misprint.
Stanford, however, is by no
means in any better shape
heading into tomorrow's 1:30
p.m. showdown against USC
at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Stanford is 1-7 (1-4 in the
Pacific-10 Conference) and the
way things have gone for the
Cardinal this season, people
are considering its only victory
— a 31-22 upset over then No.
19 ranked Arizona — a fluke.
Cardinal Coach Paul Wiggin
and his staff are trying their
hardest to forget last Satur
day's 31-18 drubbing by an
Oregon State team that had
lost 30 straight Pac-10 games
going into the Stanford con
test.
Asked in his Tuesday mor
ning press conference if he

had looked at the Oregon
State films, Wiggin joked, "No
I didn't. We burned those
(films).
"It was just a tentative foot
ball game in many ways," he
continued. "I wish I could ex
plain it (the loss), but I can't. I
wish I could lie about it, but I
can't even do that."
Stanford, which has not
defeated USC since 1975, will
go with basically the same
starting lineup as last week.
Freshman John Paye will start
at quarterback with senior
Steve Cottrell ready to come
off the bench in relief, some
thing he did against Oregon
State.
junior wide receiver Fmile
Harry, although he suffered a
badly bruised shoulder last
week, is probable at split end,
while Shawn Avant will take
the field at halfback.
The surprise starter for Stan
ford is at fullback, where
freshman sensation Marshall
Dillard will get the nod. In his
Cardinal debut last Saturday,
Dillard rushed for 66 yards on
13 carries and caught three
passes for 50 yards.
Like Stanford's Wiggin, USC

head mentor Tollner has had
his share of troubles this
season. Besides having a quar
terback and tailback contro
versy, USC simply has not
risen up to win the big games.
After tying Florida in their
Sept. 10 opener 19-19, the
Trojans easily disposed of
Oregon State 33-10 before
running into problems and
losing games to Kansas 26-20
and South Carolina 38-14.
USC got untracked with a
38-17 whalloping of Washing
ton State, but then watched
Arizona State and Notre Dame
do the kicking to the tune of
34-14 and 27-6 defeats,
respectively.
Six weeks into the season,
USC at 2-4-1 had twice as many
losses as wins and Trojan fans
started wondering if El Nino
affected more than the wea
ther.
Remember, USC is
supposed to finish 10-1 or, at
worst, 9-2 each year. In fact,
the Trojans are 189-47-10 since
its last losing season in 1961,
when Coach John McKay was
4-5-1 in his second of 16
seasons with USC.
But last week Tollner, who is

in his debut campaign as the
Trojans' head coach, showed
Bay Area fans that USC is a
much better football team
than its record indicates by
silencing Joe Kapp and UC-
Berkeley 19-9.
"Our defense played as well
as it has all year," Tollner said.
"We were able to put some
pressure on a quarterback,
Gale Gilbert, that is leading
the conference."
The key to that 3-4 defense
are outside linebackers Keith
Browner and Jack Del Rio.
Against the Bears, Tollner put
Del Rio into a variety of spots
across the defensive line, a
strategy that paid big
dividends as the junior All-
America candidate sacked
Cal's Gilbert four times for 44
yards in losses.
"Offensively," Tollner said,
"we still find ways to lose
good opportunities at scoring.
We just haven't been able to
make the big plays on offense
and not take ourselves out of
scoring position."
The Trojans were quite
adept at the latter skill Satur
day, fumbling twice in the Cal
end zone and being penalized
16 times for 110 yards, includ
ing eight holding penalties.
Nonetheless, the victory
over Cal boosted the Trojans'
Pac-10 record to 3-1, tying
them for second place with
Washington. And with vic
tories over Stanford, Washing
ton and UCLA, their last three
opponents, USC could con
ceivably finish first in the con
ference with a 6-1 league
mark.
While junior Sean Salisbury,
102-of-184 (55.4 percent) for
1342 yards and nine touch
downs on the season, is ex
pected to play the entire game
for Tollner, the USC coach

may use all three of his tail
backs — Michael Harper,
Todd Spencer and Fred
Crutcher.
"We haven't been able to
dominate at that position as
we have in past years," Tollner
said. "So we've been playing a
number of people there."
Each tailback has started at
one time or another this
season and consequently they
have similar statistics.
Crutcher (111 carries, 482
yards, 4.3 yards per carry) has
the most yards and Spencer
ran for 99 yards against Stan
ford last year, but Harper (84

Against the Bears, Tollner put
Del Rio into a variety of spots
across the defensive line, a
strategy that paid big
dividends as the junior All-
America candidate sacked
Cal's Gilbert four times for 44
yards in losses.
"Offensively," Tollner said,
"we still find ways to lose
good opportunities at scoring.
We just haven't been able to
make the big plays on offense
and not take ourselves out of
scoring position."
The Trojans were quite
adept at the latter skill Satur
day, fumbling twice in the Cal
end zone and being penalized
16 times for 110 yards, includ
ing eight holding penalties.
Nonetheless, the victory
over Cal boosted the Trojans'
Pac-10 record to 3-1, tying
them for second place with
Washington. And with vic
tories over Stanford, Washing
ton and UCLA, their last three
opponents, USC could con
ceivably finish first in the con
ference with a 6-1 league
mark.
While junior Sean Salisbury,
102-of-184 (55.4 percent) for
1342 yards and nine touch
downs on the season, is ex
pected to play the entire game
for Tollner, the USC coach

USC quarterback Sean Salisbury and the rest of the Trojans will try to deal Stanford its eighth
loss of the season tomorrow at the Los Angeles Coliseum. USC, however, has not had the
best of seasons as its 3-4-1 record indicates.
may use all three of his tail
backs — Michael Harper,
Todd Spencer and Fred
Crutcher.
"We haven't been able to
dominate at that position as
we have in past years," Tollner
said. "So we've been playing a
number of people there."
Each tailback has started at
one time or another this
season and consequently they
have similar statistics.
Crutcher (111 carries, 482
yards, 4.3 yards per carry) has
the most yards and Spencer
ran for 99 yards against Stan
ford last year, but Harper (84
carries, 414 yards, 4.9 yards
per carry) will start tomorrow.
In his first start of the season
last week, Harper rushed for
100 yards on 27 attempts and
caught three passes for an ad
ditional 45 yards against a

stingy Bear defense.
Another offensive force for
the Trojans is junior place
kicker Steve Jordan, who
booted four field goals against
Cal to set a single-game USC
record, jordan also owns the
career field goal (33) and dis
tance (52 yards) marks.
USC punter Troy Richard
son ranks second in the Pac
-10, averaging 42.5 yards per
kick. Washington State's Glen
Harper is first at 42.6, while
Stanford's Trip Hardin in
fourth at 42.0.
USC ranks eighth in the
conference in total offense
and fourth in total defense, in
cluding a No. 2 rating (behind
Stanford) in pass defense. The
Card is ninth in offense and
seventh in defense.
"We're a lot like Stanford
this season," Tollner noted.
"We're got some reels of film
where we look pretty damn
good. And then you can put
some on where we stink the
place up.

"You can't win if you're
going to have that kind of
football team (like Stanford)
and we've found that out,
too."
Card notes:
Cardinal fullback Rob
Moore, a fifth-year senior, re
injured his knee last week
against Oregon State and will
be out for the remainder of
the season.
Oregon State sophomore
noseguard )ohn Gonzales was
named Pac-10 Defensive
Player of the Week for his ef
forts in the Beavers' 31-18 win
over Stanford. Gonzales had
four tackles, one quarterback
sack and, most importantly, an
interception returned 15 yards
for a touchdown that iced the
game for the Beavers.
For those wishing to give a
big send-off to the Cardinal
football players today, the
team busses leave from the
front of Encina Gym on
Campus Drive at 11:50 a.m.
