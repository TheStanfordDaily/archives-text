# Greek of the Week
## 
### 
A few weeks ago, The Daily got a call
recommending neurobiology professor
Denis Baylor as a guest greek. The
anonymous caller described Baylor as an
avid Stanford fan who ends his pre-game
tailgame parties early to watch the team
warm up.
Well, The Daily decided to see just how
well this "avid Stanford fan" could pick 'em
and thus chose Baylor as this week's Greek

of the Week.
Baylor was first asked if he was a Stanford
fan, to which he replied, "I used to be â€”
before this season." Baylor then picked USC
to win tomorrow's game by 13 points.
"They (Stanford) just play like they
haven't practiced for the last four weeks,''
he said. "They look like they haven't
practiced for several weeks and then ail of a
sudden have to play a game."
