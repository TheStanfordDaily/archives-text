## USC 41, Stanford 21 
### SID SPAETH 
Stanford, Oct. 18, 1983 —
Southern California's punish
ing ground attack trampled
Stanford for 263 yards of ball
control offense while quarter
back Sean Salisbury threw for
timely completions as USC
overcame a first quarter deficit
to blast the Cardinal 41-21
here Saturday.
Heisman Trophy candidate
lohn Elway was pressured into
throwing three second-half in
terceptions — all shattering
key Stantord drives.
USC pressured Elway with a
tour-man rush enabling
linebackers and defensive
backs to drop into a blanket
zone coverage.
"They did a good job
downfield in their zones," El
way said. "We couldn't get
our receivers upfield when I
had time and when they got

open I didn't have time."
The Trojan rush sacked El
way six times. Three of those
sacks caught Elway for huge
losses taking them out of field
goal range twice in first quar

ter drives.
"The sacks hurt us," Elway
said. "They put us way behind
(the first down markers) and
you can't do that against 'SC
because they know you are
going to pass. When they
know you are going to have to
pass and don't have to worry
about the run, it puts a lot of
pressure on the guys up
front."
Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin
agreed. "The sacks really took
us out of the game early,"
Wiggin said. "We'd be sitting
second (down) and 26 (yards
to go). Even with a great of
fense that's a long way to go."
Linebacker Keith Browner
led the sack barrage with
dumps of 19 and 17 yards. He
also pulled down a key inter
ception in the second half as
the Cardinal desperately tried
to catch the Trojans.
