# Kennedy nixes Hoover-run center
## Library prospects unsure 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
If the White House and the
Hoover Institution continue to insist
that a Reagan library complex here
contain a Hoover-run public affairs
center, then it is "virtually certain"
that no Reagan complex will end up
here at all. University President
Donald Kennedy said yesterday.
His comments, made in a noon
news conference at The Daily, fol
lowed published statements by
Hoover Associate Director Dennis
Bark that Hoover is not going to
change its position and doesn't ex
pect the White House to do so
either.
"We're going to be around a long
time," Kennedy said. "So we have
to decide it the right way — for us."
Kennedy said he doesn't know
whether the White House will
change its tack. "Unless we know
whether Dennis Bark is speaking for
the White House or not, we don't
really know how to evaluate his
statement," Kennedy said.
The White House has previously
endorsed Hoover's package pro
posal for a complex containing a
Reagan library, museum and
Hoover-run policy center, but has
not yet responded to a Board of
Trustees request that it allow the
elements to be considered sepa
rately. ,
Kennedy emphasized that he and
the Board see the proposed library
and museum as an asset. "We're
making a considerable effort to deal
as forthrightly and fairly with what
we regard as really a very handsome
offer," he said.
In reference to the distribution
and dissemination by Hoover Direc
tor W. Glenn Campbell and French
Prof. Alphonse julliand of newspa
per editorials critical of Kennedy
and the University, Kennedy said, "I
think it's very unfortunate that
people within the Institution should
have to try to solve their differences
outside it."
Also at the news conference, Ken
nedy said the University is "looking
fairly hard" at establishing a Univer
sity program — which could be
anything from organic d ictivities to
a full-fledged campus -- in Wash
ington, D.C. (See story, this page.)
Responding to wide-ranging
questions from reporters at the 50-

minute-long session, Kennedy:
— Emphasized that he is taking no
initial view on the role of fraternities
and sororities in the residential sys
tem as a special University task force
begins to look into the matter. He
said that his oft-expressed statement
that students here ought to
"celebrate diversity" should not be
interpreted as a prejudgment on
fraternities and sororities, which are
largely homogenous, because they
also add to the University's diversity
in living arrangements available to
students.
"I think it (the role of fraternities)
is a complicated question and what I
think it needs is not some supposi
tion by the president or anybody

else but some thoughtful analysis of
how things are going and what the
fraternities do contribute, and what
their liabilities are, and what their
future looks like and ought to be,"
he said.
— Said any change on the current
policy to keep Reserve Officer Train
ing Corps classes-for-credit off tHo
University campus would have to be
made by the Faculty Senate, which
has objected to allowing University
credit for courses over which it had
no control.
— Defended the University deci
sion to include computers in some
residences and not others, a policy
that some have charged gives stu
dents with easy access to computers
an unfair academic advantage over
others.
— Expressed concern that con
gressional legislation sponsored by
Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.) to do

away with mandatory retirement
would make it "a lot more difficult
world" for the University with
regard to faculty appointments.
"That would produce a level of ap
pointment constipation around here
that we could hardly live with."
— Said University officials are
working with the debt-plagued Ath
letic Department, which lost
$500,000 last year, in an effort to es

tablish some expenditure controls
and develop better financial
forecasting, and said the matter will
be considered at the next meeting
of the Board of Trustees. But, refer
ring to the unpredictable nature of
the revenues that come to the Ath
letic Department, he said, "We can't
guarantee that anything we do will
take the volatility out of the situa
tion."
