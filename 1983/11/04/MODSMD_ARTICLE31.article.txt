# Cardinal booters tie USIU, jeopardize playoff chances
## 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
Two overtimes after regula
tion play, the Stanford men's
soccer team had to settle for a
2-2 tie with a relentless U.S.
International University team
at San Diego.
Not surprisingly, Cardinal
Ciancarlo Ferruzzi started off
the scoring in the game. It was
Ferruzzi's eleventh goal of the
year and once again it looked
as if Stanford was going on for
another win.
USIU never let up and coun
tered Stanford's 1-0 lead by
firing a shot in with five
minutes left in the first half.
Futile shots flew left and
right during the second half.
But all were matched with
equally skillful defensive play.
Neither team could score al
though both desperately tried
to win in regulation play.
Stanford could have just as
well ended the game then for

all the players gained in
overtime were fatigued
muscles and some extra
bruises. However, the extra
work against this strong team
may help Stanford prepare for
the even stronger University
of San Francisco te.im.
In the first two minutes of
overtime, USIU surprised
Stanford by banking the ball
home to take a 2-1 lead.
After this shot the USIU
crowd began to clear out of
the stands since the tension
had been broken. They should
be glad they left.
Just as victory was in the
grasp of USIU, Stanford's
senior All-America player
)orge Titinger took a well
placed Ferruzzi pass and
squirmed by defenders to fire
a rocket into USIU s goal with
two minutes left in the first
overtime.
The faithful USIU fans who

stayed for the second
overtime saw the exact same
thing that they saw in the
second half: both teams
desperately trying to win
before the clock ran out.
Stanford did have an excel
lent chance to win in the
second overtime. USIU played
with only 10 players due to a
red card after both teams had
scored their second goals.
Though the odds were on its
side, Stanford could not take
advantage of the situation.
The players were too weary
from all the game time and did
not muster enougli energy for
a goal.
Yesterday's tie set Stan
ford's record at 12-3-3 this
season. Although respectable,
the record still is not good
enough to make the playoffs
unless Stanford wins its next
two games against USF and
Fresno.
