# No. 7 Card poloists must win in L.A. to keep NCAA chances alive

### ROB ZWEIG 
Four games remain in the
Stanford water polo team's
regular season schedule and
the Cardinal must follow a
simple formula to land an
NCAA championship berth.
They must win.
The 11-9-3 and seventh
rated Cardinal will get its first
two chances when they travel
to Los Angeles to meet No. 3
UCLA tonight and No. 6 USC
tomorrow morning.
Eight teams compete in the
NCAA Championships in Long
Beach Nov. 25-27 and by
all guesses three clubs will be
Pacific-10 Conference mem
bers.
At 0-2 in the conference,
Stanford trails No. 1 UC-
Berkeley, UCLA and USC â€”
the Card's only remaining op
ponents. One need not be a
genius to figure out that a

poor road-trip could seal Stan
ford's fate for 1983.
"If we win three out of four
(of the remaining games) we'll
go," declared Head Coach
Dante Dettamanti. "If we win
two out of four we have a
chance of going."
Obviously, third place USC
is the team Stanford must pass
to earn a trip to Long Beach
and the Card would like noth
ing better than dumping the
Trojans to avenge a 6-5 last
second loss six days ago at
DeCuerre pool.
To do so, Stanford must
stop USC's Mike Spicer, who
riddled the Cardinal defense
with four goals when the two
teams last met.
"We know who they want to
go to," Dettamanti said in ref
erence to USC's All-America
hopetul. "Everybody's got to

be aware of him and be able to
help out."
Most aware will be fresh
man Chris Thompson who
draws the lucky assignment of
shadowing Spicer and junior
Steve Moyer, Stanford's
goaltender, on Saturday.
But before Stanford gets a
crack at the Trojans, the Card
must tackle the UCLA Bruins
in an unusual indoor, evening
contest. This is the same Bruin
squad that used its size and
depth to crank out five un
answered scores late in their
13-7 win over Stanford on Oc
tober 8.
Dettamanti is undaunted,
contending that the Cardinal
are now deeper and more ex
perienced. "They wore us
down, but we'll be better able
to handle it. We'll be ready to
play this time."
Senior goalie Martin Fisher

will try to stop UCLA's potent
outside shooters and he may
have to be especially sharp be
cause Stanford's offense, led
by ]aime Velez (36 goals) and
David Imbernino (34), may be
at a disadvantage in the un
familiar indoor setting. Accor
ding to Dettamanti, the indoor
pool offers a "completely dif
ferent perspective" from the
normal outdoor surroundings
so the Cardinal gunners may
need a few minutes to adjust.
Still, the Stanford coach is
confident that his young club
can return with two upset vic
tories, saying, "The odds are
not in our favor, but these
guys have responded to the
pressure before.
"We have the capabilities to
beat them both," he added.
"Whether we can beat them
back-to-back . . ~" remains to
be seen.
