# Host own tourney today
## Women linksters take fifth 
### TRASK LEONARD 
Coming off a rainout at
Tulsa two weeks ago, the
Stanford women's golf
team took fifth place at the
rain-shortened Women's
Western Intercollegiate at
Kancho Murieta on Wed
nesday with a score of 624.
The Cardinal now plays
host to the Stanford Fall In
tercollegiate today and
tomorrow at the Stanford
Golf Course.
Sophomore Julie Car
michael finished highest
for the Cardinal, carding a
152, with Kathy McCarthy
close behind at 153.
Tulsa captured the team
honors, defeating Southern
Methodist in a playoff after
the two teams finished the
two rounds deadlocked at
600 strokes. Other team
scores were USC at 613,
Texas A & M at 619, Arizona
State at 626, San lose State
at 632 and Indiana and U.S.
International tied at 636.
"It was a disappointing
tournament for us," said
Cardinal Coach Tim
Baldwin. "We had hoped
to finish near the top, but
the anxiety among our
players over the second
rain delay in two tourna
ments caused them to try
too hard. Yet we definitely
learned from our
mistakes."
The toughest lesson to
learn came for McCarthy,
who finished only six
strokes behind medalist
Kim Gardner of Tulsa.
McCarthy was in third place
after the first round, but

with seven penalty strokes
for both days she was
nosed out of the top spot.
"Kathy and I realize that
she made a few mental
mistakes at Rancho
Murieta, and I think she
won't make the same ones
next time," Baldwin said.
One bright spot was the
play of Carmichael, who
shot well despite very wet
conditions on the resort
golf course near
Sacramento. Baldwin ex
pects Carmichael to con
tinue her streak at this

weekend's Stanford Fall In
tercollegiate.
Despite the disappoint
ment at Rancho Murieta,
hope remains high for the
first round of the tourna
ment today.
"Crazy things happened
earlier this week. That's the
nature of the game of
golf," explained team
member Diane Nixon. "We
all realize that we definitely
have the talent to be in the
spotlight consistently, and
on our course this
weekend, we should reach
that point.
