## SUNDAY BRUNCH Memories of brunch at home

Come Sunday morning, nothing is
more satisfying than a warm,
homecooked meal in a comfortable,
relaxing atmosphere. Though home may
be far away, The Bay Window in Menlo
Park comes close to filling the bill.
After only a few minutes driving, we
arrived at the Bay Window, a small, un-
I pretentious place, tucked away on a quiet
I side street (Alma Street, Menlo Park is
I quite different from Alma Street, Palo
I Alto) behind large, leafy maple trees.
I We were met at the entrance by a
friendly waitress who offered us our
■ choice of tables. I chose one by a large
I picture window, the sill of which was
I adorned by a large vase of colorful
I flowers. Upon closer inspection, they
E turned out to be plastic, but after all,
I where can you find tulips and daffodils in
I October?
The interior of this old-fashioned, high-
Iceilinged building is mostly wood,
B adorned with patterned wallpaper and
white painted trim. The decor provides
•such a warm, hospitable atmosphere that
we were sure this building had originally
( been built as a private home. The only
things detracting from the homey impres
sion are the plastic, chain-restaurant type
| tables.
Sunday brunch, served from 10 a.m. to
2:30 p.m., offers a variety of tempting
omelettes ($4.50-4.75), several quiches
(all $4.50), French toast with Nine Grain
Bread ($4.50) and specialties such as Eggs
Benedict ($6), Crab Crepes ($5.75) and
Cheese Blintzes ($5.50). Before deciding,
I ordered a Mimosa (orange juice and
champagne, $1). My friend ordered or

ange juice, and was surprised and disap
pointed to learn that they were out. This
was forgivable only because the place
gave us the feeling of being a guest in
someone's home, not of being in a res
tuarant where one expects professional
service.
We also ordered a piece of Pecan Sour
Cream Coffee Cake ($1) for starters which
was large, moist and delicious. (This is
quite a compliment, coming from some
one who doesn't like coffee cake.)
When it came time to order, my guest
chose the Eggs Benedict ($6) but I had a
hard time making a decision. The
Avocado & Cream Cheese Omelette
($4.75), the Swiss & Cheddar Cheese
Omelette ($4.50) and the Spinach & Sour
Cream Omelette ($4.50) all sounded
equally delicious. Our waitress favored
the Avocado & Cream Cheese, so I went
by her recommendation. We also or
dered bacon ($.75).
Our meals soon arrived, complete with
mounds of steaming hash browns and a
small bowl of mixed fruit. My omelette
was filled with fresh, tasty avocado and
chunks of smooth cream cheese. It was
rich, creamy and delicious. I found it to
be quite filling, though; definitely some
thing for the very hungry. My only com
plaint was that the omelette could have
used a bit more seasoning. The hash
browns were excellent, but the bacon
was too salty and too crisp for my taste.
My partner enjoyed his Eggs Benedict
also. The eggs were soft boiled just the
right amount, the ham was tasty but not
too salty, and the Hollandaise sauce
added a special extra bit of flavor. I
couldn't resist sampling his entree, and
found it to be even a bit better than my
omelette.
The service was not very professional,
yet it was highly satisfactory. Our waitress

really seemed to care about her custom
ers.
After the meal, we spoke with the
manager about the restaurant and its his
tory. It was established 17 vears ago to
support The Family Service Association of
the Mid-Peninsula, a non-profit organiza
tion which provides professional counsel
ing services to local families. The restau
rant is operated by The Bay Window Aux
iliary, whose members volunteer at the
restaurant in management and food
services. During the week, all the
waitresses are volunteers who donate
even their tips to The Family Service Or
ganization.
The Bay Window is also open for lunch
Monday through Friday, and for dinner
Tuesday through Saturday. After looking
at the dinner menu, I was very tempted to
return. It features such dishes as Veal
Scallopini Marsala ($10.25), N.Y. Strip
Steak ($10.75), Chicken Curry ($9.25),
Prawns & Pasta ($9.75) and much more.
Desserts include Homemade Pie a la
mode ($1.75), Pecan Pie ($1.75), Amaretto
or Chocolate Mousse Torte (both $1.75)
among other luscious-sounding sweets.

chunks of smooth cream cheese. It was
rich, creamy and delicious. I found it to
be quite filling, though; definitely some
thing for the very hungry. My only com
plaint was that the omelette could have
used a bit more seasoning. The hash
browns were excellent, but the bacon
was too salty and too crisp for my taste.
My partner enjoyed his Eggs Benedict
also. The eggs were soft boiled just the
right amount, the ham was tasty but not
too salty, and the Hollandaise sauce
added a special extra bit of flavor. I
couldn't resist sampling his entree, and
found it to be even a bit better than my
omelette.
The service was not very professional,
yet it was highly satisfactory. Our waitress

really seemed to care about her custom
ers.
After the meal, we spoke with the
manager about the restaurant and its his
tory. It was established 17 vears ago to
support The Family Service Association of
the Mid-Peninsula, a non-profit organiza
tion which provides professional counsel
ing services to local families. The restau
rant is operated by The Bay Window Aux
iliary, whose members volunteer at the
restaurant in management and food
services. During the week, all the
waitresses are volunteers who donate
even their tips to The Family Service Or
ganization.
The Bay Window is also open for lunch
Monday through Friday, and for dinner
Tuesday through Saturday. After looking
at the dinner menu, I was very tempted to
return. It features such dishes as Veal
Scallopini Marsala ($10.25), N.Y. Strip
Steak ($10.75), Chicken Curry ($9.25),
Prawns & Pasta ($9.75) and much more.
Desserts include Homemade Pie a la
mode ($1.75), Pecan Pie ($1.75), Amaretto
or Chocolate Mousse Torte (both $1.75)
among other luscious-sounding sweets.

THE BAY WINDOW
1026 Alma
Menlo Park, CA

Come Sunday morning, nothing is
more satisfying than a warm,
homecooked meal in a comfortable,
relaxing atmosphere. Though home may
be far away, The Bay Window in Menlo
Park comes close to filling the bill.
After only a few minutes driving, we
arrived at the Bay Window, a small, un-
I pretentious place, tucked away on a quiet
I side street (Alma Street, Menlo Park is
I quite different from Alma Street, Palo
I Alto) behind large, leafy maple trees.
I We were met at the entrance by a
friendly waitress who offered us our
■ choice of tables. I chose one by a large
I picture window, the sill of which was
I adorned by a large vase of colorful
I flowers. Upon closer inspection, they
E turned out to be plastic, but after all,
I where can you find tulips and daffodils in
I October?
The interior of this old-fashioned, high-
Iceilinged building is mostly wood,
B adorned with patterned wallpaper and
white painted trim. The decor provides
•such a warm, hospitable atmosphere that
we were sure this building had originally
( been built as a private home. The only
things detracting from the homey impres
sion are the plastic, chain-restaurant type
| tables.
Sunday brunch, served from 10 a.m. to
2:30 p.m., offers a variety of tempting
omelettes ($4.50-4.75), several quiches
(all $4.50), French toast with Nine Grain
Bread ($4.50) and specialties such as Eggs
Benedict ($6), Crab Crepes ($5.75) and
Cheese Blintzes ($5.50). Before deciding,
I ordered a Mimosa (orange juice and
champagne, $1). My friend ordered or

ange juice, and was surprised and disap
pointed to learn that they were out. This
was forgivable only because the place
gave us the feeling of being a guest in
someone's home, not of being in a res
tuarant where one expects professional
service.
We also ordered a piece of Pecan Sour
Cream Coffee Cake ($1) for starters which
was large, moist and delicious. (This is
quite a compliment, coming from some
one who doesn't like coffee cake.)
When it came time to order, my guest
chose the Eggs Benedict ($6) but I had a
hard time making a decision. The
Avocado & Cream Cheese Omelette
($4.75), the Swiss & Cheddar Cheese
Omelette ($4.50) and the Spinach & Sour
Cream Omelette ($4.50) all sounded
equally delicious. Our waitress favored
the Avocado & Cream Cheese, so I went
by her recommendation. We also or
dered bacon ($.75).
Our meals soon arrived, complete with
mounds of steaming hash browns and a
small bowl of mixed fruit. My omelette
was filled with fresh, tasty avocado and
chunks of smooth cream cheese. It was
rich, creamy and delicious. I found it to
be quite filling, though; definitely some
thing for the very hungry. My only com
plaint was that the omelette could have
used a bit more seasoning. The hash
browns were excellent, but the bacon
was too salty and too crisp for my taste.
