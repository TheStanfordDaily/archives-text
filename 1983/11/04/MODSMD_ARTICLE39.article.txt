# Fruit and eggs at a French spot

PEAR WILLIAMS
RESTAURANT FRANCAIS

Sunday brunch spots are not a rare com
modity around Stanford. And there isn't ex
actly a shortage of French restaurants.
Trying to find the two together is when the
going gets tough.
But you can take a drive to Menlo Park,
down the tree-shaded parts of Middlefield
Road, to discover brunch at a modest
French dining place, Pear Williams.
We arrived earlier than the rush — maybe
that's why we had to wait several minutes
before being seated by the less-than
friendly hostess. But our service after being
seated was near-to-perfect. Our friendly
waitress promptly offered the choice of a
glass of juice — orange, tomato or apple, or
champagne, brought a basket containing a
variety of interesting muffins and directed
us to the fruit buffet.
Still a bit sleepy from a long Saturday
night, we rested at our table for two, bright
ly lit by the sun shining through the cur
tained window. We had been given the op
tion of sitting outside on either of two
patios, but for fear of the fall chill, opted to
remain indoors. We regretted our decision
after the meal when we stepped outside
and discovered the lovely setting and
decor.
The ambiance inside Pear Williams is odd.
Vou can't decide if the restaurant is trying to
look like a very fancy French spot or a more
relaxed place that one would expect to find
in Marin. The wallpaper has strange looking
characters on it — people who we guessed
were supposed to look like French natives.
The most odd part of Pear Williams is the

decoration of the four or five booths: Each
one is made from creatively carved wood
and painted with a variety of pastel colors.
After we finished trying to figure out what
the wood carvings stood for, we made our
way to the fruit buffet, which is lovely. There
is a wide range of fresh fruit — from
grapefruit to watermelon to strawberries.
While the fruit itself is delicious, the top
pings make it extra good. It was a tough
choice between the brown sugar, powdered
sugar, sour cream, whipped cream and
other goodies.
The decision of which entree to order
wasn't easy either. While we opted for the
steak and eggs and eggs benedict (How can
you do a brunch review and not order eggs
benedict?), the French toast, red snapper,
crepes of the day and avocado filled with
chicken salad all were awfully tempting. At
Pear Williams, there is no consideration of
price because the brunch is set at $8.95.
Unfortunately, the food was only
mediocre. The steak was a bit tough and
over spiced. The scrambled eggs were fine
— not too watery or rubbery, but nothing
spectacular. The home style potatoes were
tasty: They had nice crisp skins, while the in
nards were still soft and warm.
The eggs benedict were good, but again
not spectacular. The English muffins were a
bit soggy and the consistency of the Hollan
daise sauce was too much like sour cream.
But the eggs were poached to perfection.
As we were readying to leave, we asked
the friendly waitress what the name "Pear
Williams" is from — and realized that our
knowledge of French foods is lacking. She
described the delicious-sounding, tradition
al French dessert and even though we
weren't thrilled with our meal at Pear Wil
liams, we decided we might give it another
try.
