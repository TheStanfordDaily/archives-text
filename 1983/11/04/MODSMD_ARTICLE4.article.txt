The University is seriously consid
ering a residential program in Wash
ington, D.C. where students could
earn academic credit for research
conducted in public service intern
ships, according to University admi
nistrators.
The University is looking at a pro
gram similar to Cornell University's
Cornell-in-Washington program, ac
cording to Michael Lighty, a student
assistant to University President
Donald Kennedy's staff.
"It's like an overseas experi
ence," he said. "You stay in a house
with other students. You do aca
demic courses and research work as
an intern. The work you do as an in
tern ends up becoming a paper or a
thesis worth twelve credits."
While the University is looking at
many possible programs, Lighty
said, "We're looking more toward
the Cornell model."
According to Catherine Milton, an
assistant to President Donald Ken
nedy, Stanford is seriously consider
ing an academic program in Wash
ington, D.C. Milton said, "We have
been looking at what other schools
have done."
"We've spoken to a variety of

people. It's being actively and
seriously considered," she said.
Milton pointed out that Stanford
is looking for "an academic compo
nent that makes sense . . . that's the
primary concern."
Kennedy hinted at the proposal in
a news conference at The Daily yes
terday.
"We are talking to friends in
Washington about forming a kind of
sustaining group there to help us
with any activities we do, also with a
group of distinguished public ser
vants in Washington who have or
would like a Stanford connection to
help us," Kennedy said.
"It's something we're talking
about, something we're looking at
fairly hard," he said.
Kennedy said that such a program
would become an asset to the pres
ent student-run Stanford-in-
Government program. Stanford
in-Government currently helps
nearly 150 students to obtain posi
tions in Washington, D.C each sum
mer to serve as interns on Capitol
Hill and in government agencies.
The program helps students to gain
valuable experience, but not for aca
demic credit.
The proposed program, would, as
Milton put it, . . be a program
with an academic base." Students
would probably live together in a
house or share a dormitory at a

Washington-based school. Geor
getown University and American
University are currently hosting ex
changes of this nature. Lighty added
that the program would probably be
"a semester or quarter done for
credit."
Milton has been talking to alumni,

faculty and students, in particular,
those involved with Stanford-in-
Government. "The alumni is enthu
siastic," Milton said, "They've of
fered program ideas and to help in
finding better internship opportuni
ties."
