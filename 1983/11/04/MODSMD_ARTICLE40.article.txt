What were you doing at 8:30 a.m. Sun
day morning? Many hungry health food
connoisseurs tried to beat the breakfast
crowd at Late for the Train. Because of
Late for the Train's cozy atmosphere,
carefully prepared meals and
warmhearted service, the restaurant was
filled minutes after opening.
Late for the Train was created to offer
traditional breakfast and lunch items —
omelettes, soups, salads and sandwiches
— in the most traditional way. In the res
taurant business these days, the
"traditional' preparation that Late for the
Train offers is no longer customary. It
combines the freshest, natural in
gredients with old-fashioned T.L.C. They
buy organic fresh produce, foods without
preservatives, and even make their own
jam. They are conscientious about the
meals they offer, so each item is cooked
carefully to order, desserts and scones
are baked daily on the premises, and
homemade soup stock is always simmer
ing on the stove. Both nutritional needs
and savory taste are key.
Late for the Train's present acclamation
is well deserved because they began by
challenging the minds of the community.
At first wary customers steered away from
hot tofu and marinated bulghar wheat,
and even walked out because no bacon
was served with the eggs. But one try at
wholesomeness has changed the minds
of some of the most entrenched junk
food addicts. Late for the Train's persis
tence and consistently good food has
earned it its crowds.
One feels comfortable at Late for the
Train because it is decorated like
grandma's house. Delicate lace adorns
the windows and cheerfulness is added

by hanging plants. Coziness is accom
plished by creating a "place" for each
customer that he can call his own. The
decor is not institutionalized, rather at
tention to detail is carried from corner to
corner and table to table.
Each table has a unique salt and pepper
set, its own floral table cloth and napkins,
and lace accents that the owner has col
lected. The overall effect is a per
sonalized, country-style decor. One can
now be intimate and cozy in what was
once the building of a greasy spoon ham
burger joint.
Late for the Train personifies the
original idea behind a "family-style" res
taurant. If there is a wait for a table, cour
tesy spiced tea or coffee is given. You are
spoiled rather than served. The back
ground classical music sets a relaxed
mood. The customer's leisure is encour
aged, but the service is prompt and effi
cient.
Grandmother must have put in her two
cents worth when the owners planned
the menu. All the meals are well
balanced, served with tamaried potatoes,
fresh fruit or cottage cheese. The
omelettes are all vegetarian, but by using
combinations of muenster, rennettless
cheddar, parmesan and cream cheese,
steamed and sauteed vegetables, tomato,
avocado and roasted turkey breast, quite
an innovative list is comprised ($4.25-
5.50). On a dare one might even try the
chicken liver omelette or the fresh fruit
omelette.
To impress a customer with "just an
omelette" takes an extra step in presenta
tion and quality of ingredients. My guest
was aware of this difference, even if he
could not pinpoint the renettless cheese
as the recipe's secret. Complete egg
breakfasts with fruit, potatoes and scone
are $3.25 and combination egg dishes
with pancakes and potatoes are a steal at
$4. Other than just eggs, whole grain

pancakes, French toast, cheese blintzes
and fruit kebobs are available.
My cheese blintzes were served with an
unusual apple/berry sauce and sour
cream, and are recommended tor those
aspiring gourmets who enjoy ordering
unusual things that are not easily
"reproducable" at home. Late tor the
Train realizes that some may be a bit more
continental in their breakfast tastes, so
scones ($1.30) and fruit with yogurt
($2.30) and most breakfast items can be
ordered ala carte.
Not offered on Sundays but also
available are hot open faced sandwiches
($5), unusually combined cold sandwiches
($4-4.50), homemade soup ($1.50), and
large "earthy" salads (s6> served with un
usual dressings as Buttermilk Dill, Honey
Lemon and Curry Yogurt. I was amazed to
see that each sandwich or salad was a
combination of at least eight different
items. The menu is so overwhelming that
indicision could be a problem, but Late
for the Train even satisfies this dilemma.
Half-and-half specials are $4, and are
either half a sandwich and a small soup or
salad, or the combination of a soup, salad
and scone. The portions are very
generous. I have long been among the
regular clientele, so with persistence it is
possible to sample all the intriguing
delights mentioned. You can even take
the "Train" on the run; they will gladly
package meals for the office or school or
perhaps a special picnic in the park or
breakfast in bed delivery.
If you do not feel that University Food
Service is tantalizing your palate or offer
ing you the wholesome goodness you
deserve, Late for the Train (or its sister
operation, Flea Street on Alameda) is anx
ious to take care of you. If you miss the
warm feeling of Grandma's breakfast
nook, let Late for the Train pamper you.
