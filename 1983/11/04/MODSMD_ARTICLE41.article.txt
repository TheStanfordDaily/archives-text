Sunday mornings are made for two wonder
ful things — sleeping and eating. And with Sun
day brunches one can enjoy both. With this in
mind, we headed to the Customs House in
Foster City late one Sunday morning.
We had both been to the Customs House
before for dinner and had been quite im
pressed by both the food and atmosphere,
which is appreciated after the 25-minute drive
to get there. This time we were not quite so im
pressed.
The atmosphere was still most enjoyable:
The restaurant is located in the Edgewater Place
shopping center, and as the name suggests, the
restaurant's large windows overlook a small
lake. As we ate, we were able to watch the sun
break through the clouds and gently glaze over
the water. Our eggs unfortunately did not
receive such delicate treatment and were quite
overcooked.
One of us ordered Ed's Benedict ($7.95), one
of five special brunches which come with a bas
ket of homemade doughnuts (six of them
deep-fried, plain yet luscious) and a glass of
California champagne. The other opted for The
Mushroom Connection omelette ($4.25).
Ed's poached eggs looked yummy, sitting
atop the tomato, ham and grilled English muf

fin halves. But even the Welsh Rarebit sauce
and bacon added on could not cover up the
fact that the eggs were rubbery.
As for the omelette, it also was too well-done
and the sauteed mushrooms inside, which
seemed drowned in butter, were of no help.
Swiss cheese and onions rounded out the rest
of the entree. This dish would have been much
improved with a sauce over the omelette to
give it the added zesty seasoning it so
desperately needed to escape its blandness.
Most of the dishes come with a side order of
Potatoes O'Brien. These would taste much bet
ter if they were warmer than ours were. Fresh
fruit is also included.
The Customs House otters a large range of
entrees — from the Hawaiian Dream (two eggs
with a grilled ham steak and hotcakes — $7.95)
and Joe's Special (ground meat, spinach,
mushrooms mixed into scrambled eggs —
$5.95) to the more usual burger, quiche and
B.L.T. faire.
Brunch runs from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and there
is limited seating outside in good weather.
Inside there is quite a mix of people from the
elderly condo crowd to the leisurely
young executives, many of whom can be found
in or near the bar watching the football game
on a large TV screen.
