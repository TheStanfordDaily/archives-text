The African Queen (1951)
Kresge Auditorium
John Huston's comedy
adventure, set in Africa in 1914,
stars Katharine Hepburn and
Humphrey Bogart as the most
outlandish romantic couple
imaginable: a prim missionary
and a tippling riverboat cap
tain. Perhaps no one could
have guessed how beautifully
they'd work together — both
give classic comic perfor
mances. This marvelous film
has a screenplay by lames
Agee, )ohn Collier and Hus
ton, out of a C.S. Forester
novel, and Jack Cardiff shot it;
in a small but memorable ap
pearance, Robert Morley plays
Hepburn's brother. Not to be
missed.
Plays tonight.
Trading Places (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
Sour and sentimental make a
vile mixture. In |ohn Landis'
comedy, two revolting old
men, stock broker brothers
played by Ralph Bellamy and
Don Ameche, betting over the
relative influences of genetics
and environment, humiliate
and fire a young white execu
tive (Dan Aykroyd, in possibly
his worst screen appearance)
and replace him with a wily
black con man (Eddie
Murphy). Landis doesn't pos
sess the requisite delicacy to
make the premise of the
Timothy Harris-Herschel
Weingrod script plausible on
any level. The picture is in
furiating, despite the presence
of the prodigiously gifted
Eddie Murphy. With a bizarre
supporting cast: Denholm Ei
liott, )amie Lee Curtis, Alfred
Drake, Bo Diddley, Frank Oz,
Paul Cleason, lames Belushi,
Franken & Davis, Philip Bosco,
Avon Long, Barry Dennen.
Plays Sunday evening.
Hiroshima Mon Amour
(1959)
Terman Auditorium
A French woman tells her
Japanese lover all that she has
seen in Hiroshima — the
museums, the monuments to
the 1945 atrocity — and he
replies, repeatedly and in an
unvarying meFvotone-,—'-'-You

haven't seen anything in Hiros
hima. You haven't seen anyth
ing." Watching this picture is
about as interesting as listen
ing to an hour and a half of
traffic noises — except that
the dialogue has considerably
less vitality than traffic. Alain
Resnais directed, Marguerite
Duras wrote the screenplay,
and Emmanuelle Riva gives a
remarkably modulated perfor
mance — all things consid
ered — as the woman.
Plays Tuesday evening.
You Only Live Twice (1967)
Kresge Auditorium
One of the smoother and
more entertaining of the James
Bonds, made before Sean Con
nery had left the series (for the
first time). The setting is Japan;
Terence Young directed, and
the credits include a
screenplay by Ronald Dahl and
photography by Freddie Young
and Bob Huke. Charles Cray
and Donald Pleasance head
the supporting cast.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Diva (1982)
Cubberley Auditorium
The high-tech chic of this
picture, directed by Jean-
Jacques Beinix and shot by
Philippe Rousselot, is daz
zling; all the surfaces glitter.
It's a Versailles of a movie.
Beinix's chief virtue, aside
from his dexterity, is his deter
mination not to take himself
seriously: the witty, freewheel
ing way in which he has put the
picture together, making his
camera double back on itself
with tantalizing self
consciousness, seems to be
based on the careless assump
tion that this little thriller about
stolen tapes is inconsequen
tial. You can't complain that
Diva doesn't mean anything,
because Beinix's tyle and the
weightless, hollow shimmer of
Hilton McConnico's interior
design declare it in every
frame. With Frederic Andrei,
who recalls the Jean-Pierre
Leaud of the middle and late
19605; Thuy An Luu, who has
the unflappable cool of a
Godard gamine; and the black
singer Wilhelminia Wiggins
Fernandez. Beinix and Jean
Van Hamme adapted a novel
by Deltfcbrta;"»»nd VladimrT

Cosma supplied a terrific jazzy
score.
Plays tonight.
The Bicycle Thief (1948)
Festival, Palo Alto
Vittorio De Sica's fable about
a man driven to stealing in the
poverty-stricken Rome of the
post-World War II epoch ap
pears on every list of all-time
great movies. Like the two
other neo-realist masterpieces
De Sica made with
screenwriter Cesare Zavattini,
Shoeshine and Umberto D,
this movie touches one so in
timately that it is almost an in
vasion of privacy; it is
shocking, shattering and fi
nally exhilarating. De Sica
takes us to the deepest reaches
of despair and out the other
side. With Lamberto Mag
giorani, Lianella Carelli and
Enzo Staiola.
Plays through Wednesday
with King of Hearts.

Hearts and Mind (1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
When the Peter Davis-Bert
Schneider anti-Vietnam docu
mentary won an Oscar, many
people spoke of the new pro
gressive attitude of the
Academy. But hel who didn't
speak out against Vietnam in
1975? This movie scores its
points very easily — and very
cheaply. The father of a dead
soldier, interviewed in 1970,
praises Nixon, and the post-
Watergate audiei te snickers
on cue, including those who
had voted for Nixon in 1968
and 1972; the grieving father's
tragedy should dignify him,
but the film makes him look
like a boob. This manipulative
movie, which sets up its vil
lains — Nixon, Westmoreland
et al — as straw men from the
outset, is deeply offensive to
hawks and doves alike.
Plays tomorrow with Season
of Thunder.

Los Olvidados (1950)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Luis Bunuel's study of slum
children in Mexico City is so
fierce, graphic and unsen
timental that it cleanses an au
dience; its power, passion and
stark beauty are roughly com
parable to Picasso's Guernica
— although the characters are
defeated in a different kind of
war. The boys are played by Al
fonso Mejia (Pedro), Roberto
Cobo (Jaibo), Mario Ramirez
("Little Eyes") and Javier Amez
cua (as the luckless Julian), Es
tela Inda gives a forceful,
complex performance as
Pedro's mother, who loves him
but denies it until too late. In
the most terrifying sequence,
Pedro dreams of his mother of
fering him freshly killed meat;
in his imagination, she turns
into a vampire. Screenplay by
Bunuel and Luis Alcoriza;
Gabriel Figueroa photo
graphed.
Plays Monday with Diary of a
Chambermaid.

After the Thin Man (1936)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Frances Goodrich and Albert
Hackett, the authors of the
original Thin Man script,
worked on this sequel, too,
but it's rather heavy-handed
and it seems awfully long. The
colorful cast includes Elissa
Landi, displaying her 1920s
drawing-room melodrama
style; lessie Ralph as a tyranni
cal matriarch; Joseph Calleia as
a beady-eyed gangster; Alan
Marshall as an alcoholic;
Teddy Hart as a lawyer; Sam
Levene as a cop; and )immy
Stewart, giving arguably his
worst performance (at least un
til Hitchcock's Rope). Nick and
Nora Charles, the highball
slinging sleuths, are played
once again by William Powell
and Myrna Loy, and Asta's still
around, too, trying to keep a
new dog in town away from his
canine wife. Directed by
W S.Van Dyke.
Plays Thursday with The Thin
Man.

Cousin, Cousine (1976)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
)ean-Charles Tacchiella s
comedy has plenty of what
many reviewers call "Gallic
charm:" that usually means
tiresome jokes about sex and
stupid, insensitive characters
whose interminable interplay
is supposed to give audiences
boundless pleasure. This one
did, apparently — it was a huge
hit — which makes it an even
more infuriating picture in
retrospect. Marie-France Pis it*r
is the best thing in it.
Plays Wednesday with The
Gift.
The Thin Man (19 14)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Most people have forgotten
who the murderer is in this fa
mous adaptation of the Dash
iell Hammett novel, hut not
who the detectives are; Nick
and Nora Charles, the most
elegant sleuthing combination
in the history of movies. Never
without a highball or a bon
mot, they suavely killed off the
stagebound, schematic thril
lers of the early talkie period,
and became so popular that
five sequels were made (the
last one in 1947). (An amusing
bit of trivia: the title alludes to
a detail of the mystery, but it
caught on so last that all the
follow-ups had The Thin Man
stuck, irrelevantly, in their
titles.) William Powell and
Myrna Loy proved to be so
good together (and such a
smash at the box office) that
they teamed on several other
films, too, including Ihe Great
Ziegfeld, in which he played
the celebrated impressario and
she played Billie Burke.
Screenplay (a smart one) by
Frances Goodrich and Albert
Hackett; W.S.Van Dyke di
rected (more deftly than
usual).
Plays Thursday with After the
Th in Man.
King of Hearts (1967)
Festival, Palo Alto
Many people have an inex
plicable fondness for this
benign satirical comedy about
a French town taken over by
the insane. (In the early 70s,
one revival house in
Cambridge, Massachusetts ran
it for two years, and you could
never get in on a weekend
night without standing in line
for an hour.) The director,
Philippe De Broca, has made
much better movies; in this
one, he takes delicacy to a
fault. With Alan Bates, Pierre
Brasseur, Jean-Claude Brialy,
Genevieve Bujold, Francoise
Christophe and Adolfo Celi (a
classy cast).
. Plays through Wednesday
with The Bicycle Thief.
