# Filipino official denies government involvement in Aquino assassination
## 
### SHIRISH DATE 
The consul-general of the
Philippine consulate in San Fran
cisco yesterday denied government
complicity in the Aug. 21 assassina
tion of opposition leader Benigno
Aquino.
Romeo Arguelles addressed an
audience of approximately 50
people at Treat House, the East
Asian studies theme house.
Arguelles, a classmate of Aquino
in college, called the assassination
"an unfortunate tragedy" and
blamed the Western media for
groundlessly "pointing a finger
towards the government." He called
on Americans to use their own prin
ciple of presumed innocence until
proven guilt and wait until the inves
tigation had been completed before
making "unfair accusations."
"The Filipino government is more
interested than anybody else in
trying to see that this investigation
will be able to pinpoint the guilty
party or parties," he said.

In defending this claim, Arguelles
cited the makeup of the investigat
ing commission. The original com
mission came under attack because

its head, retired chief justice of the
Philippine Supreme court Enrique
Fernando, was appointed by
Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos.
Arguelles pointed out that all the

members of the commission, in
cluding Fernando, resigned to allow
a new commission to come in and
operate without "a cloud of doubt"
regarding its credibility.
The new commission, he said,
was recommended by various seg
ments of the private sector, includ
ing professional, business, industry,
labor and education interests.
Arguelles also commented upon a
resolution passed by the U.S. House
of Representatives regarding the
Aquino assasination. He described
the resolution as asking for an im
partial investigation into the killing
as well as for "fair and honest" elec
tions in 1984.
Arguelles referred to this piece of
legislation as "blatant interference
in the internal affairs of another
country."
He said he appreciated American
concern but added that the assasina
tion was a domestic matter and that
"the congressmen have no business
in our internal affairs."
