# Housing waiting list as long as ever
## 
### DAMON VALDEZ 
Despite the recent opening of 800
new spaces at the Governor's Cor
ner complex, the University's
housing waiting list is as long as
ever.
Last September the waiting list
contained the names of 370 under
graduates. This year, even with the
many new spaces available, that
number has not declined.
"There is shopping going on this
year that has never gone on in the
past," said Roger Whitney, director
of the Housing Center. "But this
does not mean that those students
(on the waiting list) have no place to
live."
Whitney pointed out ex
tra housing caused many students,
who would have otherwise thought
their chances of acquiring desirable,
on-campus housing impossible, to
"hang on" and add their names to
the waiting list.
Whitney also noted that some stu
dents who were assigned a second
or third choice in the spring draw of
ten join the waiting list anyway to
see if they can acquire better
housing.
This is especially true in the case
of the sumptuous Governor's Cor
ner complex. "They're incredibly
desirable," said Deborah Drew, as
sistant to the director of the
Housing Center.
Drew said that students assigned
or unassigned, guaranteed or not,
will join the waiting list if there is a
chance that a vacancy will open up
at Governor's Corner.
"The tastes of a student are also a
factor in deciding to remain on the
waiting list," Drew said.

While Governor's Corner opened
up 800 new spaces for undergradu
ates, many undergraduate spaces in
Manzanita Park were given to
graduate students. In addition, the
number of people assigned per
trailer this year dropped from four
to three.
As a result, undergraduates only
gained about 700 new spaces.
Drew said the University's Resi
dential Education system is very
flexible, allowing students who wish

to sample the many diverse types of
housing available here the opportu
nity to do so by permanently putting
their names on the waiting list.
Whitney agreed, emphasizing that
despite the existence of a waiting
list, student housing is not a very
large problem here at Stanford.
"Even if there were enough
spaces for every student, there
would still be a waiting list," Drew
concluded.
