# No guest professors until spring quarter

### HARA LEVY Staff writer 
The Guest Professorship Bureau
(GPB) does not expect to have a
guest professor teach until spring
quarter because of rules changes re
quired in the wake of the bureau's
controversial handling of Guest
Prof. Paul "Pete" McCloskey's
course last spring.
GPB Co-director Nate Brostrom
said the rules changes which will be
discussed at the next senate
meeting "will insure that the Mc-

Closkey incident will not happen
again and that it will eliminate any
police powers in the formulation of
the courses."
The controversy last spring cen
tered around then GPB chairman
Seth Linfield's alleged efforts to
control portions of McCloskey's
reading list. McCloskey, whose
strong stands in Congress on Ameri
can policy to Israel angered many
American Jews, charged I infield was
motivated by reverse "anti-
Semitism. '
Following a political science de
partment review of the GPB's han
dling of the McCloskey course,
Provost Albert Hastorf warned the
ASSU Senate that academic credit
will not be granted for future guest
professor classes unless the GPB's
bylaws are changed.
In the political science depart
ment's report, professors David
Danelski, Robert Horn and Heinz
Eulau said the GPB and the Council
of Presidents "went beyond the
traditional limits of student partici
pation in instructional matters and
in the process abridged academic
freedom."
lirostrom said he expects the
bylaws and legislation to be passed

by the senate committee at the next
senate committee meeting, "unless
there is strong opposition to the
new legislation."
Senate Chair Jud jagadish said the
revision in the GPB bylaws involves
"insuring the academic integrity
while giving academic freedom."
According to Jagadish, "they have
been negotiating with the University
for the past month or longer to
come up with a mutually acceptable
set of guidelines/bylaws to govern
the GPB."
But )agadish said that before the
GPB will regain control it wants to
be ensured that the University will
establish a grievance committee that
would handle any difficulties that
may arise.
While the GPB will not sponsor
any courses until spring quarter, the

Bureau does hope to bring guests
here for "significantly longer than a
day" before that time.
The proposed rules changes also
include provisions that will decrease
the time commitment on the part of
the guest professors so the GPB can
bring guests here for a short time.
Karol Watson, a member of the
COP, said the change is "only a
short term revision to get speakers
here."
One of the reasons behind this
particular revision is to allow two
current incapacitated bureaus — the
Speaker's Bureau and the GPB — to
invite prospective guest lectures
and speakers.
The Speakers Bureau was not on
the fee assessment ballot and did
not get any money for this year.
