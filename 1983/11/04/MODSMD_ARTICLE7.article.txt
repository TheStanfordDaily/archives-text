Arafat stronghold attacked
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian-backed forces
opposed to Yasser Arafat launched a major
artillery and tank offensive early yesterday
against the PLO leader's last stronghold in
Lebanon, the two Palestinian refugee camps
just north of the port city of Tripoli.
At least 50 Palestinians in the camps and
Lebanese in Tripoli were killed and more
than 200 wounded in the attack, which con
tinued into the night, according to Lebanese
authorities. The chief targets were the
Baadawi camp, where Arafat has his Palestine
Liberation Organization headquarters, and

the nearby Nahr al Bario camp, which to
gether house more than 25,000 Palestinian
refugees.
The Palestine Liberation Organization,
which has an estimated 5000 fighters loyal to
Arafat in the Tripoli area, charged in state
ments from Tripoli that it was being attacked
by a joint Syrian-led force of Syrian and
Libyan troops and a variety of Palestinian
groups opposed to Arafat.
Arafat sent appeals to Arab and nonaligned
heads of state for support to avoid a new
"massacre" of Palestinians. "We are facing a
major offensive. We are surrounded on all
sides," he told reporters, and he called on
Syrian President Hafez Assad, who expelled
him from Syria earlier this year, to
"personally intervene" to stop the attack.

Senate votes aid for contras
Washington — The Senate yesterday ap
proved continued U.S. financial aid to guer
rillas fighting Nicaragua's leftist government,
passing the controversial measure in a unani
mous voice vote after only perfunctory
debate.
But Democratic opponents of the officially
secret program said the real fight over its fun
ding would come in a conference with the
House of Representatives, which voted last
month to cut off the aid.
The Democrats did not try to block the bill
in the Republican-controlled Senate because
it was clear that it would pass easily.
