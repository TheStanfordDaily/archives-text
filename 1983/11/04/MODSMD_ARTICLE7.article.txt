Arafat stronghold attacked
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian-backed forces
opposed to Yasser Arafat launched a major
artillery and tank offensive early yesterday
against the PLO leader's last stronghold in
Lebanon, the two Palestinian refugee camps
just north of the port city of Tripoli.
At least 50 Palestinians in the camps and
Lebanese in Tripoli were killed and more
than 200 wounded in the attack, which con
tinued into the night, according to Lebanese
authorities. The chief targets were the
Baadawi camp, where Arafat has his Palestine
Liberation Organization headquarters, and

the nearby Nahr al Bario camp, which to
gether house more than 25,000 Palestinian
refugees.
The Palestine Liberation Organization,
which has an estimated 5000 fighters loyal to
Arafat in the Tripoli area, charged in state
ments from Tripoli that it was being attacked
by a joint Syrian-led force of Syrian and
Libyan troops and a variety of Palestinian
groups opposed to Arafat.
Arafat sent appeals to Arab and nonaligned
heads of state for support to avoid a new
"massacre" of Palestinians. "We are facing a
major offensive. We are surrounded on all
sides," he told reporters, and he called on
Syrian President Hafez Assad, who expelled
him from Syria earlier this year, to
"personally intervene" to stop the attack.

Senate votes aid for contras
Washington — The Senate yesterday ap
proved continued U.S. financial aid to guer
rillas fighting Nicaragua's leftist government,
passing the controversial measure in a unani
mous voice vote after only perfunctory
debate.
But Democratic opponents of the officially
secret program said the real fight over its fun
ding would come in a conference with the
House of Representatives, which voted last
month to cut off the aid.
The Democrats did not try to block the bill
in the Republican-controlled Senate because
it was clear that it would pass easily.
"I am a political realist," Sen. Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt.), a leading opponent ot the covert aid, said "I
can count votes."
Leahy and other senators said they would
attempt to work out a compromise with the
Democratic-controlled House that would keep some
U.S. money flowing to the Nicaraguan rebels, but
under tighter controls.
Soviet sub adrift in Atlantic
Washington — A disabled Soviet nuclear sub
marine is floundering on the surface of the Atlantic
between Bermuda and South Carolina, barely
moving forward and apparently waiting for help,
Pentagon officials said yesterday.
The unexpected appearance of the Victor 111-
class submarine in waters where Soviet subs nor
mally do not surface has provided a useful intelli
gence opportunity for the U.S. military and is an
other embarrassment for the Soviet submarine pro
gram, which has suffered several well-publicized
mishaps.
Pentagon officials said that Navy P-3 Orion patrol
planes spotted a submarine support ship steaming
from Cuba toward the stricken vessel yesterday af
ternoon, and a Soviet ACI intelligence ship has
joined the submarine. The Don-class support ship
may attempt to repair the sub at sea or tow it to
Cuba, the officials said.
Reagan sees no new invasions
Washington — President Reagan, strongly object
ing to calling the Crenadian operation an
"invasion," said yesterday that he did not foresee
any other U.S. invasion "on the horizon," although
he would order the same military action again under
similar circumstances.
"This was a rescue mission," said the president,
who had referred to it himself as an invasion when
he first announced the action Oct. 25.
Reagan became angry during a brief press confer
ence when a reporter noted that some critics of the
invasion had contended there was no difference be
tween what the United States had done in Grenada
and what the Soviets did while invading Afghanistan
in 1979. "Oh, for heaven sakes," he snapped.
Israeli post bombed
Tel Aviv, Israel — A powerful explosion ripped
through two buildings at an Israeli army compound
in southern Lebanon this morning, the Israeli mili
tary command said. Lebanon's state radio said there
were dozens of casualties.
The Israeli command gave no details on casualties,
but an army spokesman said the road along the
Mediterranean coast was closed and resuce opera
tions were being carried out.
The radio quoted initial police reports from Tyre
as saying a bomb-laden car crashed through a
barbed wire fence and detonated at the entrance to
the yellow L-shaped building, reducing the two
floors to a pile of rubble.
Lebanese reach compromise
Geneva, Switzerland — Lebanon's national recon
ciliation conference yesterday empowered Presi
dent Amin Gemayel to re-open negotiations over
the May 17 Lebanese-Israeli withdrawal accord "with

the view of ending the Israeli occupation' of south
ern Lebanon.
Atter two days of heated debate over the contro
versial agreement, the nine Moslem and Christian
leaders attending the historic conference here
reached a compromise allowing Gemayel time to go
to Washington and Arab capitals to explore possible
changes in or alternatives to the accord.
It was not immediately known when the Lebanese
president would leave on his trip, or when the con
ference will tackle the critical issues of how to dis
tribute political power among Lebanon's warring
factions.
Rumsfeld appointed Mideast envoy

South Africa approves charter
Johannesburg, South Africa — South Africa took its
first step away from exclusive white rule in 35 years
yesterday, giving "a thunderous yes" to a new con
stitution that sets up separate chambers of Parlia
ment for Asians and people of mixed race.
Although whites voted nearly 2-1 for the charter,

denial of political rights to the more than 21 million
blacks.

rillas fighting Nicaragua's leftist government,
passing the controversial measure in a unani
mous voice vote after only perfunctory
debate.
But Democratic opponents of the officially
secret program said the real fight over its fun
ding would come in a conference with the
House of Representatives, which voted last
month to cut off the aid.
The Democrats did not try to block the bill
in the Republican-controlled Senate because
it was clear that it would pass easily.
"I am a political realist," Sen. Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt.), a leading opponent ot the covert aid, said "I
can count votes."
Leahy and other senators said they would
attempt to work out a compromise with the
Democratic-controlled House that would keep some
U.S. money flowing to the Nicaraguan rebels, but
under tighter controls.
Soviet sub adrift in Atlantic
Washington — A disabled Soviet nuclear sub
marine is floundering on the surface of the Atlantic
between Bermuda and South Carolina, barely
moving forward and apparently waiting for help,
Pentagon officials said yesterday.
The unexpected appearance of the Victor 111-
class submarine in waters where Soviet subs nor
mally do not surface has provided a useful intelli
gence opportunity for the U.S. military and is an
other embarrassment for the Soviet submarine pro
gram, which has suffered several well-publicized
mishaps.
Pentagon officials said that Navy P-3 Orion patrol
planes spotted a submarine support ship steaming
from Cuba toward the stricken vessel yesterday af
ternoon, and a Soviet ACI intelligence ship has
joined the submarine. The Don-class support ship
may attempt to repair the sub at sea or tow it to
Cuba, the officials said.
Reagan sees no new invasions
Washington — President Reagan, strongly object
ing to calling the Crenadian operation an
"invasion," said yesterday that he did not foresee
any other U.S. invasion "on the horizon," although
he would order the same military action again under
similar circumstances.
"This was a rescue mission," said the president,
who had referred to it himself as an invasion when
he first announced the action Oct. 25.
Reagan became angry during a brief press confer
ence when a reporter noted that some critics of the
invasion had contended there was no difference be
tween what the United States had done in Grenada
and what the Soviets did while invading Afghanistan
in 1979. "Oh, for heaven sakes," he snapped.

were dozens of casualties.
The Israeli command gave no details on casualties,
but an army spokesman said the road along the
Mediterranean coast was closed and resuce opera

barbed wire fence and detonated at the entrance to
the yellow L-shaped building, reducing the two
floors to a pile of rubble.

It was not immediately known when the Lebanese
president would leave on his trip, or when the con
ference will tackle the critical issues of how to dis
tribute political power among Lebanon's warring

Arafat stronghold attacked
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian-backed forces
opposed to Yasser Arafat launched a major
artillery and tank offensive early yesterday
against the PLO leader's last stronghold in
Lebanon, the two Palestinian refugee camps
just north of the port city of Tripoli.
At least 50 Palestinians in the camps and
Lebanese in Tripoli were killed and more
than 200 wounded in the attack, which con
tinued into the night, according to Lebanese
authorities. The chief targets were the
Baadawi camp, where Arafat has his Palestine
Liberation Organization headquarters, and

the nearby Nahr al Bario camp, which to
gether house more than 25,000 Palestinian
refugees.
The Palestine Liberation Organization,
which has an estimated 5000 fighters loyal to
Arafat in the Tripoli area, charged in state
ments from Tripoli that it was being attacked
by a joint Syrian-led force of Syrian and
Libyan troops and a variety of Palestinian
groups opposed to Arafat.
Arafat sent appeals to Arab and nonaligned
heads of state for support to avoid a new
"massacre" of Palestinians. "We are facing a
major offensive. We are surrounded on all
sides," he told reporters, and he called on
Syrian President Hafez Assad, who expelled
him from Syria earlier this year, to
"personally intervene" to stop the attack.
