## Socialist government in Spain is 'moderate,' professor says 
### CLINT HIGHFILL 
Spain's socialist govern
ment "gets a passing grade"
in dealing with Spain's eco
nomic problems, an assistant
professor of economics told
approximately 65 people at the
Bechtel International Center
yesterday.
lose Vinals, a graduate of
the University of Valencia in
Spain, said in his address
"Spain Under Socialism: Is it
Working?," that he "didn't
think any other government
could do better."
According to Vinals, a dis
tinction should be made be
tween a Socialist government
and a government run by a
Socialist party. Spain, he em
phasized, is a version of the
latter.
The Socialists, in their first
year, have not undertaken a
major program to nationalize
Spain's banks or industries.

Nor have they attempted to
impose a national economic
plan.
In fact, Vinals said, their
policies so moderate that
"Walter Mondale would be
happy to sign many of the
Socialists' bills."
Inflation and high un
employment were two major
problems faced by the
Socialists when they took of
fice in 1982. Rising wages and
declining productivity forced a
14 percent inflation rate on
Spain.
The high labor costs,
coupled with stiff foreign
competition, also led to the
destruction of companies and
then jobs. The new govern
ment faced a 16.5 percent un
employment rate when it took
office.
The situation was so serious
that, Vinals said, "pragmatism

was put ahead of dogmatism."
The Socialists have worked
with labor and business to
moderate wages. In addition,
they have attempted to make
the labor market more flexible
by making it easier for busi
nesses to fire workers.
Vinals felt that this ap
proach, unpopular in the
short term, was the best long
range solution for Spain.
Another significant issue for
the Socialists, according to
Vinals, was how to "recover
from de-industrialization" that
took place in the 19705.
Rather than adopt its cam
paign promise to "create
800,000 new jobs," the
Socialist government has tried
to "decrease emphasis on in
dustries such as steel and
shipbuilding" and divert the
Spanish economy to high
technology.
