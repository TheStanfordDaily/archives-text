A position at the helm of
the ASSU hierarchy means
more than academic and
leadership opportunity — it
can be lucrative as well.
At $8900 a year, ASSU
Student Financial Manager
Mindy Basham holds the
most lucrative ASSU post.
She said her salary breaks
down to approximately
$4.70 an hour for 35 to 40
hours per week.
Basham listed 37 students
on the ASSU payroll, in
cluding members of
various boards, bureaus
and special projects.
The four Council of Presi
dents members — Vinnie
Freda, Peter Spivack, Su
Uhland and Karol Watson
— each earn $1189 a quar

ter with the opportunity to
make $4400 a year tor ser
vice over the summer. Sen
ate Chair Jug Jagadish earns
the same amount, accor
ding to Basham.
The deputy senate chair
is paid $900 tor nine
months, while senators and
interns receive no salary.
Managers of certain proj
ects bring up the rear of the
ASSU pay scale with
monthly incomes
from $160 to $210.
Spivack noted that while
his ASSU salary may appear
to be considerable, it is all
reinvested into his tuition
plan.
COP members spend 4(
hours a week between
meetings and office bust
ness at the ASSU, Spivack
said.
