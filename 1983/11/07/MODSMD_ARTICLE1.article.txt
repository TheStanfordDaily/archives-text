# Stanford South
## 
### 
Putting off midterm study
ing, hundreds of Stanford
rooters took a roadtrip to
Los Angeles to watch the
Cardinal-USC game this
weekend. The Kettleman
City McDonald's served as
an "oasis" for hungry stu
dents (left). After the game,
four-year-old Ryan Ralph,
the nephew of a Stanford
Band drummer, debuted in
the drumming section. Ryan,
class of 2001, soloed bril
liantly during "Only The
Beginning." Despite the 30-
7 loss, Stanford fans were
the last to leave the Los An
geles Memorial Coliseum.
