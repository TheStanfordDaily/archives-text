## The 						Stanford Daily On the road again 
### 
The rally cry betrays shades of John Belushi
in Animal House. It's 2 a.m. on a Thursday
night, the end of a long week. You're sitting
with your friends, contemplating another
weekend of routine fraternity parties and the
inescapable Meyer Library. Then, in a magical
sort of way, that single word is uttered and all
eyes light up.
Roadtrip.
The car is hurriedly packed and you're on the
highway before anyone can give it that danger
ous, calculated second thought. It doesn't mat
ter where you go — it doesn't even have to be
spontaneous — just so long as you get away.
The roadtrip epitomizes classic collegiate
lifestyle. The whimsical, free-and-easy, get-up
and-go attitude are hallmarks of the college
student — or so we all like to believe. Yet the
roadtrip serves a purpose beyond an excuse to
spend a weekend dining at highway-side Carl's
Juniors; it provides an opportunity to share
memorable experiences away from
campus — and yes, to run away from the ten
sions of school, if only for a few days.
Several hundred Stanford students em
barked on the 400-mile trek to Los Angeles this
past weekend to see what was by generous ac
counts a lackluster football game (highlighted
only by a magnificent half-time show). Yet for
many the game was just an excuse to visit
smoggy Southern California, a chance to get

away. And the gas station directions, the
music-tilled drive, the mooched meals and the
sleeping-bagged nights were all just part of the
experience.
Stanford's location is ideal for those who are
afflicted with the itch to trip. Autumn quarter
offers football weekends across the West
Coast, winter brings snow and skiing to the
Sierra Nevadas and spring beckons us to the
beaches. Meanwhile, Napa Valley wine tasting,
scenic coastal excursions, Nevada gambling,
rugged (and not-so-rugged) camping and the
Redwoods of the north are year-round attrac
tions. A mere trip to the city summons those
with only a few hours to spare.
Some may argue that we are romanticizing
what is nothing more than too many hours on
the road and too few hours of sleep. But it's all
in the way you look at things. Don't perceive a
roadtrip as a weekend of lost studying; see it as
one of gained experience. When you look back
at your "college years" you'll remember those
trips to L.A. before those physics problem sets.
As much as we all love the Farm, rigor mortis
can set in. The cure to those campus blues lies
in a full tank of gas, an FM radio and a group of
friends all bent on the same goal — good times
on the road. Sometimes schoolwork has to
take a back seat. Sometimes you gotta say,
"What the heck."
