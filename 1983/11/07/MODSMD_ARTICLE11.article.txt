# Are you asking questions?

I recently read about a study at
UC-Berkeley investigating the atti
tudes and values of today's young
people. I was happy to see that
people our age today are more re
sponsible and respectful of others
than they were 15 years ago.
However, I was troubled to see that,
along with these positive changes,
there had been one notably dis
couraging development: that young
people today are less inclined to
question the status quo than they
were in the late 19605.
This study confirmed a suspicion I
have been harboring ever since I've
been at Stanford. People here seem
to assume that what is, is as it should
be, and will remain so indefinitely.
Like the T-shirt says, the basic phi
losophy of many students here
seems to be work, study, get rich.
When you're doing these things all
the time, it's hard to be bothered
with such unproductive pursuits as
the questioning of capitalism or the
American political system or the
existence of God. Yet, for your own
benefit, and especially for the bene
fit of your world, you should ask
questions and of society.
Ask yourself, for instance, why
you're studying what you're study

ing. Is it because you love it and it
makes your head spin with the new
perspectives on the world it gives
you? Or is it because it
"guarantees" you a good job?
And about that "good" job. (As
any Stanford undergraduate will tell
you, there are only three: doctor,
lawyer and businessman.) Do you
seek it because it is what you truly
want to do or because it
"guarantees" you prestige and a six
figure income for the rest of your
life? If you're lucky, it does both. If
you're like the rest of us, you may
have to make a choice between
comfort and self-fulfillment.
Asking questions of society is at
least as important as asking ques
tions of yourself, for your answers
to the some will both affect and
reflect your answers to the others. Is
capitalism the most equitable, effi
cient socioeconomic system possi
ble? Should lobbies and Political Ac
tion Committees play such a large
role in our national government?
Why are U.S. Marines in Lebanon,
Honduras and Grenada? Why are 48
percent of black teenagers un
employed? Can we afford to have
more nuclear missiles in Western
Europe?

If we as a generation remain an
unquestioning, compliant, inert
human mass, we can at the very
least expect a slowdown of social
progress. For all movements of so
cial progress have begun with a
questioning of that period's status
quo. Slavery would have continued
indefinitely if some people hadn't
called into question its legitimacy.
The working class of this country
would not have realized the eco
nomic gains it has if it hadn't chal
lenged the right of the state to out
law unions. Etcetera.
More ominously, if we do not
question the policies of those who
wield power — in this country and
throughout the world — we are
tacitly approving of them. And if we
do not question their actions every
step of the way, we may end up in a
situation which is beyond our con
trol and which we do not like. We
will have nothing to bring the situa
tion on, perhaps, but we will have
done nothing to prevent it, either.
Don't be a voiceless spectator of
the forward march of history; ask
questions and become a part of it.
