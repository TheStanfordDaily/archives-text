# Viewpoint: Stanford Community Against Reagan University
## Kennedy's flawed 'compromise' 
### 
University President Donald Kennedy recently an
nounced to the Faculty Senate a "compromise" regard
ing the proposed Reagan complex which he hopes can
bridge two diametrically opposed views of the role of a
great university in society. But his compromise dodges
the fundamental issue. It also highlights how through
out the Hoover-Reagan controversy the faculty has
been patted on the head and students have been
shown to exits.
While Kennedy deserves credit for recognizing that
any policy center should not become an expansion of
the Hoover Institution and that a museum, to glorify a
politician would have "little or no academic value," the
Kennedy "compromise" still refuses to address the
fundamental question: Is an institution which
propagandizes for a particular ideology and which the
media and even President Reagan call "the leading con
servative think-tank in America," compatible with a
university whose professed purpose is the non
partisan, objective search for the truth?
If the answer is "no," as we maintain, then why stand
behind a proposal that further identifies this University
with the right-wing of the Republican Party? Why com
mit Stanford to a Reagan center for public affairs before
the promised review and reassessment of the Stanford-
Hoover relationship has been carried out? Why railroad
the Reagan complex through less than three years into
Reagan's first term, in the midst of his campaign for re
election? Indeed, why make any decision while virtual
ly excluding students from any meaningful role in the
"process"?
The Kennedy "compromise" leaves all these ques
tions unanswered, and as such, may end up giving
Hoover if not everything it asked for, then certainly
everything it planned to get. Was this s the deal worked
out months ago?
Consider this likely scenario: The Board of Trustees,
its membership too cautious to live up to the Founding
Grant of Stanford University which requires "that the
University shall forever be kept out of politics," adopts
the Kennedy compromise without addressing the fun
damental question about F-loover's political mission
and the role of the University in society. No trustees
join a faculty-student lawsuit to stop construction of
the complex and it languishes under an avalanche of le
gal papers shovelled by Stanford's lawyers.
The Reagan library is built, with a museum Kennedy
described as "a modest facility, structurally part of the
library." President Reagan stops by to dedicate the
complex, to thank Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell
for again duping a great University into fronting for the
legitimization of a narrow ideology, and to deposit
"memorabilia" from his military excursions, education
budget cuts, and so on.
The Reagan center tor public affairs opens soon after.
And true to the vague "compromise" of 1983, the
Reagan center remains formally under control of the
University. But who really will control the policy center
is not difficult to predict.
Hoover and its champions are not going to bust their
behinds to raise $65 million without substantial Hoover
representation on the center's board of directors and
appointments committees.

Thus, the shell game that Campbell now plays with
appointments he labels "senior fellows" will spread to
the new center. The most highly qualitied conservative
academics will be recommended tor appointment as
Reagan fellows. This will free up more slots for th<
same sort of partisan polemicists who now dominate
the ranks of senior research fellows and research fel
lows at Hoover.
Who could question the appointment of Reagan fol
lows with the qualifications of a Milton Friedman or
George Stigler? And since not even Stanford's presi
dent has the power to stop the political discrimination
in hiring that is blatantly practiced by Hoover, ho
tower of power's expansion will have been quietly ac
complished.
A tew faculty will scream, "We've been duped!' But
they will be discredited by the Hoover public relations
staff as "nightriders and witch hunters" who engage in
"academic terrorism" (to quote a recent Wall Street
Journal editorial distributed by Hoover and its sympa
thizers.
This scenario need not come true if the Stantord
community can pull together and remind the trustees
that the integrity of the University has been placed in
their hands. Living up to their duty under the Founding
Grant to remain "free from any possible political or
partisan influence" means saying no to the big money
boys who tie political strings to their checkbooks.
Stanford owes it to the other great universities to
stop the disastrous precedent of donors expecting poli
tical returns on their investments in Stanford. The
academy must remain inviolate, like the church, else
every institution in society will be permeated by politics
and the state.
The White House has already dragged Stanford
deeper into electoral politics. The Republican Senato
rial Campaign Committee has launched a national
fund-raising campaign. And guess what comes with a
$120 contribution to the Republican Party? Your name
engraved on a scroll of patriotic Americans that Reagan
will ceremoniously and permanently deposit with his
presidential papers into the library shrine at Stanford.
Great.
Hoover and Reagan's re-election campaign are the
sole beneficiaries of a hasty decision. Stanford alone
bears the stigma of partisanship and of trampling "due
process" requested by students and faculty.
Simply put, the Stanford community gains nothing
from a decision made:
• before Hoover's relationship to the University has
been reassessed (as promised last spring);
• before the 1984 elections are over (and Reagan is no
longer a political candidate);
• before student opinions have been given fair repre
sentation, in public hearings; and
• before Kennedy and the trustees offer explicit,
public guarantees that Hoover will have absolutley no
influence over appointments to the proposed policy
center.

The White House has already dragged Stanford
deeper into electoral politics. The Republican Senato
rial Campaign Committee has launched a national
fund-raising campaign. And guess what comes with a
$120 contribution to the Republican Party? Your name
engraved on a scroll of patriotic Americans that Reagan
will ceremoniously and permanently deposit with his
presidential papers into the library shrine at Stanford.
Great.
Hoover and Reagan's re-election campaign are the
sole beneficiaries of a hasty decision. Stanford alone
bears the stigma of partisanship and of trampling "due
process" requested by students and faculty.
Simply put, the Stanford community gains nothing
from a decision made:
• before Hoover's relationship to the University has
been reassessed (as promised last spring);
• before the 1984 elections are over (and Reagan is no
longer a political candidate);
• before student opinions have been given fair repre
sentation, in public hearings; and
• before Kennedy and the trustees offer explicit,
public guarantees that Hoover will have absolutley no
influence over appointments to the proposed policy
center.

Stanford Community Against Reagan University.)
University President Donald Kennedy recently an
nounced to the Faculty Senate a "compromise" regard
ing the proposed Reagan complex which he hopes can
bridge two diametrically opposed views of the role of a
great university in society. But his compromise dodges
the fundamental issue. It also highlights how through
out the Hoover-Reagan controversy the faculty has
been patted on the head and students have been
shown to exits.
While Kennedy deserves credit for recognizing that
any policy center should not become an expansion of
the Hoover Institution and that a museum, to glorify a
politician would have "little or no academic value," the
Kennedy "compromise" still refuses to address the
fundamental question: Is an institution which
propagandizes for a particular ideology and which the
media and even President Reagan call "the leading con
servative think-tank in America," compatible with a
university whose professed purpose is the non
partisan, objective search for the truth?
If the answer is "no," as we maintain, then why stand
behind a proposal that further identifies this University
with the right-wing of the Republican Party? Why com
mit Stanford to a Reagan center for public affairs before
the promised review and reassessment of the Stanford-
Hoover relationship has been carried out? Why railroad
the Reagan complex through less than three years into
Reagan's first term, in the midst of his campaign for re
election? Indeed, why make any decision while virtual
ly excluding students from any meaningful role in the
"process"?
The Kennedy "compromise" leaves all these ques
tions unanswered, and as such, may end up giving
Hoover if not everything it asked for, then certainly
everything it planned to get. Was this s the deal worked
out months ago?
Consider this likely scenario: The Board of Trustees,
its membership too cautious to live up to the Founding
Grant of Stanford University which requires "that the
University shall forever be kept out of politics," adopts
the Kennedy compromise without addressing the fun
damental question about F-loover's political mission
and the role of the University in society. No trustees
join a faculty-student lawsuit to stop construction of
the complex and it languishes under an avalanche of le
gal papers shovelled by Stanford's lawyers.
The Reagan library is built, with a museum Kennedy
described as "a modest facility, structurally part of the
library." President Reagan stops by to dedicate the
complex, to thank Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell
for again duping a great University into fronting for the
legitimization of a narrow ideology, and to deposit
"memorabilia" from his military excursions, education
budget cuts, and so on.
The Reagan center tor public affairs opens soon after.
And true to the vague "compromise" of 1983, the
Reagan center remains formally under control of the
University. But who really will control the policy center
is not difficult to predict.
Hoover and its champions are not going to bust their
behinds to raise $65 million without substantial Hoover
representation on the center's board of directors and
appointments committees.

Thus, the shell game that Campbell now plays with
appointments he labels "senior fellows" will spread to
the new center. The most highly qualitied conservative
academics will be recommended tor appointment as
Reagan fellows. This will free up more slots for th<
same sort of partisan polemicists who now dominate
the ranks of senior research fellows and research fel
lows at Hoover.
Who could question the appointment of Reagan fol
lows with the qualifications of a Milton Friedman or
George Stigler? And since not even Stanford's presi
dent has the power to stop the political discrimination
in hiring that is blatantly practiced by Hoover, ho
tower of power's expansion will have been quietly ac
complished.
A tew faculty will scream, "We've been duped!' But
they will be discredited by the Hoover public relations
staff as "nightriders and witch hunters" who engage in
"academic terrorism" (to quote a recent Wall Street
Journal editorial distributed by Hoover and its sympa
thizers.
This scenario need not come true if the Stantord
community can pull together and remind the trustees
that the integrity of the University has been placed in
their hands. Living up to their duty under the Founding
Grant to remain "free from any possible political or
partisan influence" means saying no to the big money
boys who tie political strings to their checkbooks.
Stanford owes it to the other great universities to
stop the disastrous precedent of donors expecting poli
tical returns on their investments in Stanford. The
academy must remain inviolate, like the church, else
every institution in society will be permeated by politics
and the state.
