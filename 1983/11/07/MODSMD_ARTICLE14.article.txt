Taiwan's freedom
It is ironic how trivial matters,
such as searching through old
issues of The Daily for an ice cream
coupon, can lead one to encounter
issues of a nature more grave and
disquieting. I was struck by great
astonishment and disbelief when
my eyes caught sight of an an
nouncement in Oct. 11's Daily:
"Ftappy Birthday," it read, "72
Years of the Republic of China."
As a second generation
Taiwanese-American proud of my
heritage and identity, I feel deeply
disturbed if not offended by what
seems to be deliberate affront by
the Chinese Cultural Association of
Stanford, the party sponsoring the
ad. To put it simply, it angers me to
even think that the establishment of
a government as corrupt, hypocriti
cal and unjust as the late Chiang
Kai-Shek's National Chinese regime
be legitimately recognized today,
never mind a cause worthy of
celebration. By now, virtually the
entire world accepts the fact that
there is one China and one Taiwan.
And unfortunately, it is precisely
due to a few individuals who cling
to outdated ideologies in a desper
ate attempt to preserve their self
interests — who stubbornly insist
that Taiwan be the Republic of
China — that many people in this
country are unaware of the sad
state of affairs in Taiwan.
Many people do not know, for
example, that Taiwan suffers under
the longest martial rule ever in
modern history — so far, 34 years

under the Nationalist Chinese.
Thinking that the 85 percent native
Taiwanese on the island live happily
and peacefully under this regime,
many people are not aware of the
injustice and oppression of basic
human rights that pervade the
social, economic , cultural and
especially political spheres of
Taiwan.
On top ot all these internal prob
lems, Taiwan also is beset with
offers of reunification with China,
which also claims sovereignity of
the island. Hopes of self
determination and the Taiwanese
cause are at stake. Born and raised
in this nation where freedom and
democracy are real, not mere
slogans, I must speak out. Calling
Taiwan the "Republic of China" is
hardly a trivial matter of semantics,
for as of now, Taiwan's birthday is
yet to come.

The article entitled "Male profs
still far out number female faculty,"
(Daily, Oct. 31), presents rather
dismal statistics on the number of
male and female faculty at this
university. Unfortunately, the ar
ticle discussed the issue from only a
faculty vantage. The article failed to
address the student's perspective:
The effect of this paucity of female
faculty on the student. Certain
effects are obvious. Female stu
dents have fewer role models to
identify with, and fewer chances to

affirm their myths that women can
enter into any profession they
desire. Male students have less
opportunity to dispel their
stereotypes of women in the home.
For the female undergraduate, an
academic or professional career is
mythology. There are rumors of
female heroines, women doctors,
lawyers and even women
astronauts, like Stanford's own

Sally Ride, yet 95 percent of Stan
ford professors are male. Some
women graduate without taking a
single course from a female profes
sor.
Yet the most disturbing implica
tion of this article is the fact that
Stanford University, exemplar of
excellence in higher education,
leader in academia, has such a
discouraging number of female

faculty (118 out of 1266). The
statistical situation can only be
worse at other educational institu
tions.
This problem of underrepresenta
tion is not unique to female stu
dents. Black, Chicano and Oriental
students face underrepresentation.
Yet these minority groups are also
underrepresented as a student

body, whereas female students art'
as plentiful as male students.
Hence, while the female student
feels the effects of this inequality,
she is less inclined to perceive the
situation as unequal. With so many
female teammates, women fail to
realize why they feel as though they
are playing on foreign turf.

Yet the most disturbing implica
tion of this article is the fact that
Stanford University, exemplar of
excellence in higher education,
leader in academia, has such a
discouraging number of female

faculty (118 out of 1266). The
statistical situation can only be
worse at other educational institu
tions.
This problem of underrepresenta
tion is not unique to female stu
dents. Black, Chicano and Oriental
students face underrepresentation.
Yet these minority groups are also
underrepresented as a student

body, whereas female students art'
as plentiful as male students.
Hence, while the female student
feels the effects of this inequality,
she is less inclined to perceive the
situation as unequal. With so many
female teammates, women fail to
realize why they feel as though they
are playing on foreign turf.
