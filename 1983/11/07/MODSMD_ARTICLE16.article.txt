# Professor's Commentary: Martin Anderson
## Balancing the budget: the next amendment? 
### 
Martin Anderson, a senior
fellow at the Hoover Instil
tion since 1971, took a leave of
absence in 1979 to serve a',
senior adviser in the Reagan
presidential campaign and was
assistant to President Reagan
for policy development until
March 1982. He has also served
as a research fellow at the Har
vard/MIT Center for Urban
Studies and a professor at Co
lumbia University. He has
published several books on nr.
ban renewal, welfare and
registration and the draft. An
derson is a member of the
president's Economic Policy
Advisory Board and is working
on a book dealing with long
range national economic
policy.
Why are we running triple
digit billion dollar deficits
when everyone knows that
large, sustained deficits will
lead to economic disaster? If
you run large enough deficits
for a long enough time, you
will generate fierce inflation
ary pressures that will drive up
the cost of living and interest
rates and ultimately damage
us all economically — espe
cially the poor and those iiving
on fixed incomes. Then why
don't we adopt responsible
tiseal and monetary policies
and balance the budget?
We don't because those
with the power to make those

decisions in Washington have
collectively decided — Repub
lican and Democrat alike —
that the political conse
quences of adopting policies
to bring spending in line with
revenue are more painful than
the policies they now follow.
Few people in Washington
take a balanced overview of
what is best for the country.
Most approach the budgeting
question with a clear bias that,
in their own minds, is
eminently defensible.
For those who are primarily
concerned with the social pro
grams that provide money and
services and goods to people

with relatively low incomes,
the sick and the elderly, the
issue is clear. The poor and
the sick and elderly are en
titled to whatever resources
are necessary to fund these
programs in an adequate,
comprehensive fashion.
For those whose major con
cern is national security, the
budget issue is also clear
given the enormous increase
in the military strength of the
Soviet Union and the men
tality of the Soviet rulers who
control that power, they see a
clear and present danger that
can only be diminished by a
sustained military buildup of
our own. In their view, unless
we can defend and protect our
society, there will be no social
programs to spend our money
on, and questions of tax rates
and deficits will be meaning
less.
For those who focus on
taxation, the answer also is
quite simple — if the level of
taxation becomes too high
and the degree of progres
sivity too steep, the incentive
of people to work, to save and
to invest is so diminished that
our entire economy begins to
falter. Productivity declines,
innovation virtually ends, in
flation rises, people lose their
jobs and government revenue
falls, widening the deficit. In
their view, a weak economy
makes it impossible to have
either a strong defense or ade

quate social programs.
For those whose concern is
fiscal responsibility, period,
the balanced budget out
weighs all other claims. Con
vinced that long-range deficits
can only lead to economic
weakness and stagnation and
decline, it is clear to them that
unless we begin to balance the
budget now and do it quickiy,
in the long run we will have to

We can say that politicians should be
wise enough to consider the future
and good enough to incur the short
run political cost. But in reality / a
vote for fiscal responsibility is a vote
for political suicide.

sharply increase taxes, slash
social programs and permit
our national security to
depend on the good will of
countries more militarily pow
erful than ourselves. We may
have unbalanced our budget
to achieve very important,
very desirable goals, but if
we continue to pursue our
goals by using this path, we
will sooner or later lose what
we now think more important.

Social progress, national se
curity, taxes and deficits. They
are all critically important and
intertwined. Given our cur
rent values and priorities,
there is no way we can elimi
nate the deficit and achieve all
our other goals. But it is also
true that if we do not eliminate
the deficit, we will also fail to
achieve those goals over a
longer period of time.

The fundamental problem is
that cutting spending for
defense and social programs
or increasing taxes all have im
mediate, very painful conse
quences. The consequences
of a large deficit are also pain
ful, but they are not immedi
ate. And the inclination of
decision-makers is to discount
anything that happens in the
future. When the future is
defined as sometime beyond

their next election, the dis
count is nearly total.
We can say that politicians
should be wise enough to
consider the future and good
enough to incur the short-run
political cost. But in reality, a
vote for fiscal responsibility is
a vote for political suicide.
The structure of economic
demands for social programs,
defense and the many other
interest groups in this country
has produced a fiscal
stalemate. Our political insti
tutions are unable to override
the combined political power
of special economic interests,
even though taking the na
tional interest point of view
would benefit more people
overall. But the current rules
of the political game make it
impossible
For years we have been
trying to change the rules of
the national economic policy
game, but the political forces
for spending have increased in
spite of new resolutions and
processes in both Congress
and the executive. The seed of
virtually all our economic
woes is simply that most of
our elected officials want to
spend more than the revenue
received from the taxes for
which they are willing to vote.
And so the taxing and spend
ing spiral continues — upward
— because within current go
vernment institutions there is
no way to prevent it.

This is why we must add to
our Constitution a provision
to require the federal govern
ment to balance the budget.
We need a provision that will
limit the amount the federal
government is allowed to
spend and to limit the share of
the gross national product that
can be taken in taxes. A so
phisticated constitutional
amendment that combined a
provision for tax limitation
with a balanced budget was
approved by the Senate Com
mittee on the Judiciary in 1981
and by the entire Senate in Au
gust 1982. Thirty-two states
now have passed a resolution
calling for a constitutional
convention on the question of
a balanced budget amend
ment, and national opinion
polls show that overwhelming
majorities favor balancing the
budget.
Changes or additions to our
Constitution should only be
contemplated when impor
tant, fundamental questions
cannot be dealt with in any
other way. Within current go
vernment institutions there is
no effective way to prevent ex
cessive government spending.
A constitutional amendment
to balance the budget and
limit spending, with the
proper safeguards for excep
tions in time of war, would go
a long way toward ensuring
the future economic
prosperity of this country.
