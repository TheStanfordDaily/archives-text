## On teaching and learning a special silent language 
### NANNETTE ARCHER 
There's one foreign lan
guage taught at Stanford that
has never been heard betore
— and never will.
It's American Sign Language
(ASL) and it's one of the lan
guages taught through the Lin
guistics Department's Special
Language Program.
The classes are taught by
Cathy Ransom, a graduate ot
San lose State who is herselt
deaf — and a three-time win
ner of the Quota International
Corporation s Deat Woman ot
the Year award.

Many said they plan to
use ASL in future careers.
Other students have personal
reasons for wanting to learn
ASL„ such as the desire to communi
cate with deaf or hard-of-hearing
friends or relations.

Classes at the beginning
level tocus primarily on build
ing a basic sign vocabulary
along with creating good ex
pressive and receptive skills.
Second- year classes include
an emphasis on deat aware
ness and deaf culture.
Like any other language
class, quizzes and tests are
routinely given to measure
students' comprehensive abil
ities. The classes meet twice a
week in lecture, with one
weekly supplementary sec
tion.
ASL classes were first taught
at Stanford in 1976, and their
enrollment has grown steadily
ever since. Currently, there
are about 40 students in the
two beginning classes.
Students give a variety of

reasons for wanting to study
ASL. Many say they plan to use
ASL in future careers such as
deat or handicapped educa
tion or medicine. Other stu
dents have personal reasons
for wanting to learn ASL, such
as the desire to communicate
with deat or hard-of-hearing
friends or relatives.
Still others are interested
because they say sign lan
guage offers something differ
ent, unique and challenging.
Another reason students
decide to try the class is
"because we kept hearing

how great the teacher was,
junior Scott Allen said.
Despite Ransom's inability to
speak directly to her students,
her expressive mannerisms
and quick sense of humor are
known to hold the attention of
an entire class.
Regardless of their diverse
reasons tor taking the class,
students' response to the
course has been enthusiastic
— so much *o that a group ot
students have combined to
form an otticial organization
called "Students tor Deaf
Awareness." The group strives
to become more involved with
deaf culture in the Bay Area
and also provides opportuni
ties for other students to learn
more about deatness and sign
language.
