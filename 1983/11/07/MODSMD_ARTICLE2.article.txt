# Sophomore program likely to end
## Seminars receive University review 
### MARC PEYSFR Staff writer 
As a result of extensive evaluation
by a trio of faculty committees, the
Freshman/Sophomore Seminar Pro
grams will receive an extensive over
haul next year, according to Carolvn
Lou gee, associate dean of
humanities and sciences.
The most extensive changes will
be in the sophomore program
which, if all goes according to plan,
will be slowly phased out over the
next few years and replaced by
department-sponsored programs.
Courses tor this new, departmen-
oriented program are still being
solicited, however, and the com
plete transition, Lougee says, will
not be made until there are suffi
cient classes to fill the needs of the
sophomores.
As they are now, the sophomore
seminars, according to Lougee, are
"just classes. There is not any way in
which they are tailored to soph
omores. There has been no careful
assessment of their needs."
She added that "the sophomore
year is a time tor exploration and I
think that sophomores need things
especially designed for them." The
new structure, she hopes, will pro
vide this necessary specialization.
Lougee worked to override a re
commendation by a review commit
tee of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies which would have
meant the disbanding of the sopho

more program altogether.
Next year, sophomore seminars
and department seminars will run
together.
Ihe changes planned for the
freshman program, although not as
extensive, will have considerable
impact on incoming students.
As of next year, most of the
classes will no longer fulfill the
writing requirement, and many of
them will have their unit loads
reduced from five to two or three.
The decision to cut the ties with
the writing requirement was made
because a number of instructors —
from both inside and outside the
Stanford teaching community
found it difficult to cover their sub
ject adequately while tea<hing
writing skills, according to members
of the Freshman/Sophomore Semi
nar Program.
Also, decreasing the units
Lougee says, will enable freshmen
who have a "highly structurec
schedule," to fit in the seminar
more easily.
