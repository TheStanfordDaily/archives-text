## Trojans bad, but Card is worse USC outsmarts Stanford 
### ADAM BERNS 
Los Angeles â€” The Stanford football
team was wearing the dunce cap at the
end of Saturday's 30-7 defeat at the hands
of USC in front of 50,806 at Los Angeles
Mt !morial Coliseum.
- While the Trojans may have become
meek, mild and just downright tame, USC
showed enough trickery to make the
casual observer think that it was wat( hing
one of Bill Walsh's teams here at Stan
ford.
On their first play of the game, Trojan
fullback Kennedy Pola took a pitch from
quarterback Sean Salisbury and lofted a
pass to wide-open split end Timmy Ware
for an easy touchdown, later in the half,
Pola took another pitch and threw the ball
back to Salisbury for a 7-yard gain, al
though the play was called back for illegal
motion.
Yet just as conspicuous as USC's big
play offense was its lack of a running
game. Midway through the second quar
ter, leading 21-0, the Trojans had just one
net yard running.
In fact, by the end of the first half, the
Trojans had rushed the ball for only 40
yards on 19 carries. Yet, USC had already
amassed 217 yards through the air by
halttime.
"I'm not sure why we had problems
(running the ball)," USC Coach Ted Toll
ner said following the game. "I knew the
size factor was somewhat even but we
couldn't move off the line of scrimmage.
They controlled the line in the first half,
and when we were able to run the ball in
the second half, we ran into penalty prob
lems."
Trojan quarterback Sean Salisbury
ended the afternoon having completed
12-of-17 passes for 207 yards before being

replaced by Tim Green in the fourth quar
ter. USC totalled 274 yards through the air
by the end of the game, and after getting
its running game going in the second hall
amassed 201 yards on the ground.
The Cardinal countered with just 83
yards on the ground and 187 through the
air, much of it coming in the fourth quar
ter with the game already out of reach.
This was not a typical Stanford-USC
game, nor has it been a particularly usual
year for either school. The loss dropped
Stanford to 1-8 while the Trojans evened
their record at 4-4-1.
"I'm disappointed that we lost," Stan
ford Coach Paul Wiggin said after the
game. "Of course, we didn't expect to
blow out the USC Trojans. USC put its act
together against Cal, and now they're the
same old team."
After the loss, the feeling among the
Stanford players was more despair than
anything else.
"This is an all-time low," Stanford
receiver Mike Tolliver said following the
game. "I'm at a loss to explain it. All we
can try to do is pick up the pieces."
The Stanford passing attack never got
going Saturday and this forced Wiggin to
start shuffling his quarterbacks. Starting
first with freshman John Paye, moving to
senior Steve Cottrell, switching back to
Paye and then returning to Cottrell.
"We were trying to get something
going," Wiggin said about his decision to
alternate the quarterbacks. "Paye was
shaky early in the game so we made the
change to get the offense moving. With
Steve Cottrell our offense didn't work so
we went back to Paye. Our effort was to
win the game. We couldn't get the
rhythm on offense nor could we get the
team moving. I don't know if we had
stayed with Paye we would have done any

better." What was particularly frustrat
ing for Stanford was that it was so effec
tive shutting down the USC running
game, yet the Trojans were able to pass
almost at will against a Cardinal team
ranked first in the Pacific-10 against the
pass coming into the game
After opening with its trick play, USC
came back to score another touchdown at
the start of the second quarter. Salisbury
hit receiver Malcolm Moore on a 52-yard
pass play in which Cardinal defensive
backs Dwain Hamilton and Darrell Gris
sum were both called for pass inter
ference, although it didn't matter be
cause Moore hung on to the pass.
The play brought the Trojans down to
the Stanford 1-yard line. Tailback Michael
Harper easily ran it in from the 1-yard line
for the USC score.
The Trojans, who had missed their ex
tra point try on their last score, opted to
go for two points and made it when Salis
bury completed a pass to tight end )oe
Cormier on a quick out pattern on the
right side of the end zone.
After the kickoff, Stanford promptly
turned the ball right back over to the
Trojans when quarterback Paye tried to
force a pass to Tolliver over the middle.
Linebacker Duane Bickett intercepted the
ball on the Stanford 31 and returned it to
the 12. A dead ball foul on Cardinal
receiver Eric Mullins moved it to the 7-
yard line.
USC was unable to move the ball,
however and on a fourth-and-one from
the Cardinal 3-yard line were unable to
make the first down when tailback Todd
Spencer was stopped for no gain.
But what Stanford taketh away, it giveth
right back.

and returned for a touchdown by Trojan linebacker Duane
Bickett.
