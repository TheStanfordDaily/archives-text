### TRASK LEONARD 
Freshman sensation Kathy
McCarthy fired a course
record 215 as she won the in
dividual championship at this
weekend's Stanford Women's
Fall Intercollegiate. The rest of
the golf team did not play as
spectacularly, however, and
finished the tournament tied
for fourth.
McCarthy had fine rounds
of 72-70-73 over the Stanford
Golf Course in setting the
record, yet outdistanced
second place Rita Moore from
Texas Christian by a single
stroke. Moore made matters
tight in the third round by
shooting a phenomonal 65, a
single-round course record by
four shots.
Nancy Brown from San )ose
State followed behind at 219 to
capture third place in the indi
vidual competition.
For the Cardinal, lulie Car
michael, who finished five
shots off the lead at last
week's Western Intercol
legiate, shot 2!4. Kathy kostas
and Diane Nixon each had a
236, while Kathy Nino fired a
240.
Stanford's team total of 913
strokes put them behind tirst
place Tulsa at 890 (a new team
record), TCU at 895, New
Mexico at 911 and tied with
Arizona State.
McCarthy's victory came as
no surprise to Coach Tim
Baldwin. McCarthy held a lead
at the Western Intercollegiate
last week after one round only

legiate this weekend while Stanford as a team finished in a tie for fourth place.
to see it disappear with seven
penalty strokes.
"Kathy and I discussed her
mental lapse at Rancho
Murieta, and we feel that they
are behind her now," Baldwin
said.
Barring any such difficulties,
McCarthy, who hails from
Fresno, looks forward to a suc
cessful career on the Farm. In
her first two tournaments as a
freshman, she has finished at
the top or very close to it, and
has played consistently since
arriving here. And with a clas
sic and very powerful swing,
she definitely has the skills to
excel in college golf, accor
ding to Baldwin.
McCarthy and the rest of the
Cardinal women have one
week to hone their games in
preparation for the United
States International Intercol
legiate, to be held Nov. 14-16
in San Diego.
For the men linksters, the
two-day Southwestern Inter
collegiate begins today at

Thousand Oaks.
