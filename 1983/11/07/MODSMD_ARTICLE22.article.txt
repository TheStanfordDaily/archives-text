# Trojans just horsin' around

Los Angeles — Don't look the Trojan horse
in the mouth.
That's the lesson the Stanford football
team learned in Saturday's 30-7 loss to USC
at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It
didn't take long to learn it, either.
On the Trojan's first play from scrimmage,
quarterback Sean Salisbury pitched right to
fullback Kennedy Pola, the lone setback be
hind a three tight end line. It looked like a
typical USC first play. Give the ball to one of
the running backs and watch him run.
Or at least that's what the Stanford
defense figured.
The Trojans were bluffing, however. In
stead of cutting up field behind USC's
massive offensive line as Stanford expected,
Pola stopped dead in his tracks, reared his
arm back and threw the ball.
About 35 yards down field was wide
receiver Timmie vVare. The closest Cardinal
defender was 20 yards up field. It was no
wonder that once Ware caught Pola's per
fect spiral he could have polka-ed his way
into the end zone to complete the 65-yard
touchdown play.
"It was a well-executed play," com
mented Stanford Head Coach Paul Wiggin
after the game. "They had a one-man back
field and we got caught in poor defensive
coverage, which left their man (Ware) wide
open. We had worked against that play but
USC had never shown it, and we weren't ex
pecting it."
Three minutes and four seconds into the
game and the Trojan horse, which only ap
pears after a USC score, was taking its vic
tory lap. The Trojans, a team known tor its
time-consuming, rushing-dominated drives,
had put together one of 65 yards on one play
in nine seconds.
"I had the feeling all week that we needed
something big early," USC Coach Ted Toll
ner said. "I thought they (Stanford) were a
better team than their record. I thought we
had to resort to some trickery in case we
weren't emotionally ready."
Besides giving the Trojans an early lead,
the play took the steam out of a Stanford
team that is 1-8 this season and 1-11 dating
back to last year.

' ;l' 11 tell you," Salisbury said after the
game, "when you jump off with a big play
like that, it helps your confidence and it
helped ours the rest of the way."
As if getting burned once wasn't bad
enough, the Card nearly gave up a second
touchdown on a similar trick play. This one
came early in the second quarter.
On third down and 8 yards to go from the
Stanford 10, Salisbury again gave it to Pola.
And again, Pola stopped and threw the ball
instead of running with it. This time,
however, the pass was back to the quarter
back Salisbury on the other side of the field.
Although Cardinal defenders Darrell Ciris
sum and Dwain Hamilton were called for
pass interference on the play, an illegal mo
tion penalty on USC nullified the fake
reverse pitch pass and the down was
replayed.
"Usually you hope one of two (trick plays)
works," Tollner said, "and that's what hap
pened today."
Asked if Pola was a high school quarter
back converted to fullback when he became
a Trojan, Tollner joked, "I don't know if he
played quarterback in high school, but
when we saw him play catch in practice, that
was enough for us."
As it turns out, Pola indeed played quar
terback in high school in Santa Ana, but only
his freshman season. As a senior at Mater
Dei High, though, he was used in the same
passing capacity as he was Saturday. "I
threw three passes (as a high school running
back)," Pola said. "One went for a touch
down, one got an interference penalty and
one was intercepted."
Tollner said the trick plays have been in
the Trojan playbook for most of the season
and he planned to use the first one — the
single back pitch pass — once before. "We
were going to use the pitch pass against
Arizona State (three weeks ago), but we got
behind so fast."
In that game, the Sun Devils came out of
the blocks smoking and led 27-0 before the
Trojan horse could bat an eyelash. Against
Stanford, however, Tollner wasted no time
before reaching into his bag of tricks.
"I decided (this week) if we got good field
position on the first play, we'd use it."
