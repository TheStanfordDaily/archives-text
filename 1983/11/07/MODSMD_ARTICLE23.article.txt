# Playoff chances are slim to none
## Card poloists lose two in L.A. 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Third-ranked UCLA and No. b USC
each exploded with four-goal third
quarter outbursts en route to 14-band
7-5 victories over the Stanford water
polo team last weekend, virtually as
suring that the Cardinal will be absent
from the NCAA championships for the
first time in 10years.
The defeats in Los Angeles left Stan
ford with an 11-11-3 season mark and
an 0-4 record in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. With only two games against No.
1 UC-Berkeley remaining, the Cardinal
is on the brink of its first losing season
since 1972.
The roadtrip began innocently
enough when Stanford and UCLA
went toe-to-toe in a tightly fought first
half that ended with the Bruins on top
5-4.
But much like the two clubs' first
meeting, it was suddenly a vastly dif
ferent ballgame once the whistle blew
to open the third quarter. The Bruins
used their depth and size to over
power the Cardinal with four scores

that increased their advanatage to 9-5
and UCLA never looked back.
True to his surname, Bruin junior
Scott Thornton proved to be a thorn in
the side of the Cardinal. He connected
on four goals and "single handedly"
shredded Stanford's stingy defense in
the second half, according to Card
Coach Dante Dettamanti.
Dettamanti succinctly described the
third period turnaround saying, "We
played a great first half and a lousy
second half." He seemed a bit per
plexed adding that the Cardinal "came
out fired up after halftime, but we just
made mistake after mistake in the
second half. Maybe it was just
'freshmanitis.' "
Whatever the illness, it did not go
away overnight. Even though Stanford
jumped to a 4-2 halftime lead against
USC the next day, the young Cardinal
again fell apart in the third period
drowning any hope a post-season bid.
"Maybe I need to change my
halftime speech, " joked Dettamanti.

"We were doing everything right in
the first half, but we made too many
mistakes (in the second half) and you
can't make that many mistakes to
win."
The Trojans swept to a 6-4 lead as the
Cardinal offense sputtered, wasting
some crucial six-on-five man advan
tages.
"We could've scored every time on
the six-on-fives," Dettamanti said,
"but we didn't get the ball to Imbo
(freshman David Imbernino) when he
was open. Guys were just trying to do
everything on their own. That was the
difference in the game."
Sophomore )aime Velez, the team's
leading goalscorer, tallied three times
and Imbernino added two goals for the
Cardinal, who find themselves in an
unusual situation this late in the
season.
"We're out of the (NCAA) picture,"
said Dettamanti. "The only thing left to
salvage our season is to beat Cal." In
this respect, the water polo team is not
alone.
