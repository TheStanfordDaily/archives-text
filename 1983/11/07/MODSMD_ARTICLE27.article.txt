An article in the Oct. 25 Daily in
correctly stated the opinion of G.
Gregory Smith, Apple Computer's
director of educational sales. The
story said that Smith admitted that
his company directs its sales toward
males and has no intention of
changing that policy, and quoted
Smith as saying, "We do not feel
women represent any great un
tapped audience." This incorrect in
formation was obtained from a June
issue of Business Week. An Apple
spokesman says that their ads are
not targeted toward an exclusively
male audience; the fact that males
buy more personal computers than
women "is neither a permanent
market situation nor one which we
hope to perpetuate."
