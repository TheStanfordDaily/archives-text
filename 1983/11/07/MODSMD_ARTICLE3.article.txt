# Increased room rates anger many students

### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer 
Many students, particularly those
living in self-ops, are angered by this
quarter's increase in University
room rates — but most are finding
there is little they can do about it.
The rate hikes came about as the
result of a task group review of the
housing rate structure that was con
ducted last year. Under the new
structure, rent in University
operated houses has increased 14.5
percent over last year while rates at
self-ops have gone up 19.1 percent.
That means residents of self-ops,
whose rates were once among the
lowest on campus, are now paying
$620 per quarter, $4 more than the
$616 paid by residents of University
operated houses.
Some self-ops, including Terra,
recently considered withholding
their room payment from the Uni
versity as a protest against the rate
increases. But Jeff Knowlton, Terra's
house manager, said he talked to
members of a number of other
houses and could not gather
enough support for the protest.

Jack Norris, president of Sigrric
Alpha HpsiJon, said hin house «ils<
considered withholding payment
but decided against it in light of the
current review of the fraternity sys
tem now being conducted by the
University.
According to Linda Mclntyre, a
financial analyst for Facilities and
Services who led last year's review
of housing rates, self-op residents
essentially have no recourse for
trying to change this year's room
rates because rates are fixed tor the
entire year.
At a meeting of the Inter-
Fraternity Council on Oct. 19,
however, Mclntyre said the Univer
sity will accept suggestions to help it
set rates for coming years.
Mclntyre also explained to frater
nity members there that the dramat
ic increase in rates at self-ops
resulted from a reassessment of the
cost to the University of maintaining
kitchen and dining facilities at self
ops. In the previous housing cost al
location system, this cost had been
underestimated, and the rate hike
was simply "gap-closing," accor
ding to Dean of Residential Educa
tion Norman Robinson.
"In the previous allocation, they
(self-ops) hadn't been bearing their
full share of the cost ot running the
residence system," he said.
Residential Education policy stip
ulates that room rates should not
reflect differences in amenities,
degree ol desirability, number of
occupants of the rooms or differ
ences in the cost of maintaining the
basic facility.
But rates may differ to reflect dif
ferent levels of service or program
ming provided by the University,
and because self-ops have kitchen
and dining facilities, room rates in
clude a charge for these facilities.
Most residents of self-ops agree
with the principle behind the rate
structure but remain concerned
about the University's allocation of
costs to self-ops. Craig Jankowsky,
house manager of Kairos, questions
whether his house receives all the
custodial and maintenance care for
which the University charges its resi
dents.
Jankowsky is also disturbed, as
are most self-op residents, by the
idea of paying higher room rates
than residents of University
operated houses when self-ops do
not receive any regular University
custodial and maintenance care. Be
cause they do their own cleaning
and manage their own kitchens,
self-op residents believe that they
should save money.
"There used to be a monetary in
centive to live in a self-op,"
Jankowsky said, but the rate in
crease has done away with it.
