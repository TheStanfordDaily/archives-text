# Court order ends heated dispute between Stanford and USW
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
A court order requiring that the Univer
sity provide the I nited Stanford Workers
with information on employees who
worked .it Stanford in 1980 has tinally ended
a heated dispute between the University
and the USW that began three years ago.
Patrick Smith, president of USW, said the
union sought the information — which
covers temporary employees, subcontrac
tors and life-science research assistants —
to discover the "areas where the University
is giving bargaining unit work to non-union
members.''
Although the information only covers
those employed in 1980, Smith contended
that "the information still will be valuable."
The University, while maintaining that
USW has not demonstated a need for the
information, has decided not to appeal the
decision this time. Priscilla Wheeler, the

University's managing attorney for labor,
said that the "issues raised in 1980 are moot
in regard to the new contract" that Stanford
negotiated with USW after the union's
strike last fall.
"We have a new contract, and we want to
get on with business," she said. "At this
point we want to have a stable labor rela
tionship."
USW first requested the information in
1980 by filing 111 "status letters," or griev
ances, with the University. The University
refused to comply, stating that USW was
not entitled to private information on indi
viduals not covered by the contract be
tween USW and the University.
A ruling in |une 1982 by the National
Labor Relations Board ordered the Univer
sity to provide the information. The Univer
sity appealed the decision, but the Ninth
Circuit Court once again ordered the Uni
versity to supply the information.

According to Smith, the request for infor
mation played a decisive role in last year's
strike. "The strike was ,in effort to show our
resolve to the University that we were in
fact serious about achieving the informa
tion," he said.
Smith said that the University's position
that USW possessed n > right to have the in
formation, combined with poor media sup
port, eventually forced the union to aban
don the issue during strike negotiations.
"Vet clearly the appeals process turns the
guilt on them," Smith concluded.
Wheeler, however, said that the request
for information was asically a contractual
challenge," since it so closely followed the
contract that Stanford negotiated with USW
in 1979.
Smith said that the newly won right to the
information will help identify areas where
non-union member are doing unit
bargaining work, providing some 'notions

of a trend where the University is inclined
to use outside people," and allowing the
union to proceed on some outstanding
grievances.
The union charges that Stanford is manip
ulating the use of temporary workers and is
promoting workers out of union-classified
jobs.
"In effect, they're denying these people
the right to be represented by the union,"
Smith said.
Smith charged that to do extensive
grounds work during spring and summer,
the University hires temporary workers im
mediately before their employment period
ends and then rehires them several days
later.
Yet according to Wheeler, the policy ot
hiring temporary workers for such short
term jobs as work on University grounds

helps rather then hinders the union.
"Our utilization of temporary workers
keeps union workers from being laid oti,
she said.
Wheeler also emphasized that the Uni
versity's hiring practices regarding tem
poraries were entirely legal. The contract
specifies that the University may not hire a
temporary to do bargaining work if it must
lay off a union member in order to do so.
'Our position," she said, "was that we
were not laying union members off."
Smith said that USW's request for infor
mation asked for the names, classification
titles and job descriptions of all life-sciencc
research assistants, a job description not in
cluded in the bargaining unit. USW
protested the Medical School's promoting
workers from the union-classified job of
life-science technician to the position ot
life-science research assistant.
Smith said that because the
promotion entailed neither a salary
increase nor a change in the sub
stance of work, the University "was
trying to promote people out of the
bargaining unit without changing
their work."

Wheeler said that the University
implemented about a year ago a
new classification series regarding
technicians and research assistants.
However, the union does not
believe that the move has solved the
situation.
Wheeler also maintained that the
issue of technicians versus research
assistants demonstrated how the
"union doesn t match our commu
nity." She said that in an industry,
only people in the union may per
form bargaining- unit work. Vet in
the academic community of Stan
ford, difficulties occur in attempting
to classify what constitues bargain
ing unit work.
For instance, both a physicist and
a lab technician may do similar work
on the same equipment.
USW's right to the information
appears to have ended another
phase in the dispute between the
union and the University. USW will
attempt to use the information —
which, according to Smith, it has not
yet received — to preserve
bargaining-unit work.
