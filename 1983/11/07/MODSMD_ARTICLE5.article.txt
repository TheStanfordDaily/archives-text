Reagan, Jamaican leader confer
Washington — Prime Minister Edward Seaga of
Jamaica met with President Reagan yesterday and
Seaga told reporters that U.S. troops should he able
to leave Grenada "reasonably soon."
"From the very beginning we were of the view
that as soon as hostilities ceased that the U.S. troops
would, it they wished to, withdraw and then we
would be able to carry on," said Seaga, who
represents one of the Caribbean nations that asked
the United States to intervene in Grenada.
Seaga, whose nation has about 150 troops in the
military occupation force in Grenada, said the
troops of his country and the other Caribbean na
tions — about 300 total — could maintain stability in

Grenada without the United States if they could ob
tain the necessary equipment.
Seaga spoke to reporters on the White Houst
driveway after a 45-minute meeting with Reagan ir
the White House living quarters.
Seaga said he and Reagan agreed that either U.S.
students on the island or its governor general, Paul
Scoon, could have been killed or taken hostage had
the invasion not occurred.
He said he and the president discussed the need
to stabilize the country. "There will be a need to
provide employment to help the country to revive,
he said. "You are dealing with a country of 11S,00(i
people. Therefore, the magnitudes ot aid are not
large, but they are very meaningful."
Asked whether there should be a similar invasion

of Nicaragua, Seaga responded: "I don't know that
the situation is the same in Nicaragua. They haven't
reached the stage yet where they have butchered a
prime minister." It was a reference to the Oct. I 1 ) kil
ling of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.
For today, the president has invited 500 American
students evacuated from Grenada to meet with him
in the Rose Garden. An estimated 40 U.S. ser
vicemen involved in the evacuation also are sched
uled to attend.

are "the price the free world must pay it the free
world wants to resist communist aggression."

United States should not declare war on the Syrian
or Palestinian groups, but "we have to tell them any
terrorist activity in the future will be regarded as acts
ot war in the eyes of Israel, the United States ot
