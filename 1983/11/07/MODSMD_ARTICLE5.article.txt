Reagan, Jamaican leader confer
Washington — Prime Minister Edward Seaga of
Jamaica met with President Reagan yesterday and
Seaga told reporters that U.S. troops should he able
to leave Grenada "reasonably soon."
"From the very beginning we were of the view
that as soon as hostilities ceased that the U.S. troops
would, it they wished to, withdraw and then we
would be able to carry on," said Seaga, who
represents one of the Caribbean nations that asked
the United States to intervene in Grenada.
Seaga, whose nation has about 150 troops in the
military occupation force in Grenada, said the
troops of his country and the other Caribbean na
tions — about 300 total — could maintain stability in

Grenada without the United States if they could ob
tain the necessary equipment.
Seaga spoke to reporters on the White Houst
driveway after a 45-minute meeting with Reagan ir
the White House living quarters.
Seaga said he and Reagan agreed that either U.S.
students on the island or its governor general, Paul
Scoon, could have been killed or taken hostage had
the invasion not occurred.
He said he and the president discussed the need
to stabilize the country. "There will be a need to
provide employment to help the country to revive,
he said. "You are dealing with a country of 11S,00(i
people. Therefore, the magnitudes ot aid are not
large, but they are very meaningful."
Asked whether there should be a similar invasion

of Nicaragua, Seaga responded: "I don't know that
the situation is the same in Nicaragua. They haven't
reached the stage yet where they have butchered a
prime minister." It was a reference to the Oct. I 1 ) kil
ling of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.
For today, the president has invited 500 American
students evacuated from Grenada to meet with him
in the Rose Garden. An estimated 40 U.S. ser
vicemen involved in the evacuation also are sched
uled to attend.
Sharon speaks in San Francisco
San Francisco — Israeli Cabinet Minister Ariel
Sharon urged the United States and France to close
the Syrian embassies in Washington and Paris and
"stop this bargaining over the future of Lebanon
with the Syrians."
Sh.i'on said Israel was saddened by the rei cnt ter
rorist bombings that killed U.S. Marines Ftench

troops and Israelis in Lebanon, but said the United
States should maintain its peacekeeping presence in
Lebanon and help negotiate a solution.
He said the slayings of the peacekeeping troops
are "the price the free world must pay it the free
world wants to resist communist aggression."
The former Israeli defense minister said the
United States should not declare war on the Syrian
or Palestinian groups, but "we have to tell them any
terrorist activity in the future will be regarded as acts
ot war in the eyes of Israel, the United States ot
America and the free world."
At a news conference before his speech to the He
brew Academy of San Francisco, Sharon recom
mended several steps to bring about a peaceful
settlement in Lebanon. These included U.S. parti(
pation in a multinational force to remove term;:
from West Beirut, and to secure mountains in ■;>
region from terrorist forces.
At least 100 mounted, riot-equipped police
flanked the crowd and dozens of helmeted
police guarded the entrances to the hotel.
Rabbi Pinchus Lipner, a representative of
the Hebrew Academy, said Sharon came to
the United States only to visit the group and
would return promptly to Israel without stop
ping in Washington. Lipner said the address
was "to help strengthen the Jewish commu
nity, which numbers 150,000 in the San Fran
cisco area."
Israel buries bombing victims
Jerusalem — Israel on Sunday began
burying its dead from the terrorist bombing
in southern Lebanon and vowed to "strike
back sevenfold" in retribution for any more
attacks.
Israel accused the Syrians of helping en
gineer the blast that killed 28 Israelis and 32
Lebanese and Palestinians Friday at Israeli
military headquarters in the southern
Lebanese city of Tyre. Families held funerals
for 20 Israeli victims.
Despite the stringent security measures Is
rael adopted after the Tyre explosion, an Is
raeli army position on the Zaharani River
came under fire yesterday and one soldier
was wounded. In the evening, a bazooka
rocket was fired at the Israeli military
headquarters in Sidon but didn't inflict any
casualties.
The Tyre bombing caused the worst loss of
lite in hostile action since Israel's invasion of
Lebanon in |une 1982 to destroy Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrilla bases.
Israel Radio quoted Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, visiting 29 bomb victims at Haifa's
Rambam Hospital in northern Israel, as
saying, "Israel will do all that is possible and
necessary to wipe out terrorism and
safeguard its soldiers so that in the not too
distant future we can pull Israeli troops out
of Lebanon."
Shamir went later to the northern border
town of Kiryat Shmona, and in a speech to
the residents said Lebanon should not
renege on its agreement with Israel for the
withdrawal of all foreign troops from
Lebanon. Syria is opposed to the pact and
has refused to remove its forces.
"If you give in to the enemies of peace you
can expect a miserable life of murder and
slavery," Shamir said. "Abrogation of the
agreement is abrogation of Israel's
freedom."
Cabinet Secretary Dan Meridor said after
the Cabinet's regular session that "the explo
sion is Tyre, following the explosion in Beirut
(at a U.S. Marine command post), shows
there is a community of interest between Is
rael and the United States on Lebanon
policy."
Meridor also spoke of PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's predicament in northern Lebanon,
where Syrian-backed Palestinian rebels have
been besieging Arafat and his backers in
fierce fighting in and around Tripoli.

PLO regroups in Lebanon
Tripoli, Lebanon — Yasser Arafat and his
Palestinian Liberation Organization fighters,
driven from one refugee camp under intense
artillery fire, regrouped yesterday to defend
their last Middle East stronghold against a
tank-led assault by Syrian-backed mutineers.
The harried Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion leader, shuttling between Tripoli and
loyalist positions, told reporters Syria was
trying to destroy him and his 80(H) fighters,
and said no truce negotiations were planned.
The rebel tanks and heavy artillery forced
Arafat's men to abandon Nahar el-Bared
refugee camp outside Northern Tripoli and
flee to the Baddawi camp, Arafat's last
redoubt six miles closer to the city.
Centrists win Turkish elections
Ankara, Turkey — Voters drubbed the party
backed by Turkey's ruling generals yester
day, turning instead toward the centrist Mot
herland Party in the nation's first parliamen
tary elections since a 1980 military takeover.
With 85 percent of the vote counted, state
radio and television reported early today that
Turgut Ozal's Motherland Party had 7.08 mil
lion votes or 44.8 percent and appeared
headed for victory.
The center-left Populist Party of Necdet
Calp had 4.8 million votes or 30.5 percent,
and the military-backed Nationalist
Democracy Party led by retired Gen. Turgut
Sunalp was a surprising third with 3.7 million
votes or 23.5 percent. Independent candi
dates won the other votes.
Final results for the 400-seat Parliament
were not expected before late today.
The Interior Ministry announced that tur
nout among 19.2 million registered voters
was high, despite rainy weather in many
areas. Voting was mandatory and failure to
cast a ballot carried a $10 fine. No violent
incidents were reported at the 84,000 polling
places.
A total of 1217 candidates were in the race,
50 of them independents and the rest from
the three parties permitted by the military to
run in the country's first general election
since 1977.
The new constitution approved last No
vember gives increased powers to President
Kenan Evren, who as armed forces chief of
staff led the 1980 coup.
Evren can appoint many high-level offi
cials, including the members of the supreme
court. The president also can ask for a na
tional referendum on constitutional amend
ments.
All his actions are subject to parliamentary
approval.
Evren is to remain president, and as heads
of their parties, Sunalp, Ozal and Calp are in
the race for the premier's job.
Martial law remains in force throughout
the country unless the new legislature, which
convenes in late November, decides to lift it.
At the time of the military takeover, clashes

between leftist and rightist gangs were c tann
ing 20 lives daily. A three-year martial law
crackdown put *0,000 suspected terrorists
and their alleged sympathizers in prison.
Twenty-eight were hanged.
Army drops leaflets
St. George's, Grenada — U.S. Army helicop
ters dropped hundreds ot leaflets over nor
thern and central Grenada yesterday urging
residents to cooperate in locating any
Grenadian army or Cuban resisters to the
U.S. invasion.
In Washington, the State Department said
a gravesite was found on Grenada and it
might contain the body of slain Prime Mini
ster Maurice Bishop. It said the report came
from John Steinmetz, a member ot the de
partment's working group now in Grenada,
and did not give the location of the gravesite
or say how many bodies were found.
The New York Times quoted a U.S. official
in Grenada as saying more than 100 bodies
had been found at the Chevigy army training
camp at the southern tip ot this Caribbean Is
land. It quoted the official, who was not
identified, as saying one of the bodies was
"presumed'' to be that of Bishop.
The Times said the official told reporters it
was believed that virtually all of the victims
were shot to death during a pro-Bishop rally
in St. George's Market Square on Oct. 19.
The next day, Grenada's Marxist army com
mander, Gen. Hudson Austin, seized control
of the country in a coup that ended the bitter
power struggle between factions in the leftist
government.
American officials, meanwhile, said U.S.
aid will help rebuild the mental hospital that
the American military says was bombed acci
dentally by U.S. warplanes during the inva
sion of Grenada on Oct. 25.
Andropov ill, misses parade
Moscow — President Yuri Andropov was
too ill to attend an annual military parade
today marking the 66th anniversary of the
Bolshevik Revolution.
It was believed to be the first time a Soviet
leader has not viewed the parade from atop
Lenin's tomb at the base of the Kremlin wall
in Red Square.
Last year Leonid Brezhnev, Andropov's
predecessor, climbed the stairs to the
reviewing stand and stood an hour in freez
ing weather just three days before he died.
The Soviet government has claimed that
the 69-year-old Andropov only has a cold,
but his absence from a major meeting over
the weekend and from the parade have
raised new questions about his health.
Today's weather
Morning clouds clearing to sunny skies by
afternoon. Cooler temperatures with highs
in the 50s to 60s. Lows in the 40s to 50s.

from John Steinmetz, a member ot the de

and did not give the location of the gravesite
or say how many bodies were found.
The New York Times quoted a U.S. official

were shot to death during a pro-Bishop rally

of the country in a coup that ended the bitter
power struggle between factions in the leftist
government.
American officials, meanwhile, said U.S.

Andropov ill, misses parade
Moscow — President Yuri Andropov was
too ill to attend an annual military parade
today marking the 66th anniversary of the
Bolshevik Revolution.
It was believed to be the first time a Soviet
leader has not viewed the parade from atop
Lenin's tomb at the base of the Kremlin wall
in Red Square.
Last year Leonid Brezhnev, Andropov's
predecessor, climbed the stairs to the
reviewing stand and stood an hour in freez
ing weather just three days before he died.
The Soviet government has claimed that
the 69-year-old Andropov only has a cold,
but his absence from a major meeting over
the weekend and from the parade have
raised new questions about his health.
Today's weather

Reagan, Jamaican leader confer
Washington — Prime Minister Edward Seaga of
Jamaica met with President Reagan yesterday and
Seaga told reporters that U.S. troops should he able
to leave Grenada "reasonably soon."
"From the very beginning we were of the view
that as soon as hostilities ceased that the U.S. troops
would, it they wished to, withdraw and then we
would be able to carry on," said Seaga, who
represents one of the Caribbean nations that asked
the United States to intervene in Grenada.
Seaga, whose nation has about 150 troops in the
military occupation force in Grenada, said the
troops of his country and the other Caribbean na
tions — about 300 total — could maintain stability in

Grenada without the United States if they could ob
tain the necessary equipment.
Seaga spoke to reporters on the White Houst
driveway after a 45-minute meeting with Reagan ir
the White House living quarters.
Seaga said he and Reagan agreed that either U.S.
students on the island or its governor general, Paul
Scoon, could have been killed or taken hostage had
the invasion not occurred.
He said he and the president discussed the need
to stabilize the country. "There will be a need to
provide employment to help the country to revive,
he said. "You are dealing with a country of 11S,00(i
people. Therefore, the magnitudes ot aid are not
large, but they are very meaningful."
Asked whether there should be a similar invasion

of Nicaragua, Seaga responded: "I don't know that
the situation is the same in Nicaragua. They haven't
reached the stage yet where they have butchered a
prime minister." It was a reference to the Oct. I 1 ) kil
ling of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.
For today, the president has invited 500 American
students evacuated from Grenada to meet with him
in the Rose Garden. An estimated 40 U.S. ser
vicemen involved in the evacuation also are sched
uled to attend.
Sharon speaks in San Francisco
San Francisco — Israeli Cabinet Minister Ariel
Sharon urged the United States and France to close
the Syrian embassies in Washington and Paris and
"stop this bargaining over the future of Lebanon
with the Syrians."
Sh.i'on said Israel was saddened by the rei cnt ter
rorist bombings that killed U.S. Marines Ftench

troops and Israelis in Lebanon, but said the United
States should maintain its peacekeeping presence in
Lebanon and help negotiate a solution.
He said the slayings of the peacekeeping troops
are "the price the free world must pay it the free
world wants to resist communist aggression."
The former Israeli defense minister said the
United States should not declare war on the Syrian
or Palestinian groups, but "we have to tell them any
terrorist activity in the future will be regarded as acts
ot war in the eyes of Israel, the United States ot
America and the free world."
At a news conference before his speech to the He
brew Academy of San Francisco, Sharon recom
mended several steps to bring about a peaceful
settlement in Lebanon. These included U.S. parti(
pation in a multinational force to remove term;:
from West Beirut, and to secure mountains in ■;>
region from terrorist forces.
At least 100 mounted, riot-equipped police
flanked the crowd and dozens of helmeted
police guarded the entrances to the hotel.
Rabbi Pinchus Lipner, a representative of
the Hebrew Academy, said Sharon came to
the United States only to visit the group and
would return promptly to Israel without stop
ping in Washington. Lipner said the address
was "to help strengthen the Jewish commu
nity, which numbers 150,000 in the San Fran
cisco area."
Israel buries bombing victims
Jerusalem — Israel on Sunday began
burying its dead from the terrorist bombing
in southern Lebanon and vowed to "strike
back sevenfold" in retribution for any more
attacks.
Israel accused the Syrians of helping en
gineer the blast that killed 28 Israelis and 32
Lebanese and Palestinians Friday at Israeli
military headquarters in the southern
Lebanese city of Tyre. Families held funerals
for 20 Israeli victims.
Despite the stringent security measures Is
rael adopted after the Tyre explosion, an Is
raeli army position on the Zaharani River
came under fire yesterday and one soldier
was wounded. In the evening, a bazooka
rocket was fired at the Israeli military
headquarters in Sidon but didn't inflict any
casualties.
The Tyre bombing caused the worst loss of
lite in hostile action since Israel's invasion of
Lebanon in |une 1982 to destroy Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrilla bases.
Israel Radio quoted Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, visiting 29 bomb victims at Haifa's
Rambam Hospital in northern Israel, as
saying, "Israel will do all that is possible and
necessary to wipe out terrorism and
safeguard its soldiers so that in the not too
distant future we can pull Israeli troops out
of Lebanon."
Shamir went later to the northern border
town of Kiryat Shmona, and in a speech to
the residents said Lebanon should not
renege on its agreement with Israel for the
withdrawal of all foreign troops from
Lebanon. Syria is opposed to the pact and
has refused to remove its forces.
"If you give in to the enemies of peace you
can expect a miserable life of murder and
slavery," Shamir said. "Abrogation of the
agreement is abrogation of Israel's
freedom."
Cabinet Secretary Dan Meridor said after
the Cabinet's regular session that "the explo
sion is Tyre, following the explosion in Beirut
(at a U.S. Marine command post), shows
there is a community of interest between Is
rael and the United States on Lebanon
policy."
Meridor also spoke of PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's predicament in northern Lebanon,
where Syrian-backed Palestinian rebels have
been besieging Arafat and his backers in
fierce fighting in and around Tripoli.

PLO regroups in Lebanon
Tripoli, Lebanon — Yasser Arafat and his
Palestinian Liberation Organization fighters,
driven from one refugee camp under intense
artillery fire, regrouped yesterday to defend
their last Middle East stronghold against a
tank-led assault by Syrian-backed mutineers.
The harried Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion leader, shuttling between Tripoli and
loyalist positions, told reporters Syria was
trying to destroy him and his 80(H) fighters,
and said no truce negotiations were planned.
The rebel tanks and heavy artillery forced
Arafat's men to abandon Nahar el-Bared
refugee camp outside Northern Tripoli and
flee to the Baddawi camp, Arafat's last
redoubt six miles closer to the city.
Centrists win Turkish elections
Ankara, Turkey — Voters drubbed the party
backed by Turkey's ruling generals yester
day, turning instead toward the centrist Mot
herland Party in the nation's first parliamen
tary elections since a 1980 military takeover.
With 85 percent of the vote counted, state
radio and television reported early today that
Turgut Ozal's Motherland Party had 7.08 mil
lion votes or 44.8 percent and appeared
headed for victory.
The center-left Populist Party of Necdet
Calp had 4.8 million votes or 30.5 percent,
and the military-backed Nationalist
Democracy Party led by retired Gen. Turgut
Sunalp was a surprising third with 3.7 million
votes or 23.5 percent. Independent candi
dates won the other votes.
Final results for the 400-seat Parliament
were not expected before late today.
The Interior Ministry announced that tur
nout among 19.2 million registered voters
was high, despite rainy weather in many
areas. Voting was mandatory and failure to
cast a ballot carried a $10 fine. No violent
incidents were reported at the 84,000 polling
places.
A total of 1217 candidates were in the race,
50 of them independents and the rest from
the three parties permitted by the military to
run in the country's first general election
since 1977.
The new constitution approved last No
vember gives increased powers to President
Kenan Evren, who as armed forces chief of
staff led the 1980 coup.
Evren can appoint many high-level offi
cials, including the members of the supreme
court. The president also can ask for a na
tional referendum on constitutional amend
ments.
All his actions are subject to parliamentary
approval.
Evren is to remain president, and as heads
of their parties, Sunalp, Ozal and Calp are in
the race for the premier's job.
Martial law remains in force throughout
the country unless the new legislature, which
convenes in late November, decides to lift it.
At the time of the military takeover, clashes

between leftist and rightist gangs were c tann
ing 20 lives daily. A three-year martial law
crackdown put *0,000 suspected terrorists
and their alleged sympathizers in prison.
Twenty-eight were hanged.

Army drops leaflets
St. George's, Grenada — U.S. Army helicop
ters dropped hundreds ot leaflets over nor
thern and central Grenada yesterday urging
residents to cooperate in locating any
Grenadian army or Cuban resisters to the
U.S. invasion.
In Washington, the State Department said
a gravesite was found on Grenada and it
might contain the body of slain Prime Mini
ster Maurice Bishop. It said the report came
from John Steinmetz, a member ot the de
partment's working group now in Grenada,
and did not give the location of the gravesite
or say how many bodies were found.
The New York Times quoted a U.S. official
in Grenada as saying more than 100 bodies
had been found at the Chevigy army training
camp at the southern tip ot this Caribbean Is
land. It quoted the official, who was not
identified, as saying one of the bodies was
"presumed'' to be that of Bishop.
The Times said the official told reporters it
was believed that virtually all of the victims
were shot to death during a pro-Bishop rally
in St. George's Market Square on Oct. 19.
The next day, Grenada's Marxist army com
mander, Gen. Hudson Austin, seized control
of the country in a coup that ended the bitter
power struggle between factions in the leftist
government.
American officials, meanwhile, said U.S.
aid will help rebuild the mental hospital that
the American military says was bombed acci
dentally by U.S. warplanes during the inva
sion of Grenada on Oct. 25.
Andropov ill, misses parade
Moscow — President Yuri Andropov was
too ill to attend an annual military parade
today marking the 66th anniversary of the
Bolshevik Revolution.
It was believed to be the first time a Soviet
leader has not viewed the parade from atop
Lenin's tomb at the base of the Kremlin wall
in Red Square.
Last year Leonid Brezhnev, Andropov's
predecessor, climbed the stairs to the
reviewing stand and stood an hour in freez
ing weather just three days before he died.
The Soviet government has claimed that
the 69-year-old Andropov only has a cold,
but his absence from a major meeting over
the weekend and from the parade have
raised new questions about his health.

Reagan, Jamaican leader confer
Washington — Prime Minister Edward Seaga of
Jamaica met with President Reagan yesterday and
Seaga told reporters that U.S. troops should he able
to leave Grenada "reasonably soon."
"From the very beginning we were of the view
that as soon as hostilities ceased that the U.S. troops
would, it they wished to, withdraw and then we
would be able to carry on," said Seaga, who
represents one of the Caribbean nations that asked
the United States to intervene in Grenada.
Seaga, whose nation has about 150 troops in the
military occupation force in Grenada, said the
troops of his country and the other Caribbean na
tions — about 300 total — could maintain stability in

Grenada without the United States if they could ob
tain the necessary equipment.
Seaga spoke to reporters on the White Houst
driveway after a 45-minute meeting with Reagan ir
the White House living quarters.
Seaga said he and Reagan agreed that either U.S.
students on the island or its governor general, Paul
Scoon, could have been killed or taken hostage had
the invasion not occurred.
He said he and the president discussed the need
to stabilize the country. "There will be a need to
provide employment to help the country to revive,
he said. "You are dealing with a country of 11S,00(i
people. Therefore, the magnitudes ot aid are not
large, but they are very meaningful."
Asked whether there should be a similar invasion

of Nicaragua, Seaga responded: "I don't know that
the situation is the same in Nicaragua. They haven't
reached the stage yet where they have butchered a
prime minister." It was a reference to the Oct. I 1 ) kil
ling of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.
For today, the president has invited 500 American
students evacuated from Grenada to meet with him
in the Rose Garden. An estimated 40 U.S. ser
vicemen involved in the evacuation also are sched
uled to attend.
Sharon speaks in San Francisco
San Francisco — Israeli Cabinet Minister Ariel
Sharon urged the United States and France to close
the Syrian embassies in Washington and Paris and
"stop this bargaining over the future of Lebanon
with the Syrians."
Sh.i'on said Israel was saddened by the rei cnt ter
rorist bombings that killed U.S. Marines Ftench

troops and Israelis in Lebanon, but said the United
States should maintain its peacekeeping presence in
Lebanon and help negotiate a solution.
He said the slayings of the peacekeeping troops
are "the price the free world must pay it the free
world wants to resist communist aggression."
The former Israeli defense minister said the
United States should not declare war on the Syrian
or Palestinian groups, but "we have to tell them any
terrorist activity in the future will be regarded as acts
ot war in the eyes of Israel, the United States ot
America and the free world."
At a news conference before his speech to the He
brew Academy of San Francisco, Sharon recom
mended several steps to bring about a peaceful
settlement in Lebanon. These included U.S. parti(
pation in a multinational force to remove term;:
from West Beirut, and to secure mountains in ■;>
region from terrorist forces.
At least 100 mounted, riot-equipped police
flanked the crowd and dozens of helmeted
police guarded the entrances to the hotel.
Rabbi Pinchus Lipner, a representative of
the Hebrew Academy, said Sharon came to
the United States only to visit the group and
would return promptly to Israel without stop
ping in Washington. Lipner said the address
was "to help strengthen the Jewish commu
nity, which numbers 150,000 in the San Fran
cisco area."
Israel buries bombing victims
Jerusalem — Israel on Sunday began
burying its dead from the terrorist bombing
in southern Lebanon and vowed to "strike
back sevenfold" in retribution for any more
attacks.
Israel accused the Syrians of helping en
gineer the blast that killed 28 Israelis and 32
Lebanese and Palestinians Friday at Israeli
military headquarters in the southern
Lebanese city of Tyre. Families held funerals
for 20 Israeli victims.
Despite the stringent security measures Is
rael adopted after the Tyre explosion, an Is
raeli army position on the Zaharani River
came under fire yesterday and one soldier
was wounded. In the evening, a bazooka
rocket was fired at the Israeli military
headquarters in Sidon but didn't inflict any
casualties.
The Tyre bombing caused the worst loss of
lite in hostile action since Israel's invasion of
Lebanon in |une 1982 to destroy Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrilla bases.
Israel Radio quoted Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, visiting 29 bomb victims at Haifa's
Rambam Hospital in northern Israel, as
saying, "Israel will do all that is possible and
necessary to wipe out terrorism and
safeguard its soldiers so that in the not too
distant future we can pull Israeli troops out
of Lebanon."
Shamir went later to the northern border
town of Kiryat Shmona, and in a speech to
the residents said Lebanon should not
renege on its agreement with Israel for the
withdrawal of all foreign troops from
Lebanon. Syria is opposed to the pact and
has refused to remove its forces.
"If you give in to the enemies of peace you
can expect a miserable life of murder and
slavery," Shamir said. "Abrogation of the
agreement is abrogation of Israel's
freedom."
Cabinet Secretary Dan Meridor said after
the Cabinet's regular session that "the explo
sion is Tyre, following the explosion in Beirut
(at a U.S. Marine command post), shows
there is a community of interest between Is
rael and the United States on Lebanon
policy."
Meridor also spoke of PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's predicament in northern Lebanon,
where Syrian-backed Palestinian rebels have
been besieging Arafat and his backers in
fierce fighting in and around Tripoli.

PLO regroups in Lebanon
Tripoli, Lebanon — Yasser Arafat and his
Palestinian Liberation Organization fighters,
driven from one refugee camp under intense
artillery fire, regrouped yesterday to defend
their last Middle East stronghold against a
tank-led assault by Syrian-backed mutineers.
The harried Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion leader, shuttling between Tripoli and
loyalist positions, told reporters Syria was
trying to destroy him and his 80(H) fighters,
and said no truce negotiations were planned.
The rebel tanks and heavy artillery forced
Arafat's men to abandon Nahar el-Bared
refugee camp outside Northern Tripoli and
flee to the Baddawi camp, Arafat's last
redoubt six miles closer to the city.
Centrists win Turkish elections
