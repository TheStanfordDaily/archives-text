\ truck-bomb parked with a halt
ton of explosives crashed into the Is
raeli military headquarters in southern
Lebanon Friday, leveling the outpost
and killing at least 29 people and
wounding 20.
The Islamic Revolutionary Move
ment — the same group which
claimed responsibility for the Oct.
23 attacks on the U.S. and French
military compounds in Beirut — said
it engineered the attack in Tyre, 45
miles southwest of the capital.
In swift reprisal, Israeli forces
staged air strikes on four targets in
the mountains east of Beirut. Chris
tian Phalange radio said as many as
30 people were killed and 50
wounded in the attacks, which
private radio stations claimed con
sisted of at least 10 bombing sorties
on several artillery positions and
tank concentrations.
The air strikes marked the first Is
raeli attack in Lebanon in 14 months.
Israeli officials said the suicide
driver crashed through roadblocks
and a hail of gunfire from guards as
it sped toward the heavily fortified
two-story headquarters in the early
morning hours. The truck was
stopped by gunfire before it hit the
building but it exploded, leveling
one two-story building and partially
damaging another.

As the United States moved to
withdraw 2300 troops from Grenada
on Friday, White House and Pent
agon officials privately acknowl
edged that they were upset by the
Reagan administration's lack of can
dor in dealing with the invasion of
the island, according to the Associ
ated Press.
Initial reports by the administra
tion insisting that U.S. forces had
invaded the island without inflicting
any civilian casualties were nullified
by Monday's announcement of a
Navy air strike on an unmarked
mental hospital which killed at least
12 people.
Officials described the bombing
as accidental and stressed that
Crenadian soldiers fired upon U.S.
troops from the hospital, located
inside the Fort Frederick military
complex outside the capital of St.
George s.
In other news from Grenada, the
announcement of the hospital bom
bing on Monday coincided with the
lifting of the ban on press coverage
in Grenada. • .
In London, Commonwealth Sec
retary Dir Shridath Kamphal said he
was prepared to send a common
wealth force to replace U.S. troops
within weeks. He stressed that the
paramilitary force would probably
range from 500 to 1000, but would

not be called a "peacekeeping"
force because of the implication that
it might be drawn into fighting.
The commonwealth of former
British colonies, including Grenada,
is a loose confederation of states
that has occasionally intervened
when one of its members has expe
rienced civil strife.
In Washington, both houses of
Congress overwhelmingly approved
legislation invoking the War Powers
Act in response to the president's
military policy in Grenada. Under
the 1973 act, Congress could limit
the stay of U.S. troops on the island
to 90 days.
At a Thursday news conference
Reagan apparently opted for a
switch in semantics, rejecting his
earlier use of "invasion" to describe
U.S. conduct in Grenada in favor of
"rescue mission."
"For heaven's sake," the presi
dent said in response to a reporter's
question that some critics compare
the U.S. intervention in Grenada to
the 1979 Soviet assault on Afghanis
tan.

A Navy commando team fought "a
very pitched battle" with Grenadian
forces to rescue the island's British
governor general two days before U.S.
Marines and Army Rangers landed on

the island, according to a Navy
spokesman.
In an interview with The San
Diego Union, Naval Cmdr. Mike
Sherman said four members of the
Navy SEAL squad — an elite group
specializing in commando tactics
and clandestine operations —
drowned at sea when their boat
capsized off the Grenadian coast
Oct. 23.
Quoting unidentified Navy
sources, the newspaper said the
SEALs crept up a hill to Grenada's
Government House, the mansion
where Gov. Gen. Paul Scoon was
under house arrest. They encoun
tered heavy fire during the initial as
sault and were driven back.
After regrouping, the SEALs ap
parently attacked again, overran the
opposition force and succeeded in
securing the mansion from repeated
Grenadian attacks until U.S.
replacements arrived.
Scoon was safe inside the man
sion, the newspaper said.
Because SEAL operations are
"totally blacked out," according to
Navy sources, news of the raid was
not intended to be made public. The
Union said it accidentally stumbled
upon the incident when it received a
report of a private, unannounced
memorial service for the drowned
servicemen at the Coronado Naval
Amphibious Base chapel near San
Diego.

• • •
"Traces of bigotry still mar
America," President Reagan warned
Wednesday upon signing into law
legislation honoring the Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr., with a national
holiday.
An audience of black leaders,
members of Congress and veterans
of the civil rights movement gath
ered in the White House Rose Gar
den to witness the signing cere
mony. The president's remarks — in
which he described King as a man
who "stirred our nation to the very
depths of its soul" — prompted
praise from King's widow, Coretta
Scott King, and other civil rights ac
tivists.
Reagan's decision to approve the
legislation seemed to deviate from
his defense of Sen. Jesse Helms' (R-
N.C.) attempt to block the bill.
Helms launched a filibuster two
weeks ago as part of an effort to
convince the Senate that King "had
ties with communists."
• • •
Lebanon's national reconciliation
conference in Geneva, featuring rep
resentatives from the nine major war
ring Moslem, Christian and Druze
sects, moved to seek ways to end Is
raeli occupation of southern
Lebanon in the wake of Syrian

demands that Damascus' security
interests be recognized in any
Lebanese settlement.
The conference, which drew to a
close this weekend, marks the lirst
meeting in 40 years aimed at ad
dressing the political structure of
the country, which has endured at
least 179 cease-fires in the past de
cade.
• • •
Bloodshed in southern and central
Lebanon was augmented by reports of
about 800 Palestinian casualties at the
hands of Syrian forces in the northern
Lebanese port city of Tripoli this
weekend.
Syrian officials said the shelling
and air strikes on the Baddawi
refugee camp and several Palestin
ian military strongholds were a reac
tion to Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization (PLO) attacks on nearby
Syrian outposts.
"I will fight and die here with my
people but will never compromise
on my people's dignity, indepen
dence or rights," PLO chief Yassar
Arafat told the Associated Press at
Baddawi camp, where he is cur
rently supervising PLO strategy.
"They want to end the PLO,"
Aratat said of Syria. "They want to
create an alternative PLO that will be
a puppet in their hands. But I tell
them, I will only bow to God and to
the will of my people."

Soviet Leader Yuri Andropov failed
to appear at Saturday's annual Krem
lin meeting in honor of Revolution
Day, the start of a three-day celebra
tion marking the anniversary of the
1917 Bolshevik revolution in which
the Communist Party assumed
power.
Western analysts note that the 69-
year-old Andropov has not ap
peared in public since Aug.lB,
prompting speculation about his
health.
Today hundreds of thousands of
Soviet soldiers and civilians are ex
pected to march past the Kremlin
through Red Square in commemora
tion of the 66th anniversary of
liberation from the Russian
monarchy.

A crippled Soviet attack submarine,
drifting several hundred miles off the
South Carolina coast, may have
become disabled after a collision with
U.S. submarine tracking equipment.
According to The Washington Post,
the nuclear-powered Victor 111 Class
sub may have collided with a sub
tracking buoy towed by the U.S.

Navy frigate USS McCloy. The cable
connecting the tracking device to
the U.S. ship may have become
entwined with the propeller ot the
Soviet vessel.
Authorities advanced this expla
nation when it was revealed that the
McCloy arrived at a Virginia na\al
base Tuesday — minus the cable
and buoy.
U.S. intelligence officials contin
ued to maintain a round-the-clock
watch on the submarine this
weekend, and a Soviet salvage tug is
en route from Cuba to assist the
floundering craft. The U.s
destroyer Peterson is also moving
toward the scene to monitor ac
tivity, according to Navy officials.
Victor 111 Class subs joined the So
viet tleet in 1978 and routinely carry
six torpedos and nuclear-tipped
SSN-15 antisubmarine missiles with
a range of 35 miles. The Soviets
maintain 38 Victor I, II and 111 Class
subs.
Navy officials note that the
stranded sub otters a boon to U.s
intelligence, and one spokesman
added that the approximately 90 So
viet sailors aboard are almost cer
tainly "barfing up their borscht right
now" — a reference to seasickness.
"It would be very uncomfortable
because subs are not designed tor
traveling on the surface, the
spokesman said.
• • •
Vowing to "redirect the course of
this nation," the Rev. Jesse Jackson
formally declared his candidacy for
the Democratic presidential nomina
tion Thursday during a three and a
half hour ceremony that featured
speeches of support from his
"rainbow coalition" and denuncia
tions of discrimination in labor uni
ons.
The 42-year-old civil rights leader
became the eighth Democrat to en
ter the race for the 1984 nomination.
In an unofficial declaration of can
didacy a week ago, jackson stressed
that, if nominated, he would seek
support from younger voters. He
added that he would try to select a
female running mate.
• • •
South Africa took its first step awav
from exclusively white rule in 35 years
Thursday, approving a new constitu
tion that sets up separate chambers
of Parliament for Asians and
of mixed race.
Experts noted that while whites
voted nearly 2-to-1 in favor of the
charter, the new system does not ot
fer political rights for the country's
more than 21 million blacks.

\ truck-bomb parked with a halt
ton of explosives crashed into the Is
raeli military headquarters in southern
Lebanon Friday, leveling the outpost
and killing at least 29 people and
wounding 20.
The Islamic Revolutionary Move
ment — the same group which
claimed responsibility for the Oct.
23 attacks on the U.S. and French
military compounds in Beirut — said
it engineered the attack in Tyre, 45
miles southwest of the capital.
In swift reprisal, Israeli forces
staged air strikes on four targets in
the mountains east of Beirut. Chris

30 people were killed and 50
wounded in the attacks, which
private radio stations claimed con
sisted of at least 10 bombing sorties
on several artillery positions and
tank concentrations.
The air strikes marked the first Is
raeli attack in Lebanon in 14 months.
Israeli officials said the suicide
driver crashed through roadblocks
and a hail of gunfire from guards as
it sped toward the heavily fortified
two-story headquarters in the early
morning hours. The truck was
stopped by gunfire before it hit the
building but it exploded, leveling
one two-story building and partially

As the United States moved to
withdraw 2300 troops from Grenada
on Friday, White House and Pent
agon officials privately acknowl
edged that they were upset by the
Reagan administration's lack of can
dor in dealing with the invasion of
the island, according to the Associ
ated Press.
Initial reports by the administra
tion insisting that U.S. forces had
invaded the island without inflicting
any civilian casualties were nullified
by Monday's announcement of a
Navy air strike on an unmarked
mental hospital which killed at least
12 people.
Officials described the bombing
as accidental and stressed that
Crenadian soldiers fired upon U.S.
troops from the hospital, located
inside the Fort Frederick military
complex outside the capital of St.
George s.
In other news from Grenada, the
announcement of the hospital bom
bing on Monday coincided with the
lifting of the ban on press coverage
in Grenada. • .
In London, Commonwealth Sec
retary Dir Shridath Kamphal said he
was prepared to send a common
wealth force to replace U.S. troops
within weeks. He stressed that the
paramilitary force would probably
range from 500 to 1000, but would

not be called a "peacekeeping"
force because of the implication that
it might be drawn into fighting.
The commonwealth of former
British colonies, including Grenada,
is a loose confederation of states
that has occasionally intervened
when one of its members has expe
rienced civil strife.
In Washington, both houses of
Congress overwhelmingly approved
legislation invoking the War Powers
Act in response to the president's
military policy in Grenada. Under
the 1973 act, Congress could limit
the stay of U.S. troops on the island
to 90 days.
At a Thursday news conference
Reagan apparently opted for a
switch in semantics, rejecting his
earlier use of "invasion" to describe
U.S. conduct in Grenada in favor of
"rescue mission."
"For heaven's sake," the presi
dent said in response to a reporter's
question that some critics compare
the U.S. intervention in Grenada to
the 1979 Soviet assault on Afghanis
tan.

A Navy commando team fought "a
very pitched battle" with Grenadian
forces to rescue the island's British
governor general two days before U.S.
Marines and Army Rangers landed on

the island, according to a Navy
spokesman.
In an interview with The San
Diego Union, Naval Cmdr. Mike
Sherman said four members of the
Navy SEAL squad — an elite group
specializing in commando tactics
and clandestine operations —
drowned at sea when their boat
capsized off the Grenadian coast
Oct. 23.
Quoting unidentified Navy
sources, the newspaper said the
SEALs crept up a hill to Grenada's
Government House, the mansion
where Gov. Gen. Paul Scoon was
under house arrest. They encoun
tered heavy fire during the initial as
sault and were driven back.
After regrouping, the SEALs ap
parently attacked again, overran the
opposition force and succeeded in
securing the mansion from repeated
Grenadian attacks until U.S.
replacements arrived.
Scoon was safe inside the man
sion, the newspaper said.
Because SEAL operations are
"totally blacked out," according to
Navy sources, news of the raid was
not intended to be made public. The
Union said it accidentally stumbled
upon the incident when it received a
report of a private, unannounced
memorial service for the drowned
servicemen at the Coronado Naval
Amphibious Base chapel near San
Diego.

"Traces of bigotry still mar

Reagan's decision to approve the

Bloodshed in southern and central
Lebanon was augmented by reports of
about 800 Palestinian casualties at the
hands of Syrian forces in the northern
Lebanese port city of Tripoli this
weekend.
Syrian officials said the shelling

ganization (PLO) attacks on nearby
Syrian outposts.
"I will fight and die here with my

A crippled Soviet attack submarine,
drifting several hundred miles off the
South Carolina coast, may have
become disabled after a collision with
U.S. submarine tracking equipment.
According to The Washington Post,
the nuclear-powered Victor 111 Class
sub may have collided with a sub
tracking buoy towed by the U.S.

Navy frigate USS McCloy. The cable
connecting the tracking device to
the U.S. ship may have become
entwined with the propeller ot the
Soviet vessel.
Authorities advanced this expla
nation when it was revealed that the
McCloy arrived at a Virginia na\al
base Tuesday — minus the cable
and buoy.
U.S. intelligence officials contin
ued to maintain a round-the-clock
watch on the submarine this
weekend, and a Soviet salvage tug is
en route from Cuba to assist the
floundering craft. The U.s
destroyer Peterson is also moving
toward the scene to monitor ac
tivity, according to Navy officials.
Victor 111 Class subs joined the So
viet tleet in 1978 and routinely carry
six torpedos and nuclear-tipped
SSN-15 antisubmarine missiles with
a range of 35 miles. The Soviets
maintain 38 Victor I, II and 111 Class
subs.
Navy officials note that the
stranded sub otters a boon to U.s
intelligence, and one spokesman
added that the approximately 90 So
viet sailors aboard are almost cer
tainly "barfing up their borscht right
now" — a reference to seasickness.
"It would be very uncomfortable

\ truck-bomb parked with a halt
ton of explosives crashed into the Is
raeli military headquarters in southern
Lebanon Friday, leveling the outpost
and killing at least 29 people and
wounding 20.
The Islamic Revolutionary Move
ment — the same group which
claimed responsibility for the Oct.
23 attacks on the U.S. and French
military compounds in Beirut — said
it engineered the attack in Tyre, 45
miles southwest of the capital.
In swift reprisal, Israeli forces
staged air strikes on four targets in
the mountains east of Beirut. Chris
tian Phalange radio said as many as
30 people were killed and 50
wounded in the attacks, which
private radio stations claimed con
sisted of at least 10 bombing sorties
on several artillery positions and
tank concentrations.
The air strikes marked the first Is
raeli attack in Lebanon in 14 months.
Israeli officials said the suicide
driver crashed through roadblocks
and a hail of gunfire from guards as
it sped toward the heavily fortified
two-story headquarters in the early
morning hours. The truck was
stopped by gunfire before it hit the
building but it exploded, leveling
one two-story building and partially
damaging another.

As the United States moved to
withdraw 2300 troops from Grenada
on Friday, White House and Pent
agon officials privately acknowl
edged that they were upset by the
Reagan administration's lack of can
dor in dealing with the invasion of
the island, according to the Associ
ated Press.
Initial reports by the administra
tion insisting that U.S. forces had
invaded the island without inflicting
any civilian casualties were nullified
by Monday's announcement of a
Navy air strike on an unmarked
mental hospital which killed at least
12 people.
Officials described the bombing
as accidental and stressed that
Crenadian soldiers fired upon U.S.
troops from the hospital, located
inside the Fort Frederick military
complex outside the capital of St.
George s.
In other news from Grenada, the
announcement of the hospital bom
bing on Monday coincided with the
lifting of the ban on press coverage
in Grenada. • .
In London, Commonwealth Sec
retary Dir Shridath Kamphal said he
was prepared to send a common
wealth force to replace U.S. troops
within weeks. He stressed that the
paramilitary force would probably
range from 500 to 1000, but would

not be called a "peacekeeping"
force because of the implication that
it might be drawn into fighting.
The commonwealth of former
British colonies, including Grenada,
is a loose confederation of states
that has occasionally intervened
when one of its members has expe
rienced civil strife.
In Washington, both houses of
Congress overwhelmingly approved
legislation invoking the War Powers
Act in response to the president's
military policy in Grenada. Under
the 1973 act, Congress could limit
the stay of U.S. troops on the island
to 90 days.
At a Thursday news conference
Reagan apparently opted for a
switch in semantics, rejecting his
earlier use of "invasion" to describe
U.S. conduct in Grenada in favor of
"rescue mission."
"For heaven's sake," the presi
dent said in response to a reporter's
question that some critics compare
the U.S. intervention in Grenada to
the 1979 Soviet assault on Afghanis
tan.

A Navy commando team fought "a
very pitched battle" with Grenadian
forces to rescue the island's British
governor general two days before U.S.
Marines and Army Rangers landed on

the island, according to a Navy
spokesman.
In an interview with The San
Diego Union, Naval Cmdr. Mike
Sherman said four members of the
Navy SEAL squad — an elite group
specializing in commando tactics
and clandestine operations —
drowned at sea when their boat
capsized off the Grenadian coast
Oct. 23.
Quoting unidentified Navy
sources, the newspaper said the
SEALs crept up a hill to Grenada's
Government House, the mansion
where Gov. Gen. Paul Scoon was
under house arrest. They encoun
tered heavy fire during the initial as
sault and were driven back.
After regrouping, the SEALs ap
parently attacked again, overran the
opposition force and succeeded in
securing the mansion from repeated
Grenadian attacks until U.S.
replacements arrived.
Scoon was safe inside the man
sion, the newspaper said.
Because SEAL operations are
"totally blacked out," according to
Navy sources, news of the raid was
not intended to be made public. The
Union said it accidentally stumbled
upon the incident when it received a
report of a private, unannounced
memorial service for the drowned
servicemen at the Coronado Naval
Amphibious Base chapel near San
Diego.

"Traces of bigotry still mar
America," President Reagan warned
Wednesday upon signing into law
legislation honoring the Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr., with a national
holiday.
An audience of black leaders,
members of Congress and veterans
of the civil rights movement gath
ered in the White House Rose Gar
den to witness the signing cere
mony. The president's remarks — in
which he described King as a man
who "stirred our nation to the very
depths of its soul" — prompted
praise from King's widow, Coretta
Scott King, and other civil rights ac
tivists.
Reagan's decision to approve the
legislation seemed to deviate from
his defense of Sen. Jesse Helms' (R-
N.C.) attempt to block the bill.
Helms launched a filibuster two
weeks ago as part of an effort to
convince the Senate that King "had
ties with communists."

Lebanon's national reconciliation
conference in Geneva, featuring rep

interests be recognized in any
Lebanese settlement.
The conference, which drew to a

Bloodshed in southern and central
Lebanon was augmented by reports of
about 800 Palestinian casualties at the
hands of Syrian forces in the northern
Lebanese port city of Tripoli this
weekend.
Syrian officials said the shelling
and air strikes on the Baddawi
refugee camp and several Palestin
ian military strongholds were a reac
tion to Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization (PLO) attacks on nearby
Syrian outposts.
"I will fight and die here with my
people but will never compromise
on my people's dignity, indepen
dence or rights," PLO chief Yassar
Arafat told the Associated Press at
Baddawi camp, where he is cur
rently supervising PLO strategy.
"They want to end the PLO,"
Aratat said of Syria. "They want to
create an alternative PLO that will be
a puppet in their hands. But I tell
them, I will only bow to God and to
the will of my people."

A crippled Soviet attack submarine,
drifting several hundred miles off the
South Carolina coast, may have
become disabled after a collision with
U.S. submarine tracking equipment.
According to The Washington Post,
the nuclear-powered Victor 111 Class
sub may have collided with a sub
tracking buoy towed by the U.S.

Navy frigate USS McCloy. The cable
connecting the tracking device to
the U.S. ship may have become
entwined with the propeller ot the
Soviet vessel.
Authorities advanced this expla
nation when it was revealed that the
McCloy arrived at a Virginia na\al

and buoy.
