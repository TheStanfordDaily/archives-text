Now it's your turn!
You've been waiting all football season for that Thursday night
phone call, when the voice on the other end says,
"Congratulations, you've been selected as The Daily's Greek of
the Week." Well, your time has finally come.
The Daily is holding its first annual "You Pick 'em" contest. If
you pick the most winners in this Saturday's college football
games, you not only win a dinner for two at a fancy local
restaurant, you also get to make your predictions in The Daily the
following week along with the special Big Game Greek of the
Week.
Look for the entry blanks for this pretigous contest on the sports
pages of tomorrow's Daily.
Don't miss it!
