# FBI investigating Stanford computer break-in
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Ronald Austin, the UCLA sophomore
who infiltrated a Defense Department
computer network, has been connected
to a recent FBI-investigated intrusion
into the University's computer system.
Austin, 19, was arrested Nov. 2 and
has been charged by the Los Angeles
district attorney with cracking computer
systems operated by 14 military, private
and university research instutions. They
were all linked by ARPANET (Advanced
Research Projects Agency Network), a
computer network that, although run
by the Defense Department, does not
contain any military or classified infor
mation.
"ARPANET is about as miltary as a
telephone," explained Brian Reid, assis
tant professor of electrical engineering

and assistant professor at Stanford
Electronics Lab. "You can try to call the
Pentagon on it, sure, but you'll get
about as much access as if you picked
up a phone and dialed.'
Although Austin has not been formal
ly indicted for infiltration of the Stan
ford computer system, Albert Al
bergate, a press spokesman for the Los
Angeles District Attorney's Office, said
a report prepared for the DA's office
proved that Austin broke into the Stan
ford system.
"Austin did infiltrate Stanford,''
Abelard said. "We don't have enough
evidence to press criminal charges, but
it is certainly possible we may charge
him with the Stanford situation it
damage has been done."
Reid said he discovered in mid-
September that someone was illegally

using the Stanford system.
"One morning, just around dawn, I
was at my terminal and I noticed some
one else was using the system," Reid
said. When he discovered no one in the
University was using the computer at
that time, and that the user name he
had seen belonged to a person no
longer affiliated with Stanford, Reid
realized there was an intruder on the
system.
Reid said he contacted the FBI almost
immediately to investigate the situation.
"I decided that if I was going to get
something done I might as well start at
the top," he said.
He then gathered 10 Stanford com
puter science students and set a trap for
the mystery invader. The intruder had
initially set a trap for Stanford hackers,
gaining access to the system with their

unwitting aid.
"Basically, the guy had planted what
is known as a 'Trojan Horse' program/
said Glen Trewitt, one of the students
who helped set the trap. "It works the
same as your classic Trojan Horse.,"
said Trewitt. "He replaced one of our
routine programs that we run every day
with a program that fulfills the same
function, but in addition it gives the in
truder the same power as whoever runs
the program," For example, Trevitt ex
plained, if he unsuspectingly ran the
"Trojan Horse" program, the intruder
would gain the same access to the sys
tem that Trewitt had.
Reid and the 10 students, once thev
became aware ol what the invade
was doing, allowed him to use


Brian Reid
Stanford's system, but constantly
monitored the computer to make
sure nothing was harmed.
"The intruder kept on waiting for
the 'superuser' who had more
power than anyone to run his pro
gram," Trevitt said. (The superuser,
according to Trevitt, is another com
puter). For five days and nights he
stayed on the system, sleeping only
from 7 am until noon and then log
ging back on.
"You'd think that would make the
guy realize we were on to him,"
Trewitt said. "But he kept on
going."
While the invader was waiting for
Stanford to fall into his trap, FBI
agents were tapping the lines he was
using. According to Reid and Al
bergate, Austin first broke into
UCLA's ARPANET, and through
UCLA reached the 14 other comput
er systems he infiltrated. Austin
began calling through Purdue rather
than UCLA. Reid speculated that
Austin realized he was being
watched.
"UCLA was on to him," Reid said,
"So Austin picked a cow-town col
lege that wouldn't figure out he was
messing around with their system."
Stanford eventually told Purdue that
Austin was using their system, Reid
added.
The chase, begun on Sept. 17,
ended on Sept. 21 when the in
truder signed off the system for the
last time. Austin's computer was
seized the following day.
Leonard Bosack, a computer sys
tems specialist in the Computer Sci

ence Department, said Stanford has
no interest in Austin, or any in
truder, now that the invasions have
stopped.
"As long as no one bothers us
anymore, we're happy," he said. FBI
press spokesperson )ohn Holtord,
however confirmed that the investi
gation would continue even without
a request from the University.
"We are still investigating the ille
gal accessing of computers at Stan
ford," Holtord said. "What and who
we are investigating I can't com
ment on."
Reid said he talked to several of
the other 14 institutions hit, includ
ing Cornell and Menlo Park's SRI In
ternational, and none of them had
been approached with the same
vigor used to attack the Stanford
computer.
"Maybe he just figured that since
Stanford had a big name in com
puters, he could get something out
of this," Trewitt said.
"It isn't impossible to make the
system secure," Bosack said, "but
there isn't really a need here for any
drastic measures — we have nothing
to protect."
just because it is possible to break
into the Stanford system, Bosack
said, is no reason for anyone to try
it. Reid agreed with Bosack that the
"glamour" of computer theft was a
media illusion, and that people such
as Austin should be regarded more
as adolescent pranksters.
Bosack feels computer crashers
are more than pranksters — they are
an intolerable nuisance. "Stanford
just is not the place to mess around
with computers, " he said. "If we
catch you doing something you
shouldn't be doing, we're going to
stomp you."

"One morning, just around dawn, I
was at my terminal and I noticed some
one else was using the system," Reid
said. When he discovered no one in the
University was using the computer at
that time, and that the user name he
had seen belonged to a person no
longer affiliated with Stanford, Reid
realized there was an intruder on the
system.
Reid said he contacted the FBI almost
immediately to investigate the situation.
"I decided that if I was going to get
something done I might as well start at
the top," he said.
He then gathered 10 Stanford com
puter science students and set a trap for
the mystery invader. The intruder had
initially set a trap for Stanford hackers,
gaining access to the system with their

unwitting aid.
"Basically, the guy had planted what
is known as a 'Trojan Horse' program/
said Glen Trewitt, one of the students
who helped set the trap. "It works the
same as your classic Trojan Horse.,"
said Trewitt. "He replaced one of our
routine programs that we run every day
with a program that fulfills the same
function, but in addition it gives the in
truder the same power as whoever runs
the program," For example, Trevitt ex
plained, if he unsuspectingly ran the
"Trojan Horse" program, the intruder
would gain the same access to the sys
tem that Trewitt had.
Reid and the 10 students, once thev
became aware ol what the invade
was doing, allowed him to use

Stanford's system, but constantly
monitored the computer to make
sure nothing was harmed.
"The intruder kept on waiting for
the 'superuser' who had more
power than anyone to run his pro
gram," Trevitt said. (The superuser,
according to Trevitt, is another com
puter). For five days and nights he
stayed on the system, sleeping only
from 7 am until noon and then log
ging back on.
"You'd think that would make the
guy realize we were on to him,"
Trewitt said. "But he kept on
going."
While the invader was waiting for
Stanford to fall into his trap, FBI
agents were tapping the lines he was
using. According to Reid and Al
bergate, Austin first broke into
UCLA's ARPANET, and through
UCLA reached the 14 other comput
er systems he infiltrated. Austin
began calling through Purdue rather
than UCLA. Reid speculated that
Austin realized he was being
watched.
"UCLA was on to him," Reid said,
"So Austin picked a cow-town col
lege that wouldn't figure out he was
messing around with their system."
Stanford eventually told Purdue that
Austin was using their system, Reid
added.
The chase, begun on Sept. 17,
ended on Sept. 21 when the in
truder signed off the system for the
last time. Austin's computer was
seized the following day.
Leonard Bosack, a computer sys
tems specialist in the Computer Sci

ence Department, said Stanford has
no interest in Austin, or any in
truder, now that the invasions have
stopped.
"As long as no one bothers us
anymore, we're happy," he said. FBI
press spokesperson )ohn Holtord,
however confirmed that the investi
gation would continue even without
a request from the University.
"We are still investigating the ille
gal accessing of computers at Stan
ford," Holtord said. "What and who
we are investigating I can't com
ment on."
Reid said he talked to several of
the other 14 institutions hit, includ
ing Cornell and Menlo Park's SRI In
ternational, and none of them had
been approached with the same
vigor used to attack the Stanford
computer.
"Maybe he just figured that since
Stanford had a big name in com
puters, he could get something out
of this," Trewitt said.
"It isn't impossible to make the
system secure," Bosack said, "but
there isn't really a need here for any
drastic measures — we have nothing
to protect."
just because it is possible to break
into the Stanford system, Bosack
said, is no reason for anyone to try
it. Reid agreed with Bosack that the
"glamour" of computer theft was a
media illusion, and that people such
as Austin should be regarded more
as adolescent pranksters.
Bosack feels computer crashers
are more than pranksters — they are
an intolerable nuisance. "Stanford
just is not the place to mess around
with computers, " he said. "If we
catch you doing something you
shouldn't be doing, we're going to
stomp you."
Ronald Austin, the UCLA sophomore
who infiltrated a Defense Department
computer network, has been connected
to a recent FBI-investigated intrusion
into the University's computer system.
Austin, 19, was arrested Nov. 2 and
has been charged by the Los Angeles
district attorney with cracking computer
systems operated by 14 military, private
and university research instutions. They
were all linked by ARPANET (Advanced
Research Projects Agency Network), a
computer network that, although run
by the Defense Department, does not
contain any military or classified infor
mation.
"ARPANET is about as miltary as a
telephone," explained Brian Reid, assis
tant professor of electrical engineering

and assistant professor at Stanford
Electronics Lab. "You can try to call the
Pentagon on it, sure, but you'll get
about as much access as if you picked
up a phone and dialed.'
Although Austin has not been formal
ly indicted for infiltration of the Stan
ford computer system, Albert Al
bergate, a press spokesman for the Los
Angeles District Attorney's Office, said
a report prepared for the DA's office
proved that Austin broke into the Stan
ford system.
"Austin did infiltrate Stanford,''
Abelard said. "We don't have enough
evidence to press criminal charges, but
it is certainly possible we may charge
him with the Stanford situation it
damage has been done."

September that someone was illegally
