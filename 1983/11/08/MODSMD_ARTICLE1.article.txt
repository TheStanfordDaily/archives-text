# FBI investigating Stanford computer break-in

### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Ronald Austin, the UCLA sophomore
who infiltrated a Defense Department
computer network, has been connected
to a recent FBI-investigated intrusion
into the University's computer system.
Austin, 19, was arrested Nov. 2 and
has been charged by the Los Angeles
district attorney with cracking computer
systems operated by 14 military, private
and university research instutions. They
were all linked by ARPANET (Advanced
Research Projects Agency Network), a
computer network that, although run
by the Defense Department, does not
contain any military or classified infor
mation.
"ARPANET is about as miltary as a
telephone," explained Brian Reid, assis
tant professor of electrical engineering

and assistant professor at Stanford
Electronics Lab. "You can try to call the
Pentagon on it, sure, but you'll get
about as much access as if you picked
up a phone and dialed.'
Although Austin has not been formal
ly indicted for infiltration of the Stan
ford computer system, Albert Al
bergate, a press spokesman for the Los
Angeles District Attorney's Office, said
a report prepared for the DA's office
proved that Austin broke into the Stan
ford system.
"Austin did infiltrate Stanford,''
Abelard said. "We don't have enough
evidence to press criminal charges, but
it is certainly possible we may charge
him with the Stanford situation it
damage has been done."
Reid said he discovered in mid-
September that someone was illegally

using the Stanford system.
"One morning, just around dawn, I
was at my terminal and I noticed some
one else was using the system," Reid
said. When he discovered no one in the
University was using the computer at
that time, and that the user name he
had seen belonged to a person no
longer affiliated with Stanford, Reid
realized there was an intruder on the
system.
Reid said he contacted the FBI almost
immediately to investigate the situation.
"I decided that if I was going to get
something done I might as well start at
the top," he said.
He then gathered 10 Stanford com
puter science students and set a trap for
the mystery invader. The intruder had
initially set a trap for Stanford hackers,
gaining access to the system with their

unwitting aid.
"Basically, the guy had planted what
is known as a 'Trojan Horse' program/
said Glen Trewitt, one of the students
who helped set the trap. "It works the
same as your classic Trojan Horse.,"
said Trewitt. "He replaced one of our
routine programs that we run every day
with a program that fulfills the same
function, but in addition it gives the in
truder the same power as whoever runs
the program," For example, Trevitt ex
plained, if he unsuspectingly ran the
"Trojan Horse" program, the intruder
would gain the same access to the sys
tem that Trewitt had.
Reid and the 10 students, once thev
became aware ol what the invade
was doing, allowed him to use
