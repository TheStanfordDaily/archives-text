"For heaven's sake."
This was President Reagan's exasperated
response to a reporter's query that some com
pare the recent invasion of Grenada to the So
viet Union's 1979 move into Afghanistan. As the
dust settles, we're beginning to wonder if the
U.S. actions don't justify the analogy.
The administration seems bent on defining
the invasion as it wants it defined, a practice
that is to us eerily reminiscent of totalitarian
practices. We're beginning to wonder what
freedom of information means to the Reagan
administration.
Why, for example, did the president insist at
a press conference last week that the invasion
now be called a "rescue mission?" Both
Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz
earlier referred to the military action as an inva
sion in its early hours.
The most abhorrent aspect of the Reagan's
plan, however, is the restrictions that were
placed on members of the media. For 48 hours
after the invasion the media was denied access
to the battlefield and thus was dependent on
information provided by the military.
The restrictions, which worked famously for
the British during the Falklands War, are,
however, unusual by U.S. standards. The
media has been allowed to join combat troops
on just about every invasion since D-Day, and
restrictions were non-existent during the Viet
nam War.
Apparently motivated by British success, the
administration administered the restrictions.
But as Newsweek points out, "The generals

who now run the Pentagon were colonels in
Vietnam and blame the press in large part for
losing the war."
The result: the media had to depend on in
formation that had been filtered through the
military. And this information has been less
than reliable. The administration said early on
that there had been no civilian casualties in the
fighting. But as the press restrictions were
lifted last week — after almost a week — the
media probed deeper and discovered that at
least 12 people were killed when a bomb hit a a
mental hospital near the capital of St.
George's.
On the home front, the first events covered
by the media were the scenes of the happy
medical students arriving home, praising
Reagan for their rescue. The president could
not have asked for a more sympathetic portrait.
In the wake of the administration's
totalitarian moves, both houses of Congress
overwhelmingly approved legislation invoking
the War Powers Act. Under the act, Congress
could limit the stay of U.S. troops on the island
to 90 days.
In retrospect it is clear that the media restric
tions were completely unwarranted. Even the
British permitted correspondents to land with
their troops in the Falklands and see the action
with their own eyes.
We're tired of having a government that only
gives us half of the story and then even
changes that. There is simply no justification
for keeping the media from covering, and the
public from knowing, the true invasion details.
