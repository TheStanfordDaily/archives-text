# Think about voting
## 
### 
In reporting voter turnout in the recent elec
tions in Argentina and Turkey, the media care
fully noted that in these countries, casting a
ballot is mandatory.
In the United States, voting is a right; forcing
people to go to the polls would violate our
principles of freedom.
Today is an election day, but lines are not ex
pected at the voting booths in this off-year.
Twelve months from now, we will have the op
portunity to mark our ballots for, among other
things, our choice for president.
The right to vote carries with it a responsibil
ity. Namely the duty to be an active participant
in the process — by reading, listening and pon
dering the choices.
A campuswide straw poll conducted in past
weeks indicates that nearly 30 percent of stu
dents here are currently undecided whom they
would vote for if the choices were President

Reagan and Ohio Sen. John Glenn and 22 per
cent are not certain whom they would pick be
tween Reagan and former Vice President Wal
ter Mondale. Since the general election is 12
months in the future, and issues have not yet
been battled out in public debates, maybe the
number of undecideds is a good sign; for many
people, it may be too early to make a decision
other than one based on partisanship.
While a citizen is entitled to choose to not
vote — to make a statement about the quality
or desirability of the candidates by not casting
a ballot, the decision to do that should be
made most carefully. In our system, not choos
ing a candidate is likely to have no effect other
than personal satisfaction.
Choices about voting should be made with
out haste, with gentle consideration, challeng
ing discussion and an abundance of informa
tion. Now is the time to start.
