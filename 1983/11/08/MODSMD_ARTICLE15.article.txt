# Viewpoint: Students for the Presidential Complex at Stanford
## Open letter to President Kennedy 
### 
In your remarks to the Faculty
Senate last week, you stated that a
policy center run by the Hoover In
stitution "would have little chance
of approval by the Board." My ques
tion to you is W/iy?
Hoover proposed the center, and
they already have Reagan's guber
natorial, campaign and transition
papers. They have proved their
ability to r««n a world-class research
center and to raise funds noncom
petitive with other University fun
ding sources. They have demon
strated excellence in the
recruiting for and administration of
one ol America's most prestigious
research programs — the National
Fellows Program, after which the
Reagan Fellows Program would be
modelled. What other single body
on campus is so uniquely qualified?
The Daily (Oct. 28) suggested that
your sentiments derive from con
cern "about the effects of expand
ing Hoover's role and influence on
campus." What do these words
mean? What kind of influence?
Administrative influence?
Hoover's administrative arrange
ment is spelled out clearly in black
and white: Hoover Director Glenn
Campbell reports to you, and
through you to the Board. Such an
arrangement hardly constitutes an
unchecked power structure.
Academic influence? Hoover has
absolutely zero jurisdiction over fac
ulty appointments. Of the 1268
votes in the Academic Council,
Hoover scholars hold about a
dozen, and they are not even
represented in the Academic Sen
ate. Hoover has less power than the
Classics Department.
Intellectual influence? This, I
believe, is the crux of the matter.
Operating under the misperception
that Hoover is an ideological
monolith, critics are using
"academic freedom'' as the rationale
for denying the freedom of research
and expression of those who hold

views other than their own. Is this
responsible scholarship?
Critics are also attacking Hoover's
"role" at Stanford. Intrigued by
their lack of specificity, I decided to
consider the issue further. Five
minutes of research revealed what
The Daily has conveniently managed
to overlook for more than eight
months. Namely, Hoover's role at
Stanford is one of unparalleled ;n
-teraction with students.
At what other department can stu
dents freely access a world
renowned archives or attend
monthly "Tower Talks" on a variety
of issues? What other department
can deliver Nobel Laureates like Mil
ton Friedman, Kenneth Arrow,
George Stigler and Freidrich Hayek
to a sherry hour or faculty dinner? At
what other university could an un
declared freshman secure a lunch
date with Admiral lames Stockdale
or a crackpot columnist like myself
obtain an interview with Edward Tel
ler? Seventeen Hoover scholars
teach in some capacity in a variety of
departments and schools here at
Stanford.
Let us not delude ourselves. If a
senior majoring in political science
walked into SRI or Brookings to dis
cuss his honors thesis on
Reaganomics with a senior fellow,
they would show him the door with
all due haste. But here, because of
our relationship with Hoover, that
same student gets a three-hour
lunch with Martin Anderson.
It is dismaying that the Hoover
issue has devolved into an "us" vs.
"them" situation — Stanford vs.
Hoover — and many of those who
perpetuate this deliberate distortion
have never set a foot in the Tower.
Hoover is an integral part of Stan
ford, a rich resource about which
we should be proud and which we
should utilize rather than criticize.
I defend the Institution for the
same reason we have public
defenders in our judicial system —

to assure that the accused is granted
a fair trial based on informed, ra
tional examination of the facts. This
approach, I believe, demonstrates
without a doubt that Hoover's
"influence" exists only in the minds
of its critics, and that its role is one
that benefits all students.
I look to you as President of the
University to provide those ele
ments which absence has rendered
the current controversy unworthy of
an institution as respected as Stan
ford: specificity, consistency, objec
tivity and rationality.
