Yes on ROTC
I would like to suggest that such
a myopic view as that presented in
Thursday's editorial (Daily, Nov. 2)
is irresponsible, for several reasons.
First, it implies military science
should not be considered an aca
demic subject. However, the edito
rial incorrectly assumes military
science is the study of "killing
people more efficiently": I think
karate could just as easily (and
naively) be classified as that, yet it
receives academic credit.
Second, the editorial implies that
the military doesn't belong on an
academic campus. I don't know
where the editorial board would
have them go to receive an educa
tion. An ignorant military is not a
good idea — in fact, it would be
dangerous. An uneducated military
certainly would not bring interna
tional peace any more quickly.
Limiting military education to
Department of Defense-run military
academies would lead to a narrow
minded, parochial, and isolated
officer corps to run the military.
Wouldn't it be far better to have a
military, such as we have today,
that reflects the values of the soci
ety it is supposed to be able to
defend?
Third, in a broader sense the

editorial implies that we should
have no military at all. I agree that it
would be nice not to have to worry
about Armageddon, or any smaller
conflicts that might occur between
now and then, but eliminating the
military won't eliminate the causes
of those conflicts.

Minority opinion
While I am not a spokesperson
for any one minority group, as a
minority student I wish to express
my support for the Grenada inva
sion. Any efforts to minimize the
influence of the Cubans/Russians in
this hemisphere are warranted.
Those who expressed dismay and
anger at the use of force by the
United States don't seem to be
facing up to the reality of the situa
tion. The bulk of resistance met by
our troops was not from
"indigenous" Grenadians but
Cuban soldiers bent on using
Grenada as a base for further
operations.
It would be better journalism if
you didn't just lump all minorities
into one headline (Daily, Nov. 2), as
we are not all a homogenous mass
with the same opinion on world

events.

Kudos for Juilland
I am writing to thank Professor
Alphonse juilland for arranging the
republication in The Daily
(Thursday, Nov. 3) of the editorial
from the San Diego Union.
I must admit to having a rather
conservative policy with respect to
newspapers — I try to read only
those that engage in responsible,
well-documented, professional
journalism. Alas, then, I do not
read many! So I am prone to forget
how dreadful and irresponsible
they can be. Thank goodness that
Professor juilland has a stronger
stomach, and that he stands (or sits)
with scissors poised and check
book at the ready, ever willing to
pay so that his colleagues may
share the products of his vigilant
scanning of the more scurrilous
representatives of the nation's
press.
In these days when so many
people cause injury to their fellows,
when violence and vice endanger
our daily lives, his hobby stands as
a strange — but relatively harmless
— one.
