Education seems to be a pretty big deal these days (or
at least I'll say it is — I have to write a column). Stories
abound concerning the small sparks of transcendent
learning amid the great swamp of illiterate America.
These are notable, mostly because public education
defines American values.
Now, the school, by its very nature, defines social
values. This is one of its most important functions, to
help the individual learn to deal with others. Fine.
But one must ask the question, "What about individ
ual values, and who defines these individual values?" A
tough question, mostly because the old "definer" of
individual values — the family — is a battered unit. The
problem with schools today is that parents, unwilling or
unable to set models for their children, have trans
ferred the responsibility to the schools, which cannot
handle the burden.
How about a hypothetical case?
A kid comes out of a slightly broken home. Maybe
his parent(s) want to send him to a parochial/private
school, but they can't afford it. So he's bused to a
public school in another neighborhood far away, and
that school doesn't have a prayer time (not to force him
to pray, but to remind him if he wants to — he's only a
kid). His friends are nice, but they are a mish-mash of
immature culture, and they grow together into a
monochromatic army of New Wave videophiles.
Maybe it's not that bad, but the point is, when
children have nothing to grab onto, they roll with the
flow. And as family religion, moral values, etc., are
coerced away from young people, individual character
becomes more vulnerable.

coerced! Ves. The system coerces the poor and even
the middle class into the public system. Think about it.
Idea: tax breaks for parents who send kids to paroc
hial/private schools.
What a very cool idea. Aside from helping poorer
parents make intelligent choices concerning the ways
they want their children to be brought up, the resulting
flow could lead to a smaller Department of Education
(and small government equals good government). As
suming an equal commitment by government to educa
tion, higher salaries for teachers could also result.
Funding? Billions and billions in national debt means
that anything is possible. This shouldn't be an issue.
But would this solution push the burden of private
values on the schools just like everything else is?
Maybe, but it seems that if we get back to some individ
ual beliefs through schools designed to instruct in
more subjects than the three Rs, then those beliefs may
affect the families of the next generation. Maybe
people will start to take more responsibility upon them
selves, instead of putting that responsibility on the
shoulders of Uncle Sam or Public School No. 271.
Maybe the family will start to define individual values
all over again.
But the high priests of culture point to the dangers
caused by folks who promote set beliefs, like Liberty
Baptist College students (who curiously do not riot
when speakers approach their auditorium's podium).
The high priests are paranoid.
And pluralism will only work in a society whose indi
viduals possess a spine.
