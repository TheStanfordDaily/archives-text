# Res Ed warns 2 fraternities regarding hazing practices
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Row Housing Director Diana Con
klin has sent warning letters against
practices that "constituted hazing"
to the Kappa Alpha (KA) and Delta
Upsilon (DU) fraternities.
Conklin said that from reports she
had seen, practices that "sounded
to me like hazing" were taking place
at the two fraternities. She would
not elaborate on the specific in
stances to which she referred in the
letters, but she said she expects the
two fraternities to "stop hazing."
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
student affairs for Residential Educa
tion, said if hazing practices
"persisted" there is a possibility that
the University would take punitive
actions against the two fraternities.
The presidents of both fraternities

refused to discuss the warning let
ters.
According to Conklin, hazing is
any practice which "intends to
cause injury or embarrassment."
She said each fraternity was cited for
different acts of hazing under this
definition, and that this matter was
private between herself and the
fraternities involved.
Hazing is a violation of University
rules and state law, Conklin said.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
student affairs for Residential Educa
tion, said hazing is any action which
"can be construed as likely to cause
physical or psychological harm (to
an individual)."
Luke Cole, president of the DUs,
would not comment on the content
of the letter, calling it a "private
matter between the DUs and resi

dential housing."
Jonathan Rief, president of the
KAs, also refused to comment until
he has discussed the matter with
housing officials.
Conklin said that because these
two fraternities were singled out, it
doesn't mean that similar practices
aren't taking place at other frater
nities. "These were the two that
came to our attention," Conklin
said.
Woody Torrence, resident assis
tant for the KAs, declined to com
ment on what action he would take
should he observe hazing in the
future, calling it a "hypothetical
question." He said only that the let
ter was addressed to a house officer
and he was not directly in a position
to comment on the exact content of
the letter.
