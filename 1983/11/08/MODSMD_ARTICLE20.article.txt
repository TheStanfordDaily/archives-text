## On the Mark Mark Zeigler USC's Tollner is a nice guy

Los Angeles — The last thing you'd expect USC Head
Coach Ted Tollner to be is a football coach.
Tollner looks like a family man. Father of two, one boy
and one girl. Works in the city by day, drives home to be
with the wife and kids at night. The kind of guy who makes
a "real" fire in the fireplace. Artificial logs won't do.
You'd expect Tollner to spend his weekends mowing
the lawn, cleaning out the garage and playing catch with
his son. He cuts the turkey at Thankgiving and his kids get
straight 'A's in school.
And every now and then, Tollner piles the gang into the
family station wagon and takes them to a movie. After
wards, he treats them to ice cream.

But while Tollner probably is every bit the family man he
seems, he certainly doesn't spend his Saturday's behind
the lawnmower. Ted Tollner is a football coach.
Tollner coaches at USC, where football is everything
and everything is football. Winning is not just expected,
it's assumed. You lose and you get criticized. Or fired.
When Tollner was named head honcho in Troy last year,
he was following in the footsteps of some pretty big
names.
The man he replaced went 67-14-2 in seven years, in
cluding five trips to bowl games. His name is John Robin
son, who now coaches the National Football League's Los
Angeles Rams.
Before Robinson was another great coach. In 16 years,
he was 1-27-40-8 and w en tig. nine .tiayd.iia iDfi i>,. Hbui am e is

|ohn McKay and he now coaches for NFL's Tampa Bay Buc
caneers.
In nine games as the Trojans' head coach, Tollner is 4-4-
1. Before beating Cal and Stanford in the last two weeks,
USC was 2-4-1 and the victory-spoiled Trojan fans wanted
more than his job. They wanted his head.
"You know," Tollner told a group of reporters after last
Saturday's 30-7 win over Stanford, "there's no time to
think about who was there before you. There's so much to
do with the job itself.
"I haven't had a chance to sit back and look at it (my
performance). It (the job) is so encompassing whether
you're at San Diego State or here. Only there's more
criticism here."
The criticism, to say the least, has been vicious. There
were the headlines. "USC finds balanced offense: no run,
no pass" appeared in the Los Angeles Times. There were
also the letters to the editor. They weren't exactly subtle.
"No one like to be criticized, but you can't do anything
about it," Tollner said. "I just don't read that stuff. For me,
I'm frustrated that my team is not playing at the level it's
capable of playing at. I still believe we have more to offer
than we've shown this year and I'm not going to get
caught up in the negative things."
When Tollner says something he means it. He's honest
and straight-forward. You watch him coach and hear him
speak and come away with the same impression time and
again. You have to like him.
Tollner's not like the other coaches in the Pacific-10
Conference or anywhere else in the country for that mat
ter. He seems out of place. He's so innocent, so truthful
that you wonder if he's ever told a lie.
"There aren't a lot of magic secrets to being successful
in football," Tollner is quoted as saying in the USC football
press guide. "It's a people business. You want coaches
and players who have the kind of character traits that are
critical — honest, hard-working people who care for each
other.
"The coaches must understand the game thoroughly, of
course, but they must also be good teachers. If you under
stand the game and can't teach it, you don't have a
chance."
Above all, Tollner is down to earth. He knows he was se
lected for the head coaching job at a school with such a
rich football tradition for a reason — he's a damn good
football coach. But he also knows he is a human being —
he's not perfect.
"There's always room for improvement, just like any
other job," he said when discussing the criticism he's
received this season.
Tollner grew up in the shadow of Stanford Stadium and
played football at Palo Alto and Cubberley High Schools.
As as youth, he worshipped Stanford football. "I'd jump
over the (stadium) fence until I was old enough to sell hot
dogs and do that stuff."
He has coached at both the high school and college
level, logging years as an assistant coach at Brigham Young
University and San Diego State. He also was the head man
a few miles from the Stanford campus at Woodside High,
where in four years he went 30-4-1.
Although USC could end the 1983 season with its first
losing record in 22 years, the Trojans will be back to win
ning form next year under the Tollner's tutelage.
Ted Tollner minds his 'P's and 'Q's. He also knows his
„X's and '.O's.- -
