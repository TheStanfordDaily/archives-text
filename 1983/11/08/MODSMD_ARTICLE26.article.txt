With the emergence of
new psychedelia on the
music scene, Echo and the
Bunnymen is a band worth
hearing. The Bunnvmen
(lan McCulloch—vocals,
guitars; Will Sergeant —
guitars; Les Pattinson —
bass; Pete de Freitas —
drums) deliver insistent,
hard-edged music that
blends the manic, un
focused sound of the 1960s
psychedelic era with the
precise, programmed
sound of the '80s.
The result produces
music contained on a 5-
song EP, Echo and the Bun
nymen. The EP is a good
sampling of this band's
music, since four of the five
songs have been released
on previous Echo albums
("Rescue" and "Do it
Clean" from the album
Crocodiles; "The Cutter"
and "Back of Love" from
the album Porcupine).
The one new song is the
featured release which
opens the EP, "Never

Stop." From the string bass
introduction into the crash
ing drum and xylophone
accompaniment backing
strong power chord guitar
work, "Never Stop" is a
song that makes one take
account of the instrumental
mixture used to create a
song that deals with love:
"Measure by measure,
drop by drop/ A pound for
pound when taking stock'
Above the treasures still
unlocked/ The love you
found must never stop."
The unusual blend of
musical sounds together
with pleading vocals bv
McCulloch draw attention
to Echo and the Bunnymen.
"The Cutter" provides a
synthesized bagpipes feel
to a song about com
promising oneself: "Will I
still recoil when the skin is
lost/ Will I still be soiled
when the dirt is off."
The EP closes appropri
ately with a live version of
"Do it Clean" recorded this
summer at the Roval Albert

Concert Hall in London.
Here McCulloch's vocals,
backed heavily by de
Freitas' drums, emphasize
the dangerous turbulence
and emotional impact
infused by the Bunnymen
in all their music.
