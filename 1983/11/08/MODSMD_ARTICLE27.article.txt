The band's name and origin are as
obscure as the songs they play.
"Femme" in Milwaukee slang is a
sissy or weakling. They are sick of
this "femme" stereotype and are
willing to get violent about it.

don Gano on stage, you'll un
derstand. They are sick of this
femme" stereotype and are
willing to get violent about it.
Although they vent their ag
gression musically, this outlet
does not result in the usual
punk political and social com
mentary.
This does not mean that
they refrain from making any
commentary whatsoever (they
dedicated their song
"Confessions" to the acciden
tal bombing of the mental
hospital on Grenada); their
songs just don't revolve
around such temporal
themes. Their subject matter
is more timeless; they sing
about their personal disap
pointment and rejection. They
fuse their intelligent lyrics and
bare, wailing melodies into

vvh.it they tall "lolkpunk
skitlleriu k": a minimalist,
bluesy sound, every hit as
angry anil desperate as their
name suggosts.
I hey also have an interest
ing history, l.ano (lead vocals
and guitars) met Brian "Spot"
Ritchie (bass and votals) at a
Milwaukee punk ilub betore
Ins high school's National
Honor Society awards cere
mony. l.ano was s< heduled to
entertain, so he asked Ritchie
to back him up. They
practiced that night, but when
Gordon came by in his three-

piece-suit the next day, he
found Brian dressed in ripped
up jeans. They decided to play
together anyway. They tried to
start out slow and casual, but
eventually broke into "Give
Me the Car," a song about
Gano asking his dad for the
use of his car on a date, and all
of the things that he plans to
do with it.
The students went wild, as if
they were the Beatles or the
Who singing a well-known fa
vorite. Gano was thrown out
of the Honor Society and
some teachers wanted to
recall his diploma. Victor
DeLorenzo, the drummer,
joined them later but has
already acquired some
recognition for his mastery of
the upside-down washbucket.
Many of the band's early ap

pearances were as spon
taneous as the first. They will
play tor lines of people waiting
outside of the movie theaters,
and rock concerts, playing
their music for music's sake.
One of these impromptu per
formances exposed them to
Chrissie Hynde and the late
James Honeyman-Scott of the
Pretenders, who were suffi
ciently amused and impressed
to ask them to open their Mil
waukee show that night, at the
same theater they had just
heen playing in front of for
free.
Their most recent engage
ment was a European tour,
leading off for the group Aztec
Camera. Their stage presence
and sound have improved
remarkably from this experi
ence, and by the end of their
current U.S. tour, they will
have recorded their second al
bum as well as a few videos.
The crowd reacted well to
the news that they were going
to film the video to their cur
rent single "Gone Daddy
Cone" that night at the
Berkeley Square. If they use
any of the footage from the
concert Halloween night, it
will almost certainly be a hot
video. They couldn't have
asked for a more receptive au
dience.
How many times have you
seen a club turn on the lights
to tell everyone that the con
cert really is over? The crowd
kept clapping for three
minutes after that tactic until
the Violent Femmes returned
to the stage. The band insisted
that they leave the house
lights up and the stage lights
off because, as Cordon Cano
said "then we can see you for
a change." Don't worry about
it Gordon, you'll be welcomed
back anytime.

The crowd reacted well to
the news that they were going
to film the video to their cur
rent single "Gone Daddy
Cone" that night at the
Berkeley Square. If they use
any of the footage from the
concert Halloween night, it
will almost certainly be a hot
video. They couldn't have
asked for a more receptive au
dience.
How many times have you
seen a club turn on the lights
to tell everyone that the con
cert really is over? The crowd
kept clapping for three
minutes after that tactic until
the Violent Femmes returned
to the stage. The band insisted
that they leave the house
lights up and the stage lights
off because, as Cordon Cano
said "then we can see you for
a change." Don't worry about
it Gordon, you'll be welcomed
back anytime.

Although they vent their ag

does not result in the usual
punk political and social com
mentary.
This does not mean that
they refrain from making any
commentary whatsoever (they
dedicated their song
"Confessions" to the acciden
tal bombing of the mental
hospital on Grenada); their
songs just don't revolve
around such temporal
themes. Their subject matter
is more timeless; they sing
about their personal disap
pointment and rejection. They

bare, wailing melodies into

Ritchie (bass and votals) at a

entertain, so he asked Ritchie
to back him up. They
practiced that night, but when
Gordon came by in his three-

piece-suit the next day, he
found Brian dressed in ripped
up jeans. They decided to play
together anyway. They tried to
start out slow and casual, but
eventually broke into "Give
Me the Car," a song about
Gano asking his dad for the
use of his car on a date, and all
of the things that he plans to
do with it.
The students went wild, as if
they were the Beatles or the
Who singing a well-known fa
vorite. Gano was thrown out
of the Honor Society and
some teachers wanted to
recall his diploma. Victor
DeLorenzo, the drummer,
joined them later but has
already acquired some
recognition for his mastery of
the upside-down washbucket.
Many of the band's early ap

pearances were as spon
taneous as the first. They will
play tor lines of people waiting
outside of the movie theaters,
and rock concerts, playing
their music for music's sake.
One of these impromptu per
formances exposed them to
Chrissie Hynde and the late
