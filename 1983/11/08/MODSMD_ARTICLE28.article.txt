# Aaron Persky: Extended Play
## We need a responsible concert system 
### 
The sad saga of rock concerts at Stanford took a
new twist early this fall when University President
Donald Kennedy issued a moratorium on all future
shows. Kennedy's action, which came as a direct
result of the multiple arrests and ensuing bad press
from the Grateful Dead show last August, put a
merciful end to last year's concert system.
The Committee on Contemporary Entertainment
(CoCE) will attempt to institute a new system this
year, ostensibly having learned something from the
last two organizational fiascos: the old Special
Events and the recent student group arrangement.
The Committee will address the fundamental ques
j tion of whether Stanford students can operate a suc
cessful concert program here, providing learning

Last year's set-up resulted in a high level of mediocrity
in concert promotion. The example of Special Events
showed the liability of high personnel turnover from
year to year, and the CoCE masochistically increased
the turnover so that the people involved changed from
show to show. No concert system can survive here
without sound, experienced student leadership. The
CoCE plan overreacted to the debilitating failure of
Special Events.

opportunities and avoiding bankruptcy at the same
time.
The c heckered past of the ASSU's Special Events
should serve as a warning to all who underestimate
the problems involved with concert promotion. Spe
cial Events managed to lose more than $90,000 in
1979-80, its final year of operation. The ASSU Senate,
unwilling to continue this deficit financing, voted to
terminate the existence of the student-run organiza
tion and ordered a study done on the reasons for
failure.
The following research revealed some interesting
facts. Certain shows could not have turned a profit
even if they had sold out. Bookkeeping looked like
the work of a fourth grader discovering new math.
As Special Events got deeper and deeper into a fin
ancial quagmire, its fearless leaders decided to do
even more shows in an attempt to recover from their
earlier disasters. The directors of Special Events had
almost complete autonomy in their actions and were
not held accountable for their indiscretions. Im
agine how much fun they must have had overpaying
their favorite rock stars.
In hindsight it is easy to criticize Special Events,
yet it did provide a very valuable,service to the Stan
(jprd community. Student involvement in all facets of
Concert promotion was high, and the higher-ups in

the organization gained exceptional experience in
the musicbusiness. However, the program lived and
died on the merits of its handful of directors. Low
accountability meant that Special Events had to
police itself, which was problematic since personnel
changed every year.
Two years of reflection by the CoCE on the Special
Events debacle led to the formation of a new system
whereby any student group could propose to put on
a concert. The CoCE would judge the merits of
proposals based on the perceived financial sound
ness of the venture. This new system had two major
aims: to lower the risk associated with concerts and
to open concert promotion to any interested and
qualified student group.

In the first regard the CoCE favored co
promotion, that is, having an outside promoter or
ganize the concert and assume responsibility for
profit or loss. Student groups saw in this new ar
rangement a way to make money, and the outside
promoter, usually Bill Graham Presents (BGP),
recognized a chance to penetrate the Peninsula con
cert market.
Unfortunately the CoCE's best-laid plans did not
produce a working system. Letting different student
groups do concerts meant that each one was prone
to the same beginner's mistakes. The CoCE concert
guidelines were so general that they left student
groups confused about their specific responsibili
ties; the natural reaction was to cede major tasks to
the co-promoter and to the University's administra
tive bodies. The system rewarded the wrong behav
ior; groups wanted to cash in on a risk-free venture
while relegating learning about concert promotion
to secondary status.
Last year's set-up resulted in a high level of
mediocrity in concert promotion. The example of
Special Events showed the liability of high personnel
turnover from year to year, and the CoCE maso
chisticalK increased the turnover so that the people
involved changed from show to show. No concert
system can survive here without sound, ex

perienced student leadership. The CoCE plan over
reacted to the debilitating failure of Special Events.
The ASSU should resurrect Special Events, but
cr'eate structured rules which it must follow. Each
student position in the new Special Events should be
clearly defined, and an effort should be made to
groom younger undergraduates for positions of in
creasing responsibility. The ASSU Financial Manager
would be responsible for making sure that the pro
gram would not lose money.
This is not as difficult as it sounds. The new or
ganization could begin slowly, co-promoting with
BCP to minimize financial risk. As soon as enough
revenue is generated the new group could un
dertake small shows, provided that an overall pro
gram deficit could be avoided even in a worst case
scenario. Gradually the new Special Events could
wean itself off co-promotion and begin to assume
full responsibility for the success or failure of its
shows. Losing money on a particular show is not
anathema as long as the loss does not jeopardize the
entire operation.
Even if the group is on a break-even footing after
five years of operation, the program could be con
sidered successful. Students would have learned a
lot, and the Stanford community would have had
consistent contemporary entertainment on campus.
Stanford has great concert facilities, including Frost
Amphitheatre, which Bill Graham called "one of the
most beautiful of its type in the world".
We need not look at BGP solely as a competitive
nemesis, for the simple reason that it will always be
willing to co-promote shows here and assume much
of the risk involved. The new Special Events could al
ternate between cooperation and competition with
outside promoters depending on its financial health.
In addition the ASSU could allow University Events
and Services to put on concerts during vacations and
in the summertime, charging a franchise fee for a
percentage of profits.
The CoCE is currently evaluating last year's con
cert system and will soon entertain new proposals
for concert promotion at Stanford. Two things seem
necessary to the success of a system; it must provide
the proper checks and incentives to ensure that con
certs are competently run, and it should maximize
student involvement in every step of the concert
process. Concerts at Stanford should become a
learning experience and not a means to financial
ends.

groups do concerts meant that each one was prone
to the same beginner's mistakes. The CoCE concert
guidelines were so general that they left student
groups confused about their specific responsibili
ties; the natural reaction was to cede major tasks to
the co-promoter and to the University's administra
tive bodies. The system rewarded the wrong behav
ior; groups wanted to cash in on a risk-free venture
while relegating learning about concert promotion
to secondary status.
Last year's set-up resulted in a high level of
mediocrity in concert promotion. The example of
Special Events showed the liability of high personnel
turnover from year to year, and the CoCE maso
chisticalK increased the turnover so that the people
involved changed from show to show. No concert
system can survive here without sound, ex

perienced student leadership. The CoCE plan over
reacted to the debilitating failure of Special Events.
The ASSU should resurrect Special Events, but
cr'eate structured rules which it must follow. Each
student position in the new Special Events should be
clearly defined, and an effort should be made to
groom younger undergraduates for positions of in
creasing responsibility. The ASSU Financial Manager
would be responsible for making sure that the pro
gram would not lose money.
This is not as difficult as it sounds. The new or
ganization could begin slowly, co-promoting with
BCP to minimize financial risk. As soon as enough
revenue is generated the new group could un
dertake small shows, provided that an overall pro
gram deficit could be avoided even in a worst case
scenario. Gradually the new Special Events could
wean itself off co-promotion and begin to assume
full responsibility for the success or failure of its
shows. Losing money on a particular show is not
anathema as long as the loss does not jeopardize the
entire operation.
Even if the group is on a break-even footing after
five years of operation, the program could be con
sidered successful. Students would have learned a
lot, and the Stanford community would have had
consistent contemporary entertainment on campus.
Stanford has great concert facilities, including Frost
Amphitheatre, which Bill Graham called "one of the
most beautiful of its type in the world".
We need not look at BGP solely as a competitive
nemesis, for the simple reason that it will always be
willing to co-promote shows here and assume much
of the risk involved. The new Special Events could al
ternate between cooperation and competition with
outside promoters depending on its financial health.
In addition the ASSU could allow University Events
and Services to put on concerts during vacations and
in the summertime, charging a franchise fee for a
percentage of profits.
The CoCE is currently evaluating last year's con
cert system and will soon entertain new proposals
for concert promotion at Stanford. Two things seem
necessary to the success of a system; it must provide
the proper checks and incentives to ensure that con
certs are competently run, and it should maximize
student involvement in every step of the concert
process. Concerts at Stanford should become a
learning experience and not a means to financial
ends.

The sad saga of rock concerts at Stanford took a
new twist early this fall when University President
Donald Kennedy issued a moratorium on all future
shows. Kennedy's action, which came as a direct
result of the multiple arrests and ensuing bad press
from the Grateful Dead show last August, put a
merciful end to last year's concert system.
The Committee on Contemporary Entertainment
(CoCE) will attempt to institute a new system this
year, ostensibly having learned something from the
last two organizational fiascos: the old Special
Events and the recent student group arrangement.
The Committee will address the fundamental ques

opportunities and avoiding bankruptcy at the same
time.
The c heckered past of the ASSU's Special Events
should serve as a warning to all who underestimate
the problems involved with concert promotion. Spe
cial Events managed to lose more than $90,000 in
1979-80, its final year of operation. The ASSU Senate,
unwilling to continue this deficit financing, voted to
terminate the existence of the student-run organiza
tion and ordered a study done on the reasons for
failure.
The following research revealed some interesting
facts. Certain shows could not have turned a profit
even if they had sold out. Bookkeeping looked like
the work of a fourth grader discovering new math.
As Special Events got deeper and deeper into a fin
ancial quagmire, its fearless leaders decided to do
even more shows in an attempt to recover from their
earlier disasters. The directors of Special Events had
almost complete autonomy in their actions and were
not held accountable for their indiscretions. Im
agine how much fun they must have had overpaying
their favorite rock stars.
In hindsight it is easy to criticize Special Events,
yet it did provide a very valuable,service to the Stan
(jprd community. Student involvement in all facets of
Concert promotion was high, and the higher-ups in

the organization gained exceptional experience in
the musicbusiness. However, the program lived and
died on the merits of its handful of directors. Low
accountability meant that Special Events had to
police itself, which was problematic since personnel
changed every year.
Two years of reflection by the CoCE on the Special
Events debacle led to the formation of a new system
whereby any student group could propose to put on
a concert. The CoCE would judge the merits of
proposals based on the perceived financial sound
ness of the venture. This new system had two major
aims: to lower the risk associated with concerts and
to open concert promotion to any interested and
qualified student group.

In the first regard the CoCE favored co
promotion, that is, having an outside promoter or
ganize the concert and assume responsibility for
profit or loss. Student groups saw in this new ar
rangement a way to make money, and the outside
promoter, usually Bill Graham Presents (BGP),
recognized a chance to penetrate the Peninsula con
cert market.
