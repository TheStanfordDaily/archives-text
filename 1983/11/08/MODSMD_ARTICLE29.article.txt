# 'Coyote Ugly' good in spite of itself
## 
### MIKE HALE 
Shamans are in this year,
particularly female ones.
Adele Edling Shank's The
Crass House, currently
premiering at the Magic
Theatre, gives us a young,
mellow woman named
Serenity who actually calls
herself a shaman, and who
performs weddings and has
visions. Across the bay, at
Berkeley Stage Company,
an altogether different kind
of female mystic is on dis
play, one who is called a
shaman only in the pro
gram notes; this is an indi
cation of why Lynn Siefert's
Coyote Ugly, despite the
absurdities of its plot and
conception, is by far the
more appealing play.
Coyote Ugly (originally
presented at Yale in 1982,
and being given its West
Coast premiere at Berkeley
Stage Co.) is the sort of play
you would imagine a
female Sam Shepard might
write. It concerns a weird,
shabby, incestuous family
living somewhere in the
Arizona desert, and it's
heavy on psychic violence
and strange ritual. The ac
tion all takes place inside a
rundown house (evoked, in
Ariel's Alien-like set, by
several pieces of vaguely
organic furniture and back
drops painted like claws),
except for one exceedingly
bizarre scene out in the
desert. In the house
Andreas (a woman) and
Red live with 12-year-old
Scarlet, who appears to be
their daughter. Scarlet, for
reasons unknown, has a
crick in her neck, and she
likes to go out in the desert
and talk to Coyote (God)
and do voodoo-like things
with bones and rocks.
Andreas screams a lot,
stalks around the house,
and is afraid of her
daughter; Red, a mechanic,
brags a lot and thinks of
nothing but cars and sex.
He's afraid of his daughter
and his wife. Into this love
ly home stumble Dowd and
Penny, newly married;
Dowd, who hasn't been
home for 12 years, is Red
and Andreas' son; Penny,

of course, is a prude. The
play works itself out in
grand revelation style, as
we discover what the
relationships really are, and
Scarlet practices her
various forms of witchcraft
on everyone.
Coyote Ugly is a hard
play to take seriously: The
characters are howling
1980s stereotypes of the
Western-mystical school,
and the play as a whole is
so portentous that half the
time all you can do is snigger
at it. But it's never boring, it
doesn't take itself too
seriously, and it's often
hilarious — crudely, gut
bustingly funny in a way
very few literary products
are these days. How often
these days do you go to a
respected, "avant-garde"
theater company and hear a
line like, "He asked me,
'Can you make a U-turn?,'
and I said, 'No, but I can
make her eyes bulge!' "
You expect only the best
writers — a Mamet or a
Shepard — to get away with
lines like that, but Seifert
throws them in throughout
Coyote Ugly, and they al
ways work.
The above joke is
delivered by Red, the fa
ther; Red is the play's most
peripheral character, but in
this production Andrew
Jackson Adams makes him
the heart of the play. Red
di r opears for a while
during the middle of the
play, and when Adams
came back on stage in the
second act the whole audi
ence shifted forward in an
ticipation. His depiction of
the common man — a lover
of cars and consumer of
women — was convincing,
and perfectly timed: Adams
seemed to enjoy his lines
so much that he held onto
them all until the last mo
ment, dropping them on us
like bombshells. Roberta
Callahan did probably the
best job possible as
Andreas, an impossible
part; she managed to make
an unbelieveable scream
ing harpy funny most of the
time.

ther; Red is the play's most
peripheral character, but in
this production Andrew
Jackson Adams makes him
the heart of the play. Red
di r opears for a while
during the middle of the
play, and when Adams
came back on stage in the
second act the whole audi
ence shifted forward in an
ticipation. His depiction of
the common man — a lover
of cars and consumer of
women — was convincing,
and perfectly timed: Adams
seemed to enjoy his lines
so much that he held onto
them all until the last mo
ment, dropping them on us
like bombshells. Roberta
Callahan did probably the
best job possible as
Andreas, an impossible
part; she managed to make
an unbelieveable scream
ing harpy funny most of the
time.
