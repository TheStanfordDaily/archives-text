# Engineering reviews requirements
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The School of Engineering is reevaluating its under
graduate program for the first time in 16 years in
response to complaints from students that the program
has too many requirements.
The school's Undergraduate Council, composed of
24 professors, has established several committees to
discuss the program with students, faculty, alumni and
representatives from industry.
A task force may suggest changes in the program
when it reports during winter quarter.
At least 156 of the 180 units required for a bachelor's
degree in engineering have to meet the school's and
the University's requirements.
An engineering undergraduate has to take 45 units of
math and science courses, 36 units in his or her major
and 36 units of engineering courses outside his or her
major.
Engineering students entering after 1982 are required
to take 15 units of Western Culture courses, at least six
units of writing courses, 12 to 20 units of courses from
areas 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the distribution requirement and
12 to 15 units of a foreign language.
Gil Masters, the school's associate dean for student
relations, said the undergraduate program is too
restrictive.
"The curriculum is very tight for engineering stu

dents. It makes it difficult for them to go to the over
seas campuses and to take advantage of the other pro
gram offerings," Masters said.
lames Adams, associate dean for academic affairs,
presented three possible reforms of the school's un
dergraduate program to the Undergraduate Council at
its meeting Friday.
The suggested reforms call for:
—Reducing to 18 from 36 the number of units of en
gineering courses a student has to take outside his
major.
—Requiring 90 units of engineering courses and let
ting departments decide the distribution of the units.
— Requiring 90 units of engineering courses but
giving the Undergraduate Council power to determine
the distribution of the units.
Adams said these possiblities are intended to stim
ulate discussion. They should not be viewed as the
school's only options, he said.
Raymond Levitt, associate professor of civil engineer
ing, said the school might want to offer two undergrad
uate degrees: a professionally-oriented program and
an unaccredited program in engineering sciences.
The second program would give students who do not
want to be engineers an understanding of technology
that would help them in such fields as business and
law, Levitt said.
"I think there is a basic incom
patability with trying to do in four
years the following two things: give

students a broad grounding in the
liberal arts and give them a deep and
broad training in engineering," he
said. "To try to do both of those
things in two years puts an in
credible pressure on an undergrad
uate."
Several engineering students said
the school's and the University's re
quirements make it diffcult for them
to take courses outside the School
of Engineering.
Donnel Briley, a senior in me
chanical engineering, said he has
only been able to take one course
outside the School of Engineering
that is not part of the distribution re
quirements.
"I had wanted to and still do want
to take courses outside of engineer
ing," Briley said. "But I have not
found the time before now — and I
don't have a lot of time now.''
"I think there does need to be an
overhaul of the system," said Lorna
Weissinger, a sophomore in indus
trial engineering. "Choosing to be
an engineer shouldn't mean that
you should only take engineering
courses."
Weissinger said the University's
distribution requirements have
crammed the schedule of engineer
