# Controversy mars Palo Alto campaign
## 
### SAM DELSON 
As Palo Altans go to the polls
today to elect a new City Council
majority, Libertarian candidate Cas
sandra Moore is once again
embroiled in a controversy concern
ing her campaign practices.
Moore was criticized by Republi
can Party officials, Palo Alto Mayor
Betsy Bechtel and the other council
candidates last weekend after she
mass-mailed a piece of campaign
literature Friday which implied that
she and four other council candi
dates had been endorsed by the Re
publican Party.
The mailing, entitled "Republican
Voter Guide," included the GOP's
elephant symbol and listed Moore's
name in bold red type. The other
four candidates — Steve Player, Jack
Sutorius, Anne Witherspoon and
Gail Woolley — were listed in
smaller black type.
Palo Alto municipal elections are
nonpartisan, and political parties are
barred by state law from endorsing
candidates.
Moore is one of 10 candidates
vying for four full four-year terms on
the council. There are also three
candidates competing for one two
year council term.
Incumbents Leland Levy and Emily
Renzel are expected to face close
races for their second full terms.
Their principal challengers are ex
pected to be planning commis
sioners Sutorius and Pat Cullen;
Historic Resources Board member
Woolley; Urban Coalition president
Player; and Moore.
Other candidates for the four-year
terms are Mary Beth Baldwin, lean
Ramacciotti and write-in hopeful
Ronald Bennett.

Donald Gansheimer is also on the
ballot, but he withdrew after suffer
ing a heart attack.
In the race for the two-year term,
incumbent Anne Witherspoon faces
a strong challenge from community
activist Bob Moss, who says Wither
spoon is too pro-development.
Retired businessman Sam Daram is
also running for the two-year seat.
Moore's controversial literature
caused The Mercury News to
withdraw its endorsement of her. In
an editorial entitled "Dirty tactics in
Palo Alto," yesterday, The Mercury
said of the mailing, "We think it's
deceptive and below the level of this
campaign, even if it's legal."
Moore said the postcards were
merely intended to give Republican
voters a better idea of which candi
dates are closest to their philoso
phy. She said she would not have
mailed the cards if she thought they
would mislead the public.
Moore is a member of the Libertar
ian Party, which opposes govern
ment involvement in most matters
other than national defense.
She and her husband, Thomas,
were Republicans before they
switched their registration to Liber
tarian. Thomas Moore is a Senior
Fellow at the Hoover Institution and
served on President Reagan's transi
tion team.
The mailing was paid for by The
Committee for Balanced Growth, a
group of real estate developers who
have endorsed Moore.
According to Moore campaign
manager Bill Evers, the controversial
post card and two other pieces of
literature sent out over the weekend
cost the committee $8000.
