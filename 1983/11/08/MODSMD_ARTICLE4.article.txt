# Controversy mars Palo Alto campaign
## 
### SAM DELSON 
As Palo Altans go to the polls
today to elect a new City Council
majority, Libertarian candidate Cas
sandra Moore is once again
embroiled in a controversy concern
ing her campaign practices.
Moore was criticized by Republi
can Party officials, Palo Alto Mayor
Betsy Bechtel and the other council
candidates last weekend after she
mass-mailed a piece of campaign
literature Friday which implied that
she and four other council candi
dates had been endorsed by the Re
publican Party.
The mailing, entitled "Republican
Voter Guide," included the GOP's
elephant symbol and listed Moore's
name in bold red type. The other
four candidates — Steve Player, Jack
Sutorius, Anne Witherspoon and
Gail Woolley — were listed in
smaller black type.
Palo Alto municipal elections are
nonpartisan, and political parties are
barred by state law from endorsing
candidates.
Moore is one of 10 candidates
vying for four full four-year terms on
the council. There are also three
candidates competing for one two
year council term.
Incumbents Leland Levy and Emily
Renzel are expected to face close
races for their second full terms.
Their principal challengers are ex
pected to be planning commis
sioners Sutorius and Pat Cullen;
Historic Resources Board member
Woolley; Urban Coalition president
Player; and Moore.
Other candidates for the four-year
terms are Mary Beth Baldwin, lean
Ramacciotti and write-in hopeful
Ronald Bennett.

Donald Gansheimer is also on the
ballot, but he withdrew after suffer
ing a heart attack.
In the race for the two-year term,
incumbent Anne Witherspoon faces
a strong challenge from community
activist Bob Moss, who says Wither
spoon is too pro-development.
Retired businessman Sam Daram is
also running for the two-year seat.
Moore's controversial literature
caused The Mercury News to
withdraw its endorsement of her. In
an editorial entitled "Dirty tactics in
Palo Alto," yesterday, The Mercury
said of the mailing, "We think it's
deceptive and below the level of this
campaign, even if it's legal."
Moore said the postcards were
merely intended to give Republican
voters a better idea of which candi
dates are closest to their philoso
phy. She said she would not have
mailed the cards if she thought they
would mislead the public.
Moore is a member of the Libertar
ian Party, which opposes govern
ment involvement in most matters
other than national defense.
She and her husband, Thomas,
were Republicans before they
switched their registration to Liber
tarian. Thomas Moore is a Senior
Fellow at the Hoover Institution and
served on President Reagan's transi
tion team.
The mailing was paid for by The
Committee for Balanced Growth, a
group of real estate developers who
have endorsed Moore.
According to Moore campaign
manager Bill Evers, the controversial
post card and two other pieces of
literature sent out over the weekend
cost the committee $8000.
The controversy over the mailing
has drawn attention away from the
other issues in the City Council elec
tion.
The campaign has focused on the
city's development policies, and
most of the candidates agree that
growth must be limited. Moore,
however, favors growth as long as it
does not require government sub
sidies.
The two issues of most direct con
cern to the University community
are the proposed Stanford West
housing project and the extension
of Willow Road to El Camino Real.
All of the candidates except Moss,
Cullen and Renzel support the Wil
low Road extension, but most
oppose plans to continue Willow so
that it would connect El Camino to
Alma Street.
On Stanford West, half support
the council's decision to withhold
approval until the University meets
certain conditions.
Among the major candidates,
Sutorius, Woolley, and Player favor
some sort of compromise between
the city and Stanford, while Moore
supports the University's position
and would approve the project with
out modifications.
Palo Alto voters will also elect
three school board members today
and decide on three proposed
amendments to the city charter and
one county ordinance.
Seven candidates are competing
for the three school board posi
tions. They include Stanford Educa
tion Prof. Robert Calfee and Stan

ford graduate Al Russell.
Labor attorney Alan Davis is the
only incumbent in the race. The
other candidates are Millicent Joyce
Evans, an accountant at Lawrence
Livermore Laboratories; Tom Lewis,
a sales manager at Crystal Technolo
gies; Linda Malamphy, a Palo Alto
realtor; and attorney Joe Simitian.
Two of the charter amendments
concern the city's proposed cable
television system. Measure D would
authorize the City Council to set up
an independent cable TV board and
Measure E would enable the council
to grant a cable TV franchise without
a public referendum.
The third charter amendment,
Measure C, would abolish the office
of city controller and replace it with
a city auditor.
Voters will also be asked to ap
prove a Santa Clara County tax to
finance construction and remodel
ing of jail and court facilities.
The polls open at 7 a.m. and will
close at 8 p.m.

Other candidates for the four-year
terms are Mary Beth Baldwin, lean
Ramacciotti and write-in hopeful
Ronald Bennett.

Donald Gansheimer is also on the
ballot, but he withdrew after suffer
ing a heart attack.
In the race for the two-year term,
incumbent Anne Witherspoon faces
a strong challenge from community
activist Bob Moss, who says Wither
spoon is too pro-development.
Retired businessman Sam Daram is
also running for the two-year seat.
Moore's controversial literature
caused The Mercury News to
withdraw its endorsement of her. In
an editorial entitled "Dirty tactics in
Palo Alto," yesterday, The Mercury
said of the mailing, "We think it's
deceptive and below the level of this
campaign, even if it's legal."
Moore said the postcards were
merely intended to give Republican
voters a better idea of which candi
dates are closest to their philoso
phy. She said she would not have
mailed the cards if she thought they
would mislead the public.
Moore is a member of the Libertar
ian Party, which opposes govern
ment involvement in most matters
other than national defense.
She and her husband, Thomas,
were Republicans before they
switched their registration to Liber
tarian. Thomas Moore is a Senior
Fellow at the Hoover Institution and
served on President Reagan's transi
tion team.
The mailing was paid for by The
Committee for Balanced Growth, a
group of real estate developers who
have endorsed Moore.
According to Moore campaign
manager Bill Evers, the controversial
post card and two other pieces of
literature sent out over the weekend
cost the committee $8000.
The controversy over the mailing
has drawn attention away from the
other issues in the City Council elec
tion.
The campaign has focused on the
city's development policies, and
most of the candidates agree that
growth must be limited. Moore,
however, favors growth as long as it
does not require government sub
sidies.
The two issues of most direct con
cern to the University community
are the proposed Stanford West
housing project and the extension
of Willow Road to El Camino Real.
All of the candidates except Moss,
Cullen and Renzel support the Wil
low Road extension, but most
oppose plans to continue Willow so
that it would connect El Camino to
Alma Street.
On Stanford West, half support
the council's decision to withhold
approval until the University meets
certain conditions.
Among the major candidates,
Sutorius, Woolley, and Player favor
some sort of compromise between
the city and Stanford, while Moore
supports the University's position
and would approve the project with
out modifications.
Palo Alto voters will also elect
three school board members today
and decide on three proposed
amendments to the city charter and
one county ordinance.
Seven candidates are competing
for the three school board posi
tions. They include Stanford Educa
tion Prof. Robert Calfee and Stan

ford graduate Al Russell.
Labor attorney Alan Davis is the
only incumbent in the race. The
other candidates are Millicent Joyce
Evans, an accountant at Lawrence
Livermore Laboratories; Tom Lewis,
a sales manager at Crystal Technolo
gies; Linda Malamphy, a Palo Alto
realtor; and attorney Joe Simitian.
Two of the charter amendments
concern the city's proposed cable
television system. Measure D would
authorize the City Council to set up
an independent cable TV board and
Measure E would enable the council
to grant a cable TV franchise without
a public referendum.
The third charter amendment,
Measure C, would abolish the office
of city controller and replace it with
a city auditor.
Voters will also be asked to ap
prove a Santa Clara County tax to
finance construction and remodel
ing of jail and court facilities.
The polls open at 7 a.m. and will
close at 8 p.m.
As Palo Altans go to the polls
today to elect a new City Council
majority, Libertarian candidate Cas
sandra Moore is once again
embroiled in a controversy concern
ing her campaign practices.
Moore was criticized by Republi
can Party officials, Palo Alto Mayor
Betsy Bechtel and the other council
candidates last weekend after she
mass-mailed a piece of campaign
literature Friday which implied that
she and four other council candi
dates had been endorsed by the Re
publican Party.
The mailing, entitled "Republican
Voter Guide," included the GOP's
elephant symbol and listed Moore's
name in bold red type. The other
four candidates — Steve Player, Jack
Sutorius, Anne Witherspoon and
Gail Woolley — were listed in
smaller black type.
Palo Alto municipal elections are
nonpartisan, and political parties are
barred by state law from endorsing
candidates.
Moore is one of 10 candidates
vying for four full four-year terms on
the council. There are also three
candidates competing for one two
year council term.
Incumbents Leland Levy and Emily
Renzel are expected to face close
races for their second full terms.
Their principal challengers are ex
pected to be planning commis
sioners Sutorius and Pat Cullen;
Historic Resources Board member
Woolley; Urban Coalition president
Player; and Moore.
Other candidates for the four-year
terms are Mary Beth Baldwin, lean
Ramacciotti and write-in hopeful
Ronald Bennett.
