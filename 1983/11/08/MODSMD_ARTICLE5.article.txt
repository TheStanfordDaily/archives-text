Skirmish closes Beirut airport

Beirut, Lebanon — Shiite Moslem gunmen fought Lebanese soldiers
near U.S. military positions yesterday, wounding a Marine and forcing
authorities to close the airport for the first time since a truce took ef
fect six weeks ago.
The Syrian government ordered a full mobilization of its 220,000-
man army, saying it feared an attack from the United States or Israel.
But the Americans and Israelis said there were no attack plans.
In Northern Lebanon, Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
Yasser Arafat's loyalist guerrillas, trapped in their last Middle Last
stronghold by advancing Syrian-supported mutineers, tired rockets
and mortars at rebel positions to counter a barrage of hundreds of

shells. Police said 1000 people have been killed and
3000 wounded since the PLO war began Thursday.
Arafat, who has accused Syria oi backing the
rebels because it wants to take over the PLO, told
reporters in Tripoli that the Syrians were planning to
overrun his Baddawi refugee camp and invade
Lebanon's second-largest city.
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the jordan
River and the Gaza Strip, there were widespread
demonstrations in support of Arafat. At least one
demonstrator was wounded in clashes with Israeli
authorities.
U.S. Marine spokesman Maj. Robert lordan said
the leathernecks in Beirut dived into bunkers and
foxholes when fighting broke out near their airport
compound and returned fire when snipers shot at
them.
He said a Marine was wounded and "treated on
the field."
State radio said the airport closed because of the
fighting between Shiite gunners and the Lebanese
army, and that air controllers diverted planes to

Cyprus. It was the first time the airport closed since
a cease-fire aimed at halting the country's chronic
civil war took effect Sept. 26.
Bomb explodes in Capitol
Washington — A bomb exploded last night near
the Senate chamber inside the U.S. Capitol Building,
police reported.
There were no reports of injuries in the blast,
which one witness described as a "big heavy clap of
thunder" about 8 p.m.
A group calling itself the Armed Resistance Unit
claimed responsibility for the explosion and said it
was in reaction to the U.S. invasion of Grenada and
the presence of U.S. Marines in Lebanon.
The Capitol was sealed off by police and
firefighters, and seven fire trucks and three am
bulances were on the scene.
Senate approves funds for MX
Washington — The Senate yesterdav approved
spending $2.5 billion to produce and install 21 MX
intercontinental missiles. Opponents conceded that
the 56-37 vote may mark the last serious attempt to

halt deployment of the powerful strategic weapon.
Senators brushed aside arguments by Dale
Bumpers (D-Ark.), Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and
others that the MX is outdated and vulnerable to So
viet attack.
I believe it is necessary to make one last effort if
only to clear my conscience," said Bumpers, ack
nowledging defeat shortly before the vote.
The \l\ is a missile without a mission and a
weapon without a home," Kennedy said.
President Reagan and other supporters say the MX
is needed as a "bargaining chip" to pressure the So
viet Union to negotiate seriously at the Geneva talks
on curbing strategic nuclear arms.
Scientists overcome fusion problem
Los Angeles — Scientists said yesterday they have
created a kev condition needed for practical produc
tion of fusion power — a step they called a mile
stone in the efforts to unleash that inexhaustible en
ergy supply.
For the first time, researchers say they have been
able to adequately confine the electrically charged
particles that help create fusion. The development
occured in a test reactor at Massachusetts Institute

of Technology (MIT).
fhat means that the MIT researchers showed for
the tirst time that it is possible to extract more ener
gy from a fusion reaction than is needed to super
heat and compress the particles to sustain the reac
tion, said Ronald Parker, leader of the MIT research
team.

Bomb explodes in Capitol
Washington — A bomb exploded last night near
the Senate chamber inside the U.S. Capitol Building,
police reported.
There were no reports of injuries in the blast,
which one witness described as a "big heavy clap of
thunder" about 8 p.m.
A group calling itself the Armed Resistance Unit
claimed responsibility for the explosion and said it
was in reaction to the U.S. invasion of Grenada and
the presence of U.S. Marines in Lebanon.
The Capitol was sealed off by police and
firefighters, and seven fire trucks and three am
bulances were on the scene.
Senate approves funds for MX
Washington — The Senate yesterdav approved
spending $2.5 billion to produce and install 21 MX
intercontinental missiles. Opponents conceded that
the 56-37 vote may mark the last serious attempt to

halt deployment of the powerful strategic weapon.
Senators brushed aside arguments by Dale
Bumpers (D-Ark.), Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and
others that the MX is outdated and vulnerable to So
viet attack.
I believe it is necessary to make one last effort if
only to clear my conscience," said Bumpers, ack
nowledging defeat shortly before the vote.
The \l\ is a missile without a mission and a
weapon without a home," Kennedy said.
President Reagan and other supporters say the MX
is needed as a "bargaining chip" to pressure the So
viet Union to negotiate seriously at the Geneva talks
on curbing strategic nuclear arms.
Scientists overcome fusion problem
Los Angeles — Scientists said yesterday they have

For the first time, researchers say they have been
able to adequately confine the electrically charged
particles that help create fusion. The development
occured in a test reactor at Massachusetts Institute

tion, said Ronald Parker, leader of the MIT research
team.

Beirut, Lebanon — Shiite Moslem gunmen fought Lebanese soldiers
