### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
Two student leaders have submitted to the
Committee on Contemporary Entertainment
(CoCE) proposals that call for a new student
group to sponsor concerts on campus.
"It seems to me that the most effective con
cert system would be to have a single student
run organization as the primary promoter of
contemporary entertaiment events on
campus," said Scott Davis, former director ot
the Concert Network and sponsor of one of the
proposals.
The CoCE will forward a recommendation to
Dean ot Student Affairs James Lyons by the end

produced on campus.
A subcommittee of the Committee on Con

new way to handle concerts on campus is
developed.

Council of Presidents, said his proposal for an
independent student group to sponsor contem

The proposal maintains the CoCE's control
over policy guidelines for student groups

mittee) have basically agreed on is that we plan
on supporting a new student group to do con
certs," he said. "The main problem is that there

are at least two University departments
(University Events and Services and the Athletic
Department) that can drive the student group
out of business."
The University departments have the advan
tages of permanent and experienced staffs,
Freda said.
Freda's proposal calls for the student group to
hold most of the concerts it promotes at Frost
Ampitheatre, Memorial Auditorium and Maples
Pavilion. Other University groups who want to
hold concerts at the sites would have to get per
mission from CoCE.
All University groups would be able to hold
concerts at other sites.
