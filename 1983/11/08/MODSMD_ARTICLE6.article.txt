# Students advise concert policy changes
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
Two student leaders have submitted to the
Committee on Contemporary Entertainment
(CoCE) proposals that call for a new student
group to sponsor concerts on campus.
"It seems to me that the most effective con
cert system would be to have a single student
run organization as the primary promoter of
contemporary entertaiment events on
campus," said Scott Davis, former director ot
the Concert Network and sponsor of one of the
proposals.
The CoCE will forward a recommendation to
Dean ot Student Affairs James Lyons by the end
of this month on the way concerts should be
produced on campus.
A subcommittee of the Committee on Con

temporary Entertainment (CoCE) discussed the
proposals on Friday.
University President Donald Kennedy or
dered in August a moratorium on all future con
certs, except those already approved, until a
new way to handle concerts on campus is
developed.
Vincent Freda, a member of CoCE and the
Council of Presidents, said his proposal for an
independent student group to sponsor contem
porary entertainment has been well-received.
The proposal maintains the CoCE's control
over policy guidelines for student groups
staging concerts.
"The idea that we (members of the subcom
mittee) have basically agreed on is that we plan
on supporting a new student group to do con
certs," he said. "The main problem is that there

are at least two University departments
(University Events and Services and the Athletic
Department) that can drive the student group
out of business."
The University departments have the advan
tages of permanent and experienced staffs,
Freda said.
Freda's proposal calls for the student group to
hold most of the concerts it promotes at Frost
Ampitheatre, Memorial Auditorium and Maples
Pavilion. Other University groups who want to
hold concerts at the sites would have to get per
mission from CoCE.
All University groups would be able to hold
concerts at other sites.
Davis, a graduate student in economics, sub-
mitted a letter to the committee ar
guing for an ASSU-controlled stu
dent group to sponsor contempo
rary entertainment here.
Davis said the student group
should be managed by the ASSU be
cause " the ASSU will tend to be
more altruistic with its profits and
will represent a wider range of stu
dent interests," he said. "I also feel
that an ASSU- managed system will
avoid some of the problems of
group dynamics that can result from
a corporate board structure."

Davis said a student group would
be more educational for students
and more responsive to student
needs than an administrative group
like University Events and Services.
"Clearly a student-run organiza
tion would require that students be
involved with most facets of the
concert production and promotion
process. A student-run system
would allow students to have a say
in the types of entertainment,
finances and level of involvement in
each concert," he said.
Margaret Fidler, assistant dean of
student affairs and co-chairman of
the committee, said the subcommit
tee will meet once more to discuss
the objectives of the student organi
zation before the committee meets
next Monday.
Fidler submitted to the committee
a list of criteria for a new system to
sponsor contemporary entertain
ment concerts.
The main parts of the criteria call
for:
—Limiting to two the number of
concert-producing organizations on
campus.
—Developing a process to judge
whether a concert would be
desirable for the campus.
—Recognizing that contemporary
entertainment concerts have usually
been sponsored by students.
—Allowing University Events and
Services to draw up guidelines for
small concerts on campus.
