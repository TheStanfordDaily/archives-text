# Brain tissue transplants: a new medical frontier

### ALEX TARG 
Brain transplants, seemingly the stuff of sci
ence fiction, have now been successfully per
formed on humans. In experiments on rats
monkeys, brain grafting works surprisingly wen
and human testing has begun, report Swedish
medical researchers.
Neurosurgeon Olaf Backland and his
tologists Lars Olson and Aki Seiger pertormed
the first such operation at the Karolinska Hospi
tal in Stockholm during the summer of 1982.
The experimental subject was a man who suf
fered from Parkinson's disease, a central ner
vous system disorder. The disease affected him
to such an extent that he was totally im
mobilized. He consented to the operation even
though it was only known to work in rats and
had not yet been extensively tested with other
animals.
The surgical team first removed two-thirds of
the man's adrenal medulla which secretes a
neurotransmitter called dopamine, responsible
for motor activity. Parkinson's disease is
thought to result from a deterioration of the
neurons producing dopamine, hence impair
ing initiation of movement. By reimplanting the
adrenal medulla to another portion of the
brain, the surgeons hoped the tissue would
grow, increasing its dopamine output and res
toring voluntary motor control.
Animal experiments previously demon
strated that grafted adrenal medulla tissue
produces proportionately more dopamine than
when in its normal site, seeming to respond to
the brain's needs.
No one knew just what to expect from the ex
periment and the researchers were relieved to
find "no immediate or dramatic symptoms

when the patient woke up," according to an ac
count in Science magazine. Although Olson
qualified the success of the experiment as a
"slight improvement, but nothing sensation
al," the scientists plan to try more transplants.
Don Gash, a U.S. researcher at the University
of Rochester School of Medicine, said such
transplants will be possible in a clinical rather
than research setting by the late 1980s.
Brain transplants are more likelv to be ac
cepted by the body than are kidney and heart
transplants because the brain is an im
munologically isolated site. The brain
transplants enjoy the protection ot the blood
brain barrier, which keeps cells of the immune
system from reaching brain tissue.

may prove clinically helpful

neurological disorders, the
approach can also assist in
the study of fundamental
questions about the nature
of brain development/

In addition to using brain transplants to
relieve a variety of neurotransmitter deficits,
scientists at a variety of research institutions
have used them to correct brain damage result
ing in movement disorders, memory loss and
hyperactivity in animals. One group of re
searchers is now endeavoring to give blinded
animals light perception by grafting retinas or
whole eyes directly into brain tissue.
While medical applications of brain
transplantation may prove clinically helpful in
curing a wide variety of neurological disorders,
such tissue transplants can also assist in the
study of fundamental questions about the na
ture of brain development.
The memory studies are particularly exciting
because they may help provide solutions to the
memory loss that occurs with aging and with
Alzheimer's disease.
A group of U.S. researchers led by Richard
Wyatt and William Freed of the National In
stitute of Mental Health are pursuing an am
bitious project involving grafting whole eyes or
fetal retinas into the part of the brain that
receives visual information of blinded adult
rats. To bring light to the newly implanted
"eye," they then pass a fiber-optic device
through the rat's skull. Light passing through
the fibers allows the rat to "see" the outside
world.
Freed and Wyatt have demonstrated that the
grafted eyes respond electrically to light piped
in through the "periscopes" sticking up out of
the rats' heads. The next step in their research
is to determine if the rats perceive this stimulus
as light, laying the foundations for possible ex
periments in humans.
