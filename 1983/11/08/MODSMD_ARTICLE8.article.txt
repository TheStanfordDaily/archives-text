# Electronic skin gives robots a light touch

How do you give a robot
a sense ot touch?
A group of Stanford in
vestigators say they may
have found the answer by
developing a new device
they call "robot skin." This
double-threat product is a
hybrid combining densely
packed pressure and tem
perature sensors with in
tegrated circuit data pro
cessing elements all em
bedded in a durable yet
paper thin flexible "skin."
Miniature electronic cir
cuitry has become the hal
lmark of the silicon chip in
dustry during the last 20
years. Now researchers in
the Stanford Integrated Cir
cuits Laboratory (IC Lab)
are adding a new twist to
the technology by manu
facturing miniaturized me
chanical devices as well as
circuits.
Micromachining, the
process by which plain
silicon crystals are trans
formed into tiny machines,
takes advantage of the
same high-yield batch
fabrication techniques that
make silicon computer
chips so cheap. However,
instead of taking advantage
of silicon's unusual electri
cal properties, the micro
scopic manufacturing

process relies on chemical
and crystalline attributes.
Dr. Phillip Barth, senior
research associate in the IC
Lab, and Dr. James Angell,
protessor of electrial engi
neering, use chemical
etching techniques to build
miniaturized, precisely
placed and positioned pits,
holes, pyramids, trenches,
cantilevers, diaphragms
and walls which intercon
nect to form functional
electromechanical sensors.
Bv fusing the technolo
gies of electronics and
micromachining, Barth
hopes to produce devices
superior to those resulting
from either technology by
itself. Using the data pro
cessing power of integrated
circuits associated with
each of thousands ot sen
sors on a piece of "robot
skin," Barth hopes to per
form much of the robot's
analysis at the site of
stimulus, eliminating the
logistical problems of data
transmission and inter
ference which might result
if all data were sent to a
central brain.
This "on site" analysis
scheme is similar to that
used by humans to inter
pret tactile sensations com
ing from real skin. Exploit
ing this similarity, two

graduate students, Mark
Zdeblick and Steve
Douglass are "both
working on tactile force
sensing structures, digging
into the physiological back
ground and trying to figure
out how skin senses and
does signal processing at a
neurological level," said
Barth.
"In addition, we are
trying to discover ways of
interpreting shapes from
our sensory data in an ef
fort to aid in shape detec
tion using computer
simulations," Barth said.
"In terms of precision and
resolution, even though
the field is still in its in
fancy, we think we can
sense just about everything
human skin can feel. Our
next step is to look at infor
mation processing times on
these things to try to get a
real-time processing capa
bility," he said.
Possible applications of
micromachined devices in
clude microscopically
small, yet perfectly formed
valves, springs, mirrors,
nozzles , connectors and
sensors for properties such
as acceleration and chemi
cal concentration in addi
tion to pressure and tem
perature. There is an espe
cially urgent need for such
inexpensively made high
performance devices be
cause the electronics for
automatic control systems

using such sensors have
become so cheap due to
mass manufacturing of in
tegrated circuits.
The next step in commer
cial applications is to
cheaply produce hybrids
containing both sensors
and integrated circuits on a
single chip.
Although the list of possi
ble applications is almost
endless, Barth has already
built some devices for
biomedicine, including a
high resolution tempera
ture sensor for use in can
cer hyperthermia therapy.
The tiny array of sensors,
using the same type of cir
cuit as in the robot skin, is
so thin that it easily fits into
a hyperdermic needle and
can measure tissue temper
atures with great precision.
One problem Barth has
encountered is that of in
stability in devices im
planted in tissue. Eventu
ally, over the course of
months of contact with
human fluids, the devices
begin to malfunction be
cause the body fluids pene
trate the protective plastic
coverings. However, Barth
is confident that w/tb fur
ther experimentation, thU.
failure- mode writ he"
averted. Among those
working on this project are
undergraduates Kevin
Holisenger, Shinya
Akamine and Alice Vang.

ROBOT SKIN: This development may allow electronic fin
gers to surpass the sensitivity of human finger tips. The
gold-colored flexible polyimide film is jam-packed with
miniature sensors and in final form will contain specially
designed integrated circuits to perform the function of
human nerve synapses and ganglia, providing a degree of
processing power and sensitivity no human can match.
