## Stanford Museum provides art, education for community 
### CHERYL KORTE MARK WILSON 
When the Stanford Museum
first opened in 1894, it had the
distinction of being the largest
privately sponsored museum
in the world and only the fifth
university museum to be es
tablished.
Then the San Francisco
earthquake struck in 1906,
bringing to the museum a long
period of decay and neglect.
More than four-fifths of the
museum structure was
destroyed by the earthquake,
and thousands of art objects
were lost
It was not until 1954 that
large-scale restoration of the
museum began, and it wasn't
until 1981 that all of the
museum's exhibition space
was open to the public.
The museum strives to serve
both general and academic in
terests. Besides serving as a
showplace for art exhibits, it
serves as a center for research
in art and art history. Students
working in the museum have
the opportunity to participate
in independent study pro
grams, supervise displays, and
help mend Cypriot pottery
damaged in the 1906
earthquake.
While the University pays
for the museum's overhead
expenses, private donations
pay for all the museum's art
purchases. The largest part of
the purchase fund comes from
money raised at the museum's

biannual treasure market sale
in which estate pieces are auc
tioned off, said Carol Os
borne, assistant director and
curator of collections.
Since 1980, the number of
new acquisitions has risen to
iOO objects each year. There
are now about 30,000 pieces in
the museum, Osborne said.
The museum's collections
include objects ranging from
ancient pottery and coins to
modern sculptural pieces.
Besides traditional objects
such as paintings, sculpture,
drawings and prints, the
museum contains collections
of photographs, documents,
illustrated books, autographs
and letters and decorative arts
and textiles from each of the
different continents.
The Museum also contains
pieces by such artists as
Rembrandt, Matisse and
Delacroix.
The most popular of the
museum's exhibits, however,
is its collection of Stanford
memorabilia. The collection
contains such objects as the
gold spike which united the
railroads of the East and West.
The museum also hosts tem
porary exhibits, many of
which are sought out and or
ganized exclusively for Stan
ford and are seen nowhere
else. The museum's most
publicized attraction is the
rotunda which recently
housed the Rodin pieces of
the Cantor gift collection. The

rotunda, which previously
housed exhibits from the
Marine Biology Department
and the botany library, was
opened for museum use in
1981.
Although it seems unusual
today to see art pieces and
natural history exhibits
displayed together, Jane Stan
ford's original collection did
include scientific and histori
cal objects, Osborne said. She
explained that in the 19th cen

tury fine arts and natural his
tory were always intended to
be viewed together, while the
20th century has placed a divi
sion between the two.
Looking toward the future
of the museum, Osborne ex
pressed the current need for
increased storage and exhibi
tion space. Because of current
space limitations, some of the
museum's pieces — such as
two paintings by American art
ist Charles Nahl, each measur-

ing 10 by 16 feet — cannot be
exhibited.
Currently, plans for future
expansion include the es
tablish ment of a sculpture
garden to be located next to
the museum. The garden will
serve as a showcase for pieces
already held by the museum.
Other pieces such as Rodin's
"Gates of Hell" and "The Bur
ghers of Calais" will also
reside in the sculpture ear
den.

different continents.
The Museum also contains
pieces by such artists as
Rembrandt, Matisse and
Delacroix.
The most popular of the
museum's exhibits, however,
is its collection of Stanford
memorabilia. The collection
contains such objects as the
gold spike which united the
railroads of the East and West.
The museum also hosts tem
porary exhibits, many of
which are sought out and or
ganized exclusively for Stan
ford and are seen nowhere
else. The museum's most
publicized attraction is the
rotunda which recently
housed the Rodin pieces of
the Cantor gift collection. The

rotunda, which previously
housed exhibits from the
Marine Biology Department
and the botany library, was
opened for museum use in
1981.
Although it seems unusual
today to see art pieces and
natural history exhibits
displayed together, Jane Stan
ford's original collection did
include scientific and histori
cal objects, Osborne said. She
explained that in the 19th cen

tury fine arts and natural his
tory were always intended to
be viewed together, while the
20th century has placed a divi
sion between the two.
Looking toward the future
of the museum, Osborne ex
pressed the current need for
increased storage and exhibi
tion space. Because of current
space limitations, some of the
museum's pieces — such as
two paintings by American art
ist Charles Nahl, each measur-

ing 10 by 16 feet — cannot be
exhibited.
Currently, plans for future
expansion include the es
tablish ment of a sculpture
garden to be located next to
the museum. The garden will
serve as a showcase for pieces
already held by the museum.
Other pieces such as Rodin's
"Gates of Hell" and "The Bur
ghers of Calais" will also
reside in the sculpture ear
den.

ARTISTIC FLAIR: The Stanford Museum, which was founded
in 1894 by Jane Stanford as a memorial to Leland Stanford
Junior, serves as both an artistic showplace and a center for
art education. The museum currently houses about .30,000
art pieces. (Left) the front of the museum;(right) a scene from
