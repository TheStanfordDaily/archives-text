# Panel to review athletic finances
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
An ad hoc committee has un
dertaken a comprehensive
review of the Department of Ath
letic's budget in the wake of the
department's $500,000 deficit last
year and an expected deficit of at
least that much for the current
fiscal year.
Last month, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy asked
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost
and director of University
budgets, to survey Athletic De
partment budget procedures and
prepare a report on his findings.
Associate Controller Frank
Riddle joined the committee as
the representative from the Con
troller's Office, which is respon
sible for financial control in Uni
versity budgets. The committee is
rounded out by Alan Cummings
and Nancy Padgett representing
the Athletic Department.
Cummings is a senior associate
director in the department, and
Padgett is an assistant director of
athletics.
In the course of its work, the
committee, which only recently
started meeting, will formulate
recommendations for a presenta
tion on the Athletic Department
budget that Kennedy and Athletic
Director Andy Geiger are sched
uled to make to the Board of
Trustees at its December
meeting. At that time, the presi
dent and Geiger will inform the
trustees on the steps necessary to
bring the department's budget
within guidelines, according to
Cummings.
Riddle said the four administra
tors are "looking at the depart
ment and the costs of the depart
ment and the income aspects of
the department" with the current
and next fiscal year in mind. The
group is "in a data-gathering
mode," he said, and has yet to
formulate any decisions on how
to solve the Athletic Depart
ment's budgetary problems.

Any recommendations the
committee does make will in
volve "income increases and ex
pense reductions," Cummings
said.
Because the review is at an ear
ly stage, he could not specify
what these might be, but he said
that options under study include
prospects for television income
and football gate receipts on the
revenue side, and changes in the
way sports are run and the num
ber of sports supported by the
department on the expense side.

According to Cummings, the
committee is also examining the
financial controls on this year's
budget, which faces a deficit of at
least $634,000, including an esti
mated $480,000 from the football
season and approximately
$150,000 from women's scholar
ships.
Cummings said that the ad hoc
body is looking at three ways in
which this deficit can be paid:
money from increased fund
raising, a loan against remaining
reserves or a grant from the Uni
versity.
The department will have to
fund scholarships for female ath
letes $150,000 over the amount
raised by the Cardinal C\ub as
well as income from the depart
ment's endowment.
