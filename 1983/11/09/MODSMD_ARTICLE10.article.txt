# 10 good reasons for invading
## 
### 
Wow! Two Wednesdays ago I
wrote a column critical of
Reagan — and he goes and invades
Grenada. Easy big guy — don't take
what I write so seriously.
I could've written a column com
plaining about the invasion, but I
was afraid of what he might do
then — maybe invade Nicaragua.
Actually, when Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger was asked about
that possibility in an interview, he
just giggled. So I'm not taking any
chances.
So I thought I would be nice to
Reagan by helping him justify the
takeover of a country with one-half
of one-thousandth of our popula
tion.
First of all, I didn't think his main
reason was very good: those stu
dents, I mean. Granted, they were
frightened and they wanted to go
home, but if we invaded every place
where students were frightened and
wanted to go home, what would
happen during Dead Week? We'd
never be able to study with the
Marines shelling White Plaza.
Besides, we were asking for trou
ble by sending all the people who
couldn't get into med schools in
America to hotbeds of leftist revolu
tion. To prevent similar crises, I
think it is Stanford's patriotic duty to
lower admissions standards at the
Med School. They could even print
the applications on matchbook
covers.
As a substitute for this rather
flimsy excuse, I would like to pres
ent "10 Good Reasons for Invading

Grenada." These are suitable for
use at press conferences, U.N.
meetings and American Legion con
ventions.
1) The Airstrip. Reagan's been war
ning us about that airstrip they're
building down there for a long time,
but when our boys got there, it real
ly knocked their socks off: In a
nearby shed were giant stencils
ready to paint "Russian
Airplanes — Please Land Here" in
great big letters. What further proof
do you need?
The Grenadians claim that the air
port is merely means to attract
tourists. But how then can one ex
plain the signs the government has
put up saying "Gringo tourists stay
home," and "Don't spend Yankee
dollars here?" Clearly someone is
not telling the truth here.
2) The Name. The people on the is
land say Gre-NAV-duh. Americans
know that it is supposed to be
pronounced Gre-NAH-duh, like the
car. Only the U.S. Army can set
them straight.
3) The Cubans. Reagan knows
about Cubans. There are good
Cubans, like Ricky Ricardo. They
play in cha-cha bands and have
amusing American wives. Then
there are bad Cubans, like Fidel
Castro. All the Cubans on the island
were the bad kind.
4) Nutmeg and Rum. A noted politi
cal analyst has pointed out that
Grenada is among the world's chief
suppliers of these commodities. Is it
any coincidence that these just hap
pen to be two ingredients without
which it is impossible to make a

decent eggnog? (Plus eggs, of
course.) A little known clause in the
Rio Treaty, known as the Gar
denswartz Doctrine, gives us the
right to intervene in any country to
protect our holiday festivities.
5.) The Arms Stockpile. Grenada
had lots and lots of weapons piled
up. What possible uses could they
have had for them. It's not like they
were in danger of being invaded or
anything.
6.) Training. In the invasion, U.S.
forces crashed helicopters, shot
several of their own people and
blew up a mental hospital. It's pretty
obvious that they needed the
practice. What would have hap
pened if we had had to invade a real
country?
7.) Grenadine. This is what they
use in Shirley Temples. Does it
come from Grenada? If so, the Free
World could have been denied non
alcoholic alternatives.
8.) The Law of Averages. We hadn't
invaded Grenada yet. It was bound
to happen sometime.
9.) The Evil Empire. We all knew
who was really behind the
Grenadian coup — Darth Vader and
his nasty storm troopers. He was
trying to crush the Rebellion, which
is being led by Luke, Leia and 10,000
of Samoza's National Guardsmen.
10. A Signal. The invasion sends a
valuable signal to our allies and
enemies alike — Reagan is a crazy
man, and you'd better stay out of his
way.
