Housing problem
I was astounded to learn that a
supposedly responsible University
official such as the director of the
Housing Center, Rodger Whitney,
made a statement to the effect that
"student housing is not a very large
problem here at Stanford'' (The
Daily, Nov. 4). Who is he trying to
kid? No graduate students for sure.
H.V. Jagadish
Chair, ASSU Senate
Missile deployment
I wish to commend the editorial
staff of The Daily for its stand in
opposition to the stationing of new
nuclear missiles in Europe. As the
editorial writers (Daily, Nov. 3) put
it,"The Pershing missiles are first
strike weapons because of their
accuracy and ability to destroy
Soviet cities and command centers
with only a six to eight minute time
for error."
It should also be pointed out that
because of these features the
Soviets see these weapons as strate
gic, not just theater in nature, just
as the United States would if
medium-range nuclear missiles
were pointed at its cities from a
country as close as Mexico. The
deployment of the nearly undetec
table cruise and tirst-strike Persh
ings will make the Soviet extremely
nervous, leading them to depend
ever more on computer warnings of
missile attacks and to a possible
adoption of a launch-on-warning
strategy.
One correction to the editorial
does seem in order. The NATO
decision to deploy the cruise and
Pershing lis was made in January
1979 and, as Peter Pringle points
out in the London Observer news
paper of Oct. 16, 1983, it was made
in order to modernize the NATO
nuclear force, not as a response to
the SS-20s. Pringle got his informa
tion from classified documents of
NATO presented to the Observer.
My reading of the very pro-Soviet
East German press leaves me with
the understanding that the official
Warsaw Pact position is to oppose
the Pershing and cruise deployment
in Western Europe because among
other things, it would likely lead
the USSR to put nuclear weapons in
Eastern Europe as a response. This
position has been correctly per
ceived by The Daily.
The Warsaw Pact's proposal is to
reduce SS-20s to a level (142) equal
to that that the British and French
have or, to eliminate nuclear weap
ons totally from Europe if the
British, French and Americans agree
to do the same. This is in accor
dance with their announced sup
port for the Swedish government's
proposal to make Central Europe a
nuclear free zone, a proposal which
is opposed by the West German
government but endorsed by the
East German government.
We can only hope that something

sensible is done before the door to
the nuclear oven is shut.

Tenure and women
To provide female students at
Stanford with female faculty role
models ("Male professors still out
number female faculty," The Daily,
Nov. 1), will require taking Law
Prof. Barbara Babcock's suggestion
seriously University-wide, that is,
consciously selecting female faculty
when equally qualified male and
female candidates present them
selves for appointment and promo
tion. Such affirmative action re
quires an affirmative institutional
policy, attitude, culture and com
mitment, and not merely cosmetic
preemptive budgetary allocations,
staff positions and door signs.
Contrary to the statement made
in The Daily article about my
opinion, I personally do believe in
the power of affirmative action
when the program has high-level
clout, is not merely window dress
ing and cannot be abused.
To get the facts straight about my
"termination": I strongly believe
women at the University face dis
crimination, just like we do in all
other walks of life. The fact that I
was not considered for tenure
(distinct from being denied tenure
as indicated in the article) has an
apparently more mundane base on
the face of it, but this particular
case should not be used to contra
dict the general point.
When the Department of Com
munication (DoC) approached the
Faculty Affirmative Action Office
(AAO) with a minority female can
didate (myself) whom they claimed
was tenurable in three years, the
AAO agreed to pay half my salary to
help promote their cause.
The Humanities and Sciences
deanery and the AAO simultane
ously indicated to the DoC that
they might well have found a
tenurable woman but that this did
not guarantee them a tenure
track/tenured billet to evaluate her
against, when the time came for
review. The Dean pointed out that
getting a billet was not impossible
but the DoC would have to make a
case for it over the next couple of
years.
The files indicate that the DoC
apparently did nothing on this;
they may well have had other more
pressing matters to take up with the
Dean's office.
I write this to strengthen the
positions taken by Babcock and
Assistant Provost Cecilia Burciaga
and to correct the small errors in
the feature. It should be noted,
one, that the AAO did put money
behind a department's apparently
honest request to help increase the
number of tenurable women at
Stanford, and two, that the depart
ment concerned took the money,
hired me to teach their courses and
advise their students with it for as
long as they could, but did not do
the spade work and internal jug
gling required to create the billet
that they assured me and the AAO
they would consider me for.

SCIRE internships
Your editorial "Work, study, then
what?" (Daily, Nov. 1), asked the
question, "Why are these
(President Donald Kennedy and
Law School Dean john Hart Ely) and
other educators spending their time
emphasizing public service?"
SCIRE is a student-initiated group
that provides accredited internships
for undergraduates with more than
80 local non-profit agencies and
close to .K) local government
offices. After Thanksgiving our
winter quarter Clearinghouse cata
log will be available, with more
than 500 such opportunities. Al
though some internships in busi
ness are available, the bulk of Ihe
listings are in community service.
We are working closely with the
President's special assistant for
community service projects. We
work with CPPC, the internship
programs in psychology and com
munication, UPSE (School of Educa

tion), and share our resources with
human biology. Our catalog
supplements the ARLO catalog of
research opportunities with local
non-profit and government
agencies.
We want to encourage students
to match their community service
interests, commitment to volunteer
work with accredited projects such
as our internship program, l aced
with funding cuts, local non-profits
rely on interns and volunteers to
work with the handicapped, feed
the unemployed, counsel the bat
tered women, work with abused
children, organize peace confer
ences, teach in the schools and
local environmental projects. This
work can be accredited and com
plement a student's major or voca
tional interests.
Internships can provide in
valuable contact with community
professionals and help in assessing
career choices. Many students have
earned credit for projects based on
their Washington internships.

Football coaching
(During the past five and a half
years, because I have been serving
in the U.S. Air Force, we have been
forced to live outside of California.
Yet, little as we can afford to, we
contribute to the Buck Club and
return home in the fall — primarily
to visit Stanford and attend a
couple football games.
We flew to Los Angeles for the
Stanford-USC game and this
weekend we'll fly up to Stanford for
the Oregon game. These were
plans loyally made and paid lor last
spring. Today we are wondering
why.
This present coa< hing staff has
demonstrated the same losing
mentality for the past five years
typical of the lack Curtice regime in
the early 1960s and the jack Chris
tiansen regime in the 70s.
For a university that demands
excellence in its students, it is
beyond us why you do not demand
the same standards in your coach
ing personnel.
The tired old rationale that Stan
ford is too small and maintains too
strict academic requirements to
field a competitive football team
does not wash anymore: John
Ralston and Bill Walsh proved
otherwise. The quality of an athlete
on the football field at Stanford
during the past five years has been
no less than that of those who
played for Ralston and Walsh.
Furthermore, Stanford has dem
onstrated great superiority in other
sports — tennis, swimming, water
polo, baseball, cross country track,
etc. These sports are fortunate to
have coaches who profess winning
mentalities.
The young men who make the
decision to represent Stanford on
the gridiron deserve far better than
they are getting.

SCIRE internships
Your editorial "Work, study, then
what?" (Daily, Nov. 1), asked the
question, "Why are these
(President Donald Kennedy and
Law School Dean john Hart Ely) and
other educators spending their time
emphasizing public service?"
SCIRE is a student-initiated group
that provides accredited internships
for undergraduates with more than
80 local non-profit agencies and
close to .K) local government
offices. After Thanksgiving our
winter quarter Clearinghouse cata
log will be available, with more
than 500 such opportunities. Al
though some internships in busi
ness are available, the bulk of Ihe
listings are in community service.
We are working closely with the
President's special assistant for
community service projects. We
work with CPPC, the internship
programs in psychology and com
munication, UPSE (School of Educa

tion), and share our resources with
human biology. Our catalog
supplements the ARLO catalog of
research opportunities with local
non-profit and government
agencies.
We want to encourage students
to match their community service
interests, commitment to volunteer
work with accredited projects such
as our internship program, l aced
with funding cuts, local non-profits
rely on interns and volunteers to
work with the handicapped, feed
the unemployed, counsel the bat
tered women, work with abused
children, organize peace confer
ences, teach in the schools and
local environmental projects. This
work can be accredited and com
plement a student's major or voca
tional interests.
Internships can provide in
valuable contact with community
professionals and help in assessing
career choices. Many students have
earned credit for projects based on
their Washington internships.

Football coaching
(During the past five and a half
years, because I have been serving
in the U.S. Air Force, we have been
forced to live outside of California.
Yet, little as we can afford to, we
contribute to the Buck Club and
return home in the fall — primarily
to visit Stanford and attend a
couple football games.
We flew to Los Angeles for the
Stanford-USC game and this
weekend we'll fly up to Stanford for
the Oregon game. These were
plans loyally made and paid lor last
spring. Today we are wondering
why.
This present coa< hing staff has
demonstrated the same losing
mentality for the past five years
typical of the lack Curtice regime in
the early 1960s and the jack Chris
tiansen regime in the 70s.
For a university that demands
excellence in its students, it is
beyond us why you do not demand
the same standards in your coach
ing personnel.
The tired old rationale that Stan
ford is too small and maintains too
strict academic requirements to
field a competitive football team
does not wash anymore: John
Ralston and Bill Walsh proved
otherwise. The quality of an athlete
on the football field at Stanford
during the past five years has been
no less than that of those who
played for Ralston and Walsh.
Furthermore, Stanford has dem
onstrated great superiority in other
sports — tennis, swimming, water
polo, baseball, cross country track,
etc. These sports are fortunate to
have coaches who profess winning
mentalities.
The young men who make the
decision to represent Stanford on
the gridiron deserve far better than

Housing problem
I was astounded to learn that a
supposedly responsible University
official such as the director of the
Housing Center, Rodger Whitney,
made a statement to the effect that
"student housing is not a very large
problem here at Stanford'' (The
Daily, Nov. 4). Who is he trying to
kid? No graduate students for sure.
H.V. Jagadish
Chair, ASSU Senate
Missile deployment
I wish to commend the editorial
staff of The Daily for its stand in
opposition to the stationing of new
nuclear missiles in Europe. As the
editorial writers (Daily, Nov. 3) put
it,"The Pershing missiles are first
strike weapons because of their
accuracy and ability to destroy
Soviet cities and command centers
with only a six to eight minute time
for error."
It should also be pointed out that
because of these features the
Soviets see these weapons as strate
gic, not just theater in nature, just
as the United States would if
medium-range nuclear missiles
were pointed at its cities from a
country as close as Mexico. The
deployment of the nearly undetec
table cruise and tirst-strike Persh
ings will make the Soviet extremely
nervous, leading them to depend
ever more on computer warnings of
missile attacks and to a possible
adoption of a launch-on-warning
strategy.
One correction to the editorial
does seem in order. The NATO
decision to deploy the cruise and
Pershing lis was made in January
1979 and, as Peter Pringle points
out in the London Observer news
paper of Oct. 16, 1983, it was made
in order to modernize the NATO
nuclear force, not as a response to
the SS-20s. Pringle got his informa
tion from classified documents of
NATO presented to the Observer.
My reading of the very pro-Soviet
East German press leaves me with
the understanding that the official
Warsaw Pact position is to oppose
the Pershing and cruise deployment
in Western Europe because among
other things, it would likely lead
the USSR to put nuclear weapons in
Eastern Europe as a response. This
position has been correctly per
ceived by The Daily.
The Warsaw Pact's proposal is to
reduce SS-20s to a level (142) equal
to that that the British and French
have or, to eliminate nuclear weap
ons totally from Europe if the
British, French and Americans agree
to do the same. This is in accor
dance with their announced sup
port for the Swedish government's
proposal to make Central Europe a
nuclear free zone, a proposal which
is opposed by the West German
government but endorsed by the
East German government.
We can only hope that something

sensible is done before the door to
the nuclear oven is shut.

Tenure and women
To provide female students at
Stanford with female faculty role
models ("Male professors still out
number female faculty," The Daily,
Nov. 1), will require taking Law
Prof. Barbara Babcock's suggestion
seriously University-wide, that is,
consciously selecting female faculty
when equally qualified male and
female candidates present them
selves for appointment and promo
tion. Such affirmative action re
quires an affirmative institutional
policy, attitude, culture and com
mitment, and not merely cosmetic
preemptive budgetary allocations,
staff positions and door signs.
Contrary to the statement made
in The Daily article about my
opinion, I personally do believe in
the power of affirmative action
when the program has high-level
clout, is not merely window dress
ing and cannot be abused.
To get the facts straight about my
"termination": I strongly believe
women at the University face dis
crimination, just like we do in all
other walks of life. The fact that I
was not considered for tenure
(distinct from being denied tenure
as indicated in the article) has an
apparently more mundane base on
the face of it, but this particular
case should not be used to contra
dict the general point.
When the Department of Com
munication (DoC) approached the
Faculty Affirmative Action Office
(AAO) with a minority female can
didate (myself) whom they claimed
was tenurable in three years, the
AAO agreed to pay half my salary to
help promote their cause.
The Humanities and Sciences
deanery and the AAO simultane
ously indicated to the DoC that
they might well have found a
tenurable woman but that this did
not guarantee them a tenure
track/tenured billet to evaluate her
against, when the time came for
review. The Dean pointed out that
getting a billet was not impossible
but the DoC would have to make a
case for it over the next couple of
years.
The files indicate that the DoC
apparently did nothing on this;
they may well have had other more
pressing matters to take up with the
Dean's office.
I write this to strengthen the
positions taken by Babcock and
Assistant Provost Cecilia Burciaga
and to correct the small errors in
the feature. It should be noted,
one, that the AAO did put money
behind a department's apparently
honest request to help increase the
number of tenurable women at
Stanford, and two, that the depart
ment concerned took the money,
hired me to teach their courses and
advise their students with it for as

gic, not just theater in nature, just
as the United States would if
medium-range nuclear missiles
were pointed at its cities from a
country as close as Mexico. The
deployment of the nearly undetec
table cruise and tirst-strike Persh
ings will make the Soviet extremely
nervous, leading them to depend
ever more on computer warnings of
missile attacks and to a possible
adoption of a launch-on-warning
strategy.
One correction to the editorial
does seem in order. The NATO
decision to deploy the cruise and
Pershing lis was made in January
1979 and, as Peter Pringle points
out in the London Observer news
paper of Oct. 16, 1983, it was made
in order to modernize the NATO
nuclear force, not as a response to
the SS-20s. Pringle got his informa
tion from classified documents of
NATO presented to the Observer.
My reading of the very pro-Soviet
East German press leaves me with
the understanding that the official
Warsaw Pact position is to oppose
the Pershing and cruise deployment
in Western Europe because among
other things, it would likely lead
the USSR to put nuclear weapons in
Eastern Europe as a response. This
position has been correctly per
ceived by The Daily.
The Warsaw Pact's proposal is to
reduce SS-20s to a level (142) equal
to that that the British and French
have or, to eliminate nuclear weap
ons totally from Europe if the
British, French and Americans agree
to do the same. This is in accor
dance with their announced sup
port for the Swedish government's
proposal to make Central Europe a
nuclear free zone, a proposal which
is opposed by the West German
government but endorsed by the
East German government.
We can only hope that something

sensible is done before the door to
the nuclear oven is shut.

Tenure and women
To provide female students at
Stanford with female faculty role
models ("Male professors still out
number female faculty," The Daily,
Nov. 1), will require taking Law
Prof. Barbara Babcock's suggestion
seriously University-wide, that is,
consciously selecting female faculty
when equally qualified male and
female candidates present them
selves for appointment and promo
tion. Such affirmative action re
quires an affirmative institutional
policy, attitude, culture and com
mitment, and not merely cosmetic
preemptive budgetary allocations,
staff positions and door signs.
Contrary to the statement made
in The Daily article about my
opinion, I personally do believe in
the power of affirmative action
when the program has high-level
clout, is not merely window dress
ing and cannot be abused.
To get the facts straight about my
"termination": I strongly believe
women at the University face dis
crimination, just like we do in all
other walks of life. The fact that I
was not considered for tenure
(distinct from being denied tenure
as indicated in the article) has an
apparently more mundane base on
the face of it, but this particular
case should not be used to contra
dict the general point.
When the Department of Com
munication (DoC) approached the
Faculty Affirmative Action Office
(AAO) with a minority female can
didate (myself) whom they claimed
was tenurable in three years, the
AAO agreed to pay half my salary to
help promote their cause.
The Humanities and Sciences
deanery and the AAO simultane
ously indicated to the DoC that
they might well have found a
tenurable woman but that this did
not guarantee them a tenure
track/tenured billet to evaluate her
against, when the time came for
review. The Dean pointed out that
getting a billet was not impossible
but the DoC would have to make a
case for it over the next couple of
years.
The files indicate that the DoC
apparently did nothing on this;
they may well have had other more
pressing matters to take up with the
Dean's office.
I write this to strengthen the
positions taken by Babcock and
Assistant Provost Cecilia Burciaga
and to correct the small errors in
the feature. It should be noted,
one, that the AAO did put money
behind a department's apparently
honest request to help increase the
number of tenurable women at
Stanford, and two, that the depart
ment concerned took the money,
hired me to teach their courses and
advise their students with it for as
long as they could, but did not do
the spade work and internal jug
gling required to create the billet
that they assured me and the AAO
they would consider me for.

SCIRE internships
Your editorial "Work, study, then
what?" (Daily, Nov. 1), asked the
question, "Why are these
(President Donald Kennedy and
Law School Dean john Hart Ely) and
other educators spending their time
emphasizing public service?"
SCIRE is a student-initiated group
that provides accredited internships
for undergraduates with more than
80 local non-profit agencies and
close to .K) local government
offices. After Thanksgiving our
winter quarter Clearinghouse cata
log will be available, with more
than 500 such opportunities. Al
though some internships in busi
ness are available, the bulk of Ihe
listings are in community service.
We are working closely with the
President's special assistant for
community service projects. We
work with CPPC, the internship
programs in psychology and com
munication, UPSE (School of Educa

tion), and share our resources with
human biology. Our catalog
supplements the ARLO catalog of
research opportunities with local
non-profit and government
agencies.
We want to encourage students
to match their community service
interests, commitment to volunteer
work with accredited projects such
as our internship program, l aced
with funding cuts, local non-profits
rely on interns and volunteers to
work with the handicapped, feed
the unemployed, counsel the bat
tered women, work with abused
children, organize peace confer
ences, teach in the schools and
local environmental projects. This
work can be accredited and com
plement a student's major or voca
tional interests.
Internships can provide in
valuable contact with community
professionals and help in assessing
career choices. Many students have
earned credit for projects based on
their Washington internships.

Football coaching
(During the past five and a half
years, because I have been serving
in the U.S. Air Force, we have been
forced to live outside of California.
Yet, little as we can afford to, we
contribute to the Buck Club and
return home in the fall — primarily
to visit Stanford and attend a
couple football games.
We flew to Los Angeles for the
Stanford-USC game and this
weekend we'll fly up to Stanford for
the Oregon game. These were
plans loyally made and paid lor last
spring. Today we are wondering
why.
This present coa< hing staff has
demonstrated the same losing
mentality for the past five years
typical of the lack Curtice regime in
the early 1960s and the jack Chris
tiansen regime in the 70s.
For a university that demands
excellence in its students, it is
beyond us why you do not demand
the same standards in your coach
ing personnel.
The tired old rationale that Stan
ford is too small and maintains too
strict academic requirements to
field a competitive football team
does not wash anymore: John
Ralston and Bill Walsh proved
otherwise. The quality of an athlete
on the football field at Stanford
during the past five years has been
no less than that of those who
played for Ralston and Walsh.
Furthermore, Stanford has dem
onstrated great superiority in other
sports — tennis, swimming, water
polo, baseball, cross country track,
etc. These sports are fortunate to
have coaches who profess winning
mentalities.
The young men who make the
decision to represent Stanford on
the gridiron deserve far better than
they are getting.
