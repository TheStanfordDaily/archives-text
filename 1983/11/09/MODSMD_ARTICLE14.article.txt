# Cranston clarifies
## 
### 
On Oct. 73 The Daily reported
that Sen. Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.) signed a letter sent to
University President Donald
Kennedy and the Board of Trus
tees pledging "unequivocal sup
port" for the proposed Reagan
complex. 7he following is an
open letter that Cranston has
since sent to Kennedy.
I wish to clarify that the Oct. 5
letter I signed with six of my
Senate colleagues was under
stood by me to be solely an ex
pression of support for a Ronald
Reagan presidential library at
Stanford. The letter was not
represented to me as an en
dorsement either of a museum
or of a politically oriented policy
center/think tank. I particularly
want to stress that I do not en
dorse such a center.
