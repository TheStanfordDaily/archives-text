# Toward your health: Jack Martin
## More food, less exercise leads to' Stanford 10' 
### JACK MARTIN 
Are you a Stanford 10? No, I am not as
king if you are a Bo Derek-like creature with
long blonde hair and a great body. A Stan
ford 10 is a student who gains 10 pounds
during his or her time at Stanford. Fresh
men, especially freshman women, are most
likely to become a Stanford 10, but the phe
nomenon is common to all students,
graduates as well as undergraduates, men
as well as women. While common, it is not
inevitable and today I will consider ways to
avoid it.
First of all, is a Stanford 10 a real concept
or just an exaggeration? The answer is that
it seems to be real. One study of a J2- per
son living unit found the average weight
gain to be seven and one-half pounds be
tween the start of school fall quarter and
the middle of spring quarter when the
study was conducted.
Why does it happen? Lack of nutritional
awareness and of the caloric content of
food is one answer. In the study mentioned
above, the persons who gained weight did
less well on a test of nutritional knowledge
as compared to those who showed no
weight gain. FHere is clearly a case of where
what you don't know can hurt you. Else
where on this page is a short nutritional
quiz. See how you do. For every question
you miss, give yourself one pound on the
road to becoming a Stanford 10.

Social events also foster poor eating
habits. Wine and cheese hours, sherry
hours, potlut ks — all tend to result in over
eating and eating food high in calories and
low in nutrition.
As I mentioned last week, academic
stress also plays a part in weight gain. It is
particularly important to pay attention to
one's eating habits around exam and paper
time. Try not to eat while studying. In fact it
is a good idea to limit your eating to specific
meal times and not snack during periods of
heavy studying.
What is the ultimate reason, then, for the
Stanford 10? I think it is due to the fact that
students are going from a situation in which
food intake and nutritional awareness was
monitored by someone else, to the point
where they are now assuming this responsi
bility for themselves.

students are going from a situation in which
food intake and nutritional awareness was
monitored by someone else, to the point
where they are now assuming this responsi

Are you a Stanford 10? No, I am not as
king if you are a Bo Derek-like creature with
long blonde hair and a great body. A Stan
ford 10 is a student who gains 10 pounds
during his or her time at Stanford. Fresh
men, especially freshman women, are most
likely to become a Stanford 10, but the phe
nomenon is common to all students,
graduates as well as undergraduates, men
as well as women. While common, it is not
inevitable and today I will consider ways to
avoid it.
First of all, is a Stanford 10 a real concept
or just an exaggeration? The answer is that
it seems to be real. One study of a J2- per
son living unit found the average weight
gain to be seven and one-half pounds be
tween the start of school fall quarter and
the middle of spring quarter when the
study was conducted.
Why does it happen? Lack of nutritional
awareness and of the caloric content of
food is one answer. In the study mentioned
above, the persons who gained weight did
less well on a test of nutritional knowledge
as compared to those who showed no
weight gain. FHere is clearly a case of where
what you don't know can hurt you. Else
where on this page is a short nutritional
quiz. See how you do. For every question
you miss, give yourself one pound on the
road to becoming a Stanford 10.

Social events also foster poor eating
habits. Wine and cheese hours, sherry
hours, potlut ks — all tend to result in over
eating and eating food high in calories and
low in nutrition.
As I mentioned last week, academic
stress also plays a part in weight gain. It is
particularly important to pay attention to
one's eating habits around exam and paper
time. Try not to eat while studying. In fact it
is a good idea to limit your eating to specific
meal times and not snack during periods of
heavy studying.
What is the ultimate reason, then, for the
Stanford 10? I think it is due to the fact that
students are going from a situation in which
food intake and nutritional awareness was
monitored by someone else, to the point
where they are now assuming this responsi
bility for themselves.
