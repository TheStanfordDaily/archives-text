# Booters face USF tonight

### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
The Stanford men's soc
cer team faces the Univer
sity of San Francisco at 7:30
tonight in the Negoesco
Stadium in one of Stan
ford's toughest games of
the year.
Tonight's game will be
the most important game of
the season since a win over
USF would give Stanford a
push towards the NCAA
playoffs. A loss would end
all hopes of a playoff berth.
"The whole season rests
on tomorrow night's
game," Stanford Coach
Nelson Lodge said yester
day. "If we beat USF and
Fresno State, we are pretty
much assured of getting in
the playoffs."
The game could also
make or break USF's
chance at the playoffs. If
the Dons win, they must go
on to beat Cal. But a loss
does not ruin all hopes of a
playoff berth.
USF has played one of
the toughest schedules in
the Pacific Soccer Confer
ence and has played very

well on the road.
Therefore, USF's Sports In
formation Director Peter
Simon seems to think that
the Dons have an advan
tage over Stanford for a
wildcard berth in the
playoffs.
"We just beat Portland 4-
1 and Stanford lost there (2-
1)," he said. "Portland's
coach is on the playoff se
lection committee which
does not help Stanford
much."
Although the Dons have
won a total of 16 games,
they are not unbeatable.
They lost to San Jose State
which Stanford tied 2-2.
"All our losses have
been by only one goal,"
Simon said. "You don't
have to be a better team in
soccer to win — sometimes
you get beat by mistakes."
USF made a big mistake
against San Jose. Going
into the game USF was so
confident that it played its
second string goalie. The
ball went right under him
for the winning goal.
One of the reasons that

USF has been difficult to
beat is that its style of soc
cer has been very different
from the other collegiate
teams.
"Our players are mostly
foreign and their skill level
is different from other
teams," Simon said. "We
pass it more often, and
keep the ball on the
ground. There is no long
ballplay."
The Dons are lead by two
Norwegians, freshmen
Cato Anderson and Theo
Norvestad, who have
tallied 11 goals and 10 goals
respectively.
"Cato can do it all,"
Simon said. "He's scored in
every way possible. He's
very dangerous and may
well be the most skilled
player in the league."
Stanford will be more
prepared for this game, in
terms of players, than any
other game this season.
Lodge will have an arsenal
of tough players to give
Stanford tremendous
depth.
