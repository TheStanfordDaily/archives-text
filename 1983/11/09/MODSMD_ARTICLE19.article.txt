## McCarthy confidently swings on to scene 
### BETH KLEID 
Freshman golfer Kathy
McCarthy loves attention.
"I'm a ham," she said. "I
love to show off. I love a
gallery. It makes me feel
great to have people out
there watching me."
McCarthy is getting a
good dose of what she
loves. Last weekend she
won the individual compe
tition in the Stanford Wo
men's Fall Intercollegiate,
and set a course record of
215. It was quite an auspi
cious beginning for the
freshman's collegiate golf
career. The win has made
McCarthy an instant star on
the Farm, and her entrance
on the scene is being well
received.
"People who have hardly
talked to me before are
coming up to me and
saying, 'Congratulations,'
and the attention feels so
good," she said.
But the freshman's early
success was not unex
pected. She talks of other
impressive finishes in
tournaments that indicate
her prowess.
McCarthy won the Cali
fornia State Junior Tourna
ment in 1982, and was a
semi-finalist at the USCN
National Juniors in the
same year. This year she
tied for second place low
amateur in the U.S. Open.
Although the freshman
was nervous in the Stanford
tournament because "it
was my first one here,"
McCarthy did not even
shock herself with her win.
"I always rely on a saying
that a friend once told me:
'If you order chicken

you've got no beef com
ing.' In other words, I
decided to go for the gusto.
I was determined, " she
said.
"Because I was so ner
vous, I had to keep remind
ing myself to be arrogant,"
she continued. "I had to
keep my head about me.
'Cath, I know you can do
it,' I kept saying to myself."
McCarthy's determina
tion paid off, but obviously
her mental attitude is not
all that makes her such a
fine golfer.
McCarthy, who hails
from Fresno, has dedicated
herself to golf since the age
of 12. In the first tourna
ment she played in at age
13, she averaged a score of
126. Now, only four years
later, she averages a 76.
"My improvement was
due to a lot of hard work on
my part, and good instruc
tion from my dad and my
pro, Steve Adams," she
said.
The golfer credits her fa
ther, a six-handicapper, for
introducing her to the
sport. "My dad has
definitely pushed me in my
golf career."
McCarthy's father may
have pushed a little too
much during a certain per
iod. When McCarthy was a
sophomore at San Joaquin
Memorial in Fresno she was
on the verge of putting the
clubs in the closet — for
good.
"I felt that I was playing
for my dad, and not for
myself," she said.
Then something clicked,
and McCarthy decided to

stay with golf.
"Something within me
said to just go out there and
do it, and I did," she said.
In retrospect, McCarthy
is thankful that her dad
took such an active role in
her golf career. "I think

that i! he wasn't so tough
on me , I wouldn't be so
tough on myself."
The freshman is thankful
that she chose to keep
hacking away at the golf
ball because she truly loves
the sport. "I think that I

love it now more than I
ever have. I love it because
I can meet so many neat
people, and go to so many
places."
But the thing that
McCarthy loves most about
golfing is the thrill of win
ning. She said the feeling
that she gets when she is
holding a winning trophy in
front of a crowd of people
and making an acceptance
speech is almost in
describable. "I wish that I
could go on forever," she
said.
McCarthy credits golf for
helping her to grow up.
The sport, which is
dominated by adults, has
taught her how to "get
along well" with a different
generation.
But her ability to easily
befriend adults has not af
fected her ability to make
friends of her own age. In
fact, McCarthy describes
her adjustment to the Farm
as a smooth one.
"The adjustment has
been good in regard to golf
and everything else," she
said.
McCarthy is pleased with
the golf program here. She
said that she feels the team
members have accepted
her. But, "of course they
tease me a lot because I'm
a freshman."
And again, McCarthy
loves the attention. The
freshman bursts with a
sense of self-confidence
which she has gained as a
result of her golfing.
Being away from home
has given the freshman
even more confidence. It
has also made her feel that

she is playing golf only for
herself.
"I have so much confi
dence in myself that it is al
most scary. I know that I
have worked hard — my
coach tells me so, and my
scores show it. I know that
I'm good enough to beat
people. And having so
many supporters here at
Stanford just adds to the
confidence."
McCarthy exhibits this
self-assurance on the golf
course. As a player, she
describes herself as
"aggressive" and
"determined."
"I'm very competitive,
but in a quiet fashion. I
don't throw clubs around
or say bad words."
Despite her self
confidence, McCarthy does
get nervous at times. Cal
ming her emotions is one
of the improvements that
she would like to make in
her game. "I have to work
on being less emotional,"
she said.
She does not like to let
these emotions carry over
to her everyday life. "I am
not a moody person, and I
like to leave it at the golf
course. "
But when McCarthy wins
a tournament, she can't
help but feel a lift in her
spirits for the whole day.
McCarthy's goals for the
future are by no means
modest. "I want to be an
All-America at Stanford. I
want to be the best amateur
in the country, and the best
college player in the
country. And if things keep
progressing the way they
are — I want to be a pro."

confidence, McCarthy does
get nervous at times. Cal
ming her emotions is one
of the improvements that
she would like to make in
her game. "I have to work
on being less emotional,"
she said.
She does not like to let
these emotions carry over
to her everyday life. "I am
not a moody person, and I
like to leave it at the golf
course. "
But when McCarthy wins
a tournament, she can't
help but feel a lift in her
spirits for the whole day.
McCarthy's goals for the
future are by no means
modest. "I want to be an
All-America at Stanford. I
want to be the best amateur
in the country, and the best
college player in the
country. And if things keep
progressing the way they
are — I want to be a pro."

Freshman golfer Kathy
McCarthy loves attention.
"I'm a ham," she said. "I
love to show off. I love a
gallery. It makes me feel
great to have people out
there watching me."
McCarthy is getting a
good dose of what she
loves. Last weekend she
won the individual compe
tition in the Stanford Wo
men's Fall Intercollegiate,
and set a course record of
215. It was quite an auspi
cious beginning for the
freshman's collegiate golf
career. The win has made
McCarthy an instant star on
the Farm, and her entrance
on the scene is being well
received.
"People who have hardly
talked to me before are
coming up to me and
saying, 'Congratulations,'
and the attention feels so
good," she said.
But the freshman's early
success was not unex
pected. She talks of other
impressive finishes in
tournaments that indicate
her prowess.
McCarthy won the Cali
fornia State Junior Tourna
ment in 1982, and was a
semi-finalist at the USCN
National Juniors in the
same year. This year she
tied for second place low
amateur in the U.S. Open.
Although the freshman
was nervous in the Stanford
tournament because "it
was my first one here,"
McCarthy did not even
shock herself with her win.
"I always rely on a saying
that a friend once told me:
'If you order chicken

you've got no beef com
ing.' In other words, I
decided to go for the gusto.
I was determined, " she
said.
"Because I was so ner
vous, I had to keep remind
ing myself to be arrogant,"
she continued. "I had to
keep my head about me.
'Cath, I know you can do
it,' I kept saying to myself."
McCarthy's determina
tion paid off, but obviously
her mental attitude is not
all that makes her such a
fine golfer.
McCarthy, who hails
from Fresno, has dedicated
herself to golf since the age
of 12. In the first tourna
ment she played in at age
13, she averaged a score of
126. Now, only four years
later, she averages a 76.
"My improvement was
due to a lot of hard work on
my part, and good instruc
tion from my dad and my
pro, Steve Adams," she
said.
The golfer credits her fa
ther, a six-handicapper, for
introducing her to the
sport. "My dad has
definitely pushed me in my
golf career."
McCarthy's father may
have pushed a little too
much during a certain per
iod. When McCarthy was a
sophomore at San Joaquin
Memorial in Fresno she was
on the verge of putting the
clubs in the closet — for
good.
"I felt that I was playing
for my dad, and not for
myself," she said.
Then something clicked,
and McCarthy decided to

stay with golf.
"Something within me
said to just go out there and
do it, and I did," she said.
In retrospect, McCarthy
is thankful that her dad
took such an active role in
her golf career. "I think

that i! he wasn't so tough
on me , I wouldn't be so
tough on myself."
The freshman is thankful
that she chose to keep
hacking away at the golf
ball because she truly loves
the sport. "I think that I

love it now more than I
ever have. I love it because
I can meet so many neat
people, and go to so many
places."
But the thing that
McCarthy loves most about
golfing is the thrill of win
ning. She said the feeling
that she gets when she is
holding a winning trophy in
front of a crowd of people
and making an acceptance
speech is almost in
describable. "I wish that I
could go on forever," she
said.
McCarthy credits golf for
helping her to grow up.
The sport, which is
dominated by adults, has
taught her how to "get
along well" with a different
generation.
But her ability to easily
befriend adults has not af
fected her ability to make
friends of her own age. In
fact, McCarthy describes
her adjustment to the Farm
as a smooth one.
"The adjustment has
been good in regard to golf
and everything else," she
said.
McCarthy is pleased with
the golf program here. She
said that she feels the team
members have accepted
her. But, "of course they
tease me a lot because I'm
a freshman."
And again, McCarthy
loves the attention. The
freshman bursts with a
sense of self-confidence
which she has gained as a
result of her golfing.
Being away from home
has given the freshman
even more confidence. It
has also made her feel that

she is playing golf only for
herself.
"I have so much confi
dence in myself that it is al
most scary. I know that I
have worked hard — my
coach tells me so, and my
scores show it. I know that
I'm good enough to beat
people. And having so
many supporters here at
Stanford just adds to the
confidence."
McCarthy exhibits this
self-assurance on the golf
course. As a player, she
describes herself as
"aggressive" and
"determined."
"I'm very competitive,
but in a quiet fashion. I
don't throw clubs around
or say bad words."
Despite her self
confidence, McCarthy does
get nervous at times. Cal
ming her emotions is one
of the improvements that
she would like to make in
her game. "I have to work
on being less emotional,"
she said.
