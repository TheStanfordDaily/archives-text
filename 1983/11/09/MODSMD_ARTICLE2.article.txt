# ASSU Senate clarifies role of Guest Professorship Bureau

### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Responding to concern over the
vague bylaws of the Guest Profes
sorship Bureau, the ASSU Senate
last night granted the GPB a more
defined set of operational
guidelines.
In addition, the Senate passed a
bill allowing the GPB to invite indi
vidual speakers as well as guest pro
fessors to the campus.
The bill clarifying the GPB gover
nance guidelines was a result of sug
gestions from the Provost's Office,
according to Senate Chair Jug
Jagadish.
"Basically, the Provost's Office
told us that they would not accredit
any courses proposed by the GPB
unless we redefined the bylaws,"
Jagadish said.
The bill revising the bylaws,
authored by senator Roland Van
Gaalen, was submitted to the
Provost's Office 20 days ago. Associ
ate Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Carolyn Lougee responded
yesterday afternoon with a list of
minor changes in the bill.
Lougee suggested a change in
wording that would allow SWOPSI
courses to be taught by guest pro
fessors, but the senate voted it
down. GPB Director Nathan
Bostrom objected to the idea be
cause he felt it would encourage
SWOPSI to propose GPB courses.
"If we were to open up to
SWOPSI, we'd become just another
funding board," Bostrom said.

Senator David Porter argued that
it is common knowledge that the
CPB is solely responsible for
proposing its own courses, and then
going to a department to ask for ac
creditation.
"Why would we bring a course
through SWOPSI?" he asked.
"SYVOPSI would be just another
channel to go through after we pro
pose a course."

Senator Chris O'Brien com
mented that GPB courses have gen
erally been applicable toward a
major, and SWOPSI courses would
not fit that requirement.
"It seems to me," graduate
senator Eric Berg argued, "that it has
been more the practice to invite
people who are controversial and
who we think should have a forum,
than to invite people who fill there

quirements of a particular major."
According to O'Brien, a SWOPSl
sponsored GPB course would
destroy the credibility of the pro
gram.
"If you bring SWOPSI into this,
the entire program will go down the
drain," he said. "SWOPSI is just too
flaky."
The senate also passed a bill
authored by graduate senator Jim
McGrath, which gives the GPB the
right to invite speakers as well as
professors to the University.
The legislation was a result of con
cern over the limited budget of this
year's Speakers Bureau, and the cur
rent inability of the GPB to find a
guest professor to teach this year.
Several senators felt that this would
turn the GPB into another Speakers
Bureau.
"In future years, this will create an
imbalance between the number of
speakers and the number of profes
sors we invite," graduate senator
Dan Lerner said. "It's much easier to
find people to come for short stays,
and the GPB will opt for the easier
thing."
Other senators, however, pointed
out that the fee assessment all
ocated to the GPB was not being
utilized.
"We should look at student inter
ests," senator Donna Anderson
said, adding that "since the
Speakers Bureau is not funded, we
should at least use the GPB money."
