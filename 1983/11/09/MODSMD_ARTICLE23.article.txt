Hippy hour
The Chief likes to call our Friday at Five affairs
"Hippy hour," but don't worry, the theme for this
week's whatever-you-want-to-call-it won't be beat
niks. There will be a theme though â€” and a special
location. The Chief, a true slob, did not want to
clean her apartment, so she got one of the special
chieftains to agree to host the hour. Fteather's
having us to Potter, so maybe the theme should
simply be "Party with yourself."
Oh, I almost forgot. The most hippy-like photo
editor promises to be there.
