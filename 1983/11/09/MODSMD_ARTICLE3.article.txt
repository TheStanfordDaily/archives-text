O'Neill supports invasion
Washington — Congressional opposition to the United
States' military intervention in Grenada all but collapsed
yesterday when House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass.) accepted the conclusion of a bipartisan fact-finding
panel that President Reagan was justified in sending U.S.
armed forces to evacuate American students on the island.
O'Neill, who was told the fact-finding group concluded
that American lives were potentially in jeopardy before the
Oct. 25 invasion, issued a statement saying, "Since this was
the case, I believe that sending American forces into com
bat was justified under these particular circumstances."
Before dispatching the 14-member delegation to assess
the situation, O'Neill had declared that he did not like what

had happened and said that Reagan had been searching for
two years for "this opportunity to get into Grenada."
After meeting with the speaker yesterday afternoon,
House Majority Whip Thomas Foley (D-Wash.) told
reporters a "very large majority" of the group agreed that
Reagan had acted properly.
Marines pulled from outpost
Beirut, Lebanon — A force of nearly 200 U.S. Marines was
pulled out of a strategic but isolated outpost here yesterday
to reduce their exposure to sniping and shelling as a fragile
cease-fire appeared to hold between the Lebanese armv
and hostile militia forces.
Despite sporadic shelling and sniper fire, yesterday was
largely calm, in marked contrast to Monday's heavy fight
ing between the Lebanese army and Shiite Moslem and

Druze militiamen, the worst outbreaks since September. A
spokesman for the Shiite organization Amal said two
civilians had been killed and nearly HO injured during the
fighting. There was no report of army casualties.
Beirut International Airport, which was closed for several
hours Monday night during the shelling, returned to full
operation yesterday morning. Shops and schools in Mos
lem sections of Beirut, meanwhile, closed in sympathy with
similar shutdowns in southern Lebanon protesting Israel's
military occupation of the area and its recent restriction on
travel between northern and southern Lebanon.
