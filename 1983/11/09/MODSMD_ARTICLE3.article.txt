O'Neill supports invasion
Washington — Congressional opposition to the United
States' military intervention in Grenada all but collapsed
yesterday when House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass.) accepted the conclusion of a bipartisan fact-finding
panel that President Reagan was justified in sending U.S.
armed forces to evacuate American students on the island.
O'Neill, who was told the fact-finding group concluded
that American lives were potentially in jeopardy before the
Oct. 25 invasion, issued a statement saying, "Since this was
the case, I believe that sending American forces into com
bat was justified under these particular circumstances."
Before dispatching the 14-member delegation to assess
the situation, O'Neill had declared that he did not like what

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

had happened and said that Reagan had been searching for
two years for "this opportunity to get into Grenada."
After meeting with the speaker yesterday afternoon,
House Majority Whip Thomas Foley (D-Wash.) told
reporters a "very large majority" of the group agreed that
Reagan had acted properly.
Marines pulled from outpost
Beirut, Lebanon — A force of nearly 200 U.S. Marines was
pulled out of a strategic but isolated outpost here yesterday
to reduce their exposure to sniping and shelling as a fragile
cease-fire appeared to hold between the Lebanese armv
and hostile militia forces.
Despite sporadic shelling and sniper fire, yesterday was
largely calm, in marked contrast to Monday's heavy fight
ing between the Lebanese army and Shiite Moslem and

Druze militiamen, the worst outbreaks since September. A
spokesman for the Shiite organization Amal said two
civilians had been killed and nearly HO injured during the
fighting. There was no report of army casualties.
Beirut International Airport, which was closed for several
hours Monday night during the shelling, returned to full
operation yesterday morning. Shops and schools in Mos
lem sections of Beirut, meanwhile, closed in sympathy with
similar shutdowns in southern Lebanon protesting Israel's
military occupation of the area and its recent restriction on
travel between northern and southern Lebanon.
Tripoli begs Arafat to leave
Tripoli, Lebanon — Civic and religious leaders here
pleaded with Yasser Arafat to spare this war-battered port
city the destruction they said will occur if it becomes the
main battleground of the war between Palestinians.
While Arafat agreed to "avert a bloodbath in
Tripoli," members of his force who had filtered into
the city remained here, firing heavy weapons they
installed in the harbor area three days ago.
. .1 will only fight in self-defense and the deci
sion on war or peace is theirs," he said, referring to
Palestinian rebels and their Syrian backers who are
battling his force.
The besieged leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organization appeared to make no commitment to
withdraw his fighters from the downtown area nor
did he promise to remove the rockets and cannons
installed to defend Arafat's last redoubt in Lebanon,
the Baadawi refugee camp on the northern out
skirts.
Indeed, Arafat's gunners fired more than 40 rock
ets from the harbor positions during his hour-long
meeting at city hall at midday. Ripostes could be
heard from Syrian artillery and rocket positions
south of Tripoli. At least half a dozen shells fell
around the densely populated downtown neighbor
hood where Arafat has recently established offices,
and where his fighters are gathering.
Reporters at the scene saw nine casualties, resi
dents of the area, being taken away on stretchers to
hospitals.
Feinstein wins re-election
San Francisco — Mayor Dianne Feinstein crushed a
handful of opponents yesterday and easily won re
election on a ballot that also featured several contro
versial measures, including a call for repeal of laws
that require bilingual ballots.
With 100 percent of the precinct ballots counted,
however, Registrar of Voters Jay Patterson said the
outcome of two hotly contested initiative battles —
downtown planning and smoking in offices — will
remain undecided until 6500 to 7000 more absentee
ballots are counted today.
With all 707 precincts tallied, the mayor had
108,062 votes, or 79.6 percent of the ballots,
compared to the 10,143 votes of her nearest op
ponent, Cesar Ascarrunz. Other contestants and

their totals included Gloria Estella Laßiva, 7328; Pat
Wright, 4366; Brian Lantz, 3295; and Carrie Drake,
2535.
Proposition O, which calls tor the repeal of federal
laws requiring bilingual ballots, won 61.6 percent of
the vote, 89,740 for and 55,924 against. And a mea
sure opposing U.S. involvement in El Salvador won
by a margin of 74,627 to 65,366.
The downtown planning measure, Proposition M,
was too close to call with 72,095 no votes and 71,524
yes votes. And the anti-smoking measure, Proposi
tion P, also was close, with 74,624 votes for and
73,546 votes against. Patterson said the uncounted
absentee ballots could change the outcome of either
measure.
Here is a summary of the results of other major
races in yesterday's elections:
CONGRESS:
Washington State — Republican Dan Evans
defeated liberal Democrat Mike Lowry. Evans
retained the seat he was appointed to after the death
of Sen. Henry "Scoop'' Jackson.
Georgia — Legislator George "Buddy" Darden
won a House seat by defeating kathryn McDonald,
widow of ultra-conservative Rep. Larry McDonald,
who was killed when the Soviets shot down a Korean
Air Lines passenger jet. Darden, a Democrat, had
finished second to McDonald in an open primary
election last month.
GOVERNOR:
Kentucky — Democratic Lt. Gov. Martha Layne
Collins defeated former baseball player Jim Bun
ning. She became the state's first woman governor
and the only woman among the nation's 50 gover
nors.
Mississippi — Democrat Bill Allain defeated Repub
lican Leon Bramlett, whose supporters claimed Al
lain had sex with male prostitutes. Allain, the state
attorney general, took a lie detector test in the cam
paign's final days that he said proved the
homosexuality charge was false.
Pentagon considers Beirut reprisal
Washington — The Pentagon has prepared
"contingency plans" for a military strike against
Syrian or other forces in Lebanon in retaliation for
the bombing last month of the U.S. Marine
headquarters in Beirut, but Reagan administration
officials and civilian analysts said yesterday that poli

tical and military considerations severely limit their
options.
The options discussed by the loint Chiefs ot Staff
since the bombing — said to range from small,
commando-style raids to full-scale air strikes — all
carry such risks that some administration officials
say the Pentagon is reluctant to strongly recommend
any action tor tear it would lead to a deeper, "no
win" military involvement.
Grenada casualty reports increase
Hunter Army Airfield, Ca. — The senior U.S. Army
officer directing the invasion of Grenada estimated
yesterday that 160 Grenadian soldiers and 71 Cubans
were killed in the warfare, which previously had
been described as a surgical operation with few
casualties.
Both the White House and Pentagon moved swift
ly to distance themselves from the figures. White
House officials said no Grenadian casualty figures
have been "validated" by the administration or
"officially reported."
A Pentagon spokesman said that the Defense De
partment has not revised its official count of 59 op
posing soldiers killed and 57 wounded.
Public approves of invasion
Washington — Public approval of President
Reagan's handling of the invasion of Grenada ap
pears to have produced wide-ranging political
benefits for him, according to a new Washington
Post-ABC News opinion poll.
For the first time since April, Reagan has edged
ahead of the two leading Democratic candidates in
trial heats for the 1984 election, and his overall
popularity rating is higher than at any time since
September 1981.
Opinion analysts said that this kind of "rallying
around the president" often occurs during a crisis
and that there is no way of knowing how long it will
last.
On the negative side for Reagan, the poll also
shows concern that he may be bringing the country
closer to war and indicates some discontentment
about his handling of the big federal budget deficit.

Senate passes nerve gas bill
Washington — The Senate approved 47-46 yester
day the production of a new generation ot nerve gas
weapons, as Vice President George Bush cast the
deciding vote on the issue tor the second time in

billion military spending bill, which includes every
major weapons program requested by President
Reagan, including nerve gas, the MX missile and
long-range B-1 bombers.
Stocks down in slow trading
New York — The stock market edged lower yester
day in the slowest trading in two months.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrials, off 22.46
points over the past three sessions, inched up 0.10
to 1214.94 after being up more than 4 points earlier
in the day. The Dow )ones transportation average
also rose but its utilities measure lost a fraction.

Proposition O, which calls tor the repeal of federal
laws requiring bilingual ballots, won 61.6 percent of
the vote, 89,740 for and 55,924 against. And a mea
sure opposing U.S. involvement in El Salvador won
by a margin of 74,627 to 65,366.
The downtown planning measure, Proposition M,
was too close to call with 72,095 no votes and 71,524
yes votes. And the anti-smoking measure, Proposi

73,546 votes against. Patterson said the uncounted
absentee ballots could change the outcome of either
measure.
Here is a summary of the results of other major
races in yesterday's elections:
CONGRESS:
Washington State — Republican Dan Evans
defeated liberal Democrat Mike Lowry. Evans
retained the seat he was appointed to after the death
of Sen. Henry "Scoop'' Jackson.
Georgia — Legislator George "Buddy" Darden
won a House seat by defeating kathryn McDonald,
widow of ultra-conservative Rep. Larry McDonald,
who was killed when the Soviets shot down a Korean
Air Lines passenger jet. Darden, a Democrat, had
finished second to McDonald in an open primary
election last month.
GOVERNOR:
Kentucky — Democratic Lt. Gov. Martha Layne
Collins defeated former baseball player Jim Bun
ning. She became the state's first woman governor
and the only woman among the nation's 50 gover
nors.
Mississippi — Democrat Bill Allain defeated Repub
lican Leon Bramlett, whose supporters claimed Al
lain had sex with male prostitutes. Allain, the state
attorney general, took a lie detector test in the cam
paign's final days that he said proved the
homosexuality charge was false.
Pentagon considers Beirut reprisal
Washington — The Pentagon has prepared
"contingency plans" for a military strike against
Syrian or other forces in Lebanon in retaliation for
the bombing last month of the U.S. Marine
headquarters in Beirut, but Reagan administration
officials and civilian analysts said yesterday that poli

tical and military considerations severely limit their
options.
The options discussed by the loint Chiefs ot Staff
since the bombing — said to range from small,
commando-style raids to full-scale air strikes — all
carry such risks that some administration officials
say the Pentagon is reluctant to strongly recommend
any action tor tear it would lead to a deeper, "no
win" military involvement.
Grenada casualty reports increase
Hunter Army Airfield, Ca. — The senior U.S. Army
officer directing the invasion of Grenada estimated
yesterday that 160 Grenadian soldiers and 71 Cubans
were killed in the warfare, which previously had
been described as a surgical operation with few
casualties.
Both the White House and Pentagon moved swift
ly to distance themselves from the figures. White
House officials said no Grenadian casualty figures
have been "validated" by the administration or
"officially reported."
A Pentagon spokesman said that the Defense De
partment has not revised its official count of 59 op
posing soldiers killed and 57 wounded.
Public approves of invasion
Washington — Public approval of President
Reagan's handling of the invasion of Grenada ap
pears to have produced wide-ranging political
benefits for him, according to a new Washington
Post-ABC News opinion poll.
For the first time since April, Reagan has edged
ahead of the two leading Democratic candidates in
trial heats for the 1984 election, and his overall
popularity rating is higher than at any time since
September 1981.
Opinion analysts said that this kind of "rallying
around the president" often occurs during a crisis
and that there is no way of knowing how long it will
last.
On the negative side for Reagan, the poll also
shows concern that he may be bringing the country
closer to war and indicates some discontentment
about his handling of the big federal budget deficit.

Senate passes nerve gas bill
Washington — The Senate approved 47-46 yester
day the production of a new generation ot nerve gas
weapons, as Vice President George Bush cast the
deciding vote on the issue tor the second time in
tour months.
The Senate went on to vote 86-6 for a record $253
billion military spending bill, which includes every
major weapons program requested by President
Reagan, including nerve gas, the MX missile and
long-range B-1 bombers.
Stocks down in slow trading
New York — The stock market edged lower yester
day in the slowest trading in two months.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrials, off 22.46
points over the past three sessions, inched up 0.10
to 1214.94 after being up more than 4 points earlier
in the day. The Dow )ones transportation average
also rose but its utilities measure lost a fraction.
Today weather
Cloudy with a chance of rain spreading south to
about San lose. Highs in the upper 50s and 60s.
Southerly winds to 15 mph.
O'Neill supports invasion
Washington — Congressional opposition to the United
States' military intervention in Grenada all but collapsed
yesterday when House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass.) accepted the conclusion of a bipartisan fact-finding
panel that President Reagan was justified in sending U.S.
armed forces to evacuate American students on the island.
O'Neill, who was told the fact-finding group concluded
that American lives were potentially in jeopardy before the
Oct. 25 invasion, issued a statement saying, "Since this was
the case, I believe that sending American forces into com
bat was justified under these particular circumstances."
Before dispatching the 14-member delegation to assess
the situation, O'Neill had declared that he did not like what

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

had happened and said that Reagan had been searching for
two years for "this opportunity to get into Grenada."
After meeting with the speaker yesterday afternoon,
House Majority Whip Thomas Foley (D-Wash.) told
reporters a "very large majority" of the group agreed that
Reagan had acted properly.
Marines pulled from outpost
Beirut, Lebanon — A force of nearly 200 U.S. Marines was
pulled out of a strategic but isolated outpost here yesterday
to reduce their exposure to sniping and shelling as a fragile
cease-fire appeared to hold between the Lebanese armv
and hostile militia forces.
Despite sporadic shelling and sniper fire, yesterday was
largely calm, in marked contrast to Monday's heavy fight
ing between the Lebanese army and Shiite Moslem and

Druze militiamen, the worst outbreaks since September. A
spokesman for the Shiite organization Amal said two
civilians had been killed and nearly HO injured during the
fighting. There was no report of army casualties.
Beirut International Airport, which was closed for several
hours Monday night during the shelling, returned to full
operation yesterday morning. Shops and schools in Mos
lem sections of Beirut, meanwhile, closed in sympathy with
similar shutdowns in southern Lebanon protesting Israel's
military occupation of the area and its recent restriction on
travel between northern and southern Lebanon.
Tripoli begs Arafat to leave
Tripoli, Lebanon — Civic and religious leaders here
pleaded with Yasser Arafat to spare this war-battered port
city the destruction they said will occur if it becomes the
main battleground of the war between Palestinians.
While Arafat agreed to "avert a bloodbath in
Tripoli," members of his force who had filtered into
the city remained here, firing heavy weapons they
installed in the harbor area three days ago.
. .1 will only fight in self-defense and the deci
sion on war or peace is theirs," he said, referring to
Palestinian rebels and their Syrian backers who are
battling his force.
The besieged leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organization appeared to make no commitment to
withdraw his fighters from the downtown area nor
did he promise to remove the rockets and cannons
installed to defend Arafat's last redoubt in Lebanon,
the Baadawi refugee camp on the northern out
skirts.
Indeed, Arafat's gunners fired more than 40 rock
ets from the harbor positions during his hour-long
meeting at city hall at midday. Ripostes could be
heard from Syrian artillery and rocket positions
south of Tripoli. At least half a dozen shells fell
around the densely populated downtown neighbor
hood where Arafat has recently established offices,
and where his fighters are gathering.
Reporters at the scene saw nine casualties, resi
dents of the area, being taken away on stretchers to
hospitals.
Feinstein wins re-election
San Francisco — Mayor Dianne Feinstein crushed a
handful of opponents yesterday and easily won re
election on a ballot that also featured several contro
versial measures, including a call for repeal of laws
that require bilingual ballots.
With 100 percent of the precinct ballots counted,
however, Registrar of Voters Jay Patterson said the
outcome of two hotly contested initiative battles —
downtown planning and smoking in offices — will
remain undecided until 6500 to 7000 more absentee
ballots are counted today.
With all 707 precincts tallied, the mayor had
108,062 votes, or 79.6 percent of the ballots,
compared to the 10,143 votes of her nearest op
ponent, Cesar Ascarrunz. Other contestants and

their totals included Gloria Estella Laßiva, 7328; Pat
Wright, 4366; Brian Lantz, 3295; and Carrie Drake,
2535.
Proposition O, which calls tor the repeal of federal
laws requiring bilingual ballots, won 61.6 percent of
the vote, 89,740 for and 55,924 against. And a mea

O'Neill supports invasion
Washington — Congressional opposition to the United
States' military intervention in Grenada all but collapsed
yesterday when House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass.) accepted the conclusion of a bipartisan fact-finding
panel that President Reagan was justified in sending U.S.
armed forces to evacuate American students on the island.
O'Neill, who was told the fact-finding group concluded
that American lives were potentially in jeopardy before the
Oct. 25 invasion, issued a statement saying, "Since this was
the case, I believe that sending American forces into com
bat was justified under these particular circumstances."
Before dispatching the 14-member delegation to assess
the situation, O'Neill had declared that he did not like what

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

had happened and said that Reagan had been searching for
two years for "this opportunity to get into Grenada."
After meeting with the speaker yesterday afternoon,
House Majority Whip Thomas Foley (D-Wash.) told
reporters a "very large majority" of the group agreed that
Reagan had acted properly.
Marines pulled from outpost
Beirut, Lebanon — A force of nearly 200 U.S. Marines was
pulled out of a strategic but isolated outpost here yesterday
to reduce their exposure to sniping and shelling as a fragile
cease-fire appeared to hold between the Lebanese armv
and hostile militia forces.
Despite sporadic shelling and sniper fire, yesterday was
largely calm, in marked contrast to Monday's heavy fight
ing between the Lebanese army and Shiite Moslem and

Druze militiamen, the worst outbreaks since September. A
spokesman for the Shiite organization Amal said two
civilians had been killed and nearly HO injured during the
fighting. There was no report of army casualties.
Beirut International Airport, which was closed for several
hours Monday night during the shelling, returned to full
operation yesterday morning. Shops and schools in Mos
lem sections of Beirut, meanwhile, closed in sympathy with
similar shutdowns in southern Lebanon protesting Israel's
military occupation of the area and its recent restriction on
travel between northern and southern Lebanon.
Tripoli begs Arafat to leave
Tripoli, Lebanon — Civic and religious leaders here
pleaded with Yasser Arafat to spare this war-battered port
city the destruction they said will occur if it becomes the
main battleground of the war between Palestinians.
While Arafat agreed to "avert a bloodbath in
Tripoli," members of his force who had filtered into
the city remained here, firing heavy weapons they
installed in the harbor area three days ago.
. .1 will only fight in self-defense and the deci
sion on war or peace is theirs," he said, referring to
Palestinian rebels and their Syrian backers who are
battling his force.
The besieged leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organization appeared to make no commitment to
withdraw his fighters from the downtown area nor
did he promise to remove the rockets and cannons
installed to defend Arafat's last redoubt in Lebanon,
the Baadawi refugee camp on the northern out
skirts.
Indeed, Arafat's gunners fired more than 40 rock
ets from the harbor positions during his hour-long
meeting at city hall at midday. Ripostes could be
heard from Syrian artillery and rocket positions
south of Tripoli. At least half a dozen shells fell
around the densely populated downtown neighbor
hood where Arafat has recently established offices,
and where his fighters are gathering.
Reporters at the scene saw nine casualties, resi
dents of the area, being taken away on stretchers to
hospitals.
Feinstein wins re-election
San Francisco — Mayor Dianne Feinstein crushed a
handful of opponents yesterday and easily won re
election on a ballot that also featured several contro
versial measures, including a call for repeal of laws
that require bilingual ballots.
With 100 percent of the precinct ballots counted,
however, Registrar of Voters Jay Patterson said the
outcome of two hotly contested initiative battles —
downtown planning and smoking in offices — will
remain undecided until 6500 to 7000 more absentee
ballots are counted today.
With all 707 precincts tallied, the mayor had
108,062 votes, or 79.6 percent of the ballots,
compared to the 10,143 votes of her nearest op
ponent, Cesar Ascarrunz. Other contestants and

their totals included Gloria Estella Laßiva, 7328; Pat
Wright, 4366; Brian Lantz, 3295; and Carrie Drake,
2535.
Proposition O, which calls tor the repeal of federal
laws requiring bilingual ballots, won 61.6 percent of
the vote, 89,740 for and 55,924 against. And a mea
sure opposing U.S. involvement in El Salvador won
by a margin of 74,627 to 65,366.
The downtown planning measure, Proposition M,
was too close to call with 72,095 no votes and 71,524
yes votes. And the anti-smoking measure, Proposi
tion P, also was close, with 74,624 votes for and
73,546 votes against. Patterson said the uncounted
absentee ballots could change the outcome of either
measure.
Here is a summary of the results of other major
races in yesterday's elections:
CONGRESS:
Washington State — Republican Dan Evans
defeated liberal Democrat Mike Lowry. Evans
retained the seat he was appointed to after the death
of Sen. Henry "Scoop'' Jackson.
Georgia — Legislator George "Buddy" Darden
won a House seat by defeating kathryn McDonald,
widow of ultra-conservative Rep. Larry McDonald,
who was killed when the Soviets shot down a Korean
Air Lines passenger jet. Darden, a Democrat, had
finished second to McDonald in an open primary
election last month.
GOVERNOR:
Kentucky — Democratic Lt. Gov. Martha Layne
Collins defeated former baseball player Jim Bun
ning. She became the state's first woman governor
and the only woman among the nation's 50 gover
nors.
Mississippi — Democrat Bill Allain defeated Repub
lican Leon Bramlett, whose supporters claimed Al
lain had sex with male prostitutes. Allain, the state
attorney general, took a lie detector test in the cam
paign's final days that he said proved the
homosexuality charge was false.
Pentagon considers Beirut reprisal
Washington — The Pentagon has prepared
"contingency plans" for a military strike against
Syrian or other forces in Lebanon in retaliation for
the bombing last month of the U.S. Marine
headquarters in Beirut, but Reagan administration
officials and civilian analysts said yesterday that poli

tical and military considerations severely limit their
options.
The options discussed by the loint Chiefs ot Staff
since the bombing — said to range from small,
commando-style raids to full-scale air strikes — all
carry such risks that some administration officials
say the Pentagon is reluctant to strongly recommend
any action tor tear it would lead to a deeper, "no
win" military involvement.
Grenada casualty reports increase
Hunter Army Airfield, Ca. — The senior U.S. Army
officer directing the invasion of Grenada estimated
yesterday that 160 Grenadian soldiers and 71 Cubans
were killed in the warfare, which previously had
been described as a surgical operation with few
casualties.
Both the White House and Pentagon moved swift
ly to distance themselves from the figures. White
House officials said no Grenadian casualty figures
have been "validated" by the administration or
"officially reported."
A Pentagon spokesman said that the Defense De
partment has not revised its official count of 59 op
posing soldiers killed and 57 wounded.
Public approves of invasion
Washington — Public approval of President
Reagan's handling of the invasion of Grenada ap
pears to have produced wide-ranging political
benefits for him, according to a new Washington
Post-ABC News opinion poll.
For the first time since April, Reagan has edged
ahead of the two leading Democratic candidates in
trial heats for the 1984 election, and his overall
popularity rating is higher than at any time since
September 1981.
Opinion analysts said that this kind of "rallying
around the president" often occurs during a crisis
and that there is no way of knowing how long it will
last.
On the negative side for Reagan, the poll also
shows concern that he may be bringing the country
closer to war and indicates some discontentment
about his handling of the big federal budget deficit.

billion military spending bill, which includes every
