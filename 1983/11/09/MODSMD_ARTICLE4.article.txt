# Close races in Palo Alto election
## Woolley leads council field 
### SAM DELSON 
Gail Woolley led a field of ten can
didates in the Palo Alto City Council
election last night, winning the
council seat that eluded her by bare
ly 100 votes two years ago.
With 29 of 38 precincts reporting,
it appeared that incumbents Leland
Levy and Emily Renzel were success
ful in their re-election bids.
Planning Commissioner Jack
Sutorius held a narrow lead after
midnight over Pat Cullen and Steve
Player for the final four-year term.
Woolley's campaign called for
new zoning measures to limit com
mercial growth and encourage affor
dable housing. An 18-year resident
of Palo Alto, she chairs the Palo Alto
Historic Resources Board and is a
part-time teacher at Jordan Middle
School.
She fell just short of winning a
seat on the council in 1981, but
came back this year, more deter
mined than ever.
In the race for a special two-year
council term, Bob Moss held a nar
row 60-vote lead over incumbent
Anne Witherspoon. Moss had 3849
votes to Witherspoon's 3789.
Moss ran unsuccessful campaigns
for City Council in 1979 and 1981. A
veteran community activist, he
criticized Witherspoon for being too
sympathetic to new commercial
developments.
With 19 of 41 precincts reporting
in the school board race, incumbent
Alan Davis led the field of seven can
didates with 3457 votes. Stanford
Education Prof. Robert Calfee was in
second place with 3190, while attor
ney Joe Simitian led Stanford
graduate Al Russell 2782-2615 for the
third and final seat.
All three of the proposed amend
ments to the city charter appeared
to have passed by comfortable mar
gins.
Measure C, which would abolish
the office of city controller and
replace it with a city auditor, was
leading by a margin of more than 3-
1.
Measures D and F, which would

empower the City Council to ap
point an independent cable televi
sion board and select a cable fran
chise, both won the support of
more than two-thirds of the voters.
The Santa Clara County referen
dum on a proposed tax levy to
finance jail construction had the
support of just over half of the
voters, but it fell short of the two
(hirds margin necessary for its adop
tion.
Woolley led the council field with
6899 votes, while Levy and Renzel
were second and third, with 5695
and 5612 votes respectively.
Sutorius held a 561-vote margin
(wer Cullen for the final seat on the
council. Sutorius had 50h8 votes,
compared to 4507 for Cullen and
4295 for Player.
Trailing the leaders were Liberta

rian Cassandra Moore, with 1719
votes, Jeari Ramacciotti (1184), Mary
Beth Baldwin (870) and Donald Gan
sheimer (859). Write-in candidate
Ronald Bennett did not receive any
votes.
Moore was the subject of most of
the publicity about the campaign.
Her Libertarian positions were sig
nificantly different from those of the
other candidates, and her campaign
tactics led to two significant contro
versies.
In late September, she challenged
the constitutionality of a city or
dinance which bars campaign signs
from public property in residential
neighborhoods.
Moore eventually removed her
disputed signs, but a new contro
versy arose last weekend when she
mass-mailed a "Republican Voter

Guide" which was not authorized
by the Republican Party or the other
four candidates listed in the flyer.
Moore campaign manager Bill
Evers said he didn't believe the
disputes over tactics cost his can
didate votes.
"The race was a gamble for us
from the beginning," said Evers. "It
looks like our viewpoint was just too
unusual for Palo Altans to accept at
this point."
The city clerk's office reported re
ceiving an unusually large number
of last-minute absentee ballots.
Close races, such as the one be
tween Moss and Witherspoon for
the two-year seat, will probably be
determined by those absentee bal
lots.
