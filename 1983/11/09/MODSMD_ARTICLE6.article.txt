# Transplant program receives funding
## 
### BRYCE LEE Staff writer 
A $7.85 million National Heart
Lung and Blood Institute grant
aimed at continuing heart
transplants here may assist in the
ongoing development of a
combined heart and lung transplant
operation, according to Edward
Stinson, head of the Medical Cen
ter's cardiac transplant program.
The five-year grant — announced
officially last month — might addi
tionally aid researchers in discover
ing better methods of preventing
the body from rejecting someone
else's heart after a transplant opera
tion, Stinson said. He added that
the funding could also help scien
tists uncover ways of understanding
and alleviating the side effects of
anti-rejection drugs currently used
in transplantation.
Combined heart and lung opera
tions have been performed 15 times
here since March 1981.
Stinson said he hopes that heart
only transplantation — first per
formed here in 1968 and demon
strated to be lifesaving and
therapeutic for some patients — will
be routinely paid for by insurance
companies during the new funding
period, which is scheduled to expire
in April 1988.
The Health Care Financ ing Admin
istration has yet to determine whe
ther heart-only transplantation is eli
gible for reimbursement, according
to Stinson.
"By the end of the next five years,
I hope that it (heart-only
transplantation) is universally ac
cepted within the health industry of
this country," he said in a recent in
terview.
Limited federal funds currently
help pay for certain transplantation
patient costs not covered by insur
ance. However, Stinson said this
money is being phased out during
the next five-year budget.
Survival rates, Stinson said, are 81
percent for one year and 71 percent
for two years among the more than
80 patients who have received
transplants since the introduction of
cyclosporin, a new anti-rejection
drug.
