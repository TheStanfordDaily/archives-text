## The 						Stanford Daily The 						problem with tenure 
### 
When there are only 118 women on a faculty
of 1266, one doesn't have to look too deeply to
realize that the University lacks women faculty
members. However, just as troubling, and not
quite so obvious, is the fact that while 785 male
faculty members have tenured positions here,
only 48 women share that same honor.
The University must recognize that it should
not only increase the number of women faculty
it hires but also provide them with tenured
positions. Ducking the tenure question, Uni
versity administrators have pointed to the fact
that they are hiring manv more women faculty.
And this is true in some departments such as
Humanities, but not so true tor others like the
Business School, which onlv has one women
on a faculty of 67.
The University should be applauded for its
hiring efforts but these lovver-level positions
do not easily pan out to tenured positions
seven years later — as Estelle Freedman, Diana
Paul, Diane Tillinghast and Bella Mody will tell
you.
But is this problem limited to a women and
tenure issue? Not really. It is more generally a
tenure problem. The main trouble is that
tenured positions are limited in number and
that the process of moving up any lower-level
faculty member into these spots is therefore a
slow one. The women the University is tur
rently hiring for the most part are for these
lower-level positions.
What the University doesn't seem to be
doing, however, is seeking out well-respected,

tenured women faculty at other schools across
the country to come here. Not only would this
provide superior instructors but it would aid in
more efficiently rectifying the existing im
balance in tenured positions. The University
certainly has a history of doing the same for
distinguished men facultv.
In their quest for quality education, academ
ic departments here have not in the past shied
away from paying higher salaries to attract
good male instructors. Why should the strat
egy change for women? It certainly is cheaper
to have a high turnover of women in lower
paid positions than to pay for tenured women,
but it isn't good academics.
The University — and more importantly the
individual departments within — just cannot
give the excuse that there are not enough
qualified, tenure-level women faculty to be
found. The more tenured female faculty the
University has, the more li kely it will be able to
persuade well-qualified women to work here
in the future. No woman would want to come
work for a school if she thinks that she will
have little to no chance for advancement.
Another consideration which should not be
ignored is more psychological. Just how effec
tive can women instructors — a mere 10 per
cent of the faculty — be as role models for the
40 percent of the student body who are wo
men? A University should not ignore 40 per
cent of its students to whom it ought to pro
vide leadership examples from which to learn.
