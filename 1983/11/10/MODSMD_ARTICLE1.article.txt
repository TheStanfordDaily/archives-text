Reagan complex
unacceptable
without Hoover

The White House, in a strongly worded
letter, has warned that Stanford is making
the president "an offer he cannot accept"
by proposing that a Reagan presidential
complex built here not include a public af
fairs center run by the Hoover Institution.
The letter, written in response to a Board
of Trustees warning that a Hoover
administered center "has little chance of
approval," appears to rule out any chance
that a Reagan complex will come to Stan
ford unless the Board accepts in its entirety
the plan proposed by Hoover and endorsed
by the White House.

Signed by Presidential Counselor Edwin
Meese and addressed to Board President
William Kimball, the letter charges that Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy has bro
ken a longtime commitment to the
presidential library complex by opposing
the idea of a Hoover-run center.
"I am fully aware of the fact that Dr. Ken
nedy had approved the proposal linking the
library and the center when (Hoover Direc
tor) Glenn Campbell wrote President
Reagan on 24 February 1981 extending an
invitation to him to have his presidential
complex located on the Stanford campus,"
the Meese letter says.
"In addition, I had learned from Glenn
Campbell that he wrote a lengthy
memorandum to Dr. Kennedy in January of
this year informing him of his pleasure that
in a conversation a week earlier they had
both enthusiastically endorsed the idea of a
Reagan presidential library complex on the
Stanford campus."

That claim is contrary to what Kennedy
has said all along: that he gave general ap
proval to the idea of bringing the Reagan
papers here but never made any commit
ments about elements of the proposed
complex.
In October 1981, then-Hoover Associate
Director Richard Burress told the Stanford
University News Service that the February
1981 Campbell letter to Reagan was "very
straightforward" and concerned only ar
chival deposit of the president's papers — a
version that contradicts the one offered by
Meese.
I he Meese letter said it was on the basis
of the Kennedy-Campbell understanding —
which, Meese said, outlined in some detail
the way in which the three parts of the com
plex were all linked together — that Reagan
wrote to Campbell last January authorizing
Hoover and the University to prepare a pro
posal incorporating a library, museum and
center for public affairs.

"Frankly, I do not understand the specific
reasons why you and some of the other
trustees apparently are opposed to having
the proposed center for public affairs ad
ministered by the Hoover Institution.

"I would hope that further discussion
could resolve whatever issues remain so
that we can proceed expeditiously on the
presidential library complex proposal,
Meese said.
He also expressed hope "that the matter
can be resolved quickly, so that we can
respond to the other proposals which have
been made in confidence to us." He was
apparently referring to the preliminary bid
for the Reagan papers made by the chancel
lor of UC-Santa Barbara, and the proposals
reportedly made by USC, Pepperdine Uni
versity and a number of other institutions
The letter, copies of which were obtained
bv The Daily and other newspapers yester
day, is apparently still in the mail to Kimball.
His secretary said yesterday that Kimball
had received "absolutely nothing from the
White House." Kimball was out of town and
unavailable for comment.
