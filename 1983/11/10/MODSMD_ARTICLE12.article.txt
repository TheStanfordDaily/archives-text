Question: What do Athletic Director Andy
Geiger and President Reagan have in common?
Answer: They both have a nasty problem.
They can't seem to get their books to balance.
Now this situation wouldn't be a problem if
we were talking about small sums, say a billion
or so for the Fed and a thousand or so for the
Athletic Department. But just as a $200 billion
deficit is an astronomical amount for the
federal budget, $500,000 is not a small amount
in the Athletic Department's $10 million
budget.
In both cases, the causes of the budget defi
cit are rather obvious. Reagan cut taxes and
raised defense spending at the same time —
not a very good way to balance the budget.
Geiger has a different problem. Nobody is
showing up at his football games any more.
Perhaps the 1-8 record and the questionable
coaching have something to do with it.
What confounds the problem even more is
that the $500,000 deficit was posted last year.
This year's expected deficit is now estimated to
be at least $634,000.
Last year was John Elway's senior year. And
we had four televised games, two of which
were broadcast nationally. That's the maximum
air time permitted under current NCAA rules.
So what more could we want — or certainly ex
pect — in revenues from the football program?
Why didn't the department see the problem
coming sooner? Deficits of $500,000 don't just
fall out of the sky. And an athletic director
should have the fiscal responsibility to make
sure they don't.

We just can't believe that the Athletic De
partment expected the football program to
make as much money this year as it did last
year. And its almost as hard to believe that they
didn't think about the "structural problems"
they blame for their current financial woes.
University President Donald Kennedy has
taken the first step in the right direction by ap
pointing a committee to review the situation.
Hopefully the committee will soon leave the
"data-gathering mode" and start coming up
with some hard recommendations.
We hope the committee will not suffer from
the same myopic outlook that seems to have
caused this situation in the first place They
must look beyond ways to increase television
and gate receipts — neither of which will hap
pen until the football team starts winning. It's
also not fair to cut back on other sports (where
by and large the teams are performing superb
ly).
It does no good for the Athletic Department
administrators to vaguely blame smaller sports
programs and especially women's athletics.
What needs to be done — and what should
have been done earlier if the department had
had any foresight — is to better its fund-raising
methods.
Now at least it seems like the department ad
ministrators have been concerned enough to
do something about their troubles — or at least
were forced to take action. They are finally
looking ahead to the future and hopefully are
doing some actual fiscal planning as well. And
it's about time.
