# Ethics of the group response
## 
### 
I am embarrassed to admit it, but
* until last week I had never been to a
rally. What finally impelled me to go
was a combination of doubt over
Reagan's invasion of Grenada and
good advertising.
A flier was distributed in my
dining hall announcing an
"Informational Rally in Solidarity
with the People of Grenada." The
focus of the rally was to be on "The

Does it mean that
the blacks who
volunteered to join
the Marines are
traitors to the black
community?

Black Community Response to the
Invasion." I went to the rally, lis
tened to the speakers, and realized
that either I went to the wrong rally
<or the the flier was written in
Newspeak. (1984 is only two months
away.)
In plain English the flier would
have read, "A Misinformational Ral
ly in Solidarity with the Former Dic
tator of Grenada," featuring "The
Black CofTimunist Response to the
Invasion." If the rally were ad
vertised" this way, one less person
would up — me. The
rest of the approving crowd knew
what to expect.
« Nonetheless, it was a learning ex
perience. The moderator, Faye
Knox, began by telling the crowd,
Mgnorance is no excuse." She then
pointed to the literature table,
where I found an objective account
of the invasion by the unbiased
''League of Revolutionary Struggle."
the League describes itself as

' dedicated to building a communist
party which can lead the struggle of
the working people — (you know
the rest.)
But I don t want to sound flippant
about a serious issue. The disturb
ing thing about the rally was not its
radical orientation or its opposition
to the Grenada invasion. What was
disturbing was that it was billed as
"The Black Community Response."
Does the use of that phrase mean
that blacks who supported the inva
sion aren't really blacks? Or that
they are not part of the black com
munity? Does it mean that the
blacks who volunteered to join the
Marines are traitors to the black
community?
If it means any of these things,
then the rally did more damage to
the black individuality that it did to
U.S. imperialism.
The main speaker at the rally,
Simon Jones, touched on the issue
of black community and identity
when he posed the question. "Who
are we?" He pointed out the differ
ing self-perceptions blacks had, but
rather than applauding the diversity
of black opinion, he expressed
"embarrassment" that some black
countries supported the invasion
and even sent troops, that black
Marines landed on the island, and
that some blacks he knew thought
the invasion "might have been a
good idea."
Despite his embarrassment at the
fact that there were blacks who
dared to disagree with him, he
showed no embarrassment that his
view was being presented as "The
Black Community Response."
After Jones' speech, members of
the Chicano and Asian communities
contributed their "solidarity state
ments."
The "Third World Solidarity'' ap
proach to politics may be an ex
pedient way to stage well-attended
rallies and present a United Front,
but it also has another effect.
Presenting an ethnic-American

view, especially on world events,
can alienate minority students who
feel a cultural attachment to their
ethnic group but no attachment to
radical politics. Their rejection of
group political stands causes them
to disassociate themselves not only
from the group's political life, but
also from its cultural life, since the
organization's "leaders" inter
mingle the two so heavily.
The organizers of the Grenada ral
ly may not have taken all of this into
consideration when they drew up
the flier. Their purpose, like the pur
pose of all political organizers, Left
or Right, is to promote the immedi
ate cause rather than to tell the
truth.
President Reagan's assertion that
the Grenada operation was not an
invasion but a "rescue mission" is
an example of this kind of duplicity.
But before their world solidarity

solidarity
"rep resen ta fives "
cast any stones, they
should take a look at
their own persuasion
methods.

"representatives" cast any stones,
they should take a look at their own
persuasion methods.
Maybe then they'll be able to fight
for their next cause with something
better than what lules Feiffer calls
"separate but equal lies."

Midnight Ramblings
I am embarrassed to admit it, but
* until last week I had never been to a
rally. What finally impelled me to go
was a combination of doubt over
Reagan's invasion of Grenada and
good advertising.
A flier was distributed in my
dining hall announcing an
"Informational Rally in Solidarity
with the People of Grenada." The
focus of the rally was to be on "The

Does it mean that
the blacks who
volunteered to join
the Marines are
traitors to the black
community?

Black Community Response to the
Invasion." I went to the rally, lis
tened to the speakers, and realized
that either I went to the wrong rally
<or the the flier was written in
Newspeak. (1984 is only two months
away.)
In plain English the flier would
have read, "A Misinformational Ral
ly in Solidarity with the Former Dic
tator of Grenada," featuring "The
Black CofTimunist Response to the
Invasion." If the rally were ad
vertised" this way, one less person
would up — me. The
rest of the approving crowd knew
what to expect.
« Nonetheless, it was a learning ex
perience. The moderator, Faye
Knox, began by telling the crowd,
Mgnorance is no excuse." She then
pointed to the literature table,
where I found an objective account
of the invasion by the unbiased
''League of Revolutionary Struggle."
the League describes itself as

' dedicated to building a communist
party which can lead the struggle of
the working people — (you know
the rest.)
But I don t want to sound flippant
about a serious issue. The disturb
ing thing about the rally was not its
radical orientation or its opposition
to the Grenada invasion. What was
disturbing was that it was billed as
"The Black Community Response."
Does the use of that phrase mean
that blacks who supported the inva
sion aren't really blacks? Or that
they are not part of the black com
munity? Does it mean that the
blacks who volunteered to join the
Marines are traitors to the black
community?
If it means any of these things,
then the rally did more damage to
the black individuality that it did to
U.S. imperialism.
The main speaker at the rally,
Simon Jones, touched on the issue
of black community and identity
when he posed the question. "Who
are we?" He pointed out the differ
ing self-perceptions blacks had, but
rather than applauding the diversity
of black opinion, he expressed
"embarrassment" that some black
countries supported the invasion
and even sent troops, that black
Marines landed on the island, and
that some blacks he knew thought
the invasion "might have been a
good idea."
Despite his embarrassment at the
fact that there were blacks who
dared to disagree with him, he
showed no embarrassment that his
view was being presented as "The
Black Community Response."
After Jones' speech, members of
the Chicano and Asian communities
contributed their "solidarity state
ments."
The "Third World Solidarity'' ap
proach to politics may be an ex
pedient way to stage well-attended
rallies and present a United Front,
but it also has another effect.
Presenting an ethnic-American

view, especially on world events,
can alienate minority students who
feel a cultural attachment to their
ethnic group but no attachment to
radical politics. Their rejection of
group political stands causes them
to disassociate themselves not only
from the group's political life, but
also from its cultural life, since the
organization's "leaders" inter
mingle the two so heavily.
The organizers of the Grenada ral
ly may not have taken all of this into
consideration when they drew up
the flier. Their purpose, like the pur
pose of all political organizers, Left
or Right, is to promote the immedi
ate cause rather than to tell the
truth.
President Reagan's assertion that
the Grenada operation was not an
invasion but a "rescue mission" is
an example of this kind of duplicity.
But before their world solidarity

"representatives" cast any stones,

Maybe then they'll be able to fight
for their next cause with something
better than what lules Feiffer calls
"separate but equal lies."
