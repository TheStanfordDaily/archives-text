ROTC feedback
The Daily editorial entitled "No
uniforms, please" (Daily, Nov. 3)
gave a brief history on the demise
of ROTC at Stanford and the cur
rent efforts of some students to
pursue military studies without
ROTC on campus. All fine and good
as this is history and news. The
editorial board then goes on to
state its opinion that the decision to
drop ROTC at Stanford made by the
Faculty Senate in 1970, was the
correct one. Again, I can find no
fault with this as the decision was
made and everyone is entitled to
express feelings about its
appropriateness. It is the statement
that "Military studies have no place
in an academic institution" with
which I take issue. It seems to me
that this is merely an extension of
the liberal thinking that is begin
ning to stifle academic freedom at
Stanford.
I have been a Stanford graduate
student for little over a year, yet in
that time I have seen such things as
attempts to censor a guest profes
sor's lectures and an inquisition
into the Hoover Institution started
because of the political beliefs of
some of its scholars. Now you are
saying that military studies don't
belong in an academic environ
ment! Where do they belong then?
Military science should be differ
entiated from military training and
perhaps you suffer from a lack of
understanding in what military
science entails. It is not the
"science of killing people more
efficiently" as your editorial claims.
Granted that tactics are a part of the
curriculum (for Army ROTC at
least), but so are leadership, ethics,
discipline and a plethora of other
skills useful in everyday life. A
well-rounded ROTC program offers
more to a student that "how to kill
people."
It seems that Stanford is quick to
point to its academic credentials in
recruiting new students, yet unwill
ing to accept the responsibility of
providing them an academically
free environment. I sincerely hope
that this trend will not continue
since everyone will lose in the end.

Just as the persecutors of Mac
hiavelli did not change the per
tinence of his ideas, The Daily and
the anti-ROTC faculty will not
change today's real world by
pretending that the politics of
armed force is not a legitimate topic
of study. The appeal the subject of
military studies holds for some
should not be a factor in allowing it
to be studied on campus. Could we
allow pro-lifers to prevent abortion
from being taught at the Med
School, or let Catholics stand in the
way of birth control courses, simply
because these subjects "trouble
them deeply?" Certainly not at this

bastion ot academic freedom.
I am in favor of letting The Daily
and the extremist faculty they en
dorse sneer at military studies as
being beneath their dignity. Who
cares, after all? What I do not agree
with is denying those students who
do want to study military science
here the opportunity to do so.

Hooray for john Bard, )r.'s recent
letter to The Daily ("Yes on ROTC,"
Nov. 8) concerning ROTC on
campus. In addition to Mr. Bard's
arguments, I would like to add the
following thoughts on the subject.
The issue of "faculty selection"
would surely arise should the Fac
ulty Senate begin to discuss the
return of ROTC to campus. A pri
mary reason for the University's
decision to drop ROTC more than a
decade ago was that the method of
appointing the military officers who
taught ROTC was an unacceptable
departure from the procedure used
in appointing all other members of
the faculty.

Should ROTC return to campus,
the faculty itself would have control
over the proposed appointments of
ROTC instructors. ROTC instructors
must meet University standards
before they are assigned to a teach
ing position. In accordance with
this policy, the faculty should retain
its right to reject candidates of their
choice and become more selective
in their search. For example, at MIT
only engineering graduates are
considered for ROTC instructor
appointments. In Stanford's case,
the faculty could select a Stanford
graduate who has demonstrated an
exceptional academic record as well
as fine teaching ability.
Finally, sad to say, every
denouncement of ROTC instruction
on campus complains that ROTC
courses taught by military officers
lack the intellectual content and
academic standards that generally
prevail at Stanford. What this "knee
jerk" response ignores is that the
course goals set by ROTC can in
fact be expanded upon to provide
the higher academic standards that
the Stanford Faculty Senate is
looking for. The Department of
Defense only provides basic
guidelines for the courses; what is
wrong with the faculty developing
additional coursework to meet
needs? I might add that one does
not find the study of "killing people
more efficiently" among these
course goals. Rather, Air Force
ROTC courses focus on the history
of air power, leadership and man
agement (a course covering many
of the same topics I.E. 100 does),
and a review of national security
policy in contemporary American
society.
Implicit in much of my argument
is an attitude of cooperation be
tween the Department of Defense
and the Stanford faculty to work
out the inherent problems of an
ROTC program at Stanford, particu
larly that of instructor appoint-

ments. At first glance, generating
this cooperation appears to be a
colossal task, but I believe it can be
done.

After reading the editorial, "No
uniforms, please," we became
deeply disturbed by The Daily's
serious misconception of what
ROTC courses are and the situation
Stanford's ROTC students are in.
Students who wish to enroll in
ROTC courses must do so at other
colleges, paying that school's tui
tion in addition to Stanford's and
often at the sake of missing Stan
ford classes. Midday commuting
during Stanford "prime class time"
is a serious problem which could
be solved by allowing ROTC in
struction on campus. As Stanford
students, these people should not
be denied opportunities at Stanford
simply because they desire enroll
ment in ROTC. Often conflicts arise
(especially for upperclassmen who
must fulfill graduation require
ments) in which attendance at
ROTC is impossible, but must still
be made up.
The ROTC students who are
pushing for its return, including
ourselves, are not receiving aca
demic class credit for their efforts.
The arrangement these students
have with the ROTC detachment at
San Jose State University is that
some time donated to this cause
can be used to partially makeup
missed non-academic leadership
training time.
It is also unfortunate that so
many people misinterpret the
meaning of military science
courses. The AFROTC program
consists of two parts, essentially
independent of each other. The
Professional Officer Course, a
two-year sequence taken by up
perclassmen, is the academic
"military science" portion of the
program. Students take a year-long
course each in "Organizational
Leadership and Management" and
"American Defense Policy." In no
way is the "science of killing
people more efficiently" a part of
the ROTC curriculum.
We couldn't agree more that it
would be preposterous to grant
credit for learning how to kill. The
fact of the matter is that these
courses are not inferior in academic
content to other courses here. In
the name of academic freedom,
how can anyone be so judgmental?
The other half of the ROTC pro
gram, dubbed "leadership lab" is
essentially an ongoing exercise in
running a military organization and
does not receive academic credit.
One would think that the Univer
sity would prefer having its
graduates, who have probably been
exposed to a far broader range of
ideas that service academy
graduates, to hold key positions in
the American military. As long as it
seems inevitable that the United
States will have a national defense,
one should pose the question:
What kind of people do you want in
the military? Would you rather not
have highly qualified Stanford
graduates making military deci
sions?

The Daily states its belief that the
faculty acted "wisely and rational
ly" when it forced the ROTC pro
gram off campus in 1970. What year
was that again? Doubtless readers
can evaluate for themselves what
factors other than wisdom and cool
thinking might have entered into
the faculty's decision; among other
things, the annoyance of having
"campus radicals . . . trashing the
campus," as The Daily quaintly put
it, might be taken into account.
Given the tenor of those times, I
would doubt that rationality was the
governing consideration.

ROTC courses focus on the history
of air power, leadership and man
agement (a course covering many
of the same topics I.E. 100 does),
and a review of national security
policy in contemporary American
society.
Implicit in much of my argument
is an attitude of cooperation be

and the Stanford faculty to work
out the inherent problems of an
ROTC program at Stanford, particu

After reading the editorial, "No
uniforms, please," we became
deeply disturbed by The Daily's
serious misconception of what
ROTC courses are and the situation
Stanford's ROTC students are in.
Students who wish to enroll in
ROTC courses must do so at other
colleges, paying that school's tui
tion in addition to Stanford's and
often at the sake of missing Stan
ford classes. Midday commuting
during Stanford "prime class time"
is a serious problem which could
be solved by allowing ROTC in
struction on campus. As Stanford
students, these people should not
be denied opportunities at Stanford
simply because they desire enroll
ment in ROTC. Often conflicts arise
(especially for upperclassmen who
must fulfill graduation require
ments) in which attendance at
ROTC is impossible, but must still
be made up.
The ROTC students who are
pushing for its return, including
ourselves, are not receiving aca
demic class credit for their efforts.
The arrangement these students
have with the ROTC detachment at
San Jose State University is that
some time donated to this cause
can be used to partially makeup
missed non-academic leadership
training time.
It is also unfortunate that so
many people misinterpret the
meaning of military science
courses. The AFROTC program
consists of two parts, essentially
independent of each other. The
Professional Officer Course, a
two-year sequence taken by up
perclassmen, is the academic
"military science" portion of the
program. Students take a year-long
course each in "Organizational
Leadership and Management" and
"American Defense Policy." In no
way is the "science of killing
people more efficiently" a part of
the ROTC curriculum.
We couldn't agree more that it
would be preposterous to grant
credit for learning how to kill. The
fact of the matter is that these
courses are not inferior in academic
content to other courses here. In
the name of academic freedom,
how can anyone be so judgmental?
The other half of the ROTC pro
gram, dubbed "leadership lab" is
essentially an ongoing exercise in
running a military organization and
does not receive academic credit.
One would think that the Univer
sity would prefer having its
graduates, who have probably been
exposed to a far broader range of
ideas that service academy
graduates, to hold key positions in
the American military. As long as it
seems inevitable that the United
States will have a national defense,
one should pose the question:
What kind of people do you want in
the military? Would you rather not
have highly qualified Stanford
graduates making military deci
sions?

The Daily states its belief that the
faculty acted "wisely and rational
ly" when it forced the ROTC pro
gram off campus in 1970. What year
was that again? Doubtless readers
can evaluate for themselves what
factors other than wisdom and cool
thinking might have entered into
the faculty's decision; among other
things, the annoyance of having
"campus radicals . . . trashing the
campus," as The Daily quaintly put
it, might be taken into account.
Given the tenor of those times, I

ROTC feedback
The Daily editorial entitled "No
uniforms, please" (Daily, Nov. 3)
gave a brief history on the demise
of ROTC at Stanford and the cur
rent efforts of some students to
pursue military studies without
ROTC on campus. All fine and good
as this is history and news. The
editorial board then goes on to
state its opinion that the decision to
drop ROTC at Stanford made by the
Faculty Senate in 1970, was the
correct one. Again, I can find no
fault with this as the decision was
made and everyone is entitled to
express feelings about its
appropriateness. It is the statement
that "Military studies have no place
in an academic institution" with
which I take issue. It seems to me
that this is merely an extension of
the liberal thinking that is begin
ning to stifle academic freedom at
Stanford.
I have been a Stanford graduate
student for little over a year, yet in
that time I have seen such things as
attempts to censor a guest profes
sor's lectures and an inquisition
into the Hoover Institution started
because of the political beliefs of
some of its scholars. Now you are
saying that military studies don't
belong in an academic environ
ment! Where do they belong then?
Military science should be differ
entiated from military training and
perhaps you suffer from a lack of
understanding in what military
science entails. It is not the
"science of killing people more
efficiently" as your editorial claims.
Granted that tactics are a part of the
curriculum (for Army ROTC at
least), but so are leadership, ethics,
discipline and a plethora of other
skills useful in everyday life. A
well-rounded ROTC program offers
more to a student that "how to kill
people."
It seems that Stanford is quick to
point to its academic credentials in
recruiting new students, yet unwill
ing to accept the responsibility of
providing them an academically
free environment. I sincerely hope
that this trend will not continue
since everyone will lose in the end.

Just as the persecutors of Mac
hiavelli did not change the per
tinence of his ideas, The Daily and
the anti-ROTC faculty will not
change today's real world by
pretending that the politics of
armed force is not a legitimate topic
of study. The appeal the subject of
military studies holds for some
should not be a factor in allowing it
to be studied on campus. Could we
allow pro-lifers to prevent abortion
from being taught at the Med
School, or let Catholics stand in the
way of birth control courses, simply
because these subjects "trouble
them deeply?" Certainly not at this

bastion ot academic freedom.
I am in favor of letting The Daily
and the extremist faculty they en
dorse sneer at military studies as
being beneath their dignity. Who
cares, after all? What I do not agree
with is denying those students who
do want to study military science
here the opportunity to do so.

Hooray for john Bard, )r.'s recent
letter to The Daily ("Yes on ROTC,"
Nov. 8) concerning ROTC on
campus. In addition to Mr. Bard's
arguments, I would like to add the
following thoughts on the subject.
The issue of "faculty selection"
would surely arise should the Fac
ulty Senate begin to discuss the
return of ROTC to campus. A pri
mary reason for the University's
decision to drop ROTC more than a
decade ago was that the method of
appointing the military officers who
taught ROTC was an unacceptable
departure from the procedure used
in appointing all other members of
the faculty.

Should ROTC return to campus,
the faculty itself would have control
over the proposed appointments of
ROTC instructors. ROTC instructors
must meet University standards
before they are assigned to a teach
ing position. In accordance with
this policy, the faculty should retain
its right to reject candidates of their
choice and become more selective
in their search. For example, at MIT
only engineering graduates are
considered for ROTC instructor
appointments. In Stanford's case,
the faculty could select a Stanford
graduate who has demonstrated an
exceptional academic record as well
as fine teaching ability.
Finally, sad to say, every
denouncement of ROTC instruction
on campus complains that ROTC
courses taught by military officers
lack the intellectual content and
academic standards that generally
prevail at Stanford. What this "knee
jerk" response ignores is that the
course goals set by ROTC can in
fact be expanded upon to provide
the higher academic standards that
the Stanford Faculty Senate is
looking for. The Department of
Defense only provides basic
guidelines for the courses; what is
wrong with the faculty developing
additional coursework to meet
needs? I might add that one does
not find the study of "killing people
more efficiently" among these
course goals. Rather, Air Force
ROTC courses focus on the history
of air power, leadership and man
agement (a course covering many
of the same topics I.E. 100 does),
and a review of national security
policy in contemporary American
society.

attempts to censor a guest profes
sor's lectures and an inquisition
into the Hoover Institution started
because of the political beliefs of
some of its scholars. Now you are
saying that military studies don't
belong in an academic environ
ment! Where do they belong then?
Military science should be differ
entiated from military training and
perhaps you suffer from a lack of
understanding in what military
science entails. It is not the
"science of killing people more
efficiently" as your editorial claims.
Granted that tactics are a part of the
curriculum (for Army ROTC at
least), but so are leadership, ethics,
discipline and a plethora of other
skills useful in everyday life. A
well-rounded ROTC program offers
more to a student that "how to kill
people."
It seems that Stanford is quick to
point to its academic credentials in
recruiting new students, yet unwill
ing to accept the responsibility of
providing them an academically
free environment. I sincerely hope
that this trend will not continue
since everyone will lose in the end.

Just as the persecutors of Mac
hiavelli did not change the per
tinence of his ideas, The Daily and
the anti-ROTC faculty will not
change today's real world by
pretending that the politics of
armed force is not a legitimate topic
of study. The appeal the subject of
military studies holds for some
should not be a factor in allowing it
to be studied on campus. Could we
allow pro-lifers to prevent abortion
from being taught at the Med
School, or let Catholics stand in the
way of birth control courses, simply
because these subjects "trouble
them deeply?" Certainly not at this

bastion ot academic freedom.
I am in favor of letting The Daily
and the extremist faculty they en
dorse sneer at military studies as
being beneath their dignity. Who
cares, after all? What I do not agree
with is denying those students who
do want to study military science
here the opportunity to do so.

Hooray for john Bard, )r.'s recent
letter to The Daily ("Yes on ROTC,"
Nov. 8) concerning ROTC on
campus. In addition to Mr. Bard's
arguments, I would like to add the
following thoughts on the subject.
The issue of "faculty selection"
would surely arise should the Fac
ulty Senate begin to discuss the
return of ROTC to campus. A pri
mary reason for the University's
decision to drop ROTC more than a
decade ago was that the method of
appointing the military officers who
taught ROTC was an unacceptable
departure from the procedure used
in appointing all other members of
the faculty.

Should ROTC return to campus,
the faculty itself would have control
over the proposed appointments of
ROTC instructors. ROTC instructors
must meet University standards
before they are assigned to a teach
ing position. In accordance with
this policy, the faculty should retain
its right to reject candidates of their
choice and become more selective
in their search. For example, at MIT
only engineering graduates are
considered for ROTC instructor
appointments. In Stanford's case,
the faculty could select a Stanford
graduate who has demonstrated an
exceptional academic record as well
as fine teaching ability.
Finally, sad to say, every
denouncement of ROTC instruction
on campus complains that ROTC
courses taught by military officers
lack the intellectual content and
academic standards that generally
prevail at Stanford. What this "knee
jerk" response ignores is that the
course goals set by ROTC can in
fact be expanded upon to provide
the higher academic standards that
the Stanford Faculty Senate is
looking for. The Department of
Defense only provides basic
guidelines for the courses; what is
wrong with the faculty developing
additional coursework to meet
needs? I might add that one does
not find the study of "killing people
more efficiently" among these
course goals. Rather, Air Force
ROTC courses focus on the history
of air power, leadership and man
agement (a course covering many
of the same topics I.E. 100 does),
and a review of national security
policy in contemporary American
society.
Implicit in much of my argument
is an attitude of cooperation be
tween the Department of Defense
and the Stanford faculty to work
out the inherent problems of an
ROTC program at Stanford, particu
larly that of instructor appoint-

ments. At first glance, generating
this cooperation appears to be a
colossal task, but I believe it can be
done.

After reading the editorial, "No
uniforms, please," we became
deeply disturbed by The Daily's
serious misconception of what
ROTC courses are and the situation
Stanford's ROTC students are in.
Students who wish to enroll in
ROTC courses must do so at other
colleges, paying that school's tui
tion in addition to Stanford's and
often at the sake of missing Stan
ford classes. Midday commuting
during Stanford "prime class time"
is a serious problem which could
be solved by allowing ROTC in
struction on campus. As Stanford
students, these people should not
be denied opportunities at Stanford
simply because they desire enroll
ment in ROTC. Often conflicts arise
(especially for upperclassmen who
must fulfill graduation require
ments) in which attendance at
ROTC is impossible, but must still
be made up.
The ROTC students who are
pushing for its return, including
ourselves, are not receiving aca
demic class credit for their efforts.
The arrangement these students
have with the ROTC detachment at
San Jose State University is that
some time donated to this cause
can be used to partially makeup
missed non-academic leadership
training time.
It is also unfortunate that so
many people misinterpret the
meaning of military science
courses. The AFROTC program
consists of two parts, essentially
independent of each other. The
Professional Officer Course, a
two-year sequence taken by up
perclassmen, is the academic
"military science" portion of the
program. Students take a year-long
course each in "Organizational
Leadership and Management" and
"American Defense Policy." In no
way is the "science of killing
people more efficiently" a part of
the ROTC curriculum.
We couldn't agree more that it
would be preposterous to grant
credit for learning how to kill. The
fact of the matter is that these
courses are not inferior in academic
content to other courses here. In
the name of academic freedom,
how can anyone be so judgmental?
The other half of the ROTC pro
gram, dubbed "leadership lab" is
essentially an ongoing exercise in
running a military organization and
does not receive academic credit.
One would think that the Univer
sity would prefer having its
graduates, who have probably been
exposed to a far broader range of
ideas that service academy
graduates, to hold key positions in
the American military. As long as it
seems inevitable that the United
States will have a national defense,
one should pose the question:
What kind of people do you want in
the military? Would you rather not
have highly qualified Stanford
graduates making military deci
sions?

The Daily states its belief that the
faculty acted "wisely and rational
ly" when it forced the ROTC pro
gram off campus in 1970. What year
was that again? Doubtless readers
can evaluate for themselves what
factors other than wisdom and cool
thinking might have entered into
the faculty's decision; among other
things, the annoyance of having
"campus radicals . . . trashing the
campus," as The Daily quaintly put
it, might be taken into account.
Given the tenor of those times, I
would doubt that rationality was the
governing consideration.
