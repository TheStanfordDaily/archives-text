# Hagler, Duran fight tonight
## 
### 
Las Vegas (AP) — Roberto
Duran will challenge un
disputed middleweight cham
pion Marvelous Marvin Hagler
tonight, almost three years
since he quit in disgrace
against Sugar Ray Leonard.
It is a movie script tight.
Duran, 32, "born again"
when he beat young Davey
Moore for a share of the junior
middleweight title, will be
trying to become the first
fighter to win titles in four
classes.
"I think I've tra ; ned harder
for this fight than any fight of
my life," said Duran,
"because I'm going for a
fourth title and because most
people say Marvin Hagler is in
vincible."
Hagler, 29, who has fought
in the shadow of others
despite his success, feels that
at last he has found the kind of
showcase his talent deserves.
"This is what a champion
ship fight is all about. This is
what a fighter wants ... to get
the proper exposure, get the
proper attention," said the
bald, mustachioed Hagler,
who more than a year ago
legally changed his name to
Marvelous Marvin.
"This is the fight I've been
waiting for."

Hagler is about a 3-1 favorite
to win the scheduled 15-round
bout at a 15,200-seat outdoor
arena at Caesars Palace. It will
be seen on closed-circuit tele
vision throughout the United
States and Canada.
The fight will start between
7:30 p.m. and 8 p.m.
when Duran became the
seventh man to win three titles
by stopping Moore in the
eighth round for the World
Boxing Association 154-pound
class title june 16 in New York,
he returned to Panama in the
executive jet of President
Ricardo de la Espriella.
But after fighting Leonard
on Nov. 25, 1980, Duran was
mocked in his native land. On
that night he quit in the eighth
round, claiming stomach
cramps, and lost the World
Boxing Council welterweight
title.
The general feeling was that
the fearsome lightweight
champion of the 19705, known
as "Hands of Stone," was
finished as a fighter.
His "rebirth" has been a big
human interest story.
"Everybody says and writes,
'Duran, Duran, Duran,' " said
Hagler. "So, when I dump
Duran there'll be no excuses."
