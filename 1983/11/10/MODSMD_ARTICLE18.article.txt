## USF crushes Card playoff hopes 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
The University of San Fran
cisco Dons ended the playoff
hopes of the Stanford men's
soccer team by giving the Car
dinal a 2-1 soaking on the wet
Negoesco Stadium turf last
night.
This sets Stanford's season
mark at 12-4-i. Although quite
respectable, it will not be
good enough to win the
league nor will it qualify the
Cardinal for a wildcard berth
in the NCAA playoffs.
On the other hand, the
Dons will be very much in the
running for a berth with their
17-4 record. They are also
heavilv tavored to beat UC-
Berkeley whose "record
makes them look better than
they are," according to USF's
Sports Information Director
Peter Simon.
In last night's game, Stan
ford did not come as close to
beating the Dons as the 2-1
score indicates.
"We definitely dominated
tonight," USF Coach Staeve

Negoesco said. "Ihe hall was
on (Stanford's) side of the
field for the majority of the
game."
The Dons made their pres
ence on the field known
quickly enough by darting off
to a 1-0 lead. Defender Mark
Mackbee slammed in a header
at only 2:02 into the game.
Stanford countered with a
blast from the right side of the
field which came off the pov\
erful foot of Chris Morrow at
2:11.
Despite Stanford's sudden
surge after the score, USF
dominance soon revealed it
self. "USF could have easilv
scored at least two or three
more goals," Simon said, "it it
were not for Stanford's defen
sive skill."
USF outshot Stanford 6-2,
but did not outscore the Car
dinal until 29:07 when Mack
bee took a pass from Cato An
derson in front of the goal to
finish the game at 2-1 and
tinish Stanford's hopes for the
playoffs.


Walter kingson is shown here in a game against UNLV earlier
this season. Last night the Cardinal playoff hopes were all hut
eliminated as Stanford lost to USF 2-1.
