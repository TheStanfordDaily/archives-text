Relying on a disciplined
defense and a solid ball con
trol offense, the Stanford wo
men's volleyball team
defeated the San Diego State
Aztecs 3-1 last night.
The victory upped the
Card's conference record to 9-
2. The team now stands at 16-4
overall. The Aztecs dropped to
30-10 (6-5) on the season.
"Overall, it was a real good
win for us," commented Stan
ford assistant coach Don Shaw
after the home match. "We're
getting off to a good start after
the (schedule) break."
Solid but unspectacular
defense played the key role in
the Card effort. While Stan
ford could not consistently

block Aztec kills at the net, it
used a superb positioning
scheme to frustrate SDS with
defensive saves time after
time.
From the opening whistle, it
appeared that Stanford would
have a battle on its hands.
With the Card ahead 8-7 and
the lead seesawing back and
forth, a Kim Oden/Barbara
Fontana block stifled a SDS
rally and put the Card in front
to stay en route to a 15-11 deci

sion. In the second game a
Julie Baker kill at 8-8 triggered
a 7-1 outburst that sealed the
win 15-9. After suffering a let
down in the third game and
losing it 15-1, the Cardinal
broke away to a 10-3 advan
tage in the final game to clinch
the victory 15-7.
"The defense played well
and we dug a lot of balls,"
Shaw said. "We passed real
well on offense, too." Julie
Baker and Barbara Fontana led

the offensive surge for Stan
ford, finishing with 11 and
nine kills respectively. Kim
Oden contributed eight kills
and eight blocks. Baker also
played well defensively, ad
ding 12 digs. Deidre Dvorak's
15 digs led the squad.
The team travels to Stockton
Saturday to particpate in the
Wendy's Classic. They will
face No. 2-ranked Hawaii in
the first round.
