### TRASK LEONARD 
Following two promising performances, the men golfers
expected good things at the Southwestern Intercollegiate
in Los Angeles on Tuesday. They failed to perform up to
their expectations, however, and suffered a disappointing
eighth-place finish.
Arizona State, after two strong showings at the Stanford
and University of the Pacific tournaments, captured the
team crown with a total of 1089 strokes. Behind the Sun
Devils were Brigham Young at 1095, UCLA at 1100, USC at
1104, Weber State at 1111, Fresno State at 1113, UOP at
1115 and Stanford at 1126.
Ken Earle of UOP took the individual championship at
208, with Duffy Waldorf of UCLA and Robert Meyer of BYU
in a tie for second with scores of 212.
Scott Erickson was low for Stanford with a total of 221,
including a round of 70. Carl Wagner and Doug Thompson
were next at 225.
Coach Tim Schaaf's golfers suffered through a poor first
round performance of 382 and mediocre play in their lack
luster play.
"We usually improve after our weak starts and sporadic
putting," said Schaaf, "but this time we didn't. These two
weaknesses and our players' mental preparation will most
definitely have to be worked on."
The field at the USC-hosted tournament consisted of
the best teams on the West Coast, and with the eighth
place finish, Stanford has moved down in position among
these teams.
