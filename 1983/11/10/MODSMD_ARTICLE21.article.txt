## 'Right Moves' just aren't, really 
### ANDRIA BUITER 
The setting of All the
Moves is untypical for any
movie made in Hollywood.
Stef (Tom Cruise) is a high
school senior and football
player struggling to get out of
a town domineered by its steel
mill, to get out of the kind of
life his father and brother are
leading and to land an athletic
scholarship.
There are no rich suburbs,
big cars and uppercl.iss 1 1,<r ti<
around these ordinary
people". Is this Hollywood on
a social c onsc ience 112 lard
ly. The movie is aimed at the
high school crowd, which is
quite apparent in the starring
choice of Tom Cruise, who
became popular in the sum
mer success of Risky Business.
There are all the necessary in
gredients of sex, music and
some violence to appeal to a
young audience The addi
tional incidents of men losing
their job, high s( hool preg
nancy and early marriages get
touched on only in passing
and often seem accidental in
the script.
Tom Cruise is quite uood as

Stci Djordjevic. He might not
he a (ierard Depardieu or
Dustin Hoffman yet, but he
has a lot of potential as a
young character actor. Espe
< ially in his body language he
has learned a lot since Risky
Business.
As Stef, he plays football as
a means to leave this town
where the steel mill seems to
he the only source of income,
and an athletic scholarship is
his only hope. So he fights on
the football field for recogni
tion by the recruiters from the
best schools. Then, after his
dream seems shattered, he
tights the coach, who
becomes a very unpleasant
(harac ter in his own struggle
to leave the town. (Craig Nel
son , the father in Poltergeist is
very believable in the role of
this nasty guy.)
for romantic interest there
is Lea Thompson as Lisa, who
looks appropriately cute in
and out of her cheerleader
outfit. She seems to have all
the adult lines, and here the
script fails terribly. She is
supposed to be 17-years-old,
yet she lectures Stef and the

audience rather heavy
handedly about the meaning
of life, the universe and every
thing. She wants to study
music, but "there are no
music scholarships" and one
feels quite sad for her.
Somehow though, with all
those mature lines coming
from her, one stops feeling tor
her soon. She seems more of a
conscience for Stef than a per
sonality. The movie is lacking
any believable female charac
ters. It is an all mens' world
with Lisa and the coach's wife
reduced to decorative cheer
leaders on and off the football
field. In the end the plot
forces Lisa to help Stef go to
college, even though that is
predicted as the end of the re
lationship. But as all good
movie females she sacrifices
herself for the good of the
hero.
This is Michael Chapman's
first movie as a director. His
background is cinematog
raphy, which is apparent
throughout the movie. This is
where the strength of the
movie lies. The steel mill is
present everywhere in the

background, mostly in the
colors. There is dirty hrown,
dirty gray and dirty black
everywhere, even the color of
the school is a dirty gold. The
atmosphere of the steel mill is
so visually present that it
becomes a protagonist of the
movie, with its smoke lying in
the early morning light of the
opening sequence to the soot
that seems to cover even the
inside of rooms.
Chapman didn't handle the
narrative line equally well. The
plot builds up to an early
climax in the Big Game and
from there it has nowhere to
go. The tension before the
game is beautifully portrayed.
The nervousness of the coach
and the players, whose in
credibly young faces in the
close-ups look as if those kids
are going into a war; and then
the excitement of the game,
with cheerleaders and pom
pons bouncing in and out of
frame and painful sound ef
fects when the players' heads
and helmets are crashing to
gether.This is the best scene
of the movie, but it comes too

early. There is no progression
in the storyline after this and
nothing after the Big Game
reaches the same height of
tension. So the ending of the
story occurs as just one more
incident . It comes nearly as a

surprise that the ending is
happy at a point where Stet
seems to have given up, and
when it really doesn't seem to
matter any more.
Is it worth seeing? Yes, if
you have seen all the other

good movies that are out now
already. All the Right Moves is
entertaining for two hours,
and that is exactly the extent
of its importance. Easy enter
tainment — if you like that,
then go for it!

for romantic interest there
is Lea Thompson as Lisa, who

the adult lines, and here the
script fails terribly. She is
supposed to be 17-years-old,
yet she lectures Stef and the

audience rather heavy
handedly about the meaning
of life, the universe and every
thing. She wants to study
music, but "there are no
music scholarships" and one
feels quite sad for her.
Somehow though, with all
those mature lines coming
from her, one stops feeling tor
her soon. She seems more of a
conscience for Stef than a per
sonality. The movie is lacking
any believable female charac

with Lisa and the coach's wife
reduced to decorative cheer
leaders on and off the football
field. In the end the plot
forces Lisa to help Stef go to
college, even though that is
predicted as the end of the re
lationship. But as all good
movie females she sacrifices
herself for the good of the
hero.
This is Michael Chapman's
first movie as a director. His
background is cinematog
raphy, which is apparent
throughout the movie. This is
where the strength of the
movie lies. The steel mill is
present everywhere in the

background, mostly in the
colors. There is dirty hrown,
dirty gray and dirty black
everywhere, even the color of
the school is a dirty gold. The
atmosphere of the steel mill is
so visually present that it
becomes a protagonist of the
movie, with its smoke lying in
the early morning light of the
opening sequence to the soot
that seems to cover even the
inside of rooms.
Chapman didn't handle the
narrative line equally well. The
plot builds up to an early
climax in the Big Game and
from there it has nowhere to
go. The tension before the
game is beautifully portrayed.
The nervousness of the coach
and the players, whose in
credibly young faces in the
close-ups look as if those kids
are going into a war; and then
the excitement of the game,
with cheerleaders and pom
pons bouncing in and out of
frame and painful sound ef
fects when the players' heads
and helmets are crashing to
gether.This is the best scene
of the movie, but it comes too

early. There is no progression
in the storyline after this and
nothing after the Big Game
reaches the same height of
tension. So the ending of the
story occurs as just one more
incident . It comes nearly as a

surprise that the ending is
happy at a point where Stet
seems to have given up, and
when it really doesn't seem to
matter any more.
Is it worth seeing? Yes, if
you have seen all the other

good movies that are out now
already. All the Right Moves is
entertaining for two hours,
and that is exactly the extent
of its importance. Easy enter
tainment — if you like that,
then go for it!

The setting of All the
Moves is untypical for any
movie made in Hollywood.
Stef (Tom Cruise) is a high
school senior and football
player struggling to get out of
a town domineered by its steel
mill, to get out of the kind of
life his father and brother are
leading and to land an athletic
scholarship.
There are no rich suburbs,
big cars and uppercl.iss 1 1,<r ti<
around these ordinary
people". Is this Hollywood on
a social c onsc ience 112 lard
ly. The movie is aimed at the
high school crowd, which is
quite apparent in the starring
choice of Tom Cruise, who
became popular in the sum
mer success of Risky Business.
There are all the necessary in
gredients of sex, music and
some violence to appeal to a
young audience The addi
tional incidents of men losing
their job, high s( hool preg
nancy and early marriages get
touched on only in passing
and often seem accidental in
the script.
Tom Cruise is quite uood as

Stci Djordjevic. He might not
he a (ierard Depardieu or
Dustin Hoffman yet, but he
has a lot of potential as a
young character actor. Espe
< ially in his body language he
has learned a lot since Risky
Business.
As Stef, he plays football as
a means to leave this town
where the steel mill seems to
he the only source of income,
and an athletic scholarship is
his only hope. So he fights on
the football field for recogni
tion by the recruiters from the
best schools. Then, after his
dream seems shattered, he
tights the coach, who
becomes a very unpleasant
(harac ter in his own struggle
to leave the town. (Craig Nel
