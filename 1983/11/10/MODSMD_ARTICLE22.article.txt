# 'Osterman Weekend' not happy experience
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
I love Sam Pec kin pah so much that I'm
even willing to settle, on some level, for I he
Osterman Weekend, which is certainly well
directed. Every Peckinpah movie, no matter
how bad, has its terrific elements — the
emergence of the tank in Cross of Iron, the
parade of trucks in Convoy, the white-robed
martial arts fighters on the dock in The Killer
Elite — and The Osterman Weekend has a
breathtaking car chase and, in some of the
later scenes, glimpses of the abstract beauty
with which Peckinpah familiarly imbues vio
lence. But it's a pretty lame vehicle.
In Alan Sharp's script, derived from a
Robert I udlum bestseller, the head of the
CIA (Burt Lancaster) and one ot his most ex
perienced agents (John I lurt) persuade a IV
newsman (Rutger Hauer) the host of a "bO
Minutes"-style show called "Face to face —
that his three closest friends (Craig I. Nel
son, Dennis Hopper, Chris Sarandon) are
Soviet spies.
Hauer is assigned the job of alienating
their loyalties during the weekend the four
buddies and their three wives (Meg Foster,
Helen Shaver, Cassie Yates) plan to spend

together at his home. Sharp and Peckinpah
make these characters, except for Foster
(she plays Hauer's wife; their electric blue
eyes match) and Nelson, so extremely unat
tractive, and their relationships so
precarious, that what should have been the
central dramatic conflict — friendship
versus ethics — never surfaces. The actors,
except for Hurt and Nelson, look bewil
dered a lot of the time, which is hardly
surprising, given that at least one-third of
the plot makes little or no sense.
There is a theme, I think, lying half
submerged in late speeches about the wil
lingness of Americans to be seduced by go
vernment agencies and the media, but Peck
inpah doesn't seem committed to it, or to
anything else, either, except craftsmanship.
I know that's not nothing, and I know too
that Peckinpah is so maligned in Hollywood
that his being able to work at all is an ac
complishment. But The Osterman Weekend
isn't a very happy experience, and consider
ing how little personal stake Peckinpah (or
anyone) appears to have had in it as a movie,
one can't help thinking that it had no reason
to be made at all.
