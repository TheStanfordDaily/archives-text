# Fine acting, wrong story for 'Zone'
## 
### JIM TASSOPULOS 
David Cronenberg's adapta
tion of Stephen king's novel,
The Dead Zone, has a fascinat
ing premise and an interest
ing, sympathetic character at
its center. It is far from a mind
less horror story. However,
the story which develops
around the promising center
is uninvolving in the film's first
half and unbelievable in the
second half. The ideas stay in
our mind and the character
stays in our heart, but the film
fails to win either heart or
mind.
Christopher Walken plays
Johnny Smith, a school
teacher who suffers a near fa
tal injury in a car wreck. He
awakes after five years spent
in a coma to find his "girl"
married to someone else and
his job gone. More important
ly to the story, Johnny dis
covers that he has the ability
to see various events
— present, past and future —
in the lives of people with
whom he makes physical con

tact.
The first part of the film,
which works well, centers on
Johnny's attempt to come to
terms with the changes in his
life. Walken is very effective in
the role. His pale, forlorn face
transmits the pain and confu
sion which Johnny feels as he
thinks of his lost plans for the
future and his strange new
power. Walken conveys

. . . he 'sees' the killer and imagines that he
was actually there and did nothing to stop
the killing.

Johnny's state so well and so
intensely that the dialogues
which he has with his father
and Sarah seem simplistic.
There are a couple of good
scenes when Johnny first
realizes his power, seeing the
daughter of a hospital nurse
burning in her house and later
displaying his power in front
of the press. However, when
Johnny's conscience leads
him to agree to aid in the hunt
for a mass murderer the movie
lapses into a predictable se
quence culminated by some
unnecessary, unmoving vio
lence once the identity of the
murderer is discovered. We
continue to care about
Johnny, especially when he
"sees" the killer and imagines
that he was actually there and
did nothing to stop the killing.
However, we have little inter
est in what the story has him
doing.
Next, we see Johnny iso
lated in his new home. His
mood is captured effectively,

as it is throughout the picture,
by the somber colors in which
the film is shot and and the
quiet, expressive score. There
is a moving scene in which
Johnny '•hows his doctor the
hundreds of letters he has
received from people who
want some kind of
help — support, knowledge,
reassurance — things which
he cannot give.

Soon, the story gets in the
way again as a millionaire asks
Johnny to tutor his shy, under
achieving son. A nice relation
ship between Johnny and the
boy develops. This relation
ship is the most believable
part of the story.
At the same time, however,
the millionaire leads Johnny
into the final segment of the
story, dealing with a senatorial
candidate. By this time, the ar
bitrary, unrelated story lines
and numerous coincidences,
like Sarah appearing at
Johnny's door one day passing
out leaflets for the same can
didate whom Johnny meets at
the millionaire's house, have
destroyed most of the film's
dramatic credibility. The poli
tical intrigue which follows is
so farfetched that any viewer
wanting to see lohnny strug
gling with his powers in an in
teresting, real situation of
ocnflict loses all hope.
Unfortunately, the ludi
crous final segment also
gives Walken a chance to use

his powers to genuinely help
mankind, raising the fascinat
ing question of the
film — whether Johnny
should use his power to
change the world's future.
The climax is exciting and
even moving, but the minute
one thinks about it, the con
trived, exaggerated situation
overwhelms the momentary
involvement.
It's a shame because if
Johnny had grown through a
series of compelling realistic
events, The Dead Zone could
have been a very exciting and
thought provoking experi
ence.
The performances are all
solid. As I have said, Walken
carries the movie; he is inter
esting to look at in every
scene. Brooke Adams is
suitably attractive as his
former girlfriend, but her
character is underdeveloped.
Herbert Lom makes Johnny's
doctor a real, believable
friend. Martin Sheen has a lot
of fun with his role as a
politician who exudes charm
and exuberance in public but
who reveals a messianic love
of power in private. However,
the role is an extreme
caricature, and it is one reason
why the ending loses much of
the power it should have.
The Dead Zone may be
worth seeing because of
Walken's presence. Watching
the understanding, but help
less expressions on his face,
listening to his pensive, emo
tional, caring voice, one gets a
clear impression of what the
film wanted to be about. It just
did not tell Ihe right story.

sion which Johnny feels as he
thinks of his lost plans for the
future and his strange new
power. Walken conveys

. . . he 'sees' the killer and imagines that he
was actually there and did nothing to stop
the killing.

Johnny's state so well and so
intensely that the dialogues
which he has with his father
and Sarah seem simplistic.
There are a couple of good
scenes when Johnny first
realizes his power, seeing the
daughter of a hospital nurse
burning in her house and later
displaying his power in front
of the press. However, when
Johnny's conscience leads
him to agree to aid in the hunt
for a mass murderer the movie
lapses into a predictable se
quence culminated by some
unnecessary, unmoving vio
lence once the identity of the
murderer is discovered. We
continue to care about
Johnny, especially when he
"sees" the killer and imagines
that he was actually there and
did nothing to stop the killing.
However, we have little inter
est in what the story has him
doing.
Next, we see Johnny iso
lated in his new home. His
mood is captured effectively,

as it is throughout the picture,
by the somber colors in which
the film is shot and and the
quiet, expressive score. There
is a moving scene in which
Johnny '•hows his doctor the
hundreds of letters he has
received from people who
want some kind of
help — support, knowledge,
reassurance — things which
he cannot give.

Soon, the story gets in the
way again as a millionaire asks
Johnny to tutor his shy, under
achieving son. A nice relation
ship between Johnny and the
boy develops. This relation
ship is the most believable
part of the story.
At the same time, however,
the millionaire leads Johnny
into the final segment of the
story, dealing with a senatorial
candidate. By this time, the ar
bitrary, unrelated story lines
and numerous coincidences,
like Sarah appearing at
Johnny's door one day passing
out leaflets for the same can
didate whom Johnny meets at
the millionaire's house, have
destroyed most of the film's
dramatic credibility. The poli
tical intrigue which follows is
so farfetched that any viewer
wanting to see lohnny strug
gling with his powers in an in
teresting, real situation of
ocnflict loses all hope.
Unfortunately, the ludi
crous final segment also
gives Walken a chance to use

his powers to genuinely help
mankind, raising the fascinat
ing question of the
film — whether Johnny
should use his power to
change the world's future.
The climax is exciting and
even moving, but the minute
one thinks about it, the con
trived, exaggerated situation
overwhelms the momentary
involvement.
It's a shame because if
Johnny had grown through a
series of compelling realistic
events, The Dead Zone could
have been a very exciting and
thought provoking experi
ence.
The performances are all
solid. As I have said, Walken
carries the movie; he is inter
esting to look at in every
scene. Brooke Adams is
suitably attractive as his
former girlfriend, but her
character is underdeveloped.
Herbert Lom makes Johnny's
doctor a real, believable
friend. Martin Sheen has a lot
of fun with his role as a
politician who exudes charm
and exuberance in public but
who reveals a messianic love
of power in private. However,
the role is an extreme
caricature, and it is one reason
why the ending loses much of
the power it should have.
The Dead Zone may be
worth seeing because of
Walken's presence. Watching
the understanding, but help
less expressions on his face,
listening to his pensive, emo
tional, caring voice, one gets a
clear impression of what the
film wanted to be about. It just
did not tell Ihe right story.
David Cronenberg's adapta
tion of Stephen king's novel,
The Dead Zone, has a fascinat
ing premise and an interest
ing, sympathetic character at
its center. It is far from a mind
less horror story. However,
the story which develops
around the promising center
is uninvolving in the film's first
half and unbelievable in the
second half. The ideas stay in
our mind and the character
stays in our heart, but the film
fails to win either heart or
mind.
Christopher Walken plays
Johnny Smith, a school
teacher who suffers a near fa
tal injury in a car wreck. He
awakes after five years spent
in a coma to find his "girl"
married to someone else and
his job gone. More important
ly to the story, Johnny dis
covers that he has the ability
to see various events
— present, past and future —
in the lives of people with
whom he makes physical con

tact.
The first part of the film,
which works well, centers on
Johnny's attempt to come to
terms with the changes in his
life. Walken is very effective in
the role. His pale, forlorn face
transmits the pain and confu
sion which Johnny feels as he
thinks of his lost plans for the
future and his strange new
power. Walken conveys
