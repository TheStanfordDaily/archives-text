# Betrayal when price is right
## 'The Visit' reflects human treachery 
### CECILIA WALKER 
I dare anyone not to be lurched from
his dark theater seat into Pittsville,
Mass., setting of the Drama Depart
ment's marvelous production of Dur
renmatt's The Visit, which runs
through Nov. 12 in the Little Theater.
A great wash of unspeakable guilt,
perhaps the color of Stephen
Dedalus' recurring snotgreen sea,
bathes one's soul with the knowledge
of its oneness within human treachery
and blood-stained greed. Yet, we
realize just how terrifyingly human evil
is when we see an entire community
bribed into committing one of the
greatest crimes against all humanity.
Durrenmatt's social message is ines
capable; we are all Matthew Arnold
Philistines in the worst sense. Anyone
of us would betray our very loved ones
if the price were right.
If anyone were ever in an enviable
position, it's director Steve Weeks,
whose adaptation of The Visit presents
Brechtian social and political elements
with brilliant effectiveness and with
great comic irony.
The Visit is a parable about a cruel
trick which is avenged some 50 years
later. Claire Zachanassian (played by

Dianne Manning), as a young girl is
ruined by her lover, then young
Joseph Hill (Graham Winton), and
forced into the life of a prostitute.
While in a brothel she is discovered by
the very rich Mr. Zachanassian, and
through a succession ot marriages,
becomes increasingly wealthy. When
she returns to Pittsville, she is thirsty
for blood and "justice."

We realize just how terrifyingly human evil is when
we see an entire community bribed into committing
one of the greatest crimes against all humanity.

As Joseph Hill, a paunchy and be
whiskered shopkeeper who finds his
great popularity on the decline, Win
ton's performance is exceptional; he
gives his character great dimen
sionality. From his desperate realiza
tion, his paralysis and to his accep
tance of his doom, one senses the ma
chinery into which he is caught and
pulled.
That machine is a chilling Claire,
who after living a hellish life is scarcely

human, but literally made ot artificial
limbs and organs. Manning gives a fine
performance of a being who no longer
feels pain but now only burns with
deathly bitterness.
One of the two tinest moments in
the play occurs when the teacher,
portrayed by Steve Vineberg, after at
tempting to speak up to save Hill from
being murdered, says,"I shall take

part in it. I can teel myself slowly be
coming a murderer. My faith in
humanity is powerless to stop it."
The other moment is when the
mayor, played by Martin Robinson,
comes to Hill offering him the chance
to allow the community to avoid the
unpleasantness of (the now evident)
carrying out their awful judgment. The
mayor appeals to Hill's sense of civic
duty, "But isn't it your duty, as a man
of honor, to draw your own conclu
sions and make an end of your life? If

only out of public spirit, and your love
for your native town."
Weeks succeeds in drawing fine per
formances from his large, talented
cast. Due to the inherently self
conscious nature of The Visit,
however, the slow-paced performance
caused more animated viewers to
squirm. Weeks would have done well
to have cut about a half hour from the
play.
Yet movement throughout was
fluid; I was particularly impressed by
the many smooth scene changes. In
fact, the play would be worth seeing
simply for the range of sets from mar
velous decrepit township to the high
tech.
Much ot the magic of the production
is due to the imagery and stylistic
myth-making. Weeks adapted much of
the language to the present day, yet
still remained faithful to Durrenmatt's
intentions. I may have been put more
at ease had Weeks decided to make
the characters more grotesque and
monstrous (everyone was too attrac
tive), and perhaps made the setting
surrealistic â€” at any rate, less real or
human. Perhaps my conscience was
just simply shaken.
