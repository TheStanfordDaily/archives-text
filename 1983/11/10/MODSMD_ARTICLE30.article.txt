# 'Beauty Science' shows Farabough's strengths, weaknesses
## 
### MIKE HALE 
Marin-based performance
artist Laura Farabough is
caught somewhere in be
tween theater and pure spec
tacle — not avant-garde
enough to be dangerous,
she's different enough to be,
well, different. From this quin
tessential Bay Area posture,
Farabough and her company,
Nighttire Theater, turn out
"location pieces": perfor
mance works combining a for
mal script and elaborate light
ing and set design with ele
ments of dance and, often,
video, which are staged on lo
cation — a bar, a locker room,
a swimming pool.
Niehtfire's current produc

tion is called Beauty Science,
and it is being done through
Nov. 27 at Dorlane's Hair
Design in Sausalito. Beauty Sci
ence, which is a fairly slight
work, exhibits Farabough's
strengths and weaknesses in
their pure forms. As always,
you can feel the impulse
toward pure design just under
the surface — the desire to
present on stage a piece of
work based on movement,
sound, lighting and graphics,
and story be damned. And as
always, Farabough's best mo
ments in Beauty Science are
the ones that come directly
out of this impulse.
But . . . for some reason,
whether out of timidity or a

thirst tor profundity or primal
proscenium-guilt, Farabough
has to have a story, too. Not
too coherent a story, of course
— this is the avant-garde —
but something with charac
ters, and a discernible course
of events, and some of the
past filled in to give the man
datory psychological element.
Beauty Science concerns two
women who go to a beauty
parlor, why they go to the
beauty parlor, and what they
fantasize about while they're
there. It touches on all the
right issues — being a young
professional, wanting a baby,
wanting a blond hunk in a
tuxedo, not knowing what you
want — in the most hack

neyed, superficial manner — it
seems, more than anything
else, like an excuse to put on a
show in a beauty parlor. (It
also has something to do with
Marilyn Monroe, which I
couldn't quite figure out.) The
problem is that this mishmash
of a "story" comes out in
solid, trite, indigestible
chunks — mainly video
voiceovers — that break up
the otherwise fascinating ac
tion.
If you make it to Dorlane's
in Sausalito before Nov. 27,
here's what you'll see. Four
rows of hard wooden folding
chairs (they make you glad the
production is only 90 minutes
long) have been set up at one

end of the salon, the produc
tion can only seat 30. The busi
ness has been partitioned so
that the audience sits at one
end of a long, narrow per
forming space, with sinks and
chairs along each side and two
chairs at the far end, before a
full-wall mirror (in which the
audience can stare at itself
before the show). On the left,
just in front of the audience,
are two video screens. The ac
tion moves from the chairs
toward the audience
(sometimes almost in their
laps) and back again through
out the show.
Beauty Science has three
components. Two happen in
front of us, where the cast al
ternates between drama —
slightly frenetic skits with
dialogue that tell us where we
are, and with whom — and
performance: scenes without
dialogue, choreographed to a
beautiful electronic score by
Roy Marcom and James Vest,
featuring the lighting and set
and costume extravaganzas
you expect from performance
art. These sections, which are
meant as the embodiments of
the characters' various fan
tasies, etc., are the reason for
seeing the show; they are al
ways absorbing, and occasion
ally stunning. Interspersed
with the live action, and

sometimes accompanying it,
are video segments played on
the monitors at the front of
the stage. These come in two
varieties — characters speak
ing to the audience (in what
appeared to be live, off-stage
camerawork) about them
selves or Marilyn Monroe, and
interminable shots of a young
girl playing with paper dolls of
the characters, which she
moves about a miniature set in
correspondance with the
onstage action.
It's hard to know how to
evaluate performances in this
sort of work — since
Farabough hasn't really
achieved a synthesis of the dif
ferent styles she's working in,
the performers have to con
stantly switch from one mode
to another. Some are good
dancers but can't act worth
beans, others are quite con
vincing in the dialogue scenes
but move awkwardly. What we
get, in most cases, is an im
pression of the performer's
own personality.
The night I saw Beauty Sci
ence, there were still some
rough edges, especially in the
video segments — performers
started laughing during
monologues which I imagine
are largely improvisatory, and
at one point early in the show
Farabough herself looked into

the camera and said, "It the
sound isn't working, maybe
we should just take this from
the top." These will eventually
be worked out. I wish I could
say the same for the script, but
I don't imagine it will get any
better — there's a collective
sensibility at work here, one
grounded in sophomoric
humor and television
dialogue, that just doesn't
lend itself to the literary side
of theater. In the meantime,
though, there are still the in
tense images — or sensory
collages, since music is vital to
them — Farabough and her
collaborators (including desig
ner Brian Mulhern) create.
Before Farabough's work can
advance, she is going to have
to give up her attempts to
ground it in a traditional script
— there's no reason her
dialogue-less action can't
carry all the meaning she
needs.
Despite the hard seats and
close quarters, Dorlane's Hair
Design is definitely the place
to see Beauty Science. After
Nov. 27 the show is moving to
the Intersection in San Fran
cisco, where it will be restaged
for a theater. Some of the ef
fects may be more spectacu
lar, but the intimacy — at
Dorlane's, the front row of
customers is often inches
from the action — will be lost.
