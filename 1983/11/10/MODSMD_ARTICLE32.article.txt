Heather hour
It's a flock of fun folks, it's a tintin
nabulation of titillating, taciturn,
timorous titans, it's a bachan
nalesque bevy of blasphemous
brouhahas, it's a coven of can
tankerous, caterwauling
creationists, it's a lion's den of lo
quacious, lecherous, lackadaisical
louts, it's a nymphomaniacal net
work of nubile nerds, it's a Heather
hour. Friday at 5 in room 102 in Pot
ter. Be there.
