A cable television system that could link the commu
nity's home computers to the University's computer
network is in the cards here.
Stanford may join Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Atherton
and unincorporated areas of San Mateo County in sub
scribing to a cable system if all of the communities
agree to accept a bid from one of the four companies
that want to service the area.
Mary Lou Allen, director of the Stanford Instructional
Television Network (SITN) and chair of the Stanford
Cable Television (CATV) Steering Croup, said the com
munities may reach a decision concerning the bids,
which were submitted last month, by the beginning of
next year.
The firms bidding for the cable franchise are Viacom
Cablevision, Pacific Telephone, the Cable Communica

Michel Guite in partnership with the Times Mirror
Company.
The University has as yet made no commitments con
cerning a cable system, Allen said.
The proposed cable system eventually could serve

17,000 faculty, staff and students on campus and in the
surrounding communities. The system could allow tor
home banking and shopping, hooking up home com
puters to office computers and data banks, and sub
scribing to video games.
The system would be linked to the Stanford Univer
sity Network, a University-wide broadband network
planned to carry video and data signals throughout the
main part of campus.
Allen said the cable system would be a source of
"intellectual and cultural programming" for the com
munity.
Stanford's success with the SITN has demonstrated
the University's ability to produce its own quality pro
gramming. The SITN, which is headed by Allen, is the
largest and most successful part-time graduate program
in the United States, providing quality education
toward an advanced degree by way of television in
struction.
Based on recommendations from the Washington,
D.C., law firm that is providing cable advice to Palo
Alto, the communities asked the applicants to promise
specific services, including 108 channels, another cable
