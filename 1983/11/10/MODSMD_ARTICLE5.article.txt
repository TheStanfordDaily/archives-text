# Meyer survey favors longer weekend hours
## 
### VAL CRITES Staff writer 
A user survey conducted last month at Meyer
Library found that a majority of respondents fa
vor a closing time between 10 p.m. and mid
night for both Friday and Saturday evenings.
The primary purpose of the study, whose
results were released Nov. 4, was to garner a
broad input from library users concerning their
views on weekend hours as well as in other
areas, according to Elizabeth Salzer, head libra
rian.
The questionnaires were distributed at the
loan and reference desks at Meyer, and stu
dents were encouraged to fill out and return a
copy. There were 247 questionnaires returned
tor tabulation.
The survey found that more than 80 percent
of the students favor a closing time between the
hours of 10 p.m.and midnight on both Friday
and Saturday evenings. The majority of respon
dents (72 percent) indicated they would con
tinue to use the library during these hours if no
services were offered.

The library is apparently used most heavily at
night. Of those surveyed, 61 percent responded
that they do more than half of their library work
from 7 p.m. until midnight.
Students listed a variety of reasons for using
the library as a study spot. The lack of noise led
the list, followed by the facility's comfort,
availability of library resources and privacy.
The survey also indicated that the library is
popular: 46 percent of the respondents spend
more than 70 percent of their study time in a li
brary.
The questionnaire gathered input on the pos
sible use of a smaller library as study space on
Friday and Saturday evenings. Approximately 40
percent indicated that they would not use an
other smaller library, 24 percent said they would
use another facility and 37 percent replied that
they might use another library as a study spot.
These results concerning study space were an
important part of the survey, according to Sal
zer.
"We recognize the real need for study space
on weekends, but we don't feel that Meyer Li

brary is the best alternative for weekend study
space. This building is an expensive one to keep
open because it is a real energy hog.
"Our survey tried to put a handle on whether
or not the library was being used primarily as
study space, or whether students were utilizing
the resources here. We found that a small num
ber of students were utilizing the resources of
the facility, so we decided that the addition of
reference hours was not needed. The same
hours and services we currently maintain will
continue at the loan desk into the foreseeable
future."
The respondents were also asked how many
students should be using the library to make it
worth the University's keeping it open on Friday
and Saturday nights. A total of 43 percent an
swered that the library should stay open for 100
or fewer people.
Salzer said the building holds approximately
1500 students when completely full, although it
seems crowded when it reaches half that num
ber.
