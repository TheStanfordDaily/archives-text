# New parking lot soon to open near Mem Aud
## 
### SUSAN BLAINE 
A new parking lot between
Memorial Auditorium and the Old
Pavilion will be ready for daytime
use by next week, according to Proj
ect Manager john Lerry.
The new lot will feature 161 eight
foot wide spaces, 44 of which will be
converted to 10-hour meter parking
within 60 to 90 days, depending on
equipment arrival time. The remain
ing 117 spaces have been designated
as "A" parking.
The new parking area will be clas
sified as an "interim" parking lot,
according to Lerry, because the land
itself is considered a future building
site.

"The schematic plan for it was
made in the '60s, but it was put
aside," Lerry said. "I guess they
kept thinking they'd put a building
on the site."
The Committee on Parking and
Transportation recommended last
spring that construction begin and
ground was broken on the project
last month after funding was ap
proved.
After originally earmarking the
entire lot for "A" parking only, the
Committee on Parking and Trans
portation voted Monday to set aside
50 spaces for metered parking at the
request of the Planning Office. That

decision, according to Judy Chan,
associate director of the Planning
Office, is part of a series of pro
posed changes which might ul
timately open up more "C" spaces
across the street from Maples
Pavilion by December.
Other parking changes approved
by the committee, which is chaired
by Physics Prof. Mason Yearian, in
clude converting parking near the
Old Pavilion to two-hour metered
parking, converting the pay lot near
the Serra Street tennis courts to "A"
parking, and converting the Plum
Street "A" lot on the museum side
of Palm Drive to "C" parking.
Except for the last change, which
is scheduled to take effect immedi
ately, all action on parking changes
has been shelved until next month,
according to Chan, who stressed
that parking problems will be moni

tored until the rainy season begins
and that all necessary changes will
be put into effect at the same time.
Most interim parking lots on
campus are made only of asphalt
and have no curbs, landscaping or
lighting, but these improvements

were considered because the new
parking area is close to Memorial
Auditorium. Lighting is scheduled to
be completed by the end of this
month, according to Lerry, who said
"we are considering screen planting
in addition to the existing trees."
