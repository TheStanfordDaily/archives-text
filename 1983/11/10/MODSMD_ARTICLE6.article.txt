# New parking lot soon to open near Mem Aud

### SUSAN BLAINE 
A new parking lot between
Memorial Auditorium and the Old
Pavilion will be ready for daytime
use by next week, according to Proj
ect Manager john Lerry.
The new lot will feature 161 eight
foot wide spaces, 44 of which will be
converted to 10-hour meter parking
within 60 to 90 days, depending on
equipment arrival time. The remain
ing 117 spaces have been designated
as "A" parking.
The new parking area will be clas
sified as an "interim" parking lot,
according to Lerry, because the land
itself is considered a future building
site.

"The schematic plan for it was
made in the '60s, but it was put
aside," Lerry said. "I guess they
kept thinking they'd put a building
on the site."
The Committee on Parking and
Transportation recommended last
spring that construction begin and
ground was broken on the project
last month after funding was ap
proved.
After originally earmarking the
entire lot for "A" parking only, the
Committee on Parking and Trans
portation voted Monday to set aside
50 spaces for metered parking at the
request of the Planning Office. That
