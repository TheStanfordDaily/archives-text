Palestinian rebels shell Arafat
Tripoli, Lebanon — Palestinian rebels backed by Syria rained
hundreds of shells on PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's last Middle East
bastion yesterday, cornering him in Tripoli and ignoring his pleas for a
truce.
The rebel barrage prevented the Palestine Liberation Organization
leader from visiting loyalist holdouts at the beseiged Baddawi refugee
camp outside Tripoli. Black smoke from raging fires hung over the
port city of 500,000.
But Arafat visited maimed supporters in hospitals, roving the streets
in a chauffeured jeep while shells from rebels in the north and east oc
casionally slammed into neighborhoods near his office.
"There's been no progress in talks anywhere," Arafat told reporters
who followed him to the Islamic Hospital, where he chatted with
patients and signed autographs.

The PLO mutineers have chased most of Arafat's estimated 8000
loyalists into their last stronghold in the Middle East — Tripoli, 50
miles north of Beirut. More than 1000 people have been killed since
the lighting began Nov. J, according to Lebanese police.
The rebels claim Arafat has betrayed the PLO's aim of wresting a
homeland from Israel. Arafat claims the rebels have been deceived by
Syria, which he says wants to dominate the PLO.
Syria denies involvement in the mutiny, but Syrian troops in north
Lebanon have been openly supporting the mutineers with tanks and
artillery.
Several reporters following Arafat asked him about an erroneous
broadcast report Tuesdav that he had fled the country. He shouted:
"You have eyes!"
On Tuesday, Arafat abandoned his vow to fight to the death in
Tripoli, saving he was responding to the pleas of municipal leaders to
spare the citv a bloodbath. He offered to stop fighting if the rebels
did.
The mutineers responded by raining hundreds of
shells and rockets on Arafat's remaining positions,
intensifying the barrage early yesterday.
In Damascus, official sources who spoke on con
dition they not be identified said mediators from
three Arab nations worked with Syrian government
officials and rebel PLO leaders to end the fighting.
But the sources said rebels would not agree to a
truce unless Arafat leaves Lebanon and never
returns.
Election results: Evans wins
The loser in Washington's Senate race congrat
ulated Republican Dan Evans yesterday, but insisted
the vote wasn't a victory for President Reagan, while
in Kentucky, Martha Layne Collins said she expected
close scrutiny as the state's first woman governor.
W. Wilson Goode, elected as Philadelphia's first
black mayor, met with retiring Mayor William
Greene to plan the transition. His election in the na
tion's fourth-largest city will put four of the
country's six biggest cities in the hands of black
chief executives.
In other voting Tuesday, John Birch Society Chair
man Larry McDonald's widow lost a special election
for the House seat that had been held by her hus
band, who died Sept. 1 when a Korean airliner was
shot down by a Soviet jet. Democratic Attorney Gen
eral Bill Allain was elected governor of Mississippi,
overcoming charges that he had had sex with male
prostitutes.
Dianne Feinstein in San Francisco and Kathv
Whitmire in Houston both won second terms. But in
Miami, five-term incumbent Maurice Ferre was
forced into a Nov. 15 runoff with second-place finis
her Xavier Suarez.
Eleven states and the District of Columbia had
reterendums on the ballot. New York voters ap
proved Gov. Mario Cuomo's request for a $1.25 bil
lion bond issue to rebuild the state's crumbling
roads, railways and bridges, and Ohioans voted to
keep the 90 percent income tax increase backed by
Gov. Richard Celeste. Maine voters rejected an at
tempt to ban moose hunting.
Evans' victory in Washington maintained the 55-45
GOP margin in the Senate and boosted Republican
hopes for retaining control of the Senate next year.
Reagan gains support from invasion
Washington — President Reagan's handling of the
Grenada invasion has won widespread public and
congressional support, given the president himself a
surge in popularity and, polls indicate, allayed
growing concern over his conduct of foreign affairs.
Prior to the Oct. 25 invasion, polls showed that
Americans had become increasingly worried about
violence in Lebanon and Central America and about
tensions in U.S.-Soviet relations that had been
heightened by the Soviets' downing of a South
Korean jetliner.
But those issues appear to have overshadowed, if
not defused, by the swiftness with which U.S. forces
carried out their mission on Grenada and the per
suasiveness with which the president made the case
that the invasion had been necessary to save Ameri
can lives and prevent the Caribbean island from be
coming a Cuban stronghold for exporting revolution
to Latin America.
"Reagan managed to distract the public's atten
tion from the bombings in Lebanon with the
Grenada invasion just like President Johnson took
the focus off Vietnam ... by ordering the invasion
of the Dominican Republic in 1965," said Robert
Neuman, a Democratic Party spokesman.
The administration, although it barred reporters
from covering the invasion the first two days and
restricted coverage the next three days, has put on a
public relations blitz in arguing the necessity of the
action.
Reagan himself made television appearances the
day of the invasion and two days afterward, and later

he held White House ceremonies to honor mem
bers of the invading force and American medical stu
dents who had been evacuated from the island.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has appeared
on a series of national television shows, and, in a
rare television appearance for a top military official,
Gen. John Vessey, chairman of the loint Chiefs of
Staff, was a guest on NBC's "Meet the Press."
In the face of these developments, and with most
members of a congressional fact-finding committee
having concluded that the invasion was justified,
most of the Democratic opposition voiced earlier
has melted away.
Such liberal critics as House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.), who had criticized the inva
sion as "gunboat diplomacy," and The Washington
Post have had second thoughts. O'Neill said Tues
day that because most members of the fact-finding
group thought Americans on Grenada had been in
danger, the invasion had been "justified." And the
Post said in an editorial published yesterday, "All
things considered, we think that President Reagan
made the right decision in Grenada."
House refuses Commission funds
Washington—The House retaliated last night
against President Reagan's firing of three members
of the Civil Rights Commission by refusing to appro
priate funds for the agency as it is currently con
stituted.
Members voted 235 to 170 to reject $11.9 million
included for the commission at the behest of Senate
conferees in an appropriations bill for the State,
Justice and Commerce Departments. The confer
ence report now goes to the Senate with an $11.9
million disagreement.
Although the Civil Rights Commission is supposed
to die Nov. 29 without new authorization from
Congress, critics of Reagan's efforts to install his ap
pointees warned that the administration would seize
on the appropriation as a legal excuse to keep the
commission alive, even without a fresh authoriza
tion bill.
"Continuation of the commission as it is presently
structured would ratify the firings," protested Rep.
Don Edwards (D-Calif.), a leader in a House-Senate
drive to transform the agency into a congressional
body divorced from the executive branch.
Reagan triggered the crisis Oct. 24 when he
"terminated" the open-ended commission appoint
ments of holdover Democrats Mary Frances Berry,
Blandina Ramirez and Rabbi Murray Saltzman. The
president had already replaced two other Republi
can commission members.
Rep. Hamilton Fish (R.-N.Y.) ranking minority
member on the House Judiciary Committee, joined
Edwards in a "Dear Colleague" letter calling the ap
propriations vote "the most important civil rights
vote since the extension of the Voting Rights Act."
"At issue," they said, "is whether the Civil Rights
Commission will be a truly non-partisan, indepen
dent commission, or a political vehicle where five of
its six members were fired by the President."
Stocks rise in active trading
New York — Stocks mostly rose in active trading
yesterday and a late rally lifted the Dow Jones Indus
trial average to its best gain in a month.
Auto, retail, airline, oil and electronic issues
paced the advance, while some financial stocks
retreated.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 22.36
points over the four previous sessions, climbed
17.58 to 1232.52 — its best one-day gain since it rose
18.60 on Oct. 6.

House refuses Commission funds
Washington—The House retaliated last night

Although the Civil Rights Commission is supposed

Palestinian rebels shell Arafat
Tripoli, Lebanon — Palestinian rebels backed by Syria rained
hundreds of shells on PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's last Middle East
bastion yesterday, cornering him in Tripoli and ignoring his pleas for a
truce.
The rebel barrage prevented the Palestine Liberation Organization
leader from visiting loyalist holdouts at the beseiged Baddawi refugee
camp outside Tripoli. Black smoke from raging fires hung over the
port city of 500,000.
But Arafat visited maimed supporters in hospitals, roving the streets
in a chauffeured jeep while shells from rebels in the north and east oc
casionally slammed into neighborhoods near his office.
"There's been no progress in talks anywhere," Arafat told reporters
who followed him to the Islamic Hospital, where he chatted with
patients and signed autographs.

The PLO mutineers have chased most of Arafat's estimated 8000
loyalists into their last stronghold in the Middle East — Tripoli, 50
miles north of Beirut. More than 1000 people have been killed since
the lighting began Nov. J, according to Lebanese police.
The rebels claim Arafat has betrayed the PLO's aim of wresting a
homeland from Israel. Arafat claims the rebels have been deceived by
Syria, which he says wants to dominate the PLO.
Syria denies involvement in the mutiny, but Syrian troops in north
Lebanon have been openly supporting the mutineers with tanks and
artillery.
Several reporters following Arafat asked him about an erroneous
broadcast report Tuesdav that he had fled the country. He shouted:
"You have eyes!"
On Tuesday, Arafat abandoned his vow to fight to the death in
Tripoli, saving he was responding to the pleas of municipal leaders to
spare the citv a bloodbath. He offered to stop fighting if the rebels
did.
The mutineers responded by raining hundreds of
shells and rockets on Arafat's remaining positions,
intensifying the barrage early yesterday.
In Damascus, official sources who spoke on con
dition they not be identified said mediators from
three Arab nations worked with Syrian government
officials and rebel PLO leaders to end the fighting.
But the sources said rebels would not agree to a
truce unless Arafat leaves Lebanon and never
returns.
Election results: Evans wins
The loser in Washington's Senate race congrat
ulated Republican Dan Evans yesterday, but insisted
the vote wasn't a victory for President Reagan, while
in Kentucky, Martha Layne Collins said she expected
close scrutiny as the state's first woman governor.
W. Wilson Goode, elected as Philadelphia's first
black mayor, met with retiring Mayor William
Greene to plan the transition. His election in the na
tion's fourth-largest city will put four of the
country's six biggest cities in the hands of black
chief executives.
In other voting Tuesday, John Birch Society Chair
man Larry McDonald's widow lost a special election
for the House seat that had been held by her hus
band, who died Sept. 1 when a Korean airliner was
shot down by a Soviet jet. Democratic Attorney Gen
eral Bill Allain was elected governor of Mississippi,
overcoming charges that he had had sex with male
prostitutes.
Dianne Feinstein in San Francisco and Kathv
Whitmire in Houston both won second terms. But in
Miami, five-term incumbent Maurice Ferre was
forced into a Nov. 15 runoff with second-place finis
her Xavier Suarez.
Eleven states and the District of Columbia had
reterendums on the ballot. New York voters ap
proved Gov. Mario Cuomo's request for a $1.25 bil
lion bond issue to rebuild the state's crumbling
roads, railways and bridges, and Ohioans voted to
keep the 90 percent income tax increase backed by
Gov. Richard Celeste. Maine voters rejected an at
tempt to ban moose hunting.
Evans' victory in Washington maintained the 55-45
GOP margin in the Senate and boosted Republican
hopes for retaining control of the Senate next year.
Reagan gains support from invasion
Washington — President Reagan's handling of the
Grenada invasion has won widespread public and
congressional support, given the president himself a
surge in popularity and, polls indicate, allayed
growing concern over his conduct of foreign affairs.
Prior to the Oct. 25 invasion, polls showed that
Americans had become increasingly worried about
violence in Lebanon and Central America and about
tensions in U.S.-Soviet relations that had been
heightened by the Soviets' downing of a South
Korean jetliner.
But those issues appear to have overshadowed, if
not defused, by the swiftness with which U.S. forces
carried out their mission on Grenada and the per
suasiveness with which the president made the case
that the invasion had been necessary to save Ameri
can lives and prevent the Caribbean island from be
coming a Cuban stronghold for exporting revolution
to Latin America.
"Reagan managed to distract the public's atten
tion from the bombings in Lebanon with the
Grenada invasion just like President Johnson took
the focus off Vietnam ... by ordering the invasion
of the Dominican Republic in 1965," said Robert
Neuman, a Democratic Party spokesman.
The administration, although it barred reporters
from covering the invasion the first two days and
restricted coverage the next three days, has put on a
public relations blitz in arguing the necessity of the
action.
Reagan himself made television appearances the
day of the invasion and two days afterward, and later

he held White House ceremonies to honor mem
bers of the invading force and American medical stu
dents who had been evacuated from the island.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has appeared
on a series of national television shows, and, in a
rare television appearance for a top military official,
Gen. John Vessey, chairman of the loint Chiefs of
Staff, was a guest on NBC's "Meet the Press."
In the face of these developments, and with most
members of a congressional fact-finding committee
having concluded that the invasion was justified,
most of the Democratic opposition voiced earlier
has melted away.
Such liberal critics as House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.), who had criticized the inva
sion as "gunboat diplomacy," and The Washington

Reagan gains support from invasion
Washington — President Reagan's handling of the
Grenada invasion has won widespread public and
congressional support, given the president himself a
surge in popularity and, polls indicate, allayed
growing concern over his conduct of foreign affairs.
Prior to the Oct. 25 invasion, polls showed that
Americans had become increasingly worried about
violence in Lebanon and Central America and about
tensions in U.S.-Soviet relations that had been
heightened by the Soviets' downing of a South
Korean jetliner.
But those issues appear to have overshadowed, if
not defused, by the swiftness with which U.S. forces
carried out their mission on Grenada and the per
suasiveness with which the president made the case
that the invasion had been necessary to save Ameri
can lives and prevent the Caribbean island from be
coming a Cuban stronghold for exporting revolution
to Latin America.
"Reagan managed to distract the public's atten
tion from the bombings in Lebanon with the
Grenada invasion just like President Johnson took
the focus off Vietnam ... by ordering the invasion
of the Dominican Republic in 1965," said Robert
Neuman, a Democratic Party spokesman.
The administration, although it barred reporters
from covering the invasion the first two days and
restricted coverage the next three days, has put on a
public relations blitz in arguing the necessity of the
action.
Reagan himself made television appearances the
day of the invasion and two days afterward, and later

he held White House ceremonies to honor mem
bers of the invading force and American medical stu
dents who had been evacuated from the island.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has appeared
on a series of national television shows, and, in a
rare television appearance for a top military official,
Gen. John Vessey, chairman of the loint Chiefs of
Staff, was a guest on NBC's "Meet the Press."
In the face of these developments, and with most
members of a congressional fact-finding committee
having concluded that the invasion was justified,
most of the Democratic opposition voiced earlier
has melted away.
Such liberal critics as House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.), who had criticized the inva
sion as "gunboat diplomacy," and The Washington
Post have had second thoughts. O'Neill said Tues
day that because most members of the fact-finding
group thought Americans on Grenada had been in
danger, the invasion had been "justified." And the
Post said in an editorial published yesterday, "All
things considered, we think that President Reagan
made the right decision in Grenada."
House refuses Commission funds
Washington—The House retaliated last night
against President Reagan's firing of three members
of the Civil Rights Commission by refusing to appro
priate funds for the agency as it is currently con
stituted.
Members voted 235 to 170 to reject $11.9 million
included for the commission at the behest of Senate
conferees in an appropriations bill for the State,
Justice and Commerce Departments. The confer
ence report now goes to the Senate with an $11.9
million disagreement.
Although the Civil Rights Commission is supposed
to die Nov. 29 without new authorization from
Congress, critics of Reagan's efforts to install his ap
pointees warned that the administration would seize
on the appropriation as a legal excuse to keep the
commission alive, even without a fresh authoriza
tion bill.
"Continuation of the commission as it is presently
structured would ratify the firings," protested Rep.
Don Edwards (D-Calif.), a leader in a House-Senate
drive to transform the agency into a congressional
body divorced from the executive branch.
Reagan triggered the crisis Oct. 24 when he
"terminated" the open-ended commission appoint
ments of holdover Democrats Mary Frances Berry,
Blandina Ramirez and Rabbi Murray Saltzman. The
president had already replaced two other Republi
can commission members.
Rep. Hamilton Fish (R.-N.Y.) ranking minority
member on the House Judiciary Committee, joined
Edwards in a "Dear Colleague" letter calling the ap
propriations vote "the most important civil rights
vote since the extension of the Voting Rights Act."
"At issue," they said, "is whether the Civil Rights
Commission will be a truly non-partisan, indepen
dent commission, or a political vehicle where five of
its six members were fired by the President."
