Palestinian rebels shell Arafat
Tripoli, Lebanon — Palestinian rebels backed by Syria rained
hundreds of shells on PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's last Middle East
bastion yesterday, cornering him in Tripoli and ignoring his pleas for a
truce.
The rebel barrage prevented the Palestine Liberation Organization
leader from visiting loyalist holdouts at the beseiged Baddawi refugee
camp outside Tripoli. Black smoke from raging fires hung over the
port city of 500,000.
But Arafat visited maimed supporters in hospitals, roving the streets
in a chauffeured jeep while shells from rebels in the north and east oc
casionally slammed into neighborhoods near his office.
"There's been no progress in talks anywhere," Arafat told reporters
who followed him to the Islamic Hospital, where he chatted with
patients and signed autographs.

The PLO mutineers have chased most of Arafat's estimated 8000
loyalists into their last stronghold in the Middle East — Tripoli, 50
miles north of Beirut. More than 1000 people have been killed since
the lighting began Nov. J, according to Lebanese police.
The rebels claim Arafat has betrayed the PLO's aim of wresting a
homeland from Israel. Arafat claims the rebels have been deceived by
Syria, which he says wants to dominate the PLO.
Syria denies involvement in the mutiny, but Syrian troops in north
Lebanon have been openly supporting the mutineers with tanks and
artillery.
Several reporters following Arafat asked him about an erroneous
broadcast report Tuesdav that he had fled the country. He shouted:
"You have eyes!"
On Tuesday, Arafat abandoned his vow to fight to the death in
Tripoli, saving he was responding to the pleas of municipal leaders to
spare the citv a bloodbath. He offered to stop fighting if the rebels
did.
