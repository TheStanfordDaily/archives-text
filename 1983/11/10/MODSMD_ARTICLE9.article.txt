# On buses, kiosks and a big old Buick
## 
### 
Can you inform your readers
as to where and how the Stan
ford shuttle bus gained the
name "Marguerite"?
The name Marguerite is an
old one in the Stanford com
munity. The original name
sake of all of the streets and
buses and such was Mrs.
Leland Stanford's favorite
horse, a long-time resident of
the Stanford stables. Barbara
Klein, associate director of
housing, helped me out with
this answer.

Bug Me

Incidentally, Klein reminded
me that an entirely new Mar
guerite system goes into oper
ation in December, with new
buses and new routes.
Are the kiosks (those enlarged
bollards that are plastered with
posters) ever cleaned?
- A faculty brat
OK kids, get out your cal
culators. Let's say these kiosks
are six feet tall and eight feet
around. A stack of 400 eight
by-twelve pieces of paper is
about an inch thick and we'll
assume that 100 flyers,
notices, jingoistic political
slogans and such are put up in
one week.
If my batteries are good,
that makes a kiosk grow two
inches thicker every ten years.
If this practice were to con
tinue until the year 3000, the
kiosks would become 50-toot
diameter eye-sores. This ques
tion is an important one for all
of Stanford and so I'd like to
personally thank this in
quisitive "faculty brat" for
bringing it to light.
Stanford's 20 kiosks were
designed and built in the mid
-1970s during the kiosk mania
that swept through campuses
nationwide. Management of
the kiosks comes under the
jurisdiction of University
Events and Services. Joan

Meister, public relations co
ordinator for Events and
Services provides us with the
answers.
Events and Services pro
vides a free poster distribution
service covering all kiosks and
locked bulletin boards on
campus.
Events and Services has
hired an off-campus contrac
tor to do the actual distribu
tion of the 10-20 posters per
week which are posted
through them. And it is this

contractor, which calls itself
"Paint the Town," that strips
the kiosks of their excess pos
terage once per quarter. Ac
cording to Meister, the job of
cleaning the kiosks is not a
whole lot of fun. But looking
at those figures, it's a good
thing someone is out there
doing it.
A note on the Stanford Fight
Song Parody
William Schaefer, Class of
'52, recently wrote in about
the key-shaking column a few
weeks ago. He enclosed a
photocopy from a 1949
Chaparral which contained, to
the best of Schaefer's recol
lection, the very first version
of "Sons of the Wealthy Few."
So here, in its entirety, is the
official Stanford Fight Sons
Pa rody.
Sons of the wealthy few,
Fight for your four-hole
Buicks,
Fight for a dame with a so
cial name
Who wants to get her kicks.
Fight, boys, for just a few
Oil wells to see us through.
Checkbook to checkbook,
diamond studs,
Sons of the wealthy few.
Now how many of you know
the song that inspired this hit,
or even know what a four-hole
Buick is?
