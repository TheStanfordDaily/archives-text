Stanford Head Football Coach Paul Wiggin is
expected to announce his resignation in a writ
ten statement today, The Daily learned last
night. His resignation will become effective at
the end of the football season.
Wiggin, who has one year remaining on a
five-year contract, informed his players of his in
tentions at a team meeting in Maples Pavilion
Wednesday before football practice. Stanford is
1-8 this season with two games left: home con
tests against Oregon and UC-Berkeley.
Although the pressure has been mounting on
the Stanford coach all season and his resigna
tion was expected, the timing of the announce
ment was somewhat of a surprise.
"I had heard so much stink about that
(Wiggin's resignation), it didn't come as too
much of a surprise to me," said senior wide
receiver Mike Tolliver. "It's like telling me
something that has already happened."
Wiggin and Athletic Director Andy Geiger
were unavailable for comment.

A two-time All-American lineman at Stanford
in 1955 and 1956, Wiggin took over the Stanford
head coaching job in 1980, replacing Rod
Dowhower. In four seasons at Stanford, he has
a 17-25 record with his only winning season
coming in 1980.
Wiggin's meeting with his players Wednesday
was brief, according to senior offensive lineman
Ken Orvick.
"He (Wiggin) says what's on his mind," Or
vick said. "He came right out and said it. It took
about five minutes."
"It was so abrupt that you never had a chance
to get emotional," Tolliver said.
While Wiggin has come under heavy criticism
from the Bay Area media, he was well-liked by
many of his players.
"I've always liked Coach Wiggin as a person
and as a coach," Orvick said. "I'm sorry to see
him leave. I know how much he loves Stanford.
"It was really hard for me because he was
here the whole time (I was)," Orvick, a fifth
year senior, added. "For me, he had a really big
influence on my life."
Orvick said the offensive line was visibly af
fected by Wiggin's announcement in Wednes

day's practice and was unusually silent during
its warm-up stretching session.
"There was no talking at all," he said. "No
one said anything during the stretching. It was
the first time that no one has said anything all
year."
Junior fullback Kaulana Park hinted Wig
gin said in his Wednesday meeting with his
players that he was under pressure to resign
earlier in the season.
"He (Wiggin) said that he had bt-r>n asked to
resign (earlier)," Park commented. He didn't
want to just because he wanted to end the
season with us. And I respect that."
Before taking the Stanford position, Wiggin
was the head coach of the National Football
League's Kansas City Chiefs between 1975 and
1977, where he posted an 11-24 record in two
and one-half seasons. He also put in stints as an
assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers and
the New Orleans Saints.
After graduating from Stanford in 1957, Wig
gin was drafted by the NFL's Cleveland Browns.
In 12 years at Cleveland, he played in three
world championship games and in the Pro Bowl
twice.
