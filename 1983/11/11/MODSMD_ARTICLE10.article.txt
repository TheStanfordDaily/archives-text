# Panel criticizes 'space wars' plan
## 
### DAN LABOV Staff writer 
President Reagan's "Star Wars"
weapons plan is likely to have a highly
destabilizing effect on the balance of
power and the already shaky relations
between the two superpowers, accor
ding to a panel at the Law School last
night.
The School of Law's International
Society sponsored the presentation in
response to the current U.S. develop
ment of anti-satellite (ASAT) and space
based anti-ballistic missile (ABM) tech
nology.
Law School Prof. John Barton and
Philip Farley, a senior fellow at the
Stanford Center for Arms Control and
International Security, discussed the
issue after a slideshow produced by
the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Barton and Farley advocated more
serious arms control negotiation on
the part of the United States. Barton
claimed that "in the ASAT business, if

agreement is still available, it is clearly
a mutually beneficial agreement."
Escalation of the arms race into
space would endanger our national se
curity for several reasons. If observa
tion and communication satellites in
space were subject to attack, a crucial
source of information would be
jeopardized, they said.
U.S. satellites provide a deterrent to
a Soviet surprise attack, as they are ca
pable of detecting a launch immedi
ately and allowing the United States
time to react. According to the Union
of Concerned Scientists' slideshow, 70
percent of U.S. military communica
tions use satellites, so if they were dis
abled, our nuclear forces could be
severed from their commanders at
home and forced to act without com
plete information.
Although the Union of Concerned
Scientist grants that the United States

is ahead of the Soviet Union in anti
satellite weapons, the group feels the
Soviets would quickly close the gap if
we began to deploy such weapons.
"Inevitably," the group claims, "an
ASAT launch race would hurt the
United States more than the Soviet
Union because of our greater reliance
on satellites to perform critical nation
al security functions."
President Reagan has expressed the
"Star Wars Vision" where space-based
ABMs could be used to destroy Soviet
missiles launched against us, thereby
rendering their nuclear arsenal im
potent and obsolete. However,
though they called it a hotly debated
issue in the technical community, Bar
ton and Farley said we are actually
decades away from perfecting such
technologies. In the meantime, the
Soviets could respond in a number of
ways which would increase the chance
of a conflict erupting.
