# Journalist decries polarization in Germany
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
The lifeline between East
and West Germany is gravely
influenced by the two super
powers, a German television
producer and editor said here
yesterday.
In what he called "not very
happy times for the people of
Germany," Erich Vogt, also a
professional journalism fellow
in the Communications De
partment here, said Soviet-
American accord is crucial to
the mutual interests of East
and West Germany â€” and the
world.
"There can be no interna
tional stability unless the
United States and the Soviet
Union conduct themselves
with restraint. The two sides
must co-exist or cause the ex
termination of the human
race," Vogt told about 40
people at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
Despite the failure of the
recent Geneva talks, Vogt
stressed the need to keep
Moscow and Washington
talking. He called the two su
perpowers "bullies with ex
tremely sensitive skins," and
warned that "anger, disgust
and indignation" are no sub
stitute for responsible policy.
But failure on the part of
outside countries to improve
the situation in East and West
Germany means that help
must come from within, Vogt
said.

"The failure of the United
States and France to prevent
construction of the (Berlin)

Wall reveals that if anything is
to be done to prevent cutting
off between the two
countries, it needs to be done
by the Germans themselves.
"We hope to bring changes
by coming closer together, by
dealing with East Germany,"
he said.
Vogt said that money is the
essential link that keeps the
lifeline between the two
countries going.
"East Germany needs to
keep its economy going," he
said. "With the reaping of
economic benefits, East Ger
man policy becomes very
flexible."
Vogt blamed the lack of

consumer goods in East Ger
many on that country's ex
portation of those items.

"Over 5000 commodities in
East Germany go to West Ger
many," he said. "Everything
from wallpaper and towels, to
toasters and shoes."
Expressing pessimism over
Germany's future, Vogt said
that the non-acceptance
agreements at Geneva have
caused many traditionally
strong supporters of Germany
to write of its "last future."
Although the ties between
West Germany and the United
States are severely strained,
another series of com
promises is far better than a
"course of no return," Vogt
warned.

stability unless
the U.S. and the
Soviet Union
conduct them

restraint.
