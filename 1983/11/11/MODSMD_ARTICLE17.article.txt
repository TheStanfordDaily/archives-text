## The 						Stanford Daily Bound by history

Planners responsible for renovation of the
Inner Quad have been accused of ignoring his
tory and attempting to transform the area into
"a modern shopping mall." judging from this
critique, one might think that the current plan
ners want to cut down the palm trees and add a
Baskin Robbins.
Yet the proposed plan is anything but radi
cal, and it certainly considers the history of the
Quad carefully. The current plan — which calls
for Board of Trustees approval in February and
completion by the end of next summer — in
cludes enlarging the eight existing planting
circles, surrounding the circles with a concrete
sitting ledge, pruning low-level shrubbery,
replacing the loose gravel with red brick,
removing the bike racks and adding lights.
We find this a welcome solution to what
most of us consider to be the ugliest three and
a half acres on campus. More importantly, the
proposed plan does not, as critics suggest,
abandon historical consistency; it instead
embraces a desirable blend o i history and prac
ticality.
Critics cite specifics of the plans as not con
forming to the designer's original intent. They
say that landscape architect Frederick Olmsted
would not have approved of enlarging the
circles or adding the seat walls. They say he
would object to the grass that will be planted
inside of the circles. They suggest that the

entire Quad be surtaced in a concrete or
similar material, except for the small planting
circles.
What the critics fail to perceive is that the
proposed plan would be fundamentally the
same as today's Quad. One less bush here,
one sitting ledge there does not constitute a
radical revision of what is undeniably an his
torically significant area of the University.
Furthermore, there is some confusion as to
what Olmsted's original plan entails. Olmsted,
for example, made no mention of lighting in
his documents. Vet to exclude this feature
from the Quad merely on this basis would be
ridiculous. If, as some claim, Olmsted wanted
a slab of concrete in our Quad, then the plan
ners are completely justified in updating his
blueprints. Though Olmsted was, and is, a
respected designer, Stanford should not be
bound by 100-year-old plans.
History is important. Tradition is important.
But so is practicality. The new plans basically
adhere to historical mandate, but when the
planners depart from Olmsted's proposals, it is
only because the old blueprints do not apply to
today's campus.
The critics say that "doing nothing would be
better than what the Facilities Project Manage
ment office is doing." While doing nothing
may be historically accurate, that sure would be
a silly reason not to fix up the Quad.
