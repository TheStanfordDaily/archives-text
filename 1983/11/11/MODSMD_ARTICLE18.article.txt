# A 						capital idea

### 
Any horizon-broadening opportunity a uni
versity can provide for its students strengthens
both the institution and its learners. That
simple fact is the fundamental reason Stanford
should pursue the development of a campus in
Washington, D.C.
But what lies deeper than that is the value of
an experience in the nation's capital. One rea
son for having a structured residential program
in Washington — and likely the impetus be
hind University President Donald Kennedy's
decision to look into the idea — is that more
students might be encouraged to spend some
time working for a public service organization.
The main reason few are interested in these
careers is the same one that keeps many from
taking an internship in Washington: money.
Spending a summer or quarter working in an
expensive city away from home while not re
ceiving a paycheck is an impossibility for most.
By establishing a campus, offering help with
traveling costs for students receiving financial
aid and giving academic credit for suitable in
ternships, the University would nearly abolish
the money factor.
As the situation stands now, getting units for
an internship isn't easy. Few departments are
willing to give credit for a job, even if the stu
dent offers to write a paper to supplement the
work. And getting units through SCIRE isn't
feasible for most because one has to be regis

tered — that means paying more than $3000 —
during the time the work is done. Stantord-in-
Washington would take care of the units prob
lem, while also possibly promoting the idea of
academic credit for unpaid work in other areas.
While internships in Washington seem to be
a dime a dozen, they aren't easy to get. A
campus in the capital could substantially help
Stanford students get the best positions.
Maybe the University could even arrange to
have a number of internships reserved for
Stanford students.
Furthermore, a campus in Washington
would bolster Stanford's image on the East
Coast — where some still perceive the Farm as
a "sunny California country club." Most im
portantly, a campus in Washington would pro
vide for many students what for a few hundred
has been one of the best experiences of their
college years.
On an academic level, Washington, with an
abundance of wonderful resources, is an at
tractive location for a campus. And there is
something special about living in the capital —
spine-chilling fireworks over the monuments,
assignments on the Hill, afternoon excursions
to historic Arlington Cemetery and evenings in
Georgetown pubs. A stint in Washington is an
opportunity every student should seek.
