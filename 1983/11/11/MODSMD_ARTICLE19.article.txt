# An all-night counseling stint
## 
### 
Midterms, midterms! They can
drive you crazy! Slowly, Jonathan,
slowly . . . Begin at the beginning.
It's three a.m. I'm working an all
nighter at the counseling center. You
can imagine how it is. Weirdos wan
dering in off the street: Freshmen En
glish instructors with homocidal
tendencies, manic-depressive LSJUM-
Bers, Valley girls with an insatiable
craving for boysenberry fro yo . . .
So I listen to them, and say, Yes,
or, No, or, Hoo boy! It gives me
such a warm feeling inside.
But my midterm, my midterm. I've
this incredibly vital midterm tomor
row, for my course on Epistemilogi
cal Eigenfunctions of Neurop
hysiological Necrophilia. My whole
future depends on it! My GPA
could waver by a whopping 0.001 of
a point!
So here I am, textbook in front of
me, hoping the weirdos will stay in
bed tonight, when —
Hair streaming, eyes rolling,
hands raised to high heaven, a wo
man scampers into The Bridge,
screeching:
"You gotta help me! CAPS says
I'm paranoid. My RA says I'm cute
but not too clever. But what do they
understand of the mesh of interna
tional intrigue, the complex
ramifications of realpolitick?"
"I give up. What's the answer?"
"You, only you, are my last
hope."
"The weather seems rather chilly
lately, wouldn't you agree?"
"It's like this," she shouts, clutch
ing fiercely at my lapels. "I just
escaped from LOTS! Comp. Sci.
105, middle of the night, only time
terminals are free, debugging a pro
gram, can't work it out, can't, termi
nals trilling like a cage of
parakeets — and then I realized."
"We're having a Bread Baking
Workshop tomorrow. It often helps
to ease tension."
"Bread baking , Shmead Shmak
ing — and then I realized The giant

conspiracy became crystal clear. It
can't be a coincidence, can it?"
"Er . . . no."
"There! I knew you'd understand.
Reagan invading Grenada and me
living in Granada dorm in Lagunita."
"There's a Self-Hypnosis
Workshop on Sunday. It's amazing
what you can convince yourself
when you try."
"And then I remembered the edi
torial in the Wall Street Journal
about the Reagan library, the one
that said Stanford's filled to the brim
with "avowed leftists and Marxists."
Vou see? You see? This is how the
CIA plans it — next, a leftist junta
from the Feminist Studies Program
topples Kennedy, and . . ."
"Try a massage workshop. You'd
be surprised how many interna
tional crises are caused by stiff
muscles at the back of the neck."
". . .And paratroops hurtling
down on White Plaza! Tanks rolling
up Palm Drive! Hostages rescued
from the torture chamber of
LOTS . .
"Would you like a cup of coffee?"
. .Or the Beirut thing
. . . Shiite extremists from UC-
Berkeley zap into Meyer Library
disguised as an armor plated cuddly
bear. KERPOW! The entire nerd
population wiped out at a stroke!"
"Well at least it would improve
the grading curve."
"You ain't heard nothin' yet.
Think how the Russians would
react."
"Oh but . . . surely . . . you
don't mean. .
"Yes. The Ruskies are going to
send troops into Moscow U. And
then it escalates!"
"Come to our Workshop tomor
row for training counselors at The
Bridge. It's only for the real
hardcore weirdos. How do you
think I got to work here?"
"Listen to me," she screamed,
grabbing me by the hair, "And then
it escalates! The United States drops

napalm on the Bay Area. The Soviets
wage biological warfare on Moscow.
The United States fires incendiaries
from San Jose to San Francisco, the
whole Peninsula is one raging in
ferno, and then . .
"Yes," I say, "Yes. It's all begin
ning to make sense . .
. . And then those evil
Commies aim an H-bomb at the
Kremlin! We fire one at the White
House! The Third World War breaks
out!"
"You know what this means?" I
cry, hugging her tight.
"Yes!" she says, "My program at
LOTS!"
"My midterm!"
