# Prof. warns of nuclear aftermath
## Dust cloud to block sun, damage food chain 
### SHIRISH DATE 
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich warned
yesterday that even a limited nuclear
war could have devastating effects
on the climatic conditions and
ecological systems of the entire
world.
Ehrlich, a speaker at the Oct. 31
conference in Washington, D.C. on
the ecological effects of nuclear
war, spoke before an overflow
crowd of about 200 in Terman
Auditorium.
He said that though many people
ire aware of the direct conse
quences of a nuclear exchange, the
secondary ecological effects have
ione unexamined until now. These
?ffects include long-term radiation
evels far higher than normal, as well
as enormous clouds of dust and
soot.
The larger of the nuclear devices
are able to "punch through into the
stratosphere," Ehrlich said, and thus
"inject" vast quantities of dust and
soot which would fall back to earth
over a long period of time.
This cloud would represent "an
incredible assault on the planet's
ecological system" since almost the
entire food chain is driven by
photosynthesis, Ehrlich said. He
added that though a drop of seven
to eight degrees Celsius in the
average temperature is enough to
wipe out grain crops, decreases of
40 , 50, or 60 degrees Celsius were
more realistic estimates for the
middle latitudes of America,
Europe and Asia.
Ehrlich also described the
probable effects of thermonuclear
war on the ozone layer. The intense
heat of a nuclear blast creates signif
icant quantities of nitrogen oxides.
Ehrlich said that many such explos
ions would have the effect of inject
ing these compounds into the
stratosphere where they would
break down the protective layer ot
ozone.
Since the ozone layer shields the
lurface of the planet from much of
■he sun's ultraviolet radiation,
Khrlich believes that even if sur
vivors of the initial blasts were to
fcndure the lack of food and water —
Bresh water sources would all be
ftozen over to a depth of three
Hieters — as well as the radioactive
they would be faced with ex-
high doses of ultraviolet ra-
Hation.
