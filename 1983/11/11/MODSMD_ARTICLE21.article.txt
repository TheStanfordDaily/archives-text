'Cow town college'
I am writing to express my con
cern over the apparent lack of taste
expressed by Brian Reid in the
computer break-in story printed in
the Nov. 8 edition of The Daily.
Asst. Prof. Reid makes a comment
regarding Purdue University as "a
cow town college that wouldn't
figure out he was messing around
with their system." I find it distress
ing that an educator at a school with
a reputation of being one of the
finest in the country would make
such a statement about another
institution of higher learning with
similar credentials.
This suggests to me a rather
closed and narrow viewpoint with a
disregard for fellow educators. I
hope this comment is the result of
poor word selection and not a case
of snobbery.
Concerning the rest of
Reid's comment, it is not men
tioned that during mid-September,
Purdue is in the midst of fall semes
ter classes while Stanford is not. I
would be interested in knowing
how fast he would be able to pick

out an intruder now, during the
middle of classes.
A final point, if Purdue is such a
"cow town college," how come
they recently installed one of the
most advanced computer systems
for an educational institution in the
United States?

Run off the road
To the motorist who, after run
ning a stop sign on campus at noon
last Sunday, then compounded the
offense by directing an insulting
gesture at the bicyclist whose right
of way he had usurped: It is annoy
ing to feel obliged to take evasive
action to save an irresponsible
motorist the trouble of cleaning bits
of blood and bicycle off his
fenders. Worse is the humiliation of
receiving a gratuitous insult from a
fellow member of our scholarly
community.
If you are unmoved, driver, by
the fact that manslaughter is a very
heavy burden to carry forever after

on one's conscience, at least re
member Winston Churchill's ad
monition that "if you have to kill a
man, it costs you nothing to be
polite."
To the Stanford community: Is it
not distasteful in a university to see
brainpower everywhere forced to
yield precedence to horsepower, to
have to acknowledge that care shall
drive cyclist off the road and cyclist
retaliate by chasing from the foot
path the pedestrian, who will in
turn, mobilizing a courage matched
only by his thoughtlessness,
achieve his vengence by obstruct
ing the lawful progress of anyone
he can?
How much more scholarship
could take place on campus if one
could spend the minutes between
classes strolling in reflection rather
than dashing in terror from shelter
to shelter? Interrupted thoughts,
broken heads, and the deviseness
of constant struggle for domination
of the roadway are no help to our
intellectual endeavors.
