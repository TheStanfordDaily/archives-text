## Mediation before invasion 
### 
At one of his first press conferences, President
Reagan accused the Soviet Union of recognizing no
morality but that which would further its own cause.
Yet by ordering the invasion of Grenada, President
Reagan has shown that he too will "compromise
morality to further his own cause.
The decision to invade Grenada shows a con
temptuous disregard for the legal rights of nations, and
offends the principles of peace, justice and liberty
upon which our own country was founded. Using the
violent means of political coercion for which he self
righteously vilifies the Soviets, President Reagan has
weakened, if not collapsed, the moral foundations on
which he claims to stand. We can only hope that the in
vasion will not establish a precedent for future foreign
U.S. policy.
Unfortunately, the invasion of Grenada
demonstrates a long established precendent or pattern
of events in U.S. relations with Latin American nations.
Having supported the repressive and unpopular despot
Eric Gairy, who took power in a fixed election when
Grenada became independent from direct British con
trol in 1973, the United States helped to polarize the in
ternal politics of the tiny island state.
When Maurice Bishop finally freed Grenada from the
economic devastation of "Hurricane Gairy" (as he is
known to Grenadians,) the revolutionary New Jewel
movement led by Bishop numbered more than 25,000
people. After the bloodless coup of 1979, Bishop at
tempted to rebuild Grenada's economy, but the United
States interfered with Bishop's attempts to get money
from Western-Bloc nations. In 1982, for example, when
Bishop applied to the European Economic Community
for development funds, the Reagan admininstration
dissuaded France, West Germany, Italy and other
Western-bloc countries from participating in the con
ference.
By first supporting a repressive dictator, the United
States fostered revolution and forced the New jewel
movement to look for assistance from Cuba. Then by
attempting to block Bishop's applications for loans
from the European Economic Community, the Interna
tional Monetary Fund and the Caribbean Development
Bank, the Reagan administration pressured Bishop to
rely even more upon Cuba, the Soviet Union and North
Korea for assistance. The first insult came on March 23,
1983 when President Reagan accused Grenada of hos

ting "Soviet-Cuban militarization" and now, the inva
sion.
Grenada, of course, is not the first Latin American na
tion that the United States has, perhaps unintentional
ly, polarized into hostile opposing political factions.' By
supporting Anastasio Samoza, whose dictatorship
lasted in Nicaragua from 1936 to 1979, the United States
contributed to the conflict between Somoza and the
Sandanistas. When U.S. military aid to Somoza led to
more violent repression and widespread violation of
human rights in Nicaragua, the Sandanistas had to rely
upon Cuba and the Soviet Union for the arms they
needed to put down the national guard. Similar pat
terns of events threaten today in Chile, El Salvador and
the Philippines, to mention only three U.S.-supported
dictatorships.
Sadly, the Reagan administration's support of un
popular dictators in these countries points to another
clearly hypocritical U.S. policy. So long as a dictator
ship aligns itself with U.S. interests and joins the
United States in denouncing communism, not only can
the United States tolerate, but it can support that dic
tatorship. Vet, even if a popularly elected government
tends to align itself with what President Reagan in a
1980 Wall Street Journal interview called "an evil
empire," then the United States attempts to bring
about its collapse. The fall of Salvador Allende tells the
truth of the latter.
The end of this process polarization, condemna
tion and supplantation is our own demoralization.
There is no apology for the tendency, if not policy, of
the United States to exacerbate conflict throughout the
world, for the Reagan administration's lack of concern
for human rights, and for President Reagan's narrow
view of democracy and self-determination.
The recent invasion of Grenada shows |ust how dan
gerous is the formula to perceive all internal political
problems as a struggle between communism and
democracy, the Soviet Union and the United States.
Rather than brandishing military force and perpetuat
ing misery throughout the world, the United States
should be setting an example to other nations by ex
tending the hand of friendship and cooperation.
Had President Reagan attempted peaceful mediation
before he ordered the invasion of Grenada, it is likely
that more than 70 human beings would not have bled
to death. The chance was worth the taking.
