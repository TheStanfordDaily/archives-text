## Lame Ducks limp onto Farm 
### ADAM BERNS 
Trick-or-treat season may be over, but
Oregon football Head Coach Rich Brooks
is still up to his old tricks, and based on
Stanford's performance against trick
plays last Saturday versus USC, that could
spell trouble for the Cardinal.
"They have every trick play in the
book," Stanford football Coach Paul Wig
gin said about the Duck offense. "We
have two pages of trick plays in our scout
ing book. They do everything."
Last week, the Ducks came out lining
up everybody on one side of the center,
and Brooks did not discount doing some
thing crazy this week.
"We might try anything," Brooks
loked. "We might even line up in the old
single wing."
Because they have been beset by in
luries in recent weeks, Wiggin feels that
the Ducks will be even more likely to try
some of their trick plays this week.
The most recent injury occurred last
.veek against UCLA when Oregon's start
ing quarterback Mike Jorgensen broke
his leg and was replaced by sophomore
Vlike Owens. Owens, however, was inef
fective and freshman Chris Miller came
off the bench to close out the third and
fourth quarters. Brooks said that both
quarterbacks will probably see action this
A'eek although Owens is tentatively
scheduled to start.
The Ducks are 3-6 this year, 2-3 in the
Pacific-10 conference, and boast victories

over both Arizona and UC-Berkeley.
Injuries, however, have been the big
story at the University of Oregon. The in
jury list reads almost as long as doctoral
dissertation with the offensive line and
the defensive secondary bearing most of
the burden.
For example, offensive linemen Greg
Schwab, Drew Smetana and Craig Kaylor
have already been lost for the season.
Senior All-America candidate, center
Gary Zimmerman will be playing with a
knee injury Saturday.
"We don't have the depth to sustain
the injuries," Brooks said earlier in the
week. "Our tackle situation has been
bad. We've had a lot of injury problems."
One reason for Oregon's crazy offense
has been the influence of offensive co
ordinator Bob Toledo from San Jose, who
began his coaching career at Riordan
High School in San Francisco.
"You could see the influence (of
Toledo) earlier in the season," Brooks
said, "before the injuries started to pile
up."
Oregon's top offensive threat this
season is wide receiver Lew Barnes who is
second in the nation in punt returns,
averaging 15.8 yards per return. Barnes
has also caught 23 passes for 505 yards
and has rushed for 83 yards on 13 carries.
Highly touted freshman running back
Kevin Wilhite, brother of former San Jose
State running back Gerald Wilhite, has
been hampered by injuries this season

and it is doubtful whether he will play
tomorrow.
"He (Wilhite) has been bothered by in
juries," Brooks said. "He dislocated his
shoulder and also had an ankle sprain last
week."
Defensively, the Oregon defense is
very similar to Stanford's.
"They (the Ducks) play it (defense) very
similar to what we do. It's almost a carbon
copy of what we do. Bascially they're a
zone defense and they play a four-man
front. They also use some three-man
fronts. They don't blitz very often."
While the Duck offense has not been
very effective, defense has been its strong
suit.
Like Oregon, Stanford has played well
on defense but has not had the produc
tion it would like from its offensive
players.
One player who has stood out in the
last few games has been halfback Shaun
Avant. In the last three weeks, Avant has
rushed 26 times for 139 yards, caught six
passes for % yards, and returned six kick
offs for 130 yards.
"He's a good receiver and has been an
excellent effort player," Wiggin said.
"Although he is a very different type of
player, he fits the Vincent White (receiver
and runner) dual role very well."
Freshman fullback Marshall Dillard will
start again this week at fullback although

Freshman quarterback John Paye scrambles from an Arizona defender. Paye, who is 111 -of
-217 for 1468 yards this season joins the Cardinal in the fight against the Oregon Ducks
tomorrow.
