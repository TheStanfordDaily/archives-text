Las Vegas (AP) — Marvelous Marvin
Hagler, fighting a man he called "a
legend," showed last night what it takes
to heat someone that good.
"I give him a lot of credit, but you've
got to give me a lot of credit too," Hagler
said after defending his undisputed mid
dleweight crown with a unanimous, but
close, 15-round decision over Roberto
Duran.
"This man's a legend. I'm very proud of
myself to beat a man with three world
titles."
Hagler, who has longed for a big
payday throughout his 62-fight profes

sional career, said the money he earned
for beating Duran — more than $5 million
— made his entire boxing career
worthwhile.
"The peanuts all paid off tonight. I
knew one day I'd be there. I kept the
faith. I guess tonight was the big money,
eh?"
Hagler says he knew he had to win the
final two rounds to retain his title.
"My manager and trainer told me, 'We
got to win these big,' " Hagler said. 'I
couldn't see him beating me."
Hagler said he thought he was comfor

tably ahead in the tight but was wary of
the judging at ringside.
"I told you I was scared being here in
Las Vegas," he said in a reference to the
judging.
Hagler, who started slowly against
Duran and had trouble finding his target
throughout the tight, said he was too
tight in the early rounds and never could
get untracked.
"I started loosening up very late in this
tight," said the champion. "I realized I
had to get mv combinations off faster. He
was vers quick inside."
