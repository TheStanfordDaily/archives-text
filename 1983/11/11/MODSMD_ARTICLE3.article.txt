[Syrians fire at U.S. jets
I Beirut, Lebanon — U.S. jets came under attack tor
■he first time in Lebanon yesterday when Syrian gun-
Biers fired missiles at carrier-based planes. At Beirut
lirport, small-arms fire hit Marine positions.
1 Pressure mounted on Yasser Aratat to leave the
■orthern city of Tripoli and the end the Palestinian
Buerrilla war that has killed at least 1000 people.

Brove off four U.S. F-14 Tomcats. No hits were re-
Hprted. Lebanese radio stations said the Syrian tiring
Htgan in the early morning when the jets scrambled

Bissance sorties. incnn
■'■Assistant White House press secretary

Franklin, with President Reagan in Tokyo, said the
jets were on a "routine" mission when they came
under fire from an unidentified ground site in
central Lebanon.
American Marines came under small-arms fire in
the afternoon along the eastern perimeter of their
base at Beirut airport. The Marines returned fire and
the shooting ended in about two and a half minutes
with no casualties, said Marine spokesperson Capt.
Wayne Jones.
The shooting heightened tension that has been
escalating since suicide bombings killed 239 Ameri
can and 58 French troops in Beirut Oct. 23, and 28 Is
raelis and 32 Lebanese prisoners in Tyre Nov. 4. The
American, French and Israeli governments blame
Moslem fanatics operating behind Syrian lines in
Lebanon.
Senate passes funding bill
Washington — Nearly four hours after a
midnight deadline, the Senate passed by
voice vote early today emergency legislation
to keep money flowing to most of the federal
government.
However, the action still left many govern
ment agencies technically broke because
congressional negotiators now must meet
today to hammer out a compromise with a
version of the stopgap bill passed earlier by
the House. That compromise then would
have to be ratified by each chamber.
Meeting through the night and into the
morning, the Senate joined the House in
agreeing to an amendment to the stopgap
spending bill that would ban funding for
abortions under federal employees' health
plans except when the mother's life is endan
gered. But the Senate failed to approve the
spending bill itself before yesterday's mid
night deadline.
Although the deadline wasn't met, there
will be little, if any, impact on government
operations because of the Veterans Day
holiday today and the upcoming weekend.
The House and Senate will be in session to
finish work on the legislation.
Reagan speaks to Diet
Tokyo — President Reagan, making no ap
parent headway in his bid to expand Ameri
can access to Japanese markets, appealed di
rectly to Japan's legislators today for help in
shrinking the huge U.S. trade deficit giving
him political headaches back home.
In a prepared speech, the first by an Ameri
can president before the Diet, the Japanese
parliament, Reagan said, "We need your
help in demonstrating free trade to address
concerns of my own people."
The president told the lawmakers that
"Americans believe your markets are less
open than ours. We need your support to

lower further the barriers that still make it
difficult for many American products to enter
your markets easily."
While strongly castigating the Soviet go
vernment, Reagan promised that the United
States would never abandon arms control
negotiations with the Soviet Union.
"Our great frustration has been the other
side's unwillingness to negotiate in good
faith. We wanted to cut deep into nuclear ar
senals and still do. But they are blocking the
dramatic reductions the world wants." the
president said.
In urging a lowering of trade barriers,
Reagan denounced legislation passed by the
House last week over his objections that
would attmept to curb Japanese auto imports
by mandating inclusion of a percentage of
U.S. manufactured parts.
Proposition P passes
San Francisco — After a campaign that cost
the tobacco industry and its allies more than
$15 a vote, San Franciscans have narrowly ap
proved an ordinance giving non-smokers
more clout than in any other big city to
demand smoke-free zones in private work
places.
A tiny margin of victory emerged late Wed
nesday, more than 24 hours after the polls
closed, when more than 12,000 absentee bal
lots finally were tallied. Proposition P passed
80,740 to 79,481.
The vote marks San Franciscans as "a
health conscious electorate, not easily
hornswaggled by a high-priced ad cam
paign," said Supervisor Wendy Nelder, who
drafted the law.
Once the Board of Supervisors confirms
the results, employers have three months to
draft a smoking policy accommodating the
preferences of both smokers and non
smokers. If non-smokers are dissatisfied with
the arrangement and want smoking banned,
employers must honor their wishes or face
fines of up to $500 a day.
U.S. seals off Grenada airport
St. George's, Grenada — There are strong

indications that the United States is making
preparations to turn the Cuban-built airport
here at Point Salines into a permanent Ameri
can base. In the last tew days a steady stream
of trucks carrying heavy road-building and
construction equipment has been rolling off
a U.S. freighter in St. George's harbor and
has been moved to the Point Salines base.
With the reopening for civilian traffic of
Grenada's small tropical airstrip at Pearls, in
the center of the island, the U.S. military has
sealed off Point Salines, which was the major
entry point for journalists, aid officials,
diplomats and politicians arriving on the is
land. The military has put a ring of troops and
roadblocks around the airport and all but
military traffic has been diverted.
Although the United States is making plans
to appropriate aid for Grenada — to help
with reconstruction of roads and buildings
damaged during last month's invasion — it is
cautious about its plans for Point Salines. A
U.S. spokesman in St. George's describes
the future of the airport as a "high priority,"
but the representatives of civilian contractors
involved in the airport construction have
now been barred from the site, which is des
cribed as a secured area.
Stocks continue to rise
New York — Stock prices recorded their
second straight gain yesterday aided by
declining interest rates in the credit markets.
But analysts said the advance was limited
by the latest in a series of corporate earnings
disappointments, this one from Walt Disney
Productions.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
up 17.58 points Wednesday, rose another
3.35 to 1235.87.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
reached 88.73 million shares, up from 83.10
million in the previous session.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy with a few showers. Highs in
the upper 50s and 60s. Westerly winds at 10
to 20 miles per hour.

U.S. seals off Grenada airport
St. George's, Grenada — There are strong

indications that the United States is making
preparations to turn the Cuban-built airport
here at Point Salines into a permanent Ameri
can base. In the last tew days a steady stream
of trucks carrying heavy road-building and
construction equipment has been rolling off
a U.S. freighter in St. George's harbor and
has been moved to the Point Salines base.
With the reopening for civilian traffic of
Grenada's small tropical airstrip at Pearls, in
the center of the island, the U.S. military has
sealed off Point Salines, which was the major
entry point for journalists, aid officials,
diplomats and politicians arriving on the is
land. The military has put a ring of troops and
roadblocks around the airport and all but
military traffic has been diverted.
Although the United States is making plans
to appropriate aid for Grenada — to help
with reconstruction of roads and buildings
damaged during last month's invasion — it is
cautious about its plans for Point Salines. A
U.S. spokesman in St. George's describes
the future of the airport as a "high priority,"
but the representatives of civilian contractors
involved in the airport construction have
now been barred from the site, which is des
cribed as a secured area.
Stocks continue to rise
New York — Stock prices recorded their
second straight gain yesterday aided by
declining interest rates in the credit markets.
But analysts said the advance was limited
by the latest in a series of corporate earnings
disappointments, this one from Walt Disney
Productions.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
up 17.58 points Wednesday, rose another
3.35 to 1235.87.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
reached 88.73 million shares, up from 83.10
million in the previous session.

[Syrians fire at U.S. jets
I Beirut, Lebanon — U.S. jets came under attack tor
■he first time in Lebanon yesterday when Syrian gun-
Biers fired missiles at carrier-based planes. At Beirut
lirport, small-arms fire hit Marine positions.
1 Pressure mounted on Yasser Aratat to leave the
■orthern city of Tripoli and the end the Palestinian
Buerrilla war that has killed at least 1000 people.
kl Syria said its missile batteries in Central Lebanon
Brove off four U.S. F-14 Tomcats. No hits were re-
Hprted. Lebanese radio stations said the Syrian tiring
Htgan in the early morning when the jets scrambled
•m the carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower on recon-
Bissance sorties. incnn
■'■Assistant White House press secretary

Franklin, with President Reagan in Tokyo, said the
jets were on a "routine" mission when they came
under fire from an unidentified ground site in
central Lebanon.
American Marines came under small-arms fire in
the afternoon along the eastern perimeter of their
base at Beirut airport. The Marines returned fire and
the shooting ended in about two and a half minutes
with no casualties, said Marine spokesperson Capt.
Wayne Jones.
The shooting heightened tension that has been
escalating since suicide bombings killed 239 Ameri
can and 58 French troops in Beirut Oct. 23, and 28 Is
raelis and 32 Lebanese prisoners in Tyre Nov. 4. The
American, French and Israeli governments blame
Moslem fanatics operating behind Syrian lines in
Lebanon.
Senate passes funding bill
Washington — Nearly four hours after a
midnight deadline, the Senate passed by
voice vote early today emergency legislation
to keep money flowing to most of the federal
government.
However, the action still left many govern
ment agencies technically broke because
congressional negotiators now must meet
today to hammer out a compromise with a
version of the stopgap bill passed earlier by
the House. That compromise then would
have to be ratified by each chamber.
Meeting through the night and into the
morning, the Senate joined the House in
agreeing to an amendment to the stopgap
spending bill that would ban funding for
abortions under federal employees' health
plans except when the mother's life is endan
gered. But the Senate failed to approve the
spending bill itself before yesterday's mid
night deadline.
Although the deadline wasn't met, there
will be little, if any, impact on government
operations because of the Veterans Day
holiday today and the upcoming weekend.
The House and Senate will be in session to
finish work on the legislation.
Reagan speaks to Diet
Tokyo — President Reagan, making no ap
parent headway in his bid to expand Ameri
can access to Japanese markets, appealed di
rectly to Japan's legislators today for help in
shrinking the huge U.S. trade deficit giving
him political headaches back home.
In a prepared speech, the first by an Ameri
can president before the Diet, the Japanese
parliament, Reagan said, "We need your
help in demonstrating free trade to address
concerns of my own people."
The president told the lawmakers that
"Americans believe your markets are less
open than ours. We need your support to

lower further the barriers that still make it
difficult for many American products to enter
your markets easily."
While strongly castigating the Soviet go
vernment, Reagan promised that the United
States would never abandon arms control
negotiations with the Soviet Union.
"Our great frustration has been the other
side's unwillingness to negotiate in good
faith. We wanted to cut deep into nuclear ar
senals and still do. But they are blocking the
dramatic reductions the world wants." the
president said.
In urging a lowering of trade barriers,
Reagan denounced legislation passed by the
House last week over his objections that
would attmept to curb Japanese auto imports
by mandating inclusion of a percentage of
U.S. manufactured parts.
Proposition P passes
San Francisco — After a campaign that cost
the tobacco industry and its allies more than
$15 a vote, San Franciscans have narrowly ap
proved an ordinance giving non-smokers
more clout than in any other big city to
demand smoke-free zones in private work
places.
