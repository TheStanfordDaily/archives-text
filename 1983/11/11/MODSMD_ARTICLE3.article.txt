Franklin, with President Reagan in Tokyo, said the
jets were on a "routine" mission when they came
under fire from an unidentified ground site in
central Lebanon.
American Marines came under small-arms fire in
the afternoon along the eastern perimeter of their
base at Beirut airport. The Marines returned fire and
the shooting ended in about two and a half minutes
with no casualties, said Marine spokesperson Capt.
Wayne Jones.
The shooting heightened tension that has been
escalating since suicide bombings killed 239 Ameri
can and 58 French troops in Beirut Oct. 23, and 28 Is
raelis and 32 Lebanese prisoners in Tyre Nov. 4. The
American, French and Israeli governments blame
Moslem fanatics operating behind Syrian lines in
Lebanon.
