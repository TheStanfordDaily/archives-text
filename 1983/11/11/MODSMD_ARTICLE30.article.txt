# Fencers touch off season at USF
## 
### 
The nationally-ranked Stanford wo
men's fencing team opens its 1983-84
season by renewing an old rivalry when it
takes on the UC-Berkeley in San Fran
cisco tomorrow.
The Cardinal men, ranked eighth last
year, also open their season tomorrow,
against the University of San Francisco.
"USF will have a balanced team this
year," Stanford Head Fencing Coach
Buzz Hurst said, "but I think we're better
and we're ready."
Both meets are at USF and begin at 1
p.m.
"Stanford and Cal women have been
fencing against each other since at least

1920 that we know of, and we suspect the
rivalry goes back farther than that," said
Hurst.
"The two teams have not met for three
years, though, because the Bears have
been dormant. This summer, however, I
was contacted by the president of their
reactivated fencing club so here we are."
The last meeting between the two
teams was in 1980 and resulted in a 6-3
victory for California. "Cal had a strong
team that year, going on to third place in
Regionals and in the top 20 nationally.
This year we come in with essentially the
same team that was sixth in the nation last
season, and I expect a victory."
