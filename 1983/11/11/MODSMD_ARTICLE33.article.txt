# Cardinal trotters go to NCAA meet
## 
### RICK BILODEAU 
The Stanford men's and wo
men's cross country teams will
compete in the NCAA District
Eight meet in Corvallis, Ore.,
tomorrow. Three men's teams
and four women's squads will
advance to the NCAA Cham
pionships at Lehigh, Pa., on
Nov. 21.
The Cardinal women's team
appears to be a cinch to win
their contest, a race they won
last year by 22 points.
However, Stanford may be
without Ceci Hopp, who took
the individual honors in 1982.
Hopp has been suffering
from a hip injury all season
and although she traveled to
Corvallis with the team and is
almost back to normal train
ing, Coach Brooks Johnson
may still hold her out of
tomorrow's meet in order to
save her for the Nationals.
Even without Hopp's Al I -
American talents, the women
should have little trouble win
ning the meet.

The race for the individual
title, assuming Hopp's ab
sence, will be between
Oregon's kathy Hayes, Wash
ington's Regina Joyce and
Stanford's Alison Wiley and
Regina Jacobs. Also running
for top honors will be the
Plumer sisters â€” Stanford's
Patti Sue and her younger
sister Polly, who is sophomore
at UCLA.
While the women will have
easy passage to Pennsylvania,
the men's squad will have to
claw its way into the NCAAs.
Running against an almost
identical field two weeks ago
in the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships, Stanford
finished in fourth place, a
mere six points behind UCLA
in third.
Since only three teams ad
vance tomorrow, a strong five
man performance will be
needed to overcome the
Bruins and head eastward. The
team title itself will be fought
