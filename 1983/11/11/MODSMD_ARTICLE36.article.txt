# Poloists play Cal, attempt to save face
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Usually, when the Stanford
and UC-Berkeley water polo
teams hook up in their season
ending home-and-home se
ries, big things hinge on the
outcome.
It may be that one team
needs a two-game sweep to
land an NCAA tournament
berth, or that the No. 1
seeding at the nationals is on
the line. At the least, the
Pacific-10 Conference champi
onship always depends on the
outcome of the Stanford-Cal
meetings. Not this year.
When the 11-11-3 Cardinal
hikes across the Bay today to
challenge the No. 1-ranked
California Bears, they will be
playing for pride â€” and to
avoid Stanford's first losing
season since 1972.
Two months ago the Card
and the Bears battled to a 3-3
tie in the UC-lrvine Tourna
ment. Now Stanford is in the
midst of a four-game losing
streak that includes two disap
pointing performances against
No. 3 UCLA and No. 6 USC last
weekend. The Cardinal is not
exactly peaking for the na
tion's toughest club.
"You can't use the excuse
that they're freshman
anymore," says Head Coach
Dante Dettamanti after
guiding the Card through 25
games, "We're not getting

enough contribution from
everybody on offense. They
expect Imbo (freshman David
Imbernino) and (sophomore
Jaime) Velez to do it all."
Velez and Imbernino lead

the Cardinal attack with 40 and
37 goals, respectively. But
after those two, there is a big
drop to freshmen Creg
Gamble and Grant Stanley
who are next in line with
twenty goals apiece.

To conquer the Bears, Stan
ford will not only need a few
more scores, but also a super
lative defensive effort because
California's style of play
resembles that of UCLA - a
team that has downed the Car

dinal 13-7 and 14-6.
"Cal uses 14 to 16 players a
game like UCLA and that
worries me," the Stanford
mentor commented, "There's
not a drop off in talent. I may
counter that with our sub
stitutes.
"They put a lot of pressure
on defensively," he added,
"and that's one advantage of
substituting a lot of people."
The Bears boast a cohesive
blend of freshmen and under
classmen as well as two potent
scorers in Alan Gresham and
Pete Cutino, the coach's son.
According to Dettamanti,
one of the reasons for Cal's
success is that California had
the best recruiting year of any
school except Stanford last
year. He also offered a reason.
"Every guy that didn't get into
Stanford goes to Berkeley."
But the Cardinal will have to
stop Cresham and Cutino and
take a chance that the rest of
Cal's small army won't launch
a successful attack.
With the NCAA tourney two
weeks away, there is always
the possibility that Stanford
may catch California dreaming
about their future glory, but
Dettamanti downplays the dis
traction of the national finals.
"This is like Big Game in
football," he noted, "I don't
think they'll be looking past
us."

Greg Gamble, who has scored 20 goals this season, will be called upon to perform again
when the water polo team travels to meet rival No.l UC-Berkeley tomorrow. The Card now
holds a record of 11-11-3.
