## Roth's 'The Anatomy Lesson' written for writers 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
"The Anatomy Lesson," by
Philip Roth, Farrar, Straus
and Giroux, 291 pp., $14.95.
"The Anatomy Lesson"
completes the trilogy of
novels that Philip Roth has
centered on the career of Nath
an Zuckerman, a jewish
writer whose experiences are
not unlike those of Roth him
self.
The author has focussed
each novel of the trilogy on
Zuckerman's evolving feelings
about his work, and has made
these feelings so vivid and im
mediate that the reader tends
to adopt them himself. Zuck
erman's attitude to the
writer's trade thus finds a
double in the reader's attitude
to the novel. In "The Anatomy

'Let the others
write the books.
Leave the fate of
literature in their
good hands and
relinquish life
alone in your
room. It isn't life
and it isn't you.
It's ten talons
clawing at
twenty-six letters.
Some animal car
rying on in the
zoo like that and
you'd think it was
horrifying.'

Lesson," the result ot this is
less agreeable than in the first
two installments of the series.
The eager anticipation of
the young Zuckerman, as he
set out on his career in "The
Ghost Writer," enlivened that
book and earned a large store
of sympathy for the character.
"Zuckerman Unbound"
Ccrlled on that reserve, though
/uckerman himself did not
become unsympathetic in his

chagrin and bewilderment at
the reception of his bestsell
ing novel, "Carnovsky," a
book with obvious likenesses
to Roth's own "Portnoy's
Complaint." The attention to
Zuckerman's "plight" as a
writer in the second novel did
not seem self-obsessed, be
cause his difficulties involved
fhe effect of his writing on his
dealings with other people, so
that "Zuckerman Unbound"

was still more about relation
ships between persons than
the writer's relationship to
himself and his work. The lat
ter theme expands to occupy
almost all of "The Anatomy
Lesson," and makes it, unfor
tunately, something of a spe
cialist's book.
The story picks up four
years after the end of
"/uckerman Unbound."
Then, readers' confusions

over the distinction between
Art and Life had gone so far
that his father's last word to
Zuckerman was "Bastard,"
and Zuckerman's brother
refused to have anything more
to do with him.
In the hiatus before "The
Anatomy Lesson" begins,
Zuckerman's mother dies,
leaving him without any con
nections to the world of his
youth that had (provided the

subject matter of his work, as
well as the energy that
brought him to write.
"Zuckerman had lost his
subject.... What he'd made his
fiction from was gone." The
material he could dominate
and to which his feelings had
been enslaved had ended."
But Zuckerman's failure to
write anything in the four
years since "Carnovsky"
doesn't just bring him to wor
rying about the peculiar
causes of his own block. If that
were the case, "The Anatomy
Lesson" would be just an un
interesting story of self
obsession. It retains a claim on
the literate reader's attention
because Zuckerman's agoniz
ing is about the conditions of
writing in general, examining
them to see whether his desire
to write makes any sense at all.
These meditations are tied
into the plot by having Zucker
man compare the trades of
writing and medicine. He's
been suffering chronic pain of

the neck and shoulders for 18
months, and as a result he's
been exposed to enough doc
tors to make him think that
their work is more purposeful
and satisfying than writing, so
he should go back to school to

'The most
enviable genius in
literary history is
the guy who in
vented alphabet
soup: nobody
knows who he is.'

Lesson"

become a doctor.
Zuckerman's complaints are
first voiced in conversations
with the four women he has
somehow collected as a sort of

harem-on-call in New York.
(Or is four women too tew for
a harem? I can't make up mv
mind.)
"What if twenty years of
writing has just been so much
helplessness before a compul
sion — submission to a lowly,
inconsequential compulsion
that I've dignified with all mv
principles." If this is true, then
there is no prospect that the
pain of composition will ever
be useful to anyone, even
Zuckerman. He despairs of
turning his excruciatingly diffi
cult work into "a martyrdom
more to the point — some
point, any point — than
bearing the cocktail party
chitchat as a guest of Dick
Cavett." Zuckerman is en
vious of the purposefulness of
medicine. He is also per
suaded that it has none of fic -
tion writing's trauma, based
on the apparent complacency
of the doctors who have failed

to cure him of his mysterious
pain.
Zuckerman believes that,
unlike a doctor, "A good
writer can't abandon his char
acter's suffering ... A writer
learns to stay around, has to,
in order to chart the turnings
of the punishing unknown
even when there's no sense to
be made."
Halfway through the novel,
Zuckerman finally does gather
his misguided courage, and
flies to Chicago to apply for
admission to medical school
there. He hopes to benefit
from the help of his old
roommate Bobby, now on the
faculty. In additon to his talks
with him, Zuckerman ends up
getting a close view of a doc
tor's work when he injures
himself in a drugs-and-booze
stupor, and is hospitalized for
several weeks.
The difficulties of the
profession begin to unfold:
"The big problem for me in
dealing with patients is getting
someone out of a difficult sit
uation over a period of time.
Down here in emergency we
just light the fuse and run . . .
But ... up on the floors . . .
You've got to watch them die
without falling apart. I can't do
that." But even after seeing
the sense of futility that is as
much a part of medicine as of
writing, Zuckerman ends the
book still hoping to become a
doctor.

Roth doesn't let his charac
ter analyze it down to a set of
explicit observations, but
there seem to be two clear dif
ferences between writing and
medicine, that make doctor-

'If you were to
watch some cer
tified madman
groaning over a
table in his little
cell, observe him
trying to make
something sen
sible out of qwer
tyuiop, asdfghjkl,
and zxcvbnm, see
him engrossed to
the exlusion of all
else by three such
nonsensical
words„ you'd be
appalled/

Lesson"

ing appeal to Zuckerman.
Both doctors and writers
sometimes face insur
mountable problems, and
both can doubt the utility of
their work (at least in the long
run).

But doctors treat live
patients, not fictional charac
ters. And real people relate
differently to Zuckerman, the
famous novelist; "A book ma
chine is what they see when
they meet me," and they don't
want their lives to be
consumed and turned into fic
tion for others to read. Zuck
erman is struck by the frank
ness with which patients
reveal themselves to the
phvsician.
The trust withheld from
Zuckerman by diffident
friends and family seems to be
the one thing that would make
anv trade, however difficult in
itself, tolerable for him. But
Roth brings this out tardily,
and it is overwhelmed bv the
dramatic characterizations of
the writer's art. Interesting
though these are, they are in
evitably self-centered (on
Zuckerman's part, I mean),
and that emphasis seems to be
the fundamental problem with
"The Anatomy Lesson."
The first two novels in the
series involved much more
substantial encounters be
tween Zuckerman and charac
ters who had lives indepen
dent of his. In "The Anatomy
Lesson," even Zuckerman has
become a sort of sounding
board. His hero may be
unable to establish bonds of
trust and affection with
others, and be "Chained to
self-consciousness. Chained
to retrosepction," but Roth
could have demonstrated this
more engagingly if he hadn't
shackled the reader to him so
inseparably.
