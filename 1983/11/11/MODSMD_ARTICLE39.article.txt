## Roth's 'The Anatomy Lesson' written for writers 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
"The Anatomy Lesson," by
Philip Roth, Farrar, Straus
and Giroux, 291 pp., $14.95.
"The Anatomy Lesson"
completes the trilogy of
novels that Philip Roth has
centered on the career of Nath
an Zuckerman, a jewish
writer whose experiences are
not unlike those of Roth him
self.
The author has focussed
each novel of the trilogy on
Zuckerman's evolving feelings
about his work, and has made
these feelings so vivid and im
mediate that the reader tends
to adopt them himself. Zuck
erman's attitude to the
writer's trade thus finds a
double in the reader's attitude
to the novel. In "The Anatomy

'Let the others
write the books.
Leave the fate of
literature in their
good hands and
relinquish life
alone in your
room. It isn't life
and it isn't you.
It's ten talons
clawing at
twenty-six letters.
Some animal car
rying on in the
zoo like that and
you'd think it was
horrifying.'

Lesson," the result ot this is
less agreeable than in the first
two installments of the series.
The eager anticipation of
the young Zuckerman, as he
set out on his career in "The
Ghost Writer," enlivened that
book and earned a large store
of sympathy for the character.
"Zuckerman Unbound"
Ccrlled on that reserve, though
/uckerman himself did not
become unsympathetic in his

chagrin and bewilderment at
the reception of his bestsell
ing novel, "Carnovsky," a
book with obvious likenesses
to Roth's own "Portnoy's
Complaint." The attention to
Zuckerman's "plight" as a
writer in the second novel did
not seem self-obsessed, be
cause his difficulties involved
fhe effect of his writing on his
dealings with other people, so
that "Zuckerman Unbound"

was still more about relation
ships between persons than
the writer's relationship to
himself and his work. The lat
ter theme expands to occupy
almost all of "The Anatomy
Lesson," and makes it, unfor
tunately, something of a spe
cialist's book.
The story picks up four
years after the end of
"/uckerman Unbound."
Then, readers' confusions

over the distinction between
Art and Life had gone so far
that his father's last word to
Zuckerman was "Bastard,"
and Zuckerman's brother
refused to have anything more
to do with him.
In the hiatus before "The
Anatomy Lesson" begins,
Zuckerman's mother dies,
leaving him without any con
nections to the world of his
youth that had (provided the

subject matter of his work, as
well as the energy that
brought him to write.
"Zuckerman had lost his
subject.... What he'd made his
fiction from was gone." The
material he could dominate
and to which his feelings had
been enslaved had ended."
But Zuckerman's failure to
write anything in the four
years since "Carnovsky"
doesn't just bring him to wor
rying about the peculiar
causes of his own block. If that
were the case, "The Anatomy
Lesson" would be just an un
interesting story of self
obsession. It retains a claim on
the literate reader's attention
because Zuckerman's agoniz
ing is about the conditions of
writing in general, examining
them to see whether his desire
to write makes any sense at all.
These meditations are tied
into the plot by having Zucker
man compare the trades of
writing and medicine. He's
been suffering chronic pain of

the neck and shoulders for 18
months, and as a result he's
been exposed to enough doc
tors to make him think that
their work is more purposeful
and satisfying than writing, so
he should go back to school to

enviable genius in

become a doctor.
Zuckerman's complaints are
first voiced in conversations
with the four women he has
somehow collected as a sort of

harem-on-call in New York.
(Or is four women too tew for
a harem? I can't make up mv
mind.)
"What if twenty years of
writing has just been so much
helplessness before a compul
sion — submission to a lowly,
inconsequential compulsion
that I've dignified with all mv
principles." If this is true, then
there is no prospect that the
pain of composition will ever
be useful to anyone, even
Zuckerman. He despairs of
turning his excruciatingly diffi
cult work into "a martyrdom
more to the point — some
point, any point — than
bearing the cocktail party
chitchat as a guest of Dick
Cavett." Zuckerman is en
vious of the purposefulness of
medicine. He is also per
suaded that it has none of fic -
tion writing's trauma, based
on the apparent complacency
of the doctors who have failed
