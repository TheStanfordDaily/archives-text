Holt, Rinehart and Winston are now
the distributors ot the Hashmaps guide
series, which includes a new guide to
Los Angeles (with extra information for
the Olympics), and a reused guide to
San Francisco. The series' concept is to
provide single-subject maps, e.g.,
shops around Union Square, so you
can locate the one you've chosen with
out being distracted by other informa
tion. Most of the maps will only give
you a general sense of location, and
need to be supplemented by a normal
street map. Since the listings contain
minimal information about the items
charted (besides their locations), the
guides offer little help in choosing

which store, restuarant, or nightspot
you may want to visit.
The indexing of certain subjects,

more than the maps themselves, is the
asset of the series. Things are covered
that you couldn't find so easily else
where, and some of the more unusual
subjects suggest novel outings. The list
of libraries is sensible, but what do the
indexes and maps of San Francisco
statuary, Victorian houses or Sonoma
farms bring to mind? What other guide
gives you the lowdown on where you
can buy specialty produce from the
grower, or reserve a Christmas tree in
November for cutting in December? At
$i.95 each, the guides are a practical
addition to your glove compartment.
"Was It Good for You, Too?: Quota
tions on Love and Sex," edited by Bob
Chieger (Atheneum, 258 pp., indexed,
$8.95) actually covers a lot more topics
than its title suggests. Though
dominated by humorous citations, the
wit is not always of the jolliest sort.
