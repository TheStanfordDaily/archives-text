## Sonoma County: Isis Oasis, geysers and wine 
### CATHY JANUS 
)ust off Highway 101, 80
niles north of San Francisco,
he Russian River area of
ionoma County offers variety
[>t scenery as well as wine. Its
[oiling hills covered with
erape vines, its mountains,
find redwoods have made it a
popular resort area for over a
Century.
In the midst of this natural
beauty you can catch a
glimpse of another lifestyle.

Geyserville, a town as yet un
spoiled by tourist travel, is
easy to miss (it is only one
block long), but the range of
activities people come to the
area to enjoy are not.
The area is popular for
canoeing, bicycling, hiking
and most of all for wine
tasting. Or, if you took Petro
leum Engineering 103, you
may associate the area with
the geysers, once a famous
tourist attraction and now

tapped for use by PG&E.
The Russian River Wine
Road is a mecca for wine en
thusiasts, with more than 40
wineries within bicycling or
driving distance. Complimen
tary maps of the wineries, ac
commodations and items of in
terest are available to help
travelers find their way.
Just south of Geyserville is
Souverain Winery. I especially
recommend this winery to
anyone interested in seeing

the winemaking process first
hand. Tours explaining the
process of winemaking, ap
proximately 20 minutes in
length, are given every hour
on the hour. Afterwards, you
can sample Souverain's
premium wines or choose to
eat lunch or dinner there.
If you are hungry, but prefer
to picnic, most of the wineries
have nice picnic areas. If you
want a really nice spot for pic
nicking, Hop Kiln Winery has a
small lake, old historic build
ings, tables and a lawn.
Geyser Peak Winery, fa
mous for its Summit Wine-in
a-Box and their latest idea,
wine packaged in aluminum
cans, also offers premium
wines for tasting, a picnic area
overlooking the valley and two
hiking trails; one is approxi
mately 15 minutes while the
other is longer.
The leaves on the grape
vines and many of the trees
are changing colors about
now, making the area espe
cially beautiful in autumn.
I stayed at the Isis Oasis
Lodge, as exotic as the name
implies, and as peaceful. Ar
riving Friday evening, we
drove right by the lodge
before seeing the sign for it.
Already past it, we decided to
investigate the town of
Geyserville before turning
around. Five seconds later, we
realized we'd seen all of the
town. Main Street consists of a
deli, a restaurant, Mickey's
Fountain, the Bank of America
and a few bed and breakfast
inns.
Except for the Bank of
America, the street has an ear
ly 1900s aura. Though small,
the town is worth visiting not

only because of the wineries
surrounding it, but because
Catelli's the Rex, the only res
taurant, specializes in home
cooked, old-style Italian food.
Returning to the lodge, we
were greeted by the caretaker
and shown to our rooms. She
told us to make use of the spa
and hot tub (there is also a
pool, but that is not heated)
and to join the other guests
for wine tasting later in the
evening. She left after giving
us a complimentary bottle of
Winterchill wine from Nervo
Winery.
Lora Vigne, the owner, is in
terested in Egypt and both the
decor and many of the events
at the lodge reflect her inter
est and creativity. The name
Isis is from the Egyptian
goddess of nature. Besides
being a bed and breakfast
resort, the lodge is a cultural
center. On Friday and Satur
day evenings, there is a

dinner-theatre. Attendance to
the dinner and performances
are not limited to guests; plays
are performed by local
amateurs as well as such
troops as the Hollywood Ac
tors Theatre or the Theatre
Ballet of San Francisco.
Staying at the Isis Oasis
Lodge was an experience in it
self. There is a lounge with a
fireplace, a pond with ducks
and geese, lawns surrounding
a glass-enclosed dining area
and a miniature zoo. At break
fast (a sumptuous meal of
blueberry pancakes, eggs and
fruit), we sat and watched the
playful antics of one of Lora's
baby ocelots.
The Isis Oasis' past is an in
teresting as its present. A
Bavarian wine-maker built a
house at the turn-of-the
century. Next to the house is a
tree almost 500 years old.
Bosch, the owner, became in
terested in Bahai', a philoso

phy originating in Persia.
The Bahai' philosophy
believes all religions, as
messages from God, are valid,
said Lora. As a follower, Bosch
had to give up drinking. He
pulled up his grape vines and
planted prune-plums.
When Lora bought the eight
and a half acres three years
ago, she only had to build the
dining area. She was able to
use Bosch's house, the
theater, and the communal
house. She turned the com
munal house into private
rooms on the first floor and
the second floor became a
game room and sleeping area
for groups.
Single rooms cost $35.00 per
night and doubles are $47.00.
Lora offers special group rates
according to the situation. It is
possible to rent the entire
lodge and/or the theater.
The Isis Oasis is located at
20889 Geyserville Ave.

told us to make use of the spa
and hot tub (there is also a
pool, but that is not heated)
and to join the other guests
for wine tasting later in the
evening. She left after giving
us a complimentary bottle of
Winterchill wine from Nervo
Winery.
Lora Vigne, the owner, is in
terested in Egypt and both the
decor and many of the events
at the lodge reflect her inter
est and creativity. The name
Isis is from the Egyptian
goddess of nature. Besides
being a bed and breakfast
resort, the lodge is a cultural
center. On Friday and Satur
day evenings, there is a

dinner-theatre. Attendance to
the dinner and performances
are not limited to guests; plays
are performed by local
amateurs as well as such
troops as the Hollywood Ac
tors Theatre or the Theatre
Ballet of San Francisco.
Staying at the Isis Oasis
Lodge was an experience in it
self. There is a lounge with a
fireplace, a pond with ducks
and geese, lawns surrounding
a glass-enclosed dining area
and a miniature zoo. At break
fast (a sumptuous meal of
blueberry pancakes, eggs and
fruit), we sat and watched the
playful antics of one of Lora's
baby ocelots.
The Isis Oasis' past is an in
teresting as its present. A
Bavarian wine-maker built a
house at the turn-of-the
century. Next to the house is a
tree almost 500 years old.
Bosch, the owner, became in
terested in Bahai', a philoso

phy originating in Persia.
The Bahai' philosophy
believes all religions, as
messages from God, are valid,
said Lora. As a follower, Bosch
had to give up drinking. He
pulled up his grape vines and
planted prune-plums.
When Lora bought the eight
and a half acres three years
ago, she only had to build the
dining area. She was able to
use Bosch's house, the
theater, and the communal
house. She turned the com
munal house into private
rooms on the first floor and
the second floor became a
game room and sleeping area
for groups.
Single rooms cost $35.00 per
night and doubles are $47.00.
Lora offers special group rates
according to the situation. It is
possible to rent the entire
lodge and/or the theater.
The Isis Oasis is located at
20889 Geyserville Ave.

)ust off Highway 101, 80
niles north of San Francisco,
he Russian River area of
ionoma County offers variety
[>t scenery as well as wine. Its
[oiling hills covered with
erape vines, its mountains,
find redwoods have made it a
popular resort area for over a
Century.
In the midst of this natural
beauty you can catch a
glimpse of another lifestyle.

Geyserville, a town as yet un
spoiled by tourist travel, is
easy to miss (it is only one
block long), but the range of
activities people come to the
area to enjoy are not.
The area is popular for
canoeing, bicycling, hiking
and most of all for wine
tasting. Or, if you took Petro
leum Engineering 103, you
may associate the area with
the geysers, once a famous
tourist attraction and now

tapped for use by PG&E.
The Russian River Wine
Road is a mecca for wine en
thusiasts, with more than 40
wineries within bicycling or
driving distance. Complimen
tary maps of the wineries, ac
commodations and items of in
terest are available to help
travelers find their way.
Just south of Geyserville is
Souverain Winery. I especially
recommend this winery to
anyone interested in seeing

the winemaking process first
hand. Tours explaining the
process of winemaking, ap
proximately 20 minutes in
length, are given every hour
on the hour. Afterwards, you
can sample Souverain's
premium wines or choose to
eat lunch or dinner there.
If you are hungry, but prefer
to picnic, most of the wineries
have nice picnic areas. If you
want a really nice spot for pic
nicking, Hop Kiln Winery has a
small lake, old historic build
ings, tables and a lawn.
Geyser Peak Winery, fa
mous for its Summit Wine-in
a-Box and their latest idea,
wine packaged in aluminum
cans, also offers premium
wines for tasting, a picnic area
overlooking the valley and two
hiking trails; one is approxi
mately 15 minutes while the
other is longer.
The leaves on the grape
vines and many of the trees
are changing colors about
now, making the area espe
cially beautiful in autumn.
I stayed at the Isis Oasis
Lodge, as exotic as the name
implies, and as peaceful. Ar
riving Friday evening, we
drove right by the lodge
before seeing the sign for it.
Already past it, we decided to
investigate the town of
Geyserville before turning
around. Five seconds later, we
realized we'd seen all of the
town. Main Street consists of a
deli, a restaurant, Mickey's
Fountain, the Bank of America
and a few bed and breakfast
inns.
Except for the Bank of
America, the street has an ear
ly 1900s aura. Though small,
the town is worth visiting not

only because of the wineries
surrounding it, but because
Catelli's the Rex, the only res
taurant, specializes in home
cooked, old-style Italian food.
Returning to the lodge, we
were greeted by the caretaker
and shown to our rooms. She

and hot tub (there is also a
