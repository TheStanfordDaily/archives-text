A squat penguin of a man
walked out on the Memorial
Auditorium stage last Monday
night, sat down, adjusted his
seat, unfolded his tootstand,
tuned his guitar, acknowledged
his audience, and delivered a
solid but lackluster recital on his
Romanillos guitar.
It would have passed by as
an uneventful recital had the
performer been someone
other than classical guitar
maestro Julian Bream. This
was his first performance at
Stanford and it might well be
his last judging from the lack
of chemistry between Bream
and his audience, and the cool
but respectful applause at the
end of the recital.

I seriously doubt
that his Stanford
recital was what
he would have
chosen or shared
with his intimate
friends, or the
musical circle in
which he moves
in England.

He only occasionally dis
played the warmth and
vibrancy for which he is so
well known from his
numerous recordings and in
ternational circuit. The first
half of the performance was
plagued by tuning problems, a
few halts, and distracting
mistakes (which the French so
eloquently call a "canard" or
"duck", an expression which
evokes the honking quality of
a sour or missed note).
He opened with three

transcriptions of Sylvius
Leopold Weiss (1686-1750),
who composed notable pieces
for the lute in the Baroque
period. The opening Capriccio
was shaky. He seemed to have
difficulty concentrating and
lost his place once (which he
adroitly recovered from with
an interesting improvised
modulation, which didn't
seem to have attracted the au
dience's attention).
The "Tombeau sur la mort
de Comte de Logy", a beauti
fully sad and atypically lyrical
piece for the period (which
Bream has masterfully re
corded) was a bit slow. The
mordents upon which the
piece so heavily draws (a mor
dent is a sort of short reverse
trill) were muffled by
Memorial Auditorium's acous
tics. It didn't have his record
ing's "buttery" and
melancholic quality, although
the adagio was solid and ex
pressive. To compensate for
the slowness of the previous
piece, Bream attacked the Fan
tasia, which was played too
fast, blurring his usually crisp
musical ideas.
This first section was fol
lowed by Fernando Sor's
Sonata in D (Gran solo), Opus
14. (Bream also played a Sor
piece following the Baroque
opening last year at his Davies
concert in San Francisco). He
slowed down the tempo quite
a bit for this number
(seemingly compensating for
the excessively rapid tempo of
the previous piece), and con
sequently the music dragged a
bit at first, but picked up
during the fast movement.
The first half of the recital
didn't really pick up until
Frederico Mompou's Suite
Compostelana — a favorite of
Bream and Segovia. He hit the
mood right off, and the piece
was much surer and eloquent.
He had obviously felt much
more comfortable with the
more modern Spanish style

that mght. The bass notes
\sere resonant, reedy, and he
captured the occasionally
moods and pensive atmo
sphere tin Recitativeo) and the
lilting jig-like teel ot the tinal
movement Muneira.
Five Bagatelles (1971) by
William Walton (1903-1983)
opened the second halt ot the
recital. Five Bagatelles was
personally commissioned by
Bream. It is a piece that Bream
teels verv comfortable with,
having recorded it several
times. The suite was generally
solid, and captured the
whimsical nature ot the music
beautifully, although he still
made a tew distracting
mistakes in the upper register.
The section entitled Four
Etudes by the tamous Brazilian
composer Heitor Villa-Lobos
(1887-1959) was selected from
a series of twelve etudes —
which had originally been
written for Andres Segovia,
but has since then quickly
become a staple for the classi
cal guitar student wishing to
improve his technique and the
concert guitarist, to display his
virtuosity.
These etudes have a cello
like quality; Villa-Lobos had
started out on the cello and
consequently his guitar pieces
abound in "cellistic" idioms.
Bream played his favorite
studies, numbers five and
seven, the number eleven,
and the last study, which has
become so prominent these
days in guitar repertoires; this
piece dramatically displays
sets of glissando chords and
rhythmical bass "drome"
notes.
Bream closed his planned
recital with an all-time favorite
of his, Enrique Grandos' (1867-
1916) Valse Poeticos. Bream
displayed some of his most
lyrical moods in his two
encores — a mazurka by Villa-
Lobos, and a lesser known
piece. But, as I stated above,
the audience's response was

luke-warm at best, bringing
only a few afficionados of his
to their feet.
I understand that personal
reactions are necessarily sub
jective at best, and that my
criticisms of this musical giant
(and institution) will seem un
duly harsh to those who
enjoyed the concert. I do,
however, play the classical
guitar with some proficiency
(having once vacillated be

tween a career in music and
literature), and have heard
most of Bream's repertoire
many times before — making
me perhaps a little more blase
than the usual concert-goer. I
would have outrightlv panned
the recital (which would have
been quite acceptable tor a
performer of lesser caliber)
had I not read Tony Palmer's
intimate and revealing biog
raphy of Julian Bream's con
cert career (Palmer toured
with Bream along with
photographer Daniel
Meadows during the prepara
tion of his book), and had I
not talked with the maestro
backstage and his small but
awe-struck flock of Bay Area
guitarists and former students
of his.
Backstage, through a maze
of desuete props and kaf
kaesque rooms, the commer
cial artist (because that is what
he has become to so many
concert halls — being more in
terested in revenue and stan
dard repertoire pieces which
draw "culture vulture"
crowds — than what is gener
ally known as "artistic in
tegrity") dropped his usual
concert rictus, stepping down
from his pedestal, and into the
more fragile and human self
that is so seldom conveyed in
his American tours with their
over-booked , multi-purpose
(and acoustically scandalous)
concert halls. A classical guitar
should be ideally an intense,
intimate experience, involving
both artist and audience,
rather than what it is all to of
ten today, marred by the mec
hanics and tribulations of life
on the road. As a performing
instrument, the classical guitar
is much more suited to a
chapel than a hangar of a con
cert hall.
In his dressing room back
stage after the concert, his
body still hunched over and
molded to the shape of his in
strument, Bream stood clutch

ing a hastily lit cigarette —
which seemed incongruous in
his enormously muscular
hand resembling more a gar
dener's hands than the usual
pink, sausage-like fingers of
many other performers.
Presiding ceremoniously
before his usual procession of
autograph seekers, and sur
rounded by an eager retinue
of guitarists from the Bay Area,
Bream nonchalantly acknowl

edged the usual eulogies:
"Superb concert." "The
sound carried all the way to
the back of the hall." But he
answered the more personal

What Bream has to say can't be said in words, but if you
listen carefully you will sense it in your bones. There are
no keys, springs or contraptions between the player and
his guitar.

and well-meaning questions
of the local guitarists who had
flocked from all corners of the
Bay. One former student pre
sented him with a composi
tion. Another slipped Bream
his address just in case he
would care to sell him an old
instrument of his that he
planned to retire. He was
asked what he thought of so
and so. "Marvelous player."
Whether he had any new
pieces in the making.
"Nothing in particular."
Bream is not a composer in his
own right, although he has
contributed immensely to the
repertoire of the modern
guitar through numerous
transcriptions and commis
sions from other composers.
He was not talkative, and
kept his replies to the neces
sary minimum. Then the inevi
table question was popped to
him: "Mr. Bream, will you
consider giving another
master class in the near
future?" The answer was a
politely evasive, but an un
equivocal, "No. Not in the
near future in any case,"
much to their disappointment.
Bream rarely holds master
classes in the States, for some
unknown reason. He is basi
cally a loner when on tour
here, preferring to reserve his
teaching for when he returns
to Great Britain. He books his
own concerts, carries his

luggage, rents the car at the
airport, drives himself to the
concert, and occasionally
leaves alone, a solitary figure
making his way in the dark of
the night.
There is still no doubt in my
mind that Bream will be
remembered as one of the
great artists of our time. Along
with Segovia he has raised the
status of the classical guitar
from a musical toy to an in
strument with soul. It is an in
timate instrument, one that is
literally a projection of one's
lifestyle. What Bream has to
say can't be said in words, but
if you listen carefully you will
sense it in your bones. There
are no keys, springs or con
traptions between the player
and his guitar.
There is a tactile and ephem
erally pleasurable quality
in playing the guitar. You
grasp the instrument with
both hands, and it takes two
hands to coax a note out of it.
Not very efficient, but intense
ly personal — a quality which

is totally lost, engulfed in the
impersonal consumerism of
today's concerts.
When he goes on tour, he
usually leaves his lute in En
gland. He is a man of two per
sonalities: a private musician
and an international per
former. He has two manners
of dressing: informally, in his
old comfortable clothes for his
country home in England, and
what he calls his "penguin"
outfit — a black formal con
cert get-up, replete with tails
and starchy white shirt.
This separation of musical
self is quite conscious on
Bream's part. He understands
that the commercial aspect of
the concert artists' enterprise
colors the quality of his
playing, and in turn, his audi
ence's response to the way he
interprets his pieces, and
plans his recital menu.
I seriously doubt that his
Stanford recital was what he
would have chosen or shared
with his intimate friends, or
the musical circle in which he
moves in England. In like man
ner, Bream admits to feeling
more willing to give his all for
an audience which ap
preciates and responds to his
playing. He is acutely sensitive
to the interaction, the give
and-take, between performer
and audience. For example,
he prefers playing in New
York City, where he has an en

thusiastic following, than in a
large and impersonal concert
hall. He is concerned enough,
however, not to shirk the re
sponsibilities of the classical
artist to broaden his base of
followers.
Bream's enormous output
of recordings attests to his
concern with these problems.
The quality of these record
ings is proof enough. What
Bream feels is often lacking in
audience response these days,
is an affinity to the "pleasure
principle" involved in playing
the classical guitar (or any
other instrument, for that mat
ter). For him, the important
thing is the pleasure he gets
when he shares his music with
others. We tend to overintel
lectualize the muscial experi
ence, to forget the pleasure in
music-making.
Concert-goers are all mem
bers of a musical club, and I
ask, where does the responsi
bility of the musical experi
ence squarely lie?

Bream certainly is in the
business for the pleasure and
the love of it. Backstage, I
sensed an earthy, pagan wis
dom in Bream's manner of
being. His accent is coarsely
British, somewhat roguish —
in the most positive sense —
and he certainly has more to
offer us than what he served at
Stanford. Playing the guitar is
his way of speaking to the
world, of being a quieting and
enchanting influence in our
increasingly impersonal and
violent world.
Playing, for Bream, is simply
his way of bringing audience
and performer together in the
musical experience: "The
basic thing about playing the
guitar is the pleasure you get
from it. There is nothing
wrong with pleasure, is there?
There are so many awful
things going on in this world,
every second of the day, that
perhaps playing the guitar is
one of the more harmless ac
tivities. That just about sums it
all up. Nothing more compl
icated than that. If Mr. Reagan
and Mr. Brehznev, two rather
dreary men, played the guitar
for a bit of relaxation, and
once a year gave a duet con
cert for the benefit of the
United Nations, perhaps the
world would be a little more
peaceful, a little more
enchanting. Know what I
mean?"
