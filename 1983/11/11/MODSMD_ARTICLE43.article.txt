The T.A.M.I. Show (1965)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A super-deluxe edition of an
American Bandstand-type TV
show, this rock 'n' roll revue
from the British Inva
sion/Motown era is an invalua
ble period piece, down to
David Winters' go-go choreog
raphy. The director, Steve
Binder, doesn't really know
what he's doing, and the most
monotonous performers —
Gerry and the Pacemakers,
with their curdled-nice-guy
style (Gerry is like a junior ver
sion of Tommy Steele), and
Lesley Gore, Queen of the
J.A.P.s (teenybopper division)
— are permitted to go through
their entire, repetitive reper
toires. But how can you com
plain about even an extremely
bad movie that has Smokey
Robinson and the Miracles
(performing the unforgettable
"You Really Got a Hold on
Me"), Marvin Gaye, James
Brown and The Rolling Stones?
Even at this early stage in their
careers, the Stones look dis
reputable, and Mick Jagger has
already developed his tech
nique of pulling back from the
audience, lapsing into a brood
ing introspection, and erupt
ing — he's hypnotic. With The
Supremes, The Beach Boys,
Jan and Dean and Billy J.
Kramer.
Plays Wednesday evening
with Don't Look Back.

The Lords of Discipline
(1983)
Memorial Auditorium
David Keith's great natural
charm is on display in this very
square adaptation of Pat Con
roy's overwritten but effective
novel about going through hell
in a military academy. Conroy
had attended military school
himself and seemed to be con
fronting his own pain and em
barrassment in the book, but
somehow nothing feels aut
hentic in the film, which was
scripted by Thomas Pope and
Lloyd Fonvielle and directed by
Franc Roddam. We are intro
duced to a couple of talented
young actors, however: John
Lavachielli and Ross Rossovich
as Keith's roommates.
Plays Sunday evening.
Satyricon (1970)
Terman Auditorium
We'd know it was Fellini
even if he hadn't shoved his
name into the title where

Petronius' ought to be. By the
time Fellini made this paean to
the grotesque, some of us had
already given up on him;
others saw this appallingly
overproduced parade of
(mostly unmemorable) deca
dent imagery as evidence of a
superior sensibility. Aside
from Danilo Donati's produc
tion design, this long, boring,
occasionally sickening movie
has nothing to recommend it.
With Max Born, Martin Potter,
Hiram Keller, and appearances
by Capucine, Alain Cuny and
Lucia Bose; Bernardino Zap
poni worked on the script with
Fellini.
Plays Tuesday evening.
To Sir with Love (1967)
Kresge Auditorium
In this sugary movie, written
and directed by James Clavell
(out of a novel by
E.R.Braithwaite), Sidney Poitier
plays a teacher who singlehand
edly reforms a classroom full

of tough cases in a slum school
by teaching them good man
ners. Those who aren't con
vinced that an ignorance of
etiquette is at the root of soci
ety's troubles may giggle un
controllably when chub
by-cheeked Lulu sings the
title song: "But how do you
thank someone/Who has taken
you from crayons to
perfume?" Poitier does all he
can, but it isn't enough. With
Christian Roberts, Judy
Geeson and Suzy Kendall.
Plays tonight.
Strangers on a Train (1951)
Festival, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's movie
has a tantalizingly clever prem
ise: on a train, Guy (Farley
Granger) meets Bruno (Robert
Walker), who promises to
eliminate Guy's troublesome
wife if, in return, Guy will kill
Bruno's father. (Bruno calls

this strategy "criss-cross mur
ders.") Working from Patricia
Highsmith's novel, Raymond
Chandler and Czenzi Or
monde provided Hitchcock
with a witty, beautifully calcu
lated screenplay, and Robert
Walker's malignantly charming
Bruno is among the two or
three best performances
Hitchcock ever directed. It's a
marvelous movie, assembled
with true mastery. Hitchcock
puts the two most suspenseful
sequences back to back: the
tennis match and the merry
go-round climax. With Ruth
Roman, Leo G. Carroll, Patricia
Hitchcock, Marion Lome,
Howard St. John and Laura El
liott.
Plays through Wednesday
with The Lady Vanishes. M

Soldier of Orange (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rutger Hauer, with his
panache and his Paul Newman
eyes, plays Eric, the Dutch
hero of Paul Verhoeven's
rousing World War II spy thril
ler. Eric and his friends are ar
rogant, courageous, and full of
audacious, gentlemanly
flourishes (like riding motor
cycles in their tuxedos); they
remind one of the slightly
preposterous — and greatly
appealing — flair of many of
the characters Errol Flynn used
to play. On paper, the material
probably looked fairly conven
tional, but Verhoeven lends it
a gentle, wry, lightly nostalgic

tone; it's a smashingly well di
rected movie (and the period
reconstructions are lovely).
The cast includes leroen
Krabbe, Belinda Meuldijk,
Susan Penhaligon and Edward
Fox. The movie's source was
Erik Hazelhoff's autobiogra
phy.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Das Boot.
Simon of the Desert (1968)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A coffin rolls across a desert
of its own volition; a man
stands on a tower, hands out
stretched, while a dust storm
blows around him — this
short, blasphemous satire by
Luis Bunuel sometimes
resembles a series of Magritte
paintings. Besides being one
of his most visually interesting
movies, it is one of his fun
niest. Claudio Brook plays a
rather dull, distracted ascetic
who is tempted by the Devil
(Sylvia Pinal) and finally told,
"Your unselfishness is ad
mirable, but like your
abstinence, it's of little value to
man."
Plays Monday evening with
The Exterminating Angel and
Un Chien Andalou.

Un Chien Andaiou (1928)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Luis Bunuel made his debut
in collaboration with Salvador
Dali. (They teamed again two
years later on L'Age d'Or.) In it,
he managed not only to find a
unique style, but also to
achieve one of the key succes
scandales of our century, and
moreover to align himself with
one of its most important
movements, surrealism. The
use of the medium to effect
the odd, jarring juxtapositions
Dali was already creating on
canvas disturbed and dis
oriented audiences as much as
the violence and horror of the
two most celebrated images
(the slashing of the eyeball, the
maggots eating away at a living
man's hand). But the greatest
shock in the" film was how
funny it was — filmgoers didn't
know how to respond to the
kind of renegade wit that could
first conceive of an image of al
most primal horror and disgust
and then laugh at it. With
Pierre Catcheff, Simone
Mareuil, Jaime Miravilles,
Bunuel as the man wielding
the razor, and Dali as the
priest.
Plays Monday with The Exter
minating Angel and Simon of
the Desert.
