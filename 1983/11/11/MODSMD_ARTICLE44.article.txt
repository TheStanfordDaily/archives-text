We're tired
There's an Unhappy Hour at Hea
ther's today.The unfun all takes
place in the Potter House lobby at
5:00.

But we're ready
Sunday morning, in a warm-up for
next Saturday's Ink Bowl, the Daily
will take on the ASSU in a football
match at Roble Field at 11:00 Sun
day. Be there. And no, I will not say
"aloha."
