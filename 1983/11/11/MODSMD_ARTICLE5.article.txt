## Faculty Senate keeps press out 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Senior staff writer 
The faculty Senate yesterday
voted 2.. 1 to 17 to reject a proposal
that would open the senate's bi
weekly meetings to off-campus
news coverage.
The senate also voted to increase
the number of Medical School rep
resentatives by two.
Discussion about the latest
developments in the Reagan library
complex was deferred until the next
Faculty Senate meeting in Decem
ber because University President
Donald Kennedy and Provost Albert
Hastorf were not present at the
meeting.
Senate Chair Craig Heller told the
senate that an extensive discussion
would not be appropriate until Uni
versity officials had the opportunity
to review a letter Board of Trustees
President William Kimball received
yesterday from White House
Presidential Counselor Edwin
Meese.
In the letter, Meese said that Stan
ford has made President Reagan "an
offer he cannot accept," by insisting
that the University, not the Hoover
Institution, administer any public af
fairs center linked to the proposed
library.
Speaking for Kennedy, who is cur
rently on a brief vacation, Vice
Provost Gerald Lieberman reported
to the senate that Kennedy and Kim
ball have received the letter yester

day, and that the president wanted
to be characterized as "concerned
. . . outraged . . . and . . . non
plussed."
Lieberman said Kennedy had indi
cated that he will report to the sen
ate in the near future, and that Kim
ball will respond to the letter after
he has had a chance to study it in
detail.
Kennedy is "distressed" that
Meese's letter was released to the
press before Kimball had received it,
Lieberman said.
According to Heller, the senate
began to reconsider its media policy
because of a number of requests
from outside press, including the
Palo Alto Weekly.
Media coverage of the senate is
restricted to The Daily, campus
radio station KZSU and Bob Beyers,
the senate's information officer.
In a divided vote, the senate steer
ing committee had recommended
that the remaining meetings in the
current academic year include three
seats for representatves of non-
Stanford news media.
Senate members argued,
however, that the current media
policy is working very well and that
that there was no real reason to
change it.
Members were concerned that in
accurate reporting of senate
proceedings might result if
reporters without extensive experi-
ence with the senate were
allowed to attend the
meetings only sporadically
when important issues are dis
cussed.
A concern that increased
media coverage might inhibit
discussion was also expressed
by the faculty representatives.
Television and photograp
hic coverage of the meetings
is normally not permitted, un
less approved in advance by
the steering committee.
The reapportionment plan
approved by the senate set the
total number of senate repre
sentatives at 53, a number that
could vary by a few seats
depending on charter
mandated minima or a special
apportionment procedure ap

proved by the senate.
The Medical School faculty,
which makes up over 30 per
cent of the Stanford faculty,
will now be represented by 10
faculty senate members.
According to the new reap
portionment plan, devised bv
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody and Operations Re
search Prof. Frederick Hillier,
approximately half of the total
senate seats will be allocated
according to the number of
Academic Council members in
each constituency.
The remaining halt will be
allocated according to the
average of three different
measures of matriculated stu
dents in each of the seven
schools: 1) enrollment in
major programs; 2) degrees
granted in the year preceeding
reapportionment; and 3)

course enrollment units in the
year preceding reaportion
ment.
The Senate currently has 53
voting representatives, includ
ing 25 from the School of
Humanities and Sciences,
nine from Engineering, eight
from Medicine and three rom
Business. The Schools oi Earth
Sciences, Education, and Law
have two representatives
each, while Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center and the
special unit have one each.
The senate rejected one of
the reapportionment plan's
recommendations that reap
portionment be done every 10
years, with an audit conducted
at the end of five years by the
academic secretary and
reviewed by the senate steer
ing committee. At present,
reapportionment is mandated
every five years.

Lieberman said Kennedy had indi
cated that he will report to the sen
ate in the near future, and that Kim
ball will respond to the letter after
he has had a chance to study it in
detail.
Kennedy is "distressed" that
Meese's letter was released to the
press before Kimball had received it,
Lieberman said.
According to Heller, the senate
began to reconsider its media policy
because of a number of requests
from outside press, including the
Palo Alto Weekly.
Media coverage of the senate is
restricted to The Daily, campus
radio station KZSU and Bob Beyers,
the senate's information officer.
In a divided vote, the senate steer
ing committee had recommended
that the remaining meetings in the
current academic year include three
seats for representatves of non-
Stanford news media.
Senate members argued,
however, that the current media
policy is working very well and that
that there was no real reason to
change it.
Members were concerned that in
accurate reporting of senate
proceedings might result if
reporters without extensive experi-
ence with the senate were
allowed to attend the
meetings only sporadically
when important issues are dis
cussed.
A concern that increased
media coverage might inhibit
discussion was also expressed
by the faculty representatives.
Television and photograp
hic coverage of the meetings
is normally not permitted, un
less approved in advance by
the steering committee.
The reapportionment plan
approved by the senate set the
total number of senate repre
sentatives at 53, a number that
could vary by a few seats
depending on charter
mandated minima or a special
apportionment procedure ap

proved by the senate.
The Medical School faculty,
which makes up over 30 per
cent of the Stanford faculty,
will now be represented by 10
faculty senate members.
According to the new reap
portionment plan, devised bv
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody and Operations Re
search Prof. Frederick Hillier,
approximately half of the total
senate seats will be allocated
according to the number of
Academic Council members in
each constituency.
The remaining halt will be
allocated according to the
average of three different
measures of matriculated stu
dents in each of the seven
schools: 1) enrollment in
major programs; 2) degrees
granted in the year preceeding
reapportionment; and 3)

course enrollment units in the
year preceding reaportion
ment.
The Senate currently has 53
voting representatives, includ
ing 25 from the School of
Humanities and Sciences,
nine from Engineering, eight
from Medicine and three rom
Business. The Schools oi Earth
Sciences, Education, and Law
have two representatives
each, while Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center and the
special unit have one each.
The senate rejected one of
the reapportionment plan's
recommendations that reap
portionment be done every 10
years, with an audit conducted
at the end of five years by the
academic secretary and
reviewed by the senate steer
ing committee. At present,
reapportionment is mandated
every five years.
