# San Francisco imposes limits on Big Game rally

With any luck, Stanford students will be able to leave
their hearts in San Francisco next Friday night â€” with
out leaving their band in jail.
Organizers for this year's Big Game rally in the city
have taken out a $1 million insurance policy in
response to a San Francisco Police Department (SFPD)
threat to "arrest the entire Band" unless changes were
made in the annual rally. Last year, a handful of stu
dents were injured at the rally after a car drove into a
crowd of revelers.
The insurance policy will protect the City of San Fran
cisco from any liability, a security deposit will protect
Aquatic Park from damage, and a new rally route con
trolled by fraternity members hired to serve as rally
monitors will protect the city from the students.
Helene Leckman, a member of the Fiesta Committee,
the student-run group that plans the annual rally, said
the precautions are all part of a compromise with the
police department.
"After the accident last year the police department
said, 'If you set one foot in the city we're going to arrest
the entire Band,' " Leckman explained.
"This year we've been negotiating with them and
they have finally granted us a parade permit. But thev

stressed the fact that the entire SFPD tactical unit of 200
to 300 men will be on call," Leckman said. "If the
monitors can't handle it, the police have no qualms
about arresting anyone."
Michael Ramsey-Perez, an adviser to the Fiesta Com
mittee, warned that "the city is very serious about the
whole ordeal. If there is any problem with vandalism or
alcohol, the city made it clear this would be the last ral
ly. Stanford is really on the line."
Patty Stokes, one of the Band's representatives to the
committee, backed up Ramsey-Perez's admonitions.
"The city made it clear that if people get out of line
they will get arrested. The police department's tone
was very stern," Stokes said.
Stokes said the Band has loaned the Fiesta Commit
tee the money to pay the security deposit for Aquatic
Park because the committee has no money of its own.
"But the Fiesta Committee is responsible for what
happens there," Stokes said. "If the park isn't trashed,
we get the money back. We hope people won't go
around destroying things."
The rally monitors, dressed in special shirts and
green flourescent hats, will work to keep students in
control along the new rally route. The route will start at
