# University fires Row manager

### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
Row Manager Heloisa Edwards, a
long-time favorite of row residents,
was fired this week as a "result of
differences in the management
styles and procedures of her depart
ment between her and her super
visor," according to Edward Scoles,
director of housing management.
Terry McGovern, manager of the
Housing Facilities Office and Ed
wards' supervisor, declined com
ment on the reasons behind the ter
mination.
"This is a personal matter and we
owe it to Heloisa not to discuss the
reasons for her termination,"

McGovern said.
Edwards could not be reached for
comment on her dismissal.
"Heloisa was given written notice
of her termination," McGovern con
tinued. "I give things careful
thought and consideration before I
take action: this was a carefully cal
culated decision that was not based
on a single reason."
Senior Jim DeLaHunt, a Haus Mit
teleuropa resident and former
Columbae resident, said Edwards
was a favorite of many row resi
dents.
"Maybe I'll get together a group
and say that Heloisa is a nice person.

I don't plan to have a sit-in in
McGovern's office, but I want to let
him know we're upset," DeLaHunt
said. "I'd like to get a clearer idea of
what's going on."
Edwards' position is currently
being filled part-time by McGovern,
and no immediate replacement will
be named.
McGovern has filled in for several
months in the past in the same posi
tion, and he anticipates no prob
lems in fulfilling the services re
quired by students on the Row.
"A prime responsibilty for us right
now is making sure that no row
facilities lack any services,"
McGovern said.
