## Panel discusses technology 
### JERRY BALL Staff writer 
A panel composed of researchers, consul
tants and Stanford faculty members convened
in Terman Auditorium Wednesday night to dis
cuss "the role technology plays in the develop
ment of the economy and social values."
Civil Engineering Prof. Joseph Franzini dis
cussed a copper mining project in which he
participated which involved stripping an island
of its vegetation, drying up its rivers and teach
ing its natives to work in the mines.
The natives, who had previously been
"primitive" farmers, did not resent the
destruction of their island, but rather took on
the values which the new destructive technol
ogy embodied. Franzini said that a native friend

ot his told him that what he wanted next in life
was a transistor radio, a watch, a shirt and a pair
of shoes, in that order.
Franzini said that the mine will be depleted
within 20 years.
Operations Research Prof. George Dantzig
said that there are scientific means of incorpo
rating societv's concerns into economic deci
sions, but that most policy makers "make deci
sions without the benefit of the powerful ana
lytical tools that are available to them."
Electrical Engineering Prof. Malcolm
McWhorter said that most decisions concern
ing technology are made without foresight. He
lamented that "the amount ot money that we
spend on alternative research wouldn't buy
half an MX missile."
