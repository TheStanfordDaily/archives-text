# Cold snap leaves housing chilly
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
Many students were made chillingly
aware of the new cold spell Wednes
day when the University neglected to
turn on the heat in some residences.
But according to officials at the
Housing Management Office, the heat
is now on in all student residences.
Some residents, including ail in Gover
nor's Corner, were enjoying heat as
early as last Tuesday.
The slight delay occurred because
officials gauge the need for heat by
two oscillating and sometimes unpre
dictable factors: the weather and stu
dents' opinions.
Ed Scoles, director of the manage
ment office, said, "we try to assess
when the permanent cold has come to
the campus in the fall." He said that
the weather change, defined as nights
of 50 degrees or lower, usually occurs
in the period from Oct. 15 to Nov. 10.
Scoles said that sometimes Stanford
may experience a few deceiving days

ot colder temperatures, only to see the
weather revert back to warmer tem
peratures several days later. Since fre
quent changes of the heating controls
require an especially large chunk of
the University's $1.5 million bill for gas
and steam, housing management must
guard against such mistakes.
According to Terrence McGovern,
manager of the Housing Facilities Of
fice, the office receives monthly wea
ther reports to help assess upcoming
conditons, but "people are the best
weather report there is."
The Housing Management Office
keeps careful track of resident input.
Operations and Maintainence also
utilizes an information system, often
advising housing management.
Scoles said that "when people start
calling in and registering discomfort,"
his staff considers turning on the heat.
However, the variety of insulation in
University residences, from the more
drat'ty row houses to the newly-built,
well-insulated Governor's Corner,

tends to complicate the decision
making process. Usually the four
housing facilities offices do not turn
on their heat simultaneously.
McGovern emphasized that, in as
sessing resident input, "we tend to
balance needs and costs." Only a
group consensus, rather than a few
random complaints, justifies the indi
rect spending of students' money on
heating the residences.
McGovern said that a recent im
provement in central heating controls
will enable housing managment to
respond to resident input more effec
tively. An energy requisite loan
granted to the office two years ago has
produced a modernized control sys
tem and may save energy.
The control system will allow adjust
ing of the heating several times during
winter, in response to both weather
changes and resident complaints.
"What really turns the heat on is the
needs of the customer, that is, the stu
dents," McGovern said.
