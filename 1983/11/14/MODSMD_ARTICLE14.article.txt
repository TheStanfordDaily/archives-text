## The 						Stanford Daily Adding to the arsenal 
### 
In a troubling pair of decisions last week, the
Senate approved funds for the production of
two destabilizing and immoral additions to the
national arsenal: nerve gas weapons and the
MX missile.
Neither of the votes represented great devia
tions from Congress' previous policies. The
Senate had made its nerve gas stance known in
July in a military policy vote. In addition, the
House had approved the "missile experimen
tal" the previous week, and the more conser
vative Senate's final approval of the $2.1 billion
necessary to begin production of the MX came
as little surprise.
But the actual 56-37 Senate vote on the MX,
climaxing years of debate on the huge missile
and its controversial basing system, was still
alarming.
Rejecting advice by numerous experts, in
cluding the deputy director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, the Senate seems
intent on deploying the highly vulnerable and
destabilizing first strike weapons in existing
Minuteman silos in Wyoming and Nebraska. By
putting the powerful weapons in the vulner
able silos, the United States is creating an even
more attractive target for the Soviets to knock
out in a first strike.
Even the Pentagon has estimated that nine
out of 10 MXs would be destroyed in a nuclear
attack. The logic of spending $2.1 billion on

such vulnerable weapons seems cloudy.
Just as distressing was the vote to produce a
new generation of nerve gas weapons. The 47-
46 vote was acrimonious and bipartisan, with
Vice President George Bush casting the decid
ing ballot for the second time in four months
on this topic.
Former President Richard Nixon banned
nerve gas weapon production in 1969. Nixon,
hardly a soft-line president, decided that the
United States should abide by the Geneva
Protocol of 1925 which banned the first use of
poison gas.
Apparently abandoning this restraint, the
Reagan administration has long pushed for the
development of a new generation of nerve gas
weapons.
The decision to put money into developing
these arms undermines respect for the United
States throughout the world. Even Sen. Ted
Stevens (R-Alaska), who led the fight to restore
the nerve gas funds, admitted that the nerve
gas weapons are "in many ways more repug
nant than even the horrendous destructive
force of nuclear weapons."
But, the Senate seems to be saying, if the
Soviets are developing nerve gas, the
Americans should too. It is just this type of
"monkey-see, monkey-do" attitude that has
involved this country in a seemingly endless
and morally reprehensible arms race.
