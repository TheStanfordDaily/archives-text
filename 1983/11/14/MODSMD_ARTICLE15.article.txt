# Robert Larkins: Gramps' Gripes
## Welfare means forced charity 
### 
When was the last time you
thought about welfare? I mean really
thought about it, not just heard
about it. For that matter, when was
the last time America thought about
it?
Sure, the news is full of contro
versy over unemployment funding
and Medicare appropriations, but
the debates are always quantitative.
Every few weeks the President and
Congress slug it out over a few bil
lion bucks, but no one, not even
nastv ol' President Ronald Reagan,
that hard-hearted capitalist, ever
challenges the fundamental as
sumptions underlying the modern
welfare state.
The goal of Reaganomics is to
eliminate wasteful programs and
cheaters. The President's crusade is
against the four-hour bureaucratic
coffee break and the government
funded study on the social ramifica
tions of goat cheese fondue.Reagan
believes it is wrong for food stamp
recipients to drive Porsches and he
thinks students should spend their
GSLs on school â€” not stereos.
Ronald Reagan has never ques
tioned the systematic transfer of
wealth by the government from the
"haves" to the "have nots."
When was the last time you
thought about welfare? Why, for ex
ample, should my tax dollars be
spent on your ailing grandmother?
Why should many ot our fathers
work six months of every year for
Uncle Sam? What obligation do I
have to finance someone else's idea
of a good cause? It I am to be my
brother's keeper, why shouldn't I

decide how to discharge that re
sponsibility?
The problem with the modern
welfare state is that we have institu
tionalized charity. Fifty years of do
gooder legislation has stolen from
us our personal sense of social re
sponsibility and assigned that role to
a distant, impersonal bureaucracy.
The virtue of giving is gone. An inte
gral part of charity is the feeling of
accomplishment, of having made a
difference. No less important is the
satisfaction of being thanked and
seeing appreciation in the eyes of
those helped. This can only happen
when charity is administered volun
tarily and personally.
Try to convince Joe Sixpack that
he should feel good about himself
secure in the knowledge that, via
Uncle Sam, he's helping out his fel
low man. All he knows is that the
profits from the three engines he
tuned Friday have gone to assuage
Teddy Kennedy's conscience. Not
only is forced charity unrewarding,
but it is unjust.
Conditioned by five decades of
unchecked government absorption
of the sovereignity of the individual,
we have lost our sense of effective
ness. Our instinctive response to
problems is a vague, "Gee, they
really ought to do something about
this," "they" being the govern
ment. The do-gooders intended to
create a socially conscious nation by
extending society's responsibilities
to touch upon nearly every facet of
our lives. They have succeeded in
creating an "enlightened" society of
callous and impotent individuals, in

dividuals not individualists.
Even those of us who are not
welfare regulars have been infected
by the plague of dependency.
Recently, when tragedy struck a rel
ative of mine, the first reaction of
the family or the widowed mother of
four was to seek out all available go
vernment assistance. "There must
be some program for dependent
children," advised one well
intentioned aunt. The idea that the
widow's family should support her
never occurred to anyone. The men
tality of dependency is ingrained.
The do-gooders have legislated self
reliance into oblivion.
Sometimes I wonder how many
Americans realize that there was a
time not too terribly long ago when
welfare programs did not exist. They
were tough times indeed, for
hardship is nothing new to the
human experience. But they were
also times when people looked out
for one another to a far greater ex
tent that happens today. We still
have down-and-outers in our midst,
and we always will. The difference
between then and now is that the
"haves" used to help the "have
nots" by themselves. They did not
shirk their human responsibilities in
the assumption that the state would
take care of the situation.
The modern welfare state, I
believe, is dehumanizing us. When
was the last time you thought about
welfare?
