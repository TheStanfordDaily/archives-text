# War eliminates decisions
## 
### 
The nuclear disarmament movement has brought to
gether a coalition of people who usually do not ap
prove of public demonstrations. For those of you like
me, who have been outsiders to most of the literature,
demonstrations and discussions, immersed primarily in
your own academic work, just 10 minutes at a public
lecture can provide an enormous amount of insight
into why millions of people in Europe and the United
States consider disarmament such a major issue.
The stage is set. Places, everyone. USSR are you
ready? U.S., are you ready? All right, let's hit it. Lights
out. Let the cameras roll.
Remember the last Christmas, Thanksgiving,
Ramadan or Hanukkah you celebrated with your
friends and family? Or was it a friends wedding? All of
those intense joyful feelings that make you feel great
just to be alive. And even those other moments. Like
the moment of anxiety you had at age 21, 25, 30, 40, or
50 — the fear that you were getting older, that your life
was slipping away. Forget those moments. Life won't
slip away after new-killer war. New-killer war brings life
as we know it to a stand- still.
You will not be able to watch TV to fill in those boring
moments. There will be no need to worry about whe
ther or not you have a date. The question of sexual
preference, the inherent intellectual superiority of one
race over another, the superiority of males over
females, the decision to sacrifice family life for a career,
the evolution vs. creation debate, or the equal rights
amendment? New-killer war will resolve many debates.
It will put an end to many of our problems.
Have you had problems trying to decide what you
want to do with your life? Any difficulty selecting
classes for next quarter? Anyone with aspirations to
become the first multimillionaire from Athens, Texas?
The first woman to survive on Mars? The first Asian-
American president of the United States? The first male
president of the National Organization of Women? For
get it! There will be no need for a career placement and
counseling center. New-killer war will ruin your career.
Remember that pit in your stomach last year after Big
Game? Remember the promise you made afterwards to
fix Cal in 1983? Forget it. After new-killer war there will
be but one Big Game — the game of survival on a
devastated planet. And even if there are 22 healthy
players left alive to learn the rules, the world as we
know it will be gone forever. We all get the axe from
new-killer war.
New-killer war will redefine the entire geographic
and ideological world. It will unite the entire Northern
Hemisphere into sharing one great destiny. Canada,
the United States, the Soviet Union and Europe — com
munists, socialists and capitalists will share equally in
that one moment of total and awesome destruction.
New-killer war will reshape the agenda of human life.

It will eliminate affirmative action programs and white
backlash. There will be no one around to affirm or con
firm any action.
The atmospheric c hanges will make the "greenhouse
effect" look like a welcomed event. The aftershocks
will make an 8.0 Richter scale earthquake seem like .1
good rocking party. The massive waste of the world's
breadbasket here in the United States will guarantee
starvation for those still living in the Southern Hemi
sphere.
The massive number-of genetic mutations afflicting
humans living in the Southern Hemisphere will anti
quate the race issue in South Africa. The onslaught ot
pests and unknown diseases, the cataclysmic climatic
effects, and the secondary effects of blindness and skin
disorders, hunger and agony will make the issues ot
racism, divorce, broken families, religious differences,
the generation gap, stress management and redistribu
tion of wealth seem simple and ordinary.
Have you ever spoken with anyone who survived
Hiroshima or Nagasaki? japan was a powerful and for
midable military foe. After the bomb, the Japanese did
not rush to increase its military enlistments. Massive
destruction of human life and nature did not invoke
popular support for continued militarism. Japan
disarmed and set about rebuilding life. Those were the
days of primitive new-killer weapons.
America's arsenal is now more advanced. We have
stockpiled a more effective arsenal. But for what?
Regardless of who strikes first, we will eventually get
nuked. After the first new-killer explosion in America,
no one will call the White House. The youth will not
crowd the Marines recruitment office. The American
public will not rally in support of the president. Ameri
can honor and strength will not be restored by nuking
Cuba. The totality of the destruction will demolish the
pride of being a strong military state.
Having lived in a world tilled with sensation, can you
for one moment still your mind until it becomes a void'
Imagine infinity. Create that mental void in which there
are no thoughts, no hopes of thoughts. Imagine that
time as the amount of warning you'll have before the*
devastation. There will be no need to run to your local
bomb shelter before the beginning of a long evolution
ary period of nothingness for the Northern Hemi
sphere.
This then is what motivates grandmothers, grandfat
hers and white collar workers who usually don't partici
pate in demonstrations to block naval base
and risk arrest. Unlike many of us, they can imagine the
massive amount of destruction that the earth will expe
rience after a nuclear attack. The earth will groan. The
heavens will weep. Life as we know it will cease.
