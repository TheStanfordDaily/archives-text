Fed analysis
Martin Anderson, a colleague of
mine at the Hoover Institution, has
written a perceptive analysis of the
current economic situation in the
United States as an argument for the
passage of the balanced budget
amendment (Daily, Nov. 7).
I am in agreement that the federal
government cannot continue to
spend more than it takes in, but Ihe
analysis leaves out two very impor
tant factors: the flow of safe harbor
currency to the United States and
the tremendous growth of entitle
ment programs that are not means
tested.
The omission of the safe harbor
money llow shows a clear difference
of opinion about the economy's
strength to sustain a sizeable deficit
in the short run. Traditional
that in a country
with large budget deficits the gov
ernment's need tor money bids up
interest rates on borrowing, fur
ther, the higher rates attract an in
flow ot foreign currencies because
they then earn more money than if
the funds had remained at home.
Ibis is a theory which Martin An
derson, Martin Feldstein and many
others support. I believe that the
theory, although applicable in many
situations, ignores today's eco
nomic and political realities.
Business firms have been expand
ing by using internally generated
cash flow and not by increasing their
borrowings in the capital markets.
Ihe third quarter expansion of the
CiNP has exceeded projections. It is
probable that more foreign capital
enters our markets because the
United States is a safe place to in
vest, rather than solely because of
high interest rates.
Interest rates are, after all, the

price of money and are subject to
the supply and the demand of
loanable funds.
If the effect of internal politics on
federal government expenditures is
to be noted, recognition of foreign
capital flows in response to foreign
military action — a political mat
ter — also has to be recognized.
To lump the "poor, sick and the
elderly" together implies that they
are in considerable need. The
average after tax, per capita income
tor those persons over 65 years is
greater than the average after tax,
per capita income for persons under
65 years. The lack of real income

growth per capita in the United
States during the 19705, while Social
Security benefits were being in
dexed at double-digit rates, and
during part of that period the infla
tion was counted twice, largely ex
plains this new income distribution
phenomenon.
It may be well to point out that the
strong third quarter means higher
tax yields: from corporate, and per
sonal income and Social Security;
and some lower payouts; un
employment compensation and
means-tested benefits.

Vietnam vets
To many readers this letter may
seem a little anachronistic, but to
many Vietnam veterans it is long
overdue. Recently, I had the oppor
tunity to talk with three Vietnam
veterans who have in the past six
months joined the vets program in
Menlo Park. This brief exposure to
the problems they face jolted me
out of my ignorance and com
placency.
For these men, and many others
in similar situations and conditions,
the 13 years between being sent
home from Vietnam and joining the

program have been a painful
struggle trying to fit in to an alien
and at times hostile society.
The people and establishments
responsible for the present condi
tion of many Vietnam vets did not
and have not assumed their respon
sibility to help the veterans re-enter
society, and even more fundamen
tally, to cope with and overcome
their own internal problems. The
little help that is offered is hope
lessly inadequate, and provides
much too swift a transition from
Vietnam in wartime to the United
States in peacetime.
What happened to the millions of

dollars spent on the war in Vietnam
when it is time to heal the wounds?
Suddenly the flow of funds dried
up when no one's interest was
served by spending more money.
It is far too easy to write the vets
off saying that they are simply
insane, as though they have been
incurably so since birth. How many
people do you know who have
slept with pistols since birth, or
always stand with their backs to a
wall near a door or window when in
a crowded room? These men are
not the ruthless baby killers as they
were branded upon their return by
the peace protestors.
Even though it is the govern
ment's undeniable responsibility to
establish and finance a comprehen
sive and effective program to assist
the Vietnam veterans (a responsibil
ity that has been shamefully ne
glected), each of us can also con
tribute by making an effort to un
derstand the problems that these
men face, and what is needed to
solve, or at least alleviate them.

Be charitable
Inspired by President Kennedy's
appeal for students to pursue
careers in public service, I would
like to briefly amplify the impor
tance of service we can always
perform regardless of our careers,
specifically, charity. As students, we
surely must recognize that learning
to share our time, energy and
income with others is a fundamen
tal lesson of our education. What's
more, if we don't get into the habit
of giving now, when shall we
begin?
