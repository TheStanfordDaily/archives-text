# Hospital gets copter service
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
The Hospital will this winter start
using a new emergency helicopter
to transport trauma victims, accor
ding to Dr. Michael Eliastam, direc
tor of emergency services.
The use of the helicopter is "a
logical step tor a place like Stan
ford" where the Hospital is involved
in both service and research opera
tions, Eliastam said. Eliastam said
there are relatively few such
helicopter service programs in oper
ation today, and the project puts the
University on the "cutting edge" of
the development of helicopters for
emergency transport and service.
New technology has made
helicopters better equipped for
emergency medical transport use,
he said.
The new helicopter will use a
heliport between Welch road and
the Hospital, which has been used
for the past 10 years primarily for
naval and army flights, according to
Barbara Battino, director of public
relations for the Hospital. An en
larged pad should be built on the
roof of the hospital in a few years,
she said.
The helicopter will be owned and
serviced by Aeromedical Services, a
private aircraft operator.

"Teams of physicians, nurses, and
perhaps paramedics" will be
available to operate the helicopter
24 hours a day, Eliastam said. He
predicted the helicopter will make
"several emergency flights a day."
Eliastam said major trauma cases
account for only 5 to 10 percent of
all emergency cases and that the
helicopter service will be beneficial
in only a small number of the trauma
cases. The helicopter will be used in
cases where reaching a victim by
ambulance is impossible and when
special medical care at the scene is
needed which cannot be provided
by paramedics, he said.
"Trauma victims are generally
young, and the benefits (of saving
their lives) are extremely high to so
ciety," Eliastam said. There is also
clear evidence that rapid transporta
tion of major trauma victims to
trauma hospitals such as the Univer
sity's is valuable in treating victims,
he said.
Palo Alto City Council members
Ellen Fletcher and Larry Klien said
they do not expect any complaints
from local residents about possible
noise from the helicopter.
"It's (the heliport) not really close
enough to have an impact on resi
dents," Fletcher said.
