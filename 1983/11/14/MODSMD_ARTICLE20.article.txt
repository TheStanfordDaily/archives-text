## Professor's Commentary: Stuart Reges Computer literacy is not as easy as 1,2,3...4 
### 
Stuart Reges came to Stanford in 1979 as a
student in the Masters degree program in
computer science. He started teaching in
troductory programming courses in 1980
and took over the coordination of all of the
introductory courses in 1981. Since his
graduation in 1982 he has been the assistant
to the chairman of the Computer Science
Department - teaching, coordinating and
performing various administrative duties.
I always find parties difficult. At parties I
meet exciting and socially relevant people
who are doing exciting and socially relevant
things with their lives. Conversation with
such people is always awkward. I never
know what to say when they ask me the in
evitable question, "What do you do for a
living?" I wish I had a 25-word answer that
would explain exactly what it is that I do and
simultaneously convince them that I too am
doing exciting and socially relevant things.
My mind is usually a blank.
I could tell them that I teach. But exciting
and socially relevant people see right
through such a meager response and dig
for something more meaningful. They
would just turn around and ask me what I
teach. I would tell them that I teach people
about computers. That response usually in
trigues them, because although computer
people are not exciting and socially rele
vant, they are well paid. "What do you
teach about computers?" they ask next.
Still at a loss for coherent explanation, I
resort to facts. I reply that the course I teach

is entitled "Introduction to Computers."
Here one of two things happens. Most
probably they feel satisfied that I am not an
exciting and socially relevant person and
they turn their attention elsewhere. Some
brave souls, however give me one more
chance. They decide to draw me out by as
king a probing question. "What do you
think constitutes an introduction to com
puters?"
People who ask strangers probing ques
tions, I believe, deserve what they get. So
here I let loose and make a genuine attempt
to answer their question. My genuine
response is that I don't know. There are
many things I could teach a person about
computers, but I really don't knowwhich of
those things is fundamental. I would
group the possible topics into one of four
categories.
I have already overwhelmed my listener
with my recent outburst, so I pause and
proceed cautiously. The worst thing one
can do at a party is to start talking like a
"techie," and already my anxious listener is
wondering how to bow out of this con
versation gracefully.
I try to hold onto the person a little
longer by introducing an analogy. Those of
us who use computers often feel that they
will become as common, in the next 10
years, as automobiles are now. So I ask my
listener to pretend for a moment that com
puters are cars. This, I can see, has restored
their attention. Pretending is both exciting
and socially relevant. What, I ask them,
constitutes an introduction to cars? As I

have said, people usually give four answers.
Each answer describes a different course
one might offer.
The first course is Driver's Education.
This course requires a great deal of hands
on interaction. Students learn how to take
an off-the-shelf automobile and make it
run. They learn what the various compo
nents of the car are, such as brakes and
wheels, and they learn the controls used to
manipulate them. They learn how to turn
the key and make it work.
The second course is Automobile Cul
ture. Students study the history of
automobiles from their invention to the
present. The culture surrounding
automobiles is examined: who owns them
and what they are like. The social impact of
automobiles is considered, such issues as
pollution, safety and how cars change the
way people interact. This course requires
no hands-on interaction. Students read se
lected articles from a textbook, listen to a
series of guest lecturers and make a field
trip to a highway to observe real people
using cars.
The third course is Auto Shop. In this
course students move beyond the simple
manipulation devices like the steering
wheel and clutch and learn how to modify
what is inside the car so that it behaves dif
ferently. They learn how to open up the
hood and rearrange things to make the car
run better. They learn how to implement a
change and test out whether their change
achieves their desired goal. They become
mechanics. This class requires constant

hands-on experience.
The fourth class is Automobile Science.
In this class students study the design and
operation of automobiles from a formal
point of view. They examine the engineer
ing principles behind the design of an ef
fective automobile. They also study the
limitations of automobiles. Many esoteric
but nonetheless non-trivial questions are
answered, such as why no automobile
made with rubber wheels could drive from
the earth to the sun and back in less than
200 years, even if someone built a highway
from here to there. This course has a heavy
emphasis on textbooks although hands-on
experience is usually used to reinforce gen
eral principles.
By now I have convinced my exciting and
socially relevant listener that I am at least
weird. But there is no stopping me, I am on
a roll. I have to use my analogy to explain
some of the difficult issues I face in my job.
The Driver's Education course is someth
ing that may very well exist for computers in
the near future. Already in the better
schools typing classes are being replaced
with word processing classes. People are
starting to realize that the latter is a more
marketable skill.
In the meantime, people are learning the
basics from friends or by trial and error.
Fortunately, a novice computer user can ex
periment with his machine without facing
the dangers that a novice automobile user
would. Even so, computer novices often
have the same degree of fear that novice
automobile users have. They need to be

shown the same level of patience and un
derstanding in their attempts to learn.
Otherwise they give up before they ever get
a license.
It is diffic nll at stantord to justify a course
like Driver's Education because it has no
apparent intellectual content. For the time
being, however, we grudgingly teach it in
one form or another, often for credit. We
console ourselves with the belief that soon
it will not be an issue. Freshmen will enter
Stanford having already acquired these
skills.
A good introduction to computers, I con
tinue, must include elements from all four
of the courses I have mentioned. The prob
lem is one of balance and perspective, I
can't teach all four courses, so I must make
the difficult choice of cutting something
from each and I must try to integrate these
four diverse elements without confusing
students.
That, I conclude, is what I do for a living. I
try to teach that course as best I can. How
succesful I am, only time will tell. Certainly
I make mistakes, but I hope I am close to
the mark. And that is why I feel that my
work is exciting and socially relevant.
Of course, this whole conversation was
hypothetical. By now, dear reader, you can
understand why I do the things I do at par
ties. When people ask me what I do for a
living, I tell them that I'm a social worker at
a halfway house. I have stimulating con
versations with people who are genuinely
interested in what I have to say. And I do,
believe me, have fun at those parties.

puters are cars. This, I can see, has restored
their attention. Pretending is both exciting
and socially relevant. What, I ask them,
constitutes an introduction to cars? As I

have said, people usually give four answers.
Each answer describes a different course
one might offer.
The first course is Driver's Education.
This course requires a great deal of hands
on interaction. Students learn how to take
an off-the-shelf automobile and make it
run. They learn what the various compo
nents of the car are, such as brakes and
wheels, and they learn the controls used to
manipulate them. They learn how to turn
the key and make it work.
The second course is Automobile Cul
ture. Students study the history of
automobiles from their invention to the
present. The culture surrounding
automobiles is examined: who owns them
and what they are like. The social impact of
automobiles is considered, such issues as
pollution, safety and how cars change the
way people interact. This course requires
no hands-on interaction. Students read se
lected articles from a textbook, listen to a
series of guest lecturers and make a field
trip to a highway to observe real people
using cars.
The third course is Auto Shop. In this
course students move beyond the simple
manipulation devices like the steering
wheel and clutch and learn how to modify
what is inside the car so that it behaves dif
ferently. They learn how to open up the
hood and rearrange things to make the car
run better. They learn how to implement a
change and test out whether their change
achieves their desired goal. They become
mechanics. This class requires constant

hands-on experience.
The fourth class is Automobile Science.
In this class students study the design and
operation of automobiles from a formal
point of view. They examine the engineer
ing principles behind the design of an ef
fective automobile. They also study the
limitations of automobiles. Many esoteric
but nonetheless non-trivial questions are
answered, such as why no automobile
made with rubber wheels could drive from
the earth to the sun and back in less than
200 years, even if someone built a highway
from here to there. This course has a heavy
emphasis on textbooks although hands-on
experience is usually used to reinforce gen
eral principles.
By now I have convinced my exciting and
socially relevant listener that I am at least
weird. But there is no stopping me, I am on
a roll. I have to use my analogy to explain
some of the difficult issues I face in my job.
The Driver's Education course is someth
ing that may very well exist for computers in
the near future. Already in the better
schools typing classes are being replaced
with word processing classes. People are
starting to realize that the latter is a more
marketable skill.
In the meantime, people are learning the
basics from friends or by trial and error.
Fortunately, a novice computer user can ex
periment with his machine without facing
the dangers that a novice automobile user
would. Even so, computer novices often
have the same degree of fear that novice
automobile users have. They need to be

shown the same level of patience and un
derstanding in their attempts to learn.
Otherwise they give up before they ever get
a license.
It is diffic nll at stantord to justify a course
like Driver's Education because it has no
apparent intellectual content. For the time
being, however, we grudgingly teach it in
one form or another, often for credit. We
console ourselves with the belief that soon
it will not be an issue. Freshmen will enter
Stanford having already acquired these
skills.
A good introduction to computers, I con
tinue, must include elements from all four
of the courses I have mentioned. The prob
lem is one of balance and perspective, I
can't teach all four courses, so I must make
the difficult choice of cutting something
from each and I must try to integrate these
four diverse elements without confusing
students.
That, I conclude, is what I do for a living. I
try to teach that course as best I can. How
succesful I am, only time will tell. Certainly
I make mistakes, but I hope I am close to
the mark. And that is why I feel that my
work is exciting and socially relevant.
Of course, this whole conversation was
hypothetical. By now, dear reader, you can
understand why I do the things I do at par
ties. When people ask me what I do for a
living, I tell them that I'm a social worker at
a halfway house. I have stimulating con
versations with people who are genuinely
interested in what I have to say. And I do,
believe me, have fun at those parties.
Stuart Reges came to Stanford in 1979 as a
student in the Masters degree program in
computer science. He started teaching in
troductory programming courses in 1980
and took over the coordination of all of the
introductory courses in 1981. Since his
graduation in 1982 he has been the assistant
to the chairman of the Computer Science
Department - teaching, coordinating and
performing various administrative duties.
I always find parties difficult. At parties I
meet exciting and socially relevant people
who are doing exciting and socially relevant
things with their lives. Conversation with
such people is always awkward. I never
know what to say when they ask me the in
evitable question, "What do you do for a
living?" I wish I had a 25-word answer that
would explain exactly what it is that I do and
simultaneously convince them that I too am
doing exciting and socially relevant things.
My mind is usually a blank.
I could tell them that I teach. But exciting
and socially relevant people see right
through such a meager response and dig
for something more meaningful. They
would just turn around and ask me what I
teach. I would tell them that I teach people
about computers. That response usually in
trigues them, because although computer
people are not exciting and socially rele
vant, they are well paid. "What do you
teach about computers?" they ask next.
Still at a loss for coherent explanation, I
resort to facts. I reply that the course I teach

is entitled "Introduction to Computers."
Here one of two things happens. Most
probably they feel satisfied that I am not an
exciting and socially relevant person and
they turn their attention elsewhere. Some
brave souls, however give me one more
chance. They decide to draw me out by as
king a probing question. "What do you
think constitutes an introduction to com
puters?"
People who ask strangers probing ques
tions, I believe, deserve what they get. So
here I let loose and make a genuine attempt
to answer their question. My genuine
response is that I don't know. There are
many things I could teach a person about
computers, but I really don't knowwhich of
those things is fundamental. I would
group the possible topics into one of four
categories.
I have already overwhelmed my listener
with my recent outburst, so I pause and
proceed cautiously. The worst thing one
can do at a party is to start talking like a
"techie," and already my anxious listener is
wondering how to bow out of this con
versation gracefully.
I try to hold onto the person a little
longer by introducing an analogy. Those of
us who use computers often feel that they
will become as common, in the next 10
years, as automobiles are now. So I ask my

puters are cars. This, I can see, has restored
