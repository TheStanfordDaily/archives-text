## Stanford resigns itself to losing again Geiger confirms Wiggin's resignation 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger confirmed at a Friday
morning press conference that Paul Wiggin will coach his last
football game for Stanford this Saturday against UC-Berkeley
"We'll be conducting a search now for a successor," Geiger
said. "There is no prejudgement on that. There is no leading
candidate. It is a wide open search."
Wiggin, who is 16-27 in his four seasons at Stanford, was
asked to resign four weeks ago in a meeting with Geiger follow
ing Stanford's 32-15 loss to Washington. The loss gave the Car
dinal a 0-6 record at the time and nine straight losses dating back
to last season.
Since the meeting, Stanford won just one of four games,
lowering its season record to I-9, including a 16-7 loss to
Oregon last Saturday. Even it the Cardinal defeats Cal in this Sat
urday's Big Game, it will still finish with its worst record since
1960, when the Jack Curtice-coached team went 0-10.
"We talked about his situation and the tootball situation,"
Geiger said. "I said I felt that we probably needed to make a
change. He (Wiggin) nodded his head and said he understood
that."
Wiggin released written statement at the Friday news confer
ence, which he did not attend. (For the full text of the letter, see
page 7.)
While Geiger implied the Card coach was asked to resign and
was not fired, Wiggin told the San Francisco Chronicle other
wise. "I was fired," he told the Chronicle. "I was asked to resign
and that's what I told the players (last Wednesday). You could
say I resigned, but that's not true and that's not me."
Geiger, in response to Wiggin's claim, said, "I think what he
said this morning in the Chronicle, that he felt he was fired, I'll
go with that because I think that's the kind of man he is.
"He doesn't duck an issue and I won't duck an issue," Geiger
continued. "He has high integrity and he does not consider
himself a quitter. He does not teach his tootball teams to be
quitters. He wanted to call it the way he saw it and that's fine."
Wiggin was surprisingly relaxed in his post-game press con
ference Saturday. While most of the reporters were hesitant to
ask questions pertaining to his resignation, the Stanford coach
dodged no bullets.
Asked if he gave a special pre-game "win one for the coach"
pep talk, Wiggin said he didn't. "That would have been cheap.
That's not me. I can't take 'Win one for the Wig.' "
Wiggin also said he felt no sense of relief following his resig
nation since he was asked to do so four weeks ago. "I have
never felt crappier than I do now," he commented. "That (the
resignation) was something I'd known since the Washington
game so it wasn't a monkey off my back."

The woes of another losing Saturday were plentiful once again in Stanford Stadium. Above, a

lies on the ground in despair.
