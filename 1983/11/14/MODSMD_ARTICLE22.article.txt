# Oregon Ducks shoot down Cardinal, 16-7

### ADAM BERNS 
It stopped raining before the start of Stanford's football game
against Oregon Saturday, but it still poured on the Cardinal.
The injury-ridden Oregon Ducks took advantage of three
Stanford interceptions, one fumble, and 116 yards in penalties
to defeat the Cardinal 16-7 in front of only 31,420 fans at Stanford
Stadium.
There was speculation on what effect Head Coach Paul Wig
gin's resignation announcement actually had on the play of the
team. Wiggin dispelled the notion that there was any "win one
for the coach" attitude. Some of the players thought that the an
nouncement might have even hurt practice on Friday.
"I think that there were a lot of media people here Friday,"
quarterback John Paye said after the game. "It just made it more
difficult to practice."
Beside the Stanford mistakes, the other key for Oregon was
its ability to run the ball effectively. The Ducks rushed tor 279
yards against a Cardinal team that just last week started to look
respectable against the run by initially shutting down USC.
"I think that the key to the game was that our line controlled
the line of scrimmage and we were able to run the ball effective
ly," Oregon Coach Rich Brooks said after the game. "We've
been just wiped out (with injuries) on the offensive line. I was
extremely pleased with the way they played. We were starting to
become a good offensive line before the injuries and we're
starting to rebound now."
According to Wiggin, the Cardinal had the most trouble stop
ping an off-tackle play which Oregon used effectively through
out the game.
For the Ducks, no particular runner stood out. Oregon had
nine different people carry the ball with tailback Kevin McCall
and fullback Kevin Wilhite leading the way.
The Ducks also passed for 98 yards with freshman quarterback
Chris Miller completing nine of 15 passes.
In an effort to improve its offense, Stanford moved defensive
end Carin Veris from defensive end to tight end. Veris played
two offensive series, and on a goal line play on defense, before
leaving the game with an injury.
"We moved Garin Veris to tight end," Wiggin explained.
"Our plan was to work him on both sides of the football. But
then he got hurt."
Senior Jim Clymer, who started the year at tight end for Stan
ford before getting injured and losing his job, replaced Veris
and had an excellent game, catching five passes for 60 yards to
lead the Cardinal in receiving yardage.
"It (starting Veris) seemed to inspire Jim Clymer to come out
and play with a vengeance," Wiggin said.
Stanford's pass offense overall, however, was erratic and dis-
