# Oregon Ducks shoot down Cardinal, 16-7
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
It stopped raining before the start of Stanford's football game
against Oregon Saturday, but it still poured on the Cardinal.
The injury-ridden Oregon Ducks took advantage of three
Stanford interceptions, one fumble, and 116 yards in penalties
to defeat the Cardinal 16-7 in front of only 31,420 fans at Stanford
Stadium.
There was speculation on what effect Head Coach Paul Wig
gin's resignation announcement actually had on the play of the
team. Wiggin dispelled the notion that there was any "win one
for the coach" attitude. Some of the players thought that the an
nouncement might have even hurt practice on Friday.
"I think that there were a lot of media people here Friday,"
quarterback John Paye said after the game. "It just made it more
difficult to practice."
Beside the Stanford mistakes, the other key for Oregon was
its ability to run the ball effectively. The Ducks rushed tor 279
yards against a Cardinal team that just last week started to look
respectable against the run by initially shutting down USC.
"I think that the key to the game was that our line controlled
the line of scrimmage and we were able to run the ball effective
ly," Oregon Coach Rich Brooks said after the game. "We've
been just wiped out (with injuries) on the offensive line. I was
extremely pleased with the way they played. We were starting to
become a good offensive line before the injuries and we're
starting to rebound now."
According to Wiggin, the Cardinal had the most trouble stop
ping an off-tackle play which Oregon used effectively through
out the game.
For the Ducks, no particular runner stood out. Oregon had
nine different people carry the ball with tailback Kevin McCall
and fullback Kevin Wilhite leading the way.
The Ducks also passed for 98 yards with freshman quarterback
Chris Miller completing nine of 15 passes.
In an effort to improve its offense, Stanford moved defensive
end Carin Veris from defensive end to tight end. Veris played
two offensive series, and on a goal line play on defense, before
leaving the game with an injury.
"We moved Garin Veris to tight end," Wiggin explained.
"Our plan was to work him on both sides of the football. But
then he got hurt."
Senior Jim Clymer, who started the year at tight end for Stan
ford before getting injured and losing his job, replaced Veris
and had an excellent game, catching five passes for 60 yards to
lead the Cardinal in receiving yardage.
"It (starting Veris) seemed to inspire Jim Clymer to come out
and play with a vengeance," Wiggin said.
Stanford's pass offense overall, however, was erratic and dis-
disappointing. The Cardinal had 200 net pas
sing yards, but three interceptions and several
penalties stopped the Cardinal from mounting
many consistent drives.
Two ot the interceptions thrown by Paye
came on deep passes but, according to Brooks,
that was no coincidence. "We wanted to take
a\\a\ the deep pass," he said.
heshman Marshall Dillard led the Stanford
mnning attack, gaining 61 yards on 12 carries.
In total ottense, Oregon outgained the Car
dinal 151 \ards to U4.
Oregon not on the board first following an

\fter m\ consecutive running plays brought
the ball to the Stanford 5-yard line and the
treshman Wilier was faced with a second and
goal Wilier rolled out left and then tossed the
ball back over the middle to tight end Doug
Herman in the middle of the end/one for the
Duck s nrst score. Oregon placekicker Todd
Lee added the extra point to make the score 7-0
Ducks.
Oregon added a field goal near the start of
the second quarter following a 42-yard pass
receptions bv flanker Lew Barnes who beat Car
dinal cornerback Dwain Hamilton on a deep
streak on the left side.
Five minutes later, the Ducks increased their
lead to 13-0 when Lee hit his second field goal
of the afternoon, a 52-yarder.

Alter immediately stopping the Ducks on
their opening series of the second half, the
Cardinal came out and mounted a 44-yard
scoring drive following a poor punt by Kevin
Hicks.
Stanford tapped the drive with a 5-yard
touchdown run by freshman Thomas Henley
who stored on a right side sweep play, break
ing several tackles in the process.
Following the kickoff by Stanford's Mark
Harmon, the Cardinal again stopped the Ducks
in four plays.
Starting a drive from its own 34, Stanford
drove to the Oregon 9-yard line before
being stopped. With a fourth-and-8 on the
Oregon 9, Harmon attempted a 27-yard
tield goal but missed.
Two critical fourth quarter interceptions
ruined what chance Stanford had of coming
back.
With a third-and-14 from the Oregon 43, Paye
had a pass over the middle intercepted by Duck
linebacker Grant Core who returned the ball
four yards to the Oregon 36-yard line.
Oregon then drove down to the Stanford 22
yard line before Paul Schwabe missed a 39-yard
field goal. A roughing the kicker penalty then
gave the Ducks a first down. Stanford stopped
the Ducks again, driving them back to the 31
with the help of an offensive pass interference
tall. This time the field goal snap was bad and
holder Mike Owens ran for four yards before
being stopped which gave the ball back to Stan
ford.
On its second play, Stanford turned the ball
back over when Paye attempted to go deep to
Mullins and it was intercepted by McCalister
again.
The Ducks then mounted a 48-yard drive cul
minating in a 47-yard tield goal by Schwabe.
