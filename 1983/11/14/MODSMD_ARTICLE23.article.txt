# Gunn High School grad stars for the Ducks

### DAVE DUTCHER 
Danny McCalister probably couldn't have
imagined a better outcome to Saturday's
game.
McCalister intercepted two passes — in
cluding one when Stanford was driving for a
touchdown which would have given it a
one-point, fourth-quarter lead — as Oregon
defeated the Cardinal 16-7.
While McCalister's performance was
good enough to earn himself a game ball,
his play and Oregon's victory held special
meaning as he was playing practically in his
backyard.
McCalister was a standout quarterback at
nearby Cunn High School. His home is even
closer — Palo Alto. After Oregon's victory,
when asked how it felt to return to Palo Alto
and play an important part in a Pac-10 vic
tory, McCalister joyfully slapped his game
ball and responded with a loud, affirmative
expletive.
There were two occasions in Stanford's
loss when Cardinal quarterback John Paye
may have responded with a similar
expletive.
The first was midway through the first

quarter. Paye and the Cardinal were on their
14-yard line facing a third-and-nine situa
tion, and Paye tried to throw deep to
Thomas Henley.
"Emile (Harry) ran a post pattern and the
back (Henley) came out straight and all the
way up the field," McCalister said after the
game. "I jumped on the post pattern, and I
recovered well enough to come back and
get a good break on the ball and I was just
there to make the play."
McCalister returned the interception 19
yards to Stanford's 29-yard line. Seven plays
later, Oregon scored the game's only touch
down to go ahead 7-0.
McCalister's second interception also was
crucial for the Ducks. It came in the fourth
quarter when, trailing 13-7, Stanford was
trying to move the ball down the field for a
go-ahead touchdown with less than six
minutes left. The Cardinal had momentum
because Oregon kicker Paul Schwabe had
just missed a field goal. The momentum did
not last.
On Stanford's second play following the
missed field goal, Paye again looked deep
