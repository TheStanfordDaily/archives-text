# Men don't qualify for nationals
## Women runners take second 
### RICK BILODEAU 
Saturday's District VIII Cross Country
Championships in Corvallis, Ore.,
brought disappointment to both Stanford
teams as the women failed to defend the
title they won easily last year and the men
were forced to end their season
prematurely with a fifth place finish at this
NCAA qualifying meet.
Running in the mud on a rainy Oregon
day, the women's squad was passed by
the hometown Oregon Ducks 33-71.
Kathy Hayes and Lisa Martin led Oregon
to victory with a 1-2 finish.
Despite the second-place finish, the
Card women still advance to the NCAA
Championships a week from today in
Lehigh, Pa., along with Oregon, UC-
Irvine and Washington State.
The Cardinal's dilemma might be des
cribed as "Life without Ceci Hopp." An
Ail-American and the defending District
VIII champion, Hopp was sidelined with a
hip injury, leaving Stanford with only four
strong runners.
Although Cardinal harriers Alison Wiley
placed third, Patti Sue Plumer fourth,
Regina jacobs fifth and Cory Schubert

seventh — al! •' the top 10 — the Cardinal
still lost.
Running fifth for Stanford was Michelle
Mason who, with a foot injury, could
finish no higher than 53rd. But with Hopp
ready for the nationals, as she is expected
to be, the gap between the fourth and
fifth runners should shrink considerably.
The Stanford men's team ended its
season with a lackluster fifth place
showing at Corvallis. Oregon won the
men's title for the second straight year,
followed by Arizona, UCLA and UC-lrvine
— all of which qualified for the NCAAs.
To no one's surprise, the Ducks' |im Hill
won the individual title.
Leading the way for the Card men was
freshman Mark Oleson, who barely
missed qualifying for the NCAAs with his
12th place. The top 11 finishers in the
meet go to Lehigh.
Following Oleson for Stanford were
Charles Alexander in 20th, David Frank in
24th, Jeff Atkinson in 26th and team cap
tain )im Smith in 27th. For Smith, Frank
and Ed Calloway, a trio of seniors, this
was their final cross country race for Stan
ford.
