# Water polo team loses to Cal
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
The No. 1 ranked California
Golden Bears used a decided
talent edge and a superiority
in numbers to pound out a 9-6
victory over the Stanford
water polo team last Friday at
the Spieker Aquatic Complex
in Berkeley.
The loss was Stanford's fifth
in a row after a recent six
game unbeaten string and
dropped the Cardinal to 11-12-
3 and 0-5 in the Pacific-10 Con
ference.
Cal, now ,25-3-2, did not
hesitate to exploit its advan
tages as they used twelve dif
ferent field players in the first
quarter alone, which ended
even at 2-2.
The Cardinal not only faced
six rested and equally talented
substitutes, but also the di
lemma of facing two contrast
ing styles, according to Head
Coach Dante Dettamanti.
"The two units played two
different styles," he ex
plained. "The first unit tried to
overpower us and the other
tried to use quickness and
speed.
"The big difference in the
game was their physical abil
ity — size and speed. (Their
size) hurts guys like Jaime
Velez (the Card's leading
scorer) because he gets
pushed around on offense."
The game statistics bear

Dettamanti out. Stanford
needed a six-on-five man ad
vantage to produce four of its
goals, while California tallied
eight times when the teams
were playing at even strength.
Still, it appeared a slim 4-3
lead was all that the Bears
would take into the halftime
intermission until a controver
sial call awarded Cal its fifth
goal.
Cardinal goalie Steve Moyer
came out of the cage to knock
down a shot on goal and
scooped up the deflection
before the ball washed across
the goal line. The referee ap
parently thought otherwise
however, and Cal suddenly
had a two-goal cushion.
Given some breathing
room, the California offense
opened up and pumped in
two early third period scores
that gave the Bears an insur
mountable 7-3 advantage.
From there, Alan Gresham and
company breezed to their
fourth win in five Pac-10
games.
Gresham led Cal's hot
outside shooters with three
goals and six other Bears
scored as California showed
the great balance and depth
that makes it the nation's
No. 1 team.
"They deserve the No. 1
ranking," Dettamanti ad
mitted. "They were the ag

gressors. We let them dictate
the way the game was going to
go-"
Friday's contest was the first
between the Bay Area rivals
since a 3-3 tie two months ago
and Dettamanti hinted that
things may be different when
the two clubs meet again in

the regular season finale at
Stanford on Big Came Satur
day.
"We have never lost to Cal
in our pool in the last eight
years. I still think we can beat
them, we're just gonna have
to play hard-nosed polo," said
Dettamanti.
