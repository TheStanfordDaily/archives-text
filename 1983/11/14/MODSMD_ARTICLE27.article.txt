# A 						statement from Paul Wiggin
## 
### 
The following is a written state
ment from Stanford Head football
Coach Paul Wiggin made public last
Friday. Athletic Director Andy
Geiger confirmed Friday morning
that Wiggin will coach his last game
this Saturday against UC-Rerkeley,
Stanford's final contest of the 1981
season.
In a recent meeting witli Athletic
Director Andy Geiger it was
decided that it would be in the best
interests of Stanford Football that a
coaching change be made. Andy
and I discussed the disappoint
ments of this season, how these dis
appointments affect the future of
Stanford Football and finally, the in
credible importance of football as it
relates to the Stanford Football Pro
gram.
Probably the most difficult part of
this position for me was that I was
living somewhat of a dual life â€” one
of being the FHead Football Coach
and the other being a loyal alum.
Stanford is my school. It was my
school when I was a young kid from
Lathrop, California, even before I
chose to come here in 1953. And I
always kept in close touch with the
campus and my coach, Chuck
Taylor, during all those years when I
was playing and coaching in the Na
tional Football League. To come
back here as the Head Football
Coach four years ago was the fulfill
ment of a dream, and I will always
cherish that moment as the high
hopes we shared at that time.
Why we have not been more suc

cessful on the field is a question
that has been asked and will con
tinue to be debated by people in
the media and thousands of Stan
ford football fans. Rest assured it
has not been because we didn't
work hard enough or because we
didn't care enough. Perhaps I have
cared too much. Maybe I shared
too many ups and downs with my
players. But I truly care for these
young men that play for me. They
are bright, and by nature in
quisitive. It has been said that the
Stanford football athlete is a differ
ent breed, but believe me, his ob
session for winning and athletic ex
cellence is as important to him as
any other phase of his life. These
are very special young people and
they deserve the very best. We may
not have won as many games as was
expected, but I will guarantee you
that football was an educational ex
perience for each of them, and be

cause of this I will always feel that I
accomplished what I believe to be a
vital responsibility of coaching col
lege football. There was never a
time when we took the Saturday
walk with the team to our stadium
that I did not feel a specialness
about these young people.
The structure of intercollegiate
athletics in these times directs tre
mendous pressure at the head foot
ball coach and his staff. At Stanford
we have some 24 sports and also
sponsor a broad program of in
tramurals and recreation. The
receipts from football must be
maintained at a high level for all
these programs, first to presently
survive and then to hopefully pros
per. So, the financial pressures are
literally transferred to the shoulders
and hearts of the football coaches
and through them to their wives
and children. It is easy to say that
college football is just a game, but it

is more than that to the coaching
families who live it every day and
night of the week, for 52 weeks a
year.
The timing c hoice of this decision
has been left in my hands and I have
chosen to do it at this time. The pur
pose is to enable Andy (Geiger) to
proceed quickly with whatever
steps are necessary to select my
successor. It is most important that
this transition be accomplished as
quickly as possible, so that the
recruiting efforts will not miss a
beat. I have promised both our
President Donald Kennedy and
Andy (Geiger) that I will do every
thing possible to make this change
as easy as I can for all concerned.
The immediate plans are to do
the best job we can in preparing for
Oregon and California. For all the
players and coaches, finding a way
to win these last two would be a
most fitting reward for all the adver
sity we have been through this past
season.
I want to reinforce one last
thought. Stanford is still my school
and I wish nothing but the very best
for whoever undertakes this coach
ing responsibility after me. It is one
of the most unique challenges in
college football, and it is important
for the Stanford family to hang to
gether right now. The new coaches
are going to need all the help and
support we can give them. For all
the things Stanford football stands
for, it is vital that we rally together
and it we do, we can make it work.
