## 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
The Stanford men's soc
cer team tinished its season
by taking a 3-0 beating from
Fresno State Saturdav.
Fresno dominated the
entire game and out
manuevered the Cardinal
with skillful passes and
dribbling. Stanford hardly
looked like the team with
the better record although
it is 12-5-3 while Fresno is
only 12-8.
"Do you believe these
guys (Stanford) actually had
a chance to be in the
playoffs?" Fresno State's
Kevin Williams asked a
fellow player on the bench.
"We're 10 times better than
them." Fresno lost to three
of the top 10 teams in the
nation which might explain
his frustration of not get
ting a chance to be in the
playoffs.
Stantord was out of the
game even before it
started. "Todd Rafalovich
called me this morning and
said he had the flu," Stan
ford Coach Nelson Lodge
said. "Losing him in the
backtield is like losing

(lorge) htinger in the tor
ward line."
This gave Fresno an edge
on offense, which it took
full advantage of by scoring
the three goals. The first
came when Mitch Revera
got a head on the ball
inside the penalty box to
make it 1-0. The second was
banked home by Randy
Prescott from a tree kick 20
yards awav.
The third and final goal
came from a back heeled
pass to Williams who con
nected tor the final score.
Williams , only a freshman,
leads the team in scoring
with nine goals. I should
be starting," Williams said,
"But I guess the coach
thinks I do better coming
off the bench."
Fresno State's Coach
lose Elegado was very
pleased with his team's
performance. "This is how
we should be playing every
game,' he said. "I just wish
we could play this well all
the time. We have been so
temperamental this
season."
