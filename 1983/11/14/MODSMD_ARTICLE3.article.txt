# University lobbies for tuition bill
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL 
Bills dealing with taxation, animal research and fun
ding tor research and development are currently the
legislative issues of prime importance to the University,
according to Larry Horton, director of government rela
tions for the Office of Public Affairs.
One such bill is a tax measure, now pending before
Congress, that could benefit the University's interests
in the areas of tuition remission and charitable giving.
In the current version of the bill, tuition remission, a
fringe benefit offered to faculty and staff that partially
covers college tuition costs for their children, would
continue to be considered non-taxable income.
Because this tax-exempt status is valued by the Uni
versity, and because of concern that drastic alterations
in a part of the bill affecting charitable giving could
"put Stanford out of business," Horton said Stanford
officials have lobbied hard on the measure.
Facing the California Assembly in lanuary will be Sen
ate bill 883, sponsored by state Sen. David Roberti (D-

Los Angeles), which would prohibit the use of pound
animals in research. The measure has already won Sen
ate approval, largely due to the influence of Roberti,
who is the president pro tem of the Senate.
A bill to provide support money for basic research
and development, called the Danforth and Eagleton Ini
tiative, is also pending at the national level and ot inter
est to the University. The initiative, sponsored by Sens.
John Danforth (R-Missouri) and Thomas Eagleton (D-
Missouri), would appropriate funding for facilities and
training, establishing what Horton called an in
frastructure for scientific research.
In pursuing legislative goals, the University directly
employs no lobbyists in either Washington or
Sacramento. Rather, Stanford relies on officials such as
Horton and Kennedy who work actively with organiza
tions like the Association of American Universities,
which is comprised of the top 50 research universities
in the United States.
