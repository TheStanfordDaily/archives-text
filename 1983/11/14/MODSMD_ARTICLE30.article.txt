# Big Game rich in excitement
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
There's the Michigan-Ohio State game,
USC-UCLA and Harvard-Yale. There are
the little Big Games, the Big Big Games.
But there is only one Big Game — Stan
ford and UC-Berkeley — and few people
can deny that it is one of the oldest and
most exciting rivalries in college football.
Last year's contest brought the game
more publicity than usual. While the
game was wild, c razy and certainly excit
ing, it was just one chapter in one of the
closest rivalries in the sport.
I he Big Game has almost always been
close. In fact 40 of the last 85 games have
been decided by seven points or less.
Currently Stanford leads the series with
40 wins compared with 5b victories for Cal
and 10 ties. Even more impressive is that
over all the years, only 21 points separate
the two teams in total points scored, with
the edge going to Stanford.
The first Big Game was played in 1892.
The game started off slowly that year be
cause Stanford manager (and future Presi
dent) Herbert Hoover forgot the football.
When a ball was finally found, the Car
dinal went on to win in what was then
considered to be a major upset.
Between 1892 and 1923, Cal and Stan
ford played 29 times with each team win
ning 12 times. The teams also tied each
other five times during this period.
In 1924, Cal and Stanford played what
was to become a prototype of Big Games
to come.
Both teams entered the game with un
defeated records that year. Before 77,000
fans in newly finished Memorial Stadium,
Cal took a 20-0 lead with just two minutes
to go in the game. But in the game's
closing minutes, Stanford quarterback
Edgar Walker drove Stanford for two
touchdowns in the closing minutes to tie
the game at 20-20 just before the final gun
sounded.
This game also set the precedent of
high-priced scalped tickets as some fans
payed as much as $100 to see the game.
Since 1924, there have been many excit
ing Big Games and both teams have
literally used everything in their
playbooks, and even things not in their
playbooks, in attempts to win.
In 1950, Stanford tied the Pasadena
bound Bears and almost won in the final
seconds as the Indians' All-America end,
Bill McColl, just missed receiver Bob
Bryan on a 01-yard option pass.
The Big Game has always been unpre
dictable. The "may the best team win"
motto just does not fit. As an example,
Stanford has been in the Rose Bowl 11

times and has failed to win four Big
Games during those years while Cal has
twice been upset by Stanford preceding .1
Rose Bowl appearance.
Following are some of the most recent
Cal-Stanford thrillers.
1
—1972: Stanford had a 21-18 lead with
only 1:18 left to play. Unfortunately, a 19-
yard punt return, two pass interference
calls and two completions gave Cal the
ball on the Stanford 8-yard line with only
three seconds left on the clock. Cal fresh
man quarterback Vince Ferragamo, unaf
fected by the pressure, calmly hit tight
end Steve Sweeney on the next play to
clinch the victory.
—1974: Ranks as one of the most excit
ing games in the series. Stanford took a
19-10 lead with 7:36 left to play after com
ing back from a 10-3 deficit. The Bears
fought back, kicking a field goal and then
scoring the apparent winning touchdown
with just 26 seconds left. But the Cardinal
did not give up. Or to misquote current
Cal Coach )oe Kapp, the Cardinal color
would not die. Stanford quarterback Guy
Benjamin completed two quick passes of
18 and 25 yards and then Mike Langford
came in to kick the winning 50 yard field
goal.
—1976: The Cardinal played this one

tor Coach Jack Christiansen, fired the day
before the game. Cal led 24-19 when with
2:20 remaining, Cal's Marky Crane
fumbled the ball on the Bear 2-yard line.
Duncan McColl recovered for Stanford
and two plays later Ron Inge scored the
winning touchdown on a 1-yard plunge,
giving Stanford a 27-24 victory.
—1979: Cal took a 21-14 lead with only
7:49 remaining in the game. Stantord,
however, mounted a last minute drive
and tinally had a fourth-and-goal on the
Cal 1-yard line with only 40 seconds
remaining. Card quarterback Turk
Schonert tried a rollout pass in the
closing seconds but it fell incomplete,
giving Cal the victory.
—1980: Stanford went in smelling
peaches (a strong candidate for the Peach
Bowl) but left a loser as the highly favored
Cardinal lost 28-23 to the Golden Bears.
Stanford tried to mount one final drive
but John Elway's final pass attempt to Ken
Margerum fell incomplete with no time
remaining.
—1982: Enough said. Anyone who was
there already knows. Everybody else has
already heard about it. Read the fake Dai
ly Cal which came out Wednesday follow
ing the game for the account of what
should have happened.
