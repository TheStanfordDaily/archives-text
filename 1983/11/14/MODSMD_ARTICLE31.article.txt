The name of opinions column au
thor Gary Harrison was incorrectly
spelled Gary Alami in last Friday's
edition. The Daily regrets the error.
It was also incorrectly reported
last Friday that the Big Game rally
will start at Pier 23 in San Francisco
and that the rally monitors were
hired. In fact, the rally monitors are
volunteers and the march will start
at Pier 35.
