Seoul to the airport. Reagan rode in an armored
limousine with South Korean President Chun Doo

of Air Force One by Chun.
South Korean military forces lined the perimeter

of the airport, standing sentry at 10-yard intervals.
The departure ceremony was held in front ot a huge
banner erected at the airport terminal with pictures
of Reagan and Chun and the American and South
Korean flags.
Two Korean children suffering trom congenital
heart defects were the guests of Reagan and his wife
Nancy on Air Force One of the trip back. The
children, who will undergo open-heart surgery in
New York, boarded the plane with the president and
Mrs. Reagan.

Chun said he had ordered artillery gunners to stand
ready to fire if necessary to protect Reagan during
his unprecedented trip yesterday into the
demilitarized zone 30 miles north of Seoul. The
DMZ, 2.4 miles wide and 151 miles long, divides
