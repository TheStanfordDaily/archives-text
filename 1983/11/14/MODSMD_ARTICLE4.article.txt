Reagan ends Asian trip
Seoul, South Korea — President Reagan wrapped
up his Asian journey today, heading back for the
United States amid tresh signs of tension on the
Korean peninsula and with the White House arguing
that human rights problems in the south must be
measured against the military threat from the north.
Tens of thousands of flag-waving Koreans lined
the streets of Reagan's long motorcade route out of
Seoul to the airport. Reagan rode in an armored
limousine with South Korean President Chun Doo
hwan. At the airport, Reagan got a brass band send
off and was escorted down a red carpet to the steps
of Air Force One by Chun.
South Korean military forces lined the perimeter

of the airport, standing sentry at 10-yard intervals.
The departure ceremony was held in front ot a huge
banner erected at the airport terminal with pictures
of Reagan and Chun and the American and South
Korean flags.
Two Korean children suffering trom congenital
heart defects were the guests of Reagan and his wife
Nancy on Air Force One of the trip back. The
children, who will undergo open-heart surgery in
New York, boarded the plane with the president and
Mrs. Reagan.
Earlier, as Reagan prepared to leave the country,
Chun said he had ordered artillery gunners to stand
ready to fire if necessary to protect Reagan during
his unprecedented trip yesterday into the
demilitarized zone 30 miles north of Seoul. The
DMZ, 2.4 miles wide and 151 miles long, divides
North and South Korea.
Honduras exercises set for Nov. 18
Washington — It will look, U.S. officials admit, a
bit like a rerun of last month's invasion of Grenada:
more than 800 Marines landing on the beaches of
northern Honduras, storming ashore less than 200
miles from the borders of leftist-ruled Nicaragua.
The landing, scheduled for Nov. 18, is only a mili
tary exercise, not an invasion. However, it is also
part of a concerted show of American military and
political force that appears to have Nicaragua's
leaders worried — and that is just what the Reagan
administration wanted.
Hoping to turn their success in Grenada to advan
tage in Central America, U.S. diplomats are spread
ing the message that there was a sharp lesson for
Nicaragua in the Caribbean operation: "If they had
any doubts about our willingness to use force under
certain circumstances, those doubts should be
erased," a State Department official said.
The United States is also working to strengthen a
military alliance among three of Nicaragua's pro-
U.S. neighbors — Honduras, Guatemala and El Sal
vador — and is considering increases in covert aid to
Nicaraguan anti-government guerrilla groups.
The object of the U.S. pressure, administration of
ficials said, is not to bring down Nicaragua's Sandi
nista regime — an idea they dismiss as unrealistic —
but to push the Nicaraguans toward more flexibility
in negotiations with other Central American
countries.
Reagan makes arms gesture
Washington — President Reagan has decided to
refine the latest U.S. arms-control proposal in one
last effort to narrow differences with Moscow before
nev\ American missile deployments begin in Europe
next month and before the Soviets walk out of the
arms talks in Geneva.
Administration officials said yesterday that the key
ingredient of the new U.S. plan is to propose a spe
cific "global" limitation of 420 nuclear warheads for
each side on medium-range missiles deployed in
Europe and Asia.
The officials said that word of the president's deci
sion, made in consultation with U.S. allies in
Europe, has just gone out to those allies and that
new instructions have been sent to Ambassador Paul
Nitze, the chief U.S. negotiator at the intermediate
nuclear force (INF) talks in Geneva dealing with
medium-ranae nuclear missiles.

The new administration plan, which officials
describe as "an elaboration" of an earlier proposal,
will be laid out by Nitze in Geneva this week.
This will come just before a crucial debate and
vote on the missile question in the West German
Bundestag, or parliament, scheduled for Nov. 21-22.
In a speech before the United Nations in Septem
ber, Reagan offered a significant modification of ear
lier U.S. plans. The president essentially said the
Soviets could have a larger total number of medium
range missiles than the United States in Europe and
Asia, but that there must be parity in the missile
forces of the two superpowers facing each other in
Europe.
Elections held in Peru
Lima, Peru — Left-wing and center-left parties
scored major victories in Peru's municipal elections
yesterday and President Fernando Belaunde Terry's
centrist government conceded defeat.
Prime Minister Fernando Schwalb said the opposi
tion has triumphed in elections that he said were
clean and orderly because of massive security pro
vided by the armed forces and police.
Although guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path
movement had vowed to disrupt the nation-wide
voting, there were no reports of violence at the
polls.
Last night, after the polls had closed, there were
eight explosions near the Lima headquarters of the
United Left Coalition, but no casualties were re
ported. A police official said the blasts caused some
damage and four suspects were arrested.
Alfonso Barrantes, United Left's mayoral can
didate in Lima, was running well ahead of his oppo
nents for that key post and Schwalb acknowledged
his expected victory. "I hope Alfonso Barrantes will
comply with his responsibilities," Schwalb told
reporters.
He made his comments with 60 percent of the
vote counted and unofficial results showing a stiff
rebuff to Belaunde's Popular Action Party.
Peruvian Public Opinion (POP), an independent
polling organization, showed Barrantes snaring 33
percent of the vote in Lima and the center-left Social
Democrats ahead in most other areas with 38 per
cent.
