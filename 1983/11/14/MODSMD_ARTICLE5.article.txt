# Demotion in GSB causes controversy

### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
On May 24, 1982 Martha Ashmon was
demoted two levels from senior librarian to as
sociate librarian at the Jackson Library in the
Graduate School of Business (GSB).
She says her pay has been "frozen" since
then.
Her boss, Bela Gallo, the director of the Jack
son Library, disagrees. He says she was given a
position commensurate to her duties and says
her performance on the job is responsible for
the fact that she hasn't received a raise since her
grievance started.
The controversy between Ashmon and Gallo
helps to illustrate librarian grievance procedure
and the process' problems and advantages.
As a result of her grievance Ashmon has been
restored to her former position as senior libra
rian. But she is unhappy because, she says, her
duties do not befit her rank.

According to Ashmon, her problems started
when Gallo was promoted to the position of
director from his post as senior librarian. Ash
mon at the time was the other senior librarian.
Since that time, she says, she has been
harassed by memos from Gallo, placed in a
job with which she is unfamiliar and unhappy
and subjected to pressures that have led her to
see psychiatrists.
Gallo and others who have been involved
with Ashmon's case, however, see the story an
other way. The problem, said Gallo, is that
"there have been continuing issues concerning
(her) performance," but he refused to cite any
specific problems.
Despite these charges of poor performance,
her demotion in May, 1982 was an administra
tive reassessment of her duties, said Gallo, and
not a reprimand. Gallo said he determined she
performed duties appropriate to the title of as
sociate librarian so he reduced her rank to that

level.
He disputes Ashmon's claim that her pay was
frozen. She received a notice that her salary
from that point on would be subject to her per
formance, but at no time was her salary
"frozen," he said.
All of his salary decisions are reviewed and
approved by both the dean of the business
school and the provost's office, according to
Gallo.
Ashmon's grievance process began May 25,
1982, when she filed the complaint against both
Gallo and Paul Johnson, an associate dean at the
GSB who oversees the library.
Dale Canelas, the associate director of public
services for the libraries, was asked by the
provost's office to act as hearing officer for the
case.
Ashmon said she had problems finding both
an assistant to help her in the hearing and wit-
