# Demotion in GSB causes controversy
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
On May 24, 1982 Martha Ashmon was
demoted two levels from senior librarian to as
sociate librarian at the Jackson Library in the
Graduate School of Business (GSB).
She says her pay has been "frozen" since
then.
Her boss, Bela Gallo, the director of the Jack
son Library, disagrees. He says she was given a
position commensurate to her duties and says
her performance on the job is responsible for
the fact that she hasn't received a raise since her
grievance started.
The controversy between Ashmon and Gallo
helps to illustrate librarian grievance procedure
and the process' problems and advantages.
As a result of her grievance Ashmon has been
restored to her former position as senior libra
rian. But she is unhappy because, she says, her
duties do not befit her rank.

According to Ashmon, her problems started
when Gallo was promoted to the position of
director from his post as senior librarian. Ash
mon at the time was the other senior librarian.
Since that time, she says, she has been
harassed by memos from Gallo, placed in a
job with which she is unfamiliar and unhappy
and subjected to pressures that have led her to
see psychiatrists.
Gallo and others who have been involved
with Ashmon's case, however, see the story an
other way. The problem, said Gallo, is that
"there have been continuing issues concerning
(her) performance," but he refused to cite any
specific problems.
Despite these charges of poor performance,
her demotion in May, 1982 was an administra
tive reassessment of her duties, said Gallo, and
not a reprimand. Gallo said he determined she
performed duties appropriate to the title of as
sociate librarian so he reduced her rank to that

level.
He disputes Ashmon's claim that her pay was
frozen. She received a notice that her salary
from that point on would be subject to her per
formance, but at no time was her salary
"frozen," he said.
All of his salary decisions are reviewed and
approved by both the dean of the business
school and the provost's office, according to
Gallo.
Ashmon's grievance process began May 25,
1982, when she filed the complaint against both
Gallo and Paul Johnson, an associate dean at the
GSB who oversees the library.
Dale Canelas, the associate director of public
services for the libraries, was asked by the
provost's office to act as hearing officer for the
case.
Ashmon said she had problems finding both
an assistant to help her in the hearing and wit-
nesses for this hearing. She blamed
the first problem on the fact that no
other librarian would or could help
her, and her choice of assistants
outside of this catagory was limited
by the grievance process.
She said witnesses had problems
testifying for her because they had
to take time off work.
Asst. Provost Keith Smith, who
advised her on selec ting her assis
tant, disputed this, saying that he
told Ashmon her assistant could be
anyone on the Academic Staff,
which includes librarians, research
assistants and teaching staff.
Atter the hearing Canelas sum
marized her findings and made sug
gestions on the case in a report to
Eugene Webb, associate dean of the
GSB, who represented the GSB
dean.

Webb would not comment on the
case because of ethical considera
tions, except to summarize the case
by saying that "at each level (dean of
GSB, provost, president) there have
been findings against her."
According to Gallo, Webb found
nothing inappropriate with Gallo's
actions on Ashmon's salary, except
to emphasize that there should be
no implication that Ashmon's salary
was frozen.
In February, 1983 Ashmon filed a
grievance at the next level, to the
provost's office. Asst. Provost
Cecilia Burciaga was assigned the
case and upheld Webb's ruling.
Again dissatisfied, Ashmon ap
pealed for the second time, this
time to the president's office, where
Robin Hamill, the director of
housing and transportation services,
was assigned the case, according to
both Ashmon and Smith. This oc
curred around May of this year, al
though none of the participants

could place the exact date.
According to Gallo, the presi
dent's office ruled that the process
"was considered to be correct."
Ashmon now works in the techni
cal services department most of the
time and very little on the reference
desk â€” which she refers to as her
specialty. She says she is caught in a
vicious circle, because she is being
evaluated at a job for which she is ill
prepared.
But Gallo, and those who handled
Ashmon's grievance, have said they
feel differently. "The type of narrow
specialization which she implies is
not reality," said Gallo, who says
she "could not fulfill her previous
assignments" but has a chance to do
so in her current job.
Although Ashmon did not discuss
her future plans, she apparently
ruled out leaving the library.
"Where can I go after 14 years?,"
she said.
