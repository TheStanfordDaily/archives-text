# Saudi power overestimated, says Israeli
## 
### STEVE LEBOVITZ 
The United States has overes
timated Saudi Arabia's influence in
the Mideast, a Tel Aviv University
professor told a small audience at
Florence Moore Hall Friday.
Prof. Jacob Goldberg, addres
sing the topic of the Saudi
Arabian factor in Mideast politics,
focused on the implications of what
he termed the "inherent weakness"
of Saudi Arabia. He also discussed
the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) and the current situation
in Lebanon.
Goldberg, a guest professor this

year at George Washington Univer
sity, spoke at a lunch discussion
sponsored by Overseas Studies. He
is the head of the Saudi Arabia,
Yemen and South Yemen desks at
the Shiloah Center, the foremost
political think tank in Israel.
Because of its enormous wealth,
Saudi Arabia is'generally thought to
be a major political force in the
Middle East. But Goldberg main
tained that events in recent years
have shown that financial wealth
does not imply political power.
While the United States has made
Saudi Arabia crucially important to

the Middle East peace process,
Goldberg said, "Saudi Arabia has
failed repeatedly to pressure Arab
states to do things."
Using a current example,
Goldberg pointed out that Saudi
Arabian pressure has failed to force
Syria to withdraw its forces from
Lebanon. He explained that Saudi
Arabia has had the resources to
finance a majority of Syrian pur
chases of Soviet arms, but said that
"this money is wrongly perceived as
a source of power."
Rather, he said, it is "protection
money" that buys the Saudis immu

nity from subversive activities. For
example, the PLO has refrained
from terrorism in Saudi Arabia large
ly because of financial grants from
the Saudi government, Goldberg
said.
Goldberg answered several ques
tions on the PLO and the recent
mutiny against Palestinean leader
Yasser Arafat. He maintained that
the revolt resulted from Arafat's fail
ure to meet a series of challenges to
the PLO such as dependence on
Syria and internal unity.
"After the Israeli war in Lebanon,
the PLO was at a crossroads, having
lost its last territorial base to launch
attacks against Israel," Goldberg
stated.
Another source of PLO problems
is Syria, which "has been trying
since 1974 to control the PLO,"
Goldberg said. He said he does not
feel that Arafat will succumb to
Syrian demands for greater control
of the PLO and "become a Syrian

puppet." Goldberg said Syria
represents the major obstacle to
peace in the region.
"Syria has never had an ambassa
dor in Beirut and continues to refer
to Israel and Jordan as Southern
Syria," Goldberg said. He also said
the Soviet Union has recently placed
top-grade, air-to-air and surface-to
air missiles in Syria â€” "the first time
such missiles have been placed out
of Eastern Europe."
In addition, Goldberg gave a
detailed explanation of the inherent
weakness of the Saudi Arabian go

vernment. "For all practical
purposes, Saudi Arabia is sur
rounded by enemies or hostile
forces." These forces include the
Soviet presence in Afghanistan and
the fundamentalist Khommeni
regime in Iran, which is "seeking to
undermine the religious legitimacy"
of the Saudi Arabian ruling family,
Goldberg said.
Moreover, Goldberg maintains
that a paradox exists because in the
face of so many enemies, Saudi
Arabia has a very small army of only
55,000 men.
