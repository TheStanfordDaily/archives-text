### HENRY CHEN 
The sight of colorful Filipino
costumes and the aroma of exotic
Oriental food were part of the at
mosphere Friday night at the East
Asian Studies Theme (F.AST)
House's first anniversary celebra
tion.
Over 250 people attended the
gala celebration, which was or
ganized to help this year's resi
dents get to know one another
and to promote EAST House and
its theme around campus, accor
ding to resident fellow Kay
Sandberg-Abe.
"So many people partici
pated," Sandberg-Abe said. "At
least half the house was involved
in some way or another."
The celebration began with a
large reception at which Japanese
sushi, fried pork rinds, almond
and fortune cookies and many
other Oriental hors d'ouevres
and desserts were served.
"It was really fun helping out
with the (food) preparations for
our anniversary celebration, "
said Mary )ue, a second-year resi
dent at EAST. "I learned how to
make sushi, and I used to think
that it was a difficult process.
Other people helped make won
ton and it was great to see every
one working so hard together."

Immediately after the recep
tion, several demonstrations
were held to acquaint the guests
with some of the unique East
Asian customs. Wendy Wong and
Nancy Sato of the Center for East
Asian Studies performed
lapanese papercutting, while stu
dents Masumi Abe and Tom
Ffwang demonstrated the art of

calligraphy. Spectators also had
an opportunity to participate in
the demonstrations.
The highlight of the evening
came when Filipiania, a Filipino
dancing group, showcased a vari
ety of dance techniques in front
of a crowd of approximately 150
people. In addition Melanie

Brown gave a musical reci
tal with a koto, a unique Japanese
string instrument.
"The Filipino (lancers were an
overwhelming success," said Susan
Alexander, a theme associate at
EAST House and the organizer of the
anniversary celebration. "It was a
wonderful opportunity for us to
present to the Stanford community
part of a culture that most of us are
unaware of."

Alexander went on to emphasize
the success of the event as a whole.
"Most important, I think, was the
tact that we were able to involve so
many members ot the house in this
event," she said. "The papercutting
and calligraphy demonstrations
were all well-attended, and I think
everyone had an educational yet en
joyable experience."
Other people expressed similar
feelings. Kim Muth, a freshman
living in Lagunita, said, "I had a
friend visiting from Chico and she
was very impressed by all the cul
tural activities."
