- Compi'ed trorr tie a:ed P'ess and the Los *r,k>ee* T .nies\\j»h ngt n Po«' se'v e-and The Sew V TTies -

A mood of uncertaintv seems to
characterize the end of \uri
Andropov's first term as Soviet presi
dent, and the 69-vear-o!d leader s
tai!ure to attend the annual Re.olu
tion Dav parade in Moscow have
tnggered -erious concerns about hi>»
health.
The Revolution Dav paraae con
>t.tutes the centra ritual or the So
viet -tate. Western observers have
repeatedlv noted that Andropov s
predecessor, Leonid Brezhnev
ri:mbed the steps to the reviewing
-rand atop Lenin - tomb and stood
an hour in treezing weather to
watch the parade Brezhnev died
three da\s later.
"A cold, a tangible sense ot trou
ble <>wept through Moscow in the
wake ot Andropov's absence trom
the parade that commemorates the
66th anmversan. ot the ousting or
the czar bv the Bolsheviks. Serge
Schmemann said in a Sew York
Times article v esterdav.
Analysts ;nside the Soviet Union
have also noted that Brezhnev, in
contrast to his two predecessors,
continues to enjov a limited role in
the Soviet pantheon.
The giant posters portraving
Brezhnev as hero ot the Soviet
Union have long come down. He is
no longer quoted in public
speeches. The New York Times said.
But the official partv newspaper
Pravda called attention to the an
niversary of Brezhnev s death,
describing him as an outstanding
figure of the Communist Partv ana
the Soviet state and of the interna
tional communist movement.''
In contrast to Stalin and
krushchev. Sovietologists note that
Brezhnev continues to maintain a
relatively conspicuous position in
Soviet societv — a position perhaps
best preserved by the manuractur
mg city or Brezhnev and the nuclear
powered icebreaker Leonid
Brezhnev.
