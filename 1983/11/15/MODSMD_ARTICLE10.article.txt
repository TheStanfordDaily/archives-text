## The
						Stanford Daily Bowing out with class 
### 
The departure of football Coach Paul Wiggin
was expected and necessary, but he deserves
high praise for his devotion to Stanford and his
impact on the players, both on and off the
field. We will always look back on Wiggin as a
tough fighter and a sincere and dedicated man.
We also look forward to a rejuvenation of Stan
ford's football program.
According to his players, Wiggin was an out
standing teacher and person. He taught them
not to quit, and he showed them himself by
refusing to resign until now. Wiggin was a fa
ther figure to his players, and he has earned
their everlasting respect. Said fullback Rob
Moore: "If I have a kid and Paul Wiggin is
coaching somewhere, I'd like to have him plav
there." Wiggin has earned the nation's respect
as well. CBS called him "the nicest coach you'll
ever meet or play for."
Wiggin excelled in aspects of the coaching
job that are too often underemphasized in in
tercollegiate athletics — care for his plavers,
loyalty to the school, a high standard of
decency. We hope these traits are carried on
by Stanford's football program, as thev will be

by the players who worked under Wiggin.
Winning is also important, though, both for
alumni and school spirit and for the rest of the
Athletic Department which depends on foot
ball for financial support. Those who say Stan
ford is too small or too academic to have a win
ning football team have short memories — un
der John Ralston in the early 1970s and Bill
Walsh in 1977-78, Stanford went to four bowl
games and consistently beat top-ranked teams.
Stanford needs a successful coach who will
put the team back on the winning track. There
are many attractive possibilities: 49ers assistant
Paul Hackett, San jose State Coach Jack Elway
and UC-Davis Coach Jim Sochor to name a few.
We look toward to the naming of Wiggin's suc
cessor and an exciting team next year.
In the meantime, there is an important game
left this season. An emotional Big Game win
would be a fitting tribute to an outstanding
man who has dedicated himself to his players
and this universitv. We know the coach does
not like hearing it, but how sweet it would be
tor the team to win one for Wiggin.
