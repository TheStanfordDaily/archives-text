# No butts about it
## 
### 
The smoke creeps slowly in your direction;
you dread its approach. It arrives: Your eyes
begin to burn, your nose starts to itch and your
stomach turns.
Later in the day, you pass a neighboring
desk, look down and become repulsed by the
butt-filled ashtray — or worse yet, the soft
drink can decorated with cigarette remnants.
Such unpleasant situations have bothered
non-smokers in the workplace for years. That is
why we commend the voters of San Francisco
for passing Proposition P.
The legislation requires employers in the
private workplace to provide accommodations
for both smokers and non-smokers. If those
who don't take part in the puffing still aren't
pleased, then the employer is faced with the
responsibility of saying "No" to smoking in the
office.
The proposition was put on the ballot by op
ponents of the same law which was put on the
legal books in June, in an effort to remove the

legislation. Those against the measure in
cluded smokers, members of the tobacco in
dustry and others — many of whom are
smokers, by best guess — who claimed the
rule is overly harsh.
The law may be tough on employers who will
at times be put in the middleman position and
it will unquestionably prompt displeasure and
inconvenience for some smokers. But concern
for the health and comfort of non-smokers is
the real issue. Should those who don't partake
be asked to breathe unhealthy air simply be
cause their colleagues have chosen to partake
in a nasty habit?
Smoking has been proven to be a
preventable cause of death. It causes lung can
cer and has been linked to cancers of the
mouth and bladder, heart disease and harden
ing of the arteries. In many cases, it leads to an
early death — one with a cause, one that could
have been prevented.
