## Peace must end the arms race 
### 
President Reagan has a name for
the MX missile — "Peacekeeper."
He means to say that the purpose of
nuclear weapons is to maintain
peace. He believes that nuclear
deterrence has kept peace between
the major world powers since 1945.
Has it? Maybe, if you define world
peace as the absence of world war.
But peace is no more an absence
than light is the absence of dark
ness, and peace is not the prevailing
condition in today's world. The
prevailing condition is terror.
Each of us, to one extent or an
other, suppresses the terror. We kid
ourselves that a world containing
50,000 nuclear weapons is a normal,
reasonable, peaceful world. We kid
ourselves that such a world can con
tinue to exist, tomorrow and tomor
row and tomorrow, without those
weapons being used. We kid our
selves that living 30 minutes away
from vaporization, every moment of
our lives, is living in peace.
Take a piece of paper and a felt-tip
pen and make 6000 dots on the
paper. To keep track, rule the paper
into a hundred squares, 60 dots per
square. Don't just imagine it, do it.
It takes about 10 miniitpv

Paranoid govern
ments, like paranoid
people, do violent
things. Is it sound
foreign policy to
back a paranoid ad
versary into a cor
ner?

Each dot represents the total
firepower exploded on all sides
during World War 11, including the
two atomic bombs dropped on
japan. This total is three megatons.
Today, the United States and the So
viet Union have ready-to-launch nu
clear weapons with a total firepower
of 18,000 megatons, the equivalent
of 6000 World War lis, 6000 dots.
Slightly more than half the weapons
belong to the United States, slightly
under half to the Soviet Union.
Two of our Poseidon submarines
carry a total of 18 megatons, six dots
on the page. This is enough
firepower to destroy every large and
medium-sized city in the Soviet
Union. An equal amount of Soviet
firepower could destroy 200 cities in
the United States. Six dots.
Our Trident submarines carry 24
megatons, eight dots. As we con
tinue to build them, add eight dots
every eight months. Add another
eight dots for the Soviet counter
svstem. If the MX missile system is

built, add 200 dots. Add 200 more
for the Soviets.
This isn't peacekeeping, it's in
sanity. And the insanity isn't simply
the numbers and power of the
weapons but their kind. The most
recent systems on both sides are not
deterrent but first-strike weapons.
On both sides the pressure is
toward launch.

Eight minutes is not
long enough to de
termine whether a
radar blip is a missile
or a flock of snow
geese.

Next month, our Pershing II
missiles are scheduled for deploy
ment in Western Europe. They will
be capable of leveling Moscow eight
minutes after firing. Eight minutes is
not long enough to determine whe
ther a radar blip is a missile or a
flock of snow geese. A computer
will decide. The pressure is toward
launch, and our lives as we sit in
class and eat lunch at Tresidder and
bicycle through Palo Alto will
depend upon the quality of Soviet
electronics.
The shooting down of the Korean
airliner doesn't confirm that the
Soviets are bestial or evil, though
their leadership, like ours, partakes
of those qualities, it confirms that
above all they're afraid, to the point
of paranoia. Paranoid governments,
like paranoid people, do violent
things. Is it sound foreign policy to
back a paranoid adversary into a cor
ner? Is it sound national defense to
indulge our own fears, our own
paranoia, to the point where we are
just as dangerous as our adversary?
Nuclear war seems remote. We
don't see the missiles. They are hid
den in silos and submarines and
bomber holds. We don't have to
think about them. Men such as
Reagan and Andropov, we assume,
even though we deplore their
policies, must have a fundamental
core of common sense and
humanity that will keep their fingers
off the buttons.
So we tell ourselves. But nuclear
war seems remote only because it
hasn't happened. If it happens— if
we allow it to happen — it will be
immediate and total. It will be the
only reality, and the world we take
for granted, today, this second, will
be irretrievably remote.
Peace is something better than
terror. Though it doesn't exist be
tween the United States and the So

viet Union, peace is something we
know. In our relationships with fam
ily and friends, in our daily lives at
Stanford, in chatting with the
grocery clerk or sharing a bus ride,
most of us are part of many ongoing
communities of peace. We are
nurtured by peace, we are quiet
wagers of peace. The American
people and the Soviet people,
despite their fears and the misin
formation spread by their govern
ments, desire peace.
I don't know how we get it. But I
know it won't come from a missile,
by any name. It won't come from
the rhetoric of hatred. It won't come
from governments. It will come
from the risks of trust rather than
the risks of fear. It will come from
renewed appreciation for the simple
miracle of earth and our diverse
conscious presence on earth. If it
comes, it will come from us.
