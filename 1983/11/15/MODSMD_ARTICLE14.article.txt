# Living in a vacuum

In the smoke billowing from oneof the currently bur
ning issues on campus there drifts this flat assertion by
a political science professor "If and when (my view of
matters fails to prevail), Stanford will be known as a
place to get a good conservative education, not a good
education." Such an apocalyptic note harmonizes nice
ly with the tone of Stanford undergraduate education,
which emanates from this implicit assumption: A con
servative or fully traditional education is at best un
desirable and certainly inferior to the local status quo.
The centuries of wisdom stacked against this assump
tion demand a moment's attention from those who are
paying so much to support it.
In centuries before ours, both here and abroad,
higher education was seen as grounded in sets of prin
ciples from which wisdom was to be taught by the pro
fessors. They varied from college to college, offering a
variety of philosophical premises upon which one
might encounter human knowledge. (The Eucharest
was one hot topic.) Members of the college community
were free to disagree even in radical ways, yet there
remained a boundary around disputes: a single, abso
lute Truth which it was the job of the university to em
body and impart Disagreements were resolved in dis
covery of this Truth, or were continued in view of it.
Ours is obviously a university of a different stripe;
there are more philosophical truths here than there are
dialects in New York, and they are equally incongruous
and bewildering to the unaccustomed. Is, then, the ab
sence of a set of explicit, codified and consistent prin
ciples — a view of human nature, a definition of man's
relation to God —an advantage or a central void? Have
we been intellectually freed or summarily cheated?
One of the larger intellectuals of the 19th century,
F.D. Maurice, observed that "the man who shall bring a
set of youths together, and shall form them into one
body without teaching them, whether they like it or
not, what the bond of their fellowship is and in what
way they are to feel that they are a fellowship, is little
better than a madman." When a university collects
minds but does not guide them fully and rightly, they
stray, and chaos quickly follows.
"I observed in America," wrote T.S. Eliot in 1940,
"that with a very high level of intelligence among un
dergraduates, progress was impeded by the fact that
one could never assume that any two, unless they had
been at the same school under the influence of the
same masters at the same moment, had studied the
same subjects or read the same books, though the
number of subjects which they had studied was surpris
ing. Even with a smaller amount of total information, it
might have been better if they had read fewer, but the
same books."
"In a negative liberal society," he continued, "you
have no agreement as to there being any body of
knowledge which any educated person should have ac
quired at any particular stage: The idea of wisdom dis
appears, and you get sporatic and unrelated ex
perimentation." Eliot's critique explains not only a
source of difficulty for Stanford dinner-table conversa
tion, but the larger intellectual problem of incom
prehensiveness as well.

Perhaps the greatest modern educational theorist,
John Henry Cardinal Newman, insisted the same. "If,"
reads one friendly critique of Newman, "you cannot
assume this degree of common agreement, then all you
will produce is mere specialists or victims of mass com
munication: illiberal men and illiberal communities.
'Excellence,' says Newman, 'implies a centre.' "
The task of establishing that "centre" was clear to
Newman: "I want to destroy that diversity of centres
which puts everything into confusion by creating a con
trariety of influences." The result is an explicitly consis
tent faculty — all Marxists, Catholics or libertarians, for
instance — who will often differ, but not fundamental
ly. The students then will acquire a comprehensive ac
quaintance with the body of thought. The fearful will
cry that this is medieval (quite true) and obsolete (quite
the contrary), without noting that this ethnic character
ized education is virtually all centuries except the last
one or two.
That Stanford differs from this is obvious but also
serious. When a student studies one subject with the
perspective of his or her orthodox Creek professor and
then one closely related under the tutelage of a Mar
xist, neither view predominates, but seem persuasive,
and the student can only conclude that all things can be
true: "There is no singular consistency, because I am
not being led to see it." "Well, basically I've learned that
history can be used to prove anything," a senior history
major recently told me. Is this obvious error the histori
cal ethic Stanford prefers?
Human behavior is immediately affected since, as
George Will writes, "all education is moral education
because learning conditions conduct." University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy's effort to inculcate a sense o<
public service in students is noble, but irresolute: It is
not supported by any ethics fundamental to the Univer
sity and the students; wisdom is reduced to mere ad
vice and falls on largely unguided, hence unwilling,
ears.
That "excellence implies a centre" is nothing new
even to our quoted political science professor, one of
whose bedfellows in protest told me that he agreed ful
ly with Newman's thought and would center a univer
sity around his own liberal truths. What is so dangerous
about the myth of a truly liberal university is that it will
not succeed; young minds, no matter how competi
tive, are unfit to shop wisely among a variety of
philosophies if not guided and, more often than not,
will simply agree with whomever is the most persuasive
or convenient. The liberal university — one which is
"objective" — becomes one which professes to have
collected various truths for the sampling but which
quietly undermines adherence by insisting that all can
be true, at least partially — sound familiar?
To note the extraordinary confusion around us is not
to advocate an immediate purge, but rather to inform
the student. If you are here in search of the traditional
idea of wisdom —of a comprehensive, consistent scaf
folding of philosophical or theological truths upon
which to arrange all knowledge in an orderly fashion —
Stanford has on ly this to say; You are on your own.
