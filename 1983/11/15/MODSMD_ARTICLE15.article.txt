GPB legislation
In response to the Nov. 9 Daily
article concerning legislation on the
Guest Professorship Bureau, the
ASSU Senate would like to issue the
following clarifications.
The bylaws of the CPB were
modified at the senate meeting of
Nov. 8 to enable courses offered by
the bureau to receive University

accreditation. For this purpose, a
bill was prepared by the rules com
mittee after discussion with Univer
sity officials. SWOPSI, Undergrade
ate Specials and other extra
departmental programs were never
a focus of these discussions. The
bill did not allow accredited CPB
courses to be originated through
extradepartmental channels.
On the afternoon of the Senate
meeting, the Senate received a set

of suggested amendments from
Carolyn L.ougee, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences. Her
amendment concerning accredita
tion through extradepartmental
programs changed only the wor
ding and in no way modified the
effect of the clause.
The Daily suggested that the
central theme of debate on this
issue was the value of ex
tradepartmental programs at Stan

ford. Ihis is an inaccurate represen
tation of the senate's discussion. It
was not the purpose of the senate,
in enacting this bill, to belittle
SWOPSI, UGS or other ex
tradepartmental programs offered
on campus.
