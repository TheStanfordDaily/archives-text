## Reviews and critiques of U.S. invasion of Grenada Reagan made truth the first casualty 
### 
The official explanations of why
we invaded Grenada prove again
that when strong nations commit ag
gression against weak ones, truth is
usually the first casualty.
President Reagan and U.N. Am
bassador jeanne Kirkpatrick claim it
was not an invasion but a "rescue
operation." But if that were true,
why did our 5000 troops remain to
"mop up" after all the Americans
students in Grenada were
evacuated? Why, before the inva
sion, did President Reagan ignore at
least two offers by the Grenadian
government to let the students leave
safely? And why did we order LIAT
airlines to cancel its arrangement to
fly out Canadian and British nation
als after the Grenadian government
had given its permission for the
flight?
President Reagan said the United
States invaded Grenada to "restore
law and order." But according to
CIA chief William Casey our real in
tention was to warn Nicaragua that it
was "not immune to invasion."
Which is the real reason?
The president also said we were
acting at the request of the Organi
zation of East Caribbean states. Was
it only coincidence that the seven
members of OECS most heavily in
debt to the United States called for
the invasion, while the three that are
relatively independent — because
they have oil — refused to go
along?
American officials pointed to the
presence of a Cuban colonel and a
warehouse full of small arms on
Grenada as evidence that Cuba in
tended to build a military base on
the island. But the Cuban colonel
had arrived only the day before the
invasion. And the arms cache was
hardly surprising; U.S. forces
carried out a mock invasion of
Grenada two years ago and since
then U.S. military flights have regu
larly violated Grenadian airspace.
President Reagan has repeatedly
accused Grenada of building an

Rachelle
Marshall

airstrip designed to serve as a Soviet
air base, and he used this charge to
justify the invasion. But after the in
vasion, officials of the Plessy Com
pany, a British firm that designed
the airport, insisted it was intended
only to serve civilian traffic. Grenada
has wanted a longer airstrip for 20
years, to enable more tourists to
come to the island, and in 1979 the
World Bank concluded that Grenada
needed one. Cuba contributed
workers to the project; Canada,
Mexico, and Venezuela helped with
the financing, and a U.S. firm de
signed the fuel storage tanks. So
much for the Soviet air base.
As for the fear of some U.S. offi
cials that the Soviets planned to use
Grenada to intercept oil tankers
bound for the United States, surely
the Soviets know that even one act
could trigger World War 111.
One real reason for the invasion
was the Reagan administration's
desire to get the Cubans out of
Grenada. But that wasn't all. Large
numbers of Cubans might never
have been invited in if the United
States had responded to Maurice Bis
hop's repeated pleas for help and
recognition. It seems likely that the
overriding purpose of the invasion
was to end Grenada's attempt to fol
low an independent, socialist
course. That attempt has now been
crushed, members of Bishop's New
Jewel Party are to be barred from the
scheduled "free elections" and
Greenada will come safely into U.S.
orbit.
Most small countries in the West
ern Hemisphere — like the
countries of Eastern
Europe — already know the price of
asserting independence. Grenada
has been a useful reminder.
