# Questioning what really happened
## 
### 
According to the Reagan adminis
tration, what happened in Grenada
was: 1) a "rescue mission" to save
American lives which were in dan
ger; 2) a response to an urgent re
quest by neighboring states who
feared for their security. Now this is
clearly not what happened. Neither
of the Reagan pretexts has been
given much credence by analysts in
the United States or abroad, yet this
fact has been given very little
prominence in the press. For those
familiar with events surrounding the
Grenada invasion there are many
reasons for incredulity.
First, in the case of the threat to
American lives, no substantial
evidence has been provided prior to
or after the invasion. Indeed U.S.
congressmen who have been given
secret briefings on the matter are
quoted as saying that not a "shred
of evidence" has been presented.
The little concrete evidence that has
filtered out suggests that Americans
on the island were relatively safe.
• Prior to the invasion the
Grenadian government sent at least
two telegrams to U.S. officials in
Washington guaranteeing that "the
lives and well-being of every Ameri
can and other foreign
citizens . . . are fully protected,"
and offering to cooperate fully with
any evacuation of Americans.
• The American students report
that special measures were taken by
the government to provide their
needs during the military curfew.
These took the form of additional
water supply, jeeps for transporta
tion during breaks in the curfew and
visits to the island by U.S. diplomats
to check on their safety and needs.
• Alhough returning students

sion began, none reports threats to
their lives prior to the invasion.
Indeed, it is reported that U.S.
diplomats tried to get the students
to claim fear for their lives and they
refused.
• American faculty at the medical
school on the island flatly state that
there was never any danger to the
lives of the students.
Second, with regard to the re
quest by neighboring states; their
request violated their treaty agree
ments in the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (including
Grenada) which required that any
collective security action be agreed
on by all member states and that any
action be against "external aggres
sion." As it turns there was neither
any formal claim of external aggres
sion or unanimous agreement on
the decision to act. Indeed, dissent
ing member states were deliberately
excluded from the secret discus
sions leading to the U.S. invasion.
Aside from the legality of the pur
ported request, the bare geographic
and military facts of the case rule out
the possibility of a serious military
threat to its neighbors from Grenada
in the immediate or near future:
• Grenada is an island with nei
ther a navy nor an air force nor the
trained personnel to match such
forces.
• Grenada's leaders have always
indicated that they knew full well
that any hostile action on their part
would result in an eager and devas
tating U.S. military response.
A number of other reasons for the

invasion have been insinuated in ad
ministration press conferences
since the invasion: the instability of
the Grenadian government after the
death of Maurice Bishop; the threat
to U.S. national security posed by
the new international airport being
built; and, possible Cuban involve
ment in the killing of Bishop. The
fact that these have not been stated
explicitly as justification for the inva
sion perhaps indicates that the ad
ministration recognizes that they are
even less credible or satisfactory
bases for a military intervention in
an independent nation. A few
rhetorical questions demonstrate
the absurdity of these pretexts:
• How much evidence of
"stability" can one expect in a go
vernment of a country the size of a
U.S. suburban community within a
week after the death of its prime
minister and three cabinet mem
bers? Does American action in this
case suggest that any country pos
sessing the combination of in
security and American visitors is a
good candidate for massive military
intervention?
• According to U.S. News and
World Report, there are six Eastern
Caribbean islands with airports al
most as large or larger than the one
being built on Grenada. The airport
project was a major part of
Grenada's national development
plans before the socialist govern
ment came to power, and was partly
financed by aid from Western
European countries, Canada and
Venezuela during the Bishop admin
istration.
President Reagan's story about
what happened in Grenada has
been received with shock and dis
belief by U.S. allies in Europe and

Latin America. He should not have
been believed by those who know
him best: The American public.
Since the invasion the American
public has been fed a steady stream
of what one journalist described as
"either misinformation, or no infor
mation at all." The questions still
remains unanswered: What on
earth happened in Grenada?

on by all member states and that any
action be against "external aggres

any formal claim of external aggres

the decision to act. Indeed, dissent

Aside from the legality of the pur

and military facts of the case rule out
the possibility of a serious military
threat to its neighbors from Grenada
in the immediate or near future:

trained personnel to match such
forces.
• Grenada's leaders have always
indicated that they knew full well
that any hostile action on their part
would result in an eager and devas

A number of other reasons for the

invasion have been insinuated in ad
ministration press conferences
since the invasion: the instability of
the Grenadian government after the
death of Maurice Bishop; the threat
to U.S. national security posed by
the new international airport being
built; and, possible Cuban involve
ment in the killing of Bishop. The
fact that these have not been stated
explicitly as justification for the inva
sion perhaps indicates that the ad
ministration recognizes that they are
even less credible or satisfactory
bases for a military intervention in
an independent nation. A few
rhetorical questions demonstrate
the absurdity of these pretexts:
• How much evidence of
"stability" can one expect in a go
vernment of a country the size of a
U.S. suburban community within a
week after the death of its prime
minister and three cabinet mem
bers? Does American action in this
case suggest that any country pos
sessing the combination of in
security and American visitors is a
good candidate for massive military
intervention?
• According to U.S. News and
World Report, there are six Eastern
Caribbean islands with airports al
most as large or larger than the one
being built on Grenada. The airport
project was a major part of
Grenada's national development
plans before the socialist govern
ment came to power, and was partly
financed by aid from Western
European countries, Canada and
Venezuela during the Bishop admin
istration.
President Reagan's story about
what happened in Grenada has
been received with shock and dis
belief by U.S. allies in Europe and

Latin America. He should not have
been believed by those who know
him best: The American public.
Since the invasion the American
public has been fed a steady stream
of what one journalist described as
"either misinformation, or no infor
mation at all." The questions still
remains unanswered: What on
earth happened in Grenada?

According to the Reagan adminis
tration, what happened in Grenada
was: 1) a "rescue mission" to save
American lives which were in dan
ger; 2) a response to an urgent re
quest by neighboring states who
feared for their security. Now this is
clearly not what happened. Neither
of the Reagan pretexts has been
given much credence by analysts in
the United States or abroad, yet this
fact has been given very little
prominence in the press. For those
familiar with events surrounding the
Grenada invasion there are many
reasons for incredulity.
First, in the case of the threat to
American lives, no substantial
evidence has been provided prior to
or after the invasion. Indeed U.S.
congressmen who have been given
secret briefings on the matter are
quoted as saying that not a "shred
of evidence" has been presented.
The little concrete evidence that has
filtered out suggests that Americans
on the island were relatively safe.
• Prior to the invasion the
Grenadian government sent at least
two telegrams to U.S. officials in
Washington guaranteeing that "the
lives and well-being of every Ameri
can and other foreign
citizens . . . are fully protected,"
and offering to cooperate fully with
any evacuation of Americans.
• The American students report
that special measures were taken by
the government to provide their
needs during the military curfew.
These took the form of additional
water supply, jeeps for transporta
tion during breaks in the curfew and
visits to the island by U.S. diplomats
to check on their safety and needs.

sion began, none reports threats to
their lives prior to the invasion.
Indeed, it is reported that U.S.
diplomats tried to get the students
to claim fear for their lives and they
refused.
• American faculty at the medical
school on the island flatly state that
there was never any danger to the
lives of the students.
Second, with regard to the re
quest by neighboring states; their
request violated their treaty agree
ments in the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (including
Grenada) which required that any
collective security action be agreed
on by all member states and that any
action be against "external aggres
sion." As it turns there was neither
any formal claim of external aggres
sion or unanimous agreement on
the decision to act. Indeed, dissent
ing member states were deliberately
