# Situation justified our intervention
## 
### 
The overwhelming public ap
proval of President Reagan's deci
sion to send military forces into
Grenada, as well as the collapse of
most partisan opposition
demonstrates a renewal of the U.S.
committment toward supporting
justice and self-determination
abroad. In this sense the United
States appears ready to shed its self
doubt incurred from the Vietnam
war.
In our age of domestic well-being
it becomes all too easy to relax and
passively accept the plights of
peoples outside our borders while
disclaiming any active effort toward
their betterment as either
"interventionism," or
"imperialism." However, the ac
complishments of the Grenadian in
vasion will illustrate this truth: We
must transcend the "peace-at-any
price" mentality and promote and
protect human freedom and quality
of life abroad. Furthermore, the al
ternative to action would most likely
have resulted in an even greater
danger to the lives of the Americans
on the island, a tighter constriction
of Grenadian liberties and an ex
panded capacity for Cuba to un
dermine existing states in the
region.
Justification for the invasion sterns
most visibly from the newly imposed
Marxist regime's jeopardization of
the lives of Americans on the island.
Failure to act might have resulted in
another hostage crisis. Since the
brutal coup and murder of the
former Grenadian prime minister by
an even more volatile pro-Cuban
faction, none of the more than 1000
Americans were permitted to
evacuate. Fortunately, America
learned in Iran that swift action to
prevent a crisis is many more times
effective than late action to remedy
it.
Intervention itself cannot be seen
as an evil; rather the motives and ef
fects of the intervening country
mush be the object of scrutiny. The
United States acted not to "impose"
its ideas upon a foreign nation or to
restrict the inherent liberties of that
nation's people as Russia has done
in Poland and Afghanistan, but
rather for just the opposite pur
pose.Testimony from the Grenadian
citizens indicates they feared their
fare under the increasingly
repressive government (repressive,
as in, say shoot-on-sight, round-the
clock curfews.) Support of the
Grenadians in their desire to both
determine their form of government
through democratic process and to
live independent of Cuban tyranny
and restriction of liberty become
more and more than just a promo
tion of U.S. interests in the Carib
bean. Clearly, it is morally right.
Consistent with this pretext, the
U.S. action effectively checked

some of the blatantly ambitious
Cuban effort to expand its military
presence. Intelligence before and
evidence recovered since the inva
sion reveals that the island was be
coming a strategic hamlet from
which Cuba could more effectively
export weaponry, materials, and ad
visers to Africa, the Eastern Caribbean,
Guyana as well as the Nicaraguan
Sandinistas, the El Salvadorian
rebels and other anti-western ele
ments.
Newsweek described the goals of
the invasion in its statement saving
the United States sought to "extricate
the American citizens safely and
swiftly . . . establish order in the place
of a bloody anarchy . . . and withdraw
as soon as possible with the makings
of a new democratic government
firmly in place." Critics of the inva
sion, however, still seem to ignore
the evidence supporting this action.
They assert that American lives were
never really in danger even though
students, when arriving back home,
kissed the ground in exultation
Simultaneously, critics deny any
aggressive Cuban intent even
though U.S. forces discovered
stockpiles of sophisticated Soviet
weaponry and Soviet documents
authorizing further shipments of
arms, far in excess of anything ex
perts deemed necessary to secure
the tiny island's defense. In
numerous locations, U.S. forces dis
covered warehouses brimming with
handguns, AK-47 assault ritles, 120-
millimeter mortars, machine guns,
anti-aircraft weapons and anti-tank
rocket launchers.
Equally disturbing was the pres
ence of so many freshly imported
Russian state-of-the-art armored
personnel carriers. U.S. forces also
captured an advisory board of 49
Soviets, 24 North Koreans, 10 East
Germans and assorted Bulgarians
and Libyans. These developments,
coupled with the unexpected,
bloody resistance from a batallion of
Cuban troops which supposedly did
not exist, confirms suspicions of
Fidel Castro's plans to further trans
form the island into a military out
post for exporting insurgency.
Given both the clarity of Cuba's
malevolent intent and the urgent
pleas of Grenada's neighbors su< h
as Antigua, St. Lucia, St. Vincent,
Dominica, Jamaica and Barbados to
oust the Marxist regime the United
States was indeed justified in it of
fort to reestablish order within
Grenada.
