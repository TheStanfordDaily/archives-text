# Lines drawn on control of Reagan center
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
With an expected Stanford deci
sion on the Reagan presidential
complex less than a month away,
the University and the White House
remain at odds over a crucial issue,
and while both sides seem to be
hoping an agreement can be
reached, no sign of a compromise is
in sight.
Statements from University offi
cials and a White House letter dis
tributed last week have made vivid
the fact that on that issue — whether
the Hoover Institution is to be
allowed to run a proposed center
for public affairs — the two sides
could hardly be further apart.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, while saying that a public
policy center might be of benefit to
Stanford, has warned repeatedly in
recent weeks that a Hoover-run cen
ter will not be acceptable to the
Board of Trustees.
Board President William Kimball
put his views more bluntly in a letter
sent to the White House last month:
"A center for public affairs to be ad
ministered by the Hoover Institu
tion," he wrote, "has little chance
of approval by the trustees — even if
it means that we cannot have the li
brary or museum at Stanford."
In response, Presidential Coun
sellor Edwin Meese struck just as in
transigent a tone. In a letter sent to

Kimball and other trustees last
week, Meese made clear that the
White House considers the Hoover
run center an integral and inex
tricable part of the package, warning
that for Stanford to rule out the ad
ministrative role of the Hoover Insti
tution would be "tantamount to
making the president 'an offer he
cannot accept.' "

In the letter Meese also charged
that by opposing plans for a Hoover
run center, Kennedy has broken
separate commitments he made to
Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell in February 1981 and in
January of this year.
But, apparently in an effort to cool
the intensity' of the debate before it
becomes so heated that discussions
