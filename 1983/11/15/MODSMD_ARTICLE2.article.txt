# Lines drawn on control of Reagan center
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
With an expected Stanford deci
sion on the Reagan presidential
complex less than a month away,
the University and the White House
remain at odds over a crucial issue,
and while both sides seem to be
hoping an agreement can be
reached, no sign of a compromise is
in sight.
Statements from University offi
cials and a White House letter dis
tributed last week have made vivid
the fact that on that issue — whether
the Hoover Institution is to be
allowed to run a proposed center
for public affairs — the two sides
could hardly be further apart.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, while saying that a public
policy center might be of benefit to
Stanford, has warned repeatedly in
recent weeks that a Hoover-run cen
ter will not be acceptable to the
Board of Trustees.
Board President William Kimball
put his views more bluntly in a letter
sent to the White House last month:
"A center for public affairs to be ad
ministered by the Hoover Institu
tion," he wrote, "has little chance
of approval by the trustees — even if
it means that we cannot have the li
brary or museum at Stanford."
In response, Presidential Coun
sellor Edwin Meese struck just as in
transigent a tone. In a letter sent to

Kimball and other trustees last
week, Meese made clear that the
White House considers the Hoover
run center an integral and inex
tricable part of the package, warning
that for Stanford to rule out the ad
ministrative role of the Hoover Insti
tution would be "tantamount to
making the president 'an offer he
cannot accept.' "

In the letter Meese also charged
that by opposing plans for a Hoover
run center, Kennedy has broken
separate commitments he made to
Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell in February 1981 and in
January of this year.
But, apparently in an effort to cool
the intensity' of the debate before it
becomes so heated that discussions


Donald Kennedy
break down altogether, both sides
yesterday refused to discuss at
length either those charges or the
prospects of a Reagan library com
plex coming to Stanford.
Kennedy, in an interview yester
day, reiterated his earlier warning by
saying the White House letter
"certainly reduces" the chances of
the Reagan papers coming to Stan
ford.
But he would go no futher. "I'm
not going to have much to say on

the subject," he said, "because I
think it really is preferable not to
conduct (the debate) in the newspa
per."
"My guess is that we'll have some
kind of an answer for Mr. Meese
next week," Kennedy said, adding
that that response will likely not be
made public. He said that "neither
of (the charges) in fact is true," but
did not elaborate, saying, "to the
extent they have to be dealt with
they will be dealt with in the
response (to Meese)."
Kimball refused to discuss the
Meese letter, saying only that the
Board Committee on the Hoover In
stitution, which has also been con

sidering the Reagan library issue,
would "be meeting this month" to
draft "a thoughtful reply to the
White House."
At the Hoover Institution, Senior
Fellow Martin Anderson said he still
thinks an agreement between the
White House and the University can
be reached. "I think there's a very
substantial chance that when the
Board of Trustees sits down and
carefully considers the pros and
cons and all the implications . . .
that we're going to have a presiden
tial library complex at Stanford," he
said.
"The Stanford Board (of Trustees)
is an interesting group," Anderson

said, arguing that it may well vote to
accept a Hoover-run center because
no one has yet offered a valid reason
why the Hoover Institution should
not have an administrative role.
Anderson pointed out that while
Kennedy and Kimball have acted as
if they were speaking for the
majority of the Board, the trustees
have yet to make a formal statement
on the matter.
Anderson would not discuss the
charges about the alleged Kennedy
flip-flop that were raised in the
Meese letter. Campbell, from whom
Meese says he learned of the Ken
nedy endorsement of a complex in
cluding a public policy center, main
tained his customary silence to the
press, refusing again to be inter
viewed by The Daily.
