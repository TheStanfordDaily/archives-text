# Administration painted an image of a Cuban/Soviet enemy
## 
### 
Our invasion of Grenada has been pre
sented as a war against Cuba. We were told
that our troops were fighting Cuban
troops; that our invasion and military pres
ence were necessary to prevent the es
tablishment of a massive Soviet and Cuban
military base. We arrived "just in time,"
President Reagan told us.
These are clear, simple images, and they
evoke a clear simple emotional response.
Americans could feel like some Western
marshal, taking on the outlaws and cleaning
up some old Western town, staying just
long enough to say "Shucks ma'am it
twarnt nothin' " and riding off into the sun
set. And in a minute President Reagan will
be back to tell us about next week's
episode.
But before our heroes ride off into the
sunset, perhaps we should ask just a few
questions about the images that have been
presented to us:
Image: Our troops in Grenada were fighting

Ken

Cuban troops, who were hardened, profes
sional soldiers.
Reports that the resistance was Cuban
came from the American military. American
reporters were not allowed to observe the
fighting. British papers, in contrast, re
ported that U.S. troops were fighting
Grenadian army and militia units (London
Guardian, Oct. 26; Observer, Oct. 30).
These accounts reported that U.S. troops,
invading in the pre-dawn hours, had en
circled the Cuban construction workers
while they slept (also reported in The New
York Times Nov. 5), leading to fierce fight
ing and the eventual capture. This was the
only incident in which fighting with Cubans
was mentioned.
Our government fortified its claims by

stating that Cubans on the island were
"brave professional soldiers disguised" as
construction workers. Later the govern
ment quietly retracted these claims, stating
that at most 141 of the Cubans were
"combatants", another 159
"sympathizers", and the rest merely non
combatant construction workers. (Note
"combatant" may simply mean workers
who fought when attacked).
Why did our government want us to
believe that our enemy was "hardened
Cuban troops" — and not Grenadians? And
why did our government make outrageous
claims — later quietly retracted — as to the
numbers and types of Cubans present, thus
implanting this idea in our minds?

establishing a giant and important military
base on Grenada.
President Reagan told us last March, on
national television, that "the Cubans, with
Soviet financing and backing, are in the

process of building an airfield with a 10,000-
foot runway . . . Who is it intended for? —
The Soviet-Cuban militarization of
Grenada, in short, can only be seen as
power projection into the region . . Vet,
as reported, for example, in the San lose
Mercury News on Nov. 6:
• The financial backers of the airport in
cluded Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and
other Western countries;
• The airport was intended for tourists.
Grenada's current airport can only accept
small inter-island planes, not commercial
jetliners. Tourism is a major part of the eco
nomy. At least four of the other Caribbean
islands — Antigua, Barbados, St. Luciam
and Aruba — have runways as large or
larger. Antigua for example, with only
three-fourths of the population of Grenada,
has a 13,000-foot runway.
• The major contactors for the airport's
construction were British and American
firms.

The American government painted for us
a picture of a glorious battle against Soviet
and Cuban subversion. Our troops fought
Cuban troops; our military placements
were necessary to stop the establishment of
massive Soviet and Cuban bases. The
picture was created in bold strokes upon a
fabric of lies, half-truths and distortions; by
the time the facts trickled in, the image was
already clearly established.
A lie, repeated often enough, becomes a
truth. Enough lies, repeated often enough,
paint a canvas which is taken as truth. The
painted fabric of "Cuban and Soviet inva
sion" will remain to mask the plain and
naked fact of American invasion, even as
every thread underlying that fabric is shown
to be a lie or massively distorted; lies and
distortions that would not be needed, if
there indeed existed truths with which to
do the weaving.

construction workers. Later the govern
ment quietly retracted these claims, stating
that at most 141 of the Cubans were
"combatants", another 159
"sympathizers", and the rest merely non
combatant construction workers. (Note
"combatant" may simply mean workers
who fought when attacked).
Why did our government want us to
believe that our enemy was "hardened
Cuban troops" — and not Grenadians? And
why did our government make outrageous
claims — later quietly retracted — as to the
numbers and types of Cubans present, thus
implanting this idea in our minds?

establishing a giant and important military
base on Grenada.
President Reagan told us last March, on
national television, that "the Cubans, with
Soviet financing and backing, are in the

process of building an airfield with a 10,000-
foot runway . . . Who is it intended for? —
The Soviet-Cuban militarization of
Grenada, in short, can only be seen as
power projection into the region . . Vet,
as reported, for example, in the San lose
Mercury News on Nov. 6:
• The financial backers of the airport in
cluded Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and
other Western countries;
• The airport was intended for tourists.
Grenada's current airport can only accept
small inter-island planes, not commercial
jetliners. Tourism is a major part of the eco
nomy. At least four of the other Caribbean
islands — Antigua, Barbados, St. Luciam
and Aruba — have runways as large or
larger. Antigua for example, with only
three-fourths of the population of Grenada,
has a 13,000-foot runway.
• The major contactors for the airport's
construction were British and American
firms.

The American government painted for us
a picture of a glorious battle against Soviet
and Cuban subversion. Our troops fought
Cuban troops; our military placements
were necessary to stop the establishment of
massive Soviet and Cuban bases. The
picture was created in bold strokes upon a
fabric of lies, half-truths and distortions; by
the time the facts trickled in, the image was
already clearly established.
A lie, repeated often enough, becomes a
truth. Enough lies, repeated often enough,
paint a canvas which is taken as truth. The
painted fabric of "Cuban and Soviet inva
sion" will remain to mask the plain and
naked fact of American invasion, even as
every thread underlying that fabric is shown
to be a lie or massively distorted; lies and
distortions that would not be needed, if
there indeed existed truths with which to
do the weaving.
