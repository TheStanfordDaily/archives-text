## Fencers post wins over Cal and USF 
### 
| Both the Stanford men's and women's fencing teams opened
Bihe season on a winning note last Saturday at the University of
Ran Francisco.
'â–  The women, led by senior Cathy Correa, defeated UC-
Berkeley 14-2 while the men downed USF 21-6.
& For the Cardinal women, Correa won four bouts without a
defeat as did teammate and sophomore stand-out Jennifer Yu.
Freshman Holly Taylor was 3-0, while senior Gretchen Rohrer
chalked up a 3-1 record.
Stanford freshman Megan Levitan was forced to debut against
pCal's top fencer, Yi-Li Wu, and lost by a close 5-3 score. Wu
produced the only victories for the Bears, beating both Levitan
and Rohrer.
"Our women showed a lot of poise for such an early point in
the season," said Stanford Head Coach Buzz Hurst. "Beating
Cal is great under any circumstances, but as an omen for the rest
ot the season it's even better."
' Hurst, who also coaches the Card men, was just as pleased
with their winning effort against the Dons.
"USF has a good team," he said, "and while I did think we'd
beat them I didn't expect it to be so decisive."
All posting 3-0 records for Stanford were senior Nik Blevins in
epee, sophomore Elliott Cheu in foil and sophomore Andy
Coorno and freshman Steve Levitan in sabre.
"I was encouraged by the overall result, Hurst said, but the
foil team's 7-2 defeat of a veteran USF squad was the real high
light of the match."
The Card fencers' next opponent will be the men's and wo
men's teams from UC-Santa Cruz, who visit Stanford this Friday.
The meet begins at 4 p.m. in Roble Gym.
