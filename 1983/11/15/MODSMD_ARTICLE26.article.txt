## Where has all the talent gone? 
### ADAM BERNS 
There's a myth being perpetuated
by Bay Area sportswriters. At first,
just a few believed the myth; now
everybody seems to believe it. But
it's just not true.
So what's the myth?
It's that Stanford football coach
Paul Wiggin's major liability as a
coach was recruiting. Time and time
again, the question of whether one
can recruit at Stanford is brought
up.
When one looks at the hard facts,
recruiting has not been the problem
that it is made out to be. While
Stanford's recruiting effort certainly
has a different emphasis and style
than that done at USC, it can be
done successfully.
Wiggin's first two recruiting years
at Stanford were among the best in
Stanford history. His first year, this
year's senior class, had several high
school Ail-Americans in it, includ
ing All-Pacific-10 safety Vaughn Wil
liams.
But there's more. In his second
year, his first full recruiting year,
Wiggin snagged eight high school
Ail-Americans, and his recruiting
class ranked among the top five in
the United States according to
Sports Illustrated.
One highly respected recruiting
expert said in a preseason publica
tion that year Stanford easily had
the best recruiting year in the na
tion, followed by Notre Dame and
USC. He referred to Stanford as an
"upcoming Pacific-10 (Conference)
power."
Following a 4-7 record that year,
Stanford recruiting took a bit of a
nose dive, but still was considered
solid. And this year's class with
freshmen John Paye, Thomas Hen
ley, and Marshall Dillard — who all
started last Saturday — cannot be
considered too bad either.
So where has all the talent gone?
This year's junior class featured
receiver Emile Harry, linebackers
Tom Briehl and Matt Soderland, de

fensive linemen Garin Veris and
Terry Jackson, quarterbacks Fred
Buckley and Greg Topp, center
Brent Martin, tackle John Barns, de
fensive backs Darrell Grissum, Jett
Arrillaga, Dwain Hamilton and Eric
Price among others.
Eight of the above list made some
High School All-America team and
many won special praise among col
lege coaches and scouts. Martin
was called by one recruiter just
about the best high school center in
the nation. Penn State coach Joe
Paterno called Jackson the best de
fensive line prospect in the nation,
and Barns was called the best
lineman in Texas.

So what happened?
When Wiggin came to Stanford
he instituted a weight program
which went far beyond that of pre
vious coaches. As he tells it: "When
I came here to Stanford the prob
lem was getting them (the players)
in the weight room. Now it's getting
them out of there."
If the problem for Stanford was
recruiting, its problem should have
been getting blown away like in
past years when a USC running
back would gain five or six yards
without even being touched. But
that hasn't been the case.
Stanford did an admirable job
shutting down the Oklahoma run

ning game in its season opener and
Cardinal defensive tackle Mike
Wyman even went so far as to say
after a couple games that the Stan
ford defensive line had dominated
every team that it had played up to
that point.
When Stanford has been beaten,
it has not been with size. For exam
ple, after the Cardinal shut down
the San Jose State running game
early in the season, the Spartans
went to some misdirection plays
which proved to be effective.
Against USC, the Cardinal almost
totally shut down the Trojan ground
attack yet was through the air by a
trick play and a couple of other
deep passes.
On offense, Stanford has fielded
the most talented group of
receivers in the league according to
most coaches. Before the season,
offensive tackle Matt Moran said
that this year's group could be one
of the biggest and strongest in
recent memory. Yet the offense has
been ineffective.
Expecting a freshman like John
Paye to come in and take over the
quarterback reins from Menlo High
School was obviously too much to
ask. When Cottrell failed, where
was junior quarterback Fred Buck
ley, a high school All-American
rated as perhaps the best quarter
back nationwide in his recruiting
class?
lust how a recruit turns out is ob
viously difficult to judge. Why a
group of players fails to win is even
more difficult.
But the cold, hard facts tell a dif
ferent story than the press would
like to play in their reports.
In L. Frank Baum's "The Wizard
of Oz," Dorothy looks over the
rainbow to find happiness, but she
finds out in the end that her real
friends were at home all along.
like Dorothy, Stanford does not
have to look over the rainbow to
find players that are capable of win
ning. They've been here all along.

There's a myth being perpetuated
by Bay Area sportswriters. At first,
just a few believed the myth; now
everybody seems to believe it. But
it's just not true.
So what's the myth?
It's that Stanford football coach
Paul Wiggin's major liability as a
coach was recruiting. Time and time
again, the question of whether one
can recruit at Stanford is brought
up.
When one looks at the hard facts,
recruiting has not been the problem
that it is made out to be. While
Stanford's recruiting effort certainly
has a different emphasis and style
than that done at USC, it can be
done successfully.
Wiggin's first two recruiting years
at Stanford were among the best in
Stanford history. His first year, this
year's senior class, had several high
school Ail-Americans in it, includ
ing All-Pacific-10 safety Vaughn Wil
liams.
But there's more. In his second
year, his first full recruiting year,
Wiggin snagged eight high school
Ail-Americans, and his recruiting
class ranked among the top five in
the United States according to
Sports Illustrated.
One highly respected recruiting
expert said in a preseason publica
tion that year Stanford easily had
the best recruiting year in the na
tion, followed by Notre Dame and
USC. He referred to Stanford as an
"upcoming Pacific-10 (Conference)
power."
Following a 4-7 record that year,
Stanford recruiting took a bit of a
nose dive, but still was considered
solid. And this year's class with
freshmen John Paye, Thomas Hen
ley, and Marshall Dillard — who all
started last Saturday — cannot be
considered too bad either.
So where has all the talent gone?
This year's junior class featured
receiver Emile Harry, linebackers
Tom Briehl and Matt Soderland, de

fensive linemen Garin Veris and
Terry Jackson, quarterbacks Fred
Buckley and Greg Topp, center
Brent Martin, tackle John Barns, de
fensive backs Darrell Grissum, Jett
Arrillaga, Dwain Hamilton and Eric
Price among others.
Eight of the above list made some
High School All-America team and
many won special praise among col
lege coaches and scouts. Martin
was called by one recruiter just
about the best high school center in
the nation. Penn State coach Joe
Paterno called Jackson the best de
fensive line prospect in the nation,
and Barns was called the best
lineman in Texas.
