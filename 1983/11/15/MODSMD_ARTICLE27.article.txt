# The
						Band rebounds from Game's fiasco

### MARGARET SULLIVAN 
Athletic matches throughout history have
been tainted b\ the element of surprise.
The U.S. hocke\ team stunned the world
with its 1980 Winter Olympic triumph. The
San Francisco 49ers startled the nation with
their 1982 Super Bowl upset and who could
forget the 19b9 Mets coming from last place
in their division and capturing the World
Series to the bewilderment of all.

But no athletic match of recent history
was as shocking as last year's Big Came, the
annual football contest matching Stanford
and UC-Berkelev. Central to the disputed
finish of this landmark event was the role of
the Stanford Band. Not that the Leland
Stanford lunior Universit\ Marching Band
(LSJUMB) is modestly reputed or vaguely
unknown, but Big Game 1982 put it down in
history as truly incomparable.
With four seconds on the clock, it ap
peared Stanford had wrapped up a Big
Came triumph. Quarterback )ohn Elway
would conclude his brilliant collegiate
career with a victory, the Cardinal would
likely gain a post-season bowl berth and the
traditional axe would return to the Farm.
But in those precarious few seconds his
tory was dealt a decisive blow. The Cardinal
kick-off was taken near midfield where
driven by desperation the Cal players made
successive laterals in a frenzied attempt to
weave downfield. When a Berkeley ball car
rier evidently went down the Cardinal
jubilation was such that the Band raced on
the field.
Five laterals later Cal's Kevin Moan just
kept running, weaving through the Stan
ford Band. Down went the trombone
player, down went the Cardinal defenders,
and up went the officials arms. Berkeley

had scored the go-ahead touchdown
through a screen of Stanford Band mem
bers.
Some call it a robbery, wme call it a
fluke, some call it a tragedy, but no one for
got it. Thus with this year's Big Game
nearing, the Stanford Band is once again in
the limelight.
Simon Streets, the Band's drum major,
said, "We've been waiting a year. This is
our biggest opportunity to put on a show."
Assistant manager Ben Langlotz added,
"We have no latent guilt. No rational per
son would blame the Band for last year's
outcome. We just want to make the Stan
ford community proud.''
Pride is something the Band strives to
bring to Stanford. In a football season beset
by poor performance and waning enthusi
asm, the Band has been a bright spot. Last
season was the first time in recent years that
the Band received positive feedback for its
performances, according to manager Gary
Robinson. "And this year the Band made
even marked improvement over last."
Langlotz attributes much of the Band's
success to Streets. "Simon has made the
band what it is today," he said. "He has
drastically improved the music as well as its
execution. Strong leadership and lots of
creativity is what Simon has brought to the
band."
Under the leadership of Streets the band
boasts an unprecedented 11-0 attendance
record â€” never before has the band
traveled to every single away game. This
year Streets organized a small group of
motivated musicians including Debbie
Bishko, Klaus Seetho, Hayes Alexander and
Patty Stokes, who travelled to the Arizona
State, Washington and Oregon State away
games, as well as their regularly scheduled
performances.
The preparation for Big Game halftime
performance will be worked out during this
week's smut session. Although conclusive
plan cannot yet be revealed, "the Band will
pay 'ribute to the events of last year,"
Streets said.



The Stanford Band stands distraught on the field of UC-
Berkelev's Memorial Stadium after last year's Big Game surprise
ending, one that brought the band national attention. That atten-

tion was not always positive, since it concerned the Band's
involvement in the game's controversial final play.
