## KZSU Picks 
### 
The records that appear here are those that the music
staff at KZSU feels have exceptional merit. Tracks off these
albums are highlighted during ZOO Preview airing Tues
days from 5-8 p.m. and on Dance for Your Dinner
Thursdays from 5-8 p.m.

The Neats — NEATS
The Neats are sloppy;
they don't know a whole
lot of chords; they
have a dumb name. Vet this
album excites me like few
records have in the past
year.
Like REM, this Massachu
setts band is rooted in
1960s R & B, Velvet
Underground-style. But
while REM's folksy ap
proach tingles, The Neats
electrify with an unbridled
rush of energy from start to
finish.
Ringing, frenetic guitars
play off of each other,
soaring in and out of a dank
wall of reverb, propelled by

The Three O'Clock —
Sixteen 7amborines
Without a doubt, The
Three O'Clock is one of the
most original of the new
psychedelic bands to
emerge in the past five
years. Initially called the
Salvation Army, the band
released a single and an al
bum before legal complica
tions forced them to
change their name to The
Three O'Clock.
Sixteen Tamborines is the
follow-up album to their
1982 E.P., "Baroque
Hoedown." Their new
release shows a marked ad
vancement in individual
style without relying too
heavily on the popular
psychedelic bands of the
early 70s.
The Three O'Clock incor
porates a wide range of
styles in this album from

tense, driving bass lines,
with a touch of glistening
organ accompaniment here
and there. Each element
locks together in a beauti
ful frenzy.
The interplay on num
bers like "Sad" and
"Another Broken Dream"
often becomes nothing less
than hypnotic, with Eric
Martin's emotion-laden vo
cals intoning thoughtful,
introspective comments on
the human condition:
"There was a time I wanted
to love/The shadows
wouldn't follow;/Broken
dreams aren't real, I trust
you know/First look out
your window."
Neats may not be able to
match the sheer anarchic
energy of, say, the Velvets'
White Light White Heat, but
it is a refreshing reminder
of the vitality of rock and
roll at its simplest, most
straightforward and intelli
gent.

the strong pop cut, "Jet
Fighter," to ballads like
"Stupid Einstein" and "Fall
to the Ground." This album
marks The Three O'clock's
movement from the cult
music scene into the more
mainstream pop sound.
The band, however,
manages to stay away from
the trendy synth sound and
preserves its originality. A
definite must for anyone in
terested in new music and
looking for something dif
ferent and alive.
