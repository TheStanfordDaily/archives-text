# Pryor is hip here and now'

### STEVE VINEBERG 
Could Richard Pryor be the
best actor in America? No con
ventional dramatic role has
ever revealed in a performer
the intensity and uncharted
emotional range that Pryor ex
hibits in his concert movies.
Richard Pryor Here and Now,
which he directed himself, is
the least of his three filmed
concerts, but at the end of it
he does an impression of a
junkie that belongs at the top
of his repertoire, along with
the heart attack sequence in
Richard Pryor Live in Concert
and the free base routine in
Richard Pryor Live at the Sun
set Strip.
He slows his performance
tempo way down and melts
his sibilants so that they seem
eerily sexy and almost ef
feminate; no matter how
excited this character gets, he
never slides into the sound
and rhythms of the straight
world — he sticks on his
private planet. And when he
gets high and begins to nod
off, he's so serene that you
feel drawn into this man's for
bidden sphere; you under
stand why dope has a magnet
ic attraction for him, because
Pryor shares that attraction
with you.
I'm sure no one else has
ever accomplished this in the
entire history of drug addict
movies. When George Segal
played a junkie in the 1971
Born to Win, he made you
believe that, as the character
J' said of himself, he was

more interesting when he was
high, but even Segal (who was
brilliant) didn't come near the
kind of luminous energy that
Pryor demonstrates here.
When I saw him perform
this routine live at the Circle
Star Theatre last summer,
some members of the audi
ence were so disturbed by its
seductiveness that they
protested loudly. Only the
greatest actors can affect an
audience so profoundly.
One could say that after Live
in Concert and Live on the
Sunset Strip, Richard Pryor
Here and Now is a disappoint
ment, but in that case it's a
qualified disappointment: I
haven't laughed this much in a
movie since Tootsie.
The opening comments
from fans standing in line to
see the show (the picture was
filmed in New Orleans), inter
cut with a sober voice-over by
Pryor about his responsibility
to his audience, is a bad
mistake, but once the real film
gets started, you forget all
about this clumsy
sanctimoniousness, because it
doesn't recur.
At the Circle Star, Pryor
recycled his old routines — he
even took requests — and
there were uncomfortable
stretches when his hip attitude
seemed demode and inappro
priate, because this
(justifiably) proud reformed
druggie was still attacking the
straight world. But in Here and
Now he remains passionately
hip by digging up the subjects

that most of us are too embar
rassed to admit we think or
care about — like the way men
act in a public restroom — and
blowing them sky high, so we

can't remember why we
buried them in the first place.
Stoned or straight, Richard
Pryor is still our comic
liberator.
