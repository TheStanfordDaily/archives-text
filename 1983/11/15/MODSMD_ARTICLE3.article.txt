# Med Center doctors push for heart transplant legislation

### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Since the Stanford Medical Center began performing
heart transplants in 1968 as "experimental surgery,"
the operations have saved hundreds of lives and the
survival rate for patients has zoomed trom 22 to 80 per
cent.
But even after 15 years, heart transplants are still con
sidered "experimental surgery" — which can deeply
concern possible recipients since that classification
means MediCal, Medicaid and insurance companies
won't help them pay for the $125,000 operations.
Stanford doctors Lewis Wexler, a professor of cardiac
radiology, and Norman Shumway, chairman of the De
partment of Cardiovascular Surgery, are fighting to
change all that.
Wexler explained in a recent hearing that Medicaid,
MediCal and insurance companies would at least partly
pay for heart transplant surgery if its classification were
changed to "routine surgery." Now patients and re
search grants pay for most operations.
The present cost of heart transplant surgery — a min
imum of $125,000 at the Medical Center — is prohibi
tive to many patients and government reimbursements

would make the surgery accessible to a broader range
of patients, supporters of the change say.
Some legislators and physicians, however, complain
that increased government funding ot transplant sur
geries — at present, only kidney transplants are funded
by Medicaid — means allocating funds for an expensive
surgical procedure from financially troubled state and
national health care plans.
Others pose a more serious question: Is transplant
surgery receiving widespread media attention because
it is the most important of recent medical advances or
only because it is an exciting and emotional issue?
Recent legislation concerning transplant surgery in
cludes a bill submitted in August by Sen. Albert Gore
(D-Tenn.) asking that liver transplants be declared
routine surgery, a bill submitted in October by Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.) calling for a national task force
for the procurement of organ donors and a bill about to
be introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) which ex
pands the content of the bill sponsored by Kennedy to
include legislation against the buying and selling of or
gans.
At present, no specific legislation has been intro

duced concerning heart transplant surgery. However,
California state Sen. Ollie Speraw has held a number of
fact-finding hearings concerning transplant legislation.
Karen Pitts, research consultant for Speraw, said
Speraw, the founder of the Anatomical Transplant As
sociation of California, would consider introducing
legislation as a result of the hearings.
Wexler said he feels that heart transplant legislation
has been "beaten to the floor" by legislation on liver
and kidney transplants for mainly political reasons. He
explained that the law passed in 1975 authorizing
federal funding of kidney transplants came with a par
cel of dialysis legislation that passed after someone
brought a relative, complete with dialysis machine,
onto the floor of the Senate.
Liver transplant legislation is being promoted in the
same manner — with extensive media coverage given
to children needing organ transplants.
"They brought dying babies into the Senate," Wexler
said, citing the much-publicized case of Jamie Fiske. In
a recent speech, Kennedy, introducing his National Or
gan Transplant Act, listed the names of nine potential
transplant patients and added, "there remain those

who wait for the miracle of modern medicine to save
their lives."
According to David Sundwall, a spokesman for
Hatch, those promoting heart transplant legislation
have an opportunity to captilize on the recent media at
tention surrounding organ transplants. He explained
that at present organ transplants are a "sexy media
issue," and said as a result some people are asking for
"too much, too soon," in terms of transplant legisla
tion.
"A couple of years of cyclosporin, and people think
transplant surgery is a state-of-the-art thing," said
Sundwall. He explained that Hatch's legislation ignored
the reimbursement issue entirely because Hatch felt
there was not enough evidence that transplant legisla
tion should take priority over preventive medical
procedures currently funded by Medicaid.
"We'd like to see any further legislation held off until
more is known about the issue," he said.
One source that may help clarify the issue is a soon
to-be-released study of the state of heart transplant sur
gery conducted by five institutions, including the Medi
cal Center. Wexler, in his testimony at Speraw's
