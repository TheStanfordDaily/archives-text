# 'Rita' needs educating
## Caine in top form 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The only reason to see
Educating Rita is Michael
Caine, who — as a drunken,
disenchanted English profes
sor brought back to life by a
young woman he tutors —
turns a sow's ear of a part into
a silk purse. The rest of the
movie remains pure hog.
On stage Willy Russell's
1980 play, a smash in London's
West End, may have some of
the appeal of Pygmalion and
Born Yesterday and the other
inter-class pedagogical
romances on which it's built,
but in this production, incon
sistently filled out for the
screen (Russell wrote his own
screenplay) and miserably
staged and directed by Lewis
Gilbert, there's no way to tell
for certain.
I suspect that the play might
work if the woman in the title
role gave it some of the comic
energy Barbra Streisand
brought to the part of Doris,
the whore in The Owl and the
Pussycat (who has some of the
same impulses as Rita). But
Julie Walters, repeating her
stage performance, is a
glazed-eyed zombie of an

actress who reads her lines as
if spontaneity were a crime
against nature.
This movie tries so pitifully
hard to be funny in the relent
less, rehearsed-to-death style
of the worst BBC sitcoms that
you stare dumbly at it, praying
for a quick release. But Mi
chael Caine responds gently
to Julie Walters, as if she were
playing off him instead of
simply reeling off routines by
rote, and he gives his charac
ter so much depth that he dig
nifies the material, just as he
and Maggie Smith did in one
of Neil Simon's California
Suite sketches a few years ago.
Caine is one of the best ac
tors in movies, but — like
Gene Hackman, who also has
an amazing track record —
he's so low-key, intelligent in
such an un-self-conscious
way, that his fine work often
goes unnoticed, especially if it
appears in forgettable films
like Victory or Beyond the
Limit. He was remarkable in
De Palma's Dressd to Kill, but
the structure of the movie
demanded that you be un
aware of him until the movie
was over, so he didn't receive

the credit he should have for
his imaginative, subtle perfor
mance.
In Educating Rita he plays a
man who has grown to distrust
intellectuals, yet — in the
most positive sense — he is
the most intellectual of movie
actors.
