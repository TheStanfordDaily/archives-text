# Walters, Caine talk about 'Rita'

### ELAINE WANG 
(Columbia Pictures flew Daily staffer Elaine Wang down to
their Burbank studios a couple months ago for a one-day
preview screening of Educating Rita, and a press conference af
terwards with principals Michael Caine and Julie Walters.)
Michael Caine walked to the front of the viewing room
looking quite different from his Prof. Bryant of Educating Rita.
He had lost the 30 pounds he put on for the film and the scruffy
beard which befitted a deteriorating professor.
"I wanted to gain weight," he comments, "because I didn't
want there to be a chance (in the movie) of anything but affec
tion. It was great fun. I played an overweight drunk, which
meant that I could drink as much as I wanted, and wear the
worst clothes."
Caine considers the part challenging, a role which required
him to be someone he'd never identified with before. "It was
even harder because I had everything in common with Rita,"
said Caine. What he referred to was the fact that Caine-the-actor
emerged from Britain's lower class popular arts revolution,
where as a cockney he faced tremendous barriers from the rigid
social system. Rita, too, faces a similar problem as a working girl
trying to attend university.
Julie Walters, the Rita of the long-running play in London and
now of the film, identifies with Rita â€” especially her desire to
learn and succeed. "I do like her, and I sympathize with her
encounters with the middle class," said Walters. She is, in per
son, very like her role. Film is something new to this nurse
turned-actress, though she has done a number of plays through
out England.
For Caine, the climb up has been hard but successful. "I think
you don't play to the upper classes. Vou go among them and
stay exactly the same ... I never got rid of my working class ac
cent and I go anywhere, virtually, even to the Queen. I stay ex
actly the same and they appreciate that," he said.
Then he quipped, "In England, I don't want to be like the aris
tocracy, because the aristocracy is so poor."
That confidence lends itself to his recent work in Educating
Rita: "If (the film) gets lost in the shuffle, it would still mean that
we were right and you were wrong."
