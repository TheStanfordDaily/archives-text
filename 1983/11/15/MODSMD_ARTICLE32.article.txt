# But for music/lolanthe' uninspired
## 
### MELINDA ISRAEL 
The women's chorus, in
limp pastels and flowery gar
lands, troops onto stage. "We
are dainty little fairies, ever
singing, ever dancing!" they
chirp in staccatto unison. Five
minutes into the Stanford
Savoyards' production of
lolanthe, it is clear that the
cast is just going through the
motions.
Uninspired direction and
stationary choreography cause
the show to completely lack
energy, and insure that
lolanthe never gets off the
ground.
The Savoyards' production
is especially disappointing,
given that lolanthe is one of
Gilbert and Sullivans' finest

operettas. The lyrical airs and
brassy anthems represent
composer Sullivan at his
height, while librettist Gilbert
is his wittiest when satirizing
the romantic exaltations of
"Aready" and the British
gentry's role in politics.
The comedy centers around
Strephon, a shepherd whose
mixed parentage has deter
mined him a fairy to the waist,
with mortal legs. His mother,
lolanthe, was banished from
the band by her fairy sisters,
but is summoned and
pardoned at the start of the
operetta. Unlucky Strephon
not only suffers from his unus
ual background (for instance,
only half his body ages), but
his betrothed, Phyllis, is
adored by the entire House of
Lords and her elderly guard
ian, the Chancellor.
Matters become even worse
when Phyllis sees Strephon
with his mother, who (being
immortal) only looks seven
teen. By the end of the first
act, Strephon, with his aunts'
magical backing, takes ven
geance by becoming the first
"fairy member" of the Parlia
ment — and the fun then
begins.
Watching the Savoyards'
lolanthe, however, was no fun
at all. Since the demise of the
D'Oyle Carte Company — the
London-based organization
which carried on the Gilbert
and Sullivan tradition for al
most a century — the respon
sibility has fallen to amateur
productions to carry on the
"G & S" spirit. Some obser

vers even noted that D'Oyle
Carte's financial collapse
might be a blessing in dis
guise, in that formal gestures
and dated references would
give way to more innovative
revivals.
The Stanford Savoyards,
however, neither imitate
D'Oyle Carte's traditional but
polished performance, nor in
troduce any imaginative al
ternative. After attending this
production of lolanthe, even a
die-hard buff begins to
wonder whether "G & S" is
timeless at all.
Surprisingly enough, the
music is the one strong point
in this show. Both the chorus,
orchestra and leads are right
on top of the syncopated
rhythms, tricky tempos and
dissonant harmonies. The fact
that the cast responded so
well to the fine musical direc
tion of Dan Powers and Lita
Libaek suggests that the flaws
were the fault of uninspired
stage direction by Anne
Feibelman and "group photo"
choreography by Judith
French.
The only actor who success
fully transcends the poor di
rection was Ed Glazier as the
Lord Chancellor. Glazier is
one of the only cast members
who seems to be enjoying
himself. Alternately striding
and prancing about the stage,
his "dirty old man" portrayal
earns some of the few audi
ence responses.
Just a bit of encouragement
from the directors might have
aided the other leads as well.

Anne Hubble as a richly-sung
Fairy Queen only gives
glimpses of a strong-willed
character, and the Laurel and
Hardy potential of Mark
Daniel and Paul Whitmer as
Lords To 11 011 e rand Moun
tararat is never realized.
James Carlin and Nancy
Kendzierski as the romantic
leads really give a shot at act
ing in love. Kendzierski's not
so-innocent Phyllis is also
refreshing.
Technically, too, the pro
duction fails to add up. Partic
ularly inappropriate are the
men's chorus' (the House of
Peers) red fur-trimmed capes
with matching hats which
opened to reveal fuschia and
sky-blue linings. Under their
robes (which belonged more
in Zeigfeld's Follies than
British Parliament), the
"lords" wore tight white pants
and double-breasted jackets
in colors like a box of floures
cent Crayolas. If they hadn't
been singing tenor and bass
parts, they might have been
mistaken for the women's
chorus.
The final disappointment
came when the surprise en
ding — the Savoyards' last
chance to win the audience —
was botched. (I won't ruin it
for those who might attend
other productions.) In the
end, the Savoyards' lolanthe
never induces the audience to
"escape to fairy realms." This
lifeless production hardly
does justice to Gilbert and Sul
livans' ethereal fantasy.
