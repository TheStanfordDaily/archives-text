# 'Rear Window' re-opens
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Rear Window was the movie that made me an
Alfred Hitchcock fan; I remember watching it
on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies when I
was 16, before it and three other movies
Hitchcock made at Paramount in the '50s (The
Trouble with Harry, The Man Who Knew Too
Much and Vertigo) were yanked from distribu
tion. Now Universal has re-released them in a
package that also includes a seldom-seen
Hitchcock turkey, the 1948 Rope. It's a pleasure
to see Rear Window again: it suffers from a
talky script (John Michael Hayes, out of a Cor
nell Woolrich story) and almost unrelieved bad
acting in the supporting roles (Thelma Ritter is
the shining exception), but it's so expertly
tooled and so absorbing that you come out of
the theater grinning.
lames Stewart, an unlikely casting choice,
plays an adventurous photojournalist who, laid

up for six weeks with a broken leg, resorts to
the endlessly interesting activity of watching
his neighbors through a pair of high-powered
binoculars. All the vignettes are cliches: the
nubile dancer who entertains and fends off
wealthy men; the lonely spinster who drinks
herself to sleep; the struggling songwriter
plugging out the same tune over and over. So
Hitchcock introduces them in a big Broadwav
musical-style opening on the movie's single
set, and throughout the film he employs them
as interludes, numbers.
The central plot concerns a henpecked sales
man (Raymond Burr, in an unfortunate wig that
makes him look like he's got shampoo in his
hair) who Stewart and his paramour (elegant
Grace Kelly) suspect of killing his wife. It's trite,
too, but the Peeping Tom perverseness of the
dramatic set-up stands the murder story glee
fully on its head.
