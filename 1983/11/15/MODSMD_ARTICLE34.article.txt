### RICHARD LYNCH 
A group of students helped police
catch a man Saturday night who al
legedly exposed himself to a woman
in Meyer Library.
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer
said yesterday that Paul Gerome
Coombs, a 35-year-old Los Altan
with "a history of this sort of thing,"
was arrested Saturday night and will
be charged with indecent exposure.
According to witnesses, at ap
proximately 9:15 p.m. the victim,
whom police declined to identify,
began screaming for help on the
third floor of the library. A man fled
down the stairs, followed bv about

25 students who eventually caught
the man outside the library.
The students returned Coombs to
Meyer's lobby where they kept him
until police officers Rick Miller and
Chuck Kemper arrived five minutes
later.
Niemeyer said Coombs was taken
to the North County Jail, identified
bv the victim and released on a
promise to appear at his arraign
ment.
Niemeyer said Coombs will be ar
raigned within 10 days. At that time
he will be officially charged and may
enter a plea.
Irene Severn, assistant head of cir
culation at Meyer, said this is not the

first time there has been a flashing
incident at the library.
"This is not an infrequent thing â€”
it is an open building and anyone
can come in," Severn said. "I think
that it happens more often than we
hear."
An incident report will be given to
Elizabeth Salzer, head of Meyer Li
brary, who will then review it and
give a recommendation to the build
ing's security staff.
Severn said she is concerned
about the incident. "A young wo
man should be able to study in the
library without this sort of thing hap
pening," she said.
