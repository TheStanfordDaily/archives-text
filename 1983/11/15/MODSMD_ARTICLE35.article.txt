Photo meeting
The Webb has commanded me to
be serious on this briefly, so I won't
even try to joke around. Photo
meetings are serious business, Lord
knows. So come to a photo meeting
today at 4 p.m. to discuss lots of im
portant things regarding Big Game
coverage.
The Ink Bowl
It may end up being more of a
toilet bowl than an ink bowl if pres
ent weather trends hold their
course, but IT WILL BE FUN, DAM
MIT. That's right, Daily staffers will
once again take on the Daily Weenie
in a touch football game this Satur
day at 10:30 a.m. at Roble Field.
Adam "SUUUUCK, it's not my fault
the sports copy wasn't in until 2
a.m." Burns is quick to point out
that for the last eight years the
school that has won the Ink Bowl
has gone on to win the Big One.
HO-O-O-O!
