Twelve years have passed since tour Palo Alto
policemen searched the offices of The Daily for
photographs of a riot, but the issue of whether the
search violated the constitutional rights ot the press
and third parties is still unresolved.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1978 that the search was
legal, but in a debate with Palo Alto Police Chief
James Zurcher yesterday, a former Daily editor main
tained that the search set a dangerous precedent.
Former Daily associate editor Dan Fiduccia said the
issue is "really a Fourth Amendment case" involving
police search and seizure procedures with non-suspect
third parties. He said the search of a newspaper office
is "like rape" because the police are allowed to sift
through many papers and photographs in seeking a
specific document.
Zurcher disagreed.
"My philosophy is still the same," he said, support
ing the right of the police to search The Daily offices for
photographs believed to be taken by a Daily photog
rapher at a riot at the Medical Center. Police thought
the photos might incriminate some of the rioters.
"In hindsight, someone should have thought about
the First Amendment issue before the warrant was ex
ecuted," Zurcher said.
Fiduccia said that when a warrant is presented to a
newspaper, "there is little choice but to comply."
Lawyers, doctors and newspapers become little more

than "unpaid investigators" of law enforcement offi
cials when their property is searched for possibly in
criminating evidence, he said.
Zurcher countered that it would be a "disaster to
eliminate all third-party searches." FHe said warrants are
necessary in securing information because one
"doesn't have to have a Stanford Ph.D." to realize that
a newspaper might destroy documents if alerted prior
