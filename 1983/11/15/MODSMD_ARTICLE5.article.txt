Commission gains double victory

Washington â€” The Civil Rights movement won a
double-barreled victory yesterday as a federal judge
barred President Reagan from firing three Demo
cratic members of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights and the Senate voted 78 to 3 to give the im
periled agency a new lease on life.
Senate approval of the reorganization plan ap
parently assures the advisory agency's future be
cause its provisions were worked out in advance
with the White House and key members of the
House, which is expected to give the legislation
quick approval.
The compromise, under which four members
would be appointed by Congress and four by the

President, ends a six-month impasse over Reagan's
efforts to install his own appointees on the tradition
ally independent panel. Without congressional ac
tion the commission would go out of existence Nov.
29.
Shortly before the Senate acted, Reagan's attempt
to reshape the agency on his own was rebuffed by
U.S. District Court Judge Norma Johnson, who
granted a preliminary injunction to bar his dismissal
last month of Democratic Commissioners Mary
Frances Berry, Blandina Ramirez and Rabbi Murray
Saltzman.
Johnson rejected the administration's argument
that the President had the authority to dismiss com
missioners at his discretion and said Congress in
tended the commission to be "free from any control
or the coercive influence by the President or the
Congress."
