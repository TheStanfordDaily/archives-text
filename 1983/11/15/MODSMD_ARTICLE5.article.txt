Commission gains double victory

Washington — The Civil Rights movement won a
double-barreled victory yesterday as a federal judge
barred President Reagan from firing three Demo
cratic members of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights and the Senate voted 78 to 3 to give the im
periled agency a new lease on life.
Senate approval of the reorganization plan ap
parently assures the advisory agency's future be
cause its provisions were worked out in advance
with the White House and key members of the
House, which is expected to give the legislation
quick approval.
The compromise, under which four members
would be appointed by Congress and four by the

President, ends a six-month impasse over Reagan's
efforts to install his own appointees on the tradition
ally independent panel. Without congressional ac
tion the commission would go out of existence Nov.
29.
Shortly before the Senate acted, Reagan's attempt
to reshape the agency on his own was rebuffed by
U.S. District Court Judge Norma Johnson, who
granted a preliminary injunction to bar his dismissal
last month of Democratic Commissioners Mary
Frances Berry, Blandina Ramirez and Rabbi Murray
Saltzman.
Johnson rejected the administration's argument
that the President had the authority to dismiss com
missioners at his discretion and said Congress in
tended the commission to be "free from any control
or the coercive influence by the President or the
Congress."
At the end of her 14-page opinion, the judge con
cluded: "The public interest strongly favors the is
suance of a preliminary injunction in this case. The
work of the commission is vital to the continued
protection and advancement of civil rights in this
country."
The justice Department late yesterday asked for a
stay of Johnson's order and filed notice of appeal.
New missiles arrive in England
London— The United States delivered the first
of 572 new medium-range missiles scheduled to be
stationed in Western Europe, Defense Secretary
Micheal Aeseltine announced in the House of Com
mons.
The cruise missiles and their tomahawk warheads,
which are each 16 times more powerful than the
bomb exploded at Hiroshima, were flown into the
Royal Air Force base at Greenham Common on a
U.S. C-141 Starlitter early yesterday morning. The ar
rival came a day earlier than had been widely
forecast by the British press, an apparent attempt to
catch by surprise anti-nuclear activists camped
around the base.
Over a five-year period, 464 cruise and 108 Persh
ing II missiles are planned to be deployed in five
NATO countries as a counter to the Soviet Union's
SS-20 missiles unless an agreement is achieved in
arms talks at Geneva.
The delivery occurred as the United States was in
forming Western European allies that chief U.S.
negotiator Paul Nitze will present in Geneva this
week a refinement of the most recent U.S. proposal

dealing with medium-range nuclear weapons.
A key ingredient of the proposal is a "global"
limitation of 420 nuclear warheads for each side in
Europe and Asia, with the numbers to be deployed
in Europe subject to negotiation. Administration
spokespersons have described the offer — an at
tempt to forestall a Soviet walkout at the talks — as
an elaboration" of an earlier proposal.
Meanwhile, the Soviet government news agency
lass last night rejected the new U.S. proposal,
asserting that it shows that "President Reagan has
not relinquished his lunatic plans" to intimidate the
Soviets with the prospect of using nuclear arms,
Washington Post correspondent Dusko Doder re
ported from Moscow.
The commentary, signed by the agency's military
affairs specialist, advanced the standard argument. It
said Soviet medium-range missiles do not reach U.S.
territory and Washington "rules out the Soviet
Union's right to adopt response measures and to
deploy Soviet medium-range missies at a similar dis
tance from important centers" on American soil.
The commentary made it clear that Moscow's
main concern is the planned deployment of the
Pershing missiles in West Germany. It made no spe
cific reference to the scheduled deployment of the
cruise missiles in West Germany and four other
West European countries.
Asia trip stresses peace
Washington — President Reagan returned to the
White House after a weeklong trip to East Asia yes
terday bringing with him two Korean children in
need of heart surgery and asserting that his trip had
improved prospects for a more secure peace and
prosperity." The president said he brought the
children home because his wife, Nancy, thought the
gesture would represent "one expression of

America's friendship for South Korea."
Reagan also said, referring to the fractious trade
relationship between )apan and the United States,
that "if each side is willing to give a little, then all of
us can gain a lot."
Reagan indicated that he thought he had been
successful in pressing Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone to open up his nation's markets
to more U.S. products and to take steps strengthen
ing the yen in relation to the dollar. Improving the
strength of Japan's currency would enable Japanese
citizens to buy U.S. goods at lower prices, the presi
dent noted.
Reagan declared that "America's partnerships are
stronger, and prospects for a more secure peace and
prospertity are better today than a week ago," when
he left Washington for Japan and South Korea.
The theme of "building a new era of peace and
prosperity" clearly is headed for Reagan's re
election campaign commercials and brochures. He
repeated the phrase twice during his brief remarks
upon arriving at the White House and has been hit
ting it hard for several days.
Administration supports prayer
Washington — The Reagan administration is prepar
ing to file a friends-of-the-court brief in an Alabama
school prayer case arguing that a law permitting a
"period of silence" at the beginning of school for
prayer or meditation passes constitutional muster,
government sources have told the Los Angeles
Times.
The Mobile School Board is asking the court to let
its teachers lead children in prayer such as, "Cod is
great, Cod is good, let us thank him for our food."
Separately, Alabama Gov. George Wallace appealed
to the justices to uphold two state laws passed last
year that permit either an oral prayer or a one
minute "period of silence" in the classrooms.

Soviets support Arafat
Moscow — The Soviet Union, apparently con
cerned for the safety of Yasser Arafat in the fighting
in Lebanon, has pressed the Syrian government to
halt its support of the Palestinian Liberation Organi
zation rebels waging war against him.
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, in
public remarks during the visit here last week of
Syrian Foreign Minister Abdel Halim khaddam,
made it clear that Moscow thinks PLO internal
disputes should be resolved by Palestinians without
Syrian's interference. Gromyko appeared both
forceful and persistent on this issue, which he also
raised in his toast at a formal luncheon.
Moscow's intervention in the dispute was clearly
intended to save Arafat and his supporters, who
seem to be tacing military defeat by Syrian-backed
PLO rebel factions in the Northern Lebanese city of
Tripoli.
Stocks gain
New York — Financial services and some aero
space and defense issues led the stock market in its
fourth straight gain yesterday.
But prices backtracked somewhat late in the ses
sion from their midday peaks as traders awaited the
latest Federal Reserve report on the money supply.
The Dow lones average of 30 industrials,up more
than 10 points at its best level of the day, closed with
a 3.87 gain at 1254.07. Over the last four sessions the
average has risen 39.13 points.
Today's weather
