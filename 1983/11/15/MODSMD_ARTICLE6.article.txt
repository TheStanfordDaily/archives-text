# Overflow crowd attends reading by author Welty
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Author Eudora Welty brought
the house down last night and
the house managed to bring
Welty down — at least for half
an hour.
Welty, who read two stories to
an overflow crowd at Kresge
Auditorium, was forced to stop
reading part of the way through
the performance so a large part
of the audience could be moved
outside. More than 100 people
huddled outside Kresge for the
second half of the performance,
listening to Welty's voice over a
makeshift loudspeaker system.
English Prof. Albert Gelpi, who
invited Welty to speak here, said
the problem was caused by un
derbudgeting of space and un
derestimating of Welty's appeal.
Welty has written books in
cluding The Optimist's Daughter,
The Robber Bridegroom, and The
Golden Apple. Her work has
been published in the Atlantic
Monthly, the Southern Review
and Harper's, and she has been a
guest professor at Smith and Bryn
Mawr Colleges and a lecturer at
Cambridge University.
The two stories read last night
included "Why I Live At The
P. 0.," the first story Welty pub
lished, and "Powerhouse," a
story Welty described as being
"about the magic of a black piano
player, based on the life of Fats
Waller."
According to Police Sergeant
Philip Love, more than 1500
people attended the function;
about 700 were expected. Just as
the police arrived to investigate
the overcrowded situation an

"elderly gentleman" fainted in
the rear of auditorium.
John L'Heureux, the director of
creative writing here, announced
after Welty's first story that Love
told him to announce that every
one not sitting in a seat would
have to leave.
"We were in a double jeopardy
situation," L'hereux said while
the crowd was dispersing. "We
couldn't stop because the police
said they would not take respon
sibility for what happened if we
did, and we can't go on until the
crowd subsides." After several
hundered people had cleared the
aisles and left the building entire
ly, speakers were wired so that
Welty's reading could be heard

both inside and outside the
building.
While the speakers were being
installed, Welty sat on the stage
and signed autographs for the
ambitious few who managed to
duck past Celpi and L'hereux.
"We told her she wouldn't
have to do this," L'hereux ex
plained, attempting to dissuade
autograph hounds from mount
ing the stage. L'Hereux said he
felt embarrassed by the situation,
but that similarly distinguished
lecturers had never drawn such a
large crowd.
"Of course we expected large
numbers," he said, "but we
failed to consider how
phenomenally attractive she is to
millions. And here they are."
