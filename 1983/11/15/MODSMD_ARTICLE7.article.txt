## Handicapped to use mechanical 'arms'

It strikes a match, and with a
flourish, touches the flame to
the candle. Shaking its metal
arm several times, it "blows
out" the match and prepares
to serve supper.
"It"the —the nation's first
voice-controlled robot arm —
has the power to light far more
than a candle at the dinner
table. It throws light — and
previously unimagined inde
pendence — into the lives of
countless quadriplegics.

ter in Palo Alto, working with
center director Larry Leifer,
associate professor of me
chanical engineering here,
began work on the project
over five years ago. The result,
a metal "arm" replete with
wrist, forearm, elbow,
shoulder, and a two-fingered
hand, looks nothing like the
human arm whose functions it
simulates.
On the other hand, it was
not designed to be an
"anatomical replacement,"
according to K.G. Engelhardt,
center evaluations supervisor,
who is conducting experi
ments to determine the

robot's capabilities. "If you
wanted to make a machine
simulate vision, would you
use a retina?" Engelhardt said.
"No, you would simulate it
with high voltage wires and so
on," she said.
So far, the robot's capabili
ties are impressive. No new
technology is embodied in the
hardware, but the computer
software has enabled the
robot to respond to 58 sepa
rate commands. To spare the
user needless repetition, cer
tain commands are coded to
perform an entire series of
tasks.
Because the robot can only
recognize one voice at a time,
each new user must recite the
list of commands anew so that
his or her unique voice im
print will remain with the ma
chine.
The system currently in use,
Votan, is innovative in that it
can also produce female
voices; this is the contribution
of Dr. Richard Steele, a lin
guist with the project who is
also working on endowing the
voices with inflections and
regional dialects.
Research at the center is
geared toward helping handi
capped users acquire some
degree of independence in
three vital areas: day-to-day
activities, vocational tasks,
and even, to a small extent,
recreational activities. The
voice-controlled robot is espe
cially designed to be of use in
the first area. It can grasp ob
jects, raise and lower them,
open a refrigerator or micro
wave door placed within the
radius of its arm, and do a host
of other useful chores.
Entrusting the robot to fill a
glass vase with water might
not be a good idea, however,
because it still does not have
stress sensors delicate enough
to estimate the force it needs
to employ to grasp objects or

set them down. Aside from
the Rehabilitation Center, SRI
and Mechanical Engineering
Design Division researchers
are working on the problem of
equipping the machine with
adequate force sensors.
Despite that obstacle,
already dozens of quad
riplegics have had a chance to
"talk" to the robot. Research
ers are visibly enthusiastic
about the robot's prospects,
and hope to begin testing it in
a VA nursing home by January.
Soon afterwards, the robot
will be fitted with a mobile
base.
The next step is to prepare
the robot for commercial pro
duction. Leifer estimates that a
more sophisticated variation
of the prototype version will
be available within 10-20 years.
In order for the robot be ready
for this, though, it must be

able to take a slight degree of
initiative.
"Right now, the robot can
do only purely pre
programmed sequences,"
said research associate Stefan
Michalowski. It is limited to
actions which are known in
advance, according to Mic
halowski, and that includes
many essential tasks.
"Say you want to pour a
drink of water from a bottle,"
Michalowski said. "The situa
tion changes: The cup isn't al
ways in the same place, or per
haps there is a different
amount of water in the bottle
than there was last time. The
robot has to be able to recog
nize and respond to those
changes."
Vision would obviously
greatly facilitate the robot's
ability to respond to un
programmed situations, and

Engelhardt said the version
which will eventually be
marketed will be equipped
with "at least rudimentary vi
sion."
While the research is largely
funded by the VA, it is largely
conducted by Stanford
graduates, research as
sociates, and faculty members
with joint appointments. "I'd
say that 90 percent of the
people here are at Stanford or
were there at some point,"
said Engelhardt, who received
B.A. degrees in human biol
ogy and physiological psychol
ogy here in 1981.
And it was a Stanford stu
dent who made what was
surely the most unusual inno
vation on a technological
wonder: Ph.D. candidate
Margo Apostoulous even
choreographed a ballet on the
machine.

OPEN SESAME: This voice-controlled robot arm can open a filing cabinet drawer.
Developed in Stanford's VA Hospital, it has been programmed to perform such routine tasks
and may be used in the future as an aid for quadriplegics.
