# Too many schools, too many doctors

### ALEX TARG 
"We have too many doc
tors, particularly special
ists, and we need to insti
tute birth control. We
need to quit training our
own competition, because
it is eating us alive and
weakening the very training
programs of which we are
so proud," said Dr. Robert
Petersdorf of the University
of California School of
Medicine at San Diego in a
recent issue of the New En
gland Journal of Medicine.
According to Petersdorf,
the U.S. medical schools
are in dire straits. "There
are now too many schools,
some of which are of ques
tionable quality. In states
that were once content
with two state schools
there are now three, four
or five, all competing for
resources that have not
kept up with their increas
ing demands," he said.
"Moreover, many
schools are hard pressed to
find adequate classroom
and laboratory space and
enough patients for teach
ing," he said. The sources
of these problems accor
ding to Petersdorf are
found in "the wild expan
sion of the 19705" and"the
cuts in federal funding."
Medical schools' finan
cial problems in some cases
make them raise tuition
demands "to extraordinari
ly high levels" in an effort
to stay afloat. "Some
schools are finding that the
quality of their student
body is being com
promised because the best
students are now going to
institutions with the largest
scholarships or to state in

stitutions where the tuition
is lower," he said.
"To put it bluntly, many
specialists are hurting.
There are just not enough
patients to keep them all
busy. In the communities
with which I am familiar,
there are few echocar
diograms in search of car
diologists to read them,
there is only a rare belch
wanting a gastroen
terologist, and there is not
a single, even slightly
plugged coronary that does
not have three surgeons
waiting in the wings," said
Petersdorf.
"Medical faculties have
changed from small bas
tions of threadbare gentility
to supermarkets featuring
research, teaching,
postdoctoral training, and
patient care ... All are
larger than they used to be,
all are expensive, and vir
tually all are struggling to
survive," he said.
To help solve these prob
lems, Petersdorf suggests
six steps: 1) emphasizing
quality and not quantity; 2)
going on a manpower diet
by closing some medical
schools and reducing class
sizes at others; 3) accepting
two types of faculty, both
clinicians and researchers;
4) recognizing that not
everyone is an investigator;
5) restricting research to
key areas in which the
school is well-equipped;
and 6) considering relation
ships with teaching hospi
tals not owned by medical
schools to aid in cost con
tainment.
