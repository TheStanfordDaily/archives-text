## Stanford's children of the famous-on their own

"The last thing I want is to
be singled out," says Jennifer
Grant. "I'm no more special
than anyone else here and
shouldn't be regarded as
such."
Film buffs might disagree.
Grant is the daughter of movie
stars Dyan Cannon and Cary
Grant. She is also a 17-year-old
freshman here who attends
parties, studies the Great
Works of Western Civilization,
and claims to enjoy going to
the library with a group of
friends and laughing loudly
until annoyed students clear
out.
"People probably want to
meet me because of my par
ents," Grant states, "but the
attention has already died
down. During the first couple
weeks, people would come up
to me saying, 'Aren't you Cary
Grant's daughter?' I'd rather
people get to know me before
they know who my parents
are."
Junior Mark Armstrong, son
of astronaut Neil Armstrong,
feels the same way. "I'd like
people to get to know Mark
Armstrong before they know
Neil Armstrong's son . . . Ac
tually, I'd prefer people not to
know Neil Armstrong's son at
all."
Armstrong's interests lie in
aeronautics and in nuclear fu
sion research. "Eventually, I'd

like to see the fusion process
integrated into shuttle aircraft
or spaceships ... I'd like to
travel into space, but I hope
it's commonplace by the time
I get the opportunity."
Though a child of an Ameri
can hero, Armstrong claims
that he is not singled out on
campus. "Most people don't
even know he's my father," he
says.
Do famous parents pressure
their children to follow in their
footsteps, possibly to carry on
a tradition? Freshman Andy
Arrow, son of Kenneth Arrow,
a Nobel Prize-winner in eco
nomics, says no. "My dad
says, 'Do what you want â€” if
it's economics, so be it'."
At present, Arrow's chief in
terest is music. In addition to
his private voice lessons, he
sings with the Fleet Street
Singers and the Stanford
Chorale.
Neither Grant nor senior
Tracy Kristofferson, daughter
of actor-singer-songwriter Kris
Kristofferson, feels any paren
tal pressure to go into drama.
"They'll support me in
whatever I do," states Grant.
Says Kristofferson,"Dad
wants me to do what I want.
He didn't know what he was
going to do at my age ... He
wanted to be an English pro
fessor at West Point."
Kristofferson, a human biol
ogy major with a special inter
est in sports psychology and
possibly physical therapy, has
acquired a good sense of per
spective during her years at
Stanford. "When I first came
here, I realized there were a
lot more people with more fa
mous names than mine, and
everyone here impressed me
... I always downplayed my
dad. I was too preoccupied
with other people's opinions.
I was aware that people were
aware of my name. At first, my
name overshadowed who I
was."
Kristofferson recalls finding
graffiti about her scribbled on
a desk at Meyer Library during
her freshman year. "Being sin
gled out bothered me. I didn't
like any feedback, positive or

negative . . . I've since
learned not to put others'
opinions above mine."
Grant admits that in addition
to the usual freshman-girl
treatment, she has received
many roses and friendly notes
from strangers here, most
notably from someone identi
fying himself only as "The
Zinger."
"Initially, you have to be
open to everyone," she says.
She is equally open to new
activities. "There are so many
things I'd like to do that I've
never tried," she says. Unable
to be a Crew coxswain this
quarter because of a schedul
ing conflict, she hopes to try
out soon. Drama is also in her
future plans.
Grant feels that her parents
are tough acts to follow. "It's
intimidating. I always thought
I had to live up to people's
great expectations."
Freshman Chris Caen, son
of San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Herb Caen, ex
presses a similar sentiment
about entering the field of
journalism. "It would be a
pain to live in his shadow . . .
always being compared to him
... I shouldn't try to chal
lenge him."
Caen says he is glad he has
no pressure to follow his fa
ther's footsteps. After working
for Atari over the past three
summers, he wants to go into
marketing.
Do children of celebrities
consider themselves more
"worldly" than average kids as
a result of their parents' influ
ence?
"Worldly?" repeats Grant.
"Here? No. With regards to
the average person? Yes."
"Definitely not,' says
Armstrong, "although it
opened up a lot of opportuni
ties for me (in the area of
travel).
The others agree that their
famous parents provided
them with interesting oppor
tunities.
"I go to more cultural
events," says Caen. "Maybe
I'm more social."
Arrow says he feels "more

cultured."
"I got a lot of education
from living with someone of
that (his father's) stature."
Kristofferson says she feels
"lucky." "I've been exposed
to a great variety of people.
You have to understand my fa
ther, though. He had a military
background . . . was a Rhodes
Scholar ... a fine athlete . . .
a great songwriter ... an ex
cellent painter . . . and he
wants to write a book . . . .
I'm lucky to have such a great
role model. Something's got
to rub off!"
All agree that their parents'
fame affected them only in a
minor way.
"I had a completely normal
childhood," Grant says. "My
parents kept me out of the
public eye. In public, they
made an effort not to have me
photographed . . . The atten

tion they got in public only
bothered me when it both
ered them."
"I get to meet a lot of
celebrities," states Caen.
Says Kristofferson, "It's al
ways difficult to go anywhere
in public with him (father Kris)
unless he shaves his beard."
The students claim that their
relationships with their par
ents are ordinary.
"How do I feel about Neil
Armstrong? He's my father. I
feel like a son should feel for
his father," Armstrong says.
"My father and I are real
close,"says Kristofferson."
Referring to a difficult period
in his life, she said. "I feel that
I gave him a great deal of
moral support."
Said Arrow of his famous fa
ther, "He's just a normal guy. I
mean, he's a great dad, byt
he's no Cary Grant."
