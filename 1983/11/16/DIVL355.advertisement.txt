A computer without software is like a car without an engine. It looks nice,
but it won't get you very far.
That's why, until December 31,1983, were selling the NCR Personal
Computer with three of the most popular and versatile software packages on the
market. At no extra cost.
For our 16-bit model, there's SuperCalc 2,™ the electronic spreadsheet that
speeds business planning. Then there's WordStar,™ the advanced word-processing
package. And we also throw in one of the most widely-used operating systems —
MS DOS™ —to give you access to a host of software for nearly every application.
Our 8-bit model comes with SuperCalc,™ WordStar, and CP/M 80.™
The NCR Personal Computer is one of the best-designed personal comput
ers available. Backed by NCR's 100 years of exper
ience in solving the problems of businesses. .
On its advanced features alone, it's a good
deal. With three free software packages, it's a
good deal more. jr*m
