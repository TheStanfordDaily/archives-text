## The 						Stanford Daily An all-or-nothing policy 
### 
The White House sent a letter to Stanford
Board of Trustees President William Kimball
last week. And it wasn't a nice one.
In the correspondence, Presidential Coun
selor Edwin Meese told Kimball that a Reagan
library complex without a Hoover Institution
run public affairs center was "tantamount to
making the president 'an offer he cannot ac
cept.' "
The letter came in response to an earlier let
ter Kimball sent the White House in which he
wrote that "a center for public affairs to be ad
ministered by the Hoover Institution has little
chance of approval by the trustees — even if it
means that we cannot have the library or
museum at Stanford."
Meese's scare tactic — and that's exactly
what one should call such a letter — should not
frighten the trustees. The trustees are respon

sible for protecting the interests of this univer
sity and they shouldn't forget that, no matter
the pressure from Washington, D.C.
Sure, the loss of the Reagan library would be
tremendously disappointing if no compromise
concerning control of the public affairs center
can be reached. However, the loss does not
outweigh the danger to Stanford's reputation if
a Hoover-run center is brought to this academ
ic campus.
It is difficult to understand why an agree
ment on the public affairs center can't be
reached, but if the White House and Hoover
continue to insist that no compromise is possi
ble on the proposed package, then so be it. If it
must be an all-or-nothing deal, we'd rather
take the nothing. And we encourage the trus
tees to decide the same thing at their meeting
next month.
