# Engineers and electives
## 
### 
So you think you want to be an engineer at
Stanford? You want an education from one of
the best universities, you want to reach for that
often-elusive well-paying and secure job? You
got it.
But you want to take e/ecf/Ves? Come on,
that's not part of the program.
It's the sad truth: Engineers here are increas
ingly finding it difficult to take electives as the
University piles on more and more distribution
requirements. Diversity, that paragon of a vir
tuous education, may well be a more difficult
goal for many engineers.
The facts: At least 156 of the 180 units re
quired for a bachelor's degree in engineering
have to meet the requirements of the School of
Engineering and the University. Engineering
undergraduates have to take4s units of math
and science courses, 36 units inside their major
and 36 units of engineering outside of their
major. Add distribution requirements to this
and vou have an incredible load.

It's not that the program itself seems to be
suffering incredibly because of the require
ments. The School of Engineering here
remains among the best in the country and the
University's proximity to Silicon Valley is cer
tainly fortuitous — both for the local busi
nesses and for the Stanford community.
The catch is the lack of academic alternatives
for engineering students. Engineering courses
are often so demanding that engineers just
don't have the time to dabble in many course
areas beyond their requirements. Many feel
constrained and locked in — they just can't af
ford to take that English class or that history
class and they miss an opportunity to take ad
vantage of the diversity the University has to
offer.
The School of Engineering's attempts to rem
edy the situation by reviewing its course re
quirements can only be lauded. The school is
still looking at a number of different proposals
for changes, but a program reevaluation — the
first in 16 years — is long overdue.
