# Is Mosher guilty as charged?
## 
### 
The Steven Mosher case has
become something of a cause
celebre. Since his dismissal from the
Stanford Anthropology Department,
he has received a rash of publicity,
including an appearance on "60
Minutes."
Mosher claims that he was thrown
out because of pressure from the
Chinese government. The Anthro
pology Department said he was dis
missed for "illegal and seriously un
ethical conduct" that "endangered
his research subjects." Neither side
has released the47-page report
detailing the charges and evidence
against him. The University says the
report is confidential because it is
part of Mosher's file, although Mos
her is free to release it if he wishes.
Mosher has not released the report,
saying that he does not want to
publicize slander against himself.
Stanford's conduct in the affair
has been significantly criticized in
the media. Mosher's charges that
the Chinese government railroaded
the Anthropology Department have
been taken seriously. The depart
ment has also been criticized for
its decision to keep the report
confidential. Perhaps it is worth ex
amining these charges.
The Anthropology Department
has kept Mosher's file confidential.
The file is part of his student
records, and should be kept private
for that reason. The federal Family
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 re
quires that most student records be
released only with the consent of
the student involved. If Mosher
wants the report released, he can
release it himself. It is his decision.
Mosher has said that the report
slanders him. If its charges are
based on scanty evidence, releasing
it will bolster his case. In the past,
he has said that publishing the
report would endanger innocent
parties still in China. If this is true,
then perhaps Mosher could release
major portions of the report, delet
ing names where necessary.
However, criticizing Stanford for
withholding the report is ridiculous.
Despite all the publicity, Mosher is
entitled to confidentiality, until he
decides otherwise.

The department has also been
accused of acting unfairly in ousting
Mosher. A San Diego Union edito
rial says,"The fact that no reasons
for the expulsion have been made
public gives credibility to the
suspicion . . . that Stanford acted to
appease the Chinese." Mosher says
that the pressure stems from
Chinese anger over an article about
forced abortions he published in a
Taiwanese newsmagazine. The An
thropology Department says that, al
though Mosher used questionable
judgment in choosing the maga
zine, it was not a factor in the deci
sion.
Most criticism of the depart
ment's action ignores several fac
tors. After long and careful consid
eration, the tenured faculty voted
unanimously to expel Mosher.
While Chinese pressure might sway
a few votes, it is hard to believe that
they could affect the whole depart
ment. Mosher's case has now been
reviewed by an independent com
mittee of scholars, by Associate
Dean Albert Gelpi and by Vice
Provost Gerald Lieberman, all of
whom found the report thorough,
balanced and impartial. Again,
could the Chinese government have
fooled or intimidated all of the
reviewers?
Stanford went to considerable ef
fort to treat Mosher fairly. They pro
vided funds to support him during
the investigation, and to defend
himself. The case was considered
twice, in November 1981 when it
was dropped for lack of evidence,
and again in early 1962.
It is hard to evaluate the charges
against Mosher, since so little has
been released. Almost all of the bits
that have come out have come from
Mosher, making it impossible to ob
tain a balanced picture. This is to be
expected, given the University's ob
ligation to protect his privacy, but it
does make the picture murkier.
Mosher says the charges come from
three things: his articles in the
Taiwanese magazine, statements
from his ex-wife and allegations
from the Chinese government. Very
little has been said about the nature
of the charges against him.

Rumors circulating around Stan
ford have said that Mosher was ex
pelled for bribing Chinese officials
to get access to secret documents,
probably economic records. In an
interview, Mosher commented, "I
took full advantage of the situa
tion." The Los Angeles Times has re
ported that "the anthropology fac
ulty said that he (Mosher) had ob
tained some of the information
through bribery and has violated the
privacy of the community he was
studying."
It seems likely that Mosher ob
tained access to records that the
Chinese government later decided
he should not have seen. This is not
at all unethical. However, bribery is
a fairly common and accepted
practice in many areas of the world,
and he might later have found it ex
pedient to try to enhance his access
to these documents by feeding a
few palms. However, both the
Chinese government and Stanford
University would be expected to
take a very dim view of it.
Mosher later commented that an
thropology is "a very loose dis
cipline" with "no elaborate codes of
conduct." While the above is
speculation, it is apparent that Mos
her and the Anthropology Depart
ment have a definite disagreement
over what conduct is appropriate for
anthropologists. Until Mosher
decides to release the report, there
is no point in condemning either
side on the basis of speculation.

Mosher later commented that an

Through the Murky Waters
The Steven Mosher case has
become something of a cause
celebre. Since his dismissal from the
Stanford Anthropology Department,
he has received a rash of publicity,
including an appearance on "60
Minutes."
Mosher claims that he was thrown
out because of pressure from the
Chinese government. The Anthro
pology Department said he was dis
missed for "illegal and seriously un
ethical conduct" that "endangered
his research subjects." Neither side
has released the47-page report
detailing the charges and evidence
against him. The University says the
report is confidential because it is
part of Mosher's file, although Mos
her is free to release it if he wishes.
Mosher has not released the report,
saying that he does not want to
publicize slander against himself.
Stanford's conduct in the affair
has been significantly criticized in
the media. Mosher's charges that
the Chinese government railroaded
the Anthropology Department have
been taken seriously. The depart
ment has also been criticized for
its decision to keep the report
confidential. Perhaps it is worth ex
amining these charges.
The Anthropology Department
has kept Mosher's file confidential.
The file is part of his student
records, and should be kept private
for that reason. The federal Family
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 re
quires that most student records be
released only with the consent of
the student involved. If Mosher
wants the report released, he can
release it himself. It is his decision.
Mosher has said that the report
slanders him. If its charges are
based on scanty evidence, releasing
it will bolster his case. In the past,
he has said that publishing the
report would endanger innocent
parties still in China. If this is true,
then perhaps Mosher could release
major portions of the report, delet
ing names where necessary.
However, criticizing Stanford for
withholding the report is ridiculous.
Despite all the publicity, Mosher is
entitled to confidentiality, until he
decides otherwise.

The department has also been
accused of acting unfairly in ousting
Mosher. A San Diego Union edito
rial says,"The fact that no reasons
for the expulsion have been made
public gives credibility to the
suspicion . . . that Stanford acted to
appease the Chinese." Mosher says
that the pressure stems from
Chinese anger over an article about
forced abortions he published in a
Taiwanese newsmagazine. The An
thropology Department says that, al
though Mosher used questionable
judgment in choosing the maga
zine, it was not a factor in the deci
sion.
Most criticism of the depart
ment's action ignores several fac
tors. After long and careful consid
eration, the tenured faculty voted
unanimously to expel Mosher.
While Chinese pressure might sway
a few votes, it is hard to believe that
they could affect the whole depart
ment. Mosher's case has now been
reviewed by an independent com
mittee of scholars, by Associate
Dean Albert Gelpi and by Vice
Provost Gerald Lieberman, all of
whom found the report thorough,
balanced and impartial. Again,
could the Chinese government have
fooled or intimidated all of the
reviewers?
Stanford went to considerable ef
fort to treat Mosher fairly. They pro
vided funds to support him during
the investigation, and to defend
himself. The case was considered
twice, in November 1981 when it
was dropped for lack of evidence,
and again in early 1962.
It is hard to evaluate the charges
against Mosher, since so little has
been released. Almost all of the bits
that have come out have come from
Mosher, making it impossible to ob
tain a balanced picture. This is to be
expected, given the University's ob
ligation to protect his privacy, but it
does make the picture murkier.
Mosher says the charges come from
three things: his articles in the
Taiwanese magazine, statements
from his ex-wife and allegations
from the Chinese government. Very
little has been said about the nature
of the charges against him.

Rumors circulating around Stan
ford have said that Mosher was ex
pelled for bribing Chinese officials
to get access to secret documents,
probably economic records. In an
interview, Mosher commented, "I
took full advantage of the situa
tion." The Los Angeles Times has re
ported that "the anthropology fac
ulty said that he (Mosher) had ob
tained some of the information
through bribery and has violated the
privacy of the community he was
studying."

tained access to records that the

he should not have seen. This is not
at all unethical. However, bribery is
