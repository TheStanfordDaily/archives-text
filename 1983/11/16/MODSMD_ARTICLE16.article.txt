Rally conduct
I am writing to support the posi
tion which the city of San Francisco
has taken in view of the upcoming
Big Came rally (Daily, Nov. 11).
An advisor to the rally planning
Fiesta Committee was quoted as
saying, "If there is any problem
with vandalism or alcohol, the city
made it clear this would be the last
rally." As guests of the city, we
should not abuse our privilege by
irresponsible actions. The people of
San Francisco most likely did not
ask us to use their city for our rally.
Therefore, it is their right to ask us
not to return if we turn out to be
ungracious guests.
The majority of us will conduct
ourselves properly Friday, yet we
must still be held accountable if
even a few act out of order. We
cannot afford to stand back and
watch others act irresponsibly. If
we do, we will ultimately be held
liable for their actions and will have
to pay the consequences in years to
come.

Meese warning
I would like to urge the Stanford
community to consider the
meaning of Edwin Meese's impor
tuning of the trustees to accept a
Hoover-run public affairs center as
part of an all-or-nothing Reagan
complex. His warning that a library
coupled with a University-governed
policy center is an "offer (Reagan)
cannot accept" can only mean one

of two things, and we should be
pleased by neither.
First, such a hard-line stance
could mean that the policy center is
intended, as many of us suspected,
as a thinly veiled megaphone for
the Far Right. Since this purpose
would be effectively short-circuited
by even-handed administration, a
center run by the "liberal" Univer
sity wou Id of course be unaccept
able to those whose interests are
more narrow than the term public
affairs center might imply.
The second possible implication
of Meese's threat should trouble
even those who support the
Reagan complex. If Reagan and
Hoover truly desire a neutral policy
center, their flat refusal to let the
University administer it can only be
taken as an assertion that the Uni
versity is incapable of doing the
job. The trustees and administra
tion of Stanford have been insulted
by such a no-confidence vote.
Under such circumstances, it
seems better that Stanford make
Reagan and Hoover an offer they
cannot accept than to let the Great
Communicator make Stanford an
offer it can't refuse.

More on tenure
In a follow-up of the editorial
"The problem with tenure" (Daily,
Nov. 9), regarding the small num
ber of women faculty and citing
that the limited number of tenured

positions is the cause, I wish to
point out a corollary in administra
tive positions.
Again, the problem is not limited
to women and powerful administra
tive posts. As the University
imposes the $10 million cutback in
administrative costs, many posi
tions are eliminated or
downgraded. Thus, we have the
anomaly of two full dean positions
(graduate studies and undergradu
ate studies) being divided and
condensed into duties assigned to
two new associate dean positions.
Dr. Jean Fetter and Dr. Carolyn
Lougee ably carry enormous re
sponsibilities, but as associate
deans. With no nefarious intent,
women are carrying the same
former responsibilities as men. But
the men were full deans.
Overtly, the University has made
a conspicuous effort to place in
higher administrative posts. But the
escalation of women has occurred
concurrent with significant
downgrading of the positions be
cause of "budgetary considera
tions." Since this happens routinely
throughout the society to women,
perhaps we ought to consider both
the tenure inequity and the admin
istrative inequity from the view
point of "where life is lived" rather
than passively accepting the "that's
the way it is" rationale of number
of positions and budgetary cuts. For
women, "where life is lived" is too
often in jobs a level or two below
their qualifications and ability.

to women and powerful administra
tive posts. As the University
imposes the $10 million cutback in
administrative costs, many posi
tions are eliminated or
downgraded. Thus, we have the
anomaly of two full dean positions
(graduate studies and undergradu
ate studies) being divided and
condensed into duties assigned to
two new associate dean positions.
Dr. Jean Fetter and Dr. Carolyn
Lougee ably carry enormous re
sponsibilities, but as associate
deans. With no nefarious intent,
women are carrying the same
former responsibilities as men. But
the men were full deans.
Overtly, the University has made
a conspicuous effort to place in
higher administrative posts. But the
escalation of women has occurred
concurrent with significant
downgrading of the positions be
cause of "budgetary considera
tions." Since this happens routinely
throughout the society to women,
perhaps we ought to consider both
the tenure inequity and the admin
istrative inequity from the view
point of "where life is lived" rather
than passively accepting the "that's
the way it is" rationale of number
of positions and budgetary cuts. For
women, "where life is lived" is too
often in jobs a level or two below
their qualifications and ability.
