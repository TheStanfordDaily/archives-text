## Interview with the U.C.B. 
### 
I feel so defeated. Once again, I've been unable to
disprove that The Daily conducted one of these
damned interviews. So, here it is . . . in all its dis
repute: an interview with Ulysses S. Crow, representa
tive of the Union of California Birds (UCB).
Daily: What message do you bring from on high?
UCB: That we're fed up with being deceived by Stan
ford. We believed you wanted us. Thought well of us.
Actually cared. Instead, you've turned out to be a pack
of vultures.
Daily: You say that you've been taken in by Stanford?
UCB: Yes, we were really gullible. Absolute pigeons.
Real dodos.
Daily: How can you feel that way? I personally love
birds.
UCB: I bet that you frequently tell people, "Some of
my best friends are birds. I just don't want my sister to
marry a turkey."
Daily: No. Really. All the cyclists on campus find it
thrilling to chase a bevy of quail. Many workaholic
Ph.D. students are night owls. And everyone is en
raptured by raptors.
UCB: Sure. Sure. Be as lyrical as you want. But we
know how you really feel. Over and over, again we've
heard you say, "Cardinal, the color not the bird!"
Daily: Has your group devised any plans for revenge?
UCB: Yes, we intend the massive destruction of Stan
ford University. Already, the blue jays are starving Stan
ford denizens by fighting them for their lunches. The
red-headed woodpeckers are slowly pounding the
beams in the Quad to oblivion. And the eagles will
prevent the rise of future generations of Stanford stu
dents.
Daily: How can they accomplish that goal?
UCB: They're going to swoop down from the sky

onto the playgrounds of Escondido Village. And they'll
carry off all the noisy brats to nests in the hills, where
they'll feed them to little eaglets.
Daily: That's a horrible thing to say. You're going to
give nightmares to all the children on campus.
UCB: Don't be ridiculous. No self-respecting child
bothers to read a newspaper that prints interviews with
birds.
Daily: (deflated) Yes, I suppose you're right. In any
case, it surprises me that you've been so successful in
your organizing and planning.
UCB: After all, we're not bird-brained. Besides,
we've bought in consultants from Bodega Bay.
Daily: Are the birds unanimous in their enmity
toward Stanford?
UCB: No. We suspect those red-breasted robins to
be turncoats. Even now, one of them is enrolled at the
Graduate School of Business. There's a falcon at the
Food Research Institute. Some bird in Geology has
been mocking our group. And then there's the banded
warblers, who tried to stop Cal on The Play of last year's
Big Game.
Daily: Larks and Thrushes and Bears! Oh my!
UCB: Yes, Cal is for the birds! So well be helping
them by flying over the crowd, bombarding all the
people wearing red.
Daily: They'll be sitting ducks. Is there no way for
them to escape?
UCB: Not unless they buy umbrellas. We'll be haw
king them in the stands.
