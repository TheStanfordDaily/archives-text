## Keeping in touch with your body: the right answers 
### 
The 1980s have been
heralded as the age in which
people seem to he getting
in touch with their bodies. But
many commonly-held beliefs
about health and the human
body are incorrect. Some ex
amples follow.
People are fat because they
eat too much.
Numerous studies have
shown that obese people eat
no more than persons of nor
mal we'ght. As Dr Peter
Wood, associate director ot
the Stanford Hea» 112 Disease
Prevention Program, points
out, the major different e is in
exercise levels — fat people
are not as physically active as
4 hoir slimmer counterparts.
112 ercise, not diet, is the key
t, /veight control.
Getting a suntan is good for

the skin.
Not so. Exposure to the
ultraviolet rays of the sun is a
major cause of wrinkling and
excessive exposure can result
in skin cancer. Sunlight does
help (he body make vitamin D,
essential for good health; but
15-40 minutes of sunlight is
sufficient tor this purpose.
Catching some rays at
DeGuerre is one of the most
popular spring activities at
Si rnford, but don't overdue it
or you II end up looking like a
prune someday!
Smiling causes wrinkles.
No way. Aging and overex
posure to the sun causes
wrinkles. Your skin is quite
elastic and easily returns to its
natural form after a smile.
Never read in the dark — it
will ruin your eyes.

Dim light has no effect on
eyesight. The reason for not
reading in the dark is that you
can't see.
Vigorous exercise makes you
eat more.
Actually exercise acts as an
appetite depressant. You will
tend to eat more when you are
sedentary. This is one reason
while cattle breeders pen up
their animals — so they will
eat more and get nice and fat.
Exercising a part of the body
will not remove fat from that
area of the body. Exercise will
strengthen a muscle and tone
an area, but the only way to
lose fat is to take in fewer
calories than you burn up. The
body will then make up the
deficit bv burning up stored
body fat. This process will
happen differently for people

with different body types and
theie is nothing you can do to
change it.
Natural vitamins are better
than synthetic ones.
A vitamin is a vitamin is a vi
tamin. Natural vitamins are
more costly, but not more
healthful. Vitamins are made
up of molecules and it doesn't
matter if they are strung to
gether by a plant growing out
of the ground or by a factory
in New Jersey.
Washing v/ith soap and water
is good for vour skin.
Washing with soap removes
dirt, oil, dead cells and sweat
from your face. That's good.
However soap and water also
remove many natuial facial
oils and that's not so good. If
you do use soap, it would be a
good idea to replace these lost
oils.
If your bodv retains water,
you should drink less of it.
Water retention depends on
salt intake. If you want to
retain less water, the way to

do it is to reduce your salt
intake. Water is an essential
nutrient. If you want to weigh
less lose fat, not water.
It is necessary to sleep eight
hours each night.
Sleep requirements vary
with the individual. The typical
range is from six and one half
to nine hours. The important
thing is how you teel during
the day. If you are falling
asleep in class, you should
probably be getting more
sleep. According to Prof.
William Dement, director of
the Stanford Sleep Clinic,
most Stanford students do not
get enough sleep. Regular
sleep habits are important to
your health. Pulling all
nighters and then trying to
catch up on the weekends is
not a healthy way to sleep.
Shampoo every day and your
hair will fall out.
Shampooing does not cause
hair loss or baldness. When
you shampoo, a certain
amount of dead hairs comes

off the scalp. The loss of
40 to 100 hairs a day is nor
mal — after all you have
90,000 to 140,000 of them. You
should, however, avoid harsh
detergent shampoos which
cause breakageand split ends.
An apple a day keeps the doc
tor away.
Apples are actually not as
nutritious as some other
fruits. A piece of cantaloupe of
equal calories is much higher
is vitamins and minerals.
Apples do have a substantial
amount of fiber (two grams for
a medium apple) and they
help to clean the teeth.
Lifting weights will give wo
men big muscles.
Women who lift weights will
not get big muscles because
they do not have the male
hormone necessary to in
crease muscle size substantial
ly. Also muscle size can only
be increased by lifting large
weights. Several studies have

shown that women who lift
relatively light weights regu
larly actually decrease certain
body dimensions — their
waist, hips and thighs get
smaller.
Eating a lot of protein is nec
essary if you exercise a lot.
Carbohydrates, and to a les
ser extent fats, are the primary
energy sources. Eating extra
protein does not give you
added energy, nor does it
build strength. Apart from an
increased need for certain B
vitamins, people who are
physically active should eat a
normal diet with an emphasis
on whole grains, fruits and
vegetables. Eating steak or
other protein foods, especially
right before physical activity,
will only result in poorer, not
better, performance.
