# Sandinista official appeals to U.S. intellectuals
## Nicaragua fears imminent U.S. invasion 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
A U.S. blockade of Nicaraguan waters
and Washington's deployment of Marines in
Honduras and Costa, Rica signals an imminent
invasion of Nicaragua by the United States, an
official of the Sandinista government said here
yesterday.
"The invasion is not going to be that easy,"
Noel Corea, director of international relations
for the Sandinista Association of Cultural
Workers, told 150 people gathered for a teach
in at the Center for Educational Research at
Stanford (CERAS) Auditorium. Corea spoke with
Spanish Prof. Fernando Alegria, Education Prof.
Martin Carnoy and Susanne )onas of San Fran
cisco's Institute for the Study of Labor and Eco
nomic Crises.
"We are not going to be taken by surprise,"
Corea said. "It is going to take a lot of time and
firepower to make a cemetery of Nicaragua."
He denied charges that the Reagan adminis
tration's recent displays of military force are de
signed to pressure the Sandinista government
to make concessions for peace.
"What is a psychological war for the U.S. ad
ministration is a real war for us," he said. "We
have given 500 lives in what the United States
calls a psychological war."
The invasion of Grenada has been used by the
Reagan administration to prepare the American
public for war, according to Corea. He cau
tioned that the strong resistance U.S. troops
faced from a few Cuban workers in Grenada
demonstrates that the United States would have

a tough time invading Nicaragua.
"In every city and town we will fight hard," he
said. "There will be many lives lost."
The Nicaraguan government is considered a
threat by the Reagan administration because it is
a popular, revolutionary regime, Corea said.
"The people of Nicaragua are convinced that
we (the Sandinistas) are working for a better so
ciety," he said. "That is something the Reagan
administration doesn't understand."

The United States is trying to destroy the
Nicaraguan economy by directing counter
revolutionaries to attack harbors, oil storage
centers and Managua International Airport,
Corea said, "but our economy keeps going and
we keep going."
He read a 5-page appeal for support of the
Sandinista government from more than 60
Nicaraguan artists and intellectuals and said the

statement was written Friday in Managua, the
country's capita!.
"We ask vou, artists and intellectuals of the
world, to build a wall against aggression,
through words and concrete action," the state
ment said.
"May it go down in the history of humanity,"
the appeal continued, 'that ... in the face of
the gigantic aggression that one of the smallest
countries of the world, Nicaragua, was about to
suffer, artists and intellectuals of different
nationalities and generations raised along with
us the banner of fraternity in order to prevent
our total destruction."
Alegria agreed that U.S. troops will invade
Nicaragua soon.
"After the events in Grenada, it seems that
this incredible act (an invasion) might take place
any time at any moment," Alegria said, adding
that such an action would be consistent with the
U.S. history of aggression in Latin America.
Carnoy said an invasion of Nicaragua by the
United States would be ironic because the
United States was born out of a revolution.
"The fact that the United States turns around
and says nobody else can have a revolution is
one of the great ironies of history," he said.
Jonas said an invasion of Nicaragua is inevi
table because U.S.-backed counter
revolutionaries have failed to overthrow the
Sandinistas.
The Reagan administration's policies in
Central America are those of a government de
termined to stop any form of social change, she
said.
