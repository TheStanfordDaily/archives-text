## Sports Spotlight The 						Wyman brothers play together, stay together 
### BETH KLEID 
Numbers 92 and 79 on
the Stanford football team
both have the same name
on their jerseys, and they
both have the same smile.
The similiarities between
the two Cardinal Wymans
are more than coincidental
— they are fraternal.
The brothers that
climbed trees together and
helped each other in
schoolyard fights when
they were growing up, now
play college football to
gether. But senior Mike
Wyman and sophomore
Dave have always stuck to
gether. "We are really
close brothers," said Mike
Wyman.
In fact the relationship

between the two goes
beyond that of most
siblings — it is a true
friendship. Because the
Wyman family led a tran
sient life, the two relied on
each other as constant
companions.
"My dad is in the logging
industry, and we moved
about every two years. I
don't have any other
lifelong friends, " said
Mike.
The family moved from
mill town to mill town, and
as a result of the bad times
they endured together thev
became very close. "We
had some very poor times. I
remember eating macaroni
and cheese and milk for
many dinners," he said.

"My dad was working and
going to college, and my
mom was typing his
papers."
The bond that developed
between the Wyman family
during those trying times
has lasted. And it has
become even stronger over
the years.
This season the Wymans'
parents have traveled trom
their home in Keno,
Nevada to attend every
single Stanford football
game. Our parents are
very proud of us. Without
their support and help I
don t think that we would
have ever made it this far."
The Wymans' parents
have a right to be proud.
Both of their sons are

stand-outs on the football
team here. Mike, who
starts as left tackle, has 34
total tackles this season, 22
of them solo efforts. He
also has recovered two
fumbles and deflected two
parses.
Dave, the team s premier
middle linebacker, leads
Stanford with 126 total
tackles, including 83 unas
sisted ones, and three in
terceptions.
The two have been
playing football together
for a long time. "I remem
ber when we were younger
we would go outside with
three sweatshirts on and

play in the mud. But we
never really played organ
ized football on a team
when we were \oung."
Mike's first introduction
to organized high school
football was at Marvsville
High School near
Sacramento. He had a poor
treshrnan season because
he was not experienced. By
the time he moved to
VVooster High School in
Reno during his junior
vear, Wvman had definitely
developed as a football
player. He established the
Wvman name, and paved
the way for his brother.
"I've always been the
trailblazer," he said. "But it
seems that whatever I did,
Dave came along and did
better."
Mike describes his brot
her as a natural athlete.
"He was called 'Superman
in Nevada." Dave was a
two-time all-state choice in
football who directed his
team to the Nevada AAA
championship, and as a
member of the track team at
VVooster he won the shot
put, 100-meter, and 220-
meter race in a Northern
Nevada track meet.
"Compared to Dave I'm
not a natural athlete. He's
the one with the real raw
talent," said Mike, "I
definitely have to work
more at it."
Mike has accomplished a
variety of athletic feats in
his own right. He was voted
the 1979 Nevada State
Player of the Year after a
phenomenal senior year,
and he played four years of
basketball.
Mike turned down offers
to play for major Pac-10
schools and Ivy League
teams to come to Stanford.
"It was a tough decision. I

liked Washington a lot but
it you are an\ kind ot stu
dent a Stanford diploma
plus plaving in the best
conference in the nation is
hard to resist, " he said.
The Wyman t'amiK trust
and loyalty entered into
Mike's decision. The senior
noted that one of the
reasons he chose Stanford
was because his father
wanted him to come here.
"I partially did it for him,
but it worked out best for
me, too."
Dave, who was recruited
"everywhere" according to
Mike, chose Stanford for
the same kinds of reasons.
"But one added one, of
course. He wanted to be
able to play on a team with

me said Mike.
Mike describes himself
as more ot a student than
his brother. "It's a known
t.n t in our family, and Dave
will admit it." The senior is
an economics major who
plans to go into a business
with his father in the
future. Dave is also consid
ering the economics major.
Before Mike ventures out
into the business world, he
aims to play professional
football. "I want to walk on
as a tree agent," he said.
Its always been a dream
of mine, and if I don't try
I II always wonder if I could
have made it in pro foot
ball. "
Mike admits that his
vounger sibling is stronger,
faster and more agile than
he is. Are there ever any
feelings of jealousy be
tween the brothers? Mike
firmly says that there are
none at all.
"Jealousy has never been
a problem with us. In our
family we are always so
happy for the other person
because we have been
through so much to
gether," said Mike.

The unselfish attitude be
tween the brothers in
regard to sports charac
terizes their entire relation
ship. Mike helped Dave ad
just to the Farm when he
was a freshman, and he
gives him advice.
hor Mike, student sup
port makes a difference. "A
high point of my career
here was when we beat
Ohio State last year, and
people actually met us
when we got back. The
Band was there, and it was
like a real rally."
The senior realizes that it
is hard for students to sup
port a losing team. But
despite a somewhat apat
hetic group of fans, he said
that the football team mem
bers are "extra psyched"
for Big Game. "It's going to
be a war."
In this war the two
Wyman brothers will be
fighting together. In addi
tion to being teammates,
the two are housemates in
the Delta Upsilon frater
nity. And the brothers are
dating sisters at Stanford.
"I guess we just like the
same things," said Mike.
