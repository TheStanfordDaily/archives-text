## Four seconds can make a season of difference 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
One hippo, two hippo, three hippo,
four hippo.
Four seconds. Most people consider it
a short time. Coaches call it an eternity.
But a lot can happen in the space of four
seconds. A football game can be lost. A
football season can be ruined.
In this most forgettable of forgettable
Stanford football seasons, it is not hard
to find a scapegoat: "The coaching
sucks. The players are worse."
Faulty coaching or an alleged lack of
talent aren't to blame for the 1-9 record.
Blame it on four seconds. Four seconds
as in The Play, the Miracle at Memorial,
or, in Stanford circles, The Big Rip-Off.
Four seconds and five laterals after
Stanford evidently had locked up the
84th Big Game and thrown away the key,
the boys from UC-Berkeley did what is
still referred to as the impossible.
They scored.
Stanford players stood on the sideline
shocked. The Stanford Band stood in the
end zone shocked. The Stanford fans
stood on their seats shocked.
Needless to say, the folks from Cal
were estatic.
When the cannon on the hill above
Cal's Memorial Stadium sounded, sig
nifying the Bears were Big Game win

ners, Stanford had lost more than a foot
hall game.
The 25-20 decision in Cal's favor cost
Stanford a winning season — the Car
dinal finished 5-6. It cost Stanford a trip
to a bowl game — the Hall of Fame Bowl
against Vanderbilt. It also cost Stanford a
coach — Paul Wiggin.
"I would hope that four seconds
doesn't determine that I'm a success or a
failure," said Wiggin, who submitted his
letter of resignation last week. "But
maybe it did."
It did all right. Not because of Wig
gin's coaching abilities, but because of
the situation. Wiggin was a victim of cir
cumstance. Just as the Cal players were
in the right places at the right time when
receiving the assorted laterals on the
now famous kick-off return, the Card
coach was in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
So much hung in the balance on that
chilly Saturday afternoon in Berkeley.
The Stanford football program appeared
to be on the rebound. Win the Big Game
and finish the regular season over .500.
Co to a bowl game. Land top recruits.
Someday go to the Rose Bowl.
In four seconds, it all came tumbling
down. A domino fell on its neighbor,
which fell on its neighbor, which fell on

The sudden, spectacular loss to Cal set
off a chain of events which a year later
left the Stanford football team with a 1-9
record and the Stanford Athletic Depart

ment with a $500,000-plus deficit. While
Wiggin may have been building charac
ter amid the defeats, character does not
show up on the Athletic Department's
budget statement. In Athletic Director
Andy Geiger's words, it was time for a
change.
But the biggest problem of losing the
Big Game the way Stanford did centered
around John Elway, Stanford's a 11 -
everything quarterback.
In four years at Stanford, Elway,
heralded as the "best-ever" to play his
position, went to no Rose Bowls. He was
on one winning team. He won no Heis
man trophies.
Elway, however, won his share of per
sonal accolades. He busted conference
and national records like it was going out
of style. He rewrote the school record
books. The John Elway team seemed
charmed. No matter how many points
the team was down, it always seemed as
if the Card could come back and —
maybe — win.
Elway was a team player. He was a
company man. He wanted a winning
record and a bowl bid his senior season
so bad he could taste it.
Big Game 1982 was his chance, it was
Elway's Last Stand. No dice.
Elway's frustration carried over into

the entire Stanford football program. If
the team with great )ohn Elway couldn't
win and couldn't go to a bowl game at
Stanford, then maybe no Cardinal team
could. The team that seemingly was
assured of attaining its goal lost it.
Stanford was a loser in the public's
eye. It was also a loser in the minds of
Stanford players and coaches, although
they'd be the last to admit it. The faith in
the comeback had vanished.
No matter how hard they tried, they
couldn't prevail. Wiggin, reflecting on
his soon-to-end coaching career at Stan
ford, said, "There were some times
when we climbed a mountain, really
climbed a mountain."
In four seconds, however, the moun
tain suddenly became too high.
Had Stanford won last year's Big
Game, things would have been different
this season. "The spirit of all that
changes a number of things," Wiggin
said. "You evaluate things differently."
You win Big Game 1982 and you finish
with a winning regular season record.
You go to the Hall of Fame Bowl. You en
ter spring football and August's pre
season practice with a different attitude.
A winning attitude.
But it was not to be. Fate took care of
that.

sucks. The players are worse."
Faulty coaching or an alleged lack of
talent aren't to blame for the 1-9 record.
Blame it on four seconds. Four seconds
as in The Play, the Miracle at Memorial,
or, in Stanford circles, The Big Rip-Off.
Four seconds and five laterals after
Stanford evidently had locked up the
84th Big Game and thrown away the key,
the boys from UC-Berkeley did what is
still referred to as the impossible.
They scored.
Stanford players stood on the sideline
shocked. The Stanford Band stood in the
end zone shocked. The Stanford fans
stood on their seats shocked.
Needless to say, the folks from Cal
were estatic.
When the cannon on the hill above
Cal's Memorial Stadium sounded, sig
nifying the Bears were Big Game win

ners, Stanford had lost more than a foot
hall game.
The 25-20 decision in Cal's favor cost
Stanford a winning season — the Car
dinal finished 5-6. It cost Stanford a trip
to a bowl game — the Hall of Fame Bowl
against Vanderbilt. It also cost Stanford a
coach — Paul Wiggin.
"I would hope that four seconds
doesn't determine that I'm a success or a
failure," said Wiggin, who submitted his
letter of resignation last week. "But
maybe it did."
It did all right. Not because of Wig
gin's coaching abilities, but because of
the situation. Wiggin was a victim of cir
cumstance. Just as the Cal players were
in the right places at the right time when
receiving the assorted laterals on the
now famous kick-off return, the Card
coach was in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
So much hung in the balance on that
chilly Saturday afternoon in Berkeley.
The Stanford football program appeared
to be on the rebound. Win the Big Game
and finish the regular season over .500.
Co to a bowl game. Land top recruits.
Someday go to the Rose Bowl.
In four seconds, it all came tumbling
down. A domino fell on its neighbor,
which fell on its neighbor, which fell on

The sudden, spectacular loss to Cal set
off a chain of events which a year later
left the Stanford football team with a 1-9
record and the Stanford Athletic Depart

ment with a $500,000-plus deficit. While
Wiggin may have been building charac
ter amid the defeats, character does not
show up on the Athletic Department's
budget statement. In Athletic Director
Andy Geiger's words, it was time for a
change.
But the biggest problem of losing the
Big Game the way Stanford did centered
around John Elway, Stanford's a 11 -
everything quarterback.
In four years at Stanford, Elway,
heralded as the "best-ever" to play his
position, went to no Rose Bowls. He was
on one winning team. He won no Heis
man trophies.
Elway, however, won his share of per
sonal accolades. He busted conference
and national records like it was going out
of style. He rewrote the school record
books. The John Elway team seemed
charmed. No matter how many points
the team was down, it always seemed as
if the Card could come back and —
maybe — win.
Elway was a team player. He was a
company man. He wanted a winning
record and a bowl bid his senior season
so bad he could taste it.
Big Game 1982 was his chance, it was
Elway's Last Stand. No dice.
Elway's frustration carried over into

the entire Stanford football program. If
the team with great )ohn Elway couldn't
win and couldn't go to a bowl game at
Stanford, then maybe no Cardinal team
could. The team that seemingly was
assured of attaining its goal lost it.
Stanford was a loser in the public's
eye. It was also a loser in the minds of
Stanford players and coaches, although
they'd be the last to admit it. The faith in
the comeback had vanished.
No matter how hard they tried, they
couldn't prevail. Wiggin, reflecting on
his soon-to-end coaching career at Stan
ford, said, "There were some times
when we climbed a mountain, really
climbed a mountain."
In four seconds, however, the moun
tain suddenly became too high.
Had Stanford won last year's Big
Game, things would have been different
this season. "The spirit of all that
changes a number of things," Wiggin
said. "You evaluate things differently."
You win Big Game 1982 and you finish
with a winning regular season record.
You go to the Hall of Fame Bowl. You en
ter spring football and August's pre
season practice with a different attitude.
A winning attitude.
But it was not to be. Fate took care of
that.


Big Game 1982
One hippo, two hippo, three hippo,
four hippo.
Four seconds. Most people consider it
a short time. Coaches call it an eternity.
But a lot can happen in the space of four
seconds. A football game can be lost. A
football season can be ruined.
In this most forgettable of forgettable
Stanford football seasons, it is not hard
to find a scapegoat: "The coaching
sucks. The players are worse."

talent aren't to blame for the 1-9 record.
