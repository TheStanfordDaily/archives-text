### JOHN LIS 
The Stanford women's basketball team will
open its season tonight against Fresno State
with a young group. Head Coach Dotty McCrea
will have four new starters in the lineup, having
lost five of last year's top six players to gradua
tion.
The only returning starter is 5-foot-2-inch
sophomore point guard Virginia Sourlis, a
freshman Ail-American last season. Returners
from last year who will move into starting roles
this season are 6-2 sophomore center Sarah
Evans, 6-0 junior forward Mary Bradach, and 5-7
senior guard Lee Ann Margerum. Rounding out
the first five is 6-1 freshman forward Kim Mer
cer, a third team high school All-American last
year.
Coming off the bench will be returning
player Judy Carter, a 5-11 senior forward and
Judy Griffith, a 5-10 sophomore guard, along
with three freshmen — 5-6 guard Erica Mueser,

6-1 forward Karen Goedewaagen and Sue
Sebolt.
McCrea said that the Cardinal will use some
new ideas to take advantage of the strengths
the team does have. "We have more overall
team speed this year, so we can do more with
that. We'll be doing things like playing more
man-to-man defense."
This season Stanford will play a 28-game
schedule, including three games in the Miami
Dial Classic in January, and a 14-game Western
Collegiate Athletic Association slate, featuring
two games with defending national champion
use.
Fresno State is an ideal opening foe for Stan
ford. McCrea said, "They're as young as we
are. They have seven new players this year —
both freshman and junior college transfers —
and only two starters coming back.
Tonight's contest begins at 7:30 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion, and will be broadcast by
KZSU-FM at 8 p.m. while in progress.
