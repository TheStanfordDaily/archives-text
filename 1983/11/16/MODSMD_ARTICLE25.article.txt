# Big Game: alums relive the past
## 
### TRASK LEONARD 
As Stanford students
prepare to march in the streets
of San Francisco to the sounds
of the Hand the night before
the Big Came against UC-
Berkeley, thousands of alumni
make their way to Palo Alto by
car, rail and air in hope of
reliving their days on the
Farm.
Although "All Right Now"
has replaced "Come )oin the

Band," and the rally in the City
has taken the place of the
bonfire, this one game pro
vides an opportunity for loyal
alums to remember their close
friendships and good times in
college.
For a few alumni, this Satur
day's game with California is
just the tinal part of an entire
season of following Cardinal
football, both home and away.
"We decided to spend our

vacation this year on the road
with Stanford football," said
Dow Ransom (M 8) at last
week's game with Oregon.
"Even though the team hasn't
done well these past few
years, we still come out to see
old friends and just have fun.
But I really get excited for the
Big Game because of the
rivalry and tradition. In fact,
my wife and I have only
missed one Big Game since

1934."
For others not as dedicated
as Ransom, Big Game serves
as a rare occasion to meet up
with old friends and remem
ber yesteryear. Wayland
Leonard ('4O) returns to the
Farm from Los Angeles every
other year to see the game and
partake in the festivities.
"I really look forward to the
Big Game," remarked
Leonard. "Seeing my old
buddies and reliving the
stories which I now tell my
children take me back to my
four fantastic years here. I
wish I could do it more of
ten."
Other alumni remember
their own performances in
games of past years when they
congregate each vear. Tom
McKenna ('56) played junior
varsity football tor his entire
career at Stanford, except for
the Cal game his senior year.
Due to an injury, McKenna
moved up to the starting cen
ter position in the Big Game of
1956.
"Playing in that one game
was such a special thrill for
me. I'll never forget it, and
when I get together with the
team every year at Big Game
time, I return, at least
vicariously, to that magic mo
ment in my life," McKenna
said.
Frank Atkinson ('62), a
player for the Indians in the
early 19605, also renews old
football acquaintances every
November at the game.
"The guys on those teams
were quite a group of individ
uals. Without the Big Game,
lots of them, especially those
from far away, I would never
see at all," explained Atkin
son.

A different kind of excite
ment comes for Lou Test ('42)
at Big Games. Instead of
recalling his own participa
tion, he remembers his own
son's performance in the
memorable 1976 game at
Berkeley.
"In that game (1976) my son,
Eric, held the ball for Mike
Langford's winning field goal
with only seconds left. After
that game, I was the happiest
man in the world. And when I
return to see the Big Game
every year, I can't help but re
member with a proud smile
the excitement that went with
that field goal," said Test.
The principal get together
for alumni Big Gamers is the
tailgater, where everything
from Bloody Marys to soup
and bread is served. The pre
game parties give profes
sionals a chance to act like col
lege students again.
Ransom, with his group of
12 that attends every Cal
game, always leads four cars in
a rendition of "Come Join the
Band" on their horns before
each contest. Wearing car
dinal slacks, a bright red
sweater and a Stanford rain
cap, Ransom also rallies his
friends in old fight songs
before the games. It brings
back memories.
In the late '30s the bonfire
craze was still strong, as
Leonard remembered.
"We used to pile up spare
wood for two weeks before
the game in Lake Lagunita in
preparation for the night
before the game, when we lit
the massive pile and sang
cheers to the sound of the
band. One year, however,
some people from Cal came
and lit the fire one night early.

We retaliated by painting the
concrete 'C' at Berkeley red,"
said Leonard.
The old fight songs and
cheers are also relived at Big
Came gatherings.

Bill Moore ('52)
recalled,"We used to yell,
'Give 'em the axe, the axe, the
axe. Where, where, where?
Right in the neck, the neck,
the neck, THERE!"

Big Game gives Stanford alumni the opportunity to remember the good old days, to relive
the magical moments of the past, to see old college buddies and to indulge in the delicacies
of tailgaters.

Alumni tailgaters, which are often quite elaborate, let alums
fill their stomachs before they feast their eyes on the game.

friendships and good times in
college.
For a few alumni, this Satur
day's game with California is
just the tinal part of an entire
season of following Cardinal
football, both home and away.
"We decided to spend our

vacation this year on the road
with Stanford football," said
Dow Ransom (M 8) at last
week's game with Oregon.
"Even though the team hasn't
done well these past few
years, we still come out to see
old friends and just have fun.
But I really get excited for the
Big Game because of the
rivalry and tradition. In fact,
my wife and I have only
missed one Big Game since

1934."
For others not as dedicated
as Ransom, Big Game serves
as a rare occasion to meet up
with old friends and remem
ber yesteryear. Wayland
Leonard ('4O) returns to the
Farm from Los Angeles every
other year to see the game and
partake in the festivities.
"I really look forward to the
Big Game," remarked
Leonard. "Seeing my old
buddies and reliving the
stories which I now tell my
children take me back to my
four fantastic years here. I
wish I could do it more of
ten."
Other alumni remember
their own performances in
games of past years when they
congregate each vear. Tom
McKenna ('56) played junior
varsity football tor his entire
career at Stanford, except for
the Cal game his senior year.
Due to an injury, McKenna
moved up to the starting cen
ter position in the Big Game of
1956.
"Playing in that one game
was such a special thrill for
me. I'll never forget it, and
when I get together with the
team every year at Big Game
time, I return, at least
vicariously, to that magic mo
ment in my life," McKenna
said.
Frank Atkinson ('62), a
player for the Indians in the
early 19605, also renews old
football acquaintances every
November at the game.
"The guys on those teams
were quite a group of individ
uals. Without the Big Game,
lots of them, especially those
from far away, I would never
see at all," explained Atkin
son.

A different kind of excite
ment comes for Lou Test ('42)
at Big Games. Instead of
recalling his own participa
tion, he remembers his own
son's performance in the
memorable 1976 game at
Berkeley.
"In that game (1976) my son,
Eric, held the ball for Mike
Langford's winning field goal
with only seconds left. After
that game, I was the happiest
man in the world. And when I
return to see the Big Game
every year, I can't help but re
member with a proud smile
the excitement that went with
that field goal," said Test.
The principal get together
for alumni Big Gamers is the
tailgater, where everything
from Bloody Marys to soup
and bread is served. The pre
game parties give profes
sionals a chance to act like col
lege students again.
Ransom, with his group of
12 that attends every Cal
game, always leads four cars in
a rendition of "Come Join the
Band" on their horns before
each contest. Wearing car
dinal slacks, a bright red
sweater and a Stanford rain
cap, Ransom also rallies his
friends in old fight songs
before the games. It brings
back memories.
In the late '30s the bonfire
craze was still strong, as
Leonard remembered.
"We used to pile up spare
wood for two weeks before
the game in Lake Lagunita in
preparation for the night
before the game, when we lit
the massive pile and sang
cheers to the sound of the
band. One year, however,
some people from Cal came
and lit the fire one night early.

We retaliated by painting the
concrete 'C' at Berkeley red,"
said Leonard.
The old fight songs and
cheers are also relived at Big
Came gatherings.

Bill Moore ('52)
recalled,"We used to yell,
'Give 'em the axe, the axe, the
axe. Where, where, where?
Right in the neck, the neck,
the neck, THERE!"

Big Game gives Stanford alumni the opportunity to remember the good old days, to relive
the magical moments of the past, to see old college buddies and to indulge in the delicacies
of tailgaters.

Alumni tailgaters, which are often quite elaborate, let alums
fill their stomachs before they feast their eyes on the game.
As Stanford students
prepare to march in the streets
of San Francisco to the sounds
of the Hand the night before
the Big Came against UC-
Berkeley, thousands of alumni
make their way to Palo Alto by
car, rail and air in hope of
reliving their days on the
Farm.
Although "All Right Now"
has replaced "Come )oin the

Band," and the rally in the City
has taken the place of the
bonfire, this one game pro
vides an opportunity for loyal
alums to remember their close
friendships and good times in
college.
