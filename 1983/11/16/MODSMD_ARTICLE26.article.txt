Check, check, check
We need yours. For the Friends of The Daily banquet
and happy hour this Saturday after we trounce the Daily
Cal in the Ink Bowl. (And to help Adam balance the pet
ty cash box, to pay for biz side pizzas, to give Kristen
nickels for Diet Cokes). But seriously, we need those
checks. We won't give you our checks until you give us
yours (new staffers should take this to heart). The
checks should be made out to The Stanford Daily, and
for the amount of $10.
EARLY!
We're early guys, and it's really neat! The early bird
will get The Daily. Ves, the people that actually show up

for breakfast will not be forced to read The Comical.
Ohmigod! Original copy! Anyway, "Whips-and-
Leather" is really psyched about it. As soon as the
paper gets off the table she's going to go have a party
with herself. Good morning all. Happv birthday Mike
G.
