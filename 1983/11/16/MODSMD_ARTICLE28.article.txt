# Graduating seniors give Stanford high marks
## Survey responses stable; criticism focuses on freshman, sophomore advising 
### 
The Senior Survey is an annual effort by the Office of the
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education to ascertain the
retrospective views of seniors concerning various aspects of
their undergraduate experience.
The survey has four parts. The first part pertains to assess
ments by seniors of the undergraduate program, their gener
al experiences with the faculty and administration, and their
competence in broad areas. The results of this portion of the
survey constitute the subject matter of the present report.
The second part of the survey, prepared and compiled at
the Academic Information Center, reviews students' profes
sional school plans. This is intended to provide undergradu
ates and their advisors with information about the success of
Stanford students in gaining admission to particular prog
rams. The results are available for reference at the Academic
Information Center.
The third part of the survey elicits students' views con
cerning particularly outstanding or poor departmental and
faculty performances. These results are not made public but
are conveyed confidentially to department chairs and senior
academic officers of the University. Department chairs are
encouraged to share this information with their faculty at
their own discretion but not to incorporate it in departmen
tal faculty folders or otherwise keep it on file.
The fourth part of the survey consists of essays by the
respondents on what constitutes an educated person and
how they assess themselves in this regard.
The 1983 survey questionnaire was answered by 671 gra
duating students, some 40% of the graduating class. The
usual procedure was followed: seniors received question
naires by mail during spring quarter and thoy voluntarily
returned the questionnaires anonymously. The return rate
was about the same this year as in previous years.

Background of respondents
In comparing the senior survey population with the gra
duating class as a whole, once again we find that the respon
dents quite faithfully match the larger population in most
background characteristics. About 44% of the 1982-83
graduates were women, as against 46% of the survey popula
tion. Similarly, 14% of the class were transfer students,
while 13% of the survey population were transfer students.
The distribution of students across the major departments
of the university was also similar within the two groups.
These figures give us confidence that the survey results
provide a meaningful picture of the views of the entire
graduating class. Our confidence in the representativeness
of the sample is further bolstered by the results we obtained
from a special subpopulation randomly selected for the
1980-81 survey. About 90% of this identified random sam
ple of students returned the survey, and their responses to
the questionnaire items were very similar to those of stu
dents who returned the questionnaire anonymously that
year. Hence, though we do not have a true random sample of
respondents, we have strong evidence that the views of the
survey respondents closely approximate those of all gra
duating seniors.
As shown in the two data summary tables, the results are
subsumed under three broad categories: Table 1, Part A
deals with general aspects of the undergraduate program;
Part B deals with student interaction with faculty and staff.
The items and scales used in this part of the survey were
identical this year to those of the past three years, so we can
look at the stability of results over time and begin monitoring
trends in student evaluations, Table 2 presents self-ratings
by students of their abilities in a wide variety of areas that

cover the entire scope of our general education program.
Items 3 through 11 in this list query the specific areas which
encompass the distribution requirements instituted in 1980,
including the Western Culture requirement. These items
were also identical this year to the set of items used the past
three years. They therefore provide us with a basis for study
ing the effects of the distribution requirements over time.
The assessments of the undergraduate program and per
sonnel were made from three perspectives: absolute evalua
tions of items, evaluations relative to students' expectations
concerning the items, and evaluations of the expectations of
the items to each student.
The assessments of student abilities likewise included
three perspectives: absolute evaluations, evaluations of the
"degree of improvement" since the student entered Stan
ford, and the importance of the ability to the student.
The summary results given here present, first, some high
lights of student evaluations of the undergraduate program
and its faculty and staff; second, the results with respect to
students' assessments of their abilities: third, some analyses
of differences between men and women and among students
of different schools in the university; fourth, the results of
analyses comparing transfer students' responses to those of
non-transfer students; fifth, comparisons of results for 1979-
80 through 1982-83, to determine if there are any systematic
trends in students' responses; and sixth, a brief section on
students' plans for the year immediately following gradua
tion. To save space we have omitted the data tables on sex
differences and transfer student responses, but they are
available for those who are interested in this information.
