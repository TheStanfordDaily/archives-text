# Graduating seniors give Stanford high marks
## Survey responses stable; criticism focuses on freshman, sophomore advising 
### 
The Senior Survey is an annual effort by the Office of the
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education to ascertain the
retrospective views of seniors concerning various aspects of
their undergraduate experience.
The survey has four parts. The first part pertains to assess
ments by seniors of the undergraduate program, their gener
al experiences with the faculty and administration, and their
competence in broad areas. The results of this portion of the
survey constitute the subject matter of the present report.
The second part of the survey, prepared and compiled at
the Academic Information Center, reviews students' profes
sional school plans. This is intended to provide undergradu
ates and their advisors with information about the success of
Stanford students in gaining admission to particular prog
rams. The results are available for reference at the Academic
Information Center.
The third part of the survey elicits students' views con
cerning particularly outstanding or poor departmental and
faculty performances. These results are not made public but
are conveyed confidentially to department chairs and senior
academic officers of the University. Department chairs are
encouraged to share this information with their faculty at
their own discretion but not to incorporate it in departmen
tal faculty folders or otherwise keep it on file.
The fourth part of the survey consists of essays by the
respondents on what constitutes an educated person and
how they assess themselves in this regard.
The 1983 survey questionnaire was answered by 671 gra
duating students, some 40% of the graduating class. The
usual procedure was followed: seniors received question
naires by mail during spring quarter and thoy voluntarily
returned the questionnaires anonymously. The return rate
was about the same this year as in previous years.

Background of respondents
In comparing the senior survey population with the gra
duating class as a whole, once again we find that the respon
dents quite faithfully match the larger population in most
background characteristics. About 44% of the 1982-83
graduates were women, as against 46% of the survey popula
tion. Similarly, 14% of the class were transfer students,
while 13% of the survey population were transfer students.
The distribution of students across the major departments
of the university was also similar within the two groups.
These figures give us confidence that the survey results
provide a meaningful picture of the views of the entire
graduating class. Our confidence in the representativeness
of the sample is further bolstered by the results we obtained
from a special subpopulation randomly selected for the
1980-81 survey. About 90% of this identified random sam
ple of students returned the survey, and their responses to
the questionnaire items were very similar to those of stu
dents who returned the questionnaire anonymously that
year. Hence, though we do not have a true random sample of
respondents, we have strong evidence that the views of the
survey respondents closely approximate those of all gra
duating seniors.
As shown in the two data summary tables, the results are
subsumed under three broad categories: Table 1, Part A
deals with general aspects of the undergraduate program;
Part B deals with student interaction with faculty and staff.
The items and scales used in this part of the survey were
identical this year to those of the past three years, so we can
look at the stability of results over time and begin monitoring
trends in student evaluations, Table 2 presents self-ratings
by students of their abilities in a wide variety of areas that

cover the entire scope of our general education program.
Items 3 through 11 in this list query the specific areas which
encompass the distribution requirements instituted in 1980,
including the Western Culture requirement. These items
were also identical this year to the set of items used the past
three years. They therefore provide us with a basis for study
ing the effects of the distribution requirements over time.
The assessments of the undergraduate program and per
sonnel were made from three perspectives: absolute evalua
tions of items, evaluations relative to students' expectations
concerning the items, and evaluations of the expectations of
the items to each student.
The assessments of student abilities likewise included
three perspectives: absolute evaluations, evaluations of the
"degree of improvement" since the student entered Stan
ford, and the importance of the ability to the student.
The summary results given here present, first, some high
lights of student evaluations of the undergraduate program
and its faculty and staff; second, the results with respect to
students' assessments of their abilities: third, some analyses
of differences between men and women and among students
of different schools in the university; fourth, the results of
analyses comparing transfer students' responses to those of
non-transfer students; fifth, comparisons of results for 1979-
80 through 1982-83, to determine if there are any systematic
trends in students' responses; and sixth, a brief section on
students' plans for the year immediately following gradua
tion. To save space we have omitted the data tables on sex
differences and transfer student responses, but they are
available for those who are interested in this information.

SENIOR SURVEY—CLASS OF 1982-83
Office of the Vice-Provost
for Undergraduate Education
Overall quality rated high
The overall quality of undergraduate education is rated as
'good' or 'excellent' by 95% of the respondents. This rating
of the general Stanford experience is considerably higher
than the ratings for more specific aspects of undergraduate
education, such as courses within the major (rated 'good' or
'excellent' by 78% of respondents) and training for further
education (highly rated by 76% of respondents). The latter
items are in turn more highly rated than both Stanford's
liberal education (68% high ratings) and the coherence of the
program of study (61% high ratings; see Table 1, Part A).
Students thus have a globally positive view of under
graduate education at Stanford but consider some areas,
such as liberal education, less satisfactory than others. On
the whole these items suggest that students are quite posi
tive about the academic aspects of the undergraduate
program.

In addition, students' living environments are seen as
contributing positively to their academic development, both
at the home campus and, even more, at the overseas cam
puses: 57% say that their campus living arrangement contri
buted highly to their intellectual life, and fully 92% of the
students who attended an overseas campus feel that their
experiences there were good or excellent.
Note that the great majority (73%) of students who went
overseas characterize the experience as 'excellent,' the high
est figure for any item in Table 1, and that 76% of the
students feel that the overseas experience was better or
much better than they had expected. These findings consti
tute further evidence that students are generally very posi
tive about their undergraduate education.
Assessment of faculty
The responses are more complex, however, with regard to
assessments of the faculty and staff (Table 1, Part B). Faculty
are clearly viewed as high- quality scholars and researchers,

with 94% of the responses at the high end of the scale for this
item. But faculty teaching is rated less highly (65% 'good' or
excellent responses and 7% 'poor' or 'very poor'), and this
is especially true with respect to students' expectations:
35% of students feel the faculty as teachers are 'worse' or
much worse' than expected.
Teaching assistants are also evaluated much less highly
than the undergraduate program as a whole. This paradox,
where students rate the undergraduate program as of con
siderably higher quality than the instructors who conduct it,
has been found consistently in the survey in recent years.
Assessments of the faculty are ambivalent in other dimen
sions as well. The opportunities tor individual work with
faculty are considered very great, and much better than
expected, by most students. But as advisors the faculty is
disappointing to the students, especially for freshmen and
sophomores before they declare a major. 48% of respondents
say that their first advisors were 'poor' or 'very poor,' and
60% say that these advisors were 'worse' or 'much worse

than they expected.
Opinions are considerably more positive for the major
advisors, with only 27% of students describing them as
'poor' or 'very poor' and 44% saying that they were 'good' or
'excellent' (compared to 29% for their initial advisors). The
differences here are probably related to the different tasks
expected of these two sets of advisors.
Turning briefly to the importance of these aspects of stu
dents' academic experiences, we see generally that items are
considered of at least moderate importance by nearly all
students, and most students consider most items of 'great' or
'very great' importance.
The items concerning the undergraduate program consi
dered of greatest importance are the overall quality of under
graduate education, the quality of courses in the major, and
the overseas campus experiences—all items that are rated
highly by the students on the absolute scale.
With respect to the faculty and staff, the most important
item (96% responding that it is of great' or very great'
importance) is the quality of the faculty as teachers, while
the quality of the faculty as researchers is of far less import
ance.
The quality of teaching assistants is of only average import

ance, so that the lack of student enthusiasm for teaching
assistant capacities is of less importance than student dis
appointment with faculty teaching abilities.
Finally, all of the items concerning the faculty and staff,
with the exception of faculty teaching quality, are consi
dered of much less importance than the items concerning
the undergraduate program as a whole.
To sum up, we can say that the undergraduate program as
a whole is perceived more positively, and as having greater
significance, than the quality of the instructors and advisors
who conduct it. The students seem to be saying, "I got a very
good education at Stanford, and it means a lot to me. Not all
of the professors are outstanding teachers or good advisors,
but these shortcomings have not affected my educational
experience that much."
Students view their skills
Graduating seniors have moderate to high opinions of
their skills and abilities over the whole range of areas named
on the questionnaire. Only five items receive responses of
'poor* or 'very poor' from more than 20% of the respondents;
similarity, for most items, only 15% to 20% of respondents
are sufficiently bold to characterize their skills as 'excellent'.

The most striking assessment concerns the ability to
"write clear English prose," where a total of 84% say they
have 'good' or 'excellent' skills.
A strong majority of students give high ratings ('good' or
'excellent') for their ability to "understand social processes
and institutions" (63%), and most students (56%) feel they
have strong ability in literature and fine arts, mathematical
sciences, and natural sciences.
Students also have very positive opinions of their more
general abilities to "absorb and analyze information" (fully
91% rating themselves highly here) and "use your creative
faculties" (76% giving 'good' or 'excellent' responses). The
ratings on these two items are higher than for nearly all
others.
Further, it is generally the case that the areas in which
students assess their abilities most positively are also those
considered of greatest importance, with the ability to write
well again topping the list.
The converse is also true: those areas deemed of least
importance are those for which the respondents assess their
abilities as weakest.
Thus, only 39% of the students feel that they have 'good'
or 'excellent' understanding of a non-Western culture, and
only 46% feel this item to be of great importance. The corres-
ponding figures for the ability to understand the develop
ment of Western culture are 42% and 51% respectively.
Another area considered less important is understanding
mathematical sciences (41% at the high end of the scale),
though for this item the absolute assessment was relatively
high.
The items relating to Western and non-Western culture as
general subjects of study reflect the lower ratings mentioned
earlier for the adequacy of the liberal education program at
Stanford—students feel less competent with respect to areas
of study that focus on the world outside the U.S., and they
think that these areas are of less importance than other areas.
Improved abilities
Most of the responses concerning the degree of improve
ment of student abilities at Stanford center around the mod
erate' and 'great' responses, with a rather balanced distribu
tion across the other response categories.
There is a fairly close correspondence between the abso
lute evaluations of abilities and the degree of improvement
at Stanford. Thus, for example, three of the ability items
receiving the most positive absolute ratings - understanding
the natural sciences, understanding social processes and
institutions, and understanding human development—also
rank high in the assessments of degree of improvement.
One exception here is the ability to make use of compu
ters. While only 50% of respondents say they have 'good' or
'excellent' computer skills, 63% feel they have improved
'greatly' or 'very greatly' at Stanford.
Two exceptions of a different kind are the abilities to write
English and use one's creative faculties, for both of which
students feel that their ability is far greater than the degree to
which it has improved at Stanford.
Items for which the degree of improvement is least in
clude the abilities to use a foreign language (40% 'slight' or
'very slight' improvement); understand mathematical scien
ces (37%) and the workings of government (38%); and
understand a non-Western culture (34%) and the develop
ment of Western culture (38%).
These findings provide further evidence of the necessity
of the recent revisions of the distribution requirements and
the institution of the Western Culture requirement. The
finding that students have relatively weak language ability
also reinforces the importance of the new foreign language
requirement, which went into effect in the 1982-83
academic year.
The results for these items in future senior surveys will
constitute a baseline for assessing the progress made by
students covered by the revised requirements.
Differences by field of study
Among the analyses of the responses from various subsets
of the respondent population, two dimensions of special
interest are those of the area of study (grouped by 'schools')
and sex. In the first case, the responses allow us to assess the
various schools as they are perceived by those majoring in
departments within them; in the second case we learn more
about the students themselves through comparisons of the
responses made by women with those made by men. To
simplify the discussion, in this section we will use mean
ratings rather than the percentage distributions across the
ratings scales. The mean can range from 1.0 (very poor) to 5.0
(excellent).
A. Differences among schools (Table 3, Parts A and B)
We have grouped the majors into five 'schools:' engineer
ing, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and inter
departmental programs. The earth science students are
grouped with engineering because they are so few in num
ber. Data for the mean ratings by school are given in Table 3.
Students majoring in humanities departments and inter
departmental programs give the highest overall evaluations
for various aspects of their coursework and major depart
ments (Table 3, Part A). Nearly all of these students rate the
courses in their majors highly (means of 4.16 and 4.19,
respectively) and most rate the faculty highly as teachers
(means of 3.78 and 3.76).
Social science majors give the lowest overall ratings, with
their major courses receiving a mean rating of 3.72 while the
faculty as teachers are rated at 3.72 and major advisors at
3.11.
Engineering majors rate their department courses very
highly but give relatively low ratings for their major advisors
(3.12) and the faculty as teachers (3.53).
Natural science majors also give mixed evaluations, rating
the overall quality of their education and courses in their
major very highly but giving rather low evaluations of their
major advisors and faculty teaching.
The most positive evaluations of teaching assistants come
from natural science and engineering majors (means of 3.84

and 3.51), while the humanities and social science majors
give the lowest responses (3.17 and 3.14, respectively).
By contrast, humanities majors give relatively less posi
tive ratings for the adequacy of their training for graduate or
professional school (mean of 3.70), while natural science
and engineering majors give the highest responses (4.51 and
4.22).
Social science majors also give relatively low responses
on this dimension. The humanities and social science ma
jors feel that they received the most adequate liberal educa
tion (means of 4.17 and 4.09, respectively) while the en
gineering and natural science majors feel much less satisfied
in this area (3.20 and 3.67).
Separating the interdepartmental majors into two groups,
one of a natural science orientation (Human Biology and
Mathematical Sciences) and the other of a humanities and
social science orientation (International Relations, Amer
ican Studies, and other small programs), we find that the
former give responses very similar to those of the natural
science majors while the latter resemble humanities stu
dents most. But the interdepartmental natural science group
is less satisfied than natural science majors with their pro
fessional training and the opportunities for individual work
with faculty, while the interdepartmental humanities/so
cial science group is even more positive about most items

than the humanities majors.
With respect to perceptions of abilities, the results pro
vide few surprises (Table 3, Part B). Engineering and natural
science majors give themselves much higher ratings than
other majors for such abilities as understanding mathema
tical sciences, making use of computers, understanding
technology and applied sciences, and the like; while huma
nities majors rate themselves more highly for such abilities
as understanding literature and fine arts, understanding a
non-Western culture, and so on.
Social science majors rate their ability to understand so
cial processes and institutions, understand the workings of
government, make judgments about international problems,
and understand a non-Western culture more highly than do
other majors.
B. Differences by sex
There are few significant differences between men and
women with respect to their ratings of the undergraduate
program and the faculty and staff. Men rate the adequacy of
their training for further education higher than do women
while women give more positive evaluations for their major
courses and the adequacy of their liberal education. The
adequacy of training for professional school has the largest
difference in mean rating at 0.23.
Similarly, there are few sex-related differences with re

gard to students' assessments of the quality of the under
graduate program and faculty relative to their expectations.
However, women rate nearly all of these items as being of
greater importance to them than do men. Especially impor
tant to women are the quality of their liberal education and
their major advisors.
With respect to abilities developed in the undergraduate
career, sex differences generally seem to follow traditional
stereotypes: men rate their abilities more highly than
women in the mathematical and natural sciences; tech
nology; computers; government and international problems;
and philosophical thought. Mean ratings for men are higher
than those for women by up to 0.61. Women rate themselves
more highly, but by generally smaller margins, in the areas of
foreign languages, literature and fine arts, and human de
velopment.
These sex-based differences are to some extent a reflection
of the uneven distribution of men and women among the
various majors.
For instance, natural science and engineering majors rate
their mathematics ability higher than do humanities majors.
Since men are overrepresented in the natural sciences and
engineering, we should expect to find a difference in
mathematics ability favoring men.
However, even when we control for area of study sex

differences often persist. For example, while women in the
social sciences rate themselves much more highly than do
women in engineering in the "male" domain of understand
ing government, they nevertheless rate themselves less high
ly in this dimension than do men in the social sciences.
This pattern holds up most clearly for the areas of compu
ters, technology, government, and international problems
(men higher); and literature and the fine arts (women
higher).
One important exception is that sex differences for most of
the math and science areas are negligible or quite small for
both engineering and natural science majors. Women in
these schools rate themselves about on a par with their male
counterparts, and large sex differences are found mainly
among students in other areas.
For both sexes, ratings of the degree of improvement of
their abilities generally correspond to the ratings of abilities:
where men rate their abilities more highly than do women,
they also rate their degree of improvement higher; and like
wise for women. Also, the importance of the abilities gener
ally corresponds to the differences in assessments of the
abilities: men attach more importance to the abilities in
which they excel, and women attach more importance to the
abilities in which they excel. All of the differences in this
regard are relatively small.

Transfer student views
As a special subsidiary analysis this year we have com
pared the responses of students who transferred to Stanford
after spending at least one year at another school with the
responses of students who began at Stanford as freshmen.
There were 87 transfer students in the respondent sample,
13% of the total. Only 33% of the transfer students were
women, compared to 47% of non-transfers, and, as a related
finding, there are important differences in the majors chosen
by the two groups.
Transfer students more often majored in the social scien
ces and International Relations (36.3% of transfers com
pared to 27.3% of non-transfers) while non-transfers more
often majored in the natural sciences and Human Biology
(26.5% compared to 16.5%).
In other academic areas the differences between the two
groups were negligible. Because gender and major school
have effects on responses to many items on the question
naire, as we have seen above, these differences can be ex
pected to affect comparisons between the two groups and
must be taken into account in our discussion.
Somewhat to our surprise, with regard to the undergradu
ate program and faculty and staff we find almost no signifi-
cant differences between transfers and non-transfers in any
of the three scales used on the questionnaire.
The only difference of note is a more positive evaluation of
teaching assistants by transfer students (mean ratings of 3.57
and 3.34), with transfers also considering teaching assistant
quality better relative to their expectations and of greater
importance.
This result is unexpected because in this dimension social
science majors generally give lower evaluations than natural
science majors and men give lower evaluations than women.
Overall, however, transfers feel neither more nor less satis
fied with the undergraduate program than non-transfers.
Similarly, we find very few ability assessment differences
between the two groups. The only large difference here is a
stronger rating by transfers for their ability to understand
government (mean of 3.70 compared to a non- transfer mean
of 3.44). This difference is clearly related to the fact that
transfers are especially likely to major in International Rela
tions and Political Science, along with other social science
departments.
In sum, the views of transfer students graduating from
Stanford concerning their experience here and the abilities
they take away with them are extremely similarly to those of
students whose entire undergraduate careers are spent at
Stanford
While we have some evidence from our longitudinal
study of the Class of 1981 that transfer students come to
Stanford with unreasonably high expectations, it appears
that by graduation transfers have adjusted their expectations

and assessments to conform quite closely to those of their
classmates. On the whole the transfer students do not seem
to have any special complaints or compliments different
from those of other students.
Trends assessed
For four consecutive years, the structure of the question
naire used in the Senior Survey has not changed significant
ly. This means that we can begin to assess trends in student
evaluations of Stanford. In this section we report a compari
son of results for the past four years to show the kind of
monitoring that is now possible.
In Table 4 we present the responses on the absolute scale
for the questionnaire items for the four years. The striking
finding here is the great stability of student evaluations of
the undergraduate program, the faculty and staff, and their
own abilities. Most of the differences within individual
response categories are no more than three to five percentage
points, or about the normal margin of error expected in
sample survey results of this type.
For parts A and B of the survey questionnaire, which deal
with evaluations of the undergraduate program and of the
faculty and staff, we find a rather striking upward trend in
the quality of teaching assistants and more modest improve
ment in the overall quality of education, courses in the
major, adequacy of training, major advisors, and faculty
teaching (Table 4, Part A). Given that there are no downward
trends, these are welcome results.
It is also reassuring to see that in areas where there was a
decline in the past, as in 1980-81 for the overseas campus

experience and the coherence of the study program, there
has been a rebound to more positive evaluations.
Turning to the ability areas, we again find mostly stable
response patterns for the four years (Table 4, Part B).
In three areas, however, real increases in ability ratings
have occurred. The greatest increase is for the item concern
ing computers, with 50% of respondents saying they have
high ability in 1982-83 and 1981-82 compared to 38% in
1979-80, and only 20% rating themselves as 'poor' or 'very
poor' this year compared to 32% three years ago.
Increases have occurred for technology and foreign lan
guages as well, though these are less monotonic. The in
creases for computers and technology make sense in light of
the increasing proportion of students in engineering and the
proliferation of computers on campus in recent years. The
improvement in foreign languages is less easily explained; it
cannot be due to the new foreign language requirement
because it applies only to students now entering the uni
versity.
One declining trend since 1980-81 is apparent: 61% of
students in that year rated their ability to make judgments
about international problems 'good' or 'excellent', but this
figure is down to 53% this year. If this is a reliable finding, it
is counter to the high percentage of students majoring in
International Relations and Political Science in these years
and may be due to a declining interest in international affairs
on the part of other students.
Stability generally characterizes the responses for the
other scales used in the questionnaire (assessments relative
to expectations, importance of the items, degree of improve-
ment of abilities). Exceptions are so few in number as to be
expected on the basis of chance alone, and we therefore will
not discuss these results in detail.
The overall results for the four years discussed here pro
vide us with a further vote of confidence in the survey
instrument, as it appears to yield a quite reliable range of
responses for nearly all items. This finding reinforces our
decision to use the survey instrument in its present form for
at least several more years, so that a good longitudinal series
of responses will be available for monitoring students' eva
luations of Stanford and themselves.
Post-graduation plans
Just over half (53%) of the 1982-83 respondents said they
planned to work full-time immediately after graduation.
Considerably fewer (34%) planned to study full-time, and
the remainder planned to travel, work and study, or pursue
other activities.
The proportion planning to work full-time was slightly
higher than last year (49%). Women were more likely to
work full- time after graduation than were men (55% to
51%), with a correspondingly larger proportion of men plan
ning to study full-time.
Further, there were considerable differences among stu

dents in the various schools. The proportion planning full
time work ranged from a high of 69% for engineering majors
to a low of 26% for natural science majors, with the social
science and humanities majors in between (64% and 52%,
respectively).
Nearly two-thirds of the natural science majors planned to
study full-time, more than twice as large a figure as for the
next highest school (humanities majors, 31%). This finding
reflects the fact that many of the natural science majors
attend medical school and do not delay their entry, unlike
students entering many other fields of graduate study.
Longitudinal results concerning students' immediate
plans show that the proportion working full-time has stabil
ized. The percentage of students planning to work full-time
immediately after graduation stood at 28% in 1975 and
increased steadily thereafter to a high of 55% in 1979, de
clining to 49% by 1982 and rising slightly again this year.
We should note that students maintain high long-term
educational aspirations: fully 90% of all 1983 graduating
seniors say that they eventually plan to attend graduate or
professional school (or are already in a co-terminal master's
program), a figure quite comparable to those of previous
years.
When asked for three factors that affected their plans for
the coming year, the students most frequently mention, on
the one hand, money or financial considerations, but also
intellectual interest and the desire to learn (each factor given

by about 31% of students).
The next three most often named factors are the desire to
escape academics (21%), job oportunities (21%), and perso
nality characteristics (19%). Particular individuals (parents,
faculty, friends, etc.) are not among the most important
factors mentioned. These results are very similar to those
from previous years.
Overall assessment: A summary
The overall assessment of Stanford undergraduate educa
tion given by graduating seniors in 1983 is once again quite
positive. Students rate both the undergraduate program and
the faculty and staff highly, though there is less satisfaction
with the faculty as teachers and genuine dissatisfaction with
general advisors. Most aspects of undergraduate education
are considered better than or equal to students' expectations,
and students attach considerable importance to all of the
aspects of their undergraduate training that are covered by
the survey.
Students also rate their abilities quite highly, with half or
more of all students saying that they have good or excellent
ability for nearly all of the items mentioned. The major
weaknesses here have to do with students' understanding of
Western and non-Western culture, foreign languages, tech
nology and computers, and government.
Students also see their abilities as having improved a great
deal in nearly all areas queried and they view these areas as
being of moderate or great importance to them, with the
greatest importance being attached to those areas in which
they perceive their abilities most positively
There are important differences among schools, with
humanities and interdepartmental students expressing the
most satisfaction with their major programs and depart
ments and social science majors expressing the least. Huma
nities majors also feel they got the best liberal education,
while engineers are least satisfied in this regard.
On the other hand, natural science majors feel very well
trained for further study, as do engineering majors, while
humanities and social science majors feel much less ade
quately trained. Assessments of abilities tend to follow the

expected lines based on major area of study, with the en
gineering and natural science majors strong in quantitative
and technical areas; the social science majors strong in
dimensions directly related to their disciplines; and huma
nities majors strongest in humanistic dimensions.
There are few sex-based differences with repect to evalua
tion of the undergraduate program and of the faculty and
staff. The main differences here concern the importance
attached to items, with women considering most items of
greater importance.
Differences in abilities conform generally to traditional
sex-related images in American culture and often hold up
when area of study is controlled. Evaluations of improve
ment in ability and of the importance of the various abilities
generally correspond to the evaluations of ability: men claim
to have improved most in areas in which they have done
well, and they consider these areas to be of greater import
ance. The same is true for women.

Transfer students express evaluations very similar to
those of non- transfer students in almost all dimensions,
with the only significant differences being transfer students'
more positive assessments of teaching assistants and their
ability to understand government. These findings indicate
that transfer students generally adapt well at Stanford and
share much the same experiences as freshman entrants de
spite their shorter time at the university.
This year's results bolster further our confidence in the
survey instrument and our procedure of administering it.
Comparing the 1979-80 through 1982-83 surveys, for which
most of the survey items have been completely identical, we
find very great stability in the results and thus feel reassured
about the reliability of the questionnaire. These findings
reinforce our decision not to alter the questionnaire in com
ing years so that longitudinal data can be gathered to moni
tor student evaluations meaningfully.
