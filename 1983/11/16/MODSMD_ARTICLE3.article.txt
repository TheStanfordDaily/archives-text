# Speakers condemn Grenada action

The spirit of the Reagan adminis
tration's intervention in Grenada
constitutes "nihilism" leading
"directly into the wasteland," accor
ding a UC-Santa Clara professor.
A capacity crowd gathered at Bis
hop auditorium Monday night to
hear Prof. Bryan Murphy of the UC-
Santa Clara Political Science Depart
ment and three University profes
sors discuss U.S. conduct in

Grenada.
Murphy was joined in the sympo
sium by Economics Prof. Donald
Harris, Law School Prof. Thomas
Heller and Political Science Prof.
Robert Packenham.
Murphy, who has lived and
worked in the Caribbean, finished
his speech to a burst of cheers when
he emphatically compared Reagan
to Nietzsche. The components of
Reagan's policy in the Caribbean
comprise a replacement of politics
with power and the simplification of
an historically complex region, he
said.
He added that the invasion
allowed the administration to
believe that "we are powerful
beyond denial." According to
Murphy, it was a highly symbolic
policy aimed at the Soviet Union
and less at the other actors in the
region, like Venezuela or Mexico.
In the pursuit of power, Reagan
embraces a highly abstract anti-
Communism that collapses impor
tant distinctions among Socialist
states, Murphy said.
"We are faced with the abstract
purity that all contradictions can be
obliterated through the power of
techniques or the techniques of
power," he said.
According to Murphy, Reagan
also utilized a series of lies to exploit
the situation. Most accounts of the

invasion, including the fact that the
Cubans were fully equipped with
arms and the administration's deci
sion to exclude the press because of
the covert nature of the operation,
were outright lies, he said.
"You can make clear what is not
clear through the lie," Murphy said.
He concluded that, if anything,
the Reagan administration has
learned how to generate favorable
public opinion when it attempts to
apply an abstract policy of anti-
Communism to a real situation.
Packenham, a specialist in
theories of political development,
while stating that arguments
existed on both sides, basically
favored the invasion because it up
held the principle of self
determination.
Packenham worked on the as
sumption that the invasion was
taken against the Hudson Austin
regime. He said that the Austin
regime had possessed no support,
citing a recent poll that reported
more than 90 percent felt
"liberated" after the removal of the
regime.

A member of the audience spoke
out, saying that any protestors were
under detention, but Packenham
dimissed the contention.
"It appears that self
determination for the Grenadians is
that they're delighted to be relieved
of the Hudson Austin regime," he
said.
Packenham said that the United
States may have violated interna
tional law by invading Grenada, but
the reaction of the natives paled the
United States' infringement. He also
said that other nations do not abide
by the principle of allowing social
change to progress independently,
and for the United States to do so
unilaterally would be "isolationist
and naive."
Heller, who lived in the Caribbean
and Latin America for three years,
elaborated on the notion that the in
vasion of Grenada represented a
kind of symbolic politics. He said
that the invasion signaled that
struggles of inter-American politics
"would continue to be assimilated
in the East-West struggle."
Heller emphasized that the U.S.

invasion did not occur as a response
to the coup by the Hudson Austin
regime. As a strategy of symbolic
politics, it had been planned for
weeks before the coup.
"The fall of Bishop was con
venient, but not related to the actual
context in which the invasion took
nlace." he asserted.
