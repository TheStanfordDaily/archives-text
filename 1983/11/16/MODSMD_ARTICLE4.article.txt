Turkish Cypriots declare independence
Athens, Greece — The Greek government appealed to the world
community yesterday not to recognize the independent state
declared in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus by Turkish Cypriot
leader kauf Denktash, and called for immediate international con
demnation of the move.
"The Greek government and the Greek people will not remain in
different, and will not accept this action," said Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou in a televised statement as he launched a diplomatic drive
aimed at isolating the newly declared state and its backers in Turkey.
Calling the Turkish Cypriot move and Ankara's recognition of the
action a "flagrant violation" of U.N. resolutions, he added that "it
creates an intolerable and dangerous situation for the maintenance of
peace in this sensitive region of the southeastern Mediterranean."
In Ankara, a strong protest was delivered to the lurkish government
by the Greek ambassador.
Guerrilla base attacked
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli air force planes attacked a
pro-Iranian guerrilla base in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley
near the Syrian border today, the Israeli military
command said.
In Lebanon, the state radio said the target of the
attack was the Nabi Sheet area, site of a
headquarters for pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem ex
tremists suspected of bombing U.S. and French mili
tary positions in Beirut last month.
The camp, located tour miles east of the Lebanese
town of Rayak, served as a training camp and a
launching pad for anti-Israeli attacks, the Israeli
command said.
The command's communique also said all Israeli
planes returned safely to their base and the pilots re
ported direct hits on their targets.
Israeli military sources said the guerrilla base con
tained anti-aircraft guns, vehicles, buildings and
tents.
Second missile shipment arrives
Greenham Common, Britain — A second shipment
of U.S. cruise missiles is believed to have arrived
here yesterday aboard a U.S. military jet transport,
sparking renewed protests by women
demonstrators and the arrest of at least 126 of them.

The British Defense Ministry declined to comment
on the nature of the equipment flown in but obser
vers here saw what appeared to be missiles being
unloaded from a U.S. Air Force C-SA. A short time
later, a U.S. C-141 landed here and was unloaded of
a cargo that some knowledgeable observers said
could well have been nuclear warheads for the
missiles.
The arrests took place atter the women, sitting
arm-in-arm on a roadway, blocked the gates of this
joint U.S.-Royal Air Force base 50 miles west of Lon
don.
PLO factions continue battling
Beirut, Lebanon — Intense artillery fire rained on
Beirut yesterday and there was fierce fighting just
outside the port city of Tripoli as Syrian-backed Pal
estinian rebels pressed their attack on the forces
loyal to Yasser Arafat.
Reports from Tripoli indicated that the rebel tac
tion of the Palestine Liberation Organization may
have captured part of the Baddawi refugee camp on
the city's northeastern border where PLO leader
Arafat and his men are holding out. However, the
PLO news agency WAFA said that the rebel attack
had been repulsed. The accuracy of the various
reports was impossible to judge.
The shelling in Beirut was the most intense in the
capital since a cease-fire stopped most of the fight
ing in the region seven weeks ago.
House fails to pass ERA
Washington — A resolution that would have rein
carnated the equal rights amendment fell just six

votes short of House passage yesterday as both
Democrats and Republicans accused the other party
of trying to turn the issue to their political advan
tage.
Some of the amendment's leading supporters
were on the "no" side of the 278-147 vote, in protest
against House Speaker Thomas "Tip'' O'Neill's insis
tence that the issue be voted on with no amend
ments and only 40 minutes of debate. A total of 284
"yes" votes were needed to meet the requirement
of passage by a two-thirds majority of those voting.
O'Neill (D-Mass.) said that the limitations he
imposed were necessary to prevent the amend
ment's opponents from peppering it with language
relating to abortion, the draft, women in combat and
other peripheral issues.
Terrorist kills U.S. naval officer
Athens, Greece — A gunman on a motorcycle fired
seven bullets into the car of a U.S. naval military at
tache yesterday, killing the officer and his Greek ci
vilian driver.
Police said the killer and his accomplice who was
driving the motorcycle escaped down a sidestreet of
suburban north Athens after the morning rush-hour
attack, which occurred as the car was stopped for a
red light.
Capt. George Tsantes, 53, serving with the Joint
U.S. Military Advisory Group, was hit by at least four
bullets and died at the scene, police said. His driver
died in a hospital.
Glenn blasts Mondale's policies
Washington — Sen. ]ohn Glenn (D- Ohio) yester

day accused his rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, former Vice President Walter Mondale,
of "a fundamental lack of support for an adequate
defense," and Mondale replied that Glenn is "out of
step with the Democratic Party and the country in
offering the Pentagon a "blank check for whatever
it wants.
Glenn ticked off a list of issues on which Mondale
as a senator in the 1970s opposed weapons systems
and military spending that Glenn and a majority of
senators supported. "Today," Glenn told an audi
ence of Democrats who favor strong U.S. defenses,
"Fritz Mondale likes to say he's for a strong defense,
but when his vote was needed, his support was
weak."
