community yesterday not to recognize the independent state
declared in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus by Turkish Cypriot
leader kauf Denktash, and called for immediate international con
demnation of the move.

Papandreou in a televised statement as he launched a diplomatic drive
aimed at isolating the newly declared state and its backers in Turkey.

action a "flagrant violation" of U.N. resolutions, he added that "it
creates an intolerable and dangerous situation for the maintenance of
peace in this sensitive region of the southeastern Mediterranean."
