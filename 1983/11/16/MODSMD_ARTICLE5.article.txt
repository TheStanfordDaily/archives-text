# University gets mixed marks
## Senior survey grades advising, Western Culture poor 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Students in the graduating class of
1983 profess "a globally positive
view of undergraduate education at
Stanford," according to the annual
senior survey, released yesterday by
the Office of the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education.
But while 45 percent of those res
ponding to the survey — or roughly
40 percent of the Class of 1983 —
rated the overall quality of educa
tion as good or excellent, 35 percent
said the faculty's teaching ability
was worse or much worse than they
expected.

senior survey, please see

Grads also expressed "genuine
dissatisfaction" with the University's
advising program, with 48 percent
rating their first advisers as poor or
very poor and 60 percent calling
them worse or much worse than ex
pected.
Questionnaires asked students to
assess their experiences with faculty
and administration in terms of abso
lute evaluation of items, relative ex
pectations concerning these items
and the importance of each item.
The survey is intended to let "the
University know if problem areas
are developing" in undergraduate
education.

John Boli, survey research coord
inator, said "it's very difficult to
make a judgment about
(undergraduate education) based
on abstract standards."
He added that he was particularly
pleased by the response of 50 per
cent of the students who rated their
computer abilities as high. The sur
vey also showed a small increase in
the number of students who charac
terized their abilities in technology
and foreign languages as high.
There was "less satisfaction with
the faculty as teachers" than as re
searchers. Ninety-four percent of
the students evaluated the research
and scholarly qualities of their
teachers as good or high.
In addition, teaching assistants
were rated "much less highly than
the undergraduate program as a
whole."
The report stated that "major
weaknesses" in undergraduate edu
cation include students'
"understanding of Western and
non-Western culture, foreign lan
guages, technology and computers,
and government."
Boli said that students were also
asked to give confidential com
ments about particularly outstand
ing or poor departmental and fac
ulty performances. This data is given
to department chairs and deans of
the respective schools.
The report stated that over the
past four years there has been
"great stability" in survey results.
This year's evaluation showed im
provements in numerous areas with
no significant declines.
