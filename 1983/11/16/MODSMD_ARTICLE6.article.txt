# ASSU moves on diverse programs
## New photo I.D. cards 
### JIM STALLARD 
Student dissatisfaction may
render paper student identifica
tion cards obsolete by next year if
the ASSU adopts a plan to design
a laminated photo 1.D., accor
ding to ASSU Senator Mark Fleis
chauer.
But the proposal to develop
the new laminated I.D. card —
similar to the food service card —
is not without its critics. Head
Registrar Sally Mahoney said she
agrees that the present I.D. s are
"cheap," but argued that
"something cheap is also some
thing very easily replaceable.
"The paper I.D. s do all that is
now required of them. They were
never intended to do the job
done by food service cards."
As with the Food Service card,
the laminated plastic I.D. would
be validated each quarter by the
registrar via a different colored
sticker. Besides being more
durable than the cards now in
use, the new photo I.D.s could
have several campus uses.
The new system "would put
pressure on the libraries to
change their checking system,'
Fleischauer said.

"Instead of filling out separate
slips for each book, the cards
could be quickly scanned by ma
chine and the information put on
record," he added. "They could
also be used for other daily trans
a< tions, like buying tickets at the
Athletic Department or books at
the Stanford Bookstore."
At present the plan is still in a
tenative stage. According to Fleis
chauer, the student affairs com
mittee has assigned it to a sub
committee. "We're giving it a
major priority to be done by the
e id of the year. The University
h is not been enthusiastic due to
cost reasons," he said. "We're
very anxious to get student
response on this. We don't want
to go through a lot of trouble if
no one cares about it."
Mahoney pointed out that a
s\stem like the one suggested for
the libraries would be difficult to
maintain and update.
What if a student withdraws
in the middle of the quarter?"
she asked. "How is he to be
denied access where he doesn't
belong? There are manv different
