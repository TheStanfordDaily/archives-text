### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
An ASSU proposal creating a
"manpower service" to assist de
partments here in need of tem
porary student help could be
operational next quarter, accor
ding to Council of Presidents
chair Peter Spivack.
"This isn't a regular employ
ment, not like a job," Spivack ex
plained. "We're trying to fill a
very different need — the need
for very temporary employment.
This is something that is totally
subject to demand and we're
saying, basically, we'll do our
best to help."
Spivack cautioned that while
planning on the employment
center continues, the ASSU does
not intend to compete with exist
ing University financial aid pro
grams.
"The University has a policy of
giving any temporary student
jobs to people on financial aid,"
Spivack said. "That's a very
reasonable concern, but I don't
think that's what we're trying to
do."
While the center would cater
primarily to clerical work,

Spivack said the ASSU is "looking
at anything," from "just manual
labor, moving files or an office to
carpentry and painting, garden
ing, baby sitting and gardening."

Students affiliated with the
center would receive at least min
imum wage, paid directly to the
student by the specific depart
ment. ASSU would keep a file
containing the names and skills
of individual program member l
in order to match students with
appropriate jobs.
A slight fee, probably $">,
would be levied on each depai l
ment per job to assist in the pa
ment of the center's -.ervi( •
director, assistants and office.
