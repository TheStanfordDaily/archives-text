## Students feel the draft and react with mixed feelings 
### RICK HUMPHRESS 
I en years ago, the vast
majority of students here were
against the draft. Yet while
students here still have strong
personal opinions about the
draft and draft registra
tion — an issue which directly
affects half the students
here — not all continue to
oppose conscription.
Although the students ques
tioned do not want to rush off
to war, especially during an
age in which minor incidents
tan bring on nuclear war,
many do believe in the basic
federal right of conscription
and its use of military force
under certain circumstances.
One aspect of the current
draft registration policy which
has attracted much attention
on campus is the law requiring
recipients of federal financial
aid to show proof of registra
tion. Although the University
provides support for students
here who are unable to
receive federal aid, students
still voice strong opinions on
the subject.
John kenagy, a junior major
ing in electrical engineering,
supports the present draft
registration policy. "It's the
law and everyone should do
it,"he said. "If you're going to
get the benefits of the govern
ment then you should do
everything that a responsible
citizen should — that includes
voting, serving on juries or fol
lowing the government's
registration policy."
"Figuratively, the people
that made the law, I voted in.
I hat's representative de
mocracy," he added.
Other students feel it is
wrong for the government to
demand that a recipient of
federal aid be registered.
"Why do they have to tie it
to something else to make us
do it?" one senior engineering
student asked. He went on to
point out that the punishment
does not seem suitable for the
crime, especially since some
students can only afford col
lege if receiving federal aid.
While the students inter
viewed had varying views on
the draft, almost all believed

the draft could not be imple
mented in the next few years.
Their reasons for this belief,
however, were also varied.
junior Robert Steeneck, a
member of the Navy ROTC
program, believes that the

growing number of people
joining the military voluntarily
will make the draft unneces
sary.
"The conservative move
ment has put a lot of good
people in the military," said

Steeneck. \\ Berkeley
(Stanford ROTC students work
through UC-Berkeley's pro
gram! our membership in the
Navy has gone up from 150 to
200, a healthy increase," he
said.

"There will always be a lot
of good marines ready to go
out and die for their country,"
Steeneck added.
Sophomore Mark Noeldner,
however, sees the situation
differently. Although he does

not believe the draft likely to
happen in the near future, he
believes the volunteer army is
declining.
"The qualitv in there is very
low now. The worthwhile
people are going into college
and not into service," he said.
Another sophomore, Spen
cer Carlson, said that people
are now more likely to accept
a draft but he feels a draft will
not happen in the immediate
future.
"There will not be a draft for
years. There is still too much
opposition remaining from
the memories of Vietnam.
However, Reagan is leading us
into a different track. He em
phasizes military power,"
Carlson said.
Kenagy expressed the
strongest belief that a draft
would not occur.
"I don't think there will be
one because Washington is
smart enough to know that it
would be such a bad move be
cause of the anti-draft senti
ment. The draft would
polarize America and would
galvinize anti-establishment
feelings just like in the 19605,"
Kenagy said.
Although the students
agreed that a draft is unlikely
in the coming years, their
views on other defense
related issues, such as the
possiblity of limited nuclear
war, varied.
"There can be conventional
war," one student said. "But I
don't think anyone will use
nuclear arms . . . There really
is no threat of a nuclear war
but a real threat of conven
tional war."
"Any major power will be
apprehensive to use nuclear
weapons, and they will be
afraid of escalation. But maybe
they could confine their use to
just the war front," another
student said.
Junior Matthew Knox dis
agrees. "There's no such thing
as limited warfare," he said.
He argued that because all
wars are fought without
restraint, each side would use
all its resources to achieve vic
tory, and one side would
eventually resort to nuclear
weapons to avoid defeat.
Therefore, he argued, there
will be no armed conflict be
tween the East and West be
cause any war between them
would mean destruction for

both sides.
While students held differ
ing views on the concept of
limited nuclear war, most
agreed that U.S. intervention
in foreign affairs — such as
the recent invasion of
Grenada — is justified if it ex
pands freedom, human rights

and economic order. Most did
not feel that the Grenada inva
sion took place for these
reasons.
"People should die for
freedom everywhere. We
should spread freedom.
However, Americans are not
dying for freedom. We are

dying for business, money
one student said.
Senior Marc Baker contends
that Reagan made the move
into Grenada for strategic
purposes. "It was basically a
defensive move," he said.
Baker is unsure whether the
move was justified.

A ROAD TOWARD PEACE?: While group protests against the draft are still commonplace
events on college campuses, a growing number of students are rethinking their views on the
subject. The number of students involved in ROTC has increased in recent years, and some
students feel registration is a moral as well as legal responsibility.
