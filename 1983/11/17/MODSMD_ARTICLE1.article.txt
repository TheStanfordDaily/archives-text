# Student groups don't see eye to eye on complex
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
For senior Robert Larkins, the founder of and
prime mover behind a pro-Reagan library student
group, there is no question that a Reagan presiden
tial library complex ought to be established here —
as soon as possible.
Another senior, Luke Cole, sees it differently. For
him and other students working against the pro
posed complex, there is no question that establish
ing the library complex here would further identify
"this University with the right wing of the Republi
can Party."
Larkins' group, which calls itself Students for a
Presidential Complex at Stanford (SPC), can see no
reason why the University shouldn't accept the
entire proposal for a Reagan complex — a library, a
museum and a center for public affairs run by the
Hoover Institution.
The other group, Stanford Community Against

Reagan University (SCAReU), for which Cole is a
spokesman, believes Stanford should not accept any
of the complex at this time because Reagan's re
election campaign is underway, and Hoover's role
within the University is being reassessed by the
Board of Trustees.
Through petition drives, telephone networks, but
ton peddling, threatened lawsuits and word of
mouth, representatives of the two groups are trying
to influence the Board of Trustees, which will have
the final University word on the Reagan complex.
Spending hundreds of their own dollars and in
vesting countless hours on the phone, in White
Plaza and at the typewriter, they hope to convince
Board members to vote their way when the decision
comes before the trustees — most likely on Dec. 13.
What is in question in this battle of young activists
is whether their efforts will make any difference at
all.
In the campus debate over whe
ther to establish a Reagan complex
here, which began last spring and
has been raging since August, stu
dent input — solicited student in
put, to be exact — has been
noticeably lacking.
Neither the Board Committee on

the Hoover Institution, which is
considering the matter for trustees,
nor the University President Donald
Kennedy-appointed advisory com
mittee on the issue, had any student
members.
A resolution by the ASSU Senate
addressing the issue has gone
publicly unacknowledged. And no
University official has yet agreed to
answer questions at an open forum
to students.
By now, even input from faculty
members, which continues to
trickle in through the mail or public
statements, seems to have become
substantially less important since
Kennedy has made his position
clear.
The most important discussion —
some would say the only one that
matters — is the one between the
White House and the Board of Trus
tees; it is a private and confidential
exchange between two sides who
seem unable to reach agreement.
But that hasn't stopped either stu
dent group from trying to wield its
influence.
The SPC, formed less than three
weeks ago by Larkins, considers the
controversial complex a "coveted

academic treasure" that is Stan
ford's "for the asking" and the
Hoover Institution's "to
administer."
The group's petition, currently
being circulated by some 60 mem
bers, according to Larkins, says that
"informed, rational examination
leaves no doubt about the great aca
demic value" of the proposed
presidential library complex.
Charging that opposition to the
complex and its proponent, the
Hoover Institution, is politically
motivated, the SPC petition goes on
to urge, "We must demonstrate to
the Board of Trustees that we will
not allow a vocal minority to deprive
Stanford of this invaluable academic
resource."
It is a none-too-subtle dig not only
at faculty opponents of the complex
but at SCAReU.
SCAReU's members, most of
whom have worked together since
the beginning of the year, have cho
sen to urge the University not to
reject the complex altogether, but
rather to delay a decision until at
least after the 1984 elections. Be
cause the White House has said
repeatedly that it would like to get

the matter resolved as soon as possi
ble, such a delay could certainly
mean the Reagan papers would end
up elsewhere — a prospect Cole
says doesn't bother him.
SCAReU's petition, which is now
being circulated, says the Board of
Trustees should make no decision
on the library complex before
Hoover's relationship to the Univer
sity has been reassessed, before
"Reagan is no longer a political can

didate," before "student concerns
and opinions have been given fair
representation," and before Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and
the trustees "provide explicity
public guarantees that Hoover will
have absolutely no influence over
appointments to the proposed cen
ter."
The composition of the groups is
strikingly similar. In each, the bulk
of work is done bv a small inner core

— of four students for SPC, and of
eight for SCAReU. Most are seniors
or graduate students in law or busi
ness.
Both Larkins and Cole boast mem
berships of about 70 students, but
admit that the most these members
have done is to attend meetings,
make telephone calls or distribute
petitions. Many of them, they say,
are also upperclassmen or graduate
students.
