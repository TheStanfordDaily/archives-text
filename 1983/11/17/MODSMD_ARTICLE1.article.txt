# Student groups don't see eye to eye on complex
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
For senior Robert Larkins, the founder of and
prime mover behind a pro-Reagan library student
group, there is no question that a Reagan presiden
tial library complex ought to be established here —
as soon as possible.
Another senior, Luke Cole, sees it differently. For
him and other students working against the pro
posed complex, there is no question that establish
ing the library complex here would further identify
"this University with the right wing of the Republi
can Party."
Larkins' group, which calls itself Students for a
Presidential Complex at Stanford (SPC), can see no
reason why the University shouldn't accept the
entire proposal for a Reagan complex — a library, a
museum and a center for public affairs run by the
Hoover Institution.
The other group, Stanford Community Against

Reagan University (SCAReU), for which Cole is a
spokesman, believes Stanford should not accept any
of the complex at this time because Reagan's re
election campaign is underway, and Hoover's role
within the University is being reassessed by the
Board of Trustees.
Through petition drives, telephone networks, but
ton peddling, threatened lawsuits and word of
mouth, representatives of the two groups are trying
to influence the Board of Trustees, which will have
the final University word on the Reagan complex.
Spending hundreds of their own dollars and in
vesting countless hours on the phone, in White
Plaza and at the typewriter, they hope to convince
Board members to vote their way when the decision
comes before the trustees — most likely on Dec. 13.
What is in question in this battle of young activists
is whether their efforts will make any difference at
all.
