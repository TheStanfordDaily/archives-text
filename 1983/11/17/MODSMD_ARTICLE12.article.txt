The Axe first appeared at a
Stanford pep rally before an
important Cal-Stanford
baseball game. Two days later,
the Axe showed up at the
game (held in San Francisco),
wielded by Stanford's Billy
Erb. Erb and his friends
flaunted the Axe right in front
of the Cal rooting section as
Stanford led Cal throughout
the game and into the ninth
inning. A four-run inning gave
Cal an upset victory and in the
post-game excitement two
groups of Berkeley students
swept down on the Stanford
Axe-bearers.
After a wild brawl, Cal came
out on top and a Cal student
ran off with Axe in hand. A
several-hours-long chase
through the streets of San
Francisco ensued, but after
the handle was sawed off, the
Axe was smuggled across the
bay in a ferry. When Stanford
seemed insistent on finding
the hiding place of the Axe, it
was placed in a safety deposit
box and appeared only once a
year at the Cal pre-Big Game
rally.
On April 4, 1930, The Daily

plicable lapse in spacio
temporal laws caused the Big
Game results to be dubbed a
"fluke." (Alternate spelling:
"miracle.") In 1894, during the
third Big Game, the only score
occurred when a Cal punt
caromed off the face of Stan
ford guard Charlie Fickert. The
loose ball was dribbled
(Raiders-style) into the end
zone by Guy Cochran, Stan
ford's left tackle, who fell on it
to win the game for Stanford
6-0.
In 1900, Stanford won 5-0 by
kicking the first intercollegiate
field-goal on the West Coast.
Field goals were eventually
lowered to their current three
point worth.
In 1901, Cal scored a single
safety to win 2-0. The safety
was awarded to Cal after Stan
ford punter Harrison Hill
grabbed hold of Lloyd
Womble, captain of the Cal
team, preventing him from
getting to a blocked punt.
After Cal star "Locomotive"
Smith was disqualified from
playing in the 1902 Big Game,
bench warmer Bobby Sher

man entered the game to
return a punt. With a little
help from a tailwind, Stanford
got off an amazing 75-yard
punt. Unfortunately, Sherman
ran the kick back 105 yards for
a touchdown — the longest
play in Big Came history.
1947, 1958, 1972. We don't
talk about these games. Cal
came from behind in the final
minutes to win. Just a fluke or
something.

1974 was the greatest Stan
lord comeback in Big Game
history. Cal scored a touch
down to make the score 20-19
with 19 seconds left to play,
the Weenies were dancing in
the aisles as Stanford ran the
kick out at their own 19. They
were singing victory songs as
Guy Benjamin threw two
quick passes down to the Cal
H. They quickly sobered up as
Mike Langford kicked an
amazing 50-yard field goal for
the 22-20 win.
