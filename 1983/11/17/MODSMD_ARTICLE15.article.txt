## The 						Stanford Daily GPB and course control 
### 
The ASSU approved a new set of rules last
week that relinquishes the Guest Professorship
Bureau's (GPB) control over guest professors'
course content. The new rules, enacted in
response to University Provost Al Hastorf's
warning that the University would not tolerate
another "McCloskey incident," places final
control over guest professors' courses back
where it belongs — in the University academic
departments that approve the courses.
The "McCloskey incident" showed how
messy things can get when anyone has the
power to tell a professor what he can teach.
Things started getting mean last spring when
Guest Prof. Paul "Pete'' McCloskey said that
GPB chairman Seth Linfield was trying to
"torpedo" his class by omitting it from the time
schedule and deleting a book from the reading
list. McCloskey, whose outspoken views on Is
rael in Congress angered many American Jews,
said Linfield was guilty of "reverse anti-
Semitism," noting that Linfield was Jewish.
Linfield countered that he was only trying to
get rid of the former congressman's "rather sil
ly lessons." Linfield's co-director promptly

resigned, the ASSU disassociated itself with
McCloskey's' "anti-Semitic" remarks and half
the students in McCloskey's class disassociated
themselves with the GPB's "anti-McCloskey"
remarks.
Hastorf said he wouldn't put up with these
shenanigans, and he told the ASSU this sum
mer they wouldn't see another guest professor
on campus unless they changed their rules.
The GPB should not have control over guest
professor's course content, Hastorf said.
The issue is one of academic freedom. The
ASSU or the University should be able to offer
advice to inexperienced guest professors who
have difficulty structuring their course, but
they should not be able to dictate course con
tent. If students have serious objections to a
professor's course content or teaching ability,
they should be able to take these grievances to
the proper University departments.
Hopefully, these new arrangements will
avoid future confrontations by clearly defining
the roles of the GPB and the University in host
ing guest professors.
