# Stanford 20, Cal 19

### 
Big Game, Nov. 20, 1982.
Mouths gaped. Heads hung. Eyes bleared.
"Don't worry. There's a flag down. A
penalty. It can't be good."
Boom. The cannon sounds. It's good.
Red-sweatshirted fans stood immobile.
Nobody laughed. Nobody cried. Nobody said
anything. The scoreboard didn't read 20-19
anymore. Instead it glared 25-20.
Cautiously the Band began post-game
rituals. Gradually, they picked up their pace.
Nobody sang, nobody danced.
As the news became clear, Cal fans swarmed
the field. They teased. They taunted. They
laughed at us, pointed at our Band. They would
have bothered us, but we were still dazed. We
filed out of the stadium. The scoreboard still
flashed, drilling that final score — which no
one yet believed — into our heads.
We got in our cars. We fought the traffic. No
one spoke. Click. Someone turned on the
radio. "God is a Golden Bear!" Click. Some
one turned the radio off.
It was a strange way to win. It was a strange
way to lose. It was a strange day.

Big Game, Nov. 19, 1983,
Fans seem to have about as much energy
going into this Saturday's game as they did
filing out of Memorial Stadium last November.
Oskie's "bearial" on Monday was about as
joyous as a funeral. People are mumbling
about blowing off the rally in Lake Lag tonight
(because it might rain) and the rally in San Fran
cisco (because the parade route has been
changed). Even some Band and football team
members have been heard to grumble that
there just isn't any school spirit at this univer
sity.
It's strange that people should react so
negatively to last year's win. Not only are
things strange this year, they're gloomy.
The press is skeptical about the chances of a
team with a 1-9 record. No one seems to grasp
the meaning of the Card "victory" in Memorial
Stadium last year. A repeat of last year's perfor
mance seems unlikely, but — with the Big
Game's history of surprises — it could go
either way.
On Saturday we can put an end to all this
mystery and that sinking feeling which we've
felt in our guts since last year. Yes, we want
revenge. We want the Axe. Let's beat the
Weenies.
