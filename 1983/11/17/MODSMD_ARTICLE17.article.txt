# Paralyzed Congress gets nothing done
## 
### 
When Ronald Reagan was first
elected president, analysts won
dered if he would be able to get his
programs through Congress. He
was aided by the fact that, for the
first time in decades, the Republican
Party had a majority in one house of
Congress, the Senate. When Reagan
passed the Kemp-Roth tax cut, most
observers assumed he would con
tinue to be able to get enough Dem
ocratic defenders to pass anything
the administration wanted. It has
not come to be. In the past three
years, Congress has been paralyzed
to an extent unparalleled in this cen
tury.
Many old-style conservatives
would have been quite pleased
simply to stop Congress from pas
sing exotic new programs. Old-style
conservatives, inspired by Edmund
Burke, were attached to tradition as
embodied in existing programs and
institutions. They were deeply sus
picious of untested new ideas and
changes in the status quo.
Reagan and the new right come to
power untroubled by such Burkean
scruples. They wanted Big Change.
Reagan favors the biggest constitu
tional overhaul since Reconstruc
tion. At last count, he was pushing
amendments, balanced budget,
busing, school prayer and now, line
item budget vetoes. None have
made it to a vote in both houses of
Congress. Reagan cannot even
blame the Democratic House. Only
one of the amendments, on
balanced budgets, made it though
the Republican Senate. Since the
1982 election even this amendment
has not come up again.
The new right also wanted to
abolish, or at least cripple, the new
government's power to regulate
business. Reagan opposed not only
the Democrat-created agencies of
the 19605, and the New Deal, but

also agencies dating to Woodrow
Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt. No
doubt Reagan has stopped most of
the regulators from doing their jobs
while he has been president. But he
has also been able to pass no
regulatory modifications in
Congress; the agencies will pass un
scathed to the next Democratic
president. Jimmy Carter passed
deregulations of trucking, airlines
and some communications; Reagan
cannot boast even that.
The indecisiveness of Congress
since Reagan's election has been
clearest on the issue of the budget.
Candidate Reagan insisted that
budget deficits were the root of all
economic evils. His most repeated
promise was to balance the budget.
Vet the administration has more
than tripled the previous highest an
nual deficits, those of the mid-19705.
Everyone in Congress realizes that
such record deficits are completely
irresponsible, and endanger the
whole world's economic recovery.
Vet almost no one in Washington
has even attempted to come up with
acceptable alternatives.
Congressional action has been
futile even on simple issues. Con
gressmen love popular anti-crime
measures. A non-controversial anti
crime package has sat in Congress
for five years. Every time it has been
brought up, it has failed because no
one can resist adding amendments
which in sum make the bill unaccep
table to a bare majority in each
house.
Everybody in Congress also
realizes that the U.S. has a serious
problem with illegal immigration. A
bipartisan immigration bill has sat in
Congress for three years. A few big
employers of menial laborers and
some Hispanic lobbies object to
small portions of the measure.
Twenty-five years ago the bill would
have been forced through Congress

over the objections of either group.
Ten years ago some compromise
would have been reached or the of
fending sections would have been
deleted. This year the dispute killed
the entire bill.
Since the start of the current ad
ministration, the paralysis of
Congress has on occasion verged on
the comic. The Senate has spent
literally months debating its own
pay, whether it should have a new
gym and whether TV cameras
should be allowed in the Senate
chamber. What is worse, not even
these issues have been resolved.
Given the current shortcomings
of Congress, even if a Democrat
wins the presidency in 1984, he may

be very ineffective, unless the
Democrats also win a clear majority
in both houses of Congress. The
problems occur in both parties.
Politics today places an increasing
emphasis on grabbing headlines,
and little on behind-the-scenes ef
fectiveness. More than ever before,
interest groups are able to send
thousands of letters to politicians on
a few days' notice â€” pressure few in
Congress can resist. The policy
making paralysis of Congress may
well last for years to come.
