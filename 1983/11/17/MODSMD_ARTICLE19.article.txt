# Wiggin cartoon
## 
### 
In seven years of reading The
Daily I have never seen a less tunny
or more tasteless cartoon than the
Nov. 14 cartoon about football
Coach Paul Wiggin, an alumnus and
hardworking staff member "getting
the axe."
At what must be a time of per
sonal and professional anguish for
Wiggin, what social, journalistic or
other purpose is served by dealing
him this low "axe" blow?
