# 'Not to prevent fun, but to prevent trouble'
## SF police will arrest rowdy rally revelers 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
Three hundred uniformed police
and an additional undisclosed num
ber of plainclothes cops will join
and — if need be — arrest Stanford
students during the Big Game rally
in San Francisco Friday night, accor
ding to a rally organizer.
The police will intervene and ar
rest students for climbing lamp
posts, littering or acting excessively
rowdy, according to Max Scheder,
a member of the Fiesta Committee,
a student-run group that plans the
annual rally.
Scheder said the police have also

warned that they will arrest any stu
dent carrying an open container of
alcohol.
"The entire tactical squad of the
police department will be there,"
Scheder said.
However, a spokesperson for the
San Francisco Police Field Office
Bureau said the rally will receive no
special attention. "Only a few
motorcycle officers will be on hand,
to make sure that traffic is con
trolled," the officer said.
Scheder said the police depart
ment's primary duty is to prevent
mishaps, not to restrict students'
fun.

"It we just have a good time with
out being disruptive, nothing
should happen," Scheder said. "We
have monitors this year who will
serve as a liaison between the stu
dents and anyone else, and hopeful
ly will have the chance to calm
things down before the police inter
vene."
At least 100 student monitors will
line the course of the rally to
prevent any disruptive actions, ac
cording to Helene Leckman, a mem
ber of the committee.
"But if the monitors are unable to
handle the situation, the police have
stated that they will not hesitate to
step in themselves and arrests will
result," Leckman said.
The rally will begin at Pier 35 and
proceed along the wharf, ending at
Aquatic Park. Members of the Fiesta
Committee said police will monitor
student behavior throughout the
march. .
"The city is responsible for what
happens because they have granted

us a parade permit, so the police are
going to be watching students care
fully to make sure nothing gets out
of hand," Leckman said.
A fireworks rally on campus
tonight will set the stage for the Rig
Came rally in San Francisco. Imme
diately after the Gaieties perfor
mance in Memorial Auditorium, an
all-campus rally featuring the band
will begin at Governor's Corner and
proceed through student residences
before concluding in the parking lot
behind Encina Gym. Fireworks,
speeches, cheers and band music
will highlight the evening rally.
