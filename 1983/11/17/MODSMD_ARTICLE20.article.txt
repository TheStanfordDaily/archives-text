# Appreciate history
## 
### 
I am writing in reference to the
editorial "Bound by history" (Daily,
Nov. 11). Your support of the plan
ners' renovation is in my opinion
completely nearsighted.
What you fail to perceive is the
delicacy of design. Enlarging the
circles to almost twice their original
diameter is a radical revision.
The Quad is the only design on
the West Coast by landscape archi
tect Frederick Olmsted. If you
support the renovation as it stands,
you are destroying a pristine space,
a historical document, Stanford's
reputation as an institution with
respect to history, and lastly,
Olmsted's art! Renovating the
Quad in such a way would be like
chopping half of Hoover Tower's
dome off for a helicopter port. The
planners have not blended history
with practicality, they are sacrificing
history for practicality.
We are all a part of history; we of
the present must preserve the
integrity of the past. I dearly hope
that someone in 100 years will
thank us as they walk into the Quad

for our appreciation of history and
art and for not giving in to the easy
solutions.
