# Forced charity
## 
### 
When was the last time you gave
much thought to an idea before
you sat down at your typewriter,
Robert Larkins? I mean really
thought about it? Is writing for The
Daily just some kind of frivolous
hobby for you, something you do
between dinner and dessert?
I refer to your article (Daily, Nov.
14) whose title, "Welfare means
forced charity," fooled me at
first — I wishfully presumed heavy
satire on your part and patiently
awaited the punch line. My
mistake.
I am so annoyed right now that
any attempt on my part to unravel
your circular brainless logic will
easily fall short of the justice it is
due. Steering clear of violence, I
wish to voice a simple challenge for
your entertainment (a level at which
it will be received, I'm sure, owing
to your previous displays of mea
sured thoughtfulness):
Your sermonette is based on the
assumption that: 1) "the modern
welfare state ... is dehumanizing
us," and 2) the welfare state was
created as a substitute for private
charity. The first assumption, stated
more directly, says that pre-welfare
state laissez-faire capitalism was
somehow "humanizing." Convince
me that the bread lines and soup
kitchens of the Depression, (for
those who had access to such
niceties) were more humanizing,
less degrading than Aid to Families
with Dependent Children or food
stamps are today, and you can sell
me swamp land in Florida any day.
As to the second assumption, it is
simply inaccurate to equate charity
with welfare state programs. FDR's
New Deal was the result of unmis
takable necessity — the gross in
equities of the capitalist system
loomed larger than ever before
(and they've hardly disappeared to
date.)
If Larkins' intent is to question
our society, as is everyone's duty to
do, then I suggest he make quite
certain that the "haves" of yes
teryear were really such generous
providers that they "did not shirk
their human responsibilities in the
assumption that the state would
take care of the situation."

In regards to Robert Larkins'
"Welfare means forced charity"
column in Monday's Daily. (Nov.
14):
Bravo! I couldn't have said it
better myself (though I have tried
many times in the past.) Under the
current system, not only do we
have to relinquish an exhorbitant
amount of our personal income to
"them," but we also have to spend
extra money and extra time through
the support of political lobbying

organizations in order to ensure
that "they" spend our taxes cor
rectly. It is hilarious to hear the
whining of the welfare-statists who
have to compete with "Big Busi
ness," the Department of Defense
and now a number of right-wing
political action committees to influ
ence the budgetary process.
The entire welfare state exists,
not as a series of charitable acts,
but as a series of political bribes. It
is comforting to know that given
the ridiculousness of the current
system and the apathy and stupidity
required to maintain it, there are
still people around like Larkins who
think with their brain and not their
jerky left knee.
