# Bring back the Indian
## 
### 
Here is one solution to end all
the problems besieging the Athletic
Department: Change the name of
the Stanford mascot back from the
Cardinal to the Indians. I know
you've heard it before, but let's
look at it realistically; a swatch of
red-colored fabric is not the ideal
way of representing such a fine
institution of higher education,
which could otherwise have a darn
good football team. Even Cal has an
animate object for their mascot.
Changing our name will not only
give our school a real sense of
pride, but will also rid Athletic
Director Andy Geiger of two major
headaches, first of which is the
football team's record. Figure it this
way — the last time Stanford went
to the Rose Bowl was in 1972 under
the name of the Stanford Indians.
Since then, we have changed our
name to the Cardinals (not a bad
few minor bowl games) and then to
the Cardinal. And what has hap
pened? Our winning record has
dropped drastically in the past
couple of years.
This is not due to poor recruit
ing — it's the result of our
namesake. By changing the mascot
back to the Indians, we not only
have a tangible representative, but
we also have a chance of going to
the Rose Bowl and even winning
the National Championship.
In addition to saving our school's
football reputation, the Indian
mascot will easily remedy the Ath
letic Department's $500,000 deficit.
If we change the name back to the
Indians, we can sell all the Cardinal
T-shirts, sweats, buttons and other
assorted memorabilia as collector's
items (hey, if Stanford alums can
pay $10,000 for a horse at a Cardinal
Club auction, figure the amount of
cash they'll dish out for a red
sweatshirt.)
We'll dust off the old Indian garb
stored in the closet and needn't
worry about manufacturing new
items for the Bookstore. The alumni
will love it and start contributing
more to the Buck Club, the stu
dents will go to the games, the
other sports programs will get the
support that they deserve, and the
$500,000 will roll in easily.
