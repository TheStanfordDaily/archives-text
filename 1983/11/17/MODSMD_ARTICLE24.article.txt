### JOHN LIS 
The Stanford women's bas
ketball fought back from a 13-
point second half deficit to
take the lead, but went on to
drop a 68-66 decision to
Fresno State last night in
Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal trailed 34-27 at
the half, and three un
answered scores by the Bull
dogs stretched the deficit to
13. The Cardinal, however,
would not be counted out. Be
hind the shooting of sopho
more guard Virginia Sourlis,
the Cardinal slowly chiseled
away at the Fresno State lead,
finally forging ahead with un
der two minutes remaining to
take a 62-61 lead.
The Bulldogs came right
back to take the lead at 63-62,
but scored on its next posses
sion to go back on top, 64-63.
Fresno State went back ahead,
65-64, and when Stanford
failed to connect on their next
possession, Fresno State
scored again to stretch the
margin to 67-64 with 28
seconds remaining.
On Stanford's next time
down, the Card cut it to 67-66
with 18 seconds left. Stanford
fouled with 13 seconds left,
but didn't force a one-on-one
until only two seconds
remained.
Bulldog junior guard Chris
Wycinovski sunk one of her
shots, but Stanford did not
have time to get off the tying
shot, and dropped the 68-66
decision.
Sourlis led Stanford scorers
with 18 points on the night, 12
in the second half. Freshman
forward Kim Mercer followed
with 15, including a seven-of
eight performance from the
line. Junior forward Mary
Bradach had 12 points and
eight rebounds before she
fouled out late in the contest,
and freshman guard Erica
Mueser, playing in place of
senior Lee Ann Margerum,
who is out with a sprained
ankle, had six rebounds.
Head Coach Dotty McCrea
was disappointed in the final
outcome, but encouraged by
the team's second half perfor
mance. "If we had had the
same intensity the first half
that we had in the second, we
would have won, " she said. "
They showed an unbelieveable
amount of character in the
way they came back."

McCrea cited the squad's
youth as part of the reason for
the loss. "Our judgment at the
end wasn't good, " she said.
"When we took the lead at the
end, we should have settled
down and we didn't. That's

just inexperience."
Sourlis, the Cardinal cap
tain, looked at the team's
youth in a positive manner.
"Overall, we were very ag
gressive, " she said. "We have
a lot of potential, and we

showed it tonight. We're
going to improve as the
season goes on."
Stanford, 0-1 on the season,
will travel to Santa Clara next
Tuesday for another non
conference contest.
