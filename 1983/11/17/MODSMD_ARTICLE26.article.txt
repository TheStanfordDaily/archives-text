# Spikers meet Bruins
## 
### TOM MOORE 
With its conference hopes still very much
alive, the Stanford women's volleyball team
faces the host UCLA Bruins tonight in Pauley
Pavilion.
The Cardinal spikers can move into a
WCAA first-place tie with UCLA if they win
tonight's match. "We need to win it to have
a chance at the WCAA championship," said
assistant coach Don Shaw. "We'll just try to
play a good, solid game against them."
The 37-5 Bruins, currently ranked No. 3 in
the nation, have defeated the Card twice
this season. UCLA handed Stanford its first
conference loss at Maples Pavilion last
month and also beat the Card women in the
Wendy's Classic tournament last weekend.
Both matches went to five sets, with UCLA
coming from behind to erase Cardinal 2-0
and 2-1 leads.
"We let them get off the hook," Shaw said
of the two losses to UCLA. "This time we
have to get on top of them early and hold
them off."
Because the NCAA selects regional teams
to participate in its post-season tournament
for the national title based on team perfor

mance and national rankings, the Card
seems assured of at least an at-large berth.
However, since the WCAA champion auto
matically receives a first-round bye and a fa
vorable draw in the tournament, tonight's
game with the Bruins takes on that much
more importance.
"Sure, the WCAA title is important,"
Shaw said. "But one of our other objectives
is to keep trying to improve so we're hope
fully playing our best volleyball in the na
tionals."
The 16-6 Cardinal slipped to No. 5 in the
rankings this week after suffering two losses
in the Wendy's Classic. But if the Card wins
tonight's match, the conference title picture
improves dramactically for the team. Stan
ford finishes its season against two teams
with losing records, while the Bruins must
face USC — the only other WCAA team to
beat the Card — Saturday night on the
Trojans' home court.
The Stanford spikers will remain in South
ern California for a contest against Fullerton
State tomorrow night. The team's final
home match is next Tuesday evening against
Long Beach State.
