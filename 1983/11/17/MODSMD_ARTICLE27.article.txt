### 
Stanford will win Big Came.
Quite a statement to make consider
ing Stanford's 1-9 record, but a series
of factors point to a Cardinal victory
this year.
For the skeptics in the crowd, just re
member, no one was picking UC-
Berkeley in the Big Game in 1980 and
1982 when the Golden Bears upset
heavily favored Cardinal squads. Fol
lowing is a list of reasons, all of which
point to a Stanford victory.
History — History strongly points to
a Stanford victory Saturday. In 1976
when Cardinal Coach Jack Christian
sen was fired preceding Big Game, an
enthused Stanford squad came out
and won one for the coach. In 1980,
when Cal Coach Roger Theder was un
der pressure, his team defeated a
heavily favored Stanford squad.
In a peculiar twist of history, when
Cal Coach )oe Kapp played in his first
Big Game for the Bears in 1956, he led
his team to an upset victory over Stan
ford as his coach, Pappy Waldorf, an
nounced his resignation prior to the
game. Ironically enough, Stanford
Coach Paul Wiggin played in that game
for Stanford. It seems only fitting now
with Wiggin's resignation that his
players win one for him to get the final
revenge on Kapp.
Finally, just the fact that the Bears
are expected to win the game points to
a Stanford victory. No one ever seems
to be able to predict this game, so if
everyone thinks that Cal is going to
win, put your money on Stanford.
"Win one for the Wig" — Wiggin ex
plicitly said that he would never make
such a speech following last Saturday's
loss. "I don't think that I could tell my
players, 'Win one for the Wig,' " he
explained. "That's not me." Yet Wig
gin is well liked by his players. While
the Cardinal may have been listless
against Oregon, it's likely that many of
the players were looking ahead to Cal.
A victory over Oregon would have
meant very little compared to a victory
against the Bears.
Following the game, Wiggin said
that his players had a special team
meeting to which he was not invited.
Stanford quarterback )ohn Paye said
that the meeting was about Big Game.

"A few players discussed their feelings
and discussed next week's game,"
Paye said. "I didn't go through what
the other players went through in last
year's game. Don't worry, we'll be up
for next week's game."
Stanford linebacker Mike Noble
said, "Our leadership on the team was
kind of lacking," explaining about the
situation before the meeting. "During
the meeting, however, about 25 per
cent of the team got up and started
talking."
No doubt, the meeting had to do
with winning one for the old coach.
While Wiggin won't admit it, the
player's can't help winning one for
"Wig." And if the players don't get
psyched up, at least Wiggin says that
he will. "I would very much like to win
that football game (against Cal), but I
don't suit up," Wiggin said. Maybe
Wiggin should suit up.
Last year's game —If last year's game
can't inspire the Stanford players, then
maybe the entire team should enter a
stoic of the year competition. There is
still a lot of bad blood between the two
teams. Most of the Stanford players
still feel they were robbed last year, of
a victory, a winning season, a bowl,
and ultimately, some say, their coach.
A bowl bid and victory would certainly
have eased the resignation pressure
on Wiggin and may have led to mo
mentum for this season.
Kapp's post-game comments last
year like "the Bear will never die,"
must have raised a few eyebrows at
Stanford. Anybody who does not turn
red with anger and disgust after
hearing Kapp speak is either deaf, or a
zen Buddhist. This is Stanford's chance
to redeem itself, to reclaim the Axe and
replace the screw which has been sit
ting in the space where the Axe should
be.
Stanford tight end Jim Clymer sums
up the anger felt by many of the
players, not only about the final play it
self, but about the way the Cal players
and coaches accepted it.
"To me, it was the way they ac
cepted it that really bugged me,"
Clymer said. " The way that Kapp ac
cepted it.
"One guy was tackled. They had an
illegal formation. Marriott Ford (a Cal

running back who was part of the final
play) came over and was putting it in
our face. Obviously the play should
have been nullified, but it was the way
that they accepted it that bothered me
most. I hate Cal."
Noble, f he man with the last chance
to catch Kevin Moen in last year's final
play, was even more succinct. "We
didn't deserve what they (Cal) did to
us," he said. "We have to set them
straight."
The Slapshot Syndrome —Stanford
has never been known as a particularly
physical team, but this week's game
could change that. Clymer, a soft
spoken individual, was asked at a news
conference earlier this week, if the
team would be looking over highlights
of the final play last year. Clymer said
that the team would be renting a
movie and then joked that it would
probably be Slapshot, a movie which
depicts a hockey team that goes from
the cellar to No. 1 by playing physical.
Enough said.
Lady Luck —After last year's game,
one has to figure that Lady Luck cannot
continue to be so kind to the Golden
Bears. Their luck has to run out
sometime. Why not Saturday?
Ink Bowl —This under publicized
event actually has more bearing on the
Big Came than all the other factors
combined. The Ink Bowl is a football
game played before the Big Game be
tween members of The Stanford Daily
and the Daily Californian. In the last 10
years, the school which has won the
Ink Bowl has also won Big Game. With
inside knowledge on this year's Ink
Bowl team, this writer is confident in
predicting a Stanford victory.
So there you have it. The reason why
Stanford will (or rather, should) win
Big Game. Should one put money on
it?
Well it seems perfectly logical that
the Cardinal can't help but win.
But come to think of it, it is Big
Came and any team which looks like a
sure winner has to lose.
My money is on a fantastic Big Game
party. That's the only sure way to win.
Nevertheless, this looks like a year
where the mighty Cardinal will leap
out of its Crayola box and paint Oskie
red with revenge. In a misquote of joe
kapp, the Cardinal color will not die.

Stanford will win Big Came.

illegal formation. Marriott Ford (a Cal

running back who was part of the final
play) came over and was putting it in
our face. Obviously the play should
have been nullified, but it was the way
that they accepted it that bothered me
most. I hate Cal."
Noble, f he man with the last chance
to catch Kevin Moen in last year's final
play, was even more succinct. "We
didn't deserve what they (Cal) did to
us," he said. "We have to set them
straight."
The Slapshot Syndrome —Stanford
has never been known as a particularly
physical team, but this week's game
could change that. Clymer, a soft
spoken individual, was asked at a news
conference earlier this week, if the
team would be looking over highlights
of the final play last year. Clymer said
that the team would be renting a
movie and then joked that it would
probably be Slapshot, a movie which
depicts a hockey team that goes from
the cellar to No. 1 by playing physical.
Enough said.
Lady Luck —After last year's game,
one has to figure that Lady Luck cannot
continue to be so kind to the Golden
Bears. Their luck has to run out
sometime. Why not Saturday?
Ink Bowl —This under publicized
event actually has more bearing on the
Big Came than all the other factors
combined. The Ink Bowl is a football
game played before the Big Game be
tween members of The Stanford Daily
and the Daily Californian. In the last 10
years, the school which has won the
Ink Bowl has also won Big Game. With
inside knowledge on this year's Ink
Bowl team, this writer is confident in
predicting a Stanford victory.
So there you have it. The reason why
Stanford will (or rather, should) win
Big Game. Should one put money on
it?
Well it seems perfectly logical that
the Cardinal can't help but win.
But come to think of it, it is Big
Came and any team which looks like a
sure winner has to lose.
My money is on a fantastic Big Game
party. That's the only sure way to win.
Nevertheless, this looks like a year
where the mighty Cardinal will leap
out of its Crayola box and paint Oskie
red with revenge. In a misquote of joe
kapp, the Cardinal color will not die.

Stanford will win Big Came.
Quite a statement to make consider
ing Stanford's 1-9 record, but a series
of factors point to a Cardinal victory
this year.
For the skeptics in the crowd, just re
member, no one was picking UC-
Berkeley in the Big Game in 1980 and
1982 when the Golden Bears upset
heavily favored Cardinal squads. Fol
lowing is a list of reasons, all of which
point to a Stanford victory.
History — History strongly points to
a Stanford victory Saturday. In 1976
when Cardinal Coach Jack Christian
sen was fired preceding Big Game, an
enthused Stanford squad came out
and won one for the coach. In 1980,
when Cal Coach Roger Theder was un
der pressure, his team defeated a
heavily favored Stanford squad.
In a peculiar twist of history, when
Cal Coach )oe Kapp played in his first
Big Game for the Bears in 1956, he led
his team to an upset victory over Stan
ford as his coach, Pappy Waldorf, an
nounced his resignation prior to the
game. Ironically enough, Stanford
Coach Paul Wiggin played in that game
for Stanford. It seems only fitting now
with Wiggin's resignation that his
players win one for him to get the final
revenge on Kapp.
Finally, just the fact that the Bears
are expected to win the game points to
a Stanford victory. No one ever seems
to be able to predict this game, so if
everyone thinks that Cal is going to
win, put your money on Stanford.
"Win one for the Wig" — Wiggin ex
plicitly said that he would never make
such a speech following last Saturday's
loss. "I don't think that I could tell my
players, 'Win one for the Wig,' " he
explained. "That's not me." Yet Wig
gin is well liked by his players. While
the Cardinal may have been listless
against Oregon, it's likely that many of
the players were looking ahead to Cal.
A victory over Oregon would have
meant very little compared to a victory
against the Bears.
Following the game, Wiggin said
that his players had a special team
meeting to which he was not invited.
Stanford quarterback )ohn Paye said
that the meeting was about Big Game.

"A few players discussed their feelings
and discussed next week's game,"
Paye said. "I didn't go through what
the other players went through in last
year's game. Don't worry, we'll be up
for next week's game."
Stanford linebacker Mike Noble
said, "Our leadership on the team was
kind of lacking," explaining about the
situation before the meeting. "During
the meeting, however, about 25 per
cent of the team got up and started
talking."
No doubt, the meeting had to do
with winning one for the old coach.
While Wiggin won't admit it, the
player's can't help winning one for
"Wig." And if the players don't get
psyched up, at least Wiggin says that
he will. "I would very much like to win
that football game (against Cal), but I
don't suit up," Wiggin said. Maybe
Wiggin should suit up.
Last year's game —If last year's game
can't inspire the Stanford players, then
maybe the entire team should enter a
stoic of the year competition. There is
still a lot of bad blood between the two
teams. Most of the Stanford players
still feel they were robbed last year, of
a victory, a winning season, a bowl,
and ultimately, some say, their coach.
A bowl bid and victory would certainly
have eased the resignation pressure
on Wiggin and may have led to mo
mentum for this season.
Kapp's post-game comments last
year like "the Bear will never die,"
must have raised a few eyebrows at
Stanford. Anybody who does not turn
red with anger and disgust after
hearing Kapp speak is either deaf, or a
zen Buddhist. This is Stanford's chance
to redeem itself, to reclaim the Axe and
replace the screw which has been sit
ting in the space where the Axe should
be.
Stanford tight end Jim Clymer sums
up the anger felt by many of the
players, not only about the final play it
self, but about the way the Cal players
and coaches accepted it.
"To me, it was the way they ac
cepted it that really bugged me,"
Clymer said. " The way that Kapp ac
cepted it.
"One guy was tackled. They had an
illegal formation. Marriott Ford (a Cal

running back who was part of the final
play) came over and was putting it in
our face. Obviously the play should
