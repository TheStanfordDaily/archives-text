# Hardin: from walk-on to starter
## 
### ETHAN ORLINSKY 
There isn't much to cheer
about in Stanford Stadium
these days; unless, of course,
you are rooting for the oppos
ing team. Stanford football
hasn't been too exciting this
year — the players are down,
the coaches are down, the stu
dents are down and the
alumni are down.
Nonetheless, you probably
will be treated to something
special in Saturday's football
game against UC-Berkeley.
Don't expect any new plays;
no, it's not a surprise. Rather,
it has been one of Stanford's
few bright spots this season —
the Tripp Hardin punting ex
hibition.
On the field he wears num
ber 12. When he's in the
game, consider giving him a
round of applause, because
he is one of the few players
not losing yardage these days.
Hardin is one of the finest
punters in the league. He
boasts a 41.7-yard average this
year, placing him fifth in the
Pacific-10 Conference. But
Stanford football has not al
ways been so good to Hardin.
Hardin, an industrial engi
neering major, originally
made the team as a walk-on in
1979, but was setback by mul
tiple knee injuries. More sig
nificantly, he was shuffled off
into a crowd of no-names.
"Frankly, I didn't think they
(Stanford) gave me a chance to
be part of the future," Hardin
said in a recent interview.
"They weren't trying to
develop me. They didn't really
give a damn about me. It was a
little disheartening."
After two and a half seasons
of sitting on the bench, and
not having the support with
which to continue, Hardin
quit the team.
"After sitting out a year, it
came to the point where I
became a well-rounded stu
dent, where football wasn't
the main thing in my life,"
Hardin said. Having come to
grips with his situation,
however, he was ready to give
it one more shot.
"I relaxed about it — and a
few teammates kind of talked
me into it. I started feeling
better about my health and my
knee felt great, so (I said) what
the heck."
But the battle for the start
ing spot was not easy. For

tunately tor Hardin, he per
formed well enough in 1982
spring football to earn himself
a spot on the team. By the
third game of the season (on
national television and before
nearly 90,000 fans against

Ohio State), Hardin was given
a chance when the Stanford
coaches were not satisfied
with the performance of Greg
Topp, who transferred to San
Diego State earlier this
season. From there, it has
been all uphill for Hardin.

Hardin maintains that this
year has been much easier for
him mentally. First, he no
longer has to compete for his
position; second, his experi
ence as the starting punter has
increased his confidence.

"Last year when I was compet
ing with Topp early on, I
wasn't really relaxed," Hardin
said.
"I was competing against
him instead of myself or the
other team. I was just trying to
get the ball in the air. I was

trying to keep my job." This
season, however, Hardin has
the confidence to focus on
being as good a punter as pos
sible and "executing as best as
I can.
"I'm secure about my job,"
he said. "All I have to do now
is worry about the game that's
coming up."
Hardin is a composed indi
vidual. In game situations he
forces himself to "keep a cool
frame of mind, because if you
let your emotions get away,
you have just as much chance
of hitting a lousy punt as you
do a great one." This com
posure has carried him into a
very successful season.
Despite his ability to control
his emotions, Hardin has had
some trying times this season.
He has been called into punt
63 times (second most in the
Pac-10) and has suffered
untimely blocked punts. Al
though Hardin likes to punt,
he realizes the team would
rather not have to use him.
Once called upon, Hardin's
motives become totally unsel
fish. He said, "All I can think
about is helping the defense,
and getting the football out (of
Stanford territory) as far as I
can."
Given all his credible statis
tics and his day-by-day im
provements, there are still
questions about Hardin's
future. As far as he is con
cerned, the season's remain
ing game is extremely impor
tant.
The prospect of a profes
sional football career can be
determined in this season's
final games. "I'll have to per
form extremely well to get the
chance (to play professional
ly)," he says.
Though he dreams of a
career in football, he admits
there would be other factors
to consider in deciding whe
ther or not to play if a profes
sional team gives him a tryout.
Yet he feels tempted to jump
at the opportunity because
"you're only young once."
Hardin attributes the Car
dinal's losses this year to "a
lack of perfect execution.
There is always some type of
mistake that has happened in
every game."
Although the 1983 season
may be one the Cardinal may
soon wish to forget, Hardin's
consistency is hard to ignore.
