# Pros for Williams, Tolliver?
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
The contrasts are strik
ing. Senior strong safety
Vaughn Williams is 6-foot-2
and 189 pounds. His bone
jarring tackles and tena
cious defensive play have
made him a four-year
starter at Stanford and
produced numerous post
season honors. A native of
Denver, Colo., Williams has
spearheaded a metamor
phosis of the Cardinal
defense over the course of
his four years on the Farm.
Fifth-year senior Mike
Tolliver stands at an even 6-
feet and weighs in at 175
pounds, small for a major
college wide receiver.
While Williams filled an ob
vious void, Tolliver toiled
behind the latest of Stan
ford's legendary wide
receivers — Ken Margerum
and Andre Tyler. He prefers
to use speed and finesse to
elude his attackers. Oppo
nents have watched
Lancaster, Calif.'s favorite
son slowly climb the Stan
ford career records lists,
while becoming one of the
nation's leading receivers
in 1983.
But when the gun finally
sounds to end the 1983 edi
tion of Big Game, these two
seniors will find themselves
in similar situations. Their
college football days will
have ended, left only as a
stepping stone to potential
professional careers.
Mike Tolliver bubbles
just thinking about the ful
fillment of a childhood
dream. "Ever since I was
small, I'd watch the
(National Football League)
game of the week and I'd
say, 'I'm going to do that,
that's me.'
"I want to play for some
one who needs me," he
continued. "I don't really
prefer cold weather, but
I'm realistic and I know that
I don't have the talents of a
John Elway. I'm not going
to get $5 million and go
anyplace I want to."
Williams, on the other
hand, expresses his future
plans in the cool, concise
and business-like fashion
of a true defensive special
ist. "From what scouts and
coaches tell me, I'll have a

good chance of playing pro
football," he said. "I'm not
reallv worried about that
now. I've got unfinished
business here."
Indeed, Williams views
the annual November
showdown with UC-
Berkeley not as a new con
test, but as the completion
of last year's charade. The
hard-hitting defensive back
would like this year's game
to be decided by the
players on the field, not the
officials or a wandering
band.

Aside from the disap
pointment of last year's
fiasco in Strawberry Can
yon and the absence of a
bowl appearance in four
years, the ex-cornerback
has found his experiences
at Stanford, both on the
gridiron and in the class
room, to be truly reward
ing.
And why not? A First
Team AII-Pacific-10 member
as a strong safety in 1981
and a free safety in 1982, he
led the team in tackles a
year ago with 94 stops and
this year is currently
second behind linebacker
Dave Wyman. Williams has
also been named
honorable mention All-
America the past two years.
It is no surprise that his
style of attacking opposing
offenses with reckless
abandon, literally hurling
himself at on-rushing
linemen and ball carriers
has been the cornerstone
of the new Stanford
defense that is now 21st
best in the nation against
the pass.

"I've played extremely
hard on every play from
scrimmage," he noted in
reflecting on his football
career, "and because I
played hard I don't have
any regrets."
The human biology
major has attacked his
schoolwork with much the
same zeal, adding that
Stanford "challenged me in
every way. You have to
come home after practice
and study. If you quit, you
fall behind and falling be
hind makes winning in
school difficult."
One person who is no
stranger to winning is Mike
Tolliver. As a running back
who caught only one pass
in high school, Tolliver
learned the receiving trade
well enough under Mar
gerum and Tyler to become
one of the best in Stanford
history. He ranks fifth in
career receptions and
fourth in total receiving
yardage. This season he is
currently placed 15th in the
nation with 57 catches.
Cal will attest to Tolliver's
blessings. Last year he
burned the Bears for 115
yards on six catches in a
loss he now looks to
avenge this Saturday.
"It doesn't matter what
your record is (before the
Big Came), he theorized.
"People say that you re
member your career from
your last game. I think it's
the same thing in my case.
Knowing that the last game
you played in college you
beat the rival team, you've
got bragging rights for the
rest of your life."
Like his teammate, Wil
liams sees Saturday's
matchup as a way to wash
out the bitter taste of the
1983 season and to solidify
his place in Stanford foot
ball history. He recalled,
"In 1981 we went through a
similar thing (an 0-4 start). I
figured that would be the
bottom of the barrel. (This
year's trouble) has made
me reach down and play a
little harder.
"Because I'm a senior,
I'm worried about going
out with a good reputation
as a solid, all-around foot
ball player."

as a strong safety in 1981
and a free safety in 1982, he
led the team in tackles a
year ago with 94 stops and
this year is currently
second behind linebacker
Dave Wyman. Williams has
also been named
honorable mention All-
America the past two years.
It is no surprise that his
style of attacking opposing
offenses with reckless
abandon, literally hurling
himself at on-rushing
linemen and ball carriers
has been the cornerstone
of the new Stanford
defense that is now 21st
best in the nation against
the pass.

"I've played extremely
hard on every play from
scrimmage," he noted in
reflecting on his football
career, "and because I
played hard I don't have
any regrets."
The human biology
major has attacked his
schoolwork with much the
same zeal, adding that
Stanford "challenged me in
every way. You have to
come home after practice
and study. If you quit, you
fall behind and falling be
hind makes winning in
school difficult."
One person who is no
stranger to winning is Mike
Tolliver. As a running back
who caught only one pass
in high school, Tolliver
learned the receiving trade
well enough under Mar
gerum and Tyler to become
one of the best in Stanford
history. He ranks fifth in
career receptions and
fourth in total receiving
yardage. This season he is
currently placed 15th in the
nation with 57 catches.
Cal will attest to Tolliver's
blessings. Last year he
burned the Bears for 115
yards on six catches in a
loss he now looks to
avenge this Saturday.
"It doesn't matter what
your record is (before the
Big Came), he theorized.
"People say that you re
member your career from
your last game. I think it's
the same thing in my case.
Knowing that the last game
you played in college you
beat the rival team, you've
got bragging rights for the
rest of your life."
Like his teammate, Wil
liams sees Saturday's
matchup as a way to wash
out the bitter taste of the
1983 season and to solidify
his place in Stanford foot
ball history. He recalled,
"In 1981 we went through a
similar thing (an 0-4 start). I
figured that would be the
bottom of the barrel. (This
year's trouble) has made
me reach down and play a
little harder.
"Because I'm a senior,
I'm worried about going
out with a good reputation
as a solid, all-around foot
ball player."


Vaughn Williams
The contrasts are strik
ing. Senior strong safety
Vaughn Williams is 6-foot-2
and 189 pounds. His bone
jarring tackles and tena
cious defensive play have
made him a four-year
starter at Stanford and
produced numerous post
season honors. A native of
Denver, Colo., Williams has
spearheaded a metamor
phosis of the Cardinal
defense over the course of
his four years on the Farm.
Fifth-year senior Mike
Tolliver stands at an even 6-
feet and weighs in at 175
pounds, small for a major
college wide receiver.
While Williams filled an ob
vious void, Tolliver toiled
behind the latest of Stan
ford's legendary wide
receivers — Ken Margerum
and Andre Tyler. He prefers
to use speed and finesse to
elude his attackers. Oppo
nents have watched
Lancaster, Calif.'s favorite
son slowly climb the Stan
ford career records lists,
while becoming one of the
nation's leading receivers
in 1983.
But when the gun finally
sounds to end the 1983 edi
tion of Big Game, these two
seniors will find themselves
in similar situations. Their
college football days will
have ended, left only as a
stepping stone to potential
professional careers.
Mike Tolliver bubbles
just thinking about the ful
fillment of a childhood
dream. "Ever since I was
small, I'd watch the
(National Football League)
game of the week and I'd
say, 'I'm going to do that,
that's me.'
"I want to play for some
one who needs me," he
continued. "I don't really
prefer cold weather, but
I'm realistic and I know that
I don't have the talents of a
John Elway. I'm not going
to get $5 million and go
anyplace I want to."
Williams, on the other
hand, expresses his future
plans in the cool, concise
and business-like fashion
of a true defensive special
ist. "From what scouts and
coaches tell me, I'll have a

good chance of playing pro
football," he said. "I'm not
reallv worried about that
now. I've got unfinished
business here."
Indeed, Williams views
the annual November
showdown with UC-
Berkeley not as a new con
test, but as the completion
of last year's charade. The
hard-hitting defensive back
would like this year's game
to be decided by the
players on the field, not the
officials or a wandering
band.

Aside from the disap
pointment of last year's
fiasco in Strawberry Can
yon and the absence of a
bowl appearance in four
years, the ex-cornerback
has found his experiences
at Stanford, both on the
gridiron and in the class
room, to be truly reward
ing.
And why not? A First
Team AII-Pacific-10 member
