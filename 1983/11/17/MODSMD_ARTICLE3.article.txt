# University recognizes fraternity
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Sigma Phi Epsilon yesterday
became the second fraternity in two
weeks to be granted full campus
privileges by the University, accor
ding to Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Norman Robinson.
Julio Tapia, president of the frater
nity here, said a petition for recogni
tion was submitted to Row Director
Diane Conklin during the first week
of school this fall. The fraternity has
the second largest number of chap
ters in the country, he said.
The campus group presently has
colony status and may be granted
charter membership in the national
organization as eariy as next spring,
according to Jim McVey, one of the
founders of the fraternity here. He
said the group, which has already
named a chapter counsellor and es
tablished its officers and financial
structure, must now conduct a suc
cessful rush next spring and form an
alumni board to handle long-term
financing.
McVey said the campus group was
formed by nine members of the
Newts, an intramural team, who
decided the best way of "tying our
selves together while we're still
here" was to form a fraternity.
"Most of us have known each
other since our freshman year,"
Tapia said, adding that a primary
reason the group organized was to
let its members become "a little bit
more socially aware and to meet
other people."
The group wanted to create its
own structure and direct its own
policies instead of joining another
fraternity, Tapia said.
