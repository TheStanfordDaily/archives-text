# Seniors finish football chores on the Farm
## 
### 
This Saturday, 22 Stanford
seniors will be involved with
their final collegiate football
game.
Some of them, like receiver
Mike Tolliver, safety Vaughn
Williams, defensive end John
Bergren and punter Tripp Har
din have seen extensive
playing time for the Cardinal
while others have yet to play.
For all of these players,
however, the Big Came is
something special. Not just
because it is against UC-
Berkeley, but because it is the
last time that many of them
will ever be involved with or
ganized football.
Many of these players have
practiced for four long years
without the chance to receive
any kind of recognition — to
get their name and pictures in
the papers. Yet they've
practiced the same hours, suf
fered the same kinds of injur
ies, and experienced the same
wins and defeats.
