## 'Heat and Dust' uneven and flat 
### CHRIS JARVIS 
Several years ago French
Lieutenant's Woman was a
very chic movie. The mystery
and romance of Meryl Streep
had a lot to do with that, but
critics were also attracted by
the literary quality and blend
ing of two different time peri
ods. Heat and Dust has the
same ingredients, the same
ambition, but ends up as a ter
ribly contused movie that can
never make up its mind whe
ther it's a story of the 1920s or
the 1980s.
Julie Christie plays Anne, a
modern young Englishwoman
who is fascinated by the scan
dalous past of her great aunt
Olivia (Greta Scacchi). Arriv
ing as a young bride in the
19205, Olivia rejects the rigid
British lifestyle for the excite
ment and enchantment of the
India that the British do not
rule. All the principals in
volved in Olivia's love triangle
— her husband Douglas
(Christopher Cazenove) and
the Nawab (Shashi kappoor)
— give rather stereotvpical
performances, which isn't all
that bad, since we see them as
Anne imagines them.
With few concerns and

much imagination, Anne jour
neys to India to relive the lite
of Olivia. With many more
worries and much less im
agination, director lames l\or\
presents the two stories. The
two-thirds of the film that is
set in the 1920s has its share ot
dull British dinner parties, but
at least it's more interesting
than the drab scenes of
modern day India which Anne
confronts with an air of
vacuous happiness.

Heat and Dust resembles
French Lieutenant's Woman
but lacks its complexity. In
stead of the mvsterv that sur
rounds Meryl Streep, a certain
childlike innocence clings to
Christie and Scacchi. Christie
in particular is a one
dimensional character.
Modern India presents her
with very different images of
the world she imagines from
her great-aunt's letter: shabby
buildings, a disturbed Ameri

can drop-out ot the 19605, a
landlord who wants to sleep
with her. Gone are the Indian
princes, the British aristocrats
and, above all, the elegance of
the 19205. But Christie remains
unaffected by it all, following
mechanically in Olivia's
footsteps, making whatever
substitutions she must. Her
lack ot growth is the film's
most serious drawback.
Like many films that fail to
separate themselves from the
novel, Heat and Dust has defi
nite problems with pacing.
The middle seems to drag on
and on, while the end wraps
up the story in less than 10
minutes. One gets the same
sort of feeling at the end of
Women in Love (an even more
literary film made from the
D.H. Lawrence story). That
film didn't end, it merely
paused to let the credits roll
on. The effect isn't so bad in
Heat and Dust, but there is a
definitely forced quality to the
end.
The ending is the least of
the film's problems, though. A
lackluster performance by
Julie Christie and confusion
on Ivory's part make Heat and
Dust an ambitious failure.


TRANS-CULTURAL SCANDAL: Shashi kapoor and Greta
Scacchi portray an Indian prince and an upper-crust British
woman involved in a shocking affair in Heat and Dust.
