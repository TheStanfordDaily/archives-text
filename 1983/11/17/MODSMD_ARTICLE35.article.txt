# Plimsouls, Los Lobos visit Palo Alto
## 
### KEVIN GROSS 
Last Thursday night's concert at the
Keystone Palo Alto can quite fairly be
referred to as a two-for-one deal. There's
little to be said for the first act, Broken E.
This group is an excellent argument for
being late to the show — because it will
ease the ear strain.
The second band, however, was
definitely not to be missed. Los Lobos'
music is perhaps best qualified as "rock
with a Mexican touch." This distinction is
the result of their combination of half
Spanish-half English lyrics with a 1950's
style beat. Combine the dual linguistics
with a good instrumental assortment and
you have the Los Lobos style.
With his dark glasses and bulky figure,
the lead singer looks like a hispanic ver
sion of lake Blues. He played the accor
dion, and was accompanied by backup
vocals from another lead guitar, drums
and bass guitar. Add a tenor sax and
you've got the picture.
The set got off to a bad start with "How
Much Can I Do" and "San Antonio." just
as I began wondering why Los Lobos is in
the music business, they drilled into "I
Love You So." Almost instantly everyone
headed for the dance floor. By the end of
"Come on Let's Go" (a San Fernando Val
ley original), "The Walking Song" and
"Let's Say Good Night" the dance floor
was packed solid.
Los Lobos played 12 tunes and stayed
on the stage for more than 45 minutes.
They left, not to the usual boos for an
opener, but to enthusiastic applause.
After a very short break they returned to
play a slow 1950s song, "Sleep Walk,"
and ended with their version of "Wheel"
(the original was done bv Fats Domino).

While not musically perfect, Los Lobos
was perhaps the best dance band I've
heard in quite some time.
Don't come to the Keystone if you've
got an 8 a.m. class the next day. The Plim
souls didn't arrive on stage until just
before midnight — usual for a Thursday
show. They slammed right into "Shaky
Citv" — a good, peppy opener with lots
of guitar string. They immediately fol
lowed with their most recent hit, "How
Long Will It Take?" Note that it's always
good to move into a hit early in the show,
because it helps to get the whole audi
ence hyped, especially those who are not
"hardcore" followers of the band.
The crowd stayed hyped through "I'll
Get Lucky," "Making Up for Lost Time,"
"In This Town" and "Hush, Hush." This
last song reminded me otThe Cars music.
In general, though The Plimsouls have a
very unique sound — not too harsh (i.e.
Def Leppard, AC-DC, Ozzy Osbourne)
and not too mellow (i.e. Barry Manilow,
Bryan Adams) but just good, solid new
rock.
Appearances, however, were anything
but original. Lead guitarist Peter Case
looks like a twin of john Lennon. The
same stocky build, wire glasses — but
with a different voice. Back-up vocalist
Eddie Munoz also plays the guitar. For a
moment I thought Mick jagger had
stepped on stage, because Munoz could
easily double for the famous Rolling
Stones singer. While Munoz's antics were
flashy, they were no match for jagger. But
then, can anyone match Mick?
The bass player, Dave Pahoa, was un
obtrusive, and did his job well. Drummer
Lou Ramirez rounded out the quartet by
doing a great job on percussions.

After the first six songs, the band
moved into even more dance music with
"Now" (White Lies), "Inch by Inch" and
"Zero." The Plimsouls' easygoing philos
ophy to life is well refleced in the lyrics of
"Inch by Inch": Lost in the dark/ We're
caught in slow motion You close your
eyes and let the world slip away . . ./ Take
it day by day/ Moving inch by inch/ It
seems so slow/ And we've got so far to go.
The song "Hobo" saw Case switch
from guitar to harmonica. Needless to
say, he was drenched by the end of the
song.
The band then proceeded to ramble
through four more originals. They played
all but two of the songs from their new al
bum, (Everywhere at Once). Finally, the
band broke into "A Million Miles Away."
Again, we get The Plimsouls philosophy
coming through loud and clear, in their
most popular song: I'm at the wrong end
of the looking glass/ Trying to hold on to
the hands of the past and you/ And there's
nothing left to bring me back . . . I'm a
million miles away.
The set concluded with the band mem
bers taking to the air in "Jump Jive."
Drummer Ramirez went into a frenzy —
his intensity was simply amazing.
After a one-minute break The Plimsouls
returned for an encore which included
"You Can't Judge a Book by its Cover,"
"Make it Feel Alright" and "Come On."
Unfortunately, much of the audience had
filtered out, so they also missed the treat
of a second encore.
All in all, The Plimsouls, with their red
tennies, put on a memorable show. Don't
miss them next time they're here, be
cause they may soon be moving on to
those big impersonal grandstands.

the hands of the past and you/ And there's
nothing left to bring me back . . . I'm a
million miles away.
The set concluded with the band mem
bers taking to the air in "Jump Jive."
Drummer Ramirez went into a frenzy —
his intensity was simply amazing.
After a one-minute break The Plimsouls
returned for an encore which included
"You Can't Judge a Book by its Cover,"
"Make it Feel Alright" and "Come On."
Unfortunately, much of the audience had
filtered out, so they also missed the treat
of a second encore.
All in all, The Plimsouls, with their red
tennies, put on a memorable show. Don't
miss them next time they're here, be
cause they may soon be moving on to
those big impersonal grandstands.
Last Thursday night's concert at the
Keystone Palo Alto can quite fairly be
referred to as a two-for-one deal. There's
little to be said for the first act, Broken E.
This group is an excellent argument for
being late to the show — because it will
ease the ear strain.
The second band, however, was
definitely not to be missed. Los Lobos'
music is perhaps best qualified as "rock
with a Mexican touch." This distinction is
the result of their combination of half
Spanish-half English lyrics with a 1950's
style beat. Combine the dual linguistics
with a good instrumental assortment and
you have the Los Lobos style.
With his dark glasses and bulky figure,
the lead singer looks like a hispanic ver
sion of lake Blues. He played the accor
dion, and was accompanied by backup
vocals from another lead guitar, drums
and bass guitar. Add a tenor sax and
you've got the picture.
The set got off to a bad start with "How
Much Can I Do" and "San Antonio." just
as I began wondering why Los Lobos is in
the music business, they drilled into "I
Love You So." Almost instantly everyone
headed for the dance floor. By the end of
"Come on Let's Go" (a San Fernando Val
ley original), "The Walking Song" and
"Let's Say Good Night" the dance floor
was packed solid.
Los Lobos played 12 tunes and stayed
on the stage for more than 45 minutes.
They left, not to the usual boos for an
opener, but to enthusiastic applause.
After a very short break they returned to
play a slow 1950s song, "Sleep Walk,"
and ended with their version of "Wheel"
(the original was done bv Fats Domino).

While not musically perfect, Los Lobos
was perhaps the best dance band I've
heard in quite some time.
Don't come to the Keystone if you've
got an 8 a.m. class the next day. The Plim
souls didn't arrive on stage until just
before midnight — usual for a Thursday
show. They slammed right into "Shaky
Citv" — a good, peppy opener with lots
of guitar string. They immediately fol
lowed with their most recent hit, "How
Long Will It Take?" Note that it's always
good to move into a hit early in the show,
because it helps to get the whole audi
ence hyped, especially those who are not
"hardcore" followers of the band.
The crowd stayed hyped through "I'll
Get Lucky," "Making Up for Lost Time,"
"In This Town" and "Hush, Hush." This
last song reminded me otThe Cars music.
In general, though The Plimsouls have a
very unique sound — not too harsh (i.e.
Def Leppard, AC-DC, Ozzy Osbourne)
and not too mellow (i.e. Barry Manilow,
Bryan Adams) but just good, solid new
rock.
Appearances, however, were anything
but original. Lead guitarist Peter Case
looks like a twin of john Lennon. The
same stocky build, wire glasses — but
with a different voice. Back-up vocalist
Eddie Munoz also plays the guitar. For a
moment I thought Mick jagger had
stepped on stage, because Munoz could
easily double for the famous Rolling
Stones singer. While Munoz's antics were
flashy, they were no match for jagger. But
then, can anyone match Mick?
The bass player, Dave Pahoa, was un
obtrusive, and did his job well. Drummer
Lou Ramirez rounded out the quartet by
doing a great job on percussions.

After the first six songs, the band
moved into even more dance music with
"Now" (White Lies), "Inch by Inch" and
"Zero." The Plimsouls' easygoing philos
ophy to life is well refleced in the lyrics of
"Inch by Inch": Lost in the dark/ We're
caught in slow motion You close your
eyes and let the world slip away . . ./ Take
it day by day/ Moving inch by inch/ It
seems so slow/ And we've got so far to go.
The song "Hobo" saw Case switch
from guitar to harmonica. Needless to
say, he was drenched by the end of the
song.
The band then proceeded to ramble
through four more originals. They played
all but two of the songs from their new al
bum, (Everywhere at Once). Finally, the
band broke into "A Million Miles Away."
Again, we get The Plimsouls philosophy
coming through loud and clear, in their
most popular song: I'm at the wrong end
of the looking glass/ Trying to hold on to
the hands of the past and you/ And there's
nothing left to bring me back . . . I'm a
million miles away.
