# Fosse's 'Star 80': fascinatingly bad
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Bob Fosse has an unerring in
stinct for the glittering point at
which the hypnotic and the repel
lent become indistinguishable from
each other; his movies have such a
strong erotic pull that you devour
them, even when you know they
aren't very good. (Bob Fosse is the
director Paul Schrader keeps trying
to be.) I didn't like Lenny or All That
Jazz, and I didn't care for his new
film, Star 80, a treatment of the
Dorothy Stratten story, but I was
fascinated by all three of them.
Fosse isn't timid about getting his
hands full of the muck of sordid,
violent, sexually twisted lives, or
about getting the audience's hands
full of it. Watching Star 80 is like
reading a National Enquirer story
written by a master stylist — God
knows it offers you nothing of
value, but you can't stop turning
the pages.
Dorothy Stratten was an unaf
fected Vancouver teenager when
her boyfriend, Paul Snider, sent
nude photographs of her to Playboy
and won her a contract; in 1980, she
was chosen Playmate of the Year,
landed a major role in Peter Bog
danovich's They All Laughed, and
became his lover. In August of that
year, Snider, who had married her
almost as soon as she became a
Playboy model, shot her to death
and then killed himself. I haven't
seen They All Laughed, but Strat
ten's photographs confirm the
popular claim that her appeal lay in
her wholesomeness and unpreten
tiousness.
Fosse dedicated the picture to the
late Paddy Chayefsky, who wrote a
fictionalized treatment of the
Marilyn Monroe story called The
Goddess in 1958, and he chose Car
roll Baker, who once played Jean
Harlow, for the role of Dorothy's
mother, so he must have intended
to say something about the destruc
tion of young sex goddesses. And
casting Mariel Hemingway, an
actress apparently incapable of
mannerism, seems exactly right,
ihu till I h:ic thp frt>sh athletic

prettiness she displayed in Personal
Best , and within the more stringent
limitations of this role, she is almost
as effective here.
She creates a powerful sympa
thetic focus for the movie: We care
so much about her character that
we feel a continual protective terror
for her. In the scene in which Paul
first makes a pass at her, she draws
back from him, apologizing for her
awkwardness and inexperience,
and explaining — using the
evidence of an uncomfortable one
night stand with an insensitive high
school football player — that she
doesn't think she's very good in
bed. It's a delicate, painful speech;
when she alludes to the ballplayer
her voice booms, out of embarrass
ment.
Hemingway makes Dorothy's
tendency to raise her voice when
she feels distressed a touching trait
which plays against her usual soft
ness and observant — often
agitated — quietude. And she
shows us the way this gentle west
ern Canadian kid acquires grace
and poise, and how her playfulness
takes on an almost insouciant sexi
ness when she lets loose.
But though Fosse is brilliant at
evoking the mood of corruption in
low dives, though the movie has a
compelling rhythm (partly due to
Alan Heim's sexy, collage-style
editing) and the Vancouver scenes
have a remarkable authenticity, the
movie never amounts to much — it
doesn't transcend its tabloid sen
sibility. Fosse's dialogue is so banal
(even predictable) that you begin to
wonder if he deliberately flattened
the movie out in order to underline
the sensationalism in the plot.
The potential for complexity
relies on the nature of the Playboy
mansion scenes, I think: If Dorothy
passes from the sleaziness of the
world of her sometime-pimp
boyfriend to a milieu that is flashier
but just as insidious, then Fosse has
built a case for an innocent young
woman caught in bigger and bigger
spider webs.
But Fosse's cynical energy deserts

him when he gets to Hugh Hefner
and his entourage. Perhaps the real
Hefner wouldn't allow a less than
flattering depiction of his empire,
but anyone who has read Playboy is
likely to find the benignity of these
scenes, in which Hefner and his
"family" seem so decent and sup
portive and solicitous for Dorothy's
welfare, a little hard to swallow.
(Cliff Robertson makes Hefner as
stuffy and stolid as a retired gen
eral; you keep wondering what's
wrong with this old fogey wander
ing around in his pajamas. If this
was planned as satire, it never gets

off the ground.) And so the single
threat to Dorothy's well-being is
her greasy, malevolent husband,
who takes over the movie.
In the scheme of Star 80, Paul
Snider is a nervous, aggressive
ne'er-do-well seduced by the
dream of becoming a celebrity —
not unlike Rupert Pupkin, the aspir
ing comedian Robert De Niro
played in Martin Scorsese's The
King of Comedy. (Fosse includes a
reference to Taxi Driver, perhaps to
indicate that he and Scorsese have
similar concerns.) And, like Scor
sese, he doesn't have much to say
about the implications of the
frustrated hopes of such second
raters, even though he found a mar

velous actor, Eric Roberts, to play
Snider.
I thought Roberts was extraordi
nary in Raggedy Man and on TV in
the American Short Story dramatiza
tion of "Paul's Case;" he is impres
sive as Snider, but the way Fosse
has conceived the role leaves little
room for subtlety. Snider moans
and suffers like the heroine of a
Hollywood melodrama of the 1930s
— like Norma Shearer or Joan
Crawford.
The odd flashback-flash forward
structure of this picture always

returns to Snider yelling curses over
Dorothy Stratten's bloody corpse,
as if Fosse guessed that the basest,
most lurid part of Dorothy's story
would hold the greatest (primal) in
terest for us. Fosse's cynicism has
always had a two-sided effect on his
talents — pointing them and cur
dling them. The fact that we watch a
movie like Star 80 with morbid fas
cination proves Fosse's case against
us, but we all lose when the result is
a kind of embittered superficiality.
Fosse doesn't do much, finally, with
his promising subject matter, but
he certainly knows how to make a
movie with a powerful surface.
Powerful enough to leave a bad
taste in your mouth.


FACES: Paul (Eric Roberts) desperately tries to hang on to Dorothy
Stratten's (Mariel Hemingway) rising star in Bob Fosse's "Star 80."
