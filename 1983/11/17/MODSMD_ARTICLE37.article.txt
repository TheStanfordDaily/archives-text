# Big Country lives up to all expectations

. . . In a big country dreams stay with
you/Like a lover's voice fires the moun
tainside/Stay alive . . .
A sold-out crowd at Wolfgang's in San
Francisco had absolutely no problem staying
alive last Saturday night, as Scotland's Big
Country brought their epic guitar anthems
to the United States tor the first time. On the
heels of their critically acclaimed debut al
bum The Crossing, the tour-man group
displayed adept showmanship to go along
with their sweeping, grand sound and com
pelling lyrics. The 80-minute show moved
along at a brisk pace, leaving the audience,
which included Greg kihn and Jefferson
Starship's Paul kantner, longing for a
preview of their next album.
Big Country is led by the twin guitar attack
of Stuart Adamson (formerly of the Skids)
and Bruce Watson. Their delicate, chiming
guitar solo harmonizing gave the music a
layered touch, and the guitars have a thin,
trebly sound almost like that of the bagpipes
of their native Scotland. The rhythm section,
comprised of Tony Butler on bass and Mark
Brzezicki on drums, provided the backdrop
for Pete Townsend's last two solo albums,
and the two showed considerable talent and
originality as members of this young group.
Butler's tasteful backing vocals, which in
corporated soft Scottish textures, compli
mented Adamson's stronger yet somewhat
limited vocal range. Brzezicki exhibited the
same highly competent and varied drum
work that graced Townsend's All Best Cow
boys Have Chinese Eyes LP, even managing
a quasi-Eastern sound on "The Storm."
When a one-album band plays in concert,
the audience is usually able to discern the
entire scope of a band performed live. This
can be good or bad. Big Country proved it to
be an advantageous quality through the use
of excellent pacing and interesting transi
tions. Adamson's playful rapport with the
crowd, albeit through a deceivingly thick

Scottish accent, contributed to the personal
feeling of the concert.
Highlights included "Close Action," with
its rolling rhythms; the evocative "Chance,"
which included a stirring audience participa
tion on the chorus, and an exciting rocker
called "fields ot Fire." Smokey Robinson's
"Tracks of My Tears' was covered, "in
Gaelic," joked Adamson, and rousing ver
sions of the group's hit, "In a Big Country,"
were played twice, once early in the show
and as the final encore.
The lyrics, credited to the group, reflect
the stifling conditions of their home remi
niscent of both U2 and The Jam, although
with more subtlety and ethereal presence,
and an occasional glimmer of hope.
Pull your head off the floor and come up
screaming/Cry out for everything you might
have wanted/I thought that pain and truth
were things that really mattered/You can't
stay here with every single hope you had
shattered.
Spoilsports might point out further
similarities to Ireland's U2, an intense and
idealistic band who are at the peak of their
popularity following the release of War ear
lier this year; both are produced by Steve
Lillywhite, both exhibit expansive music and
romanticism in their lyrics characteristics of
struggle, and both perform in concert with
exhilarating intensity and without over
wrought solemnity.
Big Country, however, singles itself out
with much more imaginative guitar work
and a greater inclination to deal with stories
rather than issues. Both have their merits,
but Big Country can stand on its own feet.
Although the intricate harmony between
the two heavily echoed guitars was occa
sionally lost in the mix, and Adamson's
echoed shouts came across as a bit gim
micky after four or five songs, the show was
virtually flawless. In this big and often musi
cally vacant country, the powerful and vi
brant dreams that Big Country unfurls on
vinyl and in concert are welcomed.
