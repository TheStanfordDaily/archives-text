# R.E.M. delivers high energy performance
## 
### LAURA HERNANDEZ MICHAEL RYAN 
The Day: Thursday, Nov. 10.
The Place: The Kabuki
The Weather: Stormy.
As we travelled to San Fran
cisco, the night seemed full of
the passion which R.E.M.
would later re-create for its au
dience. The Neats, a Boston
based group, opened the eve
ning to a favorable reaction,
and were quickly followed by
Let's Active, the Mitch Easter
creation. Performing every
song on their recently
released EP Afoot as well as
several new compositions,
this group was impressive.
Producing a danceable and in
fectious beat with songs like
"Every Word Means No" and
"Make Up With Me," Let's Ac
tive fulfilled the expectations
of an attentive audience.
"Ornamental," a slower,
melodic composition, showed
the diversity of the band while
giving a preview of their
forthcoming LP.
R.E.M. is an Athens, Ga.
group whose members are as
far removed from the B-52s as
you can get. Labelled as the
band "that matters," R.E.M.
concentrates on creating a
mood which is at least as im
portant as the actual lyrics.
Beginning their set with a
one-minute intro, "Welcome
to Our BBQ," the band went
straight into a crashing rendi
tion of "Moral Kiosk" and
"Catapault" off of their Mur
murs LP. The simplicity of
sparse lighting, composed of
blue, green and sometimes
white, removed any distance
between the band and the au
dience. "Boy, this place is
big," came from Michael, vo
cals, who seemed lost in the
relatively spacious Kabuki
Nightclub. This type of naivete
typified the band's reaction to

their recent gain in fame and
even suggested that they felt
this success was unimportant.
Their one and a half hour set
was composed of "old songs
and new songs," to quote Mi
chael again. "Waiting,"
"Camera" and "Setting Skies"
were new titles which carried
on the R.E.M. sound and
could have easily been in
cluded on Murmur. This ma
terial was slower, more in the
vein of "Perfect Circle" than
"Radio Free Europe." Towards
the end the concert did drag
as a result of the extended
melodies which had us wis
hing for a faster song.
On guitar, Peter delivered
unique strumming on
"Pilgrimage" and "Talk About
the Passion" which surpassed
the recorded versions. Bill,
drums, and Mike, bass, gave
strong reinforcements on vo
cals. The lead singer, Michael,
was energetic, sparking his
lyrics to life. The band was
cohesive, never faltering
musically.
R.E.M. left the stage first
after one hour of play, return
ing to do a 20-minute encore
which included a special ap
pearance by two members of
the Gang of Four on a rendi
tion of "Sweet Jane." Eric
Martin of the Neats was next
to join the band replacing Mi
chael on vocals. This ended
the first encore, only to be fol
lowed by another. R.E.M. fi
nally left the stage for the
night with "Carnival of Sorts
(BoxCars)" off of their Chronic
Town EP.
The power of R.E.M. lies in
their ability to deliver an atmo
sphere. In this way, the songs
achieve their intended
meaning. "Can you hear me?"
was a musical question asked
by the group in "Sitting Still."
On Nov. 10, the answer was
yes.
