# Bike ticketing rises as cops crack down on traffic violators
## 
### BOB BARCKLAY Staff writer 
Stanford police say they are
making a concerted effort to cite
bicyclists violating traffic laws, and
department statistics show that their
effort has b en a success.
More than 500 bicycle citations
were issued in October — three
times as many as in the same month
last year. Ol the 595 tickets given out
so far this year more than half were
issued last month.
Captain Marvin Moore, head of
the patrol division, said, "There is a
focused effort to try and deter
bicycle violations" — which, he
adds, "have always been a prob
lem."
According to Moore, the step-up
in enforcement depends on re
sources available to police. "Bike
enforcement is an ongoing thing,"
he said, "which depends on our
resource commitment. When we
have time to do. it, we do it. This
could go on for months."
Right now, he said, it is "given
higher priority because we have
more resources to devote to it."
Moore emphasized that the in
creased number of tickets was not a
result of a policy change or a
response to worsening traffic condi
tions. Instead, he said the depart
ment was confronting a continual
problem which it had previously not
had the resources to meet.
Moore also said there are always a
large number of tickets given early
in the year. The tickets have " more
of an impact at the start of the year.
You can always count on more en

torcement at the beginning of the
year and th< beginning of each
quarter."
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer,
who is not as closely connected with
traffic law enforcement, agreed that
police try harder to cite violaters
early in the year. One reason, he
said, is so that "freshmen will
realize that they must adhere to the
rules of the road."
The off-road motorcycle team is
another factor in the increased cita
tion rate, said Niemeyer, who des
cribed it as "very aggressive."
Whether or not the department's
efforts are having an effect on viola
tions is still unknown, according to
Moore. But there has been a reduc
tion in thre number of motorized
vehicles, such as mopeds, cited for
being in restricted areas on campus,
he said.
There are two types of violations.
The first — and the more expensive
of the two — is a moving violation.
This includes going through stop
signs and riding motorized vehicles
on bike paths. The other kind of
citation, which Moore called a "fix
it" violation, is issued to people
who ride without lights at night or
who have failed to register their
bicycle.
The fine for a moving violation is
$30 and most students pay it instead
of appearing in court to dispute the
citation.
Other violations such as riding
without a light or registration incur a
smaller fine and can be written off
by a police officer if taken care of.
