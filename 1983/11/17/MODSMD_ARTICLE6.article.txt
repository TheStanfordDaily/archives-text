# Bell rate hikes should not affect student phone bills immediately

### BAIE NETZER 
The expected rise in local phone
rates due to the impending breakup
of the Bell System will not have a
serious immediate impact on stu
dents' phone bills, according to Eco
nomics Prof, lames Rosse.
Over a period of "a couple of
years," however, phone bills for
those students who now pay more
than $20 will become lower while
bills for those who now pay less
than $20 will become higher, said
Rosse, who specializes in telecom
munications.
The Bell System's $153 billion
empire, consisting of American
Telephone and Telegraph and seven
regional telephone holding com
panies, will be dismantled on )an. 1

as the result of a 1980 antitrust suit
filed by the justice Department
against AT & T.
The rate hikes that would affect
Stanford students have been pro
posed by Pacific Bell (formerly
Pacific Telephone), but are yet to be
approved by the state Public Utilities
Commission (PUC), which is ex
pected to make its decision by April.
The proposed monthly rate in
creases most likely to affect students
are contained in the residence
premium (flat rate) service, which is
expected to rise from $7 to $14.25
and in the residence standard mea
sured service, which is expected to
rise from $i.75 to $7.50.
In addition, measured-rate calls
within eight miles will probably cost

4 cents rather than the current ?
cents for the first minute. Ihe rate
for calls from nine to 12 miles will
likely rise from 6 to 10 cents for the
first minute and thereafter be 5
cents for each additional minute.
And the charge for calls from 13 to
16 miles will increase from 8 to 13
cents for the first minute with a 7-
cent charge for each additional min
ute.
Discounts for calls placed after 5
p.m. and on weekends will stiil ap
ply.*
Rosse said that, despite the in
crease in local rates, the accompa
nying decrease in long-distance
rates should help to prevent serious
increases in students' bills and
