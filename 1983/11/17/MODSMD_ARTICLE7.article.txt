Israelis bomb guerrilla bases
Jerusalem — Israeli warplanes carried out their
second raid in less than two weeks yesterday behind
Syrian lines in eastern Lebanon, smashing bases of
two Shia Moslem militia groups that have been
linked to explosions at U.S., French and Israeli in
stallations in Lebanon.
The Israeli military command said the bases, in the
Bekaa Valley, served as a point from which
"terrorists belonging to Iranian-affiliated organiza
tions set out on offensive missions."
The communique added, "All our planes returned
safely to their bases. Pilots reported accurate hits on
the targets."
The Shia militias are suspected by Israeli and

Western intelligence services of participating in the
suicide car-bomb attacks on U.S. Marines and
French soldiers in Beirut and, later, on Israeli troops
in Tvre.
Although the military command did not specifi
cally connect yesterday's air action with the car
bomb attacks, an Israeli official remarked, "We are
acting for what has been done to us. If the Marines
or French were attacked from the same bases, so
much the better those bases were hit."
Israeli and American sources alike said that there
was no coordination between Washington and
Jerusalem on yesterday's air strike.
A few hours after the Israeli planes struck, the
newly appointed U.S. Special Envoy, Donald
Rumsfeld, arrived in lerusalem for his first visit to Is
rael. He conferred tor about an hour and a half with
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Neither Americans
nor Israelis disclosed any details of the talks.
The guerrilla bases attacked yesterday are
about 10 miles southwest of the town of Baal
bek in territory controlled by the Syrian
arrm less that five miles from the Syrian bor
der. The Israeli command said the bombers
carefully avoided hitting Syrian positions.
Military sources said that Iranian Revolu
tionary Guards, sent to Lebanon last year by
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, are sta
tioned in the area, along with pro-Iranian
Lebanese Shia militias known as Islamic Amal
and Party of God. Both militias praised the at
tacks on U.S., French and Israeli forces,
though neither took responsibility for them.
Feminist leader found inno-
Gretna, La. — A jury found California
feminist leader Ginny Foat innocent yester
day ot murdering an Argentine businessman
18 vears ago, rejecting as lies the testimony
by her ex-husband who had implicated her.
"Thank you, thank you, everyone," Foat,
42, to friends and supporters who
cheered in the packed state District Court
chamber as the jury returned its verdict after
less than two hours of deliberation.
The six-man, six-woman jury had gotten
the case after a plea from Foat's attorneys to
look on )ohn Sidote, her ex-husband and the
prosecution's star witness, as a "crazy man
and a liar."
Foat was charged with clubbing Argentine
toymaker Moises Chayo to death with a tire
iron in a New Orleans suburb in 1965 while

robbing him of $1400 cash.
Jurors said the verdict was unanimous for
acquittal on the first vote.
After the verdict was read, Foat was
mobbed by people from the audience offer
ing congratulations. Even members of the
jury approached her, some asking her to au
tograph placemats which they had picked up
at lunch.
"We covered all the angles. There was no
disagreement," juror Anna Marie Whited
said. "We voted. There was just one vote."
Defense lawyer John Reed told the jurors,
"You are a wonderful jury. You were just
great. This is why we have juries.'
When the verdict was announced, Foat
dropped her head to the table in relief, then
jumped up and started hugging her two at
torneys.
"You now have the rest of your life, the
rest of your life," said her 72-year-old mot
her, Virginia Galluzzo of New Paltz, N. Y.
"She is finally free, she is finally free," said
her sister Emilia Guigi, also of New Paltz.
Had the jury found her guilty of murder,
she could have been sentenced to life in
prison. A manslaughter verdict would have
brought a 21-year term.
Senate rejects tuition credits
Washington — The Senate, by a 59 to 38 vote
vesterday spurned President Reagan's call for
speedv enactment of tuition tax credits for
parents of private-school children.
Calling the vote "a sharp blow to tuition
tax credits," Sen. Robert Dole (R-kan), said
supporters would have to do a lot of work
and organizing before bringing up the matter
again.
He said he proposed the legislation at

Reagan's request. "It's a matter he had on his
must list," Dole told reporters atter the vote.
Hoping to leave town Friday tor a lengthy
recess, senators tabled a motion to add the
legislation to a minor Olympic games bill
when opponents threatened a filibuster
against it and the prospect of numerous
amendment's arose.
Dole, who introduced the amendment,
said Reagan "reaffirmed the strong commit
ment he's had for a long time, emphasizing
the importance of this on the president's
agenda.' He said Reagan especially wanted
the Senate to express itself on the issue this
year "because he made a pledge over a year
that we'd have a vote."
The credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction
from taxes owed, would start at a maximum
$100 for tuition paid for the 1983 school year,
rising to $200 in 1984 and $300 in 1985.
