Israelis bomb guerrilla bases
Jerusalem â€” Israeli warplanes carried out their
second raid in less than two weeks yesterday behind
Syrian lines in eastern Lebanon, smashing bases of
two Shia Moslem militia groups that have been

the targets."

suicide car-bomb attacks on U.S. Marines and
French soldiers in Beirut and, later, on Israeli troops
in Tvre.
Although the military command did not specifi

bomb attacks, an Israeli official remarked, "We are

or French were attacked from the same bases, so

Israeli and American sources alike said that there
