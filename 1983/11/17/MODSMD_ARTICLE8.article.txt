### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Three experts on nuclear policy agreed before a
packed kresge Auditorium audience last night that
arms control is the right goal, but they disagreed on the
way to accomplish it.
Stephen Band, a first secretary for politico-military af
fairs in the British Embassy; Dr. John Holdren, a profes
sor of energy and resources at UC-Berkeley; and Hil
mar Linnenkamp, a visiting scholar at the Institute for
East-West Security Studies who is on leave from the

West German Ministry of Defense, spoke at the forum,
which was called "The Role of Pershing Ms/Cruise
Missiles in the Security of the West.
Band defended the deployment of the Pershing II
and cruise missiles hy saying that one link in what he
termed the "chain of risk" had been broken in the mid
-1970s by the Soviet deployment of SS-20 missiles aimed
at Europe. This chain, he said, had previously

prevented the Soviets from contemplating an attack on
Europe, because such an attack would have led directly
to a U.S. strategic response on the Soviet Union with
intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Lack of a NATO counterforce to the SS-20s, he con
tinued, could lead the Soviets to believe an attack on
Europe would not lead to a U.S. response.
Holdren disagreed, saying, "Ihe fear we have noth
ing with which to respond is misplaced.' He noted
NATO's large bomber contingent could effectively

retaliate against the Soviets, and that "both sides have
tar more nuclear weapons than they need to perform
the only function of nuclear weapons, which he said
was to deter the other side from using them.
Linnenkamp, who did not talk directly on the so
called Euromissiles, advocated unilateral disarmament
by NATO forces as the key to arms control. "We rely on
mega-TNT-tonnage and call that security," he said.
