HLjfp-- r | was propelled and stabilized
" 1880, it cost Uncle Sam about $900.
Today's torpedoes can climb, dive, circle, and yes, run in a straight line. They have sophisti
cated propulsion systems, and each carries a computer which could compete with some of
industry's largest mainframes.
At the Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station, we test, evaluate, and maintain torpedoes
and a host of other sophisticated undersea weapons and control systems. We need motivated
Electronic Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Computer Scientists and Industrial Engineers.
We offer competitive compensation, excellent benefits, and the stability of a Federal Civil
Service Career in a rural environment just a stone's throw from fishing, hunting, skiing, and
Seattle's fine metropolitan atmosphere. A few positions are also available in San Diego and
Hawaii.
If you're looking for a challenging opportunity to work at the leading edge of state-of-the-art,
we're looking for you.
