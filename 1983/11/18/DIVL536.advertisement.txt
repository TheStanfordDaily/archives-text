you'll discover it in the delicate
seasoning of our soups ~ .in the
contrasting colors, flavors and
textures of the foods on your plate
. . . above all in the sublime
combinations of meat, poultry and
fisTi entrees with classic sauces.
Chef Eddie Bunnag's
masterful touch makes dining at
Savoir Fare a memorable
experience, and our moderate
