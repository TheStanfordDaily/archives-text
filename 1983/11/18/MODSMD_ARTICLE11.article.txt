## The 						Stanford Daily Rally around tradition 
### 
You started partying on the bus, just after
Gaieties ended. Maybe you had one too many
— after all, the traffic was pretty bad and there
was all that beer. But face it, you were having a
good time; running through the streets,
weaving in and out of the Band and rocking out
to the music. And maybe you did dance on top
of a few cars and break a couple bottles. But
c'mon — it's Big Came rally. And how were you
supposed to know that the guy you spilled
your beer on was a plainclothes cop?
So here you are spending Friday night in jail.
While this may sound implausible, it
shouldn't. San Francisco police officials are
serious about controlling this year's rally.
They've taken the old "safety in numbers"
adage and turned it on its head. The word is
that they will not be shy about — and may even
be quite willing to — make arrests when neces
sary. And this may mean a trip to the brig for
what seemed to you like innocent carousing.
Members of the Fiesta Committee, the stu
dent group that plans the rally, claim there will
be an entire police department tactical unit of 200
to 300 men plus 100 plainclothes policemen,
narcotics agents and a team of rally monitors —
Stanford fraternity members decked in special
T-shirts and green fluorescent hats — on the
scene.
Furthermore, city officials have substituted a
sedate, even boring jaunt along the Embar

cadero for the usual hilly, winding route
through residential areas. Instead of starting
atop Nob Hill, which is dotted with streetcar
construction, the Band will leave from Pier 35
and finish as usual at Aquatic Park — a much
shorter and straighter path.
Students can approach this situation in two
ways. They can get indignant, mutter some
thing about the city trying to ruin our good, clean
fun and go ahead and rally just like they have in
previous years, risking arrest and the future of
the rally. Or they can recognize the tense at
mosphere and give the city and the police offi
cers the respect they deserve.
Let's remember tonight, as we run, march,
parade and otherwise rally through the city,
that we are guests. When you think about it, it
does seem quite strange that every year Stan
ford students are allowed to literally run
frenzied through the streets. Once a year, we
take over — and that must be frightening to
both city officials and residents. One man's ral
ly may be another's riot.
But the most important reason to "be on our
best behavior" is for the future of the rally it
self. Big Came rally is tradition, so let's not
blow it. If we pass the test tonight, the rally, as
the culmination of a week-long series of pre
game fun, will survive. If not, we can only
blame ourselves.
