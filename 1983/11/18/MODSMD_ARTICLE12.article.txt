"They wouldn't push the button, would
they?"
"There's nothing we can really do about it
anyway. I'd rather not talk about it."
Fear. Outrage. Frustration. Despair.
Resigned apathy. So goes the usual progres
sion of emotions as each discovers, and then
tries to forget, the horror of nuclear war.
Sunday night, a national television network
will air a movie special that attempts to bring
the terror of nuclear holocaust into the bars,
the dorm lounges and the family rooms of
America.
ABC's "The Day After" is not the first movie to
describe a scenario of life after the nuclear
holocaust. But "The Day After" goes right to the
root of the fear: the effect of nuclear war on
middle America. Set in Kansas City, the movie
concerns real people, real houses and
churches, real families, real wounds. The
generals, the presidents, the rhetoric, even the
country that pushed the button — the movie
leaves all that ambiguous, effectively bringing
the problem down to the personal level.
There has been a lot of controversy concern
ing "The Day After." Conservatives such as
William F. Buckley and the Rev. Jerry Falwell
have criticized the film. Phyllis Schlafly has

been quoted in Newsweek as saying the film
"was made by people who want to disarm the
country." Psychiatrists protest that the film will
traumatize children. People are quoted as
saying it's ridiculous for ABC to try to scare the
American public out of its wits.
These objections miss the point. First of all,
is it wrong to be scared of nuclear war?
Second, if the American public is scared out of its
wits, it will at least be aware. Engagement is a
better alternative than anomie.
Of course, the hysteria which the movie may
generate may cost the anti-nuclear movement
credibility and is little better than apathy in
terms of effectiveness. But awareness spurs
people to address the larger questions, an ef
fort that an academic community such as this
one should support and pursue.
A late 1960s Life magazine special which pub
lished the photos of all the American soldiers
killed in Vietnam the month before publication
did more to mobilize the American people
against the Vietnam War than all the news
footage aired before the special. Some have
credited that Life special with being the begin
ning of the end of public support for that war.
If "The Day After" affects the public in a similar
way with regard to the nuclear arms race, it will
be worth the fallout.
