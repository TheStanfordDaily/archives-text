Code of truth
Philip Chalk, in his column,
"Living in a vacuum" (Daily, Nov.
15), was absolutely right. It is a
complicated world out there, and it
would certainly be easier for us to
deal with life if Stanford inculcated
us with a "comprehensive, consis
tent scaffolding of philosophical or
theological truths upon which to
arrange all knowledge in an orderly
fashion." As he so eloquently
pointed out, the idea has
"centuries of wisdom" backing it:
The Spanish Inquisition and the
Holocaust are but two examples in
Western culture of efforts to
promote an "explicitly consistent"
code of truth.
Such a code is clearly useful; in
modern times, President Reagan
has done an admirable job of sim
plifying U.S. foreign relations by
basing his behavior on a consistent
moralistic framework. Dividing the
world into the forces of Good and
Evil makes it much easier for him to
delegitimize the "know-it-alls" who
may not approve of his actions.
Before I read Chalk's article, I
had this bizarre notion that
philosophical truths were somehow
historically rooted, that what is
regarded as "wisdom" varies with
location and time, and is somehow
related to political and cultural
conditions. What's more, I actually
hadn't learned in completing my
major that "history can prove
anything," rather, I thought that
the point was that any theoretical
framework should be approached
critically and tested for its useful
ness against a complex reality.
I guess I've just been confused
by all these professors presenting
all these perspectives; it would

have been simpler just to learn one
theoretical model and a good set of
ethics, and to just forget all the
exceptions and contradictions. All
we need to do is decide on a
dogma, and Stanford could be
teaching us proper behavior in no
time.
And all this time I thought that I
had come to college to learn how
to think!

Fiesta committee
The Daily article, "San Francisco
imposes limits on Big game rally,"
(Nov. 11) did an excellent job of
reporting changes made in this
year's pre-Big Game festivities, and
for the rally in the City.
I'd like, however, to stress two
points raised in the article. First, the
rally in the City is a student-initiated
and student-managed happening.
The Fiesta Committee has worked
hard this year applying for a permit,
figuring out minimally disruptive
bus routes, recruiting student
monitors and raising the money for
a $1 million liability policy the City
required as a condition for granting
a parade permit.
Second, for all the work the
committee has done, Stanford
students, individually and col
lectively, will decide the success of
this year's rally, and whether the
rally in the city will ever happen
again. The police will make arrests
for vandalism and public drunken
ness. If they do so, Stanford stu
dents will not rally in the city next
year. Look out, then for your own
behavior, and that of your friends,
roommates and dormmates.

Though a rally in the city is a
student project, that does not me.
the University is unconcerned wit
what goes on. We care about you
the choices you make and the
things you do. Vou are our stu
dents, colleagues and friends. We
hate to see you spend Friday nigh:
in a one-room-suite for 50, or, far
worse, in a hospital emergency
room. Vour cooperation with the
police and parade monitors will
help you be where you want to be
this Friday night, and where we
want to be a year from Friday.

Present the facts
I must protest The Daily's treat
ment of my recent viewpoint on tl
Crenadian invasion. Although I
consulted closely with Daily
editors, substantial portions were
cut at the last minute without my
knowledge. The result was a "bre«
sandwich": strong rhetorical intro
duction and conclusion, with little
of the factual meat left in the cen
ter.
The Reagan administration lied
boldly and cynically in the Grenad
invasion. The lies became news or
page one and television throughoi
the country — including in The
Daily. The "corrections" trickled if
on page 15 of the New York Times
much later, when they were no
longer "news."
I believe parts of the media like
The Daily have an obligation to
present these facts to the Americai
people. I remain prepared to write
them up.
