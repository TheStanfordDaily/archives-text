# Amnesty International: humanitarians to stop torture
## 
### 
Earlier this year, heavily armed
men in civilian clothes, driving an
army jeep, abducted America
Yolanda Urizar of Guatemala. Her
abductors, naturally, are assumed to
be members of the Guatemalan
armed forces. Urizar has not been
heard of since her abduction, and
although the jeep used was later
seen parked in front of military
police headquarters, the govern
ment denies that she is in detention.
This may be true — she may have
been killed, and that is most likely
her fate in any case. Her crime was
giving legal advice to plantation
workers.
Halfway around the world in Eth
iopia, the Rev. Gudina Tumsa, the
leader of the Mekane Yesus Church
(of the Lutheran World Federation),
has still not been heard from since
his 1979 abduction. His wife, who
was abducted with him, was
released and then detained again in
1980. Their crime, in Marxist Eth
iopia, the Rev. Gudina Tumsa, the
Iran is even more forward in its
po Ii cy towards out-of-favor
religions: Being a Baha'i, for in
stance, is punishable by death. Of
course, Iran is currently the global
execution leader, averaging over
three official political executions a
day for four years. Among those ex
ecuted have been pregnant women
;ind children as young as 11, killings
which violate international law.
Many, if not most, political (which
include religious or ethnic)
prisoners are tortured. The methods
vary from simple beatings to the
buse of psychiatric institutes to
- ectric shock treatments. The geni
jls are a favorite target for all these
iothods — men will have their
genitals kicked, stepped on or elec
trically shocked, and women will al
most automatically be gang-raped
before being violated in other ways.
For both men and women, steriliza
tion is a common result of the
torture. Modern medicine has also
devised ways to keep the torturers'
victims alive and conscious much

longer than before possible, en
hancing the torturers' enjoyment
and the victims' agony.
There are no more than a few
dozen countries, however, in which
torture is the routine way the go
vernment treats its opponents, even
though most countries practice it.
Much more common are the gov
ernments which merely imprison
their dissidents, often in substan
dard but not outright torturous con
ditions. There are two approaches.
The most common is for the govern
ment to guarantee various in
alienable rights which it then
ignores, at least for political cases.
In Czechoslovakia, for instance,
prisoners must be charged within 48
hours — criminals generally are, po
litical prisoners aren't.
Naturally, all of this is in violation
of international agreements such as

the U.N. Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, the Standard Mini
mum Rules for the Treatment of
Prisoners (which applies to non
political prisoners as well), or the
Helsinki Final Act. Also, naturally
enough, international law isn't en-

Amnesty International's success in being
non-partisan is partly evidenced by the fact
that it is strongly criticized by human rights
violators of all stripes.

forced by the other members of the
international community, most of
who are themselves rights violators
anyway. Generally speaking, the
only organizations which try to hold
governments responsible for their
actions are private voluntary organi

zations.
The best known of these is Am
nesty International (Al), which won
the Nobel Peace Prize for its work.
Al works on behalf of human rights
in two main ways. The first of these
is through the Urgent Action Net-

work, where news of human rights
violations is sent to groups and indi
viduals around the world as soon as
each is confirmed. These people
then write telegrams and letters to
prison wardens, police chiefs, mini
stry officials, heads of state and em

bassies appealing for the release of
these "prisoners of conscience,"
who, by definition, have neither
used nor advocated violence. The
goal is to let the concerned officials
know that people around the world
are watching them, and to prevent,
hopefully, the mistreatment of the
prisoner.
The second way Al works for
these prisoners is through adoption
groups, who "adopt" two or more
prisoners of conscience. They then
work intensively on these prisoners'
behalf, repeatedly writing letters to
government and prison officials,
and arranging to send letters and
packages to the prisoners' families
and to the prisoners themselves.
The purpose here is to pressure the
government into releasing the pris
oner, and in the meantime to give
the prisoner and his family much

needed moral support. Here, espe
daily, Al's emphasis on the individ
ual human rights victim, a$ opposec
to just collecting statistics, is mos
obvious.
This humanitarian emphasis i?
unique among human rights organi
zations, and is one reason for Al':
excellent reputation as both
humanitarian and completely non
political. In fact, Al is always ex
tremely careful to insure its non
partisan basis, and oi !y criticize?
specific human rights violations,
never governments or political
philosophies. Al's success in being
non-partisan is partly evidenced by
the fact that it is strongly criticized
by human rights violators of all
stripes: The president of Peru
recently called Al "insolent and full
of fools," the Soviet Union attacks
Al's "bourgeois conception" of
human rights, and one South
African official, just before releasing
a prisoner of conscience, called Al a
"social scourge." Obviously, Al has
touched a nerve.
I his last-mentioned incident with
the South African official points out
one final thing about Al: It works.
Not always, of course, but often
enough to be both important and
worthwhile. It works first of all by
telling governments that they are
being watched by people across the
world, thereby imposing a political
cost on their actions, and secondly
by reminding local officials of their
moral responsibilities — something
their superiors try to repress.
It takes only 10 or 15 minutes to
help out with a letter — something
even the busiest student can spare.
To get started, call Al's San Fran
cisco office or me. Those of us lucky
enough to live in a country where
human rights violations are not a
problem are the people most
needed in the fight against these vi
olations.
