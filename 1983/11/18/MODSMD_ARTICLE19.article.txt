## Stanford: 'Cal will pay for The Play' Cardinal tries to 'Win one for the Wig' 
### ADAM BERNS The Play 
One year has gone by since the Big
Game last year, yet no discussion of the
86th meeting between UC-Berkeley and
Stanford can begin without first mention
ing last season's football game, the 25-20
Cardinal loss and its crazy ending.
Although one season has passed since
that day in Memorial Coliseum, that game
will forever be remembered as one of the
strangest games ever played. Discussion
of it dominated virtually every news con
ference and pre-game social affair this
past week.
This year's Big Game will also be Paul
Wiggin's last game as Stanford's head
football coach as Wiggin announced his
resignation late last week.
While Cal and Stanford have only five
wins between them (the Bears are 4-5-1
while the Cardinal is 1-9), both teams
view the game as extremely important.
Winning the game for Cal would even up
its record and give them a non-losing
season while for Stanford, a victory would
at least end its disappointing season on a
winning note, give the Cardinal revenge
for last year, and send Wiggin out on a
happy note.
Cal Coach joe Kapp said at a news con
ference earlier in the week that this game
meant as much as a bowl to his team. "It's
a bowl game for us," he said.
Like everyone else, Kapp realized that
neither team was going anywhere, but to
him it didn't matter. "It's against Stan
ford," he said, as if that said it all. "I ex
pect that it will be a great game, deciding
I don't know what."
For Wiggin, the game is no less impor
tant. "It means a whole lot to me per
sonally," he said. "It means an awful lot
to the players. It (the game) is one of the
most hard fought rivalries ever. I don't
think anything represents the kind of
emotion that this game represents."
Bob Murphy, Stanford commentator
for KSFO, pointed out at a Guardsman

Club luncheon on Wednesday that Cal
and Stanford are two .schools similar in
their academic achievement.
The two schools are also similar on the
offensive side of the football. Both teams
rely on passing; quarterback Gale Gilbert
is expected to start for Cal, despite sus
taining a shoulder injury against Washing
ton State last weekend.
The Bears are currently eighth national
ly in passing offense and first in the
Pacific-10 Conference, averaging 279.6
yards per game. Gilbert is the clear offen
sive leader, and his loss in last week's
contest was probably responsible for the
Bears' lowest passing output total of the
season, 166 yards, as J. Torchio came in to
replace him.
"He (Gilbert) is a good football player,"
Wiggin said about the Cal quarterback.
"He is the focal point of what they do.
They have a sophisticated passing game
and they throw to their tight end a lot."
The Bears started the year with All-
America candidate David Lewis at the
tight end spot, but because of his injury
earlier in the season freshman Don Noble
has stepped in and according to Kapp has
done an excellent job in Lewis' place. He
has caught 23 passes for 288 yards and
one touchdown.
Stanford's passing offense is ranked
second in the Pac-10 and No. 14 nationally
with a 249.9 average per game. Freshman
quarterback John Paye will play in his first
Big Game this year, but Wiggin does not
feel that pressure will be a major problem
for him.
"He (Paye) has probably been to more
Big Games than I have," Wiggin said
about the Atherton resident. "It will be
interesting to see how he responds. This
will be the ultimate test for him."
On the ground, the Bears have not
been nearly as successful with only 544
total rushing yards, junior Ron Story leads
the Cal rushing attack with 351 yards on
104 attempts.
Junior halfback Shaun Avant and fresh

man fullback Marshall Dillard are sched
uled to start in the Stanford backfield to
morrow. Avant is second on the team in
rushing with 165 yards in 40 carries. Dil
lard, who did not play a single down until
the Oregon State game (three games ago)
is third on the team in rushing with 133
yards in 32 carries.
Defensively, thp Bears are led by
linebacker Ron Rivera, an All-America
candidate who Wiggin feels could be the
best linebacker in the nation.
"No question, the key to their defense
is Rivera," Wiggin said. "I feel that he
does more for them (Cal) than any one
man does for any defense in the country.
When I got my Lombardi Award ballot (an
award given to the best defensive player
in the nation), I voted for Ron Rivera. It
wasn't easy for me to vote for a Cal man."
For the season, Rivera has been in on
130 tackles and 73 solos, along with 25
tackles behind the line of scrimmage. The
most dramatic came in Cal's opening day
win over Texas A & M when Rivera nailed
Aggie Jimmie Hawkins for a safety with 57
seconds left to give the Bears a dramatic
victory.
Stanford's defensive strength has been
its pass coverage which should be severe
ly tested by the Bears tomorrow. The Car
dinal comes into the game ranked No. 21
in the nation against the pass, giving up
157.8 yards per game.
Game notes:
Cal placekicker Randy Pratt has con
nected on 20-of-24 field goals this year.
He kicked a 54-yarder against UCLA ear
lier this season.
The top two receivers for the Golden
Bears are senior Andy Bark with 41
catches for 623 yards and two touch
downs and Ranee McDougald with 38
receptions for 711 and five touchdowns.
The first game between Stanford and
Cal at Stanford Stadium was on Novem
ber 19, 1921. Cal won that game 42-7. At


UC-Berkeley's kickoff return for a touchdown (above) in the final play of last year's Big Game incited
numerous controversies. The above picture shows one official signaling the play dead (circle) while Cal's
Kevin Moen is running into the Cardinal end zone through a corridor of Stanford Band members. The Cal
touchdown was scored with no time left on the clock and came after Stanford place kicker Mark Harmon

booted a field goal to put Stanford ahead 20-19 with 0:04 left in the game. But Cal's kickoff return for a
touchdown, now known simply as "The Play," was ruled good by the officials, giving the Bears a 25-20 vic
tory (right).
Stanford Stadium, the Car
dinal holds a 15-13-1 advan
tage.

The last time the two teams
played at Stanford Stadium,
the Cardinal scored a 42-21
victory.
The Cardinal injury report:
Stanford defensive end Garin
Veris has a strained stomach

muscle but is expected to
play. Tolliver has a hip
pointer, linebacker Matt Sol
derland has a sprained right
ankle and running back Kevin
Scott has a bruised right
shoulder.

earlier in the season freshman Don Noble
has stepped in and according to Kapp has
done an excellent job in Lewis' place. He
has caught 23 passes for 288 yards and
one touchdown.
Stanford's passing offense is ranked
second in the Pac-10 and No. 14 nationally
with a 249.9 average per game. Freshman
quarterback John Paye will play in his first
Big Game this year, but Wiggin does not
feel that pressure will be a major problem
for him.
"He (Paye) has probably been to more
Big Games than I have," Wiggin said
about the Atherton resident. "It will be
interesting to see how he responds. This
will be the ultimate test for him."
On the ground, the Bears have not
been nearly as successful with only 544
total rushing yards, junior Ron Story leads
the Cal rushing attack with 351 yards on
104 attempts.
Junior halfback Shaun Avant and fresh

man fullback Marshall Dillard are sched
uled to start in the Stanford backfield to
morrow. Avant is second on the team in
rushing with 165 yards in 40 carries. Dil
lard, who did not play a single down until
the Oregon State game (three games ago)
is third on the team in rushing with 133
yards in 32 carries.
Defensively, thp Bears are led by
linebacker Ron Rivera, an All-America
candidate who Wiggin feels could be the
best linebacker in the nation.
"No question, the key to their defense
is Rivera," Wiggin said. "I feel that he
does more for them (Cal) than any one
man does for any defense in the country.
When I got my Lombardi Award ballot (an
award given to the best defensive player
in the nation), I voted for Ron Rivera. It
wasn't easy for me to vote for a Cal man."
For the season, Rivera has been in on
130 tackles and 73 solos, along with 25
tackles behind the line of scrimmage. The
most dramatic came in Cal's opening day
win over Texas A & M when Rivera nailed
Aggie Jimmie Hawkins for a safety with 57
seconds left to give the Bears a dramatic
victory.
Stanford's defensive strength has been
its pass coverage which should be severe
ly tested by the Bears tomorrow. The Car
dinal comes into the game ranked No. 21
in the nation against the pass, giving up
157.8 yards per game.
Game notes:
Cal placekicker Randy Pratt has con
nected on 20-of-24 field goals this year.
He kicked a 54-yarder against UCLA ear
lier this season.
The top two receivers for the Golden
Bears are senior Andy Bark with 41
catches for 623 yards and two touch
downs and Ranee McDougald with 38
receptions for 711 and five touchdowns.
The first game between Stanford and
Cal at Stanford Stadium was on Novem
ber 19, 1921. Cal won that game 42-7. At


UC-Berkeley's kickoff return for a touchdown (above) in the final play of last year's Big Game incited
numerous controversies. The above picture shows one official signaling the play dead (circle) while Cal's
Kevin Moen is running into the Cardinal end zone through a corridor of Stanford Band members. The Cal
touchdown was scored with no time left on the clock and came after Stanford place kicker Mark Harmon

booted a field goal to put Stanford ahead 20-19 with 0:04 left in the game. But Cal's kickoff return for a
touchdown, now known simply as "The Play," was ruled good by the officials, giving the Bears a 25-20 vic
tory (right).
Stanford Stadium, the Car
dinal holds a 15-13-1 advan
tage.

The last time the two teams
played at Stanford Stadium,
the Cardinal scored a 42-21
victory.
The Cardinal injury report:
Stanford defensive end Garin
Veris has a strained stomach

muscle but is expected to
play. Tolliver has a hip
pointer, linebacker Matt Sol
derland has a sprained right
ankle and running back Kevin
Scott has a bruised right
shoulder.
One year has gone by since the Big
Game last year, yet no discussion of the
86th meeting between UC-Berkeley and
Stanford can begin without first mention
ing last season's football game, the 25-20
Cardinal loss and its crazy ending.
Although one season has passed since
that day in Memorial Coliseum, that game
will forever be remembered as one of the
strangest games ever played. Discussion
of it dominated virtually every news con
ference and pre-game social affair this
past week.
This year's Big Game will also be Paul
Wiggin's last game as Stanford's head
football coach as Wiggin announced his
resignation late last week.
While Cal and Stanford have only five
wins between them (the Bears are 4-5-1
while the Cardinal is 1-9), both teams
view the game as extremely important.
Winning the game for Cal would even up
its record and give them a non-losing
season while for Stanford, a victory would
at least end its disappointing season on a
winning note, give the Cardinal revenge
for last year, and send Wiggin out on a
happy note.
Cal Coach joe Kapp said at a news con
ference earlier in the week that this game
meant as much as a bowl to his team. "It's
a bowl game for us," he said.
Like everyone else, Kapp realized that
neither team was going anywhere, but to
him it didn't matter. "It's against Stan
ford," he said, as if that said it all. "I ex
pect that it will be a great game, deciding
I don't know what."
For Wiggin, the game is no less impor
tant. "It means a whole lot to me per
sonally," he said. "It means an awful lot
to the players. It (the game) is one of the
most hard fought rivalries ever. I don't
think anything represents the kind of
emotion that this game represents."
Bob Murphy, Stanford commentator
for KSFO, pointed out at a Guardsman

Club luncheon on Wednesday that Cal
and Stanford are two .schools similar in
their academic achievement.
The two schools are also similar on the
offensive side of the football. Both teams
rely on passing; quarterback Gale Gilbert
is expected to start for Cal, despite sus
taining a shoulder injury against Washing
ton State last weekend.
The Bears are currently eighth national
ly in passing offense and first in the
Pacific-10 Conference, averaging 279.6
yards per game. Gilbert is the clear offen
sive leader, and his loss in last week's
contest was probably responsible for the
Bears' lowest passing output total of the
season, 166 yards, as J. Torchio came in to
replace him.
"He (Gilbert) is a good football player,"
Wiggin said about the Cal quarterback.
"He is the focal point of what they do.
They have a sophisticated passing game
and they throw to their tight end a lot."
The Bears started the year with All-
America candidate David Lewis at the
tight end spot, but because of his injury
