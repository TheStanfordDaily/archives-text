# LAC to close; services to shift
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
The Learning Assistance Center,
which just discovered that it will be
dissolved after spring 1984, has
learned a hard lesson about bureau
cracy.
A letter to the LAC office Monday
from Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells ex
plained that the center would be
eliminated and its various services
reassigned to other areas of the Uni
versity.
According to Wessells, this
redistribution will have no ultimate
effect on the services of the LAC,
just on the administrative locus.
"Our main intent was not to do
away with any programs — we'll cer
tainly make sure they are housed ap
propriately," he said. "The same
courses will be taught next year. I
don't see where the student is par
ticularly aware of the administrator
of the course . . . and that's how it
boils down.
"We're just removing the admin
istration, not the services."
Some students and faculty,
however, are concerned that the
tutoring and counseling services
and study skills courses will eventu
ally disappear if they move to new
homes.
James Cibbs, professor of anthro
pology and former dean of under
graduate studies, said he thinks that
a dispersion of the LAC's programs
would mean an eventual elimination
of services.
• "There is a significant number of
students who benefit from the
LAC," Cibbs said. "I'm not con
vinced that other departments will
give LAC programs the same loving
care that they get at LAC. The center
was created because the need for
study skills courses wasn't filled
elsewhere, and now there will be
the same need."
At present, the LAC offers five dif
ferent types of services: an under
graduate program, a graduate pro
gram, a staff development program,

a law school program and a summer
program.
The proposed decentralization of
LAC services would involve moving
the writing component to the fresh
man program in the English Depart
ment, placing the peer counseling
servicr- in the Office of Student Af
fairs, and relocating the tutoring
services in the Center for Teaching
and Learning.
LAC tutor Eric Janis said he feels
that moving tutoring services to the
Center for Teaching and Learning
would make the services less acces
sible to undergraduates.
"The thing is, I never heard of CTL
until I found out tutoring would be
moved there. And they aren't plan
ning to offer any tutor training
courses there."
He explained that at present the
LAC requires potential tutors to take
training courses for credit to
acquire appropriate teaching skills
and that not having the course
would definitely affect the quality of
student tutors.
lanis also sair' ' fv' Hto under
stand how learning skills courses fell
under the jurisdiction of freshman
English. "There is no way these
courses could be taught by the En
glish Department," he said, "and
the learning skills courses are inval
uable."
The beginning of the end of the
LAC occurred during fall quarter
1982. The Office of the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies was disbanded
and control over the LAC was
moved from that office to the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
A recent report from the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies (C
-US) explains that in spring 1982 Wes
sells asked for "a review of the aca
demic merit of the courses offered
by the LAC and an opinion on the
long-term viability of the program."
This review was culminated with
the submission of a report to Wes
sells and C-US suggesting that the
LAC be strengthened or decen
tralized.
