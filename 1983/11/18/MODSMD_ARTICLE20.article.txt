# UCLA crushes Stanford spikers
## 
### TOM MOORE 
Playing before a hostile Los
Angeles crowd last night, the
Stanford women's volleyball
team succumbed to the No. 3
ranked UCLA Bruins for the
third time this year.
UCLA repeatedly called
upon its superior outside hit
ting to stifle the Cardinal at
tack, relying on outstanding
performances from seniors
Patty Orozco and Liz
Makayan.
The five-set thriller opened
with Stanford taking the first
game 17-15 in a real squeaker.
UCLA roared back to take the
lead 2-1 on the strength of 15-
11 and 15-7 victories, and it ap
peared that the Cardinal had
lost its chance at the confer
ence championship.
Behind 13-6 in the final con
test, UCLA clawed back with
the help of key blocks by
Merja Connolly. The Bruins
then went on to a 17-15 deci
sion, clinching the WCAA
Conference championship.
Stanford will remain in
Southern California to face the
conference weak sister, Cal-
State Fullerton tonight.
