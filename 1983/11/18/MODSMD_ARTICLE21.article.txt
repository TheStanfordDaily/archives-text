# Stanford's the underdog in tomorrow's Big Splash

### ROB ZWEIG 
"It's not really just a game."
So said Stanford freshman Chris
Thompson in capsulizing the players'
feelings about the "Big Splash," the water
polo match held the morning before the an
nual Stanford-UC-Berkeley football game.
Thompson ought to know too. Last year
he was heavily recruited by the Bears to fol
low in his older brother's footsteps at Cal.
But the Cardinal forward is not the only
team member who is familiar with California
and relishes a season-ending victory over
the Bears.
"These guys all know each other," Stan
ford Head Coach Dante Dettamanti said
while explaining the relationship between
the two Bay Area schools. "They've played
against each other in high school. We know
Cal better than anyone else in the country."
Even the freshmen, newcomers to the
spirit of Big Game weekend, have been
caught up in the "Beat Cal" fever. "For
some reason it's caught on," David Imber
nino said. "We've played with a few of these

guys so we'd love to beat them.''
In the past, the Stanford-Cal water polo
matchups have proven every bit as dramatic
as the games in Stanford Stadium and often
have pitted the top two teams in the nation
against each other. In the 1978 Big Splash,
Stanford All-American Doug Burke skipped
in a goal as the final horn sounded to clinch
the Card's fourth straight Pacific-10 Confer
ence title.
Later that year the Bears nearly got some
sweet revenge in the NCAA championship
match, but a seventh period, sudden death
score gave Stanford its second national title.
Dettamanti, in his seventh season as the
Stanford mentor, understands the intensity
of this college rivalry.
"It's not a hate rivalry and there's never
been any bad blood between the two teams.
You respect the guys on the other team, but
you just want to kick their butts."
For California though, 1983 offers a
unique chance to make up for years of
frustation. Over the past eight years Stan
ford has dominated the head-to-head

Craig Klass and the rest of the Stanford men's water polo team take on UC-Berkeley to
morrow at 10:30 a.m. at DeGuerre Pool in the annual Big Splash. Cal is the favorite to
morrow, as the Bears are headed to the NCAA tournament while Stanford is not.
