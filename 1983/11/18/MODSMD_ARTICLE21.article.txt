# Stanford's the underdog in tomorrow's Big Splash

### ROB ZWEIG 
"It's not really just a game."
So said Stanford freshman Chris
Thompson in capsulizing the players'
feelings about the "Big Splash," the water
polo match held the morning before the an
nual Stanford-UC-Berkeley football game.
Thompson ought to know too. Last year
he was heavily recruited by the Bears to fol
low in his older brother's footsteps at Cal.
But the Cardinal forward is not the only
team member who is familiar with California
and relishes a season-ending victory over
the Bears.
"These guys all know each other," Stan
ford Head Coach Dante Dettamanti said
while explaining the relationship between
the two Bay Area schools. "They've played
against each other in high school. We know
Cal better than anyone else in the country."
Even the freshmen, newcomers to the
spirit of Big Game weekend, have been
caught up in the "Beat Cal" fever. "For
some reason it's caught on," David Imber
nino said. "We've played with a few of these

guys so we'd love to beat them.''
In the past, the Stanford-Cal water polo
matchups have proven every bit as dramatic
as the games in Stanford Stadium and often
have pitted the top two teams in the nation
against each other. In the 1978 Big Splash,
Stanford All-American Doug Burke skipped
in a goal as the final horn sounded to clinch
the Card's fourth straight Pacific-10 Confer
ence title.
Later that year the Bears nearly got some
sweet revenge in the NCAA championship
match, but a seventh period, sudden death
score gave Stanford its second national title.
Dettamanti, in his seventh season as the
Stanford mentor, understands the intensity
of this college rivalry.
"It's not a hate rivalry and there's never
been any bad blood between the two teams.
You respect the guys on the other team, but
you just want to kick their butts."
For California though, 1983 offers a
unique chance to make up for years of
frustation. Over the past eight years Stan
ford has dominated the head-to-head

Craig Klass and the rest of the Stanford men's water polo team take on UC-Berkeley to
morrow at 10:30 a.m. at DeGuerre Pool in the annual Big Splash. Cal is the favorite to
morrow, as the Bears are headed to the NCAA tournament while Stanford is not.
meetings with a 22-9-3 mark. Futhermore,
Cal has yet to beat the Cardinal in DeGuerre
Pool.
This year Cal is 25-3-2 and rests comfortab
ly atop the national rankings. Meanwhile,
the Card is in danger of suffering its first
losing season in 11 years. Stanford is 11-12-3
and 0-5 in the Pac-10, including a 9-6 loss to
Cal in Berkeley last Saturday.
The Bears' balanced scoring attack is led
by junior forward Alan Cresham who is "the
fastest guy in the nation," according to Det
tamanti, and possesses a shot to match his
speed. He spurred the Cal victory with three
scores last week and tops the Bears scoring
list with 45 goals.
Next in line are senior joe Gorek who has
tallied 25 times and freshman hole man
Steve Campbell who has added 24.
It was the balanced scoring and a deep
bench that greatly contributed to Cal's win
last week — a win that handed Stanford its
fifth consecutive loss. Dettamanti has
reached into his bag of tricks in an attempt
to counter the power of the nation's No. 1
team.
"We're going to move Jaime Velez and
(Grant) Stanley, our two smaller guys, out of

the starting unit and move (Mark) Daley and
(Chris) Woolfolk out of the second unit" to
match up better against Cal's platooning
system, he said.
Dettamanti believes the change will give
the Cardinal a bigger starting lineup against
the Bears' muscular first team. He added
that Stanford's "second group will be a real
ly fast unit and a good driving group with ail
of our slimy, slippery, short, quick guys."
While the Stanford coach has tinkered
with his offense he will hand senior goalie
Martin Fisher the responsibility of stopping
the NCAA-bound blue and gold from
Berkeley. The Reedley, Calif, native will suit
up for the last time tomorrow — the only
Card graduating this year — after toiling in
the shadow of All-Americans Vince Vanelli
in 1980 and junior Steve Moyer the past two
seasons.
This year Fisher shared the starting duties
with Moyer for much of the campaign, ex
hibiting the gritty determination and gam
bling goalkeeping that makes him what Det
tamanti calls "a real gamer."
In a rivalry such as Stanford and Cal s, it is
often the "real gamers" who rise to the oc
casion and produce the upsets that make
college sports so exciting. For the first time
since 1973 Stanford is not making the trip to
the national championships. But that fact
does not make this year's Big Splash just an
other game.
