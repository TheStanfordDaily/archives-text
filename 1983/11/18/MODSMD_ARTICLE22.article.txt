## California 25, Stanford 20 
### SID SPAETH 
Berkeley, Nov. 22, 1982 —
California captured the 85th
and best Big Came Saturday
with a chaotic and controver
sial 57-yard kickoff return that
never could have happened,
but did.
Cal used five laterals on the
return before defensive back
Kevin Moen took the blind
final pitch and crashed 25
yards through the Stanford
band and into the end zone
for the 25-20 win.
Moments later the officials
ruled it a touchdown and Cal
fans poured onto the field, en
gulfing the Bear players and
replacing the Stanford fans,
players and band, many of
whom were on the field
prematurely.
Mark Harmon had seeming
ly won the game for Stanford
with a 35-yard field goal with
eight seconds remaining. The
field goal was set up by a final
minute John Elway-led drive.
Stanford stood at fourth
and-17 from their own 13-yard
line with 58 seconds remain
ing. Elway stood in his pocket
that gave him all the time he
needed to hit Emile Harry with
a 29-yard bullet upfield.
The drive eventually led to
Harmon's dramatic field goal
and the Stanford bench piled
onto the field, drawing a 15-
yard unsportsmanlike conduct
penalty.
Harmon then kicked off
from the Stanford 25-yard line
to set in motion one of the
most bizarre episodes to ever

occur on an American football
field.
Harmon's squib kick was
fielded by Moen at the Cal 43-
yard line. Moen was immedi
ately covered and he pitched
back to Richard Rodgers near
midfield.
Rodgers, who also found
nowhere to run, was hit but
lateralled to Dwight Garner.
Garner was swarmed by Stan
ford defenders and driven
backwards. Two players
charged onto the field from
Stanford's bench to celebrate
and were followed by the
Stanford band. Penalty flags
flew as the field was flooded
with scrambling people.
Suddenly the ball squirted
from Garner's arms back to
Rodgers.
"I swear, my knee never hit
the ground," Garner said. "I
was just about to fall, and then
I saw Rodgers. I remember
him saying in the huddle,
'Don't fall with the hall.' "
Rodgers rambled upfield
toward the Stanford band and
the bath of confusion at that
end of the field before pitch
ing the ball to Mariet Ford who
headed for the right sideline.
Ford raced to the 20-yard
line where he blindly flipped
the ball backwards over his
head. Moen was there to catch
the pass and he charged
through the band and into the
end zone.
"We knew we had to keep
the ball alive," said Moen,
who along with Rodgers, was a
veer quarterback in high

school. "I saw maybe o
white jersey and just tuck
the ball away. I wan't going
stop for the band. I was gon
score."
"There were so ma
people on the field I didn't s
any Stanford players, Rodgt
said. "I don't think they knt
what was going on."
The officials huddled on tl
field and moments later si
nailed touchdown.
Stanford players argued th
an official had called the pi
dead at midfield.
"I saw one official do th
implying he was down," sa
noseguard Terry jackso
moving his arms back-an
forth like a baseball umpi
signalling safe. "Then Isa

was going on.

with some wild things in hij
school games, but th
outdoes them all. It's hard f<
me to take. I would feel bett
if they would have beaten 01
kickoff team fair-and-squar
not this Mickev Mouse stuff.
Referee Charles Moffett,
a taped response to reporte
questions, said, "We check*
that. Nobody thought hew.
down at any time."
Moffett also explained th
the penalty flags were throw
because of the Stanfor
players on the field and th
they could have penalized th
Stanford band also.

Berkeley, Nov. 22, 1982 —
California captured the 85th
and best Big Came Saturday
with a chaotic and controver
sial 57-yard kickoff return that
never could have happened,
but did.
Cal used five laterals on the
return before defensive back
Kevin Moen took the blind
final pitch and crashed 25
yards through the Stanford
band and into the end zone
for the 25-20 win.
Moments later the officials
ruled it a touchdown and Cal
fans poured onto the field, en
gulfing the Bear players and
replacing the Stanford fans,
players and band, many of
whom were on the field
prematurely.
Mark Harmon had seeming
ly won the game for Stanford
with a 35-yard field goal with
eight seconds remaining. The
field goal was set up by a final
minute John Elway-led drive.
Stanford stood at fourth
and-17 from their own 13-yard
line with 58 seconds remain
ing. Elway stood in his pocket
that gave him all the time he
needed to hit Emile Harry with
a 29-yard bullet upfield.
The drive eventually led to
Harmon's dramatic field goal
and the Stanford bench piled
onto the field, drawing a 15-
yard unsportsmanlike conduct
penalty.
Harmon then kicked off
from the Stanford 25-yard line
to set in motion one of the
most bizarre episodes to ever

occur on an American football
field.
Harmon's squib kick was
fielded by Moen at the Cal 43-
yard line. Moen was immedi
ately covered and he pitched
back to Richard Rodgers near
midfield.
Rodgers, who also found
nowhere to run, was hit but
lateralled to Dwight Garner.
Garner was swarmed by Stan
ford defenders and driven
backwards. Two players
charged onto the field from
Stanford's bench to celebrate
and were followed by the
Stanford band. Penalty flags
flew as the field was flooded
with scrambling people.
Suddenly the ball squirted
from Garner's arms back to
Rodgers.
"I swear, my knee never hit
the ground," Garner said. "I
was just about to fall, and then
I saw Rodgers. I remember
him saying in the huddle,
'Don't fall with the hall.' "
Rodgers rambled upfield
toward the Stanford band and
the bath of confusion at that
end of the field before pitch
ing the ball to Mariet Ford who
headed for the right sideline.
Ford raced to the 20-yard
line where he blindly flipped
the ball backwards over his
head. Moen was there to catch
the pass and he charged
through the band and into the
end zone.
"We knew we had to keep
the ball alive," said Moen,
who along with Rodgers, was a
veer quarterback in high

school. "I saw maybe o
white jersey and just tuck
the ball away. I wan't going
stop for the band. I was gon
score."
"There were so ma
people on the field I didn't s
any Stanford players, Rodgt
said. "I don't think they knt
what was going on."
The officials huddled on tl
field and moments later si
nailed touchdown.
Stanford players argued th
an official had called the pi
dead at midfield.
"I saw one official do th
implying he was down," sa
noseguard Terry jackso
moving his arms back-an
forth like a baseball umpi
signalling safe. "Then Isa
this guy running with the ba
I didn't know what the ht
was going on.
"They robbed us of our vi
tory. I have been involve
with some wild things in hij
school games, but th
outdoes them all. It's hard f<
me to take. I would feel bett
if they would have beaten 01
kickoff team fair-and-squar
not this Mickev Mouse stuff.
Referee Charles Moffett,
a taped response to reporte
questions, said, "We check*
that. Nobody thought hew.
down at any time."
Moffett also explained th
the penalty flags were throw
because of the Stanfor
players on the field and th
they could have penalized th
Stanford band also.
