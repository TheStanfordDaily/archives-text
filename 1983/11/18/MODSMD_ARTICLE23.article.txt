## Wiggin is a winner off the football field 
### ADAM BERNS 
Stanford football Coach Paul
Wiggin is a winner.
Win or lose Big Game, it
doesn't matter. Wiggin is a win
ner in life.
In the past few weeks, he's
heard, probably more than he
would ever like to have heard,
what a nice guy he is. As Wiggin
himself admitted earlier this
week, he didn't come here to be
a "nice guy." He came here to
win football games.
Things didn't work out.
It's often said that people show
their true colors when they are
under duress. When things are
going well, it's easy to be well
liked, to keep one's cool and to
show one's best side. But when
things go poorly, it's easy to turn
from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde.
Wiggin, however, has not
changed.
Through it all, he has remained
the same — honest and sincere,
almost to the point where it
hurts. Unlike some coaches,
Wiggin does not hide himself
well. He's forthright, and says
what he feels.
He'd be the first one to accept
responsibility for what happened
in his tenure at Stanford. Unlike
some coaches, Wiggin has never
bad-mouthed a player in public.
As Wiggin himself would put it,
he treats the football team like an
extended family — a metaphor

he often uses. The reasons why
Wiggin was not successful as a
football coach at Stanford really
aren't significant.
At some other time, his record
would not really have mattered.
Amateur athletics were originally
just that and nothing more. Win
ning was important, but only for
pride. In decades past, the kind
of coach one was mattered as
much or more than one's win
loss record.
Many players have said that
playing under Wiggin was a
valuable experience and parents
of players have expressed the
same feelings. Stanford tight end
Jim Clymer said that Wiggin
helped him not just on the foot
ball field but in several crises in
his life.
Unfortunately the structure of
college athletics today has made
these old values obsolete. Win
ning is important now, not be
cause of what it means to the
players, but because of what it
means to the Athletic Depart
ment.
College football is big busi
ness. Its success determines the
financial success of an entire ath
letic program. With television
and ticket prices as they are, the
difference between a winning
and losing season can run into
the hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
No one recognizes this more
than Stanford Athletic Director
Andy Geiger who has said that he

has more respect for Wiggin than
anyone he has ever known. Vet
the structure of college athletic
financing today determined that
at least at this juncture, Wiggin
was not the right man for the
Stanford football program.
The sad thing is that Wiggin fit
the Stanford image — almost too
perfectly: a successful Stanford
alumnus, coming back to coach
at his alma matter.
After getting the job, Wiggin
described it as the most impor
tant thing in his life, next to get
ting married.
After the Washington game
this year, Geiger and Wiggin
talked about taking that job away
from Wiggin.
How many of us would have
reacted with as much dignity?
Wiggin could have made a
fuss. He could have blamed the
Athletic Department. He could
have blamed his players. But that
is not the kind of man Wiggin is.
There were no hard feelings.
"I'm really going to miss Stan
ford athletics," Wiggin said. "I
came to Stanford knowing the
rules and knowing the chal
lenges."
Wiggin bowed out with grace
and dignity wishing his succes
sors the best, confident that Stan
ford can and will rebound under
some new coach.

These last few weeks have ob
viously been hard for Wiggin, but
he's kept his composure and
sense of humor through it all.
Two days ago, Wiggin spoke at
a Guardsman Club lunch in San
Francisco. Geiger was there,
along with UC-Berkeley Coach
joe Kapp and several hundred
alumni and fans from both Stan
ford and Cal. In what could have
been a very awkward moment,
Wiggin kept both his sense of
humor and perspective of what
football is all about.
It's no wonder then that Wig
gin received a standing ovation
both before and after his speech.
Sure, there may have been some
element of pity involved. But
there was more. People were not
just applauding Wiggin the
coach. They were applauding
Wiggin the person.
Geiger said that Wiggin is free
to stay at the University, either at
the Athletic Department or the
University as a whole, citing Wig
gin's alumni contacts, organiza
tional ability and other character
istics as valuable.
No matter what happens in
the game tomorrow, Wiggin
won't leave Stanford with a
wimper. He's made too much of
an impression on too many lives.
Wiggin may not have been a
winner on the gridiron, but life is
more than just a game. Paul Wig
gin is a winner in life.
