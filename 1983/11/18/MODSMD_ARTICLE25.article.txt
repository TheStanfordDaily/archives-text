# Bergren a star on the field and in the classroom
## 
### LARRY GREEN Staff writer 
John Bergren will cap off an
outstanding football career
here at Stanford this Saturday
in the Big Came against UC-
Berkeley. The 6-foot-6, 240-
pound defensive end from
South Bend, Ind. is a four-year
letterman and one of only 11
collegiate players in the
United States this year to win a

$3000 post-graduate scholar
ship from the National Foot
ball Foundation and Hall of
Fame.
Bergren will receive the
award on Dec. 6 at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New
York.
Although he has taken
numerous academic All-

America honors, Bergren is
not looking forward to a
career in football. "Sort of in
the forefront of my mind, I'm
looking forward to medical
school."
Bergren is a coterminal
major. In June 1985, he will
leave Stanford with a bac
helor's degree in biology and
an M.S. in chemical engineer
ing. His current 3.54 grade

point average and the tact that
he has qualified for Tau Beta
Phi, the engineering frater
nity, reveals that Bergren is an
outstanding student.
The fact that this year he is
third on the Stanford team in
tackles, with 41 solo efforts
and 23 assists, and second on
the team in sacks with 3.5 dis
plays his importance as a
player. Bergren had his best
game of the season last week
in a losing effort against
Oregon with 10 solo tackles
and 4 assists. "We've lost a lot
of games this season,"
Bergren said, "but I've still
had a lot of fun playing foot
ball."
Bergren almost played col
lege football in his home
town, at Notre Dame, but he
reflects back on his senior
year in high school, when he
was making his college choice
and said, "I almost originally
committed there (Notre
Dame), but I decided to hold
off. I can't regret it (attending
Stanford)."
Bergren, is a serious student
and in his opinion Notre
Dame was "certainly a good
school" but "Stanford's bet
ter."
Bergren began playing foot
ball in seventh grade. Then,
he thought of the sport as
"something all the guys did
and that's the way I looked at
it too."
Football has been a big part
of Bergren's life for many
years. He noted, "Once
you've decided to go from the
high school level to the col
lege level it (football) sudden
ly becomes a much bigger part
(of life)."
Bergren, though, finds time
to balance both athletics and
academics and come out with
strong achievement. Both
come easily to him. "Playing

football is not the same type of
commitment as studying is,"
he pointed out. "It's sort of
good to do something physi
cal like that (football) and then
have the intellectual. It's nice
to go out on the field some
days and just kind of forget
about everything for awhile
except football and just do
something completely physi
cal. It sort of purges your
mind."
Bergren wants to finish his
career with a win against Cal.
"It's always good to go away
from something with a good
feeling about it. I guess you
tend to get sort of sentimental
after you realize everything is
sort of coming to a halt. It
comes pretty fast before you

realize it's there."
Bergren has played on only
one Stanford team that
finished above .500 (6-5 during
the 1980 campaign), but he put
the situation into perspective:
"I'd call it unfortunate (that
Stanford has not had a win
ning program for some time).
Vou can't cry over spilled milk
. . . I think Stanford's kind of
special in what they're trying
to do here . . . play major col
lege football and still maintain
a certain emphasis on the aca
demic side. I think we
(Stanford) do a better job of it
than almost anybody in the
country."
Still, beating UC-Berkeley in
Big Game tomorrow will mean
a lot to Bergren, as it will to

the entire team. "We're going
to beat the Weenies," he said,
smiling. "Our (the team's)
feeling is that we just want to
go out and beat Cal. I think
it'll make a big difference in
this season. I think it'll be a
good finish."
He devotes much of his
seemingly busy time to the
NCAA Volunteers for Youth
program and the Lutheran
Church Council.
Stanford Head Coach Paul
Wiggin once commented on
Bergren, saying, "John is
everything you want in a
young man and plays his heart
out every down. There is no
one who plays with more char
acter."
