# Greek of the Week
## 
### 
Gary Tyrrell, the now famous Stan
ford trombone player who was
knocked down by Kevin Moen in the
end zone on UC-Berkeley's final play
last year, was chosen as this week's
Guest Greek of the Week.
Tyrrell thinks that Stanford will win
this year's game, but he doesn't think
that it will be very high-scoring. "I
think it is going to come down to
(Stanford kicker) Mark Harmon again
this year."

Cardinal Football Head Coach Paul
Wiggin said earlier in the week that he
had put Tyrrell on a weight training
program this year and that he would
have him down on the field. When
asked what his role would be in this
year's game, however, Tyrrell did not
wish to comment. "I would ruin the
surprise if I commented now," he told
The Daily last night.
Asked if he had any closing com
ments on the Big Game, Tyrrell was

quick to respond. "I really hope to see
)oe Kapp humiliated."
Also picking with the Greek are
Stanford Daily sports editors Adam
Berns and Mark Zeigler and KZSU
sports director Mike Lieberman. Two
other special predictors for this week
are Daily Business Manager Tom Nel
son and Gunn High School sopho
more Kenneth Bockholt, who won The
Daily's "You Pick 'em" contest last
week by picking all ten games correct
