# Swimmers lock horns with Texas
## 
### MICHAEL LLERANDI 
The Stanford men's swimming team
takes on the University of Texas at De
Guerre pool today at 1 p.m. in what
should be one of the most exciting con
tests of the year.
The Longhorns are looking strong again
this year after finishing third at last year's
NCAA Championships, and are led by
Rick Carey, the world record holder in
the 100 and 200 meter backstrokes.
Stanford should be more than ready for
the challenge, even though the Long
horns' early start has given them a three
week training advantage.
"Winning this meet has been looked
upon as an important early season goal,''
said Cardinal swimmer Dave Bottom, a
former American record holder who is
perhaps Carey's fiercest rival. "The meet
should be a lot of tun because we're ex
pecting a large crowd. There should also

be plenty of alums in the stands due to
the Big Came."
There doesn't appear to be a single
team in Stanford's tough schedule that
can match the Cardinal's depth. Their
strength is deep in all areas, featuring
Olympic veterans, former and current
American record holders, and potential
NCAA champions.
Sophomore divers Thor Johnson and
Tom Rothenbucher also give the Card an
extraordinary amount of talent in an area
where it has been weak in the past.
The Cardinal strength runs deepest in
the backstroke and individual medley
events, where the team sports no fewer
than six Ail-Americans. Pan American
Games silver medalist Bottom will be
joined by juniors John Engs, Mike Con
aton and Carter Cast to provide the
power in the backstroke events. The 200
and 400 individual medleys are equally
strong, led by freshman Jeff Kostoff,

school record holder Todd Lincoln and
1980 U.S. Olympian John Simons.
Sophomore breaststroker John Moffet
was runner-up in both the 100 and 200
breast events at last year's NCAA Cham
pionships, and should continue to domi
nate these races this season.
In the butterfly events, look for fresh
man Pablo Morales. Stanford Coach Skip
Kenney calls Morales "the greatest Amer
ican butterfly prospect since Mark Spitz."
Joining the Pan Am silver medalist will be
seniors Mark Michael and Charlie
Johnson, along with junior John Denny.
This amazing amount of depth con
tinues in the freestyle events, where
senior Olympian Dave Sims will be
teamed up with Kostoff in the distance
events, while the sprints will be high
lighted by seniors Sam Worden and Ricky
Bodor. Freshman Dave Louden will help
round out the middle distances.
