# Davis signs 3 top basketball recruits

### MARK ZEIGLER 
For Stanford Head Basket
ball Coach Tom Davis, yester
day brought good news and,
well, good news.
Three top basketball
recruits have signed letters of
intent to attend Stanford next
fall pending their acceptance
to the University, The Daily
learned yesterday.
Although the names of the
three players have not yet
been released, at least one of
them was heavily recruited by
schools across the nation —
including perennial power
UCLA — The Daily was told.
The other good news for
Davis came from basketball of
fice assistant Steve Odell.
Odell announced that student
season tickets are completely
sold out for the 1983-84 Car
dinal campaign.
"To the best of my knowl

edge," Odell said, "we (at
Stanford) have the highest
percentage of the student
body with a season ticket than
any other school in the
country."
Stanford's total student
body is about 12,000, with it
about evenly divided between
undergraduates and
graduates. And since most of
the 3500 student season tick
ets sold have been to under
graduates, it can be estimated
that nearly half the undergrad
uate population at Stanford
holds the series.
Odell also said fewer than
300 tickets remain overall in
the 7457-seat Maples Pavilion.
"We're overwhelmed with
the response, especially in the
student market," said Stan
ford associate head coach
Bruce Pearl.

Stanford is expecting record crowds for basketball games this season, as Maples Pavilion is
less than 300 tickets from being sold out.
