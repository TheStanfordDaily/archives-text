# Ripken wins MVP

From the Associated Press
The sophomore jinx
never bothered Cal Ripken,
Jr., who finished the 198J
season as the American
League's Most Valuable
Player.
Ripken, who played
every inning of every game
for the world champion
Baltimore Orioles, said
Wednesday he overcame
the so-called jinx simply by
ignoring it.
"I heard about the soph
omore jinx plenty of times
last winter," the 23-year
old shortstop said Wednes
day after being named
MVP. "I never believed in
the sophomore jinx.
"I thought I would have
an advantage in my second
year as opposed to my first
year because I knew the
pitchers a little bit (better).
I felt a little more confident
on Day One (in 1983) in

stead of having to work
(up) my confidence."
With Robin Vount of Mil
waukee named the
league's MVP last season, it
was only the second time in
history that different
shortstops have won the
award in consecutive years.
Ernie Banks of the Chicago
Cubs won two straight in
1958-59 and Dick Groat of
the Pittsburgh Pirates fol
lowed him in 1960.
Ripken became the first
major leaguer to win the
rookie and MVP awards in
consecutive seasons. Fred
Lynn took both honors in
1975 with Boston. Four
other players — Thurman
Munson, and Rod Carew in
the American League and
Jackie Robinson and Pete
Rose in the National —
have won both awards
during their careers, but
not in consecutive years.
