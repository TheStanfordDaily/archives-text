# ABC's 'The Day After': impact unknown but hotly debated
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Staff writer 
This Sunday night, thermonuclear
holocaust will be only as far away as the
nearest television set as ABC broadcasts a
docu-drama depicting a nuclear attack and
its aftermath.
"The Day After" will air Sunday evening
at 8 p.m., thus bringing as yet unseen hor
rors into the homes of between 40 and 60
million Americans. The movie offers a
depiction of Kansas City and its inhabitants
during and following the airburst of a one
megaton nuclear warhead.
Reports from previewers of the show
generally concur that "The Day After" is
brutally graphic in its presentation. The
New York Times described it as

"relentlessly depressing, with scenes of
enormous destruction by firestorm, people
being vaporized, mass graves, irretrievable
loss of food and water supplies, vandalism
and murder, the breakdown of medical
care and disfigurement and death from ra
diation sickness."
A movie of this nature has obvious psy
chological impact. Accordingly, many
groups, including Ground Zero and
Educators for Social Responsibility, have
advised against allowing younger children
to watch the program. The Physicians for
Social Responsibility (PSR) has not only rec
ommended that children under 12 be kept
from watching, they have advised that no
one watch the movie alone.
As is to be expected from a film with this

subject matter, "The Day After" has created
a political controversy even before it has
been aired. Croups and individuals on both
sides of the nuclear freeze debate have
long ago begun campaigns either support
ing or opposing the docu-drama.
Nuclear freeze proponents such as PSR
and Ground Zero have publicized and rec
ommended the program while pro-nuclear
forces such as Rev. Jerry Falwell's Moral
Majority and Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum
have condemned it.
Even politically neutral groups have made
the program into an event. Newsweek
reports that civic leaders across the nation
have "arranged groups screenings in com
munity centers and homes, with discussion
forums to follow." In addition, school ad-

ministrators nationwide are using
"The Day After" as a focal point of
their nuclear weapons curricula.
A film of this nature that reaches
an audience of 60 million people will
undoubtedly have some sort of poli
tical consequence. Political Science
Prof. Hubert Marshall said there
would be a "big impact on many
people who watch it."
He attributed some of this impact
as well as the size of the expected
audience to the "extraordinary
amount of publicity" the program
has received. While he cautioned
that nuclear war is a subject many
people would rather not think
about, Marshall believes that "some
proportion of the undecided people
may be galvanized " into putting
pressure on political candidates in
the upcoming election year.
Condoleezza Rice, assistant pro
fessor of political science, generally
concurred. She said the movie
would serve to "crystallize all the
fears about nuclear war that are out
there." Rice qualified this statement
by adding that the impact of the film
could go in two divergent direc
tions.
She believes that people would

either "withdraw and despair" or
become more politicized. Rice said
she thinks that the greatest impact
the movie could make was raising
"the visibility of the issue (nuclear
arms)" because of the enormous au
dience it will reach.

Coit Blacker, the associate direc
tor of the Center for International
Security and Arms Control, gave a
more guarded analysis. While he
agreed that the program will prob
ably have "a powerful impact,"
Blacker believes the movie could
have any of several consequences.
He said that it could "increase the

incentive of those on the fence but
leaning (toward the freeze move
ment)" to commit themselves. At
the same time, it could "arouse
enough conservative ire" to get
"people marginally opposed (to the
freeze movement) to become ac
tive."
Although "The Day After" is
merely a portrayal of nuclear
holocaust, reports indicate that it
surprisingly accurate in its depic
tion. Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a
speaker at the Oct. 31 conference in
Washington, D.C. on the ecological
effects of nuclear war, said the
docu-drama was "very moving" and
"the most accurate portrayal that
has been done yet."
Ehrlich added, however, that it
neglected to show the long term ef
fects. "It will be extremely cold (well
below zero degrees Celsius soon
after the attack), extremely dark,
and very smoggy," he said.
Nevertheless, Ehrlich, who has
previewed it, highly recommends
the film. "It brings home emotional
ly what we all know intellectually,"
he said.
Prof. Sidney Drell, deputy direc
tor of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), agreed.
The movie, said Drell, will provide a
"better understanding of what nu
clear holocaust really means."

pressure on political candidates in
the upcoming election year.
Condoleezza Rice, assistant pro
fessor of political science, generally
concurred. She said the movie
would serve to "crystallize all the
fears about nuclear war that are out
there." Rice qualified this statement
by adding that the impact of the film
could go in two divergent direc
tions.
She believes that people would

either "withdraw and despair" or
become more politicized. Rice said
she thinks that the greatest impact
the movie could make was raising
"the visibility of the issue (nuclear
arms)" because of the enormous au
dience it will reach.

Coit Blacker, the associate direc
tor of the Center for International
Security and Arms Control, gave a
more guarded analysis. While he
agreed that the program will prob
ably have "a powerful impact,"
Blacker believes the movie could
have any of several consequences.
He said that it could "increase the

incentive of those on the fence but
leaning (toward the freeze move
ment)" to commit themselves. At
the same time, it could "arouse
enough conservative ire" to get
"people marginally opposed (to the
freeze movement) to become ac
tive."
Although "The Day After" is
merely a portrayal of nuclear
holocaust, reports indicate that it
surprisingly accurate in its depic
tion. Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a
speaker at the Oct. 31 conference in
Washington, D.C. on the ecological
effects of nuclear war, said the
docu-drama was "very moving" and
"the most accurate portrayal that
has been done yet."
Ehrlich added, however, that it
neglected to show the long term ef
fects. "It will be extremely cold (well
below zero degrees Celsius soon
after the attack), extremely dark,
and very smoggy," he said.
Nevertheless, Ehrlich, who has
previewed it, highly recommends
the film. "It brings home emotional
ly what we all know intellectually,"
he said.
Prof. Sidney Drell, deputy direc
tor of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), agreed.
The movie, said Drell, will provide a
"better understanding of what nu
clear holocaust really means."

This Sunday night, thermonuclear
holocaust will be only as far away as the
nearest television set as ABC broadcasts a
docu-drama depicting a nuclear attack and
its aftermath.
"The Day After" will air Sunday evening
at 8 p.m., thus bringing as yet unseen hor
rors into the homes of between 40 and 60
million Americans. The movie offers a
depiction of Kansas City and its inhabitants
during and following the airburst of a one
megaton nuclear warhead.
Reports from previewers of the show
generally concur that "The Day After" is
brutally graphic in its presentation. The
New York Times described it as

"relentlessly depressing, with scenes of
enormous destruction by firestorm, people
being vaporized, mass graves, irretrievable
loss of food and water supplies, vandalism
and murder, the breakdown of medical
care and disfigurement and death from ra
diation sickness."
A movie of this nature has obvious psy
chological impact. Accordingly, many
groups, including Ground Zero and
Educators for Social Responsibility, have
advised against allowing younger children
to watch the program. The Physicians for
Social Responsibility (PSR) has not only rec
ommended that children under 12 be kept
from watching, they have advised that no
one watch the movie alone.
As is to be expected from a film with this

subject matter, "The Day After" has created
a political controversy even before it has
been aired. Croups and individuals on both
sides of the nuclear freeze debate have
long ago begun campaigns either support
ing or opposing the docu-drama.
Nuclear freeze proponents such as PSR
and Ground Zero have publicized and rec
ommended the program while pro-nuclear
forces such as Rev. Jerry Falwell's Moral
Majority and Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum
have condemned it.
Even politically neutral groups have made
the program into an event. Newsweek
reports that civic leaders across the nation
have "arranged groups screenings in com
munity centers and homes, with discussion
forums to follow." In addition, school ad-

ministrators nationwide are using
"The Day After" as a focal point of
their nuclear weapons curricula.
A film of this nature that reaches
an audience of 60 million people will
undoubtedly have some sort of poli
tical consequence. Political Science
Prof. Hubert Marshall said there
would be a "big impact on many
people who watch it."
He attributed some of this impact
as well as the size of the expected
audience to the "extraordinary
amount of publicity" the program
has received. While he cautioned
that nuclear war is a subject many
people would rather not think
about, Marshall believes that "some
proportion of the undecided people
may be galvanized " into putting
pressure on political candidates in
the upcoming election year.
