# ABC's 'The Day After': impact unknown but hotly debated
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Staff writer 
This Sunday night, thermonuclear
holocaust will be only as far away as the
nearest television set as ABC broadcasts a
docu-drama depicting a nuclear attack and
its aftermath.
"The Day After" will air Sunday evening
at 8 p.m., thus bringing as yet unseen hor
rors into the homes of between 40 and 60
million Americans. The movie offers a
depiction of Kansas City and its inhabitants
during and following the airburst of a one

Reports from previewers of the show
generally concur that "The Day After" is

advised against allowing younger children
to watch the program. The Physicians for
Social Responsibility (PSR) has not only rec

from watching, they have advised that no
one watch the movie alone.

subject matter, "The Day After" has created
a political controversy even before it has
been aired. Croups and individuals on both
sides of the nuclear freeze debate have
long ago begun campaigns either support
ing or opposing the docu-drama.
Nuclear freeze proponents such as PSR
and Ground Zero have publicized and rec
ommended the program while pro-nuclear
forces such as Rev. Jerry Falwell's Moral
Majority and Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum
have condemned it.
Even politically neutral groups have made
the program into an event. Newsweek
reports that civic leaders across the nation
have "arranged groups screenings in com
munity centers and homes, with discussion
forums to follow." In addition, school ad-
