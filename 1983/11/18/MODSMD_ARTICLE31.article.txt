The Stanford women's cross country
team takes its show to Lehigh, Pa., in an
effort to win its first NCAA championship
this Monday.
In the last two years Stanford has im
proved from third to second at this meet
and, with their strongest squad yet, are
one of the co-favorites to win the 1983
title.
Success will hinge on the status of Ceci
Hopp, who is returning from a hip injury
and hasn't raced in several weeks. Her
absence last week cost Stanford the Dis
trict VIII title as they were upset by

Oregon.
Card Coach Brooks Johnson was
evasive when asked about Hopp's condi
tion. "Everybody's got problems at this
point of the season," he said. "The
season takes a certain amount out of you.
We're not 100 percent, Oregon's not,
nobody is."
Hopp finished third in the NCAAs last
year and tenth as a freshman in 1981.
Even if Hopp performs well, the
remainder of Stanford's nucleus will have
to come through. "If our five people have

an 'on' day," Johnson said, "we won't
have to worry about anybody else."
The "anybody else" Johnson speaks of
are North Carolina and Oregon, who are
co-favorites to win along with Stanford.
Darkhorse challengers for the title in
clude Wisconsin, Tennessee, lowa State
and Clemson.
The winner, Johnson said, will be the
team that wants it the most. "Any team
can come out on top. It depends on
who's the most motivated," he said.
"We're one of the better teams in the
country. And we're going to find out if
we're the best."
