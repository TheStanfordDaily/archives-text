ing season for this year's fen

pects the squad to be even

stronger than last year's team
which finished in sixth place in
the NCAAs for women, and
eighth place for men.
Hurst is optimistic about
this year's fencers. "We
should be the strongest team
in the region," he said.
Stanford has a three weapon

which enhances its strength.

McConnel, senior Jon Meyer
and sophomore Elliot Cheu.
On the women's team, top
performers sophomore Jen
nifer Yu and senior Cathy Cor

rea will serve as the tean
backbone. New recruits M
Levitan and Holly Taylor v\
add depth to the squad.

schedule this season in whi>
they face highly competiti
fencing teams such as A
Force, Notre Dame and Bri
ham Young. After Santa Cru
