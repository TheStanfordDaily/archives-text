the red tile roofs
ant) Spanish architecture are
very reminiscent of this lovely
university, the private bal
conies or patios, king-size
beds, cable television, in
room refrigerators, and drip
cot fee makers will reassure
you. For residents of Sterling
Quad who may need further
proof, the heated pool and
enclosed whirlpool spa will
dispel any lingering doubts.
P'T he main wing of the Lodge
isiabout seven years old, and
the addition was completed
about a year and a half ago.
Once greeted and registered
by a friendly, accomodating
staff, one can begin to appre
ciate the amenities this beauti

ful lodge has to offer.
Our room came complete
with the above-mentioned
luxuries, and one nice
surprise: a fireplace. The oak
and wicker furniture was taste
fully complemented by the
hushed tones of the decor, in
cluding terra cotta, ivory and
navy. The balcony overlooked
the fairway of the fourth hole
on the golf course.
Room service is provided by
a neighboring restaurant,
called The Swedish Place.
Open every day except Mon
day, they provide breakfast,
lunch and dinner complete
with a good selection of wine
and hors d'oeuvres, if ohly a
snack is required.
The Lodge can make it very
tempting to spend all of one's
stay in the room, so if you're
intent on hard-core studying,
ask for an extra log for the
fireplace and crack your
books. A dip in the pool and
spa after a few hours will pro
vide just the study break you
need, and a late night French
Cheese Tray complete with
fruit and crackers together
with a half-bottle (you are
studying) of Chateau de Costis
Bordeux is no more than you
deserve. The Lodge even pro
vides you with the coffee
you'll need in the wee hours
of the morning.
Despite the fact that the
luxurious surroundings seem
to make expensive rates a
foregone conclusion, prices at
Half Moon Bay Lodge are very
reasonable. A double
occupancy room with a king
size bed runs only $62. A room
with a fireplace brings it up to
$68. These prices then con
tinue up to $88. The charge for
each additional person is only
$5 and children stay free.
More specific information
on rates and on Lodge confer

ence rooms and facilities
(which are as nice and as rea
sonably priced as the guest
rooms) can be obtained by
phoning or writing to Half
Moon Bay Lodge, 2400 S.

Bay, 94019.
If you're one of the luckier
ones who has time to enjoy
what the rest of the area has to
offer, just check into the
Lodge with the promise of re
turning later and take off to
any one of several nearby at
tractions.
Half Moon Bay is San Mateo
County's oldest community. It
was first explored by Captain
Gaspar de Portola in 1769,
when it was inhabited by the
Costanoan Indians. With a
population of 7282, it is best
known now for its colorful
pumpkin festivals each au
tumn.
Shopping on Main Street in
Half Moon Bay gives a feeling
of Americana and hominess.
Spanishtown, an arts and
crafts center named to com
memorate the days before
1900 when all of the Half
Moon Bay area was called
Spanishtown, is an arcade of
twelve shops each offering a
different kind of art or craft.
These two areas can provide a
pleasant morning's shopping
If you're an avid golfer, you
already know about the Half
Moon Bay course. I hear the
ocean cliffs on the 18th hole
make it particularly challeng
ing. From the Lodge, you
could just walk over.
Horseback riding along the
ocean is a neat experience,
and there are two stables in
nearby, with rates around $7
per hour.
Whale-watching boat trips
leave from Pillar Point Harbor
daily, January through May.
The cruise costs between $12

to $15 per person, and lasts for
about three hours.
Nearby Ano Nuevo State
Park offers the opportunity to
observe more sea life;'it is a
breeding ground for elephant
seals during the winter
months. Walking tours are $7
per person, including trans
portation from Half Moon Bay.
The award-winning Obester
Winery is located in Half
Moon Bay, and wine seminars
can be arranged. Tasting is al
ways encouraged.
Fine dining is also easily
found in the area. The Colony
Club at the Half Moon Bay
Golf Links is reported to be an
excellent choice, and The
Shore Bird is also highly rec
ommended. We chose to dine
at The Chart House, just up
the highway in Montara, and
were very happy with our se
lection.
The Chart House is located
right on Montara Beach, and a
table by the window ensures
an awesome view of the surf.
The restaurant is dimly-lit and
cozy, accented by teak, and
has an open brass fireplace in
the center which provides an
attractive alternative to watch
ing the breakers. Prices are
reasonable, ranging from
$8.95 (for chicken) to $18.95
(for crab). Dinners include
potatoes or rice, salad bar and
all the hot bread you would
like.
I chose the Hawaiian
Chicken ($8.95) and my guest
couldn't pass up the swordfish
($11.65). We also agreed that
we couldn't leave without
sampling the clam chowder,
so we ordered one bowl with
two spoons.
As soon as I got close
enough to really see the salad
bar I realized I had made a
mistake. An extensive array of
crisp, cold lettuce, numerous

toppings, and a wide selection
of fresh fruit proved that the
salad bar could be a meal in it
self. It is, in fact, listed on the
menu for $7.25, and is well
worth it. I was sorry to not
take full advantage of it, but
knew there was too much yet
to come.
The clam chowder was good
and hot, and just what you ex
pect clam chowder to be. We
had almost polished it off
when our main course arrived.
My chicken was wonderful,
marinated in teriyaki sauce
and then charbroiled, and
served with more sauce and a
slice of pineapple. The rice
was basic, and good also. My
guest's swordfish was just as
good judging from the way
our conversation halted to
give way to full enjoyment of
the meal.
The wine list is also compre
hensive, and reasonably
priced. We sampled half a bot
tle of a Wente Brothers Grey
Riesling, and found it comple
mented our meal perfectly.
Although I have to admit I
was stuffed by this point, our
waiter informed us that The
Chart House was famous for
its mud pie, and we just
couldn't resist. I'm glad we
didn't; it was definitely the

piece de la resistance of our
meal. A huge slice of coffee
ice cream pie, nestled in Oreo
cookie crust, topped with a
rich, rich fudge and smot
hered in whipped cream ap
peared before our very eyes.
Now, I'm a dessert fanatic, but
my guest was one of those
people who would rather have
an apple, so the proof of the
pudding (or rather the pie),
came when he pronounced it
the best mud pie he had ever
tasted, and left not a morsel.
The service, although a tad
slow in taking the order and
delivering the check, was
otherwise attentive and
friendly. Our waiter, John,
was willing and eager to chat
with us about the food, the
restaurant, or anything else
that came up.
The whole meal came to
only around $27, making it a
wonderful bargain, and a wise
choice if you're looking for
good food in a warm, attrac
tive atmosphere. There is a bar
downstairs which also has an
excellent view of the beach.
Reservations are not taken,
but although business was
steady the whole time we
were there on a Friday night,
the wait was never extrava
gant. In my book, The Chart

House is worth a trip to Half
Moon Bay all by itself.
Up to this point, I have
ignored the beaches of Half
Moon Bay, mostly because
they are already a famous road
trip for students. We visited
them on a Saturday, and
found that if you drive along
the coast you can find a beach
to suit whatever mood you
happen to be in. At El Grenada
we ran into a surfing competi
tion, Francis State Beach
seemed to be the place for
family picnics, and Montara
Beach was nearly deserted. At
Moss Beach we discovered a
small, deli-type restaurant
called "Picnics" which offers a
good selection of sandwiches,
salads, wines and cheeses, all
packed up and ready for a pic
nic. They also have the all
essential Bud's ice cream for
dessert.
So, whether you need a
place to study and get away
from it all, or if you're just
looking for a new spot to ex
plore and have some fun, re
member that pumpkins alone
do not make Half Moon Bay.
The 45-minute drive from
Highway 280 to Highway 92
across to Highway 1, is well
worth the mental distance it
provides.
