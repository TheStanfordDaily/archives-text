DINAH'S SHACK
4269 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9510
Tired of pretentious little bistro-cafes with haughty waiters,
extortionate prices and mediocre food? Would you settle for a
pleasant, homey atmosphere, friendly faces and just plain good
cooking? If so, then Dinah's Shack on El Camino might be just
what you are looking for.
There is nothing pretentious about this restaurant (as the
name would indicate), and the old red barn exterior, replete
with bright blue awnings, removes any fears that your credit line
is in jeopardy. Surely, any restaurant with a pair of huge black
iron dogs guarding the entrance is a place you can bring the
folks for dinner after Big Game.
Inside, Dinah's Shack is warm and comfortable, like the
dining room at grandma's house. An abundance of wood panel
ing and eclectic but unassuming decor, combined with the fairly
dim lighting, serve to create an atmosphere of familial intimacy
in a rather large dining room. The bar and lounge at the en
trance of the restaurant remind one of a cozy family room with a
big fireplace, overstuffed chairs and even an organ. Interesting
ly, the near wall sports a dense cover of neatly carved graffiti
which patrons, especially Stanfordites, have embellished upon
over the past 50 years, and the restaurant often finds people
searching the wall for initials and messages carved two or three
decades previously.
As you enter the main dining room, the focus of the room
and most of the lighting) is obviously centered upon the im
mense smorgasbord table, the pride of Dinah's Shack. There is
even a harpist nearby, serenading the smorgasbord and (of
course) the diners with a medley of all the best loved music-box
hits of the past century. Actually, the harp music is quite good, a
special touch which adds a nice bit of refinement to the other
wise down-home ambiance of the restaurant.
Our party was seated quickly, and although we had made
reservations, they were really not necessary even at peak hours
on a post-game Saturday. Millie, our friendly waitress, was with
us in seconds, and remained "extremely solicitous" (thanks
Mom) throughout the evening, showing a genuine interest in
our enjoyment of the meal and general well-being.
Unfortunately, of the several seafood specials offered on the
chalkboard at the entrance, the snapper and trout were un
available, a fact for which Millie apologized sincerely. Her high
est recommendation was, of course, for the revered smorgas
bord, and for good reason. Where else can you find an authen
tic Scandinavian smorgasbord with over 40 dishes, several hot
main courses and a bottomless plate for only $7.95? The menu
even includes a history of their smorgasbord (in existence since
the early 19305), and a helpful guide to the traditional smorgas
bord ritual of several different serving trips, once each for the
seatood appetizers, salads and relishes, hot dishes and finally
desserts.
To the naive, several of the smorgasbord's dishes are uniden
tifiable, and because none of the items are labeled, some confu
sion may occur. This is especially critical when dealing with
items not commonly encountered by the American palate, such
as the many cold fish dishes, and especially the tripe in tomato
sauce YOW!). A label would be helpful and appreciated. The
hot dishes offered were teriyaki chicken (very good), tortellini
(fair), burgundy beef (tender) and mixed vegetables (delicious).
Although I ventured to order from the menu, my companions
were smorga-fans, and much of my evening was spent sampling
trom their plates. For the price, the smorgasbord is ideal for
starving students; it offers a wide choice of dishes for
vegetarians, and the endless plate assures even the hungriest
linebacker of a filling meal.
The rest of the menu is well-varied, and there are several
seafood entrees which are tempting, including trout, snapper,
salmon, sole, prawns and scallops, with prices ranging from $7
to $12. Other house specialties are prime rib (regular cut $11.75,
petite cut $9.75), fried chicken ($6.75) and duck a I'orange
($8.95). One of us ordered the petite end cut of prime rib; it

proved to he very well seasoned and tender, and is enough food
for all but the most ravenous appetites.
I chose the fresh scallops in white wine and mushrooms
($10.75), served with rice, fresh vegetables and soup or salad.
The onion soup was fine, and the vegetables were very good,
not overcooked as they often are in busy restaurants. Although
the scallops were very tender and obviously fresh, the sauce was
a bit thinner than I would have liked and heavily peppered,
which overpowered the delicate flavor of the scallops. Also in
cluded with every table is a basket of hot, fresh, fluffy biscuits
like mom makes â€” a definitely homey touch.
Dessert was a pleasure; everything offered was old-fashioned
and priced under $1.75, including cheesecake (of course), apple
pie a la mode, strawberry shortcake and ice cream sundaes. The
apple pie was delicious, very tart and crisp, with a flaky crust
that Bettv Crocker would envy, and the cheesecake was better
than most.
After the meal, the proud manager, Paul Partti, explained that
Dinah's Shack opened in 1926, and has been under the direction
of owner )ohn Ricky for the past 25 years. Partti summed up
Dinah's philosophy as "trying to keep the prices low and the
quality high, so everyone can come," a laudable goal which is
certainly evident in the menu and service provided for a more
than moderate price. On the way out, it is traditional to rub one
of the dog statue's noses to insure your return to Dinah's Shack,
but after such a delightful meal, your return is a foregone con
clusion!
If you choose to return for Thanksgiving, Dinah's will be of
fering a special menu which will include the traditional smorgas
bord ($8.75). An assortment of entrees, including roast turkey
and all the trimmings ($9.95), prime rib ($11.95), and scampi
"bordelaise" ($11.50) will also be offered. Dinners will include
corn chowder or a mixed green salad, and pumpkin pie for des
sert. For a mere $1.95, you can also make one trip around the
smorgasbord to select your appetizers.
Reservations are highly recommended, and Dinah's wishes
you a happy holiday season.

cooking? If so, then Dinah's Shack on El Camino might be just
what you are looking for.
There is nothing pretentious about this restaurant (as the
name would indicate), and the old red barn exterior, replete
with bright blue awnings, removes any fears that your credit line
is in jeopardy. Surely, any restaurant with a pair of huge black
iron dogs guarding the entrance is a place you can bring the
folks for dinner after Big Game.
Inside, Dinah's Shack is warm and comfortable, like the
dining room at grandma's house. An abundance of wood panel
ing and eclectic but unassuming decor, combined with the fairly
dim lighting, serve to create an atmosphere of familial intimacy
in a rather large dining room. The bar and lounge at the en
trance of the restaurant remind one of a cozy family room with a
big fireplace, overstuffed chairs and even an organ. Interesting
ly, the near wall sports a dense cover of neatly carved graffiti
which patrons, especially Stanfordites, have embellished upon
over the past 50 years, and the restaurant often finds people
searching the wall for initials and messages carved two or three
decades previously.
As you enter the main dining room, the focus of the room
and most of the lighting) is obviously centered upon the im
mense smorgasbord table, the pride of Dinah's Shack. There is
even a harpist nearby, serenading the smorgasbord and (of
course) the diners with a medley of all the best loved music-box
hits of the past century. Actually, the harp music is quite good, a
special touch which adds a nice bit of refinement to the other
wise down-home ambiance of the restaurant.
Our party was seated quickly, and although we had made
reservations, they were really not necessary even at peak hours
on a post-game Saturday. Millie, our friendly waitress, was with
us in seconds, and remained "extremely solicitous" (thanks
Mom) throughout the evening, showing a genuine interest in
our enjoyment of the meal and general well-being.
Unfortunately, of the several seafood specials offered on the
chalkboard at the entrance, the snapper and trout were un
available, a fact for which Millie apologized sincerely. Her high
est recommendation was, of course, for the revered smorgas
bord, and for good reason. Where else can you find an authen
tic Scandinavian smorgasbord with over 40 dishes, several hot
main courses and a bottomless plate for only $7.95? The menu
even includes a history of their smorgasbord (in existence since
the early 19305), and a helpful guide to the traditional smorgas
bord ritual of several different serving trips, once each for the
seatood appetizers, salads and relishes, hot dishes and finally
desserts.
To the naive, several of the smorgasbord's dishes are uniden
tifiable, and because none of the items are labeled, some confu
sion may occur. This is especially critical when dealing with
items not commonly encountered by the American palate, such
as the many cold fish dishes, and especially the tripe in tomato
sauce YOW!). A label would be helpful and appreciated. The
hot dishes offered were teriyaki chicken (very good), tortellini
(fair), burgundy beef (tender) and mixed vegetables (delicious).
Although I ventured to order from the menu, my companions
were smorga-fans, and much of my evening was spent sampling
trom their plates. For the price, the smorgasbord is ideal for
starving students; it offers a wide choice of dishes for
vegetarians, and the endless plate assures even the hungriest
linebacker of a filling meal.
The rest of the menu is well-varied, and there are several
seafood entrees which are tempting, including trout, snapper,
salmon, sole, prawns and scallops, with prices ranging from $7
to $12. Other house specialties are prime rib (regular cut $11.75,
petite cut $9.75), fried chicken ($6.75) and duck a I'orange
($8.95). One of us ordered the petite end cut of prime rib; it

proved to he very well seasoned and tender, and is enough food
for all but the most ravenous appetites.
I chose the fresh scallops in white wine and mushrooms
($10.75), served with rice, fresh vegetables and soup or salad.
The onion soup was fine, and the vegetables were very good,
not overcooked as they often are in busy restaurants. Although
the scallops were very tender and obviously fresh, the sauce was
a bit thinner than I would have liked and heavily peppered,
which overpowered the delicate flavor of the scallops. Also in
cluded with every table is a basket of hot, fresh, fluffy biscuits
like mom makes â€” a definitely homey touch.
Dessert was a pleasure; everything offered was old-fashioned
and priced under $1.75, including cheesecake (of course), apple
pie a la mode, strawberry shortcake and ice cream sundaes. The
apple pie was delicious, very tart and crisp, with a flaky crust
that Bettv Crocker would envy, and the cheesecake was better
than most.
After the meal, the proud manager, Paul Partti, explained that
Dinah's Shack opened in 1926, and has been under the direction
of owner )ohn Ricky for the past 25 years. Partti summed up
Dinah's philosophy as "trying to keep the prices low and the
quality high, so everyone can come," a laudable goal which is
certainly evident in the menu and service provided for a more
than moderate price. On the way out, it is traditional to rub one
of the dog statue's noses to insure your return to Dinah's Shack,
but after such a delightful meal, your return is a foregone con
clusion!
If you choose to return for Thanksgiving, Dinah's will be of
fering a special menu which will include the traditional smorgas
bord ($8.75). An assortment of entrees, including roast turkey
and all the trimmings ($9.95), prime rib ($11.95), and scampi
"bordelaise" ($11.50) will also be offered. Dinners will include
corn chowder or a mixed green salad, and pumpkin pie for des
sert. For a mere $1.95, you can also make one trip around the
smorgasbord to select your appetizers.
Reservations are highly recommended, and Dinah's wishes
you a happy holiday season.
