The bustling, festive atmosphere of Chez
lustine on Thanksgiving is quite a contrast to
the feeling of solitude one experiences
when dining at the same restaurant on a
Monday evening. Accompanied only by a
few random parties of businessmen, and in
strumental renditions of "New York, New
York" and "Let's Get Physical" in the back
ground, we embarked on yet another inter
esting dining experience.
While waiting for our appetizers, we took
note of the exquisitely set tables, red velvet
chairs and otherwise posh decor which
comprise this elegant (though some might
say pretentious) restaurant. For Thanksgiv
ing day, the restaurant is enlarged and has a
much more informal atmosphere.
We began our meal with escargots ($5.50)
and French onion soup ($2.75). Cooked in a
rich garlic and butter sauce, the escargots
proved to be one of the highlights of the
meal. The onion soup was also delicious,
complete with an abundance of cheese
baked on top. We also sampled the soup du
jour — cream of celery. The soup was mere
ly adequate, though perhaps some addi
tional seasoning could improve it.
Following a somewhat distasteful con
versation, we received our dinner salads
which somehow managed to revive our ap
petites. Tossing the salad before it reaches
the table (as Chez lustine does), rather than
just serving lettuce with a glob of dressing
atop, is one mark of a restaurant with class.
The salad was crisp and fresh, and the
chunky bleu cheese dressing was very
flavorful.
Although they didn't quite match our ex
pectations, we were both pleased with our
entree selections. The serving of trout ($l3)
was surprisingly large, stuffed with baby

shrimp and sauteed mushrooms, and baked
in a delectable sauce. The filet mignon
($16.50) was very thick and flavorful, though
a somewhat smaller portion than was ex
pected. A light Bearnaise sauce was served
on the side. Both dishes were attractively
prepared and were served with carrots,
broccoli in Hollandaise sauce and sliced
potatoes. The vegetables were tasty (and un
usually colorful), though we did wonder
about their freshness.
Other entrees included veal scallopini
($16.50), supreme of chicken au citron
($12.50), or jumbo shrimp "Justine's"
($17.50). All are served with both soup and
salad.
As always, we saved plenty of room for
dessert. The creme caramel ($2.50), a light
custard covered with caramel sauce, was a
bit bland for our tastes. Our other choice,
Strawberries Romanoff ($4), fared better.
The strawberries and vanilla ice cream
doused with Grand Marnier were a fine
(though somewhat overpriced) ending to
the meal.
Thoughout the evening, our waiter
Jacques was very attentive. (Of course, we
noticed that he really didn't have much else
to do even though he was the only waiter
that night.) Our water glasses were never
less than half full, and Jacques timed our
entire meal very well.
Chez Justine is expecting a crowd for their
traditional Thanksgiving dinner — a lavish
buffet which is served between 12 p.m. and
8 p.m. Roasted Tom turkey with chestnut
dressing, Virginia baked cured ham in raisin
sauce and carved roast baron of beef with
mushroom sauce will be the three main
entrees. An assortment of salads, cheeses,
relishes and vegetables will also be offered.
A choice of dessert — pumpkin pie, choco
late mousse or caramel custard — will be in
cluded with the buffet. The price for this
feast is $12.95, and reservations are neces
sary.
