## Big Game show really a kick Gaieties has a winning attitude 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
If you think Big Game this
year is going to be a drag; if
the 1-9 season is getting you
down; if you're already plan
ning a trip to Berkeley on Sun
day to see the Axe, then go to
Gaieties 'Bi.
What the student body
doesn't have, Gaieties has.
What the alums don't have,
Gaieties has. What the coach
ing staff doesn't have, Gaieties
has. What the team doesn't
have, Gaieties has.
Gaieties has energy, enthus
iasm and a winning attitude.
Arranged in a revue format
punctuated by slide se
quences to allow for scene
changes, this year's Gaieties
Raiders of the Lost Axe spans
the history of Stanford — from
the death of little Leland to
little Herbie (Hoover) singing
a "Supply Side" number to

this year's Big Game and onto
a futuristic vision of Big Game
in the 21st century. There's no
real story line to the show
since characters aren't main
tained from scene to scene
but each segment is a gem.
The writers, headed by
Bruce Samuels, are dyed-in
the-wool Card partisans. Ihey
hate Cal. They love Stanford.
With their finally crafted script
they make the audience feel
the same way. The traditional
inside jokes needle everything
from Branner Hall freshmen to
the Wells Fargo Bank. The
fraternal feeling that the jokes
generate binds the audience
together in a frenzy of Beat Cal
hysteria.
But it doesn't stop there.
The singing and dancing wins
its way into your heart. The
dancing is enough to give the

football team a kick in the
pants. Girls are flung over
shoulders. University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy does a
song and dance for non
alcholic alternatives. The
chorus line numbers are
synchronized. The sensuality
of the "Working on the Rail
road" number by Mu Shu
Pork and the chorus makes
you shiver. Somehow
choreographer Brenda Branin
and director Renee Tenzel

have managed to get together
— with only six weeks rehear
sal — dance numbers that ac
tually look polished. Or, if
there are mistakes, they are
smoothly glossed over.
The only major criticism that
can be made of the show is
that it's a little bit too long. By
the time you get to Act Six, the
futuristic scene on Venus,
minds begin to wonder when
Dean Fred and the Band are

going to show up, or if they'
going to show up.
Finally, the show do«
climax in a terrific locker roo
scene featuring Joe Kap
leading a band of palsied foe
ball players and Paul Wiggii
the man with A Plan to . . . tl
Weenies.
If the hype of this year
Gaieties doesn't help the foo
ball team prevail this Saturd.
in Stanford Stadium the
nothing will.
