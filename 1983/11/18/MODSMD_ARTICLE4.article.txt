# Arafat 'a survivor,' expert says

### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat "is a great sur
vivor" who will ultimately repulse
Syrian-backed Palestinian rebels,
prompting Syria to abandon its s'ip
port of the dissidents, according to a
Columbia UrA rsity professor.
Prof. Edward Said, an expert on
the Middle Easi, told about 100
people at Toyon Hall yesterday that
"the days of the dissidents are num
bered" because Arafat enjoys "a
groundswell of support" for his role
in bringing the drive for a Palestin
ian state to international
prominence.
An Arafat victory would compel
the rebels to choose "death or

puppet-like employment in the
Syrian state," Said argued. "We are
at the end of an era during which
the Palestinian movement rose to
prominence."
Syrian-backed Palestinian rebels
overran the PLO's last stronghold at
the Beddawi refugee camp Wednes
day, sending Arafat and his fol
lowers fleeing into Tripoli,
Lebanon's second largest city.
Syria supports the dissidents be
cause it wants to control the PLO,
according to Said.
"The Syrian plan is to control the
PLO and strike a deal with Israel
brokered by the United States that
would include the division of
Lebanon and the termination of dis
cussion on the whole problem of
Palestinian nationalism," he said.

But this plan probably will fail, he
said.
"The major aspect of Arafat's
policy was to steer away from armed
conflict," Said asserted. "His was
the first genuinely popular Palestin
ian movement.
"My very strong suspicion is that
Palestinian nationalism has
progressed for too long, has
become a too significant movement
for it to be suddenly dismantled by a
military arrangement," Said argued.
The dissidents are soldiers and
ideologues who call for a military so
lution to the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict, the Columbia professor said.
But he admitted that they make
some valid criticisms of Arafat's
leadership.
Many Palestinians are concerned about the corrup
tion and cronyism practiced by some of Arafat's close
political associates, Said acknowledged.
Said sharply criticized Israeli and American policies
in the Middle East.

"Israeli policy since 1967 toward the Palestinians and
the Arab world is characteristic of a garrison state," he
said.
The Reagan administration has foolishly backed the
government of Lebanese President Amin Cemayel be
cause it is determined to thwart needed political reform
in Lebanon, Said claimed, adding that the United States
mistakenly thinks any reforms in the Third World will
lead to chaos.
