Humphrey Bogart squeezes

whose peculiar behavior
provokes his crew to mutiny.
He gives a terrific perfor

That Obscure Object of
Desire (1977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto '
tills Bunuel's last movie,
derived from Pierre louys'
novel The Woman and the
Puppet (Buntiei and lean-
Claude Carriere wrote the
script), concerns a middle
aged man the object of whose
• desire tempts and taunts him
,vyith unfulfilled promises of
sex.ual delight. Pecpetually

delayed sex is supposed to
function in this movie like per
petually delayed food did in
The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie: to satirize the de
pendency of those who are
, denied it. As an example of
technique, this film displays
dazzling sleight of hand, but
Bunuel gives so little away —
like why he cast two women
(Carole Bouquet and Angela
Molina) in the central female
role — that we end up more
frustrated than the hero
(Fernando Rey).
Plays Monday with Tristana.
The Big Chill (I<*B3)
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
A glib, empty movie about
the middle-aged crises of the
children of the '60s, written and
directed by Lawrence Kasdan
(Barbara Benedek collaborated
on the screenplay), in which
the jazzy montages suggest
rock videos artd the musical se
lections not only determine
the editing but also define the
content of each scene. A group
of college friends learns of the
suicide of one of their number
and gathers to mourn him and
re-examine their own lives. In
this movie about the triumph
of friendship over the scari
ness of the world outside, the
women are warm and maternal
and a little dopey, and the ul
timate sacrifice to propagate
the '60s spirit occurs when one
of them lets her husband sleep
with her best friend so that
she, too, can become a mot
her. jeft Goldblum and William
Hurt give the best perfor
mances; the cast also includes
Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, Mary
Kay Place. Tom Berenger,
Jobeth Williams and Meg Tilly.
Never Say Never Again
(1983)
Park, Menlo Park
This leisurely, laid-back spy

verse to those who go to it
seeking Ihe thrills available in
the best parts ot the The Spy
Who Loved Me and
Octopussy. but it's like aking

Kershn<?r, jhe director, chose a
sly, relaxed style to match
Lorenzo Semple's script, in
which ."M" (Edward Fox)
decides that Bond's taste for
rich .food and drink has worn
him down, and so he sends
him to a health clinsc. Kershner
works In such an unstressed

this movie about the triumph
of friendship over the scari
