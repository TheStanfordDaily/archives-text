Revenge
just before the triumphant Car
dinal crushes the Weenies in the
Stadium, the valiant Daily staffers
will meet their poor counterparts
from the Daily Californian on Roble

Field. Be there at 10:30 a.m. and get
revenge.
Banquet
The Friends of the Daily banquet
will be held SATURDAY at 5 p.m.
Those of Us who chose to attend

should arrive loaded, with lush, las
civious legions of loquacity so the
supercilious-much-too-good-to-be
-a-staff-writer won't have to tell
about the time his two favorite Louts
gave him a black eye, lounging lazily
while looking to Lunch on Loudly
Lynched Leech.
