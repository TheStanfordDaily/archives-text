French jets bomb guerrillas
Beirut, Lebanon — I rent h jets bombed, rocketed
and strafed Shiite Moslem guerrillas holed up in a
barracks and hotel in the Bekaa Valley yesterday in
reprisal for the suit ide attacks on French, U.S. and
Israeli troops. Lebanese polite said at least 39 were
killed and 150 wounded in the raids on camps of the
pro-Iranian extremists.
The French raids were mounted .1 day after Israeli
jets pounded the same area, leaving 41 dead, and
moments after a massive funeral procession in the
city of Baalbek during which a Shiite Moslem guerril
la leader threatened more sui< ide attacks against the
French, Americans and Israelis.
In Washington, U.S. of fit ials said they knew in ad

vance of the French strike, and a senior administra
tion official said that if the terrorists weren't wiped
out there "might well be" a need for the United
States to carry out an attack of its own.
Meanwhile, the Marines began replacing the U.S.
peacekeeping contingent that suffered 239 dead in
the suicide blast in Beirut airport Oct. 23. Fifty-eight
French paratroopers died moments later in a second
bombing, and 29 Israelis were killed in a third explo
sion in Tyre Nov. 4.
Committee rejects nerve gas funds
Washington — A House-Senate conference com
mittee yesterday buried President Reagan's hopes to
renew production of chemical weapons, rejecting
an administration request for $124.4 million for a
new arsenal of bombs and shells containing nerve
gas.
Completing two days of detailed negotiations on a
telephone book-sized piece of legislation that ap
propriates one quarter of a trillion dollars for the
Pentagon and the CIA to spend this fiscal year, the
conferees also agreed to provide $24 million — less
than Reagan sought, but more than House
Democrats had wanted to spend — for military aid
to "contra" guerrillas fighting the government of
Nicaragua.
The conferees' compromise version of the bill,
the Defense Appropriation Act for fiscal 1984, now
moves to final passage, possibly today, in both
houses, and then to the White House for signature.

U.S., Soviet vessels collide
Washington —A Soviet frigate collided with a
U.S. Navy destroyer in the northern Arabian Sea yes
terday, causing minor damage to the U.S. ship but
no casualties, Pentagon officials said yesterday.
They said the Soviet ship attempted to approach
too close to the carrier USS Ranger, when the
destroyer USS Fife attempted to head off the Soviet
ship, the sources said, the two ships grazed hulls.
Pentagon officials said they believed the incident
was the first collision between Soviet and U.S. war
ships in years. But they said close approaches and
apparent harassment by Soviet warships are becom
ing increasingly common.
Such incidents were particularly troublesome,
they said, in the Sea of Japan, where U.S. ships were
searching until recently for the wreckage of a
downed South Korean jetliner and frequently were
shadowed and bothered by Soviet ships.

Greyhound buses roll again
Two hundred Greyhound buses hit the nation's
roads again yesterday, light on passengers and run
ning gauntlets of angry and sometimes violent
strikers at bus terminals in major cities.
Police reported more than 60 arrests, most of
them in Boston, and several injuries as the nation's
largest intercity bus line — dubbed "The Dog" on
some picket signs — resumed service for the first
time since the strike by 12,700 Amalgamated Transit
Union employees started two weeks ago.
The worst incident was in San Francisco, where
several hundred striking workers turned out in a
downpour to fling rocks and bottles at the familiar
red-white-and-blue vehicles they called "scab
buses."
In Phoenix, the company headquarters, contract
negotiators limped along with the help of federal
mediators, and both sides said no settlement was in
sight.

Stocks rebound from decline
New York —The stock market, in virtual repeat of
the previous session, rebounded from a small
decline in late trading yesterday to post a modest
gain.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
precisely as it did Wednesday, 3.35 points to climb
to 1254.67 — its highest close since Oct. 17 when it
stood at 1268.70.
Advances led declines four to three on the New
York Stock Exchange, with several auto, oil service
and forest products issues moving ahead.
Big Board volume totaled 80.74 million shares,
against 83.38 million on Wednesday.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy after patchy morning fog. Highs in
the upper 50s to mid 60s.
