# Overcrowding at Frost cited
## Graduation may be moved

The University must act by Jan
uary on proposals aimed at
moving commencement from
Frost Amphitheater to a campus
site that could accommodate
larger crowds, according to Nan
Bentley, assistant director of
Events and Services.
The Oval, Stanford Stadium
and Sunken Diamond are alterna
tive locations under review by
Events and Services, the depart
ment coordinating commence
ment. Senior class presidents will
meet with Events and Services to
discuss the proposed change,
but no final decisions will be
made until the proposal is pre
sented to the University Adminis
trative Council next month.
"It's just too crowded in Frost
right now," explained Larry
Davidson, acting director of
Events and Services. "It's just not
pleasant when there are police
officers yelling at parents and
people very angry at ushers."
Commencement has been held
in Frost since the amphitheater
was built in 1937. The number of
degrees conferred has grown
from 1144 then to 4163 last year.
"Still no one has wanted to ac
knowledge that Stanford isn't the
small intimate university that it
used to be," Bentley said.
Last June 17,000 people
squeezed into a space intended

to hold 10,000 to hear Secretary
of State George Shultz deliver the
address to the graduates.
"The crowd was so dense that
if there was any emergency it
would be impossible to get
people in to help them," David
son said.
Currently each student is given
only three tickets for family and
friends, which makes it especially
difficult for students with large
families or two sets of parents.
Often students pay up to $75 for
extra tickets.
If commencement is moved,
the restrictions on tickets would
be much less rigid, according to
Davidson.
"The only purpose of tickets
might be to see how many chairs

to set up," he said.
If commencement is held in
the Oval, the audience would
face the Quad with a stage in the
bus stop area. The space would
hold almost an unlimited number
ot people, but they might have
difficulty seeing.
The Stadium could hold 25,000
people in the area between the
fences in front of the press box.
Parking and toilets would be easi
ly accessible.
The Sunken Diamond
represents a good compromise
between the Oval and the
Stadium, according to Davidson.
It would provide aesthetic
qualities lacking at the Stadium
and amenities lacking at the
Oval.
