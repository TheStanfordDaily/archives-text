## Kennedy says faculty unlikely to grant credit for ROTC soon 
### JEFF BIDDULPH 
It is unlikely that the faculty will
grant academic credit for Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC)
courses here in the near future, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
said last night to reporters in the
offices of KZSU.
ROTC courses, which are taught
by members of the armed services,
are not now granted University
credit because of a 1970 decision by
the Faculty Senate.
Kennedy said the senate decided
that "Stanford credit should not be
given for courses that had to be
taught by persons who are not
members of the Academic Council
and hence subject to Stanford's
quality control procedures . . . and I
very much doubt whether the fac
ulty is prepared to give on that
point."
ROTC members, who must now
travel to other campuses to take
their military training courses, have
been lobbying Kennedy to allow
credit for ROTC here, but the Uni
versity president has maintained
that the matter must be decided by
the Faculty Senate.
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president, told members of the Air
Force ROTC recently that the Uni
versity would give ROTC courses
class space. AFROTC instructors
have said they will not teach classes
here unless the courses are given
academic credit.
Kennedy also said the continued
denial of academic credit to ROTC is
not based on an anti-military philos
ophy.
"I reailv do .hia* its an issue of

who controls credit and who con
trols the quality of the educational
experience at Stanford. Is it the fac
ulty or is it some outside agency?"
Kennedy said.
At the campus conference, Ken
nedy also reiterated his belief that
the "chances are low" that the pro
posed Reagan library complex will
be approved by the Board of Trus
tees if a Hoover Institution-run
policy center is part of the plan. He
said a recent letter from Presidential
Counsellor Ed Meese to William
Kimball, the president of the Board,
contained "rather less flexibility
than we had hoped for."
The letter indicated that President
Reagan would not be satisfied with
anything less than the approval of
the entire complex, which includes
a Reagan library, museum and a
policy center administered by
Hoover. Kennedy has said,
however, that he favors the library, a
small museum and a policy center
administered by the University.
"I've argued that the presidential
library is a valuable resource and we
should bring it to Stanford," Ken
nedy said. "But university presi
dents very frequently find them
selves in the position of having to
look a gift horse in the mouth.
"It's a little awkward to have to
say about a splendid offer, 'Well,
let's look at all the attached condi
tions and see if the whole thing is in
the best interests of the University.'
I think that there's a condition at
tached to this one that is just plain
not in the best interests of this uni
versity and to the best of my belief

the Board agrees with me."
Kennedy also said he is expecting
an appeal Nov. 30 from Steven Mos
her, an anthropology student whose
doctoral candidacy here was ter
minated last spring when he was
studying in the Far East, but he
declined to comment on how he
would decide on the appeal.
"I shouldn't pre-judge an ap
peal," Kennedy said.
In July, Mosher was denied an ap
peal by Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells. Gerald
Lieberman, vice provost and dean of
graduate studies and research,
denied an earlier appeal by Mosher
in late September.
Mosher's appeal to Kennedy is
the graduate student's last resort
within the .diversity.
On the subject of the ABC-TV
docu-drama "The Day After," Ken
nedy, who gave the keynote address
at a recent conference here on nu
clear war sponsored by the
Physicians for Social Responsibility,
said he didn't agree with those who
would restrict children from seeing
the movie, which will be shown
Sunday evening.
"I think the threat of nuclear war
is very real in a world in which a
child of 11 can read the words
mutually assured destruction' in a
magazine and ask his mother what it
means. It seems that what it means
probably ought to be told and it
ought to be told graphically occa
sionally."
The campus conference will be
aired Monday at 7 p.m. on KZSU.
