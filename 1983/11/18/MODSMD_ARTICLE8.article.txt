Gearing up for the streets
In anticipation of the annual rally in San Francisco tonight, Simon Streets, drum major for the Leland
Stanford junior University Marching Band, leads his colleagues at another traditional event last night.
After Band members made their appearance at the end of Big Game Gaieties, they marched from
Memorial Auditorium through campus and ended up near Maples Pavilion where they honored
graduating football players, and stirred up student spirit for tomorrow's game against UC-Berkeley in
Stanford Stadium.
