## Students to fast to fight hunger 
### RACHANA KAMTEKAR 
"Hunger is dehumaniza
tion," says Awetu Simesso, an
Ethiopian student studying po
litical science here. "There is
nothing — not race, not class,
not ideology, not religion —
that can take the place of the
knowledge: People must eat."
And Simesso is doing some
thing about the problem.
Just before Thanksgiving
each year, Simesso and the
other members of the Stan
ford Committee on Hunger
organize a campus-wide fast
and a week of presentations
dealing with the problem of
global hunger.
Why the day of fasting?
Simesso says the goal of the
fast — planned for Tuesday —
isn't merely to raise con
sciousness or create empathy.
Rather, the committee on
hunger hopes "to help realize
the problem of hunger and to
raise money for a variety of
relief and development organ
izations."
Last year, Stanford raised
$7610.82. This year, the Stan
ford East Africa Relief Organi
zation (SEARO) is aiming for
$50,000.
East Africa is presently
facing its worst famine ever. In
20 countries, 20 million people
are now exposed to starvation
and the figure is expected to
reach 60 million by the 19905,
according to UNICEF experts.
Simesso says that Ethiopia's

position, although the worst
in the world, with 3.8 million
people literally starving to
death now, is not unique.
According to Simesso,
hunger is the world's worst
long-range problem. Both
global changes in weather that
are hitting tropical countries
hard and the nature of the po
litical economy of Third World
countries are big problems
that "will be with us for a
while," he says.
But organizers of the fast say
hunger isn't limited to Africa.
Arturo Barajas, a Colombian
graduate student at the Food
Research Institute describes
an experience from his high
school years in Bogota, Co
lombia.
"In high school, we had a
program to study a neighbor
hood next door. My high
school was situated in a very
nice area, on a hill that over
looked the rest of Bogota —
the view was beautiful and the
building was like an American
high school. Next door
though, there was what we
call an 'invasion neighbor
hood' of landless, homeless
people who build shelters
there with whatever they
could find: cardboard, tin,
boxes. The richer families
have a few bricks in their
homes," Barajas said.
"Most of the 3000 people
there are thieves, and they live
in mistrust of the rest of the

world. So many (outside)
people had come to question,
answer, budget and examine
their needs that by the time
we got there, they wouldn't
give us straight answers. We
tried to organize a women's
cooperative to knit blankets
and sweaters to supplement
their income, it was very diffi
cult and it took a long time.
The worst thing about it all
was that they'd lived this way
— in hunger and poverty —
tor so long that they couldn't
imagine another way of life, or
any way out of their situa
tion," he explained.
Senior Arturo Vargas said
that hunger isn't limited to
Third World nations; he said
that people are starving in the
United States as well.
He told of a family that came
to his church relief group in
inner city Los Angeles looking
for help around Christmas one
year.
"The whole family had been
living off Halloween candy all
that time. It was just too
humiliating to have to come
beg for charity," he explained.
Hunger means different
things to different people. To
Vargas, it means malnutrition.
To Simesso, it means the
equivalent in children of all of
Stanford's students dying
every single day from a lack of
food; it means brain damage
to the millions of men, women
and children who don't have

the good fortune to die right
away.
To Nazir Ahmad, a
Bangladeshi student at the
Food Research Institute,
"Hunger is not just a lack of
food, it is a failure of the
managers of society to provide
a bare minimum of existence
for its people."
How do these "managers of
society" respond to the
hunger around them in
poverty-stricken areas? Ah
mad once worked for a Chris
tian literacy program in
Bangladesh for working
children.
"We used to try to bring the
children to school, and we'd
give them high-calorie biscuits
— for nutrition and as an in
centive," Ahmad said. "One
day, the manager of the pro
gram pulled up in front of the
school in his air-conditioned
Plymouth station wagon, came
in, pinched the flesh on one
child's arm and said, 'You're
not starving.' And that was the
end of the relief for these
kids."
Vargas said that it is all too
easy for people to become
hardened when they constant
ly see people starving.
"People who live in the
new condominium belt
around inner city L.A. don't
ever have to walk into Skid
Row and see the hungry kids
playing amid busy traffic or
the old alcoholic men wasting
their lives away," Vargas said.
"The business offices are a
few blocks down, and that's
far enough for there to be no
contact. People don't want to
deal with hunger."
In some parts of the world,
Barajas said, people are
blamed for their own starva
tion.
"In Colombia, the attitude
is 'he's hungry only because
he doesn't want to work, and
he's choosing that way,' "
Barajas explained.
Vargas, Ahmad, Barajas and

Simesso have all spent ex
tended periods of time in
wealthy, food-filled environ
ments and then returned
home.
"The first thing I think when
I get off the plane in
Bangladesh is always, 'What
could that huge plane fare
have been better used for?' "
Ahmad said. "I'm a visitor
facing the problem— sort of
outside it — and I know you
can't keep reacting as strongly
to it constantly. But you know
you're becoming hardened
like the rest when you slip a
coin into a beggar's hand and
don't look to see his face."
"It's not that people don't
care — I think they do,"
Simesso explained. "It's just
very easy to forget about
removed issues like hunger in

Africa and become engrossed
in your own life unless you're
shocked into action. That only
happens in sensationalized
events, so people are always
giving for emergencies. But
the real problem lies much
deeper. Hunger is a long
range problem.
"But I think it's important to
realize that although never
before have we faced such an
enormous problem, also
never before have we been
aware of it or had the re
sources to deal with it,"
Simesso said.
"World hunger is our big
gest challenge today, because
it involves human resources. If
we lose those, we've lost it
all."
