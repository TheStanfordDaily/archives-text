So what's a Stanford's Challenge? Simple: if we alumni give
more to the Annual Fund, Stanford will earn up to $2 million in
matching gifts from the Irvine Foundation.
We will meet the Challenge and earn the $2 million if we all 1)
Give an Annual Fund gift of any amount. 2) Give every year. 3)
Increase our gifts whenever we can.
But we can't do it without you. Matching funds are awarded
only for a net increase in total annual giving.
What's more, your gift can be multiplied three ways: with
matching funds from the Challenge grant, through your employer's
matching program, and with a $25 per donor Challenge bonus if we
increase the number of donors by more than 10 percent.

this year.
Pretend there's an airplane towing a banner over your
house until you give.
We can't earn the full $2 million without your support.
Thanks from the Stanford Annual Fund,
