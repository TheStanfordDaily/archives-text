# 22 seniors to don cardinal, white for final time
## 
### JOHN LIS 
For 22 Stanford seniors,
today's game is not only the
traditional season finale for
the Cardinal, it is the final
game of their college careers.
Some have started for four
years and have reaped
numerous honors, while
others have played little
during their time on the Farm.
A few will go on to play profes-

sional football, while most
hang it up after this afternoon.
But for all 22, it will be the last
time they wear the cardinal
and-white in Stanford
Stadium.
Strong safety Vaughn Wil

liams leads the list of depart
ing seniors. An AII-Pac-10 se
lection the past two seasons,
Williams was named a pre
season All-America by The
Sporting News this year.
The 6-foot-2-inch, 189-
pound Williams was Stanford's
leading tackier last season
with 94 stops, including 63
solos and is second this year
behind sophomore

linebacker Dave Wyman
with 71 so far. Williams had
three interceptions in 1982, in
cluding one he returned 36
yards for a touchdown against
Arizona, and has three this
season.

Flanker Mike Tolliver is the
Cardinal's leading senior on
offense. Tolliver leads Stan
ford receivers with 57 catches
thus far in 1983, good for the
15th spot in the nation.
The 6-0, 175-pound Tolliver
is fifth on the all-time Stanford
receiving list with 123 career
receptions, and his 1803
career receiving yards is
fourth best in Stanford his
tory. Tolliver has 14 career
touchdowns, which ties him
for sixth on the all-time list.
Left cornerback Kevin Baird
is one of only two four-year
starters on this year's squad
Williams being the other.
Baird led the Cardinal in inter
ceptions his sophomore year
with three including a 35-
yard touchdown return
against Oregon State and
had three last season and one
so far this year.
Baird had 75 tackles his
sophomore year, 77 last
season, and has 55 to date in
1983. The best game for the 6-
0, 192-pound fifth-year player
came last year against Ohio
State when he had two inter
ceptions, three pass deflec
tions and 10 tackles as the Car
dinal pulled off a 23-20 upset.
Defensive end john Bergren
has started the past three
seasons for the Cardinal.
Bergren had five sacks in 1982
and has 3.5 coming into today.
Bergren had 60 tackles as a
sophomore, 68 last year, and
has 64 so far in 1983.
On top of his on-the-fi6ld
achievements, Bergren has

maintained a 3.9 grade point
average as an engineering
major, and he has been
named an Academic Ail-
American the past two
seasons.
Offensive tackle Jeff Deaton
has anchored the offensive
line for the past two seasons.

Head Coach Paul Wiggin has
said that Deaton could be a
No. 1 pro draft pick, and went
so far as to say, "He could
probably play pro ball right
now." Wiggin went on to call
the 6-3, 270-pound Deaton
"probably the best player on

Game. In the 1981 clash, Hutchings intercepted a pass and returned it
for a touchdown, leading the way to a 42-21 Cardinal win.

Stanford will be relying on senior defensive tackle Pat Mitchel and the
rest of the Cardinal defensive line to put pressure on Cal quarterback
Gale Gilbert and the Bear passing attack.
the 1983 team."
Defensive tackle Pat Mitchel
started seven games as a soph
omore, then played every
game last season, when he
had 23 tackles and a sack. So
far in 1983, the 6-5, 243-pound
Mitchel has 40 tackles and one
sack.
Free safety Charles Hutch
ings is the third senior in the
Stanford secondary. Hutch
ings led the Cardinal in inter
ceptions in 1982 with five
thefts, and he has one this
season. The 6-3, 206-pound
Hutchings had 67 tackles last
season, and has 45 this year.
Tripp Hardin has been the
Cardinal's starting punter
since the third game of last
season. In nine games last
year, Hardin kicked 48 times
for a 39.6 yard average. This
season he has punted 63 times
for a 41.7 yard average.
Offensive tackle Steve
Aimonetti moved into a start
ing role this season after
having played both center and
guard over the past three
seasons. Aimonetti also bench
presses 440 pounds, the high
est on the team.
Jim Clymer has moved in
and out of the starting tight
end position this year. The 6-4,
243-pound Clymer is slated to

start this afternoon. He has 15
catches this year for 167 yards
coming into today's contest.
Quarterback Steve Cottrell
is one of two seniors whose
final year was cut short by in
juries. The 5-10, 185-pound
Cottrell underwent ankle sur
gery following the USC game.
Cottrell had started the first
three games this season until
he was replaced by freshman
John Paye.
Before this year, Cottrell
had served as back-up to John
Elway. In seven games this
season, Cottrell completed 60
of 122 passes (49.1 percent) for
831 yards and five touch
downs, throwing seven inter
ceptions.
Also out is senior Rob
Moore. The starting fullback
until a recurring knee injury
necessitated surgery, the 6-1,
217-pound, fifth-year player
gained 59 yards in 14 rushes
this season. Moore saw sub
stantial action all five years,
but injuries prevented him
from ever finishing a season.
Flanker Eric Mullins has 39
career catches despite playing
behind Tolliver. This year the
5-11,178-pound Mullins has 14
receptions for 252 yards and a
touchdown. His longest
career catch is a 51 -yard touch
down against Oregon State.
Wide receiver Steve Brown
has never started at Stanford,
having played behind stand
outs Ken Margerum, Tolliver,
and junior Emile Harry. Com
ing into this year Brown had
only two career receptions,
both for touchdowns a 40-
yard grab against Arizona State
in 1981 and a 35-yarder last
year against Washington. The
6-2, 180-pound fifth-year man
has one catch this year for 15
yards.
Split end Don Lonsinger is
also playing in a back-up role
this season. The 6-3, 187-
pound fifth-year player started
three games in 1981, when he
caught 13 passes for 185 yards.
This season Lonsinger has four
catches for 95 yards, including
a diving 457 yard touchdown
grab against UCLA.
Strong safety Steve Lemon
has backed up Williams the
past two seasons, but started

seven games at free safety in
1981, when he had 34 tackles.
This season the 5-11, 186-
pound Lemon has 14 tackles.
Defensive end Don Stub
blefield has played behind
Bergren most of this season.
The 6-5, 230-pound Stub
blefield started eight games as
a sophomore and four as a
junior at inside linebacker. He
had 42 tackles last season, and
he has 19 this year..
Offensive tackle Ken Orvick
has backed up Deaton at left
tackle this season after having
originally been recruited as a
guard. The 6-4, 267-pound Or
vick did start against San Jose
State his sophomore season.
Left cornerback Derek
Whittle moved into the back
up slot behind Kevin Baird this
past spring, and in doing so
earned himself a scholarship
for the first time. The 5-11,
178-pound fifth-year man has
not played much throughout

his career.
Strong safety Barry Cromer
has made a sizeable contribu
tion to the squad through his
special teams play. The 6-0,
190-pound walk-on made
eight tackles last year and has
five more this season on the
kickoff and punt teams.
Cromer is also an inspirational
leader, having been chosen
special teams captain several
times this year.
Outside linebacker Frank
Dispalatro has been plagued
by injuries throughout his
career. The 6-3, 233-pound
fifth-year player made seven
tackles last year and has two
this season in limited playing
time.
Split end Bill Pimental is
listed at the No. 3-spot on the
depth chart. A 5-10,153-pound
walk-on, Pimental has yet to
make a catch at Stanford.
Pimental has played some on
the special teams this season.

Cromer is also an inspirational
leader, having been chosen
special teams captain several
times this year.

For 22 Stanford seniors,
today's game is not only the
traditional season finale for

others have played little
during their time on the Farm.
A few will go on to play profes-

hang it up after this afternoon.
But for all 22, it will be the last
time they wear the cardinal

Williams being the other.

with three including a 35-
yard touchdown return
against Oregon State and
had three last season and one
so far this year.
Baird had 75 tackles his
sophomore year, 77 last
season, and has 55 to date in
1983. The best game for the 6-

achievements, Bergren has

maintained a 3.9 grade point
average as an engineering
major, and he has been
named an Academic Ail-
American the past two
seasons.
Offensive tackle Jeff Deaton
has anchored the offensive
line for the past two seasons.

Head Coach Paul Wiggin has
said that Deaton could be a
No. 1 pro draft pick, and went
so far as to say, "He could
probably play pro ball right
now." Wiggin went on to call
the 6-3, 270-pound Deaton
"probably the best player on
