# 22 seniors to don cardinal, white for final time
## 
### JOHN LIS 
For 22 Stanford seniors,
today's game is not only the
traditional season finale for
the Cardinal, it is the final
game of their college careers.
Some have started for four
years and have reaped
numerous honors, while
others have played little
during their time on the Farm.
A few will go on to play profes-

sional football, while most
hang it up after this afternoon.
But for all 22, it will be the last
time they wear the cardinal
and-white in Stanford
Stadium.
Strong safety Vaughn Wil

liams leads the list of depart
ing seniors. An AII-Pac-10 se
lection the past two seasons,
Williams was named a pre
season All-America by The
Sporting News this year.
The 6-foot-2-inch, 189-
pound Williams was Stanford's
leading tackier last season
with 94 stops, including 63
solos and is second this year
behind sophomore

linebacker Dave Wyman
with 71 so far. Williams had
three interceptions in 1982, in
cluding one he returned 36
yards for a touchdown against
Arizona, and has three this
season.

Flanker Mike Tolliver is the
Cardinal's leading senior on
offense. Tolliver leads Stan
ford receivers with 57 catches
thus far in 1983, good for the
15th spot in the nation.
The 6-0, 175-pound Tolliver
is fifth on the all-time Stanford
receiving list with 123 career
receptions, and his 1803
career receiving yards is
fourth best in Stanford his
tory. Tolliver has 14 career
touchdowns, which ties him
for sixth on the all-time list.
Left cornerback Kevin Baird
is one of only two four-year
starters on this year's squad
Williams being the other.
Baird led the Cardinal in inter
ceptions his sophomore year
with three including a 35-
yard touchdown return
against Oregon State and
had three last season and one
so far this year.
Baird had 75 tackles his
sophomore year, 77 last
season, and has 55 to date in
1983. The best game for the 6-
0, 192-pound fifth-year player
came last year against Ohio
State when he had two inter
ceptions, three pass deflec
tions and 10 tackles as the Car
dinal pulled off a 23-20 upset.
Defensive end john Bergren
has started the past three
seasons for the Cardinal.
Bergren had five sacks in 1982
and has 3.5 coming into today.
Bergren had 60 tackles as a
sophomore, 68 last year, and
has 64 so far in 1983.
On top of his on-the-fi6ld
achievements, Bergren has

maintained a 3.9 grade point
average as an engineering
major, and he has been
named an Academic Ail-
American the past two
seasons.
Offensive tackle Jeff Deaton
has anchored the offensive
line for the past two seasons.

Head Coach Paul Wiggin has
said that Deaton could be a
No. 1 pro draft pick, and went
so far as to say, "He could
probably play pro ball right
now." Wiggin went on to call
the 6-3, 270-pound Deaton
"probably the best player on

DEJA VU?: Senior Charles Hutchings already has fond memories of Big
Game. In the 1981 clash, Hutchings intercepted a pass and returned it
for a touchdown, leading the way to a 42-21 Cardinal win.

Stanford will be relying on senior defensive tackle Pat Mitchel and the
rest of the Cardinal defensive line to put pressure on Cal quarterback
Gale Gilbert and the Bear passing attack.
