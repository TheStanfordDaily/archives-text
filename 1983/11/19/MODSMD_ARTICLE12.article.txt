# The
						86th Big Game
## Writer finds differing post-Big Game plans 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
I was sitting out in front of
Tresidder Union with a pencil
and a pad when I noticed that
some interesting people were
passing by with great
regularity. Being a reporter, I
could not let the opportunity
pass without taking advantage
of it. Quickly I had to think of
a question which all would be
interested in, and I came up
with the following: What did
you do after last year's Big
Game and what are your plans
for after this year's game?
Paul Wiggin (Stanford foot
ball coach): Last year we rode
the bus across the bay and I
went to bed and pulled the
covers over my head. I don't
have any plans this year.
Emile Harry (Stanford's star
receiver): Went to dinner. I
didn't go to sleep. That's
about it. This year, win or lose,

I'm going to have fun either
way. But we ain't going to
lose.

Fred Hargadon (dean of ad
missions): I don't know what I
did, probably read a good
book. I usually try to lose
myself in something. I erijoy
the games and when they're
over, I like to do something

completely different.
Robert Polhemus (chairman
of the English Department): I
appropriately went to a fu
neral that day. Let's hope I am
not invited to another one this
year.

Gerald Lieberman (vice
provost and dean of graduate
studies at Stanford): I drowned
my sorrows at a restaurant in
Ghirardelli Square. This year

'/ walked all by my
self in a depressed
mood to the Bart
Station. I read a
book which I
brought to the Big
Game to distract
myself from the hor
ror of the ending/
