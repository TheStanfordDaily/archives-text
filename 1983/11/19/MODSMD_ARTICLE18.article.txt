# 1-10 or 2-9 season-there's not a big difference
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Football teams are supposed to improve over the
course of the season.
But at Stanford in 1983, this hasn't happened.
While Stanford has had the sixth toughest schedule
in the nation according to the NCAA, the easiest part of
it has been the second half, during which the Cardinal
has still lost.
The John Elway and Vincent White-less 1983 version
of Stanford football was supposed to get beaten up in
the first half of its schedule. It did. But by the time the
Card reached the latter portion of the schedule, it was
supposed to be the one doing the beating up. That
never happened.
After a 31-22 upset of then-No. 19 ranked Arizona
gave Stanford its first win of the season and broke a
nine-game losing streak dating back to last year, there
was talk the Card could win its next four games against
Oregon State, USC, Oregon and California all teams
with losing records at the time and finish at 5-6.
Head Coach Paul Wiggin might save himself the trouble
of updating his resume.
As it turned out, though, the Arizona game was an all
too brief respite in the storm. The worse was yet to
come.
And when it rained, it poured.
Wiggin and his troops travelled to foggy Packer
Stadium in Corvallis, Ore., the week after the Arizona
upset and lost to the hapless Oregon State Beavers.
Stanford fans started wondering if Wiggin's warriors
could play much worse. A week later in the Los Angeles
Coliseum against a horrible USC Trojan squad, they an
swered that question yes.
But the USC game, nonetheless, was not the worst.
Just ask anyone of 30,000 fans that showed up for Stan
ford's latest effort in futility last week's 16-7 loss to
Oregon.
And now, with just today's game against UC-Berkeley
left, there is not much Stanford can do to salvage what
has become the most miserable of miserable seasons.
There is not a whole lot of difference between 1-10 and
2-9.
Even if the Card upsets Cal today, it will still finish
with its poorest record in 23 years, when the Jack

Curtice-coached Stanford team went 0-10 in 1960.
Below is a game-by-game rundown of the season that
Stanford, and especially the recently-resigned Wiggin,
would just as soon forget.
Oklahoma 27, at Stanford 14
The Stanford defense did a job on Oklahoma's Heis
man Trophy candidate Marcus Dupree and held him to
under than 15D yards. But the Sooners had other run
ners and, all told, racked up 395 yards on the ground.
In comparison, Stanford rushed for a sterling minus
one yards on 22 carries.
The 62, 778 on hand for the season opener, however,
did get their first glimpse of freshman quarterback John
Paye, who replaced senior starter Steve Cottrell in the
second half and drove Stanford to its second touch
down. On the Card's next series, Paye again took the
offense down the field, but tight end Jim Clymer
fumbled on a 42-yard pass play and any upset hopes
Stanford had vanished as quickly as the ball did from
Clymer's hands.
At Illinois 17, Stanford 7
While the Fighting lllini certainly did not look like the
Rose Bowl-bound team they are now, Coach Mike
White got the job done. Or, to be more accurate, Stan
ford got the job done for him.
Ten Stanford penalties for 115 yards negated 160
yards in gains, including a 46-yard bomb from Paye to
receiver Emile Harry on the first play of the game. Stan
ford did manage to tie the score briefly at 7-7 in the
second quarter, but Cardinal Trip Hardin had a punt
blocked in his own end zone. Illinois recovered to
make the score 14-7. Chris White, the son of the lllini
coach, added a second-half field goal to complete the
scoring.
San Jose State 23, at Stanford 10
Spartan Head Coach Jack Elway, father of former
Stanford quarterback John Elway, beat Wiggin and the
Cardinal for the third straight year in this annual Penin
sula rivalry. San Jose State had a near perfect balance of
passing and running, rushing for 234 yards and throw

ing for 211, as quarterback Jon Carlson completed 20
of 33 tosses.
The game was never close as the Spartans marched
60 yards on their first possession for a touchdown,
largely on the success of misdirection plays. For Stan
ford, its problems began before the game even started.
The Card was penalized 10 yards because the Stanford
Band was on the field too long before the opening kick
off.
At Arizona State 29, Stanford 11
What should have been just another one-sided loss
for Stanford exploded into a wild post-game contro
versy, as Wiggin indirectly accused Arizona State Coach
Darryl Rogers as trying to run up the score. Rogers let
his place kicker, Luis Zendejas, attempt field goals
twice in the final 11 seconds of the game in an effort to
tie a NCAA single-game field goal record. Zendejas,
who kicked a Pac-10 record five in the game, missed
both his late-game tries.
Otherwise, the game was as unexciting as Stanford's
first three. For the third week in a row, the Stan
ford offense managed to score just one touchdown.
UCLA 39, At Stanford 21
Stanford at last found an offense that scored more
than one touchdown in a game. In fact, the Card scored
five TDs in the contest against the Bruins. The only
problem was two of those six-pointers were for the
other team. All told, Stanford turned the ball over
seven times in the game, including two interceptions
that were returned for touchdowns.
UCLA starting qwarterback Steve Bono left the game
early with a separated shoulder, but his replacement,
senior Tom Neuheisel stepped in to lead the Bruins to
28 fourth-quarter points and overcome a 21-13 Stanford
advantage.
At Washington 32, Stanford 15
Don't be deceived by the score. This one wasn't even
close to being close. The Huskies rolled up 465 yards in
total offense while holding Paye to 13 aerial yards, as
the freshman quarterback completed just 4 of 16
passes before giving way to Cottrell. At one point,
Washington led 32-3 and, because they give up the ball
two more times deep in Stanford territory, it just as
easily could have been 46-3.
Husky running back Sterling Hinds, a native of
Canada, raced through the Stanford defense for 188
yards on 26 carries, an average of 7.2 yards per attempt.
The only bright spot for the Card was the fullback
Kaulana Park, who rushed for 75 yards on nine carries.
At Stanford 31, Arizona 22
Stanford played by far its best game of the season, as
all the parts especially the offensive ones came
together against a flat Arizona team, one serving a
NCAA probation that disallows it to play in a post
season bowl game. Paye was nearly perfect that day,
dazzling the 40,000 plus fans with a passing perfor
mance that rivalled John Elway's best efforts. Paye com
pleted 22 of 28 passes for 280 yards and three touch
downs.
The victory was Stanford's first of the season and
snapped a nine-game losing streak dating back to last
year. Ironically, the Card ended the streak against the
team that started it. Arizona beat Stanford on Nov. 6,
1982, to commence its longest losing skid since 1960.

At Oregon State 31, Stanford 18
The Beavers won their first Pac-10 game in over four
years. It was also their first victory over a Division I foot
ball team in 28 games. Enough said.
At USC 30, Stanford 7
On USC's first play from scrimmage, the Trojans
hoodwinked the Card defense by throwing a fullback
pass. Wide receiver Timmie Ware was wide open 35
yards downfield and waltzed into the end zone with
Kennedy Pola's pass to make the score 7-0 and for all
practical purposes the game was over.
The demoralized Stanford team made its usual
mistakes and virtually handed the Trojans its first three
touchdowns. In fact, midway through the second quar
ter with the scoreboard showing USC in front 21-0, the
Trojans had just one net rushing yard. Stanford averted
its first shut-out since USC beat it 49-0 in 1977 with a
fourth-quarter Steve Cottrell-to-Shawn Avant 48-yard
touchdown pass play.
Oregon 16, Stanford 7
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger officially con
firmed Wiggin's resignation the Friday morning before
the game. And whatever effect Wiggin's announce
ment on the Card, it wasn't a positive one. Stanford
came out playing its flattest (and probably worst) foot
ball of the season, succumbing to an injury-ridden
Duck team.
The game marked what probably can be referred to
as the lowpoint in Stanford football.
Football teams are supposed to improve over the
course of the season.

Band was on the field too long before the opening kick
off.
At Arizona State 29, Stanford 11
What should have been just another one-sided loss
for Stanford exploded into a wild post-game contro
versy, as Wiggin indirectly accused Arizona State Coach
Darryl Rogers as trying to run up the score. Rogers let
his place kicker, Luis Zendejas, attempt field goals
twice in the final 11 seconds of the game in an effort to
tie a NCAA single-game field goal record. Zendejas,
who kicked a Pac-10 record five in the game, missed
both his late-game tries.
Otherwise, the game was as unexciting as Stanford's
first three. For the third week in a row, the Stan
ford offense managed to score just one touchdown.
UCLA 39, At Stanford 21
Stanford at last found an offense that scored more
than one touchdown in a game. In fact, the Card scored
five TDs in the contest against the Bruins. The only
problem was two of those six-pointers were for the
other team. All told, Stanford turned the ball over
seven times in the game, including two interceptions
that were returned for touchdowns.
UCLA starting qwarterback Steve Bono left the game
early with a separated shoulder, but his replacement,
senior Tom Neuheisel stepped in to lead the Bruins to
28 fourth-quarter points and overcome a 21-13 Stanford
advantage.
At Washington 32, Stanford 15
Don't be deceived by the score. This one wasn't even
close to being close. The Huskies rolled up 465 yards in
total offense while holding Paye to 13 aerial yards, as
the freshman quarterback completed just 4 of 16
passes before giving way to Cottrell. At one point,
Washington led 32-3 and, because they give up the ball
two more times deep in Stanford territory, it just as
easily could have been 46-3.
Husky running back Sterling Hinds, a native of
Canada, raced through the Stanford defense for 188
yards on 26 carries, an average of 7.2 yards per attempt.
The only bright spot for the Card was the fullback
Kaulana Park, who rushed for 75 yards on nine carries.
At Stanford 31, Arizona 22
Stanford played by far its best game of the season, as
all the parts especially the offensive ones came
together against a flat Arizona team, one serving a
NCAA probation that disallows it to play in a post
season bowl game. Paye was nearly perfect that day,
dazzling the 40,000 plus fans with a passing perfor
mance that rivalled John Elway's best efforts. Paye com
pleted 22 of 28 passes for 280 yards and three touch
downs.
The victory was Stanford's first of the season and
snapped a nine-game losing streak dating back to last
year. Ironically, the Card ended the streak against the
team that started it. Arizona beat Stanford on Nov. 6,
1982, to commence its longest losing skid since 1960.

At Oregon State 31, Stanford 18
The Beavers won their first Pac-10 game in over four
years. It was also their first victory over a Division I foot
ball team in 28 games. Enough said.
At USC 30, Stanford 7
On USC's first play from scrimmage, the Trojans
hoodwinked the Card defense by throwing a fullback
pass. Wide receiver Timmie Ware was wide open 35
yards downfield and waltzed into the end zone with
Kennedy Pola's pass to make the score 7-0 and for all
practical purposes the game was over.
The demoralized Stanford team made its usual
mistakes and virtually handed the Trojans its first three
touchdowns. In fact, midway through the second quar
ter with the scoreboard showing USC in front 21-0, the
Trojans had just one net rushing yard. Stanford averted
its first shut-out since USC beat it 49-0 in 1977 with a
fourth-quarter Steve Cottrell-to-Shawn Avant 48-yard
touchdown pass play.
Oregon 16, Stanford 7
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger officially con
firmed Wiggin's resignation the Friday morning before
the game. And whatever effect Wiggin's announce
ment on the Card, it wasn't a positive one. Stanford
came out playing its flattest (and probably worst) foot
ball of the season, succumbing to an injury-ridden
Duck team.
The game marked what probably can be referred to
as the lowpoint in Stanford football.
Football teams are supposed to improve over the
course of the season.
But at Stanford in 1983, this hasn't happened.
While Stanford has had the sixth toughest schedule
in the nation according to the NCAA, the easiest part of
it has been the second half, during which the Cardinal
has still lost.
The John Elway and Vincent White-less 1983 version
of Stanford football was supposed to get beaten up in
the first half of its schedule. It did. But by the time the
Card reached the latter portion of the schedule, it was
supposed to be the one doing the beating up. That
never happened.
After a 31-22 upset of then-No. 19 ranked Arizona
gave Stanford its first win of the season and broke a
nine-game losing streak dating back to last year, there
was talk the Card could win its next four games against
Oregon State, USC, Oregon and California all teams
with losing records at the time and finish at 5-6.
Head Coach Paul Wiggin might save himself the trouble
of updating his resume.
As it turned out, though, the Arizona game was an all
too brief respite in the storm. The worse was yet to
come.
And when it rained, it poured.
Wiggin and his troops travelled to foggy Packer
Stadium in Corvallis, Ore., the week after the Arizona
upset and lost to the hapless Oregon State Beavers.
Stanford fans started wondering if Wiggin's warriors
could play much worse. A week later in the Los Angeles
Coliseum against a horrible USC Trojan squad, they an
swered that question yes.
But the USC game, nonetheless, was not the worst.
Just ask anyone of 30,000 fans that showed up for Stan
ford's latest effort in futility last week's 16-7 loss to
Oregon.
And now, with just today's game against UC-Berkeley
left, there is not much Stanford can do to salvage what
has become the most miserable of miserable seasons.
There is not a whole lot of difference between 1-10 and
2-9.
Even if the Card upsets Cal today, it will still finish
with its poorest record in 23 years, when the Jack

Curtice-coached Stanford team went 0-10 in 1960.
Below is a game-by-game rundown of the season that
Stanford, and especially the recently-resigned Wiggin,
would just as soon forget.
Oklahoma 27, at Stanford 14
The Stanford defense did a job on Oklahoma's Heis
man Trophy candidate Marcus Dupree and held him to
under than 15D yards. But the Sooners had other run
ners and, all told, racked up 395 yards on the ground.
In comparison, Stanford rushed for a sterling minus
one yards on 22 carries.
The 62, 778 on hand for the season opener, however,
did get their first glimpse of freshman quarterback John
Paye, who replaced senior starter Steve Cottrell in the
second half and drove Stanford to its second touch
down. On the Card's next series, Paye again took the
offense down the field, but tight end Jim Clymer
fumbled on a 42-yard pass play and any upset hopes
Stanford had vanished as quickly as the ball did from
Clymer's hands.
At Illinois 17, Stanford 7
While the Fighting lllini certainly did not look like the
Rose Bowl-bound team they are now, Coach Mike
White got the job done. Or, to be more accurate, Stan
ford got the job done for him.
Ten Stanford penalties for 115 yards negated 160
yards in gains, including a 46-yard bomb from Paye to
receiver Emile Harry on the first play of the game. Stan
ford did manage to tie the score briefly at 7-7 in the
second quarter, but Cardinal Trip Hardin had a punt
blocked in his own end zone. Illinois recovered to
make the score 14-7. Chris White, the son of the lllini
coach, added a second-half field goal to complete the
scoring.
San Jose State 23, at Stanford 10
Spartan Head Coach Jack Elway, father of former
Stanford quarterback John Elway, beat Wiggin and the
Cardinal for the third straight year in this annual Penin
sula rivalry. San Jose State had a near perfect balance of
passing and running, rushing for 234 yards and throw

ing for 211, as quarterback Jon Carlson completed 20
of 33 tosses.
The game was never close as the Spartans marched
60 yards on their first possession for a touchdown,
largely on the success of misdirection plays. For Stan
ford, its problems began before the game even started.
The Card was penalized 10 yards because the Stanford
Band was on the field too long before the opening kick
off.
At Arizona State 29, Stanford 11

in the nation according to the NCAA, the easiest part of
it has been the second half, during which the Cardinal
has still lost.
The John Elway and Vincent White-less 1983 version
of Stanford football was supposed to get beaten up in
the first half of its schedule. It did. But by the time the
Card reached the latter portion of the schedule, it was
supposed to be the one doing the beating up. That
never happened.
After a 31-22 upset of then-No. 19 ranked Arizona
gave Stanford its first win of the season and broke a
nine-game losing streak dating back to last year, there
was talk the Card could win its next four games against
Oregon State, USC, Oregon and California all teams
with losing records at the time and finish at 5-6.
Head Coach Paul Wiggin might save himself the trouble
of updating his resume.
As it turned out, though, the Arizona game was an all
too brief respite in the storm. The worse was yet to
come.
And when it rained, it poured.
Wiggin and his troops travelled to foggy Packer
Stadium in Corvallis, Ore., the week after the Arizona
upset and lost to the hapless Oregon State Beavers.
Stanford fans started wondering if Wiggin's warriors
could play much worse. A week later in the Los Angeles
Coliseum against a horrible USC Trojan squad, they an
swered that question yes.
But the USC game, nonetheless, was not the worst.
Just ask anyone of 30,000 fans that showed up for Stan
ford's latest effort in futility last week's 16-7 loss to
Oregon.
And now, with just today's game against UC-Berkeley
left, there is not much Stanford can do to salvage what
has become the most miserable of miserable seasons.
There is not a whole lot of difference between 1-10 and
2-9.
Even if the Card upsets Cal today, it will still finish
with its poorest record in 23 years, when the Jack

Curtice-coached Stanford team went 0-10 in 1960.
Below is a game-by-game rundown of the season that
Stanford, and especially the recently-resigned Wiggin,
would just as soon forget.
Oklahoma 27, at Stanford 14
The Stanford defense did a job on Oklahoma's Heis
man Trophy candidate Marcus Dupree and held him to
under than 15D yards. But the Sooners had other run
ners and, all told, racked up 395 yards on the ground.
In comparison, Stanford rushed for a sterling minus
one yards on 22 carries.
The 62, 778 on hand for the season opener, however,
did get their first glimpse of freshman quarterback John
Paye, who replaced senior starter Steve Cottrell in the
second half and drove Stanford to its second touch
down. On the Card's next series, Paye again took the
offense down the field, but tight end Jim Clymer
fumbled on a 42-yard pass play and any upset hopes
Stanford had vanished as quickly as the ball did from
Clymer's hands.
At Illinois 17, Stanford 7
While the Fighting lllini certainly did not look like the
Rose Bowl-bound team they are now, Coach Mike
White got the job done. Or, to be more accurate, Stan
ford got the job done for him.
Ten Stanford penalties for 115 yards negated 160
yards in gains, including a 46-yard bomb from Paye to
receiver Emile Harry on the first play of the game. Stan
ford did manage to tie the score briefly at 7-7 in the
second quarter, but Cardinal Trip Hardin had a punt
blocked in his own end zone. Illinois recovered to
make the score 14-7. Chris White, the son of the lllini
coach, added a second-half field goal to complete the
scoring.
San Jose State 23, at Stanford 10
Spartan Head Coach Jack Elway, father of former
Stanford quarterback John Elway, beat Wiggin and the
Cardinal for the third straight year in this annual Penin
sula rivalry. San Jose State had a near perfect balance of
passing and running, rushing for 234 yards and throw

ing for 211, as quarterback Jon Carlson completed 20
of 33 tosses.
The game was never close as the Spartans marched
60 yards on their first possession for a touchdown,
largely on the success of misdirection plays. For Stan
ford, its problems began before the game even started.
The Card was penalized 10 yards because the Stanford
Band was on the field too long before the opening kick
off.
At Arizona State 29, Stanford 11
What should have been just another one-sided loss
for Stanford exploded into a wild post-game contro
versy, as Wiggin indirectly accused Arizona State Coach
Darryl Rogers as trying to run up the score. Rogers let
his place kicker, Luis Zendejas, attempt field goals
twice in the final 11 seconds of the game in an effort to
tie a NCAA single-game field goal record. Zendejas,
who kicked a Pac-10 record five in the game, missed
both his late-game tries.
Otherwise, the game was as unexciting as Stanford's
first three. For the third week in a row, the Stan
ford offense managed to score just one touchdown.
UCLA 39, At Stanford 21
Stanford at last found an offense that scored more
than one touchdown in a game. In fact, the Card scored
five TDs in the contest against the Bruins. The only
problem was two of those six-pointers were for the
other team. All told, Stanford turned the ball over
seven times in the game, including two interceptions
that were returned for touchdowns.
UCLA starting qwarterback Steve Bono left the game
early with a separated shoulder, but his replacement,
senior Tom Neuheisel stepped in to lead the Bruins to
28 fourth-quarter points and overcome a 21-13 Stanford
advantage.
At Washington 32, Stanford 15
Don't be deceived by the score. This one wasn't even
close to being close. The Huskies rolled up 465 yards in
total offense while holding Paye to 13 aerial yards, as
the freshman quarterback completed just 4 of 16
passes before giving way to Cottrell. At one point,
Washington led 32-3 and, because they give up the ball
two more times deep in Stanford territory, it just as
easily could have been 46-3.
Husky running back Sterling Hinds, a native of
Canada, raced through the Stanford defense for 188
yards on 26 carries, an average of 7.2 yards per attempt.
The only bright spot for the Card was the fullback
Kaulana Park, who rushed for 75 yards on nine carries.
At Stanford 31, Arizona 22
Stanford played by far its best game of the season, as
all the parts especially the offensive ones came
together against a flat Arizona team, one serving a
NCAA probation that disallows it to play in a post
season bowl game. Paye was nearly perfect that day,
dazzling the 40,000 plus fans with a passing perfor
mance that rivalled John Elway's best efforts. Paye com
pleted 22 of 28 passes for 280 yards and three touch
downs.
The victory was Stanford's first of the season and
snapped a nine-game losing streak dating back to last
year. Ironically, the Card ended the streak against the
team that started it. Arizona beat Stanford on Nov. 6,
1982, to commence its longest losing skid since 1960.

At Oregon State 31, Stanford 18
The Beavers won their first Pac-10 game in over four
years. It was also their first victory over a Division I foot
ball team in 28 games. Enough said.
At USC 30, Stanford 7
On USC's first play from scrimmage, the Trojans
hoodwinked the Card defense by throwing a fullback
pass. Wide receiver Timmie Ware was wide open 35
yards downfield and waltzed into the end zone with
Kennedy Pola's pass to make the score 7-0 and for all
practical purposes the game was over.
The demoralized Stanford team made its usual
mistakes and virtually handed the Trojans its first three
touchdowns. In fact, midway through the second quar
ter with the scoreboard showing USC in front 21-0, the
Trojans had just one net rushing yard. Stanford averted
its first shut-out since USC beat it 49-0 in 1977 with a
fourth-quarter Steve Cottrell-to-Shawn Avant 48-yard
touchdown pass play.
Oregon 16, Stanford 7
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger officially con
firmed Wiggin's resignation the Friday morning before
the game. And whatever effect Wiggin's announce
ment on the Card, it wasn't a positive one. Stanford
came out playing its flattest (and probably worst) foot
ball of the season, succumbing to an injury-ridden
Duck team.
The game marked what probably can be referred to
as the lowpoint in Stanford football.
