# Band takes blame for all but The Play last year
## 
### 
The following is the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band's written ver
sion of today's program.
About dropping our
trousers last week the Stan
ford Band wants you to know
it's sorry. That goes for the
Hoover Tower formation too,
and for every other lapse of
control in the Band since the
dawn of time from the
Great LSJUMB Revolution in
1963 to the recent "Jailbreak"
that occurred in Tempe,
Ariz., after Band members
were arrested for jaywalking.
It's sorry it even thought of
presenting a Toxic Shock
Halftime Show.
The Band admits to being at
fault in more serious matters
as well, such as UC-Berkeley's
seismic disorders. The drumz
just got out of control, took

too many fast drugz, and sud
denly a pretty melody turned
into a cataclysmic "Break Up
Song."
Actually, the Band's boo
boos can be traced back to the
beginning of recorded history.
The original Band Shak was lo
cated midway between Sodom
and Gormorrah, and Band
members gleefully cried "It's
Over" when their behavioral
excesses contributed to the
decline of Rome.
BUT the LSJUMB wants
you to know they were free of
blame in the debacle that oc
curred exactly a year ago.
Most of the Band, that is.
The Band would like you to
meet Mr. Gary Tyrrell. During
the past year, reporters have
wondered "Who Are You," O
famous trombonist? Well, his
name Gary T., and the LSJUMB

proudly presents him as the
Official Big Game Scapegoat.
Gary was in the end zone
last year as those fatal four
seconds ticked off "One at a
Time," blithely ruminating on
the significance of a drink
known as Blue Slime.
As Kevin Moen crossed the
five-yard line, Gary began to
ask himself, "Should I Stay Or
Should I Go?" But before he
had a chance to ponder the
subtle aspects of that ques
tion, Gary found himself lying
helplessly on the ground.
Even though Gary blew it
last year, the Band is giving
him a chance to redeem him
self. Will Gary respond to the
Band's encouragement to
"Carry On, Wayward Son?"
And if he succeeds, will pro
football offers be forthcom
ing? Tune in at halftime and
GIVE 'EM THE AXE!
