# Whatever the score, Card cannot lose
## 
### JASON COLE 
No matter the outcome of
today's Big Game, the Stan
ford Cardinal will celebrate. If
it wins, the glory of defeating
the archrival UC-Berkeley is
enough to cause delirium.
If it loses, at least the season is
over.
The Cardinal has suffered
through an abysmal season,
going 1-9 and posting its worst
season since 1960.
The Stanford offense, once
one of the most feared arsen
als in college football, has
sputtered constantly and has
been effective only once in 10
games; this fact is reflected in
the Card's record.
The defense has made some
improvements over its perfor
mances in past years, but,
despite having the best pass
defense in the Pac-10, Stan
ford's defense against the run
has been so poor that it still
has the second worst defense
in the conference.
But before you get up out of
your seat and leave in disgust,
look around Stanford
Stadium, look down at the

field and feel the pervasive
excitement.
Today is Big Game 1983,
chapter 86. Throw out the
records, throw out the statis
tics, throw out everything.
This game is a singular event,
affected by nothing else.
Cal Head Coach Joe Kapp
explained, "There's so much
history, so much tradition and
so much emotion surrounding
this game that the. way the two
teams have played during the
season doesn't mean very
much."
Again, considering the Car
dinal's season, that factor is a
blessing. But it also may be a
blessing for the Bears.
Cal has been one of the
most unpredictable teams in
all of college football this year.
They have posted a 4-5-1
record, including impressive
performances against tough
opponents and poor perfor

mances against lowly foes.
Perhaps no other game
demonstrates Cal's roller
coaster-type season bet
ter than its season opener
against Texas A & M. During
the first half of that game, the
Bears dominated the Aggies
en route to a 17-0 lead.
In the second half Texas
A & M struck back on offense
and held the Bears on
defense. During the fourth
quarter, the Aggies tied the
game at 17-17.
But Cal apparently retained
its composure. Driving
downfield, the Bears got into
Aggie territory and attempted
a field goal. The kick was
good, but there was a penalty
against Texas A & M on the
play.
Cal elected to accept the
penalty and go for a touch
down rather than take the
field goal and the lead. On the
ensuing play, quarterback
Gale Gilbert fumbled the ball
and the Aggies recovered it
deep in their own territory.
It appeared that the Bears
had snatched a tie from the

jawsl of victory, as the Aggies
looked like they were just
going to run out the clock. But
then, with 57 seconds remain
ing, the Texas A & M quarter
back dropped back to pass
and was sacked for a safety by
linebacker Ron Rivera. Cal
pulled out a 19-17 thriller that
shouldn't have been so thrill
ing.
But the main observation
that can be made about the
Cal team is that because of
their inconsistency it is neces
sary that they be motivated to
play well. That's where the
emotion of Big Game comes
in.
This game will boil down to
which team will be more
motivated than the other. Cer
tainly, motivation is not some
thing that can be measured
and determined so easily. But
there are some factors that can
be discussed.

First; of course, is The Play.
The final four seconds of last
year's Big Came have had an
amazing effect on the two uni
versities.
For the Cardinal, it could be
the darkest moment in its
football history. For the Bears,
it could be its most glorious.
But how will it affect the two
teams' motivation?
Cal seems to hedge on
using it as motivation. Accor
ding to Kapp, "We're going to
prove that we can beat them
without a play, or The Play, or
any play . . . We're not going
to look back, we're going to
look forward."
Although Kapp is not
denying the importance of
The Play, he certainly seems to
be mitigating its use and in
stead attempting to prove
something.
Stanford may not be using it
overtly, but it is still there.
Head Coach Paul Wiggin
denied that the play would be
shown to the players as part of
their preparation. Sophomore
Mike Noble, a member of the
kickoff team during The Play,
agreed, saying, "We're only
going to watch the positive
parts of last year's game. The
coaches don't want us to think
about the negative parts (like
The Play)."
However, senior Jim
Clymer, who will start at tight
end today, said quite succinct
ly, "I hate Cal ... I don't like
the way they accepted their
victory." Clymer was on the
bench during The Play, but
has vivid memories of Cal's
Mariet Ford smugly sticking
his finger in the face of several
Stanford players afterwards.
Revenge may not be the
healthiest motivating factor,
but it is sweet. As Noble indi
cated, "I'll never forget it. I
don't think anybody ever
will." Look for Stanford to be
very motivated, probably
more so than Cal in this
respect.
Second, this is Wiggin's
swan song. At perhaps no
other place in the country
would this mean so much.
Wiggin's pfayers look up to
him almost like a father figure.
Players have repeated
throughout the year that the
team's problems were not his
fault, but to no avail. He was
asked to resign by Athletic
Director Andy Geiger some
time ago, and finally decided
to announce it a week before
yesterday.
Wiggin has attempted to
play down the "Win one for
the Wig," attitude, as he calls
it. He maintains that it is not
his style. Regardless, the
players do feel motivated by
Wiggin's departure.
As Clymer explained,


CAREER BEST: Senior tight end Jim Clymer played the best game in his
four-year career last week against Oregon, catching five passes for 60
yards.

SIZE WITH SPEED: If Cal passes as much as has this season,
Tom Briehl will need his 4.6 second 40-yard dash speed as the Cardinal
linebackers primarily will be concerned with pass defense.

Art Streiber/Daily
A LATE ARRIVAL: Despite not playing for much of this season, Cardinal
freshman Marshall Dillard lately has demonstrated the form
which enabled him to.rush for over 2,000 yards as a high school senior.
"Coach Wiggin is a great man
and he deserves to go out a
winner."
Noble concurred saying,
"We're going to win it for
Wiggin." The desire to carry
Wiggin out of Stanford
Stadium in triumphant style
may be enough to carry the
Cardinal through the game.
Third, Cal wants to finish
this season as non-losers. In
other words, even their record
at 5-5-1. Both Kapp and sopho
more Dwight Garner men
tioned this as an important
motivation for this game. But
just how far that is going to get
them is not clear.

Last, but certainly not least,
is Joe Kapp. Kapp, although he
is not a superb technician, is
still nonetheless an excellent
coach. Primarily that is be
cause he knows how to get the
most out of his players. He is
an amazing motivator.
He is also a streetfighter.
Whatever it takes to win on
the football field, Kapp will do
it. "Never give up hope, even
when it seems everything is
against you. As long as you're
still alive, don't give up," Kapp
said.
So now you have to decide
whose going to win this game.
If you're putting any money
down on this game, just don't
expect to find any answers in
these teams' records. Picking
a winner in this game is almost
like flipping a coin.
No matter the outcome of
today's Big Game, the Stan
ford Cardinal will celebrate. If
it wins, the glory of defeating
the archrival UC-Berkeley is
enough to cause delirium.
If it loses, at least the season is
over.

A LATE ARRIVAL: Despite not playing for much of this season, Cardinal
freshman Marshall Dillard lately has demonstrated the form
which enabled him to.rush for over 2,000 yards as a high school senior.
"Coach Wiggin is a great man
and he deserves to go out a
winner."
Noble concurred saying,
"We're going to win it for
Wiggin." The desire to carry
Wiggin out of Stanford
Stadium in triumphant style
may be enough to carry the
Cardinal through the game.
Third, Cal wants to finish
this season as non-losers. In
other words, even their record
at 5-5-1. Both Kapp and sopho
more Dwight Garner men
tioned this as an important
motivation for this game. But
just how far that is going to get
them is not clear.

Last, but certainly not least,
is Joe Kapp. Kapp, although he
is not a superb technician, is
still nonetheless an excellent
coach. Primarily that is be
cause he knows how to get the
most out of his players. He is
an amazing motivator.
He is also a streetfighter.
Whatever it takes to win on
the football field, Kapp will do
it. "Never give up hope, even
when it seems everything is
against you. As long as you're
still alive, don't give up," Kapp
said.
So now you have to decide
whose going to win this game.
If you're putting any money
down on this game, just don't
expect to find any answers in
these teams' records. Picking
a winner in this game is almost
like flipping a coin.
No matter the outcome of
today's Big Game, the Stan
ford Cardinal will celebrate. If
it wins, the glory of defeating
the archrival UC-Berkeley is
enough to cause delirium.
If it loses, at least the season is
over.
The Cardinal has suffered
through an abysmal season,
going 1-9 and posting its worst
season since 1960.
The Stanford offense, once
one of the most feared arsen
als in college football, has
sputtered constantly and has
been effective only once in 10
games; this fact is reflected in
the Card's record.
The defense has made some
improvements over its perfor
mances in past years, but,
despite having the best pass
defense in the Pac-10, Stan
ford's defense against the run
has been so poor that it still
has the second worst defense
in the conference.
But before you get up out of
your seat and leave in disgust,
look around Stanford
Stadium, look down at the

field and feel the pervasive
excitement.
Today is Big Game 1983,
chapter 86. Throw out the
records, throw out the statis
tics, throw out everything.
This game is a singular event,
affected by nothing else.
Cal Head Coach Joe Kapp
explained, "There's so much
history, so much tradition and
so much emotion surrounding
this game that the. way the two
teams have played during the
season doesn't mean very
much."
Again, considering the Car
dinal's season, that factor is a
blessing. But it also may be a
blessing for the Bears.
Cal has been one of the
most unpredictable teams in
all of college football this year.
They have posted a 4-5-1
record, including impressive
performances against tough
opponents and poor perfor

mances against lowly foes.
Perhaps no other game
demonstrates Cal's roller
coaster-type season bet
ter than its season opener
against Texas A & M. During
the first half of that game, the
Bears dominated the Aggies
en route to a 17-0 lead.
In the second half Texas
A & M struck back on offense
and held the Bears on
defense. During the fourth
quarter, the Aggies tied the
game at 17-17.
But Cal apparently retained
its composure. Driving
downfield, the Bears got into
Aggie territory and attempted
a field goal. The kick was
good, but there was a penalty
against Texas A & M on the
play.
Cal elected to accept the
penalty and go for a touch
down rather than take the
field goal and the lead. On the
ensuing play, quarterback
Gale Gilbert fumbled the ball
and the Aggies recovered it
deep in their own territory.
It appeared that the Bears
had snatched a tie from the

jawsl of victory, as the Aggies
looked like they were just
going to run out the clock. But
then, with 57 seconds remain
ing, the Texas A & M quarter
back dropped back to pass
and was sacked for a safety by
linebacker Ron Rivera. Cal
pulled out a 19-17 thriller that
shouldn't have been so thrill
ing.
But the main observation
that can be made about the
Cal team is that because of
their inconsistency it is neces
sary that they be motivated to
play well. That's where the
emotion of Big Game comes
in.
This game will boil down to
which team will be more
motivated than the other. Cer
tainly, motivation is not some
thing that can be measured
and determined so easily. But
there are some factors that can
be discussed.

First; of course, is The Play.
The final four seconds of last
year's Big Came have had an
amazing effect on the two uni
versities.
For the Cardinal, it could be
the darkest moment in its
football history. For the Bears,
it could be its most glorious.
But how will it affect the two
teams' motivation?
Cal seems to hedge on
using it as motivation. Accor
ding to Kapp, "We're going to
prove that we can beat them
without a play, or The Play, or
any play . . . We're not going
to look back, we're going to
look forward."
Although Kapp is not
denying the importance of
The Play, he certainly seems to
be mitigating its use and in
stead attempting to prove
something.
Stanford may not be using it
overtly, but it is still there.
Head Coach Paul Wiggin
denied that the play would be
shown to the players as part of
their preparation. Sophomore
Mike Noble, a member of the
kickoff team during The Play,
agreed, saying, "We're only
going to watch the positive
parts of last year's game. The
coaches don't want us to think
about the negative parts (like
The Play)."
However, senior Jim
Clymer, who will start at tight
end today, said quite succinct
ly, "I hate Cal ... I don't like
the way they accepted their
victory." Clymer was on the
bench during The Play, but
has vivid memories of Cal's
Mariet Ford smugly sticking
his finger in the face of several
Stanford players afterwards.
Revenge may not be the
healthiest motivating factor,
but it is sweet. As Noble indi
cated, "I'll never forget it. I
don't think anybody ever
will." Look for Stanford to be
very motivated, probably
more so than Cal in this
respect.
Second, this is Wiggin's
swan song. At perhaps no
other place in the country
would this mean so much.
Wiggin's pfayers look up to
him almost like a father figure.
Players have repeated
throughout the year that the
team's problems were not his
fault, but to no avail. He was
asked to resign by Athletic
Director Andy Geiger some
time ago, and finally decided
to announce it a week before
yesterday.
Wiggin has attempted to
play down the "Win one for
the Wig," attitude, as he calls
it. He maintains that it is not
his style. Regardless, the
players do feel motivated by
Wiggin's departure.
As Clymer explained,


CAREER BEST: Senior tight end Jim Clymer played the best game in his
four-year career last week against Oregon, catching five passes for 60
yards.

victory." Clymer was on the
bench during The Play, but
has vivid memories of Cal's
Mariet Ford smugly sticking
his finger in the face of several
Stanford players afterwards.
Revenge may not be the
healthiest motivating factor,
but it is sweet. As Noble indi
cated, "I'll never forget it. I
don't think anybody ever
will." Look for Stanford to be
very motivated, probably
more so than Cal in this
respect.
Second, this is Wiggin's
swan song. At perhaps no
other place in the country
would this mean so much.
Wiggin's pfayers look up to
him almost like a father figure.
Players have repeated
throughout the year that the
team's problems were not his
fault, but to no avail. He was
asked to resign by Athletic
Director Andy Geiger some
time ago, and finally decided
to announce it a week before
yesterday.
Wiggin has attempted to
play down the "Win one for
the Wig," attitude, as he calls
it. He maintains that it is not
his style. Regardless, the
players do feel motivated by
Wiggin's departure.
As Clymer explained,


CAREER BEST: Senior tight end Jim Clymer played the best game in his
four-year career last week against Oregon, catching five passes for 60
yards.

SIZE WITH SPEED: If Cal passes as much as has this season,
Tom Briehl will need his 4.6 second 40-yard dash speed as the Cardinal
linebackers primarily will be concerned with pass defense.

A LATE ARRIVAL: Despite not playing for much of this season, Cardinal
freshman Marshall Dillard lately has demonstrated the form
which enabled him to.rush for over 2,000 yards as a high school senior.
"Coach Wiggin is a great man
and he deserves to go out a
winner."
Noble concurred saying,
"We're going to win it for
Wiggin." The desire to carry
Wiggin out of Stanford
Stadium in triumphant style
may be enough to carry the
Cardinal through the game.
Third, Cal wants to finish
this season as non-losers. In
other words, even their record
at 5-5-1. Both Kapp and sopho
more Dwight Garner men
tioned this as an important
motivation for this game. But
just how far that is going to get
them is not clear.

Last, but certainly not least,
is Joe Kapp. Kapp, although he
is not a superb technician, is
still nonetheless an excellent
coach. Primarily that is be
cause he knows how to get the
most out of his players. He is
an amazing motivator.
He is also a streetfighter.
Whatever it takes to win on
the football field, Kapp will do
it. "Never give up hope, even
when it seems everything is
against you. As long as you're
still alive, don't give up," Kapp
said.
So now you have to decide
whose going to win this game.
If you're putting any money
down on this game, just don't
expect to find any answers in
these teams' records. Picking
a winner in this game is almost
like flipping a coin.
