# Wiggin: Play not used to psyche players
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Today marks Paul Wiggin's final day as coach of the
Stanford Cardinal. At his last press conference Tuesday,
Wiggin was candid and professional, displaying the atti
tude which he maintained during his term. What fol
lows are selected questions and answers from the
conference.
Talent-wise, how do you (Stanford) match up with Cal?
I don't know. We've looked at the films and we've
evaluated they're doing a good job over there. It's
hard to say. I think probably at the get-go of this season
I thought we were a little better, particularly on the of
fensive side of the football. I'm not sure how that
match up is. They're a pretty good football team. I
don't think anybody thinks that we are so, probably, if
everybody is weighing those factors, they're going to
think that they (the Golden Bears) have better talent.
If you key on someone defensively, will that be
(California linebacker Ron) Rivera? What does he repre
sent to you, in terms of an offensive standpoint, of what
you have to do?
He's a lot like (USC linebacker Jack) Del Rio in that
they (the Bears) use him in a lot of ways not a lot of
ways, (but) in a very carefully planned way. They do
about three things with him and he's a good football
player. In fact, the other day we had the ballot for the
Lombardi Award. We're one of alot of ballots so this
one won't have a lot to do with it. I'll tell you why we
put Rivera as the number one guy because we feel
that he does more for them, based on what we had
seen on film through the season, than any one man had
done for any one defense anyplace else. So maybe that
him the best player in the country, but at
least he's making what they're doing. He does it so
well; he's a fine football player and I'm not sure he's
going to get the Lombardi Award. I don't think that's
going to happen. I think it's going to be somebody
someplace else. From our standpoint, that's how we
feel. You know, it's not easy for me to write down a Cal
man. That is some respect. I don't know Rivera very
well I've said hello to him a couple of times but I
sure respect the way he plays football.

You have the unique experience of having been a player
in Big Game and a coach. Going back to your days as a

player, give us a little insight on how you felt as a player
and as a coach of the Big Game.
Well, I don't think it's any different than when you
coach. It's a very vital part. I don't think anyone out
there understands the magnitude (when I say) out
there, I'm talking about in the United States. If you
went someplace else you wouldn't understand what
this is all about.
In fact, someone said that a Stanford guy was in New
York and he knew the Big Game had been played. He

ran downstairs and asked someone in the lobby of the
hotel if he knew who won the Big Game. The guy said,
'Yeah, I think Yale did.' So it's something that people
don't really see as the people involved do. I see it as
something on our campus that has a lot to do with a lot
of things. There's the campus spirit, there's the
Gaieties; there are things built around that. It's a very
big thing, so it's an entity within itself; it doesn't have
to have a bunch of factors building it to where it is, but
it's an entity within itself.
Do you believe that the emotion of the game can make
up for the inadequacies of the team's talent?
I've heard from some people that it doesn't matter. I

think emotion has an awful lot to do with it; I think it
really does. I don't think the game would have ended
in the ways that (it has so many times) without the ele
ment of emotion. You can trace through the history of
it; it's really an interesting thing because it isn't always
the favorite team it isn't close to being always the fa
vorite team and that has to be emotion. If you could
line up personnel and you marched out to the 50-yard
line, you could declare a winner right there. So there's
a lot of emotion to the game and I believe in it.
What about the timing of the decision (to resign)?
Would you have preferred it to happen after the season or
before Big Game rather than the way it was revealed?
I had a choice of when to do it and I felt like in that
situation in the timing of it last week was a better
time. There were a number of reasons for that and I
could go on and on with those reasons, but I just felt
that it could be disruptive. Some people say it could be
an emotional thing, but it can also be disruptive be
cause sometimes young people don't totally under
stand the reasons for those things .... From my
standpoint, that was the time I felt was best. I thought it
would be too disruptive, with all of the things that go
on this week, to do it this week. It was something that
most of our players had an inkling about, which made it
awkward at times ....
Are the players using the final play (on which California
scored with no time remaining last year) as a motivating
factor this year or are they trying to forget about it?
It was one of the few times maybe the only time
that I've been in athletics where the whole team was in
a complete state of shock. I'm not so sure that the
recollection of that is something that's particularly in
spirational because it didn't make sense to anyone at
the time. I sure haven't forgotten, but I haven't used it
as a focal point for what we're going to do.
What are some of the joyous memories of your tenure at
Stanford?
It was a great time. Some of the greatest victories I've
ever been a part of when I was a player here was
beating Ohio State. Beating Oklahoma when you go
into Oklahoma after losing to Boston College and
having the team do that was a very special time. That
was climbing a mountain . . . the Ohio State win where


Paul Wiggin
you went right down to the wire and fought back to win
that, or the Washington game a year ago. Those are
special times and, unfortunately, there weren't enough
of them. But it did represent a group of kids, a coaching
staff that fought it out and won the game that people
didn't expect. I guess that's the thing that makes ath
letics special to be able to have that kind of a game
or kind of a win happen. There were some good games
there really were. Unfortunately, there weren't

enough or there haven't been enough recently to make
it a lot of fun. But there were some times that we
climbed the mountain.
Is it tougher to do it (win) at Stanford now than it was
five years ago?
I wasn't here five years ago, but I see it and I think it's
difficult to get it done here. Yet, I want to be the one
guy to tell you that I believe it can be done. I need to
say it: I believe it can be done. I think it's going to take
the unified, across-the-board effort .... I think we
need, as a Stanford family, to rally in that direction be
cause it's going to take a complete, all-out effort to get
that done.

Is the program at a crossroads? Does it have to make a
decision about what it wants to do at this point and go
from here?
I think the decision's been made as to what it wants
to do. I think their intention is to go for it. I'd be disap
pointed if it isn't.
Will you stay on in any capacity? Andy (Geiger, Stan
ford's Director of Athletics) says there's a spot for you if
you want it.
That's not really my thinking right now. I like Stan
ford I still love the place but right now I'm not
sure that's my immediate rebound response. I'm not
sure that's on my mind.
