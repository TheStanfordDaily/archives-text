# Kapp: Bears, Cardinal evenly matched
## 
### JASON COLE 
University of California head
coach Joe Kapp completes his
second year at the helm of the
Golden Bears. Through his
first two years, Kapp has been
noted for his coloriul style of
coaching. At Cal's Monday
press conference, Kapp was
entertaining but more con
cerned with today's Big Game.
The following are some selec
ted questions and answers
from Monday's press confer
ence.
The tradition over the years
has been that lame duck
coaches seem to do well
(usually win) Big Game. What
do you think of the situation re
garding Paul Wiggin?
I made a decision for myself
that I wouldn't make any com
ments about that. The subject
probably deserves an in-depth
discussion. So, I believed that
the game is played by the foot
ball players and we should be
talking about the football
players. This is one of the
great, if not the greatest,
rivalry in college football. Be
tween the finest institutions
and we should be talking
about the players. It's a once
in-a-lifetime thing to play in
the Big Game; the players are
the important part.
Given the record of Stanford
and the record of your club, do
you feel that your club is more
talented than Stanford?
Well, I think that they're
two evenly matched football
teams. I think that the differ

ence between winning and
losing in the Pac-10 is very
precarious and whatever the
records are, traditionally, his
torically, it doesn't matter. Be
cause, when the teams go out
there on Big Game, it doesn't
matter what the records are. I
think you'll see the players
playing real hard.
Are there any defensive prob
lems that you'll present to John
Paye?
I think at this time of the
year, after 10 games all season,
most teams are going to pretty
well stay with what they've
done all season long. As I said
when the season started, it's a
race against time to prepare
for each opponent. It's almost
too late for both teams to
make any major adjustment in
what they're going to do. They
might come up with a trick
play, a big play, or the play or
whatever, but it's still pretty
much what you've seen from
Stanford and us all season. I
think that's what you're going
to see during the game.
What's the best part of coach
ing and what's the worst part of
coaching?
How much time do you
have? (laughs) The best part, I
think, is the excitement of
working with young men.
Trying to share what I know
about the game of football and
how to compete. Working
with people like Richard
Rodgers, Dwight Garner, Ron
Rivera. Just to be around
people like this and share a

common bond and a com
mon goal. To work towards
that goal; that's the best part.
The worst part? There are no
bad parts to college coaching.
. . There's a great thing about
what takes place here. These
young men will compete
against the Stanford men and
will do it in front of everybody
in front of the Bay Area, in
front of their mother's, their
uncles, their cousins (and) all
of you (the reporters). It's a
challenge, it's exciting. It's

test day, blue book day. The
men lay it on the line and
there's a great challenge in
doing that. They choose to do
it. They're all volunteers. To
me, that's what makes it so ex
citing. You get a result. You
know where you stand right
when that gun sounds. The
game itself brings on emo
tions that are rarely duplicated
in life.

Is it any different now that
you're a coach than when you
were a player?
You know, it's not. I'm 45
years old, and Dwight
(Garner) is 19, but the emotion
is the same.
Stanford will no doubt use the
play (the final play of last year's
game) as a motivating factor.
Will you try to use it in any way?
Once again, I think this
game has so much emotion in
itself. You can look back,

maybe it's good to look back
for them. We're going to look
forward. That's what the game
is about all the history, all
the tradition, all the games
that were decided by less than
a touchdown. I played in three
of them and they were
decided by one point, two
points and six points. That's
why people come to see the
game. It will be a hell of a

game. Every coach and every
player is going to draw from
whatever they want. If
revenge is theirs, then so be it.
We're going to try to have
some fun on Saturday. It's
more fun to win.
Do players get more pumped
up for this game than for USC or
UCLA?
I don't know that it's more.
It's just the final game of the
season. The taste of this game
lasts for a while. It's the tradi
tional rival. Its players from
the two finest institutions in
America competing on a high
level in both the classroom
and the athletic field.
When you were a player, did
you ever use revenge as motiva-,
tion?
Yes, everything that you can
possibly draw on. Revenge
didn't happen to work. . .
Have you tried to get the Cal
fans more involved this year?
We just like to have more
people involved in our party.
We just believe that our fans
can be a positive force for us. .
. I believe that the people who
came out to support us, espe
cially the students who came
out and sat behind us, really
had a good time.
What's is it like going down to
the Farm for the Big Game?
I think this game, even
though it has 80,000 people, if
not half the people, at least a
lot of the people are Cal fans.
So it's not really an away atmo
sphere like playing in Seattle
against Washington.

coaching. At Cal's Monday
press conference, Kapp was
entertaining but more con
cerned with today's Big Game.
The following are some selec
ted questions and answers
from Monday's press confer
ence.
The tradition over the years
has been that lame duck
coaches seem to do well
(usually win) Big Game. What
do you think of the situation re
garding Paul Wiggin?
I made a decision for myself
that I wouldn't make any com
ments about that. The subject
probably deserves an in-depth
discussion. So, I believed that
the game is played by the foot
ball players and we should be
talking about the football
players. This is one of the
great, if not the greatest,
rivalry in college football. Be
tween the finest institutions
and we should be talking
about the players. It's a once
in-a-lifetime thing to play in
the Big Game; the players are
the important part.
Given the record of Stanford
and the record of your club, do
you feel that your club is more
talented than Stanford?
Well, I think that they're
two evenly matched football
teams. I think that the differ

ence between winning and
losing in the Pac-10 is very
precarious and whatever the
records are, traditionally, his
torically, it doesn't matter. Be
cause, when the teams go out
there on Big Game, it doesn't
matter what the records are. I
think you'll see the players
playing real hard.
Are there any defensive prob
lems that you'll present to John
Paye?
I think at this time of the
year, after 10 games all season,
most teams are going to pretty
well stay with what they've
done all season long. As I said
when the season started, it's a
race against time to prepare
for each opponent. It's almost
too late for both teams to
make any major adjustment in
what they're going to do. They
might come up with a trick
play, a big play, or the play or
whatever, but it's still pretty
much what you've seen from
Stanford and us all season. I
think that's what you're going
to see during the game.
What's the best part of coach
ing and what's the worst part of
coaching?
How much time do you
have? (laughs) The best part, I
think, is the excitement of
working with young men.
Trying to share what I know
about the game of football and
how to compete. Working
with people like Richard
Rodgers, Dwight Garner, Ron
Rivera. Just to be around
people like this and share a

common bond and a com
mon goal. To work towards
that goal; that's the best part.
The worst part? There are no
bad parts to college coaching.
. . There's a great thing about
what takes place here. These
young men will compete
against the Stanford men and
will do it in front of everybody
in front of the Bay Area, in
front of their mother's, their
uncles, their cousins (and) all
of you (the reporters). It's a
challenge, it's exciting. It's

test day, blue book day. The
men lay it on the line and
there's a great challenge in
doing that. They choose to do
it. They're all volunteers. To
me, that's what makes it so ex
citing. You get a result. You
know where you stand right
when that gun sounds. The
game itself brings on emo
tions that are rarely duplicated
in life.

Is it any different now that
you're a coach than when you
were a player?
You know, it's not. I'm 45
years old, and Dwight
(Garner) is 19, but the emotion
is the same.
Stanford will no doubt use the
play (the final play of last year's
game) as a motivating factor.
Will you try to use it in any way?
Once again, I think this
game has so much emotion in
itself. You can look back,

maybe it's good to look back
for them. We're going to look
forward. That's what the game
is about all the history, all
the tradition, all the games
that were decided by less than
a touchdown. I played in three
of them and they were
decided by one point, two
points and six points. That's
why people come to see the
game. It will be a hell of a

game. Every coach and every
player is going to draw from
whatever they want. If
revenge is theirs, then so be it.
We're going to try to have
some fun on Saturday. It's
more fun to win.
Do players get more pumped
up for this game than for USC or
UCLA?
I don't know that it's more.
It's just the final game of the
season. The taste of this game
lasts for a while. It's the tradi
tional rival. Its players from
the two finest institutions in
America competing on a high
level in both the classroom
and the athletic field.
When you were a player, did
you ever use revenge as motiva-,
tion?
Yes, everything that you can
possibly draw on. Revenge
didn't happen to work. . .
Have you tried to get the Cal
fans more involved this year?
We just like to have more
people involved in our party.
We just believe that our fans
can be a positive force for us. .
. I believe that the people who
came out to support us, espe
cially the students who came
out and sat behind us, really
had a good time.
What's is it like going down to
the Farm for the Big Game?
I think this game, even
though it has 80,000 people, if
not half the people, at least a
lot of the people are Cal fans.
So it's not really an away atmo
sphere like playing in Seattle
against Washington.
