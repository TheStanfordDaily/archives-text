# Will the real Cal Bears please stand up?

### DAVE DUTCHER 
UC-Berkeley is looking to turn a curious
season into a successful one today.
With a Big Game win, the Golden Bears, who
have won three of the last four season-ending
confrontations, would finish as non-losers at 5-
5-1 and claim area bragging rights over Stan
ford. Those accomplishments would com
pensate for a season that did not live up to ex
pectations.
"The record speaks for itself. We've lost
games that maybe we could have won," Cal
Head Coach Joe Kapp said Monday at a press
conference. "We would like to have a better
record, so there's incentive to finish 50-50."
After its last-second, 57-yard kickoff return
gave Cal an emotional Big Came victory and a
7-4 record under Coach Joe Kapp (who had
never before coached football), the Bears en
tered this season with high hopes and momen
tum from the previous season. What followed,
though, was week-to-week inconsistency.
Amazingly enough, Cal (4-5-1 overall, 2-4-1 in
the Pacific-10) opened its season similar to the
way it ended 1982 with a dramatic, 11th
hour play which earned it a win. The victim was
Texas A & M, which, like many other teams,
found frustration trying to contain Lombardi
Award finalist Ron Rivera. The 6-foot-3 inch
outside linebacker caused a fumble and reco
vered it for a safety, giving the Bears a 19-17 win.
Rivera is much more than an average All-
America candidate, if an "average" All-America
candidate exists. Rivera has convinced many of
his ability to dominate a game, including Stan
ford Coach Paul Wiggin.
"We feel that he does more for them (the
Bears) . . . than any one man has done for any
one defense anyplace else," Wiggin said at a
press conference Tuesday. "He's making what
they're doing (on defense) he does it so
well."
Among the opposing coaches left shaking
their heads after sending their offenses against
the Rivera-led Bear defense was Washington

State Coach Jim Walden.
"There's no question that Ron Rivera is an
Ail-American because of the way he plays. He's
not just blind recklessness, but he plays hard
all the time," Walden said. "If Ron Rivera is not
an All-American, there must be some awfully
big studs out there that I don't know about."
While Rivera has compiled 130 tackles
(including 73 unassisted stops) and 12 quarter
back sacks en route to two Pac-10 "Defensive
Player of the Week" honors, it is easy to over
look other members of the Cal 3-4 defense,
ranked seventh in the Pac-10.
Senior inside linebacker Eddie Walsh has 104
tackles and noseguard John Haina 96. It should
make fans of Stanford, which is successful
when it passes, happy that the Bear defense
ranks next to last in the Pac-10 in pass defense.
Should the Cardinal attempt to exploit Cal via
the airways, it will be trying to beat a secondary
led by rover senior Richard Rodgers (71 tackles)
and cornerback Ray Noble (four interceptions).
The Bears followed their narrow road victory
over Texas A & M by an uninspiring 28-14 loss
to San Diego State. Before that game, San
Diego State had exhibited little offense and
even less defense. How bad is San Diego State?
Presently, the Aztecs are 2-7-1 overall and next
to last in the Western Athletic Conference,
Cal's trend of inconsistency, established in its
first two games, continued throughout the next
eight games.
The Bear offense rebounded from its sub-par
performance at San Diego State to post a 30-9
decision over San Jose State which, in addition
to beating Stanford 23-10, challenged for the
Pacific Coast Athletic Association title for much
of this season. Cal's attack, which seemed to fi
nally come alive in a commanding fourth
quarter effort which led to a 33-33 tie with
Arizona, then ranked third nationally, can be
summarized in two words: passing and Gilbert.

eighth ranking in passing of
fense. In doing so, Gilbert, a
junior, leads the Pac-10 in
passing and is third in total of
fense.
"He is the focal point of

what they do (on offense),"
Wiggin said. "It was really
noticeable last week when he
got hurt. He must have some
leadership qualities too be

terback J.) wasn't bad."

said his team needs Gilbert to
be effective. "He's had a great
year and when he's in our
lineup we've been very pro
ductive," Kapp said.
Gilbert, who suffered an in
jury to his left (non-throwing)
shoulder in Cal's 16-6 loss to
Washington State last week,
has senior wide receiver Andy
Bark as his primary target.
Bark is tied for fifth in the Pac
-10 in receiving with 40 recep
tions and a 15.4-yard average.
Fellow wide receiver Ranee
McDougald will line up on the
other side of Cal's T
formation. McDougald, who is
right behind Bark among the
Pac-10 reception leaders,
ranks second behind Stan
ford's Emile Harry in Pac-10 re
ceiving yards with 711 yards on
38 catches.

"They have some talented
people and we're going to
have to deal with a sophisti
cated passing game," Wiggin
said. "They do an outstanding
job." Wiggin also said tight
ends David Lewis, a profes

sional prospectwho has seen
limited action due to a hamstr
ing pull, and Donald Noble aid
the Bears' passing game from
their position.
Cal hit another low in their
up-down season cycle when it
lost to Oregon. The Bears then
rose again, defeating Oregon
State despite giving up 531
yards to the Beavers (who are
tied with Stanford for last
place in the Pac-10).
Back to the low trend: Cal
lost to UCLA, allowing the

Bruins a fourth-quarter rally
which resulted in a 20-16 deci
sion. USC then beat the Bears,
albeit unimpressively, 19-9. At
that point, USC was trying to
avoid a losing season.
Between the USC and
Washington State losses, Cal
stunned Arizona State, then 2-
1-1 and in the conference title
hunt. The hero in the win was
5-9 kicker Randy Pratt, who
kicked a late field goal for the
victory. Pratt can be relied
upon to score, as evidenced

by his third position in the
Pac-10 scoring race. He is per
fect in point after touchdown
kicks and has missed but four
of 20 field goal attempts.
Pratt's 2.0 field goals per game
average ranks him third in the
country.
There's one looming ques
tion regarding Cal today:
Which team will show up? Will
it be the one which tied the
nation's third best team or the
one beaten by the doormat of
a much smaller conference?

pensate for a season that did not live up to ex
pectations.
"The record speaks for itself. We've lost
games that maybe we could have won," Cal
Head Coach Joe Kapp said Monday at a press
conference. "We would like to have a better
record, so there's incentive to finish 50-50."
After its last-second, 57-yard kickoff return
gave Cal an emotional Big Came victory and a
7-4 record under Coach Joe Kapp (who had
never before coached football), the Bears en
tered this season with high hopes and momen
tum from the previous season. What followed,
though, was week-to-week inconsistency.
Amazingly enough, Cal (4-5-1 overall, 2-4-1 in
the Pacific-10) opened its season similar to the
way it ended 1982 with a dramatic, 11th
hour play which earned it a win. The victim was
Texas A & M, which, like many other teams,
found frustration trying to contain Lombardi
Award finalist Ron Rivera. The 6-foot-3 inch
outside linebacker caused a fumble and reco
vered it for a safety, giving the Bears a 19-17 win.
Rivera is much more than an average All-
America candidate, if an "average" All-America
candidate exists. Rivera has convinced many of
his ability to dominate a game, including Stan
ford Coach Paul Wiggin.
"We feel that he does more for them (the
Bears) . . . than any one man has done for any
one defense anyplace else," Wiggin said at a
press conference Tuesday. "He's making what
they're doing (on defense) he does it so
well."
Among the opposing coaches left shaking
their heads after sending their offenses against
the Rivera-led Bear defense was Washington

State Coach Jim Walden.
"There's no question that Ron Rivera is an
Ail-American because of the way he plays. He's
not just blind recklessness, but he plays hard
all the time," Walden said. "If Ron Rivera is not
an All-American, there must be some awfully
big studs out there that I don't know about."
While Rivera has compiled 130 tackles
(including 73 unassisted stops) and 12 quarter
back sacks en route to two Pac-10 "Defensive
Player of the Week" honors, it is easy to over
look other members of the Cal 3-4 defense,
ranked seventh in the Pac-10.
Senior inside linebacker Eddie Walsh has 104
tackles and noseguard John Haina 96. It should
make fans of Stanford, which is successful
when it passes, happy that the Bear defense
ranks next to last in the Pac-10 in pass defense.
Should the Cardinal attempt to exploit Cal via
the airways, it will be trying to beat a secondary
led by rover senior Richard Rodgers (71 tackles)
and cornerback Ray Noble (four interceptions).
The Bears followed their narrow road victory
over Texas A & M by an uninspiring 28-14 loss
to San Diego State. Before that game, San
Diego State had exhibited little offense and
even less defense. How bad is San Diego State?
Presently, the Aztecs are 2-7-1 overall and next
to last in the Western Athletic Conference,
Cal's trend of inconsistency, established in its
first two games, continued throughout the next
eight games.
The Bear offense rebounded from its sub-par
performance at San Diego State to post a 30-9
decision over San Jose State which, in addition
to beating Stanford 23-10, challenged for the
Pacific Coast Athletic Association title for much
of this season. Cal's attack, which seemed to fi
nally come alive in a commanding fourth
quarter effort which led to a 33-33 tie with
Arizona, then ranked third nationally, can be
summarized in two words: passing and Gilbert.

said his team needs Gilbert to
be effective. "He's had a great
year and when he's in our
lineup we've been very pro
ductive," Kapp said.
Gilbert, who suffered an in
jury to his left (non-throwing)
shoulder in Cal's 16-6 loss to
Washington State last week,
has senior wide receiver Andy
Bark as his primary target.
Bark is tied for fifth in the Pac
-10 in receiving with 40 recep
tions and a 15.4-yard average.
Fellow wide receiver Ranee
McDougald will line up on the
other side of Cal's T
formation. McDougald, who is
right behind Bark among the
Pac-10 reception leaders,
ranks second behind Stan
ford's Emile Harry in Pac-10 re
ceiving yards with 711 yards on
38 catches.

"They have some talented
people and we're going to
have to deal with a sophisti
cated passing game," Wiggin
said. "They do an outstanding
job." Wiggin also said tight
ends David Lewis, a profes

sional prospectwho has seen
limited action due to a hamstr
ing pull, and Donald Noble aid
the Bears' passing game from
their position.
Cal hit another low in their
up-down season cycle when it
lost to Oregon. The Bears then
rose again, defeating Oregon
State despite giving up 531
yards to the Beavers (who are
tied with Stanford for last
place in the Pac-10).
Back to the low trend: Cal
lost to UCLA, allowing the

Bruins a fourth-quarter rally
which resulted in a 20-16 deci
sion. USC then beat the Bears,
albeit unimpressively, 19-9. At
that point, USC was trying to
avoid a losing season.
Between the USC and
Washington State losses, Cal
stunned Arizona State, then 2-
1-1 and in the conference title
hunt. The hero in the win was
5-9 kicker Randy Pratt, who
kicked a late field goal for the
victory. Pratt can be relied
upon to score, as evidenced

by his third position in the
Pac-10 scoring race. He is per
fect in point after touchdown
kicks and has missed but four
of 20 field goal attempts.
Pratt's 2.0 field goals per game
average ranks him third in the
country.
There's one looming ques
tion regarding Cal today:
Which team will show up? Will
it be the one which tied the
nation's third best team or the
one beaten by the doormat of
a much smaller conference?
