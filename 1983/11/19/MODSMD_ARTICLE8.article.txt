# Rivera looking to finish big season in big way
## 
### TOM MOORE 
Despite the fact that the UC-
Berkeley Golden Bears have
displayed inconsistent team
efforts this season, perform
ing brilliantly at times against
top-ranked opponents while
losing to less heralded squads,
one Cal defensive stalwart has
been a model of continued ex
cellence.
All-American candidate Ron
Rivera, a 6-foot-3-inch, 225-
pound senior outside
linebacker who led the defen
sive unit his sophomore and
junior years with 99 tackles in
both 1981 and 1982, has
amassd an astounding 130
stops, including 73 solo tack
les in the current campaign.
Last week, Rivera contrib
uted 13 tackles, five unassisted
and one for a loss in Cal's 16-6

loss to Washington State,
prompting Cougar Coach Jim
Walden to comment, "There's
no question that Ron Rivera is
an Ail-American because of
the way he plays. He's not just
blind recklessness, but he
plays hard all the time. If Ron
Rivera is not an All-American,
there must be some awfully
big studs out there that I don't
know about."
In a nationally televised
game against Arizona, Rivera
led the Bears with 14 tackles,
nine being unassisted. He was
named the Pac-10 "Co-
Defensive Player of the Week"
for his performance. Rivera is
the only player in the confer
ence to receive that honor
twice this year. His effort
against Texas A & M in the
1983 opener also resulted in

his being named "Player of
the Week." Credited with 16
tackles (nine solo), he broke
through the Aggie line with 57
seconds left in the game to
nail Jimmie Hawkins for a
safety and give Cal a dramatic
19-17 victory. Cal defensive
coordinator Denny Schuler
praised Rivera before this
season had ever begun, call
ing him "as good against the
run as any college linebacker I
have ever seen."
Rivera's reaction to such ef
fusive praise has been as con
sistent as his play. Modest in
self-appraisal, he stresses the
importance of hard work and a
positive attitude. At a recent
press conference, the
linebacker summed up his re
action to Cal's season. "It's
been fun even though we

haven't won as many as I
thought we could have," he
said, "but you learn to grow
whether you win or lose."
Indeed some of Rivera's
best efforts have come during
a losing cause. Against
Oregon, he recorded two
quarterback sacks, caused
three fumbles, recovered an
other and deflected two
passes. Late in the game, he
hit an Oregon runner in the
backfield, popped the ball
loose, grabbed it in midair
and raced 36 yards for his first
collegiate touchdown. Against
San Diego State, Rivera spent
most of his time in the Aztec
backfield, helping stop San
Diego State runners behind
the line four times in the first
half alone.
