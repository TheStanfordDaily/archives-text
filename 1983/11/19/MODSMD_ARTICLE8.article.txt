# Rivera looking to finish big season in big way
## 
### TOM MOORE 
Despite the fact that the UC-
Berkeley Golden Bears have
displayed inconsistent team
efforts this season, perform
ing brilliantly at times against
top-ranked opponents while
losing to less heralded squads,
one Cal defensive stalwart has
been a model of continued ex
cellence.
All-American candidate Ron
Rivera, a 6-foot-3-inch, 225-
pound senior outside
linebacker who led the defen
sive unit his sophomore and
junior years with 99 tackles in
both 1981 and 1982, has
amassd an astounding 130
stops, including 73 solo tack
les in the current campaign.
Last week, Rivera contrib
uted 13 tackles, five unassisted
and one for a loss in Cal's 16-6

loss to Washington State,
prompting Cougar Coach Jim
Walden to comment, "There's
no question that Ron Rivera is
an Ail-American because of
the way he plays. He's not just
blind recklessness, but he
plays hard all the time. If Ron
Rivera is not an All-American,
there must be some awfully
big studs out there that I don't
know about."
In a nationally televised
game against Arizona, Rivera
led the Bears with 14 tackles,
nine being unassisted. He was
named the Pac-10 "Co-
Defensive Player of the Week"
for his performance. Rivera is
the only player in the confer
ence to receive that honor
twice this year. His effort
against Texas A & M in the
1983 opener also resulted in

his being named "Player of
the Week." Credited with 16
tackles (nine solo), he broke
through the Aggie line with 57
seconds left in the game to
nail Jimmie Hawkins for a
safety and give Cal a dramatic
19-17 victory. Cal defensive
coordinator Denny Schuler
praised Rivera before this
season had ever begun, call
ing him "as good against the
run as any college linebacker I
have ever seen."
Rivera's reaction to such ef
fusive praise has been as con
sistent as his play. Modest in
self-appraisal, he stresses the
importance of hard work and a
positive attitude. At a recent
press conference, the
linebacker summed up his re
action to Cal's season. "It's
been fun even though we

haven't won as many as I
thought we could have," he
said, "but you learn to grow
whether you win or lose."
Indeed some of Rivera's
best efforts have come during
a losing cause. Against
Oregon, he recorded two
quarterback sacks, caused
three fumbles, recovered an
other and deflected two
passes. Late in the game, he
hit an Oregon runner in the
backfield, popped the ball
loose, grabbed it in midair
and raced 36 yards for his first
collegiate touchdown. Against
San Diego State, Rivera spent
most of his time in the Aztec
backfield, helping stop San
Diego State runners behind
the line four times in the first
half alone.


Ron Rivera
"People keep looking for
me to do something exciting,"
he stated, "yet I'm just trying
to do my best out there."
One of the keys to Rivera's
domination this season has
been his smooth adjustment
from outside linebacker to
roving linebacker. While the
switch entails many more re
sponsibilities for Rivera, he
has handled them well. Rivera
is used in much the some
manner as the Los Angeles
Raider's Ted Hendricks. Both
linebackers are given a large
amount of duties: blitzing,
pass rushing, pass coverage
and defense against the run
must be included in Rivera's

repertoire. Asked if he prefers
any one of the specialties,
Rivera replied, "I like doing it
all." He explained that the Cal
defensive scheme makes it
necessary to rely on reaction.
Rivera is also allowed to
gamble when he believes that
it will be effective.
'I talk to defensive coach
Schuler before the game and
we discuss when would prob
ably be the best times to gam
ble. Basically, after we've dis
cussed it, I make my own de
cisions, however.
'lt's been successful this
year," he said. "It depends on
what the other team does
whether I'll stunt, blitz, come
off the end or stay put."
Sportsmanship is also a key
phrase that must be used
while describing Rivera.
Arizona quarterback Tom Tun

nicliffe notes "He's not only a
good player but a good person
too. He'd say 'good pass' if
you made one and he didn't
bad mouth."
While his football may be all
business, Rivera retains his
likable personality within the
limits of the game. He has of
ten touted the wisdom of
respecting his opponent.
"Stanford's a good team. They
might not have the depth of
some other schools but they
have a lot of talent," he said at
Monday's press conference.
"We'll be careful out there."
Because today's game
features two of the top passing
teams in college football, and
particularly because Stanford
prefers to pass to set up the
run, Rivera figures to be a
dominant force on the field.
His 12 sacks lead the Bears and
despite weather forecasts that

predict a soggy field, Rivera
feels that each team will try to
do what it does best.
"There's potential for a lot
of scoring in this game," he
said, "(Stanford quarterback
John) Paye played well against
Arizona and we've got a smilar
defense."
He also hinted that last
year's Big Game could be a
factor. " We're going to be
really careful against Stanford
because they're going to be
playing at an emotional level.
If we let them build up mo
mentum, we could be in for a
long afternoon."
Rivera is almost certain to be
a first-round draft pick by the
NFL later this year. His ver
satility will prove a boon to
any team that needs help in its
linebacking corps. He admits
that professional football
might be in his future. "If I get

the opportunity," he said, "I'd
like to give it a shot." A lot of
Pac-10 teams would have to
agree that Rivera should be
able to give it a good shot. His
statistics speak for themselves
already, and Rivera still has
today's game left to play.
On a personal level as well,
today's contest will be an
emotional one for Rivera.
Playing his final college game
as a Bear, he looks back on the
season with no regrets.
"We've had our ups and
downs this year," he said,
"but its been fun." He point
ed to the Arizona game as his
personal high spot of the
season.
'lt's a lot of things but main
ly that we came back like we
did that makes it a special
game." Needless to say, Big
Game also means a lot to
Rivera.
