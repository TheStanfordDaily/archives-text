# Excitement the only sure aspect of Big Game

### JOHN JASBERG 
The Big Game Stanford
vs. UC-Berkeley is one of
the oldest and most intense
rivalries in college football.
Throughout the history of this
series the games have consis
tently proven to be close, ex
citing and unpredictable, even
if the two teams haven't al
ways been powerhouses.
In fact, the Big Game has
demonstrated that national
rankings and bowl bids need
not be at stake for college
football to be at its best. The
series has been filled with up
sets, wild finishes, great indi
vidual performances, and also
many games that decided the
race for the roses.
Enthusiasm for the game
runs rampant at both schools
and throughout the Bay Area;
Stanford and Memorial
Stadiums are seldom below
capacity when the two teams
meet. Today's game is no ex
ception. Even though both
teams have struggled this
year, Stanford Stadium will be
packed full.
A quick glance at the series
statistics is helpful in express
ing the closeness of the
rivalry. Stanford leads the se
ries with a record of 40 wins,
35 losses, and 10 ties in the
first 85 meetings between the
two teams. In all fairness to

the Bears, though, the series
has been dead even since
1919, the year which can be
taken as the starting point for
"modern" football. Another
good indicator of how com
petitive the series has been is
the fact that 40 of the games
have been settled by 7 points
or less. Still, the numbers
alone do not show the inten
sity and emotion of the Big
Game, one must attend a
game to get the whole picture.
The first Big Game was
played in 1892 and there has
been a game every year since
than except for two brief in
terludes. The first interruption
lasted from 1915 until 1918 but
had nothing to do with fight
ing in Europe; Cal and Stan
ford simply couldn't come to
terms on the matter of
eligibility requirements so the
Big Game wasn't played for
those four years. The series
was also shelved for three
years because of World War 11,
specifically 1943 through 1945.
In 1963 the assassination of
President John Kennedy
resulted in the postponement
of the Big Game for a week.
Although there has been a
Big Game almost every year
since its inception, it should
be noted that the game hasn't
always been football. The nine
Big Games during the years

1906-1914 were actually rugby
matches. This may seem
downright un-American to
modern fans, but at the time
the presidents of the two
schools deemed football to be
too dangerous. By the time
that the Big Game resumed in
1919, American football, albeit
a safer version, was again the
sport of the Big Game.
Many college football
rivalries have trophies or ob
jects which are passed back
and forth between the two
teams depending on which
one wins the game. The Big
Game is no exception; in this
case the trophy is the Axe. The
Axe symbolizes the fierce
rivalry between the two teams,
and accordingly it is highly
coveted by both schools. If a
school can't win the Axe on
the playing field it is likely that
members of its student body

will try to steal it from the
enemy.
The Axe made its first ap
pearance in 1899 at a Stanford-
Cal baseball game; Stanford
rooters used it to chop up an
effigy of a Cal student. This
perturbed some of the Cal stu
dents and after the game they
stole it. A wild chase through
the streets of San Francisco
ensued with the Axe changing
hands several times. Finally, a
Cal rooter got hold of it,
sawed the handle off to better
conceal it from the Stanford
students and the police, and
rode the ferry back to the East
Bay. The Axe remained in
Berkeley for 31 years until a
crafty group of Stanford stu
dents, posing as journalists,
stole it back. In 1933 the pres
ent practice of awarding the
Axe to the winner of each Big
Game was initiated and since

then the Axe has resided on
the campus of the winning
team, except when it has been
stolen.
Perhaps the first truly great
Big Game was in 1924. This
game is a rarity among Big
Games in that it matched two
outstanding teams. Cal was 7-
0-1 and had not lost a game in
five years. Meanwhile, "Pop"
Warner's Cardinal had won all
of its seven games. Cal en
tered the game as the favorite
due to the fact that they had
played a tougher schedule,
not to mention the fact that
Stanford's All-American Ernie
Nevers was-injured. Stanford
shocked the Bears by jumping
out to a 6-0 halftime lead but
Cal recovered to score 20
straight points, and with 10
minutes to play the Cardinal
seemed dead. However, Stan-
