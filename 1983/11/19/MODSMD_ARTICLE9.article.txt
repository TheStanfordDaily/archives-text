# Excitement the only sure aspect of Big Game

### JOHN JASBERG 
The Big Game Stanford
vs. UC-Berkeley is one of
the oldest and most intense
rivalries in college football.
Throughout the history of this
series the games have consis
tently proven to be close, ex
citing and unpredictable, even
if the two teams haven't al
ways been powerhouses.
In fact, the Big Game has
demonstrated that national
rankings and bowl bids need
not be at stake for college
football to be at its best. The
series has been filled with up
sets, wild finishes, great indi
vidual performances, and also
many games that decided the
race for the roses.
Enthusiasm for the game
runs rampant at both schools
and throughout the Bay Area;
Stanford and Memorial
Stadiums are seldom below
capacity when the two teams
meet. Today's game is no ex
ception. Even though both
teams have struggled this
year, Stanford Stadium will be
packed full.
A quick glance at the series
statistics is helpful in express
ing the closeness of the
rivalry. Stanford leads the se
ries with a record of 40 wins,
35 losses, and 10 ties in the
first 85 meetings between the
two teams. In all fairness to

the Bears, though, the series
has been dead even since
1919, the year which can be
taken as the starting point for
"modern" football. Another
good indicator of how com
petitive the series has been is
the fact that 40 of the games
have been settled by 7 points
or less. Still, the numbers
alone do not show the inten
sity and emotion of the Big
Game, one must attend a
game to get the whole picture.
The first Big Game was
played in 1892 and there has
been a game every year since
than except for two brief in
terludes. The first interruption
lasted from 1915 until 1918 but
had nothing to do with fight
ing in Europe; Cal and Stan
ford simply couldn't come to
terms on the matter of
eligibility requirements so the
Big Game wasn't played for
those four years. The series
was also shelved for three
years because of World War 11,
specifically 1943 through 1945.
In 1963 the assassination of
President John Kennedy
resulted in the postponement
of the Big Game for a week.
Although there has been a
Big Game almost every year
since its inception, it should
be noted that the game hasn't
always been football. The nine
Big Games during the years

1906-1914 were actually rugby
matches. This may seem
downright un-American to
modern fans, but at the time
the presidents of the two
schools deemed football to be
too dangerous. By the time
that the Big Game resumed in
1919, American football, albeit
a safer version, was again the
sport of the Big Game.
Many college football
rivalries have trophies or ob
jects which are passed back
and forth between the two
teams depending on which
one wins the game. The Big
Game is no exception; in this
case the trophy is the Axe. The
Axe symbolizes the fierce
rivalry between the two teams,
and accordingly it is highly
coveted by both schools. If a
school can't win the Axe on
the playing field it is likely that
members of its student body

will try to steal it from the
enemy.
The Axe made its first ap
pearance in 1899 at a Stanford-
Cal baseball game; Stanford
rooters used it to chop up an
effigy of a Cal student. This
perturbed some of the Cal stu
dents and after the game they
stole it. A wild chase through
the streets of San Francisco
ensued with the Axe changing
hands several times. Finally, a
Cal rooter got hold of it,
sawed the handle off to better
conceal it from the Stanford
students and the police, and
rode the ferry back to the East
Bay. The Axe remained in
Berkeley for 31 years until a
crafty group of Stanford stu
dents, posing as journalists,
stole it back. In 1933 the pres
ent practice of awarding the
Axe to the winner of each Big
Game was initiated and since

then the Axe has resided on
the campus of the winning
team, except when it has been
stolen.
Perhaps the first truly great
Big Game was in 1924. This
game is a rarity among Big
Games in that it matched two
outstanding teams. Cal was 7-
0-1 and had not lost a game in
five years. Meanwhile, "Pop"
Warner's Cardinal had won all
of its seven games. Cal en
tered the game as the favorite
due to the fact that they had
played a tougher schedule,
not to mention the fact that
Stanford's All-American Ernie
Nevers was-injured. Stanford
shocked the Bears by jumping
out to a 6-0 halftime lead but
Cal recovered to score 20
straight points, and with 10
minutes to play the Cardinal
seemed dead. However, Stan-
back-to-back Big Game thril
lers. In 1958 the Bears were a
Cinderella team led by their
quarterback, Joe Kapp. Stan
ford, coached by "Cactus
Jack" Curtice, was having a
dismal year. No matter, the
game was a thriller anyhow,
with two-point conversions
providing the margin of vic
tory: The end of the contest
saw Stanford scoring a touch
down with less than a minute
left to cut Cal's lead to 16-15.
In the spirit of the Big Game
the Indians went for two
points but running back Skip
Face was stopped a yard short
of the goal line, giving the
Bears a trip to the Rose Bowl.
The Bears lost the Rose Bowl
but Kapp went on to star in the
pros, act in films and even try
his hand at coaching.
The next year's game
matched two teams that were
going nowhere but the game
was a nail-biter nonetheless.
Stanford's Dick Norman had
an unbelievable day, complet
ing 34 of 39 passes for a Big
Game record 401 yards.
However, for all of Norman's
heroics Stanford was behind
20-17 with less than 4 minutes
left. Undaunted, Norman
drove the Indians to the Cal 5-
yard line but time ran out
when Norman was unable to
get out of bounds following a
4-yard scramble.
For all of the excitement
generated by the Big Game
during its first 80 years of exis
tence, the games played
during the '7os and 'Bos
have been better. The 1972 Big
Game at Memorial Stadium
was played on a field that
resembled Alviso at high tide,

ford refused to quit and tied
the game up at 20-20 on the
strength of two touchdown
heaves by reserve back Ed
Walker, the last coming with
only seconds remaining. The
game ended up as a tie and it
set the tone for future Big
GamesC
Skipping ahead to 1947 we
find, perhaps, the most un
evenly matched teams in the
history of the Big Game. Cal,
coached by "Pappy" Waldorf
and led by golden boy Jackie
Jensen, was 8-1 entering the
contest. Stanford, on the
other hand, was an anemic 0-8
on the campaign. As much of a
cliche as it may be, you can
throw out the won-lost
records when Cal and Stan
ford play as this game showed.
The winless Indians (the name
had been changed some years
before) nearly pulled off an
unbelievable upset. Midway
through the final period a Don
Campbell to Bob Anderson
pass gave the Indians an 18-14
lead, and when Cal took pos
session of the ball on their
own 20 with less than three
minutes left the miracle
seemed very possible.
However, Jackie Jensen con
nected on an 80-yard touch
down pass to Paul Keckley (the
longest in the Big Game) and
Stanford's hopes were abrupt
ly dashed. Cal won 21-18, the
biggest upset in Big Game his
tory was not to be that day.
The late 1950s produced

but the conditions didn't
prevent the game from being a
great one. Stanford led 14-3 at
the half on the strength of a
Mike Boryla TD toss and a 71-
yard interception return by
Gordy Riegel. Cal's Sylvester
Youngblood countered with
two TD runs, the second one
putting the Bear's up 18-14
early in the fourth quarter.
However, the Cardinal
stormed back to score with
less than four minutes left in
the contest and led 21-18.
When Cal's frosh quarterback
Vince Ferragamo threw his
fourth interception of the
game with only two and a half
minutes left in the game Stan
ford seemed to have sewn up

Game featured, perhaps, the
most exciting of any before
last year's thriller. Cal was
having a great year; prior to
the Big Game their record
stood at 7-2-1 as compared to
Stanford's 4-4-2 mark. As the
fourth quarter began, Cal had
a 10-3 lead and the game
showed little promise of being
an all-time great one.
However, the fourth quarter
saw 29 points scored and an
astounding finish. Stanford
quarterback Guy Benjamin,
taking over for an ineffective
Mike Cordova, led the Cards
to a field goal and two TD's in
rapid succession, the last

the victory. However, Cal got
the ball back with a little more
than a minute left. Cal Coach
Mike White ignored the fans'
pleas to put in Steve
Bartkowski and stayed with
Ferragamo; the freshman
rewarded the coach by coolly
directing the Bears down to
the Stanford 7-yard line, from
where he threw a touch down
pass to a belly-flopping Steve
Sweeney as time ran out. De
dlam reigned in Berkeley and
the goal posts came down.
Stanford's revenge was not
long in coming. The 1974 Big

score coming on a 61-yard
bomb to Tony Hill. Cal was
shocked but they got closer
on the strength of a field goal
by Jim Breech. Then with less
than three minutes remaining
Cal got the ball and had a
chance to take the lead. All-
American Bartkowski marched
the Bears 48 yards, with the
score coming on a 13-yard
pass to Steve Rivera. With 26
seconds left Cal led 20-19 and
Bear fans were delirious.
Before the Cal fans could
relax, though, Benjamin com
pleted passes to Ted Pappas

and Brad Williams and the
Cards had the ball on the Cal
33-yard line with two seconds
left. Kicker Mike Langford
capped the impossible drive
by booting a 50-yard field goal
that split the uprights; Stan
ford won 22-20.
1979 saw another great
finish. First, with the game
tied 14-14 in the fourth quar
ter, Cal quarterback Rich
Campbell found tight end Joe
Rose for what appeared to
everyone to be a TD. The ref
eree thought differently and
called the pass out-of-bounds.
However, he reversed his
decision after he realized that
he had confused some end
zone decoration for the end
line. So, trailing 21-14, Stan
ford needed a TD. Quarter
back Turk Schonert
responded by driving the
Cards 79 yards in 18 plays, and
with 40 seconds left, Stanford
was facing a fourth-and-goal
situation at Cal's one-yard
line. Stanford elected to pass
on the all-important play and
Schonert fired a hurried pass
towards Mike Dotterer that
appeared to have touchdown
written on it. But Cal safety
Ron Coccimiglio made a great
play to knock the ball away at
the last second. Cal won 21-14
and earned a trip to the Gar
den State Bowl.
Of course, the 1982 Big
Game overshadows all
Stanford-Cal games in terms
of excitement and im
probability. Emotions will be
running high today as the
memory of last year's contest
is deeply ingrained in each
team, so today's game figures
to be another memorable one.
