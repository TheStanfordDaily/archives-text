MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO
Mac ARTHUR PARK
THIS THANKSGIVING.
IW. ' <riow W^at our oakwood smoker does to ribs.
Imagine what it would do to turkey. Juicy white meat,
smokey and savory, with crispy golden skin.
And we know that turkey, no matter how
beautifully prepared wouldn't be the same without suitable
accompaniments. Homemade bread stuffing, rich giblet
gravy, gently simmered cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie made
from fresh pumpkin, not cans.
Sound like a great Thanksgiving? Turkeys ready starting
at 2:00. And if you 're absolutely devoted to our ribs, we
won't turn you away. ARTHUR PARK ,
