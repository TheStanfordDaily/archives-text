Winter sports beats
Anyone interested in being a beat
sports reporter during winter quarter
and everyone already assigned beats,
meet today in the sports office at
The Daily for an important meeting
at 4:30 p.m.
The pay may not be great, but the
experience and excitement of
covering Stanford sports is enough
reward in itself.
