## The 						Stanford Daily Give better advice... 
### 
The recently released senior survey provided
some disturbing results on freshman advising
here. Forty-eight percent of the seniors who
graduated last year said their freshman adviser
was poor or very poor. Sixty percent of the
seniors said their adviser was or much
worse than expected.
The situation is even more disturbing consid
ering the fact that graduating seniors have con
sistently given the freshman advising system
low marks for the past four years. More than 45
percent of the graduating seniors since 1979
have rated their freshman advising as poor or
very poor.
Currently, freshman are usually assigned a
faculty member with a small group of other stu
dents. As a result, the University must provide
more than 100 freshman advisers who are will
ing to spend time with the students. While we
realize it would be very difficult to find this
many dedicated advisers, we can only encour
age the University to take more care in screen
ing applicants. Freshman advisers must be will
ing to visit with their advisees regularly and be
available when students have problems. Most
importantly, advisers should be better briefed
by the University on course offerings, major re
quirements and common questions that fresh
men mav ask.

When the system breaks down and students
are unhappv with their freshman adviser, they
should have some place to go. We commend
the relatively new advising associate system
where small groups of students are also as
signed a student adviser, usually a senior, ac
cording to their area of interest. These student
advisers are usually accessible and sympathetic
to freshmen.
We also suggest the University better
publicize the academic resources available at
the Academic Information Center. There
should be a number of permanent advisers on
hand at the AIC who are knowledgeable about
every academic department.
Despite these criticisms of the current sys
tem, we do not deny that there are many fresh
man advisers who do spend a lot of time with
their advisees, reviewing their course
schedules with them, inviting them to dinner at
their homes and making themselves available
at all times. This is appreciated â€” but also ex
pected of an adviser.
The results are in and they show that, for a
majority of students, freshman advising here is
just plain disappointing. Freshman advisers
play a critical role in helping students plan their
next four years here. We hope that the Univer
sity gives a little higher priority to improving
the svstem.
