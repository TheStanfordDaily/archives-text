# ...and better teaching
## 
### 
We extend our congratulations to 65 percent
of the University faculty and 48 percent of the
University's teaching assistants who were rated
"excellent" or "good" as teachers by last
year's senior class. Vet we're disturbed that the
seniors gave substantially higher ratings to the
faculty as high-quality scholars and research
ers, with 94 percent of the responses at the
high end of the scale.
There is clearly a problem when — as teach
ers — 35 percent of the faculty were rated as
"worse" or "much worse" than expected in
the senior survey. Students expect a great deal
more than they are getting — and we might
add — getting for $10,000 a year.
We're not upset that the research here is
considered top-notch. It's great that Stanford is
contributing ideas to the worlds of science and
applied knowledge. Rather, we're concerned
that too much of an emphasis is being placed
on "research" and that not enough emphasis is
being given to undergraduate education.
Admittedly, the definition of a "university"
includes the conferring of both undergraduate
and graduate degrees. And presumably,
graduate work will include intensive research

into a student's major field of study. As Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy noted in his
freshman orientation speech, Stanford is one
of the few "research universities" in the
United States. These definitions differentiate
us from "colleges" which specialize solely in
undergraduate education.
In spite of these announced commitments,
there still appears to be a bias in favor of re
search over teaching. One example seems ap
parent in the current tenure system. Depart
ments seem to be placing a greater emphasis
on "research" rather than on "teaching" when
formulating their decisions on granting tenure.
This trend is known as the "publish or perish"
syndrome; maybe the University should make
sure that great teachers aren't perishing.
Again, we thank the faculty members who
are doing a great teaching job. But we don't
think that it's too much to ask for improved
performance from the other one-third, and for
a corresponding attitude from the administra
tion. While research is commendable, it
should not be the sole criterion nor even the
focus of the university. Students are here to
learn, and professors should be ready to teach.
