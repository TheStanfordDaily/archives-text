Bridge replies
On Nov. 11, The Daily published
a column written by Jonathan
Treitel in which the columnist
portrayed himself as a Bridge coun
selor and described a "typical"
midnight counseling session. While
understanding the humorous intent
of the column, we are concerned
about the unrealistic picture
painted of The Bridge by a person
who, to the best of our knowledge,
has no affiliation with The Bridge
and knows little of how it functions
or what it does.
What is most disturbing about
Treitel's portrayal of The Bridge is
that it is nothing new; counseling
services in general suffer from a
poor image in a society which puts
pressure on all of us to hide our
weaknesses, even from ourselves.
Everyone, at some time, has a prob
lem or situation with which we
could be of assistance. We wish to
convey the value of our services to
everyone in the community and
negate the notion that it is some
how not acceptable to seek our
assistance.
We would also like to take this
opportunity to provide more accu
rate information about The Bridge
and its services. We offer free peer
ounseling to anyone who wishes
to call or drop by. The Bridge staff
is composed of volunteers who
have completed a one-quarter
training program in listening and
counseling skills. We are here to
listen, to explore feelings or to
discuss your problems and frustra
tions concerning work, school, sex,
loneliness, depression, drugs,
relationships and life. Though we
can't solve your problems for you,
we can help you to solve them
yourself.

Turkey for the poor
I ast time I thought about welfare
v,is at last week's Ujamaa House
meeting, when we were asked to
I nate $50 to poor families in East
Palo Alto for Thanksgiving turkeys.
At first I was alarmed when the
)use decided to give $100 to the
charity and voted to pay for it with
house funds. Why should we have
to spend our house dues on this,
lather than having individual dona
tions? After dll, I reasoned along
Robert Larkins' lines ("Vv -Ifare

means forced charity," Daily, Nov.
14) —our house funds are our
hard-earned money, and these
administrative "do-gooders" have
taken out the "virtue of giving."
Upon further talking, however, I
realized that if it were left up to the
individual, we would not have
raised even $25. Each person would
have thrown a quarter into the hat,
thinking it sufficient, and we still
would not have seen "appreciation
in the eyes of those helped."
Larkins mentioned that before
welfare "the 'haves' used to help
the 'have nots' by themselves," but
he provides no evidence proving
that was in fact the case or that
today it is not the case. It is con
venient for someone in a position
to give a claim that welfare is
"dehumanizing us" as an excuse
for not helping the 'have nots'
through institutions. But to those
who (like me) at first unquestion
ingly accept Larkins' conservative
argument cloaked in the disguise of
liberal altruism, you can rest your
consciences; you are probably
giving more to the poor through
welfare than you would on your
own.

The deterrent effect
By examining the issue of nerve
gas production from a moral stand
point in its Nov. 14 editorial
"Adding to the arsenal," The Daily
editorial board has chosen to
ignore the harsh realities of modern
warfare and deterrence. First, nerve
gas must be recognized as a strate
gic weapon system. Its use in
wartime on a massive scale would
result in the wholesale decimation
of civilian and military populations.
In terms of biological damage,
nerve gas effects would be not
unlike those of a nuclear exchange.
Because it is a strategic weapon
that has tremendous lethal implica
tions, nerve gas can also function as
a deterrent. By maintaining a nerve
gas arsenal, a nation will possess a
stronger response to the threat of •
nerve gas use than just a moral
argument, i.e., it will possess the
threat of retaliation. The threat of
retaliation will force any aggressor
to think twice about the implica
tions of the first use of nerve gas.
Hence, the nerve gas arsenal will
function as a stronger deterrent
than moral argument.

Moral arguments are okay in
peacetime, but during war they will
not speak nearly as loudly as a
deterrent weapon system.
