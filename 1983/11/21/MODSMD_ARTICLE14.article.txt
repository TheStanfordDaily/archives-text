# What the future may bring
## 
### 
Watching Gaieties last Friday, you were happy to
realize that some things never change; the show was as
joyous and satirical as ever. Yet when you emerged
from the comforting darkness of Memorial Auditorium,
you also realized that such timeless things are rare. The
rest of the world is changing fast, and will continue to
do so for the foreseeable future. It behooves us to look
at and think about what some of these changes will be.
For example, in the short run, President Reagan will
probably launch an invasion of Nicaragua. The invasion
of Grenada, the presence of U.S. troops in Honduras
and the United States' economic sabotage of Nicaragua
all point this way. And few people in this country are
doing anything to prevent it.
In fact, in light of the great public approval of the in
vasion of Grenada, such an aggression against
Nicaragua might even be supported. The war, if there is
one, will be ruinous, in terms of our alliances, in terms
of our social fabric and especially in terms of the lives
— Nicaraguan and American — that will be lost.
In the medium run, U.S. society will become further
dichotomized into two classes of workers: high-skilled
managerial, educational, scientific and technical
workers; and low-skilled manual and clerical workers.
Class tensions will increase, forcing major political and
economic reform to take place, perhaps within the con
text of violent revolt. A similar phenomenon will occur
in all the major industrial nations.
American society could be polarized in other ways.
For example, toward the year 2020, there will be many
more people receiving Social Security benefits (us)
than there will be paying Social Security taxes (our
children). Tension will result. There could also be con
flict between the north and south of our country as
people and capital abandon the Snowbelt for the more
hospitable climate of the Sunbelt.

The global role of the United States itself will con
tinue to change. Our power vis-a-vis the rest of the
world will wane. The financial capital of the world may
move from New York to Tokyo and eventually, perhaps
to Beijing or Buenos Aires.
In the longest run, the gap between rich countries
and poor countries — along with the tension it creates
— will continue to grow. A Third World country will
default on its debt, creating panic throughout the inter
national financial community. Or, when the people of
one of these countries decide they have nothing to lose
by fighting via a death by starvation, they will take up
arms against the countries that have more than enough
food.
And as we were all warned last night, the ultimate
change could some day come too: the nuclear trans
formation of Earth into a charred, soulless hell. This
change wouldn't even have to be brought about by the
Soviet Union or the United States; one of the debt
ridden Third World countries could decide that deploy
ing a nuclear warhead is cheaper than paying back its
loan. But by whatever means, the holocaust could
come.
Of course, this is all speculation, and my clair
voyance is not so acute as to assure me that all these
things will come to pass. But I do see things happening
in the world that make me believe they are real possi
bilities. As such, they demand our attention, because it
is to our generation that these challenges —with their
potential for becoming calamities — will fall. We must
consider them, and seek ways to meet them with posi
tive, peaceful action. The world to come need not be
what is called for in the scenarios being written by
today's events.
