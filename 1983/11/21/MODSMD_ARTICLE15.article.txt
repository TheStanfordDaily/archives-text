## We need more parking lots, fewer libraries 
### 
W. Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover
Institution and recent former president of the
University of California's Board of Regents, has
contended that the political vitriol and bias of
the opposition have transformed the Reagan
complex from the purely academic project it
was meant to be into a political issue.
Hard as it was to view this well-meant offer as
anything other than a boon to learning, along
comes Edwin Meese, the White House counsel
lor, to confirm that Campbell was quite
right — by.God, it is political! When an incum
bent president — through a very peculiar cor
respondence — lays down the law to a univer
sity on just how to memorialize him before he
has even declared to run for re-election, you
have got to figure there must be something
more at stake than just the purity of the scholar
ship.
But such polemical details all apart, we are all
galloping off in the wrong direction. What this
campus really needs is not more libraries, but

more parking lots. I have thought so ever since
Green East replaced what had been a perfectly
good lot that had allowed people to spirit their
bodies straight from their beds into their
offices, with a minimum of healthful, enforced
walking in between.
To halt this unfortunate trend, let me make a
modest non-political proposal. Instead of erect
ing yet another library — especially one for
which a quite untimely obsolescence has
already been predicted — we should do away
with some of the existing ones, raze the build
ings and paint nice white lines for compact cars.
The prime candidate for such conversion
might be the library presently under direction of
the Hoover Institution. That would serve several
excellent purposes.
It would do away with one of the most un
gainly architectural constructions ever — long
an aesthetic embarrassment and the butt of
numerous deplorable jokes.

It would give us a good-sized, accessible 'C'
lot, thereby pacifying all the people who now
chafe over having to leave their cars somewhere
near Mountain View or Redwood City.
It would indulge the predilection for laying
flat and paving over, a process honorary fellow
Reagan so heartily supported for Vietnam and
may now have somewhere in th • back of his
mind for Nicaragua and Cuba, not to mention
Lebanon, where it is already well underway.
Lest this seem like political irtisanship, I
propose that the pavement ( every little
parking space bear the name and face of Ronald
Reagan. And so, even though he was chosen by
a mere 25 percent of the electorate, for ever and
anon thousands upon thousands of people,
stretching far into the distant future, could vote
for him with their feet and wheels. What more
suitable memorial to a president of his stature
and achievement — and right here at Stanford
too?
