# Professor's Commentary: Robert Polhemus
## Defining a perfect world is a part of education 
### 
Prof. Robert Polhemus came
to Stanford in 1963 and has
been chairman of the English
Department since 1981. He
received the Dean's Award for
Distinguished Teaching in
1978-79 and was awarded a
Simon W. Guggenheim Fel
lowship in 1980-81. Polhemus
earned his bachelor's, master's
and doctoral degrees at UC-
Berkeley.
His most recent book,
"Comic Faith: Studies in the
Great Tradition from Austen to
loyce," was published in 1980.
The poet W. H. Auden said
that when someone sets up to
be a teacher of literature, he
should first imagine and ex
press his notion of Utopia, so
that the values he brings to his
subject, his own subjectivity,
will be clear. I now do this
sometimes at the beginning of
a course to stress that educa
tion, study and personal
values are not separate. If I
controlled the earth, my
properly-run fantasy world
would have these compo
nents:
Moral Code: The sermon on
the Mount and The Golden
Rule (do unto others what you
would have them do unto
you).
Constitutional Structure: A
combination of the American
Bill of Rights and an estab
lished, absolute, liberal
monarchy — King to be cho
sen for life by the election of
musicians from a list of the
greatest conductors presiding
over the best orchestras in the
world.
Political Organization: Un
der the monarchy, a system of
anarchic communism subtly
directed by a committee of fis
cally responsible bankers,
economic geniuses and incor
ruptible technocrats ap
pointed by the absolute au
thority of the conductor-King
(these men and women would
never be allowed to speak or
write publicly); they would
work in cooperation with
farmers and scientists who

know how to turn base metal
into gold and salt water into
fresh water.
Principal Virtues: Kindness,
gentleness, wit, humor,
generosity, imagination,
humility, pity, the courage to
face, know and then come up
out of despair, tolerance, the
sympathetic insight to imagine
what it would be like to be
someone else; interest in ar
tistic and natural beauty — in
fact, any kind of beauty;
politeness, charity, willing
ness to overlook people's
defects and psychological
hang-ups sometimes; concern
for the future, which, in
practical terms, often means
love and concern for children
and young people; enthusi
asm; gaiety; precision in lan
guage; a sense of wonder and
reverence for something
outside the self; intellectual
curiosity; industry; and the
desire to do excellent work.
Principal Vices (punishable by
guilt, heartburn and bouts of in
somnia): Surety, dogmatism,
certainty that one is right, a
refusal to understand that
human expression and actions
must be tentative, if we are to
retain our ability to change
our minds and not end up as
petrified fossils; pretentious
ness is bad; so is smugness;
so is calling moral whatever
benefits oneself. Other vices:
failure to believe in the
humanity of others; in
tolerance; arrogance; prideful
ignorance; pompous serious

ness and dignity, twin vices
which make for the climate of
fear and the totalitarian mind;
toadying to the powerful;
scorning the weak; living
without purpose; a bad sin to
be rewarded with a pie in the
face is a cool attitude towards
life; other serious sins are bul
lying, pinching, murder, rude
ness, sneering, snobbism,
cowardliness, refusal to help
the underdog, seeing people
as statistics and numbers, hate
for particular people (it's bet
ter to hate abstractions like
the government or big busi
ness); identifying with win
ners and despising what shal
low people call losers; distri
bution of questionnaires; lazi
ness.
Education Curricula: In
fancy: breast-feeding, un
limited fondling, relaxed
toilet-training, plenty of water
play, touching and bright
colors. Ages four to 17: fairy
tales, myths and legends;
dream interpretation, history
(presented on TV by the great
comedians of the world),
novel-reading, detective
stories, creative writing and
especially poetry; cooking,
painting, music, botany and
wood-craft; arithmetic, auto
mechanics, computer sci
ence; knowledge of
household appliances and
their repair; plumbing; child
care; folk medicine, drill that
there is no doctrine which is
not capable of eating out our
morality and humanity if un
checked by the habit of
fellow-feeling with individual
men and women (George
Eliot), and drill that you
mustn't worry about being
happy, but you should revel in
whatever joy and well-being
come along — happiness is
not a state but a recurrent ex
perience. Ages 17-21: college
or university education in
rooms with rugs and stuffed
chairs; thereafter specializa
tion; university sabbaticals of
two years each in your 30s and
40s and a mandatory second
college education at age 50.

One halt hour per day for all
over 15 spent in a luxurious li
brary. Speet hand deportment
lessons once every decade.
Public Entertainment:
Baseball; classical ballet;
modern dance; jazz concerts;
symphonies, blue-grass, pop,
and hard-rock festivals, live
drama (provided that no
theatre have more than five
rows so all can hear ans see);
grand opera sung perfectly in
English by slender people;
movies, provided that they
have no special effects; pro
football on TV without beer
commercials; tennis; night
club singers and stand-up
comics; zoos — very un
derrated as entertainment and
education.
Ethnic Make-up: Varied, as in
the USA; all races.
Climate: Central California
Coast, but without the fog.
Food: Choices and varieties
from the three great cuisines
of the world: French, with ex
otic sauces made from fresh
butter bases; Chinese, both
Cantonese and northern, to
be eaten without chopsticks;
and, of course that other spe
cial cuisine: American drive-in
— California variety, featuring
cheeseburgers, fries, tacos,
onion rings, colas and hot
dogs.
Religious Observation: Any
harmless reverence towards
anything, such as flower
worship, provided that it
doesn't play strange numbers
games such as "three is one"
and "we are all one" and pro
vided that it isn't taken
seriously enough to make you

hate others who don't wor
ship the way you think they
should; private meditation;
holy-rolling; genuine prayer
and thanksgiving for such
things as color, taste, trees,
sexuality, books, and
eyesight; also attendance at
the great European gothic ca
thedrals like Chartres at high
mass; also communal bacchic
celebrations in springtime.
Economic Organization:
Automation of labor,
guaranteed annual income for
all, especially for what George
Bernard Shaw calls the
"undeserving poor," because
they need one so much; un
limited and safe distribution of
the infinitely powerful but
beneficient energy of sun
shine delivered in glass milk
bottles by formerly un
employed milkmen, super
vised by the scientists who
turned air and sunlight to a
perfect fuel.
Sources of Contemporary In
formation: New Yorker car
toons, the National Lampoon,
gossip (always our most accu
rate form of communication),
scandal magazines and colum
nists, intellectual journals, TV
panel shows featuring discus
sions by irresponsible wits,
contemporary poems and
novels — but all news pro
grams and mass-circulation
papers and newsmagazines to
be banned.
Dress: Eclectic, unpredicta
ble, varied, shocking; bright
colors, stress on showy ex
hibitionism and sexiness for
both men and women; for

men, tails, evening dress,
Levis, togas and Elizabethan
tunics with cod-pieces; for
women, floor-length evening
gowns with gardenia corsages,
see-through blouses, jeans,
flimsy halters, bikinis; public
nudism one day a week — not
for sleazy salacious reasons,
but just so that people will ex
ercise and diet properly.
Ten Most Underrated Human
Endeavors: 1. Reading; 2.
Daydreaming; 3. Agriculture;
4. Impractical Scholarship; 5.
Crossword Puzzles; 6. Diary
writing; 7. Engineering; 8.
Bird-watching; 9. Talking to
the elderly; 10. Composing
poems for the one you love.
Inescapable Facts That All
Citizens Learn to Face and Un
derstand in the Well-run Com
monwealth: The recurrent and
alternating horror and glory of
life; the games that people in
evitably play — games such as
one-upmanship, one-down
manship, get-even with
Mom or Dad or Brother or Sis
— or women or men — by
bashing others and/or
oneself; the power of material
interest to determine life's
shape; the ineluctable shatter
ing of dreams; the threat of
time and disintegration; the
poverty and hunger of mil
lions which makes life on
earth a mockery of what we
would like it to be; the selfish
ness of people and our own
egotism; people's limitations
— mental, physical and historical
— which they cannot help; the
real possibility that humanity
now can and will destroy itself,
and our responsibility to

try to keep the bombs from
going off; the existence of two
sexes rather than one, and of
parents and children — we
take these phenomenal facts
for granted but they make
human relationships inevitab
ly difficult and awful and won
derful and thrilling; th t
widespread existence on deep
levels of racism and ethnic
chauvinism which are present
everywhere and a matter of in
calculable historical sig
nificance. One truly startling
inescapable fact is the marvel
of human consciousness that
judges what is by what might
be, and thus knows its misery
and deprivation, but knows
also its own defiant, mighty
and progressive powers; last
ly, in my well-ordered com
monwealth, citizens would re
member that they are mem
bers of a species that has in
vented whips, switch-blades,
barbed wire, jails, the rack and
napalm, and also the violin,
the alphabet, jet planes, the
oboe, ballet, penicillin and
tap-dancing — a species that
has created, besides warfare,
Marx Brothers movies, Astaire
and Rogers musicals and
greenhouses for flowers.
Most Interesting Subjects for
Thought and Study in Utopia:
Water, language and love.
I know this has been sell
indulgent, but my serious
point is to urge people to tr\
somehow, in some way, t
discover and articulate some
day their own Utopias and thu
their own dreams, ideals
That's an indispensable part <
education.
