# Hospital employees charged in drug bust
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Acting on a tip from a Stanford
University Hospital employee, Palo
Alto police culminated a five-month
investigation Thursday with the ar
rests of six Hospital employees on
cirug-reidted charges.
Palo Alto Police Lieutenant Lynne
Johnson said more arrests might be
made before the investigation is
over.
Five of the men were taken to the
North County Jail, where they were
later released on bail ranging from
$500 to $1500, while the sixth, who
was taken to San Mateo County Jail,
was not there as of yesterday after
noon. San Mateo jail officials would
not say when and under what cir
cumstances he had been released.
The six men were:
• Michael Robinson, a mail
courier, who was arrested at his
home in San Carlos on charges of
selling methamphetamines —
stimulants for the central nervous
system;
•David Cannon, a pharmacy tech
nician, who was arrested at his Palo
Alto home on charges of selling con
trolled substances from the phar
macy. The substances allegedly
included codeine, Talwin and
Valium;
• Craig Julien, a linen assistant,
who was arrested for the sale of
cocaine as he was leaving work;
• Randall Creamier, an operating
room orderly, who was arrested for
the sale of cocaine soon after he left
the hospital;
• Kirk Williams, a pharmacy tech
nician who was arrested in a hospital
corridor for possession of stolen
property and sale of controlled sub
stances from the hospital's phar
macy;
• Rommel Day, a dietary assistant
who was arrested at home for the
sale of cocaine. Police also arrested
Day's roommate, Elizabeth Ellis, for
the sale of methamphetamines after
searching the pair's home.
The arrests occurred after a five
month investigation instigated by
hospital officials, who had received
reports about suspected drug sales
at the hospital. The Palo Alto Police

Department and a special drug task
force, the Allied Agencies Narcotics
Enforcement Team (ANET), which is
made up of agents from seven
county police agencies, joined to
gether in an operation which had,
on average, four or five officers par
ticipating at any one time.
Carole Price, an associate admin
istrator of the Hospital, said that she
will lead an internal investigation
into the case, using interviews with
those arrested and evidence ob
tained by the police. After that, she
said, an investigatory panel will
make a determination of the
suspects' future status as hospital
employees.
All of this could occur before the
outcome of the suspects' trials is
known, Price said.
According to police, the men,
who had been placed under surveil
lance, made sales to undercover of
ficers. Johnson said several of the
suspects were arrested by under
cover officers to whom they had al
legedly sold drugs.
Cannon, arrested for allegedly
selling controlled substances, said
that undercover officers ap
proached him three times asking to
buy drugs. Cannon said that each
time he refused to sell to them.
"They don't even have a case on
me," he said.
Cannon is to be arraigned Dec. 7,
and the other five should all be ar
raigned within 30 days, according to
prison officials.
The others who were arrested
could not be reached for comment.
Sheldon King, the director of the
Hospital, said that the investigation
began after a hospital employee,
whom he would not identify, told
hospital officials that another em
ployee was selling drugs. At that
point hospital officials called in the
Palo Alto police.
King would not say whether more
stringent security procedures would
be instituted in the pharmacy,
where some drugs were allegedly
stolen, but he noted that there is
"no procedure that can prevent this
from happening."
