## Cardinal plays Santa Claus one month early First Cal victory ever at DeGuerre Poloists lose Big Splash to Bears 
### ROB ZWEIG 
The UC-Berkeley water polo team,
ranked No.l nationally, broke open a de
fensive struggle with two late fourth per
iod goals and added another in the
waning seconds to secure a 6-3 victory
over the Stanford water polo team in the
annual "Big Splash" match between the
Bay Area rivals.
The Bears capitalized on two Stanford
errors to turn a 3-3 tie into its 26th win of
the year against three losses and two ties,
and sent their partisans in the jam-packed
DeGuerre Pool crowd off to Big Game
with one victory under their belts.
With less than five minutes remaining
in the final stanza, Card freshman Chris
Thompson fumbled the ball out of
bounds under heavy defensive pressure.
The ensuing outlet pass hit Cal's Colin
Thompson in full stride and he beat
goalie Steve Moyer one-on-one for what
proved to be the game-winning goal.
Three minutes later, Moyer again found

himself helpless to stop two on-rushing
Bears. Moyer made a nice save and then
flicked a quick outlet pass to freshman
Greg Gamble. Unfortunately, Gamble
was not looking and Cal's Peter Cutino
swooped in to pluck the ball away. Alan
Gresham quickly joined him and tapped
in Cutino's pass to boost the Bears advan
tage to 5-3 with only 1:20 to be played.
Those two scores drowned Stanford's
valiant effort for a season-ending upset of
NCAA-championship-bound Cal and
sealed the Bears' first ever victory against
the Cardinal at DeGuerre.
The upset bid began sluggishly enough
as Gresham, California's leading scorer,
opened the affair with his 46th goal of the
year to give Cal a 1-0 lead at 5:12 of the
opening quarter.
After the two clubs traded steals and
turnovers, Chris Woolfolk got Stanford
on the board with a little drop shot tally
on the counter attack. Stanford Head
Coach Dante Dettamanti then followed

his pre-game substitution plans and
threw his small and fast unit into battle.
The move worked when Card freshman
Grant Stanley fired a bullet by Cal
goaltender Shaun Cleary after Cresham
had been booted out of the water for a
foul during dead time.
But Cleary was about to gain his
revenge. The junior turned the second
quarter into his own, stifling Stanford on
no less than four six-on-five man advan
tages. Meanwhile, his teammates
stopped shooting at the three sides of the
goal long enough to beat the Card's start
ing goalie Martin Fisher.
John Felix sent the two teams to the
halftime intermission tied at 2-2 when his
cross-cage shot deflected off Fisher's
hands and into the net with 4:59 remain
ing in the first half.
Cal took a brief 3-2 lead when Matt
Biondi took a pass from Felix and con
verted. Stanford's second half goalie
