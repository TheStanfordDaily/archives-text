# Stanford fumbles away Big Game to Cal
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
Saturday's Big Game cap
sulized the Stanford football
team's entire season.
Every mistake, bad break
and penalty seemed to re
emerge as Stanford turned the
ball over seven times, losing
to UC-Berkeley 27-18.
While most of the game was
not very exciting, the Cardinal
did provide some fireworks in
the closing minutes and for a
few short seconds it seemed
like it might be Stanford's turn
to pull off the miracle this
year.
With 43 seconds left in the
game and Stanford behind 27-
12, Mark Harmon kicked a 38-
y? r d field goal, capping a 50-
yard drive.
The Cardinal then
recovered an onsides kick and
immediately scored again
when freshman quarterback
John Paye hit Eric Mullins for a
53-yard touchdown pass
closing the gap to 27-18. A
two-point conversion try
which would have put the Car
dinal within a touchdown
failed, however, and with it,
any chance for a Stanford
comeback.
In any case, these last min
ute heroics were too little, too
late.
Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin
said that there was no ques
tion that his team was both
prepared for the game and up
for it emotionally, but he ac
knowledged that he did not
use his forced resignation as a
rally cry for the team.

"It wasn't a teary kind of
thing/' Wiggin said. "It was
done in a legitimate way."
The real problem with Stan
ford's performance, according
to Wiggin, was the turnovers.
"We had eight (technically
seven, but Wiggin included
Tripp Hardin's 3-yard punt)
turnovers," Wiggin said.
"There's no way you're going
to win with that many turn
overs. You only get the ball a
certain number of times in a
game. You can not give the
other team that many extra
chances with the ball. There
were penalties, turnovers and
an inability to put the ball in
the end zone."
On the afternoon, Stanford
outgained Cal on the ground
and through the air. The Car
dinal had 119 yards on the
ground compared with 114 for
the Bears, and added 303 pass
ing yards compared with 261
for Cal.
Cardinal tight end Jim
Clymer agreed with Wiggin's
assessment of the game.
"I think we were ready to
play," he said, "bad weather
and turnovers were the prob
lems. I felt bad because I
wanted Paul Wiggin to go out
a winner. I guess this just
wasn't our year."
Even after the game,
however, Wiggin refused to
blame his players for the loss
and did not leave any doubt
about the way he felt about
the future of Stanford football.
"The defense went out
there time and time again,"
Wiggin said. "They kept their
heads up. This team didn't
quit. When you look at Paye,
(halfback Thomas) Henley and
(fullback Marshall) Dillard,
there's a good future out
there."
Cal Coach Joe Kapp thought

the difference in the game was
the play of the Bear seniors.
"I thought the game was
very well played, especially
under the conditions," Kapp
said. "I think our seniors were
the difference. We have most
ly a senior defensive unit. Our
other advantage was that we
had a junior at quarterback.
Our defense put enough pres
sure on John (Paye) to make
the outcome the way it was."

One of the most significant
performances came from
senior Bear linebacker Ron
Rivera, according to Kapp.
"Ron Rivera continued to
spend a lot of time in the Stan
ford backfield," Kapp said. "I
think that he played a hard hit
ting game."
Cal did a good job of shut
ting down Stanford's passing
game to the outside receivers,
Emile Harry and Mike Tolliver.
Harry had four receptions for
65 yards, while Tolliver was
limited to just one reception
for 22 yards.
Card tight end Jim Clymer,
however, had his second Big
game in a row, catching eight
passes for 110 yards. His most
effective route was a tight end
delay pattern which hadn't
been used earlier this year.
Cal got on the board first
with 2:46 left in the first quar
ter as Gilbert connected on a
37-yard touchdown pass to
tight end David Lewis. The 30-
yard Bear drive followed a 3-
yard punt by Stanford's Har
din.
Stanford tame right back
and drove down to the Cal 11-
yard line before being
stopped and having to settle
for a Mark Harmon field goal.
In the second quarter, Cal
mounted an 83-yard drive
capped by a 1-yard run by Bear
running back Dwight Garner,
increasing the Cal lead to 14-3.
Before the end of the half,
Stanford closed the gap to 14-9
as Paye hit Harry on a 17-yard
touchdown pass. The Cardinal
opted to go for two points on
the conversion attempt,
however, and missed as Paye
was sacked.
The turning point in the
game was on Stanford's
opening drive of the second
half according to Paye. The

Cardinal marched the ball
down to the Bear 10-yard line.
With first-anri goal at the 10,
Paye fumbled a snap from cen
ter and the ball was recoverd
by Cal linebacker Chris
Hampton.
"I thought that the fumble
was the turning point in the
game," Paye said. "I just
didn't have a clear exchange
from center."
The Bears added to their
lead in the third quarter when
Gilbert audibled at the line of
scrimmage and hit receiver
Andy Bark in the left corner of
the end zone.
Cal kicker Randy Pratt
added two field goals in the
fourth quarter before Stan
ford's last minute nine-point
barrage.
From the locker room:
• Stanford safety Darrell Gris
sum who was injured in Satur
day's game and was carried off
the field in an ambulance, was
listed in stable condition at
Stanford Medical Center after
suffering a spinal cord contu
sion in the third quarter of the
game.
• At his news conference fol
lowing the game, Wiggin
seemed relaxed and joked
with the members of the
press. He re-emphasized that
there are no hard feelings be
tween himself and Stanford
Athletic Director Andy Ceiger.
"I had a positive relationship
with my boss," Wiggin said.
• At the post-game news con
ference Kapp refused to com
ment on Wiggin's situation at
Stanford but he did put the
role of a coach in perspective.
"It's the players game," he
said. "It's the players that have
to come up with the big
plays."

which would have put the Car
dinal within a touchdown
failed, however, and with it,
any chance for a Stanford
comeback.
In any case, these last min
ute heroics were too little, too
late.
Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin
said that there was no ques
tion that his team was both
prepared for the game and up
for it emotionally, but he ac
knowledged that he did not
use his forced resignation as a
rally cry for the team.

"It wasn't a teary kind of
thing/' Wiggin said. "It was
done in a legitimate way."
The real problem with Stan
ford's performance, according
to Wiggin, was the turnovers.
"We had eight (technically
seven, but Wiggin included
Tripp Hardin's 3-yard punt)
turnovers," Wiggin said.
"There's no way you're going
to win with that many turn
overs. You only get the ball a
certain number of times in a
game. You can not give the
other team that many extra
chances with the ball. There
were penalties, turnovers and
an inability to put the ball in
the end zone."
On the afternoon, Stanford
outgained Cal on the ground
and through the air. The Car
dinal had 119 yards on the
ground compared with 114 for
the Bears, and added 303 pass
ing yards compared with 261
for Cal.
Cardinal tight end Jim
Clymer agreed with Wiggin's
assessment of the game.
"I think we were ready to
play," he said, "bad weather
and turnovers were the prob
lems. I felt bad because I
wanted Paul Wiggin to go out
a winner. I guess this just
wasn't our year."
Even after the game,
however, Wiggin refused to
blame his players for the loss
and did not leave any doubt
about the way he felt about
the future of Stanford football.
"The defense went out
there time and time again,"
Wiggin said. "They kept their
heads up. This team didn't
quit. When you look at Paye,
(halfback Thomas) Henley and
(fullback Marshall) Dillard,
there's a good future out
there."
Cal Coach Joe Kapp thought

the difference in the game was
the play of the Bear seniors.
"I thought the game was
very well played, especially
under the conditions," Kapp
said. "I think our seniors were
the difference. We have most
ly a senior defensive unit. Our
other advantage was that we
had a junior at quarterback.
Our defense put enough pres
sure on John (Paye) to make
the outcome the way it was."

One of the most significant
performances came from
senior Bear linebacker Ron
Rivera, according to Kapp.
"Ron Rivera continued to
spend a lot of time in the Stan
ford backfield," Kapp said. "I
think that he played a hard hit
ting game."
Cal did a good job of shut
ting down Stanford's passing
game to the outside receivers,
Emile Harry and Mike Tolliver.
Harry had four receptions for
65 yards, while Tolliver was
limited to just one reception
for 22 yards.
Card tight end Jim Clymer,
however, had his second Big
game in a row, catching eight
passes for 110 yards. His most
effective route was a tight end
delay pattern which hadn't
been used earlier this year.
Cal got on the board first
with 2:46 left in the first quar
ter as Gilbert connected on a
37-yard touchdown pass to
tight end David Lewis. The 30-
yard Bear drive followed a 3-
yard punt by Stanford's Har
din.
Stanford tame right back
and drove down to the Cal 11-
yard line before being
stopped and having to settle
for a Mark Harmon field goal.
In the second quarter, Cal
mounted an 83-yard drive
capped by a 1-yard run by Bear
running back Dwight Garner,
increasing the Cal lead to 14-3.
Before the end of the half,
Stanford closed the gap to 14-9
as Paye hit Harry on a 17-yard
touchdown pass. The Cardinal
opted to go for two points on
the conversion attempt,
however, and missed as Paye
was sacked.
The turning point in the
game was on Stanford's
opening drive of the second
half according to Paye. The

Cardinal marched the ball
down to the Bear 10-yard line.
With first-anri goal at the 10,
Paye fumbled a snap from cen
ter and the ball was recoverd
by Cal linebacker Chris
Hampton.
"I thought that the fumble
was the turning point in the
game," Paye said. "I just
didn't have a clear exchange
from center."
The Bears added to their
lead in the third quarter when
Gilbert audibled at the line of
scrimmage and hit receiver
Andy Bark in the left corner of
the end zone.
Cal kicker Randy Pratt
added two field goals in the
fourth quarter before Stan
ford's last minute nine-point
barrage.
From the locker room:
• Stanford safety Darrell Gris
sum who was injured in Satur
day's game and was carried off
the field in an ambulance, was
listed in stable condition at
Stanford Medical Center after
suffering a spinal cord contu
sion in the third quarter of the
game.
• At his news conference fol
lowing the game, Wiggin
seemed relaxed and joked
with the members of the
press. He re-emphasized that
there are no hard feelings be
tween himself and Stanford
Athletic Director Andy Ceiger.
"I had a positive relationship
with my boss," Wiggin said.
• At the post-game news con
ference Kapp refused to com
ment on Wiggin's situation at
Stanford but he did put the
role of a coach in perspective.
"It's the players game," he
said. "It's the players that have
to come up with the big
plays."

Stanford receivers Eric Mullins (above) and Emile Harry (below) catch touchdown passes in
Saturday's Big Game. Mullins made his catch in the closing minutes of the game on a 53-yard
touchdown strike from quarterback John Paye, while Harry pulled down a 17-yard pass in
the second quarter.
Saturday's Big Game cap
sulized the Stanford football
team's entire season.
Every mistake, bad break
and penalty seemed to re
emerge as Stanford turned the
ball over seven times, losing
to UC-Berkeley 27-18.
While most of the game was
not very exciting, the Cardinal
did provide some fireworks in
the closing minutes and for a
few short seconds it seemed
like it might be Stanford's turn
to pull off the miracle this
year.
With 43 seconds left in the
game and Stanford behind 27-
12, Mark Harmon kicked a 38-
y? r d field goal, capping a 50-
yard drive.
The Cardinal then
recovered an onsides kick and
immediately scored again
when freshman quarterback
John Paye hit Eric Mullins for a
53-yard touchdown pass
closing the gap to 27-18. A
two-point conversion try
