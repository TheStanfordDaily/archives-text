# Stanford fumbles away Big Game to Cal
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
Saturday's Big Game cap
sulized the Stanford football
team's entire season.
Every mistake, bad break
and penalty seemed to re
emerge as Stanford turned the
ball over seven times, losing
to UC-Berkeley 27-18.
While most of the game was
not very exciting, the Cardinal
did provide some fireworks in
the closing minutes and for a
few short seconds it seemed
like it might be Stanford's turn
to pull off the miracle this
year.
With 43 seconds left in the
game and Stanford behind 27-
12, Mark Harmon kicked a 38-
y? r d field goal, capping a 50-
yard drive.
The Cardinal then
recovered an onsides kick and
immediately scored again
when freshman quarterback
John Paye hit Eric Mullins for a
53-yard touchdown pass
closing the gap to 27-18. A
two-point conversion try
which would have put the Car
dinal within a touchdown
failed, however, and with it,
any chance for a Stanford
comeback.
In any case, these last min
ute heroics were too little, too
late.
Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin
said that there was no ques
tion that his team was both
prepared for the game and up
for it emotionally, but he ac
knowledged that he did not
use his forced resignation as a
rally cry for the team.

"It wasn't a teary kind of
thing/' Wiggin said. "It was
done in a legitimate way."
The real problem with Stan
ford's performance, according
to Wiggin, was the turnovers.
"We had eight (technically
seven, but Wiggin included
Tripp Hardin's 3-yard punt)
turnovers," Wiggin said.
"There's no way you're going
to win with that many turn
overs. You only get the ball a
certain number of times in a
game. You can not give the
other team that many extra
chances with the ball. There
were penalties, turnovers and
an inability to put the ball in
the end zone."
On the afternoon, Stanford
outgained Cal on the ground
and through the air. The Car
dinal had 119 yards on the
ground compared with 114 for
the Bears, and added 303 pass
ing yards compared with 261
for Cal.
Cardinal tight end Jim
Clymer agreed with Wiggin's
assessment of the game.
"I think we were ready to
play," he said, "bad weather
and turnovers were the prob
lems. I felt bad because I
wanted Paul Wiggin to go out
a winner. I guess this just
wasn't our year."
Even after the game,
however, Wiggin refused to
blame his players for the loss
and did not leave any doubt
about the way he felt about
the future of Stanford football.
"The defense went out
