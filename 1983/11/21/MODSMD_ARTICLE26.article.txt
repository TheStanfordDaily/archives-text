# Paul Wiggin's Last Stand
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Wiggin's Last Stand was not made on the
top of a hill someplace in Eastern Montana.
It took place in Room 315 of Encina Gym — a
small, cold room a quarter of a mile from
Stanford Stadium.
Encina, Room 315 is a simple room. It's
comprised of about 35 chairs, one long
table, a few chalkboards, two windows and
four walls. But on this Saturday afternoon,
the room was a bustle of action.
On the table lay a dozen microphones,
pointed at the lone chair behind the
wooden table like guns in a firing squad. A
few yards behind the microphones were
four television cameras. And surrounding
the table and the cameras were 75 people,
nearly all of them men, with notebooks and
pens in hand.
Paul Wiggin, who had just coached his last
football game at Stanford, fought his way
through the bunches of reporters and finally
to the only empty chair in the room — the
one behind the table with the microphones
from every major radio and television sta
tion in the Bay Area.
There were bright lights, too. Besides the
row of overhead lights in the room, the tele
vision people had brought hot, bright lights
of their own and pointed them directly at
the Stanford coach who officially an
nounced his resignation ten days ago.
For Wiggin, his final session with the press
could have been a painful one. There could
be the tearful goodbyes to Stanford and the
"I came here to do a job and I guess I didn't
do it" speeches.
There was none of that, however. Despite
the circus lights and the circus atmosphere,
Wiggin handled himself with the greatest of
ease.
Once seated, Wiggin looked around the
room, his mouth shut tight as a drum, and
waited patiently for the opening question.
But the various reporters in Encina Room 315
were hesitant to break the ice. Finally, a
sportswriter asked Wiggin to generally
assess the Big Game Stanford had just lost
27-18 to its rivals, UC-Berkeley.
"I think what you saw out there is what
this season has been all about," he said.
"We had eight turnovers and there's no way
you can win a football game doing that.
"There were penalties, there were turn
overs and there was the inability to get the
ball in the end zone."

A few minutes later, Wiggin again was
asked about the game in general and how
his team lost, leaving it with a 1-10 record on
the season — the worst for a Stanford team
since 1960.
"I think we let it get too far away," he
said. "I don't think we could have prepared
our team any better. I thought if we were
able to win the game, it would have to come
with emotion."
So, the reporter asked, is Cal a better
team? "Probably," Wiggin answered.
Wiggin also spoke of his players and in
particular his 18-year-old starting quarter
back John Paye.
"He's going to be the next poster child,"
Wiggin said of Paye. "When they've got
(former Stanford quaterbacks Jim) Plunkett
and (John) Elway on it (the 'poster'), he'll be
on there somewhere, too.
"Think about it. He's only 18 years old.
When I was 18 years old, I was blowing the
straws across the room at the drive-in
thing."


Paul Wiggin
After the Paye question,
someone had the courage to
inquire what his feelings were
on leaving Stanford. Here
comes the emotion, everyone
thought. But it never came.
Wiggin remained poised and
answered the question.
"I don't feel total failure,"
he said. "I know the W's and
L's tell one thing." Wiggin
then went on to say he felt he
never gave up on himself or
his team, even though he was
asked to resign at mid-season.
"I like that about myself.
Vou know pretty early that the
honeymoon is over so you
lame-duck it. I didn't do that. I
feel good about that element
of me. Whatever it is, it ain't
bad."
Next came the question

about what Wiggin would do
now that his tenure at Stan
ford had ended. "I had a shoe
salesman offer a week ago. Is
that still open?" he said, refer
ring to a reporter's question
last week if Wiggin would go
back into coaching or do
something like "sell shoes."
"I'm going to take a look at
who I am and what I am,"
Wiggin continued. "Hell, I
don't know what I'm going to
do. Maybe I'll sell shoes."
The reporters laughed. The
press conference was moving
away from the serious tone
present at its beginning and
Wiggin's Last Stand was com
ing to a close. The reporters
weie running out of pertinent
questions to ask the now ex
coach and there were
deadlines to meet.
One final question was
asked. Wiggin answered it,
said "Is that all?" and walked
out of Encina Room 315 — for
the last time.
