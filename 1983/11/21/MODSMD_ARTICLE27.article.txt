# Stanford men's swimming team squeaks by Texas
## 
### MICHAEL LLERANDI 
The Stanford men's swimming team
ended up on top 57-56 after a seesaw dual
with the University of Texas Friday at
DeGuerre Pool. The Cardinal had four first
and-second-place sweeps to three for the
Longhorns in what proved to be one of the
most exciting home dual meets in years.
"I wish I could have watched it all from
up (in the stands)," Stanford Head Coach
Skip Kenney said with relief. "It was one
hell of a meet."
Stanford enjoyed an early 7-0 lead after
Dave Bottom, John Moffett, Pablo Morales
and Sam Worden combined to set a new
pool record in the 400-yard medley relay
with a time of 3:20.71. The Card then in
creased its lead to 15-1 when U.S. record
holder Jeff Kostoff teamed up with Dave
Sims to sweep the 1000-yard freestyle.
Texas began to take control with a victory
in the 200 freestyle, but it was Stanford's
Dave Louden whose strong charge in the
final 50 yards pulled off a vital second place

for the Cardinal.
Momentum then seemed to change
hands as the Longhorns finished 1-2 in the
50-yard freestyle to tighten the score to 19-
15 in favor of Stanford. The Cardinal lead
was cut to one after the 200 IM, with Stan
ford sophomore Mike Reynolds' strong
finish providing more clutch second place
points.
The meet was tied at 26 after the one me
ter diving, where Stanford's Thor Johnson
and Tom Rothenbucher finished 2-3 behind
Texas All-America Matt Scoggin.
The next event was billed as "one of the
best 200 butterfly heats ever assembled in a
dual meet," featuring six of the top 12 but
terfliers in the country. It was Jon Denny
providing the spark for the Cardinal, finish
ing a strong first (1:48.50) ahead of
teammate Morales in second (1:49.12) and a
dejected Rick Carey in third (1:49.33) for
the Longhorns.
"You could feel the electricity from the

crowd after that point," Kenney com
mented on the Denny-Morales sweep.
Texas managed to pull back into a tie
after the 100 free, and went ahead for the
first time 43-36 after the 200 backstroke.
That was to be the only time Stanford
would trail in the meet, as Kostoff and Sims
tied it up at 44 by producing yet another 1-2
finish for the Card, this time in the 500
freestyle.
Rothenbucher's first place finish over the
Longhorns' defending NCAA champion
Scoggin in the 3-meter diving put the Car
dinal ahead for good, 49-48. "After our
divers performed the way they did, we
knew we could clinch the meet before the
last (400 freestyle) relay," Stanford's Dave
Bottom recalled. "They were really out
standing today."
Stanford then dominated the 200
breaststroke, with Moffet finishing ahead of
Cardinal swimmers David Lundberg and
John Simons, giving the Card the needed 57
points for the win
