# Gilbert's leadership important for Bears
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
For UC-Berkeley quarterback Gale Gilbert, his key per
formance in Cal's 27-18 Big Game victory was little more
than a pleasant Saturday afternoon.
Gilbert directed an unspectacular — yet effective —
Bear offense with timely passing as Cal easily outscored
Stanford's turnover-laden attack. The 6-foot-3 junior, who
leads the Pacific-10 in five passing categories, completed
22 of 40 passes for 263 yards and two touchdowns.
After the game, however, Gilbert seemed unmoved by
both the victory and the fact that his performance enabled
him to set a new team season passing mark of 2506 yards.
"I wish I could have broken the record last week and
had more to do with the outcome of last week's game (a
16-6 loss to Washington State)," Gilbert said after the
game. "Maybe we would have had a chance at a bowl
game."
The quarterback avoided taking credit for the win,
choosing instead to praise his offensive teammates for the
passing game's success.
"It was a combination of many things," Gilbert said.
Our line was playing its best game, our running backs
were running good routes (and) our receivers were run
ning good routes and were really sure-handed."
While Cal's running game did not provide spectacular
plays and was responsible for only 76 yards, it was produc
tive enough to keep Stanford's defense from keying on
the Bears' passing attack. Gilbert said the Cal running at
tack was "enough," adding that adequate rushing was
necessary to the Bears' passing plans.
Cal was not bothered by Stanford's pass defense which
was No. 1 in the Pac-10 going into the game. "I think that
people hadn't went at them so hard because their (other
teams') running games had been so successful. We felt
they really hadn't been tested," Gilbert said.
Instead of being concerned with Stanford's pass
defense, the Bears emphasized execution.
Stanford has "one of the best pass defenses in the con
ferences, as (its) record shows," Cal Coach Joe Kapp ac
knowledged after the game. "It (winning)was a matter of
playing the best way we could (with) nothing special."
"Our advantage was probably the fact that we have a
quarterback who has had experience and I thought our
defensive unit put enough pressure on young John (Paye,
Stanford's quarterback) to cause the outcome to turn out
like it was," Kapp said.
Gilbert, who has been the Bears' starting quarterback
since the beginning of last season, showed his experience
in the third quarter. There was a long delay after Stanford
free safety Darrell Grissum suffered a career-ending spinal
injury.
At the time, Cal was driving in Stanford territory. After
Grissum was taken from the field, Gilbert, unaffected, cul
minated the drive less than a minute later with a perfectly
timed 10-yard touchdown lob to Andy Bark.
"Stanford has had an outstanding defense and Gale did,
in my opinion, a masterful job of quarterbacking," Kapp
said. "He called audibles and hit key passes."
