# Injured Grissum gives up football
## 
### 
Stanford junior safety
Darrell Grissum, who suf
fered a spinal contusion in
Saturday's game against
UC-Berkeley, announced
yesterday that he will no
longer play football.
Grissum was taken off
the field in an ambulance to
the Stanford Medical Cen
ter during the third quarter
and at the time of the injury
had no feeling in his lower
extremities. Initially he was
listed as being in serious
but stable condition.
Yesterday, his condition
was upgraded to stable and
he regained feeling in the
lower part of his body.
"It was really scary being
taken off the field by am
bulance. If I continue to
play, I would probably be
bucking the odds," Gris

sum said yesterday. "I'm
just not that much of a
gambler. I found out what I
needed to find out. I have
decided to give up foot
ball."
Also taken into consider
ation was an injury sus
tained earlier in the season,
during the UCLA game, in
which Grissum pinched a
nerve in his neck. At that
time, he was also taken off
the field in an ambulance
and initially lost feeling in
his hands.
Grissum, who made the
Stanford basketball team
and travelled to Japan this
past summer as a member
of it, still plans to go out for
basketball depending on
how fast his recovery goes.
He is expected to be
released from the hospital
today.
