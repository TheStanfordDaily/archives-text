### RICHARD LYNCH Staff writer 
The Friday night Big Game rally in
San Francisco — the first ever held
under new guidelines instituted by
the San Francisco Police Depart
ment — went smoothly with no ar
rests, according to rally organizers.
Max Scheder, co-chairman of the
committee which was responsible
for scheduling and planning the ral-

ly, said he was very pleased with the
overall conduct of the rally.
"People really seemed to enjoy
themselves and have a good time
and didn't cause much trouble,"
Scheder said.
There was a general consensus
that both the crowd and the
monitors were responsible for the
success of the rally. The monitors,

who numbered more than 100
and were mostly members of
Stanford fraternities, con
trolled the march route and
the rally at Aquatic Park.
Gary Robinson, the Band
manager whose term expired
at the end of Saturday's game,
said, "The monitors did a
damn good job."
Scheder also noted that the
monitors were helpful.
"The monitors kept people
in the staging area before the
march started," he said.
"Once the march began, they
kept people from interfering
with the Band."
The calm behavior of the ral
liers also contributed to the
success of the event.
"During the march, the
people did a good job, "

Scheder said. "The monitors
were there just in case."
There were no arrests re
ported in the crowd of approx
imately 5500-6000. Scheder
said this year's rally was the
most peaceful one he could
remember.

He also noted that "police
were happy with the rally. The
police I talked to praised the
monitors and the students
highly."
Patty Stokes, a Band repre
sentative to the Fiesta Com
mittee which organized the

rally, credited the committee
for the students' behavior.
"We made an effort before
the rally to let people how
serious the situation was and
how important this rally was,"
she said. "People responded
well."


NOT JUST HORSING AROUND: Mounled police officers were among the many enforces
keeping an eye on Stanford students at Friday's festivities in San Francisco.
