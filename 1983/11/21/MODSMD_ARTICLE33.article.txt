# Spikers crush Fullerton
## 
### TOM MOORE 
Despite a tough loss the
previous evening to UCLA, the
Stanford women's volleyball
team rebounded to demolish
Cal State-Fullerton in three
games Friday night at Cal State
Fullerton.
"That win put us back on
the right track," said Cardinal
assistant coach Don Shaw
after the women spikers had
completed the 19-17,15-4,15-6
decision. "We were under
standably a little flat in the first
game (post-UCLA) but we
came around."
Stanford shuffled its lineup
against Fullerton, giving
players cast in seasonal sup
porting roles extensive playing
time "Everyone got a chance
to play in this one," Shaw
said, "and as a whole we
played real well."
The victory upped the Car
dinal conference mark to 10-3,
giving the team a virtual lock
on a second place finish in the
WCAA. Stanford's overall slate
new stands at 17-7. Winless in
the conference, Cal State-
Fullerton dropped to 5-25 on
the season.
The Card now turns its at
tention to the regular season
finale at Maples Pavilion to
morrow night against Cal State
Long Beach. The match will
also be the final home match
for senior starters Julie Baker
and Kari Rush. Though there is
a slight possibility for Stan
ford's first-round NCAA match
to be held at the Maples, the
Long Beach contest will prob
ably be the last time Stanford
fans can watch Rush and Baker
in action. The match will start
at 7 p.m.
