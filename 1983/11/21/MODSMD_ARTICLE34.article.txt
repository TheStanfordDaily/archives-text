# U.S., China sign high-energy physics agreement

### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Representatives from the People's Republic
of China and the United States signed an agree
ment here last week continuing the "mutual ex
change of experience" in the field of high
energy physics, according to Doug Dupen,
director of personnel at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC).
The Chinese, who are presently constructing
their first accelerator, will have continued

access to study the design of the linear ac
celerator here under the agreement, Dupen
said. The design of the Chinese machine is
closer to that of Stanford's than to the other
three accelerators in the United States, he said.
China and the United States first signed an
agreement for the exchange of scientific and
medical knowledge in 1979, and high-energy
physics is part of this "umbrella" agreement,
Dupen said.
"Stanford happened to be the host this year,"

Dupen said, for the signing of the contract
which is renegotiated annually.
The Chinese scientists are now on a two-week
tour of the other high-energy physics experi
ment sites in this country, and several members
of the delegation will return to Stanford to study
at SLAC before returning to China in December,
according to Dupen.
The Chinese high-energy machine, called the
Beijing Electron-Positron Collider, should be
completed within five years.
