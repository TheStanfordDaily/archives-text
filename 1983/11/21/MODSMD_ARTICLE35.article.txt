In the Ink Bowl, the annual foot
ball classic between The Stanford
Daily and The Daily Californian, the
mighty Daily squad demolished a
hapless and undermanned Weenie
team 13-2, thus proving that jour
nalistic superiority and athletic
prowess do go hand-in-hand.
On offense, the Weenies opted to
use a football about the size of a
baby mouse. Vou know, the kind of
football one would throw around at
about age three. It didn't matter
though as the Weenie offense did
nothing but whine, while the Stan
ford offense rolled up big yards on
offense.
During the past several years, the
side whose team won the Ink Bowl
also won Big Game. Although a long
streak was broken this year, at least
the infamous Ink Bowl exacto knife
(equivalent to the Big Game axe) will
return to its rightful home on the
Stanford campus.
