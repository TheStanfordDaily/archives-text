# Silicon Valley off-limits
## Government bars Soviets 
### DAVID AZRIN 
The University and Silicon Valley
are officially off-limits to Soviet
diplomats, journalists and other gov
ernment representatives under
new restrictions announced by the
State Department Saturday.
The new guidelines, which desig
nate Santa Clara County and most of
San Mateo County as officially
"closed," will prevent Soviet offi
cials from visiting campus, said State
Department spokesperson Sondra
McCarty.
In the past, Soviet officials have
generally been denied permission
to travel in Silicon Valley on a case
by-case basis, although they have
been allowed to visit the University
about once a year, University admi
nistrators said.
Soviet scholars will still be able to
visit campus after submitting an
itinerary and receiving prior ap
proval from the State Department,
McCarty said.
University President Donald Ken
nedy criticized the new guidelines,
saying that government officials may
be restricting the useful flow of in

formation in an effort to stop tech
nology transfer.
"I think all of these restrictions <4
movement are unlikely to be very ef
fective and are often quite silly,"
Kennedy said. " I don't think that
they achieve their real purpose and
they probably restrict some useful
movement."
He continued, "The estimations
of damage aren't very realistic. I fear
that it's part of this new hysteria
about technology transfer."
McCarty said the restrictions on
Soviet officials, which have been in
force in various forms for more than
30 years, are imposed solely be
cause the Soviet Union imposes
similar restrictions on American per
sonnel in the U.S.S.R.
"Because they set restrictions on
our people, we felt we had to do the
same to theirs," she said.
An official at the Soviet consulate
in San Francisco last night said no
one was available for comment.
McCarty said that the new map of
areas closed to Soviet officials was
drawn up after a "comprehensive
review of national security
concerns." The "closed"
areas now include most of the
nation s centers of defense in
dustry, including Eastern Long
Island, 1 N.Y , Seattle and
Tacoma, W.ish., and large
parts of Souihern California
and Texas.
The net impact of the newly
revised map is to open more
areas of the country to Soviet
officials, McCarty said. The
map was revised in response

to a 1978 revision of Soviet
travel restrictions that slightly
eased the limits there.
Like Kennedy, Lee Zeigler,
director of the Bechtel Inter
national Center, criticized the
new restrictions, noting that
about once a year Soviet go
vernment officials visit the
University to speak or partici
pate in panel discussions.
"I think that its quite unfor
tunate because I do not feel
that this kind of restriction
helps us in communicating
with each other and reducing
the tension," he said.
U.S. Attorney Joseph Rus
soniello said that the threat of

technology transfer is real and
that the new rules are needed
because it is very difficult for
law enforcers to identify So
viet spies.
"This (the new regulations)
makes it clear because it is
blanket," Russoniello said. "It
makes it easier for us in law
enforcement to identify those
people who are really Soviet
agents bent on espionage ac
tivities.
"The Reagan administration
has pretty much recognized
that the Soviets will take ad
vantage of whatever political
climate there is," he said.
"Their quest for this technolo

gy has been on-going and
vigorous."
But Russoniello denied that
these rules would restrict the
flow of information.
"We have always made a
distinction between the theo
retical sciences and the tech
nical," he said "It has never
been a policy to stifle debate
or the theoretical exchange of
information.
"I don't think that therp is
going to be a problem for
people engaged in the theo
retical sciences in getting ex
emptions. Each case will be
examined on its merit."
