## Government bars Soviets

The University and Silicon Valley
are officially off-limits to Soviet
diplomats, journalists and other gov

new restrictions announced by the
State Department Saturday.
The new guidelines, which desig

San Mateo County as officially

He continued, "The estimations
of damage aren't very realistic. I fear
that it's part of this new hysteria
