# Kimball responds to senators on library
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Board of Trustees President
William Kimball has assured seven
U.S. senators that "there is much
enthusiasm for placing the Reagan
presidential archives" on campus,
but has informed them that the cur
rent proposal for a Hoover
Institution-run center for public af
fairs raises "serious questions."
The University "would be very in
terested in considering" a Reagan
center for public affairs "within
Stanford's normal academic
structure," Kimball said in a letter to
the senators.
"But because the matter of inter
nal governance of components of
the University is of such fundamen
tal importance to us, a center raises

serious questions," the letter said.
The letter, dated Nov. 9, was sent
to seven senators who had earlier
written to University President
Donald Kennedy expressing their
support for plans to house a Reagan
presidential library complex here.
Signers included Sens. Mark Hat
field (R-Ore.), Max Baucus (D-
Mont.), Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.),
Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), Chic Hecht
(R-Nev.), Alan Cranston (D-Calif.),
and Charles Percy (R-lll.). All but
Wilson and Percy are either Stanford
alumni or parents of Stanford stu
dents.
Cranston has since disavowed his
support for the complex, saying that
"the letter was not represented to
me as an endorsement of a
politically-oriented policy cen

ter/think tank. I particularity want to
stress that I do not endorse such a
center."
Cranston's press secretary had
previously said that the senator had
signed the letter as a favor to Hat
field, before understanding the con
troversial nature of the proposal.
Kimball sent his letter prior to
receipt of a letter from Presidential
Counsellor Edwin Meese, who en
dorsed the package proposal made
by the Hoover Institution and said
the University's ruling out of a
Hoover-run public affairs center was
tantamount to making the president
"an offer he cannot accept."
Kimball and Kennedy have yet to
comment at length on the Meese
letter, but Kennedy has said it


William Kimball
"certainly reduces" the chances
that a Reagan library complex will
ever end up at Stanford.
Kennedy told The Daily last week
that he plans to respond to Meese in
a letter, which he said will probably
be mailed this week.
Kennedy said the letter will likely
not be made public because he
believes negotiations should not be
conducted in the newspapers. He
had earlier expressed his outrage
when the Meese letter was leaked to
The Daily before Kimball, who was
the addressee, had received it.
The letter from Kimball to the
senators was not made public until
Friday — more than a week after it
was mailed. The University first
checked with the senators to make
sure they had received the letter, a
Stanford news release said.
