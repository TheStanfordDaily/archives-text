# ABC's 'The Day After'
## Film brings nuclear war home 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Hundreds of students huddled around television sets
across campus last night to watch Kansas City, Kan.,suf
fer the effects of a nuclear attack.
And although ABC stressed that the effects of the nu
clear war portrayed in "The Day After" were "less se
vere" than those of a real nuclear attack, students who
watched the film said it brought the concept of nuclear
war to a very visual reality.
"It's a graphic presentation of something we all
knew," said senior Steve Victrino, who watched "The
Day After" with two friends. "It's shocking, but it's
something we already knew. I think it's made people
more aware of what can happen and what people don't

want to happen. It's a reality that's there, but we can't
just assume it's going to happen."
The film has spurred a great deal of conversation and
controversy. During the past few weeks, pro-nuclear
forces have condemned the film as only propoganda
from supporters of a nuclear freeze, and many other
groups have urged that parents not allow children to
watch the film alone — or at all.
But sophomore Carolyn Weisz said she thought "The
Day After" was "a good thing for people to see. I
thought it wasn't as gross, as visually gross, as I ex
pected, but it was scary. Stanford students are busy
with a lot of things and the show let you see what you
overlook."
In Lawrence, Kan., one of the
cities destroyed in ABC's Armaged
don, 1000 University of Kansas stu
dents gathered for a candlelight vigil
15 minutes after "The Day After"
ended.

Here students mostly talked.
"A lot of people want to discuss
it," said Chris White, who watched
the film with others at Columbae
House. "For a long time there was
quiet and then we talked about how
it would happen and what effect the
film would have if it were shown in
the Soviet Union, that it wouldn't be
shown in the Soviet Union and how
the Soviets are very aware of this
sort of destruction because of the

damage in World War II."
White said he could tell that the
film did have an effect on people by
the "magnitude of the silence"
which filled the room as "The Day
After" ended. "I feel deadened and
very drained," he said. "I think it
will make some people think about
(nuclear war) for a little while."
On "Viewpoint," an interview
program broadcast after the film,

Secretary of State George Shultz
downplayed the possibility of ABC's
fiction becoming America's reality.
"That's not the future at all,"
Shultz said. "Nuclear war is simply
unacceptable. The only reason we
have nuclear weapons ... is to see
to it that they are not used."
However, scientist Carl Sagan
praised ABC for airing the program,
but warned that "the reality is much
worse" than the movie.
