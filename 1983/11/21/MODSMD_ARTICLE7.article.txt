Israeli jet shot down
Beirut, Lebanon — Waves of Israeli warplanes
bombed guerrilla bases within Syrian-controlled
parts of Lebanon yesterday. At least one Israeli jet
was shot down d iring the air raid.
The planes stru k the towns of Falougha and Sofar
behind Syrian military lines about 10 miles southeast
of Beirut. They also hit the town of Bhamdun, con
sidered a stronghold of Druze fighters who are one
of the main armed Lebanese opposition groups.
A spokesman for the Druze progressive Socialist
Party said last night two civilians had been killed and
eight wounded in Sofar during the attack. But there
was no independent confirmation of the casualties

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

nor any reliable report on the extent of the raid's
damage.
An Israeli Kfir fighter bomber crashed south of the
capital near the airport after its pilot bailed out. He
was taken into custody by Lebanese Army soldiers
and was given a medical evaluation. After he was found
to be healthy, he was flown home in an Israeli
helicopter, the Israeli military command an
nounced.
Syria said its "air defenses" had prevented the Is
raelis from carrying out the bombing mission and
had shot down two Israeli jets, the Kfir and a second
plane northeast of the capital. But there was no con
firmation that the second aircraft had been downed.
It was also not certain who was responsible for
downing the Kfir, since local Moslem and Druze
militias also fired at the planes.
A military spokesman in Tel Aviv said only that one
plane had been downed. It was the first Israeli
aircraft to be shot down since a U.S.-manufactured
Phantom jet was hit by a Soviet SA-6 anti-aircraft
missile over the eastern Bekaa Valley )uly 24, 1982,
and only the third since Israel invaded Lebanon in
June of that year.
The Tel Aviv spokesman called yesterday's attack,
which began shortly after 4 a.m. and lasted about 30
minutes, "a reaction to a long chain of terrorist at
tacks and attempted attacks against Israeli soldiers"
in southern Lebanon. He singled out as an example
the roadside bombing Thursday that killed one sol
dier and wounded six others near the southern port
city of Sidon.
Parliament to debate missiles
Bonn, West Germany — Soviet President Yuri
Andropov sent a letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a
spokesman for Kohl said yesterday, the eve of
debate on the deployment of NATO nuclear missiles
in West Germany.
Meanwhile, police reinforced security in the go
vernment district to discourage violence by anti
missile activists, and said they will ring the Parlia
ment building today during the debate on an issue
that has divided the country.
Chancellery spokesman Alexander Allardt
declined to reveal what the letter from Andropov
said. But the conservative Hamburg newspaper Bild
am Sonntag said the Soviet president warned that
the West German government must be prepared to
"take the consequences" if it goes through with the
missile deployment.
The first battery of nine Pershing II missiles could
be placed in West Germany as early as Wednesday.
The letter was delivered to the chancellery Friday
evening by Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Semyonov,
Allardt said.
Kohl wrote to Andropov Oct. 29 to ask that the
Soviets make a new proposal at the Geneva arms
talks on medium-range missiles.
Kohl will be the first speaker in the Parliament
debate today. He is a staunch supporter of the
deployment and his governing coalition has a 58-
seat majority in Parliament, so the missile plan is ex
pected to win approval. The chancellor says the par
liament's 1981 approval was sufficient and this new
vote — expected tomorrow — is not necessary.
At a Social Democrat conference Saturday the op
position party voted to reject the missiles, over the
protests of former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who
said the new deployment was the best way to con
vince the Soviets to stop what he called "one-sided,
unprovoked armament."
Schmidt, whose party headed a coalition govern
ment from 1974 until late 1982, was one of the ar
chitects of the 1979 NATO plan to counter Soviet
medium-range missiles.
NATO plans to station 572 nuclear-tipped missiles
in Europe, including 204 in West Germany, and says
they will go into place unless Soviet and U.S.
negotiators reach an arms limitation agreement.
'Day After' viewed nationwide
After intense political debate, massive media hype
and broad fears about psychological repercussions,

millions of viewers yesterday finally saw television's
version of nuclear armageddon, a movie called "The
Day After."
Even before it aired, the ABC production assumed
dimensions of a rare national phenomenon — part
show biz, part political catalyst, part nationwide
group-therapy session. It may prove to be the most
telling measure yet of the medium's power.
The program itself was the ultimate TV disaster
movie, a two and a half hour video nightmare
depicting the nuclear destruction of Kansas City,
Kan., and the hellish aftermath experienced in the
nearby town of Lawrence, Kan. But the movie was
just the center of a fury of hype and expectation that
swept the nation in recent days.
"The Day After" initiated intense scrutiny and
debate among psychiatrists and educators, who
wondered which viewers should watch the program
and how. The National Education Association issued
its first-ever TV advisory to parents.
Generally, the consensus advice was that issued
by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which rec
ommended that no one watch alone.
At Oakwood School in Poughkeepsie, N.V., four
students watched the program in the apartment of
their faculty adviser.
"When the bomb went off, some of the students
leaned away from the screen," said high school
sophomore Seth Cooper, one of the viewers.
"Others curled into a fetal position. There was dis
belief."
An utter and eerie silence fell across the crowd of
more than 1000 watching the movie at Riverside
Church in New York City when the bomb hit Kansas
City. No one in the church's underground
auditorium spoke. There were sobs. On the steps
outside the church, Victor Becker, 65, buried his
head in his hands and spoke softly.
"I dreamt of that sort of thing happening. It makes
me sick," he said.
Gunmen open fire in church
Darkley, Northern Ireland — Two gunmen burst
into a Protestant church during a worship service
last night and opened fire on the congregation with
automatic weapons, killing three people and
wounding at least seven, police reported.
Sgt. Cyril Davidson, a police spokesman in Belfast,
said the killers fled in a car driven by an accomplice
and police on both sides of the Irish border
launched a search for them.
Davidson said the gunmen attacked during a
prayer meeting at the Mountain Lodge Pentecostal
Churck in Darkley, a town in County Armagh three
miles north of the border with the Irish Republic.
"On the face of it, it looks like a deliberate and
naked sectarian attack," said a senior police officer
who asked not to be identified.
No group claimed responsibility for the assault,
but police said it appeared to be the work of guerril
las of the outlawed Irish Republican Army or its
Marxist offshot, the Irish National Liberation Army.
Press Association, the British domestic news
agency, said local residents believed the attack was
in retaliation for the killing of a Roman Catholic,
Adrian Carroll of nearby Armagh, two weeks ago.
An extremist Protestant group calling itself the
Protestant Action Force said its members killed Car
roll.
Yesterday's deaths brought to 2330 the number of
people known to have been killed in Northern
Ireland's sectarian violence that erupted in 1969.
The predominantly Catholic IRA and INLA are

fighting to unite the British province and its Protes
tant majority with the Irish Republic, which is over
whelmingly Catholic.
Americans opposed to retaliation
Washington — Most Americans do not support the
idea of military retaliation against the Moslem ex
tremists suspected of the Oct. 23 bombing of U.S.
Marine barracks in Beirut, a Los Angeles Times Poll
has found.
A wide-ranging survey on foreign policy issues
conducted last week found the public both hawkish
and hesitant — applauding President Reagan's
forceful anti-Soviet policies and his invasion of
Grenada but worried about waning prospects of
peace, opposed to military intervention in the
Middle East or Central America, and increasingly in
favor of a nuclear-weapons freeze.
According to the poll, 48 percent say they do not
believe the United States should launch a military
strike to punish whoever was responsible for the
Beirut bombing, which killed 239 Marines. A total of
42 percent say that they support the idea of a
retaliatory attack, and 10 percent say they are not
sure.
A majority of Americans also oppose the idea of
joint U.S.-Israeli military action to push Syrian
troops out of Lebanon, the poll found. A total of 54
percent say they would disapprove such an action,
while 32 percent say they approve and 13 percent are
not sure.
On Central America, 58 percent oppose landing
U.S. troops in Nicaragua to fight that nation's leftist
regime, and 53 percent oppose sending men to El
Salvador to help the U.S.-backed government fight
leftist guerrillas.
The results appear to reflect widespread desire for
a tough global foreign policy, but without involving
American troops in regional conflicts — a case of
generalities vs. specifics.
Cubans demand equipment return
St. George's, Grenada — The lone Cuban diplomat
on Grenada says he's staying put until Cuba gets
back $2 million in equipment used to construct the
airport the Reagan administration contends was be
coming a Cuban and Soviet military base.
"It is only right," says Gaston Diaz, who remains
in the Cuban Embassy in St. George's with an aide,
Pablo Mora. "I will not leave until I get a positive
response."
"It's paradoxical and ironic that the country that
accused us of building the airport for military
purposes has now turned it into a military base,"
Diaz said during an interview at the embassy.
He said Cuba spent more than $35 million on con
struction and equipment for Point Salines airport,
about a dozen miles south of St. George's, the capi
tal.
The charge d'affaires wants the United States and
Grenada to return vehicles, heavy equipment and
machinery the Cubans were using to build it.
Diaz also insists on the return of a Cubana Airlines
plane parked at Pearls Airport, Grenada's only com
mercial airstrip.
The diplomat and his aide say they are the only
Cubans left of 784 who were on Grenada when the
United States and Caribbean forces invaded the is
land Oct. 25. U.S. Army Gen. John Farris has said he
believes 12 to 30 Cubans are hiding out in the hills or
on Grenada's tiny out-islands.

The Cubans on Grenada when the invasion oc
curred were construction workers at the airport
project and soldiers who Diaz said advised Prime
Minister Maurice Bishop or were "engineering and
technical experts."
Bishop, a Marxist and staunch supporter of Cuban
President Fidel Castro, was killed Oct. 19 after a mili
tary junta seized power in a power struggle in his
ruling socialist party. The invasion toppled the junta,
and the occupying forces ordered Cubans sent
home.
After the invasion, Grenada's governor general, Sir
Paul Scoon, asked Cuba to reduce its diplomatic force
to one person.
Diaz, 35, took charge of the embassy after the
evacuation of Ambassador Julian Rizo and helped over
see the return of the bodies of Cubans killed during
the invasion.
Diaz denied U.S. contentions that the Port Salines
airport was going to be used by Soviet and Cuban
warplanes. Like Bishop, he insisted that the facility,
with its 9000-foot-long runway, would allow jumbo jets
to land on Grenada and bring much-needed tourism to
the 133-square-mile island, which bases its economy
on nutmeg, cocoa and bananas.
The airport "would have been finished on time, in
March of next year," Diaz said.
Two missing after explosion
Pleasant Hill, lowa — Two teen-agers last seen
hunting near the site of an enormous dynamite ex
plosion remained missing yesterday and authorities
think they may have fired shots that set off the blast
felt up to 45 miles away.
The 12'/2 tons of dynamite that exploded Saturday
was five times the amount used to level the U.S.
Marines installation in Beirut, Lebanon, last month,
officials said.
Officials were only theorizing that the blast may
have been set off by gunshots and still were not sure
what caused the explosion, said Polk County
Sheriff's Deputy Harold Strasbourg.
A gunshot wound normally would not cause such
a blast, said Reynold Hentges, assistant lowa fire
marshal.
The boys were identified yesterday as Clint
Woodard, 14, and Jeffrey Wadell, 13, both of Des
Moines.
If anyone was near the explosion, in an industrial
part of this suburb on the east side of Des Moines,
"the chances of survival are slim," said Deputy Mark
Breneman.
No injuries were reported, but the explosion, at
about 4:30 p.m., was felt for miles around and left a
crater 30 feet deep and 100 feet across.
"The bunker is no more. It's just a hole in the
ground," Des Moines police Sgt. Richard Jones said.
People at the scene said "it looks like a war zone. All
the trees in the area have been leveled."
Workers began clearing a road yesterday to an
other bunker on the 66-acre site containing 17 tons
of dynamite so the explosives and blasting caps
could be removed.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy with a chance of showers. Highs in
the upper 40s to low 50s. Decreasing northwest
winds. Tonight and tomorrow — partly cloudy and
cooler. Lows in the 30s and low 40s. Highs in the up
per 40s to mid 50s.
