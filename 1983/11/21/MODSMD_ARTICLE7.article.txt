Israeli jet shot down
Beirut, Lebanon â€” Waves of Israeli warplanes
bombed guerrilla bases within Syrian-controlled
parts of Lebanon yesterday. At least one Israeli jet
was shot down d iring the air raid.
The planes stru k the towns of Falougha and Sofar
behind Syrian military lines about 10 miles southeast
of Beirut. They also hit the town of Bhamdun, con
sidered a stronghold of Druze fighters who are one
of the main armed Lebanese opposition groups.
A spokesman for the Druze progressive Socialist
Party said last night two civilians had been killed and
eight wounded in Sofar during the attack. But there
was no independent confirmation of the casualties

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

nor any reliable report on the extent of the raid's
damage.
An Israeli Kfir fighter bomber crashed south of the
capital near the airport after its pilot bailed out. He
was taken into custody by Lebanese Army soldiers
and was given a medical evaluation. After he was found
to be healthy, he was flown home in an Israeli
helicopter, the Israeli military command an
nounced.
Syria said its "air defenses" had prevented the Is
raelis from carrying out the bombing mission and
had shot down two Israeli jets, the Kfir and a second
plane northeast of the capital. But there was no con
firmation that the second aircraft had been downed.
It was also not certain who was responsible for
downing the Kfir, since local Moslem and Druze
militias also fired at the planes.
