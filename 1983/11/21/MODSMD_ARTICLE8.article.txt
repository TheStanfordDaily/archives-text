President Reagan's decision to
refine the latest U.S. arms control pro
posal is viewed by Washington offi
cials as the final effort to clinch
agreement with the Soviet Union
before NATO executes its 1979 deci
sion to deploy Pershing II and cruise
missiles in Europe next month.
But the new administration offer
— which marks the first time Wash
ington has attached a definite num
ber of missiles and warheads to its
bargaining position — was immedi
ately deemed "patently unaccepta
ble" by Tass, the Soviet news
agency.
"President Reagan has not relin
quished his lunatic plans to make
the Russians fear that the United
States will resort to the use of nu
clear weapons, naively counting in
the process on its own impunity,"
Tass said. "It goes without saying
that the Soviet Union cannot and
will not accept any agreement based
on the American double-standard."
The Reagan plan equates a U.S.
total of 420 single-warhead medium
range missiles with 140 of the Soviet
three-warhead SS-20s, the number
to which Moscow has proposed to
limit its SS-20 arsenal within range of
Europe.
The Soviet offer would reduce to
140 the SS-20s west of the Ural
mountains from the present 243,
and is contingent on the 162 British
and French weapons being included
in the equation — a move rejected
in Washington, London and Paris.
Most diplomats suspect that the
Soviets will remain in the Geneva
talks until actual deployment of the
108 Pershing II and 464 cruise
missiles begins or at least until the
West German Parliament holds its
debate on the so-called
Euromissiles, The New York Times
said Tuesday. That debate is sched
uled to start today.

American-made cruise missiles
arrived at the Greenham Common air
base in England via U.S. Air Force
transport planes in separate ship
ments Monday and Wednesday,
sparking controversy from the
streets of London to the halls of Par
liament.
The missiles came two weeks after
the House of Commons voted over
whelmingly after a heated debate to

go ahead with the deployment. But
the appearance of the new weapons
did little to silence discontent within
Parliament, and Prime Minister Mar
garet Thatcher repeatedly clashed
with Labor Party officials in what The
New York Times described as "a
furious exchange."
Neil Kinnock, the new Labor Party
leader, pressed Thatcher for details
of the conditions in which she
would support a U.S. decision to
launch British-based nuclear
missiles, "assuming President
Reagan bothered to ask you."
"It would obviously be of the
greatest possible use to the Soviet
Union to know the precise circum
stances or details of such an ar
rangement," the prime minister
countered. "One does not normally
help a potential aggressor in that
way."
"Don't you know the difference,"
Kinnock demanded, "between the
status of a partner in NATO and a
lackey to the Americans?"

"You," Thatcher shot back, "are
talking absolute rubbish."
Three hundred protesters were
arrested outside Parliament on
Monday as they scrambled to make
their point in a different way: by
spraying red paint on the head of
Defense Minister Michael Heseltine
as he attempted to enter the build
ing.
"Better red than dead, Michael,"
the demonstrators chanted, trap
ping the defense minister in a wash
room as he cleaned up and
borrowed a policeman's shirt, The
New York Times said.
Heseltine and his bodyguards
forced their way from the washroom
to an anteroom, where they were
held at bay for nearly an hour before
police opened a wedge through the
crowds of jeering students. In front
of a mob of 800 inside the hall
roaring, "Jobs not bombs," he tried
to give a speech but abandoned the
effort after demonstrators pelted
him with eggs.

Outside the gates of the Green
ham Common air base, 141 women
were arrested Monday and at least
126 on Wednesday as they streamed
into a camp where demonstrators
have maintained an anti-Euromissile
vigil for the past 26 months. The wo
men screamed as the cargo contain
ing the cruise missiles was unloaded
from transport planes, then tied
themselves to the gates of the base
and waited for police, The New York
Times said.
In Moscow, reaction to the arrival
of the cruise missiles was com
paratively quiet and was reported
briefly and without official comment
by the Soviet press.
Washington officials have
repeatedly asserted that the Soviets
are more concerned about the
Pershing 11, with its greater accuracy
and speed, than about the slower
cruise missile.

The national reconciliation talks be
tween Lebanon's factional leaders re

cessed two weeks ago, but disputes
seem to be mounting over some of
the political issues that were
supposed to have been resolved in
the Ceneva conference.
The deterioration of security
within Beirut was typified by an ar
tillery bombardment Tuesday, the
most intense shelling since the
cease-fire took effect in the city al
most two months ago.
Israeli warplanes carried out their
second raid in less than two weeks
Wednesday behind Syrian lines in
eastern Lebanon, striking bases of
two Shia Moslem militia groups that
have been linked to the explosions
at U.S., French and Israeli installa
tions in Lebanon. At least 43 people
were killed.
The Israeli military command said
the Bekaa Valley bases served as a
point from which "terrorists belong
ing to Iranian-affiliated organiza
tions set out on offensive missions."
While U.S. authorities have hinted
at the possibility of retaliating

against the groups believed to be re
sponsible for the suicide bombings
at the Marine compound Oct. 23, Is
raeli and U.S. sources said Washing,
ton and Jerusalem did not coor
dinate the air strike.
French jets bombarded targets in
the Bekaa Valley on the following
day, leaving at least 39 dead and 150
wounded. Washington officials said
they knew in advance of the French
strike, and a senior administration
official admitted that if the terrorists
were not neutralized by the attack
there "might well be" a need for the
United States to take military action.
Syrian Defense Minister Gen.
Mustafa Tlass said Saturday that
Syria will respond to any U.S. assault
"with kamikaze attacks on American
warships" off Beirut.
Tlass told the pro-Syrian magazine
Al-Kifah Al-Arabi that Syria also has
surface-to-surface missiles capable
of striking Israel's Negev nuclear re
actor. Early last month Syria ob
tained Soviet SS-21s, which have a
range of 85 miles and can he
equipped with nuclear warheads.
• ••
Syrian-backed Palestinian rebels
overran the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization's (PLO) last stronghold at
the Beddawi refugee camp Wednes
day, sending PLO leader Yasser
Arafat and his followers fleeing into
the streets of Tripoli, Lebanon's
second largest city.
Arafat continued his demands for
an agreement guaranteeing the safe
exit of the PLO from the city. But as
various negotiations continued,
sources in Jerusalem said yesterday
that passage may be granted if Arafat
agrees to release six Israeli soldiers
held prisoner by the PLO since last
year.
The sources said further that
France would be responsible for
transporting Arafat on one of the
French warships stationed off the
coast, and that Israel is encouraging
this proposal. Government officials
in Israel have denied such a plan in
at least one report. It is unclear whe
ther Arafat is personally involved in
any negotiations concerning a
departure from Tripoli.

President Reagan's decision to
refine the latest U.S. arms control pro
posal is viewed by Washington offi
cials as the final effort to clinch
agreement with the Soviet Union
before NATO executes its 1979 deci
sion to deploy Pershing II and cruise
missiles in Europe next month.
But the new administration offer
— which marks the first time Wash
ington has attached a definite num
ber of missiles and warheads to its
bargaining position — was immedi
ately deemed "patently unaccepta
ble" by Tass, the Soviet news
agency.
"President Reagan has not relin
quished his lunatic plans to make
the Russians fear that the United
States will resort to the use of nu
clear weapons, naively counting in
the process on its own impunity,"
Tass said. "It goes without saying
that the Soviet Union cannot and
will not accept any agreement based
on the American double-standard."
The Reagan plan equates a U.S.
total of 420 single-warhead medium
range missiles with 140 of the Soviet
three-warhead SS-20s, the number
to which Moscow has proposed to
limit its SS-20 arsenal within range of
Europe.
The Soviet offer would reduce to
140 the SS-20s west of the Ural
mountains from the present 243,
and is contingent on the 162 British
and French weapons being included
in the equation — a move rejected
in Washington, London and Paris.
Most diplomats suspect that the
Soviets will remain in the Geneva
talks until actual deployment of the
108 Pershing II and 464 cruise
missiles begins or at least until the
West German Parliament holds its
debate on the so-called
Euromissiles, The New York Times
said Tuesday. That debate is sched

American-made cruise missiles
arrived at the Greenham Common air

sparking controversy from the

The missiles came two weeks after
the House of Commons voted over
whelmingly after a heated debate to

go ahead with the deployment. But
the appearance of the new weapons
did little to silence discontent within
Parliament, and Prime Minister Mar

with Labor Party officials in what The
New York Times described as "a

Neil Kinnock, the new Labor Party
leader, pressed Thatcher for details
of the conditions in which she
would support a U.S. decision to
launch British-based nuclear
missiles, "assuming President
Reagan bothered to ask you."
"It would obviously be of the
greatest possible use to the Soviet
Union to know the precise circum
stances or details of such an ar

countered. "One does not normally

way."
"Don't you know the difference,"
Kinnock demanded, "between the
status of a partner in NATO and a
lackey to the Americans?"

"You," Thatcher shot back, "are

Three hundred protesters were
arrested outside Parliament on
Monday as they scrambled to make
their point in a different way: by
spraying red paint on the head of
Defense Minister Michael Heseltine
as he attempted to enter the build
ing.
"Better red than dead, Michael,"
the demonstrators chanted, trap
ping the defense minister in a wash
room as he cleaned up and
borrowed a policeman's shirt, The
New York Times said.
Heseltine and his bodyguards
forced their way from the washroom
to an anteroom, where they were
held at bay for nearly an hour before
police opened a wedge through the
crowds of jeering students. In front
of a mob of 800 inside the hall
roaring, "Jobs not bombs," he tried
to give a speech but abandoned the
effort after demonstrators pelted
him with eggs.

Outside the gates of the Green
ham Common air base, 141 women
were arrested Monday and at least
126 on Wednesday as they streamed
into a camp where demonstrators
have maintained an anti-Euromissile
vigil for the past 26 months. The wo

The national reconciliation talks be

seem to be mounting over some of
the political issues that were
supposed to have been resolved in
the Ceneva conference.
The deterioration of security
within Beirut was typified by an ar
tillery bombardment Tuesday, the
most intense shelling since the
cease-fire took effect in the city al
most two months ago.
Israeli warplanes carried out their
second raid in less than two weeks
Wednesday behind Syrian lines in
eastern Lebanon, striking bases of
two Shia Moslem militia groups that
have been linked to the explosions
at U.S., French and Israeli installa

were killed.
The Israeli military command said
the Bekaa Valley bases served as a
point from which "terrorists belong
ing to Iranian-affiliated organiza
tions set out on offensive missions."
While U.S. authorities have hinted
at the possibility of retaliating

against the groups believed to be re
sponsible for the suicide bombings
at the Marine compound Oct. 23, Is
raeli and U.S. sources said Washing,
ton and Jerusalem did not coor
dinate the air strike.
French jets bombarded targets in
the Bekaa Valley on the following
day, leaving at least 39 dead and 150
wounded. Washington officials said
they knew in advance of the French
strike, and a senior administration
official admitted that if the terrorists
were not neutralized by the attack
there "might well be" a need for the
United States to take military action.
Syrian Defense Minister Gen.
Mustafa Tlass said Saturday that
Syria will respond to any U.S. assault
"with kamikaze attacks on American
warships" off Beirut.
Tlass told the pro-Syrian magazine
Al-Kifah Al-Arabi that Syria also has
surface-to-surface missiles capable
of striking Israel's Negev nuclear re
actor. Early last month Syria ob
tained Soviet SS-21s, which have a

the Bekaa Valley bases served as a
point from which "terrorists belong
ing to Iranian-affiliated organiza
tions set out on offensive missions."
While U.S. authorities have hinted
at the possibility of retaliating

against the groups believed to be re
sponsible for the suicide bombings
at the Marine compound Oct. 23, Is
raeli and U.S. sources said Washing,
ton and Jerusalem did not coor
dinate the air strike.
French jets bombarded targets in
the Bekaa Valley on the following
day, leaving at least 39 dead and 150
wounded. Washington officials said
they knew in advance of the French
strike, and a senior administration
official admitted that if the terrorists
were not neutralized by the attack
there "might well be" a need for the
United States to take military action.
Syrian Defense Minister Gen.
Mustafa Tlass said Saturday that
Syria will respond to any U.S. assault
"with kamikaze attacks on American
warships" off Beirut.
Tlass told the pro-Syrian magazine
Al-Kifah Al-Arabi that Syria also has
surface-to-surface missiles capable
of striking Israel's Negev nuclear re
actor. Early last month Syria ob
tained Soviet SS-21s, which have a
range of 85 miles and can he
equipped with nuclear warheads.

Syrian-backed Palestinian rebels
overran the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization's (PLO) last stronghold at
the Beddawi refugee camp Wednes
day, sending PLO leader Yasser
Arafat and his followers fleeing into
the streets of Tripoli, Lebanon's
second largest city.
Arafat continued his demands for
an agreement guaranteeing the safe
exit of the PLO from the city. But as
various negotiations continued,
sources in Jerusalem said yesterday
that passage may be granted if Arafat
agrees to release six Israeli soldiers
held prisoner by the PLO since last
year.
The sources said further that
France would be responsible for
transporting Arafat on one of the
French warships stationed off the
coast, and that Israel is encouraging
this proposal. Government officials
in Israel have denied such a plan in
at least one report. It is unclear whe
ther Arafat is personally involved in
any negotiations concerning a
departure from Tripoli.
