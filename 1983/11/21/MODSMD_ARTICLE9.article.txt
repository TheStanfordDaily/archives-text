## On avoiding Big Game 
### JEFF BIDDULPH 
If you don't go to the Big Came you're
either stupid or crazy or both. — A Stanford
student

They were the few, they were the phleg
matic, they were the unfortunate, they were
the purposeful, they were the sensitive, they
were the strange.
They were those who did not go to the Big
Game.
They were found in lost corners of libra
ries, and they dotted deserted tailgaters.
Some were found wandering aimlessly
across campus, undisturbed by the thought
that they were missing a major spectacle: 22
big men chasing a pigskin around a field.
Others were purposefully boycotting, citing
practiced arguments for their absence.
Others just had to work.
"I don't understand the interest in it,"
said Fritz Brun, a graduate student in drama,
who manned the entrance portal at Green
Library. "Personally, I'm into theater."
Brun had a Danish accent.
"I've never seen a football game in my
life. I play soccer — I don't understand the
American form. It seems to me like sheer
violence," Brun said.
One woman leaned against a book shelf in
the bowels of Green, reading a book,
seemingly the only person in the lower
levels of the library. As this reporter walked
towards her, she scurried away, apparently
assuming that the reporter was stupid and
crazy.
There was another person on the lower
levels of Green. Yvonne Williams, a sopho
more majoring in human biology, sat at a
table with a book opened in front of her.
"I don't like football very much," Wil
liams said. "I realize it's a social event too,
but it's not fun for the whole game — it's not
fun for more than a quarter."

Williams said she knew what football was
like — she spent four years in high school
marching with the band.
"That was enough," she said.
"I don't like seeing people who actually
like beating up other people," Williams
said. "I suppose it's better that it's on the
field than having the football players keep
this instinct to harm other people inside
them."
Others were not so happy that they
weren't in the stadium.
Tom McCarthy sat on the side of Meyer Li
brary surrounded by dozens of red and
white balloons. McCarthy works in San Fran
cisco and came to Stanford to go to a Big
Game tailgater with a friend.
"I could have gone to the game but I
decided not to," McCarthy said.
The crowd roared from the far-off
stadium.
"In a way I'm sorry I didn't go to the
game," he said wistfully. Fte still wouldn't
say why he didn't go. *
John Tierny, a cashier at The Store in
Tresidder Union, sported a red "Fuck Cal"
shirt. He would have gone to the game, but
he had spent much of the last few weeks
working on Gaieties, and he was "too
tired."
Madison Omholt, a cashier at the Corner
Pocket, said, "I'd like to see it. I've seen a
few games, but it's not as important to me as
to other people."
Omholt was listening to the game on the
radio as he worked. The announcer's voice
rose to a fevered pitch.
"Oh well, Cal just scored again," Omholt
said.
Omholt leaned forward across the
counter.
"I'll tell you one thing though," Omholt
said. "At least we're dry."
