It's tough to choose the right company
when all you have to go on is a bunch of
literature and a brief conversation with
company representatives.
It's just as tough for companies to choose
employees if all they have to go on is
college transcripts, resumes and interviews.
Weyerhaeuser has the answer.
Juniors in Engineering are invited to an information session to
learn how to qualify for a hands-on, real-world work experience
that offers a mutual opportunity for deciding about Weyerhaeuser
as a career choice before graduation (see time and place below).
Attendance at the session is an essential first step to a
Weyerhaeuser career:
• You must attend to be considered for a summer internship.
• You must have completed an internship to be considered for a
full-time career with Weyerhaeuser
It all starts at the information session, where Weyerhaeuser
representatives will tell you about the company, about the intern
program, and about how to apply for an internship
Session time and place:
Tresidder Memorial Union, Room 270
7:00-9:00 p.m. — Monday, November 28,1983
* 1 Weyerhaeuser
Wouldn't it be nice to have all your
questions answered before graduation?
Come and see how it can happen.
