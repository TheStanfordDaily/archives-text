### TIM GRIEVE 
On the 20th anniversary of his
assassination, should we con
sider John F. Kennedy one of our
greatest presidents?
"That depends on one's esti
mate of what he would have
done," says Political Science
Prof. Hubert Marshall.
Marshall credits Kennedy with
a greater-than-average ability to
learn in office — something that
makes predicting the results of
four more years of Camelot even
more difficult.

"His mind was open to the
possibilities in a creative way,"
Marshall explained. "Unlike Lyn
don Johnson, he didn't get his
feet in concrete and stay there."
Marshall said Kennedy
changed his mind about poverty
after seeing it firsthand when he
campaigned in West Virginia and
that he may have reconsidered
his policies on Cuba and Vietnam
as well.
"I've read that he was rethink
ing our relations with (Cuban
President Fidel) Castro. He felt
the hostility he had expressed
during the Bay of Pigs and the

Cuban Missile Crisis was un
productive and perhaps he
would have worked with Castro
for a peaceful state," Marshall
said.
"On the Vietnam War, Arthur
Schlesinger and others con
cluded that our involvement was
unwise and that after the
presidential elections in 1964
Kennedy would get out. That tells
a lot about the American political
situation," Marshall said. "He
had whipped up public opinion
on communism and if he had
changed his mind he would have
done it after the election."
But, Marshall said, even if Ken
nedy had pulled out of Vietnam,
he may not have received the
credit the move would have
deserved.
"Let's say he would have got
ten out of that war. Those of us
who look back" would know that
he had averted a major loss of
American lives. "But had he got
ten out, nobody would have
known what the future history
would have been.
"And had he started new rela
tions with Castro, it would have
been a non-event," Marshall
said.

wasn't in office long enough to
be considered a great president.
"I sense that there is still a lot of
fascination with him, but also ig
norance about what he did," the
professor said.
"Of course, in the last analysis,
he didn't do very much. If we talk
about his significance in a histori
cal role it has to be in terms of
this general emotional effect, of
image, of agenda-setting rather
than agenda-completing," he
said.
He said he feels Kennedy
"raised the aspirations and ex

pectations of a whole generation
of voung people about what their
society was going to be like, and
what their role in it was going to
be."
But Marshall was less enthusi
astic about Kennedy's actual ac
complishments.
"If you leave style and Jackie
and those little children and the
rest out of it," Marshall said, "I
would give him very low marks. I
can't give him great scores on
civil rights or foreign policy.
"I think on civil rights he did
some good things, but if you look
at the record he was very timid.
He got into office on a very close
vote and didn't think he had a
mandate.
"Until the Martin Luther King

march on Washington, they
wouldn't let him in the White
House. They watched the 'I have
a dream' speech on television
and they didn't issue that invita
tion until just two hours before
Martin Luther King was in the
White House."
On foreign policy, Marshall
contends that Kennedy was dan
gerous.
"Robert Kennedy's estimate
was that there was a 50-50 chance
we would have a nuclear war,"
Marshall said. "When we had
missiles in Turkey they were
closer to Russia than Russia's
missiles in Cuba were to Florida.
We brought the world to the
brink of nuclear war very ir
responsibly."
