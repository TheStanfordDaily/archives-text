## How Stanford responded on Nov. 22, 1963 
### TIM GRIEVE 
At Stanford, Nov. 22, 1963, was a lot like most
other Fridays before Big Game.
Former Stanford quarterback John Brodie was
scheduled to lead the Big Came bonfire and rally at
Lake Lagunita that evening. Four new fraternity
houses and the Storke Publications Building were to
be dedicated during the weekend.
And football Coach John Ralston hoped to lead his
7-2 Indians to their third-straight Big Game victory.
But all that changed Friday morning as The News
From Dallas spread across campus.
The president had been shot.
All Big Game activities were immediately canceled
and the game itself was postponed a week.
And the campus was shocked.
Students, silent in their grief, crowded around
television sets in dormitories and at Tresidder
Union. And when they spoke, their questions had
no answers.
"How?" a woman asked at Tresidder. "It can't be
real."
"How can all this still matter?" another woman
asked as she waited in line to pre-register for winter
classes.

In a special "Extra" edition of The Daily, the
editors called on students to "continue forward and
modify our faith from 'it can't happen here' to 'it
shall not happen again.' "
Friday evening, about 4000 students gathered
around Dinkelspiel and Memorial Auditoriums to
mourn the fallen President.
ASSU President Bud Wedin told the crowd that
with John F. Kennedy's death, "seem also to die
many of of the values and ideas we held with him.
Particularly as students, it is more than the death of a
man or a political leader; it is the death of someone
who represented so much of what we value and held
to be good.
"Vet still do we have the opportunity to move on
ward. John Kennedy will no longer be with us in this
march, but his inspiration and guide will always be
manifest."
