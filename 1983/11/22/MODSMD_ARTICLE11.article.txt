# Former Kennedy officials discuss his nuclear legacy
## 
### TROY EID 
President John F. Kennedy's
"terrific way of dealing with the Rus
sians" via policies that fused a tough
defense posture with respect for So
viet interests "made you feel great
to be an American" — especially if
you served as a member of his ad
ministration, a former Kennedy offi
cial said here last night.
The "marvelous style" with which
Kennedy conducted strategic plan
ning "left the foundations for a
completely reshaped defense pro-

20 years later

gram," according to Business
School Prof. Alain Enthoven, a dep
uty assistant secretary of defense
during the Kennedy administration.
Enthoven joined fellow Business
School Prof. Henry Rowen — also a
deputy assistant secretary of
defense under Kennedy — and Poli
tical Science Prof. Alexander George
in a panel discussion concerning
Kennedy's strategic nuclear policy.
By "building the Berlin wall over
night" in 1961, the Soviets engaged
in "a tactically successful move"
that forced Kennedy to face a
precarious situation: the need to
reassure Western Europe of the
United States' commitment to
NATO without provoking a nuclear
exchange between the super
powers, Rowen said.
This dilemma was exacerbated by
U.S. military intelligence sources
that mistakenly estimated the Soviet
presense in Eastern Europe as super
ior to NATO forces. "The military
was either wrong or inefficient in
(its) estimates," Rowen said.

But even in the wake of the 1962
Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy
scaled-down the number of nuclear
weapons in the U.S. arsenal, Rowen
and Entoven said. The crisis caused
many people to think that nuclear
war "is just too dangerous," Rowen
said.
Enthoven concurred and added
that he did not watch ABC's "The
Day After," a docu-drama depicting
a nuclear strike in Kansas, because
"we lived that in the 1950s as we
worried about the increasing dan
ger" posed by a nuclear buildup be
tween the superpowers.
U.S. nuclear strategic planning
under Kennedy "reflected the criti
cal thinking of the eight years of the
Eisenhower administration,"
George said. The Korean conflict
prompted Eisenhower's policy
makers to develop ways to wage lim
ited conventional warfare while re
taining a nuclear threat.

This "threat" — embodied in
Eisenhower's massive retaliation
doctrine — was "designed for deter
rence purposes" and allowed the
United States to "reserve the right
to choose the groundrules of a
war," George said.
The Kennedy administration used
elements of the massive retaliation

posture, specifically the doctrine of
flexible controlled response. This
intellectual framework was sum
marized by the president in a 1961
speech to Congress, according to
George.
In that speech, Kennedy asserted
that "our weapons systems must be
usable in a manner permitting delib
eration and discrimination as to
timing, scope and targets in
response to civilian authority."
Flexible controlled response fos
tered the development of conven
tional forces and facilitated the con
tinuation of nuclear deterrence. But
it was far from flawless, as George
was careful to point out.
"Flexible controlled response is
not a strategy," George said. "You
need to develop theories of
coercive diplomacy . . . and a theory
of escalation control" before the
paradigm can become effectively

realized, and the framework pro
vides the possibility "that if you go
about . . . acquiring a rich array of
military capabilities, there is a
temptation to intervene" — even
when "American vital interests real
ly are not at stake."
