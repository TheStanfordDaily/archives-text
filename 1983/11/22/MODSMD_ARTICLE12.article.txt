Where were you on Tuesday, Nov. 22, 1963?
Our parents and professors can answer the
question with vivid detail. For most of us,
however, the answer is in the womb, in the
crib, or, for the older graduate students,
watching "Romper Room". Yet 20 years after
his assassination, john F. Kennedy, a president
we did not know and do not fully understand,
stands out as a hero. Today we can look back
and wonder why, but regardless of his politics,
we can recall his words and visions to spur us
into the future.
We have trouble recognizing JFK as a hero of
peace. Too young to feel the tension of the
Cuban Missle Crisis, we rely on our professors
and textbooks, which question the soundness
of bringing the world to the brink of a nuclear
exchange. JFK recognized the horror of war
and negotiated the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, yet
his rhetoric of anti-Communism and American
dominance was similar to that emanating from
the White House today. He increased our com
mitment to Vietnam, but some say he would
have had the sense to prevent our later embar
rassment. We will never know.
We also have trouble recognizing JFK as a
hero of domestic change. He is given credit for
the tremendous progress in civil rights and so
cial programs, but all the significant legislation
was passed under Johnson. It appears that

JFK's concern for minorities and the poor was
based more on political considerations than
personal convictions.
Yet JFK remains a hero, and rightly so. His
speeches and demeanor gave Americans confi
dence to grow and change as they entered the
19605. We have lived through presidencies
which have been ridiculed, laughed at and
lacking in leadership. We see in JFK a president
who could have inspired in students our age a
sense of purpose and a desire to serve others.
Growing up without heroes, we look back to
JFK's presidency and feel cheated that we
missed it.
Perhaps much of his greatness is myth, but
this myth arose out of the youth, idealism and
courage that were JFK. Given his actual politics,
we refrain from calling him an ideal president.
He was a leader, though, and his belief that
Americans could progress, be creative and
work for a better and more caring world often
seems lost today. We look back on JFK not nec
essarily as a great statesman, but as a symbol of
encouragement, vigor and unfulfilled poten
tial. He called his New Frontier not a set of
promises but a set of challenges. The chal
lenges are still there today, and the message of
JFK urging us on is vital, especially to those of
us who were too young to remember him and
his fateful trip to Dallas.
