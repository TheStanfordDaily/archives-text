# Give us real I.D.s

The ASSU has at least one good campaign
underway this year: a plan to design laminated
photo I.D. cards for students.
The current pieces of identification handed
out by the University are, as Registrar Sally
Mahoney admitted, "cheap." Few would refer
to the I.D.s as "cards"; they are pieces of
paper. They don't even have photos.
Mahoney argues that the flimsy things do all
they were intended to do. While her point may
be correct, the reason the current I.D.s should
be replaced by sturdier plastic ones is the
flexibility and options they would provide.
Students could check out books from the li
brary without getting writer's cramp from fil
ling out one card for each book. A scanner that
would record the necessary information about
a student would undoubtedly speed up the
process, making life easier for students and li
brary workers alike.

The library would be the best place to start,
but the system could be expanded so that the
I.D. cards would become almost like credit
cards — a scheme used at several other univer
sities. As ASSU senators backing the proposal
have mentioned, the Bookstore and the Athlet
ic Department might be the next logical places
to institute the system, enabling students to
purchase season football tickets, school
supplies and books more efficiently.
The laminated I.D.s, of course, would also
be used as Food Service cards. And there lies
the most obvious benefit: Students who eat in
dorms would no longer have to worry about
those two pieces of identification. One sturdy
plastic-covered card would do the trick.
The possible drawback to ASSU's plan is —
as with many new ideas — money. But at a uni
versity filled with state-of-the-art technology, it
seems only fair that students should have the
most efficient identification system.
