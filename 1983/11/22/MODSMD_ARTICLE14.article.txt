## SSRL doing nuclear research 
### 
As is well known, Stanford Uni
versity has been involved for almost
a year in negotiation with a consor
tium of institutions, led by the
Lawrence Livermore National Labo
ratory, concerning a proposal to
build a $46 million facility at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lab
oratory (SSRL). The latter is located
at and dependent on, but ad
ministratively separate from, the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).

If work funded by
the Military Appli
cation Division does
not have military
applications, what
are we to believe
about anything?

The need for the long negotiation
has to do with the fact that a num
ber, well, perhaps one should say a
large number of the staff at the last
institution was very unhappy about
being involved in work which was
centrally involved in the develop
ment of nuclear weapons. Some
even felt that the United States had
more nuclear weapons than it
needed. So there was a certain
amount of controversy, petitions
and the like, and the issue was
carried to the Faculty Senate, the
ASSU Senate, the Committee on Re
search and to the office of the Uni
versity president himself.
The outcome of all this was, to cut
a long story short: an expression of
sympathy at what was called the in
voluntary servitude that would
result for some people if the pro
posal was approved and a commit
ment from the University that it
would make best efforts to find al
ternative employment for those who
objected to this kind of work.
Well, to no one's surprise the
University accepted the proposal
late in September. And now we
come to the nub of the issue. Accor
ding to the administration the pro
posal has been changed in such a
way as to make moot most of the ob
jections that have been raised.

(Dean of Graduate Studies and Re
search) Gerald Lieberman said, "Direct
weapons applications are not now
present in the application." And Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
gives the point more emphasis, saying,
'The direct applied work has all been
removed and will be done elsewhere."
The facts are different. The
Livermore proposal has been ac
cepted in its entirety as to content
with a single exception: routine
calibration of X-ray detectors to be
used in nuclear weapons tests will
not be done at Stanford, it will be
done at Livermore. What that means
is that production of detectors will
not be done here, but the much
more important development of
those detectors will be done at Stan
ford. And, it has been stated, these
prototype detectors may be used in
weapons testing, as long as it's not
routine. The change in content
changes one line of a scientific pro
posal which runs to 40 pages.
As for the assertion that direct
weapons applications are not pres
ent in the proposal, that is simply
not true. The proposal is now, as
before, 80 percent funded by the
Military Applications Division of the
Department of Energy, the office
which manages the nuclear weap
ons division. If work funded by the
Military Applications Division does
not have military applications, what
are we to believe about anything?
The proponents from Livermore
have stated clearly in colloquia and
in the press that their work is entire
ly related to the support of the nu
clear weapons program. In their
funding request, which is an official
public document, they state: " . . .
it is anticipated that the research at
SSRL will deal with:
• basic studies of the interactions
of X-rays with matter;
• determination of the atomic ar
rangements of materials containing
actinide elements ... at very high
pressures;
• development of advanced X-ray
optics and detectors.
The first item in the list is, of
course, just a statement that you are
going to be doing science with an X
ray source. The second is more illu
minating, because actinide ele
ments at very high pressure only oc
cur in one possible situation, in the
explosion of a nuclear weapon. The
work has no other application. The
last item refers to the fact that it is of
great interest to be able to make
mirrors and lenses that work for X
rays. Why? The earlier version of the

funding document was more
forthright on that point when it
stated that "this work is strongly
driven by R-project," which is an at
tempt to make a space-based
nuclear-pumped laser weapon. And
of course X-ray detectors of the kind
that they have in mind are the pri
mary diagnostic tool in nuclear
weapons testing.
As stated in this document it ap
pears that the main content of the
work is science which has direct ap
plication to nuclear weapons devel
opment and testing. It's kind of sad,
really.
