# The 						failure of a movement
## 
### 
Someone once said that if the Women's Movement
were headed by a man, it would have achieved much,
much more. Hmm.
It's pretty safe to say that the "Movement" has had
more of its share of problems, and if we look around
and see the realities of life, we can see that the prob
lems stem from too broad a focus. A university is the
best place to see what equality can and should be.
Although Stanford is certainly not the most "activist"
campus in the country, it is one of the most anti-sexist
in terms of the individual intellect and achievement of
its members. By mere interaction, the Stanford student
soon realizes that talent and intelligence know no
gender. The fact that there isn't a strong "Movement"
on campus promotes progress, in that its absence en
hances the emphasis on the individual, which is really
what the Women's Movement should be all about.
The problems which have affected the Women's
Movement in the past few years are the same that
would plague a poorly written novel. The reader knows
that what the writer is trying to express is meaningful,
but the problems of the novel distance the reader and
cause him to either ignore or criticize the writer.
The leaders of the Women's Movement have been
bad writers. On one hand they've been a force for in
volvement. On the other hand they've been a bit ob
noxious, especially to the casual observer (who is the
most common type). The casual observer sees some of
these leaders equating men with rapists, capitalism
with rape — all men against all women in all things.
Bestial domination is inherent, they say, in firearms,
women's clothing, all magazine ads, males, definitions
of beauty, etc.
The Movement has failed, up to this point, to express
a very logical idea (equal rights) to a public that is more
concerned with real life than chip-on-the-shoulder
rhetoric.
But the Movement has been changing, and that's a
good sign. The first strong wave of the Movement was,
let's call it, feminism. Feminism's strongest asset was its
desire to create a new set of values and definitions for
women based on its understanding of society's faults
and inequalities.
Their misanalysis occurred when they over
theorized their observations. Men have caused war and
violence. But to say that men are inherently character
ized by violence and aggression is to merely point out
certain historical realities based on the present power

structure — a structure defined by human characteris
tics, not necessarily male characteristics.
The greatest problem, however, of this earlier
feminist Movement was that in its redefinition of
"woman," it abused the old definition to the point of
ostracizing many women. Its often anti-feminine and
intermittent anti-heterosexual outlook cost it much
popular support from cynical males and insulted
females.
In more recent years, a more feminine Movement
has taken place. This Movement seemed much more
willing to analyze sexual differences on a psychological
and emotional level. Female characteristics were not
being negated — they were often being positively ex
pressed. A female "reluctance to judge" (whether true
or not) could be viewed as a "reluctance to hurt."
The current Women's Movement, it seems, is not
quite so focused as it used to be. And based on the
problems with the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) that
may be a very good thing. The Movement is less likely
to be openly antagonistic to a given fraction of the pop
ulation, and since life is women living with men the
Movement may be getting more realistic. And real
equality for women means real individualism. It is inter
esting that leaders apart from the Movement (Sally
Ride, Sandra Day O'Connor and Jeanne Kirkpatrick)
have done much more for its progress than have t+re
leaders of women's organizations.
But old-style political blindness still hinders the
Movement. Women who want Reagan out at all costs,
for instance, may have failed to notice the pro
individual, pro-initiative characteristics of his ideology.
Reagan may not be the best president for women (or
more importantly, for all of us), but way back in the
foundation of his policies may be the true ideals of the
Women's Movement.
The ERA failed because too many people in the Wo
men's Movement popped off about too many semi
related issues (abortion, homosexual rights, socialism,
etc.) instead of focusing on the simple logic of the
amendment.
If the Women's Movement is about equal rights then
that is what its leaders should discuss. The wisdom that
comes from this equality will help dissolve some of the
societal inadequacies of the present and future. Not
just for women. For everyone.

Someone once said that if the Women's Movement
were headed by a man, it would have achieved much,
much more. Hmm.
It's pretty safe to say that the "Movement" has had
more of its share of problems, and if we look around
and see the realities of life, we can see that the prob
lems stem from too broad a focus. A university is the
best place to see what equality can and should be.
Although Stanford is certainly not the most "activist"
campus in the country, it is one of the most anti-sexist
in terms of the individual intellect and achievement of
its members. By mere interaction, the Stanford student
soon realizes that talent and intelligence know no
gender. The fact that there isn't a strong "Movement"
on campus promotes progress, in that its absence en
hances the emphasis on the individual, which is really
what the Women's Movement should be all about.
The problems which have affected the Women's
Movement in the past few years are the same that
would plague a poorly written novel. The reader knows
that what the writer is trying to express is meaningful,
but the problems of the novel distance the reader and
cause him to either ignore or criticize the writer.
The leaders of the Women's Movement have been
bad writers. On one hand they've been a force for in
volvement. On the other hand they've been a bit ob
noxious, especially to the casual observer (who is the
most common type). The casual observer sees some of
these leaders equating men with rapists, capitalism
with rape — all men against all women in all things.
Bestial domination is inherent, they say, in firearms,
women's clothing, all magazine ads, males, definitions
of beauty, etc.
The Movement has failed, up to this point, to express
a very logical idea (equal rights) to a public that is more
concerned with real life than chip-on-the-shoulder
rhetoric.
But the Movement has been changing, and that's a
good sign. The first strong wave of the Movement was,
let's call it, feminism. Feminism's strongest asset was its
desire to create a new set of values and definitions for
women based on its understanding of society's faults
and inequalities.
Their misanalysis occurred when they over
theorized their observations. Men have caused war and
violence. But to say that men are inherently character
ized by violence and aggression is to merely point out
certain historical realities based on the present power

structure — a structure defined by human characteris
tics, not necessarily male characteristics.
The greatest problem, however, of this earlier
feminist Movement was that in its redefinition of
"woman," it abused the old definition to the point of
ostracizing many women. Its often anti-feminine and
intermittent anti-heterosexual outlook cost it much
popular support from cynical males and insulted
females.
In more recent years, a more feminine Movement
has taken place. This Movement seemed much more
willing to analyze sexual differences on a psychological
and emotional level. Female characteristics were not
being negated — they were often being positively ex
pressed. A female "reluctance to judge" (whether true
or not) could be viewed as a "reluctance to hurt."
The current Women's Movement, it seems, is not
quite so focused as it used to be. And based on the
problems with the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) that
may be a very good thing. The Movement is less likely
to be openly antagonistic to a given fraction of the pop
ulation, and since life is women living with men the
Movement may be getting more realistic. And real
equality for women means real individualism. It is inter
esting that leaders apart from the Movement (Sally
Ride, Sandra Day O'Connor and Jeanne Kirkpatrick)
have done much more for its progress than have t+re
leaders of women's organizations.
But old-style political blindness still hinders the
Movement. Women who want Reagan out at all costs,
for instance, may have failed to notice the pro
individual, pro-initiative characteristics of his ideology.
Reagan may not be the best president for women (or
more importantly, for all of us), but way back in the
foundation of his policies may be the true ideals of the
Women's Movement.
The ERA failed because too many people in the Wo
men's Movement popped off about too many semi
related issues (abortion, homosexual rights, socialism,
etc.) instead of focusing on the simple logic of the
amendment.
If the Women's Movement is about equal rights then
that is what its leaders should discuss. The wisdom that
comes from this equality will help dissolve some of the
societal inadequacies of the present and future. Not
just for women. For everyone.
