Animal research
The negative manner in which
they view the use of pound animals
for research shows extreme ignor
ance on the part of institutions such
as Stanford and individuals such as
state Sen. David Roberti (D-Los
Angeles). They fail to realize that
this research is not inhumane and
benefits all of us. _
Those of us who favor using
these animals for medical and other
types of experimentation are not
cruel and sadistic. In fact, most of

us are animal lovers. However, we
know that animal research is neces
sary in order to help find cures for
human and animal diseases and
that experiments are performed so
as to cause minimal pain for the
animal.
Prohibiting the use of pound
animals would not stop research,
but would mean that more animals
would be bred specifically as re
search subjects. If a pound animal
is going to be put to sleep,
wouldn't it be better to make some
productive use of it rather than

senselessly kill it, especially since
most research animals don't die.
Those who support Sen.
Roberti's bill should look at the
facts. Then they too will admit that
they're only fooling themselves by
saying that it's the humanitarian
thing to do.

Freshman, undeclared
Gaieties offensive
A disturbing aspect of this year's
Gaieties was overlooked in Heather

Millar's gushing review in Friday's
Daily (Nov. 18). The show pre
sented a grotesque insensitivity to
the handicapped, first in the scene
lampooning the social ineptitude of
men physically unfit for service in
World War 11, and then again in
characterizing Weenie football
players as mentally retarded. Such
careless disregard for other people
is offensive anywhere but seems
especially so in a show that
celebrates a world class university.
