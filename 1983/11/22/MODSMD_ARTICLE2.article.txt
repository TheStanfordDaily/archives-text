# Med Center reports Legionnaire's disease

Nine patients recovering from
heart and heart-lung transplant
operations at the Medical Center
have suffered from Legionnaire's
disease since February 1982, a
recent in-house study showed.
The patients, all of whom have
recovered from the disease, were
infected by legionella bacteria
found in a hospital water heater,
Med Center officials said. According
to spokesman Mike Goodkind, one

of the nine was a heart-lung patient
and the rest were heart patients.
There have been seven heart-lung
transplants and approximately 65
heart transplants performed here
since February 1982, Coodkind said.
According to Director of
Microbiology Lucy Tompkins, the
Stanford University Hospital has
devised two solutions to the prob
lem. The ward in which the heart
lung patients had been housed will
be closed temporarily once the two
patients now occupying it have been

transferred. Also, the contaminated
heater — one of two water heaters
used by the Hospital — will be
flushed and the water superheated
in an attempt to kill the legionella
bacteria.
"I expect that this will most likely
take care of the problem,"
Tompkins said.
Tompkins said the study was
prompted by concern over the un
diagnosed pneumonia of a recent
transplant patient. Because it was
known that Legionnaire's disease

produces a type of pneumonia, the
microbiology lab tested this patient
and recent heart-lung patients who
had had similar symptoms to see if
they had been exposed to legionella
bacteria.
The procedure to test for Legion
naire's disease only became
available here last June, according
to Tompkin. Serum from the blood
is analyzed for evidence of an
tibodies to the legionella bacteria.
Because a Med Center physician
had saved sera from the other eight
suspected Legionnaire's victims, the
lab was able to test all the patients at
once.
James Silverman, chief of staff at
the Med Center, explained that this
process can only confirm exposure
to the disease. "Although you can
prove the patient has been in con
tact with legionella with this meth

od, you cannot prove infection," he
said.
Tompkins said the technical pro
cedure necessary to ascertain infec
tion — removing a piece of lung
from the patient for testing — was
not performed on all patients. But
she added that those patients
exposed to legionella bacteria were
most likely infected by it.
"Those nine patients represented
actual cases," she said. "There was
plenty of evidence, and they were
treated as if they were legionella
patients. "
