### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
Sidney Hook, a senior re
search fellow at the Hoover In
stitution, has been selected to
give the 1984 Jefferson lecture
in the humanities.
The lectureship is the high
est honor conferred by the
federal government for out
standing achievement in the
humanities, and carries with it
a $10,000 stipend.
Hook, an emeritus profes
sor of philosophy at New York
University, will deliver the
lecture May 14 in Washington,
D.C.
A spokesman for the Na
tional Endowment for the
Humanities (NEH), which
made the selection, said he
was "delighted" over Hook's
selection.
"He's one of the world's
leading philosophers of
freedom," said the spokes
man, Terry Krueger. "In the
lecture, we expect he'll ex
plore the relationship be
tween the way in which the
humanities are taught, and the
development of moral
courage necessary for defend
ing freedom and fighting
totalitarianism," he said.
NEH Chairman William Ben
net noted that President

Reagan last year described
Hook as "our global philoso
pher of freedom through
more than a half century's
continuous struggle against
the totalitarian ideologies of
right and left."
Established in 1972, the Jef
ferson lecture recognizes the
combination of intellectual
and civic virtues exemplified
by Thomas Jefferson and pro
vides an opportunity for dis
tinguished thinkers to explore
matters of broad concern.
Among previous Jefferson lec
turers have been Saul Bellow,
Paul Freund and Erik Erikson.
Hook, who will be 81 years
old on Dec. 20, received his
B.S. in philosophy from the
City College of New York. He
taught in New York City public
schools while he studied phi
losophy under John Dewey
and F.J.E. Woodbridge at Co
lumbia University.
Hook has written numerous
influential works including
"The Hero in History," for
which he received Columbia
University's Nicholas Murray
Butler silver medal for distinc
tion in the field of philosophy
and education.
Hook was not available for
comment.
