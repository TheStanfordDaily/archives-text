## Women harriers take 2nd 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Oh well. For the second
straight year, the Stanford wo
men's cross country team
came up short at the NCAA
Championships and Cardinal
Coach Brooks Johnson must
be wondering if the Murphy of
Murphy's Law fame is his first
cousin.
Stanford finished second
behind Oregon by a mere
three points, 95-98, at the
NCAAs held on the Lehigh
Univeristy campus yesterday.
But it was the way the Card
took second that has Johnson
shaking his head.
Near the end of the 5000-
meter course on the Saucon
Fields at Lehigh, Stanford
seemed in a commanding po
sition. Sophomore Alison
Wiley, one of the favorites to
capture the individual crown,
was in fourth place overall
with most of her teammates
not far behind.
But with a half mile left,
Wiley hyperventilated and
suddenly dropped well back

in the pack. Wiley struggled to
a 23rd place finish with a time
of 17:18.3. Stanford as a team,
however, still had a shot at
winning.
Regina Jacobs was the Card
harriers' top finisher, taking
ninth place overall at 16:59.30.
Pattie Sue Plumer was 10th at
17:00.7 and freshman Cory
Schubert 31st at 17:25.9.
Junior Ceci Hopp, though,
limped in at 66th due to a hip
injury that prevented her from
running in the District VIII
meet 10 days ago. Hopp took
10th in the NCAA two years
ago and was third last year.
Following Oregon and Stan
ford was North Carolina State
with 99 points, Tennessee at
103 and Wisconsin at 107 —
making the top five teams
within 12 points of each other.
The only other West Coast
squads in the team competi
tion, Washington State and
UC-lrvine, were 15th and 16th,
respectively.
Oregon's top five or point
scoring runners finished in

third, 17th, 27th, 41st and 52nd
while the top Card five were in
ninth, 10th, 23rd, 31st and
66th.
Strictly adding the places up
for each team, as is the usual
procedure, Stanford comes
out on top by a 141-150 score.
But in the NCAA Champion
ships, through a scoring meth
od called displacement, the
individual harriers (not run
ning as part of a team) are
removed from the final stand
ings.
So when the displacement
was put into effect, Oregon
came out on top of Stanford
by the three-point margin.
North Carolina State's Betty
Jo Springs took the individual
title with a 16:30.7, winning by
nearly five seconds over her
closest competitor — lowa's
Nan Doak at 16:35.2.
Also running for Stanford
was Michelle Mason, who
finished in 124 th with a 19:42.0
clocking, and Angela Nervi,
who took 133 rd at 25:42.3.
