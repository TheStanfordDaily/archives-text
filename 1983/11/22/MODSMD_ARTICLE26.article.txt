# Davis announces hoop recruits
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford announced yesterday the
names of the three basketball recruits
it signed to national letters of intent
last week.
Heading the list is 6-foot-7, 185-
pound toward Richard Carr from
Thousand Oaks, touted as one of the
top players in Southern California.
Guard Scott Meinert of Salem, Ore.,
and local star Eric Reveno also ex
pressed their intent to attend Stanford
next fall pending their acceptance to
the University.
"I'm pleased with our recruiting ef
fort," said Stanford Head Coach Tom
Davis, who is saving his fourth and
final scholarship for the spring round
of recruiting "They must continue to
work hard in the classroom and go
through the normal admissions
process, but they all have strong aca
demic credentials and we're enthused
about their potential at Stanford."
Carr, who averaged 17.7 points and
10 rebounds a game for Thousand
Oaks High, was recruited by every
Pacific-10 Conference school
(including nationally-ranked UCLA and

Oregon State), Pepperdine, Brigham
Young and UC-Santa Barbara.
As a junior, Carr was a third-team
All-CIF selection as well as first-team
All-Marmonte League, All-Ventura
County and All-San Fernando Valley
(according to the Los Angeles Times).
Besides his athletic honors, he was a
National Merit PSAT honorable men
tion choice.
"At 6-7 with his ability to bang
(shoot), most people would figure him
for a power position," said Stanford
associate head coach Bruce Pearl.
"However, his quickness and agility
will allow him to play more out front.
"If you were to paint a picture of a
Tom Davis-style player, Richard Carr
would fill your canvas," Pearl contin
ued. "He's a good one."
Meinert, who initially was contacted
by 70 schools, received scholarship of
fers from Washington and Oregon,
but turned both of them down in favor
of Stanford even though his father, Jim
Meinert, was a track star at Oregon in
the mid-19605.
"If you're going to go to school, you
might as well as go to the best school

on the West Coast," Meinert said.
"Plus, I got a tan (when visiting Stan
ford) in two days.''
Like Carr, the 6-2, 165 pound
Meinert enters his senior season at
South Salem High already rich with
honors. In leading his team to a
second-place finish in the state tourna
ment, Meinert was a first-team All-
State selection with a 19.1 points per
game average. Known for his excellent
outside shooting ability, he hit on 61
percent of his field goal tries.
"He (Meinert) has fine offensive
skills, but we were equally pleased
with his defensive potential," Davis
said.
Stanford's third recruit, 6-7, 235
pound center Reveno, announced his
intention to attend Stanford two
months ago. Reveno, who played on
the same high school basketball team
as Cardinal freshman starting quarter
back John Paye, averaged 15 points
and 11 rebounds for Atherton's Menlo
School last year.
He and Paye led Menlo to a 32-3
record and the California Division II
State basketball title last season.
