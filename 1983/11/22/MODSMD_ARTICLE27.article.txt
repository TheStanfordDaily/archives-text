# Last home match for Card spikers
## 
### TOM MOORE 
Assured a second place finish in the WCAA conference, the
Stanford women's volleyball team takes the Maples Pavilion
floor for the final time this season tonight at 7 p.m.
Facing Long Beach State in their last home contest for the Car
dinal are seniors Julie Baker and Kari Rush, who have been in
strumental in the team's success all year.
"They've been an important part of our program since we
recruited them," said Card assistant coach Don Shaw. "They
came here when Stanford wasn't a prominent, ranked team and
helped make it that way."
Both players consistently de-emphasize individual contribu
tions, feeling that the most important goal is that the squad as a
unit succeeds. "We've been playing well lately even though
we've had some tough losses," said Baker, an outside hitter.
"We're hoping to do well at the NCAA playoffs."
Stanford sports a 17-7 record on the season, and should it win
tonight, will finish 11-3 in the WCAA for the second consecutive
year. The team seems guaranteed a place in the NCAA tourna
ment which begins Dec. 2.
