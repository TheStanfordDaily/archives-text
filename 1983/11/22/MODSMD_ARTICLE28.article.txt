## 'La Gioconda': a strong effort for a weak opera 
### ROBERT WOOLSEY 
Trapped between the tradi
tion of Italian bel canto opera
and nascent Wagnerian
verisimo in the late 19th cen
tury, Ponchielli's La Gioconda
is influenced by both yet
succeeds at neither. That it
succeeds at all today, espe-

That it succeeds at all today, especially in major opera houses
like San Francisco's, demonstrates the marked dependence of
these houses on bringing in the heavyweights to sing the great
numbers that are all too often found in inferior operas.
Nevertheless, it's to the San Francisco Opera's credit that it can
give 'La Gioconda' the theatrical treatment which it doesn't
deserve with no pretenses over this opera's many weaknesses, or
worse, without resorting to production overkill.

like San Francisco's,
demonstrates the marked de
pendence of these houses on
bringing in the heavyweights
to sing the great numbers that
are all too often found in in
ferior operas. Nevertheless,
it's to the San Francisco
Opera's credit that it can give
La Gioconda the theatrical
treatment which it doesn't
deserve with no pretenses
over this opera's many weak
nesses, or worse, without
resorting to production over
kill.
Although all six major roles,
needless to say, were sung
magnificently, Montserrat
Caballe and Franco Bonisolli
deserve much of the credit for
making the performance more
than an elaborate vehicle for
musical virtuosity. Without
Caballe's dramatic intensity as
Gioconda, I could have been
more forgiving of the
Countess Laura's paper-thin
character; had not Bonisolli as
Enzo demonstrated the energy
of youth and the fallibility of
love, I would have thought
Barnaba's mechanical ruth
lessness and base lust the
symptoms of lackluster acting.
Without doubt, Caballe and
Bonisolli's performances were
the dramatic kingpins of the
production, lending dramatic
integrity to some of Ponchiel
li's most inspired work and
Zack Brown's impressive
design.
Unfortunately, Caballe will
sing the role only once more
for San Francisco this
Thursday; the last three per
formances will feature
Romanian soprano Maria
Slatinaru in her American
debut. Slatinaru is a relative
newcomer of whom I know
little and on whom's perfor
mance I am unqualified to
speculate. Caballe, however,
has been one of the world's
most in-demand sopranos
since 1956, and this perfor
mance, her American debut in
the title role, was inimitatable.
Often in opera, bel canto
opera especially, the viewer
resigns himself to accepting
the "inevitable" dramatic
compromises in order to get
the most out of the music.
The heroine, handkerchief
firmly in hand, simply sings,
allowing her disciplined voice
and the music to carry the bur
den of expression (which they
do readily, at that) whether
the compelling emotion is
love, envy, excitement, or sor
row. Mariana Paunova, sing
ing the role of Laura, followed
this standard to a "tee," occa

sionally punctuating particu
larly nasty lines in the libretto
(which is in Italian) with a
clenched fist, or falling down
in grief. I thank Caballe,
though, for her sensitivity to
the language barrier as she
used gestures not to
punctuate lines, but to em

phasize the protean moods of
her numbers. It was a beauti
ful integration of voice and ac
tion that I suspect only a hand
ful of the best singers have
mastered.
In opera the musical exten
sion of a word or a note is of
ten used to achieve dramatic
emphasis; Caballe used the
same principle in gesture,
bringing dramatic realtime to
a standstill in crystalline mo
ments of pure rage, jealousy
and desperation.
Nevertheless most of
Caballe's numbers came in
the second and fourth acts
where her voice and character
commanded the stage despite
Richard Bradshaw's fine
chorus. Meanwhile, the audi
ence had to squirm through
Barnaba's "evil machinations"
designed to extort the affec
tions of Gioconda in the first
act, and again listen helplessly
as the Count Alvise pondered
the macabre fate he held in
store for the Countess Laura in
the third. Thwarting, in some
respects, both these fiendish
plans was tenor Franco
Bonisolli in the role of Enzo
who, much like Caballe, was
not only vocally superb,
producing showstopping high
C's, but also portrayed the
young lovestruck captain of
the Hecate with conviction
and enthusiasm.
Although his role was last
sung in San Francisco by
Pavarotti in the televised 1979
opening night, Bonisolli
showed no qualms about step
ping into the shoes of one of
America's favorite tenors. In
fact, I think he enjoyed it from
the moment he charged on
stage to quell singlehandedly
the agitated chorus until his
climactic duet with Gioconda
where he came within a hair's
breadth of murdering her. The
crowd sensed his pleasure and
gradually warmed to him.
Though La Gioconda has
substantive tunes early on, the
house was reserved and quite
mum despite the excellent
singing by Matteo Manuguer
ra as Barnaba and Sheila Nad
ler as La Cieca, whose rendi
tion of the "Rosary Theme"
was the dramatic and musical
focus of the first act. It was not
until Bonisolli's admirable
"Gia ti veggo" and his poig
nantly powerful "Cielo e
mar!" in the second act that
the audience responded with
any of the enthusiasm one
might expect at a "singer's
opera." Swinging on the toes
of his boots which had once
belonged to Errol Flynn (and
which he had purchased for

during or after a number.
Yet it was not simply a mat
ter of Bonisolli's energetic
style being well-suited to the
role of Enzo; the part itself
was and is vulnerable to a far
more flamboyant, not to men
tion inappropriate, stylistic

the role), he soared through
his gutsy tunes, finishing each
by kicking back his head and
opening his arms to greet fre
quently a minute or more of
applause. Thanks to him, from
then on through the final two
acts the audience did not
hesitate to applaud any singer

treatment. Rather, Bonisolli
demonstrated a dramatic in
stinct similar to that of
Caballe. Inasmuch as I soon
overlooked Caballe's size and
age (both somewhat
"capacious") in the course of
her performance, it simply did
not occur to me that I was lis
tening to and watching a man
in his late 40s (or thereabouts)
portray a character 20 years his
junior. His dark hair and good
looks contributed to the illu
sion, but Bonisolli's Enzo was
more volatile than wrathful,
more rash than vengeful â€”
those latter characteristics
more descriptive of Verdi's
Otello, an older man with a
similar nature.
The third principal role, that
of Barnaba, did not afford the
same dramatic opportunity to
Matteo Manuguerra, who did
a credible job all the same.
The part is hobbled by circum
stances both within and
outside of the opera, and like

the role of En/o, it can be
made too camp Manuguerra
handled it lightly, however,
perhaps even too lightly in the
first act, and then later risked
more involvement after
Bonisolli brought the Tuesday
night crowd around. Easily
swinging his dark baritone to a
high A flat, Manuguerra com
manded our attention in his
difficult numbers, but never
our loathing as a truly evil spy
to the Inquisition should.
The fault, though, does not
lie with Manuguerra's perfor
mance but with Barnaba him
self. His scheming is impulsive
and to a short-lived end, a
Sancho Panza turned to the
dark side. Furthermore, he
was and always will be
upstaged by his far blacker
successor lago, a role
premiered in Verdi's Otello in
1887, 11 years after La
Gioconda came to the stage.
Arrigo Boito did the libretti for
both and actually added his
own famous "Credo" into the
dialogue of Shakespeare's

already substantially vile crea
tion to make lago a figure of
consumate evil in Verdi's
opera masterpiece. The differ
ence between the two is far
more than degrees of evil.
Whereas Barnaba plotted
clumsily toward an undeniably
evil end, lago had to concoct _
various ends in which he
could find outlet for his black
nature. Barnaba's plans
crumbled horribly at
Gioconda's suicide; only
lago's own death could ever
slow the evil which he
generated.
You might say that in a
medium of extremes such as
opera, Manuguerra did his
best at portraying a marginally
evil character. I thought his
best moment came in the
second act's "Pescadore" and
duet with Enzo where he fi
nally had the chance to show
some dramatic flexibility well
integrated with his good
voice.

Sheila Nadler too, as La
Cieca, performed well in her
limited role. The part has
some good numbers, the
"Rosary Theme" the most well
known, but as Gioconda's
blind mother she spent most
of her time groping frightfully
for her daughter when not in
tow behind Barnaba, who
hoped, oddly, by threatening
her he could gain Gioconda's
affections. Nadler's rich con
tralto has landed her many
matronly roles such as this,
and many have done her tal
ents more justice. She is a fa
vorite at the Met as the witch
in Hansel and Gretel and has
had her greatest success in the
title role of The Grand
Duchess of Gerolstein.
Filling out the principal cast
were Greek bass Dimitri Kav
rakos and Bulgarian contralto
Mariana Paunova, both
making their San Francisco
Opera debut. As the Count
Alvise and wife Laura, the pair
sang masterfully but were so

stiff about it they made
Caballe and Bonisolli shine all
the more. I questioned,
though, Kavrakos's behavior
in the first scene of the third
act where, as he plotted the
death of Laura, he chose to
pace his large, heavily draped

body about a fairly compact
area of the stage at the ex
pense of all props that weren't
bolted down. Learning from
Caballe, he could be as
menacing standing still, pro
vided his dramatic expression
matched his virtuoso singing.
Laura, as well, though love
ly, was inexpressive. Paunova
could rifle her voice through
the acoustically inferior or
chestra seats like the much in
demand concert artist that she
is, while never letting us see
what made her so readily
cuckold the Count in favor of
Enzo. The libretto answers this
in her repentant second act
soliloquy aboard the Hecate
yet her performance conveyed
little to us. As I mentioned, we
scarcely need to look to the
libretto for the details of
Gioconda's character â€”
Caballe laid them all bare. Ex
cept for the soliloquy there is
little told of and little we need
to know about Laura. As a
result, I am more inclined to

see Paunova's performance
more as the upshot of her role
than as a poor reflection of her
abilities. I think much the
same can be said of most of
the opera's weak and
awkward moments.
Ironically, one of the

opera's weakest dramatic ele
ments is also its most remem
bered musical moment;
besides, none could write a
review of La Gioconda without
mentioning the third act's
"Dance of the Hours." For the
1979 televised version, this
piece (which is recognized by
most of us from the hinter
lands as "Hello Mudda, Hello
Fadda") was given the full, al
beit too indulgent, textual
treatment. This time around
Vassili Sulich provided simple,
elegant choreography in
which Sarah Oppenheimer
was a delight to watch. The
two other principal dancers,
Gregory Gonzales and Peter
Childers, are to be com
mended as well.
By in large, this perfor
mance was a credit to the en
ergy of the San Francisco
Opera. From Andrew
Meltzer's tight orchestra to
the fastidious technical work
of Daniel Pyre (really) who
burned the Hecate in all of a

minute and 30 seconds, the
company unfailingly held to its
professional tradition, proving
that despite setbacks often in
trinsic to an opera, it can
transform what would other
wise be an expensive nap into
a very successful production.

gradually warmed to him.
Though La Gioconda has
substantive tunes early on, the
house was reserved and quite
mum despite the excellent
singing by Matteo Manuguer
ra as Barnaba and Sheila Nad
ler as La Cieca, whose rendi
tion of the "Rosary Theme"
was the dramatic and musical
focus of the first act. It was not
until Bonisolli's admirable
"Gia ti veggo" and his poig
nantly powerful "Cielo e
mar!" in the second act that
the audience responded with
any of the enthusiasm one
might expect at a "singer's
opera." Swinging on the toes
of his boots which had once
belonged to Errol Flynn (and
which he had purchased for

during or after a number.
Yet it was not simply a mat
ter of Bonisolli's energetic
style being well-suited to the
role of Enzo; the part itself
was and is vulnerable to a far
more flamboyant, not to men
tion inappropriate, stylistic

the role), he soared through
his gutsy tunes, finishing each
by kicking back his head and
opening his arms to greet fre
quently a minute or more of
applause. Thanks to him, from
then on through the final two
acts the audience did not
hesitate to applaud any singer

treatment. Rather, Bonisolli
demonstrated a dramatic in
stinct similar to that of
Caballe. Inasmuch as I soon
overlooked Caballe's size and
age (both somewhat
"capacious") in the course of
her performance, it simply did
not occur to me that I was lis
tening to and watching a man
in his late 40s (or thereabouts)
portray a character 20 years his
junior. His dark hair and good
looks contributed to the illu
sion, but Bonisolli's Enzo was
more volatile than wrathful,
more rash than vengeful â€”
those latter characteristics
more descriptive of Verdi's
Otello, an older man with a
similar nature.
The third principal role, that
of Barnaba, did not afford the
same dramatic opportunity to
Matteo Manuguerra, who did
a credible job all the same.
The part is hobbled by circum
stances both within and
outside of the opera, and like

the role of En/o, it can be
made too camp Manuguerra
handled it lightly, however,
perhaps even too lightly in the
first act, and then later risked
more involvement after
Bonisolli brought the Tuesday
night crowd around. Easily
swinging his dark baritone to a
high A flat, Manuguerra com
manded our attention in his
difficult numbers, but never
our loathing as a truly evil spy
to the Inquisition should.
The fault, though, does not
lie with Manuguerra's perfor
mance but with Barnaba him
self. His scheming is impulsive
and to a short-lived end, a
Sancho Panza turned to the
dark side. Furthermore, he
was and always will be
upstaged by his far blacker
successor lago, a role
premiered in Verdi's Otello in
1887, 11 years after La
Gioconda came to the stage.
Arrigo Boito did the libretti for
both and actually added his
own famous "Credo" into the
dialogue of Shakespeare's

already substantially vile crea
tion to make lago a figure of
consumate evil in Verdi's
opera masterpiece. The differ
ence between the two is far
more than degrees of evil.
Whereas Barnaba plotted
clumsily toward an undeniably
evil end, lago had to concoct _
various ends in which he
could find outlet for his black
nature. Barnaba's plans
crumbled horribly at
Gioconda's suicide; only
lago's own death could ever
slow the evil which he
generated.
You might say that in a
medium of extremes such as
opera, Manuguerra did his
best at portraying a marginally
evil character. I thought his
best moment came in the
second act's "Pescadore" and
duet with Enzo where he fi
nally had the chance to show
some dramatic flexibility well
integrated with his good
voice.

Sheila Nadler too, as La
Cieca, performed well in her
limited role. The part has
some good numbers, the
"Rosary Theme" the most well
known, but as Gioconda's
blind mother she spent most
of her time groping frightfully
for her daughter when not in
tow behind Barnaba, who
hoped, oddly, by threatening
her he could gain Gioconda's
affections. Nadler's rich con
tralto has landed her many
matronly roles such as this,
and many have done her tal
ents more justice. She is a fa
vorite at the Met as the witch
in Hansel and Gretel and has
had her greatest success in the
title role of The Grand
Duchess of Gerolstein.
Filling out the principal cast
were Greek bass Dimitri Kav
rakos and Bulgarian contralto
Mariana Paunova, both
making their San Francisco
Opera debut. As the Count
Alvise and wife Laura, the pair
sang masterfully but were so

stiff about it they made
Caballe and Bonisolli shine all
the more. I questioned,
though, Kavrakos's behavior
in the first scene of the third
act where, as he plotted the
death of Laura, he chose to
pace his large, heavily draped

body about a fairly compact
area of the stage at the ex
pense of all props that weren't
bolted down. Learning from
Caballe, he could be as
menacing standing still, pro
vided his dramatic expression
matched his virtuoso singing.
Laura, as well, though love
ly, was inexpressive. Paunova
could rifle her voice through
the acoustically inferior or
chestra seats like the much in
demand concert artist that she
is, while never letting us see
what made her so readily
cuckold the Count in favor of
Enzo. The libretto answers this
in her repentant second act
soliloquy aboard the Hecate
yet her performance conveyed
little to us. As I mentioned, we
scarcely need to look to the
libretto for the details of
Gioconda's character â€”
Caballe laid them all bare. Ex
cept for the soliloquy there is
little told of and little we need
to know about Laura. As a
result, I am more inclined to

see Paunova's performance
more as the upshot of her role
than as a poor reflection of her
abilities. I think much the
same can be said of most of
the opera's weak and
awkward moments.
Ironically, one of the

opera's weakest dramatic ele
ments is also its most remem
bered musical moment;
besides, none could write a
review of La Gioconda without
mentioning the third act's
"Dance of the Hours." For the
1979 televised version, this
piece (which is recognized by
most of us from the hinter
lands as "Hello Mudda, Hello
Fadda") was given the full, al
beit too indulgent, textual
treatment. This time around
Vassili Sulich provided simple,
elegant choreography in
which Sarah Oppenheimer
was a delight to watch. The
two other principal dancers,
Gregory Gonzales and Peter
Childers, are to be com
mended as well.
By in large, this perfor
mance was a credit to the en
ergy of the San Francisco
Opera. From Andrew
Meltzer's tight orchestra to
the fastidious technical work
of Daniel Pyre (really) who
burned the Hecate in all of a

minute and 30 seconds, the
company unfailingly held to its
professional tradition, proving
that despite setbacks often in
trinsic to an opera, it can
transform what would other
wise be an expensive nap into
a very successful production.


OPERATIC INTENSITY: Montserrat Caballe and Franco Bonisolli delivered
sparkling performances in the San Francisco Opera's presentation of

Ponchielli's 'La Gioconda.' Here, La Gioconda (Caballe) resists the evil ad
vances of the sinister Barnaba (Matteo Mauguerra).
Trapped between the tradi
tion of Italian bel canto opera
and nascent Wagnerian
verisimo in the late 19th cen
tury, Ponchielli's La Gioconda
is influenced by both yet
succeeds at neither. That it
succeeds at all today, espe-

That it succeeds at all today, especially in major opera houses
like San Francisco's, demonstrates the marked dependence of
these houses on bringing in the heavyweights to sing the great
numbers that are all too often found in inferior operas.
Nevertheless, it's to the San Francisco Opera's credit that it can
give 'La Gioconda' the theatrical treatment which it doesn't
deserve with no pretenses over this opera's many weaknesses, or
worse, without resorting to production overkill.

pendence of these houses on
bringing in the heavyweights
to sing the great numbers that
are all too often found in in
ferior operas. Nevertheless,
it's to the San Francisco
Opera's credit that it can give
La Gioconda the theatrical
treatment which it doesn't
deserve with no pretenses
over this opera's many weak
nesses, or worse, without
resorting to production over
kill.
Although all six major roles,
needless to say, were sung
magnificently, Montserrat
Caballe and Franco Bonisolli
deserve much of the credit for
making the performance more
than an elaborate vehicle for
musical virtuosity. Without
Caballe's dramatic intensity as
Gioconda, I could have been
more forgiving of the
Countess Laura's paper-thin
character; had not Bonisolli as
Enzo demonstrated the energy
of youth and the fallibility of
love, I would have thought
Barnaba's mechanical ruth
lessness and base lust the
symptoms of lackluster acting.
Without doubt, Caballe and
Bonisolli's performances were
the dramatic kingpins of the
production, lending dramatic
integrity to some of Ponchiel
li's most inspired work and
Zack Brown's impressive
design.
Unfortunately, Caballe will
sing the role only once more
for San Francisco this
Thursday; the last three per
formances will feature
Romanian soprano Maria
Slatinaru in her American
debut. Slatinaru is a relative
newcomer of whom I know
little and on whom's perfor
mance I am unqualified to
speculate. Caballe, however,
has been one of the world's
most in-demand sopranos
since 1956, and this perfor
mance, her American debut in
the title role, was inimitatable.
Often in opera, bel canto
opera especially, the viewer
resigns himself to accepting
the "inevitable" dramatic
compromises in order to get
the most out of the music.
The heroine, handkerchief
firmly in hand, simply sings,
allowing her disciplined voice
and the music to carry the bur
den of expression (which they
do readily, at that) whether
the compelling emotion is
love, envy, excitement, or sor
row. Mariana Paunova, sing
ing the role of Laura, followed
this standard to a "tee," occa

sionally punctuating particu
larly nasty lines in the libretto
(which is in Italian) with a
clenched fist, or falling down
in grief. I thank Caballe,
though, for her sensitivity to
the language barrier as she
used gestures not to
punctuate lines, but to em

phasize the protean moods of
her numbers. It was a beauti
ful integration of voice and ac
tion that I suspect only a hand
ful of the best singers have
mastered.
In opera the musical exten
sion of a word or a note is of
ten used to achieve dramatic
emphasis; Caballe used the
same principle in gesture,
bringing dramatic realtime to
a standstill in crystalline mo
ments of pure rage, jealousy
and desperation.
Nevertheless most of
Caballe's numbers came in
the second and fourth acts
where her voice and character
commanded the stage despite
Richard Bradshaw's fine
chorus. Meanwhile, the audi
ence had to squirm through
Barnaba's "evil machinations"
designed to extort the affec
tions of Gioconda in the first
act, and again listen helplessly
as the Count Alvise pondered
the macabre fate he held in
store for the Countess Laura in
the third. Thwarting, in some
respects, both these fiendish
plans was tenor Franco
Bonisolli in the role of Enzo
who, much like Caballe, was
not only vocally superb,
producing showstopping high
C's, but also portrayed the
young lovestruck captain of
the Hecate with conviction
and enthusiasm.
Although his role was last
sung in San Francisco by
Pavarotti in the televised 1979
opening night, Bonisolli
showed no qualms about step
ping into the shoes of one of
America's favorite tenors. In
fact, I think he enjoyed it from
the moment he charged on
stage to quell singlehandedly
the agitated chorus until his
climactic duet with Gioconda
where he came within a hair's
breadth of murdering her. The
crowd sensed his pleasure and
gradually warmed to him.
Though La Gioconda has
substantive tunes early on, the
house was reserved and quite
mum despite the excellent
singing by Matteo Manuguer

the more. I questioned,
though, Kavrakos's behavior
in the first scene of the third
act where, as he plotted the
death of Laura, he chose to
pace his large, heavily draped

body about a fairly compact
area of the stage at the ex
pense of all props that weren't
bolted down. Learning from
Caballe, he could be as
menacing standing still, pro
vided his dramatic expression
matched his virtuoso singing.
Laura, as well, though love
ly, was inexpressive. Paunova
could rifle her voice through
the acoustically inferior or
chestra seats like the much in
demand concert artist that she
is, while never letting us see
what made her so readily
cuckold the Count in favor of
Enzo. The libretto answers this
in her repentant second act
soliloquy aboard the Hecate
yet her performance conveyed
little to us. As I mentioned, we
scarcely need to look to the
libretto for the details of
Gioconda's character â€”
Caballe laid them all bare. Ex
cept for the soliloquy there is
little told of and little we need
to know about Laura. As a
result, I am more inclined to

see Paunova's performance
more as the upshot of her role
than as a poor reflection of her
abilities. I think much the
same can be said of most of
the opera's weak and
awkward moments.
Ironically, one of the

opera's weakest dramatic ele
ments is also its most remem
bered musical moment;
besides, none could write a
review of La Gioconda without
mentioning the third act's
"Dance of the Hours." For the
1979 televised version, this
piece (which is recognized by
most of us from the hinter
lands as "Hello Mudda, Hello
Fadda") was given the full, al
beit too indulgent, textual
treatment. This time around
Vassili Sulich provided simple,
elegant choreography in
which Sarah Oppenheimer
was a delight to watch. The
two other principal dancers,
Gregory Gonzales and Peter
Childers, are to be com
mended as well.
By in large, this perfor
mance was a credit to the en
ergy of the San Francisco
Opera. From Andrew
Meltzer's tight orchestra to
the fastidious technical work
of Daniel Pyre (really) who
burned the Hecate in all of a

minute and 30 seconds, the
company unfailingly held to its
professional tradition, proving
that despite setbacks often in
trinsic to an opera, it can
transform what would other
wise be an expensive nap into
a very successful production.


OPERATIC INTENSITY: Montserrat Caballe and Franco Bonisolli delivered
sparkling performances in the San Francisco Opera's presentation of

Ponchielli's 'La Gioconda.' Here, La Gioconda (Caballe) resists the evil ad
vances of the sinister Barnaba (Matteo Mauguerra).
Trapped between the tradi
tion of Italian bel canto opera
and nascent Wagnerian
verisimo in the late 19th cen
tury, Ponchielli's La Gioconda
is influenced by both yet
succeeds at neither. That it
succeeds at all today, espe-

That it succeeds at all today, especially in major opera houses

these houses on bringing in the heavyweights to sing the great
numbers that are all too often found in inferior operas.
Nevertheless, it's to the San Francisco Opera's credit that it can
give 'La Gioconda' the theatrical treatment which it doesn't
deserve with no pretenses over this opera's many weaknesses, or
worse, without resorting to production overkill.

pendence of these houses on

Opera's credit that it can give
La Gioconda the theatrical
treatment which it doesn't
deserve with no pretenses
over this opera's many weak
nesses, or worse, without
resorting to production over

Although all six major roles,
needless to say, were sung
magnificently, Montserrat
Caballe and Franco Bonisolli
deserve much of the credit for
making the performance more
than an elaborate vehicle for
musical virtuosity. Without
Caballe's dramatic intensity as
Gioconda, I could have been
more forgiving of the
Countess Laura's paper-thin
character; had not Bonisolli as
Enzo demonstrated the energy
of youth and the fallibility of
love, I would have thought
Barnaba's mechanical ruth
lessness and base lust the
symptoms of lackluster acting.
Without doubt, Caballe and
Bonisolli's performances were
the dramatic kingpins of the
production, lending dramatic
integrity to some of Ponchiel
li's most inspired work and
Zack Brown's impressive
design.
Unfortunately, Caballe will
sing the role only once more
for San Francisco this
Thursday; the last three per
formances will feature
Romanian soprano Maria
Slatinaru in her American
debut. Slatinaru is a relative
newcomer of whom I know
little and on whom's perfor
mance I am unqualified to
speculate. Caballe, however,
has been one of the world's
most in-demand sopranos
since 1956, and this perfor
mance, her American debut in
the title role, was inimitatable.
Often in opera, bel canto
opera especially, the viewer
resigns himself to accepting
the "inevitable" dramatic
compromises in order to get
the most out of the music.
The heroine, handkerchief
firmly in hand, simply sings,
allowing her disciplined voice
and the music to carry the bur
den of expression (which they
do readily, at that) whether
the compelling emotion is
love, envy, excitement, or sor
row. Mariana Paunova, sing
ing the role of Laura, followed
this standard to a "tee," occa

sionally punctuating particu
larly nasty lines in the libretto
(which is in Italian) with a
clenched fist, or falling down
in grief. I thank Caballe,
though, for her sensitivity to
the language barrier as she
used gestures not to
punctuate lines, but to em

phasize the protean moods of
her numbers. It was a beauti
ful integration of voice and ac
tion that I suspect only a hand
ful of the best singers have
mastered.
In opera the musical exten
sion of a word or a note is of
ten used to achieve dramatic
emphasis; Caballe used the
same principle in gesture,
bringing dramatic realtime to
a standstill in crystalline mo
ments of pure rage, jealousy
and desperation.
Nevertheless most of
Caballe's numbers came in
the second and fourth acts
where her voice and character
commanded the stage despite
Richard Bradshaw's fine
chorus. Meanwhile, the audi
ence had to squirm through
Barnaba's "evil machinations"
designed to extort the affec
tions of Gioconda in the first
act, and again listen helplessly
as the Count Alvise pondered
the macabre fate he held in
store for the Countess Laura in
the third. Thwarting, in some
respects, both these fiendish
plans was tenor Franco
Bonisolli in the role of Enzo
who, much like Caballe, was
not only vocally superb,
producing showstopping high
C's, but also portrayed the
young lovestruck captain of
the Hecate with conviction
and enthusiasm.
Although his role was last
sung in San Francisco by
Pavarotti in the televised 1979
opening night, Bonisolli
showed no qualms about step
ping into the shoes of one of
America's favorite tenors. In
fact, I think he enjoyed it from
the moment he charged on
stage to quell singlehandedly
the agitated chorus until his
climactic duet with Gioconda
where he came within a hair's
breadth of murdering her. The
crowd sensed his pleasure and
gradually warmed to him.
Though La Gioconda has
substantive tunes early on, the
house was reserved and quite
mum despite the excellent
singing by Matteo Manuguer
ra as Barnaba and Sheila Nad
ler as La Cieca, whose rendi
tion of the "Rosary Theme"
was the dramatic and musical
focus of the first act. It was not
until Bonisolli's admirable
"Gia ti veggo" and his poig
nantly powerful "Cielo e
mar!" in the second act that
the audience responded with
any of the enthusiasm one
might expect at a "singer's
opera." Swinging on the toes
of his boots which had once
belonged to Errol Flynn (and
which he had purchased for

during or after a number.
Yet it was not simply a mat
ter of Bonisolli's energetic
style being well-suited to the
role of Enzo; the part itself
was and is vulnerable to a far
more flamboyant, not to men
tion inappropriate, stylistic

the role), he soared through
his gutsy tunes, finishing each
by kicking back his head and
opening his arms to greet fre
quently a minute or more of
applause. Thanks to him, from
then on through the final two
acts the audience did not
hesitate to applaud any singer

treatment. Rather, Bonisolli
demonstrated a dramatic in
stinct similar to that of
Caballe. Inasmuch as I soon
overlooked Caballe's size and
age (both somewhat
"capacious") in the course of
her performance, it simply did
not occur to me that I was lis
tening to and watching a man
in his late 40s (or thereabouts)
portray a character 20 years his
junior. His dark hair and good
looks contributed to the illu
sion, but Bonisolli's Enzo was
more volatile than wrathful,
more rash than vengeful â€”
those latter characteristics
more descriptive of Verdi's
Otello, an older man with a
similar nature.
The third principal role, that
of Barnaba, did not afford the
same dramatic opportunity to
Matteo Manuguerra, who did
a credible job all the same.
The part is hobbled by circum
stances both within and
outside of the opera, and like

the role of En/o, it can be
made too camp Manuguerra
handled it lightly, however,
perhaps even too lightly in the
first act, and then later risked
more involvement after
Bonisolli brought the Tuesday
night crowd around. Easily
swinging his dark baritone to a
high A flat, Manuguerra com
manded our attention in his
difficult numbers, but never
our loathing as a truly evil spy
to the Inquisition should.
The fault, though, does not
lie with Manuguerra's perfor
mance but with Barnaba him
self. His scheming is impulsive
and to a short-lived end, a
Sancho Panza turned to the
dark side. Furthermore, he
was and always will be
upstaged by his far blacker
successor lago, a role
premiered in Verdi's Otello in
1887, 11 years after La
Gioconda came to the stage.
Arrigo Boito did the libretti for
both and actually added his
own famous "Credo" into the
dialogue of Shakespeare's

already substantially vile crea
tion to make lago a figure of
consumate evil in Verdi's
opera masterpiece. The differ
ence between the two is far
more than degrees of evil.
Whereas Barnaba plotted
clumsily toward an undeniably
evil end, lago had to concoct _
various ends in which he
could find outlet for his black
nature. Barnaba's plans
crumbled horribly at
Gioconda's suicide; only
lago's own death could ever
slow the evil which he
generated.
You might say that in a
medium of extremes such as
opera, Manuguerra did his
best at portraying a marginally
evil character. I thought his
best moment came in the
second act's "Pescadore" and
duet with Enzo where he fi
nally had the chance to show
some dramatic flexibility well
integrated with his good
voice.

Sheila Nadler too, as La
Cieca, performed well in her
limited role. The part has
some good numbers, the
"Rosary Theme" the most well
known, but as Gioconda's
blind mother she spent most
of her time groping frightfully
for her daughter when not in
tow behind Barnaba, who
hoped, oddly, by threatening
her he could gain Gioconda's
affections. Nadler's rich con
tralto has landed her many
matronly roles such as this,
and many have done her tal
ents more justice. She is a fa
vorite at the Met as the witch
in Hansel and Gretel and has
had her greatest success in the
title role of The Grand
Duchess of Gerolstein.
Filling out the principal cast
were Greek bass Dimitri Kav
rakos and Bulgarian contralto
Mariana Paunova, both
making their San Francisco
Opera debut. As the Count
Alvise and wife Laura, the pair
sang masterfully but were so

stiff about it they made
Caballe and Bonisolli shine all
the more. I questioned,
though, Kavrakos's behavior
in the first scene of the third
act where, as he plotted the
death of Laura, he chose to
pace his large, heavily draped

body about a fairly compact
area of the stage at the ex
pense of all props that weren't
bolted down. Learning from

little and on whom's perfor
mance I am unqualified to
speculate. Caballe, however,
has been one of the world's
most in-demand sopranos
since 1956, and this perfor
mance, her American debut in
the title role, was inimitatable.
Often in opera, bel canto
opera especially, the viewer
resigns himself to accepting
the "inevitable" dramatic
compromises in order to get
the most out of the music.
The heroine, handkerchief
firmly in hand, simply sings,
allowing her disciplined voice
and the music to carry the bur
den of expression (which they
do readily, at that) whether
the compelling emotion is
love, envy, excitement, or sor
row. Mariana Paunova, sing
ing the role of Laura, followed
this standard to a "tee," occa

sionally punctuating particu
larly nasty lines in the libretto
(which is in Italian) with a
clenched fist, or falling down
in grief. I thank Caballe,
though, for her sensitivity to
the language barrier as she
used gestures not to
punctuate lines, but to em

phasize the protean moods of
her numbers. It was a beauti
ful integration of voice and ac
tion that I suspect only a hand
ful of the best singers have
mastered.
In opera the musical exten
sion of a word or a note is of
ten used to achieve dramatic
emphasis; Caballe used the
same principle in gesture,
bringing dramatic realtime to
a standstill in crystalline mo
ments of pure rage, jealousy
and desperation.
Nevertheless most of
Caballe's numbers came in
the second and fourth acts
where her voice and character
commanded the stage despite
Richard Bradshaw's fine
chorus. Meanwhile, the audi
ence had to squirm through
Barnaba's "evil machinations"
designed to extort the affec
tions of Gioconda in the first
act, and again listen helplessly
as the Count Alvise pondered
the macabre fate he held in
store for the Countess Laura in
the third. Thwarting, in some
respects, both these fiendish
plans was tenor Franco
Bonisolli in the role of Enzo
who, much like Caballe, was
not only vocally superb,
producing showstopping high
C's, but also portrayed the
young lovestruck captain of
the Hecate with conviction
and enthusiasm.
Although his role was last
sung in San Francisco by
Pavarotti in the televised 1979
opening night, Bonisolli
showed no qualms about step
ping into the shoes of one of
America's favorite tenors. In
fact, I think he enjoyed it from
the moment he charged on
stage to quell singlehandedly
the agitated chorus until his
climactic duet with Gioconda
where he came within a hair's
breadth of murdering her. The
crowd sensed his pleasure and
gradually warmed to him.
Though La Gioconda has
substantive tunes early on, the
house was reserved and quite
mum despite the excellent
singing by Matteo Manuguer
ra as Barnaba and Sheila Nad
ler as La Cieca, whose rendi
tion of the "Rosary Theme"
was the dramatic and musical
focus of the first act. It was not
until Bonisolli's admirable
"Gia ti veggo" and his poig
nantly powerful "Cielo e
mar!" in the second act that
the audience responded with
any of the enthusiasm one
might expect at a "singer's
opera." Swinging on the toes
of his boots which had once
belonged to Errol Flynn (and
which he had purchased for

during or after a number.
Yet it was not simply a mat
ter of Bonisolli's energetic
style being well-suited to the
role of Enzo; the part itself
was and is vulnerable to a far
more flamboyant, not to men
tion inappropriate, stylistic

the role), he soared through
his gutsy tunes, finishing each
by kicking back his head and
opening his arms to greet fre
quently a minute or more of
applause. Thanks to him, from
then on through the final two
acts the audience did not
hesitate to applaud any singer

treatment. Rather, Bonisolli
demonstrated a dramatic in
stinct similar to that of
Caballe. Inasmuch as I soon
overlooked Caballe's size and
age (both somewhat
"capacious") in the course of
her performance, it simply did
not occur to me that I was lis
tening to and watching a man
in his late 40s (or thereabouts)
portray a character 20 years his
junior. His dark hair and good
looks contributed to the illu
sion, but Bonisolli's Enzo was
more volatile than wrathful,
more rash than vengeful â€”
those latter characteristics
more descriptive of Verdi's
Otello, an older man with a
similar nature.
The third principal role, that
of Barnaba, did not afford the
same dramatic opportunity to
Matteo Manuguerra, who did
a credible job all the same.
The part is hobbled by circum
stances both within and
outside of the opera, and like

the role of En/o, it can be
made too camp Manuguerra
handled it lightly, however,
perhaps even too lightly in the
first act, and then later risked
more involvement after
Bonisolli brought the Tuesday
night crowd around. Easily
swinging his dark baritone to a
high A flat, Manuguerra com
manded our attention in his
difficult numbers, but never
our loathing as a truly evil spy
to the Inquisition should.
The fault, though, does not
lie with Manuguerra's perfor
mance but with Barnaba him
self. His scheming is impulsive
and to a short-lived end, a
Sancho Panza turned to the
dark side. Furthermore, he
was and always will be
upstaged by his far blacker
successor lago, a role
premiered in Verdi's Otello in
1887, 11 years after La
Gioconda came to the stage.
Arrigo Boito did the libretti for
both and actually added his
own famous "Credo" into the
dialogue of Shakespeare's

already substantially vile crea
tion to make lago a figure of
consumate evil in Verdi's
opera masterpiece. The differ
ence between the two is far
more than degrees of evil.
Whereas Barnaba plotted
clumsily toward an undeniably
evil end, lago had to concoct _
various ends in which he
could find outlet for his black
nature. Barnaba's plans
crumbled horribly at
Gioconda's suicide; only
lago's own death could ever
slow the evil which he
generated.
You might say that in a
medium of extremes such as
opera, Manuguerra did his
best at portraying a marginally
evil character. I thought his
best moment came in the
second act's "Pescadore" and
duet with Enzo where he fi
nally had the chance to show
some dramatic flexibility well
integrated with his good
voice.

Sheila Nadler too, as La
Cieca, performed well in her
limited role. The part has
some good numbers, the
"Rosary Theme" the most well
known, but as Gioconda's
blind mother she spent most
of her time groping frightfully
for her daughter when not in
tow behind Barnaba, who
hoped, oddly, by threatening
her he could gain Gioconda's
affections. Nadler's rich con
tralto has landed her many
matronly roles such as this,
and many have done her tal
ents more justice. She is a fa
vorite at the Met as the witch
in Hansel and Gretel and has
had her greatest success in the
title role of The Grand
Duchess of Gerolstein.
Filling out the principal cast
were Greek bass Dimitri Kav
rakos and Bulgarian contralto
Mariana Paunova, both
making their San Francisco
Opera debut. As the Count
Alvise and wife Laura, the pair
sang masterfully but were so

stiff about it they made
Caballe and Bonisolli shine all
the more. I questioned,
though, Kavrakos's behavior
in the first scene of the third
act where, as he plotted the
death of Laura, he chose to
pace his large, heavily draped

body about a fairly compact
area of the stage at the ex
pense of all props that weren't
bolted down. Learning from
Caballe, he could be as
menacing standing still, pro
vided his dramatic expression
matched his virtuoso singing.
Laura, as well, though love
ly, was inexpressive. Paunova
could rifle her voice through
the acoustically inferior or
chestra seats like the much in
demand concert artist that she
is, while never letting us see
what made her so readily
cuckold the Count in favor of
Enzo. The libretto answers this
in her repentant second act
soliloquy aboard the Hecate
yet her performance conveyed
little to us. As I mentioned, we
scarcely need to look to the
libretto for the details of
Gioconda's character â€”
Caballe laid them all bare. Ex
cept for the soliloquy there is
little told of and little we need
to know about Laura. As a
result, I am more inclined to

see Paunova's performance
more as the upshot of her role
than as a poor reflection of her
abilities. I think much the
same can be said of most of
the opera's weak and
awkward moments.
Ironically, one of the

opera's weakest dramatic ele
ments is also its most remem
bered musical moment;
besides, none could write a
review of La Gioconda without
mentioning the third act's
"Dance of the Hours." For the
1979 televised version, this
piece (which is recognized by
most of us from the hinter
lands as "Hello Mudda, Hello
Fadda") was given the full, al
beit too indulgent, textual
treatment. This time around
Vassili Sulich provided simple,
elegant choreography in
which Sarah Oppenheimer
was a delight to watch. The
two other principal dancers,
Gregory Gonzales and Peter
Childers, are to be com
mended as well.
By in large, this perfor
mance was a credit to the en
ergy of the San Francisco
Opera. From Andrew
Meltzer's tight orchestra to
the fastidious technical work
of Daniel Pyre (really) who
burned the Hecate in all of a

minute and 30 seconds, the
company unfailingly held to its
professional tradition, proving
that despite setbacks often in
trinsic to an opera, it can
transform what would other
wise be an expensive nap into
a very successful production.


OPERATIC INTENSITY: Montserrat Caballe and Franco Bonisolli delivered
sparkling performances in the San Francisco Opera's presentation of

Ponchielli's 'La Gioconda.' Here, La Gioconda (Caballe) resists the evil ad
vances of the sinister Barnaba (Matteo Mauguerra).
