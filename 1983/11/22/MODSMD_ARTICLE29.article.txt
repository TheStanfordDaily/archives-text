# University issues shock hazard warning
## 
### 
The possibility of "a potentially
lethal shock hazard" from Varian
Company leak detectors prompted
the University's Department of
Health and Safety to issue a warning
yesterday to all University depart
ments, advising them to inspect the
faulty devices, according to Jon Mol
destad, health and safety engineer.
Moldestad said Varian warned the
University about its series 936 leak
detectors, which measure escaping
gas and hydrogen. He said a Varian
vacuum detector manufactured in
1978 was found yesterday at the
Electronics Research Laboratory
(ERL) and will be examined today to

determine if it is hazardous.
Moldestad said leak detectors are
a "common type system" and that
the department is "afraid that more
than one exists" at the University.
"Each department runs its own
show," he said, and it is impossible
for Health and Safety to determine
where the devices are installed.
It is probable that the detectors
were traded between departments
and modified to fit existing systems,
Moldestad said.
The Varian leak detectors in the
936 series include models 936-60,
936-65, 936-70 with beginning serial
numbers of V, W, Y, A, B, C, and D.
