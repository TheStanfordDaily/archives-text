### PAM CLOYD Staff writer 
College presidents rated Stanford
"the nation's best major university
for undergraduates" in a survey
published this week in a national
newsmagazine.
The survey, conducted by U.S.
News and World Report, ranked
Harvard second, followed by Vale,
Princeton and UC-Berkeley.

"It would be silly to pay much atten

According to the article, which ap
pears in the Nov. 28 issue of the
magazine, 48.8 percent of the presi
dents named Stanford among the
top five, and 47.6 percent picked
Harvard.
In the article, David Riesman,
emeritus professor of social science
at Harvard, called Stanford "a
meteor in the business," citing "a
combination of excellent leader
ship, attractive climate and campus
and the addition of many respected
faculty members from Eastern col

buting to Stanford's reputation. "It
has risen spectacularly," he said.

Riesman said American colleges and
universities have long been of spe-
