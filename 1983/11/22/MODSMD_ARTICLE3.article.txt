# Survey ranks Stanford first nationwide
## 
### PAM CLOYD Staff writer 
College presidents rated Stanford
"the nation's best major university
for undergraduates" in a survey
published this week in a national
newsmagazine.
The survey, conducted by U.S.
News and World Report, ranked
Harvard second, followed by Vale,
Princeton and UC-Berkeley.
More than 600 presidents
responded to the survey, in which
they were asked to rate "the quality
of academic courses, professors,
student bodies and the general at
mosphere of learning provided."
Each president was asked to select
the top five undergraduate schools
from a list of institutions most
similar to his or her own in terms of
academic degrees and programs of
fered.
University President Donald Ken
nedy said he could not remember
whether he had even received the
survey, and was apparently not im
pressed.

"We don't feel very compli
mented," he told The Daily last
night.
"It's not very meaningful; it's sort
of a beauty contest," Kennedy said.
"It would be silly to pay much atten
tion to it."
According to the article, which ap
pears in the Nov. 28 issue of the
magazine, 48.8 percent of the presi
dents named Stanford among the
top five, and 47.6 percent picked
Harvard.
In the article, David Riesman,
emeritus professor of social science
at Harvard, called Stanford "a
meteor in the business," citing "a
combination of excellent leader
ship, attractive climate and campus
and the addition of many respected
faculty members from Eastern col
leges, including Harvard," as contri
buting to Stanford's reputation. "It
has risen spectacularly," he said.

Stanford in 1968, also said he has
many friends from Stanford, includ
ing former University President
Richard Lyman.

Norman Wessells, dean of
humanities and sciences, had not
seen the article, but called the
results of the survey "wonderful."
Stanford was top-ranked among
"national universities" — one of
five categories created by U.S. News
and World Report.
Other categories included
"national liberal arts colleges,"
"regional liberal arts colleges,"
"comprehensive universities" and
"smaller comprehensive univer
sities."

Among national liberal arts col
leges, Amherst was ranked first over
Swarthmore and Williams, which
tied for second.
UC-Berkeley, which finished fifth
among national universities, was the
nation's to£-ranked public institu
tion. U.S. News and World Report
pointed out that it charges state resi
dents less than $1400 a year,
compared to the fees of more than
$9000 charged at the higher-ranked
private universities.
