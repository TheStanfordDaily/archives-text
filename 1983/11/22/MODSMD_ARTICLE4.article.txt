# Blacks, Chicanos here have mixed reactions to Jackson

The Democratic Party should benefit from the Rev.
Jesse jackson's bid for the presidency by increasing
black involvement in politics, according to several
minority faculty and students here. However, others
believe that Jackson supporters may drop out of
politics if, as most expect, Jackson doesn't win the
Party nomination.
"I think there are two possible reactions to Jesse
Jackson's presidential campaign," said Asst. Political
Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice. "The first is an abso
lute mobilization of the black voter, so that the black
voter will turn out for whatever candidate the Demo
cratic Party comes up with. The second is that Jackson's

supporters could be so tied to Jesse Jackson that when
he doesn't run (in the general election) his supporters
would all leave."
Jackson's announcement that he is running for the
1984 Democratic Presidential nomination has
generated a great deal of excitement and controversy.
Many argue that Jackson's campaign will make the
Democratic Party sensitive to the concerns of black and
minority voters.
But several black politicians, including Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young and Georgia state Sen. Julian Bond, are
supporting Vice President Walter Mondale.
Young and Bond have said blacks would reap more
benefits from supporting Mondale because he has a
better chance of being elected president.

"I'm going to be with the winner," Bond reportedly
said recently.
Assoc. History Prof. Clayborne Carson said Jackson's
campaign will help register many Southern blacks for
the vote.
The campaign also will force the Democratic can
didate for president to address issues that concern
blacks like jobs and civil rights, Carson said.
"Most of the Democratic candidates pay lip service
to blacks," he said. "But when it comes down to ap
pointing a cabinet to make policy, it's usually the same
group of white males."
Carson said he is not sure if the decision by some
black politicians to support Mondale is a good idea.
"Many blacks supported (former President Jimmy)

Carter very early in his 1976 campaign," he said. "I'm
not sure if the payoff they received was proportionate
to the support they gave Carter during the election."
Most of Jackson's supporters will vote for the Demo
cratic candidate in the general election if he responds
to their concerns, Carson said.
"I don't know why the argument about dividing the
Democrats is made with respect to Jackson," he said.
"Any of the other candidates might take their con
stituencies elsewhere."
Jackson will get a lot of votes from people dissatisfied
with the other Democratic candidates, Carson said.
"People have always used the primaries as a way of
sending a message," he said.
