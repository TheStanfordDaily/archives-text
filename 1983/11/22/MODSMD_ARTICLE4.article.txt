# Blacks, Chicanos here have mixed reactions to Jackson

### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The Democratic Party should benefit from the Rev.
Jesse jackson's bid for the presidency by increasing
black involvement in politics, according to several
minority faculty and students here. However, others
believe that Jackson supporters may drop out of
politics if, as most expect, Jackson doesn't win the
Party nomination.
"I think there are two possible reactions to Jesse
Jackson's presidential campaign," said Asst. Political
Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice. "The first is an abso
lute mobilization of the black voter, so that the black
voter will turn out for whatever candidate the Demo
cratic Party comes up with. The second is that Jackson's

supporters could be so tied to Jesse Jackson that when
he doesn't run (in the general election) his supporters
would all leave."
Jackson's announcement that he is running for the
1984 Democratic Presidential nomination has
generated a great deal of excitement and controversy.
Many argue that Jackson's campaign will make the
Democratic Party sensitive to the concerns of black and
minority voters.
But several black politicians, including Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young and Georgia state Sen. Julian Bond, are
supporting Vice President Walter Mondale.
Young and Bond have said blacks would reap more
benefits from supporting Mondale because he has a
better chance of being elected president.

"I'm going to be with the winner," Bond reportedly
said recently.
Assoc. History Prof. Clayborne Carson said Jackson's
campaign will help register many Southern blacks for
the vote.
The campaign also will force the Democratic can
didate for president to address issues that concern
blacks like jobs and civil rights, Carson said.
"Most of the Democratic candidates pay lip service
to blacks," he said. "But when it comes down to ap
pointing a cabinet to make policy, it's usually the same
group of white males."
Carson said he is not sure if the decision by some
black politicians to support Mondale is a good idea.
"Many blacks supported (former President Jimmy)

Carter very early in his 1976 campaign," he said. "I'm
not sure if the payoff they received was proportionate
to the support they gave Carter during the election."
Most of Jackson's supporters will vote for the Demo
cratic candidate in the general election if he responds
to their concerns, Carson said.
"I don't know why the argument about dividing the
Democrats is made with respect to Jackson," he said.
"Any of the other candidates might take their con
stituencies elsewhere."
Jackson will get a lot of votes from people dissatisfied
with the other Democratic candidates, Carson said.
"People have always used the primaries as a way of
sending a message," he said.
Asst. Sociology Prof. Henry
Walker said Jackson's campaign has
symbolic importance.
"I think the fact that Jesse Jackson
probably will not receive the
nomination is less important than
the symbolic effect of him running
for it," Walker said. "One of the
things that we need to get used to in
this country is the idea that black
and women candidates can run for
high office."
Jackson's charisma and oratory
will encourage many minorities to
vote, he said.
Jackson is unique in national
politics because he responds to the
interests of poor and working-class
voters, Walker said.
"It has become increasingly clear
to me that the really disadvantaged
persons are the people who are
least likely to get their issues on the
national agenda," he said. "Part of
Jesse Jackson's justification for run
ning is that there is nobody out
there addressing issues like jobs for
the disadvantaged, health care and
housing."
Because the Democratic and Re
publican parties do not offer strong
views on issues, candidates avoid
taking strong stands that call for the
social reforms the poor need,
Walker said.
Rice argued that Jackson has to
convert the enthusiasm of his sup
porters into political power.
"I don't think you can make an
automatic connection between
Jesse Jackson running and political
benefits," she said. "He has to
transform the excitement and inter
est in his campaign into votes for the
Democratic candidate."
The Democratic candidate for
president will become more
sensitive to minority concerns if
Jackson agrees to support him, Rice
said.
"I think one good thing Jackson's
campaign could provide is to put
civil rights back on the national
agenda," she said.
Ken Archuleta, a black business
school student who is working with
the Jackson campaign, said Jackson
will get more blacks to vote, help
blacks win local elections, make
minority groups feel powerful and
lead other Democratic candidates to
court minority voters.
"Jackson's campaign will influ
ence the whole character of the
election," Archuleta said. "Jackson
will make it legitimate to talk about
the poor, the oppressed and women
as well as to challenge the whole
militarization of the United States."
Jackson's supporters will not
abandon the Democratic Party if he
does not win the nomination, Ar
chuleta said.
They will work hard for a Demo
cratic candidate who agrees with
their stands on the major issues, Ar
chuleta said.
