# University drops therapy program

### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer 
The University's nationally
renowned physical therapy program
will be discontinued effective Aug.
31, 1985 because it does not "fit the
goals and criteria of the Stanford
Medical School," according to
Provost Albert Hastorf.
In memoranda to Dominick Pur
pura, dean of the School of
Medicine, and to John Medeiros,
acting physical therapy director, the
provost said he was accepting the
recommendation of an ad hoc com
mittee that the program be ter
minated. Current applicants will be
informed that no class will be ad
mitted in the fall of 1984.
The 70 students currently enrolled
in the program will be able to finish

Faculty members in physical
therapy will continue their appoint
ments for the duration of their cur
rent terms, Hastorf said. Ultimately,
eight full-time faculty, two part-time
lecturers and four staff members
will be affected.
Hastorf said the fact that less
federal money is being allocated for
medical education has placed the
Medical School in a financial
crunch. With many Medical School
programs competing for limited
space and funding, all programs
must demonstrate a clear relation
ship to the school's core academic
program, Purpura said.

cal therapy students, most of whom

sion to terminate the program, Pur
pura explained that the physical
therapy program does not fit with
the goals of the Medical School as
defined by the school's faculty
directors.
These goals, Purpura said, are to
train medical students and conduct
research in the field of biomedical
and behavioral sciences and to in
corporate these activities in patient
care. The physical therapy program,
he said, does not deal with biomedi
cal and behavioral sciences.
Purpura said that the program is
"great" in relation to other physical
therapy programs nationally, but ac
knowledged that it is "not great in
relation to the Medical School's pro
grams." Because research in the
physical therapy division is not
judged by the same standard as
biomedical research, it is not con
sidered to be of the same quality.
Rehabilitative medicine, he said, is
at a stage of development which is
not acceptable to the directors of
the Medical School.
Building up the physical therapy
program to make it conform to the
Medical School's standards would
require additional funds, and the
directors are not willing to commit
already limited financial resources
to the program, Purpura said.
While many students expressed
the fear that discontinuing a pro

gram of recognized excellence
would be detrimental to the field of
physical therapy nationally and
would contribute to a crisis in health
care as more schools cut their pro
grams, Purpura claimed that "it is
not the medical schools' mission to
maintain the integrity ... of physi
cal therapy programs throughout
their lifetime." Instead, this health
crisis is the responsibility of govern
ment at all levels, he said.
Citing the quality of the physical
therapy program, Hastorf said he
reached his decision to terminate
the program "reluctantly." He said
he had explored suggestions on al
ternative sites for locating the physi
cal therapy program, including the
School of Engineering and the
School of Education. However, nei
ther site was acceptable because the
academic thrust of the two schools
differs from that of the physical
therapy program, he explained.
Hastorf said he discussed with
Lawrence Crowley, vice president
for medical affairs, the alternative of
basing the program in the Stanford
University Hospital. However, he
said it was unacceptable not only
because of the lack of finances and
space for the program but also be
cause the Hospital is not em
powered to grant degrees.
Any compromise that would shift
the actual administration of the pro
gram to the Hospital, yet allow the
University the power to confer
degrees would not be feasible, Has
torf said.
