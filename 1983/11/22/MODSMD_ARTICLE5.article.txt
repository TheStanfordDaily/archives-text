The University's nationally
renowned physical therapy program
will be discontinued effective Aug.
31, 1985 because it does not "fit the
goals and criteria of the Stanford
Medical School," according to
Provost Albert Hastorf.
In memoranda to Dominick Pur
pura, dean of the School of
Medicine, and to John Medeiros,
acting physical therapy director, the
provost said he was accepting the
recommendation of an ad hoc com
mittee that the program be ter
minated. Current applicants will be
informed that no class will be ad
mitted in the fall of 1984.
The 70 students currently enrolled
in the program will be able to finish

Faculty members in physical
therapy will continue their appoint
ments for the duration of their cur
rent terms, Hastorf said. Ultimately,
eight full-time faculty, two part-time
lecturers and four staff members
will be affected.
Hastorf said the fact that less
federal money is being allocated for
medical education has placed the
Medical School in a financial
crunch. With many Medical School
programs competing for limited
space and funding, all programs
must demonstrate a clear relation
ship to the school's core academic
program, Purpura said.
At a meeting last week with physi
cal therapy students, most of whom
are upset and confused by the deci

their program. The last of these will
graduate in 1985.
