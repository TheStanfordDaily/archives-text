Palestinian rebels invade Tripoli
Tripoli, Lebanon — Rebel Palestinian guerrillas
backed by Syrian tanks invaded northern Tripoli yes
terday, routed Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat's backers from several
neighborhoods and pushed to within 1000 yards of
his office.
The rebels, seeking to drive the PLO leader out of
Lebanon, proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire. But
Arafat said he knew nothing about a truce, and that
his fighters were being besieged from land and sea.
Artillery fire and gunbattles went on all day.
'n Beirut, U.S. Middle East envoy Donald
Rumsfeld completed his first Middle East tour, and
state radio said he conferred with President Amin

Gemayel or Lebanon before leaving for Washington.
Rumsfeld made no statement.
He had returned to Beirut late Sunday from talks
with Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul-Halim Khaddam
in Damascus.
There was a report in the Israeli newspaper Maariv
that President Hafez Assad of Syria may have suf
fered a heart attack last week. The state-controlled
Syrian media have said that Assad was operated on
for appendicitis last week.
Firing hundreds of shells and rockets, the dissi
dent Palestinians and Syrians pushed forward from
the refugee camp of Baddawi, just north of Tripoli,
into the northern neighborhoods of Mallouleh, Kub
beh and Bakkar.
They set up mortars and rocket launchers on high
rise buildings 1000 yards from Arafat's headquarters
in the city, the last retreat for his 8000 loyalists in

Lebanon.
West Germans debate deployment
Bonn, West Germany — The West German Parlia
ment began an emotion-charged debate yesterday
on the deployment of U.S. intermediate-range nu
clear missiles as police used water cannons to keep
about 3000 anti-nuclear protesters at bay a few
hundred yards away.
Carrying banners denouncing the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) deployment of U.S.-
made Pershing 2 and cruise missiles and criticizing
the United States and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government, protesters blocked the main north
south road through the capital, snarling traffic and
disrupting public transportation.
Feds won't prosecute White
San Francisco — The justice Department said yes
terday there was "manifestly insufficient" evidence
to prosecute convicted assassin Dan White in
federal charges he violated the civil rights of his vic
tims, Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Har
vey Milk.
Issued less than a week before the fifth anniver
sary of the City Hall shootings, the decision means
White will be paroled from Soledad prison Jan. 6
despite a campaign of letters, petitions and legal
memoranda urging federal prosecution.
White said, "no comment," when told of the
opinion, said Herb Matthews, the prison's public in
formation officer. His lawyer, Douglas Schmidt, was
out of town and could not be reached.

Honduras repels rebels
Tegucigalpa, Honduras—Put to the test of battle
for the first since its 1969 "soccer war" against El Sal
vador, the Honduran armed forces have decimated a
Nicaraguan-backed insurgence against the govern
ment, according to high U.S. and Honduran military
officials.
The previously ill-regarded Honduran army's
three-month campaign against the force of Cuban
trained Honduran insurgents, these military officials
said, may have been the most successful anti
insurgency operation in Central America since the
Guatemalan army wiped out a guerrilla threat in the
late 1960s with the backing of U.S. Green Berets.
A column of 96 Cuban-trained guerrillas was vir
tually destroyed in the engagements in Honduras'
isolated Ulancho province in recent months and of
ficials say that the aborted revolt's overall leader,
Jose Antonio Reyes Mata, was killed.
New AT & T stocks hit market
New York — Stocks were mostly higher yesterday
as shares of the "new" American Telephone and
Telegraph and the seven regional companies to be
created by AT & T's breakup made a dramatic but
orderly debut.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up
17.78 to 1268.79 at the end of trading.
Today's weather
Sunny today with highs in the 50s and winds from
10 to 20 miles per hour. Fair tonight with lows in the
upper 30s and low 40s.

Feds won't prosecute White
San Francisco — The justice Department said yes
terday there was "manifestly insufficient" evidence
to prosecute convicted assassin Dan White in
federal charges he violated the civil rights of his vic
tims, Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Har
vey Milk.
Issued less than a week before the fifth anniver
sary of the City Hall shootings, the decision means
White will be paroled from Soledad prison Jan. 6

memoranda urging federal prosecution.
White said, "no comment," when told of the
opinion, said Herb Matthews, the prison's public in
formation officer. His lawyer, Douglas Schmidt, was
out of town and could not be reached.

Honduras repels rebels
Tegucigalpa, Honduras—Put to the test of battle
for the first since its 1969 "soccer war" against El Sal
vador, the Honduran armed forces have decimated a
Nicaraguan-backed insurgence against the govern
ment, according to high U.S. and Honduran military
officials.

three-month campaign against the force of Cuban
trained Honduran insurgents, these military officials
said, may have been the most successful anti
insurgency operation in Central America since the
Guatemalan army wiped out a guerrilla threat in the
late 1960s with the backing of U.S. Green Berets.
A column of 96 Cuban-trained guerrillas was vir
tually destroyed in the engagements in Honduras'
isolated Ulancho province in recent months and of
ficials say that the aborted revolt's overall leader,
Jose Antonio Reyes Mata, was killed.
