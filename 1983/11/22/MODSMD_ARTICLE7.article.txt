# Grenada medical students try to continue education
## 
### SUSAN PORTER-SHIRLEY 
With the St. George's Univer
sity Medical School campus on
Grenada closed after the U.S. in
vasion of the Caribbean island,
the educations and lives of some
650 aspiring doctors have been
seriously disrupted.
Not knowing when or whether
the school can reopen on
Grenada, officials have been
forced to find temporary accom
modations so students can con
tinue their studies.
Present plans are to relocate
students and faculty to one of
four different locations — two in
New York, one in New Jersey,
and one in Barbados — with the
assignment depending upon
which semester the student is
presently enrolled. But those
plans are only temporary, and
with no U.S. medical school
having offered permanent trans
fer openings to St. George's stu
dents, a permanent solution is
yet to be found.
Officials at the Stanford Medi
cal School say they believe they
have no responsibility to aid the
St. George's students, but two
students from Palo Alto say they
w>sh Stanford would allow them
to at least sit in on classes here.
"Personally I feel empathy
towards the (Grenadian medical)

students, but this must be distin
guished from our responsibility
of maintaining educational stand
ards," said John Steward, assis
tant dean of the Medical School.
Keith Taylor, a Medical School
professor who taught at St.
George's last year for one week
as a visiting professor, said, "The
responsibility of relocation
belongs to the organizations in
volved — St. George's and the
U S. government."
This comes as a disappoint
ment to the two local students,
Kathy Lavicka and Michael
Borshchevsky.
"It would have been nice if we
could have transferred (to Stan

ford), but Stanford doesn't have
any obligation to us," Lavicka
said. Lavicka left for St. Barnabus
Hospital in New Jersey last
Thursday to complete her second
semester of medical school. St.
Barnabus is one of the four
hospitals temporarily lending its
facilities to St. George's.
"It's been tough," Lavicka
said, referring to the upheaval
and interruptions that have
resulted from the invasion, "and
I'm not even sure where the
school will be next year." When
asked if she would return to
Grenada she answered, "If
finishing medical school means


71 would have been
nice if we could have
transferred (to
Stanford) / but
Stanford doesn't have
any obligation to us/
- Kathy Lavicka
going back to Grenada I'll go." She
said she could not imagine that the
school would be re-opened unless it
were safe.
Borshchevsky is not so accepting
of the situation.
"Although the invasion was jus
tified and we really did need to get
out, I can't help feeling politically
used," he said. Borshchevsky would
like to avoid returning to the Carib
bean, but when he tried to talk with
the Medical School about a transfer
option, he said he "couldn't get past
the secretaries."
"I just wanted to enroll temporar
ily. I just wanted to sit in the classes
and get credit, then maybe I could
avoid going back to Grenada,"
Borshchevsky said.

The Medical School has many
reasons for maintaining its strict
transfer policy in this situation, offi
cials there said. "Our most impor
tant obligation is maintaining the in
tegrity of this institution (the Medi
cal School)," Steward said. "The
reputation of a medical institution is
based on the quality of the students
and faculty. But do not misun
derstand us, we're not saying that
the Crenadian medical students
aren't qualified, we're saying we
don't have sufficient information to
assess their qualifications."
Steward said because St. George's
is not accredited by the Liaison
Committee of Medical Education,
which ensures that all accredited
medical schools comply with U.S.
standards, officials would have no
way of judging whether St. George's
educations standards measure up.
From his brief visit to St.

George's, Taylor said he has the im
presson that, "St. George's is a fine
school, one of the best offshore
medical schools. The students are a
highly motivated and fine young
people."
He said he did not know the insti
tution or student body well enough
to know if the students could fit in at
Stanford but did say that "no quality
medical school with a limited enroll
ment can afford to absorb a large
increment of students without
something suffering. It must be
remembered that we (the medical
school) have a responsibility to the
students already here. We must
maintain a proper balance between
students and faculty, and students
and available facilities."
"We don't want to bruise
anyone's feelings," Taylor said,
"but realistically there is nothing we
can do."

I'm not even sure where the
school will be next year." When
asked if she would return to
Grenada she answered, "If
finishing medical school means


71 would have been
nice if we could have
transferred (to
Stanford) / but

- Kathy Lavicka
going back to Grenada I'll go." She
said she could not imagine that the
school would be re-opened unless it
were safe.
Borshchevsky is not so accepting
of the situation.
"Although the invasion was jus
tified and we really did need to get
out, I can't help feeling politically
used," he said. Borshchevsky would
like to avoid returning to the Carib
bean, but when he tried to talk with
the Medical School about a transfer
option, he said he "couldn't get past
the secretaries."
"I just wanted to enroll temporar
ily. I just wanted to sit in the classes
and get credit, then maybe I could
avoid going back to Grenada,"
Borshchevsky said.

The Medical School has many
reasons for maintaining its strict
transfer policy in this situation, offi
cials there said. "Our most impor
tant obligation is maintaining the in
tegrity of this institution (the Medi
cal School)," Steward said. "The
reputation of a medical institution is
based on the quality of the students
and faculty. But do not misun
derstand us, we're not saying that
the Crenadian medical students
aren't qualified, we're saying we
don't have sufficient information to
assess their qualifications."
Steward said because St. George's
is not accredited by the Liaison
Committee of Medical Education,
which ensures that all accredited
medical schools comply with U.S.
standards, officials would have no
way of judging whether St. George's
educations standards measure up.
From his brief visit to St.

George's, Taylor said he has the im
presson that, "St. George's is a fine
school, one of the best offshore
medical schools. The students are a
highly motivated and fine young
people."
He said he did not know the insti
tution or student body well enough
to know if the students could fit in at
Stanford but did say that "no quality
medical school with a limited enroll
ment can afford to absorb a large
increment of students without
something suffering. It must be
remembered that we (the medical
school) have a responsibility to the
students already here. We must
maintain a proper balance between
students and faculty, and students
and available facilities."
"We don't want to bruise
anyone's feelings," Taylor said,
"but realistically there is nothing we
can do."
With the St. George's Univer
sity Medical School campus on
Grenada closed after the U.S. in
vasion of the Caribbean island,
the educations and lives of some
650 aspiring doctors have been
seriously disrupted.
Not knowing when or whether
the school can reopen on
Grenada, officials have been
forced to find temporary accom
modations so students can con
tinue their studies.
Present plans are to relocate
students and faculty to one of
four different locations — two in
New York, one in New Jersey,
and one in Barbados — with the
assignment depending upon
which semester the student is
presently enrolled. But those
plans are only temporary, and
with no U.S. medical school
having offered permanent trans
fer openings to St. George's stu
dents, a permanent solution is
yet to be found.
Officials at the Stanford Medi
cal School say they believe they
have no responsibility to aid the
St. George's students, but two
students from Palo Alto say they
w>sh Stanford would allow them
to at least sit in on classes here.
"Personally I feel empathy
towards the (Grenadian medical)

students, but this must be distin
guished from our responsibility
of maintaining educational stand
ards," said John Steward, assis
tant dean of the Medical School.
Keith Taylor, a Medical School
professor who taught at St.
George's last year for one week
as a visiting professor, said, "The
responsibility of relocation
belongs to the organizations in
volved — St. George's and the
U S. government."
This comes as a disappoint
ment to the two local students,
Kathy Lavicka and Michael
Borshchevsky.
"It would have been nice if we
could have transferred (to Stan

ford), but Stanford doesn't have
any obligation to us," Lavicka
said. Lavicka left for St. Barnabus
Hospital in New Jersey last
Thursday to complete her second
semester of medical school. St.
Barnabus is one of the four
hospitals temporarily lending its
facilities to St. George's.
"It's been tough," Lavicka
said, referring to the upheaval
and interruptions that have
resulted from the invasion, "and
I'm not even sure where the
school will be next year." When
asked if she would return to
Grenada she answered, "If
finishing medical school means


71 would have been

Stanford) / but
