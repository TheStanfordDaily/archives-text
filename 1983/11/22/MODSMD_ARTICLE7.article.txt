# Grenada medical students try to continue education
## 
### SUSAN PORTER-SHIRLEY 
With the St. George's Univer
sity Medical School campus on
Grenada closed after the U.S. in
vasion of the Caribbean island,
the educations and lives of some
650 aspiring doctors have been
seriously disrupted.
Not knowing when or whether
the school can reopen on
Grenada, officials have been
forced to find temporary accom
modations so students can con
tinue their studies.
Present plans are to relocate
students and faculty to one of
four different locations — two in
New York, one in New Jersey,
and one in Barbados — with the
assignment depending upon
which semester the student is
presently enrolled. But those
plans are only temporary, and
with no U.S. medical school
having offered permanent trans
fer openings to St. George's stu
dents, a permanent solution is
yet to be found.
Officials at the Stanford Medi
cal School say they believe they
have no responsibility to aid the
St. George's students, but two
students from Palo Alto say they
w>sh Stanford would allow them
to at least sit in on classes here.
"Personally I feel empathy
towards the (Grenadian medical)

students, but this must be distin
guished from our responsibility
of maintaining educational stand
ards," said John Steward, assis
tant dean of the Medical School.
Keith Taylor, a Medical School
professor who taught at St.
George's last year for one week
as a visiting professor, said, "The
responsibility of relocation
belongs to the organizations in
volved — St. George's and the
U S. government."
This comes as a disappoint
ment to the two local students,
Kathy Lavicka and Michael
Borshchevsky.
"It would have been nice if we
could have transferred (to Stan

ford), but Stanford doesn't have
any obligation to us," Lavicka
said. Lavicka left for St. Barnabus
Hospital in New Jersey last
Thursday to complete her second
semester of medical school. St.
Barnabus is one of the four
hospitals temporarily lending its
facilities to St. George's.
"It's been tough," Lavicka
said, referring to the upheaval
and interruptions that have
resulted from the invasion, "and
I'm not even sure where the
school will be next year." When
asked if she would return to
Grenada she answered, "If
finishing medical school means


71 would have been
nice if we could have
transferred (to
Stanford) / but
Stanford doesn't have
any obligation to us/
