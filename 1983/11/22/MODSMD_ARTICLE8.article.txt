## Doctors use computers as partners 
### DAMON KORONAKOS 
If you've ever taken CS-105 or 106, you
probably yearn for an intelligent comput
er like HAL from 2001 or the WOPR from
War Games. An intelligent computer
seems like a fantastic idea around 2 a.m.
when you're still struggling to make LOTS
understand what you want it to do. You
begin to appreciate that computers are ef
ficient but stupid and mechanical, relying
completely on the reason of human
operators.
Researchers here at Stanford Medical
Center and SUMEX-AIM (Stanford Uni
versity Medical Experimental Computer-
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine) are
reversing the situation. They design com
puter systems that advise and guide their
human operators: physicians attempting
to make diagnoses.
♦ In his recent lecture, Medical Artificial
Intelligence: the Search for a Byte of
Knowledge, Dr. Edward Shortliffe, assis
tant professor of medicine, described the
application of artificial intelligence (or Al)
techniques to medical problems. "Our
goal is to capture the experience and
judgment of an expert clinician inside a
computer," said Shortliffe. "We are
trying to foster a new symbiotic relation
ship between physician and computer,"
to create an electronic medical consultant
with creative judgment, he said.
In his lecture, Shortliffe described Al as
"the study of ideas that enable computers
to do the things that make humans seem
intelligent." Using Al techniques,
Shortliffe and his colleagues teach the
computer to perform exclusively
"human-like" activities, not just unwieldy
calculations.
These programs impart the ability to
reason symbolically (manipulating
abstract symbols rather than numbers
alone), the ability to learn and apply new
knowledge, and the ability to communi
cate and answer questions in the lan
guage of the human operator.

Physicians' expectations for a
computer-based clinical consultation sys
tem dictate the use of Al techniques.
Physicians need more than a passive
storehouse of medical information; they
want a system that can make subjective
medical decisions. They want an "expert"
system that can learn new information au
tomatically when interacting with medical
staff, and apply this knowledge to future
cases.
An ideal system should make in
ferences and create solutions to
therapeutic problems (even when insuffi
cient data is available to rigorously justify
them), display its own understanding and
explain its reasoning. Artificial intelli
gence methods make all this possible.
Physicians, however, do not require
the machine to be right all the time; they
accept that a system which truly emulates
a human being will make mistakes.
The INTERNIST program developed at
the University of Pittsburgh makes com
petent diagnoses in the entire field of in
ternal medicine and neurology. INTER
NIST scans electronic disease "tables"
when making its decisions. Each entry in
the table includes disease symptoms,
pointers to other diseases which often af
flict the patient simultaneously, and other
manifestations of disease.
Each parameter in the disease descrip
tion is assigned a "strength number"
which gives a quantitative estimate of
symptom frequency and probability.
Symptoms are described exactly by a spe
cial encoding scheme. "Abdominal
pain," for example, has eight different
codes corresponding to eight separate
abdominal regions.
INTERNIST proved its competence in a
study conducted at Massachusetts Gen
eral Hospital. It was able to correctly
diagnose 21 out of 43 patients picked ran
domly from the hospital, not quite as well
as the hospital staff. This is an incredible
accomplishment, since each patient

could suffer from a wide variety of
diseases.
The MYCIN and ONCOCIN programs
developed at Stanford take a different ap
proach to diagnosis. They use logical
rules of diagnosis rather than an ad-hoc
numerical scoring system. These "rules"
include information physicians learn
during their medical training, such as
complicated descriptions of bacterial be
havior and enzyme mechanisms.
However, rules also encompass many
things which may seem trivial. The com
puter is painfully unaware of seemingly
obvious definitional rules, such as If the
patient is a male, he cannot be pregnant.
When making decisions people employ
many such unwritten assumptions, which
must be described explicitly to the com
puter.
The MYCIN program helps diagnose
meningitis and related diseases. MYCIN
interrogates the physician when search
ing for a diagnosis but will also answer
questions from the physician. If the
physician challenges the computer's in
quiry with "Why do you ask that?,"
MYCIN explains why its question is im
portant, types out the relevant rules in its
memory, and cites literature references
to justify its train of "thought."
After hearing MYCIN'S diagnosis, the
doctor might ask "How did you decide to
treat for this particular disease?." MYCIN
might reply "The patient's X-rays were
particularly pertinent in making my deci
sion," and would continue to explain its
reasoning.
After reaching a reasonable diagnosis
with the physician, MYCIN asks for more
information about the patient's history,
allergies, and condition. It examines the
patient's entire record to suggest a good
therapy strategy. Although MYCIN deals
with a limited number of diseases, it has
proven itself as competent as the Stan
ford faculty within its specialty.


BUT DOES IT MAKE HOUSE CALLS?: Computers located at
the SUMEX-AIM office of the Medical Center are being

programmed in an experiment that will use computer tech
nology to help doctors diagnose diseases such as diabetes.

when you're still struggling to make LOTS
understand what you want it to do. You
begin to appreciate that computers are ef
ficient but stupid and mechanical, relying
completely on the reason of human
operators.
Researchers here at Stanford Medical
Center and SUMEX-AIM (Stanford Uni
versity Medical Experimental Computer-
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine) are
reversing the situation. They design com
puter systems that advise and guide their
human operators: physicians attempting
to make diagnoses.
♦ In his recent lecture, Medical Artificial
Intelligence: the Search for a Byte of
Knowledge, Dr. Edward Shortliffe, assis
tant professor of medicine, described the
application of artificial intelligence (or Al)
techniques to medical problems. "Our
goal is to capture the experience and
judgment of an expert clinician inside a
computer," said Shortliffe. "We are
trying to foster a new symbiotic relation
ship between physician and computer,"
to create an electronic medical consultant
with creative judgment, he said.
In his lecture, Shortliffe described Al as
"the study of ideas that enable computers
to do the things that make humans seem
intelligent." Using Al techniques,
Shortliffe and his colleagues teach the
computer to perform exclusively
"human-like" activities, not just unwieldy
calculations.
These programs impart the ability to
reason symbolically (manipulating
abstract symbols rather than numbers
alone), the ability to learn and apply new
knowledge, and the ability to communi
cate and answer questions in the lan
guage of the human operator.

Physicians' expectations for a
computer-based clinical consultation sys
tem dictate the use of Al techniques.
Physicians need more than a passive
storehouse of medical information; they
want a system that can make subjective
medical decisions. They want an "expert"
system that can learn new information au
tomatically when interacting with medical
staff, and apply this knowledge to future
cases.
An ideal system should make in
ferences and create solutions to
therapeutic problems (even when insuffi
cient data is available to rigorously justify
them), display its own understanding and
explain its reasoning. Artificial intelli
gence methods make all this possible.
Physicians, however, do not require
the machine to be right all the time; they
accept that a system which truly emulates
a human being will make mistakes.
The INTERNIST program developed at
the University of Pittsburgh makes com
petent diagnoses in the entire field of in
ternal medicine and neurology. INTER
NIST scans electronic disease "tables"
when making its decisions. Each entry in
the table includes disease symptoms,
pointers to other diseases which often af
flict the patient simultaneously, and other
manifestations of disease.
Each parameter in the disease descrip
tion is assigned a "strength number"
which gives a quantitative estimate of
symptom frequency and probability.
Symptoms are described exactly by a spe
cial encoding scheme. "Abdominal
pain," for example, has eight different
codes corresponding to eight separate
abdominal regions.
INTERNIST proved its competence in a
study conducted at Massachusetts Gen
eral Hospital. It was able to correctly
diagnose 21 out of 43 patients picked ran
domly from the hospital, not quite as well
as the hospital staff. This is an incredible
accomplishment, since each patient

could suffer from a wide variety of
diseases.
The MYCIN and ONCOCIN programs
developed at Stanford take a different ap
proach to diagnosis. They use logical
rules of diagnosis rather than an ad-hoc
numerical scoring system. These "rules"
include information physicians learn
during their medical training, such as
complicated descriptions of bacterial be
havior and enzyme mechanisms.
However, rules also encompass many
things which may seem trivial. The com
puter is painfully unaware of seemingly
obvious definitional rules, such as If the
patient is a male, he cannot be pregnant.
When making decisions people employ
many such unwritten assumptions, which
must be described explicitly to the com
puter.
The MYCIN program helps diagnose
meningitis and related diseases. MYCIN
interrogates the physician when search
ing for a diagnosis but will also answer
questions from the physician. If the
physician challenges the computer's in
quiry with "Why do you ask that?,"
MYCIN explains why its question is im
portant, types out the relevant rules in its
memory, and cites literature references
to justify its train of "thought."
After hearing MYCIN'S diagnosis, the
doctor might ask "How did you decide to
treat for this particular disease?." MYCIN
might reply "The patient's X-rays were
particularly pertinent in making my deci
sion," and would continue to explain its
reasoning.
After reaching a reasonable diagnosis
with the physician, MYCIN asks for more
information about the patient's history,
allergies, and condition. It examines the
patient's entire record to suggest a good
therapy strategy. Although MYCIN deals
with a limited number of diseases, it has
proven itself as competent as the Stan
ford faculty within its specialty.


BUT DOES IT MAKE HOUSE CALLS?: Computers located at
the SUMEX-AIM office of the Medical Center are being

programmed in an experiment that will use computer tech
nology to help doctors diagnose diseases such as diabetes.

er like HAL from 2001 or the WOPR from
