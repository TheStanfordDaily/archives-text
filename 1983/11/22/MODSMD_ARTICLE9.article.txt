Man's cultivation of the
earth has done more harm
than good to contemporary
society, according to a
noted botanist.
"The plowshare may well
have destroyed more op
tions for future generations
than the sword." said Wes
Jackson, the founder of the
Land Institute in Salina,
Kansas, in a speech here
last week. Jackson added
that unless agriculture
techniques are soon
changed, "The future is
probably going to be
ravaged soils and nuclear
power ... I don't think we
have a century."
According to Jackson,
most Americans never con
sider that there could be a
problem with the cultiva
tion of our land. "People
think agriculture is green;
green is good; therefore,
there's no problem." he
said. In spite of this, he ex
plained, current problems
with agriculture are the
"number one environmen
tal problem facing the
country."
Calling mankind's adop
tion of cultivation tech
niques, instead of the
hunter-gatherer method of
obtaining food, "one of the
most destructive events in
the history of the earth,"
the botanist described how
"civilization after civiliza
tion goes down the tubes"
because of soil exhaustion,
erosion and irrigation
induced over-salinization
of topsoil.
Jackson had alarming
things to say about this
American agriculture. Ac
cording to conservative es
timates, three billion tons
of topsoil every year are
lost to erosion. Moreover,
U.S. farmlands have been
depleted of one-third of
their soil carbon, increas
ing the need for petroleum
based fertilizers.
This loss of "en
vironmental capital"
through erosion has
created an oil-based
agriculture, according to
Jackson. The Land Institute
attempts to develop an
agriculture that the land
can support indefinitely,
without dependence on
finite resources such as oil.
This technique would be

exportable to all nations,
jackson explained. "We've
just got to involve the Third
World," he said.
The key to land-sup
portable agriculture, ac
cording to Jackson, is a
"paradigm shift.", a
change in the way in which
the U.S. views farming
technique. Currently, Jack
son said, U.S. agricultural
products are seen as per
sonal property, belonging
to the cultivator-farmer. He
contrasted this "industrial
paradigm" with a
"biological paradigm" in
which our crops are consid
ered to be related to their
wild counterparts. In his
work, Jackson emphasizes
the genetic connections of
domesticated plants with
their wild relatives, and
stresses the need to
retrieve beneficial traits
from these wild relatives.
"The agriculture of the
future," he predicted "will
have a vegetative pattern
resembling that of the
prairie."
Jackson showed the audi
ence a series of slides
depicting the Land In
stitute's research on the
development of new strains
suitable for "perennial
polyculture", a system
whereby several types of
plants are grown on the

same field. The Institute
studies strains of grasses
from around the world in
order to develop crop
strains combining the char
acteristics of perennialism
and substantial food yields.
These plants must be capa
ble of replenishing soil
nitrogen in order to be self
sustaining, and be disease
and pest-resistant, as well.
Jackson explained that
current farming methods
rely almost entirely on an
nual crops, which require
plowing and reseeding
each year, contributing
greatly to the problem of
erosion. These crops have
been developed in con
junction with the policy of
applying artificial fertilizer
to the soil. Consequently,
these plants have lost the
ability to replenish the soil
with nutrients. Modern
plants, Jackson said, carry
"wellhead genes," making
it impossible for them to
flourish without petrol
eum-based "chemother
apy."
Individual perennial crop
strains capable of self
fertilization will be
available in about 15 years,
Jackson predicted. Because
these crops will have such
low production costs, he
said, "farmers are wanting
this stuff already."

PLOWSHARES AND PERIL: Botanist Wes Jackson,
founder of the Land Institute, says that land cultivation
will cause disastrous consequences. According to Jack
son, hope for the future lies in developing an agricul
tural system similar to prairie ecology.
