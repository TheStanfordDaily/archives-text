Ou arks,
Gluor>s®
and
Glueballs m
Have glueballs® been
seen? Yes. They are
found at the Stanford
Bookstore and
elsewhere.* The joining
of any two gluons® will
always give rise to an
unambiguous glueball®.
Glueballs® are made up
of different pairs of
gluons® and are
experimentally
distinguishable only by
their color. Glueballs®
can be split by the
weakest of all Forces
found in Nature, i.e., the
sub-adult force or child
force. When a Glueball®
is made to collide head
on with any hard smooth
target surface, it will
deform upon impact and
spread like a pancake; it
will then recover and,
with luck, it may split
into separate gluons®.
Glueballs® have
strangely long lifetimes if
you keep them clean.
Glueballs® are indeed a
find of special
significance. Glueballs®
makes excellent gifts for
those who have
everything.
