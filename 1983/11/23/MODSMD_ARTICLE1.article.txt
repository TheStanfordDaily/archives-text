News analysis

They were covering John Glenn's
campaign stop at San Francisco's
Sheraton Palace Hotel and they
didn't seem to care.
They were covering John-Glenn
the-senator and john-Glenn-the
astronaut, but the man they covered
came off more like John-Glenn-the
dentist.
For a man whose political stake is
based to a large degree on his role
as an honest-to-goodness American
hero, Glenn just doesn't seem to
have much of the heroic quality.
