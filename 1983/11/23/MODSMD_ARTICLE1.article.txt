San Francisco — "Any news
here?" a television newsman asked.
A reporter shook his head.
"I didn't think so," the TV man
said, and walked away to talk to
others.

News analysis

They were covering John Glenn's
campaign stop at San Francisco's
Sheraton Palace Hotel and they
didn't seem to care.
They were covering John-Glenn
the-senator and john-Glenn-the
astronaut, but the man they covered
came off more like John-Glenn-the
dentist.
For a man whose political stake is
based to a large degree on his role
as an honest-to-goodness American
hero, Glenn just doesn't seem to
have much of the heroic quality.
A Glenn campaign volunteer said he was "impressed
but not that impressed" by his first real view of the man
with the Right Stuff.
The volunteer looked disappointed with his can
didate. "After all," he said as Glenn's car pulled away
from the curb, "he could be president."
Others were more impressed. One woman rushed
up to Annie Glenn to welcome her to San Francisco. A
young girl offered the senator a bouquet of roses in
return for his autograph on a paperback copy of "The
Right Stuff."
But for the reporters covering The Man Who Would
Be President, the campaign stop in San Francisco was
just that. )ust another campaign stop. There had been
other ones earlier yesterday in Los Angeles and
Modesto and there would be more today. And the
reporters following Glenn had heard it all before.

They wandered around the room as local reporters
asked the questions that had to be asked. Questions
about Glenn's views on civil rights for homosexuals ("I
do not advocate or promote homosexuality."), his
thoughts on the 20th anniversary of john F. Kennedy's
death ("I looked at him as a friend and I think he
looked at me in the same way.") and, of course, his
feelings about the movie version of "The Right Stuff"
("It's not my movie. I didn't make it and we didn't have
anything to do with it. I do want to see it. I hope it has a
good effect on me, but if it doesn't . . . Reagan made it
through Bedtime for Bonzo.").
And when the local reporters were done, Glenn and
his group walked to their silver sedan parked outside.
The reporters hung close to Glenn — just in case the
unspeakable happened, just in case what happened in
Dallas exactly 20 years ago happened again.
It didn't, and the people from the campaign staff and
the wire services headed for the next stop on the Glenn
campaign trail.
"You going to the dinner tonight?" one reporter
asked another. "Yeah," he said. "I guess."
