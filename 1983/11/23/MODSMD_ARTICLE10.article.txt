## Interdisciplinary program combines science, ethics 
### SHELLY WENTKER Staff writer 
If society cannot afford to
keep everyone who needs a
kidney machine to survive on
one, what is the best way to
decide who gets to use this
resource?
According to Robert
McGinn, professor of industri
al engineering (IE) and Values,
Technology, Science and Soci
ety (VTSS), this problem is an
example of the frequently
recurring "tug of war" be
tween technological and sci
entific developments and
human values â€” which is ex
actly what the VTSS program
prepares undergraduates to
confront, both as citizens and
potential decision-makers.
Prof. James Adams, chair
man of the program, calls the
field "an activity who's time
has come."
As further evidence of the
timeliness of the subject,
Adams reported that the VTSS
program has been awarded a
grant of $400,000 by the Pew
Charitable Trusts for curricu
lum development.
The funds will be available
in January and Adams said
they will be used "to augment
and strengthen core courses"
as well as to create new ones.
While the administration
has not yet decided specifi
cally what courses will be
developed, Adams said that
some will "view technology
and science from more of an
aesthetic consideration" and
others will be "biased toward
a social science look at VTSS
concerns."
Another function of the
money will be to fund the de
velopment of a B.S. program
in VTSS designed for those
students who want to be
"unusually knowledgeable
about the nature of science
and technology but don't
want to do it for a living,"
Adams said.
But not all of the money will
be used by the VTSS program
itself. Adams said that some
will be used "to aid faculty
outside of the program who
are interested in devoting
more attention to the interac
tion of human values, technol

ogy, science and social institu
tions." He added that there
are a lot of faculty members
who teach courses outside the
realm of VTSS that could in
clude science and technology
in the curriculum, but do not
because of a lack of materials.
The VTSS program hopes to
provide the necessary materi
als to those departments.
In 1970, the plans for the
then-called Values, Technolo
gy and Society program were
laid when four professors
from engineering, science and

humanities departments
recognized the need for what
McGinn described as "a new
kind of liberal arts education
that would take into account
the fact that science and tech
nology were impinging upon
traditional liberal arts
courses."
The program came into
formal existence one year
later and was originally de
signed to examine "the inter
play between intellectual, so
cial and material culture and
how that interaction affected
the development of western
culture," McGinn said.
Last year, the word
"science" was added to the
program title in order to ac

knowledge the impossibility
of considering technology
without considering science at
the same time and also to con
form to titles of similar pro
grams at other schools in the
country such as the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology,
the University of Washington
and Penn State.
Here at Stanford, VTSS
maintains a program status
similar to that held by human
biology, rather than a depart
ment status. This means that
faculty must receive appoint-

merits through other depart
ments. Explaining that this is
"the harder way to go around
the University," Adams
defended the program status,
saying that VTSS is by nature
interdisciplinary and should
remain so. If VTSS were con
sidered a department, that
would imply it is a separate
discipline, he added.
Due to the interdisciplinary
nature of the program, VTSS
lists a wide variety of courses.
About half of the classes
originate in VTSS while the
others are cross-listed with de
partments such as philosophy,
lE, sociology and political sci
ence.
There are no graduate level

programs in VTSS yet. "We
don't have the person power
to do it at the moment ....
We're operating at peak
capacity given our resources,"
McGinn explained. However,
he added that there are what
he calls "three different levels
of participation in the pro
gram for undergraduates.
The first of these is the
Western Culture track.
McGinn said this creates "spill
over effects" in that students
enrolled in this program get
interested in the issues ap
proached in VTSS and decide
they want to take more classes
in the program.
For those students who
want a little more, there is the
VTSS honors program. This is
not a major in itself but is in
tended to complement "any
conventional major," accor
ding to McGinn.
Currently, about seven or
eight students are enrolled in
this program and their majors
include such varied disciplines
as electrical engineering, me
chanical engineering, political
science and chemistry. Stu
dents in this program are re
quired to take six various up
per division VTSS courses and
then to write an honors thesis.
In addition to the honors
program, there are also two
individually designed majors,
both which require the sub
mission of a proposal describ
ing the student's planned
course of study to the Individ
ually Designed Majors Com
mittee.
Originally, the only major in
VTSS existed on what McGinn
called an "ad hoc basis." This
meant that students choosing
to major in VTSS had to draw
up a program of study "from
scratch." This option is still
available to students.
In order to give students
"something to work with,"
the Science, Technology and
Society (STS) major was
developed in March 1982,
McGinn said. The STS major
gives students a basic
structure of three areas in
which they must select from
various required courses. The
students then have some

flexiblity to choose the
remaining courses needed to
round out their programs,
depending on their interest.
Specifically, the basis of the
STS program is the VTSS core,
science or engineering depth,
and a thematic concentration
in "some science- or
technology-related field."
McGinn cites as examples the
environment, international
development and the history
of science.
Junior Lisa Smith designed
her own STS major which em
phasizes IE yet also includes
courses in English, art, history
and sociology.

"I love the idea of the liberal
arts major. I was interested in
something that would prepare
me for a marketing or other
business positions and I really
wasn't satisfied with the
(economics) path or the IE
path," she said.
Smith added that she feels
an interdisciplinary approach
is necessary to the complex
problems faced by today's
businesses and VTSS provides
this necessary background. "I
think I'll be just as prepared as
an IE or econ major."
Recent graduates have "a
pretty good track record so
far," McGinn said. Students

have taken varied paths ran
ging from graduate programs
in law or the history of science
to working in the solar energy
industry or communications
technology.
Regardless of the paths they
take, McGinn said that the stu
dents in VTSS have one thing
in common; "They care about
the ethical and social aspects
of their careers," he said.
And they should be, accor
ding to McGinn, who said,
"Ethics and values issues are
connected with science and
technology and I expect that
to continue to be the case."



The program was originally designed to examine 'the interplay
between intellectual, social and material culture and how that
interaction affected the development of western culture/
