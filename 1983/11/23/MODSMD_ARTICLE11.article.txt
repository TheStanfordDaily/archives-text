## The 						Stanford Daily Preserve LAC services 
### 
Students at a first-rate university are often
plagued by the feeling that perfection is more
an expectation than a goal. And when the aca
demic going gets rough, there are few places
that students can turn for more than a shrug of
the shoulders and a "Well, you were smart
enough to get in weren't you?"
Thus it is disturbing that the University
should decide to disperse the administration of
the Learning Assistance Center, a campus
facility which offers solid advice on learning
skills, time management, analysis and basic
composition as well as tutorial services.
University administrators stress that they are
"just removing the administration, not the
services." They propose that the learning skills
classes could be offered through the freshman
program in the English Department; the peer
counseling through the Office of Student Af
fairs and the tutoring services through the Cen
ter 0r Teaching and Learning.
If this arrangement does indeed preserve the
LAC programs as they are today, and if it saves
money, then little objection can be made. But
it seems unlikely that the current services can
be maintained with no centralization at all.
Certainly the programs will not receive the
loving care that they have gotten at the LAC.

The beauty of the LAC system is that it is
indeed a center. Students having trouble, or
those who just want to be more efficient know
they can go to the first floor of Meyer Library
and receive advice on an array of issues. With
learning services scattered around campus,
students are much more likely to get the
runaround. The staff that now runs the LAC
focuses solely on tutorial and organization is
sues. They are trained in these fields. Will the
teaching assistants in the English Department
be as attuned to the problems faced by stu
dents seeking the services of the LAC as the
current staff?
If the University is determined to dismantle
the centralized LAC — and independent of
budgetary considerations — there doesn't
seem to be a strong mandate to do so, it should
at least provide a central directory of tutorial
services. This directory could take the form of a
bulletin board or a switchboard and could be
administered by the Academic Information
Center.
Unless some effort is made to make these
programs easily accessible to students, the
programs will fade away- This would be a
shame because even at a first-rate university,
students need some place to turn for advice.
