# De-Frosting graduation
## 
### 
Frost Amphitheater, with its domineering
trees, tiered grass and pristine setting, is for
many an idyllic and fitting place to top off a
Stanford career.
For others, graduation at Frost is four hours
in a can of sardines.
Despite the aesthetic popularity of Frost,
University officials are thankfully investigating
alternate sites for future commencement activ
ities. The rise in the number of degrees
awarded each June — from 1144 in Frost's
maiden year of 1937 to 4163 last year — has
simply made the amphitheater an impractical
location for the event. Much-coveted tickets
often beg $100 apiece or more in the closing
days before the ceremony; students who wish
to invite more than four guests are forced to
dip into their savings.
Last year 17,000 people were wrenched into a
space designed to hold 10,000. The result was
rather unpleasant: Family and friends — many
of whom travelled thousands of miles for the
ceremony — complained bitterly about the
overcrowding; policy reported minor scuffles
between authorities and guests; safety was
questionable as 4500 extra chairs were
squeezed onto the stepped grass.
University Events and Services is considering
the Oval, the Stanford Stadium and Sunken
Diamond as possible sites for commencement

exercises for this year and the future. Gradua
tion in the Oval seems like a novel — and per
haps even good — idea at first. But the Oval is
flat, and unless bleachers were brought in,
adding considerably to the cost, no one would
be able to see the faculty, the graduates or the
speakers. And there's something slightly im
personal about holding graduation in such an
open area.
Impersonal would be a kind way to charac
terize commencement in the Stadium. With a
capacity of nearly 90,000, each graduate would
need to invite more than 20 of his closest
relatives to fill the place. And the image of that
huge stadium, only one-quarter full, with par
ents watching from the back rows with
binoculars and students waiting for the Band's
halftime show, is somehow not satisfying.
Thus we heartily recommend commence
ment on a baseball field. Sunken Diamond is,
like Frost, somewhat enclosed. Preliminary
plans suggest an elevated stage draped with
flags and backed by the giant eucalyptus trees
that surround sides of the diamond. Officials
say the facility could comfortably seat an esti
mated 20,000 people. And despite the draw
backs — such as inadequate restrooms and
the memories of graduation on home plate
— Sunken Diamond remains the most attrac
tive of all the alternatives.
