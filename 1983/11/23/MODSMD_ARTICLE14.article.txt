## Adding style to the English language 
### 
"The food is supreme, quite supreme," muttered a
Greek friend of mine between mouthfuls of Indian
cuisine at a dinner recently. His lightly accented English
hasn't changed much since the last time I saw him, five
years ago, at our prep school in England. But, accented
or not, his use of the English language is perhaps con
siderably more colorful than that of the average Stan
ford student. After all, how many of your friends use
the adjective "supreme" to such effect (that is if they
use it at all.) As his host that evening, I was charmed,
quite charmed.

If skipping h's makes the French
sound quaint, turning j's into y's
makes Swedes sound more
endearing.

I received a letter from a Swedish woman-friend of
mine not long ago. "Autumn has come to Sweden, and
so has darkness," she declared somewhat pensively.
Now this young woman has been studying English for
some six years; and that is not a long time. Yet the
simplicity and spontaneity of that wonderful sentence
impresses me considerably more than the inflated
prose of my British friends at Oxford and Cambridge.
Of course, the two individuals I have quoted above
are not representative of all those who speak English as
a second language. And I am not suggesting that these
two individuals do not make grammatical errors in their
expression. (Don't we all?) But the point is simply that
foreigners do not always brutalize the English lan
guage; they often add to its richness.
And the same holds true for pronunciation.

I was in France learning French last spring. One of my
French friends at the University of Lyon was learning
English. I recall, on one occasion, her describing in En
glish a scene from a demonstration held the day
before. The French students at the time were protest
ing against President Mitterrand's educational reforms.
A member of the riot-police had struck one of her
friends on the head. After reconstructing the scene of
the demonstration for me, she continued with consi
derable intensity to the climax of her story. And then,
said she, " 'e 'it 'im on the 'ead."
I was too busy enjoying the story to correct her
pronunciation. After all, she had skipped her h's. But,
on reflection, I decided that in skipping her h's, she
had made her line more effective, more quaint. She
had, no doubt, skipped the h's out of the habit and not
for effect. But frankly I think that the French, on such
occasions, should be permitted to add an element of
quaintness to the English language without being
reprimanded.
While the French often appear to have trouble with
their h's, Swedes tend to have trouble with their j's. If
skipping h's makes the French sound quaint, turning j's
into y's makes Swedes more endearing. "You can come
to visit me in the months of Yune and Yuly next year,"
and "Then we got stuck in a traffic yam." I suppose
these are fairly standard examples of Swedish English.
Other nationalities do other things to the language
that aren't brutal. Far-Easterners often put a great deal
of sing-and-song into their speech. Arabs and Indians
often add a kind of drum beat to their pronunciation of
the letters t and d.
At any rate, very little of what foreigners do to ihe En
glish language is brutal; none of it malevolent and a
great deal of it is colorful and endearing.
