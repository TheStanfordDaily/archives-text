It is now the day after the day after
the day after "The Day After." I
think it's safe to say that everybody
in America watched it, except for a
few brave non-conformists who
played video games instead.
The people who did view this pro
gram were left with a horrified revul
sion to nuclear war, and a strange

urge to buy K-Tel records. The
damage to America's musical taste
may fade, but is this a healthy atti
tude to have about atomic weapons?
Some say not. Some say that the
picture painted was too grim, too
m negative, and might lead people to
do silly things like wrapping their
heads in Saran wrap or voting Dem
ocratic. Their view is that a more
balanced approach, featuring both
the pros and the cons of nuclear war
would have better served the public
interest.
In view of The Daily's commit
ment to balanced coverage and
equal representation, I'd like to
present my version of what such a
program might have been like.
It's entitled, "Have A Nice Day
After."
The movie begins with a kindly
doctor talking to his pretty young
daughter in a museum. They are
looking at a huge poster of a drool
ing Josef Stalin with the word "We
Will Bury You," written in huge red
letters.
"Dad," she says, "I'm moving to
Boston."

The doctor seems pleased. "I hear
they've got some swell fallout shel
ters in Boston."
The scene shifts to college stu
dents watching television. The
newscaster announces that West
Germany has been invaded, London
is a radioactive ruin, and aliens from
Mars are killing and eating people.
"Turn it to Family Feud," one stu
dent suggests.
In an attempt to stem rising ten
sions, the President agrees with the
Soviets to a bilateral nuclear freeze.
Taking this to be a sign of weakness,
the Soviets launch a full-scale nu
clear attack.
A nuclear war is then shown,
courtesy of George Lucas. Missiles
rocket into the air. It looks pretty
scary — but luckily, we have space
based defense systems. Almost all
the incoming warheads are
vaporized! Only 400 or 500 survive
to do superficial damage.
Slums are cleared. Unemploy
ment ceases to be a problem. Sud
denly there are enough natural re
sources for everybody. EPA officials
breathe a sigh of relief as it seems
the greenhouse effect won't melt
the icecaps, after all.
We see a rugged farmer and his
family "roughing it" in the base
ment. "You know,"he says,"I think
living in the cellar these past six
months has brought us closer to
gether."
)ust then his adorable son runs
down the steps. "Mommy! Mom
my!" he shouts. "Come look at the
cool thing Rover mutated into!"
Meanwhile, at a nearby university,
a famous scientist reassures sur
vivors. "Don't worry, fallout is
merely a slight residue that can be
washed off of fruits, vegetables and
dead farm animals."
A former spokesman for the
former government of the former
country agrees. "All in all, I'm pretty
pleased with the way everything
turned out. My only regret is that we
didn't have enough shovels — then

everyone could have made it."
The scores are tallied up. We win.
The Russians grumble, but they are
sporting about the whole thing.
"Just wait until next year," they say.
But wait! It's not over. Mr. Shultz,
what did you think?
"Nuclear war is bad, that's for
sure."
But how can we avoid nuclear
war? What do you say distinguished
panel?
"More missiles."
"Billions and billions of missiles."
"I disagree. More missiles, cer
tainly, but also larger and scarier
ones. Only that way can we achieve
true deterrence."
And you, Mr. Buckley, how do
you think we can avoid nuclear war?
"Avoid it. Why should we avoid
it?"

ment to balanced coverage and
equal representation, I'd like to
present my version of what such a
program might have been like.
It's entitled, "Have A Nice Day
After."
The movie begins with a kindly
doctor talking to his pretty young
daughter in a museum. They are
looking at a huge poster of a drool
ing Josef Stalin with the word "We
Will Bury You," written in huge red
letters.
"Dad," she says, "I'm moving to
Boston."

The doctor seems pleased. "I hear
they've got some swell fallout shel
ters in Boston."
The scene shifts to college stu
dents watching television. The
newscaster announces that West
Germany has been invaded, London
is a radioactive ruin, and aliens from
Mars are killing and eating people.
"Turn it to Family Feud," one stu
dent suggests.
In an attempt to stem rising ten
sions, the President agrees with the
Soviets to a bilateral nuclear freeze.
Taking this to be a sign of weakness,
the Soviets launch a full-scale nu
clear attack.
A nuclear war is then shown,
courtesy of George Lucas. Missiles
rocket into the air. It looks pretty
scary — but luckily, we have space
based defense systems. Almost all
the incoming warheads are
vaporized! Only 400 or 500 survive
to do superficial damage.
Slums are cleared. Unemploy
ment ceases to be a problem. Sud
denly there are enough natural re
sources for everybody. EPA officials
breathe a sigh of relief as it seems
the greenhouse effect won't melt
the icecaps, after all.
We see a rugged farmer and his
family "roughing it" in the base
ment. "You know,"he says,"I think
living in the cellar these past six
months has brought us closer to
gether."
)ust then his adorable son runs
down the steps. "Mommy! Mom
my!" he shouts. "Come look at the
cool thing Rover mutated into!"
Meanwhile, at a nearby university,
a famous scientist reassures sur
vivors. "Don't worry, fallout is
merely a slight residue that can be
washed off of fruits, vegetables and
dead farm animals."
A former spokesman for the
former government of the former
country agrees. "All in all, I'm pretty
pleased with the way everything
turned out. My only regret is that we
didn't have enough shovels — then

everyone could have made it."
The scores are tallied up. We win.
The Russians grumble, but they are
sporting about the whole thing.
"Just wait until next year," they say.
But wait! It's not over. Mr. Shultz,
what did you think?
"Nuclear war is bad, that's for
sure."
But how can we avoid nuclear
war? What do you say distinguished
panel?
"More missiles."
"Billions and billions of missiles."
"I disagree. More missiles, cer
tainly, but also larger and scarier
ones. Only that way can we achieve
true deterrence."
And you, Mr. Buckley, how do
you think we can avoid nuclear war?
"Avoid it. Why should we avoid
it?"
