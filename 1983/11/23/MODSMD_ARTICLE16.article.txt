## LSJUMB and alumni 
### 
A few weekends ago, I had an
experience with some Stanford
alumni that, had it happened
before I came to Stanford, would
have prevented me from coming to
Stanford at all. It makes me wonder
if I ever want to join any of these
alumni groups or even associate
with them.
I'm a member of the LSJUMB,
and while we were down in Los
Angeles for the USC football game
the Cardinal Club asked us to come
and play for their auction. They
offered to pay us a fair amount of
money for the rally. The Band
agreed and so we rode on buses for
40 minutes after an already 12-hour
long day of traveling, practicing
and rallying. When we arrived at
the Cardinal Club rally, we were left
sitting on the buses for an addi
tional 40 minutes because, I was
told, the person in charge of
dealing with us was late.
We were finally allowed in and
the Cardinal Club had provided
food for us. It was 40 minutes after
we were supposed to have started
playing and there was no one there.
Another half hour later but still
before people started to arrive, we
were told to get our instruments

and play. I believe the idea was that
we were supposed to greet the
alumni with music.
We were milling near the en
trance and getting ready to play
when suddenly this woman was
running around yelling that she'd
donate $100 to our next party if only
we'd move outside. She repeated
this several times rather loudly and
also said she was sick of trying to
deal with our manager. Presumably,
she found trying to bribe the Band
a better solution (than trying to
"deal" with our manager).
So the Band went out in the
parking lot where we were sent.
Then they moved us near the gate,
but we were disturbing the horses
so they put us back in the parking
lot where we were in the way of
cars trying to park. Meanwhile,
back inside, there was another
band playing over a loud system.
We played for awhile because we
were getting paid for it but finally
we got fed up and left.
I'm not sure I really understand
what went on. Why did they invite
us if they didn't want us? I would
not like to believe that the Cardinal
Club invited us there to humiliate
us, but that sure is what playing in
the parking lot felt like.
