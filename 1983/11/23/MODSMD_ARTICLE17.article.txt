# Women's softball
## 
### 
I was proud to read that Stanford
women's athletics was named the
top collegiate women's athletic
program. But I was disappointed to
read of the 10 most popular Divi
sion I women's sports, softball is
the only one at Stanford which is
not varsity.
There is a highly competitive club
softball team at Stanford. The club
team, which until a few years ago
competed in the Nor-Cal league,
had to leave Nor-Cal (in accordance
with University regulations) when
Stanford switched to the WCAA.
Stanford and USC are the only two
women's softball teams in the
WCAA that are not funded as a
varsity sport by their respective
schools. With this lack of funding,
the Stanford team cannot travel to
many southern schools to play.
Some 30 students at Stanford
expressed interest in playing on the
team during registration. These
women are conditioning and
weight-training in preparation for
the 1984 season. If Stanford's wo
men's softball teams were to
become a varsity sport, I am confi
dent that it could live up the fine
reputation Stanford women's ath
letics has.
