# Toward your health: Jack Martin
## Two all-beef patties, special sauce ... and vitamins

Two all beef patties, special
sauce, lettuce, cheese,
pickles, onions on a sesame
seed bun.
That, of course, describes a
Big Mac, the essence of junk
food. But is junk food really
junk â€” and is it harmful to
your health? The answer, you
may be surprised to know, is
not always.
Let's take a common situa
tion at Stanford. You have a
paper due tomorrow and have
been working on it all after
noon in the library. Rather
than take the time to go back
to the dorm for dinner, you go
over to the Corner Pocket in
Tresidder for a piece of pizza
and some frozen yogurt. How
nutritious is this meal?
Depending on the toppings,
of course, the pizza can vary
greatly in nutritional value. A
piece with salami, pepperoni,
or sausage will be quite high
in fat. On the other hand, a
piece with mushrooms, pep
pers and onions can provide a
variety of nutrients. In fact,
one-eighth of a 16-inch pizza

with mozzarella cheese,
tomato sauce and these
vegetables contains approxi
mately 250 calories.

Mozzarella cheese is espe
cially good because it is low in
fat, yet a 2-ounce serving con
tains 425 milligrams of calcium
which is about one-half the
recommended daily allowance
(RDA.) This intake is particu
larly important since many
adults do not get enough cal
cium in their diets. The cheese
also provides 16 grams of
protein, which is about one
third the RDA. It also contains
15 percent of the RDA of vita
min A and riboflavin and 3 per
cent of the RDA for iron.

The sauce, made with
tomatoes and vegetable oil,
provides additional nutrients.
Tomatoes are a good source of

The key is to avoid foods which are
high in fat and sugar, thereby provid
ing lots of calories and relatively few
vitamins and minerals/

vitamins A and C. They also
provide some iron and B
vitamins. The oil contains
linoleic acid, the only essential
fat in the human diet. Mush
rooms contain almost as much
protein as carbohydrate. They
are a particularly good source of
niacin. Onions are a fairly
good source of iron and vita
min C. Peppers are an excel
lent source of of vitamin C and
a good source of iron.
The crust, since it is made
from white flour, is not a par
ticularly good source of

nutrients. A crust made with
whole grains could be a good
source of both nutrients and
dietary fiber. As you can see
from this description, pizza
can be a treasure trove of
nutrition!
An 8-ounce (medium) ser
ving of frozen yogurt contains
about 300 calories. Approxi
mately 70 percent of these
calories are from simple
sugars, primarily fructose and
honey. About 10 percent of
the calories are from protein
in the form of skim milk,
cream, and non-fat milk
solids. This leaves some 20
percent as fat, mainly from the
cream.

The ratio of saturated fat is
about 2-to-1. This ratio is to be
expected since the fat comes
from an animal source. An
ideal ratio would be closer to
1 -to-1. Frozen yogurt also con
tains thickening agents and
emulsifiers (products which
help one substance to be dis
persed throughout another)
such as guar seed gum, lecit
hin and pectin. Finally, it con
tains three bacteria: Bul
garicus, thermophilus and
acidophilus. The 8-ounce ser
ving will provide about 300
milligrams of calcium (37 per
cent of the RDA). It also con
tains a small amount of vita
min A and some B vitamins. It

has very little iron or vitamin
C.
By contrast, an 8-ounce
serving of ice cream has about
the same number of calories.
Ice cream has less protein and
more fat with the same 2-to-1
ratio of saturated to un
saturated fat. Yogurt, by com
parison, has more sugar. Ice
cream has less calcium, a little
more vitamin A, slightly lower
amounts of B vitamins, and
equally low levels of iron and
vitamin C. In sum, frozen yo
gurt is nutritionally better than
ice cream, but it hardly
qualifies as a truly healthful
food.
Some fast foods, then, can

provide adequate nutrition.
The key is to avoid foods
which are high in fat and
sugar, thereby providing lots
of calories and relatively few
vitamins and minerals. Look
for variety in fast foods and try
to include fruits and
vegetables where possible.
Will an occasional trip to
McDonald's or Kentucky Fried
Chicken harm your health?
Probably not. But when foods
high in fats, sugar and calories
become your standard diet,
then you are putting yourself
at risk for obesity, heart
disease, stroke, cancer and a
number of other nutritionally
related diseases.
