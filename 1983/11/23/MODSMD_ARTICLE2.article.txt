San Francisco— Economic recovery does not help the
millions of Americans who have been "pushed into
poverty and hunger by the miracle of Reaganomics,"
former astronaut and presidential hopeful Sen. John
Glenn (D-Ohio) told about 700 people at the Sheraton
Palace Hotel in San Francisco last night.
"Although the economy appears to be getting better,
the deficit threat is getting worse — much worse,"
Glenn said in a speech sponsored by the California
Commonwealth Club."I think we should start paying
our bills today instead of charging them to our children
and grandchildren."
President Reagan's "unwillingness to face economic
reality" has nearly doubled the national debt and could
keep interest rates high for years to come, Glenn said.
The senator added that Reaganomics has reduced infla
tion, but at a "staggering human cost."
"We never had any doubt we could lower inflation
by putting people out of work," he said.
Glenn also assailed the "extremely costly economic
approaches" proposed by former Vice President Wal
ter Mondale, another Democratic presidential con
tender. If executed according to plan, Mondale's eco
nomic package would cost between $90 and $170 bil
lion, Glenn said.
Because "the American people know that a can
didate who promises everything to everybody" cannot
balance the budget, Glenn criticized Mondale's plan to

increase spending without raising taxes.
Glenn said his own economic package combines
controlled spending with an increase in taxes, specifi
cally a 10 percent progressive surtax on personal and
corporate income and a delay in indexing taxes.
The controlled spending approach includes about a
$12 billion reduction in the defense
budget — including plans to scrap the MX missile and
the division air defense system, Glenn said. The
senator sardonically described the Rapid Deployment
Force as a "a bargain" — except "that it's not rapid,
it's not deployable and it's not a force."
But he warned against Mondale's call for more
reductions in military expenditures. "I've never been
one who advocates a meat axe for cutting defense
spending," Glenn said, adding that he would "not rule
out the possibility of universal military service for the
long run."
Commenting on ABC's "The Day After," a television
docu-drama depicting a nuclear strike in Kansas, Glenn
said, "I didn't need another T V program to show me
that nuclear war would be very bad. I've seen the
devastation of war first hand."
Glenn pointed to his efforts in the Senate aimed at
reducing nuclear proliferation worldwide and outlined
a nuclear policy that he said provides "for the survival
of the human race," leaving open the possibility of "a
truly mutual and verifiable freeze."

WHAT STUFF?: Candidate john Glenn's speech last night ranged from
Reaganomics to defense to homosexuality to 'The Right Stuff.' Although
Glenn succeeded in attacking Reagan and Mondale, he failed to excite
all of the 700 present.
