# Language requirement has people talking
## 
### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
A year after its inception,
the University's foreign lan
guage requirement has caused
enrollment in foreign lan
guage classes to swell, affect
ing not only the students
but also the language depart
ments.
The Spanish Department
has experienced a 30 percent
increase in enrollment in its
first-year classes and has
added two new sections, said
Maria-Paz Haro, senior lectur
er and director of the Under
graduate Language Program in
Spanish and Portuguese.
The department has also
had to solicit graduate stu
dents to help it cope with
the increased number of stu
dents.
"We have managed with the
task force of our department
and not had to hire extras,"
Haro said.
If enrollment continues to
increase as she expects,
however, some additional,
permanent positions will
become necessary.
In the Department of French
and Italian, enrollment has in
creased 4 percent in French I
and 15 percent in Italian I. The
department finds itself faced
with many problems similar to
those faced by the Spanish
and Portuguese Department,
according to professors.
"This year, we have had a
hefty increase," French and
Italian Department Chairman

Alphonse J u i I land com
mented. "We have what we
call 'pinch hitters,' who are
highly qualified people, some
of whom hold doctorates, and

who are hired on a course
basis."
As in the Spanish Depart
ment, the preference would
be to set up another per

manent teaching position, but
luilland said this would be
very difficult to do at present.
While the extra students will
mean larger classes, both de

partments hope that class
sizes will remain at about '0
students.
Some faculty members >ri
the German Department,
which has seen a 50 percent
increase in enrollment in ts
first-year class, are not content
with the results of the currt ri
requirement.
"There should be a pr
ficiency test in addition o
the current requirement
which would require that stu
dents show a certain level of
proficiency," German Prot
Walter Lohnes said.
Haro sees that same trend in
her department. "Many stu
dents who have had two to
three years of Spanish are
placed in Spanish 2 and realize
that high school is really dit
ferent from college. In the
near future, I see us going
toward proficiency instead ot
a requirement based on
classes taken."
Despite the shortcomings of
the present requirement, fac
ulty members praised it as i
highly significant and essential
step towards a complete un
dergraduate career.
"In principle, students do
not want to be required. My
feeling is that Stanford has a
certain concept of what a
good education is and that in
cludes certain requirements.
Language is an indispensible
part of a Stanford undergradu
ate education." J u i I land said.
