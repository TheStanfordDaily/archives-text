## Quarterback Paye plans to play basketball Card men's hoop season to open Saturday 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
College students in Hawaii actually do
more than surf, lie on the beach and go to
classes occasionally. Some of them plav
basketball.
So those who think that the Hawaii-
Pacific basketball team, which plays Stan
ford Saturday afternoon in the Cardinal's
season opener, consists of barefoot
Hawaiians in bathing suits are in for a big
surprise.
Although the Hawaii-Pacific Sea Warriors
have defeated j ust one Division I school in
basketball (Eastern Illinois, 82-75, last
season), the National Association of Inter
collegiate Athletics (NAIA) members are by
no means patsies.
The Sea Warriors, who are based in
Honolulu, are already 4-0 this season and if
they beat their next three opponents as ex
pected, they will be 7-0 when they walk into
Maples Pavilion to face Stanford Saturday at
3 p.m. It will be the first-ever meeting be
tween the two teams.
'I think they're a decent ball club," said
Stanford Head Coach Tom Davis, "and they
might be better than that."
Davis, in his second year at Stanford after
coming from Boston College, is hoping to
improve on the Cardinal's 14-14 record of a
year ago — its first non-losing season in 10
years — and its eighth-place finish in the
Pacific-10 Conference.
Stanford downed the Japan National
team, 91-77, in an exhibition game Nov. 3,
its only action this season.
Davis also announced that freshman )ohn
Paye, Stanford's starting quarterback on the
football team, attended practice Monday
and is planning to play basketball this
season. Last year, the 6-foot-3 Paye led
Menlo School to a 32-3 record and the Cali
fornia Division II basketball title.
Two other football players — junior
receiver Emile Harry and junior defensive
back Darrell Crissum — are also planning
to play for Davis this season. The 5-11 Harry
and the 6-2 Crissum were both on the Stan
ford team that traveled to Japan last june for
the Kirin World (Basketball) Games. Need
less to say, none of the three are expected
to play Saturday against Hawaii-Pacific,
since the football season ended only four
days ago.
After the Sea Warriors, Davis and compa
ny host Bemidgi (Minn.) State Monday
night at 7:30 p.m., their last prepping for
the Hewlett Packard/Stanford Invitational
Friday and Saturday, Dec. 2 and 3. One of
the four teams in the tournament is North
Carolina, the 1982 NCAA champions who
were ranked No. 1 this year in the Associ

ated Press' pre-season college basketball
poll.
Though Hawaii-Pacific is a far cry from
the top-ranked Tar Heels, Davis said the
Card is not looking past them to the tourna
ment.

Tom Davis
"We're not the type of team that worries
about our opponents too much,' Davis
said. "We worry about our own team."
Hawaii-Pacific, which went 15-1" last
season, has defeated Hawaii-Loa twice, 90-
74 and 89-69, as well as Cal State-Hayward
61-59 and Oregon Tech 86-70 to win the
Herald/News Invitational tournament at
Klamath Falls, Ore., last weekend.
"The other positive thing (about Hawaii-
Pacific) is that they've got some games un
der their belt which helps in getting experi
ence this early in the season, Davis said.
"So I expect them to give us a good game."
Stanford is led by All-America candi
dates John Revelli, a 6-8 senior center, and
Keith Jones, a 6-1 senior guard. Both were
honorable mention Ail-Americans last
season, Revelli by The Sporting News and
Jones by the AP.
Revelli averaged 19.1 points and 7.8
points per game last year before donning
street clothes for most of the Pacific-10
Conference season with a knee injury. The
senior from Scarsdale, N.Y., however, has
fully recovered from the injury evidenced
b\ his 17 points and 14 rebounds against
Japan.
The explosive Jones tallied 23 points, in
cluding 17 in the first halt, in the same
game. He is expected to provide most of
Stanford's outside scoring punch while
Revelli will be counted on as an inside
threat.
Besides Jones at guard and Revelli at cen

ter, Davis said he plans to start 6-0 sopho
more Keith Ramee at the other guard and 6-
9 senior Hans Wich.irv at one forward.
Either b-4 sophomore *\ndy Fischer or 6-2
lunior Steve Brown vmII get the call at the
other forward spot, according to Davis.

But as the Stanford coach substitutes of
ten in an eftort to keep fresh players in the
game, as many as eight or nine players see
considerable action.
Other Cardinal hoopsters expected to
play Saturday are b-2 senior guard Ricky

Lewis, 6-6 sophomore toward Earl Kober
lein and 6-1 freshman guard Novian Whit
sitt.
Davis said that Whitsitt, who averaged 28
points a game last vear tor San Pedro High,
is the only one of his three freshman
recruits that most likely will play. The other
freshmen are 6-7 center Grady lohnson
from Atlanta, Ga., and 6-6 forward Doug
Wall from Grass Valley.
Hawaii-Pacific, which matches up evenly
with the small-for-the-Pac-10 Cardinal, is
paced by Rick Wozeniak, a 6-0 senior
guard. Wozeniak is averaging 22 points a
game so far this season, an improvement
over his 20.4 average last year. He also
holds the school record for most points
scored in a game at 38.
Other Sea Warriors that have played a
role in their early-season success are 6-0
junior Patrick Davis, 6-8 sophomore Charles
Garcia, 6-7 Greg Sparks, 6-5 Toron
Hightower, 6-5 Don Browne and 6-6 Eric
Gable. Coach Dan McFadden, a 1960
graduate of Yale, is in his tirst season with
Hawaii-Pacific.
The Sea Warriors played UC-Berkeley last
year and lost 99-73 although they led with
five minutes left in the first half. Hawaii-
Pacific scored probably its biggest upset last
season when it handed Chaminade (of Hile,
Hawaii) its first loss since defeating then-
No. 1 ranked Virginia.
The loser of Saturday afternoon's game
will have a chance for revenge when Stan
ford travels to the Sea Warriors' home floor
in Honolulu Dec. 22 as part of its seven-day,
three-game trip to the Islands over
Christmas.
Hoop notes
Davis also said that as of yesterday less
than 240 season tickets remain for the 1983-
84 Stanford basketball campaign in the
7457-seat Maples Pavilion. However, he did
mention that general admission tickets will
be available on a game-day basis for certain
games.
Charles Hunt the 6-4 junior forward who
started and scored 13 points against lapan,
recently recovered from an ankle injury he
sustained in the game and is now listed
third behind Brown and Fischer at the small
forward spot.
Speaking of Brown and Fischer, who both
sat out the Japan contest with injuries,
Davis said the two are now fine. Brown had
a sprained ankle and Fischer a broken bone
in his left hand.

Stanford Head Coach Tom Davis, "and they
might be better than that."
Davis, in his second year at Stanford after
coming from Boston College, is hoping to
improve on the Cardinal's 14-14 record of a
year ago — its first non-losing season in 10
years — and its eighth-place finish in the
Pacific-10 Conference.
Stanford downed the Japan National
team, 91-77, in an exhibition game Nov. 3,
its only action this season.
Davis also announced that freshman )ohn
Paye, Stanford's starting quarterback on the
football team, attended practice Monday
and is planning to play basketball this
season. Last year, the 6-foot-3 Paye led
Menlo School to a 32-3 record and the Cali
fornia Division II basketball title.
Two other football players — junior
receiver Emile Harry and junior defensive
back Darrell Crissum — are also planning
to play for Davis this season. The 5-11 Harry
and the 6-2 Crissum were both on the Stan
ford team that traveled to Japan last june for
the Kirin World (Basketball) Games. Need
less to say, none of the three are expected
to play Saturday against Hawaii-Pacific,
since the football season ended only four
days ago.
After the Sea Warriors, Davis and compa
ny host Bemidgi (Minn.) State Monday
night at 7:30 p.m., their last prepping for
the Hewlett Packard/Stanford Invitational
Friday and Saturday, Dec. 2 and 3. One of
the four teams in the tournament is North
Carolina, the 1982 NCAA champions who
were ranked No. 1 this year in the Associ

ated Press' pre-season college basketball
poll.
Though Hawaii-Pacific is a far cry from
the top-ranked Tar Heels, Davis said the
Card is not looking past them to the tourna
ment.

Tom Davis
"We're not the type of team that worries
about our opponents too much,' Davis
said. "We worry about our own team."
Hawaii-Pacific, which went 15-1" last
season, has defeated Hawaii-Loa twice, 90-
74 and 89-69, as well as Cal State-Hayward
61-59 and Oregon Tech 86-70 to win the
Herald/News Invitational tournament at
Klamath Falls, Ore., last weekend.
"The other positive thing (about Hawaii-
Pacific) is that they've got some games un
der their belt which helps in getting experi
ence this early in the season, Davis said.
"So I expect them to give us a good game."
Stanford is led by All-America candi
dates John Revelli, a 6-8 senior center, and
Keith Jones, a 6-1 senior guard. Both were
honorable mention Ail-Americans last
season, Revelli by The Sporting News and
Jones by the AP.
Revelli averaged 19.1 points and 7.8
points per game last year before donning
street clothes for most of the Pacific-10
Conference season with a knee injury. The
senior from Scarsdale, N.Y., however, has
fully recovered from the injury evidenced
b\ his 17 points and 14 rebounds against
Japan.
The explosive Jones tallied 23 points, in
cluding 17 in the first halt, in the same
game. He is expected to provide most of
Stanford's outside scoring punch while
Revelli will be counted on as an inside
threat.
Besides Jones at guard and Revelli at cen

ter, Davis said he plans to start 6-0 sopho
more Keith Ramee at the other guard and 6-
9 senior Hans Wich.irv at one forward.
Either b-4 sophomore *\ndy Fischer or 6-2
lunior Steve Brown vmII get the call at the
other forward spot, according to Davis.

But as the Stanford coach substitutes of
ten in an eftort to keep fresh players in the
game, as many as eight or nine players see
considerable action.
Other Cardinal hoopsters expected to
play Saturday are b-2 senior guard Ricky

Lewis, 6-6 sophomore toward Earl Kober
lein and 6-1 freshman guard Novian Whit
sitt.
Davis said that Whitsitt, who averaged 28
points a game last vear tor San Pedro High,
is the only one of his three freshman
recruits that most likely will play. The other
freshmen are 6-7 center Grady lohnson
from Atlanta, Ga., and 6-6 forward Doug
Wall from Grass Valley.
Hawaii-Pacific, which matches up evenly
with the small-for-the-Pac-10 Cardinal, is
paced by Rick Wozeniak, a 6-0 senior
guard. Wozeniak is averaging 22 points a
game so far this season, an improvement
over his 20.4 average last year. He also
holds the school record for most points
scored in a game at 38.
Other Sea Warriors that have played a
role in their early-season success are 6-0
junior Patrick Davis, 6-8 sophomore Charles
Garcia, 6-7 Greg Sparks, 6-5 Toron
Hightower, 6-5 Don Browne and 6-6 Eric
Gable. Coach Dan McFadden, a 1960
graduate of Yale, is in his tirst season with
Hawaii-Pacific.
The Sea Warriors played UC-Berkeley last
year and lost 99-73 although they led with
five minutes left in the first half. Hawaii-
Pacific scored probably its biggest upset last
season when it handed Chaminade (of Hile,
Hawaii) its first loss since defeating then-
No. 1 ranked Virginia.
The loser of Saturday afternoon's game
will have a chance for revenge when Stan
ford travels to the Sea Warriors' home floor
in Honolulu Dec. 22 as part of its seven-day,
three-game trip to the Islands over
Christmas.
Hoop notes
Davis also said that as of yesterday less
than 240 season tickets remain for the 1983-
84 Stanford basketball campaign in the
7457-seat Maples Pavilion. However, he did
mention that general admission tickets will
be available on a game-day basis for certain
games.
Charles Hunt the 6-4 junior forward who
started and scored 13 points against lapan,
recently recovered from an ankle injury he
sustained in the game and is now listed
third behind Brown and Fischer at the small
forward spot.
Speaking of Brown and Fischer, who both
sat out the Japan contest with injuries,
Davis said the two are now fine. Brown had
a sprained ankle and Fischer a broken bone
in his left hand.
