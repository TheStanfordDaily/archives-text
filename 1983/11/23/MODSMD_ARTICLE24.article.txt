# Spikers beat Long Beach in their last home game
## 
### TOM MOORE 
Showing the kind of inten
sity that has taken it to the No.
5 spot in the national rankings,
the Stanford women's volley
ball team crushed Cal-State
Long Beach last night at
Maples Pavilion in three
games.
Though the outcome was
never in doubt, the Card
spikers played like every point
could be the last.
"I liked the way we were
making diving saves and going
all out even though it wasn't a
close match," said Cardinal
assistant coach Don Shaw.
"You need that no matter who
you're playing."
Paced by Kari Rush and
Deidra Dvorak who led the
team with 15 assists each,
Stanford relied on a deliberate
ball control offense to con
tinually exploit Long Beach
State's defensive scheme.
The Card exploded to an 8-2
lead in the opening contest
behind solid blocking by Kim
Oden and Julie Baker. Seven
consecutive points then se
cured the game, 15-2. Stanford
had a little more trouble in the
next game, dashing out to a 9-
2 advantage, only to have Long
Beach battle back with four
straight points.
The Card settled down

during a time-out, regained
the serve with a Brooke Hah
ner kill, and never looked
back en route to a 15-7 deci
sion.
The women spikers seemed
to succumb to the third game
let-down that has plagued
them all season by falling be
hind 6-2 in the early going, but
staged a mild comeback to
forge ahead 8-6 behind aut
horitative kills by Hahner,
Rush, and Bobbi Broer.
Long Beach tied the score at
8, but then committed a vari
ety of errors that allowed Stan
ford to score seven un
answered tallies, and take the
game 15-8.
"It was nice to get that that
breather for a change," Shaw
said, "since we've been
playing top ranked teams nil
the time." The loss dropped
Long Beach to 5-24 overall, 2-
12 in the conference.
At the other end of the spec
trum, the Stanford spikers
finished 11-3 in the WCAA,
placing second behind UCLA.
Last year, the Card also
finished 11-3 and finished
second, giving it the confer
ence's best winning
percentage since it entered
the league for the 1982 season.
Leading the way offensively
last night were Baker,

Dvorak, and Oden with
six, six and five kills
respectively. Oden also con
tributed five blocks to lead the
squad.
The Cardinal hopes for the
same kind of balanced attack
this weekend when they face
the N0.6 ranked University of
Kentucky Wildcats in Lexi
ngton.
"Kentucky's a good team,"
Shaw said, "and they've been
playing real well lately." The
Wildcats are led by two poten
tial All-Americans. Outside
hitter Carolyn Kirby and
middle blocker Marcia Bond
anchor the Kentucky offense.
"We've really got to be ready
to play, " Shaw commented.
The 18-7 Card, virtually
assured a spot in the NCAA
tournament that begins Dec.
2, must wait until next Monday
before its opponent is an
nounced. Stanford still has a
possibility of being seeded in
the tourney.
The NCAA Final Four will be
held in Lexington, Kentucky
this year. "It'll be in the same
gym (as the matches this
weekend) so we'll already
have a feel for it," Shaw stated.
"But we have to get there (to
the Final Four) first."
The team will return from
Lexington late Sunday after
noon.
