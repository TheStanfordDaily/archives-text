## Sourlis short in height, long in basketball talent 
### BETH KLEID 
Sophomore Virginia Sourlis — at 5-foot
-2 — may be short in stature, but not in
status as a basketball player on the wo
men's team here. Last year she was named
freshman All-American.
When Sourlis tells people that she plays
basketball, many do not believe her — un
til they see her as a dynamo on the court.
"I play like I'm big," she said. "Even
though I'm usually the shortest one on the
court I don't feel like I'm 5-2. I don't con
centrate on my height; I just concentrate
on playing basketball."
Sourlis explained that she has turned
her petite build into an advantage. "If you
lack in something in one area, you just
have to make up for it somewhere else.
Because I'm short, I just have to be twice
as quick," she said.
Actually, height is not essential to her
position of point guard on a women's
team. But Sourlis admits, "A couple more
inches wouldn't hurt."
The sophomore has proven her basket
ball prowess even though she lacks these
inches. She was offered scholarships to
over 200 colleges in the country during her
senior year at the Rumson-Fair Haven High
School in New Jersey, and the list included
top women's basketball schools.
Sourlis chose to come to the Farm be
cause she has " always wanted to come to
California," and Stanford satisfied the list
of things that she was looking for in a
school.
Her list included a good team and
coaching staff, fine academics and a
desirable location.

The point guard describes her team this
year as "intense and aggressive." She said
that despite the fact that the team is
young — five freshman have joined the
squad this year — the intensity level is still
high.
"Our team is anxious to win, but we
also have a lot of finesse which comes
from within," she said.
Does Sourlis feel any pressure to per
form as a result of being a returner on the
young team? Apparently not. In fact, she
said that being one of the experienced
players has just the opposite effect.
"I become a better player by being
poised at those times that I am expected to
perform. Sometimes it does get frustrating
to be a returner on a young team, but the
freshman are trying really hard."
According to Sourlis, the team is close
knit on and off the court. "We are all
friends, and because we are young we are
going to have three or four years together.
Road trips will be a good time."
The coaching staff here also pleases the
sophomore. "I have improved vastly from
working under Dottie McCray. She has of
fered good advice on the point guard posi
tion and my options there."
This season Sourlis has a set of goals
that she would like to accomplish as point
guard on the court."I always set goals,"
she said, "this season I want to average 20
points a game, and I really want to be a
leader out there. "
Sourlis continued, "Last year I passed a
lot — this year I want to be more of a
shooter.
She hopes that the team will accomplish
a record of 500 or better this season. "My
goals for the team are to minimize
mistakes, and for us to keep striving,
which is the way to build winners."
Sourlis has yet another set of goals that
she aims to achieve, and these are in
regard to her future. She plans to try out
for the 1984 Olympic women's basketball
team in May. "And if I don't make the 1984
team, I am going to try for 1988," she said.
But basketball is not the only sport in
which Sourlis shines. She said that she
may decide to concentrate on tennis, and
"try to make the pro circuit." Sourlis has
only been playing tennis for a short time,
but she was told that she has exceptional
potential.
Versatility in sports is nothing new to
Sourlis. She has grown up with it. Her fa
ther was a professional baseball player,
her mother plays tennis and golf, her
younger brother is an avid golfer, her
older brother is the manager of the men's
basketball team at lona College in New
York and her younger sister is a contender

in the Pepsi Hotshot basketball competi
tion.
When Sourlis was growing up the family
played sports together. "We would play
basketball up to eight hours a day on the
court in our backyard. It was really con
venient and we liked it — and I saw that I
could achieve something through
practice."
Sourlis' parents encouraged their
to participate in many sports, and
they promoted the idea that sports are an
impo r tant part of growing up. "My father
said that sports re.ate to life. You have to
learn to win; and you have to learn to
lose."
She has adopted some of her father's
philosophies to her own sports career
— one concerns confidence. "You have
to have self-confidence because if you are
not sure of yourself you make mistakes, "
she said. "But it isn't good to be over
confident."
When playing basketball, Sourlis main
tains a "you come out and beat me" atti
tude which keeps her confidence level up
on a court where the other players may
tower over her. "Because of this attitude I
don't get intimidated."
The sophomore also has confidence in
the future of women's basketball. She said
that if the 1984 women's Olympic team
does well, she predicts it will be followed
by the emergence of a women's profes
sional league. "It failed a couple of years
ago, but I think that television could be
used to get it off its feet," said Sourlis,
who is a communications major here.
If a credible women's professional
league does develop, Sourlis would like to
play in it for "only about a year, because I
do want to settle down and have a family."
Sourlis notes that women's basketball
has made a great deal of progress from its
early days. "The first women's intercol
legiate women's game ever was played at
Stanford against Cal," she said. "Stanford
won 2-1."
The brand of basketball that Sourlis
plays in Maples Pavilion is certainly differ
ent from that of her predecessors. The
early women players played half-court
games with a three dribble rule and no
fouling allowed.
Of course, today's women's games are
much more exciting. But Sourlis said that a
reason that they don't attract as many fans
as men's games is because there is no
"above the rim action."
Nevertheless, women's basketball has
gone from bloomers to shorts, and Sourlis
is glad to be a part of the growing game.
"Women's basketball has come a long
way, and it can go further."

may decide to concentrate on tennis, and
"try to make the pro circuit." Sourlis has
only been playing tennis for a short time,
but she was told that she has exceptional
potential.
Versatility in sports is nothing new to
Sourlis. She has grown up with it. Her fa
ther was a professional baseball player,
her mother plays tennis and golf, her
younger brother is an avid golfer, her
older brother is the manager of the men's
basketball team at lona College in New
York and her younger sister is a contender

in the Pepsi Hotshot basketball competi
tion.
When Sourlis was growing up the family
played sports together. "We would play
basketball up to eight hours a day on the
court in our backyard. It was really con
venient and we liked it — and I saw that I
could achieve something through
practice."
Sourlis' parents encouraged their
to participate in many sports, and
they promoted the idea that sports are an
impo r tant part of growing up. "My father
said that sports re.ate to life. You have to
learn to win; and you have to learn to
lose."
She has adopted some of her father's
philosophies to her own sports career
— one concerns confidence. "You have
to have self-confidence because if you are
not sure of yourself you make mistakes, "
she said. "But it isn't good to be over
confident."
When playing basketball, Sourlis main
tains a "you come out and beat me" atti
tude which keeps her confidence level up
on a court where the other players may
tower over her. "Because of this attitude I
don't get intimidated."
The sophomore also has confidence in
the future of women's basketball. She said
that if the 1984 women's Olympic team
does well, she predicts it will be followed
by the emergence of a women's profes
sional league. "It failed a couple of years
ago, but I think that television could be
used to get it off its feet," said Sourlis,
who is a communications major here.
If a credible women's professional
league does develop, Sourlis would like to
play in it for "only about a year, because I
do want to settle down and have a family."
Sourlis notes that women's basketball
has made a great deal of progress from its
early days. "The first women's intercol
legiate women's game ever was played at
Stanford against Cal," she said. "Stanford
won 2-1."
The brand of basketball that Sourlis
plays in Maples Pavilion is certainly differ
ent from that of her predecessors. The
early women players played half-court
games with a three dribble rule and no
fouling allowed.
Of course, today's women's games are
much more exciting. But Sourlis said that a
reason that they don't attract as many fans
as men's games is because there is no
"above the rim action."
Nevertheless, women's basketball has
gone from bloomers to shorts, and Sourlis
is glad to be a part of the growing game.
"Women's basketball has come a long
way, and it can go further."


Virginia Sourlis

Sophomore Virginia Sourlis, who was a freshman All-American last year, is an es
sential force on this year's basketball team.
Sophomore Virginia Sourlis — at 5-foot
-2 — may be short in stature, but not in
status as a basketball player on the wo
men's team here. Last year she was named
freshman All-American.
When Sourlis tells people that she plays
basketball, many do not believe her — un
til they see her as a dynamo on the court.
"I play like I'm big," she said. "Even
though I'm usually the shortest one on the
court I don't feel like I'm 5-2. I don't con
centrate on my height; I just concentrate
on playing basketball."
Sourlis explained that she has turned
her petite build into an advantage. "If you
lack in something in one area, you just
have to make up for it somewhere else.
Because I'm short, I just have to be twice
as quick," she said.
Actually, height is not essential to her
position of point guard on a women's
team. But Sourlis admits, "A couple more
inches wouldn't hurt."
The sophomore has proven her basket
ball prowess even though she lacks these
inches. She was offered scholarships to
over 200 colleges in the country during her
senior year at the Rumson-Fair Haven High
School in New Jersey, and the list included
top women's basketball schools.
Sourlis chose to come to the Farm be
cause she has " always wanted to come to
California," and Stanford satisfied the list
of things that she was looking for in a
school.
Her list included a good team and
coaching staff, fine academics and a
desirable location.

The point guard describes her team this
year as "intense and aggressive." She said
that despite the fact that the team is
young — five freshman have joined the
squad this year — the intensity level is still
high.
"Our team is anxious to win, but we
also have a lot of finesse which comes
from within," she said.
Does Sourlis feel any pressure to per
form as a result of being a returner on the
young team? Apparently not. In fact, she
said that being one of the experienced
players has just the opposite effect.
"I become a better player by being
poised at those times that I am expected to
perform. Sometimes it does get frustrating
to be a returner on a young team, but the
freshman are trying really hard."
According to Sourlis, the team is close
knit on and off the court. "We are all
friends, and because we are young we are
going to have three or four years together.
Road trips will be a good time."
The coaching staff here also pleases the
sophomore. "I have improved vastly from
working under Dottie McCray. She has of
fered good advice on the point guard posi
tion and my options there."
This season Sourlis has a set of goals
that she would like to accomplish as point
guard on the court."I always set goals,"
she said, "this season I want to average 20
points a game, and I really want to be a
leader out there. "
Sourlis continued, "Last year I passed a
lot — this year I want to be more of a
shooter.
She hopes that the team will accomplish
a record of 500 or better this season. "My
goals for the team are to minimize
mistakes, and for us to keep striving,
which is the way to build winners."
Sourlis has yet another set of goals that
she aims to achieve, and these are in
regard to her future. She plans to try out
for the 1984 Olympic women's basketball
team in May. "And if I don't make the 1984
team, I am going to try for 1988," she said.
But basketball is not the only sport in
which Sourlis shines. She said that she
may decide to concentrate on tennis, and
"try to make the pro circuit." Sourlis has
