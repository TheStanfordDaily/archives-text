# Club sports flourish on Farm

The time for club sports at
Stanford — which has one of
the finest club sports pro
grams on the West Coast — is
now.
According to Club Sports
Director Shirley Schoof,
"We're doing fine and we
have the support."
The Club Sports Program of
fers many athletes additional
opportunities for competition
that they would not receive
because they were not
recruited for varsity teams.
The program is also far more
serious in nature than the es
sentially light-hearted intra
mural program.
There are women's, men's
and coed teams which operate
as competitive or non
competitive groups. Some
sports are open to all Stanford
students, some only to under
graduates. There is a wide va
riety of sports in the program.
The Club Sports Program is
funded by several sources.
The ASSU fee assessment pro
vides a portion of the funds
for the program. Another por
tion of the funds comes from,
as Schoof put it, "a general
fund through the Athletic De
partment."
Schoof added, " Every year
we have the (Harlem)
Globetrotters here at Stan
ford. It's our main, big fund
raiser."
Senior May Braselton, club
sports president, said, "In ad
dition to that (the Globetrot
ters), each of the clubs has its
own fund-raiser."
Fund raising is the heart of

the Club Sports Program.
"They (the clubs) need more
money, of course" Schoof
said. "They're going out and

raising whatever their deficits
are that we can't meet."
In addition, Schoof said that
the clubs get odd jobs with the
Athletic Department. These
jobs include cleaning the Stan
ford Stadium after football
games, sweeping up Maples
Pavilion after basketball
games, distributing flyers up
and down the Peninsula and
selling books.
Schoof put the financial af
fairs of the clubs in perspec
tive by saying, "Club sports,
they're a self-help program
. . . student-run. They plan
their budgets, they organize
their fund-raisers, they
schedule their games, they
plan their trips."
Each club has officers and
two are elected as club repre
sentatives. These representa
tives attend meetings of all the
clubs which are held twice a
quarter. At the meetings, the
funds collected from general
fund-raisers are apportioned,
clubs report on their individ-

Newport Regatta. The team is an example of successful club
sports at Stanford.

ual status and occasionally
elections are held.
The club sports president is
chosen from the representa

teams practice at least six
times a week, early in the mor
ning, at Redwood Shores. All
this and the fund raising nec
essary for survival makes
playing a club sport for some
nearly as time consuming as a
varsity sport.
Many club sports athletes
are those who were not for
tunate enough to be recruited
for varsity teams but who have
a desire to continue in compe
tition. But that does not mean
that there is no recruiting.
The men's and women's
crew, sailing and women's
soccer are teams that recruit.
They do not have the money
to give awards to players but
actively attempt to attract out
standing participants to Stan
ford.
For those sports that are
competitive (Aikido is an ex
ample of a non-competitive
sport), there are club leagues.
According to Schoof, Stanford
is doing very well in the
respective leagues.
"The women's lacrosse
(team) dominates the West
Coast. Men's lacrosse is right
up there. Softball does very
well," Schoof said.
Schoof said that the clubs as
a whole care about each
other. Some teams are now
giving up their shares of the
general money for more
needy clubs. This is an enor
mous stride, for Schoof said
that in the past there was a
feeling at the meetings that
the representatives had their
hands out for their share of
the money. This year, Schoof
said, "There's more giving and
more understanding."

tive body to work directly with
the program director. The
clubs organize all their non
athletic pursuits so that, as
Schoof said, "The coach only
comes in and coaches."
Some club sports coaches
are paid, some are not. Brasel
ton, also a club lacrosse
player, said of the coaches
who are paid, "If you looked
at the amount they're getting
paid and the amount of time
they put in, it's more of a
volunteer."
Schoof used the case of the
ice hockey club coach as an
example: "He had been
coaching since the late '60s
and he received such a mini
mal amount that at first, years
ago, they used to take him out
to dinner and that was his
pay."
Club sports teams follow
rigorous practice schedules if
their fund-raising time is taken
into account. Schoof said
some teams practice "just
about as much as the varsity."
For example, the crew

According to Club Sports
Director Shirley Schoof,
"We're doing fine and we
have the support."
The Club Sports Program of
fers many athletes additional
opportunities for competition
that they would not receive
because they were not
recruited for varsity teams.
The program is also far more
serious in nature than the es
sentially light-hearted intra
mural program.
There are women's, men's
and coed teams which operate
as competitive or non
competitive groups. Some
sports are open to all Stanford
students, some only to under
graduates. There is a wide va
riety of sports in the program.
The Club Sports Program is
funded by several sources.
The ASSU fee assessment pro
vides a portion of the funds
for the program. Another por
tion of the funds comes from,
as Schoof put it, "a general
fund through the Athletic De
partment."
Schoof added, " Every year
we have the (Harlem)
Globetrotters here at Stan
ford. It's our main, big fund
raiser."
Senior May Braselton, club
sports president, said, "In ad
dition to that (the Globetrot
ters), each of the clubs has its
own fund-raiser."
Fund raising is the heart of

the Club Sports Program.
"They (the clubs) need more
money, of course" Schoof
said. "They're going out and

raising whatever their deficits
are that we can't meet."
In addition, Schoof said that
the clubs get odd jobs with the
Athletic Department. These
jobs include cleaning the Stan
ford Stadium after football
games, sweeping up Maples
Pavilion after basketball
games, distributing flyers up
and down the Peninsula and
selling books.
Schoof put the financial af
fairs of the clubs in perspec
tive by saying, "Club sports,
they're a self-help program
. . . student-run. They plan
their budgets, they organize
their fund-raisers, they
schedule their games, they
plan their trips."
Each club has officers and
two are elected as club repre
sentatives. These representa
tives attend meetings of all the
clubs which are held twice a
quarter. At the meetings, the
funds collected from general
fund-raisers are apportioned,
clubs report on their individ-

elections are held.
The club sports president is
chosen from the representa

teams practice at least six
times a week, early in the mor
ning, at Redwood Shores. All
this and the fund raising nec
essary for survival makes
playing a club sport for some
nearly as time consuming as a
varsity sport.
Many club sports athletes
are those who were not for
tunate enough to be recruited
for varsity teams but who have
a desire to continue in compe
tition. But that does not mean
that there is no recruiting.
The men's and women's
crew, sailing and women's
soccer are teams that recruit.
They do not have the money
to give awards to players but
actively attempt to attract out
standing participants to Stan
ford.
For those sports that are
competitive (Aikido is an ex
ample of a non-competitive
sport), there are club leagues.
According to Schoof, Stanford
is doing very well in the
respective leagues.
"The women's lacrosse
(team) dominates the West
Coast. Men's lacrosse is right
up there. Softball does very
well," Schoof said.
Schoof said that the clubs as
a whole care about each
other. Some teams are now
giving up their shares of the
general money for more
needy clubs. This is an enor
mous stride, for Schoof said
that in the past there was a
feeling at the meetings that
the representatives had their
hands out for their share of
the money. This year, Schoof
said, "There's more giving and
more understanding."

tive body to work directly with
the program director. The
clubs organize all their non
athletic pursuits so that, as
Schoof said, "The coach only
comes in and coaches."
Some club sports coaches
are paid, some are not. Brasel
ton, also a club lacrosse
player, said of the coaches
who are paid, "If you looked
at the amount they're getting
paid and the amount of time
they put in, it's more of a
volunteer."
Schoof used the case of the
ice hockey club coach as an
example: "He had been
coaching since the late '60s
and he received such a mini
mal amount that at first, years
ago, they used to take him out
to dinner and that was his
pay."
Club sports teams follow
rigorous practice schedules if
their fund-raising time is taken
into account. Schoof said
some teams practice "just
about as much as the varsity."
For example, the crew
