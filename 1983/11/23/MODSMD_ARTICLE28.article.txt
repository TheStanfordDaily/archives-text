# Card wrestlers to press their way to the top

### PETER CASTILLO 
Wrestling at Stanford is beginning to
emerge from obscurity this season to
become one of the most exciting sports on
campus. Coached by former Stanford All-
American Chris Horpel, the squad has a
chance to crack into the nation's top 20 only
four years after the program's reinstate
ment.
"This year we face every West Coast
power and we are shooting for a winning
dual meet record," said Horpel. "If healthy,
I expect the team to have five NCAA
qualifiers and hopefully two All-Americans."
Last year's team had a 10-7 record and
placed 35th at the NCAA. Returning from
this squad is senior Flint Pulskamp at 190
pounds. As a heavyweight (above 190
pounds) Pulskamp took the Pac-10 crown
and now at his current weight his perfor
mance should be better. He is currently
sidelined and hopes to return in January.
Co-captain senior Jeff Wilson was injured

most of last year, but still placed third in the
Pac-10 at 177 pounds and is a potential Pac
-10 champ and All-American. Recovering
from mononucleosis is Scott Wiggen, who
took second at 150 pounds at the Pac-10 last
year.
Also returning is heavyweight junior Ed
Katz, an NCAA qualifier two years ago who
looks strong this year.
Top freshman include Kurt Kassulke at 190
pounds and Mark Alex at 150 pounds.
The team has three former All-Americans
as assistant coaches, Dave and Mark Schultz
and former Cardinal Doug Perkins, which
gives the squad invaluable coaching experi
ence and has helped this year's recruiting
drive. Dave Schultz at one time was a world
freestyle champion.
Horpel hopes to finish third in the Pac-10
behind league powerhouses Arizona State
and Oregon State.
The wrestling team next faces UC-Davis
on the road next Saturday.
