# Professors debate probability of Nicaragua invasion
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The invasion of Grenada has sparked a
debate among Stanford professors about
whether the Reagan administration will
make Nicaragua the next target of U.S.
troops.
Some say the Reagan administration has
prepared for an invasion by toppling
Grenada's government earlier this month,
supporting Nicaraguan counter
revolutionaries and posting fleets of ships
along Nicaragua's Atlantic and Pacific
Coasts.
"I think that all the signs point to a possi
bility of an American invasion," said
Spanish Prof. Fernando Alegria. "The pres
ent situation in Nicaragua and El Salvador
indicates that the U.S. government could
make a fatal mistake in promoting a
regional war."
Others said an American invasion of
Nicaragua is improbable because of the mil
itary and political difficulties involved.
"My hunch is that Nicaragua and the
United States are close to a negotiation,"
said History Prof. John Wirth. "The time is
right to cut a deal."
Most Central American diplomats and
U.S. officials think an American military so

lution to Central America's problems is in
the works. However, there is no consensus
about the kind of military solution being
planned or when a solution would be im
plemented.
Alegria said President Reagan is willing to
take the risk of invading Nicaragua because
he has a simplistic view of Central
America's problems. "Reagan is stating
the terms of the problems in Central
America on the basis of a direct confronta
tion between the Soviet Union and the
United States," he said. "But what the
Central Americans are trying to do is to
remedy a situation of social and economic
injustice that has existed for a long time."
An invasion of Nicaragua would be more
difficult than the invasion of Grenada be
cause the Sandinista government is
stronger than Grenada's Marxist regime,
Alegria said.
"In the case of Nicaragua, I don't see the
divisions that obviously were very deep
within the Grenadian revolutionary team,"
he said.
But Cuba, a strong backer of the Sandi
nistas, would not fight an invasion, he said.
"My guess is that Cuba would realize it
cannot stop a military machine as powerful
as the United States war machine," Alegria

said. "And outside of condemning the inva
sion, I doubt the Latin American countries
would do anything practical."
Latin Americans would be outraged by an
invasion of Nicaragua because they remem
ber the United States' history of aggression
in their countries, Alegria said.
"We would see a strong expression of in
dignation and protest," he said. "As a Latin
American, I would think immediately of a
number of interventions by the United
States in Latin America. I could cite more
than 60 cases of direct intervention by the
United States between 1831 and 1983 in
Latin America. In a way, one could say that
it (an invasion of Nit aragua) would fit into a
pattern."
But Wirth said Nicaragua and the United
States have strong incentives to negotiate
their differences.
"I think the Sandinistas are under tre
mendous pressure," he said. "The
Congress is uneasy about the covert opera
tions against Nicaragua. They certainly
don't want direct troop involvement
there."
The Nicaraguan economy has been
seriously hurt by the counter
revolutionaries' destruction of ports and
oil storage centers, he said.

"The covert operations are having an ef
fect now that has been magnified by the
threat of direct intervention by the United
States," Wirth said.
The invasion of Grenada has put the San
dinistas on alert that the Reagan administra
tion could use military force in Latin
America, he said.

But the Reagan administration knows an
invasion of Nicaragua would be much
bloodier than the invasion of Grenada,
Wirth said.
"Why go to Nicaragua when there is
going to be a lot of killing ?" he said. "The
Sandinistas and the Cubans will fight. The
Cubans will fight for a while. I think they
will make a strong stand."
The Reagan administration will not want
to mire itself in a difficult invasion of
Nicaragua because it is faces many hard
choices in El Salvador and Lebanon, Wirth
said.
"Reagan is very cautious," he said. "They
(policy makers in the Reagan administra
tion) talk a lot tougher than they act."
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshal!
said U.S. troops probably will not be sent to
invade Nicaragua.
"But I think there is a 50 percent
likelihood that we will send in surrogates
from Honduras and perhaps Guatemala,"
Marshall said. "The Reagan administration
seems implacably hostile to any kind of
government that calls itself Marxist and
seems to promote revolution."
The use of surrogate troops would blunt
criticism of an invasion, he said.
