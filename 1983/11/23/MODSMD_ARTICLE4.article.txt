# 'Day After' impact slight, experts say
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Staff writer 
Professors here agree that the
television movie "The Day After"
will make people more aware of the
nuclear weapons issue, but they dis
agree as to whether the movie will
aid the nuclear freeze movement.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein
said the impact of the Sunday night
film wouldn't be very significant. "I
suspect the long range impact is
going to be quite small," he said,
unless activist groups can
"shrewdly" manipulate the short
term effects of the film toward their
own goals.
While Bernstein said he believed
that the question of who actually
launched first was "skillfully left am
biguous," he thought that the early
portion of the film was "sufficiently
obscured" as to "make people for
get how it started." This, he
thought, was done to bring the
focus of the program on the effects
of nuclear war on Americans, rather
than the political implications of
how to avoid it.
Asst. Political Science Prof. Con
doleezza Rice said the film served to
increase awareness in people that
"haven't" or "haven't wanted" to

think about the nuclear arms issue.
But she said the audience response
to the film could range from adopt
ing a survivalist (pro-civil defense) to
a pro-freeze to a pro-superiority po
sition.
Psychology Prof. Phoebe Ells
worth said the movie would prob
ably have the net effect of moving
its uncommitted audience in "some
kind of a pro-freeze direction."
But she added that the likelihood
of viewers actually becoming politi
cally active was quite another mat
ter. She believed that public opinion
right now would be more aware
than it otherwise would have been,
but whether or not the film has an
impact on next year's elections
depends mainly on whether "it's
(the nuclear debate) a live issue at
the time."
Ellsworth thought the greatest im
pact of "The Day After" was increas
ing the general awareness of the nu
clear issue. People were "more like
ly," she said, "to notice other rele
vant information" on the subject as
a result of the film.
Peter Collins, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution on leave from
the State Department, criticized the
movie because it failed to "address
the problem of how policy makers
cope with this (nuclear) dilemma."
Collins said that some pro-freeze
groups did indeed see the film "as
to their benefit," and added that "if
the movie leads to condemnation of
U.S. policy or deployment," he
added, "then it's unfortunate."
Professors also criticized the
movie because it did not accurately
portray the effects of a nuclear war.
Coit Blacker, associate director of
the Center for International Security
and Arms Control, found fault with
the film's implication that a full-scale
war was survivable. "It (the film) left
the impression that people could
survive," he said, which was

"fundamentally misleading."
Bernstein saw this implication as
conforming with its general ten
dency of being gentle. "It (the film)
was remarkably soft," he said.
Rice said she thought the movie
"graphically, though not as graphi
cally" as she had expected, depicted
the effects of nuclear war.
Professors also said they did not
believe that the panel discussion
after the movie would have impor
tant political effects.
The panel on the special edition
of ABC's "Viewpoint" consisted of
columnist William F. Buckley, phil
osopher Elie Wiesel, former Secre
tary of State Henry Kissinger, astro
physicist Carl Sagan, former Assistant
to the President for National Secur
ity Affairs Brent Scowcroft, and
former Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara.

Collins said that the Reagan ad
ministration was in no way hurt by
the debate."As far as the commen
tary went," he said, "I think the ad
ministration came out rather well."
Bernstein felt the panel discussion
afterward turned into an "argument
among people who all don't want
nuclear war." Since the issue of how
specifically to avoid nuclear war was
never brought up, what resulted
was, as Bernstein put it, a
"remarkably non-political discus
sion over a narrow range."
Blacker also called the discussion
"particularly unenlightening."
Blacker found the "general thrust"
of what Sagan said — the 100-
megaton threshhold level for
"nuclear winter" and the possibility
of human extinction — important,
but Sagan's comments had gone,
for the most part, unnoticed.

going to be quite small," he said,
unless activist groups can
"shrewdly" manipulate the short
term effects of the film toward their
own goals.
While Bernstein said he believed
that the question of who actually
launched first was "skillfully left am
biguous," he thought that the early
portion of the film was "sufficiently
obscured" as to "make people for
get how it started." This, he
thought, was done to bring the
focus of the program on the effects
of nuclear war on Americans, rather
than the political implications of
how to avoid it.
Asst. Political Science Prof. Con
doleezza Rice said the film served to
increase awareness in people that
"haven't" or "haven't wanted" to

think about the nuclear arms issue.
But she said the audience response
to the film could range from adopt
ing a survivalist (pro-civil defense) to
a pro-freeze to a pro-superiority po
sition.
Psychology Prof. Phoebe Ells
worth said the movie would prob
ably have the net effect of moving
its uncommitted audience in "some
kind of a pro-freeze direction."
But she added that the likelihood
of viewers actually becoming politi
cally active was quite another mat
ter. She believed that public opinion
right now would be more aware
than it otherwise would have been,
but whether or not the film has an
impact on next year's elections
depends mainly on whether "it's
(the nuclear debate) a live issue at
the time."
Ellsworth thought the greatest im
pact of "The Day After" was increas
ing the general awareness of the nu
clear issue. People were "more like
ly," she said, "to notice other rele
vant information" on the subject as
a result of the film.
Peter Collins, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution on leave from
the State Department, criticized the
movie because it failed to "address
the problem of how policy makers
cope with this (nuclear) dilemma."
Collins said that some pro-freeze
groups did indeed see the film "as
to their benefit," and added that "if
the movie leads to condemnation of
U.S. policy or deployment," he
added, "then it's unfortunate."
Professors also criticized the
movie because it did not accurately
portray the effects of a nuclear war.
Coit Blacker, associate director of
the Center for International Security
and Arms Control, found fault with
the film's implication that a full-scale
war was survivable. "It (the film) left
the impression that people could
survive," he said, which was

"fundamentally misleading."
Bernstein saw this implication as
conforming with its general ten
dency of being gentle. "It (the film)
was remarkably soft," he said.
Rice said she thought the movie
"graphically, though not as graphi
cally" as she had expected, depicted
the effects of nuclear war.
Professors also said they did not
believe that the panel discussion
after the movie would have impor
tant political effects.
The panel on the special edition
of ABC's "Viewpoint" consisted of
columnist William F. Buckley, phil
osopher Elie Wiesel, former Secre
tary of State Henry Kissinger, astro
physicist Carl Sagan, former Assistant
to the President for National Secur
ity Affairs Brent Scowcroft, and
former Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara.

Collins said that the Reagan ad
ministration was in no way hurt by
the debate."As far as the commen
tary went," he said, "I think the ad
ministration came out rather well."
Bernstein felt the panel discussion
afterward turned into an "argument
among people who all don't want
nuclear war." Since the issue of how
specifically to avoid nuclear war was
never brought up, what resulted
was, as Bernstein put it, a
"remarkably non-political discus
sion over a narrow range."
Blacker also called the discussion
"particularly unenlightening."
Blacker found the "general thrust"
of what Sagan said — the 100-
megaton threshhold level for
"nuclear winter" and the possibility
of human extinction — important,
but Sagan's comments had gone,
for the most part, unnoticed.
