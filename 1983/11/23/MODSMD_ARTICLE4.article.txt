# 'Day After' impact slight, experts say

### SHIRISH DATE Staff writer 
Professors here agree that the
television movie "The Day After"
will make people more aware of the
nuclear weapons issue, but they dis
agree as to whether the movie will
aid the nuclear freeze movement.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein
said the impact of the Sunday night
film wouldn't be very significant. "I
suspect the long range impact is
going to be quite small," he said,
unless activist groups can
"shrewdly" manipulate the short
term effects of the film toward their
own goals.
While Bernstein said he believed
that the question of who actually
launched first was "skillfully left am
biguous," he thought that the early
portion of the film was "sufficiently
obscured" as to "make people for
get how it started." This, he
thought, was done to bring the
focus of the program on the effects
of nuclear war on Americans, rather
than the political implications of
how to avoid it.
Asst. Political Science Prof. Con
doleezza Rice said the film served to
increase awareness in people that
"haven't" or "haven't wanted" to

think about the nuclear arms issue.
But she said the audience response
to the film could range from adopt
ing a survivalist (pro-civil defense) to
a pro-freeze to a pro-superiority po
sition.
Psychology Prof. Phoebe Ells
worth said the movie would prob
ably have the net effect of moving
its uncommitted audience in "some
kind of a pro-freeze direction."
But she added that the likelihood
of viewers actually becoming politi
cally active was quite another mat
ter. She believed that public opinion
right now would be more aware
than it otherwise would have been,
but whether or not the film has an
impact on next year's elections
depends mainly on whether "it's
(the nuclear debate) a live issue at
the time."
Ellsworth thought the greatest im
pact of "The Day After" was increas
ing the general awareness of the nu
clear issue. People were "more like
ly," she said, "to notice other rele
vant information" on the subject as
a result of the film.
Peter Collins, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution on leave from
the State Department, criticized the
