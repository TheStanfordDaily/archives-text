West Germany approves missiles
Bonn, West Germany â€” Following a heated, con
troversial debate, the West German parliament late
yesterday voted to support deployment of U.S.
intermediate-range nuclear missiles on West Ger
man soil. The vote was 286-226, with one abstention,
after more than 25 hours of debate over two days.
Although the ability of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
coalition government to carry to motion was never
in serious doubt, the emotional nature of the missile
issue made the debate one of the most closely fol
lowed in years. Although the balloting was secret,
the vote appeared to divide along strict party lines.
The result removed the final major obstacle to the

deployment of 572 Pershing 2 and cruise nuclear
missiles in western Europe. The new weapons con
stitute the alliance's answer to a Soviet buildup of
intermediate-range nuclear missiles,
The decision to deploy follows the inability of the
United States and Soviet Union to reach agreement
on limiting the missiles in negotiations in Geneva,
Switzerland.
Although the first of the 160 cruise missiles to be
deployed in Britain began arriving there last week
soon after the House of Commons voted its final ap
proval, it is West Germany that is the focal point of
the deployment. It was speculated here that the first
of the new Pershings may arrive at U.S. military
bases in southwestern West Germany later this
week, although NATO officials in Brussels would
only confirm long-existing plans to have the missiles
operational by mid-December.
