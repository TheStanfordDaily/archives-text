West Germany approves missiles
Bonn, West Germany — Following a heated, con
troversial debate, the West German parliament late
yesterday voted to support deployment of U.S.
intermediate-range nuclear missiles on West Ger
man soil. The vote was 286-226, with one abstention,
after more than 25 hours of debate over two days.
Although the ability of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
coalition government to carry to motion was never
in serious doubt, the emotional nature of the missile
issue made the debate one of the most closely fol
lowed in years. Although the balloting was secret,
the vote appeared to divide along strict party lines.
The result removed the final major obstacle to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's controversial

deployment of 572 Pershing 2 and cruise nuclear
missiles in western Europe. The new weapons con
stitute the alliance's answer to a Soviet buildup of
intermediate-range nuclear missiles,
The decision to deploy follows the inability of the
United States and Soviet Union to reach agreement
on limiting the missiles in negotiations in Geneva,
Switzerland.
Although the first of the 160 cruise missiles to be
deployed in Britain began arriving there last week
soon after the House of Commons voted its final ap
proval, it is West Germany that is the focal point of
the deployment. It was speculated here that the first
of the new Pershings may arrive at U.S. military
bases in southwestern West Germany later this
week, although NATO officials in Brussels would
only confirm long-existing plans to have the missiles
operational by mid-December.
Jury finds Ford negligent
Corpus Christi, Texas — A state court jury yesterday
found the Ford Motor Co. guilty of "gross
negligence" in the design of the Mustang II and
awarded $106.9 million in damages to the family of a
20-year-old woman killed in a car wreck five years
ago.
The jury deliberated for six hours before deciding
Ford should pay $6 million in actual damages and
$100 million in punitive damages for the death of
Devary Durrill of Robstown.
Ford attorney William Meredith said a decision
hasn't been made on whether to appeal the deci
sion.
Ms. Durrill's 1974 Mustang II was hit from behind
and bust into flames in October 1978 after she and a
friend had stopped on the shoulder of the road to
clean up a soft drink that had spilled. Ms. Durrill
died a week later of third-degree burns.
Economic recovery continues
Washington — The economy grew at an annual
rate of 7.7 percent in the third quarter, the govern
ment reported yesterday. That pace is slower than
anticipated, but, as one analyst said, it "doesn't
change the underlying fact that the recovery is very
solid."
Indeed, others said that after the rapid 9.7 percent
gain of the spring quarter, the lower estimate,
though still strong, offers greater hope for controll
ing inflation.
Cranston shuns fund-raiser
Washington — Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), angry
with Democratic Party Chairman Charles Manatt,
yesterday withdrew from a fund-raising blitz that
was to feature all eight Democratic presidential
hopefuls.
In a stinging letter to Manatt, Cranston campaign
manager Sergio Bendixen urged that the Dec. 5 and
6 "Presidential Sweep" be canceled so that the na
tional party can "focus all of its time and energy" of

resolving a raging controversy over the dates of the
lowa presidential caucuses and the New Hampshire
primary. lowa and New Hampshire are planning to
hold their delegate-selection events earlier than the
national party wants.
'Hill Street' star dies
Los Angeles — Michael Conrad, the loquacious,
paternal and street-weary Sgt. Phillip Freemason Es
terhaus of "Hill Street Blues," probably the most ac
claimed TV series of this decade, died early yester
day in Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital. He was 58
and had been battling cancer of the ureter for
several months, Cordon Cohn, a spokesman for the
University of Southern California-owned hospital,
said.
Conrad was an integral part of that small cadre of
talent that kept "Hill Street" on the air after its initial
ratings proved a disappointment. But the critical ac
claim that greeted the series after its January 1981
debut (Conrad alone won two Emmys and the rest of
the cast shared dozens more) kept the policemen
and women of Hill Street Station on the air.

terday, extending Monday's rally.

Monday, climbed 7.02 to 1275.81 by the end of

York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
