The political and economic actions of developed
countries have an effect on the food distribution in
Third World nations, three experts on world hunger
told about 250 people in Cubberley Auditorium last
night.
The United States has a responsibility "to set an ex
ample of what political democracy can do," author
Frances Moore Lappe said. In addition, it is necessary
for the United States to recognize developments in
Third World countries and not "belittle them," no mat
ter how small they may seem.
As the culmination of Hunger Week, the Stanford
Committee on Hunger co-sponsored "The Politics of
Food and Development Assistance," a presentation
and discussion featuring Lappe and author Alain de
Janvry. The panel also included Larry Simon, director of

policy analysis of Oxfam America, a private develop
ment foundation.
Lappe began the program saying that she has spent
the last 14 years "trying to understand why hunger
exists in a world of apparent plenty."
Saying that Americans have become "myopic" and
"have lost perspective in how we relate to the rest of
the world," de Janvry echoed Lappe's encouragement
of the United States to get more involved in world
hunger issues. De lanvry also said that understanding
and cultural exchange between countries must be
promoted to broaden this myopia.
De lanvry added that hunger issues are different in
each country and therefore warrant treatment on an in
dividual basis. In the Latin American countries, for ex
ample, the food distribution problem is not due to pro
duction but rather to the fact that the bulk of produc
tion is for export or luxury goods , he explained.
