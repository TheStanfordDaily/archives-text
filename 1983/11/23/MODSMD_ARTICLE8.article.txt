## New leadership attitudes necessary Expert speaks on Palestinian conflict 
### STEVE LEBOVITZ 
New leadership with creative
new ideas for peace is needed to
bring about a resolution of the
Israeli-Palestinian issue, a
Mideast expert told about 50
people in Toyon lounge yester
day.
William Brinner, a professor of
Near Eastern Studies at UC-
Berkeley, said that "the conflict is
one of two national movements
that make claim to the same
piece of land." He said that the
principal challenge is "to work
out a justifiable solution that
recognizes the national claims of
both groups."
Brinner, who spoke as part of a
series on Israel and the Palestin
ian question sponsored by Resi
dential Education, described the
Mideast situation as a constantly
shifting picture which only slight
ly resembles that of 35 years ago
when the state of Israel was es
tablished. He called for leaders to
"deal with the present reality"
and to realize "it is not possible
to turn back the clock."
"If wisdom of leadership does
not develop," Brinner said, "the
tragedy of people being killed
daily will continue."
According to Brinner's analy
sis, the major problem is a lack of
leadership that serves the inter
ests of both groups involved.
On the Palestinian side, Brin

ner referred to the "tradition of
saying no" on matters of negotia
tion that was originated by the
first Palestinian leader, the Grand
Mufti of jerusalem.
Brinner said the Arab attitude
of "no negotiation, no recogni
tion, no peace," which was the
slogan of Arab leaders after the
1967 war, has prevented rap
prochement between the

groups.
Speaking on the current situa
tion of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO), Brinner said,
"Yasser Arafat has done a great
disservice to the cause of the
Palestinians." He described
Arafat as a vacillating leader
whose hands have been tied by
his attempts to find a consensus

within the PLO at all times.
Brinner also criticized the lead
ership of Israel. Israel is
"engaged in the de facto annexa
tion of the West Bank," he said.
"This poses the greatest dan
ger to the future of Israel," Brin
ner said, "because it would bring
about the creation of a binational
state."
He maintained that because of

the tendency for one group to
dominate another and because of
continued strife and trouble,
"binational states may be good in
theory, but they do not work."
Instead, Brinner said that "the
two very separate identities
necessitate two separate states."
Brinner also said that the Is
raelis are making a great mistake

by not recognizing and talking to
the PLO. He stressed the "need
for Israelis and Palestinians to sit
down together and talk."
In addition, Brinner mentioned
the Arab nations as a source of
problems for the Palestinians.
"When the time comes for
anything to be done, the Pales
tinians are abandoned by their
friends," Brinner said. He added
that the Arabs have never wanted
to see a Palestinian state and
cited the Syrian backing of the
dissident PLO forces as a current
example of this.
Commenting in more general
terms on the Mideast situation,
Brinner said that the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict is "only a
minor blip on the screen of his
tory" compared to other Mideast
conflicts, especially the Iran-Iraq
war.
He criticized the Western
media for failing to give adequate
attention to what he referred to
as "one of the bloodiest conflicts
that has taken place in the
modern world."
He also expressed dismay over
the lack of denunciation con
cerning the bombing of Tripoli
during the last week. He pointed
to a double standard in the
media, as shown by comparison
of the present seige of Tripoli
with the Israeli seige of Beirut in
the summer of 1982.

cited the Syrian backing of the
dissident PLO forces as a current
example of this.
Commenting in more general
terms on the Mideast situation,
Brinner said that the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict is "only a
minor blip on the screen of his
tory" compared to other Mideast
conflicts, especially the Iran-Iraq
war.
He criticized the Western
media for failing to give adequate
attention to what he referred to
as "one of the bloodiest conflicts
that has taken place in the
modern world."
He also expressed dismay over
the lack of denunciation con
cerning the bombing of Tripoli
during the last week. He pointed
to a double standard in the
media, as shown by comparison
of the present seige of Tripoli
with the Israeli seige of Beirut in
the summer of 1982.
