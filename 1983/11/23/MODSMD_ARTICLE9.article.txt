# GSA suffers from student apathy
## 
### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
The Graduate Student Association
(GSA) is dying in an ironic, Catch-22
fashion, because students believe
that the organization's successes
imply that it is healthy — when GSA
leaders say the group actually needs
student help desperately.
While realizing that "there has al
ways been a problem getting large
numbers of graduate students in
volved in the GSA," Association
Treasurer Eric Berg said that the sit
uation has become acute only
recently.
"Two years ago, we had a major
infusion of people and we were very
successful in attracting a fairly stable
group to work with the GSA," Berg
said. "Now, we have had difficulty
recruiting as many people as we
need to actually keep the organiza
tion running."
As an organization, Berg ex
plained that the GSA's role is
two-fold: to provide a source of
recreational and social activities for
graduate students, such as the
Grads-in-Common noon lunch
seminars, Friday happy hours and
Great Directors Films Series; and to
act as a lobbying and com
municative group.
Vet without the necessary five-or
six-person core group to plan and
execute the activities, most, in the
near future, will go undone.
"Things look pretty grim," Berg

said, "unless grad students under
stand how serious the situation is
and demonstrate that they are will
ing to get involved."
Both Berg and GSA president Dirk
Van Compernolle feel that the lack
of student involvement comes not
from disinterest but from grads not
realizing the need to help.
"We're worried as we do things in
the appearance of doing well," Berg
said, "people don't feel a need to
get involved. It's hard to convey to
people that there is a real need."
Even though they are "kind of
worried that we'll have to be put in
the situation to let the organization
collapse just to get people in," Berg
said the officers are not yet ready to
give up.
They are planning two sets ot
meetings for the near future, one
with grads who have been involved
in the past and who are now ex
pressing an interest and the other
with University and staff officials, in
order to gain insight and assistance
as to how to best help the ailing as
sociation.
Failing the success of these
meetings, the officers see no other
option than to go to a more limited
program.
"We will tailor our budget to
those things which pique our inter
est and from the success that those
type of activies have had in the
past," Compernolle said.
