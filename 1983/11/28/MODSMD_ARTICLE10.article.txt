## Hoover should prove charges 
### 
The following is an open letter to Hoover Institution
Director W. Glenn Campbell.
Recently the Stanford community was treated to the
spectacle of the White House, aided by you, publicly
questioning the word of the president of the Univer
sity, Donald Kennedy.
According to Edwin Meese, and contrary to Ken
nedy's account, Hoover's proposals for the Reagan li
brary complex and the Reagan center for public affairs
were secretly approved in principle by the University
administration almost two years ago, and reaffirmed in
January of this year.
Meese, citing what he apparently believes to be the
smoking gun in this little drama, refers to a January 1983
memo from you to Kennedy in which you express plea
sure that both you and Kennedy "enthusiastically en
dorsed the idea of a Reagan presidential library com
plex on the Stanford campus." According to Meese,
you spelled out three parts of the complex to Kennedy,
and the Kennedy-Campbell understanding was the
basis upon which the White House authorized the
preparation of the proposal.(Daily, Nov. 10)
We have here a classic contradiction between the
Meese-Campbell version of what happened and Ken
nedy's.
Surely this remarkable situation has no precedent in
the history of higher education:
The Pres/dent of- the United States rejecting as unac
ceptable an offer by Kennedy and the chair of the Board
of Trustees unless Hoover is given an administrative
role in the Reagan center for public affairs, complete
with leaks of private correspondence and allegations of
double-dealing that could seriously erode public confi
dence in the University.
When the White House quotes and paraphrases
private correspondence from you to Kennedy in which
it is suggested that the Stanford president reneged on
private understandings, and in which strong public in
timations are made of a double-cross, do you not think
it fair of people at Stanford to say to you: Produce the
evidence or retract the charges? Your actions and those
of Meese do a disservice not only to Kennedy; they
hold the University up to public ridicule and contempt.
This is obviously not good for Stanford's reputation
and, if my reading of the campus reaction is correct,
such unsubstantiated charges call further into question

the propriety of maintaining unchanged the relation
ship between Hoover and the University.
Why would anyone not affiliated with Hoover believe
your version of events?
Although Kennedy and I have been seriously at odds
for months over the Hoover issue — he is generally
acting in support of the Institution, I making the case
for getting Hoover out of politics — his good reputa
tion within the Stanford community needs no defense
from me. So far the reckless charges that have been
leveled at the University administration have not been
substantiated by the release of any supporting
documentation. Why? One can only conclude that
there is none.
Let us be clear as to what you would have to show to
make your case, on the off-chance that you may try. Be
cause the key conflict involves Hoover control of the
Reagan center for public affairs, you would have to
show that Kennedy in principle accepted such control,
not just that he was apprised of linkages among the
three parts of the package.
That issue involves the partisan political activities of
the Hoover Institution and the way in which these activ
ities endanger the University's claim to be a nonpar
tisan, nonpolitical, objective seeker of truth, on which
nothing less than our reputation and legitimacy are
based.
With you and the White House actively lobbying the
Board of Trustees on behalf of the Reagan complex,
with the dissemination of newspaper editorials attack
ing the president of the University with rhetoric that
borders on political pornography, with leaks of private
correspondence to the press before letters are even
delivered, and with the solicitation of favorable en
dorsements of the Reagan complex from U.S. senators,
the claims of the Hoover Institution that it is removed
from partisan and political activity ring even more hol
low than before.
Be that as it may, the Stanford community still awaits
a full and open discussion of these claims, a goal that is
systematically undermined when you and the White
House place the spotlight on the character of those
who raise issues, not on the substantive issues them
selves.
