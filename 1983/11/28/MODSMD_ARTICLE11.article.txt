# Viewpoint: John Ott
## Helpless: JFK and The Day After 
### 
I feel uneasy. My mind struggles
to make sense of this uneasiness,
probing, asking questions, attacking
the feeling as it would a calculus
problem, seeking an answer.
The media bombarded us last
week — promoting first the pro
gram that commemorated the 20th
anniversary of President Kennedy's
assassination, and then "The Day
After," the program that graphically
portrayed the consequences of nu
clear war. First Kennedy, then "The
Day After," then Kennedy, then
"The Day After," Kennedy, Day
After, Kennedy, Day After. . .
The separate images and words
begin to swirl and intertwine in my
mind, the gusts becoming a
whirlwind of questions and emo
tions. What is the connection? Why
have these two programs coincided,
assaulting our psyche? My mind's
first response — network's compe
tition for advertisers — is too facile.
Again I ask: What is the connection?
As I read excerpts from an article
that Arthur Hoppe wrote 20 years
ago, just after the assassination, I
think I begin to understand. Hoppe
describes a conversation he had
with his daughter, a conversation
filled with her worries and fears:
So I held her on my lap, the way
you do, and rocked her and said
everything would be all right. But
Jo n't know that it will be. I don't
k now . . .
What we have lost, (my daughter)
•nd I, is a focusing point, the ban
nster of the stairs ... And if hatred
id violence can snuff out the life of
he most powerful man in our
I vor/d - just like that - what of us?
What of us?. . .
Commentator after commentator
has lauded Kennedy's sense of
humor, his decency, and his almost
brash sense of self-confidence. They

tell of how, despite his blunders, he
inspired the country, instilled in us
the belief that "everything would be
all right/' that we could and did
make a difference. When the assas
sin's bullet pierced his chest, it
ripped through our hope, leaving a
gaping wound of self-doubt. We
turned to our succeeding presidents
and leaders to restore our self
confidence, but their actions — in
Vietnam, in Watergate, in
Iran — only infected our souls with
cynicism.
And now, confronted with the
spectre of nuclear annihilation, we
turn to find a president whose
cynicism exceeds our own, who
uses words of decency and compas
sion and consolation to mask his
acts of hatred and violence. But few
are consoled, even fewer are fooled.
None of his words — peacekeeper,
rescue mission, freedom
fighters — assuage our fears. We
are afraid that we are impotent,
helpless to stop our own destruc
tion.
My mind now sees the connection
that I sought. Kennedy's assassina
tion was our first collective experi
ence — as a nation — of helpless
ness. Many groups of us had suf
fered the spiritual decay of im
potence for years and years, but
never before had we as a nation felt
impotent. Events over the past 20
years have so exacerbated our sense
of helplessness that now, faced with
the prospect of nuclear annihilation,
many of us just give up: "If it comes,
it comes;" "I don't want to wor
ry about it, I just get too de
pressed;" "Why should I care,
nothing I can do will matter."
I personally choose not to give
up. I can't. I love life too much. As I
grew up, I watched as many of us

struggled and stopped the Vietnam
War, and I took hope. Now many
more of us are beginning to struggle
to stop this nuclear madness, and I
still have hope. I believe we can
create history, not just succumb to
it. I believe that our actions mat
ter — not just our large political
acts, but also our small personal acts
of human decency. Yet perhaps I
choose to struggle not only because
I have hope, but because I too am
afraid — afraid that if we do give up,
we will die long before the bombs
ever come.

are afraid that we are impotent,
helpless to stop our own destruc
tion.
My mind now sees the connection
that I sought. Kennedy's assassina
tion was our first collective experi
ence — as a nation — of helpless
ness. Many groups of us had suf
fered the spiritual decay of im
potence for years and years, but
never before had we as a nation felt
impotent. Events over the past 20
years have so exacerbated our sense
of helplessness that now, faced with
the prospect of nuclear annihilation,
many of us just give up: "If it comes,
it comes;" "I don't want to wor
ry about it, I just get too de
pressed;" "Why should I care,
nothing I can do will matter."
I personally choose not to give
up. I can't. I love life too much. As I
grew up, I watched as many of us

struggled and stopped the Vietnam
War, and I took hope. Now many
more of us are beginning to struggle
to stop this nuclear madness, and I
still have hope. I believe we can
create history, not just succumb to
it. I believe that our actions mat
ter — not just our large political
acts, but also our small personal acts
of human decency. Yet perhaps I
choose to struggle not only because
I have hope, but because I too am
afraid — afraid that if we do give up,
we will die long before the bombs
ever come.
