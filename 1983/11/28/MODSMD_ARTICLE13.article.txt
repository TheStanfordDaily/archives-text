# Football team needs a totem
## 
### 
What's in a totem? Will a football
team with any other name perform
the same?
Deep in the archives of pre
autogenic man, exists the notion
that a special relationship exists be
tween man and his universe. Man
used symbols and totems to psyc
hologically capture characteristics in
animals, plants and other life forms.
All human tribes, the ancestors of
autogenic man, organized them
selves, into subgroups called clans.
Induction into the clan occurred
during post pubescence. Individuals
in this age-set were called youth.
These youth would compete for en
rollment in schools, initiation camps
or colleges. In some cases initiation
camps were called farms.
In each of these initiation schools,
young adults were taught the wis
dom of the tribe — skills in the
trading market, human sexuality,
communication skills and political
bargaining. Herein, was the tradi
tion of the tribe imbibed.
Parents looked forward to their
youth attending these initiation
schools. Some saved money for
years hoping their offspring would
be inducted into the more pres
tigious schools or farms. After three
to five years of training, enrollees at
tended a rite du passage. No one
who has survived les rites could give
a consistent account, which led
anthropologists and psychohis
torians to believe that secret
societies within the schools mys
tified enrollees' experiences.
The most intriguing of all tradi
tions is that of the school totem. A
case study in Northern California
shows how pre-autogenic man used
symbols, plants and animals to
epitomize the life of the group at the
initiation farms. The farm studied
here was known as Stanford.
Competition between initiation
farms or schools were marked by
sports, a type of simulated war
game. The games were performed
predominantly by males. Each
farm's team would wear a tribal
color.
Analysis of the archival videotapes
of the Stanford clan has a particu
larly interesting history. Initially in
the farm's early history members

used the color cardinal as is primal
symbol, journalistic accounts refer
to them as Redshirts and Cardinals.
Unlike many of the other great
camps, the Stanfordians changed its
totem from time to time. Its ability
to win at the games was equally
variable.
The head of the Athletic Depart
ment applied various strategies in
attempts to create a consistent win
ning team. Fund raising provided
large scholarships to attract the best
team players, to hire tutors to assist
players when injured and unable to
attend classes, to build new
stadiums and locker rooms, to ob
tain business consultants and athlet
ic consultants — he called on every
one to find a solution to the prob
lem. Nevertheless, the team's wins
were sporadic and unpredictable.
In desperation, the athletic direc
tor invited a team of anthropologists
and psychohistorians to determine
if there were more subtle forces
causing the unpredictable defeats
and winning seasons.
Utilizing a combination of histori
cal analyses, ethnographic tech
niques and participant observation,
the social scientists determined the
contributing factor — the totem.
Participant observation in the
locker room ritual provided great in
sights. According to the
anthropologists' report, locker
room discussion among teams with
animal totems psychologically
prepared a winning effort in the
minds of the Cardinal's rivals. By no
means did Cardinal locker room talk
match Bear phrases, such as "Gorge
the Cardinals" or "Eat, mangle and
disassemble the Cardinals."
The need for such a symbol or
totem, arises when individuals em
barking upon a collective effort
must rise above their blood kin ties
and unite psychologically into one
unit for a winning effort. It was
believed that psychological unity
through the totemic symbol would
multiply the physical efforts of the
group. And, then the group would
perform as one awesome unit of in
telligent, physical force.
After reading the report, the
coach rumored the need for a new
symbol, or at least a complimentary

symbol. After great debates, the
Stanfordians adopted the
"Indian" — a general term sym
bolizing native people of the
Americas.
However, as the Indians, Stanford
never seriously threatened the
greatness of its formidable rivals
who had clan totem symbols such as
Bear, Bruins or Wildcats.
Once again the anthropologists
were summoned. Think-tanks on
the importance of totems and
totemisms to human organization
produced a plethora of seminars
and academic debates. Finally, there
was breakthrough in the work.
Reports showed that a team's wil
lingness to win was more likely to be
exhibited on more academically ori
ented farms by those teams with
animal totems. Animal totems that
embodied intelligence, strategy,
predation, patience, raw power,
prowessness, physical strength and
respect within the animal kingdom
and were more likely to motivate
even the more physically slight
players.
Names of human tribes should be
used as totems only if proper
respect and mutual respect could be
guaranteed between the clan and
the totem. In the case of the Indian
era, apparently ancestral spirits had
not been properly respected. Since
the term Indian applied to all native
American tribes, those with enmity
against Stanfordian ancestors would
not always offer the protection and
strength needed for a final winning
effort.
Rather than negotiate with local
Indian tribes, the Stanford clan
evoked the redwood tree as its sym
bol. During warm-up periods the
tree would do a ceremonial dance.
This evergreen tree, known for its
majesty and longevity would skip,
hop and dance during the halftime
ritual ceremony. However, the tree
never rendered the dignity and rev
erence that the Indian had when he
conducted his symbolic rites upon
the team at halftime. And the Stan
ford clan never maintained a great
sports history until it found another
totem.

and psychohistorians to determine
if there were more subtle forces
causing the unpredictable defeats
and winning seasons.
Utilizing a combination of histori
cal analyses, ethnographic tech
niques and participant observation,
the social scientists determined the
contributing factor — the totem.
Participant observation in the
locker room ritual provided great in
sights. According to the
anthropologists' report, locker
room discussion among teams with
animal totems psychologically
prepared a winning effort in the
minds of the Cardinal's rivals. By no
means did Cardinal locker room talk
match Bear phrases, such as "Gorge
the Cardinals" or "Eat, mangle and
disassemble the Cardinals."
The need for such a symbol or
totem, arises when individuals em
barking upon a collective effort
must rise above their blood kin ties
and unite psychologically into one
unit for a winning effort. It was
believed that psychological unity
through the totemic symbol would
multiply the physical efforts of the
group. And, then the group would
perform as one awesome unit of in
telligent, physical force.
After reading the report, the
coach rumored the need for a new
symbol, or at least a complimentary

symbol. After great debates, the
Stanfordians adopted the
"Indian" — a general term sym
bolizing native people of the
Americas.
However, as the Indians, Stanford
never seriously threatened the
greatness of its formidable rivals
who had clan totem symbols such as
Bear, Bruins or Wildcats.
Once again the anthropologists
were summoned. Think-tanks on
the importance of totems and
totemisms to human organization
produced a plethora of seminars
and academic debates. Finally, there
was breakthrough in the work.
Reports showed that a team's wil
lingness to win was more likely to be
exhibited on more academically ori
ented farms by those teams with
animal totems. Animal totems that
embodied intelligence, strategy,
predation, patience, raw power,
prowessness, physical strength and
respect within the animal kingdom
and were more likely to motivate
even the more physically slight
players.
Names of human tribes should be
used as totems only if proper
respect and mutual respect could be
guaranteed between the clan and
the totem. In the case of the Indian
era, apparently ancestral spirits had
not been properly respected. Since
the term Indian applied to all native
American tribes, those with enmity
against Stanfordian ancestors would
not always offer the protection and
strength needed for a final winning
effort.
Rather than negotiate with local
Indian tribes, the Stanford clan
evoked the redwood tree as its sym
bol. During warm-up periods the
tree would do a ceremonial dance.
This evergreen tree, known for its
majesty and longevity would skip,
hop and dance during the halftime
ritual ceremony. However, the tree
never rendered the dignity and rev
erence that the Indian had when he
conducted his symbolic rites upon
the team at halftime. And the Stan
ford clan never maintained a great
sports history until it found another
totem.

On The Cultural Scene
What's in a totem? Will a football
team with any other name perform
the same?
Deep in the archives of pre
autogenic man, exists the notion
that a special relationship exists be
tween man and his universe. Man
used symbols and totems to psyc
hologically capture characteristics in
animals, plants and other life forms.
All human tribes, the ancestors of
autogenic man, organized them
selves, into subgroups called clans.
Induction into the clan occurred
during post pubescence. Individuals
in this age-set were called youth.
These youth would compete for en
rollment in schools, initiation camps
or colleges. In some cases initiation
camps were called farms.
In each of these initiation schools,
young adults were taught the wis
dom of the tribe — skills in the
trading market, human sexuality,
communication skills and political
bargaining. Herein, was the tradi
tion of the tribe imbibed.
Parents looked forward to their
youth attending these initiation
schools. Some saved money for
years hoping their offspring would
be inducted into the more pres
tigious schools or farms. After three
to five years of training, enrollees at
tended a rite du passage. No one
who has survived les rites could give
a consistent account, which led
anthropologists and psychohis
torians to believe that secret
societies within the schools mys
tified enrollees' experiences.
The most intriguing of all tradi
tions is that of the school totem. A
case study in Northern California
shows how pre-autogenic man used
symbols, plants and animals to
epitomize the life of the group at the
initiation farms. The farm studied
here was known as Stanford.
Competition between initiation
farms or schools were marked by
sports, a type of simulated war
game. The games were performed
predominantly by males. Each
farm's team would wear a tribal
color.
Analysis of the archival videotapes
of the Stanford clan has a particu
larly interesting history. Initially in
the farm's early history members

used the color cardinal as is primal
symbol, journalistic accounts refer
to them as Redshirts and Cardinals.
Unlike many of the other great
camps, the Stanfordians changed its
totem from time to time. Its ability
to win at the games was equally
variable.
The head of the Athletic Depart
ment applied various strategies in
attempts to create a consistent win
ning team. Fund raising provided
large scholarships to attract the best
team players, to hire tutors to assist
players when injured and unable to
attend classes, to build new
stadiums and locker rooms, to ob
tain business consultants and athlet
ic consultants — he called on every
one to find a solution to the prob
lem. Nevertheless, the team's wins
were sporadic and unpredictable.
