Ignoring Big Game
In response to "Avoiding the Big
Came," (Daily, Nov. 21) I feel the
need to a assert that I, along with
many others did not, catastrophical
|y, "miss" the said "great social
event;" it simply never occurred to
me to attend the Stanford-UC-
Berkeley game.
I object to being classified as an

"unfortunate" — virtually
pitiable — member of the Stanford
community by virtue of my having
been, in my mind, fortunate
enough to have escaped the
throngs of the drunken, maddening
crowd deluging the football
stadium.
In the immortal words of G.
Cicero, "O Tempora, O
Mores!" — when the (allegedly)

intellectual strata of Sf iety sub
jugates the lofty ideals of a Stanford
education to blood-thirsty chant
ings a modern-day equivalent of the
bout between Theseus and the
Minataur? At least fn Athens, no
one was "sporting a 'Fuck Cal'
shirt."
