# Professor's commentary: Alphonse Juilland
## Confessions of a true Stanford conservative 
### 
Prof. Alphonse Juilland
began teaching at Stanford in
the fall of 1961, and became
chairman of the French and
Italian Department in 1973. He
served two 3-year terms,
stepped down for one, ~r -' • -
cepted the post again ,e,v.
luilland is the William isall
professor of French. Fie has
published many books, the
latest of which discusses the
language and style of the
French writer, Seline. Fie was
the founder and president
emeritus of the Stanford Con
servative Forum, and is cur
rently the executive editor of
the French and Italian reviews,
which he also founded.
It had to happen. What was
supposed to be a thoughtful
debate on the scholarly merits
of a presidential library com
plex at Stanford has
degenerated into a petty poli
tical quarrel triggered by
venomous attacks against
Stanford conservatives and
the alleged threat they repre
sent to the University.
Scores of professors oppose
the complex because it would
give the University a bad
image, i.e. a conservative
image. Some students "worry
that any further association
with the president may label
Stanford a conservative insti

tution." One of them "would
like to have Stanford known as
a great university rather than a
great conservative university."
English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz is afraid that if we accept
the complex, "We will come
to be perceived as the right
wing university of the West."
According to Political Science
Prof. John Manley, "We run
the risk of undermining the
University's reputation for in
dependence and objectivity,
on which our legitimacy as an
institution depends. If and
when the day arrives Stanford
will be known (as a place) to
get a good conservative edu

cation, not a good educa
tion."
I have news for Manley: The
dreaded day has come. In fact,
it came long ago. Like Har
vard, UC-Berkeley, Yale or
Princeton, our university no
longer provides simply "a
good education." What these
distinguished institutions pro
vide in abundance is an excel
lent Liberal education. Spell
Liberal with a capital L.
Skeptical? Consider that for
every incoming freshman who
declares himself/herself a
liberal or radical, at least two
profess to be middle-of-the
road or conservative. By the

end of their senior years, one
of the two incoming con
servatives has mutated into a
liberal graduate. How could it
be otherwise when practically
three out of every four profes
sors in our "first tier" univer
sities voted for George
McGovern?
Not reassured by the
massive Liberalism of those
who mold the ethos of our
students, Manley shudders at
the horrendous prospect that
under Hoover's pernicious in
fluence, the ratio of conserva
tive professors in the
humanities may grow from a
tolerable one out of every
twelve to a threatening one
out of eleven. So let me
reassure him: Reagan or no
Reagan, chances that
Hoover's machinations may
convert Stanford into a bas
tion of conservatism are slim
mer than my grandmother's
hopes for an Olympic medal
in Greco-Roman wrestling.
But instead of trying to con
vince you that conservatives
are no threat to Stanford's in
dependence, I'd rather tell
you what they did when the
independence of the Univer
sity was really at stake. Stan
ford's legitimacy as a free in
stitution was in jeopardy once
some 15 years ago, during the
so-called "campus revolt."

Gangs of radical goons
roamed all over the campus
breaking and burning, harass
ing, threatening and assault
ing those who had the im
pudence to differ. The most
active Stanford department
was the police department. At
tractive buildings on our love
ly campus looked like disaster
areas. Degree requirements
were disappearing under the
pressure of "unnegotiable
demands" for radical
"relevance." Departments -
were "reconstituted" by in
filtrators coming from God
knows where and by agents
provocateurs no one had seen
betore. While conservatives
were reduced to silence, most
liberals looked the other way.
A heavy cloud of conformity
and intolerance descended on
campus. The University as a
haven for the free exchange of
ideas was not merely
threatened: It was moribund.
With the fate of the Univer
sity at stake, a small group of
professors and a handful of
impetuous students got to
gether to conspire. We re
solved that it was time to stop
crying on each other's
shoulders and to act. As stu
dents who dared speak against
the hooligans who were being
assaulted, we organized
anemic "truth-sauads."

composed of middle-aged
professors, whose mission
was to confront the radicals at
the agitprop extravaganzas
they staged to bully their op
ponents into submission. Our
task was to speak out, to let
young people know that there
were truths other than the
truth of Mao, and other ways
of dealing with the world than
those of the terrorist and bul
ly. Unfortunately, we didn't

measure up, for our success
was meager.
We needed help. So we
switched tactics and founded
a phantomatic association we
grandiosely called a "Forum"
(its original membership could
squeeze into a telephone
booth.) Our purpose was to
make the Quad resound with
voices other than the shrill
voices of the Vandals.


Alphonse Juilland
Stronger voices, more per
suasive than our own, conser
vative voices, like William F.
Buckley's, Russel Kirk's, James
J. Kilpatrick's. The idea was to
confront conservative
speakers with panels of liberal
and radical critics, and let
them have a go at each other.
It was exciting, it was fun, and
it was edifying. People of all
political opinions flocked to
our meetings. Soon the Con
servative Forum became the
refuge and symbol of academ
ic freedom on our
beleaguered campus.
There were good times and
bad times on the way '.o 'he
Forum. Just before Buv
visit the atmosphere on
campus was explosive. We
had been warned
(anonymously, of course) that
the fascist pig would not be
allowed to desecrate the
Maoist sanctuary. Although
we took precautions to make
sure that Buckley would not
be harmed, we were tense and
apprehensive when he walked
slowly to the podium, alone,
deliberately unintroduced, in
menacing silence. Were
"they" going to let him speak?
Would there be violence?
Before Buckley could open his
mouth the packed audience of
supposedly "radicalized"
community stood up in
corpore and gave the fascist
pig a tumultuous ovation. In
that thunderous roar there
was a message: Academic
freedom was alive at Stanford!
Bad memories linger. Like

crawling on all fours in
Dinkelspiel's dark dusty base
ment, in flashlit search of
"pipe-like" objects (short
hand police description of
what we were to look for, as
bomb threats had been
pouring in throughout the
morning), while San Francisco
Mayor Joseph Alioto, Sen.
James Buckley, nobelist Joshua
Lederberg and our own John
McCarthy, former professor of
computer science, were

Like true con
servatives — i.e.,
neither militant nor
activist — we went
back to our trade,
not to be heard
again until last
spring's anti
conservative witch
hunt aroused us
once more.

furiously debating oil policy
above our heads. Crawling in
the dark next to me was a
young fireman, a student. All I
could hear was his staccato
breathing alternating with
mine, when suddenly he
broke the silence: "Sir," he
whispered, "would you mind
if I move behind you?" I
hesitated. But he was 20 and I
was 50, and I thought it was
only fair. "By all means," I
whispered back, and we kept
crawling on. Why we both
whispered, I'll never know.
Whatever we did we knew
we were doing something

right when our liberal presi
dent acknowledged that the
Conservative Forum was the
last place where genuine poli
tical debate could still be
heard on campus. We kept at
it and slowly the tide turned. A
few joined our ranks, more
started their own actions.
Timidly at first, peace and
freedom returned to the
campus. Ironically, by turning
in our favor, the Zeitgeist ren
dered our efforts superfluous,
the Forum obsolete. When
students invited Buckley to
speak on campus, we knew
that it was time to go home.
Like true conservatives — i.e.,
neither militant nor activist —
we went back to our trade, not
to be heard again until last
spring's anti-conservative
witch-hunt aroused us once

Lest you think I'm digress
ing, let me assure you that I
still have Manley's denigra
tions of conservatives in the
back of my mind. Where were
his cohorts when our univer
sity was under siege? Leading
the charge against the Infidel,
you may surmise. If so, refresh
my memory, for I do not re
member seeing many on the
barricades, nor can I recall the
echoes of their powerful rhet
oric denouncing the enemies
of tiiit academic freedom they
hold so dear. For champions
so fearless and articulate, they
were uncharacteristically
silent.
Does Stanford need Manley
to protect its independence
against the likes of me? Hard
ly. What Stanford needs to be
protected from is ideological
zealots and political
crusaders.

servatives has mutated into a
liberal graduate. How could it
be otherwise when practically
three out of every four profes
sors in our "first tier" univer
sities voted for George
McGovern?
Not reassured by the
massive Liberalism of those
who mold the ethos of our
students, Manley shudders at
the horrendous prospect that
under Hoover's pernicious in
fluence, the ratio of conserva
tive professors in the
humanities may grow from a
tolerable one out of every
twelve to a threatening one

reassure him: Reagan or no
Reagan, chances that
Hoover's machinations may
convert Stanford into a bas
tion of conservatism are slim
mer than my grandmother's
hopes for an Olympic medal
in Greco-Roman wrestling.
But instead of trying to con
vince you that conservatives
are no threat to Stanford's in
dependence, I'd rather tell
you what they did when the
independence of the Univer
sity was really at stake. Stan
ford's legitimacy as a free in
stitution was in jeopardy once
some 15 years ago, during the
so-called "campus revolt."

Gangs of radical goons
roamed all over the campus
breaking and burning, harass
ing, threatening and assault
ing those who had the im
pudence to differ. The most
active Stanford department
was the police department. At
tractive buildings on our love
ly campus looked like disaster
areas. Degree requirements
were disappearing under the
pressure of "unnegotiable
demands" for radical
"relevance." Departments -
were "reconstituted" by in
filtrators coming from God
knows where and by agents
provocateurs no one had seen
betore. While conservatives
were reduced to silence, most
liberals looked the other way.
A heavy cloud of conformity
and intolerance descended on
campus. The University as a
haven for the free exchange of
ideas was not merely
threatened: It was moribund.
With the fate of the Univer
sity at stake, a small group of
professors and a handful of
impetuous students got to
gether to conspire. We re
solved that it was time to stop
crying on each other's
shoulders and to act. As stu
dents who dared speak against
the hooligans who were being
assaulted, we organized
anemic "truth-sauads."

composed of middle-aged
professors, whose mission
was to confront the radicals at
the agitprop extravaganzas
they staged to bully their op
ponents into submission. Our
task was to speak out, to let
young people know that there
were truths other than the
truth of Mao, and other ways
of dealing with the world than
those of the terrorist and bul
ly. Unfortunately, we didn't

measure up, for our success
was meager.
We needed help. So we
switched tactics and founded
a phantomatic association we
grandiosely called a "Forum"
(its original membership could
squeeze into a telephone
booth.) Our purpose was to
make the Quad resound with
voices other than the shrill
voices of the Vandals.


Alphonse Juilland
Stronger voices, more per
suasive than our own, conser
vative voices, like William F.
Buckley's, Russel Kirk's, James
J. Kilpatrick's. The idea was to
confront conservative
speakers with panels of liberal
and radical critics, and let
them have a go at each other.
It was exciting, it was fun, and
it was edifying. People of all
political opinions flocked to
our meetings. Soon the Con
servative Forum became the
refuge and symbol of academ
ic freedom on our
beleaguered campus.
There were good times and
bad times on the way '.o 'he
Forum. Just before Buv
visit the atmosphere on
campus was explosive. We
had been warned
(anonymously, of course) that
the fascist pig would not be
allowed to desecrate the
Maoist sanctuary. Although
we took precautions to make
sure that Buckley would not
be harmed, we were tense and
apprehensive when he walked
slowly to the podium, alone,
deliberately unintroduced, in
menacing silence. Were
"they" going to let him speak?
Would there be violence?
Before Buckley could open his
mouth the packed audience of
supposedly "radicalized"
community stood up in
corpore and gave the fascist
pig a tumultuous ovation. In
that thunderous roar there
was a message: Academic
freedom was alive at Stanford!
Bad memories linger. Like

crawling on all fours in
Dinkelspiel's dark dusty base

"pipe-like" objects (short

what we were to look for, as

above our heads. Crawling in
the dark next to me was a
young fireman, a student. All I
could hear was his staccato
breathing alternating with
mine, when suddenly he
broke the silence: "Sir," he
whispered, "would you mind
if I move behind you?" I
hesitated. But he was 20 and I
was 50, and I thought it was
only fair. "By all means," I
whispered back, and we kept
crawling on. Why we both
whispered, I'll never know.
Whatever we did we knew
we were doing something

right when our liberal presi
dent acknowledged that the
Conservative Forum was the
last place where genuine poli
tical debate could still be
heard on campus. We kept at
it and slowly the tide turned. A
few joined our ranks, more
started their own actions.
Timidly at first, peace and
freedom returned to the
campus. Ironically, by turning
in our favor, the Zeitgeist ren
dered our efforts superfluous,
the Forum obsolete. When
students invited Buckley to
speak on campus, we knew
that it was time to go home.

Lest you think I'm digress
ing, let me assure you that I
still have Manley's denigra
tions of conservatives in the
back of my mind. Where were
his cohorts when our univer
sity was under siege? Leading
the charge against the Infidel,
you may surmise. If so, refresh
my memory, for I do not re
member seeing many on the
barricades, nor can I recall the
echoes of their powerful rhet
oric denouncing the enemies
of tiiit academic freedom they
hold so dear. For champions
so fearless and articulate, they
were uncharacteristically
silent.
Does Stanford need Manley
to protect its independence
against the likes of me? Hard
ly. What Stanford needs to be
protected from is ideological
zealots and political
crusaders.
Prof. Alphonse Juilland
began teaching at Stanford in
the fall of 1961, and became
chairman of the French and
Italian Department in 1973. He

French writer, Seline. Fie was
the founder and president

servative Forum, and is cur
rently the executive editor of
the French and Italian reviews,
which he also founded.
It had to happen. What was
supposed to be a thoughtful
debate on the scholarly merits
of a presidential library com
plex at Stanford has
degenerated into a petty poli
tical quarrel triggered by
venomous attacks against
Stanford conservatives and
the alleged threat they repre
sent to the University.
Scores of professors oppose
the complex because it would
give the University a bad
image, i.e. a conservative
image. Some students "worry
that any further association
with the president may label
Stanford a conservative insti

tution." One of them "would
like to have Stanford known as
a great university rather than a
great conservative university."
English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz is afraid that if we accept
the complex, "We will come
to be perceived as the right
wing university of the West."
According to Political Science
Prof. John Manley, "We run
the risk of undermining the
University's reputation for in
dependence and objectivity,
on which our legitimacy as an
institution depends. If and
when the day arrives Stanford
will be known (as a place) to
get a good conservative edu

cation, not a good educa
tion."
I have news for Manley: The
dreaded day has come. In fact,
it came long ago. Like Har
vard, UC-Berkeley, Yale or
Princeton, our university no
longer provides simply "a
good education." What these
distinguished institutions pro
vide in abundance is an excel
lent Liberal education. Spell
Liberal with a capital L.
Skeptical? Consider that for
every incoming freshman who
declares himself/herself a
liberal or radical, at least two
profess to be middle-of-the

was meager.
We needed help. So we
switched tactics and founded
a phantomatic association we
grandiosely called a "Forum"
(its original membership could
squeeze into a telephone
booth.) Our purpose was to

voices of the Vandals.

Stronger voices, more per
suasive than our own, conser
vative voices, like William F.
Buckley's, Russel Kirk's, James
J. Kilpatrick's. The idea was to
confront conservative
speakers with panels of liberal
and radical critics, and let
them have a go at each other.
It was exciting, it was fun, and
it was edifying. People of all
political opinions flocked to
our meetings. Soon the Con
servative Forum became the
refuge and symbol of academ
ic freedom on our
beleaguered campus.
There were good times and
bad times on the way '.o 'he
Forum. Just before Buv
visit the atmosphere on
campus was explosive. We
had been warned
(anonymously, of course) that
the fascist pig would not be
allowed to desecrate the
Maoist sanctuary. Although
we took precautions to make
sure that Buckley would not
be harmed, we were tense and
apprehensive when he walked
slowly to the podium, alone,
deliberately unintroduced, in
menacing silence. Were
"they" going to let him speak?
Would there be violence?
Before Buckley could open his
mouth the packed audience of
supposedly "radicalized"
community stood up in
corpore and gave the fascist
pig a tumultuous ovation. In
that thunderous roar there
was a message: Academic
freedom was alive at Stanford!
Bad memories linger. Like

above our heads. Crawling in
the dark next to me was a
young fireman, a student. All I
could hear was his staccato
breathing alternating with
mine, when suddenly he
broke the silence: "Sir," he
whispered, "would you mind
if I move behind you?" I
hesitated. But he was 20 and I
was 50, and I thought it was
only fair. "By all means," I
whispered back, and we kept
crawling on. Why we both
whispered, I'll never know.
Whatever we did we knew
we were doing something

right when our liberal presi
dent acknowledged that the
Conservative Forum was the
last place where genuine poli
tical debate could still be
heard on campus. We kept at
it and slowly the tide turned. A
few joined our ranks, more
started their own actions.
Timidly at first, peace and
freedom returned to the
campus. Ironically, by turning
in our favor, the Zeitgeist ren
dered our efforts superfluous,
the Forum obsolete. When
students invited Buckley to
speak on campus, we knew
that it was time to go home.

Lest you think I'm digress
ing, let me assure you that I
still have Manley's denigra
tions of conservatives in the
back of my mind. Where were
his cohorts when our univer
sity was under siege? Leading
the charge against the Infidel,
you may surmise. If so, refresh
my memory, for I do not re
member seeing many on the
barricades, nor can I recall the
echoes of their powerful rhet
oric denouncing the enemies
of tiiit academic freedom they
hold so dear. For champions
so fearless and articulate, they
were uncharacteristically
silent.
Does Stanford need Manley
to protect its independence
against the likes of me? Hard
ly. What Stanford needs to be
protected from is ideological
zealots and political
crusaders.
Prof. Alphonse Juilland
began teaching at Stanford in
the fall of 1961, and became
chairman of the French and
Italian Department in 1973. He
served two 3-year terms,
stepped down for one, ~r -' • -
cepted the post again ,e,v.
luilland is the William isall
professor of French. Fie has
published many books, the
latest of which discusses the
language and style of the
French writer, Seline. Fie was
the founder and president
emeritus of the Stanford Con
servative Forum, and is cur
rently the executive editor of
the French and Italian reviews,
which he also founded.
It had to happen. What was
supposed to be a thoughtful
debate on the scholarly merits
of a presidential library com
plex at Stanford has
degenerated into a petty poli
tical quarrel triggered by
venomous attacks against
Stanford conservatives and
the alleged threat they repre
sent to the University.
Scores of professors oppose
the complex because it would
give the University a bad
image, i.e. a conservative
image. Some students "worry
that any further association
with the president may label
Stanford a conservative insti

tution." One of them "would
like to have Stanford known as
a great university rather than a
great conservative university."
English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz is afraid that if we accept
the complex, "We will come
to be perceived as the right
wing university of the West."
According to Political Science
Prof. John Manley, "We run
the risk of undermining the
University's reputation for in
dependence and objectivity,
on which our legitimacy as an
institution depends. If and
when the day arrives Stanford
will be known (as a place) to
get a good conservative edu

cation, not a good educa
tion."
I have news for Manley: The
dreaded day has come. In fact,
it came long ago. Like Har
vard, UC-Berkeley, Yale or
Princeton, our university no
longer provides simply "a
good education." What these
distinguished institutions pro
vide in abundance is an excel
lent Liberal education. Spell
Liberal with a capital L.
Skeptical? Consider that for
every incoming freshman who
declares himself/herself a
liberal or radical, at least two
profess to be middle-of-the
road or conservative. By the

end of their senior years, one
of the two incoming con
servatives has mutated into a
liberal graduate. How could it
be otherwise when practically
three out of every four profes
sors in our "first tier" univer
sities voted for George
McGovern?
Not reassured by the
massive Liberalism of those
who mold the ethos of our
students, Manley shudders at
the horrendous prospect that
under Hoover's pernicious in
fluence, the ratio of conserva
tive professors in the
humanities may grow from a
tolerable one out of every
twelve to a threatening one
out of eleven. So let me
reassure him: Reagan or no
Reagan, chances that
Hoover's machinations may
convert Stanford into a bas
tion of conservatism are slim
mer than my grandmother's
hopes for an Olympic medal
in Greco-Roman wrestling.
But instead of trying to con
vince you that conservatives
are no threat to Stanford's in
dependence, I'd rather tell
you what they did when the
independence of the Univer
sity was really at stake. Stan
ford's legitimacy as a free in
stitution was in jeopardy once
some 15 years ago, during the
so-called "campus revolt."

Gangs of radical goons
roamed all over the campus
breaking and burning, harass
ing, threatening and assault
ing those who had the im
pudence to differ. The most
active Stanford department
was the police department. At
tractive buildings on our love
ly campus looked like disaster
areas. Degree requirements
were disappearing under the
pressure of "unnegotiable
demands" for radical
"relevance." Departments -
were "reconstituted" by in
filtrators coming from God
knows where and by agents
provocateurs no one had seen
betore. While conservatives
were reduced to silence, most
liberals looked the other way.
A heavy cloud of conformity
and intolerance descended on
campus. The University as a
haven for the free exchange of
ideas was not merely
threatened: It was moribund.
With the fate of the Univer
sity at stake, a small group of
professors and a handful of
impetuous students got to
gether to conspire. We re
solved that it was time to stop
crying on each other's
shoulders and to act. As stu
dents who dared speak against
the hooligans who were being
assaulted, we organized
anemic "truth-sauads."
