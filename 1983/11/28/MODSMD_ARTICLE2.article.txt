# Stanford experiment to blast off with shuttle
## 
### SAM DELSON 
Weather permitting, the space
shuttle Columbia will blast off at 8
a.m. today carrying a Stanford pro
fessor and an experiment prepared
by the University and Japanese
scholars.
NASA officials said yesterday that
questionable" weather might force
postponement of the launch. If the
mission doesn't take off before Dec.
5, it will have to wait until late
February.
Owen Garriott, a consulting pro
fessor of electrical engineering
here, will conduct electron detec
tion experiments and run the first
outer-space amateur radio during
the nine-day mission. He will also
operate an electron gun to study the
nature of the earth's upper atmo
sphere in a project designed by
Stanford scientists and Tatsu
Obayashi of the University of Tokyo.
The Stanford-Japanese electron
beam experiment will involve a
10,000-watt electron gun with a
diameter of 30 centimeters. The gun
will create an artificial aurora by
shooting electrons to an altitude of
approximately 220 miles.
The shuttle will also carry
Spacelab, the most expensive and
sophisticated research facility ever
sent into space.
The 17-ton, $1.1 billion Spacelab
contains equipment for more than
70 scientific experiments. It was
built by the European Space Agency.
Spacelab is a step toward the con
struction of a permanent manned
space station. It will return to earth
with the shuttle Dec. 7, but will be
re-used on future shuttle flights.
Today's launch will begin the
shuttle's ninth mission. The flight

will be the shuttle's longest, and the
six-man crew will be the largest ever
sent into space.
West German physicist Ulf Mer
bold will become the first foreigner
to fly on an American spacecraft. He
and Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology engineer Byron Lichtenberg
will also be the first non-astronauts
on an American space mission.
In another departure from previ
ous practice, the shuttle crew will be
divided into two three-man units
which will work on separate 12-hour
schedules. This setup will enable
the crew to conduct experiments for
24 hours a day for the first time.
Garriott is the crew's most experi
enced member, having spent 59
days in space in 1973 aboard Skylab
3. He spent a total of 13 hours on
three spacewalks during that flight.
John Young, the mission com
mander, will set a record by becom
ing the first man ever to fly five
space missions. Young spent 23
days in space on his four previous
flights.
The other members of the crew
will be pilot Brewster Shaw and mis

sion specialist Robert Parker.
Garriott will become the first man
to operate an amateur (Ham) radio
in outer space. He will send signals
to earth with a five-watt transmitter
for one hour on each of six days.
Ham operators around the world
will return messages to Garriott, and
he will acknowledge their signals.
"Owen told me he's particularly
looking forward to receiving a call
from W6YX, the Stanford amateur
radio club," said Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Oswald Villard.
"He's definitely looking for
messages from other operators in
the Bay Area," Villard added.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Peter
Banks said the Stanford-Japanese
experiment will measure how the
electrons affect the upper atmo
sphere and whether they generate
radio waves.
Lockheed Palo Alto Research Lab
oratories is conducting a low-light
television experiment that will help
determine the effect of the electron
beam.
