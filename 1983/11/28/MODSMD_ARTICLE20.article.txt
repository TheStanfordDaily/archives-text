## 115-74 win breaks school record Davis & Co. do some demolition work on Hawaii Pacific in opener 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
While the football team
spent the season setting new
lows for scoring too few
points, Stanford's basketball
team was busy breaking
records for scoring too many
in just its first game.
Shattering the Stanford
single-game team scoring
record, the Cardinal shel
lacked an undermanned and
overtired Hawaii Pacific team,
115-74, in a non-conference
game at Maples Pavilion Satur
day afternoon before 3713
fans.
The 115 points, the most
ever by a Stanford team,
eclipsed the old mark of 114

set in 1969 against Rochester.
That record, however, is
only safe until tonight when
the Cardinal, 1-0, meets lowly
Bemidgi State of Minnesota, 0-
3, at 7:30 p.m. in Maples.
The Stanford score is sure to
raise some eyebrows across
the nation, especially those of
Dean Smith, the coach of No.
1 ranked North Carolina which
is one of four teams in this
Friday and Saturday's Hewlett-
Packard Stanford Invitational
at Maples.
Should Stanford beat first
round opponent San Jose
State and North Carolina beat
Fordham, the Card would face
the top-rated Tar Heels Satur

day night in the tournament
final.
Against Hawaii Pacific,
which dropped to 5-3 on the
season, five Stanford players
scored at least 14 points in the
record effort. The fast
breaking Cardinal outshot
(.551 to .375), out-rebounded
(52-36) and generally out
everythinged the Sea War
riors, who were playing their
sixth game in eight days.
While at times the Sea War
riors played like they had
brought their war canoes but
forgot the paddles, Stanford
looked surprisingly sharp for
their first game of the season.
The Card defeated the lapan
National team, 91-77, Nov. 3 in
an exhibition game.
"We played well," an obvi
ously pleased Stanford Coach
Tom Davis said. "We moved
the ball well — as well this ear
ly in the season as any team
I've coached."
Stanford hoopsters assisted
21 of their 38 field goals, most
of which were easy lay-ins un
der the basket. Senior center
john Revelli led Card scorers
with 20 points, with All-
America candidate running
mate Keith Jones adding 19.
Davis got 14 points each
from forwards Steve Brown,
Hans Wichary and Earl Kober
lein, who last year averaged
9.8, 8.9 and 3.6 points per
game, respectively. Wichary,
who scored 12 of those 14 in
the first half, also swept the
boards for a team-high 11
rebounds.
"It (the game) proves we are
a better ballclub than we were
a year ago," Davis said. "The
other thing it proves is that
we're deeper."
One of the players Davis
brought off the bench was
freshman John Paye, the start
ing quarterback on Stanford's
football team. Paye, who
played behind Keith Ramee at
point guard and scored four
points in 12 minutes, didn't
start practicing with the team
until early last week since the
football season ended nine
days ago.
One reason Paye saw so
much floor time after so little
practice was the absence of
senior point guard Ricky
Lewis, who unexpectedly was
not suited up, let alone on the
bench, Saturday. Davis said he
did not know when Lewis
would return.
"What he (Paye) has done in

one week of practice is great,"
Davis said. "I think he's a bet
ter outside shooter than Keith
Ramee. But Ramee is a better
penetrator, so Paye adds a dif
ferent dimension to the
team.''
Paye and Ramee, who had
five assists in the game, led an
efficient Stanford fast break
that is different that the one
Davis used last year. "Paye
and Ramee did a tremendous
job getting the ball down
court," Davis said, "and
Ramee made some fabulous
passes."
Hawaii Pacific never led in
the game, although it tied
Stanford twice. That,
however, was at 2-2 and 4-4.
From then on, it was all Stan
ford.
Less than five minutes into
the game, the Card had scored
19 points, a pace that had
Stanford kept it up would have
given it 152 points on the day.
The Cardinal got its only scare
of the game when, with 12
minutes left in the first half,
the Sea Warriors ran off five
straight points to cut a 12-
point Card margin to 24-17.
After moving to a 51-31 lead
— its biggest in the first period
— on two Hans Wichary free
throws, Hawaii Pacific scored
10 of the final 13 points in the
half to make it 54-41 at the in
termission.
In the second half, the Sea


Rod Searcey/Daily
Stanford center John Revelli scored 20 points in just 22
minutes of playing time to lead Stanford to a 115-74 victory
over Hawaii Pacific on Saturday. Revelli did not appear to be
bothered by an ankle injury that sidelined him last year.


Greg Webb/Daily
Sophomore point guard Keith Ramee led an effective Stanford fast break by contributing a
game-high five steals. He also had eight points and three assists in Saturday's contest.
Warriors pulled to within nine
points at 62-51 with 17 minutes
left. But in a span of 4:30,
Stanford tallied 14 un
answered points to make it 76-
51 and then, two minutes
later, reeled off 11 more to
blow the game wide open at
93-59. In all, the Card out
scored its opponents from
Hawaii 61-33 in the second
half.
Stanford topped the 100-
point mark — the first time in
five years — with 3:46 to go
and it was time for the shock
troops. Or, in other words, it
was time for little-used
reserves like Neil johnson,
Kent Seymour, John
"Scooter" Williams and
Charles Schwager to let the
regulars take early showers.
All 16 suited Cardinals
played, and all but three of
them scored.
For the Sea Warriors, junior
forward Eric Gable scored a
game-high 26 points, 16 of
them in the first half, and
senior guard Rick Wozeniak
added 19. lunior guard Patrick
Davis pulled down seven
rebounds.

"I think that's a better
Hawaii Pacific ballclub than
the final score showed," said
Davis, noting that the Sea
Warriors will have a chance for
revenge when they host Stan
ford Dec. 22 in Honolulu.
"They were tired," Davis
added. "When you have a lot
of fouls (Hawaii Pacific had
37), that shows there is a
fatigue factor out there."
Stanford was able to capi
talize on the Sea Warriors
fouls, sinking 39 of 50 free
throw attempts and almost
breaking another school
record. The Stanford record
for single-game free throw at
tempts is 51 and for free
throws made is 40.
In comparision, the Sea
Warriors had 16 free throw
tries since Stanford fouled
only 18 times. Eight Hawaii
Pacific players had four or
more personal fouls at game's
end to the Cardinal's two.
Revelli, although he was 7-
of-9 from the field and 6-of-9
from the line, admitted he is
not completely tuned.
"Physically, I feel really
good," he said. "But its the
little things that aren't there
yet. So I think each time I go
out there and play I feel a little
better. I think it will come to
gether soon."

Revelli missed a good deal
of the Pacific-10 Conference
season last year with a knee in
jury, but his knee appeared
to be at full strength Saturday
although he wore a light, pro
tective brace.
Hoop notes
Besides Paye, two other
football players are expected
to be under Davis' tutelage
this season — receiver Emile
Harry and defensive back Dar
rell Crissum. Harry, recover
ing from a shoulder injury in
curred during football, will be
at practice today, Davis said.
Grissum's status is still un
known, as he still is recuperat
ing from a serious back injury
he suffered in the Big Game
against UC-Berkeley.
Before Saturday, the last
time a Stanford basketball
team scored more than 100
points in a game was in 1978, a
103-81 victory over Harvard.
With Davis' commitment to
fast breaking more often,
Stanford has an excellent shot
at shattering the season
record average for points per
game of 75.8 it set last vear.
The 41-point victory margin
in Saturday's game was the
fourth largest in Stanford his
tory.

freshman John Paye, the start
ing quarterback on Stanford's
football team. Paye, who
played behind Keith Ramee at
point guard and scored four
points in 12 minutes, didn't
start practicing with the team
until early last week since the
football season ended nine
days ago.
One reason Paye saw so
much floor time after so little
practice was the absence of
senior point guard Ricky
Lewis, who unexpectedly was
not suited up, let alone on the
bench, Saturday. Davis said he
did not know when Lewis
would return.
"What he (Paye) has done in

one week of practice is great,"
Davis said. "I think he's a bet
ter outside shooter than Keith
Ramee. But Ramee is a better
penetrator, so Paye adds a dif
ferent dimension to the
team.''
Paye and Ramee, who had
five assists in the game, led an
efficient Stanford fast break
that is different that the one
Davis used last year. "Paye
and Ramee did a tremendous
job getting the ball down
court," Davis said, "and
Ramee made some fabulous
passes."
Hawaii Pacific never led in
the game, although it tied
Stanford twice. That,
however, was at 2-2 and 4-4.
From then on, it was all Stan
ford.
Less than five minutes into
the game, the Card had scored
19 points, a pace that had
Stanford kept it up would have
given it 152 points on the day.
The Cardinal got its only scare
of the game when, with 12
minutes left in the first half,
the Sea Warriors ran off five
straight points to cut a 12-
point Card margin to 24-17.
After moving to a 51-31 lead
— its biggest in the first period
— on two Hans Wichary free
throws, Hawaii Pacific scored
10 of the final 13 points in the
half to make it 54-41 at the in
termission.
In the second half, the Sea


Rod Searcey/Daily
Stanford center John Revelli scored 20 points in just 22
minutes of playing time to lead Stanford to a 115-74 victory
over Hawaii Pacific on Saturday. Revelli did not appear to be
bothered by an ankle injury that sidelined him last year.


Greg Webb/Daily
Sophomore point guard Keith Ramee led an effective Stanford fast break by contributing a
game-high five steals. He also had eight points and three assists in Saturday's contest.
Warriors pulled to within nine
points at 62-51 with 17 minutes
left. But in a span of 4:30,
Stanford tallied 14 un
answered points to make it 76-
51 and then, two minutes
later, reeled off 11 more to
blow the game wide open at
93-59. In all, the Card out
scored its opponents from
Hawaii 61-33 in the second
half.
Stanford topped the 100-
point mark — the first time in
five years — with 3:46 to go
and it was time for the shock
troops. Or, in other words, it
was time for little-used
reserves like Neil johnson,
Kent Seymour, John
"Scooter" Williams and
Charles Schwager to let the
regulars take early showers.
All 16 suited Cardinals
played, and all but three of
them scored.
For the Sea Warriors, junior
forward Eric Gable scored a
game-high 26 points, 16 of
them in the first half, and
senior guard Rick Wozeniak
added 19. lunior guard Patrick
Davis pulled down seven
rebounds.

"I think that's a better
Hawaii Pacific ballclub than
the final score showed," said
Davis, noting that the Sea
Warriors will have a chance for
revenge when they host Stan
ford Dec. 22 in Honolulu.
"They were tired," Davis
added. "When you have a lot
of fouls (Hawaii Pacific had
37), that shows there is a
fatigue factor out there."
Stanford was able to capi
talize on the Sea Warriors
fouls, sinking 39 of 50 free
throw attempts and almost
breaking another school
record. The Stanford record
for single-game free throw at
tempts is 51 and for free
throws made is 40.
In comparision, the Sea
Warriors had 16 free throw
tries since Stanford fouled
only 18 times. Eight Hawaii
Pacific players had four or
more personal fouls at game's
end to the Cardinal's two.
Revelli, although he was 7-
of-9 from the field and 6-of-9
from the line, admitted he is
not completely tuned.
"Physically, I feel really
good," he said. "But its the
little things that aren't there
yet. So I think each time I go
out there and play I feel a little
better. I think it will come to
gether soon."

Revelli missed a good deal
of the Pacific-10 Conference
season last year with a knee in
jury, but his knee appeared
to be at full strength Saturday
although he wore a light, pro
tective brace.
Hoop notes
Besides Paye, two other
football players are expected
to be under Davis' tutelage
this season — receiver Emile
Harry and defensive back Dar
rell Crissum. Harry, recover
ing from a shoulder injury in
curred during football, will be
at practice today, Davis said.
Grissum's status is still un
known, as he still is recuperat
ing from a serious back injury
he suffered in the Big Game
against UC-Berkeley.
Before Saturday, the last
time a Stanford basketball
team scored more than 100
points in a game was in 1978, a
103-81 victory over Harvard.
With Davis' commitment to
fast breaking more often,
Stanford has an excellent shot
at shattering the season
record average for points per
game of 75.8 it set last vear.
The 41-point victory margin
in Saturday's game was the
fourth largest in Stanford his
tory.


Greg Webb/Daily
Stanford forward Hans Wichary took the pressure off of center John Revelli by snagging 11
rebounds against Hawaii Pacific on Saturday.
While the football team
spent the season setting new
lows for scoring too few
points, Stanford's basketball
team was busy breaking
records for scoring too many
in just its first game.
Shattering the Stanford
single-game team scoring
record, the Cardinal shel
lacked an undermanned and
overtired Hawaii Pacific team,
115-74, in a non-conference
game at Maples Pavilion Satur
day afternoon before 3713
fans.
The 115 points, the most
ever by a Stanford team,
eclipsed the old mark of 114

set in 1969 against Rochester.
That record, however, is
only safe until tonight when
the Cardinal, 1-0, meets lowly
Bemidgi State of Minnesota, 0-
3, at 7:30 p.m. in Maples.
The Stanford score is sure to
raise some eyebrows across
the nation, especially those of
Dean Smith, the coach of No.
1 ranked North Carolina which
is one of four teams in this
Friday and Saturday's Hewlett-
Packard Stanford Invitational
at Maples.
Should Stanford beat first
round opponent San Jose
State and North Carolina beat
Fordham, the Card would face
the top-rated Tar Heels Satur

day night in the tournament
final.
Against Hawaii Pacific,
which dropped to 5-3 on the
season, five Stanford players
scored at least 14 points in the
record effort. The fast
breaking Cardinal outshot
(.551 to .375), out-rebounded
(52-36) and generally out
everythinged the Sea War
riors, who were playing their
sixth game in eight days.
While at times the Sea War
riors played like they had
brought their war canoes but
forgot the paddles, Stanford
looked surprisingly sharp for
their first game of the season.
The Card defeated the lapan
National team, 91-77, Nov. 3 in
an exhibition game.
"We played well," an obvi
ously pleased Stanford Coach
Tom Davis said. "We moved
the ball well — as well this ear
ly in the season as any team
I've coached."
Stanford hoopsters assisted
21 of their 38 field goals, most
of which were easy lay-ins un
der the basket. Senior center
john Revelli led Card scorers
with 20 points, with All-
America candidate running
mate Keith Jones adding 19.
Davis got 14 points each
from forwards Steve Brown,
Hans Wichary and Earl Kober
lein, who last year averaged
9.8, 8.9 and 3.6 points per
game, respectively. Wichary,
who scored 12 of those 14 in
the first half, also swept the
boards for a team-high 11
rebounds.
"It (the game) proves we are
a better ballclub than we were
a year ago," Davis said. "The
other thing it proves is that
we're deeper."

troops. Or, in other words, it
was time for little-used
reserves like Neil johnson,
Kent Seymour, John
"Scooter" Williams and
Charles Schwager to let the
regulars take early showers.
All 16 suited Cardinals
played, and all but three of
them scored.
For the Sea Warriors, junior
forward Eric Gable scored a
game-high 26 points, 16 of
them in the first half, and
senior guard Rick Wozeniak
added 19. lunior guard Patrick
Davis pulled down seven
rebounds.

"I think that's a better
Hawaii Pacific ballclub than
the final score showed," said
Davis, noting that the Sea
Warriors will have a chance for
revenge when they host Stan
ford Dec. 22 in Honolulu.
"They were tired," Davis
added. "When you have a lot
of fouls (Hawaii Pacific had
37), that shows there is a
fatigue factor out there."
Stanford was able to capi
talize on the Sea Warriors
fouls, sinking 39 of 50 free
throw attempts and almost
breaking another school
record. The Stanford record
for single-game free throw at
tempts is 51 and for free
throws made is 40.
In comparision, the Sea
Warriors had 16 free throw
tries since Stanford fouled
only 18 times. Eight Hawaii
Pacific players had four or
more personal fouls at game's
end to the Cardinal's two.
Revelli, although he was 7-
of-9 from the field and 6-of-9
from the line, admitted he is
not completely tuned.
"Physically, I feel really
good," he said. "But its the
little things that aren't there
yet. So I think each time I go
out there and play I feel a little
better. I think it will come to
gether soon."

Revelli missed a good deal
of the Pacific-10 Conference
season last year with a knee in
jury, but his knee appeared
to be at full strength Saturday
although he wore a light, pro
tective brace.
Hoop notes
Besides Paye, two other
football players are expected
to be under Davis' tutelage
this season — receiver Emile
Harry and defensive back Dar
rell Crissum. Harry, recover
ing from a shoulder injury in
curred during football, will be
at practice today, Davis said.
Grissum's status is still un
known, as he still is recuperat
ing from a serious back injury
he suffered in the Big Game
against UC-Berkeley.
Before Saturday, the last
time a Stanford basketball
team scored more than 100
points in a game was in 1978, a
103-81 victory over Harvard.
With Davis' commitment to
fast breaking more often,
Stanford has an excellent shot
at shattering the season
record average for points per
game of 75.8 it set last vear.
The 41-point victory margin
in Saturday's game was the
fourth largest in Stanford his
tory.

Stanford forward Hans Wichary took the pressure off of center John Revelli by snagging 11
rebounds against Hawaii Pacific on Saturday.
While the football team
spent the season setting new
lows for scoring too few
points, Stanford's basketball
team was busy breaking
records for scoring too many
in just its first game.
Shattering the Stanford
single-game team scoring
record, the Cardinal shel
lacked an undermanned and
overtired Hawaii Pacific team,
115-74, in a non-conference
game at Maples Pavilion Satur
day afternoon before 3713
fans.
The 115 points, the most
ever by a Stanford team,
eclipsed the old mark of 114

set in 1969 against Rochester.
That record, however, is
only safe until tonight when
the Cardinal, 1-0, meets lowly
Bemidgi State of Minnesota, 0-
3, at 7:30 p.m. in Maples.
The Stanford score is sure to
raise some eyebrows across
the nation, especially those of
Dean Smith, the coach of No.
1 ranked North Carolina which
is one of four teams in this
Friday and Saturday's Hewlett-
Packard Stanford Invitational
at Maples.
Should Stanford beat first
round opponent San Jose
State and North Carolina beat
Fordham, the Card would face
the top-rated Tar Heels Satur

day night in the tournament
final.
Against Hawaii Pacific,
which dropped to 5-3 on the
season, five Stanford players
scored at least 14 points in the
record effort. The fast
breaking Cardinal outshot
(.551 to .375), out-rebounded
(52-36) and generally out
everythinged the Sea War
riors, who were playing their
sixth game in eight days.
While at times the Sea War
riors played like they had
brought their war canoes but
forgot the paddles, Stanford
looked surprisingly sharp for
their first game of the season.
The Card defeated the lapan
National team, 91-77, Nov. 3 in
an exhibition game.
"We played well," an obvi
ously pleased Stanford Coach
Tom Davis said. "We moved
the ball well — as well this ear
ly in the season as any team
I've coached."
Stanford hoopsters assisted
21 of their 38 field goals, most
of which were easy lay-ins un
der the basket. Senior center
john Revelli led Card scorers
with 20 points, with All-
America candidate running
mate Keith Jones adding 19.
Davis got 14 points each
from forwards Steve Brown,
Hans Wichary and Earl Kober
lein, who last year averaged
9.8, 8.9 and 3.6 points per
game, respectively. Wichary,
who scored 12 of those 14 in
the first half, also swept the
boards for a team-high 11
rebounds.
"It (the game) proves we are
a better ballclub than we were
a year ago," Davis said. "The
other thing it proves is that
we're deeper."
One of the players Davis
brought off the bench was
freshman John Paye, the start
ing quarterback on Stanford's
football team. Paye, who
played behind Keith Ramee at
point guard and scored four
points in 12 minutes, didn't
start practicing with the team
until early last week since the
football season ended nine
days ago.
One reason Paye saw so
much floor time after so little
practice was the absence of
senior point guard Ricky
Lewis, who unexpectedly was
not suited up, let alone on the
bench, Saturday. Davis said he
did not know when Lewis
would return.
"What he (Paye) has done in

one week of practice is great,"
Davis said. "I think he's a bet
ter outside shooter than Keith
Ramee. But Ramee is a better
penetrator, so Paye adds a dif
ferent dimension to the
team.''
Paye and Ramee, who had
five assists in the game, led an
efficient Stanford fast break
that is different that the one
Davis used last year. "Paye
and Ramee did a tremendous
job getting the ball down
court," Davis said, "and
Ramee made some fabulous
passes."
Hawaii Pacific never led in
the game, although it tied
Stanford twice. That,
however, was at 2-2 and 4-4.
From then on, it was all Stan
ford.
Less than five minutes into
the game, the Card had scored
19 points, a pace that had
Stanford kept it up would have
given it 152 points on the day.
The Cardinal got its only scare
of the game when, with 12
minutes left in the first half,
the Sea Warriors ran off five
straight points to cut a 12-
point Card margin to 24-17.
After moving to a 51-31 lead
— its biggest in the first period
— on two Hans Wichary free
throws, Hawaii Pacific scored
10 of the final 13 points in the
half to make it 54-41 at the in
termission.
In the second half, the Sea


Rod Searcey/Daily
Stanford center John Revelli scored 20 points in just 22
minutes of playing time to lead Stanford to a 115-74 victory
over Hawaii Pacific on Saturday. Revelli did not appear to be
bothered by an ankle injury that sidelined him last year.


Greg Webb/Daily
Sophomore point guard Keith Ramee led an effective Stanford fast break by contributing a
game-high five steals. He also had eight points and three assists in Saturday's contest.
Warriors pulled to within nine
points at 62-51 with 17 minutes
left. But in a span of 4:30,
Stanford tallied 14 un
answered points to make it 76-
51 and then, two minutes
later, reeled off 11 more to
blow the game wide open at
93-59. In all, the Card out
scored its opponents from
Hawaii 61-33 in the second
half.
Stanford topped the 100-
point mark — the first time in
five years — with 3:46 to go
