# Bemidji State is next for Card

Who the hell is Bemidji State?
For starters, Bemidji State is Stanford's basketball op
ponent tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Bemidji State is a university in Minnesota with an enroll
ment of 4300. Its mascot is the Beaver, its colors are kelly
and white and its home court is the 3000-seat John S. Clas
Arena.
The Bemidji State campus is in, you guessed it, Bemidji,
Minn., a small town north of Minneapolis located on
Route 2 between Bagley and Cass Lake.
The Beavers are members of both the NCAA Division II
and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics
(NAIA). They play in the Northern Intercollegiate Confer
ence against teams like Moorhead State, Northern State,
Southwest State and Winona State. Bemidji State was 11-17
overall last year and 4-8 in league play.
The coach's name is Karl Salscheider. His assistants are
Jim Edmonds and Brian Onken. The athletic director is Dr.
John Peterson.
Bemidji State, as the name indicates, is no basketball
power.
"They did not get off to a strong start," said Stanford
Coach Tom Davis, who guided the Cardinal to a season
opening 115-74 win over Hawaii Pacific Saturday. "So I
don't expect too much from them."
To be sure, the Beavers haven't exactly been tearing up
the nets in the early going this season and are still looking
for their first win at 0-3.
Bemidji State took fourth in the four-team Eau Claire
Classic in Wisconsin last week, losing to Loras, 64-59, and
then to Augsberg, 69-68, on a pair of last-second free
throws. The Beavers suffered their third setback in as
many games last Saturday night, an 86-66 loss to UC-Santa
Barbara as part of their two-game West Coast road trip.

Making things worse for the Beavers is their problem
with winning away from home. Dating back to last season,
Bemidji State is 9-3 at home and a miserable 2-17 on the
road.
The Beavers are expected to start a senior, three juniors
and a freshman against Stanford tonight â€” 6-foot-7 senior
center Ivory Davis, 6-0 junior guard Bobby Johnson, 5-9
junior guard John Sanders, 6-5 junior forward David Heiss
and 6-5 freshman forward Steve Johnson.
Heiss and Johnson so far have been the big guns for the
Beavers. Heiss scored 17 points against Augsberg while
Johnson tallied 15 against Loras and 21 against Augsberg.
One more note about the Beavers: Rumors claiming
that whoever can correctly spell "Bemidji" will get in free
to tonight's game are not true.
