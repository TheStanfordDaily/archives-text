# Paye: from cleats to Converse

### ADAM BERNS 
Stanford freshman John Paye does not seem to be con
tent to be a star of the future. He wants to have impact
now.
And if last Saturday's basketball game is any indication,
the football field is not enough for him. The Cardinal quar
terback may also play a major role on the indoor court.
Backing up sophomore point guard Keith Ramee, Paye
scored four points, had three assists and added three
rebounds in the contest against Hawaii-Pacific, while log
ging 12 minutes of playing time.
"He's right behind Ramee," Stanford Coach Tom Davis
said after the game. "I think that that is where he
belongs."
While most of the basketball team has been practicing
the last two months, Paye has been out throwing footballs.
Paye only showed up to basketball practice a week ago
today but did not play. He then worked out with the team
for the rest ot the week, although Friday's practice was
light.
What you saw out there is what he's done in only one
week of practice, Davis said. "Every day he was able to
improve."
Davis himselt admitted that this whole situation has
taken him a little by surprise. "I've never had to deal with
this kind of situation before," he said.
Following Saturday's game, Paye talked about the ad
justment from football to basketball.
"It was a little bit different being out there on the bas
ketball court, Paye said. "There was a mental adjustment
that I had to make going to a whole new concept."

Although Paye has not had a chance to play basketball
the past few months, he said he had not forgotten the
sport altogether. "The whole year I have had a basketball
in my room," he said.
According to Paye, one of the big differences between
the two sports is the amount of pressure on him. He
became the starting quarterback of the football team and a
lot was expected of him, but the expectations for him are
not as great on the basketball team.
Paye said he feels he is playing well considering the
small amount of practice time he has had, but he adds that
there is plenty of room for improvement.
"I was pleased with the way that I've shot in practice and
I kind of felt OK on offense (during the game)/' Paye said
following Saturday's contest. "But on defense, I need
more practice."
One of the more humorous examples of Paye's inex
perience on defense occurred in the second half of Satur
day's game when Davis called a complicated zone
defense. The problem: The team had not worked on the
defense since Paye joined practice on Monday.
"He (Davis) told me to fake it," Paye said about the
defense. "After a play went by, he took me out."
Besides keeping him out of preseason practice, football
has had one other effect on Paye. It has forced him to
change (at least temporarily) from his underhand style of
shooting free throws because his sore shoulder does not
permit him to fully extend his arms.
It didn't bother Paye on Saturday, however. Both his
overhand free throw tries swished perfectly through the
hoops.
