# Despite recent break-ins, LOTS security system stands fast
## 
### BOB BARCKLAY Staff writer 
The alleged recent intrusion into the Uni
versity's computer system by a UCLA soph
omore has had no noticeable effect on the
security at the LOTS computer facility, and
officials there say the current safeguards
are "completely adequate" for the kind of
work done on the system.
Ronald Austin, 19, was arrested Nov. 2
and charged with infiltrating a Defense De
partment computer network. Representa
tives of the Los Angeles District Attorney's
Office also charge Austin with infiltrating
Stanford's system .
LOTS officials stumble upon an average
of one "break-in" or infraction a day, ac
cording to student coordinator Greg Ching.
But manager Bob Knight said administrators
there "don't try to function in the role of
policemen."
Knight said the occasional discoveries of
students or persons not affiliated with Stan
ford misusing the system are not the result
of a determined search. "We don't actively
look for infractions," he said.
Officially, it is an Honor Code violation to

know a person's password, but Frank
Chen, a computer science teaching assis
tant, said most violations are dealt with by
talking to the person responsible and in
forming him that he is doing something
wrong.
The two most common violations, accor
ding to LOTS officials, are breaking into an
other person's account and fraudulently ac
quiring more computer time than is al
lotted.
Breaking into an account requires
knowing someone's account password in
order to gain access to the system. Guess
ing a password is extremely difficult be
cause the computer allows only five at
tempts before it refuses to allow a user onto
the system.
Ching said this type of infraction can be
discovered in a number of ways. He told of
an incident in which a woman was sitting at
a terminal that was logged into an account
belonging to a man.
Another method entails looking at a log
of the system's use. Knight said it is possi
ble for a user to "connect" to another's ac
count, and this will show up on the sys

tern's log. If the user does not have this
specific "privilege," connecting to another
person's account is a violation of system
rules.
Some students try to acquire extra com
puter time by declaring that they are en
rolled in more computer classes than they
have actually registered for. Hence, more
time is given them to complete the larger
number of programming assignments.
While students sometimes get away with
this for a few weeks, they are always found
out once the final study list is published, of
ficials said.
Another way to acquire extra time is to
open an account using the name and stu
dent identification number of someone
who is not already using the system.
Ching said this is discovered when a per
son whose name has been used attempts to
get an account at LOTS only to find that his
name has already been used.
Those interviewed all agreed that while it
is possible to get away with some violations
for a while, those misusing the system will
eventually make themselves known.
