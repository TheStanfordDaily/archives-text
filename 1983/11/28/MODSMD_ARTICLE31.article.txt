# Card women topple SJS
## 
### JOHN LIS 
Sophomore guard Virginia
Sourlis hit two clutch free
throws with only seven
seconds remaining to give the
Stanford women's basketball
team a 73-72 come-from
behind victory over host San
Jose State Friday night.
Sourlis's foul shots capped a
last minute charge by the Car
dinal that saw San Jose State
miss two critical free throws to
give the Cardinal life. Leading
71-69 with 45 seconds to play,
the Spartans' Sheila Brown
could convert only the front
end of a one-and-one situa
tion following Sourlis' fourth
foul of the contest and a Stan
ford timeout.
Stanford got the ball back
trailing 72-69, and junior for
ward Mary Bradach scored for
the Card to cut the lead to 72-
71 with 25 seconds remaining.
After a San Jose State timeout,
Stanford applied heavy pres
sure on the ensuing inbound
attempt and appeared to have
forced a turnover, but the offi
cials awarded the Spartans the
ball.
San Jose State successfully
inbounded this time, and
Bradach was forced to foul
Brown with 12 seconds left.
This time she missed the front
end of the bonus, and the en
suing rebound came out to
Sourlis. The Cardinal's 5-2
captain took off on an end-to
end drive, drawing a foul and
converting the two shots that
gave the Cardinal the lead.
San Jose State inbounded
and called timeout at mid
court with four seconds left.
Following a second timeout,
the Spartans had a long in
bound pass and then got the
ball to Brown, but time
expired before she could un
load a desperation shot:
Stanford had four starters in
double figures. Sophomore
center Sarah Evans paced the
Cardinal with 21 points and 13
rebounds, followed by

Bradach with 18 points and
eight rebounds. Sourlis
finished with 16 points, and
freshman forward Kim Mercer
had 11. Sourlis also had five
steals, while freshman guard
Erica Mueser dished off nine
assists.
San )ose State, which led 38-
37 at halftime, was paced by
Brown's 19 points and six
rebounds.
Stanford Head Coach Dotty
McCrea was pleased with the
performance of her young
team. "I couldn't get over the
amount of poise our freshmen
showed out there," she said.
"I'm happy with the way we

just kept coming at them. It's
really kind of an upset for us."
McCrea's squad hoped to
keep the Spartans out of their
running game and succeeded
for the most part. "We did a
good job of keeping to our
game plan — slowing it down
and keeping them out of their
transition game."
The Cardinal improved its
record to 2-1 on the season.
They will host the University
of the Pacific tomorrow night
in Maples Pavilion before
flying to Las Vegas for contests
against Baylor and University
Nevada-Las Vegas Friday and
Saturday.
