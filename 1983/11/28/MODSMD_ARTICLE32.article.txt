# Gary Player wins $170,000 at Skins

Scottsdale, Ariz. (AP) â€” Elder
statesmen Arnold Palmer and
Gary Player briefly recaptured
the glory of an earlier era of
golfing greatness and con
verted two lightning thrusts
into winning one-quarter mil
lion dollars yesterday in golf's
Ski ns Game.
" "Isn't it amazing, Arnold?
Here we've been playing for
more than 30 years and it's our
greatest day ever," said
Player, 48, who led the money

winners with $170,000, includ
ing $150,000 on the 17th hole
alone.
Later, the South African
rancher, who hasn't won on
the American tour since 1978,
said the unique event provid
ed him with some personal
vindication.
"People think I can't play
anymore," he said. "That's
why it was so pleasing to me to
be able to play so well in this
show."

He actually played the best
of the foursome, shooting a 4-
under-par 32 on his own ball
over the final nine holes of the
two-day televised event.
But the drama, as it seemed
to do so often so many years
ago, belonged to the still
dynamic Palmer, now 54 and a
non-winner on the regular
tour for more than a decade.
"I'd never won more than
$50,000 in any tournament
before, and today I come up

with $100,000," Palmer said.
"It's a whole different
feeling."
Palmer, calling on the half
remembered magic that once
was his alone, provided the
highlight of the day when he
coaxed a 35-foot putt up and
over a 4-foot swale and into a
cup-circling birdie that was
worth $100,000 on the 12th
hole.
For the two days he won
$140,000, more than he'd col
lected for all his Masters and
U.S. and British Open tri
umphs combined, and more
than he'd won in any year on
the U.S. tour since 1971.
Jack Nicklaus, 43, who de
signed the Desert Highlands
course in Arizona's Valley of
the Sun, birdied the last hole
for $30,000 and won $40,000
for the two days.
Stanford graduate Tom Wat
son, 34, the dominant player
in golf over the last few years,
got his only skin on the first
hole of play and finished two

days with $10,000.
The rules for this first-of-its
kind affair called for the first
six holes to carry a value of
$10,000 each, the next six
$20,000 and the last six
$30,000. If there was no win
ner on a hole, the money
carried over to the next hole.
The first big carry-over of
the final day actually began
when the eighth and ninth
holes were halved Saturday,
with the money carried over.
Player and Watson halved
the 10th in par, and halved the
11th with birdie-4s, Watson
scoring from 8 feet and Player
nursing in a 4-foot second putt
to force the carry-over.
"Jack, you ought to pay me
$5000 for that one," Gary
joked.
But it was Palmer, who had
experienced various ad
ventures including a prickly
venture into a cactus that
forced him to hit a shot left
handed, who reaped the
benefit of the carry-over.
