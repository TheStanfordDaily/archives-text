# Niners lose again
## 
### 
Chicago (AP) â€” Jim
McMahon lofted a 49-yard
touchdown pass to Dennis
McKinnon and Bob Thomas
booted a pair of field goals
yesterday to lead the
Chicago Bears to a 13-3 vic
tory over the San Francisco
49ers.
The victory was the third
straight for the Bears,
hiking their National Foot
ball League record to 6-7.
The 49ers suffered their
fourth loss in the last five
games and dropped to 7-6.
It was the first time the
49ers had been held with
out a touchdown since a 15-
12 loss to Cleveland in 1981.
The closest the 49ers
came to a touchdown was
in the closing seconds of
the first half when Wendell
Tyler fumbled at the
Chicago 1-yard line.

Joe Montana completed
26-of-43 passes for 253
yards but couldn't break
through for a TD.
Thomas booted a 29-yard
field goal in the first quarter
and the 49ers came back to
tie it on a 24-yard field goal
by Ray Wersching.
Late in the second quar
ter the Bears gambled on a
fourth-and-1 and McMahon
barely made it for a first
down at midfield. On the
next play he lofted his win
ning touchdown toss to
McKinnon.
Late in the first quarter,
the 49ers marched from
their own 20-yard line to
the Chicago 6 on 16 plays,
but had to settle for the
field goal by Wersching.
The game was played in a
cold, windswept rain, and
there were 25,310 no
shows.
