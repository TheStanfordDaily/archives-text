Banquet
You may still be full from Thanks
giving dinner, but tough. It's time to
think ahead to the ever-famous,
always-fun, seldom-sober before
break banquet. The date is Wed.,
Dec. 7, and yes, that's after the last
issue this quarter. The shindig starts
at The Daily for cocktails and moves
on to the Shogan restaurant for food
and news editor jollies. Sign-ups will
begin this afternoon on the office
door; don't forget to mark your
entree choice. There will be a cost
â€” for details, look on the sign-up
sheet.
Election
Declarations of candidacy for
editor of Vol. 185 are due by Tues.,
Dec. 6 at 5 p.m. A written statement
should be given to Kristen by that
deadline.
Candidates should make their
platforms available to the staff on
Mon., Jan. 9. A grill session will be
held the following day, and the elec
tion will be on Wed., Jan. 11.
The voting list will be posted by
Tues., Dec. 6.
My, how time flies.
