# Trustees expected to approve new University phone system
## 
### JERRY BALL Staff writer 
The Board of Trustees is expected to approve funding
Dec. 13 for a $12.5 to $14.5 million replacement of the
"outdated" University telephone system.
Already the Board has approved a $4.3 million project
to dig up old telephone cables and reinforce the con
duit. Trenching is scheduled to begin in February, and
the phone system replacement project "should be
completed within about 18 months of approval," accor
ding to Joe Deßode, telecommunications service
manager.
Deßode said the phone system currently in use is
"technologically outdated and too small" to serve the
University's needs.
Describing it as "technologically obsolete, inefficient
and expensive to maintain," he said it "provides a dial
tone, but that's about it."
The new, computer-driven system will be capable of

integrating voice and data, he said.
Maintenance and operating costs for the new system
should be "substantially less" than for the old one,
Deßode said. The new system will serve only University
phones with the "497" prefix, but Deßode said "the
possibility of extending services to the dormitories cer
tainly exists." It might be extended, he said, if local
telephone service to students becomes so expensive
that the University can provide it for less.
Deßode said the new system uses a different type of
telephone cable and will thus require 30,000 feet of
trenching and about 300,000 linear feet of underground
duct work. Most of the cables are in conduit under the
streets, he said, but sections of the Quad will have to
be dug up as well.
Trenching in the Quad, he said, will neither affect
other construction planned there nor disturb the time
capsules traditionally buried by each
senior class.
The new system will automatically
choose the cheapest route for long
distance calls and will allow calls to
be transferred without going
through an operator. It will also re
quire a smaller number of personnel
to maintain the system.
Deßode said the new system
should be able to handle approxi
mately 20,000 phones. "It will prob
ably take us 15 years to outgrow this
one/' he said.
