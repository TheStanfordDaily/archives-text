Reagan to meet Mideast leaders

Washington — President Reagan returned yester
day from a Thanksgiving holiday at his California
ranch to what his senior advisers see as "a window
of opportunity" this week for progress toward a per
manent peace in Lebanon.
Crucial meetings are scheduled at the White
House with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
Lebanon President Amin Cemayel and Reagan's per
sonal Middle East envoy, Donald Rumsfeld.
Reagan's meetings with Shamir, beginning today,
will focus on broader Middle East issues than
Lebanon. White House spokesman Larry Speakes
said that Reagan — apparently over Shamir's objec
tions — will attempt to revive his 1982 peace initia-

tive, which called for accommodation with the Pales
tinians and a freeze on Israeli settlements in the
West Bank.
Reagan originally had not been scheduled to meet
with Shamir until tomorrow, but yesterday an addi
tional session was added for today.
One senior official, who was interviewed on con
dition that he not be identified, also cautioned that
"anytime you have a fluid situation like this, you
either have an opportunity for progress or you had a
situation where something could go awry."
