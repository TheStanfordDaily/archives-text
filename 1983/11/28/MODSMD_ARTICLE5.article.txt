Reagan to meet Mideast leaders

Washington — President Reagan returned yester
day from a Thanksgiving holiday at his California
ranch to what his senior advisers see as "a window
of opportunity" this week for progress toward a per
manent peace in Lebanon.
Crucial meetings are scheduled at the White
House with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
Lebanon President Amin Cemayel and Reagan's per
sonal Middle East envoy, Donald Rumsfeld.
Reagan's meetings with Shamir, beginning today,
will focus on broader Middle East issues than
Lebanon. White House spokesman Larry Speakes
said that Reagan — apparently over Shamir's objec
tions — will attempt to revive his 1982 peace initia-

tive, which called for accommodation with the Pales
tinians and a freeze on Israeli settlements in the
West Bank.
Reagan originally had not been scheduled to meet
with Shamir until tomorrow, but yesterday an addi
tional session was added for today.
One senior official, who was interviewed on con
dition that he not be identified, also cautioned that
"anytime you have a fluid situation like this, you
either have an opportunity for progress or you had a
situation where something could go awry."
Britain may join peacekeeping
St. George's, Grenada — Britain, which opposed
the U.S. invasion of Grenada, is preparing to partici
pate in peacekeeping alongside U.S. forces here by
training a new Grenadian police force, U.S. and
British officials said yesterday.
The British project would mark a return to the
stage for Grenada's former colonial rulers after
more than a month during which the U.S. invasion
has eclipsed their presence on this Caribbean island
despite its Commonwealth membership and con
stitutional links to the British crown.
The police training program was expected to be a
major part of any Commonwealth participation in
peacekeeping duties, an idea being discussed at the
Commonwealth conference in India. According to
reports from the conference, Commonwealth
leaders are close to agreement in principle on a
peace-keeping role in Grenada, but the components
or mission of any Commonwealth force have not
been publicly defined.
Nicholas Braithwaite, acting chairman of
Grenada's interim government, said the island's ad
ministration has received no formal notification of a
Commonwealth plan but expects an official commu
nication soon. The governor general, Paul Scoon,
has scheduled a meeting Thursday of his advisory
council, or interim government, to consider
Grenada's response to the idea, he added.
"In general terms, it seems to me that the council
will have to agree with whatever is agreed on by the
OECS (Organization of Eastern Caribbean States)
countries, since they are the ones who came to our

assistance/' Braithwaite declared. "We would have
to consider very carefully, and probably accept,
whatever they agree with."
The OECS provided a diplomatic framework for
the Oct. 25 U.S. invasion of Grenada. The group,
comprising six small island nations including
Grenada, joined Barbados and Jamaica in asking the
Reagan administration to intervene here after Prime
Minister Maurice Bishop was killed Oct. 19.
The request was formulated in close cooperation
with U.S. diplomats on the scene, however, and the
group's current role here is a small part of the over
all U.S. diplomatic and military presence that
remains decisive for what goes on across the island.
Against that background, Braithwaite's comments
amounted to a prediction that Scoon and his interim
government will follow the guidance of Washington
and its Caribbean allies on the Commonwealth
peacekeeping force.
Commonwealth urges dialogue
Goa, India — Commonwealth heads of govern
ment yesterday unanimously urged the United
States and the Soviet Union to resume a "genuine
political dialogue" to relax growing world tensions.
Warning that the buildup of nuclear arsenals by
the superpowers threatens the future of civilization,
the Commonwealth leaders also called for stepped
up East-West contacts to build a "climate of confi
dence."

Their statement, entitled the Coa Declaration on
International Security, was issued before the presi
dents, prime ministers and lesser officials of 41
Commonwealth nations, and ended a two-day
retreat at this coastal resort. The Commonwealth
talks resume today in New Delhi.
"At this time of crisis, we believe it to be im
perative that the Soviet Union and the United States
should summon up the political vision of a world in
which their nations can live in peace," the statement
said.
The Commonwealth, consisting of Britain and its
former colonies, endorsed the personal peace mis
sion of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau,
who flew to Peking yesterday for talks with Chinese
officials on nuclear disarmament. Trudeau plans
later visits to Moscow and Washington in an effort to
advance disarmament talks.
Meanwhile, Secretary General Shridath Kamphal
confirmed that the Commonwealth leaders have ap
proved a call for withdrawal of U.S. forces from
Grenada that will be included in the final conference
communique. Commonwealth sources said Satur
day that the compromise statement — worked out
by Zimbabwe Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, one of
the meeting's chief critics of the U.S. action, along
with leaders of six Caribbean countries that sup
ported the invasion — did not specifically condemn
the United States.
President Reagan has said the invasion of
Grenada, also a Commonwealth member, was a res
cue mission requested by the nation's governor
general.

The Goa declaration expressed concern over the
"vulnerability of small states to external attack and
interference in their affairs," and said the world
community should provide for their territorial in
tegrity. This language, along with another statement
about the "readiness of nations to resort to the ille
gal use of force," could be construed as veiled refer
ences to the Sept. 25 invasion of Grenada.
