# Ombudsperson report
## National trends spark preprofessionalism, cheating 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
Anxieties about the economic sit
uation, the threat of nuclear war,
U.S. political intervention and draft
registration pressure students into
selecting preprofessional majors,
says john Goheen, the University's
ombudsperson, in his recently
released annual report.
"For students, selection of a
preprofessional major, competition
for grades and dishonest behavior
seem to be among the most immedi
ate consequences of the political
and social uncertainties of the
times," the report said.
Goheen said national social con
flicts pressure students so
profoundly that they compete in
tensely and often cheat.
In an interview with The Daily,
Goheen said that this year's report is
unusual because it "reviews some
of the history of this office." The
report explains that the establish
ment of the office in 1969 was a
response to the social unrest that
polarized the campus community.
"A fair and independent om
budsperson would be one way to
resolve and mediate problems and
conflicts," Goheen said in the
report.
Goheen, who prefers to be called
an ombudsperson rather than an
ombudsman, said students today
are occupied with the same pattern
of concerns that they were in the
late 19605. He said that since the po
sition was established, most of the
work of the ombudsperson has in

volved helping students cope as
they react to events outside of Stan
ford.
Goheen cautioned in the report,
however, that the ombudsperson's
"remedial weapons are persuasion
and private or public criticism." The
effectiveness of persuasion can have
its limitations, he said.
Despite the outside pressures that
affect student life, the number of
complaints and problems brought
to the office by students has
declined since 1981-82. The sub
stance of student problems,
however, has remained basically the
same.
Goheen said recurrent student
concerns include the failure of some
instructors to adhere to the policy
governing Dead Week and uneven

instruction in courses taught in mul
tiple sections.
Goheen devoted a large section of
the report to the Honor Code, and
noted both student and faculty aber
ration. Students consistently cheat
in the laboratory when they doctor
the results of an experiment and in
computer science classes whan they
"make unpermitted use of other
students' work to solve a problem,"
he said.
In interpreting the Honor Code,
some faculty members point out
that the Honor Code requires a
signature from students but not
from instructors. Some faculty
members assert that "they are not
bound as students are," Goheen
said, and others disregard all inter
