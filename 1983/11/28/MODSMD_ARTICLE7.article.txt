Ignoring street demonstrations and
warnings from Moscow, the West
German Bundestag voted Tuesday to
support deployment of U.S. medium
range nuclear missiles. The vote was
286-226 and followed a two-day
debate that spanned more than 25
hours.
The ability of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's coalition government to carry
the motion was never seriously
doubted. Voting appeared to divide
along strict party lines, with just one
abstention.
The British House of Commons
had voted two weeks before to carry
out its role in NATO's deployment
of the so-called Euromissiles: 160
American-made cruise missiles are
heading for England in the next five
years. Nine of the new missiles
arrived at a British air base last week.
West Germany is scheduled to
receive slightly more than half that
many cruise missiles. But officials in
Washington have repeatedly
stressed that the Soviets are more
concerned about the Pershing 2,
with its greater speed and accuracy,
than with the slower, low-flying
cruise.
The tendency to lump cruise and
Pershing 2s together under the
"Euromissile" heading can be mis
leading. Pentagon officials note that
the Pershing 2 travels at eight times
the speed of sound and can reach
Moscow in about 12 minutes, accor
ding to The Boston Globe. The offi
cials also assert that the Pershing 2 is
accurate and powerful enough to
destroy hardened, blast-resistant
missile silos and command-control
bunkers.
Pershing 2s also require a less
elaborate launch system and fewer
support vehicles than the cruise,
The Boston Globe said.
All of the Pershing 2s scheduled
for deployment are expected to be
placed in West Germany. The Pent
agon has said it wants them opera
tional by 1985.
The first nine of 108 Pershing 2s
reportedly arrived in Mutlangen,
West Germany within hours of the
Bundestag vote. U.S. and NATO of
ficials refused to confirm the
reports, but said Mutlangen is to be
the missiles' base.
Washington and Moscow have
long recognized the political sig
nificance attached to the
Euromissile deployment. While
some authorities assert that West
German approval of the Pershing 2
and cruise missiles demonstrates
NATO solidarity, others contend
that the sharp dissent within the
Bundestag — especially the opposi

tion to deployment by Willy
Brandt's Social Democratic party —
may indicate a growing division
within the NATO alliance.
The United States moved to
deploy the 572 Euromissiles in 1979,
largely at the request of Western
European leaders. That the deploy
ment has spawned controversy
within NATO countries is reflected
not only in heated debate in the par
liaments of England and West Ger
many, but by decisions in Belgium
and the Netherlands to block the
deployment of 48 cruise missiles
scheduled for installation in the low
countries over the next five years.

The Soviets walked out of the Inter
mediate Nuclear Force (INF) talks in
Geneva on Wednesday, immediately
following the apparent arrival of
Pershing 2 missiles in West Ger
many. Moscow did not say when the
negotiations would resume.
"I don't think I'm surprised by
what they did this morning, but I am
disappointed," President Reagan
said of the long-anticipated walkout.
The president said he "regretted"
the Soviet action, adding that he
"can't believe it will be permanent."
In Moscow, a statement from So
viet leader Yuri Andropov accused
the United States of "torpedoing"
the possibility of an INF accord —
and announced a further buildup of
nuclear weapons in Czechoslovakia

and East Germany as well as aboard
submarines off the U.S. coast. Yes
terday the Soviets indicated that nu
clear missiles may also be installed
in Bulgaria, The New York Times
said.
NATO officials reacted calmly to
Soviet countermeasures to NATO's
Euromissile deployment, presumab
ly to reassure a public worried about
the effects of another nuclear build
up.
"We will continue to seek
negotiations in good faith," Presi
dent Reagan said. Meeting in Bonn,
West German Chancellor Kohl and
French President Francois Mitter
rand asked the Soviets "to return to
the negotiating table as soon as pos
sible," stressing that that the
walkout and countermeasures are
"not in the interest of the peoples of
Europe, neither in the East nor the
West."
In contrast, the reports of Soviet
countermeasures appear to have
had an unusually striking impact on
at least some members of the War
saw Treaty Organization (WTO).
East German leader Eric Honecker
issued a statement asserting that the
new WTO deployment "produces
no rejoicing" in Eastern Europe, and
the Rumanian Communist Party
deplored the decisions by both
Washington and Moscow to speed
NATO and WTO deployments, The
New York Times said.

At least 185 people perished in the
crash and explosion of an Avianca
Airlines Boeing 747 near Madrid,
Spain early yesterday.
Officials on the scene reported
three survivors out of the 169 pas
sengers and 20 crew members on
board, and unconfirmed reports in
dicated that as many as 12 people
may have lived. Police said one sur
vivor died en route to the hospital.
The flight originated in Paris and
many of the victims were apparently
French nationals. Scheduled to stop
in Madrid, Spain; Caracas,
Venezuela; and Bogota, Colombia,
the jumbo jet went down near the
village of Mejorada del Campo, five
miles east of Madrid's Barajas Air
port.
The cause of the crash has not
been determined, but officials said
searchers uncovered the "black
box" flight recorders that may con
tain navigational data as well as
transcripts of the final conversations
among the members of the cockpit
crew.

The 5500 U.S. troops engaged in
military maneuvers in Honduras ap
pear to be causing concern among of
ficials of Nicaragua's Sandinista gov
ernment.
When Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger was asked this week
about the possibility of a U.S. inva

sion, he dismissed the question as
"hypothetical." Weinberger had
previously ruled out the chances for
an overt military intervention.
In addition to fears of a U.S. inva
sion, the Sandinistas may also per
ceive a growing threat from the
Honduran army. A Nicaraguan
backed insurgence against the Hon
duran government was crushed by
the Honduran armed forces, U.S.
and Honduran military officials an
nounced Monday.
The previously ill-regarded Hon
duran army's three-month cam
paign against the force of Cuban
trained Honduran rebels may con
stitute the most successful anti
insurgency operation in Central
America since the Guatemalan army
wiped out a guerrilla threat in the
late 1960s with the backing of U.S.
Green Berets.
The Associated Press reported
that a column of 96 rebels was vir
tually destroyed in the engagements
in Honduras' isolated Ulancho prov
ince in recent months and officials
say that the leader of the aborted
revolt, Jose Antonio Reyes Mata,
was killed.
This week, Latin American and
Western European leaders contin
ued efforts to pressure the Sandinis
tas into assisting with a regional
settlement. Internal reforms pro
posed by the government include
an offer to the Roman Catholic
hierarchy to discuss removal of radi
cal priests from the government, an
easing of press censorship and
guarantees to businessmen of
respect for private property, The
New York Times said.
In the past three weeks, Cuba —
which has maintained an estimated
8000 teachers, doctors and military
personnel in Nicaragua — appeared
to opt for a lower profile by recalling
as many as 1000 Cubans. And Daniel
Ortega Saavedra, coordinator of the
Nicaraguan junta, told interviewers
this week that the Sandinistas would
send home all foreign military ad
visers and stop buying weapons
from abroad in conjunction with
similar moves by other Central
American states.

Syrian-backed Palestinian rebels
challenging Yasser Arafat's leadership
of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) postponed a threatened at
tack on PLO strongholds in Tripoli
on Saturday to facilitate the im
plemention of a Syrian-Saudi peace
plan.
The plan calls for all fighters to
leave Tripoli and "its environs"
within two weeks and initiates talks

concerning PLO leadership. But
while both Arafat and the rebels
have said they agree with the new
plan, spokesmen on both sides have
professed an unwillingness both to
enter into negotiations and to leave
Lebanon.
Arafat has repeatedly said that a
new Syrian government — one
more sympathetic to Arafat's leader
ship of the PLO — is the only way to
end the strife between Palestinian
factions. This week, Arafat's hopes
may have moved a step closer to
reality: Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad may be seriously ill, according
to reports from many Lebanese offi
cials and Western diplomats.
Arafat's more tangible victory this
week — the exchange of six Israeli
soldiers for about 4500 Palestinian
and Lebanese fighters — appeared
to boost PLO morale in the wake of
the rebel assaults. The agreement
was negotiated by the International
Committee of the Red Cross in
Geneva.

In the largest theft in British history,
six masked gunmen stole almost $40
million in pure gold from a security
depot near London on Saturday. The
robbers also took two boxes of
diamonds that were stored in the
warehouse.
The police said the suspects, car
rying handguns and wearing ski
masks, overpowered several secur
ity guards, handcuffed them,
poured gasoline on them and
threatened to set them on fire if they
resisted.
About an hour after the raid, one
guard escaped and called police.
The area was immediately sealed
off, but it appeared that the robbers
made a clean getaway.

A state court in Corpus Christi,
Texas found the Ford Motor Co. guilty
of "gross negligence" in the design of
the Mustang II and awarded $106.9
million in damages to the family of a
20-year-old woman killed in a car
crash five years ago.
The jury deliberated for six hours
before deciding that Ford should
pay $6 million in actual and $100 mil
lion in punitive damages for the
death of Devary Durrill of
Robstown, Texas. Ford has not yet
announced whether it will appeal
the decision.
Durrill's 1974 Mustang II was hit
from behind and burst into flames in
1978 after she had stopped on the
shoulder of the road to clean up a
soft drink that had spilled. She died
a week later of third-degree burns.

NUCLEAR CARGO: A U.S. Air Force C-5A Galaxy transport plane leaves the Greenham Common air base
west of London, apparently after delivering cruise missile components. It is believed that a similar plane
carried Pershing 2 missiles to the Mutlangen air base in West Germany this week after the Bundestag voted
to carry out NATO's Euromissile deployment.

NUCLEAR CARGO: A U.S. Air Force C-5A Galaxy transport plane leaves the Greenham Common air base
west of London, apparently after delivering cruise missile components. It is believed that a similar plane
carried Pershing 2 missiles to the Mutlangen air base in West Germany this week after the Bundestag voted
to carry out NATO's Euromissile deployment.
Compiled from the Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times.Washington Post News Service and The New York Times

Ignoring street demonstrations and
warnings from Moscow, the West
German Bundestag voted Tuesday to
support deployment of U.S. medium
range nuclear missiles. The vote was
286-226 and followed a two-day
debate that spanned more than 25
hours.
The ability of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's coalition government to carry
the motion was never seriously
doubted. Voting appeared to divide
along strict party lines, with just one
abstention.
The British House of Commons
had voted two weeks before to carry
out its role in NATO's deployment
of the so-called Euromissiles: 160
American-made cruise missiles are
heading for England in the next five
years. Nine of the new missiles
arrived at a British air base last week.
West Germany is scheduled to
receive slightly more than half that
many cruise missiles. But officials in
Washington have repeatedly
stressed that the Soviets are more
concerned about the Pershing 2,
with its greater speed and accuracy,
than with the slower, low-flying
cruise.
The tendency to lump cruise and
Pershing 2s together under the
"Euromissile" heading can be mis
leading. Pentagon officials note that
the Pershing 2 travels at eight times
the speed of sound and can reach
Moscow in about 12 minutes, accor
ding to The Boston Globe. The offi
cials also assert that the Pershing 2 is
accurate and powerful enough to
destroy hardened, blast-resistant
missile silos and command-control
bunkers.
Pershing 2s also require a less
elaborate launch system and fewer
support vehicles than the cruise,
The Boston Globe said.
All of the Pershing 2s scheduled
for deployment are expected to be
placed in West Germany. The Pent
agon has said it wants them opera
tional by 1985.
The first nine of 108 Pershing 2s
reportedly arrived in Mutlangen,
West Germany within hours of the
Bundestag vote. U.S. and NATO of
ficials refused to confirm the
reports, but said Mutlangen is to be
the missiles' base.
Washington and Moscow have
long recognized the political sig
nificance attached to the
Euromissile deployment. While
some authorities assert that West
German approval of the Pershing 2
and cruise missiles demonstrates
NATO solidarity, others contend
that the sharp dissent within the
Bundestag — especially the opposi

tion to deployment by Willy
Brandt's Social Democratic party —
may indicate a growing division
within the NATO alliance.
The United States moved to
deploy the 572 Euromissiles in 1979,
largely at the request of Western
European leaders. That the deploy
ment has spawned controversy
within NATO countries is reflected
not only in heated debate in the par
liaments of England and West Ger
many, but by decisions in Belgium
and the Netherlands to block the
deployment of 48 cruise missiles
scheduled for installation in the low
countries over the next five years.

The Soviets walked out of the Inter
mediate Nuclear Force (INF) talks in
Geneva on Wednesday, immediately
following the apparent arrival of
Pershing 2 missiles in West Ger
many. Moscow did not say when the
negotiations would resume.
"I don't think I'm surprised by
what they did this morning, but I am
disappointed," President Reagan
said of the long-anticipated walkout.
The president said he "regretted"
the Soviet action, adding that he
"can't believe it will be permanent."
In Moscow, a statement from So
viet leader Yuri Andropov accused
the United States of "torpedoing"
the possibility of an INF accord —
and announced a further buildup of
nuclear weapons in Czechoslovakia

and East Germany as well as aboard
submarines off the U.S. coast. Yes
terday the Soviets indicated that nu
clear missiles may also be installed
in Bulgaria, The New York Times
said.
NATO officials reacted calmly to
Soviet countermeasures to NATO's
Euromissile deployment, presumab
ly to reassure a public worried about
the effects of another nuclear build
up.
"We will continue to seek
negotiations in good faith," Presi
dent Reagan said. Meeting in Bonn,
West German Chancellor Kohl and
French President Francois Mitter
rand asked the Soviets "to return to
the negotiating table as soon as pos
sible," stressing that that the
walkout and countermeasures are
"not in the interest of the peoples of
Europe, neither in the East nor the
West."
In contrast, the reports of Soviet
countermeasures appear to have
had an unusually striking impact on
at least some members of the War
saw Treaty Organization (WTO).
East German leader Eric Honecker
issued a statement asserting that the
new WTO deployment "produces
no rejoicing" in Eastern Europe, and
the Rumanian Communist Party
deplored the decisions by both
Washington and Moscow to speed
NATO and WTO deployments, The
New York Times said.

At least 185 people perished in the
crash and explosion of an Avianca
Airlines Boeing 747 near Madrid,
Spain early yesterday.
Officials on the scene reported
three survivors out of the 169 pas
sengers and 20 crew members on
board, and unconfirmed reports in
dicated that as many as 12 people
may have lived. Police said one sur
vivor died en route to the hospital.
The flight originated in Paris and
many of the victims were apparently
French nationals. Scheduled to stop
in Madrid, Spain; Caracas,
Venezuela; and Bogota, Colombia,
the jumbo jet went down near the
village of Mejorada del Campo, five
miles east of Madrid's Barajas Air
port.
The cause of the crash has not
been determined, but officials said
searchers uncovered the "black
box" flight recorders that may con
tain navigational data as well as
transcripts of the final conversations
among the members of the cockpit
crew.

The 5500 U.S. troops engaged in
military maneuvers in Honduras ap
pear to be causing concern among of
ficials of Nicaragua's Sandinista gov
ernment.
When Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger was asked this week
about the possibility of a U.S. inva

sion, he dismissed the question as
"hypothetical." Weinberger had
previously ruled out the chances for
an overt military intervention.
In addition to fears of a U.S. inva
sion, the Sandinistas may also per
ceive a growing threat from the
Honduran army. A Nicaraguan
backed insurgence against the Hon
duran government was crushed by
the Honduran armed forces, U.S.
and Honduran military officials an
nounced Monday.
The previously ill-regarded Hon
duran army's three-month cam
paign against the force of Cuban
trained Honduran rebels may con
stitute the most successful anti
insurgency operation in Central
America since the Guatemalan army
wiped out a guerrilla threat in the
late 1960s with the backing of U.S.
Green Berets.
The Associated Press reported
that a column of 96 rebels was vir
tually destroyed in the engagements
in Honduras' isolated Ulancho prov
ince in recent months and officials
say that the leader of the aborted
revolt, Jose Antonio Reyes Mata,
was killed.
This week, Latin American and
Western European leaders contin
ued efforts to pressure the Sandinis
tas into assisting with a regional
settlement. Internal reforms pro
posed by the government include
an offer to the Roman Catholic
hierarchy to discuss removal of radi
cal priests from the government, an
easing of press censorship and
guarantees to businessmen of
respect for private property, The
New York Times said.
In the past three weeks, Cuba —
which has maintained an estimated
8000 teachers, doctors and military
personnel in Nicaragua — appeared
to opt for a lower profile by recalling
as many as 1000 Cubans. And Daniel
Ortega Saavedra, coordinator of the
Nicaraguan junta, told interviewers
this week that the Sandinistas would
send home all foreign military ad
visers and stop buying weapons
from abroad in conjunction with
similar moves by other Central
American states.

Syrian-backed Palestinian rebels
challenging Yasser Arafat's leadership
of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) postponed a threatened at
tack on PLO strongholds in Tripoli
on Saturday to facilitate the im
plemention of a Syrian-Saudi peace
plan.
The plan calls for all fighters to
leave Tripoli and "its environs"
within two weeks and initiates talks

concerning PLO leadership. But
while both Arafat and the rebels
have said they agree with the new
plan, spokesmen on both sides have
professed an unwillingness both to
enter into negotiations and to leave
Lebanon.
Arafat has repeatedly said that a
new Syrian government — one
more sympathetic to Arafat's leader
ship of the PLO — is the only way to
end the strife between Palestinian
factions. This week, Arafat's hopes
may have moved a step closer to
reality: Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad may be seriously ill, according
to reports from many Lebanese offi
cials and Western diplomats.

Syrian-backed Palestinian rebels
challenging Yasser Arafat's leadership
of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) postponed a threatened at
tack on PLO strongholds in Tripoli
on Saturday to facilitate the im
plemention of a Syrian-Saudi peace
plan.
The plan calls for all fighters to
leave Tripoli and "its environs"
within two weeks and initiates talks

concerning PLO leadership. But
while both Arafat and the rebels
have said they agree with the new
plan, spokesmen on both sides have
professed an unwillingness both to
enter into negotiations and to leave
Lebanon.
Arafat has repeatedly said that a
new Syrian government — one
more sympathetic to Arafat's leader
ship of the PLO — is the only way to
end the strife between Palestinian
factions. This week, Arafat's hopes
may have moved a step closer to
reality: Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad may be seriously ill, according
to reports from many Lebanese offi
cials and Western diplomats.
Arafat's more tangible victory this
week — the exchange of six Israeli
soldiers for about 4500 Palestinian
and Lebanese fighters — appeared
to boost PLO morale in the wake of
the rebel assaults. The agreement
was negotiated by the International
Committee of the Red Cross in
Geneva.

In the largest theft in British history,

A state court in Corpus Christi,
Texas found the Ford Motor Co. guilty
of "gross negligence" in the design of
the Mustang II and awarded $106.9
million in damages to the family of a
20-year-old woman killed in a car
crash five years ago.
The jury deliberated for six hours
before deciding that Ford should
pay $6 million in actual and $100 mil

death of Devary Durrill of
Robstown, Texas. Ford has not yet
announced whether it will appeal
the decision.
Durrill's 1974 Mustang II was hit

NUCLEAR CARGO: A U.S. Air Force C-5A Galaxy transport plane leaves the Greenham Common air base
west of London, apparently after delivering cruise missile components. It is believed that a similar plane
carried Pershing 2 missiles to the Mutlangen air base in West Germany this week after the Bundestag voted
to carry out NATO's Euromissile deployment.
Compiled from the Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times.Washington Post News Service and The New York Times

Ignoring street demonstrations and
warnings from Moscow, the West
German Bundestag voted Tuesday to
support deployment of U.S. medium
range nuclear missiles. The vote was
286-226 and followed a two-day
debate that spanned more than 25
hours.
The ability of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's coalition government to carry
the motion was never seriously
doubted. Voting appeared to divide
along strict party lines, with just one
abstention.
The British House of Commons
had voted two weeks before to carry
out its role in NATO's deployment
of the so-called Euromissiles: 160
American-made cruise missiles are
heading for England in the next five
years. Nine of the new missiles
arrived at a British air base last week.
West Germany is scheduled to
receive slightly more than half that
many cruise missiles. But officials in
Washington have repeatedly
stressed that the Soviets are more
concerned about the Pershing 2,
with its greater speed and accuracy,
than with the slower, low-flying
cruise.
The tendency to lump cruise and
Pershing 2s together under the
"Euromissile" heading can be mis
leading. Pentagon officials note that
the Pershing 2 travels at eight times
the speed of sound and can reach
Moscow in about 12 minutes, accor
ding to The Boston Globe. The offi
cials also assert that the Pershing 2 is
accurate and powerful enough to
destroy hardened, blast-resistant
missile silos and command-control
bunkers.
Pershing 2s also require a less
elaborate launch system and fewer
support vehicles than the cruise,
The Boston Globe said.
All of the Pershing 2s scheduled
for deployment are expected to be
placed in West Germany. The Pent
agon has said it wants them opera
tional by 1985.
The first nine of 108 Pershing 2s
reportedly arrived in Mutlangen,
West Germany within hours of the
Bundestag vote. U.S. and NATO of
ficials refused to confirm the
reports, but said Mutlangen is to be
the missiles' base.
Washington and Moscow have
long recognized the political sig
nificance attached to the
Euromissile deployment. While
some authorities assert that West
German approval of the Pershing 2
and cruise missiles demonstrates
NATO solidarity, others contend
that the sharp dissent within the
Bundestag — especially the opposi

tion to deployment by Willy
Brandt's Social Democratic party —
may indicate a growing division
within the NATO alliance.
The United States moved to
deploy the 572 Euromissiles in 1979,
largely at the request of Western
European leaders. That the deploy
ment has spawned controversy
within NATO countries is reflected
not only in heated debate in the par
liaments of England and West Ger
many, but by decisions in Belgium
and the Netherlands to block the
deployment of 48 cruise missiles
scheduled for installation in the low
countries over the next five years.

The Soviets walked out of the Inter
mediate Nuclear Force (INF) talks in
Geneva on Wednesday, immediately
following the apparent arrival of
Pershing 2 missiles in West Ger
many. Moscow did not say when the
negotiations would resume.
"I don't think I'm surprised by
what they did this morning, but I am
disappointed," President Reagan
said of the long-anticipated walkout.
The president said he "regretted"
the Soviet action, adding that he
"can't believe it will be permanent."
In Moscow, a statement from So
viet leader Yuri Andropov accused
the United States of "torpedoing"
the possibility of an INF accord —
and announced a further buildup of
nuclear weapons in Czechoslovakia

and East Germany as well as aboard
submarines off the U.S. coast. Yes
terday the Soviets indicated that nu
clear missiles may also be installed
in Bulgaria, The New York Times
said.
NATO officials reacted calmly to
Soviet countermeasures to NATO's
Euromissile deployment, presumab
ly to reassure a public worried about
the effects of another nuclear build
up.
"We will continue to seek
negotiations in good faith," Presi
dent Reagan said. Meeting in Bonn,
West German Chancellor Kohl and
French President Francois Mitter
rand asked the Soviets "to return to
the negotiating table as soon as pos
sible," stressing that that the
walkout and countermeasures are
"not in the interest of the peoples of
Europe, neither in the East nor the
West."
In contrast, the reports of Soviet
countermeasures appear to have
had an unusually striking impact on
at least some members of the War
saw Treaty Organization (WTO).
East German leader Eric Honecker
issued a statement asserting that the
new WTO deployment "produces
no rejoicing" in Eastern Europe, and
the Rumanian Communist Party
deplored the decisions by both
Washington and Moscow to speed
NATO and WTO deployments, The
New York Times said.

At least 185 people perished in the
crash and explosion of an Avianca
Airlines Boeing 747 near Madrid,
Spain early yesterday.
Officials on the scene reported
three survivors out of the 169 pas
sengers and 20 crew members on
board, and unconfirmed reports in
dicated that as many as 12 people
may have lived. Police said one sur
vivor died en route to the hospital.
The flight originated in Paris and
many of the victims were apparently
French nationals. Scheduled to stop
in Madrid, Spain; Caracas,
Venezuela; and Bogota, Colombia,
the jumbo jet went down near the
village of Mejorada del Campo, five
miles east of Madrid's Barajas Air
port.
The cause of the crash has not
been determined, but officials said
searchers uncovered the "black
box" flight recorders that may con
tain navigational data as well as
transcripts of the final conversations
among the members of the cockpit
crew.

The 5500 U.S. troops engaged in
military maneuvers in Honduras ap
pear to be causing concern among of
ficials of Nicaragua's Sandinista gov
ernment.
When Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger was asked this week
about the possibility of a U.S. inva

sion, he dismissed the question as
"hypothetical." Weinberger had
previously ruled out the chances for
an overt military intervention.
In addition to fears of a U.S. inva
sion, the Sandinistas may also per
ceive a growing threat from the
Honduran army. A Nicaraguan
backed insurgence against the Hon
duran government was crushed by
the Honduran armed forces, U.S.
and Honduran military officials an
nounced Monday.
The previously ill-regarded Hon
duran army's three-month cam
paign against the force of Cuban
trained Honduran rebels may con
stitute the most successful anti
insurgency operation in Central
America since the Guatemalan army
wiped out a guerrilla threat in the
late 1960s with the backing of U.S.
Green Berets.
