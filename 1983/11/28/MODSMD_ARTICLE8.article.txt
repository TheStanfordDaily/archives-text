## Student drinking: university policies across the country 
### DANA RATLIFF 
As the Residential Education
office works to control alcohol
consumption on campus, the
issue of a university's role in
determining students' alcohol
consumption becomes more
controversial.
Stanford's policy, according
to Norman Robinson, the as
sistant dean of student affairs
for Residential Education, is a
"very ambiguous" one.
"Stanford approaches and
views its students as adults.
There are not many rules and
regulations about student
conduct at Stanford," Robin
son said.
"The University policy is
that individuals and groups
are supposed to make their
own decisions and should
know what the laws are and
act accordingly. Houses are
encouraged to de-emphasize,
but not ban, the use of alco
hol."
How does Stanford's alco
hol policy compare to those at
other universities across the
country? The Daily talked to
students at seven universities
to find out.
Yale University
Yale's alcohol policy is more
strict and more heavily en
forced than Stanford's.
Sharon Ruwart, news editor
for the Yale Daily News, des
cribed the Social Activities
Card (SAC) system at Yale,
where the legal drinking age
has just been raised from 19 to
20.
"The Social Activities Coun
cil SAC card gets you into

campus parties at a discount,"
she said. "Freshmen and sop
homores get different colored
SAC cards, and they get their
hands stamped. But this
means nothing in practice;
people are pretty lax.
"In terms of social events
and parties, the organizers are
not allowed to advertise that
they are serving beer. People
get around this rule by using
code words in their party fliers

like 'Featured Party Per
former: Steve Kegs,' " Ruwart
explained.
Liquor stores in New Haven
have begun to check students'
I.D.s more since the drinking
age was raised in October,
Ruwart said.
"Carding has really gone
up, but a lot of liquor stores
only do it on Saturday nights
when they are in more danger
of getting caught by local au

thorities for selling alcohol to
minors.
Harvard University
Officials at Harvard, where
the drinking age is 20, leave al
cohol decisions up to the stu
dents, according to student
Tom Hawlett.
"Two-thirds of the under
graduates are technically un
derage. But Harvard doesn't
want to segregate its students,

so there is no hand-stamping
system," Hawlett said.
"People bring beer to social
events such as sports, which is
against the rules, but I have
never seen anyone really get
busted."
Another Harvard student
said that, for undergraduates,
alcohol is easy to obtain.
"The Harvard Provisional
sells alcohol to students and
so do liquor outlets such as

Martinelli's who cater to Har
vard students and who can't
afford to lose the huge college
market," the student said.
Princeton University
Princeton, where students
must be 21 years old to drink
legally, has an enforced sys
tem of I.D. checking.
According to Daily Prin
cetonian staff member Amy
Gordon, "School sponsored

parties are not allowed to
serve alcohol.
"The Eating Clubs for
juniors and seniors, which are
not affiliated with the univer
sity, serve the function of the
upper class social life. But the
university requires all club
parties to check 1.D.5," Gor
don said. "Even the windows
must be locked at parties to
prevent people from sneaking
into the buildings. The Class
of '84 can have beer parties,
but even seniors need I.D. to
get in."
Alcohol is not readily
available to underage students
off campus either, "l iquor
stores will not sell to minors,"
Gordon said.
UC-Berkeley
Administrators at UC-
Berkeley have taken precau
tions to ensure that underage
students don't drink, accor
ding to Anita Seline, editor of
the Daily Californian.
"You can't sell alcohol
within a mile of campus. On
campus, you can sell beer and
wine but not hard liquor,"
Seline said. "In dorms, you
can have alcohol, but it has to
be in your room, behind
closed doors â€” that's the new
policy. They used to be able to
buy kegs with dorm funds ,
but they can't now."
Fraternities and sororities
are less restricted.
"They're supposed to have
closed parties with invitations
only, but the rules aren't really
followed," she said.

Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is a
"completely dry" campus, ac
cording to former "dorm
tower" president Karry Boyd.
No one, not even faculty
members, may drink on
campus.
"No alcohol is allowed on
campus. Not even off-campus
events sponsored by a dorm,
like a barbecue, can serve al
cohol," Boyd said.
"You go on 'Instant Report'
and you go in front of the
Council of Students to resolve
your situation if you are
caught with alcohol in your
possession. They make you
throw a non-alcoholic party,
write a paper or do some
campus beautification," Boyd
explained.
And the punishment is
worse for repeat offenders.
"You are moved to a differ
ent dorm after three 'Instant
Reports,' and after three more
you are kicked out. One of the
guys in my dorm early last year
went on report when a
(resident assistant) found two
inches of beer in an open can
in his room."
But Boyd said that students
still try to keep liquor in their
rooms.
"People don't follow the
rules. You can just keep alco
hol in your room. The RAs run
a monthly refrigerator check
so you just hide it in your
drawers where they can't
search. Anyhow, at the end of
the year RAs ignore it if they
see you drinking."

Northwestern University
The alcohol-related death of
a student last year has caused
increased concern over alco
hol use at Northwestern, ac
cording to Daily Northwestern
staffer Jim Puzzanghera.

"Last year a drunk student
was doing push-ups out on
the road and he was killed
when a car ran over him.
Residence Assistance was
scared but now they have
loosened up," Puzzanghera
said.
With Northwestern's cur
rent alcohol policy, "you may
have alcohol in the
residences, but you must first
estimate how many people at
the party will be over 21," he
said. "They don't want more

alcohol available than for
people of age. Also, dorm
funds can't be spent on alco
hol."
But RAs seldom enforce the
rules about alcohol consump
tion at Northwestern, Puzzan-

ghera said.
"Resident assistants tell you
not to have a wild party and
they bend the rules or look
the other way when someone
is drinking in the dorm."
USC
USC has also been hit by
alcohol-related accidents.
"Two freshman students
went comatose at the same
fraternity party that served a

tasteless and odorless alcohol
mixed in a punch. On another
occasion, a student guest fell
off a student apartment bal
cony to his death," according
to Daily Trojan associate
editor Annette Haddad.
Administrators at USC have
responded to the accidents
with tighter alcohol policies.
"You must now sign a
release if you wish to have an
outsider come to one of the
campus parties. To have a
party with alcohol in the
recreation rooms, or even a
wine and cheese affair with
faculty, you must sign forms
that relieve the university of
responsibility in case of acci
dents," Haddad said.
She described another
alcohol-related accident at
USC.
"A fraternity student who
was drunk was riding his bike
at 3 a.m. with another guy on
the handlebars and he fell into
the street. An older man in a
car hit him and injured the stu
dent's head, causing paralyza
tion from the neck down. The
student's parents are still not
sure whether they will sue,
but now the paraplegic stu
dent is back at the same frater
nity," Haddad said.
"That fraternity and others
are having events and
speakers to educate students
about the dangers of alcohol,"
she said. "But we still serve
beer in our campus cafeteria
and allow it in dorm rooms,
but it cannot spill out into the
hall."

campus.
"No alcohol is allowed on
campus. Not even off-campus
events sponsored by a dorm,
like a barbecue, can serve al
cohol," Boyd said.
"You go on 'Instant Report'
and you go in front of the
Council of Students to resolve
your situation if you are
caught with alcohol in your
possession. They make you
throw a non-alcoholic party,
write a paper or do some
campus beautification," Boyd
explained.
And the punishment is
worse for repeat offenders.
"You are moved to a differ
ent dorm after three 'Instant
Reports,' and after three more
you are kicked out. One of the
guys in my dorm early last year
went on report when a
(resident assistant) found two
inches of beer in an open can
in his room."
But Boyd said that students
still try to keep liquor in their
rooms.
"People don't follow the
rules. You can just keep alco
hol in your room. The RAs run
a monthly refrigerator check
so you just hide it in your
drawers where they can't
search. Anyhow, at the end of
the year RAs ignore it if they
see you drinking."

Northwestern University
The alcohol-related death of
a student last year has caused
increased concern over alco
hol use at Northwestern, ac
cording to Daily Northwestern
staffer Jim Puzzanghera.

"Last year a drunk student
was doing push-ups out on
the road and he was killed
when a car ran over him.
Residence Assistance was
scared but now they have
loosened up," Puzzanghera
said.
With Northwestern's cur
rent alcohol policy, "you may
have alcohol in the
residences, but you must first
estimate how many people at
the party will be over 21," he
said. "They don't want more

alcohol available than for
people of age. Also, dorm
funds can't be spent on alco
hol."
But RAs seldom enforce the
rules about alcohol consump
tion at Northwestern, Puzzan-

ghera said.
"Resident assistants tell you
not to have a wild party and
they bend the rules or look
the other way when someone
is drinking in the dorm."
USC
USC has also been hit by
alcohol-related accidents.
"Two freshman students
went comatose at the same
fraternity party that served a

tasteless and odorless alcohol
mixed in a punch. On another
occasion, a student guest fell
off a student apartment bal
cony to his death," according
to Daily Trojan associate
editor Annette Haddad.
Administrators at USC have
responded to the accidents
with tighter alcohol policies.
"You must now sign a
release if you wish to have an
outsider come to one of the
campus parties. To have a
party with alcohol in the
recreation rooms, or even a
wine and cheese affair with
faculty, you must sign forms
that relieve the university of
responsibility in case of acci
dents," Haddad said.
She described another
alcohol-related accident at
USC.
"A fraternity student who
was drunk was riding his bike
at 3 a.m. with another guy on
the handlebars and he fell into
the street. An older man in a
car hit him and injured the stu
dent's head, causing paralyza
tion from the neck down. The
student's parents are still not
sure whether they will sue,
but now the paraplegic stu
dent is back at the same frater
nity," Haddad said.
"That fraternity and others
are having events and
speakers to educate students
about the dangers of alcohol,"
she said. "But we still serve
beer in our campus cafeteria
and allow it in dorm rooms,
but it cannot spill out into the
hall."

As the Residential Education
office works to control alcohol
consumption on campus, the
issue of a university's role in
determining students' alcohol
consumption becomes more
controversial.
Stanford's policy, according
to Norman Robinson, the as
sistant dean of student affairs
for Residential Education, is a
"very ambiguous" one.
"Stanford approaches and
views its students as adults.
There are not many rules and

"The University policy is
that individuals and groups
are supposed to make their
own decisions and should
know what the laws are and
act accordingly. Houses are
encouraged to de-emphasize,
but not ban, the use of alco
hol."
How does Stanford's alco
hol policy compare to those at
other universities across the
country? The Daily talked to
students at seven universities
to find out.
Yale University
Yale's alcohol policy is more
strict and more heavily en
forced than Stanford's.
Sharon Ruwart, news editor
for the Yale Daily News, des
cribed the Social Activities
Card (SAC) system at Yale,
where the legal drinking age
has just been raised from 19 to
20.
"The Social Activities Coun
cil SAC card gets you into

campus parties at a discount,"
she said. "Freshmen and sop
homores get different colored
SAC cards, and they get their
hands stamped. But this
means nothing in practice;
people are pretty lax.
"In terms of social events
and parties, the organizers are
not allowed to advertise that
they are serving beer. People
get around this rule by using
code words in their party fliers

like 'Featured Party Per
former: Steve Kegs,' " Ruwart
explained.
Liquor stores in New Haven
have begun to check students'
I.D.s more since the drinking
age was raised in October,
Ruwart said.
"Carding has really gone
up, but a lot of liquor stores
only do it on Saturday nights
when they are in more danger
of getting caught by local au

thorities for selling alcohol to
minors.
Harvard University
Officials at Harvard, where
the drinking age is 20, leave al
cohol decisions up to the stu
dents, according to student
Tom Hawlett.
"Two-thirds of the under
graduates are technically un
derage. But Harvard doesn't
want to segregate its students,

so there is no hand-stamping
system," Hawlett said.
"People bring beer to social
events such as sports, which is
against the rules, but I have
never seen anyone really get
busted."
Another Harvard student
said that, for undergraduates,
alcohol is easy to obtain.
"The Harvard Provisional
sells alcohol to students and
so do liquor outlets such as

Martinelli's who cater to Har
vard students and who can't
afford to lose the huge college
market," the student said.
Princeton University
Princeton, where students
must be 21 years old to drink
legally, has an enforced sys
tem of I.D. checking.
According to Daily Prin
cetonian staff member Amy
Gordon, "School sponsored

parties are not allowed to
serve alcohol.
"The Eating Clubs for
juniors and seniors, which are
not affiliated with the univer
sity, serve the function of the
upper class social life. But the
university requires all club
parties to check 1.D.5," Gor
don said. "Even the windows
must be locked at parties to
prevent people from sneaking
into the buildings. The Class
of '84 can have beer parties,
but even seniors need I.D. to
get in."
Alcohol is not readily
available to underage students
off campus either, "l iquor
stores will not sell to minors,"
Gordon said.
UC-Berkeley
Administrators at UC-
Berkeley have taken precau
tions to ensure that underage
students don't drink, accor
ding to Anita Seline, editor of
the Daily Californian.
"You can't sell alcohol
within a mile of campus. On
campus, you can sell beer and
wine but not hard liquor,"
Seline said. "In dorms, you
can have alcohol, but it has to
be in your room, behind
closed doors â€” that's the new
policy. They used to be able to
buy kegs with dorm funds ,
but they can't now."
Fraternities and sororities
are less restricted.
"They're supposed to have
closed parties with invitations
only, but the rules aren't really
followed," she said.

Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is a

hol policy compare to those at
other universities across the
country? The Daily talked to
students at seven universities
to find out.
Yale University
Yale's alcohol policy is more
strict and more heavily en
forced than Stanford's.
Sharon Ruwart, news editor
for the Yale Daily News, des
cribed the Social Activities
Card (SAC) system at Yale,
where the legal drinking age
has just been raised from 19 to
20.
"The Social Activities Coun
cil SAC card gets you into

campus parties at a discount,"
she said. "Freshmen and sop
homores get different colored
SAC cards, and they get their
hands stamped. But this
means nothing in practice;
people are pretty lax.
"In terms of social events
and parties, the organizers are
not allowed to advertise that
they are serving beer. People
get around this rule by using
code words in their party fliers

like 'Featured Party Per
former: Steve Kegs,' " Ruwart
explained.
Liquor stores in New Haven
have begun to check students'
I.D.s more since the drinking
age was raised in October,
Ruwart said.
"Carding has really gone
up, but a lot of liquor stores
only do it on Saturday nights
when they are in more danger
of getting caught by local au

thorities for selling alcohol to
minors.
Harvard University
Officials at Harvard, where
the drinking age is 20, leave al
cohol decisions up to the stu
dents, according to student
Tom Hawlett.
"Two-thirds of the under
graduates are technically un
derage. But Harvard doesn't
want to segregate its students,

so there is no hand-stamping
system," Hawlett said.
"People bring beer to social
events such as sports, which is
against the rules, but I have
never seen anyone really get
busted."
Another Harvard student
said that, for undergraduates,
alcohol is easy to obtain.
"The Harvard Provisional
sells alcohol to students and
so do liquor outlets such as

Martinelli's who cater to Har
vard students and who can't
afford to lose the huge college
market," the student said.
Princeton University
Princeton, where students
must be 21 years old to drink
legally, has an enforced sys
tem of I.D. checking.
According to Daily Prin
cetonian staff member Amy
Gordon, "School sponsored

parties are not allowed to
serve alcohol.
"The Eating Clubs for
juniors and seniors, which are
not affiliated with the univer
sity, serve the function of the
upper class social life. But the
university requires all club
parties to check 1.D.5," Gor
don said. "Even the windows
must be locked at parties to
prevent people from sneaking
into the buildings. The Class
of '84 can have beer parties,
but even seniors need I.D. to
get in."
Alcohol is not readily
available to underage students
off campus either, "l iquor
stores will not sell to minors,"
Gordon said.
UC-Berkeley
Administrators at UC-
Berkeley have taken precau
tions to ensure that underage
students don't drink, accor
ding to Anita Seline, editor of
the Daily Californian.
"You can't sell alcohol
within a mile of campus. On
campus, you can sell beer and
wine but not hard liquor,"
Seline said. "In dorms, you
can have alcohol, but it has to
be in your room, behind
closed doors â€” that's the new
policy. They used to be able to
buy kegs with dorm funds ,
but they can't now."
Fraternities and sororities
are less restricted.
"They're supposed to have
closed parties with invitations
only, but the rules aren't really
followed," she said.

Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is a
"completely dry" campus, ac
cording to former "dorm
tower" president Karry Boyd.
No one, not even faculty
members, may drink on
campus.
"No alcohol is allowed on
campus. Not even off-campus
events sponsored by a dorm,
like a barbecue, can serve al
cohol," Boyd said.
"You go on 'Instant Report'
and you go in front of the
Council of Students to resolve
your situation if you are
caught with alcohol in your
possession. They make you
throw a non-alcoholic party,
write a paper or do some
campus beautification," Boyd
explained.
And the punishment is
worse for repeat offenders.
"You are moved to a differ
ent dorm after three 'Instant
Reports,' and after three more
you are kicked out. One of the
guys in my dorm early last year
went on report when a
(resident assistant) found two
inches of beer in an open can
in his room."
But Boyd said that students
still try to keep liquor in their
rooms.
"People don't follow the
rules. You can just keep alco
hol in your room. The RAs run
a monthly refrigerator check
so you just hide it in your
drawers where they can't
search. Anyhow, at the end of
the year RAs ignore it if they
see you drinking."

Northwestern University
The alcohol-related death of
a student last year has caused
increased concern over alco
hol use at Northwestern, ac
cording to Daily Northwestern
staffer Jim Puzzanghera.

"Last year a drunk student
was doing push-ups out on
the road and he was killed
when a car ran over him.
Residence Assistance was
scared but now they have
loosened up," Puzzanghera
said.
With Northwestern's cur
rent alcohol policy, "you may
have alcohol in the
residences, but you must first
estimate how many people at
the party will be over 21," he
said. "They don't want more

alcohol available than for
people of age. Also, dorm
funds can't be spent on alco
hol."
But RAs seldom enforce the
rules about alcohol consump
tion at Northwestern, Puzzan-

ghera said.
"Resident assistants tell you
not to have a wild party and
they bend the rules or look
the other way when someone
is drinking in the dorm."
USC
USC has also been hit by
alcohol-related accidents.
"Two freshman students
went comatose at the same
fraternity party that served a

tasteless and odorless alcohol
mixed in a punch. On another
occasion, a student guest fell
off a student apartment bal
cony to his death," according
to Daily Trojan associate
editor Annette Haddad.
Administrators at USC have
responded to the accidents
with tighter alcohol policies.
"You must now sign a
release if you wish to have an
outsider come to one of the
campus parties. To have a
party with alcohol in the
recreation rooms, or even a
wine and cheese affair with
faculty, you must sign forms
that relieve the university of
responsibility in case of acci
dents," Haddad said.
She described another
alcohol-related accident at
USC.
"A fraternity student who
was drunk was riding his bike
at 3 a.m. with another guy on
the handlebars and he fell into
the street. An older man in a
car hit him and injured the stu
dent's head, causing paralyza
tion from the neck down. The
student's parents are still not
sure whether they will sue,
but now the paraplegic stu
dent is back at the same frater
nity," Haddad said.
"That fraternity and others
are having events and
speakers to educate students
about the dangers of alcohol,"
she said. "But we still serve
beer in our campus cafeteria
and allow it in dorm rooms,
but it cannot spill out into the
hall."
