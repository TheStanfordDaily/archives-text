## The
						Stanford Daily Don't widen the gulf 
### 
President Reagan gave it a high priority. Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) had supported it for
years. Conservative groups across the country
considered it a matter of simple "tax equity."
Fortunately, the Senate did not fall for the
rhetoric. In a 59-38 vote on Nov. 16, nearly half
the Senate Republicans joined a majority of
Democrats to defeat a bill providing tuition tax
credits for parents of private-school children.
The arguments for tuition tax credits have an
illusion of equity about them. Parents who
place their children in private schools do not
benefit from the public schools, and therefore,
the proponents claim, they should not sub
sidize them.
We disagree. Tuition tax credits result in the
subsidization of private education at the ex
pense of public schools. Proposals like this one
would create a dual system of education for the
rich and the poor: Parents who could afford it
would get much better educations for their
children.
Here at Stanford many of us are already pain
fully aware of the often vast differences be
tween public and private education. If wealthy

parents received tax incentives to send their
children to private schools, the gulf between
private and public education would widen
even further.
And what would happen to the public
schools in this scenario? Not only would they
get less money, but also more and more par
ents would take their children out of public
schools once private education became more
affordable. Private institutions would increas
ingly become islands of elitism: Only the poor
would attend the rapidly declining public edu
cation system.
Free, public education is essential for the
maintenance of democracy. Any proposal
which gives incentives for parents to take their
children out of public schools undermines the
basis of our educational system.
Private school in this country is an option.
Parents who possess the means and the desire
to have their children acquire a non-public
education have the right to do so. But they do
not have the right to demand money back from
the government because of their choice.
