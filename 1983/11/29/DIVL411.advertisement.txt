<3k THE HACKER'S DICTIONARY
+ /jfe A Guide to the Computer Underworld
' J|. by Guy L. Steele, Jr.
W * This hilarious dictionary of the newest pop culture jargon — computerese
* — is sure to separate the true computer fanatics from the mere users.
Called a "remarkable work" by Time magazine, and one that "displays a youthfully
('SpV exuberant sense of the absurd," this dictionary is the first to make sense of the hottest new
• subculture — the world of computer hackers (fanatics). Assembled in mock printout
fashion by computer scientists Guy Steele and circulated among a contributing network of
'A \ hackers at M.1.T.. Stanford and elsewhere, this inventive look at the underground world of
A programming is presented with great seriousness but not an ounce of solemnity. Some
» sample entries to boost your computer literacy:
/ }&/ Crufty: poorly built
' * Gweep: hacker suffering from overwork
Phrog: objectionable perosn, between a turkey and a toad
Spazz: to behave erratically
(IM Bogosity: The degree to which something is bogus. (See autobogophobia, the
*-A v fear of becorning bogoified.)
I Besides comically unscrambling the cult language of computer freaks, this work is also the
112 'ii ultimate reference on all the G.C. (garbage collection) of hacker etiquette, fashion, body
» language and sensibility. So don't be a phrog — you can t access, lormat, or interface with
the best of them until you've plugged into The Hacker's Dictionary.
