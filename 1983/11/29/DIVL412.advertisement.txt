You work hard all
your life and what
do you get?
Well, depending
on where you work,
you could get cancer.
Asbestos has been
proven to cause
cancer. Certain toxic
chemicals like for
maldehyde and freon
are being investi
gated. If you've
worked with radioac
tive particles or even
worked near them,
your risk is greater.
And even if you've
worked nowhere
hazardous, it
wouldn't hurt to get
a checkup. Because
the incidence of
cancer after the age
of 45 to 50 increases
rapidly.
Over the next
several years the
American Cancer
Society will be con
ducting more research
into certain lifestyles
and exposures which
could increase cancer
mortality.
So know the
risks.
Don't smoke.
Watch what you
eat and drink.
Look for the
warning signs of
cancer.
And retire not
only with a gold
ticker.
But a healthy
one, also.
