# Study shows decline in humanities degrees

Degrees granted in the
humanities at Stanford have
declined dramatically over the
past seven years, according to a
recent curriculum study con
ducted by a group of University
administrators.
The Stanford Curriculum Study
finds significant declines in
degrees granted in the
humanities, social sciences, and
natural sciences, and large in
creases in degrees granted in en
gineering, earth sciences and in
terdepartmental programs.
On the whole, results of the
study show that Stanford has
mirrored national trends quite
closely. According to the study,
the national decline in the
humanities is probably due to the
growing concern among students
for occupational success and the
widespread perception that
humanities degrees lead to a lim
ited number of jobs.
The study, which examined
data over a 20-year period,
showed that the number of
humanities degrees granted at

Stanford dropped from a high of
approximately 40 percent in 1966-
67, to a low of approximately 18
percent in 1981-82. By contrast
engineering followed an inverse
pattern, rising from a low of ap
proximately 8 percent in 1974, to
a high of more than 16 percent of
all degrees granted in 1981-82.
However, specific degrees
within the social sciences viewed
as vocationally attractive to stu
dents, such as communications
and economics, have not suf
fered such dramatic declines.
Vice Provost Herant
Katchadourian, a sponsor of the
study, and Provost Albert Has
torf, stressed the importance of
the fact that although the number
of humanities majors is going
down, class enrollments in the
humanities have remained con
stant.
"There is clearly a clientele out
there eager to learn about the
humanities. That's terrific,"
agreed Humanities and Sciences
Dean Norman Wessells.
How should Stanford respond
to the changing desires of stu
dents? According to
Katchadourian no immediate

changes are likely.
"We live in a world over which
Stanford has little influence. Stu
dents generate their own values.
We don't control the economy or
the job market affecting student
course choices," said
Katchadourian.
Hastorf agreed, saying that it is
difficult to draw students toward
humanities degrees, "when
everybody wants to be an E.E."
"I have confidence in stu
dents," Katchadourian said.

"They know what's going on.
However, sometimes while wor
rying about jobs, the education
gets short-changed,"he said.
Wessells said trends in student
course choices "swing with the
pendulum," and will not affect
University policy very much.
One possible exception may
be a future relaxation of require
ments for engineering majors, al
lowing more flexiblility in engi
neering students course choices.
