## Some Stern words on Food Service 
### NANETTE ARCHER 
Ask students on campus where they
don't want to eat and they will most likely
tell you Stern Hall.
For as long as most people can remem
ber, Stern has had as its main claim to
fame the reputation for the worst food
around. Why is this? What is the prob
lem? Do they receive seriously inferior
food shipments? Do they use their own
"secret" recipes? Do they purposely
strive to maintain their established
notoreity? Believe it or not, they don't.
And according to those who have worked
in close contact with Stern kitchens over
the years, there's really not a whole lot
that's much different from any of the other
dorm food services. So, the question
remains — why the terrible reputation?
No one seems to have a definite an
swer. Food Service management is aware
of public opinion, but according to senior
Clara Li, a fourth-year Stern hasher, they
generally just "grin and bear it."
"They are willing to listen," claims Eric
Wolf, another senior hasher, "but most

of the complaints they get I don't think
they consider valid."
The cooks get feedback, too — espe
cially in extreme situations. "At least the
head cook (who is bilingual) is aware of
it," states Steve Perez, also a Stern has
her, "maybe not the others (who do not
speak English)." He feels the problems
that do exist are more of "a reflection on
the University system itself than on the
employees."
Having worked for a while in Wilbur
kitchens as well, Perez did notice that
cleanliness standards there were some
what more stringent — "almost to the ex
treme." After sampling nearly all of the
University dorm food services, however,
Perez feels that,"there's really not that
much difference." And Wolf states,
"Eating at Lag is even worse."
Li believes that atmosphere plays a
large part in the anti-Stern stigma. She
points out that Stern is considered the
least desirable of all the on-campus
housing, so naturally it makes sense for
students to vent their frustrations in the

one area where they spend a sizable
chunk of their time — the cafeteria. "Ugly
surroundings make for ugly meals" was
the general consensus of the hashers in
terviewed. Plus, Li notes, Stern doesn't
have any of the "saving graces" available
in some of the other dorms, such as Flo
Mo's continuous stock of ice cream or
Wilbur's on-the-premises bakery — so
there is nothing at all to redeem it from
the typical bland monotony.
And like any other accepted rumor,
regardless of its validity or how it was
started, it's not hard to find enough
evidence to keep it going. Of course, it's
a lot simpler to complain about terrible
food than to actually attempt any innovat
ive alternatives. For many, it provides fun,
conversation and even a sense of
camaraderie (warped as that may sound).
Constant criticism can make an otherwise
ordinary and boring mealtime into a
somewhat more social occasion.
Besides, without its reputation for
abominable food, Stern would be just an
other dorm.

and cooking methods used by Stern Food Service are exactly
