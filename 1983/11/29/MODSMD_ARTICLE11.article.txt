# Foreign students: another kind of Stanford experience
## 
### PAOLO MORANTE 
For Stanford's foreign
students, adjusting to the
American student lifestyle
can be as varied an experi
ence as the backgrounds of
the students themselves.
While some students adapt
easily to their new sur
roundings , others feel it is
not only difficult — but not
even right — to adopt the
customs of their new
residence.
Freshman Ying Li Ren, a
native of the People's

Republic of China, shared
one sentiment common to
his American peers: dissat
isfaction with dorm food.
"Stanford food is not so
great, even worse than high
school in Massachusetts!"
he said. His feelings about
American social life,
however, were mostly posi
tive. Although he found
that people in Massachu
setts were "more willing to
offer their help," he said
that he finds society here
open to him. He added that

he was able to make good
friends during his high
school years.
Graduate student
Amitava Dasgupta, a native
of India, is less enthusiastic
about American social life.
Although he admits that it
is easier for undergradu
ates to find friends than
graduate students, he said
he finds it difficult to es
tablish close friendships
here because American stu
dents are "too concerned


George Fujii/Daily
with excitement" and "less
serious about the philoso
phy of life."
Other students,
however, find this trait to
be a boon rather than a
hindrance for Americans.
The fact that Americans
take a long time to get
serious about life is advan
tageous because when they
finally do become serious
they are better prepared to
handle it, said graduate stu
dent Pojai Poogakupt, a
student from Thailand.
While "very satisfied and
happy about everyday life,"
Poogakupt said she resents
the American govern
ment's treatment of inter
national students as
"aliens."
Students had a variety of
impressions on Stanford
life. "Kids are apathetic
about foreigners," said
South African student
Howard Paine. Georg Mat
salo, a Swedish undergrad
uate, expressed concern
that while the Bechtel Inter
national Center is very
helpful to graduate stu
dents, nothing is really
available for undergradu
ates. Many agreed that
there should be some sort
of "foreign orientation"
period at the beginning of
the year.
Students also said they
were surprised by
Americans' lack of knowl

edge and concern about
other countries. Sopho
more Michal Melamedel,
who asked that her
nationality not be men
tioned, said she was
shocked by the separation
of most of the campus
people from the rest of the
world and by the lack of po-

While foreign
students
appreciated the
opportunity to
study in America,
many said they
came with
negative views of
American culture.
One student came
thinking of
Americans as the
'people with all
the had ideas' and
another identified
America with
consumerism,
competition and
superficiality.

litical discussion on a con
versational level. Fiona Wil
mot, a senior born in
Ireland, and Steve Eastman,
an American-born graduate
student raised in Morocco,
both expressed surprise at
Stanford students' lack of
interest in the problems of
other countries.
The students' reasons for

coming to Stanford are
varied. Paine said one of
the reasons he chose Stan
ford was because it
"promised to be most
similar to home." Disuke
Matsugana, a student from
Japan, came because "my
government decided that I
come to America."
Not all students,
however, had such practi
cal reasons for coming to
Stanford. Belgian graduate
student Paul Algouet came
to Stanford because it of
fered "a lot of action and
excitement, which are not
the case in lots of other
places."
The status of studying in
America is another reason
why foreign students are at
tracted to Stanford.
Poogakupt said she came
simply because going to
school in America is "the
thing to do" in Thailand.
While they value the op
portunity to study here,
many foreign students said
they came to America with
negative views of American
culture. Ren said he came
thinking that Americans
were "the people with all
the bad ideas." Sophomore
Victor Valdivia said he iden
tified America with con
sumerism, competition and
superficiality. When asked
whether his view has
changed after his arrival
here, he replied "It's got
ten even stronger!"
Poogakupt refused to
make any broad statement
about her American coun
terparts, saying that it
would be a "gross
generalization" and "just
unfair to Americans".

appreciated the

litical discussion on a con
versational level. Fiona Wil
mot, a senior born in
Ireland, and Steve Eastman,
an American-born graduate
student raised in Morocco,
both expressed surprise at
Stanford students' lack of
interest in the problems of
other countries.
The students' reasons for

coming to Stanford are
varied. Paine said one of
the reasons he chose Stan
ford was because it
"promised to be most
similar to home." Disuke
Matsugana, a student from
Japan, came because "my
government decided that I
come to America."
Not all students,
however, had such practi
cal reasons for coming to
Stanford. Belgian graduate
student Paul Algouet came
to Stanford because it of
fered "a lot of action and
excitement, which are not
the case in lots of other
places."
The status of studying in
America is another reason
why foreign students are at
tracted to Stanford.
Poogakupt said she came
simply because going to
school in America is "the
thing to do" in Thailand.
While they value the op
portunity to study here,
many foreign students said
they came to America with
negative views of American
culture. Ren said he came
thinking that Americans
were "the people with all
the bad ideas." Sophomore
Victor Valdivia said he iden
tified America with con
sumerism, competition and
superficiality. When asked
whether his view has
changed after his arrival
here, he replied "It's got
ten even stronger!"
Poogakupt refused to
make any broad statement
about her American coun
terparts, saying that it
would be a "gross
generalization" and "just
unfair to Americans".
For Stanford's foreign
students, adjusting to the
American student lifestyle
can be as varied an experi
ence as the backgrounds of
the students themselves.
While some students adapt
easily to their new sur
roundings , others feel it is
not only difficult — but not
even right — to adopt the
customs of their new
residence.
Freshman Ying Li Ren, a
native of the People's

Republic of China, shared
one sentiment common to
his American peers: dissat
isfaction with dorm food.
"Stanford food is not so
great, even worse than high
school in Massachusetts!"
he said. His feelings about
American social life,
however, were mostly posi
tive. Although he found
that people in Massachu
setts were "more willing to
offer their help," he said
that he finds society here
open to him. He added that

he was able to make good
friends during his high
school years.
Graduate student
Amitava Dasgupta, a native
of India, is less enthusiastic
about American social life.
Although he admits that it
is easier for undergradu
ates to find friends than
graduate students, he said
he finds it difficult to es
tablish close friendships
here because American stu
dents are "too concerned

with excitement" and "less
serious about the philoso
phy of life."
Other students,
however, find this trait to
be a boon rather than a
hindrance for Americans.
The fact that Americans
take a long time to get
serious about life is advan
tageous because when they
finally do become serious
they are better prepared to
handle it, said graduate stu
dent Pojai Poogakupt, a
student from Thailand.
While "very satisfied and
happy about everyday life,"
Poogakupt said she resents
the American govern
ment's treatment of inter
national students as
"aliens."
Students had a variety of
impressions on Stanford
life. "Kids are apathetic
about foreigners," said
South African student
Howard Paine. Georg Mat
salo, a Swedish undergrad
uate, expressed concern
that while the Bechtel Inter
national Center is very
helpful to graduate stu
dents, nothing is really
available for undergradu
ates. Many agreed that
there should be some sort
of "foreign orientation"
period at the beginning of
the year.
Students also said they
were surprised by
Americans' lack of knowl

edge and concern about
other countries. Sopho
more Michal Melamedel,
who asked that her
nationality not be men
tioned, said she was
shocked by the separation
of most of the campus
people from the rest of the
world and by the lack of po-
