# Foreign students: another kind of Stanford experience
## 
### PAOLO MORANTE 
For Stanford's foreign
students, adjusting to the
American student lifestyle
can be as varied an experi
ence as the backgrounds of
the students themselves.
While some students adapt
easily to their new sur
roundings , others feel it is
not only difficult — but not
even right — to adopt the
customs of their new
residence.
Freshman Ying Li Ren, a
native of the People's

Republic of China, shared
one sentiment common to
his American peers: dissat
isfaction with dorm food.
"Stanford food is not so
great, even worse than high
school in Massachusetts!"
he said. His feelings about
American social life,
however, were mostly posi
tive. Although he found
that people in Massachu
setts were "more willing to
offer their help," he said
that he finds society here
open to him. He added that

he was able to make good
friends during his high
school years.
Graduate student
Amitava Dasgupta, a native
of India, is less enthusiastic
about American social life.
Although he admits that it
is easier for undergradu
ates to find friends than
graduate students, he said
he finds it difficult to es
tablish close friendships
here because American stu
dents are "too concerned
