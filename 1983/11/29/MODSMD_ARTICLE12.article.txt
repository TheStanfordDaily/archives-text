The State Department last week announced
a new nationwide map ot areas that are
"closed" to Soviet diplomats travelling in this
country. The new map officially designates
Santa Clara County and other parts of the
country as closed to all Soviet diplomats, effec
tively barring Soviet government representa
tives from travelling to the University. These
travel restrictions, which have been in force in
different forms for more than 30 years, are un
necessary as they restrict the free flow of infor
mation in this country.
The need for the travel restrictions is un
clear. It appears that the newly revised
guidelines are part of a Reagan administration
crackdown on technology transfer. The closed
areas include most of the nation's defense in
dustry centers. But these travel restrictions are
probably ineffective against true Soviet spies.
U.S. officials can easily keep track of Soviet
diplomatic missions as these groups must ob
tain approved itineraries before they travel
outside major cities. Moreover, the nationwide

map of officially closed areas will not hinder a
Soviet spy bent on espionage.
State Department officials deny they
imposed the restrictions in order to curb Soviet
espionage. They justify the restrictions on a
principle of reciprocity, saying, " They do it to
our diplomats so we will do it to theirs." But
the State Department must realize this policy
will not work. The Soviet government is not
going to open its society to Americans in
response to U.S. restrictions on Soviet
diplomats.
The guidelines are not only ineffective, but
are dangerous because they restrict the flow of
ideas in this country. Under the restrictions,
Soviet diplomats are not allowed to travel to
many parts of the country in order to present
Soviet policy positions. In the past, Soviet
diplomats have come here about once a year to
give talks or to participate in panel discussions.
These restrictions on foreign diplomats cer
tainly do more harm than good. They do not
belong in a society which prides itself on being
open and free.
