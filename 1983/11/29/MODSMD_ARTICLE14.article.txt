# Tolerance for morality
## 
### 
Atop my list of local pleasures is
working another undergraduate
into a particular frenzy during which
he (as was recently the case) inter
rupts me and announces with pious
shock, "That is such a VALUE JUDG
MENT!" Since this is such a
remarkable observation, I, a friend
of value judgments, usually let Bal
boa pose on the cliff of discovery a
bit before pushing him off with one
of my own: Goodness, life is a
whole pattern of value judgments
and we had best pick among them.
However, we are not picking. In
stead, for four years of our lives, we
modern youths are asked to shelve
moral assertiveness and embrace or
tolerate, as flexibly as fly rods, even
the most objectionable common be
havior. If this sounds strange — and
it should — it is because life is so
contrary to such clean ideas; but
college life is somehow not, or
should not be, so the story goes, be
cause it is one's only opportunity to
encounter new ideas and habits
with an open mind. Extreme
tolerance and general freedom from
restraint bring marvelous benefits to
student life, and my, but we enjoyed
this very freedom just a few days
ago.
Big Game, one of Stanford's few
dabblings with tradition, vents emo
tion in a place that needs more
vents, and this year produced a new
twist: collective obscenity. A terse,
unimaginative slogan, popular simp
ly for its irreverence, popped up in
classes, libraries, shopping centers
and, of course, in downtown San
Francisco — even on the shirts of
University security — and quickly
became a cheer. That many were

disgusted is not at all surprising, nor
is it that objection was muted. After
all, when one is not free to object,
one must bear the objectionable.
"Oh, come on," once said a
friend after I noted obscene slang in
his conversation with a professor,
"everyone's heard that before."
True, but irrelevant. The acquaint
ance of the general public with the
offensive is not at issue; that offense
should have to be endured con
stantly in the whims of a few and
even be associated with the many is
the notion in question. Simply put,
do persons enjoy the "right" to ask
that others not behave in a fashion
seen as offensive? If atmospheres
could speak, that at Stanford would
scream, "No!"
One little idea is the fault beneath
that answer, one which holds that
persons with widely dissimilar
morals and manners can all live to
gether like Waltons; all this requires
is another idea, one easily twisted:
mutual respect, to be read
"tolerance." Practical respect,
however, demands some sort of
common ground, and tolerance has
natural limits, so all-important co
existence turns into tension or indif
ference. As with all moral issues,
this bears first and foremost on
campus manners.
"I want to bang out rhythms of
love with Amanda seven nights a
week in my bed above yours," says
Bob to his roommate Pete, tossing
the ball in his lap. The tendency
today is to accept Bob's appetite for
sex as a given and to look instead to
Pete — well, Pete? Once upon a
time, of course, the issue would
have been Bob: "Who are you (Bob)

to demand so unreasonably of
others" rather than "who are you
(Pete) to limit my exuberance?"
The same works in residences in
which someone insists that someth
ing controversial be purchased for
parties using general funds; the fail
ure at "mutual respect" is not with
those who object, as they reason
ably feel compelled to do, but is in
stead with those who by their ac
tions force moral dilemmas on
others. Minds should not be asked
to open so that brains can fall out.
The simplest solution is that
which has been discarded: discre
tion, which means respecting the
moral sensibilities of others rather
than indignantly demanding that
they endure one's own excesses.
Yes, this is a reversal and an imposi
tion, one which contradicts an age
of indulgence by recognizing not
only that all people have morals and
manners of sorts, but that they need
them; it is these various limitations
which merit "respect," not acts of
breaking them by others. A more
healthy diversity thus replaces an
uncomfortable one.
Some, of course, refuse to concur
and go on, say, screaming and ped
dling little obscenities simply be
cause they like to do so. The rest,
still, are usually too polite or bored
to object but at least learn one of
life's lessons: just as moral
egalitarianism is the odor of in
security, demands for "tolerance"
are so often the stench of the in
tolerable.
