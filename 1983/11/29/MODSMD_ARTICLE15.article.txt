## Speaking in different worlds 
### 
With last week's arrival of the first U.S. cruise
missiles in Britain, the recent showing of ABC's contro
versial movie, "The Day After," and the continuing im
passe at the negotiating table in Geneva, the debate
over nuclear weaponry has reached a fever pitch. Sta
tistics fly back and forth across the front pages, describ
ing the present balance or imbalance of power.
For all the attention paid to throw-weights, MIRVed
missiles, SS-20s, and ASAT systems in the last few years,
though, the fact remains that the potential for hostili
ties between the two superpowers is far greater today
than it was in 1980. The discussion has deteriorated into
a shouting match between those who advocate an over
whelmingly strong defense and those who recoil in
horror at the very concept of nuclear deterrence.

On one side, the boogeymen of
communist expansionism, on
the other, the horror of individ
ual helplessness in the face of a
possible thermonuclear inferno.

Last Thursday the Italian House here on campus
served as the backdrop for a miniature display of the
bitter "debate" over nuclear policy. A first secretary of
the British embassy in Washington, Stephen Band, sat
down to talk about the "Soviet threat" with Grazia Bor
rini, an Italian physicist and anti-nuclear activist. While
the two speakers doubtlessly meant well in coming to
discuss the issue, they could not have expected the
confrontation would be anything more than frustrating.
Each came armed with a powerful understanding of the
technical end of the nuclear debate and a quiver full of
statistical arrows. They quoted similar facts and figures,
but they were speaking of different worlds.
The integration of military production and the civilian
economy in both the U.S. and USSR, announced Bor
rini, makes it impossible to speak of a Soviet threat
without considering the U.S. threat and the power
game between the two countries. The desire of a small
segment of society to control a nation's war-making
capacity provides the moving force behind the arms
race. The Geneva talks will fail, she predicted, because
failure is in the interest of the men on both sides of the
negotiating table.

Band spoke of the Soviet empire and the Russian his
tory of the use of force. Europeans, he said, cannot
ignore the fact that the Soviets have used force on the
European continent in the all-too-recent past. Czechs
did not die in the streets of Prague through some quirk
in the power game between the superpowers. The
Soviets only understand force, because they are a su
perpower on the strength of their military alone.
The two could not find a common ground on which
to fight. If Band argued some fine point of deterrent
theory, Borrini responded with a graphic description of
the horror of an all-out nuclear exchange. If the Italians
spoke of the need for a decisive reduction in nuclear
weapons, the first secretary ignored the question and
went on to more technical issues. "Yes," he said with a
condescending smile, "You're completely wrong."
The reaction of the audience reflected the confusion
of the public at large. They expected a debate, a direct
clash on the facts and the issues, but instead what they
received was a series of pronouncements. Band and
Borrini spoke past each other. To form a rational posi
tion based on the exchange was an impossibility. And
so, while Band came across as somewhat more intellec
tually precise, the crowd's heart and sympathy went to
Borrini.
The two perspectives were clearly irreconcilable, yet
it is painfully apparent that some reconciliation must be
made. American cruise missiles are already in place in
Britain, and Pershing II missiles will arrive in West Ger
many any day. Perhaps Britain will weather the cruise
without major turmoil, but Germany will not be so
placid come the Pershings.
A schizophrenia plagues the public discussion of
these events. Both sides are at pains to emphasize the
technical correctness of their respective positions, but
they ignore the fundamental conflict between two dif
fering views of the world that underlies the entire
debate. Band and Borrini appealed to the rational ele
ment in their audience, but what was left after all was
said and done was pure emotion: On one side, the
boogeyman of communist expansionism, on the other,
the horror of individual helplessness in the face of a
possible thermonuclear inferno.
Such imagery is all well and good in the abstract, in a
plush house on a university campus, but to rely on
these images to form the foundation of a policy to
prevent the extermination of humanity can only be
called irresponsible. What is needed today is compro
mise, whether in Geneva or in Bonn. Let's hope the
advocates on both sides will muster the courage to
leave their opposing worlds and come back to the real
one.

With last week's arrival of the first U.S. cruise
missiles in Britain, the recent showing of ABC's contro
versial movie, "The Day After," and the continuing im
passe at the negotiating table in Geneva, the debate
over nuclear weaponry has reached a fever pitch. Sta
tistics fly back and forth across the front pages, describ
ing the present balance or imbalance of power.
For all the attention paid to throw-weights, MIRVed
missiles, SS-20s, and ASAT systems in the last few years,
though, the fact remains that the potential for hostili
ties between the two superpowers is far greater today
than it was in 1980. The discussion has deteriorated into
a shouting match between those who advocate an over
whelmingly strong defense and those who recoil in
horror at the very concept of nuclear deterrence.

On one side, the boogeymen of
communist expansionism, on
the other, the horror of individ
ual helplessness in the face of a
possible thermonuclear inferno.

Last Thursday the Italian House here on campus
served as the backdrop for a miniature display of the
bitter "debate" over nuclear policy. A first secretary of
the British embassy in Washington, Stephen Band, sat
down to talk about the "Soviet threat" with Grazia Bor
rini, an Italian physicist and anti-nuclear activist. While
the two speakers doubtlessly meant well in coming to
discuss the issue, they could not have expected the
confrontation would be anything more than frustrating.
Each came armed with a powerful understanding of the
technical end of the nuclear debate and a quiver full of
statistical arrows. They quoted similar facts and figures,
but they were speaking of different worlds.
The integration of military production and the civilian
economy in both the U.S. and USSR, announced Bor
rini, makes it impossible to speak of a Soviet threat
without considering the U.S. threat and the power
game between the two countries. The desire of a small
segment of society to control a nation's war-making
capacity provides the moving force behind the arms
race. The Geneva talks will fail, she predicted, because
failure is in the interest of the men on both sides of the
negotiating table.

Band spoke of the Soviet empire and the Russian his
tory of the use of force. Europeans, he said, cannot
ignore the fact that the Soviets have used force on the
European continent in the all-too-recent past. Czechs
did not die in the streets of Prague through some quirk
in the power game between the superpowers. The
Soviets only understand force, because they are a su
perpower on the strength of their military alone.
The two could not find a common ground on which
to fight. If Band argued some fine point of deterrent
theory, Borrini responded with a graphic description of
the horror of an all-out nuclear exchange. If the Italians
spoke of the need for a decisive reduction in nuclear
weapons, the first secretary ignored the question and
went on to more technical issues. "Yes," he said with a
condescending smile, "You're completely wrong."
The reaction of the audience reflected the confusion
of the public at large. They expected a debate, a direct
clash on the facts and the issues, but instead what they
received was a series of pronouncements. Band and
Borrini spoke past each other. To form a rational posi
tion based on the exchange was an impossibility. And
so, while Band came across as somewhat more intellec
tually precise, the crowd's heart and sympathy went to
Borrini.
The two perspectives were clearly irreconcilable, yet
it is painfully apparent that some reconciliation must be
made. American cruise missiles are already in place in
Britain, and Pershing II missiles will arrive in West Ger
many any day. Perhaps Britain will weather the cruise
without major turmoil, but Germany will not be so
placid come the Pershings.
A schizophrenia plagues the public discussion of
these events. Both sides are at pains to emphasize the
technical correctness of their respective positions, but
they ignore the fundamental conflict between two dif
fering views of the world that underlies the entire
debate. Band and Borrini appealed to the rational ele
ment in their audience, but what was left after all was
said and done was pure emotion: On one side, the
boogeyman of communist expansionism, on the other,
the horror of individual helplessness in the face of a
possible thermonuclear inferno.
Such imagery is all well and good in the abstract, in a
plush house on a university campus, but to rely on
these images to form the foundation of a policy to
prevent the extermination of humanity can only be
called irresponsible. What is needed today is compro
mise, whether in Geneva or in Bonn. Let's hope the
advocates on both sides will muster the courage to
leave their opposing worlds and come back to the real
one.
