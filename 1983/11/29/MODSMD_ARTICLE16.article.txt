The week after
Last Sunday night I had the
privilege of viewing "The Day
After," with a large group of stu
dents at Florence Moore Hall and
leading a discussion about the
effects of nuclear weapons. The
questioners not only sought an
understanding of the technical
aspects (electromagnetic pulse,
fallout, radiation sickness, etc.) but
also of the underlying topics such
as deterrence, launch on warning
and the possible causes of a nuclear
war.
I was struck by the incisiveness of
the questions, but I was struck, and
heartened, far more by the attitude
of indignation. They were properly
indignant at the flawed legacy with
which they were starting their adult
lives. One may call it hindsight, but
they recognized that the policies of
the past 40 years have brought the
world to the point that this movie
was not science fiction. I was hear
tened because their indignation
was mixed with a quiet determina
tion that their generation would act
to reverse the arms race rather than
accept the inexorbility of extinc
tion.
I may have led the discussion,
but in the greater sense, I followed.

The discussants of "The Day
After" all agreed that there was no
chance of reducing nuclear arms in
the next 15 or 20 years to anything
like a safe level for the survival of a
planet. Clearly, we are going to
have to live with total threat for a
long time. Of course we always
have: At any time the planet is
vulnerable to unforeseen cosmic
disaster.

So we can go on this way. And
since there is no way "back" to
safety — though, like the Quakers,
we oughtn't to give up trying in the
hope of eventually achieving that in
a better time — there is every rea
son to go forward to meet the So
viet challenge which threatens
freedom everywhere, even at con
siderably greater cost than we are
now paying.
hlow much is our, and others'
freedom worth in these terms? To
move from our 6 percent of gross
national product toward the 12 the
Russians are now expending for
military purposes would not seem
to be unreasonable at all. And at no
increased risk, since the risk is
already entire. On the contrary, the

risk at all levels short of that would
diminish, for the same reason that
nuclear war seems unlikely:
credible deterrence.
Which means that a lot of the
new effort should go toward con
ventional arms and soldiering. Let's
stop the communists at all levels,
until their people, already hard
pressed economically, realize what
a losing proposition their dream of
world domination is.
We have immense advantages,
materially and technically, in this
rivalry, as former Defense Secretary
Robert McNamara observed. All we
have to do is get off our sentimen
tal and defeatist butts and do some
thing beautiful for ourselves and
mankind for a change, as opposed

to just getting fat and playing video
games. That would be the best way
to honor the memory of John F.
Kennedy.

We shouldn't let television's
"The Day After" make us give up in
despair. There's a good chance that
we can prevent nuclear war, if
enough people will think about
how we got into this mess and then
vote as if their lives depend on it.
We're in this mess because nei
ther side is willing to let the other
side get ahead in the arms race,
even though both sides have far

more missiles than there is any use
for. The Russians have a frightful
political system, but they know a
nuclear war would destroy both
countries, and they don't want to
get blown up any more than we do.
In pre-Reagan days they signed
treaties with us that provided the
first steps toward arms control.
But President Reagan only makes
proposals that Russia obviously
won't accept, like reducing land
based missiles, in which Russia is
ahead, without reducing
submarine-based missiles, in which
we are ahead. Reagan's staff even
talks as if nuclear war were win
nable. Congress keeps on voting
money for missiles, even though
our new missiles will greatly in-

crease the likelihood of accidental
nuclear war.
Clearly, we must elect a president
and congress who will put top
priority on preventing nuclear war.

"If ever the world sees a time
when women shall r jme together
purely and simply for the benefit of
mankind, it will be a power such as
the world has never known!" Un
der the umbrella of this statement,
made 100 years ago by Matthew
Arnold, 2700 women representing
34 states and several countries
gathered for a convocation to ex
plore the vision of the world
beyond war.
We have reached a point in his
tory when nuclear weapons can not
be used to fight a war but only to
commit global suicide. We are
convinced that war is no longer a
viable means of resolving conflict
and that we need to move forward
toward a new mode of thinking,
BEYOND WAR.
The current military budget for
1984 stands at $250 billion. This
figure is 50 percent larger than the
combined federal outlays for
health, environment, transporta

enforcement. If only 10 percent of
this budget were spent on agricul
tural development, the world's
hunger problem would be solved
by the year 2000.
Past experience has demon
strated how an idea can be
translated into reality when people
are committed to its pursuit: the
abolition of slavery, women's right

ourselves to making this vision of a

move from our 6 percent of gross
national product toward the 12 the
Russians are now expending for
military purposes would not seem
to be unreasonable at all. And at no
increased risk, since the risk is
already entire. On the contrary, the

risk at all levels short of that would
diminish, for the same reason that
nuclear war seems unlikely:
credible deterrence.

We shouldn't let television's
"The Day After" make us give up in
despair. There's a good chance that
we can prevent nuclear war, if
enough people will think about
how we got into this mess and then
vote as if their lives depend on it.
We're in this mess because nei
ther side is willing to let the other
side get ahead in the arms race,
even though both sides have far

more missiles than there is any use
for. The Russians have a frightful
political system, but they know a
nuclear war would destroy both
countries, and they don't want to
get blown up any more than we do.
In pre-Reagan days they signed
treaties with us that provided the
first steps toward arms control.
But President Reagan only makes
proposals that Russia obviously
won't accept, like reducing land
based missiles, in which Russia is
ahead, without reducing
submarine-based missiles, in which
we are ahead. Reagan's staff even
talks as if nuclear war were win
nable. Congress keeps on voting
money for missiles, even though
our new missiles will greatly in-

crease the likelihood of accidental
nuclear war.
Clearly, we must elect a president
and congress who will put top
priority on preventing nuclear war.

"If ever the world sees a time
when women shall r jme together
purely and simply for the benefit of
mankind, it will be a power such as
the world has never known!" Un
der the umbrella of this statement,
made 100 years ago by Matthew
Arnold, 2700 women representing
34 states and several countries
gathered for a convocation to ex
plore the vision of the world
beyond war.
We have reached a point in his
tory when nuclear weapons can not
be used to fight a war but only to
commit global suicide. We are
convinced that war is no longer a
viable means of resolving conflict
and that we need to move forward
toward a new mode of thinking,
BEYOND WAR.
The current military budget for
1984 stands at $250 billion. This
figure is 50 percent larger than the
combined federal outlays for
health, environment, transporta
tion, natural resources and law
enforcement. If only 10 percent of
this budget were spent on agricul
tural development, the world's
hunger problem would be solved
by the year 2000.
Past experience has demon
strated how an idea can be
translated into reality when people
are committed to its pursuit: the

ourselves to making this vision of a
world without war a reality.

The week after
Last Sunday night I had the
privilege of viewing "The Day
After," with a large group of stu
dents at Florence Moore Hall and
leading a discussion about the
effects of nuclear weapons. The
questioners not only sought an
understanding of the technical
aspects (electromagnetic pulse,
fallout, radiation sickness, etc.) but
also of the underlying topics such
as deterrence, launch on warning
and the possible causes of a nuclear
war.
I was struck by the incisiveness of
the questions, but I was struck, and
heartened, far more by the attitude
of indignation. They were properly
indignant at the flawed legacy with
which they were starting their adult
lives. One may call it hindsight, but
they recognized that the policies of
the past 40 years have brought the
world to the point that this movie
was not science fiction. I was hear
tened because their indignation
was mixed with a quiet determina
tion that their generation would act
to reverse the arms race rather than
accept the inexorbility of extinc
tion.
I may have led the discussion,
but in the greater sense, I followed.

The discussants of "The Day
After" all agreed that there was no
chance of reducing nuclear arms in
the next 15 or 20 years to anything
like a safe level for the survival of a
planet. Clearly, we are going to
have to live with total threat for a
long time. Of course we always
have: At any time the planet is
vulnerable to unforeseen cosmic
disaster.

So we can go on this way. And
since there is no way "back" to
safety — though, like the Quakers,
we oughtn't to give up trying in the
hope of eventually achieving that in
a better time — there is every rea
son to go forward to meet the So
viet challenge which threatens
freedom everywhere, even at con
siderably greater cost than we are
now paying.
hlow much is our, and others'
freedom worth in these terms? To
move from our 6 percent of gross
national product toward the 12 the
Russians are now expending for
military purposes would not seem
