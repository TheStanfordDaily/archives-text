# University will revise plans for Inner Quad
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Because of substantial opposition,
the Project Management Office has
decided to revise the Inner Quad
renovation plan and place more em
phasis on the historical aspect of the
project.
Max Mazenko, project manager of
the renovation, said this revision
will not affect reconstruction of the
Quad, which is planned to start this
summer, nor will it push the project
over budget.
Mazenko said the Project Man
agement Office made provisions in
its budget for revision of the plan.
Despite the change in design em
phasis, some opponents of the proj
ect remain dissatisfied. Gerard Kos
kovich, an art history graduate stu
dent who has led the opposition to
the current project, said a new plan
will have "some problems with it,"
because it will be done by the same
architect who produced the first
design, Anthony Guzzardo and As
sociates of San Francisco.

Instead, he said the University
should change the architect and
develop a whole new plan for the
renovation.
Law Prof. John Merryman also
said Guzzardo should be replaced,
unless his new design is superior to
the original plans of Frederick Law
Olmsted, landscape architect of the
campus at the turn of the century.
"If this is an example (of his
work), maybe we should turn else
where," he said.
Mazenko, however, said that
changing architects "is not in the
cards right now." He said Guz
zardo's first design was developed
exactly as the University requested
him to develop it. Mazenko said the
Project Management Office has no
plans, "on the basis of what we've
done so far, to change our design
team."
According to Mazenko, the new
plans will address three aspects of
the project which those seeking a
historically accurate plan had found
objectionable in the current plans
These include:

• reducing the diameter of the
planting circles, which the architect
had originally decided to increase to
88 feet in diameter.
• paving the Quad with a uniform
material, and thus eliminating the
two pathways that now bisect the
Quad.
. changing the plants used in the
planting circles. The original plans
had called for grass in these, but
those seeking a historical interpreta
tion had found this historically inac
curate.
Koskovich said these proposals
were good as far as they went, but
he noted that some of the assump
tions they make are historically inac
curate. For instance, the revised
plans will modify the proposed seat
walls around each planting circle,

but, Koskovich said, the historical
plans for the Quad, as designed by
Olmsted make no mention of seat
walls at all.
The controversy surrounding the
project has recently generated sig
nificant interest in the plans. When
the Project Management Office
sponsored presentations on the
project late last year and this sum
mer, attendance was sparse.
However, a meeting on the project
earlier this month which was
moderated by Turner and Koskovich
drew almost 100 people, according
to the forum's organizers.
After the architect submits the
new plans, Mazenko said they
would undergo the same review
process as the first plans.
