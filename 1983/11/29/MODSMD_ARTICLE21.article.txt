## Hewlett-Packard tourney next on hoop agenda Stanford sloppy, but still blasts Bemidji State 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The Stanford basketball team, as dem
onstrated by its 98-59 destruction of
Bemidji State last night in Maples
Pavilion, is still winning big. But it's also
winning ugly.
The Cardinal, which improved its
record to 2-0, outscored its NCAA Divi
sion II opponents from Minnesota 56-30
in the second half to record its second big
win in three nights. Stanford broke a 14-
year-old school team scoring record in its
115-74 victory over Hawaii Pacific Satur
day afternoon.
But while Stanford looked razor sharp
against the Sea Warriors, the Card was a
mess last night. And the same could be
said for Bemidji State, which dropped to
0-4 with the loss.
The two teams raced up and down the
floor and instead of trading baskets,
traded turnovers. Stanford turned the ball
over 36 times and Bemidji State 38.
Against Hawaii Pacific, Stanford commit
ted just 15 "Cardinal sins."

Nonetheless, senior center John Revelli
was his usual dominant self, scoring a
game-high 21 points and sweeping the
backboards for 12 rebounds in 27 minutes
of action. Stanford's other star senior,
guard Keith Jones, had 20 points of his
own (7-of-11 from the floor) in 24 minutes
to go with his team-high five assists.
Also for Stanford, sophomore toward
Andy Fischer scored a career high 13
points and junior forward Hans Wichary
contributed 12. Sophomore forward Earl
koberlein had nine rebounds.
Although Stanford Coach Tom Davis
and his players were reluctant to admit it,
the Card seemed to have visions of North
Carolina — the nation's No. 2-ranked
team — dancing in its head last night.
It Stanford beats San Jose State Friday
night in the first round of the Hewlett-
Packard/Stanford Invitational, it will play
the winner of the North Carolina-
Fordham match-up Saturday night in the
tournament final.
Davis, however, warned against

looking past the Spartans. "To beat San
Jose State, we're going to need every
thing we have," he said. "They're going
to be fired up and ready to play, espe
cially with the history of the football rivar
ly between the two schools." The Spar
tans have defeated the Cardinal the last
three years in the annual football contest.
"Right now, we just can't look ahead to
North Carolina," Fischer said. "San Jose
State is an awfully good team."
For a few moments in the second half,
it looked as if Stanford had its hands full
with a physical Bemidji State squad. The
Beavers scored the first four points of the
second period to cut a 42-29 Stanford
halftime lead to nine points.
But Stanford's full-court press suddenly
began to yield dividends and in less than
1:30, the Card ran off 13 unanswered
points. With 17:04 left in the game, Stan
ford led 55-33 and Bemidji State was his
tory.


Stanford center John Revelli slams home two of his game-high 21 points in last night's 98-">9
win over Bemidji State. Revelli, who also pulled down 12 rebounds, has scored at least 20
points in each of the Cardinal's two games this season.
