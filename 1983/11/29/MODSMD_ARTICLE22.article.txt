# Card pressure defense key to win
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Stanford's 98-59 victory
over Bemidji State Monday
night was one that would
bring a smile to the face of
lack Ramsey or Bobby
Knight.
Or even Cardinal Coach
Tom Davis.
While Stanford's point
total makes it look like the
Cardinal came to Maples
Pavilion merely to outscore
its Minnesota visitors and
trot away satisfied with a 2-0

slate, the home team won
the game with good old fas
hioned, nose-to-the
grindstone defense.
As Ramsey, the coach of
the NBA's Portland
Trailblazers, or University
of Indiana boss
Knight — who preach
defense like Fuller does
brushes — might happily
proclaim after such a big
win, the Cardinal won it
with 'The Tough D'.
In the first half, the Car

dinal looked as if had
drained its scoring tank
with its 115-point outing
against Hawaii-Pacific, un
spectacularly building a
precarious 42-29 lead.
Turnovers were a main
reason. Stanford presented
Bemidji State with 18 gifts
in the first half — it had but
15 all day Saturday — but
the Beavers were nearly as
generous with 17 miscues.
Except for John Revelli's
breakaway slam dunk, the
first half silenced the 3,013
gate and had it wondering
who was winning on Mon
day Night Football.
Stanford's inten
sity — and, corresponding
ly, its lead — picked up
once the screws tightened
on defense in the second
half. Davis and his charges
turned their collective
screwdriver with full- and
half-court presses — and
not a moment too soon.
Bemidji State opened the
second half with two
straight baskets, cutting the
Cardinal's intermission
lead to nine, 42-33. Enter
the press — full court and
fully effective.
Senior Keith Jones hit
two free throws and Revel
li, who led all dressed in
rebounds and scoring,
tossed in a five-footer.
Stanford ignited the crowd
and effectively finished off
the Beavers when two
steals resulted in two Andy
Fischer lay-ups. The eight
point spurt, directly at

tributable to the Cardinal's
slick, tough press, put the
lead to 17 and the lid on the
game.
Fischer, who scored a
career-high 13 points and
spent less time than usual
diving for loose balls, said
the press' timing was right.
"We saw we were only
up by nine (and) we really
thought we had to put that
pressure on," Fischer said
after the game. "I think
with that pressure we
surprised them, and we got
them out of their tempo.
We (then) were playing
them the way we wanted
to, and I think that's what
really hurt them and helped
us."
While Stanford's press
derailed Bemidji State's ex
press, the pressure tactic is
not yet at the point where it
will stop UCLA and Oregon
State — the perennial Pac
-10 pace setters — or the
Division I likes of Fordham,
San Jose State and feared
North Carolina which will
invade the Farm Friday.
"It's got to get better,"
said Davis, who spoke
more of the upcoming
tournament than he did of
last night's whitewashing.
"I thought we had some
glimpses of it at its best, but
overall it's still not up to
what it was last year. We're
capable of being a much
better pressure team than
we were a year ago. We do
need work in that area."
