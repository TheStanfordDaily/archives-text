# Marino leads Miami to win
## 
### 
Miami (AP) â€” Dan Marino
threw for three touchdowns,
two to Mark Duper, and the
Miami defense forced four
turnovers last night as the Dol
phins beat the Cincinnati Ben
gals 38-14.
Marino's scoring strikes of
seven and 15 yards to Duper
and three yards to tight end
Dan Johnson enabled the Dol
phins to boost their record to
9-4 and open a two-game lead
over Buffalo in the American
Conference East.
Cincinnati, its playoff hopes
all but gone, committed two
fumbles and Ken Anderson
threw two interceptions as the
Bengals fell to 5-8 with three
games left in the National
Football season.

Tony Nathan, on a one-yard
drive, and Andra Franklin on a
five-yard run, also scored
touchdowns and Uwe von
Schamann kicked a 47-yard
field goal for Miami.
Anderson and Isaac Curtis
hooked up on an 80-yard pass
for one of Cincinnati's touch
downs. The Bengals also
scored on a one-yard plunge
by their massive, 270-pound
fullback, Pete Johnson.
Those second-quarter
scores cut Miami's halftime
lead to 17-14. But Duper's 15-
yard catch 4:08 into the third
quarter, following a shanked,
20-yard punt by Cincinnati's
Pat Mclnally, enabled the Dol
phins to begin pulling away.
FHardy's catch came in the
opening minute of the fourth

period and Franklin scored
with 6:02 to play.
The victory, coming on the
day the Dolphins announced
Coach Don Shula had signed a
new, rich, long-term contract,
completed a sweep by all 14
home teams in the NFL's
weekend of games.
It began Thursday in Detroit
(over Pittsburgh) and Dallas
(over St. Louis), continued
with 10 games Sunday and
wound up before a sellout
crowd of 74,506 in the Orange
Bowl.
Marino, the AFC's leading
passer, completed 18 of 29
passes for 217 yards while An
derson, tearing apart the
Miami secondary, hit 23 of .56
for 342.
