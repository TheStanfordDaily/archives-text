# Card spikers seeded 4th

The Stanford women's vol
leyball team is seeded fourth
in the NCAA post-season
tournament and receives a
first-round bye, but its road to
the Final Four is by no means
paved.
Stanford, which received
news of its No. 4 seeding yes
terday, is ranked by the NCAA
behind Hawaii, the University
of the Pacific and UCLA. The
Card Card has lost to UCLA
and Hawaii three times each,
but defeated UOP in the their
only meeting.
Hawaii, the top seed, will
play in the South Regional,
No. 2 UOP in the Northwest
Regional, UCLA in the Mideast
Regional and Stanford in the
West Regional — the toughest
of the four groupings.
The tournament consists of
28 total teams, with seven in
each regional. The top-seeded
team in each regional receives
a first-round bye while the
other six teams play prelimi
nary elimination matches.
In the West Regional at San
Diego State, Stanford does not
have to play until Dec. 9, when
it meets the winner of the
Brigham Young-Arizona State
Dec. 4 preliminary match.
Should the Card win Dec. 9, it
would face one of four other
teams — USC, Arizona,
Colorado State or San Diego
State — a day later in the West
Regional final.
The four regional winners
then advance to the Final Four
Dec. 16-18 in Lexington, ky.,
on the campus of the Univer
sity of Kentucky, where the
national championship will be
decided.
In one semi-final, the win
ners of the West and South
Regionals will play while the
champions of the Mideast and
Northwest Regionals will play
in the other semi-final. In
other words, should the top
four seeds advance to the
Final Four, Stanford would
take on Hawaii and UOP
would plav UCLA in the semis.
