## Women hoopsters take on UOP 
### JOHN LIS 
Coming off a last-minute
73-72 victory over San lose
State Friday night, the Stan
ford women's basketball
team returns home to
Maples Pavilion to host the
University of the Pacific
tonight at 7:30 p.in.
The ligers are 2-1 so far
this year. In the Cal Poly
Classic, they placed fifth,
losing to UC-lrvine before
posting victories over Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and
San Francisco State.
Pacific has a good corps
of returning players, and all
five starters have varsity ex
perience. The Tigers are a
strong defensive team, and
are led by guards Sandy
Kline, a 5-foot-9 junior, and
Shelly Linder, a 5-6 sopho
more.
Pacific also has good size
on the front line. Center
Joy Dana is a 6-3 senior who
led the Tigers in rebound
ing last season with 8.8 per
game and was second on
the team in scoring with an
11.1 average. Starting at the
forwards will be 6-2 junior
Jane Rhomberg and 6-1
sophomore Janet Otto,
while 6-4 freshman Janet
Jones will see time off the
bench.
Stanford will employ a
different approach from
the one it used against San
Jose State. Friday the Car
dinal tried to stop the Spar
tans' transition game and
succeeded in doing so.
Tonight Head Coach Dotty
McCrea hopes to use the
Cardinal's own running
game against the relatively
slow front line of UOP.
"We'll try to up the tempo
this time," she said.
Stanford is now 2-1 on
the season, having
defeated Santa Ciara and
San Jose State on the road
after an opening loss at
home to Fresno State. The
Cardinal hasn't won yet at
Maples, and McCrea said,
"We'd like to win this one
at home."
Sophomore center Sarah
Evans has led the Cardinal
attack through the first
three games. She is averag

ing 14.3 points and 10
rebounds an outing thus
far, including a 21-point,
13-rebound performance at
San Jose State.
Sophomore guard Vir
ginia Sourlis, who last year
received Freshman All-
America recognitioi . is

playing well again this
season at the point. Sourlis
is scoring 14 points per
game, including an 18-
point outburst in the
season opener, and has
dished out 4.3 assists por
contest as well.
Junior forward Mary

Bradach (12.7 points per
game, 8.3 rebounds per
game), freshman forward
Kim Mercer (11.7 ppg, 3.7
rpg), and freshman guard
Erica Mueser (5.3 ppg, 5.3
T.g, 5.7 assists) round out
the Cardinal's starting five
f< tonight.
