## The 						Stones go' Undercover', cut a winner 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Recently, the Rolling Stones
signed a new record contract
with Columbia Records
rumored to be worth about
$28 million. Therefore, their
upcoming record release
would be their last on the At
lantic label which has dis
tributed the Stones' own
label, "Rolling Stones
Records," since 1971's Sticky
Fingers album. That's a long
time to stay with one record
! company and the fact that the
. Stones are switching labels
after more than 12 years indi
cates that some major falling
out must have occurred be
tween the Stones and Atlantic.
Therefore, I assumed that
their last Atlantic album would
just be a throwaway album,
one to just satisfy the require
ments of their old record con
tract. I didn't expect much and
when I got to hear a few ad
vance cuts, I was not initially
thrilled with what I heard. The
single, "Undercover of the
Night" utilized a synthesized
drum track beating away over
Charlie Watts' always depend
able drumming and I consid
ered it downright sacrilegious
to overdub drum over Watts'
playing.
However, my initial feelings
towards that song were soon
to be reversed. Slowly, new
aspects of the song were
being uncovered to my ears.

The incessant drum and syn
thesized track were setting up
quite an ominous beat over
which was displayed some of
the meanest guitar licks ever
on a Stones record. Even Jag
ger sounded scared and the
lyrics were filled with deadly
militaristic overtones.
Therefore, by the time the al
bum was to be released, I was
eagerly awaiting it. The album
is entitled Undercover, and
ironically, it proves not to be
the quick throwaway record
that I had foreseen. Instead,
Undercover is a supremely
hard rocking dance album that
is easily the best album that
the Stones have recorded
since 1972's classic Exile On
Main Street.
So what is it about this al
bum that allows me to praise it
so highly especially since my
initial opinion of some of the
songs was of disappointment?
Basically, Undercover is an al
bum that doesn't present all of
its riches at once. The album
keeps a lot under-cover, and
so, one must get underneath
its initial outer appearance
before one can truly appreci
ate it. When the listener al
lows the time to do this, he
will find a classic band still
taking chances and succeed
ing. The Stones may have
wallowed in excess and
boredom at times, but here
they have tapped into a new

power source. The musical
gains made on 1981's Tattoo
You album are now fully
developed and amplified
which results in the Stones
living up to their claim as the
world's greatest rock and roll
band once again.
Undercover displays some
of the finest playing in a long
time by the Stones as a tightly
unified band. The album con
tains only one song that could
be considered a ballad. The
rest of the songs are all
propulsive, sizzling rock and
dance tracks. The rhythm sec
tion with Charlie Watts' drum
ming and Bill Wyman's bass
playing is still the most solid in
rock, and Keith Richards has
rediscovered the guitar
prowess that was apparent on
the band's most recent tour
dates in 1981.
Richards' guitar work, in
fact, is the key to the whole al
bum. He powers the songs
along with some of the harsh
est, stinging and knife
splitting riffs of his career. He
gives the funky rhythms of the
songs a more firm and potent
base from which to develop,
as witnessed in rockers such
as "She Was Hot," "Too
Tough," and"It Must Be Hell"
(which, incidentally, steals the
Townshend-like guitar riff of
"Soul Survivor" from Exile on
Main Street).
In addition, Jagger's vocal
nuances and mannerisms are
better than they have been
recently. His "slurs" some
how add to the songs rather
than detract from them which
was all too apparent on the
weak Love You Live (1977) al
bum.
Besides the better than
usual musicianship found
throughout this album, the
songs themselves and their
lyrical contents are just as hard
and biting as the playing. Not
since the decadence of Exile
on Main Street have the
Stones delved headlong into
tales of sex, blood, pain, S
& M and more sex (and you
thought Some Girls was
risque!)
The song titles even convey
this added sinister and gut
clenching tension. For exam
ple, some of the titles are "Tie
You Up (The Pain of Love)"
(which contains such sexist
lines as Sometimes they crave
for it, cry for it/ Women will die

for it), "Too Much Blood,"
"Pretty Beat Up," and "All The
Way Down."
Their lyrics are even more
startling. "Too Much Blood
is a funky dance track which is
highly reminiscent of the
Clash's "Magnificent Seven,'
only done up with a full set of
horns. Its lyrics though, deal
with the true story of a man
who slaughters his wife and
them cuts her up and puts her
in the refrigerator (it also con
tains some great asides and
ad-libs such as lagger talking
about his seeing the gory film
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
and then saying, "Don't saw off
me leg"), while "She was
Hot," and "All The Way
Down" deal with encounters
with a black prostitute and a
"slut," respectively.
Although the Stones sing
matter of factly about sex, S &
M and gore, they don't neces
sarily condone them. They are
just stating the facts. With the
pleasures and joys of love and
sex, there must also come the
tensions and pains.
Vet, in his on-target vocals,
Jagger is willing to leave him
self vulnerable and unpro
tected rather than never expe
rience the intimate beauties of
love. He shows this with great
compassion in a smooth,
reggae percussioned track
called "Feel On Baby," which
would be a worthy song for
Marvin Caye to cover.
The album even extends
into uncharacteristic Stones
territory. On "Undercover of
the Night" and"It Must Be
Hell," the Stones throw in
some interesting political and
social commentary on un
employment, lack of educa
tion and the plight of Third
World nations. Pretty atypical
stuff when all that you usually
expect are lyrics devoid of any
real meaning as in "Start Me
Up" and "Emotional Rescue."
The album strives to move
the Stones forward and they
prevail triumphantly. They
refuse, on Undercover at least,
to be satisfied with living on
their past laurels. Undercover
is potent, contemporary rock
and roll made all the more
potent because it is the Rolling
Stones, after 20 years, still
playing it. It's good to know
that some people still work
hard to earn their day's
pay â€” even if it is $28 million.

rock, and Keith Richards has
rediscovered the guitar
prowess that was apparent on
the band's most recent tour
dates in 1981.
Richards' guitar work, in
fact, is the key to the whole al
bum. He powers the songs
along with some of the harsh
est, stinging and knife
splitting riffs of his career. He
gives the funky rhythms of the
songs a more firm and potent
base from which to develop,
as witnessed in rockers such
as "She Was Hot," "Too
Tough," and"It Must Be Hell"
(which, incidentally, steals the
Townshend-like guitar riff of
"Soul Survivor" from Exile on
Main Street).
In addition, Jagger's vocal
nuances and mannerisms are
better than they have been
recently. His "slurs" some
how add to the songs rather
than detract from them which
was all too apparent on the
weak Love You Live (1977) al
bum.
Besides the better than
usual musicianship found
throughout this album, the
songs themselves and their
lyrical contents are just as hard
and biting as the playing. Not
since the decadence of Exile
on Main Street have the
Stones delved headlong into
tales of sex, blood, pain, S
& M and more sex (and you
thought Some Girls was
risque!)
The song titles even convey
this added sinister and gut
clenching tension. For exam
ple, some of the titles are "Tie
You Up (The Pain of Love)"
(which contains such sexist
lines as Sometimes they crave
for it, cry for it/ Women will die

for it), "Too Much Blood,"
"Pretty Beat Up," and "All The
Way Down."
Their lyrics are even more
startling. "Too Much Blood
is a funky dance track which is
highly reminiscent of the
Clash's "Magnificent Seven,'
only done up with a full set of
horns. Its lyrics though, deal
with the true story of a man
who slaughters his wife and
them cuts her up and puts her
in the refrigerator (it also con
tains some great asides and
ad-libs such as lagger talking
about his seeing the gory film
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
and then saying, "Don't saw off
me leg"), while "She was
Hot," and "All The Way
Down" deal with encounters
with a black prostitute and a
"slut," respectively.
Although the Stones sing
matter of factly about sex, S &
M and gore, they don't neces
sarily condone them. They are
just stating the facts. With the
pleasures and joys of love and
sex, there must also come the
tensions and pains.
Vet, in his on-target vocals,
Jagger is willing to leave him
self vulnerable and unpro
tected rather than never expe
rience the intimate beauties of
love. He shows this with great
compassion in a smooth,
reggae percussioned track
called "Feel On Baby," which
would be a worthy song for
Marvin Caye to cover.
The album even extends
into uncharacteristic Stones
territory. On "Undercover of
the Night" and"It Must Be
Hell," the Stones throw in
some interesting political and
social commentary on un
employment, lack of educa
tion and the plight of Third
World nations. Pretty atypical
stuff when all that you usually
expect are lyrics devoid of any
real meaning as in "Start Me
Up" and "Emotional Rescue."
The album strives to move
the Stones forward and they
prevail triumphantly. They
refuse, on Undercover at least,
to be satisfied with living on
their past laurels. Undercover
is potent, contemporary rock
and roll made all the more
potent because it is the Rolling
Stones, after 20 years, still
playing it. It's good to know
that some people still work
hard to earn their day's
pay â€” even if it is $28 million.

Recently, the Rolling Stones
signed a new record contract
with Columbia Records
rumored to be worth about
$28 million. Therefore, their
upcoming record release
would be their last on the At
lantic label which has dis
tributed the Stones' own
label, "Rolling Stones
Records," since 1971's Sticky
Fingers album. That's a long
time to stay with one record
! company and the fact that the
. Stones are switching labels
after more than 12 years indi
cates that some major falling
out must have occurred be
tween the Stones and Atlantic.
Therefore, I assumed that
their last Atlantic album would
just be a throwaway album,
one to just satisfy the require
ments of their old record con
tract. I didn't expect much and
when I got to hear a few ad
vance cuts, I was not initially
thrilled with what I heard. The
single, "Undercover of the
Night" utilized a synthesized
drum track beating away over
Charlie Watts' always depend
able drumming and I consid
ered it downright sacrilegious
to overdub drum over Watts'
playing.
However, my initial feelings
towards that song were soon
to be reversed. Slowly, new
aspects of the song were
being uncovered to my ears.

The incessant drum and syn
thesized track were setting up
quite an ominous beat over
which was displayed some of
the meanest guitar licks ever
on a Stones record. Even Jag
ger sounded scared and the
lyrics were filled with deadly
militaristic overtones.
Therefore, by the time the al
bum was to be released, I was
eagerly awaiting it. The album
is entitled Undercover, and
ironically, it proves not to be
the quick throwaway record
that I had foreseen. Instead,
Undercover is a supremely
hard rocking dance album that
is easily the best album that
the Stones have recorded
since 1972's classic Exile On
Main Street.
So what is it about this al
bum that allows me to praise it
so highly especially since my
initial opinion of some of the
songs was of disappointment?
Basically, Undercover is an al
bum that doesn't present all of
its riches at once. The album
keeps a lot under-cover, and
so, one must get underneath
its initial outer appearance
before one can truly appreci
ate it. When the listener al
lows the time to do this, he
will find a classic band still
taking chances and succeed
ing. The Stones may have
wallowed in excess and
boredom at times, but here
they have tapped into a new

power source. The musical
gains made on 1981's Tattoo
You album are now fully
developed and amplified
which results in the Stones
living up to their claim as the
world's greatest rock and roll
band once again.
Undercover displays some
of the finest playing in a long
time by the Stones as a tightly
unified band. The album con
tains only one song that could
be considered a ballad. The
rest of the songs are all
propulsive, sizzling rock and
dance tracks. The rhythm sec
tion with Charlie Watts' drum
ming and Bill Wyman's bass
playing is still the most solid in
rock, and Keith Richards has
rediscovered the guitar
prowess that was apparent on
the band's most recent tour
