# Vice provost to leave post to teach

### RICHARD LYNCH Staff writer 
Vice Provost Herant
Katchadourian, the University's top
academic officer for undergraduate
education, plans to relinquish his
administrative responsibilities and
return to full-time teaching and re
search effective Sept. 1,1984.
Katchadourian spent six of his
eight years in the administration in
the dual role of vice provost and
dean of undergraduate studies. Two
years ago the positions were split,
and Katchadourian retained the
provost spot.
"I am very eager to get back to
teaching and my own work,"
Katchadourian said. "I primarily
think of myself as a teacher."
During his term Katchadourian
was instrumental in instituting the
senior survey, the curriculum study,
the cohort study and restructuring
the distribution requirements.
The changes in the distribution re
quirements which took effect in
1980 were motivated by "a concern
that the whole idea of a set of
courses specially designed to intro
duce students into different areas of
study was not working well. It was
too easy to satisfy the old require
ments," Katchadourian said.
To remedy that problem smaller
lists of courses to satisfy the require

merits and a greater degree of
specificity in those courses were
used to tighten the requirement.
Katchadourian said "the change
was not in the philosophy (of the
distribution requirements) but a
change in procedure to accomplish
those goals." The present situation

is designed to "allow the distribu
tion reqirement to satisfy the dimen
sion of breadth and the major to
contribute to the depth of knowl
edge."
The senior survey gives graduat
ing students the opportunity to eval
uate their experiences with the insti
tution. The curriculum study

focuses on the issues of the shift in
choice of courses and majors by the
student body, the difference be
tween the choices men and women
make, and the grading patterns
within the University.
The cohort study is a random sam
pling of 20 percent of the class of
1981 to elucidate their thoughts on
how to improve the undergraduate
education offered at Stanford.
"My core goal is to understand
how students make the academic
choices they make," he said. "Once
we know how and why students
have a successful experience at
Stanford we can develop a road map
to work through Stanford. There is
no single path for success, but there
may be some basic similarities."
After leaving his post
Katchadourian will immediately take
a sabbatical and work on "old re
search projects and books that I
dropped when I became vice
provost. I will also develop new un
dergraduate courses on adulthood
and the relation between culture
and psychopathology."
When he returns to active teach
ing in the fall of 1985, Katchadourian
plans to devote "substantial
amounts of time teaching under
graduates. I don't want to give that
up â€” even if I'm not administering
their concerns."
