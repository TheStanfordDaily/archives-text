# 'Streamers': a failure, but an honest failure
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
David Rabe wrote the plays
commonly known as his
"Vietnam trilogy" between
1%9 and 1973. Sticks and
Bones (written first but
produced second) is a kind of
updated, satirical version of
Ernest Hemingway's story
"Soldier's Home": a young
man returns, blind, from the
war, to a middle American
family from whom he feels ir
revocably alienated.
The best of the three, The
Basic Training of Pavlo Hum
mel — a great play, I think —
deals with the moral disin
tegration of an enlisted man.
The last written piece,
Streamers, does not actually
take place in Vietnam, but in a
stateside barracks, where

some of the soldiers anticipate
being sent to a jungle war
America has just recently
joined and about which they
have obtained only the most
rudimentary information
(mostly through rumor).

Despite the generous criti
cal reception all three of the
plays have earned, the new
film of Streamers, directed by
Robert Altman, is only the
second attempt to translate
any of them into another
medium. (A television adapta
tion of Sticks and Bones was
refused air space at the last
minute because network
chiefs feared it would offend
too many people.)
This is not surprising: Rabe
uses an affected, drumbeat
diction — he repeats phrases
and his text instructs actors to
blast certain lines to
reproduce, symbolically, the
tone of a military setting.
(Sample: "THERE AIN'T BEEN
NO SOLDIERS IN THIS CAMP
BUT ME. I BEEN THE ONLY

ONE — I BEEN THE ONLY ME!
FOR SO LONG I BEEN THE
ONLY GODDAMN ONE!")
On stage this sort of language
may be called "theatrical" or
even "ritualistic," but in the
movies, where naturalism is

the prevalent style, it runs the
risk of seeming mannered and
stagey.
Streamers actually comes
closer to naturalism than
either of the earlier plays,
both of which contain charac
ters who are imaginative ex
tensions of other characters,
and that may explain whv
Altman chose to direct it, even
though it is the least success
fully achieved of the trilogy.
Last year he filmed a much
worse drama, Ed Graczyk's
Come Back to the 5 & Dime,
Jimmy Dean, /immy Dean, and
transformed it into a near mas
terpiece, with the aid of three
superb actresses.
But for some reason — the
stagebound nature of the ma
terial, perhaps, or the relative

inexperience of the cast — he
doesn't perform the same
miracle with Streamers.
Watching it, we never stop
being conscious that the play
doesn't work and that it isn't
comfortable on camera —

even when the camera is as in
telligently handled as it is
here.
All of Rabe's war plays con
cern themselves with the in
adequacy of role models for
American men, both in and
out of the army. In Streamers
three young men share a
cadre room: Roger (David
Alan Crier), who is black, and
Richie (Mitchell Lichtenstein)
and Billy (Matthew Modine),
who are white. They seem
tentative, semi-formed, not
only as soldiers but as human
beings, and the non
commissioned officers in their
outfit, veterans Cokes
(George Dzundza) and
Rooney (Guy Boyd), are battle
scarred melancholies on a per
petual binge. Their violent,
obscene war stories titillate
the novice soldiers but offer
them no direction — or worse,
the wrong kind of direction.
The title appears in a song
Cokes and Rooney serenade
the boys with, a revamped
rendition of "Beautiful
Dreamers" about a flier whose
parachute (or "streamer")
fails to open when he drops
out of his plane; by implica
tion, all of the characters are
headed for disaster because
joining the forces has set them
on the road to death.
Rabe's plays are compelling
even when they aren't good,
because of their explosive
themes. In Pavlo Hurnmel, the
issues of corrupt role models
and moral descent are carried
through to dramatic comple
tion, but in Streamers they
bubble beneath the surface
and once in a while the
bubbles pop; when the play is
over you're still trying to dope
out the structure. It's quite an
amazing stew of a play,
though — it struggles to say
something about the way ra
cial tensions get started, and
about homophobia, too.

The catalyst, Carlyle
(Michael Wright), is a restless,
brooding, possibly psychotic
black man, a transient who
wanders into the barracks, en
lists Roger's friendship on the
strength of their common
color, and immediately identi
fying Richie's homosexual in
clinations, begins to seduce
him. In this all-male setting,
every man has homoerotic im
pulses, but they take different
shapes: Cokes and Rooney
share a close, tender com
panionship, while Roger and
Billy are both fascinated and
repelled by Richie's more
overt sexual energy.
Rabe is getting at something
here that psychologists and
sociologists have treated but

few playwrights ever write
about: the connection be
tween male camaraderie and
homophobia. And so
Streamers possesses an unus
ual strength, even though it
doesn't resolve anything and
it leaves you unsatisfied rather
than emotionally wrung out.
You may recognize a few of
the performers — Mitchell
Lichtenstein from The Lords of
Discipline. Matthew Modine
from Baby It's You, Michael
Wright from The Wanderers,
George Dzundza from The
Deer Hunter, David Alan Crier
if you were lucky enough to
see him play Jimmy in the New
York production of Dream
girls.
Except for Dzundza and Guy

Boyd, whose imitation ot
drunken antics is really inex
cusable, they all demonstrate
real talent — presence, ener
gy, and an ability to express
complexes of (sometimes con
flicting) emotions. Yet you
grow tired of them by the
second half, because Altman
and Rabe have demanded in
tensity without the balance of
subtlety. By the climax, the ac
tors — especially Michael
Wright, who may be potential
ly the best of the lot — have
been out of control for so long
that the inevitable violence af
fects you the wrong way: it
makes you wince.
In Jimmy Dean, Sandy Den
nis sustained some of the
most difficult (and excruciat
ingly written) monologues I've
ever heard in a movie, but you
could sense an entire career
— more than two decades of
acting on stage and screen —
behind her performance. It
was noble of Robert Altman to
try to reach the same im
aginative level with a couple of
the young men in Streamers,
but they can't pull it off —
Wright sinks into hysteria and
Matthew Modine tends to go
flat when he has too long or
difficult a speech to deliver.
Streamers is very tough to sit
through, but it doesn't make
you despair. And Altman
hasn't done David Rabe a dis
service: The play, preserved
pretty much as written, con
tains so much resonant ma
terial that we can understand
the acclaim he has received.
Movie versions of prize
winning plays rarely give us
any indication of what could
have prompted the prizes —
but then, most recent Ameri
can playwrights aren't as
gifted as David Rabe. And
Altman hasn't done himself a
disservice, either. Streamers is
an honest failure.

ALIENATION: Michael Wright plays Carlyle, the angry out
sider in Robert Altman's ''Streamers."
David Rabe wrote the plays
commonly known as his
"Vietnam trilogy" between
1%9 and 1973. Sticks and
Bones (written first but
produced second) is a kind of
updated, satirical version of
Ernest Hemingway's story
"Soldier's Home": a young
man returns, blind, from the
war, to a middle American
family from whom he feels ir
revocably alienated.
The best of the three, The
Basic Training of Pavlo Hum
mel — a great play, I think —
deals with the moral disin
tegration of an enlisted man.
The last written piece,
Streamers, does not actually
take place in Vietnam, but in a
stateside barracks, where

some of the soldiers anticipate
being sent to a jungle war
America has just recently
joined and about which they
have obtained only the most
rudimentary information
(mostly through rumor).

Despite the generous criti
cal reception all three of the
plays have earned, the new
film of Streamers, directed by
Robert Altman, is only the
second attempt to translate
any of them into another
medium. (A television adapta
tion of Sticks and Bones was
refused air space at the last
minute because network
chiefs feared it would offend
too many people.)
This is not surprising: Rabe
uses an affected, drumbeat
diction — he repeats phrases
and his text instructs actors to
blast certain lines to
reproduce, symbolically, the
tone of a military setting.
(Sample: "THERE AIN'T BEEN
NO SOLDIERS IN THIS CAMP
BUT ME. I BEEN THE ONLY

ONE — I BEEN THE ONLY ME!
FOR SO LONG I BEEN THE
ONLY GODDAMN ONE!")
On stage this sort of language
may be called "theatrical" or
even "ritualistic," but in the
movies, where naturalism is

the prevalent style, it runs the
risk of seeming mannered and
stagey.
Streamers actually comes
closer to naturalism than
either of the earlier plays,
both of which contain charac
ters who are imaginative ex
tensions of other characters,
and that may explain whv
Altman chose to direct it, even
though it is the least success
fully achieved of the trilogy.
Last year he filmed a much
worse drama, Ed Graczyk's
Come Back to the 5 & Dime,
Jimmy Dean, /immy Dean, and
transformed it into a near mas
terpiece, with the aid of three
superb actresses.
But for some reason — the
stagebound nature of the ma
terial, perhaps, or the relative

inexperience of the cast — he
doesn't perform the same
miracle with Streamers.
Watching it, we never stop
being conscious that the play
doesn't work and that it isn't
comfortable on camera —

even when the camera is as in
telligently handled as it is
here.
All of Rabe's war plays con
cern themselves with the in
adequacy of role models for
American men, both in and
out of the army. In Streamers
three young men share a
cadre room: Roger (David
Alan Crier), who is black, and
Richie (Mitchell Lichtenstein)
and Billy (Matthew Modine),
who are white. They seem
tentative, semi-formed, not
only as soldiers but as human
beings, and the non
commissioned officers in their
outfit, veterans Cokes
(George Dzundza) and
Rooney (Guy Boyd), are battle
scarred melancholies on a per
petual binge. Their violent,
obscene war stories titillate
the novice soldiers but offer
them no direction — or worse,
the wrong kind of direction.
The title appears in a song
Cokes and Rooney serenade
the boys with, a revamped
rendition of "Beautiful
Dreamers" about a flier whose
parachute (or "streamer")
fails to open when he drops
out of his plane; by implica
tion, all of the characters are
headed for disaster because
joining the forces has set them
on the road to death.
Rabe's plays are compelling
even when they aren't good,
because of their explosive
themes. In Pavlo Hurnmel, the
issues of corrupt role models
and moral descent are carried
through to dramatic comple
tion, but in Streamers they
bubble beneath the surface
and once in a while the
bubbles pop; when the play is
over you're still trying to dope
out the structure. It's quite an
amazing stew of a play,
though — it struggles to say
something about the way ra
cial tensions get started, and
about homophobia, too.

The catalyst, Carlyle
(Michael Wright), is a restless,
brooding, possibly psychotic
black man, a transient who
wanders into the barracks, en
lists Roger's friendship on the
strength of their common
color, and immediately identi
fying Richie's homosexual in
clinations, begins to seduce
him. In this all-male setting,
every man has homoerotic im
pulses, but they take different
shapes: Cokes and Rooney
share a close, tender com
panionship, while Roger and
Billy are both fascinated and
repelled by Richie's more
overt sexual energy.
Rabe is getting at something
here that psychologists and
sociologists have treated but

few playwrights ever write
about: the connection be
tween male camaraderie and
homophobia. And so
Streamers possesses an unus
ual strength, even though it
doesn't resolve anything and
it leaves you unsatisfied rather
than emotionally wrung out.
You may recognize a few of
the performers — Mitchell
Lichtenstein from The Lords of
Discipline. Matthew Modine
from Baby It's You, Michael
Wright from The Wanderers,
George Dzundza from The
Deer Hunter, David Alan Crier
if you were lucky enough to
see him play Jimmy in the New
York production of Dream
girls.
Except for Dzundza and Guy

Boyd, whose imitation ot
drunken antics is really inex
cusable, they all demonstrate
real talent — presence, ener
gy, and an ability to express
complexes of (sometimes con
flicting) emotions. Yet you
grow tired of them by the
second half, because Altman
and Rabe have demanded in
tensity without the balance of
subtlety. By the climax, the ac
tors — especially Michael
Wright, who may be potential
ly the best of the lot — have
been out of control for so long
that the inevitable violence af
fects you the wrong way: it
makes you wince.
In Jimmy Dean, Sandy Den
nis sustained some of the
most difficult (and excruciat
ingly written) monologues I've
ever heard in a movie, but you
could sense an entire career
— more than two decades of
acting on stage and screen —
behind her performance. It
was noble of Robert Altman to
try to reach the same im
aginative level with a couple of
the young men in Streamers,
but they can't pull it off —
Wright sinks into hysteria and
Matthew Modine tends to go
flat when he has too long or
difficult a speech to deliver.
Streamers is very tough to sit
through, but it doesn't make
you despair. And Altman
hasn't done David Rabe a dis
service: The play, preserved
pretty much as written, con
tains so much resonant ma
terial that we can understand
the acclaim he has received.
Movie versions of prize
winning plays rarely give us
any indication of what could
have prompted the prizes —
but then, most recent Ameri
can playwrights aren't as
gifted as David Rabe. And
Altman hasn't done himself a
disservice, either. Streamers is
an honest failure.
