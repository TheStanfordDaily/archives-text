# 'Hearts and Bones' a triumph for Paul Simon
## 
### SCOTT AREY 
So where is Art Garfunkel
anyway? Well, wherever he is,
he's not on the new Paul
Simon album Hearts and
Bones, and after a not so im
pressive performance of two
Hearts and Bones cuts during
the Simon and Garfunkel
reunion concert it's not
surprising. During that con
cert the duo railed off versions
of the yet-to-be released
songs "Cars are Cars" and
"The Late Great Johnny Ace, "
which left the audience with a
feeling of musical heartburn.
Somehow those songs just
didn't digest well, and no one
could understand why. At the
time I thought that the answer
was simple: The songs stunk.
Surprisingly, I was wrong.
(At least I was surprised, John
Clemm probably won't be.) I
had forgotten one very impor
tant musical axiom: Paul
Simon is a great (I'm talkin'
just really super) songwriter.
That is why musicians from
background respect his
'."r>rk. That is why men like
Phillinganes, Al Di
Meola, Steve Gadd, Marcus
Miller, Mark Rivera, and Jeff
Porcaro appear on the new al
bum and have even toured
with Simon. And, that is why
his songs can absolutely,
positively never be held re
sponsible for any musical fail
ure.
I discovered my error upon
listening to the studio version
of the"The Late Great Johnny
Ace." As a musician, the song
brought me to the brink of
tears. The lilting lines so per
fectly interwined with the

melody against a rich har
monic chordal background,
and marked with literally per
fect (do not take that word
lightly) transitions, was
beyond my comprehension of
the craft of composition. The
subtlety of the piece seemed
equaled only by Mozart's Paris
Symphony in E b , and it ap
pears that Simon must have
had that piece in mind at some
stage of this song. If Simon
eventually turns to "classical
music" he will undoubtedly
present a formidable chal
lenge to the imaginations of
those who favor that form.
The failure of these songs in
their live performance must
be attributed to something
other than the composition.
The natural next target is the
long time friend and co
performer Carfunkel. Simon
said that Garfunkel was taken
off the album tracks because
he felt the album was too
much of a personal statement
about himself. This is true; but
what makes it interesting is
that it is true both lyrically and
musically. The lyrics betray
Simon's self-indulgence in
that they deal exclusively with
his failures with women, three
songs excepted. His new
single "Allergies" is chock full
of allusions to this difficulty
and his lack of understanding
of it. But the music also
betrays a distinct change from
the old Simon formula that
made the Simon and Car
funkel sound. The use of jazz
great Al Di Meola (of "Return
to Forever" fame) on
"Allergies" makes the change
particularly obvious. With ear

blinding speed Di Meola rips
through the tune with a guitar
solo that seems to be an aller
gic reaction to the music in
which it is immersed.
Simon's advancement into a
new musical style, away from
the old S & G formula is the
reason that the new songs on
the tour fell flat. Clearly Simon
did not write the songs with a
Carfunkel part in mind, and
the effect was similar to what
one would expect if one heard
Lawrence Welk singing
"Jumpin' Jack Flash."
The big question then is
changed from "Why didn't
Garfunkel appear on this al
bum?," to "Will he ever ap
pear on a Paul Simon album
again?" It will be very interest
ing to see if Simon will try to
adapt his new style to create a
new S & G sound. I'm sure he
realizes the potential trap
doors and will not do it unless
he can make the sound musi
cally consistent.
Hearts and Bones will
stand alone as a classic, sur
passing even Still Crazy After
All These Years. An impor
tant quality about the album
that is unusual for Simon is
that it must be considered in
its entirety to be completely
appreciated. Although it fre
quently switches mood and
timbre, it undauntingly attacks
the same points giving the lis
tener enhanced perception
with each added song. This is
a quality that*one tends only to
find in works such as Beetho
ven's Ninth Symphony, and
reflects the further maturation
of Simon as an artist.
