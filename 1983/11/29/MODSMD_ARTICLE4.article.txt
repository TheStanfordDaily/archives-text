# New fraternity receives recognition

Omega Psi Phi last week became the third fraternity
in three weeks to be granted full campus privileges by
the University, according to Row Director Diana Con
klin.
A petition for recognition was submitted to Conklin
on March 2. Recognition was granted last week after
the campus group presented on Nov. 11 a letter from
the national organization granting autonomy to the
group, Conklin said.
Duane Harris, president of the fraternity here, said
his group had to negotiate with the national organiza
tion for autonomy because the organization usually
does not grant it.
University policy requires fraternities to be autono
mous from their national organizations.
The group has been granted charter membership in
the national organization.
The all-black group has 12 members, six of whom are
seniors, said Harris. The group, which has named a
chapter counsellor and established its officer and finan
cial structure, must now conduct a successful rush next
spring and form an alumni board to handle long-term
financing.
Harris said he and others in the group decided to join

the fraternity because of its emphasis on community
service and academic achievement. The
predominantly-black fraternity was founded in 1908 to
encourage academic excellence and help the commu
nity by establishing scholarships and tutoring students,
he said.
"I think that all the black greek organizations are
dedicated to serving the black community," Harris
said.
The group does not aim to have a large membership,
he said.
"We would rather go for people dedicated to the
ideals of the fraternity as opposed to just collecting a
group of people," Harris said.
Conklin said she has been giving provisional ap
proval to fraternities and sororities applying for
recognition from the University.
This means that the groups can perform any function
except apply for housing, she said.
The University review currently being conducted on
the role of fraternities and sororities here has had no
effect on decisions to grant recognition, Conklin said.
"We saw no reason to deny them (the petitions for
recognition) just because the review is going on," she
said.
