Space shuttle takes off
Kennedy Space Center, Fla. â€” The shuttle Colum
bia lifted off in a spectacular show of force here yes
terday, carrying six astronauts, a European-built lab
oratory and the hopes of American space officials tor
a new era in space science.
The 11 a.m. liftoff went exactly as scheduled
despite earlier concerns that bad weather might
cause a delay. High clouds limited the view of the
craft from the ground as it rose toward the nor
thernmost orbit of any of the nine shuttle flights,
carrying it 57 degrees above the earth s equator.
To reach that course, the shuttle corkscrewed
over on its back shortly after liftoff and the
astronauts shot out over the Atlantic upside down,

as had been planned.
The astronauts entered the lab for the first time,
after having a little trouble opening the hatch, just
three hours and 42 minutes after takeoff.
Today, the astronauts will begin a series of experi
ments designed to measure not only celestrial
relationships, but the effect of weightlessness on
their bodies and even the impact of their spaceship
as it orbits the earth.
"It's super up here, just beautiful," Columbia
Commander john Young said minutes after liftoff on
his way to orbit 155 miles above the earth. Young,
53, who is making his sixth trip into space, said that
for him, at least, the excitement has not worn off.
"Things don't change any. It's really something,"
said America's most experienced astronaut.
The two booster rockets fell into the Atlantic
within one mile of their projected point of impact
