Space shuttle takes off
Kennedy Space Center, Fla. — The shuttle Colum
bia lifted off in a spectacular show of force here yes
terday, carrying six astronauts, a European-built lab
oratory and the hopes of American space officials tor
a new era in space science.
The 11 a.m. liftoff went exactly as scheduled
despite earlier concerns that bad weather might
cause a delay. High clouds limited the view of the
craft from the ground as it rose toward the nor
thernmost orbit of any of the nine shuttle flights,
carrying it 57 degrees above the earth s equator.
To reach that course, the shuttle corkscrewed
over on its back shortly after liftoff and the
astronauts shot out over the Atlantic upside down,

as had been planned.
The astronauts entered the lab for the first time,
after having a little trouble opening the hatch, just
three hours and 42 minutes after takeoff.
Today, the astronauts will begin a series of experi
ments designed to measure not only celestrial
relationships, but the effect of weightlessness on
their bodies and even the impact of their spaceship
as it orbits the earth.
"It's super up here, just beautiful," Columbia
Commander john Young said minutes after liftoff on
his way to orbit 155 miles above the earth. Young,
53, who is making his sixth trip into space, said that
for him, at least, the excitement has not worn off.
"Things don't change any. It's really something,"
said America's most experienced astronaut.
The two booster rockets fell into the Atlantic
within one mile of their projected point of impact
and the craft's 57-ton external fuel tank landed in the
Indian Ocean after a trip over the Soviet Union.
Always bouyant after a successful launching,
NASA officials lost no time in pronouncing this one
of the best launchings yet.
"It was a perfect launch as far as we were con
cerned," Launch Director Alfred O'Hara said after
the liftoff.
Not quite so perfect, however, were the events
preceeding yesterday's launching. The blastoff was
delayed a month because of fears over a possible
burn-through in the solid fuel boosters that could
have knocked the shuttle out of control.
The nine-day mission, longest and most ambitious
of any of the nine shuttle flights so far, is scheduled
to end with a Dec. 7 landing at Edwards Air Force
Base in California.
Shamir seeks stronger U.S. ties
Washington — Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
raised Israeli proposals with President Reagan yes
terday to strengthen U.S.-Israeli military and eco
nomic ties and to counter what both nations say is a
Soviet-backed threat in Lebanon.
U.S. and Israeli officials said they expected agree
ment on closer military cooperation, such as build
ing a U.S. arms depot in Israel and joint military ex
ercises, as a signal to Syria and its Soviet sponsors
that they won't be given a free hand in Lebanon.
After an initial 20-minute meeting with Reagan and
his key advisers in the Oval Office, Shamir told
reporters that we had "very friendly and good
talks."
A second meeting between the two leaders is
scheduled for today, preceding the arrival in Wash
ington tomorrow of Lebanese President Amin
Cemayel, who also is expected to seek more U.S.
aid.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
Reagan stressed to Shamir, "We will continue to im
prove our cooperation with Israel while at the same
time continuing our relations with moderate Arab
states,"
He said Reagan reiterated to Shamir that the presi
dent's Sept. 1, 1982 speech calling for a Palestinian
entity under Jordanian supervision on the West
Bank "remains the key item in U.S. policy" in the
region.
Speakes characterized the talks as,
"straightforward, friendly."
A senior U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, said
Syria "is going to have to take into account" closer
U.S.-Israeli cooperation in deciding its moves in
Lebanon. The United States reportedly is asking Is
rael to show itself as a viable deterrent to what the
official called the growing "Syrian strength and as
sertiveness."
Officials doubt Sandinista actions
Washington—ln a debate reflecting continued
uncertainty over policy toward Central America,
Reagan administration officials are weighing recent
conciliatory actions by Nicaragua's leftist govern
ment, disagreeing over whether they are signs of
real flexibility or merely tactical ploys.

During the past week, Nicaragua's Sandinista
regime announced that it had ordered 1200 of its es
timated 8000 Cuban advisers to leave; renewed old
offers to send the rest of the Cubans home is U.S.
advisers are withdrawn from neighboring Honduras
and El Salvador; and made overtures to the
country's embattled Roman Catholic bishops, its
business community and the only opposition news
paper. In addition, a leader of El Salvador's anti-
American rebels has said he is moving out of the
Nicaraguan capital of Managua — a longstanding
U.S. demand.
A few State Department optimists believe that
those developments are signs that the Sandinistas
are ready to make real concessions in Central Ameri
can peace negotiations, administration sources said.
Other officials, both in the State Department and
at the White House, are more pessimistic about the
Sandinistas' intentions say the gestures are more il
lusion than reality. "They're not doing anything that
deserves a reward," one highly placed administra
tion aide said. "They're doing what they're doing
because they're being pressured."
For the moment, the official policy is to wait and
see. "The Sandinistas have clearly been communi
cating to the press and others an avowed con
ciliatory posture," State Department spokesman
Alan Romberg said yesterday. "But it's too early to
evaluate whether this represents a substantive
change of position or simply courting public
opinion."
The first test of the Nicaraguans' real intentions,
officials said, will come in negotiations toward a
peace treaty among the five nations of Central
America, scheduled to begin in Panama, Thursday.
The debate within the administration touches on
long-range implications for U.S. policy in the region.
The United States has asked Nicaragua to cease its
support for the leftist Salvadoran rebels, to halt its
military buildup, to send home its Cuban and Soviet
bloc advisers and to open negotiations with the
domestic opposition, including rebel guerrilla
groups that have received funds from the Central In
telligence Agency.
Terrorists bomb Beirut harbor
Beirut, Lebanon — U.S. jets thundered over Beirut
yesterday after two overnight attacks on American
Marines, and gunners shelled the capital's harbor
for the first time since the summer of 1982.
In Tripoli, besieged PLO chief Yasser Arafat
accused Syria of massing troops near the port city.
The American jets flew reconnaissance sorties
over Beirut and nearby hills after the attacks on
Marine positions. The shooting caused no casualties
to the Marines and only minor damage to the Beirut
airport where the Marines are stationed.
But the 15-minute bombardment of the port
wounded four construction workers shortly after
noon. Police were unable to determine who was re
sponsible for the first shelling of the harbor area
since Israel's 1982 summer invasion of Lebanon.
One salvo of five shells and rockets slammed into
the harbor area about a mile east of the U.S. Embas
sy on West Beirut's seafront.
"Nothing fell close enough to alarm us," said Em
bassy spokesman John Stewart.
The artillery and rocket-propelled grenade attacks
on the U.S. Marine contingent at Beirut's interna
tional airport came before midnight and at
daybreak, said a Marine spokesman, Maj. Dennis
Brooks.

A grenade and some small fire hit the southern
perimeter of the base, said Brooks. He said Marines
returned the fire with small arms and machine guns.
At daybreak, two artillery rounds hit the airport
runway. Brooks said the origin of of those shells was
not determined.
In southern Lebanon, 12 Israeli tanks crossed the
Awali River, which has been the self-imposed front
line for Israel. The tanks apparently were a warning
to warring Druse and Christian militiamen in
Lebanon's Chouf Mountains to stop fighting,
Lebanese reporters in the area said.
Strikers refuse Greyhound offer
Phoenix, Ariz. — Striking Greyhound bus drivers
and other workers resoundingly rejected a company
proposal to reduce wages by 7.8 percent, with 96
percent voting against the contract offer, union offi
cials said yesterday.
But Harry Rosenblum, acting president of the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions,
said he didn't think "we'd be that far from a settle
ment" if the company and union resolved certain
other issues in the three-year contract, such as a
proposed reduction in pension benefits.
Rosenblum, who told the company's chief
negotiator the results of the vote, expressed op
timism that talks would resume soon.
But when asked the company's reaction, he said,
"They play good poker."
Greyhound Lines planned no comment until
today, when John Teets, chairman of the parent
Greyhound Corp., holds a news conference in
Phoenix to "announce important plans regarding
Greyhound Lines."
Dorothy Lorant, Greyhound's vice president for
public relations, said Teets would discuss the
union's election results and other matters. She
declined to elaborate.
The Amalgamated Transit Union, which
represents 12,700 Greyhound workers, struck Nov. 2
over a proposed contract calling for a 9.8 percent
salary cut. Greyhound said it needed the pay cuts to
remain competitive with deregulated airlines and
other bus lines.
Rosenblum said the company's argument that
many of the drivers would be willing to come back
had been rebuffed by the voting.
"They turned down the first contract offer by a
margin of 98.3 percent and the 96 percent on this
vote doesn't show that much erosion," said
Rosenblum.
The official tally was 9522 to 325 against the com
pany offer. The vote count came out to 96 percent
opposed, 3 percent in favor and about 3000
employees not voting.
Reagan may donate to World Bank
Washington — The Reagan administration is con
sidering an appeal by World Bank President H.W.
"Tom" Clausen to raise its planned commitment for
subsidized aid to developing countries from $750
million a year to $1 billion.
In effect, bank officials say, a boost of that magni
tude for the International Development Agency
(IDA), the bank's soft-loan arm, would trigger larger
donations by other countries leading to a $12.6 bil
lion program over three years, starting next year, in

stead of $9 billion as now envisaged by U.S. treasury
officials.
A final determination of the size of the IDA pro
gram— known as IDA-7 — will be made in Paris
next week at a meeting of deputy finance ministers,
and the outcome of that meeting will largely be de
pendent on top-level Reagan administration deci
sions to be made this week.
Advances by IDA to the world's poorest nations
are 40-year, no-interest grants carrying a small ser
vice charge. They are the largest single source of of
ficial development aid to these countries.
A preliminary session last week of a White House
interdepartmental policy committee headed by
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan left the matter
open, despite considerable pressure from both
Republicans and Democrats in Congress to be
generous with IDA. Moreover, a number of heads of
government have sent messages or talked personal
ly with President Reagan about the need for a
beefed-up IDA.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who was not at
last week's meeting, reportedly favors boosting the
annual U.S. contribution to around $900 million.
Regan yesterday refused to comment, pending final
resolution of the U.S. position. But in an interview,
World Bank senior vice president Moeen Qureshi
said, "I think there is real hope and real expectation
on our part that the ($750 million) figure would be
substantially increased."
Qureshi feels that the upcoming IDA negotiations
in Paris provide the United States a chance to
reassert its world leadership in this area, and at the
same time take a step in its own self-interest as well
as filling a critical Third World need.
A Treasury study initiated at the start of the Reagan
administration concluded that the bank and its sub
sidiary agencies ably serve U.S. foreign policy and
security interests. Much of the IDA money and
similar economic aid is actually expended in the
United States.
Because China is now an IDA client, a $12.6 billion
IDA-7 would be significantly smaller in per capita
terms than the $12 billion IDA-6. It also would re
quire a continuing diminution of the large chunk of
the funds traditionally allocated to India, so as to
provide more money where it is most
needed — sub-Saharan Africa — as well as a
reasonable allotment for China.
Stocks fall in mixed trading
New York — The stock market's three-week old
rally stalled yesterday as prices closed mostly lower.
The slide stabilized in late trading, however, and
most key averages closed above their lows of the
sessions.
Telephone, auto, retail, and oil stocks paced the
losers, while mining issues posted big gains after the
price of gold shot up $18 an ounce in U.S. and
European trading.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 59.25
points over the past three weeks dropped 7.62 to
1269.82.
Today's weather
Sunny today with patchy morning fog. Highs in
the upper 50s and low 60s with light winds. Increas
ing high cloud cover tonight.
