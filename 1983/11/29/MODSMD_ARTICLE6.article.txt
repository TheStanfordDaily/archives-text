# U.S. press isn't doing its job, says journalist Seymour Hersh

Seymour Hersh last night assailed
both U.S. foreign policy and the
American press in a sometimes ram
bling address to a sparse crowd in
Kresge Auditorium.
Criticizing the course of American
policy in the last 20 years and saying
that things are not likely to change
for the better, Hersh placed part of
the blame on policy-makers who
lack "honesty and integrity" — but
put the onus on the public and press
as well.
The public doesn't "ask many
questions about the kind of person
ality and values" officials bring to of
fice, Hersh said, adding, "Don't ex
pect the press to do anything about
it."
"If there is a social revolution in
America, don't expect the press to
lead it — they probably won't know
about it for months," he said.
Hersh, whose most recent book,
"The Price of Power," is about
Henry Kissinger, former national se
curity adviser and secretary of state,
in the Nixon White House. The
book portrays Kissinger as a power
hungry diplomat who has little con
cern for the truth or the law, and
Hersh spent most of the lecture dis
cussing the Nixon administration.
Hersh argued that Watergate,
commonly viewed as the press' vic
tory over the president, wasn't a vic
tory at all. Not only did the press
never report the full story about
Watergate, he said, but it missed
story after story about Nixon's
foreign policy.
Recapitulating what has been re
ported in newspaper accounts and
memoirs in the past 10 years and
drawing heavily from his own book,
Hersh painted a picture of an admin

istration that deceived the public —
about Vietnam, the India-Pakistan
war, CIA involvement in Chile and
other events — time and time again
but was never found out until after
the 1972 election.
"If the press had been able to
penetrate 'the real Watergate' — the
Nixon-Kissinger foreign policy
Watergate — they might have
stopped Nixon from doing the
rest," he said.
"The press, far from being the
heroes of Watergate, by their in
ability to report. . . made Watergate
possible," he said.
"If a president chooses to lie to
the American people, he can get
away with it," Hersh said, adding

that there's little anyone can do
about it.
Hersh, who won his Pulitizer in
1970 for his reporting about the My
Lai massacre in Vietnam, spent
much of an afternoon session in
Branner Hall lounge telling how he
uncovered the story and discussing
the ethical dilemmas such inves
tigative reporting raises.
"We operate in an interesting way
— journalists," said Hersh, pointing
out that the press must sometimes
lie to get stories but defending such
tactics as in the public interest.
"You've got to accept that this is
the way we operate," he said.
