# Students propose space station

President Reagan is expected
to approve funding for a manned
space station designed by NASA
in several weeks, White House
officials say, but experts here are
criticizing the proposed design,
calling it a "white elephant in
space."
These experts plan to approach
Washington with an alternative to
the NASA plan.
NASA's manned station would
be launched by 1991 and house
six to eight astronauts for a per
iod of up to six months, provid
ing a new base for scientific re
search as well as a home for
space-age industries.
At Stanford, however, NASA's
plan has several strong critics.
Some of them, including
graduate student Lou Lerman,
have written a 400-page book
detailing an alternative to the
manned space station — and they
plan to send the copies of the
text and Lerman to Washington

to rally for the alternate plan.
The book was the result of a
class project for Engineering 235.
The students designed an un
manned space station, called the
Pleides System. Lerman and
several others in the class found
that their plan differed signifi

cantly from the NASA plan, and
decided to make Washington
aware of the Pleides design.
Lerman said he felt there will
be some interest in Pleides —
NASA's manned station has
received mixed reviews in Wash-

ington as well here. He explained that the
Pentagon, the Office of Management and
Budget and several scientists have ob
jected to NASA's plan for economic and
scientific reasons, saying the station is too
expensive and does not have a clear pur
pose.
Some experts, however, are supporting
NASA's strong campaign for the manned
station. Richard Johnson, a researcher at
the Moffett Field regional NASA office,
said that NASA seems to have convinced
decision-makers of the station's commer
cial and scientific benefits.
NASA officials have not presented a
graphic portrayal of the station, according
to Johnson, because the purpose of the
station is more important presently than
the design. Basically, the structure would
consist of several large, connected
cylinders and would cost about $8 billion,
The commercial aspect of the space sta
tion is still not fully developed, Johnson
said. "There are four proposed commer
cial purposes for the station," he said,
but added that not all purposes fit in to
NASA's design. For example, a plan to
use the station as a giant communications
satellite is impractical because of the po
sition of.the station's orbit, Johnson said.
"The station- will have a
geosynchronous orbit," Johnson said, ex

plaining that since the station will move
faster around the earth than the earth will
rotate, it will never be in exactly the same
position twice. A communications
satellite needs to be in a fairly stationary
position to function properly.
The two commercial proposals that are
most practical are the use of the space
station to develop materials in a vacuum
and the generation of "industrial
services" connected with the station.
Johnson said the atmospheric conditions
of the space station would make it an
ideal place for certain types of product re
search — such as the vaccine develop
ment currently being done on the space
shuttle.
The "industrial services" Johnson des
cribed would be those predictably result
ing from the development of a project of
this scale, everything from "Kelly
astronauts" who would be available on a
temporary basis, to space contractors
who would bid on specific construction
projects. Johnson said he felt new com
mercial uses would develop as the station
evolved, which would further justify its
construction.
According to Lerman, the uncertain
purpose of the space station is one of the
main reasons why the NASA design is im
practical. The main difference between
the students' design and NASA's station is
the "evolutionary" capability of Pleides
— by building the station in stages rather

than launching a monolith, it would be
flexible enough to accommodate the new
uses for it which would undoubtedly arise
between the station's conception and
erection.
"They're planning to complete the en
gineering in 1986 for a 1991 launch. That's
technically impossible," Lerman said. The
manned station, he explained, was "too
much, too soon," — the result would be
a "white elephant in space" with a design
that was incompatible with its use.
Pleides consists of a central, unmanned
central platform that would be launched
some time after 1990. A flotilla of "free
flyers," individual constructs that could
be launched in stages and which would
facilitate different research projects,
would surround the platform. After this
system had been successful for several
years, a manned platform would be
added to the flotilla.
Lerman said he felt that the manned
platform was not only unnecessary as an
initial stage, but that it could be detrimen
tal to the research functions of the sta
tion.
"Many of the instruments NASA is
planning to put up there aren't compati
ble with a manned station," he said. Con
tamination from human waste and vibra
tions from body movements are among
the many things that could limit the effec
tiveness of experimentation in a mahned
station, he said.
