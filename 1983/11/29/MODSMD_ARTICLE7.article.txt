President Reagan is expected
to approve funding for a manned
space station designed by NASA
in several weeks, White House
officials say, but experts here are
criticizing the proposed design,
calling it a "white elephant in
space."
These experts plan to approach
Washington with an alternative to
the NASA plan.
NASA's manned station would
be launched by 1991 and house
six to eight astronauts for a per
iod of up to six months, provid
ing a new base for scientific re
search as well as a home for
space-age industries.
At Stanford, however, NASA's
plan has several strong critics.
Some of them, including
graduate student Lou Lerman,
have written a 400-page book
detailing an alternative to the
manned space station — and they
plan to send the copies of the
text and Lerman to Washington

to rally for the alternate plan.
The book was the result of a
class project for Engineering 235.
The students designed an un
manned space station, called the
Pleides System. Lerman and
several others in the class found
that their plan differed signifi

cantly from the NASA plan, and
decided to make Washington
aware of the Pleides design.
Lerman said he felt there will
be some interest in Pleides —
NASA's manned station has
received mixed reviews in Wash-
