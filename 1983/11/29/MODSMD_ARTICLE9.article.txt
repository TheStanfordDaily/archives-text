# NMR helping doctors to see the whole picture

Stanford physicians will soon be using a
new imaging technique that provides more
diagnostic information than ever before
while being harmless and non-invasive, ac
cording to a Medical Center radiologist.
A temporary facility that will house one
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging
system should be operational by Spring
1984, said Dr. Stuart Young, assistant profes
sor of radiology at the Medical Center.
According to Young, plans are also under
way for a permanent center to serve as a
base for the Medical Center's clinical and re
search programs involving NMR, the im
aging method that allows physicians to see
the soft tissue of the body more clearly and
completely than any others, such as X-ray
and CT-computerized tomography-scans.
NMR imaging has already been shown to
be superior in diagnosing diseases such as
multiple sclerosis, a degenerative central
nervous system disease, Young said. It also
allows physicians to see bone marrow for
the first time ever.
"This is one of the greatest medical
developments of all time," said Young.
NMR is based on the fact that nuclei, the
core of atoms, carry electrical charges that
respond to magnetism. Like tiny bar mag
nets, these nuclei vibrate when trapped
inside a magnetic field.
The technique is based on the Nobel
prize-winning discovery of physicist Felix
Bloch at Stanford and Edward Purcell at Har
vard in 1945 of a way to detect "resonance"
in nuclei. The potential applications of this
finding went unrealized for years by
chemists and biologists. It wasn't until 1974
that Paul Lauterbur, professor of chemistry
at the State University of New York, pub
lished the first image based on NMR, which
he called zeugmatography.
To understand how NMR works, Young
explained, consider one of the body's most
common substances: hydrogen. Like sol
diers at ease, positively-charged hydrogen
protons, particles in nuclei, spin around at
random. By exposing them to a magnetic
field, in NMR's case a giant doughnut
shaped magnet up to 40,000 times the
strength of the earth's magnetic field, the
p r otons snap to attention and align them
selves with the magnet's charge. The alert
protons can be tipped by zapping them with
a specific radio frequency, providing energy
absorbed by the protons. They hold onto
the energy for varying amounts of time,
depending on the type of tissue they make
up. When they release the energy, righting
themselves in the process, signals are
emitted and picked up by the computers.
It's possible to tell which part of the body
the signals are coming from, Young contin
ued, because of the varying amounts of time
the energy is held by protons in the tissue.
This lapse is known as the relaxation time.
Fatty tissue, for example, has a short relaxa

tion time, while cancerous tissue, physicians
have found, has a long one. For imaging
purposes, the computer assigns each a dif
ferent hue, thus creating a picture of the
inside of the body.
In addition to its other advantages, NMR
imaging can present an image of any angle
of the body, unlike CT scans that can only
show a cross sectional slice, Young said. The
brain, for example, is much more visible
than ever before because NMR penetrates
through the bone at the base of the skull
and the junction of the spine. Thus, NMR
reveals brain tumors, tissue-killing
blockages, and any infectious process.
Atherosclerosis is more easily diagnosed
because NMR can detect fatty tissue build
ing up to occlude the heart's blood vessels.
The technique can detect cancerous lymph
nodes in the lung area, not possible with
more conventional techniques that fail to
distinguish large blood vessels from en
larged lymph nodes. Physicians can also de
termine different types of cancer in the
same area, Young explained, thus allowing
more tailored and subsequently more
effective treatment.
It's even easier to diagnose bone
fractures, Young said, because the images
show where blood has seeped into the bone
area.

In addition to its other
advantages, NMR imaging
can present an image of any
angle of the brain, unlike CT
scans that can only show a
cross section.

The temporary facility, to be located near
the Medical Center, will allow physicians to
begin using NMR imaging, Young said, until
the $5.5 million NMR center, which is sched
uled to house four magnets, is completed.
And the Stanford University Hospital
Modernization Project includes plans for a
NMR unit that will house one magnet.
Because of the strength of the magnets,
Young continued, a number of safety
precautions have to be considered in con
structing the NMR buildings. The magnets
themselves must be inside rooms with spe
cially built, shielded walls. The buildings
must provide a parameter of about 70 feet
around the magnets. This has been estab
lished as the zone outside of which people
will not be affected by the magnetic field.
To guard against any mishaps, the
entrances to the buildings will be monitored
by sensitive metal detectors, Young said.
Anyone with any type of metal device, such
as a pacemaker or even a screw holding a
joint together, cannot come inside \V>e 70-
foot parameter.

vard in 1945 of a way to detect "resonance"
in nuclei. The potential applications of this
finding went unrealized for years by
chemists and biologists. It wasn't until 1974
that Paul Lauterbur, professor of chemistry
at the State University of New York, pub
lished the first image based on NMR, which
he called zeugmatography.
To understand how NMR works, Young
explained, consider one of the body's most
common substances: hydrogen. Like sol
diers at ease, positively-charged hydrogen
protons, particles in nuclei, spin around at
random. By exposing them to a magnetic
field, in NMR's case a giant doughnut
shaped magnet up to 40,000 times the
strength of the earth's magnetic field, the
p r otons snap to attention and align them
selves with the magnet's charge. The alert
protons can be tipped by zapping them with
a specific radio frequency, providing energy
absorbed by the protons. They hold onto
the energy for varying amounts of time,
depending on the type of tissue they make
up. When they release the energy, righting
themselves in the process, signals are
emitted and picked up by the computers.
It's possible to tell which part of the body
the signals are coming from, Young contin
ued, because of the varying amounts of time
the energy is held by protons in the tissue.
This lapse is known as the relaxation time.
Fatty tissue, for example, has a short relaxa

tion time, while cancerous tissue, physicians
have found, has a long one. For imaging
purposes, the computer assigns each a dif
ferent hue, thus creating a picture of the
inside of the body.
In addition to its other advantages, NMR
imaging can present an image of any angle
of the body, unlike CT scans that can only
show a cross sectional slice, Young said. The
brain, for example, is much more visible
than ever before because NMR penetrates
through the bone at the base of the skull
and the junction of the spine. Thus, NMR
reveals brain tumors, tissue-killing
blockages, and any infectious process.
Atherosclerosis is more easily diagnosed
because NMR can detect fatty tissue build
ing up to occlude the heart's blood vessels.
The technique can detect cancerous lymph
nodes in the lung area, not possible with
more conventional techniques that fail to
distinguish large blood vessels from en
larged lymph nodes. Physicians can also de
termine different types of cancer in the
same area, Young explained, thus allowing
more tailored and subsequently more
effective treatment.
It's even easier to diagnose bone
fractures, Young said, because the images
show where blood has seeped into the bone
area.

In addition to its other
advantages, NMR imaging
can present an image of any
angle of the brain, unlike CT
scans that can only show a
cross section.

The temporary facility, to be located near
the Medical Center, will allow physicians to
begin using NMR imaging, Young said, until
the $5.5 million NMR center, which is sched
uled to house four magnets, is completed.
And the Stanford University Hospital
Modernization Project includes plans for a
NMR unit that will house one magnet.
Because of the strength of the magnets,
Young continued, a number of safety
precautions have to be considered in con
structing the NMR buildings. The magnets
themselves must be inside rooms with spe
cially built, shielded walls. The buildings
must provide a parameter of about 70 feet
around the magnets. This has been estab
lished as the zone outside of which people
will not be affected by the magnetic field.
To guard against any mishaps, the
entrances to the buildings will be monitored
by sensitive metal detectors, Young said.
Anyone with any type of metal device, such
as a pacemaker or even a screw holding a
joint together, cannot come inside \V>e 70-
foot parameter.
Stanford physicians will soon be using a
new imaging technique that provides more
diagnostic information than ever before
while being harmless and non-invasive, ac
cording to a Medical Center radiologist.
A temporary facility that will house one
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging
system should be operational by Spring
1984, said Dr. Stuart Young, assistant profes
sor of radiology at the Medical Center.
According to Young, plans are also under
way for a permanent center to serve as a
base for the Medical Center's clinical and re
search programs involving NMR, the im
aging method that allows physicians to see
the soft tissue of the body more clearly and
completely than any others, such as X-ray
and CT-computerized tomography-scans.
NMR imaging has already been shown to
be superior in diagnosing diseases such as
multiple sclerosis, a degenerative central
nervous system disease, Young said. It also
allows physicians to see bone marrow for
the first time ever.
"This is one of the greatest medical
developments of all time," said Young.
NMR is based on the fact that nuclei, the
core of atoms, carry electrical charges that
respond to magnetism. Like tiny bar mag
nets, these nuclei vibrate when trapped
inside a magnetic field.
