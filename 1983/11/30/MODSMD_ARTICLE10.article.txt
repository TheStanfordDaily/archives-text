## The 						Stanford Daily Not Nicaragua next

When it comes to conciliation,
Nicaragua — one of the nations that is ir
revocably in the Soviet camp if you believe the
Reagan administration — has been putting the
United States to shame recently.
In rapid-fire fashion, the Nlicaraguan govern
ment last week ordered 2200 Cuban advisers to
leave the country, reiterated offers to dismiss
the rest of the estimated >800 Cubans there if
U.S. advisers are withdrawn from Honduras
and El Salvador, apparentlv pressured a leader
of the anti-American rebels in El Salvador to
leave Managua and announced it would pro
vide the opposition newspaper La Prensa with
monev so it could continue publication.
Nicaraguan leaders have also announced
that the government will establish a schedule
for free elections in 1985. guarantee business
men in the country respect for their property,
discuss with the Roman Catholic hierarchy the
removal of radical priests from the government
and ease press restrictions on La Prensa.
All of the moves are major concessions to
the Reagan administration. vvhich has constant
lv criticized the Central American country's
domestic and foreign policies. And the moves
are certainlv conciliatory, especially in contrast
to the signals — both overt and covert — that
the United States has been sending the Sandi
nistas.

Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,
asked last week if an invasion of Nicaragua was
imminent, left the matter open by dismissing
the question as "hypothetical." Continued
U.S. support for Nicaraguan counter
revolutionaries and the presence of 5500 U.S.
troops in Honduras are not friendly signals,
nor is the apparent glee with which the admin
istration is accepting public approval of the
recent invasion of Grenada.
The Reagan administration seems unwilling
to acknowledge that the Sandinistas are trying
to compromise. The White House has decided
to denv a visa to Tomas Borge, Nicaragua's In
terior Minister. Borge had planned to start a
tour today of the United States to talk to civic
and religious leaders. The Los Angeles Times
vesterda\ quoted a Reagan administration aide
as saving that Nicaraguan government is "not
doing anMhing that deserves a reward."
We are left pondering the contrasts. While
the Sandinista leaders make major conces
sions. the Reagan administration rattles sabers.
While Nicaragua tries to negotiate, the United
States denies a visa to a top Sandinista official.
Nicaragua is sending a very clear message to
the United States: It wants negotiation and is
vsilling to change its domestic and foreign
policies to avoid a military conflict with the
United States. We wonder if President Reagan
is read\ to reciprocate.
