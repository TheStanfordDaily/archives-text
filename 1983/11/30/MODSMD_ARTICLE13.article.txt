Media shares blame
As pointed out in The New York
Times of Nov. 6, "It has become
clear that the Reagan administration
officials and military authorities
disseminated much inaccurate
information and many unproven
assertions. They did so while with
holding significant facts and imped
ing efforts by journalists to verify
official statements." Among the
distortions documented were the
understatement of pre-invasion
planning prior to the "formal re
quest bv some Organization of
East Caribbean States (OECS) mem
bers, the great exaggeration of
Cuban involvement and the nature
of the resistence encountered by
U.S. troops.
Yet, an important question to

consider is: Should the press be
absolved of ail guilt in this possibly
tragic violation of our principle of
freedom of the press? In the case of
Grenada, the limited access to
verifiable information left the State
Department and military in a very
powerful position. They were
practically the only source of timely
information that could be held
accountable for any false informa
tion.
It may then be tempting to lay the
blame on the media's obsession
with up-to-the-minute information.
The propensity to stress the latest
"facts" or statements, rather than
in-depth analysis, deprives the
public of the ability to develop a
broad perspective.
On the other hand, this tendency
is in part a response to forces
outside any single media organiza

tion. The public taste for fast infor
mation and sensationalism creates a
strong incentive to print front-page
stories which stress the most con
troversial aspects of the latest offi
cial releases, leaving little room for
critical analysis.
This raises the most important set
of questions: Is it the particular
American preference of quick
stylized facts over analysis that is
responsible for what the media
produces, or vice versa? If not the
media's, whose responsibility is it
to foster an environment for critical
evaluation of important events,
their causes and implications? If the
media shouldn't be relied upon to
change the constraints it faces, who
can be relied upon?
