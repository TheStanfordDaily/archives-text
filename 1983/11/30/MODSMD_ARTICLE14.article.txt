# Human rights in the U.S.S.R

Since the invasion of Grenada, there has been much
comparison of U.S. and Soviet behavior. Critics have
compared the American action with the Soviet inva
sion of Afghanistan. They sav that the invasion shows
that the United States and the U.S.S.R. are morally
equal. While there are huge differences between Af
ghanistan and Grenada, these comparisons only con
sider half of the situation. Thev neglect the equally im
portant question of how the United States and the
U.S.S.R. treat their own people.
In considering Soviet and American attitudes
toward citizens, one fact stands out. Hundreds of
thousands of people would do almost anything to
come to America, while hundreds of thousands of So
viet citizens would do almost anything to leave. The
reasons for this are both political and economic.
However. Soviet citizens who leave have to give up
most of what thev own; and few homeless Laotians or
poor Mexicans want to go to the Soviet Union, so the
political differences must be a significant factor.
According to most estimates, there are several mil
lion people w ho have come to the United States illegal
ly, while anvone who wants to leave can. On the other
hand, the Soviet Union rigidly controls its borders. Few
people want to move to the Soviet Union. And only one
group has been allowed to leave the Soviet Union in
significant numbers. In the past 10 vears, about 250.000
Soviet Jews have left, for Israel and the United States.
Before being given permission to emigrate, thev went
through months of harrassment. fear of arrest, uncer
tainty and occasionally phvstcal violence.
However, this does not mean that onlv 250,000 Jews
wanted to leave. There are still roughlv another 250.000
Jews who have applied to leave but have been denied
permission. This is out of a total of three million Jews.
Mam more want to leave but are afraid to apply for
permission.
Many refuseniks have spent mam vears repeated lv
apphnng to leave. Thev are almost invariably fired and
forced to scrounge for jobs. Manv are arrested and im
prisoned for parasitism" — the crime of being un
employed.
While Soviet Jews are treated more harshly than
other minorities, in one respect their position is
enviable. Thev are the onlv group that has been
allowed to leave in significant numbers. Non-Jews have
had to go to incredible lengths to escape. While it is
impossible to know how manv non-Jews want to leave

Russia, the four million Germans who fled East Ger
many between 1945 and August 1961 (when the Berlin
wall was built) and who constituted more than 20 per
cent of that country's population provide a clue.
It is tragic that the only Soviet dissidents to receive
support from Westerners are Jews and scientists. Chris
tian dissidents have often been ignored by their Ameri
can brethren. In 1982. when Billy Graham preached in
Russia, two Christian protestors were arrested right in
the church where he was speaking, while he stood
watching. It is no wonder that the U.S.S.R. feels it can
hide its Christian dissidents. Non-religious dissenters
face a similar struggle. Those who are arrested for at
tempting to monitor Soviet human rights violations
have received minimal support from fellow protestors
in the West.
Another measure of political freedom is the number
of candidates running in elections. In Soviet elec
tions, there is only one candidate for each office, in
contrast to the situation here. Another measure is to
look at freedom of expression: How diverse opinions
can be publicly expressed. American publications con
tain a wide variety of opinions. Even unpopular ex
tremist views are legally circulated. Although the
United States is far from perfect in this
respect — having harrassed Martin Luther King and
others — it is still miles ahead of the Soviets. In the
U.S.S.R., there is only one opinion allowed: the gov
ernment's. There is only one major source of news: the
government-operated Tass and The Pravda. There have
been attempts to circulate unofficial newspapers, but
they have usually ended in arrest. There are other
standards that could be used in comparing countries,
but the above have the advantage that they are relative
ly blind to politics.
Unfortunately, although the U.S. treatment of its
citizens is far better than the U.S.S.R. s, manv of our
allies do not follow our lead. While European treatment
of dissent splits along East-West lines, most other
American allies are sadlv lacking in this respect. South
Africa, the Philippines and much of South and Central
America are closer to the Soviet model than to the
American model. In our campaign to export the
American way perhaps we should put a little more
emphasis on human rights and less on building bombs.

of candidates running in elections. In Soviet elec
tions, there is only one candidate for each office, in
contrast to the situation here. Another measure is to
look at freedom of expression: How diverse opinions
can be publicly expressed. American publications con
tain a wide variety of opinions. Even unpopular ex
tremist views are legally circulated. Although the
United States is far from perfect in this
respect — having harrassed Martin Luther King and
others — it is still miles ahead of the Soviets. In the
U.S.S.R., there is only one opinion allowed: the gov
ernment's. There is only one major source of news: the
government-operated Tass and The Pravda. There have
been attempts to circulate unofficial newspapers, but
they have usually ended in arrest. There are other
standards that could be used in comparing countries,
but the above have the advantage that they are relative
ly blind to politics.
Unfortunately, although the U.S. treatment of its
citizens is far better than the U.S.S.R. s, manv of our
allies do not follow our lead. While European treatment
of dissent splits along East-West lines, most other
American allies are sadlv lacking in this respect. South
Africa, the Philippines and much of South and Central
America are closer to the Soviet model than to the
American model. In our campaign to export the
American way perhaps we should put a little more
emphasis on human rights and less on building bombs.

Through the Murky Waters
Since the invasion of Grenada, there has been much
comparison of U.S. and Soviet behavior. Critics have
compared the American action with the Soviet inva
sion of Afghanistan. They sav that the invasion shows
that the United States and the U.S.S.R. are morally
equal. While there are huge differences between Af
ghanistan and Grenada, these comparisons only con
sider half of the situation. Thev neglect the equally im
portant question of how the United States and the
U.S.S.R. treat their own people.
In considering Soviet and American attitudes
toward citizens, one fact stands out. Hundreds of
thousands of people would do almost anything to
come to America, while hundreds of thousands of So
viet citizens would do almost anything to leave. The
reasons for this are both political and economic.
However. Soviet citizens who leave have to give up
most of what thev own; and few homeless Laotians or
poor Mexicans want to go to the Soviet Union, so the
political differences must be a significant factor.
According to most estimates, there are several mil
lion people w ho have come to the United States illegal
ly, while anvone who wants to leave can. On the other
hand, the Soviet Union rigidly controls its borders. Few
people want to move to the Soviet Union. And only one
group has been allowed to leave the Soviet Union in
significant numbers. In the past 10 vears, about 250.000
Soviet Jews have left, for Israel and the United States.
Before being given permission to emigrate, thev went
through months of harrassment. fear of arrest, uncer
tainty and occasionally phvstcal violence.
However, this does not mean that onlv 250,000 Jews
wanted to leave. There are still roughlv another 250.000
Jews who have applied to leave but have been denied
permission. This is out of a total of three million Jews.
Mam more want to leave but are afraid to apply for
permission.
Many refuseniks have spent mam vears repeated lv
apphnng to leave. Thev are almost invariably fired and
forced to scrounge for jobs. Manv are arrested and im
prisoned for parasitism" — the crime of being un
employed.
While Soviet Jews are treated more harshly than
other minorities, in one respect their position is
enviable. Thev are the onlv group that has been
allowed to leave in significant numbers. Non-Jews have
had to go to incredible lengths to escape. While it is
impossible to know how manv non-Jews want to leave

Russia, the four million Germans who fled East Ger
many between 1945 and August 1961 (when the Berlin
wall was built) and who constituted more than 20 per
cent of that country's population provide a clue.
It is tragic that the only Soviet dissidents to receive
support from Westerners are Jews and scientists. Chris
tian dissidents have often been ignored by their Ameri
can brethren. In 1982. when Billy Graham preached in
Russia, two Christian protestors were arrested right in
the church where he was speaking, while he stood
watching. It is no wonder that the U.S.S.R. feels it can
hide its Christian dissidents. Non-religious dissenters
face a similar struggle. Those who are arrested for at
tempting to monitor Soviet human rights violations
have received minimal support from fellow protestors
in the West.
