# Toward your health: Jack Martin
## About women: Dad didn't tell you everything 
### JACK MARTIN 
When you
were in eighth
grade, your fa
ther may have
explained the
differences be
tween men
and women.
But Dad may
have left some
things out
when it comes
to women.
First of all, women's bodies
are different from men's. For
one thing, women have more
fat. The average Stanford
female has about 23 percent of
her body weight as fat, while
Stanford males have an
average of about 15 percent.
While lower body fat may be
desirable for social and athlet

ic reasons, figures much
below 18 percent for women
and 10 percent for men do not
result in added health benefits
and can cause irregular
menstrual cycles in women.
Women are somewhat
weaker than men and this con
dition can lead to injuries.
Women who exercise should
make a particular effort to
strenghthen the muscles in
the front of their body. Doing
half-situps will strenghthen
the abdominal muscles and
thus aid in the prevention of
lower back problems.
Strengthening the quad
ricep, the large muscle in the
front part of the thigh, helps
greatly to prevent knee injur
ies. Walking or jogging up
stairs is one good way to
strengthen this muscle. One
of the causes of what is called
"shin splints" is weak muscles
in the shin area of the leg. By
curling the toes and doing 20
ankle circles in each direction,
this area can be strengthened.
Women are also more
flexible than men. This differ
ence is due to certain female
hormones which make their
tendons and ligaments more
pliable. Thus while stretching
is important for both sexes,
men in particular should

spend additional time doing
flexibility exercises.
Since women weigh less
and have a lower basal
metabolism than men, they
need fewer calories and find it
harder to lose weight. Exercise
is particularly important for
women who want to lose
weight and maintain it.
Vigorous endurance exercise,
such as jogging or swimming,
not only burns calories during
the activity, but also raises the
resting metabolic rate so that
additional calories are burned
while at rest. Thus a physically
active person will actually use
up more calories while sleep
ing than a comparable person
who is largely sedentary.
Women also have a greater
need for iron than do men.
The RDA (recommended daily
allowance) for women is 18
milligrams per day, compared
to 10 milligrams for men.
Liver, red meat, and dark
green leafy vegetables are the
best sources of iron in the
diet. Women should also
avoid drinking coffee with
their meals, since coffee taken
with food prevents the ab
sorption of 40 percent of in
gested iron.
Women should also pay at
tention to their calcium

intake. While the RDA is the
same for both sexes (800 mil
ligrams per day), American
women are often deficient in
calcium. This deficiency can
lead to osteoporosis, a condi
tion in which the bones
become so weak that the
slightest fall can result in a
fracture. Exercise not only
strengthens muscles but
bones as well, and combined
with sufficient calcium intake
prevents this situation from
developing. Milk and other
dairy products are the best
source of calcium.
Women also live longer
than men, an average of some
seven years longer in this

country. Almost all of this dif
ference is due to behavioral
variances between the sexes.
Men have more fatal auto acci
dents, drink to excess more,
smoke more, (although wo
men, unfortunately, are catch
ing up), go to the doctor less
when they are sick and are
more successful at committing
suicide.
Women, especially pre
menopausal women, have
fewer heart attacks than men.
In part this difference is due to
the higher levels of a type of
cholesterol — called HDL or
high-density lippopro
teins — which women pos
sess. HDL seems to pre

vent the blockage of ar
teries, thereby preventing
heart attacks. A second type of
cholesterol — called LDL or
low-density lippopro
teins — is regarded as the
culprit in this process of ar
terial blockage.
Thus the ideal is to have a
relatively low total blood
cholesterol (180 to 200 mil
liliters), and a high HDL figure
so as to give a total cholesterol
to HDL ratio of around three.
For example, if your total
cholesterol is 180, your HDL
should be 60. Information on
blood cholesterol can be ob
tained relatively cheaply by a
routine blood test. HDL levels

can also be raised by en
durance exercise (at least 20
minutes, three times a week),
and by moderate intake of al
cohol. One or two beers or
glasses of wine daily seems to
have a protective effect in rela
tion to heart disease.
Men are also smarter and
dumber than women: there
are more men in the genius
and retarded I.Q. ranges.
Finally, women tend to have
a longer index finger as
compared to their ring finger,
while the reverse seems true
of men. I have no idea what
the significance of this circum
stance is, but I'll bet it is one
the things your father never
told you about women.

while the reverse seems true
of men. I have no idea what
the significance of this circum
stance is, but I'll bet it is one
the things your father never
told you about women.
When you
were in eighth
grade, your fa
ther may have
explained the
differences be
tween men
and women.
But Dad may
have left some
things out
when it comes
to women.
First of all, women's bodies
are different from men's. For
one thing, women have more
fat. The average Stanford
female has about 23 percent of
her body weight as fat, while
Stanford males have an
average of about 15 percent.
While lower body fat may be
desirable for social and athlet

ic reasons, figures much
below 18 percent for women
and 10 percent for men do not
result in added health benefits
and can cause irregular
menstrual cycles in women.
Women are somewhat
weaker than men and this con
dition can lead to injuries.
Women who exercise should
make a particular effort to
strenghthen the muscles in
the front of their body. Doing
half-situps will strenghthen
the abdominal muscles and
thus aid in the prevention of
lower back problems.
Strengthening the quad
ricep, the large muscle in the
front part of the thigh, helps
greatly to prevent knee injur
ies. Walking or jogging up
stairs is one good way to
strengthen this muscle. One
of the causes of what is called
"shin splints" is weak muscles
in the shin area of the leg. By
curling the toes and doing 20
ankle circles in each direction,
this area can be strengthened.
Women are also more
flexible than men. This differ
ence is due to certain female
hormones which make their
tendons and ligaments more
pliable. Thus while stretching
is important for both sexes,
men in particular should

spend additional time doing
flexibility exercises.
Since women weigh less
and have a lower basal
metabolism than men, they
need fewer calories and find it
harder to lose weight. Exercise
is particularly important for
women who want to lose
weight and maintain it.
Vigorous endurance exercise,
such as jogging or swimming,
not only burns calories during
the activity, but also raises the
resting metabolic rate so that
additional calories are burned
while at rest. Thus a physically
active person will actually use
up more calories while sleep
ing than a comparable person
who is largely sedentary.
Women also have a greater
need for iron than do men.
The RDA (recommended daily
allowance) for women is 18
milligrams per day, compared
to 10 milligrams for men.
Liver, red meat, and dark
green leafy vegetables are the
best sources of iron in the
diet. Women should also
avoid drinking coffee with
their meals, since coffee taken
with food prevents the ab
sorption of 40 percent of in
gested iron.
Women should also pay at
tention to their calcium

intake. While the RDA is the
same for both sexes (800 mil
ligrams per day), American
women are often deficient in
calcium. This deficiency can
lead to osteoporosis, a condi
tion in which the bones
become so weak that the
slightest fall can result in a
fracture. Exercise not only
strengthens muscles but
bones as well, and combined
with sufficient calcium intake
prevents this situation from
developing. Milk and other
dairy products are the best
source of calcium.
Women also live longer
than men, an average of some
seven years longer in this

country. Almost all of this dif
ference is due to behavioral
variances between the sexes.
Men have more fatal auto acci
dents, drink to excess more,
smoke more, (although wo
men, unfortunately, are catch
ing up), go to the doctor less
when they are sick and are
more successful at committing
suicide.
Women, especially pre
menopausal women, have
fewer heart attacks than men.
In part this difference is due to
the higher levels of a type of
cholesterol — called HDL or
high-density lippopro
teins — which women pos
sess. HDL seems to pre

vent the blockage of ar
teries, thereby preventing
heart attacks. A second type of
cholesterol — called LDL or
low-density lippopro
teins — is regarded as the
culprit in this process of ar
terial blockage.
Thus the ideal is to have a
relatively low total blood
cholesterol (180 to 200 mil
liliters), and a high HDL figure
so as to give a total cholesterol
to HDL ratio of around three.
For example, if your total
cholesterol is 180, your HDL
should be 60. Information on
blood cholesterol can be ob
tained relatively cheaply by a
routine blood test. HDL levels

can also be raised by en
durance exercise (at least 20
minutes, three times a week),
and by moderate intake of al
cohol. One or two beers or
glasses of wine daily seems to
have a protective effect in rela
tion to heart disease.
Men are also smarter and
dumber than women: there
are more men in the genius
and retarded I.Q. ranges.
Finally, women tend to have
a longer index finger as
compared to their ring finger,
while the reverse seems true
of men. I have no idea what
the significance of this circum
stance is, but I'll bet it is one
the things your father never
