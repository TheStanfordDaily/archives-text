## UOP Tigers claw women hoopsters 
### JOHN LIS 
If each game is supposed to
be a learning experience for a
young team, then the Stanford
women's basketball team
learned a major lesson last
night — they cannot take the
night off against a comparably
skilled team and expect to
win. The University of the
Pacific did the teaching last
night in Maples Pavilion,
handing the listless Cardinal
an 84-75 loss.
The Tigers dominated the
inside all night, out
rebounding Stanford 41-26.
Center Joy Dana, a 6-foot-3
senior, poured in 25 points
and pulled down 14 rebounds
to pace Pacific, and 6-1
teammate Janet Whitney
added 18 more points.
Leading 13-10 early on,
Pacific proceeded to run off 13
straight points while the Stan
ford offense took a hiatus and
went 5:22 without a field goal.
Freshman forward Kim Mer
cer ended the drought with
12-foot baseline jumper with
6:30 remaining in the half to
cut the deficit to 28-15, and the
Cardinal came to life. Mercer,
however, picked up her fourth
foul with 5:19 left in the half
and saw little action the rest of
the night.
The Stanford defense
turned around and held UOP

scoreless for 4:13 while the of
fense scored 11 unanswered
points and eventually pulled
within four at 30-26 with 1:18
left in the half. But Pacific
came back to open a 36-28
halftime lead.
The Stanford shooting
touch was non-existent in the
first half, as the Cardinal hit
only 8 of 23 from the field for
34.8 percent. Only a 12 of 16
showing from the line kept the
Cardinal within range. UOP,

by contrast, shot 51.5 percent
in the half and 55.4 percent for
the game.
The second half began
much as the first did. The
Stanford offense went into
hibernation while UOP
opened up a 46-31 lead in the
first three minutes and went
on to open its biggest lead of
the night, 64-46, with 10:28 left
to play.
A fast break lay-up by Whit
ney at 8:17 made it 72-54 for

the Tigers, but then the Car
dinal went to work. Stanford
outscored UOP 15-4 over the
next five minutes, and junior
forward Mary Bradach hit a 15-
footer from the baseline to
bring the Card within seven at
76-69 with 2:57 remaining.
That was as close as Stan
ford could get, however. The
two teams traded points down
the stretch as the Tigers hit
their free throws down the
stretch to keep the Cardinal at

bay.
No one on the Stanford side
could completely explain the
reasons behind the lackluster
performance. Head Coach
Dotty McCrea said, "I'm not
sure we were ready to play.
UOP played well, they beat us,
and they deserved to win. As
for our play — I'm baffled." , j
Freshman guard Erica
Mueser said, "They just out
played us and outhustled us.

Cardinal center Kim Mercer tips the ball away from UOP's
Joy Dana in last night's game at Maples Pavilion. The Card
suffered its first home loss of the season by a score of 84-75.
They took away our offense,
and we didn't adjust."
Captain Virginia Sourlis
tried to put the loss in per
spective. "It's just one game,
and we'll learn from our
mistakes," she said.
Sourlis led Stanford with 20
points on the night, followed
by Bradach and sophomore
center Sarah Evans with 18
each. Evans had another fine
offensive night, hitting eight
of nine shots from the field.
Pacific is now 3-1 this
season, while the Cardinal
falls to 2-2. Stanford will travel
to Las Vegas this weekend for
games with Baylor on Friday
night and Nevada-Las Vegas
on Sunday.
