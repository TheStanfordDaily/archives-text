# Committee makes Reagan library recommendation
## Report backs Rosse stance 
### 
The proposed Ronald Reagan
public affairs center should "make a
significant contribution to the teach
ing and research activities of the
University" and not be an extension
of the Hoover Institution, according
to a resolution unanimously pro
posed by the Faculty Senate Steer
ing Committee.
The resolution is scheduled for
discussion at tomorrow's senate
meeting.
The Steering Committee's stance
corresponds with University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's position, as
well as that of a faculty advisory

committee headed by Economics
Prof. James Rosse.
The question of whether the pro
posed public affairs center should
be within the normal academic
structure of the University or
governed by the Hoover Institution
has been hotly debated by
proponents and opponents of the
Reagan complex.
Board of Trustees President
William Kimball wrote Presidential
Counselor Edwin Meese Oct. 13 that
a public affairs center administered
bv the Hoover Institution would

have little chance of approval by the
trustees.
Meese replied Nov. 4 that
"unilaterally ruling out the adminis
trative role of the Hoover Institu
tion" in the public affairs center
would be equivalent to "making the
President 'an offer he cannot ac
cept.' "
The proposed resolution will be
the first formal action taken by the
Faculty Senate on the Reagan com
plex. Previous informal discussion
has indicated support for Kennedy's
and Kimball's stance.
