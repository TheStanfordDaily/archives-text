# 'Snob' sports not so snobby
## 
### TRASK LEONARD 
Polo. Tennis. Cricket.
Squash. Lacrosse. These
words conjure up visions of
expensive cars, Perrier drink
ing water and argyle socks.
Vet for almost all of the so
called "snob" sport athletes
here, such an image strikes far
from the truth.
In fact, seeing such a
"snob" on the lacrosse field
or on the badminton court is
no more likely than seeing
one on the basketball court or
football field. But the
stereotype persists.
"We're just a bunch of nor
mal guys out there trying to
have some fun," said Tom
Roupe, a member of the
lacrosse club."I don't sense
an attitude of arrogance in the
club that a lot of people not
connected with the program
sense."
Contrary to popular belief,
athletes who play such sports
as badminton, cricket, polo,
squash, lacrosse, tennis and
golf do not all come from high
society families and East Coast
prep schools. Actually, most
come from average
households and public
schools.
"Our club is hardly the
stereotype that is envisioned
by most," said Marian Men
ninger, secretary of the polo
club. "Our president, Arturo

Farias, comes from Mexico,
and several other people
come from places like Kansas
and Corpus Christi."
Menninger continued,
"They're not lightweights
intellectually either. We have
two law school students with
us, as well as two players
studying for their doctorates
in physics."
There are no exclusionary or
elitist doctrines maintained by
these organizations. For the
polo team, only adequate
riding skills and inexpensive
equipment are required.
"Our club is elitist in that
we can't afford that many
horses, so we are forced to
have limited membership,"
said Menninger. "The only
qualification is one's ability.
Yet we even have many ath
letes who had never played
the sport in their lives before
coming here. And the charge
is only $75.00, which is not un
reasonable at all, considering
the extreme costs involved."
There are no limitations at
all on lacrosse team member
ship.
Joe Villa, a native Califor

nian, had never played the
sport before attending Stan
ford.
"The club gave me a chance
to learn a new sport, with no
questions asked. It's really a
great program. And if anyone
would feel the effect of this
so-called snobby attitude, it
would be me, since I am a
newcomer to the sport. It just
doesn't exist, at least on the
lacrosse team," said Villa.
Ed Hlavka, also a freshman
on the team, agrees.
"There are certainly a few
players from private schools,
but you get that in any portion
of the Stanford community,"
he said. "I was not struck by
an elitist attitude when I first
joined, and I still don't sense
anything of the sort."
Perhaps the stereotype
emanates from the fact that
many of the sports are foreign
to most Americans.
A sport like cricket, for ex
ample, though extremely
popular in England receives
little attention here.
"Practically everyone in my
home country plays the
game," said jiles Brereton, a

graduate student in mechani
cal engineering, and leader of
the cricket club.
"All across the British Com
monwealth, the sport is quite
popular. We even have a few
players from India. And practi
cally all of us went to state
(public) school. Americans
sometimes just view us as
elitist, but we sure don't feel
that way," he said.
Sometimes the attitude held
by the non-players can con
tribute to the detriment of
many of the athletes.
"A lot of tennis teachers in
struct as if it were an elitist
sport, and that's too bad, be
cause it certainly isn't one,"
said Dana Treister, a member
of the tennis team. "It's a
mentally and physically ar
duous game that requires a lot
of guts. When the teachers
forget this, the players suffer
tremendously."
Though many of the "snob"
sports appear effortless and
painless, the contrary is much
closer to the truth.
"Lots of people think of
badminton as some sort of sis
sy sport," said Dave Randall,
president of the badminton
club."I never really thought
about it like that. It entails very
quick reflexes, good hand-eye
coordination and a certain
scrappiness that is not found
in any other sport."

forget this, the players suffer
tremendously."
Though many of the "snob"
sports appear effortless and
painless, the contrary is much
closer to the truth.
"Lots of people think of
badminton as some sort of sis
sy sport," said Dave Randall,
president of the badminton
club."I never really thought
about it like that. It entails very
quick reflexes, good hand-eye
coordination and a certain
scrappiness that is not found
in any other sport."



Polo. Tennis. Cricket.
Squash. Lacrosse. These
words conjure up visions of
expensive cars, Perrier drink
ing water and argyle socks.
Vet for almost all of the so
called "snob" sport athletes
here, such an image strikes far
from the truth.
In fact, seeing such a
"snob" on the lacrosse field
or on the badminton court is
no more likely than seeing
one on the basketball court or
football field. But the
stereotype persists.
"We're just a bunch of nor
mal guys out there trying to
have some fun," said Tom
Roupe, a member of the
lacrosse club."I don't sense
an attitude of arrogance in the
club that a lot of people not
connected with the program
sense."
Contrary to popular belief,
athletes who play such sports
as badminton, cricket, polo,
squash, lacrosse, tennis and
golf do not all come from high
society families and East Coast
prep schools. Actually, most
come from average
households and public
schools.
"Our club is hardly the
stereotype that is envisioned
by most," said Marian Men
ninger, secretary of the polo
club. "Our president, Arturo

Farias, comes from Mexico,
and several other people
come from places like Kansas
and Corpus Christi."
Menninger continued,
"They're not lightweights
intellectually either. We have
two law school students with
us, as well as two players
studying for their doctorates
in physics."
There are no exclusionary or
elitist doctrines maintained by
these organizations. For the
polo team, only adequate
riding skills and inexpensive
equipment are required.
"Our club is elitist in that
we can't afford that many
horses, so we are forced to
have limited membership,"
said Menninger. "The only
qualification is one's ability.
Yet we even have many ath
letes who had never played
the sport in their lives before
coming here. And the charge
is only $75.00, which is not un
reasonable at all, considering
the extreme costs involved."
There are no limitations at
all on lacrosse team member
ship.
Joe Villa, a native Califor

nian, had never played the
sport before attending Stan
ford.
"The club gave me a chance
to learn a new sport, with no
questions asked. It's really a
great program. And if anyone
would feel the effect of this
so-called snobby attitude, it
would be me, since I am a
newcomer to the sport. It just
doesn't exist, at least on the
lacrosse team," said Villa.
Ed Hlavka, also a freshman
on the team, agrees.
"There are certainly a few
players from private schools,
but you get that in any portion
of the Stanford community,"
he said. "I was not struck by
an elitist attitude when I first
joined, and I still don't sense
anything of the sort."
Perhaps the stereotype
emanates from the fact that
many of the sports are foreign
to most Americans.
A sport like cricket, for ex
ample, though extremely
popular in England receives
little attention here.
"Practically everyone in my
home country plays the
game," said jiles Brereton, a

graduate student in mechani
cal engineering, and leader of
the cricket club.
"All across the British Com
monwealth, the sport is quite
popular. We even have a few
players from India. And practi
cally all of us went to state
(public) school. Americans
sometimes just view us as
elitist, but we sure don't feel
that way," he said.
Sometimes the attitude held
by the non-players can con
tribute to the detriment of
many of the athletes.
"A lot of tennis teachers in
struct as if it were an elitist
sport, and that's too bad, be
cause it certainly isn't one,"
said Dana Treister, a member
of the tennis team. "It's a
mentally and physically ar
duous game that requires a lot
of guts. When the teachers
forget this, the players suffer
tremendously."
Though many of the "snob"
sports appear effortless and
painless, the contrary is much
closer to the truth.
"Lots of people think of
badminton as some sort of sis
sy sport," said Dave Randall,
president of the badminton
club."I never really thought
about it like that. It entails very
quick reflexes, good hand-eye
