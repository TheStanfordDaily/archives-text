Money
Even though Adam hasn't paid
yet, other staffers should show
some fiscal responsibility and turn
in their checks for the Friends of the
Daily banquet. And don't expect to
get away with pleading lack of mon
etary resources: all staffers can pick
up their paychecks beginning today.
Banquet zone
You are entering a dimension of
sight and sound, of ideas and sub
stance, of balconies and beer. You
have encountered â€” the Daily ban
quet. Imbibe the equally attractive
alcoholic alternatives at the offices
before heading to the (one story)
Shogun restaurant. Have your palms
pressed by the candidates for
editor. Listen to the witty, entertain
ing and original awards given out by
the always witty, entertaining and
original news editors. Yes you, too,
can experience all this entertain
ment for only $6.50. Sign up on the
office door.
Election
Declarations of candidacy for
editor of Vol. 185 are due by Tues.,
Dec. 6 at 5 p.m. A written statement
should be given to Kristen by that
deadline.
Candidates should make their
platforms available to the staff on
Mon., Jan. 9. A grill session will be
held the following day, and the elec
tion will be on Wed., Jan. 11.
The voting list will be posted by
Tues., Dec. 6.
