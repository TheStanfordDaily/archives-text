# Few women in science, study says

Stanford students generally conform to tradi
tional sex-role expectations regarding their
choice of a major, according to a recent curricu
lum study. But there are some surprises.
The study, which examined data over a 20-
year period, found that women here were over
represented among humanities and inter
departmental programs majors, somewhat un
derrepresented among earth sciences and natu
ral sciences majors, and severely under
represented among engineering majors.
But some important trends suggest less ad
herence to traditional patterns over the past
seven years, according to the study.
In engineering and the earth sciences, for ex
ample, Stanford women were more highly
represented than the national average in virtual
ly every department.
Although women constitute only 18 percent

of all engineering majors here the proportion of
women majoring in electrical engineering has
increased from 7 percent in 1975-76 to 18 per
cent in '79-80. Similarly, the number of women
in industrial engineering has increased from 5
percent in '75-76 to approximately 20 percent in
'79-80.
Women were actually overrepresented in the
applied earth sciences, and the overall propor
tion of women among '81-82 graduates in the
earth sciences was slightly larger than men.
According to the study, the proportions of
women in civil and mechanical engineering
were more than three times the national mean
in each field. The study attributes the increased
popularity of the industrial engineering major
among women to that fact that it serves as an al
ternative to the undergraduate business major,
which does not exist at Stanford.
The rise in electrical engineering was more
unexpected, as it is perceived to be among the

most rigorous engineering discipline, the study
said.
According to Vice Provost Herant
Katchadourian, a sponsor of the study, although
women are by no means flocking toward engi
neering, the University's efforts to present engi
neering as "not just as a man's field" are paying
off.
"Men and women essentially sort themselves
out," he said. "As a university all we can do is
make sure they are not discriminated against."
According to Gil Masters, associate dean of
the School of Engineering, the engineering de
partments have "not done anything" to encour
age women to enter engineering.
"We do not have any barriers that are sexual,
but we do not have a mission of equal represen
tation of women," he said. "It's a good program
with no stress either way."
Humanities and Sciences Dean Norman Wes
sells said he is satisfied to see the number of
women in engineering increasing.
"I'm delighted to see more wo
men taking engineering courses,"
he said. "The engineering depart
ment is being encouraging and
hospitable. There used to be only
one woman in an engineering class.
We are glad to see more."
The study also found that women
are much more sensitive to estab
lished measures of their abilities —
such as Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT) scores - than men are. With
out the confidence brought on by
high scores in mathematics, they are
much less likely than men to enter
technical disciplines.
With high technical ability but low
verbal ability, women tended to
avoid non-technical disciplines
more than men.
Katchadourian said that the Uni
versity is "raising the question" of
possible responses to the fact that
women are more inhibited by SAT
scores than men.
