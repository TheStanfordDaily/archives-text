Arms talks resume
Geneva—United States and Soviet
negotiators seeking to curtail intercontinen
tal nuclear weapons held one of their longest
sessions ever yesterday amid indications that
Moscow wishes to maintain some kind of
arms control dialogue after breaking off talks
here last week on medium-range nuclear
missiles in Europe.
At the end of the three-hour session, the
Soviet negotiators agreed to host the next
meeting, set for tomorrow. The agreement to
continue the talks this week removed some
concern in the U.S. delegation that Moscow
might carry out a threat voiced by Soviet offi-

cials in August to break off all nuclear arms
talks following deployment.
But U.S. and European diplomats
remained concerned that the current round
will halt for a Christmas recess by next week
and that Moscow may refuse to set a resump
tion date to show its pique for the arrival of
Pershing II and cruise missiles in West Ger
many and Britain.
Viktor Karpoc, the chief Soviet negotiator
at the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
(START) emerged from the U S. mission after
yesterday's session and told reporters "there
is no progress up to now. The position of the
American side is not for an agreement.

Court refuses to issue stay
Starke, Ma.— The U.S. Supreme Court
and a federal appeals panel refused yester
day to spare the life of convicted murderer
Robert Sullivan, clearing the way for his ex
ecution this morning.
The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals first
vacated a stay of execution that had been
issued on Monday, and the case went to the
high court, which refused to issue a stay last
night. It was the third time the Supreme
Court had rejected his case.
Steve Hull, a spokesman for Gov. Bob
Graham, said the electrocution, originally set
for yesterd.iy morning, was rescheduled for
10 a.m. EST today.
State Prison Superintendent Richard Dug
ger earlier set the execution for 7 a.m. today,
but delayed it three hours to give the defense
more time to prepare an appeal claiming that
Sullivan may have an alibi, according to Syd
ney McKenzie, the governor's general coun
sel.
A plea from Pope John Paul II that Sullivan
be taken off death row was rejected by
Graham last night.
Sullivan, 36, a Roman Catholic, insists he is
innocent.
Sullivan, who was convicted of murdering
a restaurant manager during a robbery, won
a temporary reprieve Monday night from
Chief justice John Godbold of the 11th U.S.
District Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
But the court's 12 judges decided yesterday
not to hear Sullivan's Appeal and U.S. Su
preme Court Justice Lewis Powell was asked
to issue another stay.
U.S.-lsraeli relations warm
Washington — President Reagan and Is
raeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir yesterday
launched a greatly expanded U.S.-lsraeli
partnership for strategic and political
cooperation that marks a major shift away
from the arm's length coolness the adminis
tration had displayed toward Israel for the
past two years.
The two leaders took the first step toward a
revitalized relationship by establishing a joint
military committee to arrange for coopera
tion in such areas as combined planning,
joint maneuvers and the stockpiling of U.S.
equipment in Israel.
Reagan and other administration officials
also announced U.S. willingness to make
substantial additional concessions to Israel,
including: increasing the amount of military
aid that Israel does not have to repay, resum
ing the shipment of U.S.-made cluster bomb
artillery shells cut off during last year's war in
Lebanon, permitting the use of U.S. funds
for development of Israel's Lavi fighter plane
and negotiating a free-trade agreement be
tween the two countries.
The measures announced yesterday by the
two smiling leaders, following their second
day of White House talks, closely paralleled
the strategic cooperation agreement reached
by Reagan and Shamir's predecessor,
Menachem Begin in September, 1981.

Administration refuses visas
Washington — The Reagan administration
seeking to display toughness in its policies
toward Central America, refused to grant
U.S. entry visas yesterday to both a senior
member of Nicaragua's leftist regime and the
leader of El Salvador's main rightist group.
The State Department said Nicaraguan In
terior Minister Tomas Borge and Salvadoran
rightist leader Roberto d'Aubuisson were
denied visas because the administration
decided that allowing them to visit the
United States would be "contrary to public
interest."
One official said that the twin decision was
a signal that the United States intends to
maintain pressure on Nicaragua to make con
cessions in Central American peace negotia
tions and at the same time maintain pressure
on El Salvador's U.S.-backed government to
crack down on right-wing "death squads."
"It shows that we're serious about what we
say, in case anyone had any doubts," the of
ficial said.
State Department officials had said private
ly last week that Borge's visa application
would be approved, but the White House
overruled that recommendation, administra
tion sources said.
German minister charged
Bonn, West Germany — A West German
public prosecutor declared yesterday that he
will bring bribery charges against Economics
Minister Otto Lambsdorff, and the an
nouncement rocked Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's coalition government.
Although Lambsdorff's future in the gov
ernment remained unclear late yesterday,
the decision to bring criminal corruption
charges against him carried the ingredients
of a major crisis for Kohl's government,
already strained by internal bickering over
the controversial deployment of U.S. nuclear
weapons in Western Europe.
Heineken found alive
Amsterdam, Netherlands — Millionaire
brewery owner Alfred Heineken, who was
kidnapped at gunpoint three weeks ago, has
been found alive, a spokesman of the
Heineken brewery said early today, quoting
Amsterdam police.

Heineken's chauffeur, Ab Doderer, who
was kidnapped along with his boss Nov. 9,
also was released, according to the brewery
spokesman, who declined to be identified.
Police refused to immediately confirm that
the pair had been freed, but scheduled a late
morning news conference at police
headquarters.
There was no word whether a ransom
demand, reportedly in the range of $8 million
to $12 million, had been met.
There vvas also no word whether the ab
ductors had been apprehended.
Greyhound plans to resume
Greyhound Corp. announced yesterday
that it would move "full bore" toward
resuming full bus service, and financial
analysts said the company was prepared to
absorb a six-month strike costing $20 to $40
million to reduce its labor costs.
John Teets, the company's chairman, said
Greyhound Lines, Inc. plans to increase its
current level of service to about 24 percent
by mid-December, utilizing replacement
workers for the company's striking
employees. Greyhound has been operating
at about 17 percent of normal capacity since
Nov. 17, when it resumed limited operations
at the start of the third week of the strike.
Taking a tough line at the press conference
in Phoenix, Teets also said the company has
"reached the point of no return in protecting
the jobs'' of its 12,870 unionized employees,
and indicated the company would begin to
hire more new workers.
Stocks reach record high
New York— The Dow Jones industrial
average surged to an all-time high yesterday
in an afternoon rally that led the overall stock
market to a broad advance in heavy trading.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 17.38 to 1287.20 — surpassing the
previous peak of 1284.65 set on Oct. 10.
Big Board volume swelled to 100.46 million
shares from 78.21 million on Monday.
Today's weather
Cloudy with a chance of rain in the mor
ning. Light rain or showers likely in the after

Arms talks resume
Geneva—United States and Soviet
negotiators seeking to curtail intercontinen
tal nuclear weapons held one of their longest
sessions ever yesterday amid indications that
Moscow wishes to maintain some kind of
arms control dialogue after breaking off talks
here last week on medium-range nuclear
missiles in Europe.
At the end of the three-hour session, the
Soviet negotiators agreed to host the next
meeting, set for tomorrow. The agreement to
continue the talks this week removed some
concern in the U.S. delegation that Moscow
might carry out a threat voiced by Soviet offi-

cials in August to break off all nuclear arms
talks following deployment.
But U.S. and European diplomats
remained concerned that the current round
will halt for a Christmas recess by next week
and that Moscow may refuse to set a resump
tion date to show its pique for the arrival of
Pershing II and cruise missiles in West Ger
many and Britain.
Viktor Karpoc, the chief Soviet negotiator
at the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
(START) emerged from the U S. mission after
yesterday's session and told reporters "there
is no progress up to now. The position of the
American side is not for an agreement.

Court refuses to issue stay
Starke, Ma.— The U.S. Supreme Court
and a federal appeals panel refused yester
day to spare the life of convicted murderer
Robert Sullivan, clearing the way for his ex
ecution this morning.
The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals first
vacated a stay of execution that had been
issued on Monday, and the case went to the
high court, which refused to issue a stay last
night. It was the third time the Supreme
Court had rejected his case.
Steve Hull, a spokesman for Gov. Bob
Graham, said the electrocution, originally set
for yesterd.iy morning, was rescheduled for
10 a.m. EST today.
State Prison Superintendent Richard Dug
ger earlier set the execution for 7 a.m. today,
but delayed it three hours to give the defense
more time to prepare an appeal claiming that
Sullivan may have an alibi, according to Syd
ney McKenzie, the governor's general coun
sel.
A plea from Pope John Paul II that Sullivan
be taken off death row was rejected by
Graham last night.
Sullivan, 36, a Roman Catholic, insists he is
innocent.
Sullivan, who was convicted of murdering
a restaurant manager during a robbery, won
a temporary reprieve Monday night from
Chief justice John Godbold of the 11th U.S.
District Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
But the court's 12 judges decided yesterday
not to hear Sullivan's Appeal and U.S. Su
preme Court Justice Lewis Powell was asked
to issue another stay.
U.S.-lsraeli relations warm
Washington — President Reagan and Is
raeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir yesterday
launched a greatly expanded U.S.-lsraeli
partnership for strategic and political
cooperation that marks a major shift away
from the arm's length coolness the adminis
tration had displayed toward Israel for the
past two years.
The two leaders took the first step toward a
revitalized relationship by establishing a joint
military committee to arrange for coopera
tion in such areas as combined planning,
joint maneuvers and the stockpiling of U.S.
equipment in Israel.
Reagan and other administration officials
also announced U.S. willingness to make
substantial additional concessions to Israel,
including: increasing the amount of military
aid that Israel does not have to repay, resum
ing the shipment of U.S.-made cluster bomb
artillery shells cut off during last year's war in
Lebanon, permitting the use of U.S. funds
for development of Israel's Lavi fighter plane
and negotiating a free-trade agreement be
tween the two countries.
The measures announced yesterday by the
two smiling leaders, following their second
day of White House talks, closely paralleled
the strategic cooperation agreement reached
by Reagan and Shamir's predecessor,
Menachem Begin in September, 1981.

Administration refuses visas
Washington — The Reagan administration
seeking to display toughness in its policies
toward Central America, refused to grant
U.S. entry visas yesterday to both a senior
member of Nicaragua's leftist regime and the
leader of El Salvador's main rightist group.
The State Department said Nicaraguan In
terior Minister Tomas Borge and Salvadoran
rightist leader Roberto d'Aubuisson were
denied visas because the administration
decided that allowing them to visit the
United States would be "contrary to public
interest."
One official said that the twin decision was
a signal that the United States intends to
maintain pressure on Nicaragua to make con
cessions in Central American peace negotia
tions and at the same time maintain pressure
on El Salvador's U.S.-backed government to
crack down on right-wing "death squads."
"It shows that we're serious about what we
say, in case anyone had any doubts," the of
ficial said.
State Department officials had said private
ly last week that Borge's visa application
would be approved, but the White House
overruled that recommendation, administra
tion sources said.
German minister charged
Bonn, West Germany — A West German
public prosecutor declared yesterday that he
will bring bribery charges against Economics
Minister Otto Lambsdorff, and the an
nouncement rocked Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's coalition government.
Although Lambsdorff's future in the gov
ernment remained unclear late yesterday,
the decision to bring criminal corruption
charges against him carried the ingredients
of a major crisis for Kohl's government,
already strained by internal bickering over
the controversial deployment of U.S. nuclear
weapons in Western Europe.
Heineken found alive
Amsterdam, Netherlands — Millionaire
brewery owner Alfred Heineken, who was
kidnapped at gunpoint three weeks ago, has
been found alive, a spokesman of the
Heineken brewery said early today, quoting
Amsterdam police.

Heineken's chauffeur, Ab Doderer, who
was kidnapped along with his boss Nov. 9,
also was released, according to the brewery
spokesman, who declined to be identified.
Police refused to immediately confirm that
the pair had been freed, but scheduled a late
morning news conference at police
headquarters.
There was no word whether a ransom
demand, reportedly in the range of $8 million
to $12 million, had been met.
There vvas also no word whether the ab
ductors had been apprehended.
Greyhound plans to resume
Greyhound Corp. announced yesterday
that it would move "full bore" toward
resuming full bus service, and financial
analysts said the company was prepared to
absorb a six-month strike costing $20 to $40
million to reduce its labor costs.
John Teets, the company's chairman, said
Greyhound Lines, Inc. plans to increase its
current level of service to about 24 percent
by mid-December, utilizing replacement
workers for the company's striking
employees. Greyhound has been operating
at about 17 percent of normal capacity since
Nov. 17, when it resumed limited operations
at the start of the third week of the strike.
Taking a tough line at the press conference
in Phoenix, Teets also said the company has
"reached the point of no return in protecting
the jobs'' of its 12,870 unionized employees,
and indicated the company would begin to
hire more new workers.
