Arms talks resume
Geneva—United States and Soviet
negotiators seeking to curtail intercontinen
tal nuclear weapons held one of their longest
sessions ever yesterday amid indications that
Moscow wishes to maintain some kind of
arms control dialogue after breaking off talks
here last week on medium-range nuclear
missiles in Europe.
At the end of the three-hour session, the
Soviet negotiators agreed to host the next
meeting, set for tomorrow. The agreement to
continue the talks this week removed some
concern in the U.S. delegation that Moscow
might carry out a threat voiced by Soviet offi-

cials in August to break off all nuclear arms
talks following deployment.
But U.S. and European diplomats
remained concerned that the current round
will halt for a Christmas recess by next week
and that Moscow may refuse to set a resump
tion date to show its pique for the arrival of
Pershing II and cruise missiles in West Ger
many and Britain.
Viktor Karpoc, the chief Soviet negotiator
at the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
(START) emerged from the U S. mission after
yesterday's session and told reporters "there
is no progress up to now. The position of the
American side is not for an agreement.

Court refuses to issue stay
Starke, Ma.— The U.S. Supreme Court
and a federal appeals panel refused yester
day to spare the life of convicted murderer
Robert Sullivan, clearing the way for his ex
ecution this morning.
The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals first
vacated a stay of execution that had been
issued on Monday, and the case went to the
high court, which refused to issue a stay last
night. It was the third time the Supreme
Court had rejected his case.
Steve Hull, a spokesman for Gov. Bob
Graham, said the electrocution, originally set
for yesterd.iy morning, was rescheduled for
10 a.m. EST today.
