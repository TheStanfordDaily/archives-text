The physical therapy program at
the Medical School was an attractive
program for the University to have,
hut not central to the Medical
School's curriculum, University
President Donald Kennedy said last
night during his quarterly meeting
with the ASSU Senate.
Kennedy, discussing the recent
termination of the physical therapy
program here, said that the size of
the program made it difficult to
maintain the calibre found in the
Medical School's other depart
ments.
"We had to keep it small â€” I'm
not saying that a larger PT program
at say, a state university would not
attract the kind of people needed to
develop a vigorous program ... I
feel that we should either do some
thing well or not do it at all."
In other developments at the
meeting last night, graduate senator
James McGrath resigned, and
graduate senator Dirk Van Comper
nolle demoted himself to alternate
status because he felt he did not
adequately represent the student
body.
According to McGrath, his resig
nation was a result of time conflicts
between his academic work and his
senate duties.
In his hour-long meeting with the
senate, Kennedy also discussed
housing, the Inner Quad renovation
plans, the computer crunch, and al
cohol at Stanford.
In response to senate questions
about the possible construction of
new dormitories to relieve the
housing shortage or the repair of
older dorms to decrease the gap be
tween newer and older housing,
Kennedy said that at present no
major housing-related projects were
planned.
"We are not going to see any
major construction or renovation in

the near future," he said. He added
that the present financial situation
may force the University to look for
gift funds before any further proj
ects are planned.
Several senators expressed con
cern about the decision to pave the
Inner Quad. Kennedy described the
decision to renovate the quad as
one involving "a debate between
historians, aestheticians and neo
homesteaders." He said that though
the final renovation couldn't pos
sibly please everyone, putting a
lawn on the Inner Quad was expen
sive and inconsistent with the
Quad's present use.
The shortage of student computer

time at LOTS is a high priority con-,
cern, Kennedy said.
"We will attempt to keep LOTS
growing at the same rate as the
demand for computer time,' Ken
nedy said. "The problem is, we've
been behind all the way along."
Kennedy discussed the personal
computing boom on college
campuses, focusing on the recent
decision by Carnegie-Mellon Uni
versity (CMU) to require all entering
students to purchase personal com
puters. According to Kennedy, Stan
ford is one of 15 schools serving as
consultants in CMU's new program,
which will have nationwide implica
