# Natural and computer languages linked
## University receives grant 
### KAREN BOLLERMANN 
The System Development Foundation of Palo Alto
recently granted the University $21 million for research
in the fields of natural and computer languages.
Brian Smith of (he Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
said that the grant is being given to the University's
Center for the Study of Language and Information
(CSLI) "to support the development of a scientific field
which will unify the technological practice of many dif
ferent fields."
Natural, or human, language and computer language
both utilize symbols to convey a message. According to
Philosophy Prof. Jon Barwise, director of CSLI, "since
people have consciously designed computer languages
using their own intuition," developing viable explana
tions about the underlying theories upon which the
various language fields rest "could change the way that
language and thinking are understood."
There are two main ideas at work behind the re
search, according to Smith. The first is that many disci
plines, including linguistics, logic and philosophy, are

wrestling with the same fundamental problems. The
second is that this similar domain is somehow related
to the field of computer science.
The recognition of the hypothesis that these fields
share an elementary relationship is the basis for the re
search project. Smith describes the project as being
"not a single, narrow theory, but rather many people
on a common venture."
CSLI proposes to use the grant money to purchase
the necessary computer equipment, to pay for re
searchers' salaries, to bring in visiting scholars and to
support graduate student research. The computers will
be used as a sort of testing ground for possible theories
about the nature of language.
Barwise described the process as "taking a theory
about human language and predicting its conse
quences. The theory can then be tested on computers
and the predicted consequences can be compared to
the actual consequences, thus helping to revise and
define the original theory."
