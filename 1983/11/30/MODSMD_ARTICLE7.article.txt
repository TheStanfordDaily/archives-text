# Lodging facilities for families of sick to be constructed
## 
### 
The William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation of Menlo Park has given
almost $4 million to the Assistance
League of Santa Clara County for the
construction of a 42-unit building
near the Medical Center for short
term accommodations for patients
and their families.
The building will provide short
term lodging for families of hospi
talized patients, potential heart
transplant recipients, cancer out
patients and other out-of-town
patients who come to the Medical
Center for substantial periods of
time.
leanne Kennedy, director of com
munity relations for Stanford Uni
versity Hospital, said the building
will fill an "overwhelming" need for
both families of hospitalized
patients and outpatients for low
cost temporary housing.
Kennedy, who has worked with
the League for more than three
years in planning the project, said
the project has "a lot of backing
from the heads of the clinical de
partments" and many physicians at
the Medical Center.
Kay Clair, chair of the League's
Housing of Medical Emergencies
project, said the building will be
"like a miracle" for the patients and
their families who cannot find affor
dable housing in the Stanford area.

Currently, the Assistance League
leases four apartments in the Oak
Creek apartment complex near the
Hospital, offering 9-week rentals
to families and patients at a $10 per
day rate.
All four units have experienced
100 percent occupancy. Kennedy
said she anticipates that the 42 units
in the new building will also have
many eager occupants.
Selection of potential occupants
of the units will be determined by
social workers at the Medical Cen
ter. Occupancy will be limited to
those living outside a 50-mile radius
of the Medical Center, and stays will
be restricted to nine weeks.
