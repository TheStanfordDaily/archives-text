# Ed School resignation raises affirmative action questions

### MARY SMATHERS 
The recent resignation of Ar
turo Pacheco, associate dean of
the School of Education, who is
leaving because of frustrations
about the University's affirmative
action program, has sparked con
cern about the status of minority
recruiting here.
Pacheco's resignation has also
caused speculation over the fate
of the Bilingual Bicultural Educa
tion Program at the School of
Education.
Pacheco, one of 10 Chicano
faculty members in the University
and one of two minority faculty
members in the Education
School, resigned three weeks
ago because, as he stated in a
memo to his colleagues, "There
are several areas within the
school that severely distress me
and ... I have felt frustrated in
my attempt to bring about con
structive change. Principal
among these is the area of affirm

ative action, at the level of both
faculty and students."
Pacheco, who teaches courses
in bilingual education, pointed
out that 10 years ago the school
had two black and two Chicano
professors. The school now has

no black faculty members.
"I was hired in 1972, the ninth
of the 10 Chicano faculty mem
bers now here," Pacheco said in
an interview with The Daily.
"Obviously, our numbers
haven't increased significantly in
10 years."
Education School Dean Myron
Atkin said he is "distressed that
we haven't made more progress"
in the area of hiring minority pro
fessors. But he added, " I sense
great support in the faculty for
this area."
Although Atkin said the speed
with which the school can
replace Pacheco will depend on
the budget, he added that "we
have a responsibility to make a
concerted attempt" to search for
minorities.
Cecilia Burciaga, assistant
provost for faculty affairs, said
that although many blacks go
into the field of education, the
