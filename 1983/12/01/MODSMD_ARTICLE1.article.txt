# Ed School resignation raises affirmative action questions
## 
### MARY SMATHERS 
The recent resignation of Ar
turo Pacheco, associate dean of
the School of Education, who is
leaving because of frustrations
about the University's affirmative
action program, has sparked con
cern about the status of minority
recruiting here.
Pacheco's resignation has also
caused speculation over the fate
of the Bilingual Bicultural Educa
tion Program at the School of
Education.
Pacheco, one of 10 Chicano
faculty members in the University
and one of two minority faculty
members in the Education
School, resigned three weeks
ago because, as he stated in a
memo to his colleagues, "There
are several areas within the
school that severely distress me
and ... I have felt frustrated in
my attempt to bring about con
structive change. Principal
among these is the area of affirm

ative action, at the level of both
faculty and students."
Pacheco, who teaches courses
in bilingual education, pointed
out that 10 years ago the school
had two black and two Chicano
professors. The school now has

no black faculty members.
"I was hired in 1972, the ninth
of the 10 Chicano faculty mem
bers now here," Pacheco said in
an interview with The Daily.
"Obviously, our numbers
haven't increased significantly in
10 years."
Education School Dean Myron
Atkin said he is "distressed that
we haven't made more progress"
in the area of hiring minority pro
fessors. But he added, " I sense
great support in the faculty for
this area."
Although Atkin said the speed
with which the school can
replace Pacheco will depend on
the budget, he added that "we
have a responsibility to make a
concerted attempt" to search for
minorities.
Cecilia Burciaga, assistant
provost for faculty affairs, said
that although many blacks go
into the field of education, the


Arturo Pacheco
school still does not have a black
faculty member.
"(UC-Berkeley) just appointed a
new dean of the education school
who is black and we can't even find
an assistant professor," Burciaga
said.
Underrepresentation of women
and minorities on the faculty con
tinues to be a problem throughout
the entire University, many adminis
trators say. Statistics for 1982 — data
on 1983 will be published in January
— show that out of the 1266 profes
sors here only 118 are women and 91
are minorities.
Twelve and a half percent of the
faculty in the School of Humanities
and Sciences are women and 10 per
cent are from minority groups. In
the Graduate School of Business
only two professors out of 67 are
women and eight are minorities.
In the last 10 years Stanford has

slowly improved its employment
record of minorities and women. In
1972, 4.83 percent of the tenure
track faculty members were
minorities and 6.47 percent were
women. By 1982, the figures had
reached 7.3 percent and 9.83 per
cent, respectively.
Pacheco also lamented in his let
ter the fact that the number of
minority doctoral students in the
School of Education has dropped in
the last 10 years from 25 percent to
10 percent.
"Only four new minority Ph.D.
students (two blacks and two
Chicanos) enrolled this autumn, the
lowest number in the last decade,"
Pacheco said. He said the
"problems are structural and hinder
minority recruitment at every stage
of the operation." He said the lack
of active recruitment, a reliance on
traditional criteria such as Graduate
Record Examination scores and the
shortage of financial support are
barriers that minority students face
in higher education.

Prof. Beatriz Arias, who will be the
sole minority faculty member at the
School of Education when Pacheco
leaves, said the school "has to look
at it as strengthening the program
and not as an appendage or an extra"
to have minority faculty and
graduate students.
Doubt over the future of the
school's bilingual education pro
gram was underlined yesterday
when students suspended a banner
on the wall of Cubberley that read,
"Bilingual education is dying and
our dean doesn't seem to care."
The students were concerned
about the loss of Pacheco and the
long-term illness of Prof. Robert
Politzer, who has been a strong sup
porter of the program. Atkin said he
would recommend to the faculty
that it find a replacement for Politzer
for the remainder of the year.
Atkin said he found the "anxiety
among the students understand
able. If I were in their position, I'd
be apprehensive too."
