Things weren't always what they are now. In 1938 the lan
ding at the old Boathouse (top left) on Lake Lagunita col
lapsed under the weight of a crowd of people during
Aquafollies. Nobody was hurt, but the building was con
demned. The current Boathouse (far left) was built in 1939.
The original clock tower (above) was built in 1915 in
response to alumni who wanted some place to put the clock
that was in the steeple of the church before the 1906
earthquake. The clock tower was located immediately be
hind Memorial Church where there is now a road. However,
the clock tower was removed to make room for the grassy
mall which runs along the side of the Quad. The clock in the
new tower (left) is the same one that was in the old tower
and the church steeple.
