### 
University Ombudsperson )ohn Goheen
released a disturbing report last week. He
noted an upsurge in student preprofes
sionalism and academic cheating, citing politi
cal uncertainties and personal anxieties as the
primary causes.
What this means is more people are major
ing in areas like economics, communication,
engineering and applied sciences; more are
preparing for and attending law, business and
medical schools; more are "borrowing" pro
grams in computer science classes; and more
are copying problem sets. All this, we are told,
because of uncertain domestic and foreign sit
uations.
People may be initially reluctant to accept
this cause-effect relationship. After all, missiles
in Europe don't have a really profound effect
on your mechanical engineering project, right?
But the connection is there, hidden beneath a
network of seemingly questionable logic.
Political events like the deployment of
missiles overseas, the invasion of Grenada and
the showing of "The Day After," and economic
problems like the difficulty of finding a job all
promote uncertainty in our world. Students,
like any member of society — arguably more so
— are affected by such uncertainty. They're
scared. They're confused. Most of all, they're
worried. And so they look to their education
and react accordingly. They choose marketable

majors — damn it, it's hard to find a job out
there — to ease the threat of unemployment.
They gear toward graduate schools for the
same reason. And, when they deem it neces
sary, they cheat.
So what's a University to do? Not a whole lot.
Hopefully the attention drawn to the Goheen
report will raise awareness. Students and fac
ulty can be more attune to the possibilities of
cheating and strive to prevent it. The Honor
Code may be more strictly enforced.
The real cure to this enigma lies in the stu
dents themselves. It's simplistic to say, "Don't
cheat; don't be preprofessional." Instead, at
tack the problem at its root. As Goheen sug
gests, it's the uncertainty of world affairs that
plagues us. By being intense — and often
hyper — about school, grades, and ultimately,
jobs, students may be trying to retreat into a
paradise of ignorant bliss: "If only I can get a
secure position, then everything will be won
derful," they may think.
But cheating isn't wonderful and neither is
choosing an academic route simply because of
the personal and financial security it will even
tually yield. Whether or not students choose to
attack world problems to get at the heart of the
matter is an individual choice, but they should
at least think about Goheen's findings before
their next academic decision.
