# It's Stanford-in-Space
## 
### 
Astronaut Sally Ride gave us the first clue
when the former Stanford student went up in
the space shuttle this summer. Then we
learned that consulting Prof. Owen Carriott is
currently orbiting about in the shuttle and even
performing Stanford-designed experiments.
And now we find that some Stanford graduate
students have proposed a new shuttle
launched space station.
It's obvious what's in the works here. No
doubt about it. The expansion of our overseas
campus program will not only be to Washing
ton, D.C., but also to the Milky Way. Yes,
Stanford-in-Space is coming soon as part of
this campus' newest "universal university"
program.
Picture it now if you will. Interested students
will apply for limited spots on NASA's newest
space station. Possible courses could include
Philip Zimbardo's "Shyness in Space: How to
Establish a Cosmic Relationship"; Herant
Katchadourian's "Alien Sexuality"; Albert El

sen's "Introduction to Lunar Art: Impressionist
Influence in Craters"; Ron Rebholz's
"Shakespeare: A Midsummer Night's Solstice,
Romeo and Jupiter, Merchant of Venus"; and
Jack Martin's "Orbital Health and Fitness."
Even the ASSU Guest Professorship Bureau
may take action. The leading possible guest
professor is, of course, astronaut, senator and
presidential candidate John Glenn. His class
could even be broadcast over KZSU via the
Dish if it's popular.
All in all, Stanford-in-Space should prove
quite valuable to the academic prosperity of
this university. Space, as they say, is the last
frontier; an entire campus devoted to it would
be ideal to solve the problems around us. We
always hear about the lack of housing spaces,
open spaces, and the most troublesome of all
— parking spaces. Stanford-in-Space could
seek out the answers beyond the stars to help
alleviate such earthly problems. What more
could one ask from academia?
