## A
						dismal visit to Los Angeles 
### 
It was not an auspicious start. I
was in the grips of a tenacious flu,
the taxi meter ticked over the $30
mark and I was already late for my
job interview. The sky was some un
wholesome shade of orange-brown,
a color not known to occur in na
ture. Downtown Los Angeles was
nowhere in sight. But just then the
cab driver pulled over and an
nounced we were at the court
house. And sure enough, a tall
building loomed 10 feet ahead, just
visible through the haze. I had dis
covered the twilight zone.
Once inside the courthouse I
sighed with relief, though I was a bit
disturbed to see my breath come
out orange-brown. Now the only
hurdle was an array of security
guards blocking the elevators. I've
never known the right way to ap
proach guards. I usually try looking
in another direction, but then they
think I have something to hide. Al
ternately, I could pretend to be
watching television on my watch,
but walking into a wall makes you
look even worse. So I looked confi
dently ahead, making eye contact
with the guard. I much prefer metal
detectors, which can't stare into
your soul.
At any rate, the guard demanded I
put my bag on the table. To expedite
the process, I moved to open it.
"Hands off," he barked. "You might
surprise me with something."
Foiled again! I was just about to
whack him over the head with a bot
tle of aspirin. Obviously I must have
matched the terrorist profile.
As a graphic photo of Ronald
Reagan smiled down on us from the
wall, the guard proceeded to
thoroughly examine my belongings,
disapprovingly thumbing through
my subversive French novel. He
then removed my aspirin and asked
me if I got headaches often. He in
formed me aspirin would upset my
stomach and I should take vitamins
instead. I was about to ask if he
made house calls when he rendered
me speechless by opening the bot
tle and sniffing several aspirin
tablets. I must also have matched
the drug-courier profile. Or maybe
he was just training to be a police

dog. I was about to launch into an
indignant lecture on the Fourth
Amendment when I glanced back
up at Ronald Reagan and realized it
was hopeless.

So I looked confi
dently ahead, making
eye contact with the
guard. I much prefer
metal detectors„
which can't stare
into your soul.

Somehow, I managed to leave the
courthouse a free man. Better yet,
the sky had actually turned blue,
and an attractive skyline stood
before me. In all fairness I must ad
mit downtown L.A. has it all over the
San Francisco financial district. I was
perfectly content to while away the
day riding the 16 glass elevators in
the Bonaventure Hotel.
Soon it was time to leave. As I
stood at the bus stop a woman came
up to me and asked if I'd like a
limousine ride to the airport for $5.
Since she wasn't also offering me
candy, I figured it was safe.
As soon as I got in I started regret
ting it. The radio was warning of
Cod's coming "day of wrath" and
requesting tax-deductible donations
(presumably to provide refresh
ments). And the limousine took off
like a bat out of hell. It was the most
amazing ride I've ever taken — she
made the typical New York cabbie
look like a wimp. Woody Allen once
cited the ability to turn right on red
as California's most important cul
tural advantage. Obviously, he
never contemplated the thrill of
straight on red.
After forcing a semi off the road,
the driver turned to me and began
to speak of religion. Apparently, the
brightness of the sun represented

God, and the darkness was Satan. I
resisted the temptation to ask how
smog fit into this theory. As an un
repentant heathen, it seemed wisest
to keep a low profile. However, I did
begin to worry she might actually be
taking me to an Eckankar meeting.
After explaining how she had for
saken worldly things, she amazed
me by stopping at a green light and
beckoning over a Mexican fruit ped
dler. As 50 livid motorists honked at
us in unison, she nonchalantly
proceeded to barter for oranges. At
this point I slithered under the car
seat and remember nothing of the
next 15 minutes.
Miraculously, we arrived at the
airport in one piece. The Lord had
delivered me. Now if only He can
get me the job I interviewed for. I
promise to forsake aspirin and start
taking vitamins. I'll wear garlic to
ward off Satan. And I promise I'll
even stop writing nasty things about
L.A.
