Chalk talk
In his column "Tolerance for
morality" (Daily, N0v.29), Philip
Chalk has once again displayed his
imposing moral authority. In a
previous column he called upon
the University to instill a single
world view (presumably one Chalk
agrees with) in all undergraduate
students. Now he claims the
"right" to censor the behavior of
his fellow students whenever he
finds it morally offensive.
Chalk feels that within the ivory
tower of academia — unlike the
surrounding "real world" —
"moral egalitarianism" reigns,
subjecting poor Chalk's ears
to unwanted volleys of obscenity. (I
would suggest he not visit New

York City.) Chalk implies that other
unnamed "moral sensibilities" are
also frequently trampled here at
Stanford, and offers two examples:
1) My roommate continually vi
olates my desires for privacy and
sleep by "banging out the rhythms
of love" on the bunk above mine,
and 2) Housemates with whom I
jointly purchase some communal
items force me to pay for someth
ing I do not want. These are cer
tainly important examples of the
need for respect and consideration
in dealing with the people with
whom one lives. They do not,
however, revolve around the issue
of tolerance for "moral sen
sibilities."
The distinction is perhaps a diffi
cult one to draw, but it is necessary
nonetheless. Without it, moral and

practical issues become confused
with one another.
Chalk claims that "moral
egalitarianism is the odor of in
security." He is perhaps correct in
that those of us who hesitate to
pronouce moral judgment lack
Chalk's certainty that our moral
opinions issue from a "hot line" to
Truth. But the world is not as neat
and tidy as Chalk may imagine it to
be. Certainly we should be respect
ful toward and considerate of our
fellow students. Let us not be too
concerned, however, with occa
sionally outraging their "moral
sensibilities."
