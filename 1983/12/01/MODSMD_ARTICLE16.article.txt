# Why we invaded Grenada
## 
### 
Now that the dust has settled in Grenada, some facts
are available which weren't so clear at the time of the
invasion. Perhaps it is time to re-evaluate the United
States' reasons for the invasion.
First the reasons which turned out to be valid:
• The students were in danger. The chancellor of the
medical school, Charles Modica, had more information
about affairs on Grenada than any other American
there. On the day of the invasion, Modica denounced
it, saying the government there was no threat to the
students. Subsequently, he was called to the State De
partment and confronted with the administration's in
telligence reports about Grenada. I have no idea what
was in the reports, or why they weren't made public to
bolster the administration's case. They convinced
Modica that the students had been in danger, though,
and I am not prepared to second-guess his evaluation.
But the invasion was never primarily about the medical
school.
• More than 90 percent of the Grenadians welcomed
the U.S. invasion. Some of this may simply be a case of
telling the victors what they want to hear; still, it is too
large to ignore. But the Grenadians are not all staunch
Reaganite anti-communists newly freed from oppres
sion. Thousands of them risked their lives trying to save
Marxist Prime Minister Maurice Bishop during the coup
which preceded the invasion. Grenadians almost unan
imously opposed the military junta which killed Bishop
and which we replaced. Bishop and his Marxist New
Jewel Movement, on the other hand, had been quite
popular. Grenada had had one of the lowest unemploy
ment rates and one of the highest GNP growth rates in
the Caribbean under his tutelage.
Which brings us to the bad reasons for the invasion:
• The coup on Grenada represented a further exten
sion of Cuban influence there. Bishop had been
Castro's closest ally in the Third World. The Cubans, it
turned out, knew about the coup, and were trying
frantically to prevent it. The Reagan administration has
not publicized this discovery very much.
• The new airport on Grenada was a military threat.
Almost all of the Caribbean nations which joined us in
the invasion have airports as large or larger than the
one being built on Grenada. The support buildings un
der construction at the Grenada airport could not han
dle military planes. The electronics and radar being in
stalled there were insufficient for military purposes.
More invidiously, the administration must have known
this was so, since all the contractors for the airport ma
terials were British or American.

• The arms stored on Grenada were a threat to the
United States, the Caribbean and Central America. This
is the worst of the excuses. The United States, since
1945, has attacked or subverted every leftist govern
ment in the hemisphere: (Witness Guatemala, Cuba
Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and Chile Of
course, Grenada was afraid of the United States, and
with good reason: It turned out they had not nearly
enough arms to deter an attack. It is beyond me how an
island with neither a navy nor an air force constitutes a
threat. It is hard to move armored personnel carriers in
rubber dingies. As for Central America, Grenada is
three times as far away as Cuba itself.
• The United States was invited into Grenada by
some island authorities and by several neighboring
countries. This is true, but it was equally true for the
Soviet Union in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia
in 1968. We need better reason than this.
• The United States dealt Cuba a great defeat. We
did prove that the 6000 best Marines, paratroopers and
Navy SEAL commandos can beat 800 Cuban reservists,
if we take them by surprise. But the wave of anti-
American revulsion across the rest of Latin America
amply compensates Castro. The real test in Grenada
will be if we let the New Jewel Party run in the free elec
tions there. If we don't, our last best excuse, restoring
democracy, will not be very convincing. If we do, it may
well be just a matter of time before the Cubans return
to Grenada. And in the parts of Latin America that really
matter, the Nicaraguan people have rallied around the
Sandinistas since the invasion, and the government in
El Salvador is closer now to outright military defeat than
at any time in that country's revolution. Castro can take
many such defeats.
• Successful U.S. military operations strengthen the
United States diplomatically. Latin America is more
alienated from the United States and riper for "Soviet
influence" today than at any time since Vietnam.
Moreover, Western Europe has not be< n exactly enthu
siastic about such unilateral U.S. military actions.
France and Britain historically have interests in the
Caribbean; one was not even informed about the
Grenada invasion, the other's advice was ignored.
Besides the invading nations, only two countries in
the entire world approved the Grenada operation when
it came to a U.N. vote. That may not disturb President
Reagan's breakfast, but it hardly constitutes an over
whelming success in foreign relations.
