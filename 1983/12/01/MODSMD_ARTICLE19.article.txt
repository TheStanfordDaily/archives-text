## Card hoops: A trip to a tourney? 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The last time Stanford went to a post
season basketball tournament, present Card
inal Coach Tom Davis was just a young
boy growing up in Ridgeway, Wis.
That was 42 years ago.
7 he 1941-42 Stanford team coached by
Everett Dean not only went to the NCAA
post-season tournament, they won the
thing, beating Dartmouth 53-38 in the
finals. It was Stanford's first and only na
tional basketball title.
Since then, Stanford basketball has gone
Irom bobbing in the sea of mediocrity to
drowning in it. Over the last 10 years, Stan
ford has been a miserable 107-160 and has
had exactly zero winning seasons.
But while not much has been happening
on the Stanford basketball front since the
1941-42 national championship season, a lot
has been going on in Davis' life. He has
up, received a Ph.D., started a family
and come to Stanford. He's come to Stan
tord to help it do something that has eluded
t for the last 42 vears.
"That (a post-season tournament) is a
;;oal, without a question, for Stanford's bas
<etball program," he says. "But the ques
:ion is: When are we going to reach it?
"We're trying to get ourselves in position
or a post-season tournament bid. But a lot
">t it depends on how we play. We've got to
ontinue to improve. We've got to make a
lent in the Pac-10 (Pacific-10 Conference)
ichedule."
Davis, also know as "Dr. Tomhas a his
ory of finding the cure for sick basketball
)rograms. In 1977-78, he took an 8-18 Bos
on College team and turned it into a 15-11
lub in a year. Four years later, Boston Col
ege ended its season a game away from the
JCAA post-season tournament's Final
our.
At Stanford, Davis achieved similar
esults in his first season, inheriting a 7-20
quad and tranforming it into a 14-14 team
sst year, the Cardinal's first non-losing
eason in 10 years.
Now, in Davis' second season, it's time
->r loftier goals. While a berth in the NCAA
□ urnament would require an almost
"liraculous Stanford hoop campaign, the

National Invitational Tournament (NIT) is
well within the Cardinal's capability.
Stanford has a number of things in its fa
vor as far as a post-season tourney berth is
concerned. First, the Card has personnel.
Nine lettermen from last year's squad
return, including all five starters. Among
those nine are a pair of All-America candi
dates — 6-foot-1 senior guard Keith Jones
and 6-7 senior center John Revelli.
"I think at what they do, they're the best
in the Pac-10," Davis says of Jones and
Revelli. "I think Keith is the best guard in
the Pac-10 and I think John is the best
power player in the Pac-10."
Second, Stanford has a favorable
schedule. The 13 non-conference games
are, with only a few exceptions, virtually
guaranteed wins. The Pacific-10 Conference
schedule is without question much more
rigorous, but not impossible.
So if Stanford wins, say, nine or 10 of
those non-conterence games and then goes
9-9 in Pac-10 play, it will finish with a 19-12
or 20-11 record, one which the NIT may find
hard to turn down.
Finally, Davis and company should have
excellent crowd support. In past years, the
atmosphere in the 7457-seat Maples
Pavilion has been anemic at best. But
before the 1983-84 season even began,
Davis and his staff had Maples for all practi
cal purposes sold-out. And nearly half
those season tickets have been sold to stu
dents, a far more vocal lot than the
faculty staff-dominated crowds ot the past.
Below is a part-by-part, position-by
position rundown of the 1983-84 season.
Style of play
Stanford, compared to its Pac-10 oppo
nents, fields the smallest team in the
league. The Card had only one player listed
over 6-7. That's junior forward Hans Wic
hary. He's 6-7V2.
"There are two philosophies (when you
lack size)," Davis says. "One, you can hold
the ball when you're outmatched and
spread them out — bring their big guys out
away from the basket.
"The other is to press and fast break and

try to take advantage that way. Obviously,
I've chosen the latter. There is a time to
hold the ball, there is a time to stall and
delay, but I don't like it as a basic strategy."
To sum up Davis' style ot plav in a phrase,
he likes to use all 94 feet on the basketball
court and all 40 minutes on the clock.
And to fast break and press as much as
Davis-coached teams do, the bench has to
be strong. Davis uses as many as 10 players
regularly in the course ot a game, substitut
ing in groups of three or four every few
minutes.
Though Davis teaches a number of halt
court offenses and defenses, most of his
coaching involves the transition game.
Stanford looks for the last break off every
shot, no matter if it is a scoring one or not.
The Card full-court presses for all 40
minutes.
Another feature of a Tom Davis team is
lots of layups. When Stanford doesn't get a
close-in shot off the last break, it looks to
work the ball inside to a Revelli or a Wic
hary. Thus, the forwards do most of their
scoring in half-court situations, while the
guards pick up their points off the fast
break.
Probably the biggest characteristic of
Davis teams is their hard-work ethic. "I
think the attitude on this team is one of our
strengths," Davis says."l don't think
there's a team that will work harder than
this one."
Guards
It guard is not Davis' strongest position, it
certainly is tops in sheer number, as usually
half of the 16 players suited up for a given
game are guards.
The Card guard corps is paced by lones,
who was the second leading scorer in the
Pac-10 a year ago with a 19.8 points per
game average, lones, who was selected as
an Honorable Mention All-American by the
Associated Press, scored a school-record
553 points last season while playing a
school-record 796 minutes.
Few guards in the country can penetrate
the basket area and score as Jones can. The

Mantord guard Keith Jones drives against a Bemidji State defender last Monday night.
The senior, who scored 20 points in that game, should be a focal point of the Stanford
offense this year.
