# Western Culture to drop track
## 
### LARRY GREEN Staff writer 
The Western Culture Program will
discontinue its philosophy-religion
track next year because the Religi
ous Studies Department "is no
longer going to participate," accor
ding to Carolyn Lougee, associate
dean of humanities and sciences.
The track, an interdisciplinary
program shared by the Religious
Studies and Philosophy Depart
ments, will likely be replaced by one
or more courses, Lougee said.
According to Rose Ann Christian,
a religious studies lecturer, the reli
gious studies faculty decided "it
didn't want to be in the Western
Culture Program anymore." Chris
tian declined to comment further.
Philosophy Prof. Julius Moravcsik
said the Religious Studies Depart
ment wants to pull out of the track
because faculty members "feel their
program is better if they offer intro
ductory programs outside of the
Western Culture Program."
Moravcsik indicated that the Phil
osophy Department is now submit
ting a proposal for a new track,
which will be an interdisciplinary
course shared with the History De
partment and will emphasize sci
ence.
"We (the Philosophy Department)
had to decide with enthusiasm to of
fer a track of our own," Moravcsik
said. He said that the current
philosophy-religion track was a
strong program but the proposed
replacement will be "enhancing the
sequence."
Other departments will probably
be interested in proposing replace
ment tracks, according to Moravcsik
and Christian.
'We hope the Western Culture
Program approves the proposal. I
think we'll have an outstanding se
quence to offer," Moravcsik said.
Philosophy Prof. Richard Pruitt,
who like Moravcsik is an instructor
in the philosophy-religion track,
said, "The track is up for grabs."
"Obviously it's going to be a
loss," Pruitt said of the demise of
the philosophy-religion track. He
pointed out that students wanting to
study Western culture "from a reli
gious perspective," will have to look
elsewhere.
