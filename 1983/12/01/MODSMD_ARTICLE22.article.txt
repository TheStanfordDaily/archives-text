# Card fencers face Spartans
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
The Stanford fencing team travels to San Jose
State tomorrow afternoon to take on a highly
regarded Spartan squad at 4 p.m.
The Cardinal men are 2-0 this season with vic
tories over the University of San Francisco (21-
6) and UC-Santa Cruz (15-12), while the women
are also 2-0, sporting victories over UC-
Berkeley (14-2) and UC-Santa Cruz (15-1).
For the Spartan women, this will be their first
meet of the year while the men opened with a
17-10 victory over USF.
The San Jose State men are one of the
strongest teams in the Western Region but will
be without their top three top fencers who
have been declared ineligible to compete due

to academic records at this juncture in the
season. Michael D'Asaro, son of the San Jose
State coach and the team's top sabre fencer,
along with the No. 1 Spartan fencers in epee
and foil will be unable to compete.
The Stanford men are led by Elliot Cheu, 5-1
in foil, and Andy Goorno, 6-0 in sabre.
The Spartan women are also strong this year
and will be looking for revenge following their
defeat at the hands of Stanford in the NCAA
tournament last year. Unlike the men, the San
Jose State women will be at full strength for the
tournament.
The top two Cardinal women fencers going
into the meet are Jennifer Vu, 8-0 this year, and
Kathy Correa, 7-0.
