## The 						right man for Stanford 
### 
Not just any football
coach will fit in at Stanford.
There seems to be an atti
tude among some colum
nists and alumni that the
Stanford athletic director
should try to find the best
football coach he can. Per
iod.
It shouldn't matter what
the alumni, the students or
the players want, say these
people. Stanford needs a
coach who has proven that
he can win.
The problem is that it
takes a special kind of per
son to coach at Stanford.
More is demanded of a
Stanford student athlete
than at most other schools.
Likewise, more should be
expected from a Cardinal
coach.
Some people think that
Stanford shouldn't be so
concerned about the image
of its coach, and that's true.
But there are certain other
qualities which a Stanford
coach must have.
Most of these qualities
can be classified under the
broad heading of ethics.
A Stanford coach has to
be able to keep the game in
perspective. While it might
seem obvious, someone
like Baltimore Coach Frank
Kush, who was accused of
slapping a player while at
Arizona State University, or
ex-Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes would not
do.
But there is more to
keeping the game in per
spective. It involves being
able to recruit, but doing it
within the guidelines of
NCAA and University
policy.
While many people feel
that the major knock on
San Jose State Coach Jack
Elway (a candidate for the
Stanford job) is that he
does not fit the Stanford
image and his "down
home country boy image"
would not go over well with
the Stanford alumni, there
is a more critical question.

Would Elway be able to
recruit within Stanford's
guidelines?
A large percentage of the
players that Elway has
recruited at San Jose State
have been junior college
transfers. Unfortunately for
Elway, in the early 19705,

Stanford moved away from
recruiting in this area,
feeling that it was not in the
best social or academic in
terests of the University to
concentrate on junior col
lege players.
If Elway came to Stan
ford, he would not only be
faced with this restriction,
but he would be forced to
recruit different kinds of
players than at San Jose
State. Recruiting here is
more than just convincing

the best local talent that
one's team is going to be a
good one. It involves
searching out a few
talented players who are
also good students and
convincing them that Stan
ford would be the right
place.

An example of a good
coach who was not able to
handle such restrictions is
Illinois Coach Mike White
who was fired at UC-
Berkeley following the 1977
season. While the NCAA
never invoked any sanc
tions against the Bears,
there were numerous
rumors of recruiting viola
tions, and according to
several reports, running
back Chuck Muncie hardly
ever showed up at class.

A school like Stanford
which prides itself on its
academic reputation could
never risk such embarrass
ment.
Another important
quality for a Stanford coach
is to be able to deal with
the Stanford athlete.
Many successful coaches
would not fit in well at Stan
ford. People like Barry Swit
zer and the late-Bear Bryant
with their "work them till
they die" philosophy
would not be successful on
the Farm. One recent ex
ample is Rod Dowhower
who took the Stanford
reins following the
departure of Bill Walsh in
1977. Dowhower was
criticized by his players for
his overly regimented
practices and resigned at
the end of the 1978 season
with a 5-5-1 record.
There are several can
didates for the job that
have had experience
dealing with universities
similar to Stanford.
UC-Davis Coach )im Soc
hor has attracted top talent
(like the New York Jets' first
round draft choice Ken
O'Brien) to Davis without
even the benefits of athletic
scholarships. San Francisco
49er quarterback and
receiver coach Paul Hackett
has also coached at Davis,
while other candidates like
Boston College Coach Jack
Bicknell and Brigham
Young University Coach
LaVelle Edwards have had
the experience of recruit
ing for universities with
strict academic require
ments.
While a coach's image
may not be important,
there are several other
areas which have to be
carefully considered when
choosing a coach for Stan
ford. The best coach for
one school may not be the
best coach for this univer
sity.
Or change around an old
saying: A different coach
for different folks.


Jack Elway
