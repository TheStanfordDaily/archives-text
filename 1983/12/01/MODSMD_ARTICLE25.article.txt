## The 						Vatican Collections: The 
### LANCE STERLING 
These pictures represent part of the
more than 200 pieces of art on display
at the M.H. de Young Museum in San
Francisco as a loan from the Vatican Col
lections. On display through Feb. 19,
the collection draws not only on the
Vatican Museum, but also the Apostolic
Vatican Library, St. Peter's Basilica, its
Grotte and its Treasury, and the papal
apartments.
The selection was designed to give an
idea of the range and magnitude of the ar
tistic resources in the Vatican and to
reflect the history of papal patronage of
the arts.

The collection is divided into five sec
tions, each representing a different per
iod in the development and changing
meaning of the papacy's concern with the
commissioning, preserving and collec
tion of art. Artists represented include
such famous names such as Giotto, Fra
Angelico, Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci and
Matisse, as well as various craftsmen who
worked in metals and ivory.
The exhibit will be open seven days a
week, including all holidays, from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. Mondays, Thursdays, Saturdays
and Sundays, and from 10 a.m. to 8:30
p.m. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
The tickets cost $5 for adults, $.$ for those

between the ages 5 and 17, as well as for
those 65 and over. Tickets are available at
the museum, and can also be purchased
through BASS or by calling 869-0126. BASS
tickets include a small surcharge.
Tickets are allotted by half-hour inter
vals, but once inside, the visitor may
remain until closing time. Since tickets
for some weekends and holiday dates
have already sold out, calling the
museum (386-2202 or 893-0126)
beforehand is advisable.
This is the first time art from the Vatican
Collections has been sent overseas, and it
is only being shown here, New York, and
Chicago. Like the Tutankhamen exhibit,
this is truly a chance of a lifetime.
