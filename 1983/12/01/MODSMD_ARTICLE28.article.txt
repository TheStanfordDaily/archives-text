Hi Kids!
This is Ed Barbara down at The
Stanford Daily. We got a banquet
special. We want to sign up 10,000
new staffers. We got hilarious jokes
by news editors. We got Big Game
buttons. We got an Elvis Costello
impersonator. We got Bradley
Rubidge. We got Alan's mystery
guest. We got a news editor almost
in the buff. We got squid. No co
signers necessary. Senior writers
welcome. Se habla espanol.
Bye Kids!
Pay up. $6.50 for the banquet, $10
for the Friends of The Daily. Rumor

has it The Chief hasn't even paid
yet, but that shouldn't deter you.
Come on down.
