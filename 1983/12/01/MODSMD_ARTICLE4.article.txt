# Commission will survey students on proctoring
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff Writer 
In response to what "appears to be a real problem
with faculty members adhering to the Honor Code,"
the Honor Code Commission will conduct a survey of
students next quarter to determine whether the pres
ent code still adequately represents their needs and
desires, according to Commission Chair Mark Landes
mann.
He said that in recent years there have been
"stronger and stronger indications" that "a small, dis
senting minority" of the faculty has violated the Honor
Code by proctoring examinations.
As defined in "Interpretation and Applications of the
Honor Code," proctoring means "being present in the
examination room for the purpose of preventing dis
honesty."
Not only do faculty violations "harm the credibility of
the Honor Code," they "are counter-productive to the
third-party burden shared by the students taking the
examination," said Landesmann, a junior. This burden,
he said, is the current requirement that students taking
the exam must report others in the class whom they
suspect of cheating.
"To me, it doesn't make any sense to require stu
dents to turn in others who might be cheating if there is
already a faculty member present," Landesmann said.
"Proctoring practices, according to the indications

we have now, seem to be prevalant in the science de
partments," Landesmann said, noting that students
who wish to go on to graduate school feel a great pres
sure to do well.
Landesmann declined to name any professors
suspected of proctoring.
Last spring, in what Landesmann called "a
destructive fight," former Council of Presidents mem
ber Mark Epstein accused Chemistry Prof, lames Col-
Iman of Honor Code violations, alleging that the pro
fessor had proctored exams. The case was left un
resolved after Epstein, who had made the University
aware of his charges, realized he had little power to
amend the practices and dropped the case.
A week later, at the urging of Epstein, the Honor
Code Commission launched a broad investigation of
proctoring practices at the Universtiy.
Landesmann added that "proctoring was considered
to be a problem before the Epstein case."
I he survey, which will either be mailed or hand
distributed to students during the third week of winter
quarter, will ask students to anonymously answer 10
questions concerning their views on the present rules
and functions of the Honor Code, Landesmann said.
He added that the questions about proctoring practices
will pertain only to final examinations.
No one from the commission will actually be present
in any classes to monitor for proc
toring, Landesmann said. The sur
vey "is not intended to charge pro
fessors" with violations, but to have
"those who do (violate the code)
justify their behavior," he said.
Results from the survey will be re
ported by the sixth week of the
quarter to the Student Conduct
Legislative Council and University
President Donald Kennedy. Landes
mann said it is too early to predict if
changes need to be made in the
Honor Code, but said the responsi
bility for rewriting the code would
rest with the SCLC and would prob
ably require a student referendum.
The Honor Code Commission, al
though not delegated the authority
to revise the code, may
"recommend changes or give direc
tion to the SCLC," Landesmann
said. The 10-member committee is
made up of four students and six
faculty members.
