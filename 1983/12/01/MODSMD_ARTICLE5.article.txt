# Mosher to appeal to Kennedy
## 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Senior staff writer 
The University last week gave
former graduate student Steven
Mosher a one-month extension on
what will be his final appeal for
reinstatement as a doctoral can
didate in anthropology, according
to an assistant to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
Mosher now has until the end of
December to submit his grievance
to Kennedy, who is now the only
University official who can reverse
the earlier decision to expel him.
Marlene Wine, special assistant to
the president, said Kennedy will not
comment on Mosher's case until an
appeal is submitted.
This is the second extension given
to Mosher after his last appeal was
denied by Gerald Lieberman, vice
provost and dean of graduate
studies and research, in September.
Mosher's attorney, Steven Fab
bro, from the law offices of Melvin
Belli in San Francisco, said yesterday
he had asked for the extension be
cause he needed more time to help
Mosher prepare the appeal.
Mosher could not be reached for
comment by The Daily yesterday.
He has said in the past that he will
sue the University if he is not
reinstated as a student in the An
thropology Department.
Mosher, author of the recently
published book, "Broken Earth,"
which describes the life of the rural
Chinese, has claimed repeatedly
that he was kicked out because he
published in a Taiwanese
newsmagazine an article that docu
mented forced abortions and infan
ticide in the People's Republic of
China. Mosher has said the Univer
sity terminated his doctoral can
didacy because of pressure from the
Chinese government.
University officials have said that
the article had nothing to do with
Mosher's dismissal. A confidential
University report details the
grounds for taking action against
Mosher, but both the University and
Mosher have refused to release it,

claiming that to do so would risk the
lives of innocent individuals.
Mosher has also said that by
releasing the report he could
jeopardize a possible lawsuit against
the University.
He was expelled last February on
an 11-0 vote by members of the
Stanford Anthropology Department.
The department faculty accepted an
investigative committee recommen
dation that said Mosher was guilty of
"illegal and seriously unethical con
duct" while in China.
Mosher appealed his case in April
to Norman Wessells, dean of
Humanities and Sciences, and then
took the case to Lieberman in july
after Wessells denied Mosher's first
grievance.
In a letter mailed to Mosher in
September, Lieberman denied Mos
her's second appeal. He said the ter
mination was "irrelevant" to Mos
her's "writings on abortion and in
fanticide in China."
