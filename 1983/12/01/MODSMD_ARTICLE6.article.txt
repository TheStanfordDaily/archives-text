# Study shows major, class size affect grades

The average grade at Stanford is a 3.4 — just
above a B+ and nearly halfway between
"superior" and "exceptional" on the Univer
sity's grade guidelines.
Are students here really that good or do
they suffer — so to speak — from grade infla
tion?
A recent University curriculum study
skirted that question but pointed to many fac
tors — ranging from individual student moti
vation and course material to class size and
grading procedures — that contribute to high
grades at Stanford.
Although there has been a gradual declin
ing trend in recent years, with the numbers of
A's decreasing and the numbers of B's and C's
increasing since 1978, grades have remained
relatively stable here, the study says.
The study finds, however, that there is con
siderable variation in grading standards
within different schools. The highest grades
received are in the humanities, with half of all
grades reported as A's. Grades were lowest in
the School of Engineering — lower than in the

humanities by about .30 on a 4.0 scale.
In general, students in (lasses with higher
technical content receive lower grades, accor
ding to the study. Even in economics and his
tory, the most "technical" classes in their
respective divisions of c >cial sciences and
humanities, students received lower grades
than in less-technical classes within the same
division.
The study found that natural science majors
as a group had higher grade point averages
than students in any other major division. Ac
cording to the study, "the pre-med
syndrome" — natural science students'
strong desire for good grades to get into
medical school — may be partially respon
sible.
Phillip Hanawalt, the chairman of the De
partment of Biological Sciences, agreed.
"I would not say that basically brighter stu
dents enter the natural sciences. As a group,
pre-med students are more aggressive and
just simply grade conscious. I am very con
cerned about pre-med students seeing their
classes as learning experiences, rather than as
a means to an end," he said.
Given the finding that grades in all divisions

are better in smaller classes, and the fact that
humanities has the largest number of stu
dents in smaller classes, the question arises as
to whether there is really any difference in
grading beyond class size.
The study shows virtually no difference in
grading among divisions, when adjusted for
class size.
According to Herant Katchadourian, vice
provost for undergraduate education, grading
has remained fairly stable.
"Grading has not gone globally up or
down. Maybe it is a little tighter, but maybe it
was too loose in the last decade. Engineering
students may realize that smaller classes yield
higher grades and pick them, but it is reassur
ing to know that larger classes are often
popular classes and not necessarily re
quired," he said.
Katchadourian said that in smaller classes
the teacher often gets to know students bet
ter and "doesn't have the heart" to give bad
grades.
Will the School of Engineering do anything
about class size affecting grades? According
to Associate Dean of Engineering Gil Masters,
the answer is no.

"I don't see the School of Engineering
easing grading in any way. We're not even
looking at it unless students get more vocal.
Grading is a non-iSsue as far as I'm con
cerned," he said.
According to Carolyn Lougee, associate
dean of humanities and sciences, higher
grades in the humanities are largely the result
of the types of exams given."Humanities ex
ams are targeted toward comprehension in a
larger framework on a more abstract basis
than exams in the sciences," she said.
Lougee also said that stronger students may
take smaller classes, and perhaps learn better
in them. "Grades are not necessarily depen
dent upon the professors," she said.
Lougee said she does not feel that the
grading differences between the humanities
and engineering schools are unfair. "It's not
an overwhelming difference. If students had
3.5 averages in the humanities and 1.5
averages in engineering, I'd be upset, " she
said.
According to Lougee, the grading issue is
"just now" being brought up before the
Committee on Academic Achievement, and it
