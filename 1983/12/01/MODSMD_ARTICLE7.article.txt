Reagan vetoes aid limitation

Washington — President Reagan, overruling
recommendations from the State Department,
vetoed a bill yesterday that would have required him
to continue certifying progress on human rights in El
Salvador as a condition for U.S. military aid.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the
president's decision to let the bill die with a "pocket
veto" while Congress is out of session "reflects the
administration's policy that such requirements dis
tort our efforts to improve human rights, democracy
and (economic) recovery in El Salvador."
Speakes said the administration was "firmly com
mitted" to economic and social reforms in El Sal
vador but added that the bill, which required the

president to report progress in those areas every six
months, "would not serve to support these en
deavors."
Democrats in Congress reacted angrily, charging
that the veto signaled a retreat from U.S. pressure
on the Salvadoran government to crack down on
rightist "death squads," which American officials
say have links to El Salvador's security forces.
"The president's ill-advised veto sends a signiti
cant and dangerous message ... (that) U.S. military
aid will continue regardless of human rights
abuses," Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), a spon
sor of the bill, said.
U.S. Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Md.) chairman of the
House subcommittee on Latin America, called the
veto "just incredible" and said, "How can this be in
terpreted as anything other than a retreat from our
government's already lukewarm support for human

rights, land reform and dialogue in El Salvador?"
Congressional aides said the certification require
ment, which had been in effect for two years and
expired Sept. 30, probably will be reintroduced
when Congress returns to work Jan. 23. The House
and Senate passed the bill to extend the law by
unanimous voice votes; under a "pocket veto" the
president can let a bill die by not signing it within 10
days of its passage while Congress is out of session.
Fighting continues in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — Heavy shelling closed Beirut's
airport yesterday and artillery duels in the northern
port city of Tripoli shattered a nine-day cease-fire in
the war between rival factions of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
The airport was closed after six shells, apparently
fired by Druze militiamen in the nearby Shouf

mountains, hit near the northern part of the runway
as a Hungarian airliner was on final approach. The
plane landed safely but the airport was immediately
ordered shut down.
Negotiations began between government officials
and the country's warring factions in an effort to
gain general approval for the reopening of the
facility. A spokesman for Middle East Airlines,
Lebanon's national carrier, said some flights were
diverted to Cyprus, about 130 miles away.
The shelling was a continuation of artillery battles
between Syrian-backed Druze, members of an off
shoot sect of Islam, and the Lebanese army in the
mountains above Beirut. The fighting spilled over
Tuesday into Christian-dominated East Beirut and,
as a result, schools in the Christian sector were
closed yesterday.
The Druze said the firing on neighborhoods was
in retaliation for the shelling of their villages in the

Shouf.
The U.S. Marine encampment here is
situated at the airport but no American
troops were injured in yesterday's shelling.
Maj. Dennis Brooks, a Marine spokesman,
also said that the shells, which fell about 600
yards from the American positions, caused
no serious damage.
Murderer Sullivan electrocuted
Starke, Ha. — Robert Sullivan, a convicted
murderer who spent 10 years on death row,
was executed in Florida's electric chair yes
terday after reciting a Psalm in tears and
thanking Pope john Paul II for trying to save
his life.
Sullivan, 36, his blue eyes watering, sat
down in the oaken death chair, took a
microphone and read in a clear voice from
the 62nd Psalm written on a legal pad: "And
in Cod alone is my soul at rest, because my
hope comes from within."
A black hood was placed over his head and

the executioner, also wearing a black hood,
threw a switch sending 2000 volts of
electricity through Sullivan's body for two
minutes.
Sullivan twitched, then was still. He was
pronounced dead at 10:16 a.m., six minutes
after Bob Graham gave the go-ahead for the
execution, ending a week of frantic legal
maneuvering that reached the U.S. Supreme
Court and won the condemned man a brief
stay.
Florida thus became the first state to have
executed two people since the Supreme
Court reinstated the death penalty seven
years ago. Eight other Americans, all men,
have been executed since the landmark deci
sion.
Feldstein under pressure
Washington — Martin Feldstein came un
der heavy pressure yesterday either to stop
publicly disagreeing with parts of President
Reagan's economic program or to resign as
Reagan's chief economic advisor.
Excoriated privately by White House offi
cials and admonished publicly by White
House spokesman Larry Speakes, Feldstein
insisted that there must be some confusion

about his comments on the president's pro
gram, which he said he supported complete
ly.
Stock prices drop
New York — Stock prices slumped in heavy
trading yesterday and the Dow Jones indus
trial average pulled back from its record
high.
The market tried to extend its rally at mid
session, and at one point the Dow Jones in
dustrials were up more than four
points — and above 1290.
But the blue-chip measure then steadily
drifted lower and the overall market, whose
early advance was not broadly based, fol
lowed suit.
