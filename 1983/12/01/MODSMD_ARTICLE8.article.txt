## Florence Moore: the mystery house Bug Me 
### 
It's time once again for the
staff down here at Bug Me to
track down and destroy the
clever, interesting myths
about this Emerald City we call
Stanford. This week we intend
to prove that everything you
know about Flo Mo is wrong!
Why does Flo Mo Food Service
serve ice cream with every din
ner?

Actually the practice of of
fering ice cream only nightly at
Florence Moore is a relatively
recent tradition. Until a
budget cutback last year, ice
cream was served with an al
most religious fervor, break
fast, lunch and dinner, seven
days a week year-round since
Flo Mo opened in 1957. Con
sidering the fact that Flo Mo
was originally an all-female
undergraduate dormitory, it
seems likely that this is the
original source of the
"freshman fifteen" phenome
non.
But back to the subject.
Why do they do it? What
drives the menu-planners to
provide huge vats of high

calorie frozen goop with every
meal?! The popular explana
tion is so romantic it brings a
tear to the eye as you slug
down a bowl or two of the
stuff. The myth goes like this:
In the will of the late Univer
sity philanthropist Florence
Moore is a last request that
her favorite food be served
with each and every meal

prepared in the dorms built
with the help of her funding.
Now for the real story. Most
of you have read about or
seen the amazing high-tech
gadgetry and mod design ele
ments that pack the new dorm
complex known as "Gov's."
According to Karen Brower, an
office assistant at Flo Mo, the
ice cream tradition began in
1957 to showcase one of the
amazing new features of the
state-of-the-art Florence
Moore facility, namely, a pair
of freezer tubs built right into
the food line! Imagine that.
Why does Flo Mo look like it
was built on stilts?
