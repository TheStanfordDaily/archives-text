# Faculty opposes Hoover-run policy center
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
In an unanimous vote, the Faculty Senate
said yesterday that if a public affairs center
is to be part of a Reagan presidential com
plex here, it should be governed by the
University rather than the Hoover Institu
tion.
Any center should be "part of our normal
academic and administrative structure —
part of the University as a whole — rather
than an extension of the Hoover Institu
tion," the senate said, endorsing a state
ment made by University President Donald
Kennedy last month.
The overwhelming show of support for
the University position on the issue serves
to emphasize that Stanford and the White
House remain at loggerheads with only 11
days to go before the Board of Trustees
meets to consider the proposed complex.
While in agreement over plans to house a
Reagan library and museum here, the two
sides disagree strongly over governance of
the proposed public affairs center.

The most recent statement from the
White House, a Nov. 4 letter from Presiden
tial Counsellor Edwin Meese, warned that
Stanford's ruling out of a Hoover-run cen
ter was "tantamount to making the presi
dent 'an offer he cannot accept.' "
Kennedy and Board of Trustees President
William Kimball revealed yesterday that
they would like to try to hammer out those
differences in a meeting with Meese in the
White House before the Dec. 13 Board
meeting.
"We're going with what we hope will be
an acceptable proposal," Kimball told the
Stanford News Service. Kimball said he has
spoken with Meese's appointments secre
tary but thus far has not heard from Meese.
Kennedy told reporters after the senate
meeting that the University prefers to
negotiate "in person rather than in the
mail."
"I think our position is well-known,"
Kennedy told reporters after the meeting.
"There's no reason to change it." But he
refused to rule out the possibility that the

University might chai <;e its position,
saying, "It's a poor way t go into a meeting
to set out in advance wh.it we're not going
to do."
"We'll explain a lot, lr ten a lot and see
how much flexibility thee is there," Ken
nedy said.
Later, at an evening forum in the Branner
Hall lounge , Kennedy said ' Ihe first thing
you do is to see if then s any room (for
negotiation). You may wind up just having a
cup of coffee, but you've to sit down —
that's first."
Before the Faculty Senate vote, Senate
Chair Craig Heller, a professor of biological
sciences, said the Steering Committee felt
the senate "should make a very effective
statement to the Board of Trustees on
something we feel is of paramount impor
tance, namely governance.
Only Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy defended at length the Hoover
Institution's right to govern the public af
fairs center. Saying that the controversy is
"being perceived outside Stanford as

having a substantial academic freedom
component," McCarthy said the issue of
governance "can't be separated from the
environment of the campaign" against the
Hoover Institution last spring.
McCarthy, whose motion to table discus
sion of governance of the center failed for
lack of a second, had left the meeting by
the time the final vote was taken.
During the 90 minutes of debate, no rep
resentatives questioned either the library or
museum components of the complex,
which would cost an estimated $65 million
rivate gifts and require five to 10 acres
of land.
Many senators did question, however,
whether the University should have a
public off irs center at all.
A proposal to underline the word "if" in
a phrase in the resolution saying, "If there
is to be a Reagan public affairs center. . . "
was debated at length until William Chace,
an associate dean of humanities and
sciences and an English professor,

reminded his colleagues that " 'if' me.ins
'if'."
The senate is scheduled to discuss fur
ther the desirability of having any policy
center linked to the presidential library
complex at a special meeting scheduled for
Dec. 8.
At the Branner Hall forum — the tirst time
Kennedy has publicly discussed the Reagan
library complex — the president spent 90
minutes discussing the issue and answering
questions from the audience and members
of a three-person panel.
Kennedy told them that to create a spe
cial governance process for the public af
fairs center "that bypasses mechanisms that
have served academic institutions like ours
well is probably a mistake."
Kennedy said that even faced with the
prospect of no Reagan complex coming to
Stanford at all, he would not change his
view that the center should not be run by
the Hoover Institution. "My personal
view." he said, "is that the issue of academ-
ic governance is very important and
would determine the acceptability
of the whole complex."
Kennedy said, however, "There is
a legitimate complaint from Hoover
about some of the assertions that

have been made about the political
character of their activities. . .
"I tend to take a rather permissive
view about the level of political' ac
tivity that can be taken by a particu
lar academic department. So when I
hear Hoover criticized for taking a
particular political stance, that
worries me a little bit."

It was reported in yesterday's edi

would be shared with the History of
Science Program and would not em
phasize science any more or less
than is presently the case.

have served academic institutions like ours
well is probably a mistake."
Kennedy said that even faced with the
prospect of no Reagan complex coming to
Stanford at all, he would not change his
view that the center should not be run by
the Hoover Institution. "My personal
view." he said, "is that the issue of academ-
ic governance is very important and
would determine the acceptability
of the whole complex."
Kennedy said, however, "There is
a legitimate complaint from Hoover
about some of the assertions that

have been made about the political
character of their activities. . .
"I tend to take a rather permissive
view about the level of political' ac
tivity that can be taken by a particu
lar academic department. So when I
hear Hoover criticized for taking a
particular political stance, that
worries me a little bit."

It was reported in yesterday's edi
tion of The Daily that the Philosophy
Department is submitting a proposal
for a new Western Culture track
which would be shared with the His
tory Department and emphasize sci
ence. In fact, the track as proposed
by the Philosophy Department
would be shared with the History of
Science Program and would not em
phasize science any more or less
than is presently the case.
In an unanimous vote, the Faculty Senate
said yesterday that if a public affairs center
is to be part of a Reagan presidential com
plex here, it should be governed by the
University rather than the Hoover Institu
tion.
Any center should be "part of our normal
academic and administrative structure —
part of the University as a whole — rather
than an extension of the Hoover Institu
tion," the senate said, endorsing a state
ment made by University President Donald
Kennedy last month.
The overwhelming show of support for
the University position on the issue serves
to emphasize that Stanford and the White
House remain at loggerheads with only 11
days to go before the Board of Trustees
meets to consider the proposed complex.
While in agreement over plans to house a
Reagan library and museum here, the two
sides disagree strongly over governance of
the proposed public affairs center.

The most recent statement from the
White House, a Nov. 4 letter from Presiden
tial Counsellor Edwin Meese, warned that
Stanford's ruling out of a Hoover-run cen
ter was "tantamount to making the presi
dent 'an offer he cannot accept.' "
Kennedy and Board of Trustees President
William Kimball revealed yesterday that
they would like to try to hammer out those
differences in a meeting with Meese in the
White House before the Dec. 13 Board
meeting.
"We're going with what we hope will be
an acceptable proposal," Kimball told the
Stanford News Service. Kimball said he has
spoken with Meese's appointments secre
tary but thus far has not heard from Meese.
Kennedy told reporters after the senate
meeting that the University prefers to
negotiate "in person rather than in the
mail."
"I think our position is well-known,"
Kennedy told reporters after the meeting.
"There's no reason to change it." But he
refused to rule out the possibility that the

University might chai <;e its position,
saying, "It's a poor way t go into a meeting
to set out in advance wh.it we're not going
to do."
"We'll explain a lot, lr ten a lot and see
how much flexibility thee is there," Ken
nedy said.
Later, at an evening forum in the Branner
Hall lounge , Kennedy said ' Ihe first thing
you do is to see if then s any room (for
negotiation). You may wind up just having a
cup of coffee, but you've to sit down —
that's first."
Before the Faculty Senate vote, Senate
Chair Craig Heller, a professor of biological
sciences, said the Steering Committee felt
the senate "should make a very effective
statement to the Board of Trustees on
something we feel is of paramount impor
tance, namely governance.
Only Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy defended at length the Hoover
Institution's right to govern the public af
fairs center. Saying that the controversy is
"being perceived outside Stanford as

having a substantial academic freedom
component," McCarthy said the issue of
governance "can't be separated from the
environment of the campaign" against the
Hoover Institution last spring.
McCarthy, whose motion to table discus
sion of governance of the center failed for
lack of a second, had left the meeting by
the time the final vote was taken.
During the 90 minutes of debate, no rep
resentatives questioned either the library or
museum components of the complex,
which would cost an estimated $65 million
rivate gifts and require five to 10 acres
of land.
Many senators did question, however,
whether the University should have a
public off irs center at all.
A proposal to underline the word "if" in
a phrase in the resolution saying, "If there
is to be a Reagan public affairs center. . . "
was debated at length until William Chace,
an associate dean of humanities and
sciences and an English professor,

reminded his colleagues that " 'if' me.ins
'if'."
The senate is scheduled to discuss fur
ther the desirability of having any policy
center linked to the presidential library
complex at a special meeting scheduled for
Dec. 8.
At the Branner Hall forum — the tirst time
Kennedy has publicly discussed the Reagan
library complex — the president spent 90
minutes discussing the issue and answering
questions from the audience and members
of a three-person panel.
Kennedy told them that to create a spe
cial governance process for the public af
fairs center "that bypasses mechanisms that
have served academic institutions like ours
