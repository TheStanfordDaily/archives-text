Come 1984, phone bills are going to be dif
ferent.
If Pacific Telephone company executives are
telling the truth, those who make many long
distance calls will be putting out less money for
the next best thing to being there, while those
who talk mainly short-range may be dialing for
more dollars. Perhaps some students will just
hang it up and turn in their phones.
That's why administrators here should con
sider including students in the planned
revamping of the University phone system. But
not every student — that is unnecessary and
would create too cumbersome a network.
The best solution is to make each house
phone part of the University system. Then, stu
dents who make primarily local calls and who
find it financially difficult — or just simply
ridiculous — to own a phone after the Ameri
can Telephone and Telegraph breakup can just
jog down the hall to reach out and touch
friends in other residences.
If the University makes a smart (and ex
pected) decision to install push-button phones
in the new system, there will be another advan

tage for many students: the ability to use spe
cial long distance services such as Sprint and
MCI. Those who don't mind a little less privacy
and the possibility of waiting a few minutes to
make a call can combat the new complications
and probable higher prices of the divested
telephone web.
University officials have said that the newly
proposed system — for which more than $12
million is expected to be approved by the
Board of Trustees at this month's meeting —
may be extended to include students if service
can be provided at a reduced cost. The house
phone solution, which doesn't go overboard
but does provide an alternative, is the right
thing to do at least for the time being.
The current intra-University communication
setup is embarrassing: The phones look an
cient, the service is simplistic and transferring
people back to the operator without cutting
them off is next to impossible. As for adminis
trators' decision to ask the Board of Trustees
for a new phone system, we can only say, "It's
about time. We've been on hold long
enough."
