## Football should not be a way of life 
### 
This isn't just another intellectual critique of
tootball. Win or lose, Stanford football is excit
ing to watch, and some of the best minds in the
rnnntrv go out to see it every Saturday. Some of
the best minds in the country play tor Stanford.
This is a critique of the emphasis we place on
tootball at Stanford compared to other sports,
activities and purposes of the University. Unlike
other University-supported events, Stanford
football has had such a strong emotional appeal
and such a long tradition that few question whe
ther the emphasis on this activity and all of the
events, organizations and attitudes supporting
it, are really consistent with the values of a great
university in the 1980s.
While Stanford makes a great claim, for exam
ple, to favor individual initiative, to promote in
tellectual activities and to reduce student use
of alcohol, its devotion to football and the
events associated with it, make these claims
seem like mere platitudes.
Witness for example how the Office of Resi
dential Eucation structures events around foot
ball games throughout the fall quarter, and how
the University immediately tries to sell season
tickets to every incoming freshman and return
ing enrollee. How many alternate events does
the University even think of scheduling on
weekends when there is a football game? How
easy is it for a newcomer to the University who
is trying to fit in, to choose to do something else
other than spending fall quarter weekends at
football games and related activities? The first
message is that the officially sanctioned
weekend activity is Stanford football.
The second message is that is should take up
one's entire weekend, because rallies, Band
performances, Gaieties and trips to away

games start to stretch back to Thursdays and
Fridays and ahead into Sundays.
What happens is that newcomers to Stanford
learn in their first few weekends that weekends
are not to be used productively. Weekends are
to gear up for and then to watch football games.
It's very hard not to go to Big Came, for exam
ple, even if it is late in the quarter and one
ought to be studying. After all it is Big Came. By
winter quarter, it is an accepted belief that noth
ing productive is to happen on weekends.
Despite the University's supposed interest in
de-emphasizing alcohol, all of the hoopla
around the football games actually reinforces a
Stanford tradition of drinking. Where else do
alumni and their kids celebrate Stanford foot
ball but at tailgaters before the game? What Sat
urday would be complete without a post-game
party?
There are other contradictions in Stanford's
support for football as well.
Stanford has, for example, a strong interest in
physical fitness. Through residential activities
and various support groups on campus, *-also
shows great concern for individual well-being.
Yet, at the same time it encourages a sport in
which a majority of its participants will inevitab
ly suffer at least one debilitating and unneces
sary injury during their college years.
Stanford players know this — it was one of
the risks they recognized when they chose to
play college football — and maybe it is worth
the excitement of playing, the friendships
formed, the scholarships earned and, for a few,
the chance for a Stanford education that they
might not otherwise have had. Still, should
Stanford promote an activity which will cripple
most of its participants 20 years from now with

worn knees or back ailments, and shorten the
lives of others with clogged arteries or excess
weight due to unhealthy diets designed just to
add bulk?
Stanford is committed to diversity and im
proved understanding between people of dif
ferent backgrounds and interests, through their
interaction. Yet football players arrive early and
spend a great deal of time together over meals
and practices, more isolated from the student
body than any other group.
This is not a veiled plea for the elimination of
Stanford football. People need a release. They
need time to act crazy and to release tension.
Athletics is a good thing, and mass human expe
riences can be also. Football brings prestige to
Stanford from people who, unfortunately,
might not recognize its excellence in other
areas. Big Came is also a great thing because it
signifies that we live in a society that can
produce a public university to rival perhaps its
best private institutions. Finally, football is
reputed fo-be, though it may be out of circum
stance only and need not always be, the best
magnet for donations to the University.
This is a plea to put football back in perspec
tive within the context of a great university in a
modern age.
Limiting the hoopla to one night of the
weekend — Friday, for example — would leave
people free to make more productive use of the
rest of their weekend.
Res.Ed. should encourage people to choose
other forms of entertainment bv de
emphasizing tie-ins to football games and by
slowly offering competing activities.

and practices, more isolated from the student
body than any other group.
This is not a veiled plea for the elimination of
Stanford football. People need a release. They
need time to act crazy and to release tension.
Athletics is a good thing, and mass human expe
riences can be also. Football brings prestige to
Stanford from people who, unfortunately,
might not recognize its excellence in other
areas. Big Came is also a great thing because it
signifies that we live in a society that can
produce a public university to rival perhaps its
best private institutions. Finally, football is
reputed fo-be, though it may be out of circum
stance only and need not always be, the best
magnet for donations to the University.
This is a plea to put football back in perspec
tive within the context of a great university in a
modern age.
Limiting the hoopla to one night of the
weekend — Friday, for example — would leave
people free to make more productive use of the
rest of their weekend.
Res.Ed. should encourage people to choose
other forms of entertainment bv de
emphasizing tie-ins to football games and by
slowly offering competing activities.

This isn't just another intellectual critique of
tootball. Win or lose, Stanford football is excit
ing to watch, and some of the best minds in the
rnnntrv go out to see it every Saturday. Some of
the best minds in the country play tor Stanford.
This is a critique of the emphasis we place on
tootball at Stanford compared to other sports,
activities and purposes of the University. Unlike
other University-supported events, Stanford
football has had such a strong emotional appeal
and such a long tradition that few question whe
ther the emphasis on this activity and all of the
events, organizations and attitudes supporting
it, are really consistent with the values of a great
university in the 1980s.
While Stanford makes a great claim, for exam
ple, to favor individual initiative, to promote in
tellectual activities and to reduce student use
of alcohol, its devotion to football and the
events associated with it, make these claims
seem like mere platitudes.
Witness for example how the Office of Resi
dential Eucation structures events around foot
ball games throughout the fall quarter, and how
the University immediately tries to sell season
tickets to every incoming freshman and return
ing enrollee. How many alternate events does
the University even think of scheduling on
weekends when there is a football game? How
easy is it for a newcomer to the University who
is trying to fit in, to choose to do something else
other than spending fall quarter weekends at
football games and related activities? The first
message is that the officially sanctioned
weekend activity is Stanford football.
The second message is that is should take up
one's entire weekend, because rallies, Band
performances, Gaieties and trips to away

games start to stretch back to Thursdays and
Fridays and ahead into Sundays.
What happens is that newcomers to Stanford
learn in their first few weekends that weekends
are not to be used productively. Weekends are
to gear up for and then to watch football games.
It's very hard not to go to Big Came, for exam
ple, even if it is late in the quarter and one
ought to be studying. After all it is Big Came. By
winter quarter, it is an accepted belief that noth
ing productive is to happen on weekends.
Despite the University's supposed interest in
de-emphasizing alcohol, all of the hoopla
around the football games actually reinforces a
Stanford tradition of drinking. Where else do
alumni and their kids celebrate Stanford foot
ball but at tailgaters before the game? What Sat
urday would be complete without a post-game
party?
There are other contradictions in Stanford's
support for football as well.
Stanford has, for example, a strong interest in
physical fitness. Through residential activities
and various support groups on campus, *-also
shows great concern for individual well-being.
Yet, at the same time it encourages a sport in
which a majority of its participants will inevitab
ly suffer at least one debilitating and unneces
sary injury during their college years.
Stanford players know this — it was one of
the risks they recognized when they chose to
play college football — and maybe it is worth
the excitement of playing, the friendships
formed, the scholarships earned and, for a few,
the chance for a Stanford education that they
might not otherwise have had. Still, should
Stanford promote an activity which will cripple
most of its participants 20 years from now with

worn knees or back ailments, and shorten the
lives of others with clogged arteries or excess
weight due to unhealthy diets designed just to
add bulk?
Stanford is committed to diversity and im
proved understanding between people of dif
ferent backgrounds and interests, through their
interaction. Yet football players arrive early and
spend a great deal of time together over meals
and practices, more isolated from the student
body than any other group.

Stanford football. People need a release. They
