# Foreign policy must consider values
## 
### 
Ours is a schizophrenic country.
So, too, is the outside world schizo
phrenic in its opinion of us. Admira
tion of our country as the "land of
the free" is widespread around the
world, even if not often admitted,
and our Constitution is a popular
model for those of other countries.
Our foreign policy, however, is
hated by most of the world, even by
many leaders in very friendly
countries, as is obvious in the furor
over the deployment of Pershing 2s.
Why "should this be so? Well, on
the domestic front, everyone is
aware of the importance of this
country's "ideals" such as civil
liberties, human rights,
"democracy" and so on. In fact, the
most fierce conflicts, other than
those relating to government
budgets, occur because of a conflict
between these rights. Thus the
abortion debate pits the rights of the
unborn against those of the mother,
and the debate over affirmative ac
tion pits different interpretations of
"equal opportunity" against each
other. But no one denies the value
of "equal opportunity" itself. So we
have a consensus of sorts, and
people can agree to disagree.
A different kind of consensus
rules our foreign policy. Here ideals
are nonexistent, and the false gods
of "security" and the "national in
terest" reign. Even bleeding-heart
liberals, from whom one would ex
pect better on such an issue, are of
ten heard to argue that the support
of democracies is good because it
provides us with stable allies, and is
therefore "in the national inter
est" - but democracy as an end in
itself, such as it is treated in domes
tic debates, is rarely mentioned.
Yet "security" should only be a
factor if it means protecting ideals
we hold dear, such as a system
guaranteeing various rights to its
citizens. If we violate others' human

rights in pursuit of our own, we con
tradict our ideals, and may rightly be
despised by the rest of the world.
Vet, of course, that is what we do.
In South Korea, in the Philippines,
we support very repressive govern
ments which in return lease us land
for major military installations. We
tacitly support apartheid in South
Africa because access to its mineral
wealth is, we believe, in the
"national interest."
We also support repressive
regimes in Guatemala, El Salvador,
Chile, Indonesia, Bangladesh,
Somalia, Malawi and so on and so
on. All of this is justified by the
"national interest" or "security con
cerns."
Of course, we don't have a
monopoly on the support of repres
sion, and unlike a certain other su
perpower, we also support non
repressive regimes. In fact, this
other country's supposed ideals are
a bad joke, unhesitatingly violated
both domestically and abroad. Yet,
we should be doing a lot better,
even though we are at least doing a
good job at home.
What should we do? For starters,
we shouldn't go around invading
countries to "restore democracy,"
as such a policy is doomed to incon
sistency if not hypocrisy. We can,
however, make it clear that this
country takes our professed ideals
seriously, for a change. Instead of
"human rights" and "democracy"
being an afterthought in our foreign
policy, we can tell other countries
that in order to be our friend or ally
they must make these ideals truly
important to them. After all, nobody
is forcing these governments to be
repressive, and we aren't asking for
perfection — something we don't
achieve ourselves.
At the very least, we can start cor
recting the current imbalance where
countries with excellent track

records such as Costa Rica and
Senegal receive far less aid than
their repressive neighbors. As it
stands now, we reward dictatorships
with aid and even tend to vastly in
crease our financial support of a
country after a military takeover (as
in Turkey or Greece). This is
ridiculous.
Do all of these actions constitute
interference in other countries'
domestic politics? Sure. So what?
These countries can always choose
to ignore us and simply do without
our aid — we shouldn't be forced to
help countries who regimes we find
offensive.
Will this hurt our much-vaunted
"national security?" In the short
run, yes. In the medium to long
term, however, we will be rewarded

with many new friends and allies on
whose stability we may rely, and
with whom we will maintain a funda
mental commonality of interest.
Some examples of budding
democracies are Portugal and Spain,
and there can easily be many, many
more around the world.
In any case, it's obvious the
security-based policies carried out
so far have left us running around in
circles and have earned us lots of
enemies — a more fundamental ap
proach is sorely needed. Not only
that, but only a firm and fair foreign
policy based on our country's ideals
can gain us the full respect and ad
miration of the world.

"equal opportunity" against each
other. But no one denies the value
of "equal opportunity" itself. So we
have a consensus of sorts, and
people can agree to disagree.
A different kind of consensus
rules our foreign policy. Here ideals
are nonexistent, and the false gods
of "security" and the "national in
terest" reign. Even bleeding-heart
liberals, from whom one would ex
pect better on such an issue, are of
ten heard to argue that the support
of democracies is good because it
provides us with stable allies, and is
therefore "in the national inter
est" - but democracy as an end in
itself, such as it is treated in domes
tic debates, is rarely mentioned.
Yet "security" should only be a
factor if it means protecting ideals
we hold dear, such as a system
guaranteeing various rights to its
citizens. If we violate others' human

rights in pursuit of our own, we con
tradict our ideals, and may rightly be
despised by the rest of the world.
Vet, of course, that is what we do.
In South Korea, in the Philippines,
we support very repressive govern
ments which in return lease us land
for major military installations. We
tacitly support apartheid in South
Africa because access to its mineral
wealth is, we believe, in the
"national interest."
We also support repressive
regimes in Guatemala, El Salvador,
Chile, Indonesia, Bangladesh,
Somalia, Malawi and so on and so
on. All of this is justified by the
"national interest" or "security con
cerns."
Of course, we don't have a
monopoly on the support of repres
sion, and unlike a certain other su
perpower, we also support non
repressive regimes. In fact, this
other country's supposed ideals are
a bad joke, unhesitatingly violated
both domestically and abroad. Yet,
we should be doing a lot better,
even though we are at least doing a
good job at home.
What should we do? For starters,
we shouldn't go around invading
countries to "restore democracy,"
as such a policy is doomed to incon
sistency if not hypocrisy. We can,
however, make it clear that this
country takes our professed ideals
seriously, for a change. Instead of
"human rights" and "democracy"
being an afterthought in our foreign
policy, we can tell other countries
that in order to be our friend or ally
they must make these ideals truly
important to them. After all, nobody
is forcing these governments to be
repressive, and we aren't asking for
perfection — something we don't
achieve ourselves.
At the very least, we can start cor
recting the current imbalance where
countries with excellent track

records such as Costa Rica and
Senegal receive far less aid than
their repressive neighbors. As it
stands now, we reward dictatorships
with aid and even tend to vastly in
crease our financial support of a
country after a military takeover (as
in Turkey or Greece). This is
ridiculous.
Do all of these actions constitute
interference in other countries'
domestic politics? Sure. So what?
These countries can always choose
to ignore us and simply do without
our aid — we shouldn't be forced to
help countries who regimes we find
offensive.
Will this hurt our much-vaunted
"national security?" In the short
run, yes. In the medium to long
term, however, we will be rewarded

with many new friends and allies on
whose stability we may rely, and
with whom we will maintain a funda
mental commonality of interest.
Some examples of budding
democracies are Portugal and Spain,
and there can easily be many, many
more around the world.
In any case, it's obvious the
security-based policies carried out
so far have left us running around in
circles and have earned us lots of
enemies — a more fundamental ap
proach is sorely needed. Not only
that, but only a firm and fair foreign
policy based on our country's ideals
can gain us the full respect and ad
miration of the world.

Ours is a schizophrenic country.
So, too, is the outside world schizo
phrenic in its opinion of us. Admira
tion of our country as the "land of
the free" is widespread around the
world, even if not often admitted,
and our Constitution is a popular
model for those of other countries.
Our foreign policy, however, is
hated by most of the world, even by
many leaders in very friendly
countries, as is obvious in the furor
over the deployment of Pershing 2s.
Why "should this be so? Well, on
the domestic front, everyone is
aware of the importance of this
country's "ideals" such as civil
liberties, human rights,
"democracy" and so on. In fact, the
most fierce conflicts, other than
those relating to government
budgets, occur because of a conflict
between these rights. Thus the
abortion debate pits the rights of the
unborn against those of the mother,
and the debate over affirmative ac
tion pits different interpretations of
"equal opportunity" against each
other. But no one denies the value
of "equal opportunity" itself. So we
have a consensus of sorts, and
people can agree to disagree.
