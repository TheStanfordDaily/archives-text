Women's rights...
"The failure of a movement/' by
Michael Henry Olvera (Daily, Nov.
22) attempts to persuade us that
had the women's movement been
"headed by a man, it would have
achieved much more." He does
this with a curious mixture of
audacity (telling women what they
should want) and ignorance
(judging the women's movement to
be nothing more than getting the
ERA passed).
Feminists learned through painful
experience that the social changes
they seek will not simply happen in
direct consequence of male
recognition of existing inequality.
That has been adequately demon
strated, although one could argue
that since most males still haven't
recognized that there is a problem,
the experiment is not complete.
If women ever gain access to
determining their own destiny,
then the experiment to determine
whether they will make a significant
improvement can be done. If the
condition of the world today is a
statement of what the male men
tality produces, it seems highly
unlikely that women could do
worse. But with friends who offer
"advice" like that of Olvera, wo
men don't need enemies. It is an
embarrassment to be classified in
the same gender as those who
represent us as he does.

. . . whose failure?
In Michael Henry Olvera's
column "The failure of a move
ment" (Daily, Nov. 22), he bases his
argument on the assumption that
the women's movement is "about
equal rights." According to that
definition he judges it as a failure.
As women involved in the women's
movement, we object to his article
on the basis that his definition is an
oversimplification of the move
ment's aims. Equal legislation is
only one of our goals. True equality
also involves changing attitudes
which are the cause of women's
oppression in "real life."
For example, he writes, "By mere
interaction, the Stanford student
soon realizes that talent and intelli
gence know no gender." Olvera
misses the important distinction
that simply acknowledging a per
son's intelligence is not the same as
treating him/her as an equal.
He also states that there is no
women's movement on campus. By
saying this he ignores the men and
women on campus who are actively
working in organizations such as
SURE, the Women's Center,
CROW, REP and the Feminist
Studies program to name a few.
Further, his analogy of the move

ment to a novel is insulting. He says
the "reader" of the feminist
"novel" "knows that what the
writer is trying to express is
meaningful, but the problems of
the novel distance the reader and
cause him (sic) to either ignore or
criticize the writer." The purpose of
the women's movement is to ed
ucate, not to entertain the reader. A
novel is fiction, the women's move
ment is real life. By including this
trivializing analogy, he clearly
demonstrates that he does not take
the women's movement seriously.
It is upsetting to us that a move
ment so important is analyzed and
condemned on such a superficial
level. Because of a lack of under
standing of the women's move
ment, Olvera considers himself in a
position to judge it as a failure. We
strongly suggest that Olvera re
search the broad statements on
which his argument is based before
undertaking an editorial on such a
serious subject.

Social change
Two events came together last
week: the anniversary of the assas
sination of President John F. Ken
nedy, and the showing of "The Day
After," depicting the effects of a
nuclear war. They bring home the
senseless violence we suffer from
and perhaps a sense of despair.
Nothing is so difficult to
change — but so important to
change. We feel helpless to change
the state of the world, but there are
things that can be done.
These can include civil dis
obedience, to demonstrate to civil
authorities that we have limits to
what we will do for the state, accor
ding to our conscience. We can be
tax resisters, to withdraw our sup
port from funding the insane arms
race. We can write our representa
tives in Sacramento and Washing
ton — we can run for those offices
and support others of our view who
seek public office. We can join
together with others in social
change organizations. We can
support the clergy who stand up for
peace and genuine brotherhood
and sisterhood of a . mankind. We
can work to end violence.
Whether you have only the time
to volunteer for one evening a
week to visit a senior center, or act
as an intern for a battered women's
shelter or staff a local peace center,
look for what you can do to im
prove the world, and use the skills
you are developing at Stanford, to
improve the quality of life.
