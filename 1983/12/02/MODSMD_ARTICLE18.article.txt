Disguises. Sometimes a reporter like this one needs to
disguise herself to get a big story. Sometimes reporters have
to go in disguise. Incognito. Undercover. The Daily is going
undercover in the biggest way possible for a few days.
Because of Dead Week, the Daily will be incognito, so to
speak, until Wednesday, when the paper will come out of
hiding for a day before going back undercover until January.
That means if you want a Once Around the Quad announce
ment in the Dead Week issue you'll have to drop it off at the
Storke Building before Monday at 1 p.m. And for all you
reporters-in-hiding out there, it's safe to come out. All
agents should report to the Daily offices this week to pick up
new assignments.
