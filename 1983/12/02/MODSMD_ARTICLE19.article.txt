## Why Stanford can't get the big name speakers 
### MICHAEL GOFF 
What do James Watt,
Luciano Pavarotti, lames Mich
ener and the Democratic
presidential candidates have
in common?
They all speak at colleges
across the country — but not
here.
Some blame a lack of coor
dination for the dearth of
"big-name" speakers on
campus.
"There isn't even a Univer
sity calendar to let people
know what other groups are
doing," complained Katie
Wine of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau
does work to bring speakers

to campus, but it has a prob
lem: It has no money.
The bureau did not secure a
place on last year's fee assess
ment ballot because of a string
of technicalities At first the
organization failed to obtain
enough signatures on its peti
tion to assure a place on the
ballot.
However, the ASSU gave it
special dispensation because
of extenuating circumstances
and, for a while, it appeared
the bureau would earn a place
on the fee assessment ballot.
But when the bureau's staff
left a copy of its previous
vears' budget out of its fee as
sessment packet, the ASSU's
election commissioner

decided that the bureau had
simply made too many
mistakes to qualify for the bal
lot.
Wine said "a few small
mistakes" kept what Council
of-Presidents-member karol
Watson called the "most
popular" ASSU bureau from
getting a fee assessment.
The Stanford community is
now feeling the effects of this
loss.
With the budget of the
bureau down from about
$50,000 to $5000 this year, its
ability to attract top-name
speakers has been severely
limited.
The Wall Street Journal re
ported last month that the
University of Virginia is willing
to pay $8000 to have Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor speak there. That
amount is $3000 more than the
Speakers Bureau's budget for
the entire year."
The bureau is currently
working to attract speakers
who require no honorarium,
such as John Anderson, who
spoke here recently in turn for
only transportation and
lodging costs.
The Speakers Bureau is
working with the University to
create programs which would
involve speakers. One such
idea has been a debate on the
proposed Reagan library com
plex, but the plan has been
continually "getting punched
down," according to Wine.
The bureau has also been
actively trying to recruit
speakers with the little money
it has available.
Because the Guest Profes
sorship Bureau is currently
prohibited by the University to
set up actual guest professor
ships, it is also putting forth
some of its money to pay
speakers.
Yet another ASSU group,
the Lobby Office, is working
to bring to campus speakers
who could educate students in
the areas of public policy. The
Lobby Office is currently plan
ning a conference in April
titled "Participation: Public
Policy, Politics and Public Ser
vice." Invitations have been

sent out to eight presidential
candidates and other
speakers, including Tom
Hayden, Hoover Institution
fellows and Economics De
partment professors.
The Lobby Office
cooperates with other student
groups to combine funds to
pay for speakers. The office is
working to have state As
semblyman Byron Sher speak
here on January 20th on issues
including financial aid, the use
of animals in research and
other areas of student con
cern. The lobby group is also
working with the President's
Office, the Business School,
the Law School and the Medi
cal School to present a pro
gram titled "You Can Make a
Difference: Entrepreneurs in
Public Service."
Other groups are also trying
to attract speakers who re

quire no honorarium and
Stanford alumni passing
through campus who have
something to offer to the com
munity.
In January, Obie and Tony
winner David Henry Hwang, a
25-year-old Stanford graduate
and playwright, will speak
here.
This plethora of organiza
tions within the ASSU all
working independently on the
same problem can lead to
breakdowns in communica
tion. For example, Wine said
that numerous speakers have
received multiple invitations
to speak from campus groups
which don't know what the
others are doing. She said that
the students of Stanford don't
speak with a unified voice in
inviting people here.
This fragmentation makes it
even more difficult to pay the
high speakers fees demanded

by top celebrities.
Wine said there have been
efforts to make the Speakers
Bureau the sole voice of the
ASSU in inviting speakers, but
that other groups outside the
ASSU could still invite
speakers as well. "The ASSU
just doesn't have access to
those groups," she said
Dozens of other groups are
working to bring speakers to
campus. Branner Hall, Resi
dential Education and the
ASSU's Guest Professor
Bureau combined forces and
dollars to bring Pulitzer Prize
winning journalist Seymour
Hersh to campus earlier this
week.
The Stanford Law Forum
and Stanford-in-Government
are also working to bring
speakers to campus.
The Bechtel International
Center and the various aca
demic departments within the

University also attract
speakers. Overflow crowds
showed up to hear author
Eudora Welty speak last
month at kresge Auditorium
in a Creative Writing Program
sponsored reading.
With limited resources, the
Bechtel International Center
tries to bring, as Center Direc
tor Lee Ziegler said, "not
celebrities but skilled people
that have a great deal to offer
the Stanford community."
In the past few years the I-
Center has played host to a
number of personalities of in
ternational status including
Daniel Ellsberg and Shirley
Temple Black. Speakers for
the l-Center's Thursday Bag
Lunch Series are often faculty
members, residents of the Bay
Area or others here temporar
ily in academic programs.

They all speak at colleges
across the country — but not
here.
Some blame a lack of coor
dination for the dearth of
"big-name" speakers on
campus.
"There isn't even a Univer
sity calendar to let people
know what other groups are
doing," complained Katie
Wine of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau
does work to bring speakers

to campus, but it has a prob
lem: It has no money.
The bureau did not secure a
place on last year's fee assess
ment ballot because of a string
of technicalities At first the
organization failed to obtain
enough signatures on its peti
tion to assure a place on the
ballot.
However, the ASSU gave it
special dispensation because
of extenuating circumstances
and, for a while, it appeared
the bureau would earn a place
on the fee assessment ballot.
But when the bureau's staff
left a copy of its previous
vears' budget out of its fee as
sessment packet, the ASSU's
election commissioner

decided that the bureau had
simply made too many
mistakes to qualify for the bal
lot.
Wine said "a few small
mistakes" kept what Council
of-Presidents-member karol
Watson called the "most
popular" ASSU bureau from
getting a fee assessment.
The Stanford community is
now feeling the effects of this
loss.
With the budget of the
bureau down from about
$50,000 to $5000 this year, its
ability to attract top-name
speakers has been severely
limited.
The Wall Street Journal re
ported last month that the
University of Virginia is willing
to pay $8000 to have Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor speak there. That
amount is $3000 more than the
Speakers Bureau's budget for
the entire year."
The bureau is currently
working to attract speakers
who require no honorarium,
such as John Anderson, who
spoke here recently in turn for
only transportation and
lodging costs.
The Speakers Bureau is
working with the University to
create programs which would
involve speakers. One such
idea has been a debate on the
proposed Reagan library com
plex, but the plan has been
continually "getting punched
down," according to Wine.
The bureau has also been
actively trying to recruit
speakers with the little money
it has available.
Because the Guest Profes
sorship Bureau is currently
prohibited by the University to
set up actual guest professor
ships, it is also putting forth
some of its money to pay
speakers.
Yet another ASSU group,
the Lobby Office, is working
to bring to campus speakers
who could educate students in
the areas of public policy. The
Lobby Office is currently plan
ning a conference in April
titled "Participation: Public
Policy, Politics and Public Ser
vice." Invitations have been

sent out to eight presidential
candidates and other
speakers, including Tom
Hayden, Hoover Institution
fellows and Economics De
partment professors.
The Lobby Office
cooperates with other student
groups to combine funds to
pay for speakers. The office is
working to have state As
semblyman Byron Sher speak
here on January 20th on issues
including financial aid, the use
of animals in research and
other areas of student con
cern. The lobby group is also
working with the President's
Office, the Business School,
the Law School and the Medi
cal School to present a pro
gram titled "You Can Make a
Difference: Entrepreneurs in
Public Service."
Other groups are also trying
to attract speakers who re

quire no honorarium and
Stanford alumni passing
through campus who have
something to offer to the com
munity.
In January, Obie and Tony
winner David Henry Hwang, a
25-year-old Stanford graduate
and playwright, will speak
here.
This plethora of organiza
tions within the ASSU all
working independently on the
same problem can lead to
breakdowns in communica
tion. For example, Wine said
that numerous speakers have
received multiple invitations
to speak from campus groups
which don't know what the
others are doing. She said that
the students of Stanford don't
speak with a unified voice in
inviting people here.
This fragmentation makes it
even more difficult to pay the
high speakers fees demanded

by top celebrities.
Wine said there have been
efforts to make the Speakers
Bureau the sole voice of the
ASSU in inviting speakers, but
that other groups outside the
ASSU could still invite
speakers as well. "The ASSU
just doesn't have access to
those groups," she said
Dozens of other groups are
working to bring speakers to
campus. Branner Hall, Resi
dential Education and the
ASSU's Guest Professor
Bureau combined forces and
dollars to bring Pulitzer Prize
winning journalist Seymour
Hersh to campus earlier this
week.
The Stanford Law Forum
and Stanford-in-Government
are also working to bring
speakers to campus.
The Bechtel International
Center and the various aca
demic departments within the

University also attract
speakers. Overflow crowds
showed up to hear author
Eudora Welty speak last
month at kresge Auditorium
in a Creative Writing Program
sponsored reading.
With limited resources, the
Bechtel International Center
tries to bring, as Center Direc
tor Lee Ziegler said, "not
celebrities but skilled people
that have a great deal to offer
the Stanford community."
In the past few years the I-
Center has played host to a
number of personalities of in
ternational status including
Daniel Ellsberg and Shirley
Temple Black. Speakers for
the l-Center's Thursday Bag
Lunch Series are often faculty
members, residents of the Bay
Area or others here temporar
ily in academic programs.
