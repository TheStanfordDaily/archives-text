At this time last year, Carole
Cooke turned down a summer job
with the U.S. Department of Justice
because, "I couldn't afford to work
tor nothing."
Like many other Stanford law stu
dents, Cooke was interested in a
public service legal career, but con
sidered changing her plans because
of financial problems.
"I'm going to owe $35,000 by the
time I graduate," she said. "So I
went home to Chicago and started
looking for jobs with private firms."
A few months later, however, the
Law School announced a pilot pro
gram that provided low-interest
loans to students who took summer
jobs with public interest or govern
ment organizations. Tile loans Wilt
be forgiven it the students work for
public interest agencies after
graduation.
"I called the Justice Department
back and asked if I could still have
the job," Cooke said.
Representing the U.S. govern
ment at Mount Shasta last summer,
she tried 15 cases and won them all.
Most were petty offenses or mis
demeanors, but she also won an as
sault conviction and set a local prec
edent by getting a judge to order
restitution for a timber theft.
"It was a very positive experi
ence," she said, "but I wouldn't
have been able to do it without the
loan."
Ten other law students took part
in the program, and their experi
ences were generally positive.
Because of the pilot project's suc
cess, Law School Dean John Hart Ely
last week announced the establish
ment of a permanent program to
provide public interest job loans for
up to 20 students each summer.
The program has been endowed
by a $100,000 grant from Kenneth
and Harle Montgomery of
Northbrook, III.
"There is in our student body a
good deal of untapped interest in
serving the public good, which cur
rently is under realized because of
today's financial pressures," Elv
said.
The program "will help make it
possible for our students to act on
the basis of their true values rather
than out of monetary necessity," he
added.
Under the pilot program, each
student received up to $5200 in
loans, divided into $2000 for living
expenses and $1200 for tuition.
Their employers were required to
provide $500 in salary or services.
Loan recipients must make inter
est payments at a 9 percent annual
rate for two years following gradua
tion.
The principal will be due over a 5-
