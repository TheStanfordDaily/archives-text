# Loans given for public service law
## 
### SAM DELSON 
At this time last year, Carole
Cooke turned down a summer job
with the U.S. Department of Justice
because, "I couldn't afford to work
tor nothing."
Like many other Stanford law stu
dents, Cooke was interested in a
public service legal career, but con
sidered changing her plans because
of financial problems.
"I'm going to owe $35,000 by the
time I graduate," she said. "So I
went home to Chicago and started
looking for jobs with private firms."
A few months later, however, the
Law School announced a pilot pro
gram that provided low-interest
loans to students who took summer
jobs with public interest or govern
ment organizations. Tile loans Wilt
be forgiven it the students work for
public interest agencies after
graduation.
"I called the Justice Department
back and asked if I could still have
the job," Cooke said.
Representing the U.S. govern
ment at Mount Shasta last summer,
she tried 15 cases and won them all.
Most were petty offenses or mis
demeanors, but she also won an as
sault conviction and set a local prec
edent by getting a judge to order
restitution for a timber theft.
"It was a very positive experi
ence," she said, "but I wouldn't
have been able to do it without the
loan."
Ten other law students took part
in the program, and their experi
ences were generally positive.
Because of the pilot project's suc
cess, Law School Dean John Hart Ely
last week announced the establish
ment of a permanent program to
provide public interest job loans for
up to 20 students each summer.
The program has been endowed
by a $100,000 grant from Kenneth
and Harle Montgomery of
Northbrook, III.
"There is in our student body a
good deal of untapped interest in
serving the public good, which cur
rently is under realized because of
today's financial pressures," Elv
said.
The program "will help make it
possible for our students to act on
the basis of their true values rather
than out of monetary necessity," he
added.
Under the pilot program, each
student received up to $5200 in
loans, divided into $2000 for living
expenses and $1200 for tuition.
Their employers were required to
provide $500 in salary or services.
Loan recipients must make inter
est payments at a 9 percent annual
rate for two years following gradua
tion.
The principal will be due over a 5-
year period that begins in the third
year after graduation. Any students
earning less than $27,000 per year in
public interest or government legal
work will be forgiven the principal
payments during their years of such
employment.
In recent years, the majority of
Stanford's law graduates have cho
sen careers with corporate law
firms. In the class of 1982, only two
out of approximately 170 graduates
took jobs with government or public
interest agencies.
Not all of the other students
chose corporate careers in 1982.
During that year, 33 students, or 20
percent of the class, became clerks
for judges.
Public interest employment
among law graduates peaked at ap
proximately 20 percent in 1971, ac
cording to Gloria Pyszka, director of
the Law School's placement office.
A gradual decline began the next
year. Less than 5 percent of the last
three law classes chose government
or public interest work.
Final figures for the class of 1983
are not available yet, but Pyszka said
there has been "a slight increase in
the number of students who made
non-traditional, alternative career
choices." She noted, however, that
"there is no real trend toward public
interest careers."
Several students said there is
pressure at the law school to choose
corporate jobs.
"It comes from a lot of places —
professors, employers, and financial
pressures," first-year student Mic
helle Mercer said.
"Nobody holds a club over your
head and says you have to go cor
porate, but it's definitely the easy
career path," according to Mike
Zigler, a member of the Summer
Loan Program Committee.
"Most of the school's resources
are geared toward corporate place
ment," Zigler said.
"Not only do public interest jobs
pay less, but they're also much
more difficult to land," according to
second-year student Steven
Coldfarb. He noted that govern
ment funding cuts had led to signifi
cant decreases in the number of
public jobs.
"The pressure comes from society
itself as much as from the Law
School," added Goldfarb
Most agreed, however, that the
administration has made an effort in
recent years to make students more

aware of public interest opportuni
ties.
"There's been a real turnaround,"
Mercer said. "Dean Ely has talked
about public interest law so much
that I met someone who actually
wanted to know if it's Ok that he's
interested in corporate law."
Third-year student Sandra Ortiz
noted that most of the law faculty
have done some public interest work
and is therefore sympathetic to stu
dents who have similar interests.
Mcßride estimated that 25 of 40
law professors have public law expe
rience of one type or another.
"We're not trying to steer stu
dents in any particular direction,"
he said. "But we do want to reduce
the disincentives to public interest
work."

He added, "The program is
ideologically neutral. Society needs
both public defenders and
prosecutors."
Many law students choose cor
porate careers because of genuine
interest in that kind of work.
Others, however, prefer public in
terest careers but feel they need to
make more money.
Goldfarb, who worked for the
Mexican-American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund (MALDEF) last
summer, said, "one of my friends
jokes that he's not rich enough to
do poverty law.
At MALDEF, Goldfarb did research
on class-action suits and impact
litigation involving discriminatory
hiring practices.
"It was a good experience," he
said. "I might have done it even
without the loan, but the program
definitely helped."
Kirby Heller said her job at Public
Interest Advocates, Inc. in San Fran
cisco last summer was "a great ex

perience." She said, "I absolutely
wouldn't have been able to do it
without the loan."
Both Heller and Goldfarb said
they are still interested in public in
terest jobs, but both will work in
private firms this summer, earning
at least $600 per week.
Although most of the students
who participated in the test program
found it worthwhile, several said
they were disappointed in its finan
cial terms.
"It's billed as a loan forgiveness
program, but it's not," according to
one student who asked not to be
identified. "You have to pay interest
for the first two years no matter
what."
Several others expressed disap
pointment that the program does
not provide grants.
"I'd like to see more subsidy for
the students," Zigler said. "There's
a real need to redress the imbalance
in resources between private
recruiters and public sector jobs."
One student questioned whether
it was helpful at all.
'"It's not that good a deal," Ortiz
said. "In some ways, it's not even
better than nothing."
Ortiz worked at the National Cen
ter for Immigrants' Rights in Los An
geles last summer, where her re
sponsibilities included helping Sal
vadoran refugees gain political
asylum.
She noted that the Law School did
not provide any support for her 1982
summer job with a different public
interest agency. "They wanted me
enough that they came up with $6 an
hour," she said.
Without the loan program, she
added, the immigrant center might
have paid her more directly. She
said agencies are more likely to give
student workers responsibility if
they have to make a financial invest
ment.
Cooke said her job last summer
gave her experience that could not
have been duplicated in a private
firm. "I had to be self-motivated and
think on my feet a lot," she said.
"It was a lot more exciting than
private work," she added.
She said she would like to work
for the government again after
graduation. Despite her preference
for public sector law, however, she
will spend this summer at the
Chicago firm of Coffield, Ungaretti,
Harris and Slavin, earning $8100
over three months.
"The problem with public work is
that you're not just going into
debt," she said, "but you're also
giving up big bucks."
