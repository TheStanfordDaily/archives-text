## Its Stanford vs. SJS and UNC vs. Fordham tonight Top-ranked Tar Heels arrive for HP-Stanford tourney 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The party for Stanford basketball, at least for now, is
over.
After beating up NAIA and NCAA Division II oppo
nents in its first two games by 41 and 39 points, the 2-0
Cardinal will get its first true test of the season today
and tomorrow in the Hewlett-Packard/Stanford Invita
tional at Maples Pavilion.
But should Stanford win the 4-team tournament —
which features the likes of No. 1 ranked North
Carolina, East Coast power Fordham and South Bay
rival San Jose State — the party will just have begun for
Head Coach Tom Davis and company.
"This is an exceptional field for us locally," Davis said
yesterday at the pre-tournament press conference at
Ming's Restaurant in Palo Alto. "For Stanford, in partic
ular, to bring in two quality operations like Fordham
and North Carolina, I can't say enough."
Stanford and San lose State meet in tonight's first
game at 7 p.m. while North Carolina and Fordham take
the court in the second contest at 9 p.m. The winners
will play in the finals tomorrow night at 9 p.m. with the
consolation game scheduled for 7 p.m. Maples Pavilion
is sold-out both nights.
If Stanford and North Carolina win as predicted, the
Card would have a chance to really put its basketball
program on the map by playing the Tar Heels close, let
alone beating them. However, Davis warned about
looking past San Jose State.
"I'm hopeful that we're really thinking strongly
about San jose State," Davis said, "because they are a
talented ballclub that is capable of putting a pretty
good beating on us because of their size and quickness
and running and jumping ability. They are also ex
tremely well-coached. So, if we're not, we'll be playing
in the consolation game Saturday night."
All four teams have started the season well and their
combined record is 7-2. Stanford (2-0), North Carolina
(2-0) and San Jose State (1-0) all come into the tourna
ment undefeated, while Fordham has split its four con
tests. One of those losses, though, was a one-point
decision to nationally-ranked Arkansas.
Although the press conference previewed the tourn
ament, most of the talk by the four coaches centered
around Smith, who will be going for wins No. 499 and
500 this weekend.
In 22 seasons at North Carolina, Smith has guided the
Tar Heels to a NCAA championship (in 1982), seven
Final Four appearances (second only to former UCLA
Coach John Wooden), a NIT (National Invitational

Tournament) title and 11 ACC (Atlantic Coast Confer
ence) crowns. The last time a Dean Smith team lost
more than nine games in a season was in 1966.
"Certainly, he's going to go down as one of the
greatest coaches in the history of basketball," Davis
said. "Coach Smith has had a tremendous impact on
me and my coaching style."
Smith, however, is taking his approaching win No.
500 in stride. "It means you've been a coach for a long
time," he joked.

Stanford
Davis does not know what to expect from a young
and inexperienced San Jose State team tonight. All he
has to go on is their one game this season.
But Davis is not one to worry too much about his op
ponent. Stanford in all likelihood will not alter its style
of play against San Jose State, though it may switch
defenses much more often than in its first two games.
One potential problem for the Stanford may be han
dling itself in a tight game. The Card's first two were for
all practical purposes over early in the second half.
Davis and company blew open 10 or 15 point games in
the first few minutes of the final period to trounce
Hawaii Pacific 115-74 and Bemidji State 98-59.
In both games, Stanford raced to early leads, then
watched its opponent catch up again. Against any of
the teams in the tournament, Stanford will not have
that luxury.
Furthermore, Stanford will have to overcome its lack
of height in facing any one of the other three teams.
Hence, 6-foot-7 center John Revelli or 6-7 forward Hans
Wichary will have to stay out of foul trouble.
Davis plans to go with Keith Jones at one guard and
Keith Ramee at the point. Either Andy Fischer or Steve
Brown will get the call at small forward. Regardless of
who starts, as many as 10 Card hoopsters could see
substantial action in the tournament.
San jose State
When San Jose State Coach Bill Berry says he's start
ing from scratch this season, he means it.
The Spartans lost nine lettermen from last year's
team, including their top six scorers and top seven
rebounders. Only three lettermen return from last

"We're fairly young and in

In San )ose State's only out
ing this year, it defeated lowly
San Francisco State 55-42. In
the game, only two Spartans
scored in double figures — 6-8
junior center John Nord with
12 and 6-5 reserve forward
George Puou with 10.
Though San Jose State lacks
experienced personnel, it
does not have that problem at
coach. Berry, who was an as
sistant at Michigan State under
Jud Heathcoat when MSU won
the NCAA championship with
Ervin "Magic" Johnson, has
been known to pull off an up
set or two in his career.
North Carolina
While much has been said
about Smith's coaching abili
ties, he has not gone 498-153
in his 22 years at North

- North Carolina
Coach Dean Smith

Carolina by himself. He's had
some help from players like
Walter Davis, Phil Ford and
lames Worthy.
Smith's latest stars are 6-9
senior Sam Perkins (averaging
14.0 points and 13.0 rebounds
a game) and 6-6 junior guard
Michael Jordan (20.5 ppg).
Both were All-Americans last
season and played on the
United States' gold-medal
winning Pan American Games
team. They also are expected
to be on the United States'
1984 Olympic squad.
But UNC's talent doesn't
stop there. Forward Matt
Doherty, a 6-8 senior averag
ing 8.5 points and 5.0
rebounds a game, and guards
Buzz Peterson and Steve Hale
are all excellent players. Brad

Daugherty, Smith's 6-11 soph
omore center, is collecting 9.5
points an outing.
The Tar Heels were ranked
No. 1 in most pre-seas on
polls, and, although thev have
dropped to second in the As
socicated Press' rankings, they
are still top-rated according to
Sports Illustrated and a num
ber of other publications.
"It (the 1983-84 team) is
probabh the most talent
we've had through nine men,
but whether or not they'll
come together is a different
question," said Smith, whose

taken his teams to nine
straight NCAA tournaments.
It goes without saying that
North Carolina's opponents
will be the ones making the
changes, not the Tar Heels.
The onlv adjustment North
Carolina will make is to the
time zone.
Fordham
Because the Rams come
from farthest away (The Bronx,
N.Y.) and do not have the
notoriety of a North Carolina,
it would be easy to assume
they are not a threat to win the
tournament. Not so.
Fordham, under the
tutelage of Gene Wilder-look
alike Tom Penders, has gone
to the NIT the last three
seasons, finishing with
records of 19-11, 18-11 and 19-
9.
Fordham, after losing four
starters from last year's team,
is supposed to be in the
rebuilding process in 1983-84.
But judging by their perfor
mance so far this season, they
most certainly are not.
After losing to nationally
ranked Arkansas 62-61, the
Rams defeated USC, 78-67,
and Alaska, 69-68. Fordham,
which plays a disciplined
brand of basketball, dropped
its second game of the season
last Tuesday to Santa Clara, 59-
49.
"Two nights ago at Santa
Clara, we had a very rough
night," Penders said. "I don't
want to say any more about it
because the same two guys
(officials) might be working
the game tomorrow night."
