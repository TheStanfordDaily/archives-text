### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford Athletic Director
Andy Geiger yesterday denied
rumors that the number of
candidates for the vacant head
football coaching job has been
narrowed to six.
Geiger, when asked if an ar
ticle in a San Francisco news
paper listing the six possible
successors to former Coach
Paul Wiggin was correct,
responded with an emphatic,
"No way."
The paper listed the six
finalists for Wiggin's job as
"jack Elway of San Jose State,
LaVell Edwards of Brigham
Young, J'm Sochor of UC-
Davis, George Welsh of Vir
ginia, Dick Sheridan of Fur
man and Paul Hackett, the
(San Francisco) 49ers' quarter
backs and receivers coach."
"We're still searching,"
Geiger said. "We have some
definite ideas and some of
those people (on the list) are
strong possibilites. But we've
offered the job to nobody."
Geiger, however, did note
that "we will narrow it (the list
of candidates) down over the
weekend." Once the list of
finalists is completed, Geiger
said he will conduct interviews
before offering the job to one
of them.
While UC-Davis' Sochor,
San jose State's tlway, Brig
ham Young's tdwards and the
49ers' Hackett are considered

definite possi bi I ites. Virginia's
Welsh and Furman's Sheridan
are thought to be long-shot
candidates at best.
Sochor, whose Aggies are
undefeated this season, will
lead UC-Davis against North
Dakota State tomorrow in an
NCAA Division II semifinal
game.
Elway is the father of former
Stanford and now Denver
Broncos quarterback John tl
way and suffered his first

losing season at San Jose State
this year. Flway, however, has
coached Spartan teams to up
set victories over Stanford the
last three seasons.
Edwards is the mastermind
behind Brigham Young's suc
cess in turning out profes
sional quarterbacks at a rate
topped only by Stanford.
Hackett was reportedly in
the running for the Stanford
head coaching job the last two
times it w,is vacant.
