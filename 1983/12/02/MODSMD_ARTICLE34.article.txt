## Monterey Peninsula: Cannery Row to Carmel 
### EMMA MITCHELL 
The only thing that stops the
Monterey Peninsula from
being the perfect weekend
get awav is that two days just
aren't enough to sample
everything the area has to of
fer.
Less than a two-hour drive
from Stanford will put
you in one of the loveliest
places on the West Coast,
where there is an unlimited
amount to do and see in an
area of spectacular beauty.
Even the route there, across
Highway 17 from San lose to
Santa Cruz and then south on
Highwav 1, is pretty, especially
at this time of vear when many
trees along the way have
changed color.
The town ot Monterey is a
good place to spend the night
on the peninsula because it is
central and has a number of
lodging facilities. A good
choice is the West Wind
Lodge (1046 Munras Avenue,
Monterey) which is only a few
minutes from Fisherman's
Wharf. Its clean and com
fortable and provides rooms
which range in price from $45
to $60 a night. Rates are lower
in the winter when the wea
ther is more stormv, and it is
wise to make reservations be
cause the peninsula is a
popular vacation spot.
The two best-known Mon
terey attractions are unques
tionably Fisherman's Wharf
and Cannery Row. The Wharf,
which was once the home of
whaling schooners and
sardine fishing boats, is now

the site of shops and restau
rants. Vou can buy fresh fish
there or go out deep sea
fishing yourself. In November
and April vou can get on a
boat to watch grey whales
migrate past Monterey Bav.
Cannery Row was the
sardine capital of the Western
Hemisphere in the 1920s and
' }os. When the sardines disap
peared in the '40s the canning
companies shut down and the
Monterev waterfront began to
rot awav- )ohn Steinbeck's
novel "Cannery Row.' however,
started a revival of interest and
the rotting buildings were
remodeled into stores, shops,
and restaurants. Two popular
places to dine on the Row are
the Sardine Factory and the
Whaling Station Inn which of
fer a wide variety of seafood
dishes.
A trip to the peninsula
would not be complete if you
missed 17 Mile Drive through
Pebble Beach. On Highway 1,
between Monterey and Car
mel, this is one of the most
beautiful detours you will ever
take. It is the scenic route
through one of the most af
fluent and and exclusive com
munities in the United States.
It costs $4 to enter, but you
can spend as long as you want
driving through its pine
forests and groves of Monter
ey Cyprus. There are 26
marked points of interest
along the way, from Spanish
Bay, where you can picnic bv
the ocean, to Seal and Bird

Point, where you can watch
cormorants, gulls, and sea
lions. You'll also see Cyprus
Point, one the most frequently
photographed places in Cali
fornia.
One of the last stops on the
Drive is the lodge at Pebble
Beach set on the waterfront
setting. The lodge's rates are
probably too steep for most
students but in the Cvprus

Room it is possible to get a
taste of what it's like without
having to spend a lot. They
serve excellent raspberry dai
quiris which you can sip in
front of the windows that
overlook Carmel Bay and
Point Lobas.

Carrn/el is only a few
minutes south of the 17 Mile
Drive Gates. Take the Ocean
Avenue exit and you'll drive
past dozens of shops and art
galleries, eventually arriving at
Carmel Beach. The town's
fame as a creative community

of writers and artists began in
the early 1900s when it was
first discovered by Stanford
University professors as a
popular site for summer
homes.
When you're tired of shop
ping, leave Ocean Avenue and

wander along the backstreets.
As Carmel is less than one
square mile in size, it's easy to
tour on foot. You'll see
houses in an incredible variety
of architectural styles, sur
rounded by pines, Cyprus
trees and flowers, reminiscent
ot an imaginary scene you
might find in an illustrated
children's book. There are no
street lights and the houses
have ther own names rather
than street numbers, which
adds to Carmel's charm.
The Carmel Mission, with its
beautiful flowering courtyard,
is also worth visiting. Estab
lished in 1770, by Father
Junipero Serra as the second
mission in California, it has
been carefully restored.
If you have a few free hours
left in your weekend you
should consider driving south
on Highway 1 to Big Sur only
26 miles from Carmel. The
route hugs the coastline,
twisting and turning and offer
ing spectacular views of cliffs
and ocean. You'll want to stop
often to enjoy the scenery and
take photographs. Even if you
just turn around at Big Sur and
come right back you'll never
regret having made the time
for the drive.
If you want to get far away
from Stanford without going
far this winter, head for the
Monterey Peninsula. One
word of warning: it's hard to
come back.
