## Barthelme: fine writing is not enough "Overnight to Many Distant Cities" does not offer new developments 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
rOvernight to Many Distant
kities," by Donald Barth
elme, Putnam's, 174 pp.,
!$13.95.
Is it fair to ask a perceptive,
critically-minded contempo
rary author to write stories
that contain some commit
ment to an interpretation of
his subject matter?
Donald Bartheleme's intelli
gence and skill are acknowl
edged, indeed are so
remarkable that it would be
unfair to mention his excellent
craftsmanship and then ignore
it as a given, in order to dis
cuss other aspects of his work.
But Barthelme's writing is so
fine that his unwillingness to
risk affirmative statements
about the people in his stories
becomes a fault that, though
easily tolerable in a lesser au
thor, is a major issue here.
By asking for "affirmative
statements" I don't mean that
Barthelme should intrusively
moralize about Life with a cap

ital L. Just presenting his char
acters without a constant tone
of irony, without undermining
them through satire or hand
springs of narrative virtuosity
would grant them enough dig
nity to let the reader consider
their predicaments as worth
taking seriously. Because
some of the things Barthelme
writes about are serious. And
the occasional passages in
which someone's emotions
are presented with orcJinary
sympathy betray a shy tender
ness that, if admitted into the
narrative more often, could
add depth to Barthelme's
technical mastery.
There are moments in the
first two full pieces in this
newest collection since "Sixty
Stories" that call for this
added emotional dimension.
In "Visitors" a fair degree of
respect is allowed to the main
character, Bishop, through the
whole story. In "Affection,"
Barthelme ends up playing
games with the narrative that
don't quite spoil the effect,
but make it seem subordinate

to matters of technique. Even
when his characters feel a mo
ment of joy, it is tempered by
restraint on their part, and by
a certain condescending
humor from the author.

best observations in Bar
thelme's work, yet the au
thor's sensitivity to his charac
ters' wariness of getting hurt
carries over to induce caution
about putting himself on the
line. But if Barthelme is able to
create characters who are
dying for sympathy, why can't
he be decent enough to pre
sent them in a way that allows
the reader to feel for them?
I said earlier that it would be

unfair to do no more than
mention Barthelme's amazing
ability to tell stories in new
and different ways. He
combines the realist virtues of
sensitive dialogue and well
chosen detail with a tireless
capacity to reduce and rear
range the narrative structure
that is so rarely varied by other
writers. This inventiveness,
which goes hand in hand with
Barthelme's sophisticated
sense of humor, seems to be
what gains him the attention
and admiration of literate
readers.
But reading his writing is
sometimes like watching a
mad paleontologist at work.
The narrative framework of
the ordinary short story is
hardly advanced beyond that
of 19th century examples, so it
is a relief to see Barthelme
take those old dinosaur bones
and show that there are count
less ways of rearranging them
into more or less viable
creatures. But only other ar
chaeologists are really inter
ested in seeing the bones put

together. Most people are jus
tifiably more concerned with
what the animals were like
with their flesh on. Bar
thelme's subject matter
sometimes seems to be there
just to show that a story about
ordinary events can be told in
a" way you never thought of
before.
It's usually a fault in a review
to spend more time talkng
about ideas than about the
contents of the book under
examination, but here this
seems to be a case of criticism
imitating art. Barthelme's
stories are about ideas about
storytelling. I understand that
he was once a ghostwriter,
and a flavor of that seems
present in his own fiction,
which lacks the sense that a
flesh-and-blood author stands
somewhere behind the nar
rative tone of disavowal. Irony
is a very effective way of
making a point, but when
there is no point the ironist is
willing to make, one may well
object that the game offers
rather thin amusement.
