### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
Rolling Stone readers will know
what to expect from"The New Rol
ling Stone Record Guide" (Edited by
Dave Marsh and John Swenson,
Random House, 648 pp., $12.95
paper i and thev will also know whe
ther the\ want it. As an aid to buying
albums to extend your collection, it
can't really be much help. To know
whether you want an album, you
realls do have to listen to some of it,
.uid the descriptions in the guide
don t make much of a pretense at
discussing each album's character.
W (..it thev do accomplish is to make
\ou go out and want to hear all sorts
Jiscs you ve never bothered with,
some ot them by people you've
never even heard of.
The guide is arranged alphabeti
c.ill\ In artist. Each review is
headed b\ a list of the group's al
bums rated on a scale from
Indispensable" to "Worthless."
I he cop\ on each group ranges
tmm cutting one-line dismissals for
the Worthless artists, to full-page
histories ot the better-regarded
people s recording careers. The
wr ting is energetic, and full of the
:\ charm that only arrogance can
•iduce. It you've seen the better
ens in Rolling Stone before, you
know the way most of the judg
ments will tend to lean. But even if

you already know that you'll dis
agree with the reviews, consider
flipping through the book to see if
the voluminous information if con
tains will make it worth putting on
your reference shelf.
"Even a quick glance at the 17th
and 18th centuries is enough to
induce fatigue. If cows were not in
credibly stubborn they would retire
at this point, but bovine will and
curiosity cannot be easily
suppressed." The same, alas, can
not be said of your reviewer. Marc
Gallant's "The Cow Book'' (Knopf, 52
pp., $17.95, 25 plates) is not in itself
especially bad. It's one of those silly
gift books that's fun, but it's hardly
distinguishable from others of the
breed. The gimmick here is that Gal
lant has gotten 25 international ar
tists to paint illustrations tor his his
tory of the world from a cow's point
of view.
Some of the text is amusing, and
the plates are cute enough, too, but
the basic idea behind this kind of
book is rather sad. There are lots of
really interesting books out there
you can find as gifts for your friends,
and with a little effort you can make
them suit the recipient's taste pretty
well.
Products like "The Cow Book"
are literary neckties; an all-purpose
gift that probably won't offend, but

is unlikely to show much effort in
selection (unless, of course, your
uncle has some sort of kinky tiling
about cows). It can be said to Gal
lant's credit that the idea behind
"The Cow Book" was novel, but the
artists who contributed to the
volume have not done enough good
work to make this book any better
than its competitors.
Truman Capote's "One Christmas"
(Random House, 42 pp., $12.95)
comes in a plastic shrink wrapping,
so you can't take the slender
volume out of its handsome box and
page through it before you buy it.
Too bad. You could easily read the
short story it contains in fifteen
minutes, and you'd know what it
was like before giving it to some
one.
That's important, because, unlike
Capote's moving and beautiful "A
Christmas Memory," "One
Christmas" has a sad ending that is
unredeemed by genuine affection
for a lost family member. The young
narrator's final expression of love
tor his absent father is touching, but
it seems a product of his sense of
duty and pity, and not of genuine
tenderness, so the father's accep
tance of it only demonstrates his
pathetic loneliness. Good storytel
ling, but a tad grim for the holiday
season.

"Even a quick glance at the 17th
and 18th centuries is enough to
induce fatigue. If cows were not in
credibly stubborn they would retire
at this point, but bovine will and
curiosity cannot be easily
suppressed." The same, alas, can
not be said of your reviewer. Marc
Gallant's "The Cow Book'' (Knopf, 52
pp., $17.95, 25 plates) is not in itself
especially bad. It's one of those silly
gift books that's fun, but it's hardly
distinguishable from others of the
breed. The gimmick here is that Gal
lant has gotten 25 international ar
tists to paint illustrations tor his his
tory of the world from a cow's point
of view.
Some of the text is amusing, and
the plates are cute enough, too, but
the basic idea behind this kind of
book is rather sad. There are lots of
really interesting books out there
you can find as gifts for your friends,
and with a little effort you can make
them suit the recipient's taste pretty
well.
Products like "The Cow Book"
are literary neckties; an all-purpose
gift that probably won't offend, but

is unlikely to show much effort in
selection (unless, of course, your
uncle has some sort of kinky tiling
about cows). It can be said to Gal
lant's credit that the idea behind
"The Cow Book" was novel, but the
artists who contributed to the
volume have not done enough good
work to make this book any better
than its competitors.
Truman Capote's "One Christmas"
(Random House, 42 pp., $12.95)
comes in a plastic shrink wrapping,
so you can't take the slender
volume out of its handsome box and
page through it before you buy it.
Too bad. You could easily read the
short story it contains in fifteen
minutes, and you'd know what it
was like before giving it to some
one.
That's important, because, unlike
Capote's moving and beautiful "A
Christmas Memory," "One
Christmas" has a sad ending that is
unredeemed by genuine affection
for a lost family member. The young
narrator's final expression of love
tor his absent father is touching, but
it seems a product of his sense of
duty and pity, and not of genuine
tenderness, so the father's accep
tance of it only demonstrates his
pathetic loneliness. Good storytel
ling, but a tad grim for the holiday
season.
