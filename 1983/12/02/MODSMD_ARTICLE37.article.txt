M*A»S»H* (1970)
Kresge Auditorium
Robert Altman's first
breakthrough was this classic
depiction of sane men and
madmen in a Korean War
medical unit. The stunning cast
includes Donald Sutherland
(who has never been better),
Elliott Could (who has been
better only once — in another
Altman film, The Long
Goodbye), Tom Skerritt, Sally
Kellerman, Robert Duvall,
Rene Auberjonois, and of
course Gary Burghof, who
survived the Korean War only
to re-enlist — in the TV version
of Ring Lardner, Jr.
adapted the Richard Hooker
novel (one of a series), though
much of the rapid-fire overlap
ping dialogue (the best since
His Cirl Friday) was obviously
improvised under Altman's su
pervision. Quite likely the fun
niest movie ever made about
war.
Plays tonight.
Stripes (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
Bill Murray joins the army.
Not a good movie, God knows,
but a fairly consistently funny
one, though the screenwriters
(Dan Goldberg, Len Blum and
Murray's co-star, Harold
Ramis) would have been
smarter to leave Murray and
the boys at home in the United
States — once they get to
Europe, the plot goes haywire
and the script runs out of
comic invention. Bill Murray is
priceless, as usual, and lohn
Candy gives him able support.
Also starring the late Warren
Oates; directed by Ivan Reit
man, who made Murray's first
picture, Meatballs.
Plays Sunday evening.
The Bitter Tears of Petra von
Kant (1972)
Terman Auditorium
In this eccentric chronicle of
a lesbian love affair, directed
by Rainer Werner Fassbinder,
the actresses (including Hanna
Schygulla) seem straitjacketed
by their jewelled, metallic
costumes, and their actions
and line readings are so
stylized that they begin to sug
gest sexual robots. Perhaps no
one since Fritz Lang in
Siegfried's Death has staged a
film in such an odd,
deliberately stilted fashion,
and (like the Lang silent) Petra

von Kant is so static that you
feel you'd kill for more camera
movement. Fassbinder's
reputation is based on his
audacity in making movies no
one else could possibly want
to make.
Plays Tuesday evening.
Dodes-ka'den (1970)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Akira Kurosawa set this
serene, lyrical film among the
poor in an unnamed city:
Paralyzed or muted by their
own fear and hardships, they
are reminiscent of the pipe
dreamers in O'Neill's The
Iceman Cometh, but the deli
cate melancholy with which he
portrays them suggests Hans
Christian Andersen, and so do
the fairy-tale, finger-painted
art direction and photography.
The dramatis personae in
cludes a cuckold who plays fa
ther to all his whore-wife's
kids, a girl who constructs
paper flowers until she col
lapses from exhaustion, a
thief, an old sage, and — most
memorably — a dreamer and
his beggar son, who live in the
carcass of an ancient
abandoned car. Beautifully
acted and directed.
Plays Monday with Sandakan
8.
O Lucky Man! (1973)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Lindsay Anderson spent two
years and a great deal of
money assembling this long (3-
hour) movie, which is really a
fairly unimaginative, unnerv
ingly insistent updated version
of Candide, with Malcolm
McDowell in the role of the in
nocent protagonist. It's a
passive starring part — all reac
tions — so he can't do much
with it, and a large, talented
supporting cast (Arthur Lowe,
Ralph Richardson, Rachel
Roberts, Helen Mirren, Mona
Washbourne, Dandy Nichols)
is wasted as well. David Sher
win wrote the script. The only
distinctions in the picture are
Miroslav Ondricek's photogra

phy and a series of Brechtian
musical interludes written and
performed by the winning Alan
Price.
Plays Tuesday with Britannia
Hospital.
You Can't Take It with You
(1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
George S. Kaufman and
Moss Hart wrote a wonderful
comedy about a family of non
conformists who manage
largely to ignore the Depres
sion, but Frank Capra wasn't
satisfied with it: He had Robert
Riskin rewrite it in the
glorified-little-man mode that
was Capra's trademark. It took
the Oscars for best picture and
best director, but it's overlong
(127 minutes), shamelessly
preachy, and not especially
well done. In beefed-up ver
sions of the hero and heroine
roles, Jimmy Stewart and Jean
Arthur salvage everything they
can (Riskin did write one
charming new scene for them,
set in a restaurant), and Mischa
'Auer makes a hilarious
Kolenkhov (the Russian dance
instructor). But Lionel Bar
rymore is no more convincing
as a lovable old codger here
than he would be as a
reprehensible old bastard in
Capra's It's a Wonderful Life
some years later. The cast also
includes Edward Arnold,
Spring Byington, Ann Miller,
Samuel S. Hinds, Donald
Meek, H.B. Warner, Halliwell
Hobbes, Mary Forbes, Dub
Taylor and Eddie Anderson.
Plays through Wednesday
with Dinner at Eight.
Dinner at Eight (1933)
Festival, Palo Alto
As a low-down married pair
— a couple of scrappers with
enough money to force their
way into high society — Jean
Harlow and Wallace Beery
steal this high-sheen comedy
melodrama away from John
Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore,
Marie Dressier, Billie Burke,

Reviews by Sieve Vineberg

Lee Tracy, Edmund Lowe,
Madge Evans and Jean Her
sholt. Frances Marion and Her
man J. Mankiewicz did a
stylish, professional job of
adapting a popular play by
George S. Kaufman and Edna
Ferber, and George Cukor di
rected it, smoothly and with
out pretension. This is a
surprisingly enduring example
of the kind ot star-studded,

multi-plotted, drawing room
extravaganza M-G-M prided it

Rear Window (1954)
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's cele
brated thriller, out of distribu
tion for years, is so expertly
tooled and so absorbing that
you come out of the theater
grinning — despite the talky
script (John Michael Hayes,
out of a Cornell Woolrich

story) and almost unrelieved
bad acting in the supporting
roles. (Thelma Ritter is the
shining exception.) James
Stewart, an unlikely casting
choice, plays an adventurous
photojournalist who, laid up
for six weeks with a broken
leg, resorts to the endlessly in

teresting activity of watching
his neighbors through a pair of
high-powered binoculars. All
the vignettes are cliches, so
Hitchcock introduces them in
a big Broadway-musical-style
opening on the movie's single
set, and throughout the film he
employs them as interludes,
numbers. With Grace Kelly and
Raymond Burr.
Never Say Never Again
(1983)
Park, Menlo Park
This leisurely, laid-back spy
whirl, starring Sean Connery as
James Bond, may seem per
verse to those who go to it
seeking the thrills available in
the best parts of the The Spy
Who Loved Me and
Octopussy, but it's like taking
a marvelous vacation. Irvin
Kershner, the director, chose a
sly, relaxed style to match
Lorenzo Semple's script, in
which "M" (Edward Fox)
decides that Bond's taste for
rich food and drink has worn
him down, and so he sends
him to a health clinic. Kershner
works in such an unstressed
manner here, eschewing exci
tation techniques, that you're
not forced to notice how
beautifully designed and
structured each sequence is.
With a trio of class villains: Bar
bara Carrera, Klaus Maria Bran
dauer and Max Von Sydow.
Gandhi (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A three-and-a-quarter-hour
soporific. Richard Atten
borough doesn't have the right
qualities for epic filmmaking;
furthermore, out of either a
lack of personal resources or
an ascetic refusal to vulgarize
Gandhi's story, he resists turn
ing it into theater. And in the
process of purifying it of his
torical lumps, he has buried
much essential factual infor
mation and obfuscated the is
sues. Ben Kingsley brings a
fascinating mixture of under
stated passion and unpredicta
ble wit to the title role — he
humanizes the icon John
Briley's homiletic screenplay
sets up — but the rest of the
cast (John Gielgud, Edward
Fox, Trevor Howard, Martin
Sheen, Candice Bergen, lan
Charleson, Michael Hordern,
John Mills, etc., etc.) is just ex
pensive dressing.

of Candide, with Malcolm
McDowell in the role of the in

passive starring part — all reac

supporting cast (Arthur Lowe,

is wasted as well. David Sher

You Can't Take It with You
(1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
George S. Kaufman and
Moss Hart wrote a wonderful
comedy about a family of non
conformists who manage
largely to ignore the Depres
sion, but Frank Capra wasn't
satisfied with it: He had Robert
Riskin rewrite it in the
glorified-little-man mode that
was Capra's trademark. It took
the Oscars for best picture and
best director, but it's overlong
(127 minutes), shamelessly
preachy, and not especially
well done. In beefed-up ver
sions of the hero and heroine
roles, Jimmy Stewart and Jean
Arthur salvage everything they
can (Riskin did write one
charming new scene for them,
set in a restaurant), and Mischa
'Auer makes a hilarious
Kolenkhov (the Russian dance
instructor). But Lionel Bar
rymore is no more convincing
as a lovable old codger here
than he would be as a
reprehensible old bastard in
Capra's It's a Wonderful Life
some years later. The cast also
includes Edward Arnold,
Spring Byington, Ann Miller,
Samuel S. Hinds, Donald
Meek, H.B. Warner, Halliwell
Hobbes, Mary Forbes, Dub
Taylor and Eddie Anderson.
Plays through Wednesday

Rear Window (1954)
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's cele
brated thriller, out of distribu
tion for years, is so expertly
tooled and so absorbing that
you come out of the theater
grinning — despite the talky
script (John Michael Hayes,
out of a Cornell Woolrich

story) and almost unrelieved
bad acting in the supporting
roles. (Thelma Ritter is the
shining exception.) James
Stewart, an unlikely casting
choice, plays an adventurous
photojournalist who, laid up
for six weeks with a broken
leg, resorts to the endlessly in

teresting activity of watching
his neighbors through a pair of
high-powered binoculars. All
the vignettes are cliches, so
Hitchcock introduces them in
a big Broadway-musical-style
opening on the movie's single
set, and throughout the film he
employs them as interludes,
numbers. With Grace Kelly and
Raymond Burr.
Never Say Never Again
(1983)
Park, Menlo Park
This leisurely, laid-back spy
whirl, starring Sean Connery as
James Bond, may seem per
verse to those who go to it
seeking the thrills available in
the best parts of the The Spy
Who Loved Me and
Octopussy, but it's like taking
a marvelous vacation. Irvin
Kershner, the director, chose a
sly, relaxed style to match
Lorenzo Semple's script, in
which "M" (Edward Fox)
decides that Bond's taste for
rich food and drink has worn
him down, and so he sends
him to a health clinic. Kershner
works in such an unstressed
manner here, eschewing exci
tation techniques, that you're
not forced to notice how
beautifully designed and
structured each sequence is.
With a trio of class villains: Bar
bara Carrera, Klaus Maria Bran
dauer and Max Von Sydow.
Gandhi (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A three-and-a-quarter-hour
soporific. Richard Atten
borough doesn't have the right
qualities for epic filmmaking;
furthermore, out of either a
lack of personal resources or
an ascetic refusal to vulgarize
Gandhi's story, he resists turn
ing it into theater. And in the
process of purifying it of his
torical lumps, he has buried
much essential factual infor
mation and obfuscated the is
sues. Ben Kingsley brings a
fascinating mixture of under
stated passion and unpredicta
ble wit to the title role — he
humanizes the icon John
Briley's homiletic screenplay
sets up — but the rest of the
cast (John Gielgud, Edward
Fox, Trevor Howard, Martin
Sheen, Candice Bergen, lan
Charleson, Michael Hordern,
John Mills, etc., etc.) is just ex
pensive dressing.
Plays Sunday.

M*A»S»H* (1970)
Kresge Auditorium
Robert Altman's first
breakthrough was this classic
depiction of sane men and
madmen in a Korean War
medical unit. The stunning cast
includes Donald Sutherland
(who has never been better),
Elliott Could (who has been
better only once — in another
Altman film, The Long
Goodbye), Tom Skerritt, Sally
Kellerman, Robert Duvall,
Rene Auberjonois, and of
course Gary Burghof, who
survived the Korean War only
to re-enlist — in the TV version
of Ring Lardner, Jr.
adapted the Richard Hooker
novel (one of a series), though
much of the rapid-fire overlap
ping dialogue (the best since
His Cirl Friday) was obviously
improvised under Altman's su
pervision. Quite likely the fun
niest movie ever made about
war.
Plays tonight.
Stripes (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
Bill Murray joins the army.
Not a good movie, God knows,
but a fairly consistently funny
one, though the screenwriters
(Dan Goldberg, Len Blum and
Murray's co-star, Harold
Ramis) would have been
smarter to leave Murray and
the boys at home in the United
States — once they get to
Europe, the plot goes haywire
and the script runs out of
comic invention. Bill Murray is
priceless, as usual, and lohn
Candy gives him able support.
Also starring the late Warren
Oates; directed by Ivan Reit
man, who made Murray's first
picture, Meatballs.
Plays Sunday evening.
The Bitter Tears of Petra von
Kant (1972)
Terman Auditorium
In this eccentric chronicle of
a lesbian love affair, directed
by Rainer Werner Fassbinder,
the actresses (including Hanna
Schygulla) seem straitjacketed
by their jewelled, metallic
costumes, and their actions
and line readings are so
stylized that they begin to sug
gest sexual robots. Perhaps no
one since Fritz Lang in
Siegfried's Death has staged a
film in such an odd,
deliberately stilted fashion,
and (like the Lang silent) Petra

von Kant is so static that you
feel you'd kill for more camera
movement. Fassbinder's
reputation is based on his
audacity in making movies no
one else could possibly want
to make.
Plays Tuesday evening.
Dodes-ka'den (1970)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Akira Kurosawa set this
serene, lyrical film among the
poor in an unnamed city:
Paralyzed or muted by their
own fear and hardships, they
are reminiscent of the pipe
dreamers in O'Neill's The
Iceman Cometh, but the deli
cate melancholy with which he
portrays them suggests Hans
Christian Andersen, and so do
the fairy-tale, finger-painted
art direction and photography.
The dramatis personae in
cludes a cuckold who plays fa
ther to all his whore-wife's
kids, a girl who constructs
paper flowers until she col
lapses from exhaustion, a
thief, an old sage, and — most
memorably — a dreamer and
his beggar son, who live in the
carcass of an ancient
abandoned car. Beautifully
acted and directed.
Plays Monday with Sandakan

leg, resorts to the endlessly in

teresting activity of watching
his neighbors through a pair of
high-powered binoculars. All
the vignettes are cliches, so
Hitchcock introduces them in
a big Broadway-musical-style
opening on the movie's single
set, and throughout the film he
employs them as interludes,
numbers. With Grace Kelly and
Raymond Burr.
Never Say Never Again
(1983)
Park, Menlo Park
This leisurely, laid-back spy
whirl, starring Sean Connery as
James Bond, may seem per
verse to those who go to it
seeking the thrills available in
the best parts of the The Spy
Who Loved Me and
Octopussy, but it's like taking
a marvelous vacation. Irvin
Kershner, the director, chose a
sly, relaxed style to match
Lorenzo Semple's script, in
which "M" (Edward Fox)
decides that Bond's taste for
rich food and drink has worn
him down, and so he sends
him to a health clinic. Kershner
works in such an unstressed
manner here, eschewing exci
tation techniques, that you're
not forced to notice how
beautifully designed and
structured each sequence is.
With a trio of class villains: Bar
bara Carrera, Klaus Maria Bran
dauer and Max Von Sydow.
Gandhi (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A three-and-a-quarter-hour
soporific. Richard Atten
borough doesn't have the right
qualities for epic filmmaking;
furthermore, out of either a
lack of personal resources or
an ascetic refusal to vulgarize
Gandhi's story, he resists turn
ing it into theater. And in the
process of purifying it of his
torical lumps, he has buried
much essential factual infor
mation and obfuscated the is
sues. Ben Kingsley brings a
fascinating mixture of under
stated passion and unpredicta
ble wit to the title role — he
humanizes the icon John
Briley's homiletic screenplay
sets up — but the rest of the
cast (John Gielgud, Edward
Fox, Trevor Howard, Martin
Sheen, Candice Bergen, lan
Charleson, Michael Hordern,
John Mills, etc., etc.) is just ex
pensive dressing.
Plays Sunday.

M*A»S»H* (1970)
Kresge Auditorium
Robert Altman's first
breakthrough was this classic
depiction of sane men and
madmen in a Korean War
medical unit. The stunning cast
includes Donald Sutherland
(who has never been better),
Elliott Could (who has been
better only once — in another
Altman film, The Long
Goodbye), Tom Skerritt, Sally
Kellerman, Robert Duvall,
Rene Auberjonois, and of
course Gary Burghof, who
survived the Korean War only
to re-enlist — in the TV version
of Ring Lardner, Jr.
adapted the Richard Hooker
novel (one of a series), though
much of the rapid-fire overlap
ping dialogue (the best since
His Cirl Friday) was obviously
improvised under Altman's su
pervision. Quite likely the fun
niest movie ever made about
war.
Plays tonight.
Stripes (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
Bill Murray joins the army.
Not a good movie, God knows,
but a fairly consistently funny
one, though the screenwriters
(Dan Goldberg, Len Blum and
Murray's co-star, Harold
Ramis) would have been
smarter to leave Murray and
the boys at home in the United
States — once they get to
Europe, the plot goes haywire
and the script runs out of
comic invention. Bill Murray is
priceless, as usual, and lohn
Candy gives him able support.
Also starring the late Warren
Oates; directed by Ivan Reit
man, who made Murray's first
picture, Meatballs.
Plays Sunday evening.
The Bitter Tears of Petra von
Kant (1972)
Terman Auditorium
In this eccentric chronicle of
a lesbian love affair, directed
by Rainer Werner Fassbinder,
the actresses (including Hanna
Schygulla) seem straitjacketed
by their jewelled, metallic
costumes, and their actions
and line readings are so
stylized that they begin to sug
gest sexual robots. Perhaps no
one since Fritz Lang in
Siegfried's Death has staged a
film in such an odd,
deliberately stilted fashion,
and (like the Lang silent) Petra

von Kant is so static that you
feel you'd kill for more camera
movement. Fassbinder's
reputation is based on his
audacity in making movies no
one else could possibly want
to make.
Plays Tuesday evening.
Dodes-ka'den (1970)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Akira Kurosawa set this
serene, lyrical film among the
poor in an unnamed city:
Paralyzed or muted by their
own fear and hardships, they
are reminiscent of the pipe
dreamers in O'Neill's The
Iceman Cometh, but the deli
cate melancholy with which he
portrays them suggests Hans
Christian Andersen, and so do
the fairy-tale, finger-painted
art direction and photography.
The dramatis personae in
cludes a cuckold who plays fa
ther to all his whore-wife's
kids, a girl who constructs
paper flowers until she col
lapses from exhaustion, a
thief, an old sage, and — most
memorably — a dreamer and
his beggar son, who live in the
carcass of an ancient
abandoned car. Beautifully
acted and directed.
Plays Monday with Sandakan
8.
O Lucky Man! (1973)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Lindsay Anderson spent two
years and a great deal of
money assembling this long (3-
hour) movie, which is really a
fairly unimaginative, unnerv
ingly insistent updated version
of Candide, with Malcolm
McDowell in the role of the in
nocent protagonist. It's a
passive starring part — all reac
tions — so he can't do much
with it, and a large, talented
supporting cast (Arthur Lowe,
Ralph Richardson, Rachel
Roberts, Helen Mirren, Mona
Washbourne, Dandy Nichols)
is wasted as well. David Sher
win wrote the script. The only
distinctions in the picture are
Miroslav Ondricek's photogra

phy and a series of Brechtian
musical interludes written and
performed by the winning Alan
Price.
Plays Tuesday with Britannia
Hospital.
You Can't Take It with You
(1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
George S. Kaufman and
Moss Hart wrote a wonderful
comedy about a family of non
conformists who manage
largely to ignore the Depres
sion, but Frank Capra wasn't
satisfied with it: He had Robert
Riskin rewrite it in the
glorified-little-man mode that
was Capra's trademark. It took
the Oscars for best picture and
best director, but it's overlong
(127 minutes), shamelessly
preachy, and not especially
well done. In beefed-up ver
sions of the hero and heroine
roles, Jimmy Stewart and Jean
Arthur salvage everything they
can (Riskin did write one
charming new scene for them,
set in a restaurant), and Mischa
'Auer makes a hilarious
Kolenkhov (the Russian dance
instructor). But Lionel Bar
rymore is no more convincing
as a lovable old codger here
than he would be as a
reprehensible old bastard in
Capra's It's a Wonderful Life
some years later. The cast also
includes Edward Arnold,
Spring Byington, Ann Miller,
Samuel S. Hinds, Donald
Meek, H.B. Warner, Halliwell
Hobbes, Mary Forbes, Dub
Taylor and Eddie Anderson.
Plays through Wednesday
with Dinner at Eight.
Dinner at Eight (1933)
Festival, Palo Alto
As a low-down married pair
— a couple of scrappers with
enough money to force their
way into high society — Jean
Harlow and Wallace Beery
steal this high-sheen comedy
melodrama away from John
Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore,
Marie Dressier, Billie Burke,

Reviews by Sieve Vineberg

Lee Tracy, Edmund Lowe,
Madge Evans and Jean Her
sholt. Frances Marion and Her
man J. Mankiewicz did a
stylish, professional job of
adapting a popular play by
George S. Kaufman and Edna
Ferber, and George Cukor di
rected it, smoothly and with
out pretension. This is a
surprisingly enduring example
of the kind ot star-studded,

multi-plotted, drawing room
extravaganza M-G-M prided it
self on being able to put out at
the rate of two or three a year
during the '30s.
Plays through Wednesday
with You Can't Take It with
You.

Rear Window (1954)
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's cele
brated thriller, out of distribu
tion for years, is so expertly
tooled and so absorbing that
you come out of the theater
grinning — despite the talky
script (John Michael Hayes,
out of a Cornell Woolrich

story) and almost unrelieved
bad acting in the supporting
roles. (Thelma Ritter is the
shining exception.) James
Stewart, an unlikely casting
choice, plays an adventurous
photojournalist who, laid up
for six weeks with a broken
leg, resorts to the endlessly in

teresting activity of watching
his neighbors through a pair of
high-powered binoculars. All
the vignettes are cliches, so
Hitchcock introduces them in
a big Broadway-musical-style
opening on the movie's single

employs them as interludes,
