"Whisky Six Yankee X-Ray Stanford, Whisky Six
Yankee X-Ray Stanford, Whisky Six," repeated the ham
radio operator trying to contact the space shuttle Co
lumbia.
Last night on the west side of campus a hopeful
group of amateur radio operators huddled around the
numerous pieces of equipment that till the low white
buildings used by the Ham Radio Club. They were at
tempting to make contact with Owen Carriot, a Stan
ford consulting professor of electrical engineering
aboard the space shuttle Columbia using his off time to
communicate with American amateur radio operators.
Carriot made the first contacts Wednesday night
when he chose five lucky operators out of thousands to

get a response. The club members were anxiously
awaiting the shuttle's "fly over" at approximately 6:24
p.m. — the best time for contact with the shuttle.
A few minutes after the hour, the machines were
tested. At about 6:10, the operator began transmitting
the call letters of the Stanford station, W6YX, in the
hope that possibly Garriot would be listening a little
early.
At various times throughout the week, Garriot will be
listening to 10 stations simultaneously and then res
ponding on one. The Stanford station is increasing its
odds of being heard by switching between the stations
and also by transmitting at a much higher than normal
wattage.
For the more than 100-mile range
at which the shuttle passes, the nor
mal wattage used for a ground-to
ground transmission is about one
watt. In order that the message be
significantly stronger, the Stanford
ham radio operators are transmit
ting the signal at about 200 watts.
Finally, Carriot said that he would
be listening for messages. For the
next minute and a half, the operator
transmitted a steady stream of call
letters.
After 80 seconds, the station was
switched to the frequency on which
the astronaut would transmit.
Carriot repeated the message for

the operators to transmit, but be
cause of numerous operators
"jamming" of the system, no fur
ther contact with the shuttle was
heard.
Visiting Sociology Prof. Henry
Mackler and Radio Club President
Henry Pasternak said that Garriot's
highly publicized communication
with amateur operators in the
United States demonstrates the im
portance and ease of communica
tion in the space age.
Over the duration of the shuttle's
flight this week, the club intends to
make more attempts at contact in
hope of recognition by the shuttle.
With each successive orbit,
however, the shuttle changes posi
tion and is moving gradually out of
the optimum orbit for communica
tion with American operators.
