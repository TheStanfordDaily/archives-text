# Reaching out to the shuttle
## Students attempt to contact Columbia astronauts

"Whisky Six Yankee X-Ray Stanford, Whisky Six
Yankee X-Ray Stanford, Whisky Six," repeated the ham
radio operator trying to contact the space shuttle Co
lumbia.
Last night on the west side of campus a hopeful
group of amateur radio operators huddled around the
numerous pieces of equipment that till the low white
buildings used by the Ham Radio Club. They were at
tempting to make contact with Owen Carriot, a Stan
ford consulting professor of electrical engineering
aboard the space shuttle Columbia using his off time to
communicate with American amateur radio operators.
Carriot made the first contacts Wednesday night
when he chose five lucky operators out of thousands to

get a response. The club members were anxiously
awaiting the shuttle's "fly over" at approximately 6:24
p.m. â€” the best time for contact with the shuttle.
A few minutes after the hour, the machines were
tested. At about 6:10, the operator began transmitting
the call letters of the Stanford station, W6YX, in the
hope that possibly Garriot would be listening a little
early.
At various times throughout the week, Garriot will be
listening to 10 stations simultaneously and then res
ponding on one. The Stanford station is increasing its
odds of being heard by switching between the stations
and also by transmitting at a much higher than normal
wattage.
