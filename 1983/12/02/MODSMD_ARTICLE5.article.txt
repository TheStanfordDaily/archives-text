# Students withhold taxes in protest
## 
### BOBAN MATHEW 
Despite threats of prosecution by
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),
students here associated with the
war-tax resistance movement con
tinue efforts to block government
military spending by refusing to pay
their taxes.
So far this year, six Northern Cali
fornia war-tax resisters have been
penalized by the IRS for "frivolous
filing" of income taxes — including
Matt Nicodemus, a senior majoring
in philosophy.
Nicodemus was fined $500 for
violating IRS code concerning em
ployment tax regulations.
Members of the war-tax resistance
movement contend that their ac
tions are a response to increased
military spending and refuse to pay
all or part of their taxes in protest.
in i/ip view of same people associ
ated with war-tax resistance, the
world is on the brink of self
destruction. They see their move
ment as one way of averting
catastrophe.
"There is no doubt in my mind
that fundamental changes can be
made," Nicodemus said. In a letter
he sent to the IRS on Nov. 10, 1983,
he stated: "... I refuse to pay any
more taxes to the U.S. government
as long as portions of those taxes are
spent on military activities that in
any way perpetrate violence against
brother and sister human beings."
The majority of those involved
with war-tax resistance assert that
the money they withhold is put to
good use. Some deposit their tax
money in specially created funds
such as the World Peace Fund.
Others employ what is referred to
as "self-taxation." They contribute
their tax money to "socially con
structive programs."
Some of those who are active in
war-tax resistance encourage every
one to carefully consider the man
ner in which the government all
ocates its resources and to make a
conscious decision as to whether or

not they wish their tax dollars to be
spent on defense
According to Annaloy Nickum, a
Palo Alto resident who plans to with
hold part of her tax money this
spring, if everyone refused to pay
taxes, "the government would he
forced to reevaluate its goals."
Many of those involved in the
movement, such as Nicodemus,
believe that it is possible to paralyze
the government without necessarily
crippling society.
Nicodemus claims that the funds
into which the tax money is
deposited could be used to provide
essential services. He maintains that
such a parallel structure is feasible
and, as an example, points to Poland
where such an organizational
structure is favored by Solidarity
leaders.
War-tax resistors range from out
right pacifists to those who oppose
only the development and deploy
ment of nuclear weapons. There is
no real consensus among those who
are associated with the movement
regarding the non-payment of taxes.
Some withhold a mere token of
taxes owed, while others refuse to
pay anv tax at all. A third group
believes in the non-payment of a
certain percentage of the taxes
owed. This percentage usually cor
responds to the percentage of the
total budget allocated to military
spending in general or to the nu
clear arsenal in particular.
Most of the people active in the
movement do not belong to any of
ficial war-tax resistance group.
However, several such organiza
tions do exist.
The Northern California War Tax
Resistance Committee, headquar
tered in Berkeley, is such an organi
zation. According to member Jim
Aires, the purpose of the Commit
tee is both "to spread the word of
non-militarism and to support those
who oppose militarism through the
non-payment of taxes."
