jury convicts Lavelle
Washington — Rita Lavelle, a former top official of
the Environmental Protection Agency, was convicted
of four criminal charges yesterday tor lying to
Congress about a conflict of interest in her manage
ment of the EPA's $1.6 billion superfund program
to clean up hazardous waste sites.
A federal jury of 10 women and two men aquitted
Lavelle, 36, of a separate perjury charge growing out
of her testimony to Congress that political consid
erations" never had affected her decisions.
But Lavelle, the first Reagan administration ap
pointee to be convicted of a telony, was found guilty
of twice giving false testimony to congressional

from the Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

committees. She had denied that she knew at an ear
ly date that her former employer, Aerojet-General
Corp. of La Jolla, Calif., was among 200 corporate
polluters of the Stringfellow Acid Pits in Riverside
County, Calif.
The jury also found her guilty of submitting a false
"statement of certification" to Congress about
when she first learned of Aerojet-General's involve
ment at Stringfellow. In connection with the same
matter, jurors convicted her of obstructing a con
gressional investigation.
Gemayel, Reagan seek solutions
Washington — Lebanese president Amin Gemavel,
emerging from a two-hour meeting with President
Reagan, said yesterday that the two leaders were

searching for new ways to gel Israeli and Syrian
forces out of Lebanon by "going beyond the letter"
of May 1 agreement with Israel, which has become
an obstacle to the withdrawal of Syrian troops.
Both Reagan and Gemayel, in their public state
ments following the meeting, declared continued
support for the Lebanese-Israeli agreement and for
the current peace talks between warring factions in
Lebanon. Reagan announced that his Middle East
envoy, Donald Rumsfeld, would be returning to
Lebanon soon to help with both.
Gemayel, who was starting a two-day round of in
tensive meetings with top U.S. officials, expressed
confidence that "actions properly conceived and ex
ecuted at this time" would achieve the withdrawal of
foreign forces from Lebanon. Officials of both na
tions refused to disclose what steps were under con
sideration.

Druze leader assassinated
Beirut, Lebanon — A man pretending to seek legal
advice walked into the apartment of Lebanon's top
Druze religious judge and assassinated him with a
silencer-equipped pistol yesterday. The army,
fearing revenge killings, clamped a curfew on Beirut
and warned that citizens earring arms would be
shot.
Druze gunners hammered Lebanese army posi
tions south of Beirut after the assassination and
snipers killed a French peacekeeping soldier near
the line separating Moslem west and Christian east
Beirut. But a truce held in Tripoli between loyalists
and rebels in the Palestine Liberation Organization.
There was no claim of responsibility for
Takieddine's murder.
Possible evolution link found
Washington — The remains of an apelike creature
16 million to 18 million years old, which scientists
said might be the long-sought common ancestor of
man and all great apes, have been discovered in a
weathered river channel in a desolate region of nor
thern Kenya, it was announced yesterday.
The find is considered significant because the esti
mated age of the fossils and their characteristics may
call into question existing ideas about how and
when humans evolved.
Vatican speaks on sex
Vatican City — The Vatican issued a statement on
sex education yesterday calling non-marital sexual
relations a grave and selfish disorder, and urging the
courts to protect the young from pornography in the
mass media.

primary role in sexual education and urged them to
become involved in shaping such programs in
schools. "Silence is not a valid form of conduct in
this matter," it added.
