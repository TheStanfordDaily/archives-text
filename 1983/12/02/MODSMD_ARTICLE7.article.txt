## New state loans offered to students 
### SHELLY WENTKER Staff Writer 
A new state-insured program aimed at
financing higher education costs now of
fers students and parents loans at 12 per
cent interest with up to five years to
repay according to a spokesman for the
California Student Loan Authority.
The new California Loans to Assist Stu
dents (CLAS) are available to parents of
undergraduates dependent on their par
ents, independent undergraduates who
do not receive parental support and
graduate students who borrow money on
their own behalf.
Douglas Coats, lender liaison for the
loan authority, said the only stipulations
are that the student be a permanent Cali
fornia resident or a U.S. citizen attending
a California institution of higher educa
tion.
Students and parents may borrow up to

$3000 at one time. Coats added that a
slightly lower $2500 level is set for
Guaranteed Student Loans (GSL) and
CLAS loans combined for independent
students. This limit is designed to insure
that students borrow in a "prudent" man
ner and do not incur excessive debts, he
said.
The Authority has been publicizing the
new loan.
"We have a lot of money to give out,"
Coats said, adding that a lack of public
knowledge has limited the number of
people applying for the CLAS loan to less
than the authority may accomodate.
Funded by $121 million ot tax-exempt
bond proceeds, the CLAS loans were first
made in April of this year. They were
developed to cut down on government
losses due to the "extremely expensive"
GSL program and also to "involve the par
ents," especially those who are required

to make large contributions yet do not
have a lot of liquid assets, Coats said.
Interest rates for the CLAS loan exceed
the 7 to 9 percent rates typically offered
under GSL program. But the GSL is
available only to students whose family
incomes are below $30,000 or who can
demonstrate a need for the money.
There are no income ceilings for the
CLAS loan. Coats explained that to qualify
it is necessary only to prove the ability to
repay the loan.
Repayment terms are another feature
that distinguishes the GSL from the CLAS.
The former allows the student to defer
repayment of the principal and interest
until the course of study is completed.
However, borrowers are required to
make payments within 60 days of taking
out CLAS loans. Full-time students must
pay interest, but can defer principal
repayment until after graduation.
