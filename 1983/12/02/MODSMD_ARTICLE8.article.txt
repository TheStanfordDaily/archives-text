The University recently
named a task force of stu
dents and faculty to review
the role of fraternities and
sororities here.
Business School Prof.
Oscar Serbein, the task
force chairman, said the
group is "just getting
started . . . and we haven't
resolved issues about sub
committees or our
schedule." Various options
for the review process are
open to the committee, but
no details have been an
nounced.

The committee consists
of six students and 10 Uni
versity faculty and staff
members. Appointments to
the task force were over
seen by Dean of Students
James Lyons.
According to Su Uhland,
a member of the Council of
Presidents and of the com
mittee, Lyons "wanted
someone from the COP,
someone in a fraternity,
someone in a sorority, an
RA (resident assistant) and
someone who wasn't in any
of those categories."
The committee has been
formed to review the Uni

versity's policy on fraternal
groups and to determine to
what extent fraternal organ
izations should be encour
aged or discouraged. Inter
est in joining fraternities
and sororities has in
creased in recent years,
and several new fraternal
groups have moved to
receive official University
recognition.
Committee meetings are
likely to begin the first
week of winter quarter. Ac -
cording to Uhland, the task
force will probably meet lb
times throughout the year
and will make recommen
dations in June 1984.
