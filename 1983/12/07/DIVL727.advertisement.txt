ELUSIVE GLUEBALL® FOUND AT
STANFORD
Have glueballs® been seen? Yes. They are found at the Stanford Bookstore and
elsewhere. The joining of any two will always give rise to an unambiguous
glueball®. Glueballs® are made up or different pairs of gluons® and are experimentally
distinguishable only by their color. Glueballs® can be split by the weakest of all Forces
found in Nature, i.e., the sub-adult force or child force. When a Glueball® is made to
collide head on with any hard smooth target surface, it will deform upon impact and
spread like a pancake it will then recover and with luck, it may split into separate
gluons""®. Glueballs® have strangely long lifetimes if you keep them clean. Glueballs®
are indeed a find of special significance. Glueballs® makes excellent gifts for those who
have everything.
