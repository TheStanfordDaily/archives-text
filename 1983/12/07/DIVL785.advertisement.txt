As microcomputers become more widespread in University
departments, there has been a surge of interest in "local area
networks" (LAN's). LAN's offer a way of linking microcomputers I
and sharing expensive equipment like printers and hard disks.
This seminar will describe on an introductory level:
• When microcomputer L AN's are useful • Compatibility issues
10 Current LAN products on the market • Costs
Third in a series of networking seminars sponsored by
Academic Computing and Information Systems (ACIS).
Based on preliminary results of a joint study by ACIS and ITS
(Information Technology Services).
