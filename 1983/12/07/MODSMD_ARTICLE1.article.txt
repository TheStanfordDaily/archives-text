# Surgeons request new donor policy

A heart transplant donor is a hard
thing to come by.
It's even harder here in Santa
Clara County, according to mem
bers of the Medical Center
transplant team, because the county
coroner's policy prohibits the use of
homicide victims as donors. They
want the coroner to change what
they think is an outdated mandate.
A recent case involving a Palo Alto
man who had been killed by a gun
shot wound in the head illustrates
the need for a new policy, according
to Phillip Oyer, senior member of
the transplant team. The Medical
Center wanted the slain man's heart
and the UC-San Francisco Medical
School wanted his two kidneys, but
the coroner refused both requests
on the grounds that the body would
be "physical evidence" in the case
of a trial.

Deputy Coroner John Fait
defended the policy, saying the
coroner had established it with the
help of the Medical Center Board of
Trustees.
"This policy was approved in
1969-1970 by the Board of Trustees,"
Fait said, "and never before this has
there been a protest from anyone at
Stanford concerning the proce
dure."
Oyer said Stanford has never
protested the policy but continues
to lequest the organs of homicide
victims.
Fait explained that he turns down
"several" requests for organs each
year because of the coroner's
policy. The reason behind this, he
explained, hinges on the delicate
nature of "brain death" and the
logistics of a murder trial.
A patient who is declared "brain
dead" is still technically alive if his
body is kept on a life-support sys
tem. Such a system would be neces
sary to preserve the heart of a
donor, and the donor would only
become entirely lifeless when he
was removed from machines.
"The question becomes, Who
killed the man — the murderer or
the man who pulled the plug?' " Fait
said. He said it is conceivable that a
defense attorney would bring this
up during a trial.
"It would be almost impossible to
prove first-degree murder if this was
argued," he said.
Oyer said that the coroner's
policy originally approved by the

Med Center trustees has since
become obsolete. "The brain-death
controversy is a question that has
been pretty well legally settled, " he
said, explaining that recent legisla
tion declaring a person legally dead
as soon as brain activity ceases
makes the "who killed the man"
question entirely unfounded.
The coroner prohibits the use not
only of homicide victims as donors
but also accident victims, Oyer said.
Oyer said he was not sure how
Santa Clara's policy could be
changed. The state law concerning
organ donors says that each county
coroner has individual jurisdiction.
Oyer said coroners in most of the
surrounding counties have decidec
to allow homicide victims to be usee
as donors.
