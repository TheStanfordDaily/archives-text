# Alarms at Meyer, GSB libraries
## Students respond slowly 
### DIANE PATTERSON 
Slow student response to fire alarms at
Meyer Library and the Jackson Library in the
Business School last week has raised ques
tions about the degree to which students are
aware of emergency procedures.
Observers at Meyer last Wednesday night
reported that it took 10 minutes for students
to exit the main building after the sounding
of the alarm, which turned out to be false.
Cathy Fehrn, the library's office manager,
said this delay was due to the fact that
"when the alarm goes off, everybody heads
for the main stairwell. Instantly you've got
congestion."
Fehrn said employees on duty tried to get
people to use the plainly marked emergency
exits, but no one did.
After finally exiting the library building,
most students stayed in the lobby instead of
going outside to one of the two emergency
assembly points located at the northeast and
southeast corners of the building, she said.
"Students should move away, as the fire
could be anywhere," Fehrn said.
Freshman Nicole Lazzaro, who was in
Meyer when the alarm went off, said she
didn't see any library staffers instructing
people in the library on what to do and that
there was no announcement over the
loudspeaker system. Many students thought
it was just a drill and "some would have
stayed until they smelled smoke," she said.
At Jackson Library, also on Wednesday

night, the students inside took about "five
or six minutes" to evacuate, according to
Michael Frary, the head of public service for
the library. People are "inured" to the
sound of the fire alarm and "they expect it
to be a false alarm," Frary said.
This sort of apathetic response is fairly
normal for students at a library, according to
Roy Stampfli, the facilities head of building
and business services for the libraries. Stu
dents tend to view evacuation "as an incon
venience rather than a necessity, especially
during Dead Week," he said.
The only long-term precautionary mea
sure that can be taken at the libraries,
Stampfli said, is to inform the staff of what
steps should be taken in an emergency. Not
much can be done directly to make the li
brary users aware of what needs to be done,
Stampfli said, "because of the continual
change of students."
Linda Kalm, the senior who coordinated
the evacuation drill program, agrees with
the idea that it is difficult to educate the
"transient crowd of libraries." Using the j
loudspeakers in an emergency is "a function j
of the individual libraries. But you don't [
want to rely on that because there might bt
a power outage."
Students should use their own good judg
ment, she said, because real interest in what
to do in a situation like last Wednesday's
comes after the fact.
