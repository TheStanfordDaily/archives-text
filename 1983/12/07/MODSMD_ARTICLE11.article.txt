# Achievement linked to course level
## Segregation of higher and lower achievers found 
### BOB BARCKLAY Staff writer 
A recent study conducted by Stanford
doctoral students on California high
schools indicates a large discrepancy be
tween the number of academic courses
taken by high-achieving students and
others at a lower level.
While high-achieving students still
benefit from the predominantly academic
course load of the college-prep track, stu
dents at lower achievement levels are
taking less than half of their coursework
in academic areas, the study said.
Entitled "California High School Curric
ulum Study: Paths Through High
School," the report is a statistical and nar
rative database from which coordinators
plan to analyze the California high school
system.
Nancy Sanders, a doctoral student in
the School of Education, began the proj
ect two years ago at the request of the
California State Department of Education.

According to Sanders, the Department of
Education had previously had no organ
ized method from which to analyze the
conditions of public high schools.
"When the legislature asked the de
partment questions about public high
schools they would run out and look at a
single high school," Sanders said. "They
were not aware of the diversity between
schools."
Sanders was joined later by another
doctoral student, Nancy Stone, and the
two of them were the principal coordina
tors of the project.
In an interview with The Daily, Sanders
and Stone commented on their study —
specifically, on the problems encoun
tered by students at lower achievement
levels.
"Those kids on the bottom are really
forgotten," Sanders said about students
that are not in college-prep courses. The
study indicates that most teachers prefer
to teach brighter students and often had

difficulties planning courses for the lower
track.
"It's hard to comprehend what these
teachers (at lower levels) face," Stone
said.
The researchers noted that the lower
level curricula, unlike courses for the
high-achievers, do not have a consistent
structure to follow.
While the curricula of high level
courses are set outside the high school
bureaucracy by colleges, researchers
said, "No such clear expectations are
communicated to schools and students at
lower achievement levels."
Problems with school curricula are
partly a result of social conditions outside
the school, according to Stone, who said
there is a "socio-economic basis" for the
college-prep track. She hinted that the
parents of the affluent will not let their
children be in anything but the high-level
track.
I he college-prep track is "not
necessarily comprised of the bright
est students," Stone explained.
Dr. Philip Fisher, an English
teacher at Aragon High School in
San Mateo, said lower level courses
have a "socially denigrated kind of
stigma' to which middle- or higher
class parents respond. Fisher agreed
that curriculum in the lower tracks is
a problem, but suggested that there
are students in the academic track
who should not be there.
Fisher explained that there are a
number of parents who force their
children into the college-prep track
and a professional or white-collar
career.
For those who are not motivated,
Fisher suggested looking at "viable
alternatives that parents must be
willing to accept."
Fisher advocated the idea of a

trade school as well as giving stu
dents a chance to mature and
choose academics it they are
motivated to do so.
High-level work is partly a matter
of intelligence and a great deal of
hard work. There are some students
who may not be brilliant, but are
willing to do the work, I isher said.
"At the same time, there are very
bright students who are not as
motivated."
The study found the success rates
of minority students to be
"significantly less than that of
whites," while minorities' entry into
post-secondary institutions "has not
increased substantially over the past
decade." At the same time, the
minority population in California
has been increasing continually.
Along those same social lines,
Sanders and Stone felt that the
public school system has had to
satisfy needs that were traditionally
fulfilled by the family or community
organizations.
