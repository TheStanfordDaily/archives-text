# Row manager's grievance to be heard
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
The Dec. 15 grievance
hearing for the recently fired
director of Row Facilities
promises to be unusual — not
as an example of grievance
procedure, but because of the
nature of Heloisa Edwards'
termination and the way in
which she worked.
Row Director Diana Conklin
said that Edwards' achieve
ments were less in question
than her procedure. "I knew
for a long time that there were
concerns with her methods,"
she said, "among both the ad
ministration and the stu
dents."
Conklin explained that it
was mainly Edwards'
"decision-making process"
that caused concern: her ten
dency to go ahead and do

something in an untraditional
manner or without consulting
her superiors.
"She actually seems to have
done a good job," said Om
budsperson John Goheen.
Edwards', termination came
after she used money from the
Row budget to hire extra help
for the recent Physicians for
Social Responsibilty confer
ence held on campus, and
used the Row truck to haul
supplies for the same event.
She was charged with misap
propriation of University
funds and property, according
to her letter of termination.
"Basically, they considered
it a case of insubordination,"
Goheen said. Goheen ex
plained that he was
"sympathetic" to Edwards'
grievance.
"There are many people

concerned about her getting a
fair trial," he said. "She seems
to have a great deal of sup
port."
When asked if he thought
Edwards' termination had
causes other than the PSR inci
dent, Goheen said he was sure
there were "underlying
causes."
"Of course, they're bound
to come out during the
hearing," he added. Goheen
said that he could not disclose
the nature of Edwards' griev
ance because of the upcoming
hearing, but he thought it did
raise "serious questions about
procedure" inside of the Uni
versity.
Terry McGovern, the
Housing Facilites manager
who was responsible for the
termination of Edwards, was
also unwilling to discuss the

case. He stressed that Univer
sity regulations concerning
personnel made it impossible
to discuss the firing of an em
ployee.
"Heloisa is perfectly free to
discuss her case," he said,
"but I'm not at liberty."
One of Edwards' charges in
her grievance is sexual dis
crimination. In regard to this
charge, McGovern did say that
the two previous Row
Facilities managers were
female.
After her termination, Ed
wards was given only hours to
vacate her office and turn in
her office key, instead of the
typical two weeks' notice. Al
though Coheen said that this
seemed like an "extreme ac
tion," McGovern said it was
merely standard University
procedure. He cited a clause in
employee-management contracts
which stated that "employees dis
charged will receive two weeks ot
notice or pay in lieu of notice."
The Housing Facilities department
is under review, and it is possible
that Edwards' position could be
eliminated before her grievance is
finished.
There are presently four facilities
management positions, and Ed
wards was the third of four
managers hired. But McGovern said
this does not mean she has seniority
over the fourth manager.
According to Coheen, the "real
story" behind the Edwards case lies
in the reaction of students to her
termination. McGovern also said
that there has been a lot of student
feedback — three different petitions
have circulated around the Row,
and about 50 percent of the students
in three houses have signed them.
One of the originators of the peti
tions, Jim DeLaHunt, described stu
dent reaction to Edwards as over
whelmingly positive. According to
DeLaHunt, the row was in shambles
before Edwards stepped in and
recarpeted, repainted and repaired
houses.
"Our house manager has lived on
the Row for eight years — he says
that sometimes he doesn't even rec
ognize the place, it looks so good,"
he said.
DeLahunt also cited Edwards' wil
lingness to work on things outside
of her department.

After her termination, Ed
wards was given only hours to
vacate her office and turn in
her office key, instead of the
typical two weeks' notice. Al
though Coheen said that this
seemed like an "extreme ac
tion," McGovern said it was
merely standard University
procedure. He cited a clause in
employee-management contracts
which stated that "employees dis
charged will receive two weeks ot
notice or pay in lieu of notice."
The Housing Facilities department
is under review, and it is possible
that Edwards' position could be
eliminated before her grievance is
finished.
There are presently four facilities
management positions, and Ed
wards was the third of four
managers hired. But McGovern said
this does not mean she has seniority
over the fourth manager.
According to Coheen, the "real
story" behind the Edwards case lies
in the reaction of students to her
termination. McGovern also said
that there has been a lot of student
feedback — three different petitions
have circulated around the Row,
and about 50 percent of the students
in three houses have signed them.
One of the originators of the peti
tions, Jim DeLaHunt, described stu
dent reaction to Edwards as over
whelmingly positive. According to
DeLaHunt, the row was in shambles
before Edwards stepped in and
recarpeted, repainted and repaired
houses.
"Our house manager has lived on
the Row for eight years — he says
that sometimes he doesn't even rec
ognize the place, it looks so good,"
he said.
DeLahunt also cited Edwards' wil
lingness to work on things outside
of her department.
