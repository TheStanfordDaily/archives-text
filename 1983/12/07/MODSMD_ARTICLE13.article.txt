## The 						Illiberal Academy

1 .iheral nits universities, in case
ymi hadn't uoiiced, aren't so liberal
any more. 'Liberal" is here used in
the old-fashioned. Webster's Dictio
nary sense: open minded, inquisitive,
broadly coin ei tied. By this usage, we
suppose, acadetuia (cased to be lib
etal sometime between the Spanish
Civil War and the publication of "God
and Man at Yale." Hut lately the uni
versity's intolerance has taken an es
pecially nasty turn. Whilelt's danger
ous to generalize about all univers
ities, clearly the Stanford and Ya[e
cases discussed in editorials below
are anything but isolated examples.
At Harvard last week, the secre
tary of defense, a Harvard graduate,
was. in essence, assaulted-with such
epithets as "war criminal" and with
packets of ketchup, dye and blood and
other projectiles. He joins a distin
guished list - Hubert McNamara,
.leiry Falwell, William F. Buckley,
.leaiie Kirkpatrick—of those who have
been so honored by our great univers
ities. What is the meaning of aca
demic freedom If. say. the ambassa
dor to the United Nations Is unwel
come if not unacceptable as a com
mencement speaker?
Then there is the matter of some
r»()odd campus newspapers that now
attack university administrations
from tin' right. Al Dartmouth, a stu
dent passing out one of these journals
was punched, kicked and bitten by an
(Mlf r;igrrl achtntl *Khninlstrutor. The
day this official pleaded guilty to as
sault in a local court, the faculty
voted to censure . . . the newspa
per!
Dissident publications at the Uni
versity of California at San Diego.
Princeton and Yale have also been
singled out for tough treatment. The

common complaint against the stu
dent papers, some of which have been
unrestrained in attacking liberal pi
eties. is that they ate in "bad taste."
j No similar complaint was voiced by
college faculties in the lL)t>()s. when
protesters could be seen draping flugs
as loin cloths. "Nor is it heard today,
when left-wing student papers refer to
Ronald Reagan as a "fascist" or, at
the University of Pennsylvania, sug
gest that it's too bad Hinckley
missed.
Another accusation, leveled for ex
ample at the Hoover Institution, is
that the new dissenters threaten to
politicize" tin' campus. Coining fiom
the people who organize freeze rallies,
resist-lhe-draft centers and abortion
clinics using university and federal
funds, this is truly brazen.
What seems to be going on is a
kind of retreat by the liberal, which is
to say illiberal, elite. The left is un
able to win through the ballot box,
overwhelmed by the tragic conse
quences of our defeat in Vietnam, by
the ravages of inflation at home and
more recently by the success of Rea
ganomics and the lessons of Grenada.
But the mentality of the 1960s has en
trenched itself in the sanctuary of the
universities, where its desperation
would be comic if the values univers
ities supposedly represent were not so
important. The culture needs some
bustiim where clutlleiiffcrs of the con
ventional wisdom can flourish without
being sued, fired, bitten or beaned
with juicy vegetables, and tradition
ally this bastion has been the univer
sity. But we may be learning that old
style liberalism, which is to say aca
demic freedom; is too important to be
left to-professors.
