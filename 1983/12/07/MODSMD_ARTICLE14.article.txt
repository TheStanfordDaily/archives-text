The University Boaid of Trustees will sit
down Monday to decide whether Stanford will
become the home for a Ronald Reagan library,
museum and center tor public affairs. The deci
sion will culminate months of campuswide
debate and almost two years of behind-the
scenes negotiations between the University
and the Reagan adminstration.
Reagan and the Hoover Institution have
handed the University an all-or-nothing pack
age threatening to withdraw the whole deal
without Hoover control over the policy center.
Faced with the prospect of losing this valuable
academic resource, the Board is under a great
deal of pressure to accede to the administra
tion's demands. We hope that unless a suitable
compromise — one in which the University
does have control over the public affairs center
— is reached between University officials and
the White House today in Washington, the
Board will keep the best interests of the Uni
versity in mind and will reject the package as it
is now proposed.
If we are going to have a Reagan center for
public affairs at Stanford, it should be placed
under the traditional University academic
governance process and not under the quasi
independent Hoover Institution. If it is to be
called the Reagan policy center at Stanford it
should contribute to academic projects through

out the University rather than being an island
of independent research. It the policv center is
to bear Stanford's name, it should be a Univer
sity affair.
Moreover, to increase Hoover's influence
after last spring's Faculty Senate resolution call
ing for an investigation ot Hoover's relation
ship with the University would be ridiculous. It
does not serve the best interest of the Univer
sity to house an undeniably partisan think tank
on campus. Simply put, expanding the towels
control over campus research projects is simp
ly not a prudent move.
Members of the Stanford community have
spoken with an almost single voice on this
issue during the past three months. University
President Donald Kennedy, a unanimous Fac
ultv Senate, an ad-hoc faculty committee, and
the ASSU have all stated clearly that while the
Reagan library will be a tremendous academic
resource to the University, the complex should
be integrated into the academic structure. Ken
nedy, Board President William Kimball and
trustee Frank Tatum fly to Washington today in
an effort to explain Stanford's position. We
hope an agreement can be reached. But if the
Reagan administration continues its power
play, the University must send a strong
message that Stanford will do it its way, or not
at all.
