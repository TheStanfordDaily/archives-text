The provost's office received a double shock
this fall. First, Provost Albert Hastorf an
nounced his intention to resign effective next
August and to return to the classroom. Then
Vice Provost Herant Katchadourian, the Uni
versity's top academic officer for undergraduate
education, announced his intention to return
to full-time teaching and research next Sep
tember.
The search committee to fill these positions
has a formidable task before it: to find dedi
cated scholars who will be able to take the
places of the well-liked and respected Hastorf
and Katchadourian.
And until their successors are found, the
University faces a potentially dangerous lack of
senior academic officials.
Katchadourian spent six of his eight adminis
trative years in the dual role of vice provost and
dean of undergraduate studies. He was in
strumental in instituting the senior survey, the
curriculum study, the cohort study and restruc
turing the distribution requirements.
Hastorf was the prime mover behind the in
itiation of the Western Culture program,
restructured the administration of undergradu

ate education programs and planned the lan
guage, economics and space science centers
here on campus.
The University should search for individuals
who are just as committed to maintaining the
importance of undergraduate education. In an
institution increasingly dedicated to graduate
education and research, it is refreshing to find
officials such as Hastorf and Katchadourian
who are committed to improving the quality of
undergraduate teaching.
In addition, the search committee should
not feel restricted to finding replacements
within the University. A hearty look for
academics outside of Stanford who are dedi
cated to the ideals of undergraduate education
would be in the best interests of the University.
The search committee cannot deny the
benefits of bringing a fresh perspective to
these posts.
Finding worthy candidates for provost —
whether from inside or outside the University
— will not be easy. But the University has
found such individuals in the past; the search
committee's task is to ensure that this tradition
continues.
