# Hang the death penalty
## 
### 
Proponents of capital punishment had some
thing to cheer about last week. Robert Sullivan,
a convicted murderer who spent 10 years on
Death Row, was executed in Florida's electric
chair after an appeal to the Supreme Court and
a plea by Pope John Paul II proved futile. We
wonder how many proponents would still be
cheering if 100 persons convicted of murder
were executed last week? 500? Our guess is
that the number of death penalty advocates
would decrease as executions increased, and
we question the fairness of advocating the
death penalty for anyone.
The United States has the distinction of
being one of only a few Western countries to
maintain capital punishment. We are joined,
however, by the Soviet Union, Iran, Libya, etc.
Some proponents say the death penalty is nec
essary to stop murder. We also are a leader
among Western countries when it comes to
murder rates.
Of course, the deterrence question is not so
simple, and there are statistics galore on both
sides. What is troubling is that so many people
are willing to support capital punishment with
out any clear proof that it deters murder and
without really worrying about whether it does.
A lot of people favor the death penalty, whe
ther they admit it or not, because it makes
them feel good. If someone commits one of
the most grievous crimes — wiping out the life
of an innocent victim — we should make them
sorry for it. By killing them, right?

Not so fast. What our gut feelings may tell us
does not always make for a sound legal system.
First, there is the chance of mistake. The death
penalty, unlike a prison sentence, is irrever
sible. Second, retribution should not be the
guiding principle of our law. Deterrence and
isolating criminals have societal benefits.
Retribution, especially when it means killing,
does not benefit our civilized society. Finally,
the death penalty, the most severe punish
ment, is also the most discriminatory. Only a
handful of convicted murderers ever get it.
And of those who do, it is much more likely
their victim was white, according to recent fin
dings by a Stanford acting associate professor
of law.
Death penalty proponents can react to the
discrimination charge by arguing that mur
derers subject themselves to the small risk or
by advocating more executions. The former
response is unfair and unproductive, since
with only a small risk any deterrence that might
exist is substantially weakened.
The suggestion that we simply execute more
people brings us back to last week. The execu
tion of one Robert Sullivan may not disturb
anyone much. Daily executions would be
harder to swallow. Do we really want our gov
ernment in the mass murder business? Or do
we just want to knock off a Robert Sullivan
once in awhile to make us feel good. Neither is
anything to cheer about.
