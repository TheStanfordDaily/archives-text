# Stuffing the stockings
## 
### 
The best part of the holiday season is the
giving and the getting. In fact, we're so excited,
we can't wait for the festivities to roll around.
The spirit of St. Nick has hit us, and we're
teeming with generosity.
And so before we lose that ho-ho-holiday
fervor, we want to deck the University halls
with boughs of folly. Here's how we'd stuff
some famous stockings:
Donald Kennedy — a Donald Kennedy
Presidential Library, Museum and Center for
Public Affairs.
Jeanne Kennedy — a 'My husband went to the
White House and all I got was this lousy T-shirt'
T-shirt;
John Manley — a bust of W. Glenn Campbell
for his mantle and a Hoover Tower keychain;
W. Glenn Campbell — a bust of John Manley for
his mantle and a portrait of Ronald Rebholz;
Alphonse Juilland — free ads in every Daily;
Luke Cole, Robert Larkins and Matt Nicodemus —
a press secretary;
Steven Mosher — free legal counseling,

Jack Elway — a crew cut and a Stanford blazer;
Paul Wiggin — an office in the Athletic Depart
ment and a pack of cigarettes;
John Elway — a one-way ticket to Baltimore;
Andy Geiger — a pocket calculator and a friend
at ABC;
The Band — a scrapbook for their clippings;
The football team — help;
The basketball team — a designated free throw
shooter;
Alice Supton — a bottle of warm milk . . . with a
twist;
Heloisa Edwards — an interview appointment at
the CPPC;
Jim McGrath — a hotline to the ASSU offices
Al Hastorf — a gold watch;
The peddlers in White Plaza — a customer;
The Marines in Lebanon — a ticket home;
President Reagan — a brain, a heart, some
courage . . . and an opportunity to click his
heels and land in Lawrence, Kansas.
yhere — the giving's done. Feliz Navidad,
Happy Hanukkah, Happy New Year and all
that.
