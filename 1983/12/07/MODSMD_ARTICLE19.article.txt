# Make dead week Fred week
## 
### 
Is Dead Week getting you down?
Do you have four finals to study for,
two papers to write and a fully
functional robot duplicate of your
self to construct for your engineer
ing class? You might be wondering
just how you're going to make it
through the week.
Quit whining. Everyone else has
the same problems. At least you
don't have to write newspaper
columns during Dead Week. And
besides, a few simple hints can turn
Dead Week from a frightening, out
of-control death machine into a hap
py, magical time you'll want to tell
the grandkids about.
•Coffee. There's nothing like coffee
to keep you awake when you have
to study. Well, there is airplane
glue.
However, overdoses of coffee
rarely cause permanent brain
damage. You may, however, experi
ence a temporary case of "coffee
psychosis." Students who suffer
from this often believe that Mr. Cof
fee is actually a sinister mind control
device invented by the Soviets, and
tend to take everything Robert
Young says very seriously.
• The Library. The only one that
won't be full during Dead Week is
the Reagan library. It's probably too
late now, but next quarter plan
ahead and claim a library seat two or
three weeks before Dead Week. Be
sure to bring books, paper, a sleep
ing bag and at least enough food to
last until finals. Once you have se
cured a desk, going to the bathroom
is strongly discouraged.
If the librarians ask you to leave
because the library is closing, tell
them you're a bat. If they don't
believe you, bite them.
• Flunking. Students should remem
ber that only a few more days
remain to fail courses in which they

are receiving less than a B-f. If you
do not do poorly enough on the
final to fail a course and get it
removed from your record, you may
have to physically intimidate a pro
fessor into giving you a failing
grade.
• See a movie. Co to a play. Listen to
one of President Reagan's speeches.
Anything that gets your mind off
reality is helpful.

Between last-minute
assignments and early
finals, Dead Week has
shrunk to 47 minutes
late Wednesday
afternoon.

• Leave. Don't think of it as dropping
all your classes. Think of it as stop
ping out retroactively. Stopping out
can be a valuable experience, giving
one a chance, in a non-academic en
vironment, to decide what direction
one's life is going in.
With only a week and a half left in
the quarter, you may not be able to
travel through Europe, start a mil
lion dollar computer business or
overthrow a Latin American dictator
ship. But you will get a jump on all
the other students trying to get
Christmas jobs at Woolworth's.
•Sniping. It's a great way to release
pent-up frustrations. It can be put to
constructive purposes as well. I
don't want to condone terrorism,
but when freshmen go outside and
scream at midnight, I'd feel better if
I knew someone was on the roof
with a high-powered rifle.

•The Moonies. Has it ever occured to
you that these guys might be right.
Joining a cult might not help you
pass your calculus final, but it'll sure
make your parents forget about
your grades.
"Fine," you might say. "But what
is Dead Week?"
Alas, this response is all too com
mon. Between last-minute assign
ments and early finals, Dead Week
has shrunk to 47 minutes late Wed
nesday afternoon. It is so short that
many people, including many pro
fessors, don't even know it exists.
But how can Dead Week be im
proved? One plan calls for the fol
lowing changes: Professors who as
sign homework during Dead Week
would be killed. Anyone who
schedules an event during Dead
Week would be killed. Any student
who attends class during Dead
Week would be publicly flogged.
Anyone listening to rock-and-roll
music would be killed.
This plan has proven remarkably
successful in Iranian universities.
Dead Week could also be helped
by a change of name. After all, we
don't want to give any would-be
suicides any ideas. Since Dead
Week is a time of fanatic devotion to
studying, it should be renamed in
honor of the one thing that all Stan
ford students are fanatically devoted
to: Dead Week should become Fred
Week.
One final note: Next year will be
1984. Since this will be the gist of all
newspaper and magazine articles for
the next two months, I have just
saved you the trouble of reading
over Christmas vacation.

vironment, to decide what direction
one's life is going in.
With only a week and a half left in
the quarter, you may not be able to
travel through Europe, start a mil
lion dollar computer business or
overthrow a Latin American dictator
ship. But you will get a jump on all
the other students trying to get
Christmas jobs at Woolworth's.
•Sniping. It's a great way to release
pent-up frustrations. It can be put to
constructive purposes as well. I
don't want to condone terrorism,
but when freshmen go outside and
scream at midnight, I'd feel better if
I knew someone was on the roof
with a high-powered rifle.

•The Moonies. Has it ever occured to
you that these guys might be right.
Joining a cult might not help you
pass your calculus final, but it'll sure
make your parents forget about
your grades.
"Fine," you might say. "But what
is Dead Week?"
Alas, this response is all too com
mon. Between last-minute assign
ments and early finals, Dead Week
has shrunk to 47 minutes late Wed
nesday afternoon. It is so short that
many people, including many pro
fessors, don't even know it exists.
But how can Dead Week be im
proved? One plan calls for the fol
lowing changes: Professors who as
sign homework during Dead Week
would be killed. Anyone who
schedules an event during Dead
Week would be killed. Any student
who attends class during Dead
Week would be publicly flogged.
Anyone listening to rock-and-roll
music would be killed.
This plan has proven remarkably
successful in Iranian universities.
Dead Week could also be helped
by a change of name. After all, we
don't want to give any would-be
suicides any ideas. Since Dead
Week is a time of fanatic devotion to
studying, it should be renamed in
honor of the one thing that all Stan
ford students are fanatically devoted
to: Dead Week should become Fred
Week.
One final note: Next year will be
1984. Since this will be the gist of all
newspaper and magazine articles for
the next two months, I have just
saved you the trouble of reading
over Christmas vacation.

Is Dead Week getting you down?
Do you have four finals to study for,
two papers to write and a fully
functional robot duplicate of your
self to construct for your engineer
ing class? You might be wondering
just how you're going to make it
through the week.
Quit whining. Everyone else has
the same problems. At least you
don't have to write newspaper
columns during Dead Week. And
besides, a few simple hints can turn
Dead Week from a frightening, out
of-control death machine into a hap
py, magical time you'll want to tell
the grandkids about.
•Coffee. There's nothing like coffee
to keep you awake when you have
to study. Well, there is airplane
glue.
However, overdoses of coffee
rarely cause permanent brain
damage. You may, however, experi
ence a temporary case of "coffee
psychosis." Students who suffer
from this often believe that Mr. Cof
fee is actually a sinister mind control
device invented by the Soviets, and
tend to take everything Robert
Young says very seriously.
• The Library. The only one that
won't be full during Dead Week is
the Reagan library. It's probably too
late now, but next quarter plan
ahead and claim a library seat two or
three weeks before Dead Week. Be
sure to bring books, paper, a sleep
ing bag and at least enough food to
last until finals. Once you have se
cured a desk, going to the bathroom
is strongly discouraged.
If the librarians ask you to leave
because the library is closing, tell
them you're a bat. If they don't
believe you, bite them.
• Flunking. Students should remem
ber that only a few more days
remain to fail courses in which they

are receiving less than a B-f. If you
do not do poorly enough on the
final to fail a course and get it
removed from your record, you may
have to physically intimidate a pro
fessor into giving you a failing
grade.
• See a movie. Co to a play. Listen to
one of President Reagan's speeches.
Anything that gets your mind off
reality is helpful.

Between last-minute
assignments and early
finals, Dead Week has
shrunk to 47 minutes
late Wednesday
afternoon.

• Leave. Don't think of it as dropping
all your classes. Think of it as stop
ping out retroactively. Stopping out
can be a valuable experience, giving
one a chance, in a non-academic en
vironment, to decide what direction
one's life is going in.
