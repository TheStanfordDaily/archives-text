# Library decision: the final days
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
When top University and White
House officials sit down over lunch
today in Washington, D.C., they will
be trying — for perhaps the last time
— to strike a compromise that
would bring the Reagan presidential
library complex to Stanford.

News analysis

Untii last week, chances of their
making a deal seemed slim. What
stood — and continues to stand —
in the way of agreement was the
sharp difference of opinion over the
question of whether a Reagan cen
ter for public affairs ought to be
governed by the University or the
Hoover Institution.
The University has said that it
should run the center, and has
warned that a Hoover-run center
would have "little chance of ap
proval by the Board of Trustees."
The White House, however, has
warned that the University's ruling
out of an administrative role of the
Hoover Institution "is tantamount
to making the president 'an offer he
cannot accept.' "
While those differences remain,
comments last week from key
Hoover and University officials and
the fact that today's meeting is
taking place seem to indicate that
there has been a softening of the in
transigence, and a resolution may
be within reach.
The meeting, requested by Board
of Trustees President William Kim
ball last week and arranged by the
White House on Sunday, will be
held in the White House this mor
ning. Kimball, University President
Donald Kennedy and trustee Frank

Tatum will meet with Presidential
Counselor Edwin Meese and others
in the first face-to-face meeting be
tween the two sides.
The White House has made no
public comment about the meeting.
But Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell, who is close to the presi
dent and others in the administra
tion, released an unusually tem
perate statement that Hoover
sources emphasized had been "very
carefully put together."
Campbell said he deeply
regretted the Faculty Senate's sup
port of the idea that if a public affairs
center is to be a part of the complex,
it should be governed by the Uni
versity. But noticeably absent was
any reassertion of the Hoover insis
tence that it be given governance,
and the statement seemed to indi
cate that Hoover may be willing to
stray from that position.
"I hope that in the critical days
ahead there can be a concerted ef
fort on the part of the Hoover Insti
tution, Stanford University and the
Board of Trustees to bring the
deliberations ... to a successful
conclusion," Campbell said.
"Having a presidential library
complex associated with Stanford is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Unless an immediate effort is made
to resolve the remaining differ
ences, this opportunity may slip
away. If that happens, an unparal
leled academic resource will have
been lost to the University."
From the University too, there
have been signs of possible compro
mise. "We're going with what we
hope will be an acceptable pro
posal," Board of Trustees President
William Kimball said last Thursday in
telling the Stanford News Service of
the proposed meeting in the White
House. He said "some elements" in
the University position had
changed.
While University President
Donald Kennedy said later that the
position remained the same as it has
always been, he, like Kimball,
refused to rule out the possibility of
that stance being modified.
"We disagree on one feature,"
Kennedy told students at Thursday
evening appearance before students
at Branner Hall, emphasizing that
the University and White House
agree on the proposed presidential
library and museum.
"A question before us is whether
in sitting down and discussing this
we can find some flexibility . . . .
You've got to try these things," he
said. "I don't at the moment know
what the form of a compromise
might take, but I think it's our re
sponsibility to explore."
Kennedy's opposition to a
Hoover-run center, like that of Kim
ball and the Faculty Senate, has
been on the grounds that a public
affairs center should make a signifi
cant contribution to the teaching
and research activities of the Univer
sity and should be "part of
(Stanford's) normal academic and
administrative structure."
The Hoover Institution and the
White House have countered that
governance by Hoover would be
most logical because it already is ex
perienced in running a policy re
search institution, and because it
made the proposal and would raise
the funds to bring the presidential
complex here.
Knowledgable observers have
said that if any compromise is
reached, it would most likely in
clude University governance of the
public affairs center along with as
surances to the Hoover Institution
that its members would make up a
substantial minority of the oversight
board.
Whether or not any agreement is
reached tomorrow, the Board of
Trustees will take up the matter at its
meeting next Monday and Tuesday.
