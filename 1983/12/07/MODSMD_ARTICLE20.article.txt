## LOTS: the big non-sleep 
### 
The name is Spade. Sandra Spade.
It was turning into a really weird
quarter. My roommates barely
recognized me anymore, and I only
saw people who had accounts at
LOTS. I sent them all mail, but no
one ever answered. It was turning
into a weird quarter.
I had escaped real all-nighters up
until then, but that night it was in
evitable. It was the final program,
and it was the night before Big
Game. I thought I'd just wheel on
over to CERAS, fix up the program
and be out by midnight. I was still
naive back then.
The place was busy, considering it
was a Friday night. I logged on — no
queue — and started in on my pro
gram.
I worked steadily for about an
hour. I could hear the hum of com
puters and hackers all around me. I
came to the crucial moment — my
first attempt to execute. With steady
fingers I typed in "exe
PROG4.FOR." Then I sat back and
waited.
The load was only 5.17, but it
wasn't compiling. My hands grew
clammy, I got a sick feeling in my
stomach. Too many Grandma's Big
Chocolate Chip Cookies. Finally,
characters began to appear on my
screen. As I desperately tried to
focus on the wavering green letters,
a cold fear clutched at my middle.
These were errors — massive, un
traceable, insoluble errors. And I
had never learned to use the
FORTRAN debugger.
There it was — the irrefutable
evidence was on my screen for
anyone to see. My program had
crashed; I had failed. One-hundred
seventeen fatal errors and 209 warn
ings. But no one was going to say I
was a quitter. I gritted my teeth,
took another swig of Dr. Pepper and
got to work.

People began to disappear. I saw
them leave, furtively, heads down.
Cowards. They couldn't deal with
LOTS after midnight. Soon there
were only 12 of us left. Twelve of
us — and a dog. It was sleeping un
derneath a table. I kicked it. I hate
sleeping dogs. Besides, nothing
should sleep at LOTS. Computers
aren't for weaklings. If you can't
hack it, drop. And I mean you,
sweetie.

This guy was wandering around,
beer in hand. He leaned over my
shoulder and said, "FORTRAN, eh?"
"What's it to you?" I snarled.
"I used to know FORTRAN.
Maybe I could help you. Let's see."
He started going over my program.
The guy was obviously
drunk — why else would he be at
LOTS at 2 a.m. when he didn't even
have an account? I knew he
didn't — I'd seen him trying to log
on earlier. No dice, but hell, if he
wanted to be a sucker....
We tried it from every angle. We
changed parameters, eliminated
subroutines, and put in extra WRITE
statements. Nothing. Somewhere
between the program and the out
put file '■ was screwing up. The guy

got tired and left. Three of the 12
people left. The dog left. It was 3:30
a.m.
I had one more card to play, and
then I was going to throw in the
towel. I changed the bounds on an
array. Exited — it Cd ne back with
PR0G4.F0R.32. My sk allocation
was filling up faster titan I had ever
seen before. It was expunging every
five minutes. Things were getting in
tense. I typed "exe PROG4.FOR"

and waited.
The bastard ran. It compiled. It ex
ecuted, it sent to an output file. It
ran. I was too tired to celebrate. I
got a printout of the program, a
PHC O of my execution and split. I
left without a backwards glance — I
had no pity for those poor slobs still
hacking away. They deserved it.
Computers aren't for weaklings. If
you can't hack it, drop.
I got on my bicycle and rode
home under a full mor i. It was 4
a.m., but my program was done.
And tomorrow was Big Game. I was
ready. I was free. I was a computer
goddess.
