## Reflections on being gay 
### 
I had an interesting experience at the Big Game
which I thought I d share with you. Bored with the
game, I listened to some friends who had recently
graduated and moved to San Francisco.
"The fags are everywhere — they infest the City like
termites;' "I haven't had a date since I moved up
then - all the eligible bachelors are gay;" "San Fran
i isc o is going downhill and I think it's because of all the
gays moving in — they're totally unproductive!" It
seems as it the only group as "blameworthy" as the
gays is the Stanford Band.
My mouth stayed shut, as it has on many other occa
sions, and I managed a false smile. The questions raced
across my mind. "Why are they so judgmental and
what do they fear?"; "How many of them secretly have
some homosexual tendencies?"; "How would they
react if they knew I was gay?"

/ have inadverdently run into
fraternity brothers and college
football stars in gay bars who would
not only be offended if you called
them effeminate, but would
probably also heat you up.

Let me give a little background on myself. I grew up
with everything a kid could want: a stable family life,
superior grades, numerous athletic honors and lots of
friends. But this outer All-American facade of success
masked an inner sense of anguish which I had been
struggling for as long as I can remember. This emotion
al rollercoaster of adolescence faded as I entered high
school and college and I made a valiant attempt at
dating "girls" (or for those of you who are less tradi
tional - "women"). This worked for awhile and still
allowed me to be "part of the group," but it was never
fully satisfying. So, recently, I decided to test my intui
tive urges and try a homosexual romance.
My initial impression of gay life was not a good one
as i felt totally out of place. Upon entering a couple gay
b.'rs, I was amazed by the uniformity of dress among
the patrons: short hair, mustache, tank top and blue
|ens. My first reaction was that this "cloneliness" was
|U' i a cover-up for loneliness.
Upon reflection, though, I realized that this unifor
mity pervaded most bars, whether it's tweed and top
siders in a preppy bar or belt buckles and boots in a
Western bar. Even so, I decided to pursue my interests
in a different environment and was pleasantly surprised
to find out there was a wide variety of gay establish
ments from which to choose (more than 100 bars and
restaurants in San Francisco with a predominantly gay
clientele, while more than 300 exist in New York City).
As I met more people in the gay community, my
stereotype of gays quickly dissolved:
•(,ays tend to be effeminate. I found this popularized
notion to be tar from the truth. While there are certain
ly gays who lit this stereotype, the majority do not. I
have inadvertently run into fraternity brothers and col
lege football stars in gay bars who would not only be of
fended if vou called them effeminate, but they would
also probably beat you up.
• day.s hrf abnormal and are out of our mainstream of
society. When someone uses this statement, please ask
the poor soul what they mean by "normal." This myth
is being progressively dispelled as each day passes. In
the past, many mainstream members of our society did
not reveal their sexual preferences because of the risks
to their family, career and friendships. Over the last de

cade, these risks have been reduced and many doctors,
lawyers, business executives and other "normal"
people have revealed their homosexuality or
bisexuality. I expect that this trend will continue.
•Gays have no moral scruples and refuse to make long
lasting commitments to another person. Again the vo
cal and media-attractive minority has ruled the silent
majority. Many gays have come to realize not only the
health risks, but also the lack of personal satisfaction
which is associated with sexual promiscuity. The truth
is that most gay men are interested in making a long
term commitment to a partner.
As I came to appreciate my new friends, I felt better
about myself. I no longer felt that I was an oddity and I
no longer was ashamed of my sexual preferences. Now
came the next step — discreetly telling my close
friends. Before embarking on this awkward journey, I
considered how this subject might threaten many of my
male friends. They might think the intimacy of our
friendship stemmed from my desire for a sexual rela
tionship. Nothing could be further from the truth as
there are very few friends to whom I am romantically at
tracted. And, even if there is an attraction to a male
friend, I would never consider imposing any of my
desires upon him.
I have been remarkably surprised at the support I
have received. The sense of exhilaration which occurs
when you are being totally candid with someone you
care about is difficult to describe. While some friends
are confused by my feelings, they are still supportive.

If everyone who ever had a
homosexual thought, fantasy or
actual experience all of a sudden lost
all of his hair, we would put a
majority of barbers out of business.

The intriguing factor is the large number of friends
who admitted to me that had secretly had a gay experi
ence. Hearing these admissions made me believe more
strongly in Freud's theory that nearly everyone has
some tendencies toward homosexuality. If everyone
who had ever had a homosexual thought, fantasy or ac
tual experience all of a sudden lost all his hair, we
would put a majority of the barbers in this country out
of business.
Where do I go from here? I believe this experience
has added to my ability to empathize. Growing up in an
upper-middle class WASP background, I never was
exposed to the inconveniences of being a minority. But
now I understand them frightfully well. As I come to ap
preciate who I am, I am also constantly struggling with
the issues of how my sexual preference will affect my
family, career, friendships and spiritual beliefs.
I chose to write this article in anonymity, not because
I am ashamed, but because I would prefer to per
sonalize my "coming out" to my various friends (many
of whom are reading this now). I feel strongly that as a
society we cannot allow ourselves to narrowly confine
our race which was so broadly conceived.
I would hope that those of you who have never
reflected on this subject would do so as it is a subject
which intimately affects many of your friends (whether
you know it or not). And, to those of you who have
struggled with your sexuality, you are not alone. Re
member, that approximately 10 percent of this country
is gay (a population equal to that of California — some
in the Midwest might argue that these populations are
one and the same) and society is increasingly accepting
and appreciating this lifestyle.
