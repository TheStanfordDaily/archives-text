Comic stereotypes
As a conscientious fraternity
member, I think I understand both
the assets and the shortcomings of
our fraternity system at least as well
as most. I am therefore greatly
disturbed by Mark Wilson's recent
comic strips dealing with this sub
ject (Cradepoint, Dec. 1 and 2), as
they serve only to perpetuate the
myth of fraternity homogeneity.
Unfounded stereotypes of any
group are terribly detrimental to
the understanding of the group's
function and can only cloud the
matter by oversimplification.
I urge all members of the Stan
ford community to increase their
knowledge of the fraternity system,
instead of passing judgment based
on archaic stereotypes. I applaud
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons' newly-formed committee for
its sincere intentions in doing ex
actly this. I am confident that care
ful examination will soundly dispel
the notion of fraternity
homogeneity proposed by Wilson,
by revealing an exciting and diverse
sector of people and ideas.
Perhaps with constructive outside
involvement, we may greatly fur
ther the many positive aspects of
fraternal living and correct the
undesirable elements of which we
are well aware.

Reagan alternative
Throughout the controversy over
who will administer a Ronald
Reagan center for public affairs, a
central issue has been ignored:
What sort of public policy center or
school of government will best
fulfill the University's needs? We
are far more concerned that the
center complement existing pro
grams than compliment Reagan.
Since University President
Donald Kennedy has now made it
clear that the University will
administer any new policy center, it
is time to define the University's
needs and goals for such a center.
Kennedy and the Faculty Senate
should establish a committee to
take a long-run view of the func
tions of such a center. This commit
tee would be able to put the cur
rent offer in perspective: Do we
want to limit ourselves to research
and conference facilities, or do we
want the capability to have a
graduate school of public affairs
(such as the Woodrow Wilson
School at Princeton University)?
The danger now is that construc
tion of a mere research policy cen
ter would limit our options by ef
fectively precluding a more com
prehensive school of government.
At this juncture the question of the

center is so intimately tied with the
Reagan library-museum complex
that careful long-range planning has
been neglected. We therefore urge
thorough consideration of the
many options for an academically
valuable public affairs complex.

Physical therapy
More than 80 persons suffered
simultaneous cardiac and cerebral
insults as they received notification
of termination.
The notice, not a total surprise to
most faculty and staff, stunned
current and prospective students of
the Medical School's Division of
Physical Therapy. The decision
followed an extended bout be
tween proponents of health care
and medical wizardry preoccupied
with technological virtuosity.
What has resulted is the discon
tinuance of one of only two
Master's level programs in physical
therapy in the Western United
States. At a time when medical
advancements improve survival
rates of catastrophic injuries, of
increased life expectancy with
common orthopedic problems, and
while society is incorporating more
people with severe disabilities I
cannot comprehend the reasoning
behind closing a school that pro
vides the community with
therapists who are highly trained to
deal with the complex issues in
volved in physical rehabilitation. It
seems myopic to terminate a pro
gram that is well-established and a
leader in the field. I think Dean
Dominick Purpura's recommenda
tion to discontinue the program is
capricious, selfish and nearsighted
to say the least.

Mind seduction
I was pleased to see Prof. Al
phonse JuiHand's "confessions" in
The Daily (Nov. 28). I was also
surprised that you published it. Out
of curiousity I subscribed to The
Daily this semester to see how our
children are being educated. I have
been disappointed. There has been
little to differentiate from UC-
Herkeley's worst.
The current debate about
STitclrnt-faculty seduction is, I
believe, relevant to Juilland's dis
cussion. If he can rationalize , as
the liberals do, seducing the under
graduate mind, then why not take
their bodies also? What comes
next, "borrowing" their money?

No one expects instructors to be
neuter of gender or apolitical, yet
professional ethit s should restrain
an instructor from proselytizing in
either area, since such proselytizing
is at the expense of development of
the student's critical facilities
The Pavlovian reat tion of The
Daily staff, the faculty
"spokesmen" and most of the
student correspondents to the
"trigger" issues has caused me to
despair. With just a bit of program
ming, any computer could he made
to respond as does the majority of
academia. If liberal arts has become
"liberal" arts, from whence will
come the philosophers?
Who is to de-program these
automatons churned out by liberal
academies? They go into a world,
incapable of (ritical thought, where
the media reinforces their condi
tioning, where the map is more real
than the territory, where you need
not evaluate a James Watt or a
Martin Luther King because you are
told whether they are a sinner or a
saint, and where to defend a
damned sinner or criticize an an
nointed saint is heresy.
The need by the liberals to attack
the total essence of an opponent
rather than just the specific idea
with which they disagree would be
amusing were it not tragic.
Let us hope there is no Gres
ham's Law of Academia, and that
the value of independent thought
and the virtue of philosophical
consistency will come back into
fashion both at Stanford and else
where. Hang in there, Juilland.

Don't pay taxes
This past Friday (Dec. 2) The Daily
correctly reported, in "Students
withhold taxes in protest," that the
government has fined me $500 for
war-tax resistance. What wasn't
mentioned in the story is that I have
no intention of paying the tine. As
I've told the Internal Revenue Ser
vice officials, it wouldn't make
much sense if I denied their author
ity to make me complice to U.S.
state violence through taxation and
then gave them arms-purchasing
power they want from me just
because they've shifted the means
of coercion!
The government counts on each
of us to personally fuel and
legitimize its policies with uur i.>\
dollars, nnci it'<i because there is
that reliance on the individual's
compliance that we, refusing pay
ment together, can affect substan
tial change in those policies.
