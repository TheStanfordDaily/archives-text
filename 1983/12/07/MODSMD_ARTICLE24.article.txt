I bet you've been wonder
ing where we've been the last
two days. Well, we're taking
another break soon — this
time for more than a month.
And you know what? If you
don't turn in that letter or
viewpoint that's been on your
mind, we might not ever
come back. Really.
You see, this is the way it
works: You type your
opinion on a 57-character line
and drop it in the opinions
box. Now if you don't do this,
we might suffer what's com
monly known as a copy
crunch — if we don't have
any copy, the opinions
editors get crunched. And
then there may not be a
paper at all.
Now is an especially good
time to write because we
need letters and viewpoints
for the first few issues after
Christmas break. So here's
wishing you get a typewriter
in your stocking this year.
