# Robert Larkins: Gramps' Gripes
## ERA: unnecessary and dangerous 
### 
Back in November, before pack
ing off on junkets to Inns
bruck, Austria and Mazatlan,
Mexico (to assess relations, of
course), members of the House
tried once again to resurrect the
dying Equal Rights Amendment. It
was a political maneuver by
Democrats in search of a campaign
issue for 1984.
Tip O'Neill's cant was pathetic.
"In your hearts you were never with
us," he scolded the majority voting
in opposition; he should have been
addressing a mirror. Fortunately,
the Speaker's false piety was
blatantly exposed, and it seems that
the ERA is finally dead ... at least
until next term.
The salient feature of the Demo
crat's November ruse is that debate
focused on their motives, not on the
desirability (or lack thereof) of the
amendment According to its sup
porters, the ERA is necessary to
guarantee equality for women, par
ticularly with respect to employ
ment and salaries. We opponents of
the amendment are labelled sexists
who seek to dominate women and
subject them to the slavery of the
bedroom and kitchen. To be anti-
ERA is to be anti-women. Not so!
My opposition to the ERA derives
not from a disdain for women.
Rather, it is a matter of constitution
al principle. Being the brother of a
woman doctor, I know that women
are eminently qualified to perform
most any job as well as, if not better
than, men.(Obviouslycertain physi
cal differences between the sexes
bar women from some careers.)
Quite simply, I oppose the ERA be
cause it is redundant and potentially
dangerous to us all.
Constitutional amendments
should not be passed for sym
bolism. That is what Congressional
resolutions are for. I he purpose of
the amendment process is to extend
rights to those currently denied the
full protection of the Constitution.
Equality in the workplace is already
guaranteed by Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 which proscribes
discrimination in employment on
the basis of "race, color, religion.

sex, or national origin."
The Civil Rights Act was enacted
under the authority of the 14th
Amendment which gives Congress
power to pass whatever legislation it
deems necessary to assure that no
state will "deny to any person within
its jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws." Personhood was
deliberately left undefined since any
attempt to specify who are
"persons" would inevitably have ex
cluded some group or individual.
This is precisely the problem with
the ERA. By specifying that "Equality
of rights under the law shall not be
denied or abridged by the United
States or by any state on account of
sex," the ERA implies a limit on per
sonhood, effectively emasculating
the 14th Amendment
If we adopt the ERA, we face the
impossible task of deciding individ
ually the spec itic characteristics of
the "persons" protected by the 14th
Amendment. Are blacks "persons"?
Catholics? Freshmen?
We should oppose the ( KA be
cause there is now sufficient 'on
stitutional protection of women's
rights. There is nothing preventing
women who feel themselves victims
of sexual discrimination from bring
ing legal action against their
employers. The ERA will not win any
more suits.
The Christine Cratt c ase was over
turned because it was not sexual dis
crimination. In media, ratings are
queen. Craft was fired because of
shifting viewer preference just as
Dan Rather will shed his silly
sweater vests as soon as Nielsen and
Co. determines that the public
prefers hard news over ro/v chats
with Mr. Rogers.
It is a good thing tor us all that the
House Democrats failed in their par
tisan ploy to paint the Republicans
as evil wife-beat t Had they
sueteedeel in their drive to land hit/
Mondale the bac king yet another
special interest group they may
very well have begun the dis
enfranchising of America.
