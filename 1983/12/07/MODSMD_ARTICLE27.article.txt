## Are we ready for the big quake? 
### SUSAN PORTER-SHIRLEY 
It catches vou by surprise, the tirst jolt makes you sit upright
and say, "What was that?" Explanations crowd your mind. "Did
a truck go by?" "Is it a nuclear attack?" Your heart begins to
pound and you instinctively react. Y on scream, shout, run tor
the exit. Atter a tew seconds, the damage begins. Windows
crack and shatter, objects fall from the shelves, bookcases
topple, cracks appear in the floor and ceiling as the incessant vi
bration increases in power. The noise is deafening and very
frightening. And then it will be over . . . you will have survived
an earthquake.
Stanford Civil Engineering Professors Haresh Shah and lames
Cere describe such a scenario in their book, "Terra Non 112 orma:
Understanding and Preparing for Earthquakes to be published
this spring.
The quake could hit at this very moment or it may not strike
for another IQ years. "There is no way to accurately predict
when an earthquake will occur, said Shah, director of the
Blume Earthquake Center on campus.
"There will be an earthquake," said Shah. "It is not a matter
of preventing an earthquake, it is a matter of preparing for
one,' he said. For the past 10 years Stanford University has been
preparing for the expected quake. "Nothing is earthquake
proof, hut Stanford is definitely working towards earthquake
resistance," Shah said.
Whether a building or community will successfully resist an
earthquake depends upon many variables. Among them are the
location ot the epicenter of the quake (the epicenter is the loca
tion on the earth's surface where energy from the quake is
released), the magnitude of the quake on the Richter scale, the
duration of the shaking, the area of the fault and the distance
below the surface tor which the fault extends, (this distance can
range trom a just a few kilometers to several hundred).
The Richter Scale is a logarithmic measurement of an
earthquake's strength. This means that an increase from 5 to 6
on the scale corresponds to a 10-fold increase in earthquake
magnitude, and an increase from 5 to 7 corresponds to a 100-
fold increase.
If a severe earthquake rocked the Bay Area, Stanford would
become the U.S. government's earthquake recovery
headquarters. In response to Stanford's forethought and or
ganization, the less-prepared communities would come to Stan
ford for aid. The Stanford medical facilities would help the
injured, and Stanford property would serve as a temporary
relocation site for the homeless. This procedure has been
studied and accepted by both University and the government
agencies.
In a worst case scenario involving the Bay Area, Shah es
timates 5000 deaths, 50,000 injuries and many more homeless.
"It would be a disaster," said Shah, "manv underpasses, over
passes and bridges would be damaged. Older buildings built
before 1950 would totally collapse, and fires and floods would
be secondary hazards," said Shah.
"Society is not prepared physically or psychologically to deal
with such a disaster. What are we going to do with 5000 dead
bodies and 50,000 injured people? How are the fire engines
going to get to the fires with many bridges damaged or col
lapsed and roads blocked with debris? The population would
have to expect to be on their own for at least 48 hours," said
Shah.

In a worst-case scenario involving the Bay
Area, an earthquake might kill 5000 and
injure another 50,000. Many more would
be left homeless. Many underpasses and
bridges would crumble and older buildings
built before 1950 would collapse entirely.
What are we going to do with 5000 dead
bodies and 50,000 injured people ?

Stanford, in sharp contrast to the general community, is
prepared to deal with this period of isolation. A special task
force, the Earthquake Preparedness Committee, was created to
investigate and prepare the campus for the many earthquake
related risks. The preparation involved researching the physical
effects of an earthquake and ensuring that medical facilities
would be available for the injured.
One of the major hazards Stanford must deal with is the over
flow from Lake Lagunita. "If a severe earthquake struck when
Lake Lagunita was full, some areas of Palo Alto would be in dan
ger of flooding. Stanford has routed the water flow of the lake in
such a way that it would cause minimal damage to the campus,
but the water has to go somewhere," said Shah.
According to Shah, "preparing for an earthquake is the only
preventive measure that can be taken." With respect to the pos
sibility of prediction, he said "People are too hung up on
predictions. Even if I were to predict an earthquake, what are we
going to do about it? The buildings are still going to fall, the
damage is still going to be done."

There are so many anomalies (signs that an earthquake may
occur) that it is impossible to put them all together to get an ac
curate prediction. Changes in the angle of the earth's axis oi
rotation, magnetic field, radon measurements, velocity of waves
through the earth, planet alignment and moon alignment are
just a few of the anomalies that must be taken into consideration
when predicting an earthquake.
"It is ridiculous to look at one anomaly and predict an
earthquake from it. Vet, this happens all the time." For instance
proponents of the "Jupiter Effect" predicted major worldwide
earthquakes as a result of a linear planet alignment, said Shah.
"Although planet alignment is a factor in the earth's movement,
to extrapolate from this one variable to make a prediction is ab
surd," he said.

This type of earthquake sensationalism is quite common. The
prediction that California is going to detach from the North
American landmass and fall into the Pacific Ocean is another
popular myth. The earth is composed of many plates and these
plates are continually moving on a molten lava layer. Continen
tal change is a very slow and gradual process which precludes
the possibility of losing the West Coast in one fell swoop, said
Shah.
Although the movement ot the earth's surface is relatively
slight, the effects of its movement are visible along active fault
lines. For example, these artifacts can be seen just a halt mile
from the Stanford campus along the San Andreas Fault.
The fault can also be seen from FHighway 280 heading towards
San Francisco. Crystal Springs Reservoir marks one portion of
the San Andreas Fault and its basin is a result of the fault's move
ments.
A severe earthquake, 7.5 or greater in magnitude on the Rich
ter Scale, could damage the dam securing the reservoir to such
an extent that it could fail. If this came about, the water would
head towards the San Francisco Bay, submerging all the flood
plain areas.
â€¢ The Bay Area could in principle suffer great damage as a result
of an earthquake. However, when compared to other regions in
the world, the United States is excellently prepared. Although
Shah estimates 5000 deaths in a worst case scenario for the Bay
Area, a comparable quake in other parts of the world such as
China might result in 500,000 deaths.
"On a worldwide basis, over the course of your lifetime, you
have a one in 10,000 chance of being killed in an earthquake and
about a one in 1000 chance of being injured by one," said Shah.
These statistics are misleading, however, because certain
regions have substantially safer buildings and stricter building
codes than others. "For the people living in the United States,
the chances of being hurt in an earthquake are extremely small
because of the better quality of construction as compared to
that in other parts of the world," said Shah.
"The best action an individual can take to resist an earthquake
is to remain calm. If you move to a safe spot, such as under a
table or desk, and do not try to leave the building until after the
earthquake, you will minimize your personal risks," said Shah.

The quake was so detrimental to campus that there was no
commencement ceremony that year; students were shipped
out of the campus in trainloads and graduates were mailed
diplomas.
