## Lan Watt: the scholar behind Stanford's Humanities Center 
### CHARLIE GOFEN 
'It seems to me
important that
students study
something on
literature and
something on
history, that they
know a foreign
language and that
they have something
on art and
music . . . just by
the notion of what
an educated person
is/

When University President
Donald Kennedy earmarked
the humanities as an area for
improvement in 1980, one of
his tirst moves was to appoint
lan Watt, professor of English,
as the founding director of the
Stanford Humanities Center.
Watt has lectured on topics
ranging from"The Early
Eighteenth-Century Novel" to
"The Bridge on the River Kwai
as a Myth," has taught
numerous courses on
literature and literary
criticism, and has published
such renowned works as "The

Rise of the Novel," and
"Conrad in the Nineteenth
Century."
"There is a sense that one
has taught some people some
thing," said the inter
nationally-acclaimed lit
erary critic.
Born in England, Watt atten
ded Cambridge, where he
earned Scholar status and later
taught. He served for seven
years (1939-46) in the British
army, spending half that time
in Japanese prison camps after
being wounded in Singapore.
In 1964, Watt joined the
Stanford faculty. He became

chairman ot the Department
of English in 1968; and in 1971
was named Reynolds Profes
sor of Humanities.
In 1980, when Kennedy
asked Watt to become found
ing director of the Humanities
Center, Watt felt that he could
not accept the offer. "For one
thing, I'm too old," he told
Kennedy. "For another I've
got a sabbatical year coming
on, and for another, I think
that the best work in the
humanities is usually done on
an individual, rather than a
group, basis."
Nevertheless, Watt did ac

cept, aware ot the time com
mitment involved, and the
center was promptly created.
"It's amazing how much
time it takes to move a little
thing forward," said Watt,
whose new position forced
him to halt his research and
writing. Three years later, he
still plans to take his sabbatical
and continue his writing "as
soon as the Center really gets
established and we can find
another person to take over."
Among the 23 fellows
in this year's center are five
visiting professors and some
ot Stanford's tinest humanities
teachers.
Watt feels that one of the
chief benefits of the
Humanities Center is that
Stanford professors may take a
sabbatical year without having
to worry about their "not
relatively high" salaries being
cut in half.
In addition, the fellows have
a chance to share knowledge
"from a fairly professional
point of view" and thus "see
things in a wider perspective
than they did before."
Watt discusses the lack of
eminent faculty people and
funding as two weaknesses.
"We don't have as many
eminent teachers and scholars
in the humanities as there are,
for example, at Yale."
On funding, Watt says,
"We've raised most of what

we need tor the center, but we
certainly need another, say,
half a million before we can
see our way clear for the next
four years."
The regular studies of inter
disciplinary fields that the cen
ter had originally attempted to
conduct have not been partic
ularly successful thus far, ac
cording to Watt. He attributes
the tailure to difficulty in coor
dinating experts in the various
areas.
A major conference on
"Reconstructing Individ
ualism, however, will be
held in February, with scholars
from the top universities
around the world giving
lectures and leading discus
sions on various aspects of the
topic.
Watt's desire to promote
humanistic studies stems from
his firm belief that certain
areas of knowledge are essen
tial.
"It seems to me that you
need to know quite a bit of
history to know how you got
to be the kind of person you
are in this kind of society. And
I do think that knowledge of
language gives you a certain
objectivity because you realize
that other people say things
differently because they have
a different history and think
about things differently."
Watt discusses a method by
which the humanities may
broaden one's perspective on
life. "Everybody knows, I

think, that there are two kinds
of ways in which they operate.
It, for example, I get into my
car and realize I am going to
be a little late, I can figure out
where it's safe to go a little
faster and which stop signs I
can make a rolling stop at.
There are all kinds of mechani
cal, you might say scientific,
ways in which I can cut down
my normal time from 15 to 12
minutes.
"But the other kind of ques
tion is Does it matter a damn
if I am late or not?' Or, if it
does matter a damn. 'Why
does it matter a damn?' I think
you can see that there is no
scientific answer to that
second class of question, but
it is the kind of question that
novels and plays and poems
tend to deal with — the busi
ness of internal value judg
ments. And I think people on
the whole need those things,
and they need to talk about it
so that they don't think that
they're the onlv people in the
world that have these prob
lems."
Watt offers a positive argu
ment against the decrease in
the percentage of students
majoring in the humanities —
from about 40 percent in 1967
to approximately 18 percent in
1982. "I believe enrollment in
humanities courses has not
fallen all that much. It's more
that there are many more
people who want a better job
getting major. There have

been many students I have
seen who weren't English
majors, who were studying an
thiopology or Chinese or
physics, who have an ex
traordinary knowledge of
literature on the side."
Watt is currently engaged
on the second of a two
volume i ritical study of Joseph
Conrad and on a work entitled
"The Myths of Modern In
dividualism." In the latter, he
discusses novel ideas about
Faust, Don Juan, Don Quixote
and Robinson Crusoe.
"Nobody's ever pointed
out, I think, that Faust, Don
luan and Don Quixote all ap
peared at one moment in his
tory, roughly speaking. It was
during one generation — in
the period of the counter-
Reformation.
"All three of them were re
garded as people who were
being punished for being too
individualistic, going against
the norms of society. And yet
we now think of Faust as the
great knower and Don Juan
the great lover and Don
Quixote the great
philanthropist. But that favor
able view of them only arose
in the Romantic period when
we had an individualist ideol
ogy which reinterpreted the
myths."
Students here interested in
the humanities may rest
assured that Watt plans to
remain at Stanford. "I'm too
old to move."
