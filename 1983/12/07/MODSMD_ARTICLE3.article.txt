balance of power in the divided country away from Syria, were agreed
on in the talks here last week between Gemayel and President
Reagan.
The aim is to win over dissident Lebanese religious factions that,
with Syria's backing, have engaged in violent civil war against
Gemayel's Christian-dominated government. If their links with Syria
