# GRADEPOINT
## Raster, Fitzlloyd and cartoonist Wilson say goodbye 
### TIM GRIEVE 
"On paper it looks like an
extended leave of absence.
Nominally, it's stopping out,
but I have a feeling it's drop
ping out."
Stopping out or dropping
out, cartoonist Mark Wilson is
leaving Stanford. And he's
taking Gradepoint with him.
But where will Raster and
Weezie and Fitzlloyd and Pro
fessor Stotwell — and Wilson
— go when they pack their
bags next week?
"That's tough," Wilson said
a few weeks ago. "At various
parts of Gradepoint's exis
tence I've been tempted to
slow down or drop it. I shud
der at the thought. I'd love to
put it into syndication. These
characters are a part of my life.
But it's a tough business to get
into."
But Wilson has a plan.
"My new thought is to really
study the new waves of com
puters and to do a Gradepoint
with a Silicon Valley focus.
What would be best for me,
the healthiest thing to do,
would be to go back to the
hinterlands of America, to the
land of my youth, and work on
a small paper and then come
back in a year or two. I could
use a year to study up on car
tooning and the kind of car
toon I want to produce," Wil
son explains.
"I've completed my 12th
quarter here and I'm satisfied
with the education I've gotten
here. And academically, I've
only got studio classes left, so
it's just as good considering

the financial question, too."
But Wilson's future hasn't
always been in the Sunday
funnies.
Although as a child he drew
murals of dragons in his Wash
ington, D.C., home, Wilson
forsook art for science when
he came to Stanford as an en
gineering major. But after his
freshman year, Wilson
stopped out.
"I was trying to digest 13
vears of school. I guess I prob
ably felt I needed to decide
what I was doing and that a
year off would let me decide.
It didn't happen that way."
He went to Louisiana, where

he worked in the oil fields
near the Gulf of Mexico, dis
covering a "rich, cultural
steampot, quite a change from
the liberal Northeast and the
liberal California scene."
Wilson returned to Stanford
in the fall, still planning to
earn his degree in engineer
ing. But again, "it didn't hap
pen that way."
By the end of next week, he
will be one quarter short of his
B.A. in art.
Although art had always
been one of Wilson's inter
ests, it was not until he began
drawing political cartoons for
The Daily that he knew he had

found his calling.
What Wilson describes as
his "first major coup as a car
toonist" happened two years
ago.
"It was right between the
winter and spring of '81, and
the Medfly was grabbing its in
itial fling. I drew a cartoon
with a skeleton in World War I
fighter pilot clothing sitting
next to a crop duster with
drums of Malathion next to it.
I submitted it to The Daily for
the Dead Week issue, but I
found out the morning the
paper came out that they
didn't run it because Mala
thion was misspelled."

After "throwing a tantrum in
private" and correcting the
spelling mistake, Wilson
rushed the cartoon to the
Peninsula Times Tribune.
"They accepted it and I
thought, 'This is for me.' "
He continued with the edi
torial cartoons until spring
quarter, when he decided he
"wanted some continuity"
and started drawing prototype
cartoons for what would
become Gradepoint.
He winces when he looks
back at his early strips.
"They were terrible, they
were really bad. I hadn't taken
any art classes at Stanford;

they didn't fit into my
schedules. I had the skill to
draw rudimentary shapes that
were discernible. That's
debatable, actually."
When asked about his com
ic strip inspirations, Wilson
has a hard time answering.
"I guess it's easy to say
Doonesbury, for the strip, but
I've always been a big fan of
Peanuts and a lot of other car
toons. I have this big compen
dium from the Smithsonian of
stuff done around the turn of
the century that has been lost:
Little Niva, Krazy Kat.
"The thing I like about the

old ones is that they were
larger in comparison to
today's comic strip pages.
There were a lot more possi
bilities tor what they could
do."
But Wilson isn't sure that
he'd like to try to re-create the
large cartoons.
"I think you'd get a lot more
mileage out of a full-page
photo spread than a Mark Wil
son cartoon."
Although Wilson compares
the time commitment re
quired to produce Cradepoint
everyday to that of a "fairly
difficult" five-unit class, he
says the cartoon is the one
thing that has kept his life in
order.
"I am, by nature, very disor
ganized and I have a terribly
short attention span. I mean,
it's certainly evident from my
transcript. I was the eternal
sophomore until last year and
I've gotten to know a lot of
people in the Academic Study
Office in the past year. I write
them little poems to keep on
their good side. My transcript
is shot full of holes and incom
pletes, but the Daily cartoon
strip is a priority. I think it's
the only thread that keeps me
hanging on to normality."
Normality was not a big part
of Wilson's life this summer,
when he and his brother Allan
worked to put together "The
Farm Report," a compilation
of Wilson's work for The Dai
ly.
