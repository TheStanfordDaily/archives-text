# GRADEPOINT
## Raster, Fitzlloyd and cartoonist Wilson say goodbye 
### TIM GRIEVE 
"On paper it looks like an
extended leave of absence.
Nominally, it's stopping out,
but I have a feeling it's drop
ping out."
Stopping out or dropping
out, cartoonist Mark Wilson is
leaving Stanford. And he's
taking Gradepoint with him.
But where will Raster and
Weezie and Fitzlloyd and Pro
fessor Stotwell — and Wilson
— go when they pack their
bags next week?
"That's tough," Wilson said
a few weeks ago. "At various
parts of Gradepoint's exis
tence I've been tempted to
slow down or drop it. I shud
der at the thought. I'd love to
put it into syndication. These
characters are a part of my life.
But it's a tough business to get
into."
But Wilson has a plan.
"My new thought is to really
study the new waves of com
puters and to do a Gradepoint
with a Silicon Valley focus.
What would be best for me,
the healthiest thing to do,
would be to go back to the
hinterlands of America, to the
land of my youth, and work on
a small paper and then come
back in a year or two. I could
use a year to study up on car
tooning and the kind of car
toon I want to produce," Wil
son explains.
"I've completed my 12th
quarter here and I'm satisfied
with the education I've gotten
here. And academically, I've
only got studio classes left, so
it's just as good considering

the financial question, too."
But Wilson's future hasn't
always been in the Sunday
funnies.
Although as a child he drew
murals of dragons in his Wash
ington, D.C., home, Wilson
forsook art for science when
he came to Stanford as an en
gineering major. But after his
freshman year, Wilson
stopped out.
"I was trying to digest 13
vears of school. I guess I prob
ably felt I needed to decide
what I was doing and that a
year off would let me decide.
It didn't happen that way."
He went to Louisiana, where

he worked in the oil fields
near the Gulf of Mexico, dis
covering a "rich, cultural
steampot, quite a change from
the liberal Northeast and the
liberal California scene."
Wilson returned to Stanford
in the fall, still planning to
earn his degree in engineer
ing. But again, "it didn't hap
pen that way."
By the end of next week, he
will be one quarter short of his
B.A. in art.
Although art had always
been one of Wilson's inter
ests, it was not until he began
drawing political cartoons for
The Daily that he knew he had

found his calling.
What Wilson describes as
his "first major coup as a car
toonist" happened two years
ago.
"It was right between the
winter and spring of '81, and
the Medfly was grabbing its in
itial fling. I drew a cartoon
with a skeleton in World War I
fighter pilot clothing sitting
next to a crop duster with
drums of Malathion next to it.
I submitted it to The Daily for
the Dead Week issue, but I
found out the morning the
paper came out that they
didn't run it because Mala
thion was misspelled."

After "throwing a tantrum in
private" and correcting the
spelling mistake, Wilson
rushed the cartoon to the
Peninsula Times Tribune.
"They accepted it and I
thought, 'This is for me.' "
He continued with the edi
torial cartoons until spring
quarter, when he decided he
"wanted some continuity"
and started drawing prototype
cartoons for what would
become Gradepoint.
He winces when he looks
back at his early strips.
"They were terrible, they
were really bad. I hadn't taken
any art classes at Stanford;

they didn't fit into my
schedules. I had the skill to
draw rudimentary shapes that
were discernible. That's
debatable, actually."
When asked about his com
ic strip inspirations, Wilson
has a hard time answering.
"I guess it's easy to say
Doonesbury, for the strip, but
I've always been a big fan of
Peanuts and a lot of other car
toons. I have this big compen
dium from the Smithsonian of
stuff done around the turn of
the century that has been lost:
Little Niva, Krazy Kat.
"The thing I like about the

old ones is that they were
larger in comparison to
today's comic strip pages.
There were a lot more possi
bilities tor what they could
do."
But Wilson isn't sure that
he'd like to try to re-create the
large cartoons.
"I think you'd get a lot more
mileage out of a full-page
photo spread than a Mark Wil
son cartoon."
Although Wilson compares
the time commitment re
quired to produce Cradepoint
everyday to that of a "fairly
difficult" five-unit class, he
says the cartoon is the one
thing that has kept his life in
order.
"I am, by nature, very disor
ganized and I have a terribly
short attention span. I mean,
it's certainly evident from my
transcript. I was the eternal
sophomore until last year and
I've gotten to know a lot of
people in the Academic Study
Office in the past year. I write
them little poems to keep on
their good side. My transcript
is shot full of holes and incom
pletes, but the Daily cartoon
strip is a priority. I think it's
the only thread that keeps me
hanging on to normality."
Normality was not a big part
of Wilson's life this summer,
when he and his brother Allan
worked to put together "The
Farm Report," a compilation
of Wilson's work for The Dai
ly.

THE LAST TIME: Gradepoint cartoonist Mark Wilson and his three favorite strips
fr'f'The book was, I guess, a
response to people who kept
asking me if I was going to put
out a book. But I was always
holding back. But it was quite
an experience, putting out the
book. I'm glad that I did it,
that we did it, my brother and
I,"
;11 was Wilson's brother who
came up with the idea of call
ing their publishing company
the Quibbling Sibling Press.
t; "We'd been apart for a
couple of years and we have
fundamental differences. But
the name was his conception.
In a rare moment of concord,
it fit. And nothing else did. We
had the Garlic Press, but he
hates garlic and I love garlic."
i, How did Wilson choose the
22tt cartoons he used in the
book?

"Space was one considera
tion, but something being 'too
Stanford' was no considera
tion — I've never had illusions
that this would sell beyond the
Stanford community. Some of
the strips were just so bad it
was painful. That was the
worst part, going over the old
mistakes, the old misspellings.
It was downright embarrass
ing. The editing process was
very easy because some were
so bad."
But if editing the book was
easy for Wilson, marketing is
impossible.
He admits that he tends to
give away too many of his
books, shies away from
publicity and refuses to put on
the hard sell.
"I welcome people to stop
me on the street and ask me to
sign their books. I will tell you
this, I purposely left the title
page blank. I'm really a nice
guy and I'll do all the shading
and the coloring in and sign
'Love and kisses, Mark Wil

son,' as long as they don't ask
me to do an autograph-signing
session, as long as I don't have
to do a mail order ad."
After "The Farm Report"
had been on the shelves for a
few weeks, Wilson had no
idea how it was selling. "I
haven't checked. I'm just kind
of concentrating on getting
back into school. But I have to
get on the stick and think up
some promotional things."
Wilson says he isn't com
petely comfortable with the
idea of having two years of his
life packaged into the 136
pages of "The Farm Report."
"It's one thing to publish
your strip on a daily basis; it's
tossed in a garbage can or a
recycling bin. But when you
have it all lined up in a book,
it's more of a revelation, The
Inner Mark Wilson. And I find
that a little hard to swallow."
The Farm Report is organ
ized chronologically, in a
roughly quarter-by-quarter se
quence. But only roughly.

"The winters were coming
up short. I don't know why
the winters were so bad. The
first year, I took a quarter off
during winter because I
wanted to consolidate any
gains I made in the fall. The
winter had a few marginal suc
cesses, like the creation of
Professor Stotwell."

Many of Wilson's real-life
characters like the cartoons.
University President Donald
Kennedy and Dean of Admis
sions Fred Hargadon both
have originals of some car
toons and former Congress
man Pete McCloskey told a
reporter that the Gradepoint
cartoons on him as a guest
professor here last spring
were "some of the funniest
things" he'd ever seen.
"I think even my harshest
strips just have a very strong
vein of poking fun," Wilson
says."l can't think of any car
toon where the sense of
humor was vicious. And I
haven't gotten a negative let
ter or comment for a year and
a half."
Wilson recalls a "nasty note
from someone in the Athletic
Department" he received
after a series of cartoons on
then-basketball Coach Dick
Dißiaso and his "lousy
season."

But Wilson says he's never
considered doing a strip on
recently-fired football Coach
Paul Wiggin's losing seasons.
"I don't see two lousy foot
ball seasons as that bad. Back
then I was looking for someth
ing that was popular. But I
don't see anything all that bad
about a losing season. I
wouldn't do a nasty one on
Coach Wiggin."
Wilson has been cautious
about bringing any new char
acters into Gradepoint.
"Probably the most recog
nizable character, Raster, was
drawn as a caricature, a bad
caricature, of Allan, my bro
ther. But through a number of
revisions, he took on the look
of a wide-eyed character.
Similarly, the prep school
Fitzlloyd character, the blond
haired one, was a caricature of
my other brother. But I think
all of the characters are a bit of
me. I'm quite sympathetic to

the feelings of all of them. And
every once in a while a charac
ter will represent my point of
view or will say something that
I'm prone to say. At any given
time I'll associate with a differ
ent character."
And two weeks ago, as Wil
son prepared to leave Stan
ford, he identified with Raster.
"I made the decision to
drop out, stop out, whatever,
about a week before Thanks
giving. The series of cartoons
that ran the week afterwards
— cartoons on Raster and his
leaving, him talking to a bunch
of other people who you can't
see, him hanging around but
saying that he's leaving —
that's my alter ego trying to
stay, but being packed off for
cibly. There are all kinds of
emotions about my leaving
here. But it's reason taking the
upper hand over the Raster in
me, whatever the Raster in me
is, the happy-where-l-am part
of me."


. . .and his last.
