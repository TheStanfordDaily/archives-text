# THE 						COMPUTER FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE MONEY
## 
### 
People who love money want to pay tor the brand names that are in their computer. Not lor the name that's on it.
People who love money want quality and lasting value, the best workmanship and the best return on investment for what they buy
If that's you, then this is your computer!

IT'S TIME SOMEBODY FINALLY SAID
ENOUGH TO INFLATED RETAIL PRICES
AND THE ENDLESS HOURS SPENT
SHOPPING FOR A COMPUTER.
Prices are ridiculously high. Confusion
reigns. And you're left with nowhere to turn.
Until now.
Because we're eliminating those price-gouging
middlemen with all their mark-ups and
overhead, so we can sell you a brand-name,
state-of-the-art, completely guaranteed total
computer system for far less. Far less money
and far less hassle.
Our innovative, competition-shattering,
price-war breakthrough will turn the retail
computer industry upside down. And you're
going to profit.
NATIONALLY KNOWN BRAND-NAME
COMPUTER RENAMED TCFPWLM"
(The Computer For People Who Love Money)
We made a deal with the manufacturer. He
sells us thousands of new computers, without
the nationally advertised label. We call them
a much better name, and sell them for a
fraction of the retail price to you.
The "TCFPWLM" computer is guaranteed to
be exactly the same complete computer
system you can buy in any leading retail
store right now for 52195 to 52495. These
aren't seconds, rejects or last year's models.
But they are overpriced because of all those
mark-ups. People Who Love Money can buy
the same computer from us for 5i777. A
savings of S4lB to $718. But that s not the
only reason to buy one.
THE IDEAL COMPUTER FOR THE ONE
MAN BAND. (OR THE CONSULTANT.
THE WRITER. THE SMALL BUSINESS.
AND THE HOME.)
Everything you need is included for $1777: A
Computer, Printer, Display screen. A device
that lets the machine communicate with other
computers by telephone. A complete software
library. Detachable keyboard. Dual floppy
disk drives. All exquisitely built in one
compact transportable unit.
For the first time, one ingenious system lets
you conveniently and effortlessly work
without a desk full of bulky equipment.
Because it weighs only 33 lbs, you can take it
anywhere. It's ideal for the small business.
MADE FOR PEOPLE WHO HATE
COMPUTER STORES
Ever tried shopping for a computer? It's a
colossal waste of time and can take weeks, if
not months to wade through the myriad of
products, ambiguous sales pitches and
unfamiliar jargon. But let's say you shopped
your brains out at a store. Here are the best
prices you could possibly get for the same
equipment that comes standard in
"TCFPWLM":
C orrespondence quality Dot Matrix Printer: S4OO
Accoustical Coupler and Telephone Modem: 300
Two Double Density Disk Drives: 500
Complete 64K CP/M computer: 550
Detachable keyboard: 200
PLUS, a library of top rated business and
home management software programs: 2,800
TOTAL SYSTEMS PRICE S 4,750
And that's if you shopped like a maniac. You
still have to put it all together. And you have
a mess of components instead of a profes
sionally integrated system. And any
professionally integrated system starts at
$3,500 and goes up and up and up. (Don't
you value your time?)
THE BIG NAME BRANDS HAVE BEEN
MAKING A HUGE PROFIT FROM
SELLING EVEN BIGGER NAMES. PEOPLE
WHO LOVE MONEY KNOW WHICH
NAMES TO BUY.
IBM, Apple, Radio Shack, Texas Instruments,
Kaypro, and every microcomputer made
today is a collection of parts made by much
bigger names.
For example: Zilog makes the microprocessor
inside Kaypro, Eagle, Altos and DEC. It's the
same one we use.
The power supply inside the famous Apple
Computer is made by the same manufacturer
that makes ours.
The keyboard is made by Stackpole, the firm
that makes Texas Instruments' and Hewlett-
Packard's. Ditto for ours.
Even many of IBM's electronic components
and integrated circuits are identical to ours

because we both buy from the same big name
manufacturer.
Same with our Display Monitor. It's the same
one used by Compaq and Texas Instruments.
The printer is an Epson. The world leader.
Of course you see the point: Not only will
you be buying a computer at a better price,
you'll be assured that all the quality com
ponents inside "TCFPWLM" come from the
world's leading big-name manufacturers.
(And you thought those other computer com
panies made it all. They're just more
expensive boxes, with far less features).
The Computer For People Who Love Money
is for you.
WHAT GOOD IS A COMPUTER UNLESS
IT WILL DO THINGS FASTER AND
EASIER WITHOUT A LOT OF
TECHNICAL MUMBO JUMBO?
Why have a wonderful computer system like
this, and not be totally enthralled with it?
It would be a waste. And we're not in
business to waste anyone's time . . least of all
ours. So we're including a comprehensive
library of #1 Rated, extremely easy-to-use
software programs— Free! (The same stuff
costs $2,800 if you buy it at a store). Take a
look at what you can do:
IN YOUR OFFICE, IT WILL DO MORE
FOR YOU THAN MUCH LARGER,
COSTLIER COMPUTERS
Now writing, editing, formating and printing
of any document can be simple and quick.
And its "spelling checker' with a dictionary
of more than 50,000 words, conveniently
points out typing errors.
You can draft letters, long documents,
contracts or tables, all for rapid editing.
Organize mass mailings, create invoices,
print labels too.
Build computerized records on clients and
customers for immediate access. Enter data
only once, eliminating file drawers and, once
and for all, the search for missing papers.
When you create invoices, statements, form
letters — whatever — the computer recalls
the information instantly with a press
of a button.
You can have several spreadsheets in memory
at the same time, working together and
sharing data for business projections. Two
spreadsheets can be on the screen at the
same time so you can compare "what is" to
"what if?"
You'll be able to immediately use any of the
16 built-in business and financial programs,
such as: Cashflow Assessment, Accounts
Receivable and Payable; Income Statements;
Net Worth; Stock Portfolio Evaluation and
many more.
VERSATILITY AT HOME.
Take it home, where its ease of use makes it a
wonderful educational tool for the family. An
aid to home budgeting, checkbook balancing,
and record keeping. It's like having a private
secretary handle everything from writing out
checks to answering the phone if you want.
The Computer For People Who Love Money
will do it all!
(We admit this may sound too fantastic to be
true But it really does everything we say,
and much more That's why it makes so
much sense to own one)
THERE'S NO OTHER COMPUTER SO
WELL SUITED FOR THE EXECUTIVE ON
THE MOVE.
You can work more productively wherever
you are, phoning results back to the office
over the built-in telephone modem. Since
the entire system weighs only 33 lbs, its
completely transportable and very durable.
