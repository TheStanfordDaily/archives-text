■ The setting is little more than a ware
house of tables. The amenities are spartan
I" even by Chinatown standards of simplicity
(we didn't even get fortune cookies to end
? ,Our meal). Nonetheless this restaurant pro
des an authentic introduction to the fiery
nd rarely experienced cuisine of Hunan
'hich will be welcomed by those
verdosed on the more common Can
)nese dishes.
The absence of familiar favorites from the
lenu calls for a bit of background. The
rovince of Hunan is nestled between Szec
uen and Canton. Its inland location may
ccount for the near absence of seafood
om the menu. Its people are known for
Itheir fierce warlike snirit. and it is noted for

producing many military leaders including
Mao Tse-tung. They are also known for
using longer chopsticks, and larger plates
and spoons than their neighbors, taken as a
sign of their generosity and hospitality.
However, the trait that will most impress it
self upon diners is, as owner and Hunan
native Henry Chung says: "Hunan people
cannot live without hot pepper."
Spicy Hunan specialties contain varying
amounts of red pepper oil, crushed red
pepper, fermented black beans, minced
garlic and ginger. After I got over the initial
shock of the strong spices, however, I
noticed'a subtlety in their combination
which was very unusual and appealing. As a
bonus, the spiciness results in an absence
of mono-sodium glutamate and sweeteners
and little added salt. The use of smoking,
steaming and stir frying, often in combina
tion, results in a meal that's well worth
trying out.

As a first course, I strongly recommend
one of the Famous Hunan Salads. The
Chicken Salad ($6.50) is a delicious combi
nation of shredded chicken, cucumber
strips, lettuce, shining noodles and hot
and-sour dressing, and can be split into two
large portions or three medium-sized ones.
The spicing is milder than in most dishes,
so it's a good way to ease your way into
fiery main courses.
Not all entrees are hot and spicy. There
are several labeled: "Spicy, But Not Hot,"
and there is even a section of salt-free
dishes. You're really missing out, however,
if you don't try at least one of the hot dishes
Hunan is famous for. Hot & Sour Beef
($5.75) is a sentimental favorite of owner
Henry Chung, since it comes from his
home county of Li-ling. Sliced beef is
sauteed with sliced carrots, onions and hot
and-sour sauce. The hot comes from pep
pers, the sour from vinegar, and together

with a hint of ginger they make for a fiery,
distinctive combination.
Slightly more scorching is Kung Pao
Chicken ($6.25), diced chicken cooked with
whole red peppers, onions, bamboo
shoots, bell peppers, minced garlic and
ginger, peanuts and black bean sauce. One
of the few seafood items was one of my
favorites, Hunan Shrimps ($7.25), with
onions, bell peppers and bamboo shoots in
hot black bean sauce. The absence of red
peppers means this dish is a bit milder than
the other two, allowing the flavor of the
shrimp more presence.
The weak at heart may want to order
some of the milder dishes to dilute the ef
fect of the peppers. Sauteed De Luxe
Vegetables ($4.25) is a stir-fried combina
tion with bamboo shoots, bean curd and
sliced carrots which I found a bit plain, but I
can understand how this might be taken as
an attribute amid the spiciness of the other

dishes.
The best strategy for keeping the flame in
your mouth at a smolder is to eat everything
with lots of streamed rice — after all, that's
how the Chinese eat it. Our waitress was
humane enough to leave a full pitcher of
water at our table, which also helped out.
The complimentary tea was unusually good
and promptly refilled.
Chung explained that all these dishes are
prepared in typical Hunan country style ac
cording to recipes of his grandmother.
If you want to try Hunan cooking at
home, Chung has compiled a cookbook
which may be purchased at the register. It is
full of Hunan recipes mixed with anecdotes
about the dishes and history and folklore of
the province.
If you're willing to put up with the lack of
atmosphere, however, a good introduction
awaits you at the Hunan.
