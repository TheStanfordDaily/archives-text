GAYLORD INDIA RESTAURANT
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco

If you insist on wearing jeans in candlelit rooms over
looking the San Francisco Bay, there is a restaurant for
you. Indeed, Gaylord India Restaurant will serve you an
exotic, stylishly sensuous meal at prices plainly dressed
people can occasionally afford.
Located in San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square (there are
also other Gaylord's, including an uninspiring one at the
Stanford Shopping Center), Gaylord's is not necessarily a
tourist spot. At tables adjacent to ours sat families with
children, several parties of Indian gentlemen and a num
ber of young couples, all evidently at ease with the cush
ions, carpets and rose-colored tableclothes. We our
selves sat resttully in the half-light which sometimes
brightened as a beam from a distant lighthouse on the
water caught on one of the large, polished windows. Un
obtrusively drifting sitar music and figurines poised as
though for dance added the requisite Indian elements to
the decor.
The waiters applied themselves diligently to the matter
of serving us, so much so that I had to ask them to slow
down. They were very accommodating, and I noted that
they were equally eager to oblige a couple that asked for
more private seating. I am never quite happy, however,
when a crew of six busies itself about a single table; I
prefer one waiter to guide me through a culinary ad
venture from beginning to end.
In an effort to cover as much ground as possible, I or
dered a complete Maharaja dinner ($22 ). This dinner in
cludes a choice of soup, a sampling of five meat entrees
and one vegetable course, Indian bread, rice, a choice of
dessert and tea or coffee. A la carte, an entree averages

about $13.
The current trend in West Coast haute cuisine empha
sizes freshness to bring out inherent flavors, but here, I
soon found out, a dish earns distinction by virtue of the
spices and marinades with which plain foods are embel
lished. All of the entrees I tasted were delicious. The two
examples of chicken (Tandoori chicken, half, $7.50; full,
$15 ala carte, and Chicken Tikka, $10 ala carte) as
well as the lamb entrees (Sheekh kabab, $11 and Booti
Kebab, $12) were succulent, spicv meats that had been
steeped in a tangy sauce and barbecued in clay pits.
My dining partner was well satisfied with his Tandoori
Prawns ($l6), but I did not think that the shellfish, with
their own subtle flavor, lent themselves to this method of
preparation. All these dishes were accompanied by two
fragrant chutneys, one prepared with yogurt and hot pep
pers, the other with molasses, raisins and dates.
By far the most intriguing and subtly flavored entree,
however, was the Lamb Pasanda ($l2), where tender
bits of lamb were smothered in a cream sauce delicately
spiced with bits of cashews and cardamon. The peas in the
vegetable dish (Matter Paner, $7) were again disap
pointing, but the chunks of fresh farmer's cheese and the
chopped cilantro reconciled my palate to the second-rate
legumes.
After thanking our hosts, we stopped for a moment to
watch several cooks grilling bread and meat behind a glass
pane. The ovens were deep, smoking pits, on the sides of
which the bread was plastered until it puffed up, to be
then retrieved with large skewers.
A meal with everything, including a bottle of good white
table wine by Foppiano ($7.50) and the tip, had cost about
$60, but two can eat a very satisfying meal with a glass of
house wine each for about half that amount.
If you can afford jeans these days, you might wear them

here on a special occasion.
