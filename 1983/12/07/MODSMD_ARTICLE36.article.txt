If you've finally got that perfect date,
take him or her to a perfect place:
Camarque, a small French restaurant lo
cated in San Francisco.
The charming atmosphere, excellent
food and quality service that Camarque
offers makes it an ideal choice for anyone
looking for a nice, classy place to enjoy
good food and conversation. The
reasonable prices make it unbeatable.
My guest and I were a little ap
prehensive, arriving without reservations
at 30 p.m. on a Friday night (Camarque
onK takes reservations for parties of eight
or more). There was a slight backup, but
we were greeted immediately and cour
teously b\ the manager, |oe! Coutre, and
offered an aperatit while we waited. As it
turned out we were allowed only five
minutes to absorb the atmosphere and
>ip our champagne cocktails before Mon
sieur Coutre led us to our table by the
window.
The decor of the Camarque is tastefully
understated: The tables, woodwork and
latticework on the windows are left
naturally varnished, and the walls and car
peting art 1 done in the earthtones of terra
otta, cream and brown. The restaurant is
licely lit, and dried flowers and a bottle
i wine make charming centerpieces for
hot the tables. As I mentioned, it is
.-.mall, and the rather close placement of
the tables gave me a couple of moments
of worry, but the service was so skillful
that we never felt crowded.
This skillful service was rendered by
our waiter, Jean-Pierre, who arrived soon
after we had had a chance to look over
the menu and began an evening of su
perb service by offering supplemental in
formation regarding our choices, and ex
cellent advice in choosing a wine from
the comprehensive and reasonably
priced wine list.
We elected to begin our meal with a
pot of melted Cantal cheese served with
Black Forest ham and pickles ($3.50).
Sliced French bread is provided on every

table, and as soon as the last slice is taken
the basket is surreptitiously removed and
replenished. It made a delightful ap
petizer, and served as a perfect comple
ment to the rose wine we selected, at
$12 a bottle.
Following the appetizer, my guest
decided to sample the Salade Maison,
made with spinach and butter lettuce and
served with a mustard vinaigrette dress
ing ($2.50). I couldn't pass up an onion
soup whose special recipe is said to date
back to approximately 1650. At $3.50 for a
generous bowl, it was served piping hot,
made with milk and baked with a crouton
and Cruyere cheese. It was very good,
but I found it incredibly rich and a little
heavy for a pre-dinner dish. I would rec
ommend it heartily, but only to those
with very large appetites, since
Camarque's entrees are also served in
generous measure.

If you've finally got that
perfect date > take him or
her to the perfect place:
Camarque.

As a main course I selected the pous
sin, or very young chicken, which was
spit roasted and then baked over onions,
dried apples and honey-cured bacon
($9). It was incredibly succulent, and
the combination of the onions, apples
and bacon give the dish a unique, savory
flavor. It was served with a twice-baked
potato, and strips of zucchini.
My guest chose the veal, pounded and
grilled, which was served with sauteed
spinach, shallot butter, small stewed
tomatoes and a scoop of rice ($10). The
veal was extremely tender and tasty, and
well complemented bv its side dishes, ac
cording to my guest, who pronounced
the spinach "exceptional."
During the meal, Jean-Pierre remained
incredibly attentive, appearing out of
nowhere to refill wine glasses and answer

any queries regarding the food or its
preparation.
Due to the close proximity of the neigh
boring tables, we were able to hear bits
and pieces of various conversation which
proved that our fellow diners were just as
pleased as we were with the food and ser
vice.
Dress at Camarque was varied; we saw
evervthing from jeans to a party sporting
tuxedos. I would recommend a happy
medium; nice slacks, and a casual skirt or
dress would fit the bill nicely.
Despite the fact that the dress which
had tit so well going in was now teeling a
wee bit uncomfortable, when the time to
choose desserts arrived I couldn't resist. I
chose the raspberries with Cassis and
cream, which turned out to be pertect —
light and fluffy without being at all cloying
or overly sweet ($3). My guest chose
the Savoy Truffle: a chocolate ganache
served with English cream. It turned out
to be a scoop of the most creamy,
chocolate-y substance imaginable: No
chocoholic should miss this dessert. At
$3.75, it was worth its weight in gold.
Camarque also offers a prix-tixe dinner,
which allows you to select one of a num
ber of pre-dinner choices, including the
Salade Maison, or more exotic choices,
such as a mousse of veal with woodear
mushrooms, an entree from among four,
including roasted game hen, potted
duck, squid and angel hair pasta
(cappelini), and for dessert either straw
berries with Cassis and cream or three
handmade sorbets (sherbets) all for the
fixed price of $12.
Parking is the worst part of eating at
Camarque; unless you are lucky enough
to get a spot on the street, it is largely
non-existent. We managed to find a lot
small enough to be overlooked by most
on the corner of Polk Street about five
blocks away, where $2 covered the
entire evening.
With that exception, our evening at
Camarque was completely enjoyable,
made so by excellent food and wonderful
service in an elegant atmosphere — three
ingredients guaranteed to make any date,
first or otherwise, a smashing success.

pot of melted Cantal cheese served with
Black Forest ham and pickles ($3.50).
Sliced French bread is provided on every

table, and as soon as the last slice is taken
the basket is surreptitiously removed and
replenished. It made a delightful ap
petizer, and served as a perfect comple
ment to the rose wine we selected, at
$12 a bottle.
Following the appetizer, my guest
decided to sample the Salade Maison,
made with spinach and butter lettuce and
served with a mustard vinaigrette dress
ing ($2.50). I couldn't pass up an onion
soup whose special recipe is said to date
back to approximately 1650. At $3.50 for a
generous bowl, it was served piping hot,
made with milk and baked with a crouton
and Cruyere cheese. It was very good,
but I found it incredibly rich and a little
heavy for a pre-dinner dish. I would rec
ommend it heartily, but only to those
with very large appetites, since
Camarque's entrees are also served in
generous measure.

If you've finally got that
perfect date > take him or
her to the perfect place:
Camarque.

As a main course I selected the pous
sin, or very young chicken, which was
spit roasted and then baked over onions,
dried apples and honey-cured bacon
($9). It was incredibly succulent, and
the combination of the onions, apples
and bacon give the dish a unique, savory
flavor. It was served with a twice-baked
potato, and strips of zucchini.
My guest chose the veal, pounded and
grilled, which was served with sauteed
spinach, shallot butter, small stewed
tomatoes and a scoop of rice ($10). The
veal was extremely tender and tasty, and
well complemented bv its side dishes, ac
cording to my guest, who pronounced
the spinach "exceptional."
During the meal, Jean-Pierre remained
incredibly attentive, appearing out of
nowhere to refill wine glasses and answer

any queries regarding the food or its
preparation.
Due to the close proximity of the neigh
boring tables, we were able to hear bits
and pieces of various conversation which
proved that our fellow diners were just as
pleased as we were with the food and ser
vice.
Dress at Camarque was varied; we saw
evervthing from jeans to a party sporting
tuxedos. I would recommend a happy
medium; nice slacks, and a casual skirt or
dress would fit the bill nicely.
Despite the fact that the dress which
had tit so well going in was now teeling a
wee bit uncomfortable, when the time to
choose desserts arrived I couldn't resist. I
chose the raspberries with Cassis and
cream, which turned out to be pertect —
light and fluffy without being at all cloying
or overly sweet ($3). My guest chose
the Savoy Truffle: a chocolate ganache
served with English cream. It turned out
to be a scoop of the most creamy,
chocolate-y substance imaginable: No
chocoholic should miss this dessert. At
$3.75, it was worth its weight in gold.
Camarque also offers a prix-tixe dinner,
which allows you to select one of a num
ber of pre-dinner choices, including the
Salade Maison, or more exotic choices,
such as a mousse of veal with woodear
mushrooms, an entree from among four,
including roasted game hen, potted
duck, squid and angel hair pasta
(cappelini), and for dessert either straw
berries with Cassis and cream or three
handmade sorbets (sherbets) all for the
fixed price of $12.
Parking is the worst part of eating at
Camarque; unless you are lucky enough
to get a spot on the street, it is largely
non-existent. We managed to find a lot
small enough to be overlooked by most
on the corner of Polk Street about five
blocks away, where $2 covered the
entire evening.
With that exception, our evening at
Camarque was completely enjoyable,
made so by excellent food and wonderful
service in an elegant atmosphere — three
ingredients guaranteed to make any date,
first or otherwise, a smashing success.

If you've finally got that perfect date,
take him or her to a perfect place:
Camarque, a small French restaurant lo
cated in San Francisco.
The charming atmosphere, excellent
food and quality service that Camarque
offers makes it an ideal choice for anyone
looking for a nice, classy place to enjoy
good food and conversation. The
reasonable prices make it unbeatable.
My guest and I were a little ap
prehensive, arriving without reservations
at 30 p.m. on a Friday night (Camarque
onK takes reservations for parties of eight
or more). There was a slight backup, but
we were greeted immediately and cour
teously b\ the manager, |oe! Coutre, and
offered an aperatit while we waited. As it
turned out we were allowed only five
minutes to absorb the atmosphere and
>ip our champagne cocktails before Mon
sieur Coutre led us to our table by the
window.
The decor of the Camarque is tastefully
understated: The tables, woodwork and
latticework on the windows are left
naturally varnished, and the walls and car
peting art 1 done in the earthtones of terra
otta, cream and brown. The restaurant is
licely lit, and dried flowers and a bottle
i wine make charming centerpieces for
hot the tables. As I mentioned, it is
.-.mall, and the rather close placement of
the tables gave me a couple of moments
of worry, but the service was so skillful
that we never felt crowded.
This skillful service was rendered by
our waiter, Jean-Pierre, who arrived soon
after we had had a chance to look over
the menu and began an evening of su
perb service by offering supplemental in
formation regarding our choices, and ex
cellent advice in choosing a wine from
the comprehensive and reasonably
priced wine list.
