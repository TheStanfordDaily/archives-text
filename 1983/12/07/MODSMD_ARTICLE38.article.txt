# Runners raise money for transplant

Robert Fleming is really getting a run tor his money.
Fleming, a 44-year-old San lose resident, was told by
doctors at Kaiser Hospital in Santa Clara that he would
have less than a year to live unless he received a heart
transplant at Stanford's Medical Center. Because heart
transplants, considered experimental surgery, are
funded neither by Medicare nor Fleming's Kaiser
health plan, Fleming needed to raise $75,000 for the op
eration.
Residents at Kaiser proposed a "healthy" way to raise
the money: a run held last Saturday beginning at Santa
Clara park and ending at the Medical Center. A tax
deductible fund for Fleming — or for another heart pa
tient should Fleming not survive long enough for the
operation to be performed — has been established at
the Medical Center's Office of Development.
The run was held amid a downpour that brought
down trees and caused blackouts around campus. It

was a success despite the rain, according to Harold
Sanner, who helped organize the event with other
parishioners of the First Church Of Nazarene. Only
about 40 ot the expected 100 persons showed up, he
said, but several of those have raised up to $1000 apiece
from sponsors. About $15,000 has been collected so
far, he said, with more still coming in.
Even those who did not participate in the run be
cause of the rain have approached Sanner and others
with a desire to contribute further. "Some people plan
to run on their own, and there is interest in organizing
another event," Sanner said.
Susan Warner, one of the residents who proposed
the run, said she found it "incredible" that 40 people
ran in the downpour.
"People came up to me on Monday and asked,
'When are we going to have the run?' assuming it had
been postponed," Warner said. If no other race is held,
she plans to look elsewhere for possible funding.
"Perhaps we'll approach Silicon Valley," she said.
