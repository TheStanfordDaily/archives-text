# SLAC workers protest project

### JEFF BIDDULPH 
Five of eight workers who will have principal
roles in a project at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) that will involve nuclear
weapons research have issued protests to the
project and have asked to be relocated within
SLAC.
The workers, all of whom work at the SPEAR
Storage Ring, wrote letters in November to
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky protesting
the project because some of the research will
have nuclear weapons applications. They asked
to be reassigned to positions within SLAC where
they will be less directly involved with the re
search project.
The project was approved in late September
by Arthur Bienenstock, the director of the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL),
despite intense opposition from SLAC and SSRL
workers. Two-hundred eighty staff and 15 fac
ulty members at SLAC and SSRL signed petitions
last spring protesting the project, which will in
volve the facilities in nuclear weapons research
for the first time.
The project is sponsored by the Lawrence
Livermore, Sandia and Los Alamos National Lab
oratories, the three major weapons laboratories
in the United States, and the University of Cali
fornia. The Department of Energy's Office of

Military Applications and UC will fund the proj
ect.
SPEAR, which stands for Stanford Positron
Electron Asymmetric Ring, connects SLAC to
SSRL, where scientists study the radiation given
by the storage ring. Scientists involved with the
new project would study this radiation "to sup
port the development and application of new
diagnostics in nuclear testing," according to the
description of the plans prepared by the DoE.
Bienenstock said a "very small" portion of the
work under the project will involve weapons re
search. Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and
dean of graduate studies and research, said
when the project was approved that "direct
weapons applications are clearly not now pres
ent in the proposal."
The five workers are john Harris, SPEAR co
ordinator, Robert Stege, head of erator at the
storage ring, and three ring operators: Jim
Turner, Gary Johnston and Roslind Pennacchi.
Another operator, Walter Inman, wrote to
Panofsky protesting the project, but did not ask
to be reassigned.
Stege wrote another letter in June to Panofsky
asking to be relocated if the project were ac
cepted.
"In the 11 years that I have worked at SLAC,"
Stege wrote, "I have taken great pride that I was

working at a place that not only did not conduct
weapons research but was a community of
people actively involved in arms control and the
search for peaceful solutions to the world's
problems.
"It will grieve me deeply if I am forced to
leave SPEAR and SLAC, but I will not and cannot
work on a project which has an instrument of
death as an end product."
Stege said Panofsky and University President
Donald Kennedy promised in June that they
would "to the best of their abilities" try to reas
sign those who object to the proposal.
Panofsky told The Daily on Monday that he
would "exercise the best efforts to see that they
are reassigned."
Stege said the relocation of the workers
would cause problems for SLAC because "a lot
of valuable talent would be leaving SPEAR and
they're going to have a hard time replacing
that."
Harris said it takes at least a year to train new
SPEAR operators.
The workers' requests come at a time when
the project's future is shrouded in uncertainty.
Congress failed to approve funding for the proj
ect in its last session, which ended in late No
vember, and it will not reconvene until late Jan
uary.
