# UNC wins tournament
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Everything went as planned for North
Carolina in Friday and Saturday night's
Hewlett-Packard/Stanford Invitational basket
ball tournament at Maples Pavilion. Well, al
most everything.
The team — North Carolina — got its tourna
ment title, the player — Sam Perkins — got his
MVP award, and the coach — Dean Smith
got his 500 th career victory.
But the Tar Heels got something else Satur
day night, something they didn't bargain for. A
scare.
After North Carolina, 4-0, overcame a severe
case of jet lag Friday night to rout Fordham, 73-
56, Smith and company had to tight for their life
Saturday to record a 88-75 decision over a Stan
ford team that refused to roll over and play
dead.
Stanford, 3-1, held off a determined bunch
from San Jose State, 1-2, Friday night, 58-48, to
set up the tournament final with the Tar Heels,
ranked No. 1 by the Associated Press and
Sports Illustrated.
Stanford Coach Tom Davis agreed with the
national polls. "They (North Carolina) are the
No. 1 team in the country. There's no ques
tion," he said. "They are solid. I think they are
the best team around."
Fordham, meanwhile, improved its record to
3-3 and grabbed third-place honors by defeat
ing San lose State, 89-74, in Saturdays nrst
game behind the career-high 21 points bv
crowd favorite jerrv Hobbie, who was selected
to the All-Tournament team.
Besides MVP Perkins (29 points, 2b
rebounds) and Hobbie (29 points, 8 assists', the
All-Tournament team included Stanford center
lohn Revelli (32 points, 15 rebounds) and guard
Keith Jones (31 points) and North C arolina
guard Buzz Peterson (21 points) and forward
Matt Doherty (18 points, 13 rebounds).
After the game, Smith was awarded the game
ball for coaching his 500 th victory. 1 he humble
Smith, however, said he treated it as just an
other game. "I don't set personal goals in
coaching," he said. "I set team goals. It (the
500 th win) is nice, and that's what it is.
Hut it was the scare Stantord gave North
Carolina that won the admiration of the 8000-
plus fans jammed into the 7457-seat Maples
Pavilion — the largest crowd ever in its 14-year
history. And Smith was no exception.
"We congratulate Stanford for a tremendous
performance," Smith said after the game.
They made us look slow. They were the firsl
team to take us out of our pressure defense
I kind of thought we were prettv good
defensively until tonight," he continued. I
thought they made us look prettv foolish.
When Smith and his Tar Fleels trotted intc
the locker room at halftime, though the\

looked anything hut foolish. They had shaken a
scrappy Stanford squad mid-way though the
period and somewhat quieted a wild, partisan
crowd that included students lining the floor.
There were in command and the numbers told
the same story.
There was the 19-9 rebounding margin and
the 63.2 field goal percentage. There were
Perkins' 10 points and eight rebounds. There
were also the 13 points by sharp-shooting
guard Buzz Peterson, who made 5-of-6 shots
from the field and 3-of-4 from the free throw
line. Most importantly, however, there were
the 55 points on the visitor's side of the
scoreboard and only 39 under "Stanford."
But there was one other thing. There was the
second half.
North Carolina emerged from the locker
room eager to build on its lead. And that's ex
actly what the "Heels," as they are referred to
in the South, did.
A Brad Daugherty three-point play, a Matt
Doherty five-foot jumper and a Peterson 20-
foot bomb made it 62-43 just over two minutes
into the half and Stanford seemed ready to
replace the American flag in the corner of
Maples Pavilion with a white one.
But it was then that the roof which later al
most caved in, began to crack. "I thought that
one of the positives was the way we fought
back," Davis said after the game.
Michael Jordan, North Carolina's other All-
America picked up his third and fourth
personal fouls in the space of six seconds and
was put in intensive care on the bench.
Then, after the teams traded baskets, Stan
tord outscored the Tar Heels 12-2 over the next
1:46, with UNC's only basket coming on a two
handed Perkins dunk. Davis and company,
who had only two turnovers in the entire
second half, cut the lead to single digits three
times before Doherty canned a lay-in and a
eight-foot jumper to make it 70-57 with 12:01 to
go.
Two minutes later, Smith put Jordan back
into the line-up and he immediately hit a 15-
toot baseline jumper, only his fourth points of
the evening. But the 6-6 guard, who is expected
along with Perkins to play on the 1984 U.S.
Olympic team, also wasted no time collecting
his tilth foul and 57 seconds after he came into
the 1 game he was gone again, this time for
good.
In all, lordan played seven and one-half
minutes, scored four points and and did not
make the All-Tournament team. "We would
like to have plaved him (Jordan) more," Smith
said later.
One positive thing, though, he continued,
is that we know when Michael was in foul
trouble Buzz (Peterson) could come in and
