# UNC wins tournament
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Everything went as planned for North
Carolina in Friday and Saturday night's
Hewlett-Packard/Stanford Invitational basket
ball tournament at Maples Pavilion. Well, al
most everything.
The team — North Carolina — got its tourna
ment title, the player — Sam Perkins — got his
MVP award, and the coach — Dean Smith
got his 500 th career victory.
But the Tar Heels got something else Satur
day night, something they didn't bargain for. A
scare.
After North Carolina, 4-0, overcame a severe
case of jet lag Friday night to rout Fordham, 73-
56, Smith and company had to tight for their life
Saturday to record a 88-75 decision over a Stan
ford team that refused to roll over and play
dead.
Stanford, 3-1, held off a determined bunch
from San Jose State, 1-2, Friday night, 58-48, to
set up the tournament final with the Tar Heels,
ranked No. 1 by the Associated Press and
Sports Illustrated.
Stanford Coach Tom Davis agreed with the
national polls. "They (North Carolina) are the
No. 1 team in the country. There's no ques
tion," he said. "They are solid. I think they are
the best team around."
Fordham, meanwhile, improved its record to
3-3 and grabbed third-place honors by defeat
ing San lose State, 89-74, in Saturdays nrst
game behind the career-high 21 points bv
crowd favorite jerrv Hobbie, who was selected
to the All-Tournament team.
Besides MVP Perkins (29 points, 2b
rebounds) and Hobbie (29 points, 8 assists', the
All-Tournament team included Stanford center
lohn Revelli (32 points, 15 rebounds) and guard
Keith Jones (31 points) and North C arolina
guard Buzz Peterson (21 points) and forward
Matt Doherty (18 points, 13 rebounds).
After the game, Smith was awarded the game
ball for coaching his 500 th victory. 1 he humble
Smith, however, said he treated it as just an
other game. "I don't set personal goals in
coaching," he said. "I set team goals. It (the
500 th win) is nice, and that's what it is.
Hut it was the scare Stantord gave North
Carolina that won the admiration of the 8000-
plus fans jammed into the 7457-seat Maples
Pavilion — the largest crowd ever in its 14-year
history. And Smith was no exception.
"We congratulate Stanford for a tremendous
performance," Smith said after the game.
They made us look slow. They were the firsl
team to take us out of our pressure defense
I kind of thought we were prettv good
defensively until tonight," he continued. I
thought they made us look prettv foolish.
When Smith and his Tar Fleels trotted intc
the locker room at halftime, though the\

looked anything hut foolish. They had shaken a
scrappy Stanford squad mid-way though the
period and somewhat quieted a wild, partisan
crowd that included students lining the floor.
There were in command and the numbers told
the same story.
There was the 19-9 rebounding margin and
the 63.2 field goal percentage. There were
Perkins' 10 points and eight rebounds. There
were also the 13 points by sharp-shooting
guard Buzz Peterson, who made 5-of-6 shots
from the field and 3-of-4 from the free throw
line. Most importantly, however, there were
the 55 points on the visitor's side of the
scoreboard and only 39 under "Stanford."
But there was one other thing. There was the
second half.
North Carolina emerged from the locker
room eager to build on its lead. And that's ex
actly what the "Heels," as they are referred to
in the South, did.
A Brad Daugherty three-point play, a Matt
Doherty five-foot jumper and a Peterson 20-
foot bomb made it 62-43 just over two minutes
into the half and Stanford seemed ready to
replace the American flag in the corner of
Maples Pavilion with a white one.
But it was then that the roof which later al
most caved in, began to crack. "I thought that
one of the positives was the way we fought
back," Davis said after the game.
Michael Jordan, North Carolina's other All-
America picked up his third and fourth
personal fouls in the space of six seconds and
was put in intensive care on the bench.
Then, after the teams traded baskets, Stan
tord outscored the Tar Heels 12-2 over the next
1:46, with UNC's only basket coming on a two
handed Perkins dunk. Davis and company,
who had only two turnovers in the entire
second half, cut the lead to single digits three
times before Doherty canned a lay-in and a
eight-foot jumper to make it 70-57 with 12:01 to
go.
Two minutes later, Smith put Jordan back
into the line-up and he immediately hit a 15-
toot baseline jumper, only his fourth points of
the evening. But the 6-6 guard, who is expected
along with Perkins to play on the 1984 U.S.
Olympic team, also wasted no time collecting
his tilth foul and 57 seconds after he came into
the 1 game he was gone again, this time for
good.
In all, lordan played seven and one-half
minutes, scored four points and and did not
make the All-Tournament team. "We would
like to have plaved him (Jordan) more," Smith
said later.
One positive thing, though, he continued,
is that we know when Michael was in foul
trouble Buzz (Peterson) could come in and
gi\e us a lut ottensivekPeterson came oft the
bench to score 15 points and dish off three as
sists in 28 minutes.
Alter Stanford point guard Keith Ramee
misled the front end of the one-and-one he
was awarded atter Jordan's plaser control foul,
guard Keith Jones stole the ball back and
passed to Ramee for an uncontested lav-in to
trim the Tar Heel lead to nine, 72-63, with 9:23
lett.
But Smith really didn t start to worry until the
8:0b mark, when Perkins picked up his fourth
foul and Stanford center John Re\elli hit one of
two free throws to make it 72-b4. The overflow
crowd, sensing an upset, also began to yell as
loudly as it did in the first 10 minutes of the
game.
Smith could afford to lose either Jordan or
Perkins and still win. but to have both of them
next to him on the bench would haye spelled
immediate doom. So Smith did what he knows
how to do best — stall. The Tar Heels went into
their tamed tour-corner offense with 8:03 still
remaining on the clock.
"We went to the four corners earlier than
usual," Smith said. "Perkins was in foul trouble
and that's why we went into it so early."
But Smith did not go into the four corners as
an offensive weapon. He went into it out of
sheer fright. North Carolina, in effect, was
tying itself to the palm tree in the hurricane and
holding on for dear life.
To combat the four corners, Stanford ex
tended its defense and forced freshman point
guard Kenny Smith to travel with 7:21 left.
Davis called time-out, set up a play and 12
seconds and a Revel Ii lay-in later, Stanford had
cut it to 72-66.
Stanford had a chance to make it a five-point
margin two minutes later after Doherty missed
the back end of a one-and-one, but Jones
couldn't connect on a 17-t'ooter from the right
side. Earl Koberlein brought Stanford to within
six again at the 3:39 mark, but that was as close
as it got.
Stanford was now counting on the Tar Heels
to miss free throws. They didn't. In fact, North
Carolina made all 12 of its free throw tries in the
final 2:52. For the game, it shot 80 percent (24-
ot'-30) from the line.
"I thought they shot free throws very well
down the stretch," Davis said. "You'd think
they were getting tired and then they'd go and
stick (make) their free throws."
Davis' admiration of the Tar Heels' free
throw shooting, however, came more out of
jealousy than anything else. Stanford made
only 50 percent of its 12 second-halt free
throws Saturday night. And if missing the front
end of one-and-one tries counts as missing two
free throws, Stanford went a miserable 15-of-29
for the game.
"I think our players put a little pressure on
themselves, so the old free throw percentage
drops a little," Davis said. Revelli had the worst
time of it, making 6-of-16 free throyvs (37.5 per

cent) tor the two games.
The Cardinal's problems trom the charitv
stripe weren't limited to one game either.
Against San Jose State, it took a strong second
halt effort to recover from a horrific first per
iod, one in which Stanford made just 9-ot-22
field goals (40.9 percent) and 6-of-14 free
throws (42.9 percent).
"I think our players tried to go out and do
too much early (in the game)," Davis said.
"We're not going to go out and dominate ear
ly-"
San Jose State took advantage of a long Stan
ford dry spell in the first half, in which the Card
scored only one in nearly 10 minutes, to
turn a 16-8 Stanford lead into a 19-17 Spartan
advantage with 3:25 to go in the period.
After the Spartans climbed back on top 26-24
at the beginning of the second half, Stanford fi
nally began to score off their tough match-up
zone, reeling off 10 unanswered points.
Jones tallied the first six points of the string,
hitting a pair of free throws and then adding a
15-foot jumper and a finger roll lay-in. Brown
hit an outside jumper and a lay-in of his own
and Stanford held a S4-26 lead, one it would


Keith Jones
never relinquish.
San )ose State pulled to
within two twice late in the
game, at 48-46 and 50-48, but
Ramee scored six of the Stan
ford's last eight points to seal
the 58-48 victory.
One person the Spartans
successfully shut down of
fensively was Revelli, who had
only 10 points to go with his 11
rebounds. "They did a good
job on me," he said.
"Between that and getting in
early foul trouble, I was pretty
frustrated out there. But you
have to expect that with
zones, when the other team
collapses on you."
San lose State, however,
was unable to shut off Jones,
who scored 11 of his 17 points
in the second half and went 7-
of-8 from the free throw
stripe. Also for Stanford,
Ramee added nine points,
four assists and five steals.
Both nights of the tourna

ment were officially sold out,
but at least 500 people more
than the 7457 Maples Pavilion
capacity were on hand for Sat
urday night's tournament
final. The vocal crowd sup
