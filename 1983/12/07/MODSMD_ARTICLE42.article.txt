# Perkins wins MVP
## Foul-plagued Jordan on bench 
### ADAM BERNS 
The North Carolina Tar Heels flew in
with two of the best players in college
basketball, both of them Sports Il
lustrated cover boys. But while North
Carolina forward Sam Perkins went on
to win the Most Valuable Player award,
superstar guard Michael Jordan did
not even make All-Tournament.
Jordan's problem was that he spent
more time on the bench than on the
court.
In the Tar Heels' first game against
Fordham, the 6-foot-6 junior guard
wowed the capacity crowd at Maples
with an early game dunk in which he
came out of nowhere to slam down a
tipped ball. He finished the contest
with 11 points and five rebounds in
25.5 minutes of playing time. Not a bad
day out for most players, but not typi
cal Jordan.
His real problems started in the
Stanford game where )ordan had two
fouls in the tirst five minutes. Tar Heels
Coach Dean Smith opted to rest his
guard the rest of the halt to keep him
out of foul trouble in case he needed
him in the second half. He did.

After starting the second half, Jordan
quickly picked up two more fouls in
under 10 seconds with 18:42 and 18:36
left to play. Again Dean benched Jor
dan.
Things started to get a little tighter
and with 10:39 left in the game Jordan
reappeared in the lineup. After hitting
a 15-foot jumper to widen the Carolina
lead to 72-59, Jodan picked up his fifth
foul in under a minute after reappear
ing with 9:42 left.
His final totals were anything but im
pressive.
Jordan was 2-of-6 from the floor for a
total of four points and no rebounds.
In addition, the guard only played 7.5
minutes in the process.
One of the problems facing Jordan
this year according to Smith has been
the pressure he has been under this
year after being billed by Sports Il
lustrated as the"the finest all-around
amateur player in the world," and
making the cover of the magazine in its
Nov. 28 issue.
Last year, Jordan and Virginia's
Ralph Sampson were the only unani

mous first team All-Americas.
Jordan averaged 20 points a game for
Carolina last season shooting 53.3 per
cent from the field and 73.2 percent
from the free throw line. He also
averaged 5.5 rebounds and had a team
high 78 steals for the season.
"I don't try to worry about that,"
Jordan said about the pressure on him.
"I just try to go out and do the best I
can."
On Saturday, because of foul trou
ble, Jordan never even had a chance.
"I reached a lot," Jordan said follow
ing the game. "I presented a lot of sit
uations where it looked like I fouled.
"After that, I was out of the ballgame
which is not a good position for me
to be in."
Jordan's replacement, 6-foot-4
junior Buz/ Peterson, had 15 points in
the contest and although Jordan was
disappointed in his performance he
felt that Peterson's performance has
showed some people that the Tar
Heels really do have depth.
"In a way I'm kind of happy that I
didn't play as much," Jordan said after
the Stanford game. "I showed
what my teammates can do
While jordan was sitting on
the bench, his teammate
Perkins was dominating the
floor in his quiet, less tlashv
way.
In the Stanford game,
Perkins dominated the boards
with 11 rebounds and plaved
38.5 minutes. He also had 17
points and blocked two shots.
Compare that with Stanford's
top two rebounders, center
John Revel Ii and forward Earl
Koberlein, who had onK four
rebounds each.
In the Tar Heels tirst game
against Fordham, Perkins was
just as dominant. The forward
snagged 15 rebounds and
-scored 12 points in the
Carolina victory.
Unlike many college stars,
Perkins not only recognizes
the importance of defense,
but teels that defense comes
first.
"We just wanted to come in
here and play defense,"
Perkins said after the Fordham
game. "I think that that is the
kev, real solid defense. We
learn detense first. Anybody
can go in there and score."
Perkins is a two-time All-
America for the Tar Heels. Last
year he averaged 16.9 points
from the field, shooting 52.7
percent and 81.9 percent from
the foul line.
After the tournament,
Perkins' total career points ad
vanced to 1629 points, which
is the 11th highest total in
Carolina history. He also has
869 career rebounds to rank
fourth on the all-time Tar
Heels list.
Last summer he was the
leading rebounder and the
third leading scorer on the
U.S. Gold Medal-winning
team at the Pan American
games.
After the Stanford game,
Perkins said that he was im
pressed bv Stanford and the
way they hung in the game.
"We had to pull it (the
game) out," Perkins said after
the contest. "It was tough. It
wasn't an easy win."
And it was just a little toug
her with jordan sitting on the
bench.
