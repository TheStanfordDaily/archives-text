# The 						Stanford crowd picks up a new Hobbie
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Fordham junior guard Jerry Hobbie
is the basketball player that isn't, but
is.
For starters, Hobbie doesn't look
like a basketball player. Although he's
6-toot-2 and 170 pounds, his slicked
back hair and black leather jacket are
better suited tor the local motorcycle
gang than a basketball team.
And Hobbie doesn't play like a bas
ketball player, either. His coach, Tom
Penders, is the first to admit it,
too. "He's not the most graceful guy in
the world," Penders says. "Sometimes
I close my eyes when he goes to the
basket. But he gives it everything he's
got."
Regardless of how he looks or plays,
Hobbie does one thing right. He gets
the job done. Just ask the Stanford stu
dent section at Friday and Saturday
night's Hewlett-Packard/Stanford Invi
tational basketball tournament.
The Stanford students, who arrived
early last Saturday night to get seats for
the Stanford-North Carolina title con
test, were forced to watch the consola
tion game between Fordham and San
Jose State. And as soon as they saw
Hobbie piloting the Rams' attack, it
was love at first sight.
Hobbie (pronounced Haw-bee),
who releases his unorthodox left
handed set shot from the the hip,
scored a career-high 21 points in
leading Fordham to a 89-74 victory over
San Jose State and had eight more
Friday night in the Rams' 73-56 loss to
North Carolina, the eventual cham
pions of the four-team tournament.
For his efforts, which included a 13-
tor-13 performance at the free throw
line, Hobbie was selected to the All-

Tournament team. When his name was
announced for the honor at the end of
the evening, the Fordham guard was
referred to as "the people's choice."
The more the Stanford students saw
of Hobbie, the more they liked. They
cheered when he made a good pass,
gave him a standing ovation when he
scored and chanted, "M-V-P, M-V-P,"
and, "Transfer, Transfer," when he
left the game for the final time.
A few students even left sold-out
Maples Pavilion at halftime to paint a
large "HOBBIE" sign on an old sheet,
which they paraded around during the
second half.
But the best was yet to come. At
halftime of the Stanford-North
Carolina game, a freshly showered and
dressed Hobbie happened to walk by
the Stanford student section. Immedi
ately, he was surrounded by autograph
seekers and University President
Donald Kennedy came across the floor
to shake his hand.
Finally, the students coaxed him to
make one more of his unorthodox left
handed set shots on the court vacated
by Stanford and North Carolina, which
were both in the locker room. Hobbie
missed his first attempt, but hit his
second from about 35 feet to the roar
of the overflow Maples crowd and
staccato shouts of "Hob-bie, Hob
bie."
To put a fitting end to the Hobbie
festivities, a few students carried him
from center court on their shoulders
while the Stanford Band played the
school's unofficial fight song, "All
Right Now."
"I thought it was quite humorous,"
said Hobbie, who hails from Elizabeth,

N.J. "I really appreciate it. Your fans
are really good. Maybe I should have
thought about coming to school out
here."
Stanford Coach Tom Davis wishes
he had. "It was super at 7 p.m., that
they (the students) adopted that
Fordham kid," he said. "That is a sign
of knowledgeable basketball fans.
He's a good player."
Although he certainly didn't play
like he was hurt, Hobbie almost
missed Saturday's game with a bruised
arch."(North Carolina's Michael) Jor
dan kicked me last night in the foot,"
he said. "Bv noontime I didn't think I
could even play. But I put ice on it for
three hours."
Injuries, however, aren't something
new to Hobbie. The scrappy guard
who is fearless on the court missed
five of Fordham's first seven games last
season when he had a scratched cor
nea in his right eye and four teeth ex
tracted.
The best part of the junior guard's
game, as evidenced by his 13-for-13
show Saturday night, is his free throw
shooting. As a freshman, Hobbie led
the nation in free throw percentage at
one point, hitting 95.1 percent of his
attempts from the charity stripe (39-of
-41). He finished the season shooting
free throws at a 87.7 percent clip, a
Fordham single-season record.
Despite his performance against San
Jose State, Hobbie was surprised by
his overwhelming crowd support.
"You might expect it a little bit at
home," he said. "But I would never
expect it on the road. I wish we had
some more fans like that at home."
And Stanford fans wish they had
some Jerry Hobbies at Stanford.

some more fans like that at home."
And Stanford fans wish they had
some Jerry Hobbies at Stanford.

Fordham point guard Jerry Hobbie became the crowd's favorite player during the two-day
tournament. Hobbie scored 21 points in Fordham's consolation match with San Jose State
and drew cheers from the crowd every time he touched the ball.
Fordham junior guard Jerry Hobbie
is the basketball player that isn't, but
is.
For starters, Hobbie doesn't look
like a basketball player. Although he's
6-toot-2 and 170 pounds, his slicked
back hair and black leather jacket are
better suited tor the local motorcycle
gang than a basketball team.
And Hobbie doesn't play like a bas
ketball player, either. His coach, Tom
Penders, is the first to admit it,
too. "He's not the most graceful guy in
the world," Penders says. "Sometimes
I close my eyes when he goes to the
basket. But he gives it everything he's
got."
Regardless of how he looks or plays,
Hobbie does one thing right. He gets
the job done. Just ask the Stanford stu
dent section at Friday and Saturday
night's Hewlett-Packard/Stanford Invi
tational basketball tournament.
The Stanford students, who arrived
early last Saturday night to get seats for
the Stanford-North Carolina title con
test, were forced to watch the consola
tion game between Fordham and San
Jose State. And as soon as they saw
Hobbie piloting the Rams' attack, it
was love at first sight.
Hobbie (pronounced Haw-bee),
who releases his unorthodox left
handed set shot from the the hip,
scored a career-high 21 points in
leading Fordham to a 89-74 victory over
San Jose State and had eight more
Friday night in the Rams' 73-56 loss to
North Carolina, the eventual cham
pions of the four-team tournament.
For his efforts, which included a 13-
tor-13 performance at the free throw
line, Hobbie was selected to the All-

Tournament team. When his name was
announced for the honor at the end of
the evening, the Fordham guard was
referred to as "the people's choice."
The more the Stanford students saw
of Hobbie, the more they liked. They
cheered when he made a good pass,
gave him a standing ovation when he
scored and chanted, "M-V-P, M-V-P,"
and, "Transfer, Transfer," when he
left the game for the final time.
A few students even left sold-out
Maples Pavilion at halftime to paint a
large "HOBBIE" sign on an old sheet,
which they paraded around during the
second half.
But the best was yet to come. At
halftime of the Stanford-North
Carolina game, a freshly showered and
dressed Hobbie happened to walk by
the Stanford student section. Immedi
ately, he was surrounded by autograph
seekers and University President
Donald Kennedy came across the floor
to shake his hand.
Finally, the students coaxed him to
make one more of his unorthodox left
handed set shots on the court vacated
by Stanford and North Carolina, which
were both in the locker room. Hobbie
missed his first attempt, but hit his
second from about 35 feet to the roar
of the overflow Maples crowd and
staccato shouts of "Hob-bie, Hob
bie."
To put a fitting end to the Hobbie
festivities, a few students carried him
from center court on their shoulders
while the Stanford Band played the
school's unofficial fight song, "All
Right Now."
"I thought it was quite humorous,"
said Hobbie, who hails from Elizabeth,

N.J. "I really appreciate it. Your fans
are really good. Maybe I should have
thought about coming to school out
here."
Stanford Coach Tom Davis wishes
he had. "It was super at 7 p.m., that
they (the students) adopted that
Fordham kid," he said. "That is a sign
of knowledgeable basketball fans.
He's a good player."
Although he certainly didn't play
like he was hurt, Hobbie almost
missed Saturday's game with a bruised
arch."(North Carolina's Michael) Jor
dan kicked me last night in the foot,"
he said. "Bv noontime I didn't think I
could even play. But I put ice on it for
three hours."
Injuries, however, aren't something
new to Hobbie. The scrappy guard
who is fearless on the court missed
five of Fordham's first seven games last
season when he had a scratched cor
nea in his right eye and four teeth ex
tracted.
The best part of the junior guard's
game, as evidenced by his 13-for-13
show Saturday night, is his free throw
shooting. As a freshman, Hobbie led
the nation in free throw percentage at
one point, hitting 95.1 percent of his
attempts from the charity stripe (39-of
-41). He finished the season shooting
free throws at a 87.7 percent clip, a
Fordham single-season record.
Despite his performance against San
Jose State, Hobbie was surprised by
his overwhelming crowd support.
"You might expect it a little bit at
home," he said. "But I would never
expect it on the road. I wish we had
some more fans like that at home."
And Stanford fans wish they had
some Jerry Hobbies at Stanford.
