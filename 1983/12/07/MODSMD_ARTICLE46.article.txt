# Women's basketball team loses 2 games in Vegas
## 
### JOHN LIS 
A weekend trip to Las Vegas
saw the Stanford women's
basketball team come up
empty in a pair of contests.
The Cardinal was edged 6.3-59
by Baylor Friday and lost to
Nevada-Las Vegas 80-55 Sun
day.
In Friday's game, Baylor
opened up a 15-point lead in
the first half, but Stanford
came back to cut it to 34-26 at
halftime and tied the contest
with 15 minutes remaining.
The Bears again opened up an
8-point margin, but the Car
dinal came back again and got
within two with only 1:44
remaining, but could not pull
it out.
Sophomore guard Virginia
Sourlis paced Stanford with 14
points. Freshman guard Sue
Sebolt came off the bench to
hit six of eight from the field
for 12 points, and sophomore
center Sarah Evans added 11
points and seven rebounds.
Baylor out-rebounded Stan
ford 36-27 in the game. The
Cardinal hit 51 percent from
the field while holding Baylor
to a 44 percent performance,
but the Card turned the ball
over 25 times.
Stanford Head Coach Dotty
McCrea compared the defeat
to the Cardinal's 84-75 loss to
Pacific last Tuesday. "Again,
we came out slowly for the
first 10 minutes, and we just
couldn't come back," she
said.

Against Nevada-Las Vegas
the Cardinal only trailed by
nine at halftime, 35-26, but the
Rebels opened up their run
ning game in the second half
to coast to victory, junior for
ward Mary Bradach led the
Cardinal with 16 points and
nine rebounds, and Evans
added another 14 points.
UNLV controlled the
boards, 39-26. Stanford shot
only 44 percent from the floor,
while the Rebels connected
on 55 percent of their field
goal attempts and shot 89 per
cent from the line.
McCrea realized that much
of the weekend's perfor
mance is attributable to the
team's youth. She said, "A lot
of it is just mental and learning
to play together." She
compared the experience to
an investment, saying, "Right
now we're establishing a
savings account. The interest
will pay off down the road."
Stanford has two games this
weekend, traveling to the Uni
versity of San Francisco Friday
and returning home to face
arch-rival UC-Berkeley Satur
day night. These are the
cagers' last games before win
ter break.
USF opened up with three
victories in the Cal State-
Hayward tournament, but
then lost two games this
weekend to Long Beach State
and Cal Poly-Pomona to fall to
3-2.
The Dons are led bv return

ing guards Sue Corder, a 5-
foot-9 junior, and Lisa
Stevens, a 5-7 sophomore.
USF also features the sister
tandem of 6-4 senior center
Linda Walsh and 5-11 fresh
man forward Margaret Walsh.
The Dons also have a Stan
ford connection. USF Head
Coach Sue Rojcewicz was an
assistant on the Farm before
joining the Dons last year.
Cal is 3-1 this season. The
Bears won their own Golden
Bear Classic, defeating Hous
ton, Oral Roberts and
Colorado State. Their lone
defeat came at the hands of
UNLV. The Bears faced San
Francisco State last night.
Cal is led by a pair of for
wards — 5-10 junior Cynthia
Cooke, who is averaging 15.8
points per game, including a
32-point effort against UNLV,
and 6-4 sophomore Heli Toik
ka (14.5 points per game), an
import from Finland.
McCrea and her staff are
getting the squad primed for
this weekend. "We're going
back to work and to find a way
to win. They're two tough
games. USF is always tough at
home, and Cal is the best team
is the NorCal Conference."
After finals, the cagers will
host Cal Poly-Pomona a week
from Friday, and will travel to
the Miami Dial Classic after
the new year for contests
against Missouri |an. 2, Penn
State )an. 3, and Florida State
jan. 5.

A weekend trip to Las Vegas
saw the Stanford women's
basketball team come up
empty in a pair of contests.
The Cardinal was edged 6.3-59
by Baylor Friday and lost to
Nevada-Las Vegas 80-55 Sun
day.
In Friday's game, Baylor
opened up a 15-point lead in
the first half, but Stanford
came back to cut it to 34-26 at
halftime and tied the contest
with 15 minutes remaining.
The Bears again opened up an
8-point margin, but the Car
dinal came back again and got
within two with only 1:44
remaining, but could not pull
it out.
Sophomore guard Virginia
Sourlis paced Stanford with 14
points. Freshman guard Sue
Sebolt came off the bench to
hit six of eight from the field
for 12 points, and sophomore
center Sarah Evans added 11
points and seven rebounds.
Baylor out-rebounded Stan
ford 36-27 in the game. The
Cardinal hit 51 percent from
the field while holding Baylor
to a 44 percent performance,
but the Card turned the ball
over 25 times.
Stanford Head Coach Dotty
McCrea compared the defeat
to the Cardinal's 84-75 loss to
Pacific last Tuesday. "Again,
we came out slowly for the
first 10 minutes, and we just
couldn't come back," she
said.

Against Nevada-Las Vegas
the Cardinal only trailed by
nine at halftime, 35-26, but the
Rebels opened up their run
ning game in the second half
to coast to victory, junior for
ward Mary Bradach led the
Cardinal with 16 points and
nine rebounds, and Evans
added another 14 points.
UNLV controlled the
boards, 39-26. Stanford shot
only 44 percent from the floor,
while the Rebels connected
on 55 percent of their field
goal attempts and shot 89 per
cent from the line.
McCrea realized that much
of the weekend's perfor
mance is attributable to the
team's youth. She said, "A lot
of it is just mental and learning
to play together." She
compared the experience to
an investment, saying, "Right
now we're establishing a
savings account. The interest
will pay off down the road."
Stanford has two games this
weekend, traveling to the Uni
versity of San Francisco Friday
and returning home to face
arch-rival UC-Berkeley Satur
day night. These are the
cagers' last games before win
ter break.
USF opened up with three
victories in the Cal State-
Hayward tournament, but
then lost two games this
weekend to Long Beach State
and Cal Poly-Pomona to fall to
3-2.
The Dons are led bv return

ing guards Sue Corder, a 5-
foot-9 junior, and Lisa
Stevens, a 5-7 sophomore.
USF also features the sister
tandem of 6-4 senior center
Linda Walsh and 5-11 fresh
man forward Margaret Walsh.
The Dons also have a Stan
ford connection. USF Head
Coach Sue Rojcewicz was an
assistant on the Farm before
joining the Dons last year.
Cal is 3-1 this season. The
Bears won their own Golden
Bear Classic, defeating Hous
ton, Oral Roberts and
Colorado State. Their lone
defeat came at the hands of
UNLV. The Bears faced San
Francisco State last night.
Cal is led by a pair of for
wards — 5-10 junior Cynthia
Cooke, who is averaging 15.8
points per game, including a
32-point effort against UNLV,
and 6-4 sophomore Heli Toik
ka (14.5 points per game), an
import from Finland.
McCrea and her staff are
getting the squad primed for
this weekend. "We're going
back to work and to find a way
to win. They're two tough
games. USF is always tough at
home, and Cal is the best team
is the NorCal Conference."
After finals, the cagers will
host Cal Poly-Pomona a week
from Friday, and will travel to
the Miami Dial Classic after
the new year for contests
against Missouri |an. 2, Penn
State )an. 3, and Florida State
jan. 5.
