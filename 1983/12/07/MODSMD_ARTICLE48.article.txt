# Volleyball team prepares for Regionals
## 
### TOM MOORE 
Taking advantage of a first
round bye, the Stanford wo
men's volleyball team begins
its drive toward the NCAA
championship Friday in San
Diego. The fourth-seeded Car
dinal will face No. 9-ranked
Brigham Young University at
5:30 pm in the opening match
of the West Regional.
The BYU Cougars, 26-8 over
all, beat Arizona State 3-0 in a
preliminary round to advance
to the West Regionals, but
Stanford Head Coach Fred
Sturm feels that the extra
match does not give BYU any
added momentum.
Rather, Sturm said the 10-
day break has been good for
his squad. "We've had some
excellent practices during this
past week," he explained.
"We're really playing well
right now."
The Card plans to stick to
the same type of game plan
that has had so much success
throughout the year, relying
on a quick, aggressive defen
sive scheme and executing a
patented ball control offense.
Playoff experience should also
prove valuable to the Cardinal
as they attempt to make it to
the Final Four for the second
consecutive year.
"Playoff experience will
help," admitted Cardinal as
sistant coach Don Shaw, "but
we still plan to take just one
game at a time."
The Cougars depend upon
senior outside hitters Madge
Ferreira and Karin Knudsen to

supply most of their offensive
firepower. Senior Raelyn
Hoglun anchors a strong
blocking front line.
"Thev rely on a power-type
game/' explained Shaw, "but
they're not real quick out
there." Stanford hopes to ex
ploit the Cougars by control
ling the ball on its own side of
the net long enough to
confuse the taller BYU squad.
"We'll try to really control the
ball better," said Shaw, "and
we'll see how the court opens
up."
Seniors Julie Baker and kari
Rush along with sophomore
Kim Oden will lead the Stan
ford offensive attack against
the Cougars, juniors Deidra
Dvorak and Lisa Murphy with
freshman Barbara Fontana also
figure to play a prominent role
in Stanford's balanced attack.
"Our strength is team
work," Sturm said. "We're
more concerned with our own
execution rather than shifting
a strategy to fit an opponent."
The 19-8 Card, which has
proven this approach success
ful all season, hopes to put it
to use for four more matches.
Should Stanford defeat
BYU, f he team will face the
Arizona-San Diego winner Sat
urday night with the winner
advancing to Lexington, Ky.,
for the Final Four Dec. 17-20.
If none of the four seeded
teams are upset, Stanford will
face No. 1 ranked Hawaii in
one semifinal match while No.
2 UOP and No. 3 ranked UCLA
will battle it out in the other.
