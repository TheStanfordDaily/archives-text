At this weekend's Caesar's Palace Invita
tional, the Cardinal wrestlers placed 20th
out of 43 teams in the biggest collegiate
meet of the year.
Oklahoma State captured first place with
Oklahoma second and San Jose State a
surprising third.
"I was very pleased with the team's per
formance for we won more rounds than last
year even with the many injuries we have,"
commented Coach Chris Horpel. "The
younger wrestlers got a lot out of the meet,
but were not ready to compete at this high
level.

"Unfortunately some of the starters
could not compete to see how well they
might do in the future."
The highest Stanford placer was Jeff Wil
son at 177 pounds who took sixth. Wilson
got to the semifinals, but due to an injury
was not able to compete in his last two
matches.
Jeff Hazard at 142 pounds went five
rounds, heavyweight Ed Katz went four
rounds and at 190 pounds Kurt Kussulke up
set an lowa State wrestler in his three
rounds.
During the Christmas break Stanford will

day will face Southern Oregon. On Jan. 5
comes an important match with Oregon
State and closing out this hectic schedule is
a meet in Seattle with Washington State,
Central Washington, Eastern Washington,
Oregon and Simon Frazier.
"These four meets will be a make or
break or situation for the team," said Hor
pel. "If we are healthy we shall do well.
Arizona State is the only league power we
do not face so this trip will be valuable for
judging the team."
