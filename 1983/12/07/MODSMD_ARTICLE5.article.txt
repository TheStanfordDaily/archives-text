## 
### ADAM BERNS 
Athletic Director Andy Geiger will
probably pick a new football coach
within the next seven to 10 days, ac
cording to Sports Information Co-
Director Steve Raczynski.
Among the names considered
most likely to replace former Coach
Paul Wiggin, who was recently
forced to resign, are UC-Davis Head
Coach Jim Sochor, San Jose State
Head Coach Jack Elway, UCLA of
fensive coordinator Homer Smith
and Green Bay Packers offensive
line coach Bill Meyers.
Geiger interviewed Elway Mon
day, and Green Bay's Meyer flew in
to be interviewed yesterday. While
there was no official word on Smith,
Sochor will probably visit Stanford
this week.
Sochor, whose Davis team lost in
the Division II semifinals this year, is
considered by many to be the front
runner for the job, and he is now
free to interviewed for the job be
cause his football season is over.
"I will be probably be down this
week," Sochor told The Daily by
phone Monday. Athletic Depart
ment sources would not confirm
what day the Davis coach is ex
pected to visit.
Elway is also thought to be among
the top candidates on Geiger's list.
"I talked with Andy (Geiger) on
Monday," Elway told the Daily yes
terday afternoon. "I met the dean of
admissions, the faculty adviser (for
the football team), and the Dresi-
dent. We talked about the job.
The people involved wanted
to get acquainted with me. I'm
obviously impressed with
Stanford."
Both Sochor and Elway are
thought to be actively seeking
the job, although Sochor said
that he is happy at Davis.
"I have a great place at
Davis," Sochor said this week.
"I think what Stanford should
do is hire the best football

coach they can possibly hire. I
wouldn't go there if there
were any reservations."
Sochor is convinced,
however, that Stanford is ca
pable of huilding a winning
program.
"A lot of the focus is on the
negative aspects of the pro
gram," Sochor said. "There
are a lot of positive aspects
about the program. They have
shown in past years that they
are capable of competing."
One of the criticisms about
Sochor is that as a Division II
coach he has not had to
recruit major high school ath

letes. But Sochor said he does
not feel that recruiting would
be a big problem.
"I don't see it (recruiting) as
a problem," Sochor said.
"We've recruited vigorously
(at Davis). It's only in degree."
like Sochor, tlway also feeh
that rebuilding the Stanford
program is possible.
I got the feeling that in
anything that Stanford
embraces they want excel
lence," Elway said yesterday.
"I think that a great academic
school and a top football pro
gram are compatible."
