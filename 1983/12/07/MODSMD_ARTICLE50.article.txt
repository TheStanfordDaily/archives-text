Racquetball
The Stanford racquetball club
kicks off the winter quarter with the
Stanford Racquetball Tournament to
be held the first weekend after the
winter break. The club begins its
season in the intercollegiate NCIRA
League in the following week.
The tournament will be held on
Jan. 13, 14 and 15 at DeCuerre
Courts. It is sponsored by the club,
Penn, and Ultrasport Magazine and
is open to players of all abilities who
are either students or faculty of
Stanford. Information and entry
forms are available at DeGuerre
Courts.
While the tournament is for
players of all abilities, the advanced
player competes in the NCIRA with
the club team. Jeff Shapiro, who is
returning with an incredible 6-0
record as the first-ranked men's
player last year, will head the power
ful men's team as the team captain.
The women's team will be led by
Nancy Shayer who was the second
ranked player last year on the team
with a 4-2 record.
The teams had a combined 3-3
record last season, and will begin
this season with a host of new tal
ent. The team will play schools from
all over Northern California.
The club also appeals to the
recreational player. It meets every
Monday and Thursday between 6:30
and 8:30 p.m. for challenge play and
instruction offered by Shapiro, who

is also the coach for the club. The
ladder system establishes the roster
for the team (the best six and four
on the ladder) while also offering
the recreational player the opportu
nity to play and compete regularly.
Lacrosse
Playing "the fastest game on two
feet," the men's lacrosse team here
will vie for the California Collegiate
Title this winter and spring. With a
season that extends from mid-
Januarv to the end of April, Cardinal
lacrosse will attempt to regain the
form that led it to the championship
in 1982. Coming off a rather dismal
season last year, the team hopes to
benefit from new talent.
Freshman Greg Simon will figure
heavily in the Card's new lineup.
Simon is an aggressive scoring
midfielder. The attack will feature
captain Tim Romer, along with John
Cox. Tony Kieffer on defense, will
play alongside veteran Brian Arthur.
Goalkeeping chores lie with )im
Mulvihill and Tim Barry.
Chief league competition comes
from perennial power UC-Santa Bar
bara, as well as from rival UC-
Berkeley. The team opens its season
Saturday, Jan. 21, with an all-day
tournament featuring Bay Area club
and college teams. League play
begins Feb. 4 against UC-Davis. In
April, Stanford hosts the Western
States Tournament, which features
the best teams on the West Coast

and this year will include Mid
dlebury College.
No prior lacrosse experience is re
quired for membership in the club,
and the team offers instruction for
novices.
Tai Chi Chuan
Tai Chi Chuan will return to Stan
ford as a newly established club
sport this winter quarter.
While Tai Chi was originally
practiced quickly and used as sell
detense, the exercise today has
evolved into a slow exercise found
very useful for health practices and
exercise. The slow Tai Chi exercise
trains one in mental tranquility and
physical relaxation, as well as im
proving strength, concentration,
body awareness and unification ot
action between mind and body. It is
to be regarded as an art as well as
sport and exercise.
The style of Tai Chi taught will be
the long yang form of 81 postures. It
is the most popular style practiced
today in China. The class will also ot
ter an opportunity to learn other
classical Tai Chi forms, such as Tai
Chi sword, and Tai Chi stick, fast Tai
Chi and basic Shaolin training.
Different forms of practice art
taught to furnish a greater variety oi
movements to train agility and alert
ness and to provide an even more
balanced health benefit than the
slow movements alone.
