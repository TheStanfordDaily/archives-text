## Adios, Stanford-Buenos Dias, S.S. Azure Seas 
### BRENDA PASCOE JOHN SAGE 
•. Ready and waiting for your
own trip aboard the Love Boat
amid confetti, champagne,
and romantic adventure?
Well, the S.S. Azure Seas may
not be exactly Captain Stub
bing's infamous vessel;
however, Western Cruise
Lines offers a fabulous, affor
dable opportunity to travel
aboard a luxury, 750-person
capacity "party ship" from Los
Angeles to Ensenada, Mexico
for either a three or four night
cruise year-round.
The S.S. Azure Seas is a daz
zling floating resort on the
Pacific. Passengers are treated
to a variety of entertainment,
dining and sightseeing experi
ences. This cruise offers
something for every age
group. There are attractions
and activities on board to
satisfy every different appe
tite; no passenger has the
chance to become impatient
or restless.
Most importantly, Western
Cruise Lines offers reasonably
priced fares, well below those
of their better-known compet
itors. There are 320 cabins
spread over nine passenger
decks. Prices of the ac
comodations (based on rate
per person, double oc
cupancy) range from $375 to
$650 for the three night cruise,
and from $430 to $695 for the
four night cruise (includes a
stop in San Diego). Special
rates are available for those
booking four people per
cabin. A three day cruise can
cost as little as $117 a day per
person. Reservations and in
formation are available

through any travel agent. Hap
pily, we found the cabin quite
spacious and clean, thanks to
the meticulous and conscien
tious room stewards.
The ship itself provides the
playground for all ages, espe
cially in warm, sunny weather.
We enjoyed the pool and
jacuzzi as well as the casino,
cinema, disco and especially
the five bars. One must expect
the fairly "hokey" standard
piano bar entertainers and
dancers in all of the three
night clubs. The disco was
much more popular for the
younger, "hip" crowd and
provided surprisingly good
dancing music and a fun atmo
sphere. And of course, you'll
find the mandatory duty-free
shop aboard, complete with
all the alcohol, T-shirts and
momentos that tourists are
meant to devour.
As we anticipated, the
glamorous dining room pro
vided the setting and entertain
ment we enjoyed the most.
There, we examined and
devoured amazing samples of
delectable delights for the
student-starved palate. The
fabulous meals are served in
two sittings, and the pas
sengers are required to sit at
previously assigned tables to
enjoy the food and beverages.
Although wine is an extra ex
pense, all meals are included
in the cruise price. And enjoy
they do. Most of the partying
starts in the dining room and
ends in the disco at 6 a.m.
The culinary spread offered
everything from poached sal
mon, steak, prime rib and
king crab to baked Alaska,

New York cheesecake and an
incredible variety of cheeses,
fruits, and salads. And, if you
prefer to eat at your own
leisure, there are buffet break
fasts and lunches, afternoon
teas and midnight snacks
available each day at the Cafe
Miramar.
Ensenada provided the per
fect getaway from the hustle
bustle on the ship. Though En
senada is dominated by
touristy shops and bars,
(famous Hussongs, for in
stance) there is a lot to see
outside the downtown area
for the adventurer who
desires a little of the real cul
ture. We walked as far as time

allowed toward the outer
limits of the small town, ob
serving Mexican families in
their poor, modest dwellings,
at work and at play. We later
indulged in dirt-cheap mar
garitas, quesadillas and
chimichangas at a prototypical
Mexican cafe. And, of course,
we inevitably found the un
commonly cheap liquor of the

southern country — tequila
(about $2 per liter) and Kahlua
(about $5 per liter). Take ad
vantage of the material and
edible bargains to be found in
the great markets of En
senada! You'll find it's a hard
decision whether to spend the
evening exploring the port
town or returning to the ship
where your elegant dinner

and entertainment awaits you.
Nobody makes it easy for you,
that's for sure.
Unfortunately, your trip
ends much quicker than you
would wish. The north-bound
cruise is twice as long, giving
the passengers a whole day
and night to continue partying
on the ship. Even if the wea
ther is a little soggy we guaran

tee you'll always find someth
ing to do whether you join the
morning aerobics classes or
recline at the theater tor three
different movies in a row. The
cruise staff also provides a dai
ly array of card games, tourna
ments, sporting competitions
and skeet shooting.
All in all, the friendly Greek
captain, Dimitrios Mylonas,
and his efficient staff ot 325
people do a great |ob running
the ship and making sure the
passengers don't litt a finger.
A word of warning: Don't let
the "party ship" image mis
lead you. While the Azure
Seas attracts a much younger
crowd than most ships, most
passengers are still 30 to 60
years old. We recommend
that the potential Azure Seas
passenger travel with at least
one or more friends thev
know very well, or travel
during the weeks that most
likely would attract passengers
his own age. As a single, it
might be more tun to travel
during the spring or summer
months. In any case, you'll no
doubt always find people
aboard the S.S. Azure Seas
who love to meet people and
party hard. Why else would
they be there? Remember,
there are no strangers aboard
a cruise ship, only passengers
you haven't met yet. Bon
voyage!
