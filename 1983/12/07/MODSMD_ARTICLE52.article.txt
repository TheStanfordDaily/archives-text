# Advice on etiquette for first-time cruisers

What to Wear: During the day dress
aboard ship is casual. Shorts and shirts
are generally acceptable everywhere
aboard ship except in the dining room.
A sweatsuit will serve as a useful
coverup to get you into the dining
room. Evenings aboard ships are gen
erally much more formal than on land.
Most ships require men to wear jack
ets and ties in all public rooms after 6
p.m. Ladies are asked to wear dresses
or fancy pantsuits. Most ships will also
have one or two formal nights when
most gentlemen will wear tuxedos. As
the Azure Seas is a more informal ship,
a tuxedo is not required. During win
ter cruises be prepared for cool nights
and possible rain.
Dining Reservations: Whenever
going on a cruise be sure to write to

the cruise line requesting the
preferred second seating of dinner
well in advance of your departure.
Most passengers find the first sitting
too early (generally around 5:30 p.m.).
The second seating leaves time for a
leisurely meal before the night's enter
tainment begins. (Second seating is
usually at 8 p.m.).
Seasickness: Seasoned sailors will tell
you that seasickness is all in your head.
None the less, it does happen to some
passengers (just ask Brenda Pascoe,
The Daily's reviewer). Never fear,
modern medicine can do wonders to
stop the perpetual motion. The most
common seasickness cure is
Dramamine, which can be purchased
over the counter at any drug store.
Once aboard the ship, the ship's doc
tor will be glad to give a shot seditive,

but at a moderate fee. A new device,
which looks like a small Band-Aid and
is attached behind your ear has proven
very effective. It requires a prescrip
tion so be sure to see a doctor before
you set sail if you want to try this new
seasickness patch.
Tipping: Upon the end of your cruise
you will be expected to tip your dining
room waiter and busboy as well as
cabin steward (maid). The typical tip is
$2 per person per day. Thus on a three
day cruise you would tip your waiter,
busboy, and room steward $6 each.
You should not tip any of the ship's of
ficers or the cruise directors.

ships, including a summer on the
