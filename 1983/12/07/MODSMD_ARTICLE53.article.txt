## Is stress really an unavoidable aspect of finals? Attention to testing methods can make exams healthier for students 
### 
This column is addressed to
the faculty. At finals time many
students exhibit unhealthy be
havior. They eat too much, es
pecially low nutritional foods
high in sugar, don't exercise,
don't get enough sleep,
become highly stressed, etc.
The reason for these be
haviors is simple: They want
to get a good grade in your
course. What I would like to
ask you to do is to consider
how the examination process
in your course could be
structured to create a relevant
academic experience, while at
the same time reducing un
healthy behaviors. To para
phrase Dr. John Farquhar,
director of the Stanford Heart
Disease Prevention Program,
"The Stanford way of life need
not be hazardous to a stu
dent's health."
Most professors probably
have not given much thought
to this subject. In my
"Optimal Health and Fitness"
course I once had a panel of
professors who had won the
Gores award for excellence in
teaching discuss this question
of stress as a function of
course structure. Prior to that
discussion, none of them had
considered this question in
determining the exam process
in their courses. Having been
both a teacher and student at
Stanford, and as a person with
a professional interest in this
question, I would like to share
with you my thoughts on the
subject.
One cause of stress in the
academic process is the lack of
interaction between faculty
and students. I know you have
office hours and few students
come, but remember that stu
dents are 18 to 22 years old

and you are one of the leading
experts in the world in your
field. Remember when you
were 18? Wouldn't you have
been intimidated by you? One
way to break this barrier is to
hold office hours on their turf,
not yours. For example, meet
with students at Tresidder or
in their dorms. Another way to
break the ice is to learn their
names. The most efficient way
to do this in large classes is to

take their picture. Prof. James
March used this method when
he was teaching in the School
of Education. If you record
their names on the back of the
picture, you can easily learn
the names of all the students
in a class of 100 or more.
The biggest cause of un
healthy behavior results from
the testing process. There are
three elements involved here:
• The student does not

know what the exam will cover
and thus spends endless
hours trying to learn and re
learn everything.
•The student is denied
access to course materials
during the test and is thus
forced to memorize material
which is quickly forgotten af
terward.
• The time for the exam is
fixed and the exam is of such
length as to require all of it,

thus putting extra pressure on
the student.
Some professors have
developed solutions to these
problems. Prof. Michael Brat
man teaches a phil osophy
course which has a series of
short essays for the final exam.
Bratman gives students some
10 questions in advance and
says that the actual final will
consist of perhaps five of this
group. Since the questions

cover the gamut of topics in
the course, the student in pre
paring for the exam reviews
the entire course. This format
enables the student to intel
ligently prepare for the final
and, at the same time,
removes the stress associated
with not knowing what will be
on the test.
Asst. Consulting Prof. Jerry
Talley in sociology has
developed an exam format

which allows for use of books
and notes during the test. Tal
ley prepares a written essay
discussing course concepts
and containing a number' of
plausible, yet incorrect, state
ments. The task of the student
is to edit the paper, correcting
the false statements. The stu
dent is allowed to refer to
books and notes in this
process. This format also al
lows the student to provide
correct answers in his or her
own words, thereby reducing
the problem on multiple
choice tests where the student
knows the information, but is
not certain how to express it
because the choices are un
clear.
Prof. Philip Zimbardo
believes that learning involves
"mastery of material" and that
students acquire this mastery
at different rates. In his Psy
chology 1 course, Zimbardo
uses a test format which al
lows each student to be ex
amined at his or her own rate.
The student contacts a student
proctor, who then administers
a test for each chapter or sec
tion of the course. In this way
the time pressure associated
with taking a two or three
hour exam is eliminated.
There are numerous other
examples I could cite and I do
not mean to imply that Stan
ford professors are insensitive
to this question. But as we
head into another round of
finals, and as you begin to
prepare for future courses, I
ask you to give some thought
to the effect of your courses,
and in particular the examina
tion process on the health
of your students.
