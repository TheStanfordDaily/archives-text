## 'Broken Earth' too fragmented 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
"Broken Earth: The Rural
Chinese," by Steven Mosher,
The Free Press, $17.95

Though a "good read,"
anthropologist and former
Stanford Ph.D. candidate
Steven Mosher's new book
falls between the cracks.
"Broken Earth" describes
the rural Chinese who face a
double bind created by the
contradictions between tradi
tional Chinese values and the
Communist Party's. Mosher's
book suffers from similar divi
sions rooted in the contradic
tions between traditional
anthropological methods and
journalistic style. Both the
reader who expects an exact
ing scientific study and the
one wanting a chatty journalis
tic account of life in a modern
Chinese village will be disap
pointed.
Finding the correct way to
approach the book would not
be so important were it not for
the controversy surrounding
its author. It is almost
impossible to open "Broken
Earth" without wondering
whether Mosher is going to
relate the story of his time in
China, or attempt to shore up
his case for reinstatement at
Stanford.
Mosher was expelled from
the University last February by
unanimous vote of an Anthro
pology Department commit
tee. They charged him with
"illegal and seriously unethi
cal conduct" during his stay in
China to pursue the research
upon which this book is
based. The author has ap
pealed the case several times
and the matter will be
reviewed for a final decision
by University President
Donald Kennedy next month.
Throughout this contro
versy, which has received na
tional publicity, Mosher has

claimed that Stanford dis
missed him due to pressure
'from the People's Republic of
China. The PRC government
was angered by an article,
which Mosher published in
Taiwan, about abortion
practices in rural China. But
neither the University nor
Mosher has released the spe
cific reasons for the dismissal,
saying full disclosure would
endanger people still in the
PRC.
Those looking to "Broken
Earth" for an answer to the
Mosher mystery will be disap
pointed: The matter is taste
fully absent from the book's
dust cover, and there is not
much more inside. But
reminders of the need for
secrecy pop up throughout
the book. This enforced con
fidentiality, though understan
dable, is one reason for the
book's lack of a clear identity,
be it academic or journalistic.
The book emerges as a se
ries ot moving and profoundly
depressing vignettes that ex
plode the Western mvth of the
model commune: These
aren't fireworks quotes in the
United States, but in China
they're revelations.
— A peasant on cadres:
"Everyone is out for them
selves, especially cadres."
— A father on education: "My
son was not stupid, it was just
that he was taught nothing in
the schools. The highest
grades were always given to
those with the correct political
thought and school was fre
quently canceled or given
over to political meetings."
— A former Red Guard on
youth in China: "Mao
betrayed us ... . Out of its
collective experience was
born Youth, not as a special
and privileged stage of life as
in the West, but as a bitter and
disadvantaged one."
— A village wife on women's

liberation: "Women are kept
down to the eighteenth level
of hell .... People would
have to work harder with wo
men in charge, but of course
they won't be put in charge."
Mosher certainly has a jour
nalist's flair for getting people
to tell him things they would
tell no one else. For a re
searcher in the PRC, his ac
complishment is nothing short
of phenomenal. Mosher's
book provides some of the
most revealing glimpses of the
rural Chinese to be published
in the last few years.
But these interviews only
tantalize. Definite conclusions
or analysis are avoided. For

reasons of confident-ialitv.
Mosher cannot produce a
sketch of the village he lived
in. And because his experi
ence in China was specific to
the province of Guangdong, it
would be presumptuous for
him to make generalizations
about all of China.
In his introduction, Mosher
qualifies his approach by
saying he has postponed
"statistical analysis and
sociological generalization."
Accepting this qualification,
the general reader will still
yearn for a definite analysis.
We can only wait for the
hoped-for sequel, to fill in the
gaps left by Mosher' s first in
stallment.

"Broken Earth: The Rural
Chinese," by Steven Mosher,
The Free Press, $17.95

Though a "good read,"
anthropologist and former
Stanford Ph.D. candidate
Steven Mosher's new book
falls between the cracks.
"Broken Earth" describes
the rural Chinese who face a
double bind created by the
contradictions between tradi
tional Chinese values and the
Communist Party's. Mosher's
book suffers from similar divi
sions rooted in the contradic
tions between traditional
anthropological methods and
journalistic style. Both the
reader who expects an exact
ing scientific study and the
one wanting a chatty journalis
tic account of life in a modern
Chinese village will be disap
pointed.
Finding the correct way to
approach the book would not
be so important were it not for
the controversy surrounding
its author. It is almost
impossible to open "Broken
Earth" without wondering
whether Mosher is going to
relate the story of his time in
China, or attempt to shore up
his case for reinstatement at
Stanford.
Mosher was expelled from
the University last February by
unanimous vote of an Anthro
pology Department commit
tee. They charged him with
"illegal and seriously unethi
cal conduct" during his stay in
China to pursue the research
upon which this book is
based. The author has ap
pealed the case several times
and the matter will be
reviewed for a final decision
by University President
Donald Kennedy next month.
Throughout this contro
versy, which has received na
tional publicity, Mosher has

claimed that Stanford dis
missed him due to pressure
'from the People's Republic of
China. The PRC government
was angered by an article,
which Mosher published in
Taiwan, about abortion
practices in rural China. But
neither the University nor
Mosher has released the spe
cific reasons for the dismissal,
saying full disclosure would
endanger people still in the
PRC.
Those looking to "Broken
Earth" for an answer to the
Mosher mystery will be disap
pointed: The matter is taste
fully absent from the book's
dust cover, and there is not
much more inside. But
reminders of the need for
secrecy pop up throughout
the book. This enforced con
fidentiality, though understan
dable, is one reason for the
book's lack of a clear identity,
be it academic or journalistic.
The book emerges as a se
ries ot moving and profoundly
depressing vignettes that ex
plode the Western mvth of the
model commune: These
aren't fireworks quotes in the
United States, but in China
they're revelations.
— A peasant on cadres:
"Everyone is out for them
selves, especially cadres."
— A father on education: "My
son was not stupid, it was just
that he was taught nothing in
the schools. The highest
grades were always given to
those with the correct political
thought and school was fre
quently canceled or given
over to political meetings."
— A former Red Guard on
youth in China: "Mao
betrayed us ... . Out of its
collective experience was
born Youth, not as a special
and privileged stage of life as
in the West, but as a bitter and
disadvantaged one."
— A village wife on women's

liberation: "Women are kept
down to the eighteenth level
of hell .... People would
have to work harder with wo
men in charge, but of course
they won't be put in charge."
Mosher certainly has a jour
nalist's flair for getting people
to tell him things they would
tell no one else. For a re
searcher in the PRC, his ac
complishment is nothing short
of phenomenal. Mosher's
book provides some of the
most revealing glimpses of the
rural Chinese to be published
in the last few years.
But these interviews only
tantalize. Definite conclusions
or analysis are avoided. For

reasons of confident-ialitv.
Mosher cannot produce a
sketch of the village he lived
in. And because his experi
ence in China was specific to
the province of Guangdong, it
would be presumptuous for
him to make generalizations
about all of China.
In his introduction, Mosher
qualifies his approach by
saying he has postponed
"statistical analysis and
sociological generalization."
Accepting this qualification,
the general reader will still
yearn for a definite analysis.
We can only wait for the
hoped-for sequel, to fill in the
gaps left by Mosher' s first in
stallment.
