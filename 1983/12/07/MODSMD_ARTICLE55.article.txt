# Hansen makes Old West more real than the new
## 
### MIKE HALE 
"The Assassination of
Jesse James by the
Coward Robert Ford," by
Ron Hansen, Alfred A.
Knopf, 304 pp., $14.95
The event from which
Ron Hansen's second novel
takes its name occurs two
thirds of the way through
the novel. Following it is a
long epilogue titled
"Americana," in which we
follow lesse James' and
Bob Ford's post
assassination careers:
James' posthumous exalta
tion as an American folk
hero (that is, beyond the
stature he already enjoyed
while living) and the many
ways in which people made
money from his legend,
and Ford's flight from the
general condemnation that
greeted his act (at the same
time as he, too, made
money from his status as
the killer of Jesse James). In
both "The Assassination of
Jesse James" and his first
novel, "Desperadoes" —
another historical-fictional
treatment of the American
West, dealing in this case
with the Dalton gang —
Hansen has been inter
ested in how the outlaws of
the Old West were used by,
and made use of, the great
American publicity appara
tus .
There's a problem with
fiction that takes the above
as one of its major themes
— Hansen's novels them
selves, no matter how well
researched and objective
they might be, are also the
latest versions of the very
myths they set out to
deconstruct. You can say it

doesn't matter — they're
novels, after all — but Han
sen's style is one of such
absolute authority that the
reader finds himself taking
the stories as history, and
when some detail makes
him stop and say, "Is that
really the way it hap
pened?", it takes a minute
to remember the books are
fiction.
Moving parallel to this is
another theme in Hansen's
work that, while never
stated explicitly, is at the
heart of how and why the
novels were written: What
should we think, today,
about men who killed and
robbed for a living, usually
in the most random fas
hion; and what can we
think about them, given the
fence of myth that has
grown up around them in
the meantime? Here we
arrive at why Hansen called
the last chapter of the new
novel "Americana" — in
both books we are pre
sented with a peculiarly
American situation, where
young, talented, bored
men with great ambitions
but no idea of where to ful
fill them — by the period
dealt with in the novels, the
last three decades of the
19th century, California had
been annexed and settled
— casually turn to crime in
a conscious effort to "be
someone," with never —
or at best seldom — a
thought about the moral
implications of their
choice.
Hansen exploited this
tension beautifully in
"Desperadoes," which was
a first-person narrative told
by Emmett Dalton, the

younger brother of gang
leader Bob Dal ton, who
survived the Coffeyville
massacre and prospered in
Hollywood in the 20th cen
tury. By telling the story
from the inside, Hansen
could feign an innocence
and lack of concern with
moral ambiguities he
wouldn't be allowed as a
historian, or omniscient
narrator. Emmett Dalton
told the story well, but he
didn't spend much time
reflecting and his only
regret was that his brother
Bob had died. "The Assas
sination of Jesse James" is
told in the third person,
and Hansen occasionally
enters the story to judge (in
a gentle way), or explain
things for us. These mo
ments disrupt the novel,
and take away from the
strength it shares with
"Desperadoes" — the in
sistence that we make up
our own minds.
All of this matters be
cause Hansen (who com
pleted "Desperadoes"
while on a Stegner Fellow
ship in the Creative Writing
Program here) is one of the
most accomplished prose
stylists in the country. "The
Assassination" would be
worth reading even if it
were a mere retelling of the
events, with no higher
goals. Hansen's recrea
tion of an important mo
ment in America's psycho
logical history is as convinc
ing as the best of Balzac,
and his recreations of the
famous bloodbaths at Cof
feyville, Kansas, and
Northfield, Minnesota, are
as compelling as any Peck
inpah montage.

"The Assassination of
Jesse James by the
Coward Robert Ford," by
Ron Hansen, Alfred A.
Knopf, 304 pp., $14.95
The event from which
Ron Hansen's second novel
takes its name occurs two
thirds of the way through
the novel. Following it is a
long epilogue titled
"Americana," in which we
follow lesse James' and
Bob Ford's post
assassination careers:
James' posthumous exalta
tion as an American folk
hero (that is, beyond the
stature he already enjoyed
while living) and the many
ways in which people made
money from his legend,
and Ford's flight from the
general condemnation that
greeted his act (at the same
time as he, too, made
money from his status as
the killer of Jesse James). In
both "The Assassination of
Jesse James" and his first
novel, "Desperadoes" —
another historical-fictional
treatment of the American
West, dealing in this case
with the Dalton gang —
Hansen has been inter
ested in how the outlaws of
the Old West were used by,
and made use of, the great
American publicity appara
tus .
There's a problem with
fiction that takes the above
as one of its major themes
— Hansen's novels them
selves, no matter how well
researched and objective
they might be, are also the
latest versions of the very
myths they set out to
deconstruct. You can say it

doesn't matter — they're
novels, after all — but Han
sen's style is one of such
absolute authority that the
reader finds himself taking
the stories as history, and
when some detail makes
him stop and say, "Is that
really the way it hap
pened?", it takes a minute
to remember the books are
fiction.
Moving parallel to this is
another theme in Hansen's
work that, while never
stated explicitly, is at the
heart of how and why the
novels were written: What
should we think, today,
about men who killed and
robbed for a living, usually
in the most random fas
hion; and what can we
think about them, given the
fence of myth that has
grown up around them in
the meantime? Here we
arrive at why Hansen called
the last chapter of the new
novel "Americana" — in
both books we are pre
sented with a peculiarly
American situation, where
young, talented, bored
men with great ambitions
but no idea of where to ful
fill them — by the period
dealt with in the novels, the
last three decades of the
19th century, California had
been annexed and settled
— casually turn to crime in
a conscious effort to "be
someone," with never —
or at best seldom — a
thought about the moral
implications of their
choice.
Hansen exploited this
tension beautifully in
"Desperadoes," which was
a first-person narrative told
by Emmett Dalton, the

younger brother of gang
leader Bob Dal ton, who
survived the Coffeyville
massacre and prospered in
Hollywood in the 20th cen
tury. By telling the story
from the inside, Hansen
could feign an innocence
and lack of concern with
moral ambiguities he
wouldn't be allowed as a
historian, or omniscient
narrator. Emmett Dalton
told the story well, but he
didn't spend much time
reflecting and his only
regret was that his brother
Bob had died. "The Assas
sination of Jesse James" is
told in the third person,
and Hansen occasionally
enters the story to judge (in
a gentle way), or explain
things for us. These mo
ments disrupt the novel,
and take away from the
strength it shares with
"Desperadoes" — the in
sistence that we make up
our own minds.
All of this matters be
cause Hansen (who com
pleted "Desperadoes"
while on a Stegner Fellow
ship in the Creative Writing
Program here) is one of the
most accomplished prose
stylists in the country. "The
Assassination" would be
worth reading even if it
were a mere retelling of the
events, with no higher
goals. Hansen's recrea
tion of an important mo
ment in America's psycho
logical history is as convinc
ing as the best of Balzac,
and his recreations of the
famous bloodbaths at Cof
feyville, Kansas, and
Northfield, Minnesota, are
as compelling as any Peck
inpah montage.
