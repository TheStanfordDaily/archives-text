## ACT murders 'Dial 'M'' 
### MELINDA ISRAEL 
When the audience at the opening night of
the American Conservatory Theatre's Dial 'M'
for Murder found the climactic mid-play death
amusing, I knew something was amiss. Instead
of chills, this production's struggle-and-stab
scene elicited chuckles from theater-goers.
Somewhere along the line, the classic thriller
had been betrayed. Discovering the fatal flaw
was hardly an insurmountable task, however,
since the culprit had left a none-too-subtle trail
of errors.
Awkward in their opening scene, ACT
players Barbara Dirickson and John Hertzler
seemed to have trouble easing into their roles
as former adulterous lovers. Dirickson (as Mrs.
Margo Wendice) was distracting as she self
consciously swished around in a tightly
bodiced maroon satin dress, displaying all the
traits of a '50s breathy blonde. I took her
pseudo-sophisticated diction for an unfortun
ate affectation until the dialogue made clear
she was supposed to be British.
Hertzler's portrayal of Max, the "American
television writer," consisted mostly of a lack of
refinement — in other words, shoving his
hands into pockets and slouching. After endur
ing the exaggerated interplay of these two, the
entrance of Peter Donat as husband Tony
Wendice confirmed my suspicions.
Even more stiffly caricatured than his fellow
actors, Donat's tight gestures soon clued me
in: Everything was too unnatural. This criticism
might seem inappropriate to a mystery-thriller
(after all, isn't murder an unnatural occasion?)
but actually, the contrary is true. To really carry
off a skin-chiller the characters must be acces
sibly real from the outset, so that when the dag
ger is sunk the audience is involved enough to
be surprised and at least a little frightened.
ACT's Dial 'M' is simply too artificial to be con
vincing. Every overly-orchestrated movement
reminds us that it's only a play.
In this case, the clues suggest a deliberate
plan on the part of director Edward Hastings.
Shooting for an air of "suspense," Hastings ap
parently intended the stilted onstage action to
create an overall tension.
Granted, the first act of Dial 'M' — and most
mysteries — is the hardest to perform. By
necessity, Act I sets up the intricate plot which
will slowly unfold. And Frederick Knott's Dial
'M' relies unusually on its opening scenes,
since the play's ensuing events deviate from
the traditional "whodunnit." We know all
along when, why and how Tony Wendice plans
to do in his wife — it's just a question of whe
ther he'll pull it off. Both his plotting and the
play's plot seem to guarantee success, but nei

ther, as we see, are foolproof.
As Tony's crime falls short, so does ACT's ef
forts at a quality production. For although Dial
'M' picks up in the second and third acts, the
injection of vitality comes more from the script
than from the acting.
In fact, Dirickson as Margo — the only wo
man in the play — never ventures outside the
1950s wife-as-ornament or woman-as-victim
stereotypes. From airheaded to mousy
submissive, Dirickson robs her character of any
depth and ultimately any audience sympathy.
Particularly in this straitlaced production, a
more liberated Margo would have been
welcome.
The problem with Donat as Tony Wendice is
his failure to be a convincing tennis-star-gone
villain. Donat's interpretation of the role
produces a single-minded, detached and
wound-up little man.
Of the cast, only Ray Reinhardt's elegant em
bodiment of Capt. Lesgate, the Scotland Yard
sleuth, does justice to a role.
What ACT's version of Dial 'M' lacks most of
all is anything new. When such an established
theater takes on such a familiar play, one would
expect at least a polished performance and per
haps a bit of creativity as well.
But whether the production is innovative or
not, one would not expect the unappealing
show ACT delivers. On opening night the plot
landed predictably in our laps, but the real
mystery — why our spines stayed untingled —
was yet to be solved.

than from the acting.
In fact, Dirickson as Margo — the only wo
man in the play — never ventures outside the
1950s wife-as-ornament or woman-as-victim
stereotypes. From airheaded to mousy
submissive, Dirickson robs her character of any
depth and ultimately any audience sympathy.
Particularly in this straitlaced production, a
more liberated Margo would have been
welcome.
The problem with Donat as Tony Wendice is
his failure to be a convincing tennis-star-gone
villain. Donat's interpretation of the role
produces a single-minded, detached and
wound-up little man.
Of the cast, only Ray Reinhardt's elegant em
bodiment of Capt. Lesgate, the Scotland Yard
sleuth, does justice to a role.
What ACT's version of Dial 'M' lacks most of
all is anything new. When such an established
theater takes on such a familiar play, one would
expect at least a polished performance and per
haps a bit of creativity as well.
But whether the production is innovative or
not, one would not expect the unappealing
show ACT delivers. On opening night the plot
landed predictably in our laps, but the real
mystery — why our spines stayed untingled —
was yet to be solved.
