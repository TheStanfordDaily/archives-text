# Cage captivates Davies audience
## 
### KARL JOHNSEN 
This was not your usual
Stanford experience, but an
unusual symphonic phenome
non. Words with any connota
tion of the ordinary cannot
describe the effect john Cage
has on his audiences. As he
himself said, "Each person
must have his own experi
ence, since it is impossible for
him to have someone else's."
Thus began the profound
event of his first appearance
with the San Francisco Sym
phony on Nov. 25, as he read
and introduced some of his
most famous works to a highly
appreciative audience.

Cage is, above all, a person
ality. His work began with
music, but now extends to in
clude writing and etching.
Born in Los Angeles in 1912,

he pioneered the musical cen
ter of the avant garde move
ment in the United States
since WWII, and was
repeatedly being recognized
for his extensions of the
boundaries of music in his
work with the percussion or
chestra and his invention of
the prepared piano.
His addition of other sound
sources, including radios,
magnetic tape, aluminum
sheets, tin cans, brake sound
and doorbell buzzers, attest to
his revolutionary ideas of
sound, silence and duration.
His discovery of Zen led to
other radical principles; he

desires to divorce the ego or
psychological memory from
his composition, to tree him
self from all habit and tradi
tion. He creates a new kind of
music by dissolving the bonds
of tradition in the randomness
of chance. This new music
delighted the crowd, though
at times it had confusing and
bewildering effects.
To confuse such a diverse
audience was no small ac
complishment. Members of all
social classes and ages were
represented, proving the wide
appeal of Cage's creativity.
Davies Hall has rarely enter
tained such a different crowd
in its short history. Quite a few
of the young avant garde came
in full New Romantic regalia,
complete with cellophaned
hairdos, mini-skirts, leather
jackets and crew cuts. Prob
ably the most unexpected was
the large portion of elderly,
who were nearly as populous
as the younger generation.
Cage's fondness for chal
lenge and detail easily bewil
dered the crowd, with
opening selections from Com
position in Retrospect. The
body of this work consists of a
series of mesostics (like an
acrostic but with the word
running down the middle in
stead of at the beginning)
forming stream-of
consciousness prose. This
form is difficult to understand
in a prose reading, as the top
ics encountered may change
rapidly from diligence to the
energy crisis. A selection from
his Writing through Finnegan's
Wake illustrates this:
Just a whisk
Of
pitV
a Cloud
in pEace and silence.
His selections were
sometimes humorous, but as
evocative as the previous pas
sage, and his thoughtful
reading elucidated the more

obscure sections, allowing a
deeper glimpse into his
genius.
Selections for the evening's
performance were largely
retrospective; First Construc
tion (1939), Credo in Us (1942)
and Concert for Piano and Or
chestra (1957-8) were first per
formed over 25 years ago. The
remaining piece, MUOYCE
(198.1), is largely a literary work
— the only music involved was
Cage's chant. Although one
might inter from this that Cage
has moved away from music
into the literary field, he also
talked about his most recent
musical endeavors involving
random generation in violin
music. He has, however, en
countered problems due to
the extreme difficulty of fin
gering in some of the
passages.
After answering questions
and discussing his views of
perception and experience,
the orchestra came on to per
form First Construction (in
Metal), a polyglot of
European, Asian and hybrid
percussion instruments. The
enthralling rhythms are
founded on arithmetic means
of rhythmic measurement,
creating crystalline structures
where the shape of the small
est part is echoed in the larger
ones. Polyrhythms also appear
in this work — fives set against
fours set against threes and so
on — which lend a compli
cated texture to the music
and contribute to its unity.
New instruments applied here
are thunder sheets and auto
brakedrums, which give this
piece its unique sonority.
Credo in Us (or U.S.) is a
parody on the American cul
ture of the '30s and '40s. After
Cage expressed his original
seriousness and sincerity in its
composition, saying it con
sisted of salient portions of
American life at the time —
pianos, doorbell buzzer,
radios, affluence, tin cans and

"music the world loves to
play" collections — he then
reflected on its humorous
aspects in recent years. Life
has come to exclude many of
the very things which he
chose as representative of our
culture due to routine
familiarity. This work was
among the first to incorporate
the rapidly developing tech
nology of the media in its
notated score.
This congenial and witty
style challenges us to examine
our conventions of taste and
habit without provoking anger
— he never accuses us of
being wrong, but continually
asks us if we are sure we are
right. Exactly this increases the
enjoyment of a Cage perfor
mance.
Created from a random
choice of letters, phrases and
syllables from Finnegan's
Wake, MUOYCE was read
after intermission. Cage
proudly said, "You could say
that I've made something new
out of something that was
already made!" The novelty of
unique creation generated
from previous creation obvi
ously excited him. He per
formed an Indian chant or
Muslim prayer, and the un
recognizable sounds formed a
garbled, thoroughly foreign
piece that may be as challeng
ing to the literary world as his
earlier works were to the mu
sical world.
This haunting reading was
followed by the return of the
orchestra to the stage for the
performance of Concert for
Piano and Orchestra, one of
Cage's most provocative
works. An explanation of this

piece is extremely difficult,
despite the overall simplicity
of the concepts behind its
composition. "My intention in
this piece was to hold together
extreme disparities, much as
one finds them held together
in the natural world, as, for in
stance, in a forest or a city
street." The individual dis
parate personalities of the or
chestra members were evi
dent through gargling, wind
up toys, shrieks and noise
makers, but permitting this
fuller range of self expression
to the players served also to
show their interconnected
ness.

The enthusiasm Cage exhib
ited in hearing his works per
formed was evidence of the
fine job the symphony did in
presenting his work. The
rousing applause for an
encore paid tribute to this
man who instills a sense of in
dependence and enjoins a
response of growth — there
was simply no way to extend
such a performance.

— the only music involved was
Cage's chant. Although one
might inter from this that Cage
has moved away from music
into the literary field, he also
talked about his most recent
musical endeavors involving
random generation in violin
music. He has, however, en
countered problems due to
the extreme difficulty of fin
gering in some of the
passages.
After answering questions
and discussing his views of
perception and experience,
the orchestra came on to per
form First Construction (in
Metal), a polyglot of
European, Asian and hybrid
percussion instruments. The
enthralling rhythms are
founded on arithmetic means
of rhythmic measurement,
creating crystalline structures
where the shape of the small
est part is echoed in the larger
ones. Polyrhythms also appear
in this work — fives set against
fours set against threes and so
on — which lend a compli
cated texture to the music
and contribute to its unity.
New instruments applied here
are thunder sheets and auto
brakedrums, which give this
piece its unique sonority.
Credo in Us (or U.S.) is a
parody on the American cul
ture of the '30s and '40s. After
Cage expressed his original
seriousness and sincerity in its
composition, saying it con
sisted of salient portions of
American life at the time —
pianos, doorbell buzzer,
radios, affluence, tin cans and

"music the world loves to
play" collections — he then
reflected on its humorous
aspects in recent years. Life
has come to exclude many of
the very things which he
chose as representative of our
culture due to routine
familiarity. This work was
among the first to incorporate
the rapidly developing tech
nology of the media in its
notated score.
This congenial and witty
style challenges us to examine
our conventions of taste and
habit without provoking anger
— he never accuses us of
being wrong, but continually
asks us if we are sure we are
right. Exactly this increases the
enjoyment of a Cage perfor
mance.
Created from a random
choice of letters, phrases and
syllables from Finnegan's
Wake, MUOYCE was read
after intermission. Cage
proudly said, "You could say
that I've made something new
out of something that was
already made!" The novelty of
unique creation generated
from previous creation obvi
ously excited him. He per
formed an Indian chant or
Muslim prayer, and the un
recognizable sounds formed a
garbled, thoroughly foreign
piece that may be as challeng
ing to the literary world as his
earlier works were to the mu
sical world.
This haunting reading was
followed by the return of the
orchestra to the stage for the
performance of Concert for
Piano and Orchestra, one of
Cage's most provocative
works. An explanation of this

piece is extremely difficult,
despite the overall simplicity
of the concepts behind its
composition. "My intention in
this piece was to hold together
extreme disparities, much as
one finds them held together
in the natural world, as, for in
stance, in a forest or a city
street." The individual dis
parate personalities of the or
chestra members were evi
dent through gargling, wind
up toys, shrieks and noise
makers, but permitting this
fuller range of self expression
to the players served also to
show their interconnected
ness.

The enthusiasm Cage exhib
ited in hearing his works per
formed was evidence of the
fine job the symphony did in
presenting his work. The
rousing applause for an
encore paid tribute to this
man who instills a sense of in
dependence and enjoins a
response of growth — there
was simply no way to extend
such a performance.

This was not your usual
Stanford experience, but an
unusual symphonic phenome
non. Words with any connota
tion of the ordinary cannot
describe the effect john Cage
has on his audiences. As he
himself said, "Each person
must have his own experi
ence, since it is impossible for
him to have someone else's."
Thus began the profound
event of his first appearance
with the San Francisco Sym
phony on Nov. 25, as he read
and introduced some of his
most famous works to a highly
appreciative audience.

Cage is, above all, a person
ality. His work began with
music, but now extends to in
clude writing and etching.
Born in Los Angeles in 1912,

he pioneered the musical cen
ter of the avant garde move
ment in the United States
since WWII, and was
repeatedly being recognized
for his extensions of the
boundaries of music in his
work with the percussion or
chestra and his invention of
the prepared piano.
His addition of other sound
sources, including radios,
magnetic tape, aluminum
sheets, tin cans, brake sound
and doorbell buzzers, attest to
his revolutionary ideas of
sound, silence and duration.
His discovery of Zen led to
other radical principles; he

desires to divorce the ego or
psychological memory from
his composition, to tree him
self from all habit and tradi
tion. He creates a new kind of
music by dissolving the bonds
of tradition in the randomness
of chance. This new music
delighted the crowd, though
at times it had confusing and
bewildering effects.
To confuse such a diverse
audience was no small ac
complishment. Members of all
social classes and ages were
represented, proving the wide
appeal of Cage's creativity.
Davies Hall has rarely enter
tained such a different crowd
in its short history. Quite a few
of the young avant garde came
in full New Romantic regalia,
complete with cellophaned
hairdos, mini-skirts, leather
jackets and crew cuts. Prob
ably the most unexpected was
the large portion of elderly,
who were nearly as populous
as the younger generation.
Cage's fondness for chal
lenge and detail easily bewil
dered the crowd, with
opening selections from Com
position in Retrospect. The
body of this work consists of a
series of mesostics (like an
acrostic but with the word
running down the middle in
stead of at the beginning)
forming stream-of
consciousness prose. This
form is difficult to understand
in a prose reading, as the top
ics encountered may change
rapidly from diligence to the
energy crisis. A selection from
his Writing through Finnegan's
Wake illustrates this:
Just a whisk
Of
pitV
a Cloud
in pEace and silence.
His selections were
sometimes humorous, but as
evocative as the previous pas
sage, and his thoughtful
reading elucidated the more

obscure sections, allowing a
deeper glimpse into his
genius.
Selections for the evening's
performance were largely
retrospective; First Construc
tion (1939), Credo in Us (1942)
and Concert for Piano and Or
chestra (1957-8) were first per
formed over 25 years ago. The
remaining piece, MUOYCE
(198.1), is largely a literary work
