# Not a good 'Deal' at all
## 
### JIM TASSOPULOS 
Deal of the Century, a supposed black
comedy about the arms race, fails on every
imaginable level. Not only are there no
scenes of intelligent humor, there are vir
tually no humorous scenes whatsoever.
The movie's story attempts to reveal the
insanity surrounding the development and
sale of arms. However, most of the dis
jointed scenes simply take obvious shots at
caricatured representatives of arms dealers,
Third World leaders and government
leaders.
Chevy Chase plays a small time arms
dealer who stumbles onto a multi-million
dollar contract to sell a new pilot-less
airplane to a small Third World government.
His partner is Gregory Hines who has begun
to doubt his occupation since he has
decided to "give his life to Christ." Both
Chase and Hines are talented performers,
but they are given nothing funny to do or
say.
Chase's attempts to convince the leader
to buy the new airplane comprise most of
the story. Most of the scenes do more to
reinforce Latin American stereotypes than to
reveal any of the madness in the arms race.
Amazingly, the people responsible for this
disaster are screenwriter Paul Brickman and
director William Friedken. Brickman wrote
and directed Risky Business which boasted a

good deal of sharp, even insightful
dialogue. There are very few lines that even
ring true in Deal of the Century. The
dialogue is strewn with cliches, and the one
liners are mostly jokes and put-downs that
we have all heard many times before.
Maybe Brickman was so happy to find so
much obvious humor in the world of arms
and Third World dictators that he never took
the time to dig behind the surface. Calling a
military plane "peacekeeper" is simply not
enough.
Friedken, the director of The French Con
nection and The Exorcist, should have
realized that the script did not have enough
characterization to sustain a half-hour sit
com, let alone an entire film. The progres
sion of scenes is often arbitrary and confus
ing. There are no striking scenes visually.
The several attempts at slapstick are over
wrought and sometimes very cheap. There
is nothing funny about an old man falling
out of a wheelchair, especially in a film
which intends to be a sophisticated satire.
To write any more about this film is point
less unless one wishes to analyze all the ele
ments which combine to make a film go ter
ribly wrong. Everything is here . . . lousy
storytelling, stilted dialogue and scenes
which seem simply seem to exist with no
dramatic or comic purpose. For now, it is
sufficient to say that Deal of the Century" is
a film to stay far away from.
