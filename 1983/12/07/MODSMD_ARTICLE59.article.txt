# Strong acting, sequences in Terms of Endearment'

### STEVE VINEBERG 
I You know an actor has hit his stride
■ when, having given two or three first-rate
'] performances in a row, he exudes an air of
assurance and control from his initial ap
| pearance. It's a joy to watch, because we
= {• participate in his confidence, and knowing
| that an actor you love is firmly set on a win
ning track can guide you through some fair
ly rocky pictures. Dustin Hoffman, Burt
' Lancaster and Michael Caine all seem to be
enjoying a peak period right now, and with
his sensational performance as Garrett
Breedlove, a slightly seedy astronaut, in
Terms of Endearment, Jack Nicholson joins
their ranks.
! Nicholson passed through a frustrating,
r unproductive time a couple of years back;
' his work in movies like The Shining and The
% Postman Always Rings Twice was un-
I" restrained, intense in all the wrong ways,
Rand he couldn't shake his existential pall —
|j* it was almost unpleasant to watch him, but
H 'since he's such a magnetic camera subject
Ipyou could barely look away from him.
However, in both these films, his female
(Shelley Duvall and Jessica Lange)
P* gave far more intelligent, strongly shaped
Hand interesting performances, that slowly,
p inevitably, drew the focus of the audience.
(Nicholson must have learned something
valuable from the experiences of The
Shining and Postman, because when he
next appeared, in the supporting part of
Eugene O'Neill in Reds, his acting was so
centered and full, so economical and yet so
_ commanding, that you kept him in your
I head even when he was off screen. And in
last year's shamefully neglected The Bor
der, he gave his most understated and sym
pathetic performance in years (since The
Missouri Breaks, with Marlon Brando in
1976).
Technically, Garrett Breedlove is a sup
porting part, too, but as Nicholson plays
him, he dominates Terms of Endearment.
The key to Nicholson's triumph is his deci
sion to play stubbornly against the role as
the writer-director, James Brooks, has con
- ceived him. Terms of Endearment, which
began life as an oddball 1975 novel by Larry
McMurtry, is essentially a story about the
delicate balance two strong women, Aurora
and Emma Greenway, preserved in their
mother-daughter relationship; all the men
in their lives — husbands and lovers — are
weak and rather pathetic.
In adapting the book, Brooks retained
Emma's boyish academician husband, Flap
(Jeff Daniels), and her overzealous married
banker lover, Sam (John Lithgow, in a lovely

cameo), but he has faded Aurora's coterie
of suitors into the background and in
vented Garrett, quite reasonably, to parallel
the two women's lives. As written, Flap,
who can't pull himself out of an affair with a
grad student, and Garrett, who can't cope
with the respectability of a monogamous
lifestyle, are variations on the same charac
ter, who is somehow supposed to be ap
pealing despite — or perhaps because of —
his undependability and weak-mindedness.
McMurtry and Brooks must think there's
something sexy about ineffectual men,
though some of us in the audience may

protest when Emma (Debra Winger), having
sensibly walked out on Flap, decides
abruptly to take him back.
Jeff Daniels doesn't get anywhere with
Flap: He presents an opaque face to the
camera — close-ups decrease his charm —
and he gives the impression of being in a
quandary about how the character works.
Nicholson, on the other hand, takes over
the picture, because he refuses to admit
Garrett's weakness; he plays this hard
drinking, lecherous astronaut as so pleased
with the way he runs his own life that
anyone who criticizes him, including
Aurora (Shirley MacLaine), looks a little
foolish.
In his first scene, he falls flat on his face
while exiting from a parked car, and
proceeds to proposition the undergraduate
who escorted him home (after he'd given a
talk at her college) as if there were nothing
untoward about his position. She hands
him a lecture about how his disgraceful be
havior has disillusioned her — she ex
pected a hero — and he furrows his brow

and brushes a hair across it in a mock at
tempt at dignity. Brooks probably intended
this scene as a deglamorization of the
astronaut, but Nicholson turns it around
and makes it a comment on the undergrad
uate's naivete. The next time we see him,
he is asking Aurora out to lunch — or
rather, explaining to her why he didn't ask
her out to lunch — and what another actor
would have communicated as gaucherie
comes out as a brilliant parody of an
awkward schoolboy, and so incredibly
audacious that Aurora's fascination with
him makes perfect sense. Nicholson holds

this movie together, though he has to go
way past the resources of Brooks'
screenplay to do so.
The clue to what's wrong with Terms of
Endearment lies in the fact that Brooks was
so enamored of McMurtry's novel that he
wanted to film it for four years, and in the
parts he chose to emphasize. The book is
divided into two sections: "Emma's Moth
er, 1962" (360 pages), an unaffecting but
not unamusing series of increasingly out
landish episodes that reveal an unconven
tional comic temperament, and "Mrs.
Greenway's Daughter, 1971-1976" (50
pages), in which — in a bizarre shift of tone
— Emma's marriage begins to disintegrate
and she develops cancer. The end of the
novel is infuriating because McMurtry
hasn't made us care about the characters,
and yet he manipulates our emotions in the
most shameless manner — by resorting to
the pulp writer's strategy of sticking the
young heroine with a terminal disease. It
works for McMurtry, just as it worked for

Erich Segal in Love Story, but when you've
finished the book you feel cheap and badly
used.
In his adaptation, Brooks alters a great
many things about the novel, but not much
in those last 50 pages, and though he
swears up and down in interviews that the
movie's a comedy, audiences really
respond to it because it makes them weep.
(That's the reason behind the popularity of
the monotonous, semi-competent Testa
ment, too, despite all the high-flown talk
about its "importance" as a "document"
for our time.) Anyone who sees Terms of

Endearment as a comedy is bound to feel let
down and insulted when the courtship
scenes between Jack Nicholson and Shirley
MacLaine slide into the bathetic bog of
Debra Winger's malignancy. And though
Winger is terrific, especially in the first hour
— she's zesty, in a loose, improvisatory
style — even the young Lillian Gish would
have had trouble carrying off the scene in
which Emma says goodbye to her two sons.
Her older boy, Tommy (played by a young
actor named Troy Bishop who Brooks evi
dently believes is extremely expressive) is
dealing with his mother's illness just as he
has dealt with the marital discord at home
— by withdrawing and becoming sullen —
so she protects him aginst his own future
guilt by telling him that she knows he really
loves her. This is the kind of scene that
reviewers usually describe as "wise," but
it's the brand of wisdom that has kept TV
sponsors grinning for decades.
Certainly I can see that there are a num
ber of good sequences in Terms of Endear
ment — like one in which Aurora and Emma

lie on Aurora's bed and giggle about her
rediscovering sex, and the scene in the su
permarket parking lot between Emma and
Sam, whom she has just met, and the way
Shirley MacLaine demands that a nurse at
tend to her daughter, who is in pain. Ihe
latter moment comes as a surprise, because
though MacLaine's timing is just about per
fect in this movie, she doesn't have a great
deal of depth, and (perhaps in part because
of the unflattering way Brooks and his
cameraman, Andrzej Bartkowiak, have shot
her), she appears somewhat hard and sharp
and unsympathetic for most of it.
Brooks says that he relied on MacLaine's
gifts as a comedienne during the filming,
that she understood that the picture was a
comedy. But her "understanding" of what
Brooks claims to have been his intention
jars with the movie he ended up making —
the movie he must have been making all
along, because why would anyone without
a strong measure of soap in his sensibility
want to film a novel like Terms of Endear
ment? Shirley MacLaine's mistake may have
been that she believed her director.
Brooks is going to make a pile of money
on this picture, and probably receive a
couple of Oscar nominations as well, so I
think it only fair to point out that he's not a
director yet. (Originally a television writer
— an unusually sensitive one who has been
associated with The Mary Tyler Moore Show
and Taxi — he scripted Starting Over four
years ago; this is his directorial debut.) Vis
ually, Terms of Endearment is unattractively
slick, with unexplained bleached-out seg
ments, the framing is sloppy, and there is
an excessive reliance on close-ups, many of
which are mistimed and fail to provide the
emotional clinch Brooks wants them for.
One potentially funny scene in which
Aurora and Garrett wrestle in the water is
almost indecipherable, and the drops of
water on the camera lens upstage the
performers. Furthermore, in scene after
scene Brooks makes his actors look need
lessly ugly — especially Shirley MacLaine
and Lisa Hart Carroll, who plays the im
penetrable role of Emma's best friend,
Patsy. When Brooks presents Patsy, who
has become a member of the New York
elite by the last section of the movie, in a
short blond haircut that makes her long,
sucked-in face look like a consumptive
alien's, he may be trying for satire. But what
can he be thinking of when he shoots
MacLaine in bed with Jack Nicholson so
that her teeth are her only clearlv visible
feature? Aesthetically, this movie is an au
thentic weeper.
