Richard Pryor Live in Con
cert (1979)
Cubberley Auditorium
Richard Pryor's first concert
picture is an undiluted joy —
and if it isn't the funniest
movie ever made, it certainly
must be in the tog five (even
though it is only peripherally a
movie, Bill Sargent's direction
being merely serviceable).
When Pryor personifies his
own heart attack, you know
you're watching one of the
greatest actors who ever
stepped in tront of a camera.
Plays Friday evening.
It's a Wonderful Life (1946)
Kresge Auditorium
James Stewart plays a small
town joe who has spent years
putting other people's inter
ests before his own; when his
life begins to fall apart and he
contemplates suicide, an angel
(Henry Travers) shows him
what life would have been like
tor those closest to him had he
never existed. This comedy
drama is the most eloquent ex
pression of the populist
philosophy with which Frank
Capra infused his films. It's su
perbly crafted, and two or
three scenes are too powerful
to shake off — Capra could be
an amazing director, and he
knew exactly what he was
doing here. But his vision is so
fraudulent that your tears may
freeze into outrage when you
consider the effect of the
movie. Much of the film's suc
cess as a piece of manipulation
is due to Stewart, whose ear
nestness has never been af
fecting iiY quite this way
before; his intensity is
frightening — in the scene in
which he cries out to his girl.
Donna Reed (who is very
good), that he feels trapped in
the town, you can really see
the potential for nervous col
lapse and suicide. The sup
porting cast includes the
unconvincing Lionel Bar
rymore, Thomas Mitchell,
Beuiah Bondi, Frank Faylen,
Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame,
H.B.Warner and Frank Al
bertson. Capra worked on the
script with Frances Goodrich
and Albert Hackett. and Joseph
Walker and Joseph Biroc col
laborated on the (fine)
cinematography.
Plays Friday evening.
The Wizard of Oz (1939)
Memorial Auditorium
Victor Fleming and a trio of
writers (Noel Langley, Florence
Ryerson, Edgar Allen Woolf)
turned L. Frank Baum's
beloved children's story into
one of Hollywood's few great
musical fantasies. It triumphs
p'f-cisely because it is such a
squarely American movie — its
heart lies in ' the
vaudeville/Broadway revue

roots of two of its stars, Bert
Lahr (The Cowardly Lion) and
incomparable comic dan
ced Ray Bolger v (The
Scarecrow), judv Garland,
then a pudgy, earnest teen
ager, sings the Harold Arlen-
E.Y. Harburg songs so sweetly
that the most obstinate hearts
crack and melt. Everyone can
recite the cast by heart: Jack
Haley as The Tin Man, Billie
Burke as Glinda the Good
Witch of the North, Clara Blan
dick and Charley Grapewin as
Auntie Em and Uncle Henry,
and — memorably — Frank
Morgan as The Wizard and
Margaret Hamilton as The
Wicked Witch of the West-.
Bobby Connelly staged the
numbers, Harold Rosson
photographed, and Cedric
Gibbons and William A. Hor
ning supervised the art direc
tion.
Plays Sunday evening.
Pixote (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Hector Babenco's powerful
movie about a 10-year-old slum
child from Sao Paulo is sour
and hard-edged. It presents
children as innocents in hell —
baby-faced nomads wearing
grown-up clothes, trying to
play by grown-up rules, cling
ing to each other or to
whatever adults they feel can
give them direction, like the al
coholic whore Sueli (Marilia
Pera, in a wild, brilliant perfor
mance), who is more adoles
cent and less capable of coping
than they are. Babenco grinds
a heavy political axe: By law
minors are immune from
prison sentences in Brazil, but
resentful police officials who
are under the gun (of
politicians who want to be re
elected) to appear effective in
controlling city crime round up
street gangs as a matter of
course when a murder is com
mitted. The kids are beaten
and thrown into detention
centers that are as horrible as
prisons; when some die, the
blame is officially laid on other
kids so that the muckraking
press can be led away from the
truth. There's something of the
yellow jouranlist in Babenco,
but if his methods are occa
sionally suspett, his motives
are not. He and Jorge Duran
wrote the screenplay. With Fer
nando Ramas as Pixote and
Jorge Juliano, in an impas
sioned, flamboyant perfor
mance as the homosexual
Lilica.

Plays Monday with Angelo
My Love.

Chinatown (1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A startling example of how a
director with a one-track mind
can pervert a first-rate script. If
Robert Towne's private eye
thriller, set in the L.A. of the

late Depression, had been
filmed by, say, John Huston
(who plays a major role in it), it
might have been one of the
most satisfying gumshoe
pictures ever made; .but
Roman Polanski, who is
obsessed with the mire of cor
ruption, added such grisly
delights as a hit man (Polanski
himself) who cuts a slice out of
hero jack Nicholson's nose
and altered Towne's original
ending (which was upbeat). it's
still a pretty good movie, but it
makes you teel lousy. Nichol
son gives an intelligent though
too self-effacing performance.
(The material seems to rein in
his usual buoyancy.) Playing

opposite him, Faye Dunaway
gives an amusingly arch series
of impersonations of various
women who enticed Bogart in
his Dashiell Hammett-
Raym'ond Chandler years —
but it's not really acting.
Plays Tuesday with Body
Heat.

Rebecca (1940) ;
Festival, Palo Alto
The Academy Award for Best
Picture went to this enthralling
high-style Gothic, which was
Altred Hitchcock's first Ameri-

can movie. The story — about
a bride who returns to her hus
band's manor to find that the
spirit of his first wife hovers
over everything — is out of
Daphne Du Maurier, adapted
by Robert E. Sherwood and
Joan Harrison. Laurence
Olivier plays the haunted
widower, Maxim de Winter;
she throws too many soulful
glances, and his performance
doesn't make a great deal of
sense, but he's marvelous to
watch anyway, joan Fontaine is
surprisingly good as his put
upon second wife. The vibrant
supporting cast includes
George Sanders, Gladys
Cooper, Reginald Denny,
Nigel Bruce, Florence Bates, C.

Aubrey Smith, MelviNe
Cooper, Leo C. Carroll and
Judith Anderson in a classically
preposterous, scene-stealing
turn as creepy Mrs. Danvers,
de Winter's housekeeper. /
Plays tomorrow, through
next Wednesday witn Gaslight.
Gaslight (1944)
Festival, Palo Alto V
v lngrid Bergman was St her
most beautiful in the mid
19405, and it was a satistyingly
earthbound beauty: She never
seemed inaccessible, like
Hedy Lamarr in the '30s or
Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.
She did her best acting in this
period, too, an$j when she
played the tormented wife in
this film of the old Patrick
(Hamilton chestnut Angel
Street, she was rewarded with
an Oscar. Thanks to Bergman,
to Charles Boyer as the hus
band who is determined to
drive her mad, to an unusually
\ skillful supporting cast (joseph
Gotten, Angela Lansbury,
Dame May Whitty), and to
George Cukor's crackerjack di
rection, this is a highly enter
taining "civilized" thriller.
John Van Oruten, Walter
Reisch and John Balderston
adapted the play.
Plays tomorrow through
next Wednesday with RebecCa.
Oliver! (1968)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A great movie musical. In
adapting .the hit Lionel Bart
show, screenwriter Vernon
Haris wisely returned to Dick
ens; the dialogue is right out
of Oliver Twist. And the direc
tor, Carol Reed, somehow
managed to capture both the
Dickensian spirit'and the es
sence of musical comedy;
when you think of how many
wrong turns the movie could
have made, the results seem
miraculous. (Just compare it to
most of the big-budget musi
cals Hollywood was putting
out in the same era.) The mag
nificent cast teatures Ron
Moody as Fagin, Oliver Reed"
as Bill Sikes, Shani Waflis as
Nancy, Harry Secombe as Mr.
Bumble, Mark Lester as Oliver,
and Jack Wild as the Artful
Dodger; Onna White did the
spectacular choreography and
John Box the lovely designs.
This deserving popular suc
cess, probably Carol Reed's
best movie after The Third
Man, was also his last blaze of
glory; though he lived until
1976, he never again rose to
such heights.
Plays Sunday with Scrooge.
