# CoCE proposes concert committee

### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The Committee on Contemporary Entertain
ment (CoCE) last week voted to support a pro
posal that calls for a new student group to spon
sor concerts on campus.
The new group would hold most of the con
certs it promotes at Frost Amphitheater,
Memorial Auditorium and Maples Pavilion.
Other University groups that want to hold con
certs at the sites would have to get permission
from the CoCE.
The group would be backed by investments
from student organizations. Student organiza
tions would have to invest at least $500 in the
group, and only organizations with assets
greater than $3000 would be eligible to partici
pate.
"It is a novel idea," said Margaret Ann Fidler,
assistant dean of students for administration

and co-chair of CoCE. "Time will tell how it
works."
A report describing the proposal will be sent
Friday to Dean of Students James Lyons for ap
proval.
Lyons said he is in favor of having one student
group promote large campus concerts.
"When it comes to big concerts, I favor
having the narrowest possible group do it so
that we need not re-invent the wheel every time
a concert is put on," he said.
In August University President Donald Ken
nedy ordered a moratorium on campus con
certs, citing security problems and administra
tive burdens.
Since ASSU Special Services, a group that or
ganized and sponsored concerts, lost $92,000 in
the 1979-1980 academic year, student groups,
University agencies and professional promoters
have been working to produce concerts. The

Campus Entertainment Board folded soon after
organization, and CoCE and the Concert Net
work have sponsored few concerts.
CoCE has been working since September to
develop a system to sponsor contemporary en
tertainment concerts.
The proposal the committee recommended
came from Vinnie Freda, a member of CoCE and
the Council of Presidents. Freda said he was
"elated" the committee approved his proposal.
The new group would have two governing
boards: one to set policy and another to imple
ment it.
The policy board would consist of the direc
tors of Tresidder Union and the Office of Stu
dent Activities, several students and the new
group's leading officers.
The implementation board would include the
