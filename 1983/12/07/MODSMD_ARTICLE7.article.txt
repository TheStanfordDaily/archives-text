# CoCE proposes concert committee
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The Committee on Contemporary Entertain
ment (CoCE) last week voted to support a pro
posal that calls for a new student group to spon
sor concerts on campus.
The new group would hold most of the con
certs it promotes at Frost Amphitheater,
Memorial Auditorium and Maples Pavilion.
Other University groups that want to hold con
certs at the sites would have to get permission
from the CoCE.
The group would be backed by investments
from student organizations. Student organiza
tions would have to invest at least $500 in the
group, and only organizations with assets
greater than $3000 would be eligible to partici
pate.
"It is a novel idea," said Margaret Ann Fidler,
assistant dean of students for administration

and co-chair of CoCE. "Time will tell how it
works."
A report describing the proposal will be sent
Friday to Dean of Students James Lyons for ap
proval.
Lyons said he is in favor of having one student
group promote large campus concerts.
"When it comes to big concerts, I favor
having the narrowest possible group do it so
that we need not re-invent the wheel every time
a concert is put on," he said.
In August University President Donald Ken
nedy ordered a moratorium on campus con
certs, citing security problems and administra
tive burdens.
Since ASSU Special Services, a group that or
ganized and sponsored concerts, lost $92,000 in
the 1979-1980 academic year, student groups,
University agencies and professional promoters
have been working to produce concerts. The

Campus Entertainment Board folded soon after
organization, and CoCE and the Concert Net
work have sponsored few concerts.
CoCE has been working since September to
develop a system to sponsor contemporary en
tertainment concerts.
The proposal the committee recommended
came from Vinnie Freda, a member of CoCE and
the Council of Presidents. Freda said he was
"elated" the committee approved his proposal.
The new group would have two governing
boards: one to set policy and another to imple
ment it.
The policy board would consist of the direc
tors of Tresidder Union and the Office of Stu
dent Activities, several students and the new
group's leading officers.
The implementation board would include the
group's student director, concert
adviser and business manager.
The student director would su
pervise the organization and partici
pate in contract negotiations.
Council of Presidents member
Karol Watson, co-chairman of the
committee, said having one student
group handle large concerts would
avoid confusion.
"The new system is significantly
simpler than the old system," Wat
son said. "A lot of staff time was

being used up the in old system. It
was too cumbersome."
The new group would attract
knowledgeable people who know
how to put on a concert, Watson
said, and a concert adviser would be
a reliable source of information for
promoters.
"There needs to be one person
someone can go to for informa
tion," she said. "Stanford needs to
get a reputation for continuity
before people are really going to re
ly on us."
Freda said the new group would
apply for a one-time fee assessment
in spring so it could get started in

the 1984-1985 academic year.
But the group's investors would
provide long-term financial stability,
Freda said.
"The corporate structure would
provide safety and security like in
surance," he said. "Relying on tee
assessments and concert profits are
very risky propositions.
"The key to a successful concert
program is continuity. You are not
going to have a concert program if it
is based on fee assessments and
concert profits."
Lyons said students must be more
realistic about large campus con
certs.

"lo the uninitiated the concert
business seems a good deal
monitarily," he said. "The facts
belie that. The costs of producing
popular entertainment are very
high."
Ronald Fernandez, art director of
the Chaparral, which produced
Grateful Dead concerts last year and
has been mentioned as a possible
investor for the new group, said he
supports the proposal.
The group probably would be
financially stable because it would
be backed by investors, Fernandez
said.

Karol Watson, co-chairman of the
committee, said having one student
group handle large concerts would
avoid confusion.
"The new system is significantly
simpler than the old system," Wat
son said. "A lot of staff time was

being used up the in old system. It
was too cumbersome."
The new group would attract
knowledgeable people who know
how to put on a concert, Watson
said, and a concert adviser would be
a reliable source of information for
promoters.
"There needs to be one person
someone can go to for informa
tion," she said. "Stanford needs to
get a reputation for continuity
before people are really going to re
ly on us."
Freda said the new group would
apply for a one-time fee assessment
in spring so it could get started in

the 1984-1985 academic year.
But the group's investors would
provide long-term financial stability,
Freda said.
"The corporate structure would
provide safety and security like in
surance," he said. "Relying on tee
assessments and concert profits are
very risky propositions.
"The key to a successful concert
program is continuity. You are not
going to have a concert program if it
is based on fee assessments and
concert profits."
Lyons said students must be more
realistic about large campus con
certs.

"lo the uninitiated the concert
business seems a good deal
monitarily," he said. "The facts
belie that. The costs of producing
popular entertainment are very
high."
Ronald Fernandez, art director of
the Chaparral, which produced
Grateful Dead concerts last year and
has been mentioned as a possible
investor for the new group, said he
supports the proposal.
The group probably would be
financially stable because it would
be backed by investors, Fernandez
said.
