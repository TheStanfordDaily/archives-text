## Shopping center plans addition of new stores 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
The Stanford Shopping Center is changing,
with Bullock's on the way out and Nordstrom's
and Neiman-Marcus on the way in, according
to the manager of campus properties.
The most immediate change is the closure of
Bullock's, which will occur next month. By
mid-February, the store will be emptied and
Nordstrom's, a clothing store, will begin an ex
tensive interior remodeling project, expected
to last six to nine months. Current plans call for
the opening of the Nordstrom's store in Octo
ber 1984.
Nordstrom's has purchased a number of Bul
lock's stores in Northern California recently, as
the Northwestern chain moves south.
"The change is good for all concerned," said
Rosemary McAndrews, manager of campus
properties. "We wanted to have a Nordstrom's
in the mall, but we had no place to put them.
They also wanted to have a store here, so when
the opportunity arose, the Bullock's here was
the first that Nordstrom's purchased."
The addition of the Neiman-Marcus store is
the final phase of the mall's expansion. Con
struction of the new store will begin in July,
with the store ready for customers in the fall of
1985. With the new building in place, the
original plans for the shopping center will be
completed.

The changes in the center are carefully cho
sen, and Stanford students play a large role in
the planning process. "Students coming by
bike from campus are a large part of our con
sumer numbers," McAndrews said.
"We are very particular about our tenant mix
in the shopping center; we try to merchandize
with a broad appeal to our immediate trade
area of the surrounding five miles,"
McAndrews said. "Much of our business comes
from the campus residents, hence we pay
close attention to their interests when filling
our vacancies."
The average annual turnover at the mall is
eight to 10 stores out of the 125 stores in the
mall, and many of the additions recently have
been directed at students. Some of the stores
most popular with students are The Limited,
The Cap and McDonald's. Also popular is
Banana Republic, added in midsummer, which
typifies the stores designed to attract students,
McAndrews said.
Smaller shops will continue to be added as
space opens up, but the stores filling these
spots are determined individually, and
McAndrews said no particular shops are ex
pected.
"For the larger stores we must plan ahead,"
she said. "But for the smaller shops we review
applications only after a vacancy is an
ticipated."
