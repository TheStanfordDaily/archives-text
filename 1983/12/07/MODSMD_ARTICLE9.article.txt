## Mondale attacks Reagan policies 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
San Jose — Walter Mondale, on his first
major campaign swing through Califor
nia, said in a stock speech at a fund
raising luncheon here Friday that America
must be made competitive and compas
sionate again.
Mondale, the former vice president
who is the front-runner in the race for the
Democratic presidential nomination,
never mentioned his competitors as he
directed his criticism at the economic, so
cial and foreign policies of the Reagan ad
ministration.
Assailing Reaganomics as the cause of
this year's $200 billion budget deficit,
Mondale said, "It's just not possible (for
the nation) to move confidently into the

future with these kinds of policies."
Mondale called for new economic and
trade policies that would reduce the defi
cit and bring back to the United States "a
competitive edge."
"This is the worst trade year in Ameri
can history," Mondale said, pointing out
that the nation is importing more than it is
exporting to a greater degree than ever
before.
Emphasizing what he believes is the
necessity of balanced imports to exports,
Mondale said, "We need to make certain
that we're competing in the world on
what's called a level table."
Mondale said education would be a key
to renewing the nation's competitive

ness, saying, "We are coming into an era
of knowledge and information that is
revolutionary in character."
Mondale said his election would be a
return to leadership that makes this "a
fairer nation again." He cited Social Se
curity, civil rights and the Equal Rights
Amendment as issues on which he would
make progress to "lighten the burden
upon decent Americans."
Directing his sharpest criticism toward
Reagan's foreign policy, Mondale
charged that more than 1000 days into the
Reagan administration, there has been
"not one single foreign policy advance."
With regard to the U.S. relationship with
the Soviet Union, he said, "I don't know
how you define a Cold War but it looks
pretty chilly to me."
