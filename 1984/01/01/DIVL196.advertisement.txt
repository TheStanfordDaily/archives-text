Do you have something to say, but
nobody to say it to? Then work for The
Daily this summer. We need reporters,
photographers, editors and columnists to
help keep more than 10,000 readers well
informed. Strut on into our offices in the
Storke Publications Building (across from
Terman Engineering Center), and we'll
make your summer complete.
