"gelato"
(The Italian Word For Ice Cream)
True, some ice cream parlors have been serving an
"Italian Style" ice cream for years—usually marked as
Spumoni. There have also been some scattered attempts
at producing Italian "ices" and the like. But it was
actually Gelato Classico that first introduced the word
"gelato," or what some people are calling "San Francisco
Style Italian Ice Cream," to the American market—
an ice cream that has since become famous for
its ultra-dense consistency, almost taffy like texture,
and intense, vivid flavors. Experience Gelato.
Anything else is just ice cream.
