Raft the spectacular rapids
of California's Sierra rivers
Run rapids with the evocative names of Troublemaker,
Meatgrinder and Triple Threat on the American; crash
down the Tuolumne; float the Truckee or the Carson in
Nevada (alas, the damn builders have drowned the
Stanislaus). These and other Sierra rivers await the
adventurous who feel that "gusto' is more than a can of
beer. Rent a raft capable of carrying six to nine, complete
with paddles, life vests, bailers and life lines, for only $100
per day (*see, eight of you can do it for only $12.50 each).
