# Ghosts of another era
## A
						look at San Francisco's more radical years 
### LISA LYNCH 
Some people think strange
things about California.
They come to San Francisco
expecting to see Allen
Ginsberg chanting koans, Jack
Kerouac hitting the road again,
and just about anyone tripping
along Haight Street with their
eyes pasted skyward.
1 he latter probably isn't
impossible to find. But the 112 irst
two are ghosts; remnants of
what San Francisco was, yet, to
many, still a big part of what
the City is. If you've come to
the Bay Area expecting to find
the 1950s and '(i()s, you might
not find exactly what you came
for, but there are still some
ghosts around. Here are a few
favorite haunts:
The Beat Generation
The majority of the Beats
landed in San Francisco fresh
from the conscientious objec

tor camps scattered around the
West Coast during World War
11. No one is sure how the Beat
generation got its name; per
haps it was because they were
marching to the Beat of a
decidedly different drummer.
At any rate, the era started in
the 1940s with the networking
of Ginsberg, Kerouac and
William Burroughs and ended
in the mid-1960s with the
popularization of acid. During
their two-decade heyday, the
Beats left the following monu
ments to Beatdom:
1 he City Lights Bookstore
— Where it all began, sort of.
City Lights has illuminated the
San Francisco literary scene
since the early '50s. It was the
brainchild of Lawrence Ferlin
ghetti, who came to the City
looking for cheap wine and
found a dearth of good
bookstores. He still tends the

store, and it has kept virtually
ilie same atmosphere despite
i he turbulent generations fol
lowing its creation.
In addition to running a
bookstore, Ferlinghetti writes
and aiso publishes the work of
other poets. Visit the shop at
261 Columbus Avenue, Mon
day through Thursday from
10 a.m to midnight, Saturday
112 rom 10a.m.-l a.m. Don't go in
looking for a job there, though.
Everyone does.
Purple Onion — Another
survivor of the Beat era, the
Onion is the club that started
the Smothers Brothers, Rod
McKuen, Jim Nabors, and the
Kingston Trio.
Caffe Trieste — Cof
feehouse then and coffehouse
now. 601 Vallejo at Grant.
29 Russell Street — an al
leyway off Hyde Street, be
tween Union and Grant

Streets. Jack Kerouac stayed
here with Neal and Carolyn
Cassady, writing "On The
Road" in the attic. According
to Kerouac, "It rained every
day and I had wine, marijuana,
and once in a while Neal's wife
would sneak in."
Wentley Apartments —
Where Ginsberg wrote "Howl"
in the fall of 1955. 1214 Polk
Street.
The Hippie Generation
Or the '60s, or whatever. A
lot happened between the mid
60s and mid-70s, and it seems
that most of it happened right
around here. Acid, the Dead,
activism, and a lot of tie-dye
are still around, and so are
some of these:
Psalms Cafe — Masonic and
Haight Streets. Once known as
the Drugstore Cafe, it's the
Trieste of the Flower People.
The Dead House — 710

Ashbury Street. Make a
pilgrimage. The Dead are still
around, but they aren't the
same beatific icons that held
court on Haight Street, living
here until the late '60s.
Airplane House — 2400 Ful
ton Street. A black and gold
mansion that most of the Jef
ferson Airplane/Starship has
lived in at one time or another,
along with a lot of interesting
folk. The Starship still has
offices there, but the orgies
ended in the '70s.
Fillmore Auditorium — A
lot of people think strange
things about California because
of places like the Fillmore. Bill
Graham held concerts and
dance concerts in the Fillmore
and Fillmore West in the late
'60s and early '70s. Haunted by
the ghosts of Santana,
Creedence Clearwater Revival,
Steppenwolf and the like.
