# Bicycling, boating and beaches 'round the Bay
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
True, California sum
mertime weather goes quite
well with a tall glass of iced tea,
a good book and a hammock.
But the Great Outdoors is
good for more than a great tan
— be sure to save some time on
your calendar to get off the
Farm and into a pair of roller
skates, an inner tube, a sailboat
or scuba gear — and maybe get
into shape.
Instead of walking the
streets of San Francisco, why
not rollerskate? There are
rental places in Golden Gate
Park where you can get a
prime pair of skates for about
$5 a day. Buffalo Skaters,
which was the first to rent
skates to parkgoers, works out
of a truck on the north side of
the park at Bth and Fulton. It is
open every weekend from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m., and sporadically
during the week, and can be
reached by calling 441-5698.
Skates on Haight is open all
week, and rents from 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m. You can find it at
1818 Haight Street or call 752-
8375.
Aji Cyclery, on the south side
of the park near the Hall of
Flowers, is also open all week
long. Call 665-1394 for more
information. Aji rents bikes as
well as skates: three-, live- and
10-speeds and tandems.
Bicycles generally cost $ 1.50-
$2 per hour, depending on the
speed and make. Be sure to
bring an I.D. and deposit
money. Avenue Cyclery, on the
east side of the park, has three-,
five- and 10-speeds and is open
Tuesday through Sunday
(phone 387-3155). The Bike

Shop, on the south side of the
park on Lincoln Way, only has
three-speeds; their number is
665-3092.
Boats (the sailing kind) can
be rented in Redwood City,
Alameda and Berkeley. Spin
naker Sailing in Redwood City
rents boats and gives sailing
lessons; rates are $20 an hour
for private sailing lessons at the
beginning, intermediate, ad
vanced, challenge, spinnaker
and big boat levels. Boats can
also be rented for outings and
parties; if you can sail the boat
yourself, a 10-person yacht
would cost about $160 a day,
otherwise there's a $35 per
hour skippering charge. Spin
naker also gives windsurfing
lessons in a six-hour package
for $20 per hour.
Olympic Sailing School of
Berkeley, which bills itself as
the largest sailing school in the
area, charges $20 per hour for
private lessons but specializes
in group lessons. A popular
plan is to spend an entire
weekend sailing (12 hours of
lessons) with a group. The
package includes lunches, les
sons and equipment and costs
$120. Boat rentals run from
$70-$245 per day depending
on boat size (the largest being
40-foot) and skippering costs
$20 per hour.
For those who prefer to be in
rather than on the water,
there's always the beach. The
Pacific Ocean is less than an
hour away from Stanford. Half
Moon Bay, with its beautiful
beaches and cliffs, can be
reached by driving on Inter
state 280 to San Mateo and then

Highway 92 west. For a more
scenic route, and one that can
be traveled by bike or moped,
take Sand Hill Road over
Interstate 280 and beyond, pass
Whiskey Hill Road, and turn
right over Sand Hill onto Por
tola Road. Turn left from Por
tola onto La Honda Road,
which winds through some
breathtaking redwood forests
up to Skyline Boulevard. Con
tinue on La Honda down to the
coast at San Gregorio Beach,
which has great caves and a
concession stand, but closes at

dusk. Beaches with
campgrounds are farther
down the road.
The water at San Gregorio is
cold (actually freezing). The
water south of Santa Cruz
won't give you hypothermia,
but there are strong undercur
rents and only the hardy
should venture a swim.
The beaches outside of San
Francisco are predictably
windy, but pretty — the Point
Reyes National Seashore, on the
other side of the Golden Gate
Bridge, has miles of hiking

areas.
If you find bodies beautiful
and tan lines disgusting, there
are several nude beaches in the
Bay Area. Edun Cove Beach,
probably the most beautiful of
them all, is located on private
land outside of San Francisco.
To get there, follow Highway 1
past Rockaway Beach, past the
point where the highway turns
into a two-lane road, and three
miles past an A&rW stand.
You'll see an American flag
and a sign that says "Beach


One of the beautiful beaches at Half Moon Bay, less than an hour's drive away.
