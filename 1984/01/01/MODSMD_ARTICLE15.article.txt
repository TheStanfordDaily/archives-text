## There's more to movies than pictures and popcorn 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
During the school year,
seven or eight film series may
be in operation at the same
time, but most summers only
the ASSU Sunday Flicks —
dealing exclusively in recent
theatrical releases (and usually
box office hits) — and perhaps
the S'l ARTS Great Director
Series (which last summer in
cluded Bunuel and Eisenstein
classics) continue to screen
films. However, the Peninsula
boasts a large number and vari
ety of moviehouses, both first
and second-run, that make it
possible not only to go to the
movies every night but also to
skip, if you so desire, that long
trek to the city. In Palo Alto,
Menlo Park and Mountain
View alone t lie re are nine
theaters (15 screens), including
three revival cinemas, and
within a 15- or 20-minute dis
tance — in Redwood City, San
Mateo and Belmont — newly
arrived movie addicts will find
their needs liberally tended to:
New Varsity — located on
University Avenue between
Waverly and Cow per Streets,
the New Varsity is a nearly
ideal repertory cinema. Double
bills (and occasionally triple
bills) change every day or two,
and they offer not only recent
films (often hot off the first
run screens) but also American
and foreign classics, some not
often revived. If a relatively
unpublici/ed movie opens in
San Francisco and tails to show
up first-run in Palo Alto,
chances are it will surface at the
New Varsity within 6 or 8
months. The seats are slightly
rickety and uncomfortable, but
the Varsity's patrons don't
.seem to mind very much. The
building also houses an indoor
outdoor cafe-restaurant where
locals often gather in the eve
ning for coffee, dessert and
live music in the courtyard.
Warning: On Friday nights the
Varsity is a hangout for
teenagers — a responsive but
perhaps overly vocal audience
for the movies tlie manage

ment has lately (in the past
year) provided to cater to high
school audiences.
Festival — Just behind the
Varsity, on Hamilton Avenue
just west of Cowper Street, is
the Festival 7 heatre, which
shows one double bill a week.
(The movies change on
Thursday.) It's much smaller
than the Varsity — intimate —
but very co/.y, with overstuffed
seats and enormous pillows on
the floor just in front of the
screen. Almost all the features
are Hollywood movies from
the 1930s and 40s (there's a
British double bill every six
weeks or so), which are a treat
to see again on a big screen
even il you've already caught
them on TV. The latest
schedule does include On Golden
Pond, which represents an un
fortunate departure from their
usual programming policy.
Aquarius — The Aquarius,
on Emerson between Univer
sity and Lytton, has two small
cinemas that show mostly
foreign films, with the oc
casional "small" American
feature like Chilly Scenes of Win
ter or Angelo, My Love. Since it is
one of Palo Alto's major claims
to culture, it is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Satur
day nights; the Palo Alto
moviegoing crowd tends to
adopt certain movies that open
at the Aquarius — El Norte or
Carmen - and keep them
playing there for months. It's
your basic (essential) university
theater, and though its films
are (of course) of highly
variable quality, the manage
ment has never compromised
its decision to show only ar
thouse selections.
Bijou — For years the
Aquarius Cinemas owned the
Bijou — a small cinema just
down the street, on Emerson
between Hamilton and Forest
— but last December new
owners converted it into a
revival house dedicated (we
were repeatedly told) to
showing unusual movies,
domestic and foreign, that

don't often appear on local
screens. And the first schedule
contained dozens of such films
— it was a movie buff's
paradise, until the manage
ment decided it couldn't make
money that way. Each subse
quent schedule has been less
interesting than the last, and at
the moment, except for the
weekly foreign film evening,
it's a poor man's New Varsity
— and once a week or so it
turns into a nightclub, giving
over its space to a stand-up
comic. (It's a schizophrenic
moviehouse.) But no matter
who or what is playing on any
night at the Bijou, you can be
sure you'll hear the owner, Bob
Stern, make his opening
speech to the audience.
Fine Arts — On California
Avenue, just cast of El Camino
— in the midst of the nicest
commercial area in Palo Alto.
The Fine Arts is a fairly nice
theater, known in the past for
grabbing hold of movies it
could show for months and
months — lrKe An Officer and a
Gentleman or Gandhi. Lately the
turnover has been more rapid.
The management of the
theater, it should be noted, is
not especially nice; chances are
that someone will snap at you
on your way in.
Palo Alto Square — These
twin theaters take up the bot
tom floor of a very bland
looking office building at the
corner of El Camino and Page
Mill Road. They draw mostly
high school kids, because they
tend to show boffo films like
Footloose and Indiana Jones and
the Temple of Doom. But they are
undeniably comfortable and
convenient (if you have a car).
Guild, Park — Th ese are
Menlo Park's two movie
theaters. (There used to be a
third, the Menlo, but it closed a
couple of years ago and its
space was absorbed by an ex
panding Chinese restaurant.)
I hey are located a couple of
blocks from each other on El
Camino. Each offers first-run
movies of all kinds, including

"art house" films like This Is
Spinal Tap. They are pleasant
theaters, and pretty reliable
with regard to programming
— generally speaking, at least
one of them is offering a film
worth seeing at any given time.
Old Mill 6 — The bane of a
moviegoer's existence — you
can't avoid seeing films here,
because since there are six
screens, two or three new
pictures arrive every week.
Besides, the bargain-price
twilight shows are very
seductive. (A few months ago
the cinemas cancelled their
other attractive deal: All
showings on Tuesday nights
were featured at 99 cents.
Tuesday night reduced prices
are now subject to the whims of
the management.) But the
screens are tiny, the theater is
always crowded, and you move
from line to line until you feel
you're being processed. Fur
thermore, it's an offensively
ugly environment in which to
see movies — the theater looks
vaguely like a video arcade.
But if you must, you must. Lo
cated in the Old Mill Shopping
Mall on San Antonio Road,
near the San Antonio Shop
ping Center. (The easiest way
to get to it is via Alma; if you
take the San Antonio turnoff,
you'll find immediate signs for
the Old Mill.)
U.A. Redwood 6 — Another
six-screen theater, the U.A. is
located in one of the most un
attractive areas in Redwood
City (which is saying a lot), and
the theater is even more
claustrophic than the Old Mill.
But it's not as popular (I've
never been turned away) and
all matinees (except Sundays
and holidays) are offered at
bargain prices.
Mann 6 — Fashion Island
Shopping Mall, located in San
Mateo just off Route 92
(heading toward the San Mateo
Bridge — watch for the turnoff
to the right, or you'll end up in
Hayward), is amazing. The

shopping center is enormous,
and you drive around it for
what seems like hours before
you can park outside the Mann
6 theaters. Inside sits every
junk food shop you've ever
craved (or avoided) — usually
semi-vacant. Before slipping in
to see a movie at one of the six
small screens, you can sit and
lick your Haagen-Dazs
chocolate-chocolate chip cone
or bite into your corn dog
while watching kids ice skate
on the rink that separates the
fast food stands from the
movies. Fashion Island is also
big on bargain matinees, and if
you pick an unconventional
time to go (like 5:00 in the af
ternoon) you can see even a
blockbuster like Indiana Jones
without a wait. Besides, it's a
pop cultural experience you
won't want to miss.
Belmont — Sometimes a
movie you want to see disap
pears from every other theater
within a 20-minute drive ex
cept for the Belmont, and so if
you're persistent you hunt
down this suburban house
(located north of Ralston Ave
nue on El Camino — there's a
Ralston Ave. exit on both 101
and 280), where there's never a
line and tickets are $2 a head
even on Saturday nights. A
charmingly rundown theater.
Any local paper will tell you
what's playing at each of the
above theaters except those
north of Menlo Park — you'll
need a Chronicle or an Ex
aminer for that information.
The bills usually change on
Fridays (except for the revival
cinemas, of course). The best
overall guide to the movies is
the Aits and Entertainment
section of the Sunday Ex
aminer 8c Chronicle, affec
tionately known as the "pink
section." A number of local
theaters advertise in The Daily,
as do the on-campus film se
ries. A selective list of movies
(mostly revivals) appears in the
"Cinemascope" section of The
Daily every Friday.

Thursday.) It's much smaller
than the Varsity — intimate —
but very co/.y, with overstuffed
seats and enormous pillows on
the floor just in front of the
screen. Almost all the features
are Hollywood movies from
the 1930s and 40s (there's a
British double bill every six
weeks or so), which are a treat
to see again on a big screen
even il you've already caught
them on TV. The latest
schedule does include On Golden
Pond, which represents an un
fortunate departure from their
usual programming policy.
Aquarius — The Aquarius,
on Emerson between Univer
sity and Lytton, has two small
cinemas that show mostly
foreign films, with the oc
casional "small" American
feature like Chilly Scenes of Win
ter or Angelo, My Love. Since it is
one of Palo Alto's major claims
to culture, it is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Satur
day nights; the Palo Alto
moviegoing crowd tends to
adopt certain movies that open
at the Aquarius — El Norte or
Carmen - and keep them
playing there for months. It's
your basic (essential) university
theater, and though its films
are (of course) of highly
variable quality, the manage
ment has never compromised
its decision to show only ar
thouse selections.
Bijou — For years the
Aquarius Cinemas owned the
Bijou — a small cinema just
down the street, on Emerson
between Hamilton and Forest
— but last December new
owners converted it into a
revival house dedicated (we
were repeatedly told) to
showing unusual movies,
domestic and foreign, that

don't often appear on local
screens. And the first schedule
contained dozens of such films
— it was a movie buff's
paradise, until the manage
ment decided it couldn't make
money that way. Each subse
quent schedule has been less
interesting than the last, and at
the moment, except for the
weekly foreign film evening,
it's a poor man's New Varsity
— and once a week or so it
turns into a nightclub, giving
over its space to a stand-up
comic. (It's a schizophrenic
moviehouse.) But no matter
who or what is playing on any
night at the Bijou, you can be
sure you'll hear the owner, Bob
Stern, make his opening
speech to the audience.
Fine Arts — On California
Avenue, just cast of El Camino
— in the midst of the nicest
commercial area in Palo Alto.
The Fine Arts is a fairly nice
theater, known in the past for
grabbing hold of movies it
could show for months and
months — lrKe An Officer and a
Gentleman or Gandhi. Lately the
turnover has been more rapid.
The management of the
theater, it should be noted, is
not especially nice; chances are
that someone will snap at you
on your way in.
Palo Alto Square — These
twin theaters take up the bot
tom floor of a very bland
looking office building at the
corner of El Camino and Page
Mill Road. They draw mostly
high school kids, because they
tend to show boffo films like
Footloose and Indiana Jones and
the Temple of Doom. But they are
undeniably comfortable and
convenient (if you have a car).
Guild, Park — Th ese are
Menlo Park's two movie
theaters. (There used to be a
third, the Menlo, but it closed a
couple of years ago and its
space was absorbed by an ex
panding Chinese restaurant.)
I hey are located a couple of
blocks from each other on El
Camino. Each offers first-run
movies of all kinds, including

"art house" films like This Is
Spinal Tap. They are pleasant
theaters, and pretty reliable
with regard to programming
— generally speaking, at least
one of them is offering a film
worth seeing at any given time.
Old Mill 6 — The bane of a
moviegoer's existence — you
can't avoid seeing films here,
because since there are six
screens, two or three new
pictures arrive every week.
Besides, the bargain-price
twilight shows are very
seductive. (A few months ago
the cinemas cancelled their
other attractive deal: All
showings on Tuesday nights
were featured at 99 cents.
Tuesday night reduced prices
are now subject to the whims of
the management.) But the
screens are tiny, the theater is
always crowded, and you move
from line to line until you feel
you're being processed. Fur
thermore, it's an offensively
ugly environment in which to
see movies — the theater looks
vaguely like a video arcade.
But if you must, you must. Lo
cated in the Old Mill Shopping
Mall on San Antonio Road,
near the San Antonio Shop
ping Center. (The easiest way
to get to it is via Alma; if you
take the San Antonio turnoff,
you'll find immediate signs for
the Old Mill.)
U.A. Redwood 6 — Another
six-screen theater, the U.A. is
located in one of the most un
attractive areas in Redwood
City (which is saying a lot), and
the theater is even more
claustrophic than the Old Mill.
But it's not as popular (I've
never been turned away) and
all matinees (except Sundays
and holidays) are offered at
bargain prices.
Mann 6 — Fashion Island
Shopping Mall, located in San
Mateo just off Route 92
(heading toward the San Mateo
Bridge — watch for the turnoff
to the right, or you'll end up in
Hayward), is amazing. The

shopping center is enormous,
and you drive around it for
what seems like hours before
you can park outside the Mann
6 theaters. Inside sits every
junk food shop you've ever
craved (or avoided) — usually
semi-vacant. Before slipping in
to see a movie at one of the six
small screens, you can sit and
lick your Haagen-Dazs
chocolate-chocolate chip cone
or bite into your corn dog
while watching kids ice skate
on the rink that separates the
fast food stands from the
movies. Fashion Island is also
big on bargain matinees, and if
you pick an unconventional
time to go (like 5:00 in the af
ternoon) you can see even a
blockbuster like Indiana Jones
without a wait. Besides, it's a
pop cultural experience you
won't want to miss.
Belmont — Sometimes a
movie you want to see disap
pears from every other theater
within a 20-minute drive ex
cept for the Belmont, and so if
you're persistent you hunt
down this suburban house
(located north of Ralston Ave
nue on El Camino — there's a
Ralston Ave. exit on both 101
and 280), where there's never a
line and tickets are $2 a head
even on Saturday nights. A
charmingly rundown theater.
Any local paper will tell you
what's playing at each of the
above theaters except those
north of Menlo Park — you'll
need a Chronicle or an Ex
aminer for that information.
The bills usually change on
Fridays (except for the revival
cinemas, of course). The best
overall guide to the movies is
the Aits and Entertainment
section of the Sunday Ex
aminer 8c Chronicle, affec
tionately known as the "pink
section." A number of local
theaters advertise in The Daily,
as do the on-campus film se
ries. A selective list of movies
(mostly revivals) appears in the
"Cinemascope" section of The
Daily every Friday.
During the school year,
seven or eight film series may
be in operation at the same
time, but most summers only
the ASSU Sunday Flicks —
dealing exclusively in recent
theatrical releases (and usually
box office hits) — and perhaps
the S'l ARTS Great Director
Series (which last summer in
cluded Bunuel and Eisenstein
classics) continue to screen
films. However, the Peninsula
boasts a large number and vari
ety of moviehouses, both first
and second-run, that make it
possible not only to go to the
movies every night but also to
skip, if you so desire, that long
trek to the city. In Palo Alto,
Menlo Park and Mountain
View alone t lie re are nine
theaters (15 screens), including
three revival cinemas, and
within a 15- or 20-minute dis
tance — in Redwood City, San
Mateo and Belmont — newly
arrived movie addicts will find
their needs liberally tended to:
New Varsity — located on
University Avenue between
Waverly and Cow per Streets,
the New Varsity is a nearly
ideal repertory cinema. Double
bills (and occasionally triple
bills) change every day or two,
and they offer not only recent
films (often hot off the first
run screens) but also American
and foreign classics, some not
often revived. If a relatively
unpublici/ed movie opens in
San Francisco and tails to show
up first-run in Palo Alto,
chances are it will surface at the
New Varsity within 6 or 8
months. The seats are slightly
rickety and uncomfortable, but
the Varsity's patrons don't
.seem to mind very much. The
building also houses an indoor
outdoor cafe-restaurant where
locals often gather in the eve
ning for coffee, dessert and
live music in the courtyard.
Warning: On Friday nights the
Varsity is a hangout for
teenagers — a responsive but
perhaps overly vocal audience
for the movies tlie manage

ment has lately (in the past
year) provided to cater to high
school audiences.
Festival — Just behind the
Varsity, on Hamilton Avenue
just west of Cowper Street, is
the Festival 7 heatre, which
shows one double bill a week.
(The movies change on
Thursday.) It's much smaller
than the Varsity — intimate —
but very co/.y, with overstuffed
seats and enormous pillows on
the floor just in front of the

night at the Bijou, you can be
sure you'll hear the owner, Bob
Stern, make his opening
speech to the audience.
Fine Arts — On California
Avenue, just cast of El Camino
— in the midst of the nicest
commercial area in Palo Alto.
The Fine Arts is a fairly nice
theater, known in the past for
grabbing hold of movies it
could show for months and
months — lrKe An Officer and a
Gentleman or Gandhi. Lately the
turnover has been more rapid.
The management of the
theater, it should be noted, is
not especially nice; chances are
that someone will snap at you
on your way in.
Palo Alto Square — These
twin theaters take up the bot
tom floor of a very bland
looking office building at the
corner of El Camino and Page
Mill Road. They draw mostly
high school kids, because they
tend to show boffo films like
Footloose and Indiana Jones and
the Temple of Doom. But they are
undeniably comfortable and
convenient (if you have a car).
Guild, Park — Th ese are
Menlo Park's two movie
theaters. (There used to be a
third, the Menlo, but it closed a
couple of years ago and its
space was absorbed by an ex
panding Chinese restaurant.)
I hey are located a couple of
blocks from each other on El
Camino. Each offers first-run
movies of all kinds, including

"art house" films like This Is
Spinal Tap. They are pleasant
theaters, and pretty reliable
with regard to programming
— generally speaking, at least
one of them is offering a film
worth seeing at any given time.
Old Mill 6 — The bane of a
moviegoer's existence — you
can't avoid seeing films here,
because since there are six
screens, two or three new
pictures arrive every week.
Besides, the bargain-price
twilight shows are very
seductive. (A few months ago
the cinemas cancelled their
other attractive deal: All
showings on Tuesday nights
were featured at 99 cents.
Tuesday night reduced prices
are now subject to the whims of
the management.) But the
screens are tiny, the theater is
always crowded, and you move
from line to line until you feel
you're being processed. Fur
thermore, it's an offensively
ugly environment in which to
see movies — the theater looks
vaguely like a video arcade.
But if you must, you must. Lo
cated in the Old Mill Shopping
Mall on San Antonio Road,
near the San Antonio Shop
ping Center. (The easiest way
to get to it is via Alma; if you
take the San Antonio turnoff,
you'll find immediate signs for
the Old Mill.)
U.A. Redwood 6 — Another
six-screen theater, the U.A. is
located in one of the most un
attractive areas in Redwood
City (which is saying a lot), and
the theater is even more
claustrophic than the Old Mill.
But it's not as popular (I've
never been turned away) and
all matinees (except Sundays
and holidays) are offered at
bargain prices.
Mann 6 — Fashion Island
Shopping Mall, located in San
Mateo just off Route 92
(heading toward the San Mateo
Bridge — watch for the turnoff
to the right, or you'll end up in
Hayward), is amazing. The

shopping center is enormous,
and you drive around it for
what seems like hours before
you can park outside the Mann
6 theaters. Inside sits every
junk food shop you've ever
craved (or avoided) — usually
semi-vacant. Before slipping in
to see a movie at one of the six
small screens, you can sit and
lick your Haagen-Dazs
chocolate-chocolate chip cone
or bite into your corn dog
while watching kids ice skate
on the rink that separates the
fast food stands from the
movies. Fashion Island is also
big on bargain matinees, and if
you pick an unconventional
time to go (like 5:00 in the af
ternoon) you can see even a
blockbuster like Indiana Jones
without a wait. Besides, it's a
pop cultural experience you
won't want to miss.
Belmont — Sometimes a
movie you want to see disap
pears from every other theater
within a 20-minute drive ex
cept for the Belmont, and so if
you're persistent you hunt
down this suburban house
(located north of Ralston Ave
nue on El Camino — there's a
Ralston Ave. exit on both 101
and 280), where there's never a
line and tickets are $2 a head
even on Saturday nights. A
charmingly rundown theater.
Any local paper will tell you
what's playing at each of the
above theaters except those
north of Menlo Park — you'll
need a Chronicle or an Ex
aminer for that information.
The bills usually change on
Fridays (except for the revival
cinemas, of course). The best
overall guide to the movies is
the Aits and Entertainment
section of the Sunday Ex
aminer 8c Chronicle, affec
tionately known as the "pink
section." A number of local
theaters advertise in The Daily,
as do the on-campus film se
ries. A selective list of movies
(mostly revivals) appears in the
"Cinemascope" section of The
Daily every Friday.
During the school year,
seven or eight film series may
be in operation at the same
time, but most summers only
the ASSU Sunday Flicks —
dealing exclusively in recent
theatrical releases (and usually
box office hits) — and perhaps
the S'l ARTS Great Director
Series (which last summer in
cluded Bunuel and Eisenstein
classics) continue to screen
films. However, the Peninsula
boasts a large number and vari
ety of moviehouses, both first
and second-run, that make it
possible not only to go to the
movies every night but also to
skip, if you so desire, that long
trek to the city. In Palo Alto,
Menlo Park and Mountain
View alone t lie re are nine
theaters (15 screens), including
three revival cinemas, and
within a 15- or 20-minute dis
tance — in Redwood City, San
Mateo and Belmont — newly
arrived movie addicts will find
their needs liberally tended to:
New Varsity — located on
University Avenue between
Waverly and Cow per Streets,
the New Varsity is a nearly
ideal repertory cinema. Double
bills (and occasionally triple
bills) change every day or two,
and they offer not only recent
films (often hot off the first
run screens) but also American
and foreign classics, some not
often revived. If a relatively
unpublici/ed movie opens in
San Francisco and tails to show
up first-run in Palo Alto,
chances are it will surface at the
New Varsity within 6 or 8
months. The seats are slightly
rickety and uncomfortable, but
the Varsity's patrons don't
.seem to mind very much. The
building also houses an indoor
outdoor cafe-restaurant where
locals often gather in the eve
ning for coffee, dessert and
live music in the courtyard.
Warning: On Friday nights the
Varsity is a hangout for
teenagers — a responsive but
perhaps overly vocal audience
for the movies tlie manage

ment has lately (in the past
year) provided to cater to high
school audiences.
Festival — Just behind the
Varsity, on Hamilton Avenue
just west of Cowper Street, is
the Festival 7 heatre, which
shows one double bill a week.
(The movies change on
Thursday.) It's much smaller
than the Varsity — intimate —
but very co/.y, with overstuffed
seats and enormous pillows on
the floor just in front of the
screen. Almost all the features
are Hollywood movies from
the 1930s and 40s (there's a
British double bill every six
weeks or so), which are a treat
to see again on a big screen
even il you've already caught
them on TV. The latest
schedule does include On Golden
Pond, which represents an un
fortunate departure from their
usual programming policy.
Aquarius — The Aquarius,
on Emerson between Univer
sity and Lytton, has two small
cinemas that show mostly
foreign films, with the oc
casional "small" American
feature like Chilly Scenes of Win
ter or Angelo, My Love. Since it is
one of Palo Alto's major claims
to culture, it is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Satur
day nights; the Palo Alto
moviegoing crowd tends to
adopt certain movies that open
at the Aquarius — El Norte or
Carmen - and keep them
playing there for months. It's
your basic (essential) university
theater, and though its films
are (of course) of highly
variable quality, the manage
ment has never compromised
its decision to show only ar
thouse selections.
Bijou — For years the
Aquarius Cinemas owned the
Bijou — a small cinema just
down the street, on Emerson
between Hamilton and Forest
— but last December new
owners converted it into a
revival house dedicated (we
were repeatedly told) to
showing unusual movies,
domestic and foreign, that

don't often appear on local
screens. And the first schedule
contained dozens of such films
— it was a movie buff's
paradise, until the manage
ment decided it couldn't make
money that way. Each subse
quent schedule has been less
interesting than the last, and at
the moment, except for the
weekly foreign film evening,
it's a poor man's New Varsity
— and once a week or so it
turns into a nightclub, giving
over its space to a stand-up
comic. (It's a schizophrenic
moviehouse.) But no matter
who or what is playing on any
night at the Bijou, you can be
sure you'll hear the owner, Bob
Stern, make his opening
speech to the audience.
