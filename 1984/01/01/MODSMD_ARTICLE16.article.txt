# Searching for art on the farm and beyond

Keeping track of Bay Area
art — who's doing what, and
where — is the hardest job of
all for the culture hound.
Outside of a few major
museums, art is the least
publicized aspect of the local
cultural life. Adding to the
problem is the number of small
galleries, especially in San
Francisco, many of which stage
consistently interesting exhibits
which last a month or less and
which you won't know about
unices you seek them out. Be
cause of the vast number of
nearby houses and galleries
that exhibit art, the following
account is destined to be highly
arbitrary; I only hope to point
out a few of the more impor
tant venues.
The Stanford Art Depart
ment maintains both the
Stanford Museum of Art and
the Stanford Art Gallery. The
museum's permanent collec
tion is a marvelous resource for
students; all periods of
European art are represented,
and there are rooms devoted to
Greek and Roman, Asian and
Oceanic art as well. There is
also a large gallery devoted to
Stanford family memorabilia.
The museum's main claim to
fame is its renowned Rodin col
lection, which is housed in a
special rotunda within the
museum (as well as in various
outdoor spots on campus). The
museum's upstairs balconies
and the Meidel room hold spe
cial exhibits; a collection en
titled "The Dragon in Asian
Art" is schedulted through the
summer.

The Stanford Gallery,
snuggled in between the Busi
ness School, Hoover Tower
and the Art Building, offers
rotating exhibits throughout
the year. The gallery building
also houses the Gallery Book
shop, which sells art books,
cards and posters.
A number of other places on
campus hang exhibits on a
fairly regualar basis. STARTS
(Student Arts at Stanford)
stages monthly exhibits in the
Coffee House and in the
upstairs lobby of Tresidder
Union. Bechtel International
Center houses rotating exhibits
of international, often Third
World, themes. And the Lurie
Rotunda in the old wing of
Green Library is houses book
arts.
Finally, the Stanford campus
is graced by an impressive ar
ray of outdoor sculpture.
Among the highlights: Henry
Moore's "Large Torso," in
front of the Art Building; Joan
Miro's "Oiseau," near the steps
to Annenberg Auditorium; Al
exander Calder's "Le Faucon,"
in front of the Law School;
Josef Alber's "Wall," west of
the C>nad, and nearby, George
Segal's "Gay Liberation."
San Francisco is home to
four major museums, three of
which are under common
management as the "Fine Arts
Museums of San Francisco":
the M.H. de Young Memorial
Museum and the Asian Art
Museum (both in the same
building in Golden Gate Park)
and the California Palace of
the Legion of Honor (in Lin

coin Park, overlooking the
ocean). The de Young's collec
tion, which encompasses the
standard Western art proces
sion, isn't particularly
noteworthy (i.e., one visit is
pleasant, but enough), but the
museum plays host to many of
the top national and interna
tional traveling exhibits — in
recent years San Francisco
money has brought the Tut,
Tiffany, Alexander, Vatican,
etc., shows to the de Young.
The Asian Art Museum has
one of the best permanent col
lections in its field in this
country; unfortunately, there
isn't enough room on the walls
for more than a fraction of it.
I he collection is constantly
rotated. The collection of the
Palace of the Legion of Honor
is composed entirely of French
art, from medieval tapestries to
a room of Impressionists and
post-Impressionists. In the
basement of the Legion is the
museums' Graphic Arts de
partment, which puts up con
sistently good exhibits of prints
and drawings. The Legion also
draws big-name temporary ex
hibits — the Phillips collection
and the Dresden exhibit
stopped there in their travels.
Temporary exhibits that will
be up in the Fine Arts
Museums this summer include:
"Auspicious Spirits: Korean
Folk Paintings and Related Ob
jects" and "Asian Masterpieces
in Wood" at the Asian Art
Museum; "Grant Wood: The
Regionalist Vision" and "Maya
Ceramic Vases from the Late

Classic Period" at the de
Young; and exhibits of the po
litical caricatures of Thomas
Nast and David Levine at the
Legion of Honor.
The fourth of San Fran
cisco's prominent museums is
the rather small Museum of
Modern Art (Van Ness and
McAllister, in the Civic Cen
ter). The MOMA can't pretend
to be a catalogue of 20th
century art, like its namesake
in New York; in fact, its per
manent collection is surpris
ingly meager. It has its
strengths, however, especially
its vast photography holdings,
which it constantly draws on
for small, ever-changing ex
hibits; and a room of
monumental paintings by local
abstract expressionist Clyfford
Still. MOMA is currently trying
to expand into other parts of
the Veteran's Memorial Build
ing, the third and fourth floors
of which it now occupies; in the
meantime, it continues its
somewhat perverse policy of
using most of its small allot
ment of space for temporary
exhibits. Some of the items on
the docket for this summer are
"The Human Condition:
SFMMA Biennial III," a theme
exhibit whose exhibitors will
include Francis Bacon, Leon
Golub and Edward Kienholz;
"Figurative Expressionism: Art
of the Human Dilemma" (note
any trends here?); and a
retrospective of the works of
famed Stanford professor Nat
han Oliveira.
Across the bav, the Oakland

Museum (1000 Oak St., near
Lake Merritt and the Lake
Merritt BART station) is worth
a visit it only for the building it
self, an award-winning con
crete pile designed by Kevin
Roche. The museum is offi
cally The Museum of Califor
nia, and has galleries devoted
to California art, history and
natural sciences.
Also worth a visit is the
University Art Museum at
UC-Berkeley (2626 Bancroft
Way). The museum (housed in
another award-winning con
crete building) owes its exis
tence, and a large part of its
collection and initial funding,
to German painter Hans Hof
fman. Hoffman spent the
second world war as a refugee
at the Berkeley campus, and as
a show of gratitude gave a
group of his canvases and a
large sum of money to the uni
versity so that they could build
a museum. His large, abstract
paintings are still the museum s
centerpiece.
Mentioning any of the
(literally) thousands of small
galleries in the area would
show rank favoritism. My best
advice is to scan the gallery list
ings in the Sunday Ex
aminer/Chronicle pink section,
and check the art listings in
such sources as San Francisco
Magazine, Focus Magazine (the
one published by KQED-TV in
San Francisco, not the one put
out by the NAA(T) and Cali
fornia Magazine. These will all
contain museum listings as
well.
