The Goose serves beer,
burgers, and a few other dishes
in thai beer hall atmosphere,
complete with plenty of
peanuts on the floor, that stu
dents thrive on. It you go here
on a Saturday night you're sure
to see students playing pool,

of the dark wood booths to do
some serious consuming.
The Alpine Inn

Alpine Road

Formerly Rosotti's, hence
the nickname Zott's, The
Alpine Inn is a favorite beer
and burger place, especially in
the summer when they can be
enjoyed outside on picnic
tables in the beer garden. Some

1 he pizza here won a recent
Daily taste test and Ramona's
has more than just pizza. They
also serve good hamburgers

The salad bar is one of the best
around, though old-timers
claim it's gone downhill.
Lafe for the Train
561 Oak Grove
Menlo Park
321-6124
Gozy personalized atmo
sphere and meticulous atten
tion to the freshness and fine
preparation of wholesome
food have made Late for the
Train "the place" for Sunday
brunch in the area.
Late for the Train has a reg
ular following due to both its
quality and moderate prices.
The only drawback might be a
short wait, though even the
wait is made more pleasant by
the complimentary lea and cof -
fee that is provided.
Each table is decorated with
lace and a floral arrangement.
An assortment of plants and
decorations on the walls gives
the restaurant the look of
"Grandma's place" without
being overdone.
Three cheese omelets cost
$4.25. What could be just nor
mal becomes special with the
addition of cream cheese and
chives. Many other omelets are
available and cost about $5.
They are served with cubed
potatoes sauteed with onions.
Sauteed fish and eggs, fresh
fruit dishes, and French toast
are a few of the other breakfast
choices. A variety of sand
wiches and salads are available
for lunch. But be careful; Late
for the Train is not open for
dinner. You'll have to go to
The Flea Street Cafe, which is
owned by the same family, for
that.
Pear Williams
150 Middlefield Road
Menlo Park
323-8445
Pear Williams has a reputa
tion in the area for having
some of the finest French food
around, and deservedly so.
I he dishes are impeccably
prepared and the owner him
self watches over the restau
rant to make sure everything is
up high standards. The

name Pear Williams comes
from the house's dessert
specialty, which is fresh
poached pear half on a bed of
vanilla ice cream with
homemade caramel sauce.
The atmosphere is calm and
comfortable. Four or five indi
vidually carved booths painted
with a variety of pastel colors
give the restaurant a unique
look that is neither too casual
nor too stuffy. .
Entrees range in price from
$9.50 to $15.95 and include
truite Grenoblaise (sauteed
trout with brown butter lemon
and capers), coquilles St.
Jacques an cresson (fresh
poached scallops in a sauce of
creme fraiche and watercress)
and filet mignon de boeuf aux
echalotes (sauteed medallions
of beef in demi-glace and
cream). All entrees include
soup, salad and bread.
1 he lunch menu offers
Pear's burger ($5.95), a fruit
and cheese board ($5.50),
crepes ($5.95), fresh filet of
sole ($7.95) and many other
French specialties.
Sunday brunch is also a fa
vorite here. One receives a
glass of champagne, a trip to
the I ruit buffet, homemade
muf fins and jam, and a choice
of entree from a list including
steak and eggs, snapper
Milanaise, eggs benedict and
several other choices for $9.50.
Henry's
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680
A chalkboard outside
Henry's lists the daily specials
;md it's hard to walk by without
wanting to stop in to try them.
Henry's is Palo Alto's version
of a New York bar and grill.
Beer signs and dark hardwood
walls create the atmosphere,
but the food is a bit more ele
gant than you'd expect.
It's not a bad idea to stop at
the bar for some appetizers.
The 112 ried brie with apples was
the standout item.
The specials one recent
night were delicious. The red
snapper dijonaise ($10.95) was
a large piece of snapper
prepared with spicy dijon mus
tard. Seafood quenelles in
Cajun sauce ($9.75) consisted
of poached puree of salmon,
scallops and red snapper
served in small mounds with
Cajun sauce — a light gravy
made with crayfish. If one likes
seafood, this original dish is a
winner.
Another good bet is emince
de veau Zurich (veal Zurich
style), which is complemented
by a fine light sauce. More
traditional items such as top
sirloin steak ($11.50) and
Henry's dinner burger ($6.95)
are available.
Grand China
5100 El Camino Real
Los Altos
964-6464
Grand China is a better than
average Chinese restaurant in
an area with no real shortage
of them.
I he sweet and sour shrimp
and scallops with garlic sauce
are two of the best dishes
available from the large and
diverse menu.
What sets Grand China apart
is that it is one of the few res
taurants on the Midpeninsula
which serves weekend dim
sum. This affordable feast is
great for a large group. The
dim sum menu lists forty items
which are usually quite low in
price — they start at 70 cents.
Simply mark your selections

and give the menu back to the
waiter.
The fun thing is that you can
order a large number of
choices, such as steamed or
fried dough treats filled with
different items, potstickers,
soup, and many others.
The prices for the more
traditional Mandarin dishes
range from $4.00 to $8.
Maddalena's
544 Emerson Street
Palo Alto
326-6082
The scenario: An incredibly
fussy grandmother, father or
flame wants to go out to dinner
and you must choose a place
that will not disappoint them.
You're safe choosing Mad
dalena's. Both Italian and
French specialties are served in
a gracious Continental atmo
sphere where attention to
proper decorum is a certainty.
Maddalena's can match the
dressiest occasion with its white
linen, a huge chandelier, and

bevelled mirrors. But it is not
stuffy. One room is especially
warm, with dark wood and
spotlights on French can-can
posters. Another nice touch is
provided by a classical guitar
player.
Everything on the menu is a
la carte, which is ultimately
more expensive, but also more
fun. You might start with es
cargots bourguigonnes ($5.95),
cherrystone clams ($6.25) or
delicious French onion au
gratin soup ($3.50) instead of
the usual salad.
A well-presented and
prepared entree is the saute
prawns bordelaise ($14.95).
Other tempting dishes are
tournedos Henri IV, coq au vin
($1 1.50), and linguini caciucco
($13.50), which is pasta with
shrimp, crab and baby clams.
If you'd like a more intimate
meal, Mr. Maddalena in
formed us that a small room
can be reserved for an intimate
party of two.
Hugo's Market
Hyatt Rickey's
4219 El Camino
Palo Alto
493-8000
Where can you get filet mig
non, a salad bar with calamari,
and top off the dinner with ice
cream sundaes? 1 know of only
one place— Hugo's Market. It
offers elegant dining with a
little extra.
Although entrees are fairly
expensive, ranging from
$13.95 to $20.95, a mag
nificent salad bar, a cool sorbet
to "refresh your palate be
tween courses" and a sundae

bar are all included with the
meal.
The salad bar is the largest I
have seen in the area. Along
with lettuce and spinach salad,
there are calamari, cheese and
ham salad in a vinaigrette
dressing, mushrooms and ar
tichoke hearts, herring,
shrimp, and fresh fruit. For
$11.95 one can make a great
meal at the salad and dessert
bar.
The entrees are also very
good. The prawns and pasta
($18.50) includes jumbo
prawns, diced tomatoes and
broccoli served on pasta
alfredo. The prawns are large
and fresh and the combination
of flavors is perfect.
Other entrees include honey
almond duckling ($17.50), In
donesian rack of lamb
($20.95), poached salmon
($ 17.50) and more.
The real joys of a meal at
Hugo's, however, are the little
extras. The lemon sherbet
served in a small cone after the
salad bar is a treat. Along with

the traditional cream and
sugar, the coffee is served with
whipped cream and chocolate
bits. I hese sort of novel addi
tions help give Hugo's the per
sonality many hotel restaurants
lack and make it an establish
ment worth splurging on.
Restaurant Des Alpes
201 California Avenue
Palo Alto
326-4112
You can't argue with staying
power and Des Alpes has it.
Ihe restaurant is quietly
tucked away on California Ave
nue and one doesn't hear a lot
about it, but a regular clientele
has been going there for years.
The attraction of Des Alpes
is a warm European atmo
sphere and moderate prices
for complete dinners and great
daily specials. It also has great
red cabbage which is a real find
for those who love it.
The restaurant looks like a
Swiss chalet outside. The inside
consists of two rooms, one with
a wine collection that takes the
entire wall. Ask the wine stew
ard for advice. He knows his
stuff.
A fresh seafood special is
available each day. The
chicken selections from the
menu are chicken toscana
($8.50), which is chicken
served with a sauce of ar
tichoke hearts, olives,
tomatoes, mushrooms and
green peppers, and chicken
breast a la excelsior ($8.95),
which is breast of chicken
stuffed with pate in a port wine
sauce. Swiss specialties like beef
roulade ($8.50), sliced beef
stuffed with mustard, onions,

pickles and bacon served in a
gravy and Swiss bratwurst
($6.75) with red cabbage are
also good choices. There's also
a New York steak ($10.95) on
the regular menu.
All dinners include soup or
salad, a vegetable, rice, ice
cream, and coffee or tea. Spe
cial desserts include apple and
spice cake and various
homemade cheesecakes (one
night recenty it was Black For
est cheesecake). Children's
plates are available at prices
from $2 to $4.50 and range
from peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches to New York steak.
Closed Mondays.
Caravansary
321 Stanford Shopping Center
Palo Alto
327-2682
Walking into Caravansary,
one is greeted with a slight
sense of confusion. On the one
hand, the shop seems to
resemble an old country store:
Baskets adorn the walls and
ceiling, and a wide array of cof
fees, teas, and sweets is
available behind an old
fashioned counter.
However, this stereotype is
soon shattered by the high,
modern ceilings and sidewalk
cafe atmosphere generated by
the cobbled floor and tables
carefully placed in the front of
the shop near a large window.
Caravansary defies descrip
tion — it is a store in the Stan
ford Shopping Center that
should be browsed through by
all. It is a good restaurant, but
also the ideal place to stock up
for elegant picnic supplies. It
offers a wiHe array of inter
national cheeses as well as
pates, deli sandwiches, drinks
and desserts.
Dishes availaLle include
briochky ($5), moussaka
($4) and spinach filo pie
($5.75). All the dessert por
tions are large, and the pecan
pie, varieties of cake,
cheesecake and torte are all
good buys at $2.85.
The Old Clamhouse
355 State Street
Los Altos
941-8199
If your seafood palate is
looking for a change from Palo
Alto's offerings, The Old
Clamhouse in nearby Los Altos
is the perfect solution.
It's easy to spot with its yacht
club royal blue awning. The at
mosphere is casual and
friendly and the service is
prompt. You'll receive a basket
of fresh bread and clam broth
(to dip your bread into) as you
scan the menu and the chalk
board which lists the daily spe
cials and fresh fish choices.
The specialties of the house
are steamed clams ($7.95) atid
clam house linguini ($6.95).
The clams are served with a
delightful garlic vinaigrette
and the portion size is just right
for two to share.
The chef's saute ($11.95) —
diced snapper, crab, and
shrimp meat sauted with
mushrooms and hollandaise
sauce — was delicious.
The petrale saute ($9.95)
was truly exquisite and simply
melted in our mouths. The fish
was very fresh and was
prepared in an uncomplicated
but absolutely mouth-watering
butter and garlic sauce. All the
seafood dishes were quite rea
sonably priced at $7.95 to
$12.95, considering the quality
and generous portions.
II asked, they'll serve up
mud pie direct from Baskin-
Robbins down the block.
