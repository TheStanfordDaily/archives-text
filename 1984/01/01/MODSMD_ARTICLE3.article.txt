# DISCOVERING STANFORD
## The 						Farm has gone from cows to computers 
### 
When David Starr Jordan
arrived at Stanford in the
summer of 1891 to be the Uni
versity's first president, he
found the countryside enthral
ling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles
and more from near the head
of San Francisco Bay. Bound
ing it on the southwest rises . . .
the Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously' ....
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its
cloak of redwood, oak and
madrono diversified by thic
kets of chemisal ....
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30

miles south of San Francisco,
its favorable climate assured by
its situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stan fords'
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stan
ford brought Francis Walker,
president of Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology and the
prominent landscape architect,
Frederick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the

foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below,
at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quad
rangle. The senator felt the flat
site was more practical for later
expansion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the
grounds and the buildings, but
it remained for the young
Boston architect, Charles Al
lerton Coolidge, to develop this
concept in the style of his late
mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the
most eminent architect of his
time.
The style is called Richard
son ian Romanesque, and it
follows the European
Romanesque, which is charac
terized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined bv covered ar
cades formed of successive

half-circle arches supported by
short columns with decorated
capitals.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings — with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church —
and three engineering build
ings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were
ready for the University's
opening on October 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White
of Cornell pronounced the
Stanford buildings the most
beautiful college architecture
in America.
But just before five on the
morning of April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's
new buildings shook for 45

seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and
caused millions of dollars of
damage.
The ponderous church
tower, with its clocks, chimes
and spire, crashed into the
chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out
the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the
inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad —
100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the
march of civilization — was
damaged beyond repair. So
were a library and gymnasium
that were just short of comple
tion. None of these was re
placed.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known
as "The Earthquake Class"
were voted their degrees in
May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pur
suing a construction project
that was begun in 1886 and
that has been intermittently
continued up to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the
Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central
portion running from El
Camino Real to the back
boundary in the foothills.
The areas designated for
light lie in open land, including
the arboretum, golf course and
the foothill lands used for
space-probing antennae and
research in nuclear physics and
biological sciences.
The inner and outer quads
occupy 17 acres at the heart of
the academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by
the president and his staff , date
from the time the University
opened in 1891, while the
outer quad was completed in
1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedi
cated.
Buildings in the outer quad
are being brought up to
earthquake-proof standards by
an "inside-out" process of con
struction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanford*' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of
no particular denomination. In
the Founding Grant, they di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the
immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all-wise and be
nevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and

the University were to be non
sectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the original plans, the
central site now occupied by
the church was reserved for it,
though construction was defer
red. When Senator Stanford
died in 1893, his widow deter
mined that the church would
be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permis
sion to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last Supper" in the Sis
tine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, de
picting the history of redemp
tion. The largest mosaic, how
ever, occupies most of the
facade of the church and, with
47 figures, depicts the Sermon
on the Mount.
After the earthquake of
1906, the structure was com
pletely dismantled and rebuilt
around a steel framework.
Another set of mosaics was
brought from Venice, but the
80-foot spire, housing clocks
and chimes, was never rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 194 1. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast
documentary collections of the
Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace — mil
lions of items that include
books, documents, files, man
uscripts, diaries, pamphlets,
posters, maps and phofos. The
Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, completed in 1978,
honors the former president's
humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him
in a position to document the
war, Hoover shipped crates of
material to the library at Stan
ford, his alma mater.

At the 1941 ceremony,
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a
challenge to those who pro
mote war. I hey should attract
those who search for peace."
The Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on
Mussolini than can be found in
Italy. It also probably has the
most complete record on Hitler
and the Nazi movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research
on problems of social, political
and economic change in the
20th century.
Across from Hoover lower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium), built in 1937. Built
primarily through student

contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War I, the au
ditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the
Stanford dead of World War
11. The main auditorium seats
1700 and the Little Theater
seats 200.
Just south of the quad is
White Memorial Plaza, a
200,000 square foot land
scaped area donated to the
University by Mr. and Mrs.
Raymond White in memory of
their sons. The focal point of
the plaza is a tall, free-form
fountain executed in bronze by
San Francisco sculptor Aris
tides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memo
rial Union, the music building
and the Old Union — which
contains several student ser

vices — the plaza is a campus
crossroads.
As the '70s end, the Univer
sity draws to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the
early '60s in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet its
big post-war expansion in stu
dents and faculty.
In the hist 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325
million to pay for new campus
facilities and improvements,
including campus landmarks
such as Maples Pavilion, Meyer
Library, the Green Library
annex, the Terman Engineer
ing Center and the Mudd
Chemistry Building.
