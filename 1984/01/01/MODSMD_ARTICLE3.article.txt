# DISCOVERING STANFORD

When David Starr Jordan
arrived at Stanford in the
summer of 1891 to be the Uni
versity's first president, he
found the countryside enthral
ling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles
and more from near the head
of San Francisco Bay. Bound
ing it on the southwest rises . . .
the Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously' ....
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its
cloak of redwood, oak and
madrono diversified by thic
kets of chemisal ....
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30

miles south of San Francisco,
its favorable climate assured by
its situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stan fords'
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stan
ford brought Francis Walker,
president of Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology and the
prominent landscape architect,
Frederick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the

foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below,
at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quad
rangle. The senator felt the flat
site was more practical for later
expansion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the
grounds and the buildings, but
it remained for the young
Boston architect, Charles Al
lerton Coolidge, to develop this
concept in the style of his late
mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the
most eminent architect of his
time.
The style is called Richard
son ian Romanesque, and it
follows the European
Romanesque, which is charac
terized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined bv covered ar
cades formed of successive

half-circle arches supported by
short columns with decorated
capitals.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings — with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church —
and three engineering build
ings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were
ready for the University's
opening on October 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White
of Cornell pronounced the
Stanford buildings the most
beautiful college architecture
in America.
But just before five on the
morning of April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's
new buildings shook for 45

seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and
caused millions of dollars of
damage.
The ponderous church
tower, with its clocks, chimes
and spire, crashed into the
chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out
the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the
inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad —
100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the
march of civilization — was
damaged beyond repair. So
were a library and gymnasium
that were just short of comple
tion. None of these was re
placed.
