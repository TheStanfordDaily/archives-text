### LISA LYNCH 
Nothing to do on a Wednes
day night? Why not catch a
Scandinavian folk dance class?
Thanks to two thriving Tresid
der programming organiza
tions, students and visitors this
summer will be able to do any
thing from rock climbing to
Scottish folk dance.
STARTS, Student Arts at
Stanford, and SOAR, Stanford
Outdoor Adventures in
Recreation, both offer as many
or more programs during the*
summer as they do during the
school year. SOAR an organi
zation which gets students off

campus and into backpacks
and canoes, has more than a
dozen programs scheduled for
the summer.
"Our programs are open to
anyone in the Stanford com

SOAR's director. Beginning on
June 21 and continuing
through the end of August, the
trips planned include
whitewater rafting excursions,
ropes courses, canoeing trips,
rock climbing classes, a horse
back ride to the ocean and a
Yosemite backpacking trip.
Usually there are two identical
trips two days in a row; for ex

ample, there is a rock climbing
class planned for both July 14
and 15.
Usually the trips are organ
ized in a pre-trip meeting one
to two weeks before the actual
excursion; carpools are organ
ized and equipment needs des
cribed. St. Clair said that the
trip costs vary from $10 for a
weekend of backpacking to $45
for a day of whitewater rafting.
The size of the groups ranges
from six to seven for a rock
climbing class to 15 and up for
rafting trips.
SOAR also rents backpacks,
tents and sleeping bags; fees

range from $3 to $9 for a
weekend rental. For more in
formation, stop by the infor
mation desk at the Tresidder
Recreation Center or call 497-

STARTS, Stanford's student
arts group, has a wide variety
of music and dance programs
scheduled for the summer. Ac
cording to STARTS director
Keith Archuleta, there are
eight dance classes open to stu
dents, faculty and visitors. All
are on weekday nights and are
held in the Clubhouse in Old
Union or Roble Gym. The
registration for these classes is

at the beginning of summer
quarter, but anyone can drop
in and pay on a per-class basis.
Archuleta said that visitors
should look for Tresidder's
pink program guide for a com
plete schedule of classes.
In addition to the dance
classes. STARTS is holding a
one-day book-publishing
workshop on July 14, for
"graduate students, entre
preneurs, or anyone interested
in publishing their own book."
Also scheduled is a "Speaking
