# THE 						BAY AREA
## Temples of Tourism to visit in 'The City' 
### 
No stay in the area is com
plete without a tour of the most
popular tourist digs in "the
City." Listed below are some of
San Francisco's most famous
attractions; the rest is up to
you. Just remember — it's
never really summer in San
Francisco, so dress warmly.
And bring a camera.
Cable Cars — Back in opera
tion after a heartbreaking
hiatus. They aren't only trans
portation, they're a way of life.
Alcatraz — Known to
inmates as "The Rock," Al
catraz claims most of its fame
from the time that it was a
Devil's Isle-style federal
penitentiary housing such
notable criminals as the bird
man. ITie island has also been
used as a fortification, a U.S.
military prison, an army dis
ciplinary barracks and an
American Indian stronghold.
The National Park Service
runs two-hour conducted tours
from the waterfront; but be
warned that this is one of the
city's most popular attractions
and reservations are hard to
get.
Ghirardelli Square — Here
is where 19th-century laborers
once made chocolate,
packaged spices and wove fine
woolens. Nowadays, visitors
browse through a shopping
plaza, watch street performers,
and buy chocolate and ice
cream in the original chocolate
building.
Chinatown — A long-time
resident of Hong Kong once
said that Chinatown reminded
him of home — the rush-hour
traffic jams on the main drag
rivaled any traffic tie-up a
Chinese city could muster. But
Giant Avenue also offers a ka
leidoscope of Asian delights —
restaurants, dim sum bars,
pharmacies displaying pickled
snakes. . . . The streets radiat
ing out from Grant Avenue
house one of the largest
Chinese populations outside of
China and plenty of opportu
nities for exploration.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty
fishermen, seagulls and the
ripe smell of fish once
dominated San Francisco's
wharf. Although the nearby
ships still berth travelers, car
nivals, wax museums and
tourist shops have almost taken
over the surrounding wharf
area. Still, the 19th-century
museum ship Balclutha harks
back to the old days, and some

of the city's best restaurants are
to be found along the wharf.
Polk Street — In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue
once supported a posh shop
ping district catering to the
well-to-do residents of Russian
Hill and Nob Hill. Bath houses
and gay activists have since
suppl anted the fur-coated
housewives and chic shops.
Shopping on Polk Street may
no longer be elite, but it's
trendy and fun. Beware of
high prices.
Golden Gate Bridge —
Visitors are of ten disappointed
to discover the bridge is not so
named because it is painted
gold, but rather because the
sun always sets on the Golden
Gate. Not really, even . . . the
gate is often "socked in" by fog,
to the dismay of tourists
dressed for California sun.
The Cannery — A defunct
Del Monte cannery trans
formed into a galleria of shops
and restaurants. Mimes and
musicians regularly give per
formances in the complex's
square.
Telegraph Hill — The
Bohemian section of San Fran
cisco. The circuitous streets
and cliff-hanging houses of
Telegraph Hill have been in
habited by successive genera
tions of flower children, artists
and literati.
49 Mile Drive — This half
day tour is a planned drive
through the most famous
landmarks of "the City". The
route starts on Van Ness Ave
nue at the Civic Center and is
clearly marked by blue and
white seagull signs.
Palace of Fine Arts — A
wonderful anachronism.
Created as the ciiaciem of the
1915 Pacific Exposition, a
central rotunda embracing a
Corinthian colonnade orna
mented with 112 riezes and statues
comprise the Palace. A ruin by
the 19505, the Palace was
restored in the '60s and now
houses the Exploratorium, a
hands-on science museum with
over 400 exhibits.
Washington Square — San
Francisco's "Little Italy". After
gorging on pasta, sit in the
square and watch schoolgirls
coming out of confession in the
adjacent churches of Saint
Peter and Paul.
Twin Peaks — A cliche neck
ing and hangout joint for the
Bay Area's teens, the peaks of
fer an intoxicating panorama

from the Marin Headlands to
the Santa Clara Valley.
Lombard Street — A
popular postcard advertises
Lombard as "The crookedest
street in the world." There are
10 hairpin turns in a single
block.
George R. Moscone Con
vention Center — A $126 mil
lion affirmation that San Fran
cisco is indeed a tourist town.
Moscone Center houses an ex

hibit hall, 41 meeting rooms, a
ballroom .and a special-events
theater. The facility is named
for the late mayor of San Fran
sisco who was assassinated in
the '70s by Dan White, who was
a San Francisco supervisor at
t he time.
