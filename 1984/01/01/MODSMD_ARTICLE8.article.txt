# Don't miss the area's offbeat adventures
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
I he Bay Area is no doubt
one of the most exciting places
around, but one can only
spend so many hours gazing at
the fog lifting over the Golden
Gate Bridge or chatting with
the seals in Ano Nuevo. For
those who find the thought of
yet another trip to Chinatown
or Ghirardelli Square about as
appealing as a walking tour of
Secaucus, N.J., take heart.
I here are still a few offbeat op
tions in the Bay Area that you
probably haven't tried.
1. Visit The Condor Nightclub
(Carol Doda's)
In (he heart of San Fran
cisco's Broadway District, the
Condor is both a sleazy
nightclub and a rite of passage
for generations of Stanford
men. Doda, a topless dancer,
has been performing regularly
ai the Condor ever since June
19, 1964, when she wriggled
into national attention while
entertaining the Republican
National Convention. Two
decades later, she still retains
her audience, though by now
most of her admirers are years
younger than she. The drinks
are watered and the service is
lousy. Be sure to get a postcard
or two and ask a waiter about
the Great Killer Piano Scandal
of last fall. The Condor is at
Broadway and Columbus, and
the flashing neon nipples are
hard to miss. Call ahead (392-
4443) and ask if Doda will be
there.
2.Get a Tattoo
For a slightly more perman
ent souvenir of the City than a
loaf of sourdough bread, there
are tattoo artists in San Fran
cisco who will imprint you with
anything from the Golden
Gate Bi idge to the more tradi
tional "mother".
Lyle luttle, who holds court
at 30 Seventh Street off Mar
ket, is the Gucci of San Fran
cisco tattoo artists. I uttle, who
has been featured in Esquire
and Life magazines and fre
quented by well-knowns such
as Janis Joplin, is himself
tattooed from head to toe. He
does custom work or standard
designs, and even the
squeamish can take refuge in
the Tattoo Museum next to
1 little's studio. Hours are 112 rom
noon to 6 p.m. Monday to Sat
urday. Phone 864-9798.
Picture Magazine, run by Pat
Martynuik, sells its designs in
ternationally. There is a $15
minimum charge for work
done here, and an appoint
ment is recommended. Hours
are from noon to midnight
Monday through Saturday,

noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday.
Phone 668-7377.
Realistic Tattoo at 2535 Van
Ness is run by Ed Hardy, who
was voted Tattoo Artist of the
year in 1977. Hardy works
seven days a week, by appoint
ment only; call 928-0910.
3. Get Religious
One can be Born Again al
most anywhere these days, but
one of the most entertaining
enlightenments around can be
found at the Glide Memorial
Church, home of evangelist
Cecil Williams.
Every Sunday at 9 and 1 1
a.m., Williams tours the Ten
derloin district (San Fransisco
Bowery for those hailing form
the East Coast), and peels the
lost souls and the soleless off
the streets and sidewalks. Back
at the Glide Memorial, Wil
liams lambasts his parishioners
until he is reasonably sure of
their salvation.
Williams' celebration is open
to anyone, though the
denomination is actually Meth
odist. T he church is at the cor
ner of Ellis and Taylor, phone
771-6300. Better than Sunday
morning televison.
4.Lose Your Senses
Or alter your state, depend
ing. Those of you who've al
ways wondered what it would
be like to float in a sensory
deprivation tank like they do in
the science fiction movies have
come to the right place.
Sensory deprivation tanks,
basically large coffin-like
structures that are dark, body
temperatured and filled with
salt water, are a unique way to
unwind if you don't go in ex
pecting to hallucinate bright
colors and primitive rituals.
"Floats" aren't cheap — a 90-
minute float can cost anywhere
112 rom $ 10 to $50 depending on
where you go — but they are
relaxing and, well, interesting.
Stanford has some tanks, but
you probably won't get in them
unless you know someone who
knows someone. But an easily
accessible tank is only a mile
away from campus, at a hot
tub-parlor-sushi-bar-flotation
center called Watercourse
Way. The place has an aura of
holistic hedonism — ambient
music, 112 ruit juices and raw fish
coupled with six different
"styles" of hot tub rooms —
each complete with cold
shower and cot.
But we're talking sensory
deprivation here. Watercourse
Way has one tank, a very nice
one, and you can float in it
Tuesday through Saturday if
you make an appointment.

The charge is $20 for 90
minutes.
In addition to the standard
float, there is the "imaging to
achieve" service run by Briati
Hennessey out of Watercourse
Way. Hennessey, who floats his
clients on Mondays, Wednes
days and Sundays, is the owner
of the tank, and he has
equipped it with speakers, a
video camera and some high
tech Apple II gadgets that
makes the tank allegedy the
world's most sophisticated.

Hennessey uses the tank as a
controlled enviornment to con
dition his perfection-hungry
clients. While they are floating
he shows them role models on
the videoscreen in the tank (for
example, dancers watch a per
fect dancer and golfers watch a
perfect golfer) in an effort to
improve their performance.
Hennessey's service is of course
more expensive than the
'unguided floats', but clients
seem impressed with his tech
nique. Phone 224-0810 for

more information about
Watercourse Way.
s.Get Insulted
This spring marked the end
of an era — San Franciscans
were saddened to hear of the
death of the legendary World's
Rudest Waiter, Edsel Ford
Fong of Sam Wo's. Fong had
been at Wo's since the 19405,
insulting male diners and
propositioning their dates, and
being ultimately so charismati
cally offensive that he achieved

national reknown. Now that
he's gone, Wo's won't be the
same, but it's still a good place
to go if you don't like people
being too nice to you. Or really
good Chinese food. Go to 813
Washington Street or phone
982-0596.
6.Meet A Rat
Who bears the imposing
moniker of Chuck E. Cheese?
Chuckie is one of the animated
rodent phantasms at Pizza
rime Theatre, which can be
reached by heading north on

Highway 101 until you get
there.
Pizza Time Theatre, one of
the few truly original things to
come out of Jersey, is a place
where you can eat pizza and be
entertained by all sorts of tacky
phenomena. Chuck E. Cheese
and his ilk are creatures
straight out of Disneyland's
Bear Country; at random in
tervals the six-foot tall mouse
and his band, which are set into
the wall, come to life and enter
tain customers. When you

aren't watching Chuck, you
may be accosted by a Groucho
Marx lookalike or a man asking
how old Chewbacca is. (If you
know the answer to this and
other exciting questions, you
get tokens to play video
games.)
Unfortunately, Pizza Time
Theatres have filed for bank
ruptcy, so if the possibility of
meeting a six-foot tall dummy
mouse seems particularly
enthralling, don't wait too
long.
