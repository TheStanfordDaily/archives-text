# Where to go when the Bay Area lights up
## 
### 
Newark has discos.
Cleveland has discos. Omaha
has discos. Even Marriott's
Great America has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accommodating Led
Zeppelin. Seattle has a really
big stadium and they put really
big (and trashy and mindless)
acts like Aerosmith in there.
Los Angeles has two stadiums
capable of accommodating
Aerosmith, if you count
Anaheim (the Rams did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied
quality. Every place also has
Roller Derby rinks and experi
mental theater. Every place has
most everything, if you look
long enough — even the most
branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to
see that this is true. Quality of
performance aside, it just goes
to show that it was a mistake to
leave Kansas in the first place.
Maybe out there you can't get

what you want, but you can get
what you need, so to speak.
Everything except
nightclubs, that is. San Fran
cisco's nightclubs, even more
than Herb Caen and the
Zodiac Killer, distinguish this
city 112 rom every inhabited com
munity outside New York State
lines. The City has both more
nightclubs and more variety
than LA, lor instance, which
holds eight times as many
human beings.
Of course it is very hard to
find one's way around when
one doesn't always know where
to go. It isn't always good to
have a billion zillion nightclubs
if your summer visitor's guide
doesn't at least include a guide
to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks
know about. It's not the
cheapest club, or the biggest,
or the friendliest, or the one
with best sound (Lord, no!).

But it is close, and that means a
lot to a mostly bicycle-bound
audience justifiably uneasy
about traversing the wilds of
San Mateo on a stray Samtrans
7F or facing the Tenderloin
district without an easy escape
route.
But location doth not a
nightclub make, and the
Keystone is not a nightclub, so
don't let anyone tell you differ
ently. A nightclub has enter
tainment, but also gives you an
atmosphere and a chance to
converse. The Keystone Palo
Alto does not exactly fail in
these goals; rather, it blatantly
refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently, the selection
of bands is like that of a small
concert arena — country
bumpkins one night, multi
genarian blues/jazz artists the
next, rapid and rabid lobotomy
rock the next (of both the
heavy metal and punk vari

eties). For the latter, be espe
cially forewarned, for Palo Alto
punk rockers are a singularly
ridiculous bunch. Despite the
kids with skinny ties borrowed
from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks
outside the Keystone dropping
off Skip and Cindy for Punk
Nite Out, the dancing inside
can often resemble a cross be
tween leapfrog and rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always
a good guess in the spontan
eous "let's go to a show" rallies
common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to
go out of your way to create
them, lhen the Mabuhay Gar
dens is waiting for you with
open safety pins. Five or six
years after the fact, punk music
seems to have settled its feud
with (and acknowledged debt
to) heavy metal. Perhaps in

deference to this newly dis
covered patrimony (or perhaps
to the sacred cash cow of the
concertgoing public), punk
clubs often have "metal nights"
and everyday audiences
definitely have more of an
axle-grease aura around them
these days. Which is actually
perfect for the Mabuhay Gar
dens. While the Keystone acts
like a small arena, the Fab Mab
is more like a slightly oversize
garage, with brick walls and a
self-consciously dangerous air
about it. The bands have the
best names in the Bay Area,
though certainly not the tonal
quality. Still thriving as a
Polynesian restaurant by
day/leatherette cave by night,
the club is best for those who
understand the colossal joke
taking place six or seven nights
a week. That's entertainment.
Roosting at the mouth of
Broadway, the Fab Mab also
serves as an introduction to the
North Beach area of the City,
where most of the real
nightclubs (i.e., the ones that
advertise) reside. Right across
the street from the Mab is The
Stone, owned by the same folks
who dispense entertainment at
the Keystone Palo Alto and the
Keystone Berkeley. The Stone
is sort of a hybrid; it has the
physical qualities of its immedi
ate neighbor but the music se
lection of the Keystone, a
decidedly pop flavor (they of
ten share bands, staging the
same show at each 'stone on
successive nights).
If you go down Broadway a
few blocks (negotiating your
way past the massage parlors
and Carol Doda) and turn onto
Columbus, you'll eventually
pass Wolfgang's, the physical
successor to the Boarding
House (901 Columbus) and the
spiritual heir to the Old Wal
dorf as Bill Graham's Home
for Acts That Can't Sell Out
the Coliseum. Amazingly
enough, few of the many sins
of the father are visited upon

the latest offspring; the sound
is decent, the stage and lighting
very good, and there's even a
balcony for those who really
don't go to clubs to see the
band. The only caveats to the
clubber are well-known to Wal
dorf denizens: beware the
chairs (bicycle seats with legs),
the drink minimum (the
"Calistoga with Orange Flavor"
tastes like it should have
"Agent'' in there somewhere)
and the food (Chicken Lol
lipops? McPutrid).
Better chairs and bigger
shows can be found at the
other Graham venue, the
Kabuki Nightclub at the Japan
Center near Geary Street. Lo
cated significantly west of
North Beach, the Kabuki
nonetheless has even more
traditional nightclub aes
thetics; it's big and flashy, like
the nightclubs in 1930s musi
cals, with lots of tables for the
Nicholas Brothers to dance
across. It's a little bit odd to see
Greg Kihn play in a place that
should have Billie Holiday, but
it's still a roomy, nice club. The
videos in the lobby help, as
does the Japantown Bowling
Alley across the street (open till
4 a.m. Wednesdays and
Thursdays and 24 hours on

weekends).
It you accept the above three
elements — music, rock video
and bowling — as a sort of a
holy trinity of night-on-the
town experiences, then the
Park Bowl on Haight Street
was designed with you in mind.
Located a couple of blocks
away from the I-Beam, one of
the more elaborate dance clubs
on the scene (forget the bands
— the stage is a show in itself),
the Park Bowl is your basic,
well-mannered, direct-from-
Muncie, Indiana, bowling alley
during the week. But on Friday
and Saturday nights, the lights
go down, the volume goes up,
and a 12-foot video screen des
cends and hovers over the cen
ter lanes. It, and satellite TV
sets around the alley, show
rock videos and the like while
the paying customers ($6 cover
charge for entrance and about
two hours of tenpinning) take
their turns at the line and
dance back to their seats.
There's a bar, too, for the ath
letically inclined. As a concept,
the Park Bowl is fascinating; it
inspires the kind of never
there-but-nostalgic-anyway
sigh that you only hear outside
old drive-in hamburger stands
and Broadway revivals.

Moreover, the darn thing
works; it's a lot of fun, and you
very rarely get a chance to
think what a stupid game
bowling is. If nightclubbing is
the art of distraction, the Park
Bowl on Friday and Saturday
nights should he bron/ed.
Don't think of this guide to
nightclubbing as being more
than a series of press-box
tracer shells, however; you're
going to have to make the
rounds yourself. In your
search, you'll probably find
clubs off the beaten path, and
certainly ones not mentioned

here. The North Beach area
has most of the big clubs, for
example, but there's a better
variety of acts south of Market
Street around the China Basin
(where the Giants and the city
want to insert a new domed
baseball stadium, provided
Southern Pacific can be per
suaded not to build an entire
corporate Atlantis on the same
land). The only problem with
this area is that most of the
"clubs" are converted
warehouses, with few comforts
and even fewer ways ot finding
out about performances. If you
can learn your way around
there, you'll be in an "in
crowd" that's so in, no one
knows it's there.
In any case, there are some
relatively hard-and-fast (as
opposed to sof t-and-slow) rules
about finding a particular roost
for your night-owl habits.
Rule No. 1 of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from
following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame
quotient stars usually end up in
stadiums, with high boredom
quotient warm-up acts — you
must remember that
nightclubs depend on
medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high
fame quotient" — the point is
that you ought not wait all year
for your favorite group.
They'll sell out anyway, if they
play in a nightclub, so what
true clubbers ought to do is ex
periment with their ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule No. 2 is not for
a great many people. It re
quires that you admit the exis
tence of a flaw. Yet it is
important, and we should shed
our misconceptions eventually.
So remember this — despite
the popularity of component
stereo systems with multi

colored dials and switches,
most of humanity is unable to
tell a good sound system from
a dixie cup on a string. It fol
lows from that that although
sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider an example. The
Great American Music Hall
on O'Farrell Street has definite
acoustic drawbacks, despite its
habit of featuring high-quality
acoustic musicians. But did vou

ever hear anyone complain
about it? The beautiful gold
leaf interior at the Hall can
sometimes send a trumpet solo
into an ear at a disconcerting
moment. But it simply doesn't
need perfect acoustics, because
there are very few perfect ears.
Those so blessed can find what
they need at nearly every jazz
club. (One of the best, the
Keystone Korner on Vallejo in
North Beach, closed a while
back due to some disagree
ments with the IRS. Its succes

sor seems to be Kimball's on
Grove Street behind ihe Opera
House, which generally books
Bay Area jazz types like Jessica
Williams and joe Henderson
along with national figures.)
Jazz places are frequented by
people who demand near
perfect acoustics — they have it
because they need it, but other
places don't.
So that's rule two, to be
noted especially by rock fans —
it doesn't make much differ

ence if the weak middle range
of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd
you like. There's a world of dif
ference between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and
the rest of mankind as we know
it, for example. You gots to
know which ilk you really enjoy
or else it could destroy an eve
ning.
Rule No. 3 has to do with
ticket prices, but that's usually
in the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule No.
4. And 10, the multitudes were
told not to forget that gasoline
is sometimes required when
return is made to Palo Alto,
and they were told that they
would have to sleep in an alley.
And the multitude adhered to
the commandments of the
golden call of tuition, and
called in advance to find out
the drink minimum.
And finally, over at rule
5, everybody got the Final
Clue. When you choose a club,
and like it, go back. Frequent
the place that treated you like
you wanted to be treated. The
psychological difference be
tween an easy 11) check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don t look 13 can be consider
able, and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn
things around. Never underes
timate the,power of a pleasant
atmosphere, once you've made
up your mind as to your defini
tion of "pleasant."

If you go down Broadway a
few blocks (negotiating your
way past the massage parlors
and Carol Doda) and turn onto
Columbus, you'll eventually
pass Wolfgang's, the physical
successor to the Boarding
House (901 Columbus) and the
spiritual heir to the Old Wal
dorf as Bill Graham's Home
for Acts That Can't Sell Out
the Coliseum. Amazingly
enough, few of the many sins
of the father are visited upon

the latest offspring; the sound
is decent, the stage and lighting
very good, and there's even a
balcony for those who really
don't go to clubs to see the
band. The only caveats to the
clubber are well-known to Wal
dorf denizens: beware the
chairs (bicycle seats with legs),
the drink minimum (the
"Calistoga with Orange Flavor"
tastes like it should have
"Agent'' in there somewhere)
and the food (Chicken Lol
lipops? McPutrid).
Better chairs and bigger
shows can be found at the
other Graham venue, the
Kabuki Nightclub at the Japan
Center near Geary Street. Lo
cated significantly west of
North Beach, the Kabuki
nonetheless has even more
traditional nightclub aes
thetics; it's big and flashy, like
the nightclubs in 1930s musi
cals, with lots of tables for the
Nicholas Brothers to dance
across. It's a little bit odd to see
Greg Kihn play in a place that
should have Billie Holiday, but
it's still a roomy, nice club. The
videos in the lobby help, as
does the Japantown Bowling
Alley across the street (open till
4 a.m. Wednesdays and
Thursdays and 24 hours on

weekends).
It you accept the above three
elements — music, rock video
and bowling — as a sort of a
holy trinity of night-on-the
town experiences, then the
Park Bowl on Haight Street
was designed with you in mind.
Located a couple of blocks
away from the I-Beam, one of
the more elaborate dance clubs
on the scene (forget the bands
— the stage is a show in itself),
the Park Bowl is your basic,
well-mannered, direct-from-
Muncie, Indiana, bowling alley
during the week. But on Friday
and Saturday nights, the lights
go down, the volume goes up,
and a 12-foot video screen des
cends and hovers over the cen
ter lanes. It, and satellite TV
sets around the alley, show
rock videos and the like while
the paying customers ($6 cover
charge for entrance and about
two hours of tenpinning) take
their turns at the line and
dance back to their seats.
There's a bar, too, for the ath
letically inclined. As a concept,
the Park Bowl is fascinating; it
inspires the kind of never
there-but-nostalgic-anyway
sigh that you only hear outside
old drive-in hamburger stands
and Broadway revivals.

Moreover, the darn thing
works; it's a lot of fun, and you
very rarely get a chance to
think what a stupid game
bowling is. If nightclubbing is
the art of distraction, the Park
Bowl on Friday and Saturday
nights should he bron/ed.
Don't think of this guide to
nightclubbing as being more
than a series of press-box
tracer shells, however; you're
going to have to make the
rounds yourself. In your
search, you'll probably find
clubs off the beaten path, and
certainly ones not mentioned

here. The North Beach area
has most of the big clubs, for
example, but there's a better
variety of acts south of Market
Street around the China Basin
(where the Giants and the city
want to insert a new domed
baseball stadium, provided
Southern Pacific can be per
suaded not to build an entire
corporate Atlantis on the same
land). The only problem with
this area is that most of the
"clubs" are converted
warehouses, with few comforts
and even fewer ways ot finding
out about performances. If you
can learn your way around
there, you'll be in an "in
crowd" that's so in, no one
knows it's there.
In any case, there are some
relatively hard-and-fast (as
opposed to sof t-and-slow) rules
about finding a particular roost
for your night-owl habits.
Rule No. 1 of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from
following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame
quotient stars usually end up in
stadiums, with high boredom
quotient warm-up acts — you
must remember that
nightclubs depend on
medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high
fame quotient" — the point is
that you ought not wait all year
for your favorite group.
They'll sell out anyway, if they
play in a nightclub, so what
true clubbers ought to do is ex
periment with their ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule No. 2 is not for
a great many people. It re
quires that you admit the exis
tence of a flaw. Yet it is
important, and we should shed
our misconceptions eventually.
So remember this — despite
the popularity of component
stereo systems with multi

colored dials and switches,
most of humanity is unable to
tell a good sound system from
a dixie cup on a string. It fol
lows from that that although
sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider an example. The
Great American Music Hall
on O'Farrell Street has definite
acoustic drawbacks, despite its
habit of featuring high-quality
acoustic musicians. But did vou

ever hear anyone complain
about it? The beautiful gold
leaf interior at the Hall can
sometimes send a trumpet solo
into an ear at a disconcerting
moment. But it simply doesn't
need perfect acoustics, because
there are very few perfect ears.
Those so blessed can find what
they need at nearly every jazz
club. (One of the best, the
Keystone Korner on Vallejo in
North Beach, closed a while
back due to some disagree
ments with the IRS. Its succes

sor seems to be Kimball's on
Grove Street behind ihe Opera
House, which generally books
Bay Area jazz types like Jessica
Williams and joe Henderson
along with national figures.)
Jazz places are frequented by
people who demand near
perfect acoustics — they have it
because they need it, but other
places don't.
So that's rule two, to be
noted especially by rock fans —
it doesn't make much differ

ence if the weak middle range
of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd
you like. There's a world of dif
ference between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and
the rest of mankind as we know
it, for example. You gots to
know which ilk you really enjoy
or else it could destroy an eve
ning.
Rule No. 3 has to do with
ticket prices, but that's usually
in the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule No.
4. And 10, the multitudes were
told not to forget that gasoline
is sometimes required when
return is made to Palo Alto,
and they were told that they
would have to sleep in an alley.
And the multitude adhered to
the commandments of the
golden call of tuition, and
called in advance to find out
the drink minimum.
And finally, over at rule
5, everybody got the Final
Clue. When you choose a club,
and like it, go back. Frequent
the place that treated you like
you wanted to be treated. The
psychological difference be
tween an easy 11) check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don t look 13 can be consider
able, and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn
things around. Never underes
timate the,power of a pleasant
atmosphere, once you've made
up your mind as to your defini
tion of "pleasant."

Newark has discos.
Cleveland has discos. Omaha
has discos. Even Marriott's
Great America has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accommodating Led
Zeppelin. Seattle has a really
big stadium and they put really
big (and trashy and mindless)
acts like Aerosmith in there.
Los Angeles has two stadiums
capable of accommodating
Aerosmith, if you count
Anaheim (the Rams did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied
quality. Every place also has
Roller Derby rinks and experi
mental theater. Every place has
most everything, if you look
long enough — even the most
branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to
see that this is true. Quality of
performance aside, it just goes
to show that it was a mistake to
leave Kansas in the first place.
Maybe out there you can't get

what you want, but you can get
what you need, so to speak.
Everything except
nightclubs, that is. San Fran
cisco's nightclubs, even more
than Herb Caen and the
Zodiac Killer, distinguish this
city 112 rom every inhabited com
munity outside New York State
lines. The City has both more
nightclubs and more variety
than LA, lor instance, which
holds eight times as many
human beings.
Of course it is very hard to
find one's way around when
one doesn't always know where
to go. It isn't always good to
have a billion zillion nightclubs
if your summer visitor's guide
doesn't at least include a guide
to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks
know about. It's not the
cheapest club, or the biggest,
or the friendliest, or the one
with best sound (Lord, no!).

But it is close, and that means a
lot to a mostly bicycle-bound
audience justifiably uneasy
about traversing the wilds of
San Mateo on a stray Samtrans
7F or facing the Tenderloin
district without an easy escape
route.
But location doth not a
nightclub make, and the
Keystone is not a nightclub, so
don't let anyone tell you differ
ently. A nightclub has enter
tainment, but also gives you an
atmosphere and a chance to
converse. The Keystone Palo
Alto does not exactly fail in
these goals; rather, it blatantly
refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently, the selection
of bands is like that of a small
concert arena — country
bumpkins one night, multi
genarian blues/jazz artists the
next, rapid and rabid lobotomy
rock the next (of both the
heavy metal and punk vari

eties). For the latter, be espe
cially forewarned, for Palo Alto
punk rockers are a singularly
ridiculous bunch. Despite the
kids with skinny ties borrowed
from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks
outside the Keystone dropping
off Skip and Cindy for Punk
Nite Out, the dancing inside
can often resemble a cross be
tween leapfrog and rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always
a good guess in the spontan
eous "let's go to a show" rallies
common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to
go out of your way to create
them, lhen the Mabuhay Gar
dens is waiting for you with
open safety pins. Five or six
years after the fact, punk music
seems to have settled its feud
with (and acknowledged debt
to) heavy metal. Perhaps in

deference to this newly dis
covered patrimony (or perhaps
to the sacred cash cow of the
concertgoing public), punk
clubs often have "metal nights"
and everyday audiences
definitely have more of an
axle-grease aura around them
these days. Which is actually
perfect for the Mabuhay Gar
dens. While the Keystone acts
like a small arena, the Fab Mab
is more like a slightly oversize
garage, with brick walls and a
self-consciously dangerous air
about it. The bands have the
best names in the Bay Area,
though certainly not the tonal
quality. Still thriving as a
Polynesian restaurant by
day/leatherette cave by night,
the club is best for those who
understand the colossal joke
taking place six or seven nights
a week. That's entertainment.
Roosting at the mouth of
Broadway, the Fab Mab also
serves as an introduction to the
North Beach area of the City,
where most of the real
nightclubs (i.e., the ones that
advertise) reside. Right across
the street from the Mab is The
Stone, owned by the same folks
who dispense entertainment at
the Keystone Palo Alto and the
Keystone Berkeley. The Stone
is sort of a hybrid; it has the
physical qualities of its immedi
ate neighbor but the music se
lection of the Keystone, a
decidedly pop flavor (they of
ten share bands, staging the
same show at each 'stone on
successive nights).
If you go down Broadway a
few blocks (negotiating your
way past the massage parlors
and Carol Doda) and turn onto
Columbus, you'll eventually
pass Wolfgang's, the physical
successor to the Boarding
House (901 Columbus) and the
spiritual heir to the Old Wal

the Coliseum. Amazingly

true clubbers ought to do is ex
periment with their ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule No. 2 is not for
a great many people. It re
quires that you admit the exis
tence of a flaw. Yet it is
important, and we should shed
our misconceptions eventually.
So remember this — despite
the popularity of component
stereo systems with multi

colored dials and switches,
most of humanity is unable to
tell a good sound system from
a dixie cup on a string. It fol
lows from that that although
sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider an example. The
Great American Music Hall
on O'Farrell Street has definite
acoustic drawbacks, despite its
habit of featuring high-quality
acoustic musicians. But did vou

ever hear anyone complain
about it? The beautiful gold
leaf interior at the Hall can
sometimes send a trumpet solo
into an ear at a disconcerting
moment. But it simply doesn't
need perfect acoustics, because
there are very few perfect ears.
Those so blessed can find what
they need at nearly every jazz
club. (One of the best, the
Keystone Korner on Vallejo in
North Beach, closed a while
back due to some disagree
ments with the IRS. Its succes

sor seems to be Kimball's on
Grove Street behind ihe Opera
House, which generally books
Bay Area jazz types like Jessica
Williams and joe Henderson
along with national figures.)
Jazz places are frequented by
people who demand near
perfect acoustics — they have it
because they need it, but other
places don't.
So that's rule two, to be
noted especially by rock fans —
it doesn't make much differ

ence if the weak middle range
of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd
you like. There's a world of dif
ference between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and
the rest of mankind as we know
it, for example. You gots to
know which ilk you really enjoy
or else it could destroy an eve
ning.
Rule No. 3 has to do with
ticket prices, but that's usually
in the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule No.
4. And 10, the multitudes were
told not to forget that gasoline
is sometimes required when
return is made to Palo Alto,
and they were told that they
would have to sleep in an alley.
And the multitude adhered to
the commandments of the
golden call of tuition, and
called in advance to find out
the drink minimum.
And finally, over at rule
5, everybody got the Final
Clue. When you choose a club,
and like it, go back. Frequent
the place that treated you like
you wanted to be treated. The
psychological difference be
tween an easy 11) check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don t look 13 can be consider
able, and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn
things around. Never underes
timate the,power of a pleasant
atmosphere, once you've made
up your mind as to your defini
tion of "pleasant."

Newark has discos.
Cleveland has discos. Omaha
has discos. Even Marriott's
Great America has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accommodating Led
Zeppelin. Seattle has a really
big stadium and they put really
big (and trashy and mindless)
acts like Aerosmith in there.
Los Angeles has two stadiums
capable of accommodating
Aerosmith, if you count
Anaheim (the Rams did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied
quality. Every place also has
Roller Derby rinks and experi
mental theater. Every place has
most everything, if you look
long enough — even the most
branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to
see that this is true. Quality of
performance aside, it just goes
to show that it was a mistake to
leave Kansas in the first place.
Maybe out there you can't get

what you want, but you can get
what you need, so to speak.
Everything except
nightclubs, that is. San Fran
cisco's nightclubs, even more
than Herb Caen and the
Zodiac Killer, distinguish this
city 112 rom every inhabited com
munity outside New York State
lines. The City has both more
nightclubs and more variety
than LA, lor instance, which
holds eight times as many
human beings.
Of course it is very hard to
find one's way around when
one doesn't always know where
to go. It isn't always good to
have a billion zillion nightclubs
if your summer visitor's guide
doesn't at least include a guide
to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks
know about. It's not the
cheapest club, or the biggest,
or the friendliest, or the one
with best sound (Lord, no!).

But it is close, and that means a
lot to a mostly bicycle-bound
audience justifiably uneasy
about traversing the wilds of
San Mateo on a stray Samtrans
7F or facing the Tenderloin
district without an easy escape
route.
But location doth not a
nightclub make, and the
Keystone is not a nightclub, so
don't let anyone tell you differ
ently. A nightclub has enter
tainment, but also gives you an
atmosphere and a chance to
converse. The Keystone Palo
Alto does not exactly fail in
these goals; rather, it blatantly
refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently, the selection
of bands is like that of a small
concert arena — country
bumpkins one night, multi
genarian blues/jazz artists the
next, rapid and rabid lobotomy
rock the next (of both the
heavy metal and punk vari

eties). For the latter, be espe
cially forewarned, for Palo Alto
punk rockers are a singularly
ridiculous bunch. Despite the
kids with skinny ties borrowed
from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks
outside the Keystone dropping
off Skip and Cindy for Punk
Nite Out, the dancing inside
can often resemble a cross be
tween leapfrog and rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always
a good guess in the spontan
eous "let's go to a show" rallies
common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to
go out of your way to create
them, lhen the Mabuhay Gar
dens is waiting for you with
open safety pins. Five or six
years after the fact, punk music
seems to have settled its feud
with (and acknowledged debt
to) heavy metal. Perhaps in

deference to this newly dis
covered patrimony (or perhaps
to the sacred cash cow of the
concertgoing public), punk
clubs often have "metal nights"
and everyday audiences
definitely have more of an
axle-grease aura around them
these days. Which is actually
perfect for the Mabuhay Gar
dens. While the Keystone acts
like a small arena, the Fab Mab
is more like a slightly oversize
garage, with brick walls and a
self-consciously dangerous air
about it. The bands have the
best names in the Bay Area,
though certainly not the tonal
quality. Still thriving as a
Polynesian restaurant by
day/leatherette cave by night,
the club is best for those who
understand the colossal joke
taking place six or seven nights
a week. That's entertainment.
Roosting at the mouth of
Broadway, the Fab Mab also
serves as an introduction to the
North Beach area of the City,
where most of the real
nightclubs (i.e., the ones that
advertise) reside. Right across
the street from the Mab is The
Stone, owned by the same folks
who dispense entertainment at
the Keystone Palo Alto and the
Keystone Berkeley. The Stone
is sort of a hybrid; it has the
physical qualities of its immedi
ate neighbor but the music se
lection of the Keystone, a
decidedly pop flavor (they of
ten share bands, staging the
same show at each 'stone on
successive nights).
If you go down Broadway a
few blocks (negotiating your
way past the massage parlors
and Carol Doda) and turn onto
Columbus, you'll eventually
pass Wolfgang's, the physical
successor to the Boarding
House (901 Columbus) and the
spiritual heir to the Old Wal
dorf as Bill Graham's Home
for Acts That Can't Sell Out
the Coliseum. Amazingly
enough, few of the many sins
of the father are visited upon

the latest offspring; the sound
is decent, the stage and lighting
very good, and there's even a
balcony for those who really
don't go to clubs to see the
band. The only caveats to the
clubber are well-known to Wal
dorf denizens: beware the
chairs (bicycle seats with legs),
the drink minimum (the
"Calistoga with Orange Flavor"
tastes like it should have
"Agent'' in there somewhere)
and the food (Chicken Lol
lipops? McPutrid).
Better chairs and bigger
shows can be found at the
other Graham venue, the
Kabuki Nightclub at the Japan
Center near Geary Street. Lo
cated significantly west of
North Beach, the Kabuki
nonetheless has even more
traditional nightclub aes
thetics; it's big and flashy, like
the nightclubs in 1930s musi
cals, with lots of tables for the
Nicholas Brothers to dance
across. It's a little bit odd to see
Greg Kihn play in a place that
should have Billie Holiday, but
it's still a roomy, nice club. The
videos in the lobby help, as
does the Japantown Bowling
Alley across the street (open till
4 a.m. Wednesdays and
Thursdays and 24 hours on

weekends).
It you accept the above three
elements — music, rock video
and bowling — as a sort of a
holy trinity of night-on-the
town experiences, then the
Park Bowl on Haight Street
was designed with you in mind.
Located a couple of blocks
away from the I-Beam, one of
the more elaborate dance clubs
on the scene (forget the bands
— the stage is a show in itself),
the Park Bowl is your basic,
well-mannered, direct-from-
Muncie, Indiana, bowling alley
during the week. But on Friday
and Saturday nights, the lights
go down, the volume goes up,
and a 12-foot video screen des
cends and hovers over the cen
ter lanes. It, and satellite TV
sets around the alley, show
rock videos and the like while
the paying customers ($6 cover
charge for entrance and about
two hours of tenpinning) take
their turns at the line and
dance back to their seats.
There's a bar, too, for the ath
letically inclined. As a concept,
the Park Bowl is fascinating; it
inspires the kind of never
there-but-nostalgic-anyway
sigh that you only hear outside
old drive-in hamburger stands
and Broadway revivals.

Moreover, the darn thing
works; it's a lot of fun, and you
very rarely get a chance to
think what a stupid game
bowling is. If nightclubbing is
the art of distraction, the Park
Bowl on Friday and Saturday
nights should he bron/ed.
Don't think of this guide to
nightclubbing as being more
than a series of press-box
tracer shells, however; you're
going to have to make the
rounds yourself. In your
search, you'll probably find
clubs off the beaten path, and
certainly ones not mentioned

here. The North Beach area
has most of the big clubs, for
example, but there's a better
variety of acts south of Market
Street around the China Basin
(where the Giants and the city
want to insert a new domed
baseball stadium, provided
Southern Pacific can be per
suaded not to build an entire
corporate Atlantis on the same
land). The only problem with
this area is that most of the
"clubs" are converted
warehouses, with few comforts
and even fewer ways ot finding
out about performances. If you
can learn your way around
there, you'll be in an "in
crowd" that's so in, no one
knows it's there.
In any case, there are some
relatively hard-and-fast (as
opposed to sof t-and-slow) rules
about finding a particular roost
for your night-owl habits.
Rule No. 1 of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from
following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame
quotient stars usually end up in
stadiums, with high boredom
quotient warm-up acts — you
must remember that
nightclubs depend on
medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high
fame quotient" — the point is
that you ought not wait all year
for your favorite group.
They'll sell out anyway, if they
play in a nightclub, so what
true clubbers ought to do is ex
periment with their ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule No. 2 is not for
a great many people. It re
quires that you admit the exis
tence of a flaw. Yet it is
important, and we should shed
our misconceptions eventually.
So remember this — despite

colored dials and switches,
most of humanity is unable to

a dixie cup on a string. It fol
lows from that that although

or the friendliest, or the one
with best sound (Lord, no!).

But it is close, and that means a
lot to a mostly bicycle-bound
audience justifiably uneasy
about traversing the wilds of
San Mateo on a stray Samtrans
7F or facing the Tenderloin
district without an easy escape
route.
But location doth not a
nightclub make, and the
Keystone is not a nightclub, so
don't let anyone tell you differ
ently. A nightclub has enter
tainment, but also gives you an
atmosphere and a chance to
converse. The Keystone Palo
Alto does not exactly fail in
these goals; rather, it blatantly
refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently, the selection
of bands is like that of a small
concert arena — country
bumpkins one night, multi
genarian blues/jazz artists the
next, rapid and rabid lobotomy
rock the next (of both the
heavy metal and punk vari

eties). For the latter, be espe
cially forewarned, for Palo Alto
punk rockers are a singularly
ridiculous bunch. Despite the
kids with skinny ties borrowed
from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks
outside the Keystone dropping
off Skip and Cindy for Punk
Nite Out, the dancing inside
can often resemble a cross be
tween leapfrog and rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always
a good guess in the spontan
eous "let's go to a show" rallies
common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to
go out of your way to create
them, lhen the Mabuhay Gar
dens is waiting for you with
open safety pins. Five or six
years after the fact, punk music
seems to have settled its feud
with (and acknowledged debt
to) heavy metal. Perhaps in

deference to this newly dis
covered patrimony (or perhaps
to the sacred cash cow of the
concertgoing public), punk
clubs often have "metal nights"
and everyday audiences
definitely have more of an
axle-grease aura around them
these days. Which is actually
perfect for the Mabuhay Gar
dens. While the Keystone acts
like a small arena, the Fab Mab
is more like a slightly oversize
garage, with brick walls and a
self-consciously dangerous air
about it. The bands have the
best names in the Bay Area,
though certainly not the tonal
quality. Still thriving as a
Polynesian restaurant by
day/leatherette cave by night,
the club is best for those who
understand the colossal joke
taking place six or seven nights
a week. That's entertainment.
Roosting at the mouth of
Broadway, the Fab Mab also
serves as an introduction to the
North Beach area of the City,
where most of the real
nightclubs (i.e., the ones that
advertise) reside. Right across
the street from the Mab is The
Stone, owned by the same folks
who dispense entertainment at
the Keystone Palo Alto and the
Keystone Berkeley. The Stone
is sort of a hybrid; it has the
physical qualities of its immedi
ate neighbor but the music se
lection of the Keystone, a
decidedly pop flavor (they of
ten share bands, staging the
same show at each 'stone on
successive nights).
If you go down Broadway a
few blocks (negotiating your
way past the massage parlors
and Carol Doda) and turn onto
Columbus, you'll eventually
pass Wolfgang's, the physical
successor to the Boarding
House (901 Columbus) and the
spiritual heir to the Old Wal
dorf as Bill Graham's Home
for Acts That Can't Sell Out
the Coliseum. Amazingly
enough, few of the many sins
of the father are visited upon

the latest offspring; the sound
is decent, the stage and lighting
very good, and there's even a
balcony for those who really
don't go to clubs to see the
band. The only caveats to the
clubber are well-known to Wal
dorf denizens: beware the
chairs (bicycle seats with legs),
the drink minimum (the
"Calistoga with Orange Flavor"
tastes like it should have
"Agent'' in there somewhere)
and the food (Chicken Lol
lipops? McPutrid).
Better chairs and bigger
shows can be found at the
other Graham venue, the
Kabuki Nightclub at the Japan
Center near Geary Street. Lo
cated significantly west of
North Beach, the Kabuki
nonetheless has even more
traditional nightclub aes
thetics; it's big and flashy, like
the nightclubs in 1930s musi
cals, with lots of tables for the
Nicholas Brothers to dance
across. It's a little bit odd to see
Greg Kihn play in a place that
should have Billie Holiday, but
it's still a roomy, nice club. The
videos in the lobby help, as
does the Japantown Bowling
Alley across the street (open till
4 a.m. Wednesdays and
Thursdays and 24 hours on

weekends).
It you accept the above three
elements — music, rock video
and bowling — as a sort of a
holy trinity of night-on-the
town experiences, then the
Park Bowl on Haight Street
was designed with you in mind.
Located a couple of blocks
away from the I-Beam, one of
the more elaborate dance clubs
on the scene (forget the bands
— the stage is a show in itself),
the Park Bowl is your basic,
well-mannered, direct-from-
Muncie, Indiana, bowling alley
during the week. But on Friday
and Saturday nights, the lights
go down, the volume goes up,
and a 12-foot video screen des
cends and hovers over the cen
ter lanes. It, and satellite TV
sets around the alley, show
rock videos and the like while
the paying customers ($6 cover
charge for entrance and about
two hours of tenpinning) take
their turns at the line and
dance back to their seats.
There's a bar, too, for the ath
letically inclined. As a concept,
the Park Bowl is fascinating; it
inspires the kind of never
there-but-nostalgic-anyway
sigh that you only hear outside
old drive-in hamburger stands
and Broadway revivals.

Moreover, the darn thing
works; it's a lot of fun, and you
very rarely get a chance to
think what a stupid game
bowling is. If nightclubbing is
the art of distraction, the Park
Bowl on Friday and Saturday
nights should he bron/ed.
Don't think of this guide to
nightclubbing as being more
than a series of press-box
tracer shells, however; you're
going to have to make the
rounds yourself. In your
search, you'll probably find
clubs off the beaten path, and
certainly ones not mentioned

here. The North Beach area
has most of the big clubs, for
example, but there's a better
variety of acts south of Market
Street around the China Basin
(where the Giants and the city
want to insert a new domed
baseball stadium, provided
Southern Pacific can be per
suaded not to build an entire
corporate Atlantis on the same
land). The only problem with
this area is that most of the
"clubs" are converted
warehouses, with few comforts
and even fewer ways ot finding
out about performances. If you
can learn your way around
there, you'll be in an "in
crowd" that's so in, no one
knows it's there.
In any case, there are some
relatively hard-and-fast (as
opposed to sof t-and-slow) rules
about finding a particular roost
for your night-owl habits.
Rule No. 1 of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from
following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame
quotient stars usually end up in
stadiums, with high boredom
quotient warm-up acts — you
must remember that
nightclubs depend on
medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high
fame quotient" — the point is
that you ought not wait all year
for your favorite group.
They'll sell out anyway, if they
play in a nightclub, so what
true clubbers ought to do is ex
periment with their ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule No. 2 is not for
a great many people. It re
quires that you admit the exis
tence of a flaw. Yet it is
important, and we should shed
our misconceptions eventually.
So remember this — despite
the popularity of component
stereo systems with multi

colored dials and switches,
most of humanity is unable to
tell a good sound system from
a dixie cup on a string. It fol
lows from that that although
sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider an example. The
Great American Music Hall
on O'Farrell Street has definite
acoustic drawbacks, despite its
habit of featuring high-quality
acoustic musicians. But did vou

ever hear anyone complain
about it? The beautiful gold
leaf interior at the Hall can
sometimes send a trumpet solo
into an ear at a disconcerting
moment. But it simply doesn't
need perfect acoustics, because
there are very few perfect ears.
Those so blessed can find what
they need at nearly every jazz
club. (One of the best, the
Keystone Korner on Vallejo in
North Beach, closed a while
back due to some disagree
ments with the IRS. Its succes

sor seems to be Kimball's on
Grove Street behind ihe Opera
House, which generally books
Bay Area jazz types like Jessica
Williams and joe Henderson
along with national figures.)
Jazz places are frequented by
people who demand near
perfect acoustics — they have it
because they need it, but other
places don't.
So that's rule two, to be
noted especially by rock fans —
it doesn't make much differ

ence if the weak middle range
of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd
you like. There's a world of dif
ference between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and
the rest of mankind as we know
it, for example. You gots to
know which ilk you really enjoy
or else it could destroy an eve
ning.
Rule No. 3 has to do with
ticket prices, but that's usually
in the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule No.
4. And 10, the multitudes were
told not to forget that gasoline
is sometimes required when
return is made to Palo Alto,
and they were told that they
would have to sleep in an alley.
And the multitude adhered to
the commandments of the
golden call of tuition, and
called in advance to find out
the drink minimum.
And finally, over at rule
5, everybody got the Final
Clue. When you choose a club,
and like it, go back. Frequent
the place that treated you like
you wanted to be treated. The
psychological difference be
tween an easy 11) check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don t look 13 can be consider
able, and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn
things around. Never underes
timate the,power of a pleasant
atmosphere, once you've made
up your mind as to your defini
tion of "pleasant."
