# Where to go when the Bay Area lights up

### 
Newark has discos.
Cleveland has discos. Omaha
has discos. Even Marriott's
Great America has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accommodating Led
Zeppelin. Seattle has a really
big stadium and they put really
big (and trashy and mindless)
acts like Aerosmith in there.
Los Angeles has two stadiums
capable of accommodating
Aerosmith, if you count
Anaheim (the Rams did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied
quality. Every place also has
Roller Derby rinks and experi
mental theater. Every place has
most everything, if you look
long enough — even the most
branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to
see that this is true. Quality of
performance aside, it just goes
to show that it was a mistake to
leave Kansas in the first place.
Maybe out there you can't get

what you want, but you can get
what you need, so to speak.
Everything except
nightclubs, that is. San Fran
cisco's nightclubs, even more
than Herb Caen and the
Zodiac Killer, distinguish this
city 112 rom every inhabited com
munity outside New York State
lines. The City has both more
nightclubs and more variety
than LA, lor instance, which
holds eight times as many
human beings.
Of course it is very hard to
find one's way around when
one doesn't always know where
to go. It isn't always good to
have a billion zillion nightclubs
if your summer visitor's guide
doesn't at least include a guide
to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks
know about. It's not the
cheapest club, or the biggest,
or the friendliest, or the one
with best sound (Lord, no!).

But it is close, and that means a
lot to a mostly bicycle-bound
audience justifiably uneasy
about traversing the wilds of
San Mateo on a stray Samtrans
7F or facing the Tenderloin
district without an easy escape
route.
But location doth not a
nightclub make, and the
Keystone is not a nightclub, so
don't let anyone tell you differ
ently. A nightclub has enter
tainment, but also gives you an
atmosphere and a chance to
converse. The Keystone Palo
Alto does not exactly fail in
these goals; rather, it blatantly
refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently, the selection
of bands is like that of a small
concert arena — country
bumpkins one night, multi
genarian blues/jazz artists the
next, rapid and rabid lobotomy
rock the next (of both the
heavy metal and punk vari

eties). For the latter, be espe
cially forewarned, for Palo Alto
punk rockers are a singularly
ridiculous bunch. Despite the
kids with skinny ties borrowed
from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks
outside the Keystone dropping
off Skip and Cindy for Punk
Nite Out, the dancing inside
can often resemble a cross be
tween leapfrog and rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always
a good guess in the spontan
eous "let's go to a show" rallies
common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to
go out of your way to create
them, lhen the Mabuhay Gar
dens is waiting for you with
open safety pins. Five or six
years after the fact, punk music
seems to have settled its feud
with (and acknowledged debt
to) heavy metal. Perhaps in

deference to this newly dis
covered patrimony (or perhaps
to the sacred cash cow of the
concertgoing public), punk
clubs often have "metal nights"
and everyday audiences
definitely have more of an
axle-grease aura around them
these days. Which is actually
perfect for the Mabuhay Gar
dens. While the Keystone acts
like a small arena, the Fab Mab
is more like a slightly oversize
garage, with brick walls and a
self-consciously dangerous air
about it. The bands have the
best names in the Bay Area,
though certainly not the tonal
quality. Still thriving as a
Polynesian restaurant by
day/leatherette cave by night,
the club is best for those who
understand the colossal joke
taking place six or seven nights
a week. That's entertainment.
