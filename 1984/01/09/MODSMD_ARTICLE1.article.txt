# Dean Fred closes his Stanford file

After 15 years, almost 200,000 applications and
about 20,000 "Greats" since coming to Stan
ford, Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon will
leave in September to become senior vice presi
dent of the College Board.
Although Hargadon said he is "riot tired" of
playing both Santa Claus and the Clinch Who
Stole Christmas to thousands of high school
seniors each year, he is ready to try something
different.
"Had this opportunity not presented itself, I
would happily be staying," the dean of admis
sions said. "But it will be 15 years this Septem
ber, so I think it will just be interesting to try
something new. And, you know, living in New
York City, that will be interesting.'
Hargadon was characteristically vague about
the duties he will assume at the College Board,
the organization responsible for advising the
Educational Testing Service on the SAT and Ad
vanced Placement examinations and administer
ing the College Scholarship Service.
"I'll be the senior vice president for adminis
tration of the College Board, which involves

everything I guess you'd think being a senior
vice president would involve, from budget and
so forth on down," explained the 49-year-old
Haverford graduate who claims he wouldn't
have admitted himself to Stanford.
Although the move from Palo Alto to New
York City "really will be" a change for Har
gadon, the move from Stanford to the College
Board will be less drastic, he said, because of his
previous work with the organization.
"I've been a trustee for 12 years. I was chair
man of the trustees for four years," Hargadon
explained. "So I'm familiar with it, so it's not
really a drastic change as if I were going in not
knowing what it's about and so forth."
As dean of admissions, Hargadon has been an
outspoken opponent of the weight given stan
dardized test scores in formula-based admis
sions programs used by some schools, includ
ing the University of California system. And he
says working for the organization which spon
sors those tests won't keep him from speaking
out in the future.
"I don't think excessive reliance ought to be
put on any one element, and some (universities)

put too much emphasis, I think, simply on
grade point average, some put too much em
phasis on test scores, some put too much em
phasis on other aspects, too: whether a person
has a good handshake or a big smile," Har
gadon said.
Shortly after College Board President George
Hanford announced Hargadon's appointment
late last month, University President Donald
Kennedy told the Stanford News Service that
Hargadon "has been not only a superb dean of
admissions, he has been an influential and
valuable person in the lives o! thousands of
Stanford students.
"I'm glad he'll have a chance to bring these
qualities to the making of national policy in ad
missions and financial aid," Kennedy said. "But
as far as Stanford is concerned, he is simply ir
replaceable."
However, the University is moving ahead with
plans to replace Hargadon as dean of admis
sions. A small faculty study group chaired by En
glish Prof. Nancy Packer has been formed to
"think about the definition of the job and then
