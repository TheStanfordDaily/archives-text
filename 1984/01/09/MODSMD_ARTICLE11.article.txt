# Hospital fires 4 after arrests
## 
### 
Four employees of Stanford University
Hospital were discharged from their jobs in
mid-December after an internal investiga
tion prompted by their arrests on drug
related charges.
Another arrested worker, David Cannon,
was suspended for 10 days, and a sixth em
ployee, Randall Creamier, was reinstated
with back pay.
All six had been arrested Nov. 18 and ter
minated from the hospital the same day.
Those discharged after the investigation
were Kirk Williams, a pharmacy technician,
Rommel Day, a food service worker, Craig
Julien, a linen assistant, and Michael Robin
son, a mail room clerk.
Creamier, Day, Julien and Robinson were
charged with selling or offering to sell
cocaine.
Cannon, a pharmacy technician, was ar
rested for allegedly selling controlled sub
stances, including codeine, Talwin and

Valium, while Williams was charged with
possession of stolen property and sale of
controlled substances.
The internal investigation was conducted
"from an employment context," said Carole
Price, associate administrator at the hospi
tal. That context is more stringent than a le
gal one, she said, because "for a criminal
conviction the standard of proof is beyond a
reasonable doubt," but to discharge an em
ployee "you don't have to have that high a
standard."
Price said it is unlikely that the hospital
would reinstate any of the terminated
employees if they are found not guilty by the
courts because "sometimes the police may
commit a technicality . . . and (the arrestee)
can get off on that."
The six arrests took place after a five
month investigation by the Palo Alto police
department which had received a tip from a
hospital worker.
