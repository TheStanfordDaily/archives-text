# Tuition, book sales mean big bucks
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
It's an unavoidable event
that happens three times a
year. Those dreaded days of
registration when students,
writing checks with numbers
that barely fit on the line
marked "payment," pass the
bucks to the University.
Today, the University will
take in checks and other
registration payments totalling
approximately $8 million,
cording to University cash
manager Donald Price. And
Bookstore text sales, if equiva
lent to fall quarter figures,
could be more than $200,000
for registration and each of
the first two days of classes.
Payments today are down
from the $17 million mark
reached during fall quarter
due in principle to payments
made during pre-registration
during December, Price said.
Tuition this quarter is $3300,
while the cost of undergradu
ate housing ranges for $518 to
$654 depending on location,
according to Joseph jedd, Uni
versity bursar. Food service
costs range from $679 for 19
meals a week to $506 for the
10-meal plan, he said.
All checks received from

students should be cleared
within three days of registra
tion, Price said, with this
money going into a "central
depository account" at Wells
Fargo.
Once the money from
registration reaches this "pot"
account, it "loses its identity"
from other incoming money ,
Price said. This account in
cludes money from the Stan
ford Hospital room fees, reim
bursements from government
sponsored research and reve
nue from interest and ac
counts which have matured.
Tuition money is valuable,
according to Price, because it

O
is "not restricted" and may be
used to meet University oper
ating costs. The University has
approximately $250 million in
expendable funds at the mo
ment, he said.
Surplus money on any day,
including registration is either
invested in long- or short-term
securities or placed in a
money market fund at the dis
cretion of the University Trea
surer's office, Price said.
While Bookstore manager
Eldon Speed could not be sure
how much money would be
taken in today, he said that "if
every student comes back on
the eighth, the ninth will be a

very busy day."
Speed said that heavy sales
of course books "last for
about a week," noting that on
the first day of last quarter the
Bookstore sold $220,000 oi
books and that figure in
creased to $240,000 the next
day. On an average day, the
Bookstore takes in between
$30,000 and $.35,000.
Used books account for less
than 10 percent of course
book sales, Speed said, add
ing that the sale of souvenirs
and shirts during the rush is
"practically negligible" and
increased during "game peri
ods and holidays."
