# Cardiac study uncovers new findings

A 10-year research project conducted
by Stanford's Cardiac Rehabilitation Pro
gram has uncovered some interesting
patterns in recovery and relapse for heart
attack victims.
According to Dr. Robert DeBusk, direc
tor of the rehabilitation program, the
study showed that it is better for patients
of heart attacks to return to work quickly

than to undergo a long recuperation per
iod. Heart attack victims who returned to
work soon after experiencing the trauma
had a substantially lower risk of suffering
another heart attack within one year.
The findings may now eliminate the
guesswork previously involved in deter
mining a patient's chances after suffering
a major attack.
The research was compiled using exer
cise as a testing medium. This technique
allowed the researchers to pinpoint dif

ferences between high-risk and low-risk
patients.
The new study will benefit doctors who
must instruct patients on living and health
habits after a first heart attack. According
to DeBusk, the doctors no longer have to
give their patients vague instructions on
recovery.
The findings will allow patients to know
what their chances for survival are, what
their capacities are and how they can live
in the post-attack period.
