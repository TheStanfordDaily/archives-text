## The 						Stanford Daily Not so great! 
### 
There is no doubt about it: ¥ The man is an
institution.
For Stanford undergraduates it all starts with
one simple word — Great! And the rest of the
University community has plenty of evidence
of its existence.
His carefree personality seems to be the root
of it all. There's the basic wit, the apparent abil
ity to know the name of every undergraduate
on campus, the feet propped up on the desk,
the pipe slanting out from between the lips,
the slightly beat-up 1968 green convertible
Mustang bearing the license plates "ADMITS."
The institution rests on these aspects, which
are meaningless separately, but all-powerful in

their entirety.
That this man, this myth, has accepted a job
with the College Board is, in a single, simple
word, sad.
Next year's high school seniors may feel just
as good about their approach to Stanford even
if they don't have that special word in blue ink
at the bottom of the letter from the dean of ad
missions.
But they will be cheated. Maybe worst of all,
they won't see the best tradition in Gaieties,
when the institution proves his greatness by
showing that he can dance and sing too.
The show will go on, but it won't be the
same.
