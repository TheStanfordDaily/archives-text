# Trustees reject White House plan for complex
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
In a unanimous vote, the Board of
Trustees last month affirmed that
the University would welcome a
Ronald Reagan presidential complex
on campus if the proposed public
affairs center was "organizationally
within the normal academic
structure of the University."
The Dec. 13 action, an implicit
rejection of the White House
backed plan to give the semi
autonomous Hoover Institution au
thority over the center, was immedi
ately criticized bv Presidential Coun
selor Edwin Meese, who said it was
"not a satisfactory position" as far as
the president is concerned.
The vote was a strong endorse
ment of the position taken by Board
President William Kimball and Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy

and backed unanimously by the Fac
ulty Senate: that while a presidential
complex would be a welcome addi
tion to the University, it would be
acceptable only if the policy center
was governed by the University.
In a news conference after the
Board meeting, Kennedy expressed
hope that the decision might
"reduce the impasse" with the
White House, although he said
there was "no indication" the White
House would move away from its in
sistence on a Hoover-run center.
After speaking by phone to
Meese, however, Kennedy issued a
further statement: "We expressed
hope that the Board's firm affirma
tion might change his view. Ap
parently it has not."
The warmly worded Board resolu
tion says Stanford "acknowledges
with appreciation the interest of

President and Mrs. Reagan in a pro
posal to locate a presidential library
complex at Stanford," and that the
University is honored by this inter
est.
It goes on to authorize the presi
dent of the University to make a pro
posal to the president of the United
States to locate his archives at a li
brary with incorporated museum
facilities and for a University-run
Reagan center for public affairs on
the same site.
Trustee Frank Tatum described
the resolution as a "definitive pro
posal" from the University. He em
phasized the Board felt it was impor
tant to go "formally on record" in
stead of continuing informal com
munications.
Sources close to the Board, who
spoke on the condition that they not
be identified, said that Meese, at a

White House meeting with Stanford
officials Dec. 7, had asked that the
Board not vote on the resolution. It
reiterated a proposal Meese had
already described in a letter to Kim
ball as "tantamount to making the
president 'an offer he cannot ac
cept.' "
The Board decided to state its po
sition anyway, the sources said,
partly out of concern that Stanford
might be perceived by conservative
donors as the party that is keeping
the Reagan complex from coming to
Stanford.
The issue of governance of the
policy center has long been the
most formidable stumbling block
confronting those trying to bring the
Reagan complex to Stanford.
