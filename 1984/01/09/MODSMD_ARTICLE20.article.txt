# Home for the holidays: the story of a pathetic poodle
## 
### 
Being home tor the holidays is wonder
ful. It gives you the chance to take part in
the small drama that domestic life is,
playing roles you often leave behind at
school: son, sister, ex-boyfriend,
granddaughter. The raw material for a mas
terful play is all there: the fine tension of
love between parents and children, the hid
den high drama of sibling rivalry, the warm
feeling you get from being with old and
good friends. Intricate twists of fate or
genes make you know one person and love
another. Brown, bare trees against a grey
sky, pine needles fallen on a wooden floor,
and champagne glasses raised in a toast are,
among others, the setting.

Old folks telling tales from another time
show you that life can be viewed in this
way; that is, as a string of happy, im
promptu sketches turned into anecdotes
with telling and the passage of time. My
Grandma K tells great stories: stories that
make our own times seem too complex;
stories that make us laugh not because of
their exotic locations or subtle plots, but
because of their simple characters and the
honest human joy within them. She tells
stories, most of all, that give the listener a
sense of history and of humanity.
Being at home for the holidays can leave
you with a story or two to tell yourself. My
own concerns a small, lost poodle. My broth

ers found him outside our house in the
snow one night. The poor thing was shiver
ing with cold. Its eyes were glazed over
with cataracts and a large patch of fur had
been shaven from both its head and its
back. When he walked, it was with both
hind feet dragging.
We took pity on the pathetic creature and
put him in the garage. We reasoned that if
he had survived the freezing cold outside,
he could survive the garage, which was a
little warmer. Dad didn't want the thing
inside at all; he was afraid our own dog
might catch some bizarre disease from the
poodle. We convinced him to take the
thing in, though, saying we would call the

dog pound the next day. Then we went out.
The next morning, we found the poodle
in the back hall bathroom. It turns out dad
had decided to put him in there because he
felt the garage might be too cold for the
thing after all. And my mom gave him a
bowl of raw quiche for breakfast. Needless
to say, this was not a Real Dog: He ate it
right up. Otherwise, he uttered small but
truly heart-rending whimpers. He seemed
sad.
When the lady from the dog pound fi
nally came to get the creature that after
noon, she was late and apologetic. She
seemed like a small animal herself: slight of

jaw, nervous, twittery. And very sweet. She
took the shaven beast away with her, and
left us glad we had done it a good turn.
The episode brought home a message to
me: Look always for the unusual in the or
dinary, the dramatic in the domestic, the
short story or novel in everyday life. And
more importantly, it brought home the real
story of the holidays: That caring and
giving, even if only for a forlorn, half-shorn
poodle, are the two most important things
we can do.
