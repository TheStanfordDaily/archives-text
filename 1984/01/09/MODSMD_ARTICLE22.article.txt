# Viewpoint: Todd Fredrickson
## Retain the football program, keep the campus social life 
### 
I feel compelled to respond to David Lempert's
"Viewpoint" decrying the emphasis on football at Stan
ford (Daily, Dec. 2), which was off the mark on several
counts.
For starters, he greatly exaggerated the physical risks
involved in playing football. Few players — certainly
not a majority — suffer "debilitating" injuries, and I'll
wager any sum that no member of this year's team will
be a "cripple" in 20 years because of football injuries.
As for clogged arteries and excess weight, does Lem
pert really think the average guy in the street is in
anywhere near the overall physical condition of a col
lege football player?

Stanford football is a way of life
because a large number of
alumni and students want it to
be. The reason "the University
immediately tries to sell season
tickets to every freshman and
returning enrollee" is because
thousands want to buy them.

More central to his argument, though, is the belief
that too much of the social life at Stanford is structured
around football. Here too, however, he overstates the
case. Only for the UC-Berkeley and USC games do
"rallies, Band performances, Gaieties and trips to away
games start to stretch back to Thursdays and Fridays
and ahead irto Sundays." His conclusion that

"newcomers to Stanford learn in their first few
weekends that weekends are not to be used
productively" is absurd and deserves no further com
ment.
Nonetheless, it is true that football is the major social
event of the fall. Lempert seems to think this is because
of some University emphasis. That is simply wrong.
Stanford football is a way of life because a large number
of alumni and students want it to be. The reason "the
University immediately tries to sell season tickets to
every freshman and returning enrollee" is because
thousands — yes, thousands — want to buy them.
As I see it, the only thing the University could do to
change this would be to lower the level of play by elim
inating scholarships and/or dropping out of the Pac-10.
This would be a disaster not only for the football team
but for the entire athletic program which depends on
football dollars for support.
It would also be a disaster for the campus social life
and spirit Lempert is admirably concerned about. The
fact that Stanford goes nuts over football and that so
much of its social life ties into it is not a reflection of
Stanford. It's a reflection of the way things are in this
country.
And as long as people get excited and party and road
trip and have fun with each other for football's sake, so
be it. I can't imagine what Lempert could have against
that except for his claim that it reinforces a tradition of
drinking. This may very well be true, but I doubt that
the degree to which it does so above and beyond the
natural college atmosphere is significant.
You don't have to like football to benefit from the life
it brings to campus, and Lempert and other critics
would have to go a long way, or perhaps only as far as
basketball, to find something that for better or worse
can do as much for the overall enthusiasm of an Ameri
can college as does football.
