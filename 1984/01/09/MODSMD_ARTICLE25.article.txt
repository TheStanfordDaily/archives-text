LAC services
I am writing to support your very
thoughtful editorial, "Preserve LAC
services," (Daily, Nov. 23), and to
reassure students that those
services are indeed being
preserved.
The decision made two weeks
ago will establish new administra
tive arrangements for the courses
and services that have in recent
years been offered by the Learning
Assistance Center. It will not
however, lessen the availability,
accessibility, or visibility of learning
assistance: Courses in learning
skills and tutorial assistance will
continue to be dispensed from the
same location in Meyer Library
where undergraduates have been
accustomed to finding them.
The administrative absorption of
the LAC into the Center for Teach
ing and Learning (CTL) will offer
two significant benefits to our un
dergraduate program. First, a newly
established faculty board for the
consolidated Center will take a
broad look at learning assistance

needs in the University and help
tailor offerings more effectively to
those needs. Second, placing learn
ing assistance services in the same
agency with teacher training, which
CTL has done for many years, will
permit us to develop a unified and
comprehensive approach to
courses where problems in effec
tiveness might arise: working si
multaneously with the professors
and TAs who teach, with the stu
dents who learn, and with the
tutors who assist.
"When the academic going gets
rough," students will still have a
highly visible, easily accessible
campus facility to which they can
turn. The learning assistance pro
gram will receive TLC under CTL.

Rise in cheating
Your editorial "Is it really worth
it," (Daily, Dec. 1) did a service to
the campus by reminding us of the
issues of preprofessionalism and
cheating. While "political uncer
tainties and personal anxieties"
may play some roles in fostering
those practices, I cannot buy the
assertion that they are the "primary
causes." There exists no period in
human history when people have
not cheated, and political uncer
tainty and economic distress are
nothing new either. (I am curious
whether students' cheating in
creased during the Great Depres
sion and then receded afterwards.
And whether the end of World War
II caused a reduction in cheating. I
suggest the answer is
"insignificantly" in both cases.)
It's also interesting that research
not long ago by the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs revealed
little or no increase in cheating.
Regardless of contradictory
evidence, however, we are hiding
our heads in the sand if we do not
recognize that most of any increase
in cheating reflects very broadly
based societal trends. In virtually
every arena, individuals feel less
constrained by common societal

bonds and practices — and more
and more willing to decide for
themselves, often with remarkable
impunity, when it is convenient and
"neccessary" for laws, mores and
mutual agreements to apply to
them. In short, we are plagued by
much more than the "uncertainty
of world affairs."

Year of the Bible
President Reagan signed a
proclamation that 1983 was to be
the "Year of the Bible" and a law
suit was filed against it (April 21) in
the city of Los Angeles, on the basis
of separation of church and state.
The U.S Supreme Court outlawed
school prayer on this same premise
and recently deliberated whether
Nativity scenes can be displayed on
public property.
The Supreme Court was formed
to interpret the application of our
Constitution, but nowhere in the
Constitution is any mention made
of separation of church and state
(incidentally, it is spelled out quite
clearly in the Constitution of the
Soviet Union). Where did this con
cept originate in this country? It
apparently came from a letter writ
ten by Thomas Jefferson in which
he was voicing concern about
protecting the church from the
state — not vice versa!
If we truly believe in the separa
tion of church and state, then we
had better clean up our act. Let's
strike down our national motto, "In
God We Trust," because it is a
flagrant violation for our govern
ment to endorse any belief in God.
What right does our government
have to require that court tes
timonies be sworn in the name of
God and oaths of public office be
sworn on the Holy Bible?
Those among you, who do not
wish to see "separation of church
and state" carried to such
ridiculous extremes, need to
reverse the pendulum by organiz
ing to take action now. We must
demand freedom "of" religion —
not freedom "from" religion.

LAC services
I am writing to support your very
thoughtful editorial, "Preserve LAC
services," (Daily, Nov. 23), and to
reassure students that those
services are indeed being
preserved.
The decision made two weeks
ago will establish new administra
tive arrangements for the courses
and services that have in recent
years been offered by the Learning
Assistance Center. It will not
however, lessen the availability,
accessibility, or visibility of learning
assistance: Courses in learning
skills and tutorial assistance will
continue to be dispensed from the
same location in Meyer Library
where undergraduates have been
accustomed to finding them.
The administrative absorption of
the LAC into the Center for Teach
ing and Learning (CTL) will offer
two significant benefits to our un
dergraduate program. First, a newly
established faculty board for the
consolidated Center will take a
broad look at learning assistance

needs in the University and help
tailor offerings more effectively to
those needs. Second, placing learn
ing assistance services in the same
agency with teacher training, which
CTL has done for many years, will
permit us to develop a unified and
comprehensive approach to
courses where problems in effec
tiveness might arise: working si
multaneously with the professors
and TAs who teach, with the stu
dents who learn, and with the
tutors who assist.
"When the academic going gets
rough," students will still have a
highly visible, easily accessible
campus facility to which they can
turn. The learning assistance pro
gram will receive TLC under CTL.

Rise in cheating
Your editorial "Is it really worth
it," (Daily, Dec. 1) did a service to
the campus by reminding us of the
issues of preprofessionalism and
cheating. While "political uncer
tainties and personal anxieties"
may play some roles in fostering
those practices, I cannot buy the
assertion that they are the "primary
causes." There exists no period in
human history when people have
not cheated, and political uncer
tainty and economic distress are
nothing new either. (I am curious
whether students' cheating in
creased during the Great Depres
sion and then receded afterwards.
And whether the end of World War
II caused a reduction in cheating. I
suggest the answer is
"insignificantly" in both cases.)
It's also interesting that research
not long ago by the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs revealed
little or no increase in cheating.
Regardless of contradictory
evidence, however, we are hiding
our heads in the sand if we do not
recognize that most of any increase
in cheating reflects very broadly
based societal trends. In virtually
every arena, individuals feel less
constrained by common societal

bonds and practices — and more
and more willing to decide for
themselves, often with remarkable
impunity, when it is convenient and
"neccessary" for laws, mores and
mutual agreements to apply to
them. In short, we are plagued by
much more than the "uncertainty
of world affairs."

Year of the Bible
President Reagan signed a
proclamation that 1983 was to be
the "Year of the Bible" and a law
suit was filed against it (April 21) in
the city of Los Angeles, on the basis
of separation of church and state.
The U.S Supreme Court outlawed
school prayer on this same premise
and recently deliberated whether
Nativity scenes can be displayed on
public property.
The Supreme Court was formed
to interpret the application of our
Constitution, but nowhere in the
Constitution is any mention made
of separation of church and state
(incidentally, it is spelled out quite
clearly in the Constitution of the
Soviet Union). Where did this con
cept originate in this country? It
apparently came from a letter writ
ten by Thomas Jefferson in which
he was voicing concern about
protecting the church from the
state — not vice versa!
If we truly believe in the separa
tion of church and state, then we
had better clean up our act. Let's
strike down our national motto, "In
God We Trust," because it is a
flagrant violation for our govern
ment to endorse any belief in God.
What right does our government
have to require that court tes
timonies be sworn in the name of
God and oaths of public office be
sworn on the Holy Bible?
Those among you, who do not
wish to see "separation of church
and state" carried to such
ridiculous extremes, need to
reverse the pendulum by organiz
ing to take action now. We must
demand freedom "of" religion —
not freedom "from" religion.
