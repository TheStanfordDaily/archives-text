# Professor's Commentary: David Wellbery
## Does anybody know what time it is? Does anybody really care?

David Wellberry is a profes
sor of German studies and a
resident fellow at Roble.
What time is it?
Hard to imagine a question
simpler to answer. We're all
equipped with digital
chronometers, we all hear, as
we wander across the campus
(in pursuit of a thought per
haps?), bell-conveyed reports
that another quarter hour has
passed. And, as if this weren't
enough, beginnings and ends
of Stanford classes are sig
nalled (or commanded?) by an
obnoxious sound in which I
for one detect an echo of
machine-gun fire. We know —
incessantly — what time it is.
At least in the sense of
clock-time, in the sense of
parcelled, managed, econ
omized time.
But what if we ask the ques
tion in a more general way?
What if it means: What time is
it in our lives, individual and
collective? How far have we
come? How low have we fal

len? Then our watches don't
help us; nor do — at least not
adequately — the tons of
graphs and diagrams which
our society produces (and
which it must produce to
manage itself), gauging our
productivity, our birth rates,
our income levels, our heart
beats, our moral infringe
ments. The fact is, we have no
ready instruments with which
to take our own measure.
But clearly this must be
done. We must apprehend
ourselves not merely in terms
of an infinitely extended,
depthless line, but rather in
terms of that complex and
fractured dimensionality
which is our life with one an
other and with the world
around us. We must take our
measure in an aesthetic, ethi
cal and (perhaps even still) re
ligious sense (and I don't
mean to imply that these can
be rigorously separated).
One place this labor of self
apprehension gets done is art.

Art is an arena of discussion in
which we work out, as artists
and interpreters, the problem
of self-measure. I was in New
York recently, Museum of
Modern Art, exhibition of
prints by the contemporary

Where is there a visible ef
fort to measure ourselves as
individuals, as a university,
as a society? The sad truth
is, of course, that there
exists no such concerted
effort here.

Swiss artist Rolf Iseli.
One print in particular
caught my eye and imagina
tion; it was called "Der Hor-

cher" ("The Eavesdropper").
My suggestion is this: If we
could transport every Stanford
student to this picture, and if
we could guarantee that,
standing before it, she/he
would absorb that image into

her/his life, allowing it to
resonate with all the other
images our culture surrounds
us with, constructing and

reconstructing this, we would
accomplish more (there's the
question of measure again) for
those students' education,
than we normally do in an
entire quarter.
Head and shoulders neatly
outlined, head turned away so
the figure (male, by the way)
has no physiognomy. He
doesn't see, but just listens;
his entire being — and the
slight twist and strain of the
body shows this — is taken up
in this one activity: listening.
Hungry for information, he is
"all ears." Strange passion
that animates the eavesdrop
per, that holds him at the
door, captivated: the desire to
hear everything, the fear that
even a single word (it might be
just the one I am longing for
or the one I most fear!) could
slip unnoticed into oblivion.
But in Iseli's print all these
words which the eavesdrop
per so eagerly absorbs are not
heard without cost.
Thousands of fine lines, like

the thinnest of wires, con
verge on the head of the
eavesdropper, bringing so
much energy, so much jagged
intensity into the picture that
the clean contours of the head
seem no longer able to con
tain the cacaphony of informa
tion which the insatiable
eavesdropper has taken in.
The figure's head — and this
is the moment the artist has
fixed on as our time — is
beginning to come apart. Our
time, I set i is claiming, is one of
catastrophe in which the im
plosion of messages on our
listening selves (we are all
eavesdroppers) and the explo
sion of our identities outward
are indistinguishable.
Another arena of discussion
in which we can and should
labor for self-apprehension is
the university and the ques
tion I want to close with is: Is
this happening at Stanford?
Where is there visible a
serious effort to measure our
selves as individuals, as a uni

versify, as a society?
The sad truth is, of course,
that there exists no such con
certed effort here. To he sure,
we have all kinds of measure
ments available; they carry
acronyms like SAT, MCAT,
CPA. And we have plenty of
"culture" too, writers,
musicians, speakers of
renown, expensively im
ported, "made available" to
the listening Stanford commu
nity. But there is on this
campus no indigenous and
collective effort toward
achieving an adequate aes
thetic and ethical measure of
ourselves.
There is no native Stanford
culture, no local debate; there
is no ongoing project of
shared reflection. Stanford
students seem content with a
life in which they are either
measured by others or (also by
others) entertained. It's high
time, I think, that this commu
nity begin to ask what time it
is.

or the one I most fear!) could
slip unnoticed into oblivion.
But in Iseli's print all these
words which the eavesdrop
per so eagerly absorbs are not
heard without cost.
Thousands of fine lines, like

the thinnest of wires, con
verge on the head of the
eavesdropper, bringing so
much energy, so much jagged
intensity into the picture that
the clean contours of the head
seem no longer able to con
tain the cacaphony of informa
tion which the insatiable
eavesdropper has taken in.
The figure's head — and this
is the moment the artist has
fixed on as our time — is
beginning to come apart. Our
time, I set i is claiming, is one of
catastrophe in which the im
plosion of messages on our
listening selves (we are all
eavesdroppers) and the explo
sion of our identities outward
are indistinguishable.
Another arena of discussion
in which we can and should
labor for self-apprehension is
the university and the ques
tion I want to close with is: Is
this happening at Stanford?
Where is there visible a
serious effort to measure our
selves as individuals, as a uni

versify, as a society?
The sad truth is, of course,
that there exists no such con
certed effort here. To he sure,
we have all kinds of measure
ments available; they carry
acronyms like SAT, MCAT,
CPA. And we have plenty of
"culture" too, writers,
musicians, speakers of
renown, expensively im
ported, "made available" to
the listening Stanford commu
nity. But there is on this
campus no indigenous and
collective effort toward
achieving an adequate aes
thetic and ethical measure of
ourselves.
There is no native Stanford
culture, no local debate; there
is no ongoing project of
shared reflection. Stanford
students seem content with a
life in which they are either
measured by others or (also by
others) entertained. It's high
time, I think, that this commu
nity begin to ask what time it
is.
David Wellberry is a profes
sor of German studies and a
resident fellow at Roble.
What time is it?
Hard to imagine a question
simpler to answer. We're all
equipped with digital
chronometers, we all hear, as
we wander across the campus
(in pursuit of a thought per
haps?), bell-conveyed reports
that another quarter hour has
passed. And, as if this weren't
enough, beginnings and ends
of Stanford classes are sig
nalled (or commanded?) by an
obnoxious sound in which I
for one detect an echo of
machine-gun fire. We know —
incessantly — what time it is.
At least in the sense of
clock-time, in the sense of
parcelled, managed, econ
omized time.
But what if we ask the ques
tion in a more general way?
What if it means: What time is
it in our lives, individual and
collective? How far have we
come? How low have we fal

len? Then our watches don't
help us; nor do — at least not
adequately — the tons of
graphs and diagrams which
our society produces (and
which it must produce to
manage itself), gauging our
productivity, our birth rates,
our income levels, our heart
beats, our moral infringe
ments. The fact is, we have no
ready instruments with which
to take our own measure.
But clearly this must be
done. We must apprehend
ourselves not merely in terms
of an infinitely extended,
depthless line, but rather in
terms of that complex and
fractured dimensionality
which is our life with one an
other and with the world
around us. We must take our
measure in an aesthetic, ethi
cal and (perhaps even still) re
ligious sense (and I don't
mean to imply that these can
be rigorously separated).
One place this labor of self
apprehension gets done is art.

Art is an arena of discussion in
which we work out, as artists
and interpreters, the problem
of self-measure. I was in New
York recently, Museum of
Modern Art, exhibition of

fort to measure ourselves as

effort here.

Swiss artist Rolf Iseli.
One print in particular
caught my eye and imagina
tion; it was called "Der Hor-

cher" ("The Eavesdropper").
My suggestion is this: If we
could transport every Stanford
student to this picture, and if
we could guarantee that,
standing before it, she/he
would absorb that image into

her/his life, allowing it to
resonate with all the other
images our culture surrounds
us with, constructing and

reconstructing this, we would
accomplish more (there's the
question of measure again) for
those students' education,
than we normally do in an
entire quarter.
Head and shoulders neatly
outlined, head turned away so
the figure (male, by the way)
has no physiognomy. He
doesn't see, but just listens;
his entire being — and the
slight twist and strain of the
body shows this — is taken up
in this one activity: listening.
Hungry for information, he is
"all ears." Strange passion
that animates the eavesdrop
per, that holds him at the
door, captivated: the desire to
hear everything, the fear that
even a single word (it might be
just the one I am longing for
or the one I most fear!) could
slip unnoticed into oblivion.
