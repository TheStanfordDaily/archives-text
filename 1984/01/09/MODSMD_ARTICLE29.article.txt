## Card hoopsters win, but not when it counts Card drops first two Pac-10 games 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The Stanford basketball
team is 11-3. That's the good
news.
*:The bad news is that the
Cardinal is 0-2 in the Pacific-10
Conference and already has its
back against the wall if it
hopes to stay in the league
race and qualify for a post
season tournament.
After posting an 11-1 pre-
Pjic-10 record, including eight
straight wins, Stanford lost
close games to No. 15 ranked
Oregon State Thursday, 64-59,
and Oregon Saturday, 79-78.
And with a road game
against No. 6 UCLA tomorrow
night in Los Angeles, where
Stanford has not beaten the
Bruins in 32 years, the Card is
as good as 0-3.
"This is a crucial time for us
as a team," said Stanford Head
Coach Tom Davis after the
heartbreaking defeat to
Oregon Saturday night. "I told
our players we had to do some
things or it will be a tough
remainder of the season."
Both games, played in
Maples Pavilion before crowds

of 6432 Thursday and 5021 Sat
urday, once again showed
Stanford's uncanny ability to
come back trom deficits late in
the game. But just as uncanny
was the Card's ability to turn
the ball over once it had
climbed back into the game.
Making Stanford's late come
back even more difficult was
the torrid second-half shoot
ing of both Oregon State (9-2
overall, 2-0 in the Pac-10) and
Oregon (6-5, 1-1). The Beavers
made 80 percent (16-of-20) of
their second-half field goal
tries Thursday, while Oregon
was even hotter, shooting 81
percent (17-of-21) in the
second period two nights
later.
The Card played one non
conference game and both
contests against the taller
Oregon schools without 6-
t'oot-9 junior forward Hans
Wichary, who is sidelined un
til at least next Friday with a
sprained ankle he sustained
during the team's three-game
trip to Hawaii over Christmas.
His loss showed up most in
the rebounding department,
as both the Beavers and the

Ducks outboarded the Card
25-19 and 25-22, respectively.
But it was the turnovers
during crucial moments late in
the game that spelled doom
for Stanford and relief for its
opponents.
After blowing a 10-point
second-halt lead against
Oregon, Stanford found itself
behind 75-70 with 2:27 to go.
But junior forward Steve
Brown hit a 19-foot jumper
from the right side and senior
guard Keith Jones followed it
with a steal and an uncon
tested lay-in to close the gap
to one with 1:24 remaining.
The two teams then traded
baskets to make the score 77-
76 in Oregon's favor and Davis
called a time-out to set up his
heralded full-court press. It
paid off, as the Ducks were
unable to inbound the ball in
the allotted five seconds and
hence turned it over.
Suddenly, Stanford had the
ball with 1:10 to go and a
chance to win the game. On
the final play of the game we
were trying to get it into John
(Revelli)Davis later ex
plained. "We had over a min
ute left. But they shut him
down on the swing of the
ball."
The Card cautiously passed
the ball around the perimeter
until about the 25-second
mark, when Davis called for a
set play designed to get either
Jones or Brown a medium- to
long-range jumper.
But in the process of setting
up the play, point guard Keith
Ramee threw a lazy cross
court pass which Oregon for
ward Mike Matheson inter
cepted with 0:20 left on the
clock. "The pass was lobbed
up rather than crisp and
sharp," Davis said.
The Ducks played keep
away for 11 seconds until
Ramee fouled junior guard
Chris Harper. Harper, who led
all scorers with 22 points,
calmly sunk both free throws
and Stanford was history.
Brown led Stanford with 20
points on 10-for-12 shooting
from the ReveW\ had 18,
including 14 free throws, but
his problems from the free
throw line continued as he
missed two front ends of one
and-one opportunities in the
final six minutes of the game.
Jones also poured in 18, but
made only 8-of-17 field goal at
tempts, misfiring on his first
six tries of the second half.

After intentionally fouling Oregon's Chris Harper in the final
seconds of Saturday's game, Stanford guard Keith Ramee
checks the opposite scoreboard. With 20 seconds left,

Oregon's Mike Matheson stole a bad cross-court pass by
Ramee that set up an 11-second Oregon stall. Harper made
both foul shots, sealing a 79-78 Oregon win.
