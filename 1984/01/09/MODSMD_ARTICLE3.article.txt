Sigma Chi residents were forced lo evacuate their house Dec. 11
as smoke billowed from a room fire. At left, firefighters climb the
fire escape to battle the flames. Above, Sigma Chi senior Matt
Schooler watches in bewilderment. The fire started when a student
left a burning candle on his desk. The candle burned down, setting
papers on the desk aflame. The fire did not spread beyond the one
room.
