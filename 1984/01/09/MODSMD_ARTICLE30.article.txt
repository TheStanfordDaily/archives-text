# Stanford wins 8 straight over winter break
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
You can take away the luster of Stan
ford's 11-1 pre-Pacific-10 Conference
record by simply mentioning some of the
teams it beat. Bemidji State, Eastern Mon
tana, Hawaii Pacific (twice), Western Mic
higan and U.S International are not ex
actly national basketball powers.
One thing you can't take away from
Coach Tom Davis and the Cardinal,
however, are the 11 wins. Granted, Stan
ford played far inferior teams. But they
won. What else were they supposed to
do?
According to Davis, though, the patsy
filled pre-Pac-10 schedule — which gave
the Card its fastest start in 35 years at 11-1
— did more than put chalk marks in the
"W" column.
"I think we kept improving throughout
the pre-season," Davis said in a press
conference before last Thursday's Pac-10
opener against Oregon State. "I can't
think of one player who hasn't gotten
better.
"We got a chance to play some good
tough games on the road in Hawaii,
which will help us in the Pac-10."

After losing a closer-than-the-score
indicates 88-75 decision to then-No. 1
ranked and still-No. 1 ranked North
Carolina in the Hewlett-Packard/Stanford
Invitational early last month, Stanford
won eight straight games. The wins
weren't against North Carolinas by any
means, but they were victories nonethe
less, something that catches the eye of
post-season tournament selection com
mittees.
Should Stanford break even in the Pac
10 at 9-9, it could still lose its final non
conference game against Santa Clara Feb.
7 and finish the season with 20 wins at 20-
11 — probably good enough for at least
the NIT (National Invitational Tourna
ment).
Stanford does have a better chance
than most other schools at reaching the
psychologically advantageous 20-win
mark because it plays a .31-game schedule
this season.
NCAA Division I teams are allowed to
play 28 "counting" games (excluding ex
hibition contests) per season in the con
tinental United States. However, schools
may play up to three additional games in

either Alaska (as in November's Alaska
Shootout Tournament) or in Hawaii, as
did Stanford over Christmas break.
The seven-day, three-game trip to
Hawaii proved to be more than a chance
to exchange presents on the beach for
Stanford, as the Card was forced to come
from-behind to win all three games. And,
perhaps more importantly, it gave indi
viduals like Steve Brown a chance to
assert their roles on the team.
Following is a brief, game-by-game run
down of Stanford's eight non-conference
wins over the academic year's quarter
break before the start of the Pac-10
season:
Stanford 107, UC-San Diego 60
The Card broke open a close game that
was tied six times early with a burst of 17
unanswered points midway through the
first half. Stanford went on to top the 100-
point mark for the second time this
season, the first time a Cardinal team has
done so.
Senior guard Keith jones led Stanford
with 24 points, making 11 -of-14 shots
