# Stanford wins 8 straight over winter break
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
You can take away the luster of Stan
ford's 11-1 pre-Pacific-10 Conference
record by simply mentioning some of the
teams it beat. Bemidji State, Eastern Mon
tana, Hawaii Pacific (twice), Western Mic
higan and U.S International are not ex
actly national basketball powers.
One thing you can't take away from
Coach Tom Davis and the Cardinal,
however, are the 11 wins. Granted, Stan
ford played far inferior teams. But they
won. What else were they supposed to
do?
According to Davis, though, the patsy
filled pre-Pac-10 schedule — which gave
the Card its fastest start in 35 years at 11-1
— did more than put chalk marks in the
"W" column.
"I think we kept improving throughout
the pre-season," Davis said in a press
conference before last Thursday's Pac-10
opener against Oregon State. "I can't
think of one player who hasn't gotten
better.
"We got a chance to play some good
tough games on the road in Hawaii,
which will help us in the Pac-10."

After losing a closer-than-the-score
indicates 88-75 decision to then-No. 1
ranked and still-No. 1 ranked North
Carolina in the Hewlett-Packard/Stanford
Invitational early last month, Stanford
won eight straight games. The wins
weren't against North Carolinas by any
means, but they were victories nonethe
less, something that catches the eye of
post-season tournament selection com
mittees.
Should Stanford break even in the Pac
10 at 9-9, it could still lose its final non
conference game against Santa Clara Feb.
7 and finish the season with 20 wins at 20-
11 — probably good enough for at least
the NIT (National Invitational Tourna
ment).
Stanford does have a better chance
than most other schools at reaching the
psychologically advantageous 20-win
mark because it plays a .31-game schedule
this season.
NCAA Division I teams are allowed to
play 28 "counting" games (excluding ex
hibition contests) per season in the con
tinental United States. However, schools
may play up to three additional games in

either Alaska (as in November's Alaska
Shootout Tournament) or in Hawaii, as
did Stanford over Christmas break.
The seven-day, three-game trip to
Hawaii proved to be more than a chance
to exchange presents on the beach for
Stanford, as the Card was forced to come
from-behind to win all three games. And,
perhaps more importantly, it gave indi
viduals like Steve Brown a chance to
assert their roles on the team.
Following is a brief, game-by-game run
down of Stanford's eight non-conference
wins over the academic year's quarter
break before the start of the Pac-10
season:
Stanford 107, UC-San Diego 60
The Card broke open a close game that
was tied six times early with a burst of 17
unanswered points midway through the
first half. Stanford went on to top the 100-
point mark for the second time this
season, the first time a Cardinal team has
done so.
Senior guard Keith jones led Stanford
with 24 points, making 11 -of-14 shots
from the floor, while senior center John
Revelli, who pulled down a game-high
nine rebounds, added 21. Brandon Nixon
paced UC-San Diego with 20 points.
Stanford 80, Eastern Montana 69
Eastern Montana cut a 14-point Stan
ford lead to six with 12 minutes left in the
game, but Jones scored eight of his 28
points in the next 4:30 as Stanford out
scored the Yellow jackets 16-6 to take a
commanding 75-59 advantage.
Jones made 13-of-22 field goal at
tempts, but Revelli did not fare as well,
making only 4-of-11 for 13 total points.
Revelli did pull down eight rebounds.
Eastern Montana guard Jeff Andrade led
all scorers with 31 points, most of them
from the outside, and center Mark
Brewer blocked nine shots.
Eastern Montana managed to out
rebound Stanford 38-27, but committed
36 costly turnovers.
Stanford 79, Harvard 66
The Crimson played what Sports Infor
mation Director James Greenridge called
"the best half of basketball I've seen at
Harvard," and led 40-39 at intermission,
but Stanford scored 14 of the first 18
points of the second half to take a 53-44
lead, one it never relinquished.
Harvard center Joe Carrabino led all
scorers with 30 points, 20 of which he
scored in the first half. Jones again led
Stanford with 28, his second 28-point per
formance in two nights. Brown scored 20

and Revelli 15, as Stanford shot 60 percent
(27-of-45) from the floor in the game.
Stanford 89, at Hawaii Pacific 78
Stanford was forced to come-from
behind in the second half to beat the
same Hawaii Pacific team that the Card
routed 115-74 a month earlier, setting a
school record for the most points scored
in one game. After the Sea Warriors led
47-46 at halftime, Stanford outscored
them 43-31 in the second half.
Hawaii Pacific guard Rick Wozeniak led
all scorers with 34 points. But five Stan
ford players scored in double figures
(Revelli with 20, Jones with 16, Koberlein
with 15 and Brown and freshman guard
John Paye with 10 apiece).
Stanford 60, at Chaminade 55
In probably Stanford's most impressive
win this season, the Card came from be
hind for the third straight game and hung
on for a five-point victory against the Sil
verswords, who just a week later upset
nationally-ranked Louisville.
Stanford found itself behind 8-0 three
minutes into the game and then 33-29 at
the half. And with 10 minutes to go, the
Card still trailed, 47-46. But Brown caught
fire and buried three straight long-range
jumpers. Brown added a free throw and
Jones a jumper to give Stanford its biggest
lead at 55-47. Jones finished Chaminade
off with a dunk with 0:17 remaining.
Brown ended with a game-high 24
points, while Revelli and Jones added 14
and 12, respecitively.
Stanford 98, at BYU-Hawaii 89
In the final game of Stanford's three
game road trip to Hawaii, the Card was on

the verge of blowing out Brigham Young-
Hawaii after taking leads of 13-0 and 19-2.
But the Seasiders climbed back into it and
actually led 41-39 before Stanford got
back on top to stay at halftime, 53-45.
Jones ignited the Stanford machine
with 33 points, making 9-of-!4 field goals
and 15-of-18 free throws. Revelli checked
in with 17 points and 11 rebounds, while
Brown has 15 points and point guard
Keith Ramee 13.
Stanford 80, W. Michigan 62
)ones collected six of his game-high 20
points in a key five-minute stretch in the
second half when Stanford outscored
Western Michigan 16-2 and took a com
manding 67-43 lead. Revelli scored 19
points and grabbed eight rebounds. Cor
dell Eley led the losers with 18 and James
Booker added 14.
Stanford 89, USIU 82
Stanford overcame a record-setting 43-
point effort by U.S. International's Brett
Crawford to come-from-behind to beat
the Gulls. USIU, believe it or not, actually
led the game 74-73 with 6:34 to go, which
says something about how Stanford
played considering USIU entered the
game with a 2-16 record.
But the Card scored 10 of the next 14
points to take a 83-78 lead three minutes
later and put the game away, despite
making only 5-of-10 free throws down the
stretch.
Revelli scored 30 points, hitting all eight
field goal tries and 14-of-21 free throws.
Revelli's 30 points were one shy of his
career best, but Brown did tally a career
high with his 26 points. Jones added 20, as
all but 13 of Stanford's points were scored
by either Revelli, Brown or Jones.
