# Former SJS mentor takes over at Stanford
## Elway, Sr., replaces Wiggin 
### ADAM BERNS 
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger
must have figured that if you can't beat
him, why not hire him, as Geiger an
nounced the hiring of Jack Elway as Stan
ford's new football coach.
Elway has coached at San lose the past
five seasons compiling a 35-19-1 record
and has beaten Pacific-10 teams in his last
seven of 11 tries. He has also defeated
Stanford in his last three of four tries at
San Jose State.
The Elway name is a familiar one on
campus as Jack Elway's son, John,
graduated from Stanford last year, break
ing virtually every Stanford passing
record.
Elway's main rival for the job was UC-
Davis Coach Jim Sochor but many feel
that Elway held the advantage because of
his experience in dealing with a major
college program and because of San Jose
State's proximity to Stanford.
While Elway inherits a team which went
1-10 this past year, he feels confident in
his ability to turn around the program. "I
wouldn't be here if I didn't feel it could
be a first-class, successful football pro
gram," he said.
Recruiting could be the most important
aspect of rebuilding the program accor
ding to Elway, but he emphasized that it
would take time.
"In any successful program 80 percent
of it is recruiting and 20 percent is coach
ing," Elway said. "It becomes pretty irrel
evant if you don't have a year-round
recruiting program.

(3-2 versus Stanford)

"Stanford football players have to be
identified and identified early. I've never
been in a position where, with 95 percent
of those you're recruiting, Stanford is
going to be one of their two or three
choices."
Although Elway recruited many junior
college transfers while at San Jose State,
he did not feel that the different emphasis
at Stanford would be a big problem. He
did say that he saw no reason why

qualified junior college transfers could
not also be identified. "There are from
three to five junior college players in Cali
fornia every year who could also meet the
requirements," Elway emphasized.
Geiger reconfirmed the fact that admis
sions requirements would not be any
lower, even with the renewed emphasis
on recruiting. "There is a desire here to
be competitive," he said. "There have
been no concessions and nothing has
changed in terms of standards for admis
sion. Stanford's undergraduate program
has just been rated first in the nation and
this is a marvelous product to be able to
sell. We can look people in the eye and
say that we're No. 1 in a very basic area,
and that's the quality of education that is
available here."
Dick James who was the recruiting co
ordinator under ex-Stanford Coach Paul
Wiggin will remain in that position under
Elway while offensive coordinator Jim Fas
sel will remain on the staff as a receiving
coach. James and Fassel were the only
two assistants kept by Elway.
A 1949 graduate of Hoquiam High
School, Elway played football at Washing
ton State, graduating in 1953. He went on
to coach high school football before
taking a job with Grays Harbor College,
producing a 32-17-2 record in six years.
After coaching as an assistant at the Uni
versity of Montana and Washington State
University, Elway became the head coach
at Cal State Northridge where he
compiled a 20-11-1 record before moving
to San Jose State in 1978.
