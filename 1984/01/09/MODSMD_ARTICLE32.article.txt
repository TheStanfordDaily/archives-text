# Local stars shine in East-West Shrine game
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
The game had its fireworks
and its dull moments but for
most of the players the final
score did not really matter.
The scouts infiltrating the
press box were the audience
that needed to be impressed.
Just for the record, the East
team beat the West squad 27-
19, using a powerful running
attack and strong defense.
The West, which had most
of the "name" players, was
hampered by eight turnovers,
four interceptions and four
fumbles, as Arizona quarter
back Tom Tunnicliffe and Ne
braska quarterback Turner Gill
both committed crucial errors
for the West.
Most of the people watch
ing the game, however, did
not care much about the
teams, but about the individ
ual players.
The game's offensive most
valuable player was a fleet
footed receiver from the East
named Joey Jones. The 5-foot
9, 165-pound receiver from Al
abama who caught just 31
passes during the regular
season, scored the East's first
touchdown on a diving 45-
yard touchdown reception
and scored again on a 9-yard
reverse later in the game.
Ron Rivera, the All-America
linebacker from UC-Berkeley,
was named the outstanding
defensive player. Rivera made
several key tackles for the
West squad during the game.
After the contest Rivera talked
about his pro football future,
in particular where he would
like to be playing next year.

Rivera has a couple of options.
The 6-3, 225-pound
linebacker was drafted by the
Oakland Invaders of the
United States Football League.
At the same time, most ex
perts feel that he should go in
the first or the second round
of the National Football
League draft this May.
"I'm planning to sit down
Monday with the Invaders and
talk," Rivera said following
Saturday's contest. "If they
gave me an offer that I
couldn't refuse, maybe I

would go with them, but I'd
like to stay with the NFL be
cause its a more established
league. I would really like to
stay with a West Coast team
like the San Francisco 49ers."
Rivera felt that he was not
nearly as effective in the first
half of Saturday's game be
cause he wasn't able to look at
game film. "I got geared up in
the second half because I
knew how they were blocking
me. You don't have any film or
scout teams in a game like
this."

Two Stanford players,
seniors Mike Tolliver and
Vaughn Williams also had a
chance to play their last game
in Stanford Stadium.
Tolliver, a fifth-year senior
who led Stanford in receiving
this season, caught four
passes in Saturday's game,
and felt that he was able to
compete against the best
seniors in the nation. "It just
confirms the fact that I know
that I can compete," Tolliver
said about his performance.
One advantage that Tolliver
had was that he did not have

to learn a whole new offense,
having played under Arizona
Coach Larry Smith (who
coached the West team) last
week in the Blue-Grey All Star
Game.
At 6-feet, 185 pounds, some
scouts have questioned Tol
liver's size, but he rejects the
notion that size has anything
to do with one's ability to be a
good receiver. "I feel that I
can make it," Tolliver said. "I
can read moves and I know
how to get open. In college,
there are some guys that are
good athletes and others that
have good technique. The
step to pros is a good athlete
who also has good technique.
I think that I have the knowl
edge and I can get open. The
key is consistency."
While Tolliver was not
drafted by the USFL, he was
not disappointed, because his
goal is to play with the NFL.
"I'm looking at the NFL," he
said. "Their (the Oakland In
vaders) reasoning behind it
(not drafting him) was that
they had two small receivers
and were looking to get some
body bigger."
Stanford strong safety
Vaughn Williams also played
in the game and seemed in
bright, if not cocky, spirits
after the contest.
"I was great," Williams said
about his performance. "I'm
looking ahead to pro foot
ball."
Asked whether he had any

player. Rivera made several key tackles and recovered one fumble.
preference about the NFL or
USFL, Williams quipped,
"Whichever pays me the most
money."
Heisman Trophy winner
Mike Rozier, the highly ac
claimed running back out of
Nebraska who became only
the second man in college
football history to rush for
over 2000 yards as he ran for
2148 yards and a record-tying
29 touchdowns, had to sit out
Saturday's game because of an
ankle injury sustained in the
Orange Bowl against Miami
last weekend. Rozier made the
trip to the Shrine games
anyhow, joining three of his
Nebraska teammates, offen
sive lineman Scott Raridon,
wide receiver Irving Fryar and
Gill.
The Shrine game, however,
is more than just a post-season
football game for the top col
lege seniors to show off to pro
scouts. The proceeds from the
game go to support the 21
Shriners Hospitals for
Crippled Children. These
hospitals provide medical care
and services to needy children
absolutely free.
Currently there are 60,000
people being treated in Shrine
hospitals and now in its 59th
year, the East-West game has
raised more than $9 million for
the hospitals.
In fact, in this coming year,
a new spinal cord center will
be opening up in its San Fran
cisco hospital. Eight beds will
be designated solely for
youngsters with spinal cord in
juries.
The Shrine games have also
been characterized by large
and elaborate halftime shows
and this year was no excep
tion. A large Scottish high
lands festival was the highlight
of the halftime festivities.

Rozier was not able to play due to an ankle injury sustained
last weekend in the Orange Bowl, but still made the trip to

Stanford. More than 70,000 people attended Saturday's
game. Proceeds help support the 21 Shriner hospitals
around the United States which give free medical care to
crippled and burned children.
