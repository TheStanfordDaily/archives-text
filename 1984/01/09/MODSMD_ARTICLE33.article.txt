Washington 24, S F 21
Washington (AP) — Mark Moseley has been a placekick
er long enough to know how tenuous the job can be.
Four times yesterday, Moseley missed field goals as the
Washington Redskins battled the San Francisco 49ers for
the National Football Conference championship. But with
just 40 seconds left to play, he hit a 25-yarder that sent the
defending champions back to the Super Bowl on j<in. 22 at
Tampa Stadium for another shot at the National Football
League title.
"I really wasn't sweating it," said Moseley, who set an
NFL kick scoring record with 161 points this season. "I
don't miss four in practice all week."
But he had been wide right on attempts of 45, 34 and 38
yards and short with a 41-yarder yesterday.
Quarterback Joe Theismann positioned the ball at the
15-yard line for Moseley's 25-yard attempt. Then, Theis
mann knelt on one knee to hold the snap.
"How good was Moseley's kick?" he was asked.
"Good enough to get us to Tampa," Theismann said.
"He's the best in football as far as pressure goes."
Los Angeles 30, Seattle 7
Los Angeles (AP) — The Los Angeles defense intercepted
five passes and Jim Plunkett's passing set up two scoring
runs by Frank Hawkins as the Raiders routed the Seattle
Seahawks 30-14 yesterday to set up a Super Bowl con
frontation with the defending champion Washington
Redskins.
Except for one scoring drive in the third period, by
which time L.A. led 27-0, and another in the closing minute
of the game, the Seahawks' offense in the American Con
ference championship was dormant.
Dave Krieg completed just three of nine passes for 12
yards with three interceptions and three sacks before
being pulled in the third period. And AFC rushing cham
pion Curt Warner gained just 26 yards on 11 carries.
Now the Raiders get a chance to get even with the
Redskins, who rallied from a 35-20 deficit in the final seven
and a half minutes last Oct. 2 and beat the Raiders 37-35.
