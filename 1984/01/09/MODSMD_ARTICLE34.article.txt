# Improve on last year's 4th place

Improvement has been the
name of the game for the Stan
ford women's volleyball
team. After placing ninth, fifth
and fourth at the NCAA tourn
ament the last three seasons,
the Cardinal women beat the
University of the Pacific in the
final consolation round to take
third at the NCAA tournament
this year.
The tournament took place
December 16-18 at the Univer
sity of Kentucky.
Stanford won the Western
Regional competition by
beating San Diego State
(December 9-10) to earn a spot
at the NCAA Final Four. The
other region winners were the
University of Hawaii (the No. 1
seed at the tournament),
which defeated Kentucky to
win the South Regional,
UCLA, which defeated West
ern Michigan for the Mideast
regional title, and UOP, which
won the Northeast regional.
The Cardinal's first match in
the Final Four tournament was
against the No. 1 ranked
Hawaii Rainbow Wahines.This
was the second straight year
that Stanford has played the
Rainbows in the semifinals for
the NCAA tournament. This

time Hawaii defeated the Car
dinal in three straight games,
15-9, 15-7 and 15-7 for the vic
tory.
The Rainbow Wahines were
led by 28-year-old setter )oyce
Kaapuni, one of five seniors
on the team. Hawaii kept Stan
ford off balance and stopped
the Cardinal hard-hitting at
tack. Kaapuni played for the
Rainbow Wahines for two
years in the early 1970s and
returned to play her last two
years for Hawaii just last year.
After losing to Hawaii, the
Cardinal came back to defeat
the No. 2 seed UOP Tigers
who were upset in the semi
finals by UCLA. The Cardinal
defeated the Tigers 7-15, 15-8,
15-11 and 15-2 to earn a third
place finish at the tournament.
Hawaii easily defeated the
surprising Bruins in the tourn
ament finals. After a sloppy 15-
13 win in the opening game,
the Rainbow Wahine's easily
outhit UCLA 15-4 and 15-10 to
close out the NCAA finals.
The tournament, however,
was marred by a "seeding
controversy" which kept the
host school, Kentucky, out of
the tournament's Final Four.
The NCAA decided to seed the

tournament based on records
and season results rather than
on a regional basis. Kentucky,
therefore, had the No. 1
ranked Hawaii team in its
regionals.
Much of the local press was
disappointed with the seeding
arrangements but the decision
was defended by the NCAA
because a regional seeding
system would have kept two
of the nations top four teams
out of the NCAA Final Four
tournament as UCLA, UOP
and Stanford are all in the
same region.
Stanford senior Kari Rush
was a standout for the Car
dinal in the tournament. She
won the Most Valuable Player
award at the Western Regional
and was named to the All-
Tournament team in the Final
Four.
Rush, a senior, is the only
Cardinal woman not returning
next year. Kim Oden, Bobbi
Broer, Lisa Murphy, setter
Deidra Dvorak and outside
hitter Barbara Fontana all
return next year. Oden and
Broer also were selected to
the Western Regional All-
Tournament team this season.
