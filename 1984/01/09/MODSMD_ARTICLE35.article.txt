### CAROLYN TARKINGTON 
The men's gymnastics
season is now underway, with
a very successful season
opener. The Spartan Open,
held on Dec. 9 and 10,
brought six teams together in
a competition held at San Jose
State. The teams competing
were Stanford, UC-Berkeley,
UC-Davis, San Jose State,
Fullerton State and a team
composed of post graduates
of the competing schools.
Stanford had an excellent
showing during Friday night's
team competition, taking the
first place team finish. Fuller
ton was second while Cal
placed third.
Especially outstanding was
sophomore-Jon Levy, who re
corded a second place all
around finish of 109.95 points
total, just behind Cal's post
graduate Bi-lly Paul, who
totaled 111.25. Paul is ranked

11th on the U.S. national team
but Stanford Coach Sad a
Hamada feels Levy is of an
equal, if not better, caliber
than Paul. Levy also took first
place on both rings and high
bar with 9.60 and 9.65,
respectively.
Other oustanding perfor
mances were seen by sopho

international competition
being held tomorrow at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion. It will
