Winter quarter has begun, and so has the
gymnastics season. It should be an exciting
year for both the men's and women's teams.
The women started off their season on Dec. 8
in a dual meet against the University of Min
nesota. Despite the early start in the season,
the team managed to compile a total of 168.25.
This is five points more than the total in their
first meet last year. The University of Min
nesota won the meet with a team total/ of
175.85.
Junior Angie Barnes led Stanford with an out
standing performance and second place all
around finish. Her all-around score totalled a
35.85, and she also placed second on beam and
third on bars with a 9.20 and 8.90, respectively.
Barnes is from Edina, Minn., and she felt that
having the support from a hometown crowd
helped her to have a good performance. Senior
Merilyn Chapman placed fifth all-around, while
freshman Laura Putnam placed sixth all-around
and third on floor exercise.
After a short Christmas break, the team came
back early to train and prepare for Friday's
competition at Maples Pavilion. It was a tough
meet against nationally ranked UCLA. UCLA's
team placed sixth in the NCAA nationals last
year and is currently ranked No. 4.

The Bruins finished with a team total of
178.70 to Stanford's 172.70. Stanford's Head
Coach Homer Sardina was pleased with the
four-point improvement over the team's total
in their first meet. He also felt that once the
number of misses is decreased, the team score
will be much higher.
Stanford freshman Nancy Goldsmith made
her debut in this competition, proving to be
Stanford's top all around performer. Goldsmith
just arrived at Stanford this quarter due to an
international competition which kept her from
starting school in the autumn. She was a com
petitor in the World Championships in
Budapest, Hungary, as a member of the Israel
National team. She then qualified from there to
compete for Israel as a member of the 1984
Olympic team. Goldsmith also has also partici
pated in the U.S. championships. Much of her
training took place at the National Academy of
Artistic Gymnastics in Eugene, Ore.
Goldsmith placed second all around with a
total of 36.05 behind UCLA's Tracy Curtis in
first place. She also took a second place on
both bars and beam with a 9.20 and 9.05,
respectively.
Other noteworthy performances by Stanford
gymnasts came from Merilyn Chapman (fourth
all around), Barnes (tied for fifth all around with
UCLA's Janet Ferrari), and Laura Putnam (sixth
all around).
