# Women hoopsters drop 6 straight
## 
### JOHN LIS 
Inconsistency and youth
are an almost inseparable
combination in major col
lege sports. The Stanford
women's basketball team,
with only two upperclass
men on the roster, has
proved no exception. In
the six games since Dead
Week, the lady cagers' play
ranged from very solid to
very poor, but the unfor
tunate results were six
defeats.
The Cardinal opened the
stretch Dec. 9 at the Uni
versity of San Francisco.
Despite 16 points from
both sophomore guard Vir
ginia Sourlis and junior for
ward Mary Bradach and a
15-point, 13-rebound per
formance by sophomore
center Sarah Evans, the
Cardinal dropped an uni
nspired 69-63 decision to
the Dons.
USF gave Stanford
several opportunities down
the stretch to win the con
test, but poor shooting
coupled with a pair of
charging fouls enabled the
Dons to hold on.
The following evening
the Card looked far from
nice. Hosting a UC-
Berkeley team with an edge
in both talent and experi
ence, Stanford gave the
Bears all they could handle
before falling, 73-64.
Stanford shot 52 percent
from the field and commit
ted only 10 turnovers in an
all-around solid effort.
Bradach again paced the
Cardinal with 19 points
before fouling out in the
second half, while Evans
added 18.
After finals, Stanford
played host to Cal Poly-

Pomona Dec. 16. The Car
dinal, as it has done on
several occasions this
season, played two very dif
ferent halves of basketball.
In the opening period
the Cardinal opened up a
36-27 lead over Pomona,
who came to the Farm with
a 7-1 record. Led by Evans'
12 first half points, Stanford
shot 58 percent from the
field and held Pomona's
scoring threat, Janine Phil
lips to only four points.
The second half saw
Pomona outscore the Card,
44-32, to gain a 71-68 vic
tory. The Cardinal trailed
69-68 down the stretch, but
freshmen Erica Mueser and
Kim Mercer both missed
front ends of one-and-one
situations and a pair of free
throws clinched it for
Pomona.
Last week the Cardinal
traveled to Miami for the
Miami Dial Classic. In the
opening game against Mis
souri last Monday, the Card
suffered a humiliating 72-32
drubbing in a game that, as
Mueser put it, "we'd like to
forget."
The following night the
Card turned in an improved
performance against
Florida State. Bradach came
out of the gate quickly,
scoring eight points in the
first four minutes as Stan
ford opened a 15-2 lead,
but she twisted her ankle
and was out for the rest of
the contest. The loss hurt
the Cardinal as the
Seminoles came back to
win, 73-60.
Last Thursday against
Penn State, the Cardinal
put in another solid effort,
but came out on the short
end again, losing 73-63.
