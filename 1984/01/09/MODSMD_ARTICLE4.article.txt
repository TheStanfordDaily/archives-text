Chinese premier visits U.S.
Honolulu — After a day of playing tourist here,
Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang left for Williamsburg,
Va., yesterday morning to continue his eight-day
North American tour.
Zhao, flying in a special U.S. Air Force jet, left Hic
ham Air Force Base at 9:29 a.m. HST. The premier
spent Saturday sightseeing in Honolulu and was to
arrive at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Va.
about 11 p.m. yesterday. From there, he was to be
taken by motorcade to the Williamsburg, Va. area to
rest before meeting with President Reagan tomor
row.
The 65-year-old premier is the chief administrator

of China's government, which rules one billion
people.
He is the first high-ranking official of the People's
Republic of China to visit the United States since
Deng Xian Ping sealed the 1979 agreement opening
full diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Zhao's visit precedes a reciprocal trip President
Reagan will take to China in April. At that time, the
two leaders are expected to sign agreements on ex
changing trade and science and technology.
Zhao will tour historic Williamsburg — a popular
stop for world leaders visiting the United States and
site of last May's Summit of Industrialized Nations —
before heading to Washington for two days of
meetings with Reagan and other officials.
Zhao is expected to ask Reagan for continued
compliance with a 1982 pact that set limits on arms
sales to Taiwan while the sales are gradually phased
out.
Reagan and Zhao also are expected to agree to
resume official cultural exchanges. These were cut
short by Peking last April, when the United States
granted political asylum to Hu Na, a young Chinese
tennis player. On Thursday, Zhao will fly to the West
Coast to tour the University of California at
Berkeley, ride through the Silicon Valley high
technology industrial area and meet with California
politicians and local Chinese.
Increase recommended in U.S. aid
Washington — The presidential commission on
Central America will recommend $8 billion in U.S.
economic aid to the region over the next six years,
The Washington Post quoted commission officials as
saying Saturday.
The commission will also recommend that aid to
the region be conditioned on observance of human
rights and respect for the democratic process, the
newspaper, in yesterday's editions, quoted the uni
dentified officials as saying.

Under the panel's recommendation, the aid pro
gram would be administered by a new Central Amer
ican Development Organization, an international
body with a U.S. director, the newspaper said.
In comparison with the amount of aid the commis
sion reportedly favors, the United States allocated
$1,157 billion to Central America in 1982 and 1983,
according to State Department figures.
The 12-member panel, chaired by former Secre
tary of State Henry Kissinger, parted company with
President Reagan on one aspect of Central America
policy, the report said.
The panel, according to The Post, unanimously
called for a "legislatively mandated process of cer
tification" that human rights are being observed in
El Salvador as a condition for further military aid to
that nation.
Last month, the president vetoed a bill calling for
such certification.
There was no consensus reached on the question
of U.S. aid to rebels fighting the leftist government
of Nicaragua, the newspaper said. It said a majority
of the panel endorsed continuing the aid but that
the commission's final report will include the views
of dissenting members.
Meanwhile, The New York Times said in yester
day's editions that the panel's draft report says the
Soviet Union is threatening a "strategic coup of
major proportions" in Central America.
The report calls for a "new alliance for democracy
and prosperity" in the region to counter a "direct
threat to U.S. security interests."

The report says Soviet and Cuban influence in
Central America threatens U.S. security interests be
cause "a critical factor in the ability of the United
States to sustain a tolerable balance of power on the
global scene at a manageable cost has been the in
herent security of its land , borders, which have not
required frontier defenses."
The advance of Soviet and Cuban power on the
American mainland threatens this balance," The
Times quoted the report as saying, and,"From the
standpoint of the Soviet Union, it would be a strate
gic coup of major proportions to impose on the
United States the burden of landward defenses."
Syria denies bombing involvement
New York — The Syrian government had planned
to condemn the Beirut bombing that killed 241 U.S.
servicement, but abandoned the plan when Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger charged Syria with
being involved in the attack, according to a televised
report.
Syrian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Farouk
Al-Shara said in an interview broadcast yesterday on
CBS' "60 Minutes" program that Syrian officials
quashed the condemnation because they didn't
want to bow to U.S. pressure.
"And so we stopped doing, issuing any statement
because we don't want to give the impression that
we're being intimidated by the (U.S.) administra
tion," Al-Shara said.

The foreign minister denied any Syrian involve
ment or prior knowledge of the suicide truck bom
bing at the Beirut Airport Oct. 23. He said the Syrian
government feels dismay, regret and sympathy for
those killed and injured in the attack.
But he said more deaths are certain as long as
American troops stay in Lebanon.
Hunger panels calls for cuts
Washington — The presidential commission on
hunger is calling for cuts in food assistance and the
proposed final draft of its report fails to support
claims by various groups that hunger in the United
States is widespread, The Washington Post said in
yesterday's editions.
The key recommendation in the report by the Task
Force on Food Assistance would merge into a single
grant to the states all major federal anti-hunger pro
grams, the newspaper said. The block grant would
cover food stamps, school lunch and other child
nutrition programs, and the women-infant-children
special feeding program, according to the newspa
per.

Zhao is expected to ask Reagan for continued
compliance with a 1982 pact that set limits on arms
sales to Taiwan while the sales are gradually phased
out.
Reagan and Zhao also are expected to agree to
resume official cultural exchanges. These were cut
short by Peking last April, when the United States
granted political asylum to Hu Na, a young Chinese
tennis player. On Thursday, Zhao will fly to the West
Coast to tour the University of California at

Increase recommended in U.S. aid
Washington — The presidential commission on
Central America will recommend $8 billion in U.S.
economic aid to the region over the next six years,
The Washington Post quoted commission officials as
saying Saturday.
The commission will also recommend that aid to
the region be conditioned on observance of human
rights and respect for the democratic process, the
newspaper, in yesterday's editions, quoted the uni
dentified officials as saying.

Under the panel's recommendation, the aid pro
gram would be administered by a new Central Amer
ican Development Organization, an international
body with a U.S. director, the newspaper said.
In comparison with the amount of aid the commis
sion reportedly favors, the United States allocated
$1,157 billion to Central America in 1982 and 1983,
according to State Department figures.
The 12-member panel, chaired by former Secre
tary of State Henry Kissinger, parted company with
President Reagan on one aspect of Central America
policy, the report said.
The panel, according to The Post, unanimously
called for a "legislatively mandated process of cer
tification" that human rights are being observed in
El Salvador as a condition for further military aid to
that nation.
Last month, the president vetoed a bill calling for
such certification.
There was no consensus reached on the question
of U.S. aid to rebels fighting the leftist government
of Nicaragua, the newspaper said. It said a majority
of the panel endorsed continuing the aid but that
the commission's final report will include the views
of dissenting members.
Meanwhile, The New York Times said in yester
day's editions that the panel's draft report says the
Soviet Union is threatening a "strategic coup of
major proportions" in Central America.
The report calls for a "new alliance for democracy
and prosperity" in the region to counter a "direct
threat to U.S. security interests."

The report says Soviet and Cuban influence in
Central America threatens U.S. security interests be
cause "a critical factor in the ability of the United
States to sustain a tolerable balance of power on the
global scene at a manageable cost has been the in
herent security of its land , borders, which have not
required frontier defenses."
The advance of Soviet and Cuban power on the
American mainland threatens this balance," The
Times quoted the report as saying, and,"From the
standpoint of the Soviet Union, it would be a strate
gic coup of major proportions to impose on the
United States the burden of landward defenses."
Syria denies bombing involvement
New York — The Syrian government had planned
to condemn the Beirut bombing that killed 241 U.S.
servicement, but abandoned the plan when Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger charged Syria with
being involved in the attack, according to a televised
report.
Syrian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Farouk
Al-Shara said in an interview broadcast yesterday on
CBS' "60 Minutes" program that Syrian officials
quashed the condemnation because they didn't
want to bow to U.S. pressure.
"And so we stopped doing, issuing any statement
because we don't want to give the impression that
we're being intimidated by the (U.S.) administra
tion," Al-Shara said.

The foreign minister denied any Syrian involve
ment or prior knowledge of the suicide truck bom
bing at the Beirut Airport Oct. 23. He said the Syrian
government feels dismay, regret and sympathy for
those killed and injured in the attack.
But he said more deaths are certain as long as
American troops stay in Lebanon.
Hunger panels calls for cuts
Washington — The presidential commission on
hunger is calling for cuts in food assistance and the
proposed final draft of its report fails to support
claims by various groups that hunger in the United
States is widespread, The Washington Post said in
yesterday's editions.
The key recommendation in the report by the Task
Force on Food Assistance would merge into a single
grant to the states all major federal anti-hunger pro
grams, the newspaper said. The block grant would
cover food stamps, school lunch and other child
nutrition programs, and the women-infant-children
special feeding program, according to the newspa
per.
