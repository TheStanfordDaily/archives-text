Chinese premier visits U.S.
Honolulu — After a day of playing tourist here,
Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang left for Williamsburg,
Va., yesterday morning to continue his eight-day
North American tour.
Zhao, flying in a special U.S. Air Force jet, left Hic
ham Air Force Base at 9:29 a.m. HST. The premier
spent Saturday sightseeing in Honolulu and was to
arrive at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Va.
about 11 p.m. yesterday. From there, he was to be
taken by motorcade to the Williamsburg, Va. area to
rest before meeting with President Reagan tomor
row.
The 65-year-old premier is the chief administrator

of China's government, which rules one billion
people.
He is the first high-ranking official of the People's
Republic of China to visit the United States since
Deng Xian Ping sealed the 1979 agreement opening
full diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Zhao's visit precedes a reciprocal trip President
Reagan will take to China in April. At that time, the
two leaders are expected to sign agreements on ex
changing trade and science and technology.
Zhao will tour historic Williamsburg — a popular
stop for world leaders visiting the United States and
site of last May's Summit of Industrialized Nations —
before heading to Washington for two days of
meetings with Reagan and other officials.
