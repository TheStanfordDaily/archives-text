# Three students win Rhodes awards
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
Three Stanford students were
awarded Rhodes Scholarships Dec.
17 and will begin two years of study
at Oxford University in England next
October.
The three were:
•Christopher Hedrick, 21, a political
science major from Olympia,
Wash., who "stopped out" from
Stanford last summer and fall to
work as a legislative assistant in
Washington, D.C. for Rep. Don
Bonker (D-Wash.).
• Douglas Jehl, 21, a history major
from San Diego who was managing
editor of The Daily last year, and has
worked as an editorial writer for
both the Los Angeles Times and the
San Diego Tribune.
• Jeanette Pitts, 21, a biological
sciences major from Kansas City,
Kansas.
Pitts was the second woman and
the first black Rhodes scholar from
Stanford.
Their election increases to 47 the
number of Rhodes scholars
nominated by Stanford since 1903,
when British diamond magnate
Cecil Rhodes provided for the schol
arships in his will.
This is only the second year that
the University has had as many as
three Rhodes scholars, according to
Asst. History Prof. Stephen Fer
ruolo, who chairs Stanford's
Rhodes-Marshall panel. The first
group of three received scholar
ships in 1972.
Applicants are judged on literary
and scholastic attainments, leader
ship, moral character, physical
vitality and a number of other
criteria. Each must undergo a series
of grueling interviews from the
campus to the state to the district
level.
The competition is often fierce,

and more than 1200 students across
the country applied for the award
this year. Each year only 32 Ameri
can candidates receive scholarships,
which provide for two years of
expense-paid study at Oxford.
Each state can nominate only two
scholars to the district level, so in
California, where one in eight Amer
ican students either lives or attends
college, had to choose two
nominees from more than 75 appli
cants.
"It's much more competitive now
than ever before," Ferruolo said.
"Only since about 1978 have women
been eligible and that doubled the
number. And there have been more
applicants in recent years."
Ferruolo estimated that 42 Stan
ford students applied for Rhodes
and Marshall Scholarships this year,
an increase from 16 two years ago.
This is a significant increase, Fer
ruolo said, especially because at
Stanford there is no formal system
for identifying Rhodes candidates as
there is at Harvard.
This year, Flarvard led the compe
tition with seven Rhodes scholars.
Princeton and Yale also had three
each.
Ferruolo, a former Rhodes
scholar, described the Rhodes expe
rience as very valuable. "Oxford is a
superb university — certainly one of
the great universities in the world
. . . (The experience) also puts you
(the Rhodes scholars) in contact
with a verv impressive group of
people."
The Stanford Rhodes winners
have varying interests.
Hedrick studied arms control at
Stanford and specialized in defense
policy for Bonker.
He was "overjoyed" and
"very surprised" at his suc
cess in winning the Rhodes.
He plans to pursue a master's
degree and perhaps a doc
torate in political science at
Oxford. He credits Profs. John
Chubb and Terry Moe with en

couraging his studies.
Jehl, who is vice-president
of Delta Upsilon fraternity,
said of his feelings upon win
ning, "I was elated . . . It's a
terrific feeling to know what
you're going to be doing for
the next two years."
Jehl plans to study philoso
phy, economics and politics at
Oxford before returning to

journalism as a career.
He described the selection
process as grueling. "I was
asked everything from my po
sition on the 'Star Wars'
defense system to what makes
you cry . . . They were difficult
questions, but they were
asked with an encouraging
air."
Pitts credits her faculty ad

viser Prof. Ward Watt, several
black faculty and her family
with taking a special interest in
her work.
She plans to study physio
logical sciences at Oxford. She
has been active in the Black
Pre-Medical Society's Project
Motivate, speaking with high
school students who are inter
ested in health careers.
