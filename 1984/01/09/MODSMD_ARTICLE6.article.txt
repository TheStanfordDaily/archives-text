### MARK ZEIGLER 
A proposal that would cut Stanford's $1 million ath
letic budget deficit by restructuring the University's in
tercollegiate sports program was presented to the
Board of Trustees at its December meeting.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger and Vice Provost Ray
Bacchetti met wilh the Board to propose a three-tiered
system for the University's 24 intercollegiate sports
teams. Geiger and Bacchetti will go before the Board
again with a modified proposal at its February meeting,
at which time a final decision is expected.
"We have been bigger than we could afford to be,
Geiger said. "We don't want to kill any activity, be
cause we may not always be in poor financial times. We
want a program that is soundly and broadly based.
The budget deficit, which is projected to reach 5i.25
million by August 1984, came abouj. tartly because the

Athletic Department did not receive expected televi
sion and gate revenue from the football team, which
finished the season with a 1-10 record.
The proposal involves placing each Stanford's 24 var
sity sports teams on one of three levels — Varsity I, Var
sity II and Varsity 111.
Under the proposal, 16 teams would be on top level
and would not suffer any major funding cuts, tor men,
Varsity I sports would be baseball, basketball, cross
country, golf, football, swimming, tennis and tra» k. 112 or
women, basketball, cross country, golt, gymnastics,
swimming, tennis, track and volleyball would remain at
their present capacity as Varsity I sports.
"In the Varsity II and 111 levels," Geiger said, "we will
try to provide a program that serves student needs with
athletic involvement and opportunities, although the
aspirations won't be the same."
Varsity II sports will have part
time coaching, no recruiting or
scholarships and will compete on a
local level. They would be, for men:
crew, gymnastics, sailing, soccer,
volleyball, wrestling and water polo;
for women: crew, field hockey,
sailing, soccer and softball.
All other sports would be at the
Varsity 111 level under the proposal.
These teams would operate on a
self-help basis similar to Stanford's
current club sports program. One
sport currently operating on the var

sity level that would fall to Varsity 111
under the proposal is fencing.
Bacchetti, however, emphasized
the importance of raising $300,000 to
keep sports at the Varsity II level
afloat, or "they will be at the Varsity
111 level."
Stanford co-Sports Information
Director Bob Vasquez said that
many of the coaches involved in the
proposed cuts will meet with Geiger
sometime in the next week to offer
alternatives to the solution he put
before the Board last month.
Vasquez predicted that the impact
of the proposal if it were adopted
would vary according to the teams.
"Obviously, a team with more
seniors, with more upperclassmen
than underclassmen, would be most
affected," he said.

Thus, a team such as water polo,
on which five freshmen started this
season, would be less affected im
mediately than one with more
juniors and seniors.
Athletes on scholarship for sports
dropped to Varsity II or Varsity 111
would stay on scholarship until they
are graduated, under the proposal
presented to the Board. "I want to
emphasize that Stanford will honor
its tinanical aid commitments to stu
dent athletes through graduation,"
Geiger said.
A total of 23 men's and eight wo
men's full-ride scholarships would
be cut if the program were imple
mented, according to Associate Ath
letic Director Alan Cummings.
