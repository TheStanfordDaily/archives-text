## Richter named SLAC director 
### JEFF BIDDULPH 
Prof. Burton Richter, a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist, has been
named the director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, effective
Sept. 1,1984.
Richter, 52, has been technical
director of SLAC since 1982. He will
succeed Wolfgang Panofsky, 65,
who has headed SLAC since it was
built in 1961. Panofsky will remain a
Stanford professor at SLAC, working
on accelerator problems.
Panofsky said last spring that his
decision to step down is part of an
"informal policy" at the Center
where top administrators relinquish
their jobs after turning 65.
The informal policy is followed
because "people do slow down.
You do less damage as a professor
than as a lab director," Panofsky
said.

Richter's appointment was con
firmed by the Board of Trustees
Dec. 13 after a national search. Rich

ter, who won a Nobel Prize in 1976
tor his discoveries in high-energy
physics, will oversee 1200 workers
and an annual budget of $80 million
at SLAC.
Richter said yesterday in an inter
view with The Daily that his main
concern will be "to keep SLAC a
first-rate laboratory doing first-rate
science."
Richter praised Panofsky's knowl
edge and experience, saying that
SLAC's director will be difficult to
follow because "he's been there
ever since SLAC started."
Sidney Drell, the deputy director
of SLAC, who was one of the mem
bers of the search committee that
chose the new director, said Richter
is an "outstanding scientist, a
proven administrator and a very ex
cellent machine designer and oper
ator."
