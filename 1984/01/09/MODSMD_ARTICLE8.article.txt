# Med School offers position to Soviet
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Alexander Podrabinek, a Soviet
dissident imprisoned for his inves
tigations of Soviet violations of the
Helsinki Accords, has been offered
a position as a visiting scholar at the
Medical School's Psychiatry Depart
ment. But Podrabinek, who was
reportedly released from a labor
camp Dec. 26, may not even know
of his appointment.
"I'll have to assume he does know
about the appointment," said En
glish Prof. John Felstiner, who is a
relative of Podrabinek's and has
been involved in the effort to free
the dissident. He said that prior to
Podrabinek's release he sent regis
tered letters to him, his wife and his
father telling them of the appoint
ment.
"I can't be certain that he knows
until I receive the receipts of the let
ters," Felstiner said.
Felstiner said he had received a
phone call "from a reliable source"
telling him of Podrabinek's release.
The appointment for the 30-year
old Soviet paramedic and dissident
came as the result of a letter by As
soc. Psychiatry Prof. David Spiegel.
Spiegel suggested that Podrabinek
could continue his research on psy
chiatry here and help teach a course
through the Human Biology Depart
ment on "the ecology of mental
health care." Felstiner said

Podrabinek, who speaks broken En
glish, probably could not teach a
course but might be able to lecture
on his experiences.
Podrabinek founded a group in
1977 dedicated to recording viola
tions of the Helsinki Accords. He
compiled a dossier on abuses of
psychiatry, showing how the Soviets
were using psychotherapy and
drugs to suppress dissent.
"He revealed the practice of
judging those schizophrenics who
showed anti-Soviet behavior," said
Felstiner. Podrabinek then as
sembled a book, "Punitive
Medicine", which was published in
Russian and English.
Podrabinek and his brother Kyrill
were given the opportunity to leave
the Soviet Union in 1978. They
declined, according to Felstiner, be
cause they felt their work was not
finished. The brothers then went
through a series of arrests and im
prisonments that ended with Alex
ander's three-year sentence at
Yakutsk "severe regime" labor
c^mp.
Both brothers are seriously ill:
Kyrill has tuberculosis and is cur
rently in a sanatorium, and Alexan
der has both tuberculosis and
hepatitis.
"It's a miracle he (Alexander)
survived through the winter," said
Felstiner.
Felstiner said there are many ob

stacles Alexander must overcome
before he can come to Stanford.
"First, he has to get well, then he
will want to get in touch with his
family. He has a young child he
never really has had a chance to
know."
Felstiner said that after visiting
with his family Podrabinek would
probably check on the progress of
his political movement. "He may
not even want to leave the Soviet
Union if he finds that those involved
in his movement are still im
prisoned," Felstiner said. Finally, it
is up to Soviet officials to allow Alex
ander to leave the Soviet Union.
A visiting scholar is given the op
portunity to do research here with
out paying tuition or other fees. No
stipend is provided.
Felstiner's involvement with the
Podrabineks began in 1977 when
Felstiner's grandfather read about
the Podrabineks and realized that
Podrabinek was the family name
before the Felstiners emigrated. The
Felstiner family became interested
in the brothers' plight and wrote to
the Podrabinek family asking how
they might help.
At present, the Felstiners are sup
plying the Podrabineks with money
and medicine. Over the past few
years, the Felstiners have publicized
the situation with cables, a march in
New York City, several articles writ
ten by Felstiner and work with Am
nesty International.
