# Professors question political success of Jackson mission
## 
### TROY EID 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson's celebrated Syrian mission
last week may have seized the public eye, but the
presidential aspirant's ability to capture the Demo
cratic nomination seems anything but secure, ex
perts here say.
While political commentators here debate the
motives behind Jackson's maneuvers, at least some
professors agree that the recent liberation of Air
Force Lt. Robert Goodman from Syrian captors will
probably have little bearing on the upcoming prima
ries.
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall translates
Jackson's chances into numbers.
"I'd give him a one in a million chance," Marshall
said. "He's never run for dog catcher. Mainly in na
tional politics you don't arise out of a puff of smoke
and become a serious presidential contender."
But Marshall concedes that "it's not inconceivable
that in eight years or so he'll play a more important
role in party politics," particularly in light of this
latest success.
Goodman was taken prisoner Dec. 4 after ejecting
from his crippled A-6E Intruder jet over Syrian posi
tions in Lebanon. When official negotiations broke
down, Jackson launched his own private
"humanitarian appeal." He returned a few days later
to the United States — with Goodman.
The State Department, while attempting to take
some of the credit for Goodman's release, played a
mute second fiddle. It was Jackson's day. It was Jack
son's whole week.
As History Prof. Clayborne Carson remarked, the
quest to secure Goodman's release "may have
worked out better than even Jackson expected."
But Carson noted that, from at least one perspec
tive, the Jackson mission might have succeeded
even if the negotiations for Goodman's release had
broken down.

"I think the main reason behind Jackson's trip was
to make sure that the issue of Goodman wouldn't be
ignored," Carson said. "Media attention alone was
enough to do that."
Marshall concurs that Jackson, by sharing some of
the political spotlight with Goodman, fostered a
greater awareness of the prisoner's plight.
"Ronald Reagan didn't care if Goodman remained
in prison for a thousand years," Marshall said.
Syrian President Hafez Assad did not expect to get
concessions from Reagan in return for Goodman's
freedom because present U.S. foreign policy gener
ally dictates that Washington take a tough military
posture worldwide.
Instead, while Jackson was enjoying "a million
dollars' worth of free publicity" during the Good
man negotiations, Reagan displayed "an almost
miraculous sense of public opinion" by jumping on
the bandwagon of his political rival's success, accor
ding to Marshall.
