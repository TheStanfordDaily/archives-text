## Dean Fred moves to New York: an interview 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon has announced that
he will leave Stanford in June
to become the senior vice
president of the College
Board. The Daily talked with
Hargadon last week about his
career at Stanford. Today Har
gadon discusses his future in
New York City and his reign as
dean of admissions. Tomor
row, his accomplishments, his
possible successors and his
license plates.

Daily: Why are you leaving?
Hargadon: Partly because
it's a good opportunity to
make a change, mainly to
make a change.
Daily: Does that mean you're
tired of the Stanford job?
Hargadon: Not tired of it.
Had this opportunity not pre
sented itself, I would happily
be staying. But it will be 15
years this September, so I
think it will just be interest
ing to try something new. And
you know, living in New York

City, that will be interesting.
Daily: You've been critical in
the past of the emphasis placed
on SATs in the admissions
processes of some colleges.
How does that fit in with your
new post?
Hargadon: I will still, in
cases where I think too much
emphasis is put on them,
be critical. I think they're an
important part, but just a part,
you know, one element. I
don't think people ought to
put excessive reliance on

grades, either. I happen to
believe that the best admis
sions process is the one where
you can try to get a total
picture of the applicant and
you try to go beyond the base
data such as grades to see, in
fact, what courses the grades
were earned in and how diffi
cult the grading system is at
the school and so forth.
Daily: The reason Stanford
has no admissions interview?
Hargadon: Right. I still stick
with that.
Daily: When will you be
taking the new post?
Hargadon: I'll begin in Sep
tember, so I'll probably finish
up here sometime in June,
take vacation and move
across.
Daily: And you'll be living in
New York?
Hargadon: I'll probably live
in the city. I don't want to
spend a quarter of every day
going and coming from some
place.
Daily: That will be quite a
change, living in New York.
Hargadon: It really will be,
but there are lots of things that
go on in a city that I'd like to
take advantage of, and New
York's got plenty of them,
plays and so forth.
Daily : So you will be review
ing these applications?
Hargadon: Yeah, oh sure.
I'm gonna go through this
freshman and transfer process
and then I'll be done.

Daily: In what ways do you
think you've changed Stanford's
admissions process over the past
15 years?
Hargadon: Oh, I'm not sure
I've changed it very much. I
suppose if I wanted anybody
to think we had done anything
well, it would be to show,
even though it involves large
numbers of people, within our
limits we could try and make it

a relatively personal process
and that we could still treat
each application individually
and not take the easy way out
and go to a formula, which
would save untold hours of
time. And we haven't taken
that way, which is simply to
have a formula involving CPA
or test scores, and I think
we've been able not only to
look at each application indi

vidually, but also to keep in
mind that, being a residential
university, it is crucial that the
students here represent a mix,
because half of what they get
here they're going to get from
each other. So I think, if
anything, just to try and hope
that they can keep the ship on
course.
