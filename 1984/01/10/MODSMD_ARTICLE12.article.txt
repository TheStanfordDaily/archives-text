## The 						Stanford Daily Jackson to the rescue 
### 
There was some wheat among the chaff in
the news from the Mideast last week. Rev. Jesse
Jackson, civil rights leader and Democratic
presidential candidate, triumphantly returned
from Syria with Navy Lt. Robert Goodman, who
was captured in early December after his plane
was shot down over Lebanon.
As Jackson's rivals quickly acknowledged,
the candidate must be commended. Before
Jackson left, the odds-makers, and the sup
posedly savvy political analysts, were giving
him a slim chance of success. His return with
Goodman was a personal as well as political tri
umph.
Jackson's name dominated the headlines
during the holidays. The major networks
treated Walter Mondale's address to the Na
tional Press Club, which Mondale backers
billed as an important policy speech, as a press
conference on Fritz's reaction to Jesse's mis
sion.
Yet Jackson's trip cannot be seen as primarily
an attempt to boost a lagging campaign.
Though he will certainly enjoy an increase in
popularity, charges that he was motivated en
tirely by politics are motivated by cynicism.
Though we feel that Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall's statement that "Reagan
didn't care if Goodman remained in prison for
a thousand years," is a bit exaggerated, Reagan
negotiators were not making progress on
releasing Goodman.
release, and the expected boost

in Jackson's political fortunes, could radically
change the political landscape. It is doubtful
that Jackson will be nominated by the
Democrats, but there is always the possibility
that he could be named as the nominee's run
ning mate. Jackson could, potentially, decide
that the Democratic candidate does not serve
the needs of the "rainbow coalition" of
minorities and the poor that Jackson says he
represents and choose to run on a third-party
ticket. A third-party campaign would surely
take almost all of its votes from the Democratic
party.
Despite the fact that Jackson showed up the
president by rescuing Goodman when Reagan
couldn't, the president braved a potential poli
tical fiasco and came out relatively unscathed.
The United States' ambassador to Syria,
Robert Paganelli, insisted that Jackson's trip "is
in response and is associated with the appeals
the U.S. government has made to the govern
ment of Syria for his release on humanitarian
grounds." At a press conference after Good
man's release, Paganelli refused to admit that
Jackson was responsible for expediting the
release. And Reagan's hearty congratulations
to Jackson and welcome to Goodman were
smart political moves.
Ironically, the image voters may remember
in November is not the picture of Jackson hold
ing up the hand of Goodman, but Reagan hold
ing up the hand of Goodman.
