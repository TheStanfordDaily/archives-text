Foreign policy is telling your enemies that if they
mess with you, you'll retaliate with "sevenfold" power.
Until the people and leaders in the United States
realize that rock-hard consistency can save lives and
make sense, we will be stuck in a diplomatic quagmire.

Chemical castration as a punishment for rapists is
about as moronic as . . . well, it's really crazy.

If I were a poor Mexican national with a family to
feed, and I could skip across the border to work at a
higher paying job, I would sure as heck do it. And if I
were a farm owner, I'd probably pay for the cheaper
(and harder working) labor. It would be the smart thing
to do in both situations. It would kind of be the Ameri
can way.

"Uh, well, those aren't good economic indicators.
Look at the national debt. C'mon. Look./' said the
Democrat.

A whole mess of American steelworkers were hurt
recently because many years ago, we entered into the
ridiculous and efficiency-detrimental practice of
protectionism, and if we don't start fading out that
practice, and make some kind of resolution that we
don't fade back into it, the worker is going to suffer
more and more.

In the movie, Terms of Endearment, the elder son of
Debra Winger and her husband (notice that the male is
secondary in this construction) exclaims, "Everyone
knows that Texas is best!"
And, he is correct.

But you've got to take the good with the bad. Sure,
today we are less burdened by rigid familial and social
ties than previous generations. People have more
freedom to dress, speak and act than they ever have
before. And what has this social freedom brought us? It
has brought us a profound lack of respect for the indi
vidual (a pornographic and divorce-oriented society) as
well as a profound disrespect for our environment.
Some people don't deserve freedom, because they
cannot respect the freedom of others.

Castro likes the Soviets because he has to. Let's get a
little friendlier with the Cubans and see what a new ap
proach could bring.

You've probably thought something like this before.
"Why can't big Ron and Andropov (or whoever) just
get together and have a few beers and just get mellow
and resolve all this nonsense." Or "Russian youth is
just like American youth. So let's all just forget the
'imperatives' of our elders and have a little real peace."
But you were just thinking.

Dan White is free. However screwed up our justice
system is, maybe, just maybe, it is forgiving.

Orwell wasn't even close.

Whatever the case, there are still a whole mess of
starving people around, and they could care less about
political blather. We must swim through the quagmire
to reach them, even though they are right next to us.

But I'd put my money on there being a God. I would.
