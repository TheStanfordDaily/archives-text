acceptable, if only we made sure
that it was applied to all murderers,
regardless of color.
But I agree that we don't "want
our government in the mass mur
der business." Society cannot even
call killing murderers "self
defense," since rehabilitation or
permanent incarceration would
serve equally well. Capital punish
ment is murder, and murder is
wrong, no matter who commits it.

Freshman advising
The Daily editorial on the recent
ly released results of the 1983
Senior Survey urges the University
to place a high priority on the im
provement of freshman advising. I
have the happy task of reporting to
you that over the last several years
and with the leadership, most
recently, of Associate Dean for
Undergraduate Programs Carolyn
Lougee, the very improvements you
call for have been put into place. I
agree with The Daily: These im
provements, as well as the other
resources of the Academic Informa
tion Center, need more publicity.
A major improvement has been
the simple creation of an advising
coordinator's spot at the AIC â€” the
position held by Tania Cranoff, who
takes responsibility for all of the
behind-the-scenes advising work
and who serves as an "adviser's
adviser." Her role includes answer
ing questions, providing materials,
and running information sessions
for more than 400 faculty and staff
advisers. And, as The Daily editorial
recommends, students for whom
the larger system has failed may
come to the AIC to talk over an
adviser switch with Tania when that
seems to be appropriate or
desirable.
It's crucial to say, though, that

while we ask advisers to "be in
formed and be available," and
while we provide them with kilos of
written materials, nowhere do we
ask them to know about all majors,
all requirements and all choices.
The Daily recommends that stu
dents "have someplace to go," the
AIC should be that place. Where
we do not have the answers to
advisers' and students' questions,
we hope to give a good referral to a
department or individual.
Another innovation which The
Daily recommends became a
reality, under the auspices of Vice
Provost Herant Katchadourian,
three years ago. The AIC now has,
in support of and as a complement
to freshman and sophomore advis
ing, two "on-call" advisers who are
available to meet with any under
graduate seeking academic advice.
There is, then, a kind of safety net
for students and advisers and, as
The Daily describes it, "some place
to go."
The Advising Associates Pro
gram, both student-initiated and
student-run, is an innovation which
has received financial support from
the University in tough economic
times. Very early on, the strengths
which students themselves bring to
the advising enterprise were
recognized by then Dean of Under
graduate Studies Katchadourian and
Associate Dean Diane Mid
dlebrook. They gave their early and
crucial endorsement to the AA
program and allowed it to grow
from a group of 10 students in
1978-79 to its current corps of 120 *
AAs who are paired with advisers in
every all-freshman dorm. Graduat
ing seniors will in the next few
years, I expect, begin to indicate
that the University did well to sup
port this program.
