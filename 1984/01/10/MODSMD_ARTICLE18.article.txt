## War before diplomacy is fatal 
### 
When President Reagan claimed
responsibility for the deaths of 241
Marines in Beirut he was playing a
familiar movie role: The innocent
hero who takes the rap for a crime
he didn't commit. Everyone knows
that military commanders were re
sponsible for protecting the Marines
against attack. But in assuming the
blame, Reagan has diverted atten
tion from his real crime — the fatal
decision to involve U.S. forces in
Lebanon's civil war.
The Gemayel government we sup
port chiefly represents Lebanon's
Maronite Catholics, a minority that
nevertheless controls much of the
country's wealth and political
power. The Lebanese army we
equip and train repeatedly attacks
Druze and Moslem areas but has
made no attempt to disarm the
right-wing Phalangists. The latest
outbreak of fighting occurred when
the army moved into the area of the
refugee camps in Beirut, where

Phalange militiamen murdered
hundreds of Palestinians in 1982. A
Shiite Moslem leader said his men
fought back because they feared
mass arrests and expulsion by an

The Marines who died in Beirut were victims
not only of lax security but of a president de
termined to impose a U.S. military presence
everywhere in the world, with little regard
for human life and none at all for truth.

army they regard as an ally of the
Phalangists. The Shiite are the larg
est religious group in Lebanon but
have been denied any voice in gov
ernment.
As the turmoil continues, shar
pened by the presence of Syrian and
Israeli combat forces, the 1900 U.S.
Marines can only duck under the
crossfire or provide an excuse for
shelling by the U.S. warships.
Lebanon's ambassador to the
United States, Abdullah Bouhabib,
recently admitted their presence did
not help promote stability and
diverted attention in Washington
from the need for national recon
ciliation.
What Lebanon obviously needs
most is a serious effort to find a poli
tical solution — not a display of U.S.
military might. Nevertheless,
despite opposition from the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Reagan is resolved to
keep U.S. forces in Lebanon "to lay
the foundation for future peace."
But the USS New Jersey's 2700-
pound shells can't bring about
reconciliation between Lebanon's
opposing factions. Nor will our
provocative reconnaissance flights
over Syrian-held territory reduce
tensions.
On the other hand, our support
for the Lebanese army makes the
United States an active participant in
that army's war against Moslems,
who make up the majority of
Lebanon's population. This commit

ment, along with U.S. approval of Is
rael's tightening grip on southern
Lebanon, makes a farce of our self
proclaimed role as neutral
peacekeepers. No wonder New

York Times correspondent Thomas
Friedman recently reported growing
anti-Americanism in the Middle
East, "not only among religious
militants but also among average
students, shopkeepers and business
men."
In fact, the Marines who died in
Beirut were victims not only of lax
security but of a president deter
mined to impose a U.S. military
presence everywhere in the world,
with little regard for human life and
none at all for truth; a president
who forces a police state on
Grenada to "restore democracy,"
hires Somoza's thugs to destroy
Nicaragua's food and fuel supply to
promote "freedom," and supports a
minority faction in Lebanon's civil
war and calls it "peacekeeping."
Reagan's sham acceptance of re
sponsibility obscured the most strik
ing conclusion of the Pentagon's in
vestigation into the Marines' deaths.
The Pentagon report charged that
U.S. policy in Lebanon has been
"characterized by an emphasis on
military options and the expansion
of the U.S. military role," and urged
instead "a more vigorous and de
manding approach to pursuing
diplomatic alternatives." When ex
perienced military officials accuse
Reagan of favoring war over
diplomacy, the whole world has rea
son to be alarmed.

none at all for truth; a president
who forces a police state on
Grenada to "restore democracy,"
hires Somoza's thugs to destroy
Nicaragua's food and fuel supply to
promote "freedom," and supports a
minority faction in Lebanon's civil
war and calls it "peacekeeping."
Reagan's sham acceptance of re
sponsibility obscured the most strik
ing conclusion of the Pentagon's in
vestigation into the Marines' deaths.
The Pentagon report charged that
U.S. policy in Lebanon has been
"characterized by an emphasis on
military options and the expansion
of the U.S. military role," and urged
instead "a more vigorous and de
manding approach to pursuing
diplomatic alternatives." When ex
perienced military officials accuse
Reagan of favoring war over
diplomacy, the whole world has rea
son to be alarmed.
