## Stanford takes on No. 6 UCLA Card travels to perilous Pauley 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
When Stanford meets No. 6
ranked UCLA tonight in Los
Angeles, it will be trying to do
what has been, at least for the
last 32 years, the impossible.
Stanford — 11-3 overall, but
0-2 in Pacific-10 Conference
play — will try to defeat the
Bruins in Los Angeles for the
first time since 1952, when the
Cardinal recorded a 73-71 up
set victory. But that was in
UCLA's Men's Gym.
In 12,800-seat Pauley
Pavilion, where the two teams
will play tonight at 8 p.m.,
Stanford is still looking for its
first victory. So are a lot of
other teams, as the Bruins are
276-17 in Pauley's 19-year his
tory.
Posing a bigger problem —
literally — for Cardinal Coach
Tom Davis and his troops will
be the UCLA team itself.
UCLA — 9-1 overall, 2-0 con
ference — is one of the tallest
Division I teams in the country
and Stanford, especially with
out injured 6-foot-9 Hans Wic
hary, is one of the smallest.
The Bruins starting front line
checks in at 7-0, 6-8 and 6-7,
while the Card is expected to
go with starters at 6-7, 6-5 and
6-2.
"We've got to stop their
inside game," Davis said. "If
they get it to (6-11 Brad)
Wright, (6-8 Gary) Maloncon,
(6-7 Kenny) Fields and (7-0
Stuart) Gray, it will be all
over."
Stanford's hopes to stay in
the Pac-10 race and gain an in
vitation to a post-season

tournament may be also over
if it doesn't start winning
soon.
The Cardinal dropped two
close games last Thursday and
Saturday to No. 15 ranked
Oregon State, 64-59, and
Oregon, 79-78. Both losses
could have been Stanford vic
tories had it not been for some
costly turnovers in the late
going.
"It hurt them (the team),"
Davis said of the two Pac-10
losses, "because they
recognized that we could have
won both of them.
"We're really playing pretty
well. But we just ran into
teams that shot so well against
us in the second half."
Oregon State was a searing 80
percent (16-of-20) from the
floor in the second half
Thursday night and Oregon
was even hotter in the second
period Saturday, shooting 81
percent (17-of-21).
To keep the field goal per
centages down tonight, Davis
and company will have to
force UCLA to shoot from the
outside, and will probably play
a compact zone defense.
The Bruins, conversely, will
try to get the ball inside to
senior Ail-American Fields,
last year's Pac-10 Player of the
Year, and junior seven-footer
Stuart Gray. Fields leads UCLA
with an average of 14.5 points
per game while Gray is scoring
at a 10.5 clip and pulling down
a team-high 7.4 rebounds an
outing.
The other front-line starter


Greg Webb/Daily
Kenny Fields
for UCLA is Maloncon, a
junior averaging 9.3 points
and 4.5 rebounds a contest. In
the backcourt, senior Ralph
Jackson (9.5 points and 6.4 as
sists) and redshirt freshman
Montel Hatcher (6.5 points)
are expected to get the start
ing call.
Davis said he won't use any
slowdown tactics against the
heavily favored Bruins. "We
aren't going to do anything
differently, just try to do it bet
ter," he explained.
Stanford forward Steve
Brown, however, thinks the
Card can outhustle the Bruins.
"Talent-wise (and size-wise),
we don't match up," he said,
"but if we play hard, I think
we can win."
Brown has provided a good
deal of Stanford's scoring
punch from the outside
recently and is the Card's
second-\eadmg scorer in Pac
-10 play, averaging 17.4 points a
game. Jones leads the team
with a 20.6 overall average
(18.5 in Pac-10), while center
John Revelli is collecting 17.8
points (13.5 in Pac-10) and a
team-high 7.3 rebounds per
game.
Although Davis said after

Saturday's loss to Oregon that
he may make some changes in
the starting line-up, he
decided to keep it the same,
with point guard Keith Ramee
and forward Earl Koberlein
joining Brown, Jones and
Revelli.
He did indicate that fresh
man guards Novian Whitsitt
and John Paye would see their
most playing time of the
season tonight. Freshman
Doug Wall and junior Kent
Seymour could also see consi
derable action, according to
Davis.
One thing Davis won't have
to worry about is getting his
team mentally prepared for
the Bruins. "I think UCLA is
the easiest team in the world
to get 'up' for. We'll be ready
for them."
The game will be broadcast
on television both on a live
and tape-delay basis. ESPN,
the 24-hour sports cable, and
KFTY (Channel 50) from Santa
Rosa will carry it live. Although
Channel 50 is difficult to
receive from the Stanford
area, the game will also be
shown at 11 p.m. on San Jose's
KSTS (Channel 48), which can
be received at Stanford.
As usual, KSFO (560 AM)
and KZSU (90.1 FM) will broad
cast the game live at 8 p.m. on
radio.
