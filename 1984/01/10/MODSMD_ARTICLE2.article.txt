## Arms center funded 
### BAIE NETZER 
I he war against nuclear war escalated last month
when the Carnegie Foundation of New York an
nounced that it will give Stanford's Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control nearly a million dol
lars to promote the study of arms control there.
!he $905,750 gra.it, the largest the Carnegie Founda
tion has ever given for the study of arms control, will be
used to fund an international crisis center and a fellow
ship program and to pay some of the center's adminis
trative expenses, according to Sidney Drell, newly
named co-director of the center and current deputy
director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
Besides the fellowship and crisis programs, we also
have administrative costs which need to he taken care
of, Drell said, "so the grant will help us in covering
those costs."
fhe University was notified of the grant last month
after a Carnegie Corporation board reviewed a pro
posal to add to the center's activities.
Political Science Prof. Alexander George will head
the U.S.-Soviet crisis prevention and management proj
ect funded by the grant.
George cited the Berlin crisis of 1948, the Cuban

Missile crisis and especially the current crisis in
Lebanon as case studies for crises involving the super
powers.
"Of course, the good thing is that the U.S. and the
Soviets have never had a direct confrontation, so we've
been successful to that extent, " George said.
The Carnegie-funded project will study the means to
successfully avoid "the intense situaton of war" in con
flicts of interest between the superpowers, as well as
the means for ending such a conflict "just in case we
ever got into that situation," George said.
The Carnegie grant will also support two or three fel
lowships annually for scientists interested in research
ing arms control at the center.
According to Coit Blacker, associate director of the
center, formal applications for next year's fellowships
will be available soon and decisions on acceptance are
expected by April.
We're looking for mid-career scientists who have
achieved distinction in their fields and are interested in
a more sophisticated look at the political and strategic
side of arms control," Drell explained.
A number of informal applications were received im
mediately following the news of the grant, Drell said.
