Pittsburgh (AP) — Heisman Trophy-winning running back
Mike Rozier has been signed to a "generous" contract by the
expansion Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football
League, the team announced today.
The Maulers, seeking instant credibility in a city whose foot
ball loyalty belongs to the Steelers of the National Football
League, reportedly signed the University of Nebraska star to a
guaranteed, three-year contract worth about $3 million.
The contract makes Rozier the second highest-paid player in
professional football behind Herschel Walker, another Heisman
Trophy running back who signed with the USFL's New Jersey
Generals last year.
"He could make our franchise," Maulers General Manager
George Heddleston said of Rozier before a news conference
called to announce his signing.
Neither Rozier, who is in lapan for a college all-star game, nor
his agent, attorney Mike Trope of Los Angeles, attended the
news conference.
But Rozier said in a statement released by the Maulers that he
was "extremely happy" to join the USFL and "grateful" to
Maulers owner Edward Deßartolo "for the generous offer he
made."
"My contract with Pittsburgh enables me to have financial se
curity, which was very important to me and my representatives
when we first began discussing a professional football con
tract," Rozier said in the statement.
"I hope to buy a new house for my parents and then we'll
have my financial advisers make investment recommendations
to me," Rozier said.
"Once I signed, I felt relieved and happy we were able to
complete the deal so quickly," he said.
The Maulers, who play their first game on Feb. 26 against the
Oklahoma Outlaws, made Rozier the first choice in last Wed
nesday's USFL draft.
But the team, at its news conference, announced that it
signed Rozier last Tuesday afternoon, the day before the USFL
draft. The Maulers were scheduled to have the first pick in the
draft.
