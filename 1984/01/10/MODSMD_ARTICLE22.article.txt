### TRASK LEONARD 
Friday's Irojan-Bruin Tourn
ament brought strikingly
familiar results lor the wo
men's goll team: an individual
championship for freshman
k.ithy McCarthy and a second
place team finish to the
Arizona State Sun Devils.
McCarthy and fellow Car
dinal Kathy Kostas tied for low
individual honors with a three
round total of 220, taking the
two players to a sudden death
playoff, in which McCarthy
won on the second hole at
dusk
On the team level, Coach
Tim Baldwin's players had
trouble against a very talented
ASU squad, as they have all
year long, finishing this time at
a distant 918, behind the
Devils' 905.
In the individual tourna
ment, behind McCarthy and
Kostas were Kandi Kessler
from North Carolina at 221 and
Pip Barry of US International
University (USIU) at 222.
Laurette Maritz of USIU and
Kelli Antolock of Brigham
Young tied for fifth at 226.
UCLA captured third place
team honors at 922, with
North Carolina at 925 and

USIU at 928. Other finishing
scores were San Jose State at
943 and USC at 948.
McCarthy, with her second
win of the season, is setting
the west coast college golf cir
cuit on fire. Her rounds of 75-
70-75 over the Mission Hills
Country Club course in Palm
Springs were highlighted by a
courageous finish. At the last
hole, McCarthy made a six
foot, tricky, downhill putt to
tie for first with Kostas.
"I had been putting poorly
during the tournament, but
when I approached that last
putt, I felt good, and made it,"
explained McCarthy."And
with that added confidence, I
felt great in the playoff with
Kathy (Kostas). It was really
tough playing against a
teammate for the title,
though, since we all pull for
each other along the way."
With another outstanding
finish, the Cardinal boosted its
chances for an NCAA playoff
berth. Yet a win, especially
over ASU, could almost assure
Stanford a spot.
The women golfers will next
put their skills on the line
February 13 at the Arizona In
tercollegiate in Tucson.
