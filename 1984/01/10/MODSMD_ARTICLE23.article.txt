## 'Scarface' remarkably uninteresting and senseless 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The philosophy underlying
naturalistic acting has always
been that the authenticity of
surface detail will provide vital
clues to the heart of a charac
ter. However, in recent
movies some of the most
prodigiously talented Ameri
can actors — Robert De Niro,
Al Pacino, Meryl Streep —
have somehow managed to
make the surface convincing
while stopping up our access
to the core.
Retaining a character's
"enigma" has become a virtue
surpassing that of admitting
the audience into his or her in
ner workings. Yet among the
best work in last year's films,
American and non-American,
are performances that unearth
layer after layer of a charac
ter's psyche and still don't
"solve" the mystery for us.
I'm thinking of Ben Kingsley as
the cuckolded husband in
Betrayal, Linda Hunt as the
Chinese-Indonesian photog
rapher in The Year of Living
Dangerously, Ed Harris as John
Glenn in The Right Stuff.
Walking away from these
pictures, we can't say the
characters have been
analyzed, simplified, but we
certainly can say we've been
taken inside them. The same is
no longer true of Robert De
Niro's performances, though
it once was. And since De Niro
played repellent men in
Raging Bull and The King of
Comedy, his refusal to open
up to us seemed (especially in
the latter) like an act of aggres
sion against the audience —
an almost offensive way of
making unattractive characters
even more forbidding. Long
before the end of The King of
Comedy, we wanted nothing
more to do with De Niro's
slimy Rupert Pupkin.
The enthusiasm with which
this new opaque acting is of
ten greeted, by critics and by
what used to be called "art
house audiences," suggests a
confusion about what defines
good naturalistic acting, and a
danger that more and more
actors will choose to cut off
the emotional construction of
their performances just at the
crucial moment — when we
might be able to understand
it.
An astute actress friend of
mine, commenting on Meryl
Streep's portrayal of Karen
Silkwood, said she was sure
Streep assembles brilliant
biographies for herself of all
the women she plays, that you
can see dozens of thought im
pulses creasing her brow in
every scene, but she doesn't
let many of them through.

And certainly I can see that
Robert Duvall did his
homework for the role of the
broken-down Texas country
and western singer in Tender
Mercies, which is why you
hear so many sympathetic
reactions to his acting
(especially from musicians and
Texans, who are best qualified
to judge his authenticity). But
Duvall's performance is last
year's champion example of
"The Emperor's New
Clothes": he's got all the su
perficial details right, every
time he stares into the camera
(and maybe no one since
Carbo has been so good at the
Significant Gaze) people
swear he's acting. But Duvall
actually tells you so little in
those looks that everything he
says and does in the picture —
telling Tess Harper he loves
her, or getting baptized —
comes as a shock.
An excellent example of the
look that means less than it ap
pears to mean arrives early in
Brian De Palma's updated
Scarface. The hero, Tony Mon
tana (Al Pacino), is a Cuban
gangster, one of the emigres
Castro sent to America's
shores during Carter's term of
office, whose willingness to
carry out a revenge murder for
a rich Floridian Cuban
prompted his release from a
detention camp and landed
him in Miami.
Tony and his pal (and fellow
assassin) Manolo (Steven
Bauer), fed up with their dish
washing jobs, are given a
chance to improve their status
a second time by picking up a
shipment of cocaine for the
same wealthy hood, Frank
Lopez (Robert Loggia). When
one of Frank's men asks Tony
if he knows anything about
cocaine, he pauses, looks long
and hard at his interrogator,
and answers in the affirmative.
Are we meant to read Tony's
ignorance and nervousness
into that pause and that look?
If so, nothing in his subse
quent actions, either as a gun
sel or as a coke runner, bears
this out.
Once you get used to
Pacino's accent, which may t
sound at first like a Cuban
comedy routine, you don't
question the believability of
anything he does. He's a solid,
thoughtful actor, and he
knows how to mesmerize a
camera. There's a frenzied
comic belligerence to his per
formance, too, that gives the
movie practically its only fun
ny moments, like the ag
gressive way he dances with
Michelle Pfeiffer (as Lopez's
mistress Elvira), willfully dis
regarding the beat.

What you do question is the
reason for Tony's violent,
sociopathic behavior, which is
as much a given here as it is
for Harry Callahan in the Dirty
Harry films. The only hints we
get about Tony's past are in
the information he gives U.S.
Immigration about his Yankee
father and his prison record,
and it's probably mostly lies;
we never learn what makes
him so eager to shed blood or
so immovable in high pressure
situations (he watches a friend
being chainsawed next to him
and doesn't flinch), or so

jealous of any man who
touches his sister Gina (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio).
Oliver Stone's script tells us
that Tony lusts after her, and
— in the movie's most out
rageously bad, pseudo
operatic scene — she
proclaims it herself after he
has gunned down her hus
band.
But nothing in Pacino's per
formance confirms this view,
which was lifted from the 1932
Howard Hawks-Ben Hecht
Scarface (where it made sense,
because Paul Muni and Ann
Dvorak played the brother and
sister as psychological twins).
Pacino's brick-wall macho act
is finally self-defeating. By the
second hour we have grown
exasperated with his refusal to
let his guard down, and
Steven Bauer, with his infec
tious crooked-banana grin and
his sudden, precise explos
ions of violence, has stolen al
most every scene from him.

Transposing Scarface to the
Cuban-run drug scene in
Miami was a smashing idea,
but the movie is an almost
total disaster, and it drags
along for two hours and 45
minutes. Oliver Stone must
have had in mind a Codfather
-like epic about immigrant
gangsters carrying the seed of
a drug empire to America.
There are obvious parallels to
the Godfather films in Tony's
rise to respectability as he ac
quires power, in the disin
tegration of his marriage and
his family.

But Stone, who also wrote
the screenplay for Midnight
Express, doesn't think in
novelistic terms. He goes on
the assumption that if a
picture is big enough, it will
transform itself magically into
an epic. And for once Brian De
Palma abandons his own style
and chains himself to the
crummy material — De Palma,
who could infuse trash like
Carrie and The Fury with so
much perverse wit that they
became master examples of a
new high baroque.
Sidney Lumet was originally
set to direct Scarface,and De
Palma wasn't in on the
storyboarding, which no
doubt has a lot to do with the
anonymous look and feel of
the movie. But couldn't he
have given it a little energy, at
least, or a unifying spirit?
While some sequences try
for vintage Coppola, several
— like the squealing coward's

death of Frank Lopez and
three scenes involving Tony's
tough, disgusted mother —
take us back to the worst
platitudes of the era the
original Scarface came out of
(platitudes, incidentally, that
F-lawks and Hecht mostly
avoided). Scenes that cry out
for satire have no tone at all:
When Tony tells the coke
snorting ice princess Elvira he
wants her to be the mother of
his children, you expect her to
stare in fascinated disbelief,
like Cybill Shepherd in Taxi
Driver when De Niro asks her
on a date, but instead she
grows very serious and asks,
"But what about Frank?"
Then all of a sudden, as the
movie winds into its third
hour, it goes completely
haywire, with Tony dipping his
beak into mounds of cocaine
and expiring in a gargantuan
sAvimming pool after liquidat
ing — single-handedly — doz
ens of meticulously trained
gunsmen. By this time,
however, we're too bewil
dered and too exhausted to
enjoy the gaudiness of these
sequences, and too frustrated
to give any points to a movie
that suddenly decides to

confuse outlandish spectacle
with style.
De Palma has a reputation
for exulting in violence, and
when Scarface received an 'X'
rating and had to be trimmed
to have it changed to an 'R'
rating, many people must
have nodded in smug agree
ment that Hollywood's bad
boy was at it again.
But the problem with
Scarface isn't that it's too
violent; it's that the violence
has been plunked in the
middle of a non-movie, and so
of course it seems excessive
and offensive. It doesn't say
anything about America or
syndicated crime, the way the
killings in The Godfather did,
because the movie itself is
banal and pointless. And it's
not even well directed vio
lence, for the most part — you
get the impression that De
Palma either went straight off
track from the outset or just
threw in the towel.
When I say the movie is
pointless, I don't mean to sug
gest that it's free from pedan
ticism. On the contrary, it has
a clunky thesis-play sen
sibility, only the thesis keeps
shifting. For a while it appears

to be a comedy about a low
class hood who makes it rich
enough in the dope racket to
become a force in Florida high
society but never shakes off
his vulgarity. (Bob Hoskins'
portrayal of the gangster
protagonist in the English film
The Long Good Friday accom
plished something like that.)
The next thing you know,
Tony and Elvira are battling it
out in a restaurant, where he
shows his dissatisfaction with
the lifestyle he's clawed to the
top of the ladder for and she
calls them both "losers." By
the end of the scene he's lec
turing the other patrons, ex
horting them in a mocking
tone to "say goodbye to the
bad guy." Stone and De Palma
imply here that it's American
society that is corrupt, and
Tony is merely an emblem of
it. But most of the final hour
carries a simpler message:
Don't use cocaine, because
see what terrible things it does
to you! Who could have
guessed that a two-and-three
quarter-hour movie by Brian
De Palma, set in the Miami un
derworld, would turn out to
be so monumentally unin
teresting?
