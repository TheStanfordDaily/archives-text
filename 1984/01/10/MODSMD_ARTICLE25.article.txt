# Economist blasts Federal Reserve Board

There's no love lost between Hoover Senior
Research Fellow Milton Friedman and the
Federal Reserve Board.
"The Fed has had a terrible record of perfor
mance. As an alcoholic says he hates alcohol
and is drunk every night, so the Fed says it hates
inflation but produces it," Friedman told stu
dents in an Undergraduate Special class last
month.
"I have no doubt whatsoever that the United
States would have been better off if the Fed had
never existed," the famed economist said in a
guest appearance in Contemporary Issues in
Economics.
Friedman, who blames the Federal Reserve
Board for both the Great Depression and the in
flation during and after World War 11, said, "The
crucial thing is to distinguish between the
nominal and real amount of money, the national
income — or dollars, versus the real income —
or how much purchasing power. This distinc
tion is the source of great confusion."
Friedman repeated his well-known statement
that "inflation is always and everywhere a mon-

etary phenomenon." He explained that al
though the Federal Reserve Board creates a
large amount of paper money during a period of
inflation, there is small quantity of real money.
"The more money created, the less there ac
tually is," he said.
Friedman said that the rate of growth of
money determines what happens to income.
"It is very hard for people to take into account
what will happen in two years," he said. "It is
very tempting to adjust money to lean against
wind that's blowing today. We should lean not
against the wind that's blowing today, but that's
blowing six months from now. We re very bad
at determining that."
Friedman's main goal is to achieve slow,
steady monetary growth.
"My recommendation is that the particular
definition of money grow three to five percent
year after year — with such a policy we would
have had no inflation over the past 25 years, and
a stable economy," he said.
Although the Federal Reserve Board has used
monetary rhetoric, Friedman contends it has
not followed monetary policy. In fact, the board
has followed the "opposite of a monetarist

prescription," and has been very unstable, he
said .
"The trend of inflation is up on a
rollercoaster. The peaks and troughs are higher
and lower than the preceeding peaks and
troughs,"he said.
According to Freidman, inflation is now on its
way up, and he predicts a six to nine percent in
crease tor 1984. "The most we can hope for is a
downward rollercoaster of inflation," he said.
"We either step on the brake too hard or on
the accelerator ... it doesn't take hold right
away. This is identical to the Fed's attempt to
speed up the recession by speeding up the
money supply.
"I'm trying to influence the Fed to take their
foot off the brake," he continued. "They're not
bad people, but they have been the architects of
inflation without wanting to be."
Friedman complained about the lack of
restraint imposed upon the Fed. "There is no
bottom line or budget restraint. Virtually no one
is fired during a 14-year term," he said.
When asked if he would accept a position as
head of the Federal Reserve Board, Friedman
joked, "If I turned it down, I'd have to shut up. I
couldn't go on criticizing the Fed."
