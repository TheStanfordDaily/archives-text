# Plans proceed for permanent toxic waste handling facility

Designs are "moving well along"
for a new environmental safety
facility which will handle the Univer
sity's hazardous waste materials, ac
cording to Joan Kojola, University
health and safety specialist.
The Board of Trustees allocated
funds for the center at its October
meeting and chose a site for the
project at its Dec. 12 meeting.
7 he $6 million needed to build the
center will come from the Univer
sity's unrestricted construction
funds, the Medical School and Stan
ford University Hospital.

The new center, which will be
built on a plot bounded by Campus
Drive, Willow Road, Pasteur Drive
and Searsville Road, will consist of
three low-lying buildings including
offices, classroom areas and waste
handling facilities that are now scat
tered around campus. A facility for
the safe preparation of hazardous
wastes for off-campus disposal is a
requirement of the state and local
governments.
There is a temporary facility on
campus for this purpose. However,
it received its two-year permit in
1982 with a one-year extension,
meaning that it has only about one

more year of operation.
Before the temporary center was
built, private contractors picked up
the waste and properly treated and
disposed of it. With the present cen
ter and with the new one being
planned, the waste is treated on
campus and is then picked up by the
contractors for disposal at the Ket
tleman Hills Dump Sites.
The new center will handle
three types of wastes: biological
waste from the Medical Center;
chemical waste from research labs,
maintenance shops and other
campus areas; and radioactive
wastes from biological research and
medical treatment.
Planners are taking measures to
prevent any sort of problem occur
ring with the dangerous substances
the facility will handle. At least one
safeguard has been taken for every
conceiveable disaster, the planners
say, from vandalism to earthquakes
to staff errors.

The facility's incinerators will be
equipped for clean combustion, and
other anti-pollution devices are
being planned. Because the
amounts of the wastes and the levels
of radiation are so small, the risks in
volved are also very limited, plan
ners say.
The Board of Trustees has ap
proved a plan for the University to
underwrite the value of 13 faculty
and staff homes in the vicinity of the
new center, backing up the Univer
sity's stand that the facility will not
affect the surrounding area.
