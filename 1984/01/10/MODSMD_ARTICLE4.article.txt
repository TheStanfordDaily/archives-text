# Trustees approve new genetic, NMR centers
## 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
The Board of Trustees gave the
Medical Center the go-ahead Dec.
13 to develop two new major pro
grams that promise dramatic
changes for medicine in the areas of
basic and clinical research.
The two programs authorized by
the trustees will focus on molecular
and genetic medicine and on nu
clear magnetic resonance. The trus
tees' action allows Medical Center
officials to proceed with plans for
buildings to house research in both
areas.
The proposed Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Center is the larger of
the two programs. The center will
provide 11,000 net square feet of
space for basic and clinical research
and will consolidate space for fac
ulty members currently working in
various departments throughout the
University.
Nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) refers to the distinguishing of
different atoms and molecules after
exposure to a strong magnetic field.
In clinical use, this phenomenon
gives information about body
chemistry and physiology. NMR im
aging promises to be one of the
most important diagnostic dis
coveries since the x-ray as its appli
cations become more clear.
The NMR Center will be devoted
to developing new applications in
medicine related to NMR, according
to Oleg Jardetzky, professor of
pharmocology and chairman of the
project. The center will house up to
five NMR instruments and facilities
for patient-related research, as well

as laboratory and office space.
"The Center will provide an in
formational and intellectual center
where interested personnel from
around the country can collaborate
on their work," Jardetzky said. "We
hope that it will become one of the
leading facilities of its type in the
world."
The operations of the Center will
be directed by Jardetzky, Dr. Jack
Barchas of the Psychiatry depart
ment, and Dr. William Brody of the
Radiology department. The NMR
Center will combine programs un
der each director, dealing primarily
with the specific applications of
anatomical imaging and non
invasive studies of metabolism.
jardetzky said he hopes to break
ground on the building this fall, with
construction expected to take about
a year.
The other program will be housed
in a Center for Molecular and Ge
netic Medicine. The new building
will provide laboratory space for 15
to 20 new facuty members recruited
from outside the University, as well
as alleviate the shortage of research
space available to the current fac
ulty.
Research there will include efforts
to understand the structure and
function of genetic material at the
molecular level, in addition to basic
investigations in areas of immunol
ogy, and developmental and cellular
biology.
Special emphasis will be placed
on studying a variety of diseases and
disorders, including cancer.
The Center for Molecular and Ge-
netic Medicine will consist of 75,000
net square feet of laboratory space
and an additional 24,000 net square
foot animal research facility. The
project's schedule calls for con
struction beginning in the fall of
1985, with completion by the fall of
1987.
"The program is expected to
speed the pace of anticipated re
search advances in the field," Pur

pura said."lt should be one of the
more stellar programs of its kind,
unique in the field of molecular and
genetic medicine."
Both centers will be located
southwest of the medical center.
Funding for the NMR Center will be
provided by a combination of
private gifts, federal grants and debt
financing totaling approximately
$9.5 million. Funds for the Center
for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine, estimated to cost $45 to
$56 million, will come from both
public and private sources.
