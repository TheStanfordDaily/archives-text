Reagan to ignore report
Washington—President Reagan plans to
ignore an upcoming recommendation by the
Kissinger Commission on Central America
that future military aid to El Salvador be con
ditioned on improved human rights behavior
by that government, his spokesman said yes
terday.
One member of the special panel, Robert
Strauss, declared that "the administration is
already publicly walking away from signifi
cant elements of the report" before it has
even been made public
Asked whether Reagan would reject

human rights, spokesman Larry Speakes
said, "He would be inclined so, yes."
Speakes noted that the administration will
voluntarily submit a report to Congress on
the human rights situation in El Salvador next
Monday.
Strauss, a former Democratic national
chairman and President Carter's special trade
representative, assailed Speakes' comment,
saying it was improper to reject elements of
the panel's work "before it has even been
delivered to the president."
"This report came from a bipartisan com
mission appointed by the president that
labored long and earnestly," said Strauss,
"Its makeup represented a broad cross
section of points of views in this country. Of
course, none of us agreed on all aspects of

the report, but I think the final work . . .
represents a valuable contribution.
"It deserves serious consideration," he
said. "I expect to support it. I realize the
president possibly was not personally in
volved (in the position declared by Speakes),
but if those who speak for the president
thought he was setting a rubber-stamp com
mission, they did not properly assess either
the independence or the integrity of the indi
viduals he appointed."
