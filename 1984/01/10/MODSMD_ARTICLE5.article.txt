Reagan to ignore report
Washington—President Reagan plans to
ignore an upcoming recommendation by the
Kissinger Commission on Central America
that future military aid to El Salvador be con
ditioned on improved human rights behavior
by that government, his spokesman said yes
terday.
One member of the special panel, Robert
Strauss, declared that "the administration is
already publicly walking away from signifi
cant elements of the report" before it has
even been made public
Asked whether Reagan would reject
linking aid to El Salvador to progress on

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

human rights, spokesman Larry Speakes
said, "He would be inclined so, yes."
Speakes noted that the administration will
voluntarily submit a report to Congress on
the human rights situation in El Salvador next
Monday.
Strauss, a former Democratic national
chairman and President Carter's special trade
representative, assailed Speakes' comment,
saying it was improper to reject elements of
the panel's work "before it has even been
delivered to the president."
"This report came from a bipartisan com
mission appointed by the president that
labored long and earnestly," said Strauss,
"Its makeup represented a broad cross
section of points of views in this country. Of
course, none of us agreed on all aspects of

the report, but I think the final work . . .
represents a valuable contribution.
"It deserves serious consideration," he
said. "I expect to support it. I realize the
president possibly was not personally in
volved (in the position declared by Speakes),
but if those who speak for the president
thought he was setting a rubber-stamp com
mission, they did not properly assess either
the independence or the integrity of the indi
viduals he appointed."
Former EPA official sentenced
Washington—Former Environmental
Protection Agency official Rita Lavelle was
sentenced yesterday to six months in prison
and fined $10,000 tor lying to Congress about
her handling of the government's $1.6 billion
toxic waste cleanup program.
Lavelle, 36, could have been sentenced to
a maximum of 20 years and a fine of $19,000.
U.S. District ludge Norma Johnson told
Lavelle before handing down the sentence
that the judge had considered "the fact that
you violated your public trust . . . and the
fact that you cannot still admit to yourself the
injury you caused the federal government
. . . and all the citizens of this country."
Lavelle's lawyer, James Bierbower, had
asked that she not be incarcerated or fined
but ordered instead to perform community
service, possibly for charitable organizations
in her home state of California.
"I don't think jail would benefit the public
here," Bierbower said.
For the government, Justice Department
attorney C. Allen Carver asked the judge to
require at least some time behind bars. He
said the court should recognize "that public
officials have a very high responsibility . . .
and can't fob it all off later by saying it was all
a mistake."
Human rights policy 'failure'
New York—The Reagan administration acts
as an apologist for friendly countries violat
ing human rights and thus has undermined
the fight for those rights in some nations,
three human rights groups said yesterday.

Americas Watch, Helsinki Watch and the
Lawyers Committee for International Human
Rights analyzed the impact on 23 countries of
the administration's human rights policy.
"Except in a handful of cases, it has failed
to promote human rights," read a 106-page
report entitled, "Failure: The Reagan Admin
istration's Human Rights Policy in 1983."
"The President himself takes the lead (as
an apologist) as when he suggests that death
squad murders in El Salvador might actually
be the work of the left seeking to discredit
the government," the report said.
The organizations were especially critical
of Elliott Abrams, assistant Secretary of State
for Human Rights, who oversees the Reagan
administration's human rights policy.
U.S. — Vatican ties forged
Washington—Administration officials said
late yesterday that President Reagan has
decided to establish full diplomatic relations
with the Vatican, a step spurned by the
United States over the last 117 years in the
face of Protestant opposition.
A formal announcement was expected
today. United States officials, who asked not
to be identified, said Reagan would nominate
William Wilson as the nation's first ambassa
dor to the Holy See. The Vatican will in turn
appoint an ambassador, known as a papal
nuncio, to Washington.
Wilson, 69, is a California real estate
developer who has long had close ties to
Reagan. He was appointed by Reagan as his
"personal representative" to the Vatican
soon after taking office in 1981.
The administration will take the position
that diplomatic ties won't confer special

status on the Roman Catholic Church and
therefore won't violate the Constitutional re
quirement tor the separation of church and
state, the officials said.
The United States has had informal ties
with the Vatican during much of its history,
and had formal diplomatic relations from
1848 to 1867. Even in that period, there was
no exchange of full ambassadors.
Protestant opposition had restrained previ
ous presidents from establishing diplomatic
ties, especially after a storm of protest forced
President Harry Truman to back down from
such a move in 1951.
But the Reagan administration had con
cluded that the value of formal ties to the
Vatican and the global, humanitarian role of
Pope John Paul II outweighs such opposi
tion.

New York—Stock prices turned downward
