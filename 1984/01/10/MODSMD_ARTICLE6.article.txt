# Vans upgrade Marguerite service
## 
### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
A host of changes for the Mar
guerite bus system culminated last
week as eight brightly painted,
Cardinal-red minibuses took to the
campus streets.
The most obvious of the changes
has occurred in the vehicles them
selves, changed from bulky, expen
sive buses to plush minibuses. Plan
ners say the new 15-seat vans will
save money — carrying more riders
for approximately the same money
— as well as provide comforts such
as air conditioning and radios.
A new, expanded route, goes
along with the new buses. Serving
the Shopping Center, the Barn, Jor
dan Quad and the Roble/Terman
area, it nearly doubled the area
covered previously by Marguerite.
Along with the convenience af
forded by the larger route, students
will no longer have to chase the
buses in order to board them. Fifty
one stops have been placed upon
the route, marked by signs coded in
the color of the line. The blue and
purple lines run on the various
campus routes and the green line
goes as far as the train station.
But while the circle-like routes are
longer, the wait for a bus should not
be. Buses will now run in both direc
tions, eliminating the need to have
to ride the long way around the loop
and making the maximum wait be
tween buses about 10 minutes.
The new system, which has been
in the planning stages for a year, will
cost approximately $300,000 a year
to operate. Parking sticker fees will
provide the funds.
According to Susan Termohlen,


112 ROM HORSES TO VANS: The fleet of eight shiny red vans, like the one above, that have replaced the old
Marguerite buses will save on gas bills without sacrificing passenger comfort. Along with the new mini buses
comes an expanded route, more stops and less time between buses. The new logo, nelow, was professionally
designed to publicize the new buses and routes.

manager of programs for the Com
mittee on Parking Transportation,
the changes were made for the good
of the system.
"Everyone thought that it was
good and necessary to have a
campus shuttle," Termohlen said,

"but the one we had just wasn't
working."
In order to publicize the new sys
tem, Termohlen employed a profes
sional designer to create Marguerite
logos, maps and signs.
In another promotional effort,
Marguerite riders will be given tick
ets for a ]an. 25 raffle, with prizes in
cluding gift certificates and a lunch
with University President Donald
Kennedy.
