# Millard Fillmore's trivial birthday
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
For some, it's a time of joy. For
some, a time of sadness. And for
some, it's a time of great aggrava
tion.
Yes, it is Millard Fillmore's
birthday once again — and the an
nual Millard Fillmore Trivia Contest
concluded last night, drawing
cheers and cries from the high
school teams involved, and sighs of
relief from Stanford librarians.
The Millard Fillmore Trivia contest

was started 16 years ago by Bob
Hunter, a high school teacher and
fan of one of the nation's most
obscure presidents, who believed
the contest would be an exercise in
research. Since then, the contest
has expanded to include about 16
local schools and about 20 teams.
All of the teams are given the
same set of problems — a number
of trivia questions they must answer
and a number of objects they must
find. According to David Huddles
ton, a Palo Alto High School senior,
this year's questions included such
gems as, "Who was the winner of
the 10th annual singing dog contest
on 'The Tonight Show?' " and
"Who was the first American
diplomat to have a flower named
after him?" One of the objects
asked for this year was a piece of
memorabilia from the 1964
presidential campaign — anything
but a pin.

To answer the trivia questions,
students scour the local libraries.
Since Stanford has some of the best
reference material in the area, Bob
Kieft, acting head of Meyer Library,
said that Meyer Library has annually
been disrupted by the hunt.
"They tend to do the contest in
groups," he said, explaining that the
students were not only noisy, but
they often tried to get the reference
librarians to help them with the
questions.
Because they are given the same
set of problems, the teams try both
to answer the questions and to

prevent other teams from getting
the answers. According to Kieft, the
trivia buffs have hidden reference
materials in the past, and have even
torn pages out of books to dis
courage the competition.
Because of the notoriety of the
Fillmore contest, Meyer was
closed Friday to everyone not carry
ing a Stanford I.D. According to Nic
holas Targ, a Paly High senior who
has been involved with the contest
for seven years, his team used the
Foothill College Library and the Palo
Alto main library when they found

Meyer Library closed.
Sometimes a little bit of conniving
is used to gain access to facilities
closed by wary librarians. A guard at
The Penninsula Times Tribune on
Sunday night said that "a group
from Stanford" was using the
paper's reference libraries. The
group turned out to be a team of
anonymous Fillmorites.
According to Targ, that kind of
misrepresentation is "frequently
done" by some teams. "Millard Fill
more kind of has a bad reputation,
he explained.
