## Hyperthermia therapy puts the heat on cancer 
### ALEX TARG 
Scientists at the Med Center
are blazing trails by using a
new high-technology cancer
treatment using ultrasound in
the treatment of brain tumors.
Though the new technique
has thus far only been used on
animals, researchers expect
the treatment will have a sig
nificant impact on children.
Cancer is the second most
common cause of death in
children; and brain tumors
rank only behind leukemia in

frequency among child can
cer.
A research group, led by Dr.
Richard Britt, assistant profes
sor of neurosurgery, uses a
technique called hyperther
mia to kill cancer cells. Hyper
thermia therapy seeks to
selectively raise the tempera
ture of cancer tumors, adding
heat until the cancer is irrever
sibly damaged.
The treatment is difficult be
cause accidentally heating
normal tissue adjacent to a

tumor can result in serious
side effects. As a result, effec
tive targeting of heat is essen
tial.
In an effort to aim the
ultrasonic waves that heat
brain tissue, Britt uses a
focused ultrasonic beam
generated by a custom-built
transducer — a machine that
converts energy into sound —
built in his laboratory.
This beam can penetrate up
to 2 to 3 centimeters, suitable
for experimental work. A larger
one, which could penetrate 7
to 10 centimeters for clinical
use, may be constructed.
"Ultrasound is the ideal
method for delivering local
heat to the brain because it
can be done noninvasively,"
Britt said.
He continued, "In addition,
ultrasound energy combines
excellent depth of penetration
into tissues and precise focus
ing ability. It holds promise as
a new modality for the treat
ment of malignant brain
tumors, either by itself or in
combination with radio
therapy and chemotherapy."
Hyperthermia is very effec
tive when used in conjunction
with radiation therapy be
cause the two methods work
to produce a cooperative ef
fect.
"In tissue culture experi
ments, hypoxic cells (those
lower than normal in oxygen)
are especially radiation resis
tant but especially sensitive to
heat. We do not know just
why this synergy is present but
think it must relate to DNA
mechanisms," Britt said.

"One possibility is that the
environment of cancer cells,
which is different from that of
normal cells, accounts for the
cancer's increased suscep
tibility to thermal damage.
Since some cancers grow so
rapidly in the body, they out
strip their blood supply and
cannot get enough oxygen
and thereby become
hypoxic," said Britt.
The cancer's hypoxia also
can change its metabolism by
increasing the acidity of its
cells and inhibiting respira

tion. The effect of the environ
ment on the tissues can be
shown by putting a healthy
tumor cell and a normal cell
side by side in the same envi
ronment and observing that
they show the same sensitivity
to heat.
"Based on the assumption
of similar sensitivity to heat,
'tissue toxicity' is a problem
because normal tissue may
stop functioning," said Britt.
In a normal brain, the tem
perature cannot go above 42

degrees centigrade for more
than an hour without causing
irreversible brain damage. But
the tumor is not damaged un
til the temperature is above
42.2 degrees.
"The key to success is
'regional heating', and we
must be very careful to ac
curately locate the tumor,"
Britt said.
One way to define a brain
tumor's boundary is to im
mobilize the patient's head in
a frame and scan it in a three
dimensional X-ray machine.

Using this technology, the lo
cation of the tumor can be de
termined more exactly.
"Our long-range goal is to
use ultrasound, applied exter
nally to focus energy and pen
etrate at depth in human
tissue. We hope to scan a
given brain tumor by heating
very small parts of it at once.
We may also use an imaging
system such as CT
(computerized tomography)
or magnetic resonance to con
trol the targeting of the heater
to minimize errors," he said.

HOT VIBES: This prototype ultrasonic heater vibrates at over
2 million times per second to generate high energy waves
which penetrate deep below skin level. Its sound waves can
be tightly focused down to a pinhead-sized volume, deliver
ing energy to deeply seated tumors while minimizing damage
to surrounding tissues.
