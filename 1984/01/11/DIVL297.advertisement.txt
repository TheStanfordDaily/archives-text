Artificial
Intelliqence
Scientist
Here's a position with extra appeal for some one who is specialized in
Artificial Intelligence. It offers an opportunity to mature skills and build
professional recognition by demonstrating ability over a wide spectrum
of assignments.
Projects may be in manufacturing, design, science or other areas for
Research Center programs for the many divisions of United Technologies
Corporation or others. Thus, opportunities for wide exposure and early
recognition of abilities are materially above average.
You will be expected to provide technical and program leadership in
defining and implementing practical knowledge-based systems; research
state-of-the-art in Al as applied to specific areas; determine appropriate
software tools for Expert System implementation.
Education should include a MS or Ph.D degree in Computer Science
with significant course work in Artificial Intelligence, LISP programming
and knowledge representation. An advantage would be research experi
ence focussed primarily in one or more of the following areas: Expert
Systems, natural language interfaces or knowledge-based systems.
The Research Center has gained wide recognition for significant accom
plishments both in pure science and R&D. This has resulted from an envi
ronment tailored to the needs of scientific researchers, ample funding,
outstanding back up services and a scientifically oriented management.
Publication of papers is encouraged.
To creative individuals, we offer an ideal growth environment. So send
your resume today to Mr. C.P Marcin at the United Technologies Research
Center, Silver Lane, East Hartford, CT. 06108.
