# Dean Fred Hargadon will admit no failures
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
The following is the second
part of an interview with Dean
of Admissions Fred Hargadon
who is leaving Stanford in June
to be senior vice president of
the College Board.
Daily: How has the applicant
pool changed over the 15 years?
Hargadon: For one thing, it's
gotten bigger. It's probably al
most twice the size, not quite,
but it's maybe three-quarters
again the size it was 15 years
ago. I think it's gone from
about 9000 to where it will be
about 15,000. And also, I
think, both the applicant
group and the freshman class
each year now come from
many more high schools
across the country than was
the case before, maybe twice
as many high schools, so that
we've tried our best to make
sure that students at any of the
20,000 high schools across the
country, plus the additional
ones in other parts of the
world, would think of us as a
possibility. A lot of what we
have tried to do is make sure
of that. I mean, one of the
reasons for not having inter
views is not to make anybody
at any distance feel that they
would be at a disadvantage by
not plugging in that way.
We've written our material,
we hope, so that it's in
formative for people who are
at some distance, because I
think many arriving freshmen
still have not seen the campus
before they get here. So we've
tried out best to inform them
about the school, but not to
gild the lily, or anything like
that.
Daily: You've mentioned a
formula that could be used in
admissions ...
Hargadon: I was thinking of

the University of California
system.
Daily: Right. Are there any
other universities using for
mulas, other than state schools?
Hargadon: An awful lot of
public universities, not all of
them, but I think most of
them, have formulas. And I
suspect that, I guess that,
there are a number of private
ones that kind of automatically
look at something, and if you
have decent test scores and
you breathe, you're alive,
you're in. It's a little harder to
compare with other private in
stitutions. For instance, the
University of California con
siders the top 12 percent of
every high school to be the
same. But in the private insti
tutions, it's hard to compare,
partly because there aren't
that many that have as large
and as universally qualified an
applicant group as we do to
choose from. There may be a
half dozen or so in that situa
tion.
Daily: Does Stanford have
any sort of formula where a stu
dent has a "D" average and 250
SAT scores and you automati
cally say, "No" ?
Hargadon: Well, that's not a
formula, there. What happens
is we try to see how everything
fits together. You know, low
scores don't bother me per se,
buts it's rare that you would
find a really low score like the
one you mentioned and find a
brilliant essay. Part of it is
looking at the fit. It's very pos
sible for a quite literate and
quite bright and quite artic
ulate student simply not to
have done well on a given test.
But all the other stuff better
come out on the application.
Frequently you'll find,
though, that characteristics,

characteristics at the ex
tremes, anyway, hang to
gether. Really low test scores
will generally be connected
with essays that aren't very
literate. But what you do is al
ways try and find the excep
tion to everything. Part of that
process is making sure that
you are covering the ground
to make sure that if there's an
exception among any single
applicant, you're finding it.
Daily: What do you think has
been your major accomplish
ment as dean of admissions?
Hargadon: Not messing it
up.
Daily: What about failures?
Hargadon: Well, what makes
it an interesting job but also
wears on you about it is that
there are only 24 hours in a
day. You keep thinking of
things you would like to do
better or could do better. I
mean it would be great to
want to meet individually all
the applicants, but it's
impossible. It would be great
to publish a three- or four
hundred page "Bulletin," but
it's impossible to do and it's
unlikely anybody would read
it. It's a system where you try
and keep the imperfections
down, but there's no sense of
perfection about it. As soon as
any of us send anything to the
press, we think, "I could have
written that sentence differ
ently." But I think you turn to
a pillar of salt waiting for the
absolute perfect way to do
things.
Daily: Do you have any idea
where Stanford will turn for
your successor?
Hargadon: No, I don't.
Daily: You don't know if it
will be from inside or outside
the University?


7 think the biggest
mistake to me is to
begin to believe that
everybody you
admit is better than
everybody you turn
down, and I've
never really felt
about the job that
way/
