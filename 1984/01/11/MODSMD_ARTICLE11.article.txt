# Dean Fred Hargadon will admit no failures
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
The following is the second
part of an interview with Dean
of Admissions Fred Hargadon
who is leaving Stanford in June
to be senior vice president of
the College Board.
Daily: How has the applicant
pool changed over the 15 years?
Hargadon: For one thing, it's
gotten bigger. It's probably al
most twice the size, not quite,
but it's maybe three-quarters
again the size it was 15 years
ago. I think it's gone from
about 9000 to where it will be
about 15,000. And also, I
think, both the applicant
group and the freshman class
each year now come from
many more high schools
across the country than was
the case before, maybe twice
as many high schools, so that
we've tried our best to make
sure that students at any of the
20,000 high schools across the
country, plus the additional
ones in other parts of the
world, would think of us as a
possibility. A lot of what we
have tried to do is make sure
of that. I mean, one of the
reasons for not having inter
views is not to make anybody
at any distance feel that they
would be at a disadvantage by
not plugging in that way.
We've written our material,
we hope, so that it's in
formative for people who are
at some distance, because I
think many arriving freshmen
still have not seen the campus
before they get here. So we've
tried out best to inform them
about the school, but not to
gild the lily, or anything like
that.
Daily: You've mentioned a
formula that could be used in
admissions ...
Hargadon: I was thinking of

the University of California
system.
Daily: Right. Are there any
other universities using for
mulas, other than state schools?
Hargadon: An awful lot of
public universities, not all of
them, but I think most of
them, have formulas. And I
suspect that, I guess that,
there are a number of private
ones that kind of automatically
look at something, and if you
have decent test scores and
you breathe, you're alive,
you're in. It's a little harder to
compare with other private in
stitutions. For instance, the
University of California con
siders the top 12 percent of
every high school to be the
same. But in the private insti
tutions, it's hard to compare,
partly because there aren't
that many that have as large
and as universally qualified an
applicant group as we do to
choose from. There may be a
half dozen or so in that situa
tion.
Daily: Does Stanford have
any sort of formula where a stu
dent has a "D" average and 250
SAT scores and you automati
cally say, "No" ?
Hargadon: Well, that's not a
formula, there. What happens
is we try to see how everything
fits together. You know, low
scores don't bother me per se,
buts it's rare that you would
find a really low score like the
one you mentioned and find a
brilliant essay. Part of it is
looking at the fit. It's very pos
sible for a quite literate and
quite bright and quite artic
ulate student simply not to
have done well on a given test.
But all the other stuff better
come out on the application.
Frequently you'll find,
though, that characteristics,

characteristics at the ex
tremes, anyway, hang to
gether. Really low test scores
will generally be connected
with essays that aren't very
literate. But what you do is al
ways try and find the excep
tion to everything. Part of that
process is making sure that
you are covering the ground
to make sure that if there's an
exception among any single
applicant, you're finding it.
Daily: What do you think has
been your major accomplish
ment as dean of admissions?
Hargadon: Not messing it
up.
Daily: What about failures?
Hargadon: Well, what makes
it an interesting job but also
wears on you about it is that
there are only 24 hours in a
day. You keep thinking of
things you would like to do
better or could do better. I
mean it would be great to
want to meet individually all
the applicants, but it's
impossible. It would be great
to publish a three- or four
hundred page "Bulletin," but
it's impossible to do and it's
unlikely anybody would read
it. It's a system where you try
and keep the imperfections
down, but there's no sense of
perfection about it. As soon as
any of us send anything to the
press, we think, "I could have
written that sentence differ
ently." But I think you turn to
a pillar of salt waiting for the
absolute perfect way to do
things.
Daily: Do you have any idea
where Stanford will turn for
your successor?
Hargadon: No, I don't.
Daily: You don't know if it
will be from inside or outside
the University?


7 think the biggest
mistake to me is to
begin to believe that
everybody you
admit is better than
everybody you turn
down, and I've
never really felt
about the job that
way/
- Fred Hargadon
Hargadon: No, I don't have
any idea.
Daily: l*> there anyone in the
admissions office now who
you think would he qualified to
take over?
Hargadon: Oh, I think that
there are a lot of people in the
office that know it well. I'm
not sure anybody wants to

take it over. I would think that
there are candidates there,
and I would think that it really
depends on how the Univer
sity decides to go about
replacing me in that particular
position.
Daily: Is there, in the admis
sions office, a "next in com
mand" ?
Hargadon: The one thing
about that job, the dirty part of
it and the good part, is that
there really isn't anybody on
the staff that's been there a

while that doesn't everything
from A to Z about how that op
eration goes. From what it
looks like to have to file docu
ments in folders all the way up
to reading them and writing
them up and about students
from all parts of the country,
since we don't divide the
country geographically, like
some offices do. So there's no
real specialists, and all of them
have been generalists in going
over the whole operation. But
as I say, from the inside, I

think they know more, the
people who work there now,
of course, know more/ about
the pressures of the job and
how much time it than
anybody outside.;. AjrÂ«cl *h*t
could work botfi ways. It
might make it attractive to
them, it might make it not at
tractive to them. Yoy get a lot
of what I call "fan mail" in that
job. When you turn down 12
or 13,000 pspple a year, which
when you end up with fresh
men and transfers that's what

we end up turning down, as
someone pointed out there's
just far more people out there
that don't think we've done it
well than think we've done it
well.
Daily: Will you have anything
to do with the selection
process?
Hargadon: I'm not sure.
Probably not, but I don't know
at this point. We really haven't
talked about it.
Daily: When do you an
ticipate that happening?
Hargadon: I would think,
this kind of happened when
you all went on break,
whenever the president and
provost decide that they'll get
this thing going. I mean it's
nice in that I haven't, you
know, I wasn't going to leave
next week, so that they have
some time, and I think they'll
be giving thought to it, and
probably all of us will, then.
Daily: Is there anything that
would keep a person coming
from the outside from radically
changing the admissions
process?
Hargadon: Well, the general
bounds are really set by the
faculty in their policy. It's not

as if they sit down every year
and write out new policies.
You're really representing the
University and the process has
to be the most effective way
you can devise of representing
the goals of the University. So
that I don't think there's going
to be a radical change in what
the faculty wants the policy to
be. It's conceivable somebody
could find a new or different
way of putting that policy into
effect.
Daily: But the faculty prob
ably wouldn't go for some sort
of formula system?
Hargadon: It's a large fac
ulty. I'm sure some might, but
I couldn't speak for them.
Daily: What advice would
you give to your successor?
Hargadon: Oh boy. I don't
know if I'd give so much ad
vice as warning. I'd be sure
and tell him how much time it
takes. Just to keep it a process

that encourages as many dif
ferent kinds of able people ap
plying as possible. I think the
biggest mistake to make is to
begin to believe that
everybody you admit is better
than everybody you turn
down, and I've never really
felt about the job that way.
I've always felt that somebody
has to select the freshman
class, that we do it within the
bounds set by the faculty, but
we have to do it, and you have
to realize that there are lots of
other great people out there.
Some whom we admit and
then don't come, lots of
whom we don't admit, and
lots who don't apply. But you
could go nuts trying to, I
think, think there are 1500
great people in the world, and
your job is to land those 1500
each year. There are so many
great people. That's the really
interesting part of the job and

the part I'll miss most, I think,
the chance to be impressed by
all the different kinds of 18-
and 19-year-olds.
Daily: What about a return
cameo appearance in Gaieties
next year?
Hargadon: I don't think
they'd want that.
Daily: And when will the per
sonalized "ADMITS" license
plates change?
Hargadon: I don't know. I'm
thinking of auctioning them
off. Whenever I move out of
California, I guess.
Daily: Is there anything else
you'd like to add?
Hargadon: No, it's just that I
was thinking, it's easy for me
to do this now since the
leaving is off a ways. I'm trying
to think of how I would have
reacted had it been something
I had to leave in a month. But
this gives me a chance to make
the transition gradual.
