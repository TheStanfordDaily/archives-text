## The
						Stanford Daily No Bookstore blues 
### 
Students returning to campus after a long
and restful vacation are barraged by a variety of
bothersome but necessary tasks. Most notably,
an innocent jaunt to Maples Pavilion is too of
ten transformed into an odyssean nightmare of
duplicate forms and wrong lines. Many stu
dents then shuffle off to the Bookstore,
bracing themselves for the inevitable rush and
accompanying long lines. But here they are in
for a pleasant surprise.
The potential for disaster at the Bookstore
during registration is great. Thousands of stu
dents swarm through the doors facing White
Plaza — many on the same day -r- to fill their
little plastic baskets with textbooks, paper
backs, notebooks, pens, staplers, calendars
and, well, you name it. And then everybody
gets in line, armed with checkbooks, identifi
cation and thinning patience.
But the Bookstore management has found a

method in all this madness. Opening extra cas
hier lines, stationing two clerks per line and
employing special credit checkers all serve to
speed up the paying process. Even the longest
lines — which can wind back as far as the
candy counter — are tolerable.
Efficiency is put at a premium. With all the
headaches accompanying registration, it's nice
to be able to purchase a full supply of books
and accessories on the busiest day of the quar
ter in less than a half hour's time.
Inevitably students will encounter a grumpy
cashier or an unhelpful employee. And sure,
the Mrs. Fields' cookies are usually sold out by
noon every day. But these complaints are the
exception, not the rule.
By taking the bite out of registration,
Bookstore employees deserve a bit of recogni
tion. Kudos to the management, staff and per
sonnel for a job well done.
