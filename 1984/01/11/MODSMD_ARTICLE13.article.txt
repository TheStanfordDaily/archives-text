# A 						new recruit

You better watch out, you better not cry —
Jack Elway's coming to town. And he's no Santa
Claus when it comes to giving away games.
Elway accumulated an impressive 35-19-1
record for his former employer, San Jose State
University. That includes three victories over
our own lackluster team (in the past four
seasons).
At present, there is no better selection for
the job of head football coach. Elway is well
known for his innovative offensive strategy — a
style which has brought excitement and victory
to many Stanford teams of years past.
Plus, there's a legacy. After all, Jack is the fa
ther of John, who not too long ago used to mo
ped around our campus, taking time out to
throw 60-yard touchdown passes and set all
kinds of records. If he could teach his own son
to be the best college quarterback of his time,

he must a few pointers for our team.
Many people have criticized the current
football program for its inability to recruit
talented players. Some even suggest that we
must lower our standards or our expectations.
Not surprisingly, recruiting is one of Elway's
strong suits. We're very pleased that he has
stated his commitment to recruiting intelligent
athletes who meet the University's competitive
admissions standards.
Recruiting takes time, so we'll have to be pa
tient. Miracles don't happen overnight. We're
confident that two or three years of Jack Elway
will give us a bowl-bound football team.
So in the midst of our goodbyes to Dean
Fred, let's make time to welcome Coach Elway.
With a little support, we think he'll guide the
football team to victory.
