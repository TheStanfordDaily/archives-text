# Robert Larkins: Gramps' Gripes
## Legislators earn poor marks 
### 
As you probably noticed during
registration, the cost of a Stanford
education is not coming down. Tui
tion for winter quarter is $3009,
which breaks dqwn to approximate
ly $56 a day; "
Three timel; a and
sign my life away, Dut tne sting al
ways passes quickly. By midterms
I'm convinced that the money is
well spent. What pains me more
than parting with my hard-earned
greenbacks is doing so in the midst
of the current controversy in the
California State Legislature over
Gov. Deukmejian's proposed im
position of registration fees at the
state's community colleges.
A year ago, the newly-elected
governor cut $108 million in aid to
the community colleges, making
restoration thereof contingent upon
the legislature's approval of a $50
per semester fee. Led by Speaker
Willie Brown, who — between
shopping sprees at Wilkes Bashford
and trips to Rio — grandstands as

defender of the meek, the Assembly
Democrats have resisted the Gover
nor's plan, leaving the financial
future of the community college sys
tem unresolved.
I effi^ody mur
der ana nGegun to make highly
visible, painful cuts which threaten
the integrity of the curricula. The
same tactic was used by local gov
ernments and public schools in the
wake of Proposition 13. Rather than
eliminate the Society for the Protec
tion of Sea Culls and cooking
classes for sixth graders, they closed
fire departments and cut math
teachers, hoping to scare the public
back into unbridled property taxes.
The problem lies in the fact that
today's community colleges are
trying to be everything to
everybody. Junior colleges used to
be where students went to prepare
for the UC system or to get voca
tional training. Now, however, they
have been transformed into centers

of "personal fulfillment," where
practically anyone in the community
can indulge his impulses to dabble
in film making, foreign language
and modern dance..Cultured quiche
eaters are swell, bu^ xpayers
should not finance
this luxury.
Currently, a resident of California
can matriculate at College of Marin,
one of the nation's best two-year
colleges, for $4 a semester, plus
books! For the most part, credits
earned are fully transferable to the
UC system — even Stanford accepts
some of the units. In other words, a
student can get two years of credits
which transfer to Cal for $16 plus
books. I received 21 Stanford units
for the work I did at College of
Marin as a senior in high school —
$3000 worth of units for the price of
two movies.
The governor's plan is both fiscal
ly and socially responsible, and the
Duke should stick to his guns. After
all, $50 a semester breaks down to
approximately 60 cents a day —
about what it costs for a Coke or a
candy bar, cheaper than a pack of
cigarettes. Besides, having to shell
out $50 may provide some incentive
for students to make the most of the
excellent resources available and
discourage them from dillydallying
endlessly while "finding them
selves."
It is disheartening to see
politicians who were elected to
serve the public now exploiting the
education issue for political advan
tage. The students of California's
community colleges have become
pawns in a partisan power play, and
they should be outraged by the sel
fish conduct of the Assembly
Democrats. In my book, Willie
Brown and his gang deserve an "F"
for citizenship.
