## Stopping a sexist custom 
### 
It has become fashionable to talk
(and write) about the need for wo
men's liberation. There are good
reasons for that. Women have been
treated unfairly, and there should
be a genuine concern with correct
ing that.
Since we reproduce sexually, it's a
good thing that there are differ
ences between men and women.
Even beyond the realm of
reproductive needs, we derive a
great deal of pleasure from those
differences. But we have let our im
agination go too far creating ines
sential differences, most of which
are harmful to women's position in
human society. The women's move
ment was born as a struggle to elimi
nate those unnecessary, long
standing differences, and quite
rightfully so.
I once heard Federico Fellini say,
in an interview, that any intelligent
man should believe in women's
liberation. Perhaps that's why not so
many men care about the issue. But
besides the need for concern about
the injustice of the share of power

between men and women, I think
that there are numerous practical
reasons for men to be interested in
advocating women's equal rights
and access to the responsibilities
and rewards of social activity.
To men, women's liberation
should be an opportunity to fully
"exploit" the talents and capabili
ties of half of humanity.
Even though significant progress
has been made by women in this
struggle, one aspect that has
remained relatively untouched is
the one that has to do with names.
By that I mean the (last) names that
we carry from our birth until we
die.
For multiple reasons, names are
very important in our lives. They
provide us with the means to iden
tify and refer to others, and provide
us with a sense of identity.
Sometimes they are the source of
pride, and they often give us a
(false) sense of immortality. It is as
tonishing to see the kind of efforts
that some people make to preserve
their names for posterity. For most
of us, having children that will carry
our name forward is a way of secur
ing that kind of immortality, provid
ed that at least one of the children is
a boy.
As it used to be with the lineage of
royalty, names belong to men. It's
an old story. Here you have a typical
example. In Genesis, the famous
bestseller, it is told that Noah was the
son of Lamech, son of Methuselah,
son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of
Mahalel, son of Kenan, son of
Enoch, son of Seth, son of Adam,
son of . . . (Sorry, I got carried
away.) The sequence makes you
think that people didn't have
mothers in those days.
The situation is not much differ
ent today. Children, who later
become adults, preserve the name
of their fathers only.
To make things worse, women
tend to adopt the name of their hus
bands when they get married. That
is a very "beautiful" sacrifice on the
part of women, who are so much in
love with their mates that they don't
mind giving up their names and,
with them, part of their identities.
Love implies sacrifices, but that cer
tainly doesn't mean that women

should be the only ones making
them. Having men adopting the
name of their wife would be nice for
a change, but it isn't the answer.
That would simply reverse the as
symetry, changing one injustice
with another.
This part of the problem can be
easily corrected. Women can simply
refuse to adopt their husbands'
names. But what about a woman's
claim to "immortality?" Trying to
solve the unnecessary difference
between men and women when it
comes to bequesting names re
quires a more significant change in
the way things are done.
The first solution that I would like
to suggest is the following. Children
could get alternatively their mot
her's and their father's names. That
looks very simple, but there are
some problems attached to it. First
of all, when the first child is born
there is no guarantee that there are
going to be others, and some con
troversy is likely to emerge about
who should be the first one
"giving" the name to the child.
Since we don't like marital fights
we'll try to think of something else.
A better solution would be to
have a random drawing at marriage,
to know if the man is going to adopt
the name of his wife or if it is going
to be the other way around. I think
that this is as fair as you can get
about names, eliminating the sexism
implied by the current custom. As a
token present for the losing party,
one could adopt the Spanish tradi
tion of using two last names, but
there would be a difference from
that system. One would not know
beforehand if it is the father's or the
mother's name that would go first
and be preserved for generations to
come. In fact, one could be sure
only that the name would last for
one generation. It would be luck
that would "decide" if a name is
"worth" preserving.
A further virtue of this idea is that,
in addition to helping advance the
liberation of women, it would help
us to correct our perceptions about
immortality.
