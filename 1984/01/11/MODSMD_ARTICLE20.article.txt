# Toward your health: Jack Martin
## How to make New Year's resolutions stick 
### 
Welcome to 1984. As
befits the occasion I am
writing this column on a com
puter. I have been told that
this method is faster than a
typewriter and that nothing
can go wrong.
The start of a new year is a
time when many of us make
resolutions to improve our
health. You may have resolved
to lose weight, exercise more,
reduce your level of stress,
adopt better sleep habits, etc.
Unless you have a plan to
achieve these goals, however,
you are not likely to be suc
cessful. Dr. John Farquhar,
Director of the Stanford Heart
Disease Prevention Program,
has developed a six-point pro
gram for achieving self
directed change. Use of Far
quhar's program might help
you achieve your goals for
1984.
The first step is to identify

the problem. If you are over
weight, this task is easy as the
"problem" is right in front of
you — or behind you as the
case may be. Some problems,
such as stress, are not as readi
ly identified. Is the stress
related to academic concerns,
personal relationships or
some other cause? The impor
tant point is that, prior to
beginning a behavior change
program, you should try to
identify the problem in spe
cific terms.
The second step is to build
confidence in yourself and
commitment to making
change. Farquhar suggests
using positive self-talk to build
your confidence. For example,
if your goal is to exercise
more, a positive statement
would be, "Taking an aerobic
dance class would be a lot of
fun and I will make new
friends." By contrast, a

negative thought might be,
"Taking an aerobic dance
class might be fun for some
people, but I am in such poor
condition that I would not en
joy it."
The third step is to increase
awareness of your behavior
patterns. Before you can
change a behavior, you need
to know when it occurs and
under what circumstances.

The best way to acquire this
awareness is to keep a diary of
the behavior for at least a two
week period. For example, if
your goal is to improve your
sleep habits, you would write
down the time you get up and
the time you go to bed each
day. Vou might notice a ten
dency to stay up late on cer
tain nights or in certain sit
uations.
Once you have this informa
tion on your current habits,
the fourth step is to build an

action plan to achieve your
desired goal. For example, if
your goal is to increase exer
cise and you observe that you
now exercise once a week, a
good plan would be to set up
two exercise times per week
for winter quarter and three
per week for spring quarter. It
would also be a good idea to
record your behavior in a
notebook used specifically for
this purpose.
Whatever your action plan,
you are more likely to achieve

it if you build in social support
and self reward. Tell your
friends you are trying to
achieve a certain goal and they
will usually be supportive. For
example, if you are trying to
avoid eating desserts, you can
be sure your friends will
remind you should you
"forget" and try to have a par
ticular favorite treat. Drawing
up a written contract in which
you promise to engage in cer
tain behaviors is another way
to gain social support. The
contract would state what spe
cific activities you will do
during the contractual period
and the reward or penalty as
sociated with them. You
might, for example, sign a
contract with your roommate
in which you promise to lose a
pound a week for each week
of winter quarter The penalty
for failure might be a sum of
money or performing some
task for your roommate.
Roommates are usually
amenable to this type of ar
rangement! A good self

reward might be to plan to do
some favorite activity over
spring break if you achieve
your goal. To add to the
realism, the contract should
be signed and notarized.
The fifth step is to evaluate
your action plan after it has
been in effect for a period of
time. Try to stick to your
original plan, but be prepared
to change it if necessary. Vou
may have set unrealistic goals
or ones which were realized
quickly. You should strive for
meaningful goals, but not
ones which are almost
impossible to reach. It is bet
ter to score a minor success
than to fail to achieve an ideal
objective.
The final step in Farquhar's
plan is maintenance of your
newly developed habits. As
Mark Twain once said,
"Quitting smoking is easy.
I've done it hundreds of
times." A periodic review of
your program will help you
make your new habits last a
lifetime. Good luck!

good plan would be to set up
two exercise times per week
for winter quarter and three
per week for spring quarter. It
would also be a good idea to
record your behavior in a
notebook used specifically for
this purpose.
Whatever your action plan,
you are more likely to achieve

it if you build in social support
and self reward. Tell your
friends you are trying to
achieve a certain goal and they
will usually be supportive. For
example, if you are trying to
avoid eating desserts, you can
be sure your friends will
remind you should you
"forget" and try to have a par
ticular favorite treat. Drawing
up a written contract in which
you promise to engage in cer
tain behaviors is another way
to gain social support. The
contract would state what spe
cific activities you will do
during the contractual period
and the reward or penalty as
sociated with them. You
might, for example, sign a
contract with your roommate
in which you promise to lose a
pound a week for each week
of winter quarter The penalty
for failure might be a sum of
money or performing some
task for your roommate.
Roommates are usually
amenable to this type of ar
rangement! A good self

reward might be to plan to do
some favorite activity over
spring break if you achieve
your goal. To add to the
realism, the contract should
be signed and notarized.
The fifth step is to evaluate
your action plan after it has
been in effect for a period of
time. Try to stick to your
original plan, but be prepared
to change it if necessary. Vou
may have set unrealistic goals
or ones which were realized
quickly. You should strive for
meaningful goals, but not
ones which are almost
impossible to reach. It is bet
ter to score a minor success
than to fail to achieve an ideal
objective.
The final step in Farquhar's
plan is maintenance of your
newly developed habits. As
Mark Twain once said,
"Quitting smoking is easy.
I've done it hundreds of
times." A periodic review of
your program will help you
make your new habits last a
lifetime. Good luck!

Welcome to 1984. As
befits the occasion I am
writing this column on a com
puter. I have been told that
this method is faster than a
typewriter and that nothing
can go wrong.
The start of a new year is a
time when many of us make
resolutions to improve our
health. You may have resolved
to lose weight, exercise more,
reduce your level of stress,
adopt better sleep habits, etc.
Unless you have a plan to
achieve these goals, however,
you are not likely to be suc
cessful. Dr. John Farquhar,
Director of the Stanford Heart
Disease Prevention Program,
has developed a six-point pro
gram for achieving self
directed change. Use of Far
quhar's program might help
you achieve your goals for
1984.
The first step is to identify

the problem. If you are over
weight, this task is easy as the
"problem" is right in front of
you — or behind you as the
case may be. Some problems,
such as stress, are not as readi
ly identified. Is the stress
related to academic concerns,
personal relationships or
some other cause? The impor
tant point is that, prior to
beginning a behavior change
program, you should try to
identify the problem in spe
cific terms.
The second step is to build
confidence in yourself and
commitment to making
change. Farquhar suggests
using positive self-talk to build
your confidence. For example,
if your goal is to exercise
more, a positive statement
would be, "Taking an aerobic
dance class would be a lot of
fun and I will make new
friends." By contrast, a

negative thought might be,
"Taking an aerobic dance
class might be fun for some
people, but I am in such poor
condition that I would not en
joy it."
The third step is to increase
awareness of your behavior
patterns. Before you can
change a behavior, you need
to know when it occurs and
under what circumstances.

The best way to acquire this
awareness is to keep a diary of
the behavior for at least a two
week period. For example, if
your goal is to improve your
sleep habits, you would write
down the time you get up and
the time you go to bed each
day. Vou might notice a ten
dency to stay up late on cer
tain nights or in certain sit
uations.
Once you have this informa
tion on your current habits,
the fourth step is to build an

action plan to achieve your
desired goal. For example, if
your goal is to increase exer
cise and you observe that you
now exercise once a week, a
good plan would be to set up
two exercise times per week
for winter quarter and three
per week for spring quarter. It
would also be a good idea to
record your behavior in a
notebook used specifically for
this purpose.
Whatever your action plan,
you are more likely to achieve

it if you build in social support
and self reward. Tell your
friends you are trying to
achieve a certain goal and they
will usually be supportive. For
example, if you are trying to
avoid eating desserts, you can
be sure your friends will
