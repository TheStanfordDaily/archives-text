## Card nearly upsets Bruins in 71-66 loss at Pauley 
### MARk ZEIGLER 
Los Angeles â€” Stanford
Coach Tom Davis must be
wondering how much better
his team can play and still lose.
In the Cardinal's first two
Pacific-10 Conference con
tests, it played excellent bas
ketball against a taller and
more talented opponent and
still came up empty. Last
night's game against the UCLA
Bruins was no different.
Sixth-ranked UCLA ma
neuvered itself past a hus
tling Stanford mid-way
through the second half and
hung on to win, 71-66, before
12,418 fans here in Pauley
Pavilion.
"That was a great game we
played," Davis said, "but
we've got to think of some
things so we can play better."

With the loss, Stanford
dropped to 0-3 in the Pac-10
and 11-4 overall, with three of
its four defeats coming to top
-20 teams. UCLA improved to
10-1 overall and remained in
first place in the Pac-10 with a
3-0 record.
"Our players made a tre
mendous effort," Davis said,
"I'm really proud of them. But
to UCLA's credit, once they
got the lead, they never let us
back in it."
UCLA got that commanding
lead during a seven-minute
stretch in the second half
when it outscored Stanford 18-
7 to turn a 40-39 deficit into a
57-47 advantage with 8:47 to
play.
"We had a couple of short
lapses where we didn't run
our offense the way we

wanted to," said Card guard
Steve Brown, who finished
with 12 points. "They got a
few quick baskets and got up
by eight or 10 points. That
changed the complexion of
the game.''
UCLA increased that lead to
62-51 with 4:03 to go, but less
than three minutes later, the
Card shaved it to six at 68-62
on a forceful one-hander by
Keith lones.
After Davis called time out,
Brown fouled Bruin guard
Ralph lackson, who made only
one of the ensuing free
throws. However, Stanford's
efforts to score failed and
UCLA put the game away with
two more free throws.
The UCLA victory did not
come as easily as the near
capacity crowd expected, al

though it certainly seemed
that it would in the early
going.
The Bruins raied out of the
blocks, and betore Stanford
knew it, Davis and Co. were
looking at a 10-J deficit and a
possible blowout.
But Stanford, on the
strength of 10 )ohn Revelli
points, outscored UCLA 20-8
in the next nine minutes to
take a 22-18 lead its biggest of
trie night.
Stanford's final lead was at
the 15:38 mark of the second
half, after a pair of )ones
jumpers put Stanford ahead
40-39.
One reason for UCLA's suc
cess in the second half was the
play of 18-year-old freshman
Reggie Miller, the brother of
USC's Cheryl Miller.
The 6-foot-6, 170-pound Mil
ler came on to score eight
second-halt points, all from
the outside, and cracked Stan
ford's collapsing I-2-2 zone.
"When we put Reggie in the
game," explained UCLA Head
Coach Larry Farmer, "they had
to honor him as a shooter.
This made it much easier to
get the ball inside to Kenny
(Fields)."
Fields, the 6-7 All-America
candidate was held to just six
first-half points, but tallied 13
in the second half, including
the last five points in the
Bruins' 18-7 second-half spurt.

Stanford guard Keith Jones scored 17 points last night against UCLA at Pauley Pavilion to
keep Stanford close against a talented UCLA basketball team. Jones fouled out in the closing
minutes of the game.
