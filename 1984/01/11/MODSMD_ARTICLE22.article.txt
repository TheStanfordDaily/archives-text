## Knight's right 
### 
We got the right man. Bobby Knight's
style fits. It's aggressive play with maximum
discipline.
And we've got the players in Patrick
Ewing, Michael Jordan, Keith Lee, Wayman
Tisdale, Sam Perkins and Melvin Turpin. I
mean, PLAYERS. These guys are mature,
mentally tough, physical Secretariats, and
the majority of 'em are space eaters, with
huge appetites.
But in spite of all that, I bet Coach Knight a
dinner that we don't win the gold medal in
basketball at the 1984 Olympics.
I hope I lose the bet, but make my steak
rare, please. It's not that we've gotten any
softer, but the European countries have real
ly gone Park Avenue during the last eight
years. Especially Yugoslavia, which I think
now has more seven footers than Commu
nists, and Russia, which is always a for
midable opponent.
At curtain time, these countries will show
off steady clubs, thoroughbreds who have
been playing together for many years, per
forming under international rules, and
playing with officials you normally can't
communicate with because of a language
barrier.
Don't get me wrong, Coach Knight has
won the NCAA twice, he's won the NIT, and
the gold at Pan Am. He's like the Alexander
of college basketball with no worlds left to
conquer. I have no doubt there's nobody
better than Coach Knight to lead the Ameri
can contingent. A lot of people think that
Bobby shouldn't have done this thing, but
hey, he's the best.
Bobby Knight, whether you like him or
dislike him, there's no way you can knock
his coaching. He's bulletproof, what Dr.
Naismith had in mind. He's got the corners
covered, right out of the gate. Ballplayers
who go to Indiana know more about Bobby
Knight than we know about them. They
know it's a chart, machine-gun type opera
tion, and who's in charge. He makes his

&
players play to their capacity.
I've always said, coaching is forcing a guy
to take an extra step. Bobby Knight gets
them to leap over tall buildings in a single
bound . . . and like it.
In my opinion, Bobby Knight is more an
American of yester-year, Gen. Patton, The
American flag and apple pie. Sometimes his
vocabulary gets tug-boatish. He's the most
intimidating coach to other coaches in the
country. But he's also the guy you want in
charge in a sand fight.
The only thing wrong with Bobby Knight
are his sport coats. If he ends up in the
sleazy part of town, he'd get mugged for his
sport coat.
The problem is, no matter how good the
conductor, the bands must still play the
music, and our arrangement stinks. Starting
a team out two months before the games is
just not enough. Hoops is a team game. I
see problems.
Another reason I feel we won't get the
gold ring, is our collegiate players, being
young, will be basketball-logged before they
ever get uptown. They played last year, in
Caracus, Venezuela, and Edmonton,
Canada, and they will have gone through a
trying NCAA tournament season. To then
have a regroup for a trial of 60 players that
eventually become 12 is just too draining,
physically and mentally.
So, I would certainly like to lose the meal
to the coach, eat crow, but I just think we're
going to have to change our format if we
want seashells and balloons in Los Angeles.
First, the ballplayers are going to have to
make their commitment a year before, so
they can travel to Europe and Asia, to get ac
customed to the rules, the officials and to
each other. They're going to have to learn to
do as the Romans do, and do it better, if
they want an edge. Like I said, it's not 1976
in Montreal. It's eight years later, and the
Europeans are definitely on the uptick.
