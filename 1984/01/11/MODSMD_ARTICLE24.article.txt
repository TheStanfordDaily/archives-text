### 
New York (AP) — Carl Lewis, winner of
iree events in the both the World Track
nd Field Championships and the USA
Championships with a series of dazzling
erformances, was named yesterday as
he Associated Press' Male Athlete of the
ear for 1983.
Lewis, winner of the 100-meter dash
nd the long jump and a member of the
Jnited States' world record-setting 400-
neter relay team in the inaugural World
Championships at Helsinki, Finland, in
\ugust, and winner of the 100, 200 and
ong jump in the National Championships
it Indianapolis in )une, was an easy win
ler in the voting.
In the balloting by a nationwide panel
Df sports writers and broadcasters, he
received 37 votes, compared to 22 for
runner-up Wayne Cretzky, the record
smashing scorer for the Edmonton Oilers
of the National Hockey League who was
named the AP Male Athlete of the Year in
1982.
Gretzky won his third straight NHL
scoring title with 196 points, including a
I record 125 assists, set a playoff record

with 38 points, and was named the
league's Most Valuable Player for the
fourth straight year.
Center Moses Malone, who led the
Philadelphia 76ers to the National Basket
ball Association championship, finished
third with 19 votes, and outfielder Dale
Murphy of the Atlanta Braves, winner of
the National League's MVP Award for the
second consecutive year, was fourth with
13 votes.
The AP's Woman Athlete of the Year
will be announced tomorrow.
"Last year was the best ever for me,"
said the gifted, versatile Lewis, who plans
to try to match the feat of the great Jesse
Owens — his idol — in this year's Sum
mer Olympics by shooting for gold
medals in the 100, 200, long jump and
relay.
"I feel very good about winning the
award," continued the 22-year-old from
Willingboro, N.J., who attends the Uni
versity of Houston, "lust in the United
States alone, there are tons of good ath
letes and then there are guys like
Gretzky, who ruled the NHL."

Lewis outshone them all.
First, in the USA Championships, he
won the 200-meter title for the third con
secutive time in 10.27 seconds, then
captured the long jump with a leap of 28
feet, 10'/4 inches — the second-best ever
and the longest ever at sea level — and
capped his sensational performance by
winning the 200 in 19.75, an American
record, the best ever at sea level and the
second-fastest in history, only 03 off the
world mark of 19.72, held by Pietro Men
nea of Italy.
He most likely would have broken the
world record in the 200 if he had not
slowed slightly with a big lead in the
closing meters, raised his hands into the
air in victory and failed to dip at the finish
line.
Still, he had completed the first 100-
200-long jump triple in the national cham
pionships in 97 years.
Nearly two months later, Lewis scored
his second impressive triple ot the year.
