New York (AP) — Luis Aparicio, Harmon
Killebrew and Don Drysdale were elected to
the baseball Hall of Fame in balloting by the
Baseball Writers Association of America,
which released the results last night.
The three contrast sharply in their contri
bution to the game.
Killebrew made his mark as a home run
hitter, Aparicio as a slick fielding shortstop
and basestealer, and Drysdale as a pitcher.
A total of 403 members of the association
voted in the election, so 303 votes (75 per
cent) were needed for induction into the
Hall of Fame. Aparicio and Killebrew, the all
time right-handed home run leader in the
American League, easily surpassed the re
quired vote total.
Drysdale, a fastball pitcher for the Brook
lyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, collected 316
votes (78.4 percent), only 13 more than he
needed.
Hoyt Wilhelm, the knuckleball relief spe
cialist who appeared in more games than
any other pitcher in history, missed election
by 13 votes when he received 290 (71.9 per
cent).
Aparicio, Killebrew and Drysdale repre
sent the largest group of players elected by
the writers since 1972, when Yogi Berra,

Sandy Koufax and Early Wynn were in
ducted.
Induction ceremonies will be held on
Sunday, Aug. 12, at the Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y.
Killebrew, 47, began his career in 1954
with the Washington Senators, as a 17-year
old out of an Idaho high school. He stayed
with the team — later the Minnesota Twins
— for most of his career, playing his final
season, 1975, with the Kansas City Royals.
Aparicio began his career in 1956 with the
Chicago White Sox, with whom he played
for seven years. He played five years with
Baltimore, returned to the White Sox for
three more seasons, and finished his career
with the Boston Red Sox.
Aparicio, in his sixth year on the ballot,
received the most votes among the 29 eligi
ble players with 341 (84.6 percent). Kil
lebrew, in his fourth election, gained 335
votes (83.1 percent).
Drysdale was on the ballot 10 years.
Others on the ballot and their vote totals
included Nelson Fox 246, Billy Williams 202,
)im Bunning 201, Orlando Cepeda 124, Tony
Oliva 124, Roger Maris 107, Harvey Kuenn
106, Maury Wills 104, Lew Burdette 97, Bill
Mazeroski 74, Elroy Face 65.
