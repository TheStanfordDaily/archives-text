# University grants sorority recognition
## 
### SHELLY WENTKER Staff Writer 
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority achieved Uni
versity recognition during Christmas break and
will now be able to affiliate itself with Stanford
and meet on campus.
Senior Ryby Eredia, president of the group,
said that while she has been involved in working
toward this goal since her election to office last
February, "This has been going on since '78."
For a sorority or fraternity to receive Univer
sity recognition, the group must demonstrate
sufficient autonomy from its national organiza
tion. Eredia explained this means "the chapter
here has full autonomy from any outside group
. . . . No one can tell us you can have this per
son or you can't have that person."

In order to do this, Eredia said she contacted a
representative from Kappa Kappa Gamma's na
tionals and invited her to Stanford to meet with
Row Director Diana Conklin and herself to find
out exactly what the conflict was that prevented
the group from gaining recognition.
After meeting with Eredia and Conklin, the
representative then contacted the national pres
ident of the sorority. Eredia said she received a
letter from the national president within a short
time. She submitted the letter to Conklin, and
Conklin informed her that the group now has
University recognition.
Eredia felt the overall process of achieving
recognition "seemed like it could have been
done a long time ago" and that rather than a
conflict between the University and the group's

national body, a "miscommunication" between
the two was responsible for the delay in the ac
hieving of recognition.
She explained the letter merely stated that in
the case of a conflict between sorority policy
and University policy, those of the latter would
prevail.
Adding that this has always been part of the
constitution of Kappa Kappa Gamma, Eredia
said the key paragraph in the letter did not com
promise any of the group's national rules but
"basically restated what's been known all
along."
The 60 members of the group are "really
thrilled," according to Eredia, who added, "We
didn't expect it to happen."

A coat and helmet from the Palo
Alto Fire Department were taken
from a fire engine parked in front of
Meyer Library Dec. 9. Firefighters
were on a first aid call.
The equipment is valued at over
$300, and the fire department asks
that it be returned. No questions
will be asked.
