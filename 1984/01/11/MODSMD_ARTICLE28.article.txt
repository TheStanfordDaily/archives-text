The Big Day
There are three candidates for
editor of The Stanford Daily for
Volume 185. It's sad, but only one of
them can win. Because The Daily is a
democratic newspaper instead of a
godless, evil communistic one, its
members must choose the right per
son to lead the paper. Therefore, it
is the right, as well as the god-given

duty, for members of The Staff to
cast ballots today between 1 and 10
p.m. The Chief wants YOU to vote.
Pay up
The Chief is making yet another
doomed-to-be-fruitless plea: Pay up
for the Banquet or she, personally,
will break all of your relatives legs.
Bring your cameras.
