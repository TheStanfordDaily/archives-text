## OB-GYN chief resigns after memo controversy 
### BOB BARCKLAY Staff writer 
Following a controversy over a memo he wrote last
luly that was critical of a pregnant woman's request for
a leave of absence, Dr. Leroy Heinrichs will resign his
position as chairman of Medical Center's Department
of Gynecology and Obstetrics.
The official reason for Heinrichs' decision, published
in a Medical Center News Bureau news release, is that
he wishes to " devote full time to research, teaching,
and patient care at the Medical Center."
But there are some people within the department
who feel that his resignation is a result of department
politics â€” specifically because of the memo incident
last )uly.
Heinrichs' resignation was accepted by Medical
School Dean Dominick Purpura on )an. 4. It will mark
the end of a seven-year reign as chairman of the depart
ment.
Heinrichs, who is on sabbatical and could not be
reached for comment, said in a News Bureau interview,
" There comes a time for any scientist who has been
temporarily immersed in administrative detail to return
to more satisfying academic pursuits.'
Administrators at the Med Center refused to com
ment on the possibility that his resignation is the result
of conflicts within the department
But several staff members reached by The Daily said
his resignation was also the result of department
politics and personality clashes.

One staff member said there were a number of
people who do not like or get along with Heinrichs.
When asked whether Heinrichs had been asked to
step down by Purpura, Mike Goodkind of the Medical
Center's News Bureau answered, Not officially," and
added, Anything that went on between Dr. Purpura
and Dr. Heinrichs is private and completely confiden
tial."
Purpura also could not be reached for comment.
The memorandum incident occurred last July when
Zena Levine, chief resident, requested a leave of ab
sence after becoming pregnant. Heinrichs responded
with a critical memo, sent to every faculty member in
the department, asking Levine to postpone her ab
sence and implying that she was not a "responsible
career woman".
In that memo, Heinrichs questioned the role of wo
men in medicine and wrote, "Some advise me ... to
appoint no more women as residents in this program."
This angered a number of people including Med
School Dean Purpura who equated Heinrichs' letter
with "Attila the Hun or having been written before the
Age of Reason \ later apologized for this remark
saying it was "a poor choice ot historical metaphor."
Purpura emphasized in the news release that Hein
richs' desire to devote more time to research had been
discussed prior to the controversial incident last Sep
tember. Others within the department said they felt
