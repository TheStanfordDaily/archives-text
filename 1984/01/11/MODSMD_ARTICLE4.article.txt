# University committee approves Inner Quad renovation plan
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
The University Committee on Land and
Building Development yesterday approved an
Inner Quad renovation plan that incorporates
significant aspects of the original design of
Frederick Law Olmsted, the renowned
landscape architect who planned much of the
University.
The Administrative Council, composed of
most of the University's top officials, will dis
cuss the plan today. If the council approves
the proposal it will go before the Board of
Trustees, which will decide on the plan at its
February meeting.
The design, drawn up by San Francisco
landscape architects Anthony Cuzzardo and
Associates, proposes eight 60-foot planting
circles, a uniform surface for the remainder of
the courtyard and 16-inch-high curbs around
the planting circles. No decision has been

made on the type of material to be used in
surfacing the courtyard.
There will be no grass in the planting
circles. The curbs around each circle will have
recessed lights facing outward and the rosette
in the center of the Inner Quad will be
retained.
In order to protect the surface of the Inner
Quad, all motor-driven vehicles have been
banned from the area.
' Although this is the second plan the com
mittee has asked Cuzzardo and Associates to
devise, Max Mazenko, the manager of the
project, foresees that the project will remain
within its assigned budget of approximately
$1 million, given to the University by several
anonymous donors.
The renovation is expected to begin
"sometime after commencement," according

to Mazenko, although no firm date has been
set.
This new design comes after some mem
bers of the community, primarily from the Art
Department, expressed reservations about
the original plan because it failed, they
claimed, to follow Olmsted's intentions.
One opponent of the original plan describ
ed it as reminiscent of a "modern shopping
mall."
The Project Management Office responded
to these concerns by asking Cuzzardo and As
sociates to draw tip the new plan, incorporat
ing many of Olmsted's ideas while also
seeking to make the space "user-friendlv."
Mazenko, who calls this "a better plan" be
cause of the discussion which preceded it,
said he has received no comments on it from
members of the community. Public presenta

tion of the plan will occur sometime in late
January or early February, he said.
Gerard Koskovich, a graduate student in art
history, has said "A fairly clear consensus" of
the members of the Art Department here fa
vor a more historically accurate approach to
the renovation project. Those who
opposed the original plan say the new pro
posal will more accurately reflect the original
blueprints for the Quad, which were drawn
up by Olmsted. Olmsted designed the layout
of the campus with Leland Stanford.
Some of the original blueprints were found
in the University archives by Koskovich.
Wanda Corn, an associate professor of art,
said in earlier meetings on the proposed
renovation that she opposes the original plan
because "I would like to see it done in the
best way possible ... by preserving as much
as possible the Olmsted plan.
