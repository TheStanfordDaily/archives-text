# Tuition rate hikes projected
## 
### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer 
A 7.5 percent tuition hike is ex
pected to take effect next year, and
room and board may increase 8.75
percent, Provost Albert Hastorf re
ported at a recent Faculty Senate
meeting.
The proposed price hike will bring
tuition for the 1984-85 school year to
$9704, while the basic rate for room
and board will be $4146.
The projections are part of the
University's annual financial
forecast. Increases in tuition and
room and board do not become
final until approved by the Board of

Trustees at its February meeting,
according to Tim Warner, associate
provost in the Office of Manage
ment and Budget.
Final tuition and room and board
recommendations will be made to
the trustees for approval at the
meeting next month. Before making
these recommendations, the Uni
versity will examine trends in family
disposable income, admissions and
financial aid information on 1983
freshmen and applicants, and recent
tuition changes at other universities.
"One can look back and see some
changes from the forecast level,"
Warner said. Last year's projected

tuition increase of 12 percent for
1983-84 was trimmed to 9.8 percent
before approval by the trustees.
The long-range forecast takes into
account all income and expense
items in the University's budget.
Salaries and benefits comprise the
greatest expense to the University,
taking up 60 percent of its budget
each year, according to Warner.
Because it is the University's larg
est source of income, tuition rises as
a result of salary increases, even
though income from gifts, the
return on the endowment and cost
