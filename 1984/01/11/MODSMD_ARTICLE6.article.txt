New Honduras exercises planned
Washington—The United States and Honduras
will conduct a new set of large-scale military exer
cises in that strategically placed Central American
nation beginning next )une, just three months after
ending the seven-month joint military exercise cur
rently under way known as Big Pine 11, Pentagon of
ficials said yesterday.
The future maneuvers in Honduras, which like Big
Pine 11 are intended to apply pressure to the leftist
government in neighboring Nicaragua, are still
being-planned, and officials stressed that details and
dates may still change.

to Big Pine 11, which has involved more than 5000
U.S. servicemen at a time, and is likely to last several
months.
The size and duration of the joint maneuvers are
extraordinary for the Defense Department, whose
joint exercises in other parts of the world rarely last
more than three weeks, and they are having the ef
fect of establishing a long-lasting U.S. military pres
ence in Honduras. Even after Big Pine 11 officially
ends in late February, hundreds of U.S. military per
sonnel will remain in Honduras until the next exer
cise begins, officials said.
In addition, the Pentagon may seek funds for per
manent bases in Honduras, particularly for a Navy
port at Puerto Castilla, where Navy construction
crews have been working as part of Big Pine 11. U.S.
military officers at the Panama command, headed by
Gen. Paul Gorman, favor such a plan, while some
Pentagon officials in Washington want less elaborate
facilities that could be turned over to the Hondurans
when tensions in the region decline.
The disclosure of the new maneuvers came on the
eve of the release of the broad-ranging Kissinger
Commission report on Central America, which
recommends a mix of economic, diplomatic and mil
itary means to resolve longstanding problems in the
region.
When the Pentagon announced Big Pine 11 last
July, officials said that the large-scale series of
maneuvers, involving all four branches of the U.S.
military, were intended to discourage the leftist San
dinista government of Nicaragua from behaving ag
gressively.
The exercises beginning in June will have the
same purpose and, in order to maintain flexibility
and keep the Nicaraguans off balance, the Pentagon
may not announce a set duration for the maneuvers.
Nicaragua has charged that the exercises are bel
ligerent and intended to encourage the activities of
CIA-funded anti-Sandinista rebels operating from
Honduran territory.
Reagan against tax hike
Washington—President Reagan has indicated to
his economic and White House advisers that he is
leaning against proposing any major tax increase in
his forthcoming fiscal 1985 budget, despite es
timates that the deficit may otherwise be close to
$200 billion, administration officials said yesterday.
Instead, officials said, Reagan and the advisers are
considering possible use of a bipartisan national
commission to deal with the tax-and-deficit issue,
the officials said.
Some officials are talking about a commission that
would begin work earlier this year, others one that
would not convene until after the November elec
tions.
But in any case, such a commission, patterned
after ones on Social Security, the MX missile and
Central America, would mean a "deferred solution"
to the deficit problem, a tacit acknowledgment that
neither Congress nor Reagan is willing to do any
thing this election year, an administration official said.
"It means a conscious choice to wait," the offi
cials added, describing the idea of a commission as a
political device by which Reagan could explain what

he intends to do in tne future about the deficit.
Officials emphasized that they were uncertain
whether the commission proposal will survive the
internal debates at the White House and appear in
the fiscal 1985 budget Reagan is scheduled to submit
to Congress Feb. 1.
U.S. to send envoy to Vatican
Washington—The United States and the Vatican
established full diplomatic relations yesterday after a
break of 117 years, a move the State Department said
should result in "obviously better communications"
between Washington and the headquarters of the
Roman Catholic Church.
President Reagan's decision, reflecting his eager
ness to bolster his administration's standing with the
Catholic hierarchy under Pope John Paul 11, encoun
tered opposition from Protestant circles that was
considerably milder than when similar moves were
attempted in the past.
Reagan nominated William Wilson, an old friend
and California real estate developer, to be ambassa
dor to the Vatican, subject to Senate confirmation.
Wilson has been Reagan's personal representative
to the Vatican since 1981.
The Vatican will also appoint an ambassador,
known as a papal nuncio, to Washington. It has
been represented in Washington by an apostolic
delegate, a post currently held by Archbishop Pio
Laghi.
Reagan made no public comments about his deci
sion, and the first announcement from Washington
— a one sentence statement — was issued by the
State Department nearly five hours after the
Vatican's announcement.
U.S. officials did not dispute a suggestion that the
White House sought to de-emphasize Reagan's role
in the announcement to deflect Protestant criticism
of the move while allowing him to benefit from the
approval of Catholic voters in an election year.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
Reagan acted at the "virtually unanimous recom
mendation of his foreign policy advisers." Speakes
said the move was initiated by Congress last year
when it lifted an 1867 ban on public financing for a
U.S. diplomatic post at the Vatican.
Officials said the move is justified by the impor
tance of the Vatican and the international
humanitarian and moral positions of the Pope, who
has traveled widely in recent years to champion the
causes of peace and charity.
Criticism from some Protestant church groups
seemed much less strident than in 1951, when a

strong outcry forced President Harry Truman to
reverse his decision to resume diplomatic relations
with the Vatican that were severed in 1867.
"I don't see any national outcry against it now,"
said the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the Baptist president and
founder of the Moral Majority, before the an
nouncement was made.
South Africa, Mozambique to talk
Johannesburg, South Africa—ln a move that could
lead to a major de-escalation of tensions in this
region, white-ruled South Africa announced last
night that it will begin a series of negotiations with
the Marxist government of neighboring Mozam
bique.
South Africa reported that four high-level working
groups will meet in the two capitals of Pretoria and
Maputo next Monday to discuss a mutual-security
agreement, financial assistance to Mozambique's
straitened economy, the return of South African
tourists to Mozambique's seaside resorts and the
running of the jointly owned Cahora Bassa
hydroelectric project on the Zambesi River.
There was no confirmation from Mozambique
about the reported talks.
Western observers here welcomed news of the
pending talks, which are the result of painstaking
diplomacy by U.S. and Portuguese intermediaries.
Their efforts began when Mozambique's President
Samora Machel made a six-nation European tour in
October seeking aid and indicating a readiness to
shift more toward the West.
The breakthrough was welcomed particularly be
cause it comes at a time when regional tensions have
been heightened by the current South African mili
tary operation inside Angola against insurgents of
the South West Africa People's Organization
(SWAPO).
Explosion damages Soviet pipeline
Paris—An explosion and fire late last month
caused serious damage to the pipeline under con
struction to carry gas from Soviet Siberia to Western
Europe, sources here and in Washington said yester
day. The reports cast doubt on Soviet claims that the
controversial project has been completed ahead of
schedule.
A French expert associated with the $10 billion
venture said that in his view the pipeline was unlike
ly to become fully operational until at least the end
of 1985—meaning that the project is roughly a year

behind schedule rather than a year ahead as
depicted by Moscow.
French experts involved in the construction of the
2800-mile pipeline disclosed that a fire devastated
the control center at the head station in the Siberian
town of Urengoy. The experts, who did not wish to
be identified for fear of damaging France's eco
nomic ties with the Soviet Union, said the fire oc
curred shortly before Christmas.
U.S. sources in Washington said they also had
reports of a fire in Urengoy that caused "serious
damage" to pipeline facilities.
Prison improvement budgeted
Sacramento—Gov. George Deukmejian has un
veiled a sweeping $1.3 billion long-range building
and maintenance plan for California's overcrowded
prisons and jails, including the construction of ex
panded facilities at Vacaville and Folsom.
Deukmejian presented the $30.3 billion budget for
1984-85 to a joint session of the legislature, meeting
his constitutional deadline for submitting the state
spending plan by Jan. 10.
The proposal calls for $650 million for prisons and
$580 million for local jails, with the money coming
from a mixture of private and public sources, includ
ing voter-approved bonds and a method called
"lease-back."
The governor's plan calls for a $300 million bond
issue for new jail construction to appear on the No
vember ballot.
Deukmejian's proposals must be approved by the
Democrat-controlled legislature to become law. The
new budget is scheduled to go into effect on July 1.
Stocks mixed in heavy trading
New York—Stocks were mixed in heavy trading
yesterday after profit-taking quashed an opening ad
vance that briefly lifted the Dow Jones industrial
average above its record-high close.
Retail, airline, drug and oil-service issues were
numerous among the losers, while some mining and
aerospace stocks rose.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed
5.24 in the first half hour to 1291.46—ab0ve its
record close of 1287.20 reached last Nov. 29.
Today's weather
Sunny with patchy morning fog. Highs from the
mid-50s to the low-60s. Light winds.
