# Res Ed overcharges at least 10

### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The Office of Residential Education launched an
investigation yesterday into why some residents of
the 353 Campus Drive House received incorrect bills
for housing this quarter, according to Director of
Housing Rodger Whitney.
Several residents of the house, which is also
known as the Zete House, who registered Monday
were charged the higher autumn quarter price of
$715 instead of $654, the rate for the winter quarter.
Whitney said his office held a meeting yesterday
to find out why the mistake occurred.
David Evans, resident adviser at the house, said
about 10 residents have told him that they were
billed incorrectly.

Some residents could have unwittingly paid the
incorrect bill, Evans said. "I have only heard from
people who know about it and are upset about it,"
he said.
Residents who paid the incorrect bill will be
refunded or get credit for the $61 difference be
tween the bill and the winter quarter rate, Whitney
said.
Computers that print up the tuition and housing
bills could have been given the wrong information
on the house's winter quarter rate, he said.
"Obviously, when we are dealing with 80
residences it is not impossible for one house to have
a mistake on its rate code," Whitney said.
Patrick O'Reilly, a resident of the house, said he

caught the mistake before he paid
the bill. O'Reilly, a senior, said his
permit to register form for pre
registration charged him $654 for

housing, while the charge on the
form he used to register Monday
was $715.
He told a housing official of the
mistake and the bill was corrected.
"It is unfortunate," that he had to
catch the error, O'Reilly said, add
ing that the University should have
detected the error before mailing

the PTRs.
Two residents of the house were
not as lucky as O'Reilly.
Phillip Kiekhaefer, a senior, said
he did not know the bill was wrong
until informed by The Daily. "I got
overcharged and I didn't even know
about it,"he said.
Eric Cohen, a sophomore, said he

knew that the housing charge on the
PTR he used Monday was higher
than the bill on his pre-registration
PTR.
"I thought maybe the rates had
gone up," Cohen said. "I didn't
realize what was going on. I guess I
feel sort of stupid."
