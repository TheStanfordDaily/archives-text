# Res Ed overcharges at least 10

investigation yesterday into why some residents of
the 353 Campus Drive House received incorrect bills

Housing Rodger Whitney.
Several residents of the house, which is also
known as the Zete House, who registered Monday
were charged the higher autumn quarter price of
$715 instead of $654, the rate for the winter quarter.
Whitney said his office held a meeting yesterday
to find out why the mistake occurred.
David Evans, resident adviser at the house, said
about 10 residents have told him that they were
billed incorrectly.

Some residents could have unwittingly paid the

people who know about it and are upset about it,"
he said.
Residents who paid the incorrect bill will be
refunded or get credit for the $61 difference be
tween the bill and the winter quarter rate, Whitney
said.
Computers that print up the tuition and housing
bills could have been given the wrong information
