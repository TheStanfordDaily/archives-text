## Kennedy praises Hargadon 
### DAVE HALE 
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon "is in a position
to lead national education policy, and I think he should
do it," University President Donald Kennedy told the
Stanford Mother's Club in a speech here yesterday.
"I can be sad for Stanford, but not for Fred," Ken
nedy said, noting Hargadon's decision to assume the
senior vice presidency of the College Board in June.
Kennedy also offered praise for the senior faculty,
student body and the University curriculum.
"Compared with other institutions we are more liq
uid in what we can present academically," he said.
"The degree of involvement of senior faculty is very
good, and students are generally enthusiastic about
their experience."
Kennedy continued, "The basic health of undergrad
uate education is quite good. We cannot underes
timate the capacity of the students to develop by them
selves. Because of the tremendous quality and diversity
of the student body it is difficult to assess the overall ef
fects of the Stanford experience."
Kennedy cited a recent survey of college presidents
published in U.S. News and World Report that ranked
Stanford in first place among large American univer
sities. "I don't really remember filling mine out," he
quipped, adding that he does not "care much for beau
ty contests, although it is much better to finish first in a
beauty contest than last."
The University will have to confront several chal
lenges in the coming years, according to Kennedy, in
cluding the increased demand for housing on campus,
the academic atmosphere and mounting problems of
high tuition and financial aid.
While the new Governor's Corner residences have
increased the housing options open to students, Ken
nedy said students themselves have sparked an in

crease in the demand for housing on campus, so that
the demand for housing remains the same. "We are
running fast just to stay even," he said.
The University plans to take several steps to confront
the problem. First, older, less desireable residences
will be upgraded. In an effort to improve the overall
quality of residential life, the University will provide in
creased incentives for faculty members to become in
volved in Residential Education. Finally, the University
may build more on-campus housing.
Kennedy spoke encouragingly about the energy and
enthusiasm of Stanford students, but added that stu
dents should be motivated to pursue learning experi
ences outside of the classroom.
The intense interest of freshman, the peculiar laxity
of sophomores, the reborn intensity of juniors and
senior "coasting" present special concern to the Uni
versity, Kennedy said.
He added that students should keep an intense inter
est in academic life throughout their four years at Stan
ford.
"Students need to apply some special quality of intel
lectual refreshment in each of the undergraduate
years," Kennedy said.
Kennedy said he was discouraged by the results of
the latest senior survey which reported that seniors had
been unsatisfied with their freshman and undergradu
ate advisers. He outlined a few steps which the Univer
sity will take to improve undergraduate advising.
"We are trying to couple it more closely with the resi
dent system," he said. "We must draw on new people,
make better use of the people we have and eliminate
any advisers who may not be doing their job effective
ly," Kennedy said.
