Pub Nights Are
They are a super chance to meet and party with our class,
but they are potentially dangerous. Every week many of us
drive home who shouldn't. We're not opposed to drinking;
we're merely trying to avert a tragedy. Thus we've organized
DESIGNATED
DRIVER'S PROGRAM
THE IDEA IS SIMPLE:
— Meet with your friends early each week to decide who will drive
and who will drink. Form a car pool.
— Go to Pub Night and those who are the drivers put on a
"DESIGNATED DRIVER" button entitling you to FREE 7-UP
(all the pubs have agreed).
— At each Pub Night we will also post a ride board indicating
which drivers have space available in case you find yourself or
a friend in need of a ride.
In the American League the designated hitter's position is of vital importance.
We hope you'N treat this program with equal respect.
