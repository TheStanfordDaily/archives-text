# Council approves Quad plan
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
The revised Inner Quad renova
tion proposal passed a second
hurdle yesterday, receiving approval
from the Administrative Council,
but several members of the Art De
partment who have voiced objec
tions to the first plan again ex
pressed reservations about some
aspects of this revised plan.
The proposal was passed Tuesday
by the University Committee on
Land and Building Development,
which must approve all building
projects on campus. The renovation
plan now goes to the Board of Trus
tees, which will discuss it at the
February meeting.
Some people in the Art Depart
ment said that although the plan in
corporates significant aspects of the
original design of Frederick Law
Olmsted, the noted landscape archi
tect who planned much of the
campus with Leland Stanford, some
aspects of this second design need
modification in order to remain true
to Olmsted and Stanford's inten
tions.
"It's a vast improvement over
what has been proposed in the
past," said art graduate student
Gerard Koskovich, "but there are
some minor problems with it."
Specifically, Koskovich and Assoc.
Art Prof. Paul Turner said the pres
ent propopal for lighting the court
yard by lamps recessed in the outer
walls of curbs surrounding each
planting circle in the Inner Quad
was anachronistic and inconsistent
with Olmsted's style.
Turner served on the advisory
committee for the project and is an
expert on Olmsted, while Kos
kovich, who has only read reports of
the plan and has not yet seen it, has
done extensive research on
Olmsted's work on campus.
Reaction of other professors in
the Art Department toward the plan
was hesistant, primarily because
they had not seen it. Still, the gen
eral consensus, based on their
reading of press reports of the plan,
seemed to be one of cautious ap
proval of the design as an improve
ment, although there were still ob
jections to some aspects of it.

According to Max Mazenko,
manager of the renovation project,
the advisory committee on the proj
ect will continue to confer up to and
after the February Board of Trustees
meeting to decide on some parts of
the design, including the type of
lighting. He said those who had ex
pressed concern about the plan will
have an opportunity to contribute to
these decisions.
Mazenko said if community reac
tion against the current proposal
forces the University to change it,

he may have to postpone the
February date and possibly come up
with a new plan.
Koskovich, who has been the
leader of those seeking a historically
accurate renovation, said • as
surances about allowing input into
the decision process wete fine, but
that such input should have been
asked for much earlier.
"There are certain fundamental
problems with the Planning Office,"
he said, citing its lack of an experi

enced art historian.
He said the University has had to
rely on individuals, with the excep
tion of Turner, who have no ex
pertise in historical renovation. In
put from those with expertise in the
area, as he claims he has, was not
sought until very late in the planning
process.
Mazenko disagreed with this as
sessment, saying that the advisory
committee has several members
with expertise in the field of art his
tory.
