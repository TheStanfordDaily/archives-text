# Council approves Quad plan
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
The revised Inner Quad renova
tion proposal passed a second
hurdle yesterday, receiving approval
from the Administrative Council,
but several members of the Art De
partment who have voiced objec
tions to the first plan again ex
pressed reservations about some
aspects of this revised plan.
The proposal was passed Tuesday
by the University Committee on
Land and Building Development,
which must approve all building
projects on campus. The renovation
plan now goes to the Board of Trus
tees, which will discuss it at the
February meeting.
Some people in the Art Depart
ment said that although the plan in
corporates significant aspects of the
original design of Frederick Law
Olmsted, the noted landscape archi
tect who planned much of the
campus with Leland Stanford, some
aspects of this second design need
modification in order to remain true
to Olmsted and Stanford's inten
tions.
"It's a vast improvement over
what has been proposed in the
past," said art graduate student
Gerard Koskovich, "but there are
some minor problems with it."
Specifically, Koskovich and Assoc.
Art Prof. Paul Turner said the pres
ent propopal for lighting the court
yard by lamps recessed in the outer
walls of curbs surrounding each
planting circle in the Inner Quad
was anachronistic and inconsistent
with Olmsted's style.
Turner served on the advisory
committee for the project and is an
expert on Olmsted, while Kos
kovich, who has only read reports of
the plan and has not yet seen it, has
done extensive research on
Olmsted's work on campus.
