# Urban studies: major for mayors
## 
### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
So you say you want to be
an architect or a real estate
developer or even the mayor
of San Francisco, but you just
can't find a major that will
prepare you for your career?
Good news. There's a small
group of students, 10 in a
crowded year, and some en
thusiastic faculty members
who think that the Urban
Studies Program might be for
you.
Initiated in 1973, the Urban
Studies Program aims to
prepare students for careers in
urban planning, architecture,
landscape design and city ad
ministration.
"The thing we can do very
well," according to Lyna Wig
gins, acting director of the
program, "is find a place for
people who find that their in
terests are really interdiscipli
nary; they can't quite cope
with straight political science
or straight civil engineering."
As an interdisciplinary pro
gram as opposed to a full de
partment, urban studies al
lows students to design their
own majors, following their
own courses of study in any of
three areas: architec
ture/design, engineer
ing/planning and social sci
ence/policy analysis. And,
because the Urban Studies Pro
gram has no faculty of its own,
students also receive instruc
tion from professors in many
different departments — his
tory, civil engineering, anthro
pology and others — as well as
from "adjunct" professors,
who are professionals from
the Bay Area with an expertise
not represented by Stanford
faculty.
The only requirements are
that majors take five classes
from the core — a group of so
cial science and engineer
ing/planning courses — and
that they submit a written pro
posal stating their reasons for
enrolling in the Urban Studies
Program as well as delineating
their course of study for the
next three years.
Jim Oswald, a recent Stan
ford graduate in urban
studies, found the interdis
ciplinary aspect of the pro
gram to be key. After
"bouncing around" from eco
nomics to international rela
tions, he stumbled upon ur
ban studies, finding it to be an
excellent way to coordinate
many different disciplines into

a successful program.
"People look at a self
designed, urban studies
major, and write it off as a fuz
zy study. I really disagree with
that," Oswald said. " I was
prepared for work in house
planning, city government,
policy-making and real estate.
My background is very deep
and well-rounded."
Oswald is now employed as
an associate planner for the
Stanford Planning Office,
where he administers and
oversees various land-use

'The thing we
can do very
well is find a
place for
people who
find that their
interests are
really interdis
ciplinary; they
can't quite
cope with
straight politi
cal science or
straight civil
engineering.'
-Lyna Wiggins,
acting
director of
urban studies

policies. Other graduates have
gone onto work as land
developers, project and mar
ket analysts, and architects.
Yet this broad spectrum of
graduate careers is spawned
not by a large department,
but, traditionally, by a small,
intimate one, graduating only
five to ten majors per year.
But while some might view
its compact size as a draw
back, urban studies students
praise it as perhaps the pro
gram's strongest asset.
"It's so perfect," exclaimed
senior Beth Nachman. "It's so

personal; you get to meet
such great people because
there are so few of you."
Apparently, the faculty
couldn't be more in agree
ment.
"One nice thing about it,"
said Wiggins,"is that we all get
to know who the majors are,
have lunch together, and
that's what makes Urban
Studies what it is."
Sounds perfect — small pro
gram, versatile degree, well
rounded faculty — but urban
studies is not without its prob-

lems.
For one, due in part to its
size, few are even aware of the
program.
"I don't think that the pro
gram needs to be a whole lot
bigger," said Wiggins, "but I
would hope, on the other
hand, that we could at least
make it public enough so that
people who are interested will
find it. It would be nice if it
were a little more known."
But through the efforts of
enthusiastic students — via
dorm talks and participation in
the Major's Day — interest is

"gradually being stirred
among freshmen and sop
homores," according to Nach
man.
Another problem lies in the
program's reputation as
primarily "pre-architectural,"
a reputation the program
members try vehemently to
dissipate.
Urban studies "doesn't
mean architecture — which is
what a lot of people think —
or even social work. It's that
and a lot of other things too."
In fact, only about 15 per-

cent of urban studies
graduates have gone on to
careers in the architectural
area — fewer than have
pursued law or business.
For Oswald, architecture
was just a component of his
many-faceted degree.
Urban studies "is a super
program for people who are
into planning, design or archi
tecture," Oswald said. "It's
also a lot of excited people
making it all click. It sounds
Utopian, but it is really, really
refreshing."

would hope, on the other
hand, that we could at least
make it public enough so that
people who are interested will
find it. It would be nice if it
were a little more known."
But through the efforts of
enthusiastic students — via
dorm talks and participation in
the Major's Day — interest is

"gradually being stirred
among freshmen and sop
homores," according to Nach
man.
Another problem lies in the
program's reputation as
primarily "pre-architectural,"
a reputation the program
members try vehemently to
dissipate.
Urban studies "doesn't
mean architecture — which is
what a lot of people think —
or even social work. It's that
and a lot of other things too."
In fact, only about 15 per-

cent of urban studies
graduates have gone on to
careers in the architectural
area — fewer than have
pursued law or business.
For Oswald, architecture
was just a component of his
many-faceted degree.
Urban studies "is a super
program for people who are
into planning, design or archi
tecture," Oswald said. "It's
also a lot of excited people
making it all click. It sounds
Utopian, but it is really, really
refreshing."

So you say you want to be
an architect or a real estate
developer or even the mayor
of San Francisco, but you just
can't find a major that will
prepare you for your career?
Good news. There's a small
group of students, 10 in a
crowded year, and some en
thusiastic faculty members
who think that the Urban
Studies Program might be for
you.
Initiated in 1973, the Urban
Studies Program aims to
prepare students for careers in
urban planning, architecture,
landscape design and city ad
ministration.
"The thing we can do very
well," according to Lyna Wig
gins, acting director of the
program, "is find a place for
people who find that their in
terests are really interdiscipli
nary; they can't quite cope
with straight political science
or straight civil engineering."
As an interdisciplinary pro
gram as opposed to a full de
partment, urban studies al
lows students to design their
own majors, following their
own courses of study in any of
three areas: architec
ture/design, engineer
ing/planning and social sci
ence/policy analysis. And,
because the Urban Studies Pro
gram has no faculty of its own,
students also receive instruc
tion from professors in many
different departments — his
tory, civil engineering, anthro
pology and others — as well as
from "adjunct" professors,
who are professionals from
the Bay Area with an expertise
not represented by Stanford
faculty.
The only requirements are
that majors take five classes
from the core — a group of so
cial science and engineer
ing/planning courses — and
that they submit a written pro
posal stating their reasons for
enrolling in the Urban Studies
Program as well as delineating
their course of study for the
next three years.
Jim Oswald, a recent Stan
ford graduate in urban
studies, found the interdis
ciplinary aspect of the pro
gram to be key. After
"bouncing around" from eco
nomics to international rela
tions, he stumbled upon ur
ban studies, finding it to be an
excellent way to coordinate
many different disciplines into

a successful program.
"People look at a self
designed, urban studies
major, and write it off as a fuz
zy study. I really disagree with
that," Oswald said. " I was
prepared for work in house
planning, city government,
policy-making and real estate.
My background is very deep
and well-rounded."
Oswald is now employed as
an associate planner for the
Stanford Planning Office,
where he administers and
oversees various land-use

'The thing we
can do very
well is find a

people who

interests are

acting
director of
urban studies

policies. Other graduates have
gone onto work as land
developers, project and mar
ket analysts, and architects.
Yet this broad spectrum of
graduate careers is spawned
not by a large department,
but, traditionally, by a small,
intimate one, graduating only
five to ten majors per year.
But while some might view
its compact size as a draw
back, urban studies students
praise it as perhaps the pro
gram's strongest asset.
"It's so perfect," exclaimed
senior Beth Nachman. "It's so

personal; you get to meet
such great people because
there are so few of you."
Apparently, the faculty
couldn't be more in agree
ment.
"One nice thing about it,"
said Wiggins,"is that we all get
to know who the majors are,
have lunch together, and
that's what makes Urban
Studies what it is."
Sounds perfect — small pro
gram, versatile degree, well
rounded faculty — but urban
studies is not without its prob-

lems.
For one, due in part to its
size, few are even aware of the
program.
