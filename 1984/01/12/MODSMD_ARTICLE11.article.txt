President Reagan says he is "deeply con
cerned" and "perplexed" by allegations that
• hunger exists in "this great and wealthy na
tion."
Reagan appointed a commission to study the
■ extent of hunger in America because, he
claims, he is so troubled by charges that his so
cial spending cuts have hurt the poor. This
; panel, composed mainly of Republicans,
studied the issue for five months before auth
. oritatively concluding last week that
"allegations of rampant hunger simply cannot
be documented."
,r The commission decided that the total num
ber of hungry people in the United States is
impossible to measure. But the blue-ribbon
.-task force nevertheless did not shy away from
unequivocally concluding that cutbacks in
..federal funding for food assistance have not
hurt the "truly needy."
... The panel conceded that the reductions in
! food assistance have cut benefits for many
! citizens just above the poverty line — but ap
! parently these people do not fit the task force's
j definition of the "truly needy."
The rapid rise in the amount of food given
; out by private-sector charity organizations pro
j vides a "safety net" to ensure that all needy
; Americans have enough to eat, according to
; the commission. Therefore, since "rampant"
[ hunger does not exist in America, the panel
J complacently concluded, there is no need for

major new expenditures for food assistance
programs.
We view these conclusions with skepticism.
The Reagan-appointed task force might cer
tainly be accused of having a bias to search for
evidence belying the prevalence of hunger in
America. Reagan was embarrassed by
Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese's com
ments last month that there are no hungry
Americans; one would expect that he would
not be too anxious to find the poverty his close
adviser has claimed does not exist.
Furthermore, the rise in private sector
charitable food donations does not seem to be
a boon to us; rather, it serves to underscore
the fact that increasing numbers of Americans
must seek sources other than the government
to satisfy their needs for survival.
The government cannot distinguish the
"needy" fiom the "truly needy" simply by
drawing a line between income classifications.
Neither can private agencies be expected to
meet the government's responsibility for
feeding the hungry.
A presidential commission cannot arbitrarily
proclaim that cuts in federal food programs
have not hurt the poor. More time and study —
perhaps by a balanced congressional commis
sion — is needed before the administration can
complacently contend that its food assistance
cuts have not caused any Americans to go
hungry.
