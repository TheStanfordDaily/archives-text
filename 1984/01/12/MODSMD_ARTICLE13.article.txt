# Ringing in the New Year by punching out Big Brother
## 
### 
! It was 11:45 p.m. on Dec. 31. All the
pjeople at the party gathered around the
television to watch the MTV veejays usher
in the New Year. Nathan Cliffnote, a UC-
San Diego communications major was the
host of the party. Nathan had been consid
ered a pseudo-intellectual ever since he
grossly misinterpreted Stanley Kubrick's
Space Odyssey at age seven.
; "Isn't it ironic," he asked his guests
rhetorically, "that we are waiting for a tele
vision to telhas it's 1984?" Everyone politely
ignored the comment.
• The Police's hit single "Every Breath You
T&ke" then came on. Nathan reflected for a
rr)oment and with a tone of self
cpngratulation in his voice made another
brilliant observation: "The Police equal the
Thought Police. The lyrical motif 'I'll be

watching you' is an obvious reference to
Big Brother." This time he was closer to the
truth, but an occasional insight was bound
to leap out of his mouth due to pure chance
and his grave case of logorrhea, a disease of
the mouth which renders its victims
poisonously boring, utterly friendless and
highly qualified to sit on the panel of
"Washington Week in Review." Nathan
lived with the disease, though, because to
be a pundit was his ultimate ambition.
Nathan was going on and on with his 1984
analysis, but now we couldn't ignore him
because he had hit the '"piute" button on
the remote control. I tried to watch MTV
without sound, but I found that exercise to
be even more pointless than watching MTV
with sound.
As the New Year approached, we

prepared to drink the champagne. Nathan,
who at this time was becoming the death of
the party, remarked, "Ahha! The proles
must celebrate the New Year with alcohol.
Notice the parallel between Victory Gin and
Andre Champagne . . When he con
cluded his dissertation on Victory Gin, I
looked at the clock. Damn it, we had
missed New Year's.
It was 12:08 a.m. and the bottles were still
corked. Instead of apologizing, Nathan
pointed out that the New Year was purely
arbitrary anyway so why celebrate at exactly
midnight. Mercifully, a burly, slightly
drunken guest rose from his seat and flat
tened Nathan with a single punch. The mild
display of authoritarianism saved the party
and gave us a real reason to celebrate.
Unfortunately, Nathan is only one of

several aspiring and established pundits
now engaged in what must be a conspiracy
to ruin George Orwell's book. These com
mentators would have us believe that
anything transmitted by television signals
or processed by a computer is a sign of
creeping totalitarianism. But this is not true.
As my sister once said, "I would rather deal
with a computer than a person any day."
The current mania of comparing every
thing to 1984 is not limited only to the West
ern world. Surprisingly, the Russians have
joined in the hype as well, portraying Or
well's book as a depiction of modern
America where the "rule of omnipotent Big
Brother, who is changed every four years, is
undivided and uncontrolled." In the same
article, the Soviet journal New 1 imes, actu
ally quotes from the book — an unprece

dented practice. (A highly precedented
practice occurred two weeks before the ar
ticle appeared: Two men were sentenced
to 11 years hard labor for circulating the
novel.)
All of this hype has succeeded in making
everyone sick of the long-awaited year only
12 days into it. The book will outlive the
temporary frivolity, so instead of wasting
away 1984 calling every television a
"telescreen" and every authority figure
"Big Brother," I suggest we do something
productive. I, for one, plan to join David
Letterman's righteous crusade to rid cable
television of the motion picture Porky s.
What do you plan tcrdo?
