## Why the Stanford Indian was removed as the mascot 
### 
Not long ago, I sat with group of
friends, discussing the depth of the
intellect found among the members
of the Stanford community.
Therefore, I was surprised by Serena
Lee's letter (Daily, Nov. 17). In an at
tempt to clarify the issue for Lee and
others who may be of the same
opinion, I would like to point out a
few of the major arguments sur
rounding the removal of the Stan
ford Indian mascot.
In the first place, the Indian mas
cot is a very degrading and mis
representing figure of the Native
American people. The figure and
the "garb" of the mascot Indian are
very similar to that of a caricature in
a cartoon. This fact only serves to
encourage the idea that Native
Americans are not to be taken
seriously. It is high time that people
realize that Native Americans are a
valid and important part of society.
Put into another, perhaps more
understandable light, consider the
uproar that would result if the Stan
ford mascot were to be proclaimed

the Stanford Rednecks or, perhaps
more suitably, the Stanford
WASPs. After all, aren't both of
these very tangible figures?
By definition, the mascot of any
organization is supposed to repre
sent that particular organization.
How many Native Americans are
currently on the Stanford football
team? None, but we're working on
it. What, exactly, did the Indian mas
cot stand for? Surely not the Univer
sity colors, since most Native
Americans are actually tan, not red.
Also, Lee is not giving the football
players much credit as individuals
when she says that the team would
have a better playing record if they
had a tangible mascot. I have been
under the impression that such
games are played because they are
fun. The motivation in a team comes
from the interaction between the
players in striving to achieve the
same goal — not to better the name
or image of their mascot.

It is my understanding that, at the
time of the removal of the Indian as
mascot, the Stanford community
was given the opportunity to choose
another, less offensive, mascot. The
majority of the community chose
the Stanford Robber Barons, but this
was rejected because of its
derogatory implications. The Car
dinal bird was also rejected because
of the scarcity of the species in this
area. That is a fairly lame excuse —
after all, how many lions do you find
roaming around in Detroit, Mic
higan? Damn few, but that fact
didn't stop the Detroit football team
from choosing that animal as their
mascot.
Perhaps having a more commer
cially acceptable mascot would im
prove the financial situation of the
Athletic Department. However, that
fact does not justify the belittling of
the Native American people or any
other ethnic group for that matter.
