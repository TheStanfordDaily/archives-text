Get out of Lebanon
Our troops in Lebanon could
trigger a nuclear war if we don't get
them out of there quickly.
For many years we and the
Soviets have prevented nuclear war
by avoiding direct military action in
each other's spheres of influence.
We both give indirect help to dissi
dent or rebel groups that we favor,
but U.S. troops don't actually fight
in Poland or Czechoslovakia or
Hungary, and Soviet troops don't
actually fight in Guatemala or El
Salvador. It's simply too dangerous.
In Lebanon we're breaking this
pattern. We've given up attempting
to be a neutral peacekeeper and are
now engaged in open conflict
there. Lebanon is geographically as
close to the U.S.S.R. as we are to
Central America. It stands to reason
that the Soviets will react as we

would react if Soviet troops were
fighting in Central America. We
can't hope to prevail with the num
ber of troops we now have in
Lebanon. If we send in more
troops, sooner or later the Soviets
will feel obliged to act.
Americans differ on the rights
and wrongs of the situation, on
whether we or the Syrians or Is
raelis or Palestinians have a right to
be in Lebanon, but that's a separate
question. Our forces were sent to
Lebanon with assurances that they
were not going into battle. Now
they are taking part in a shooting
war, and by fighting in the Soviet's
backyard, we are in grave danger of
causing a nuclear war. We should
get out now.
