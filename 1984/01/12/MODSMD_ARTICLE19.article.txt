## Crowd could key hoop win over Cal 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The Stanford basketball
team will be doing more than
battling its cross-bay rival
when it takes on UC-Berkeley
Friday night at 8 in Maples
Pavilion.
Coach Tom Davis and his
Cardinal team will be fighting
for survival in the competitive
Pacific-10 Conference.
In what has to be consid
ered a must-win situation for
Stanford — 0-3 in the Pac-10 —
if it hopes to keep its post
season tournament chances
reasonable, Davis and his
players obviously will do
everything possible to win.
But the Card coach told a
handful of reporters gathered
at Stickney's restaurant yester
day that probably the biggest
factor Friday night won't in
volve a basketball.
"Crowd support is so im
portant for our success as a
basketball team," Davis said.
"It creates the type of atmo
sphere that college basketball
is all about."
While basketball's version
of the Big Game will most like
ly be a sell-out, it doesn't
guarantee that the 7500-plus
partisan fans will cheer loudly
and often enough to be a fac
tor in the action on the court.
Against Oregon State last
Thursday and Oregon Satur
day, fairly large crowds (6432
and 5201) were on hand to
watch Stanford lose its
opening two Pac-10 contests.
Neither crowd proved to be
much of a factor.
Then again, the Stanford
Band and most of the student
body was still on break be
tween quarters.
The Band and a handful of
students did make it to Los An
geles Tuesday night, however,

to see the Cardinal fall to the
No. 6 ranked UCLA Bruins, 71-
66.
"I think having the Band
here really helped us emotion
ally," Davis said after the
game in Pauley Pavilion,
where a near-capacity crowd
of 12,401 watched the Briuns
improve their record to 10-1.
"Right now, we need emotion
and the Band epitomizes
that."
The loss to UCLA dropped
Stanford to 11-4 overall and 0-3
in the Pac-10, in which it dear
ly needs to win soon. The Car
dinal, however, has played all
three conference games with
out starting 6 foot-9 forward
Hans Wichary, who is out with
an ankle injury. Another for
ward, 6-4 Andy Fischer,
missed the Los Angeles trip
with back problems.
"If we'd had Wichary or Fis
cher, what would our record
be?" Davis asked. "But you
can't control things like injur
ies."
One thing Davis feels that
can be controlled is the home
crowd, which he hopes will be
a factor Friday night. Large,
vocal home crowds can be the
difference in close games, and
if history is any indication,
Friday's game with Cal will be
decided by only a few points.
"Who knows? We might
have won against Oregon
State and Oregon if the Band
and the students had been
there," Davis said in reference
to the Card's five-point loss to
the Beavers and one-point set
back to the Ducks.
"We're going to win (in the
Pac-10)," he continued. "How
many and when, we don't
know. Last year we go down to
UCLA and lose by 13. This year
we lose to them by five. So it's
just a matter of time."
