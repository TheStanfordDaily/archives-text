# Card loses to high schoolers
## Gymnasts fall to Japan 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON 
The Stanford men's gymnastic team placed
second behind the Japanese All-Star high
school team in an international competition
held at Maples Pavilion Tuesday night.
Along with Stanford and Japan, the other
team competing was UC-Berkeley which
placed third in the competition.
The meet was not decided until the closing
minutes as Stanford and Japan were close
throughout the night. Stanford trailed Japan by
only four-tenths of a point, and Stanford Head
Coach Sadeo Hamada felt that his team lost the
match on vaulting, the final event.
"We really lost it on the last event," Hamada
said. "It was just a bad night for us on vaulting,
and it doesn't reflect workouts. It wasn't at all
expected."
Of the five Stanford vaulters, sophomore
Gary Smith was the only gymnast to have an ex
ceptional night. Smith placed first in vaulting,
scoring 9.45.
Smith also tied for second on floor with a
9.30 and placed sixth all-around with a 53.65. It
appears that Smith is stronger than ever this
year after an unfortunate back injury kept

him from showing his true potential last
season.
Japan's final score in the team competition
was 269.90, followed by Stanford at 266.95 and
Cal with 264.95.
Despite the loss, Hamada was pleased by the
team's performance. Stanford placed in the top
three on each of the six events — a total of nine
out of 18 places.
Four of these individual awards went to first
place all-arounder sophomore Jon Levy.
Levy is a steady and consistent performer.
He took a first place on rings and parallel bars
with 9.45 and 9.20 respectively, tied for first on
high bar with Japan's Tsuruoka with a 9.45,
took second on pommel horse with a 9.25, and
was more than one point ahead of the second
place finisher in the all-around competition.
Other outstanding performers were fresh
man Mark Arnold, who tied for third on rings
with a 9.25, junior Shaun Hoffmeyer, who
placed third on high bar with 9.25, and senior
Jim Campanelli, who placed third on pommel
horse with an 8.85.
The next men's competition will be on Jan.
19 against the University of New Mexico at
Maples Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.
