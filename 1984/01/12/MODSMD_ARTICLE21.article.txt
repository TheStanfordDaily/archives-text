# Card matmen face John Carroll
## 
### PETER CASTILLO 
Cleveland's John Carroll University ventures int<
Maples Pavilion tonight at 6 p.m. to face a troubled but
continually improving Stanford wrestling team.
"I expect a close battle as John Carroll is a top Division
111 school," said Cardinal Coach Chris Horpel. "Right now
our team has a good attitude with injuries still being out
biggest problem."
Three starters will be unable to compete. Heavyweigl
Ed Katz is out for three weeks due to torn knee ligaments
190-pounder Flink Pulskamp has a continuing hip prob
lem, and Jeff Bradley at 142 pounds has a pulled tendon in
his elbow.
Returning to the lineup is Pete Rogers at 150 pounds,
and Scott Wiggen, who is dropping to 142 pounds.
The best match should be at 177 pounds; competing in
that category is Stanford's Jeff Wilson, who is 13-1 so far
this season. His only loss was an injury default.
