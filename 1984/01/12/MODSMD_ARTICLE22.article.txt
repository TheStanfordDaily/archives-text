### 
Dallas (AP) — Major football
powers which had threatened
to pull out of the NCAA were
appeased yesterday when
smaller schools agreed to two
of three demands made by the
larger Division l-A schools.
However, the major football
schools said they would not
be completely satisfied until
they attain their No. 1 goal —
legislative autonomy within
the NCAA.
"I think a lot of people feel a
lot better now," said Wayne
Duke, commissioner of the
Big Ten Conference, as the
NCAA concluded its 78th an
nual convention. "But this is
certainly not the end of it."
Delegates agreed to recon
sider — and then approved —
two proposals whose defeat

Tuesday triggered an angr
barrage toward the small
Division I schools.
One proposal will allow tl
105 Division l-A schools t
have a separate legislativ
meeting in June; the other
lows financially disadvantag<
students to receive tedeial a
in addition to their athlel
scholarship money.
A move to reconsider th<
question on Division Is
autonomy failed by 11 votes
"That remains the ma >
issue facing Division l-A," sa . ;
Vince Dooley, Georgia's foo
ball coach and athletic dire
tor. Dooley startled man
delegates Tuesday evening I
suggesting that Georgia ar
other schools should pull oi '
of the NCAA "as it is presf nt
structured."
