# Streisand brilliant as actress, director in Yentl
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Isaac Bashevis Singer's 20-
page story "Yentl the Yeshiva
Boy" has the complexity of
Shakespeare's sexual disguise
comedies; its compactness is
characteristic of Singer's
pared-down folk fable style,
and so is its toughness. It's a
hard nut with a sour rind, but
Barbra Streisand's screen
adaptation of it, which she co
wrote (with Jack Rosenthal),
co-produced, directed and
stars in, cracks the nut open.
Taking what seems at first a
square, somewhat literal
minded approach to the ma
terial, she misses none of its
levels of meaning; what she
adds are a warmth that is faith
fully Shakespearean and a
silken-edged comic tempera
ment that is distinctly her
own.
The opening shots of the
movie, of 1904 Eastern
European Jews engaged in
typical activity (the women
shop and gossip, the young
men — yeshiva students —
discuss religious texts, the
peddlers hawk), suggest a dis
tilled, modified version of the
"Tradition" number that
begins Fiddler on the Roof —
without the stylization and
without the benefit of Isaac
Stern's violin. A sentimental
generalization of synagogue
chanting blurs the soundtrack,
and David Watkin's photogra
phy has a matching honeyed
softness. But if the film gets
off on the wrong foot, it rights
itself as soon as Barbra
Streisand appears, bursting
with life, her eyes sharp and
shrewd.
Streisand's Yentl has no pa
tience for the chatter of the
other women over which fish
to buy and the latest scandals;
her father (Nehemiah Persoff),
who instructs teenage boys in
Talmud study, has — against
« Jewish tradition — taught her
as well, and her intellectual
fervor has grown in propor
tion with her knowledge.
It is unmistakably one of the
movie's theses that the wo
men around Yentl are small
minded because no attempt
has ever been made to thrust
anything larger than
housekeeping into their
A travelling book ven
dor sells romances for women
and satied volumes (the only
available store of philosophy,
history and literature) for
men, so Yentl can purchase a
sacred text only by pretending
it's a gift for her father.
In these early scenes
Streisand's intellectual energy
and her astounding actress'
instinct keep the movie going,
because despite the lovely
rapport between her and
Nehemiah Persoff, the father
daughter relationship is basi
cally old hat (she has provided

a substitute for the son who
died young etc.), and the di
rection of this part can't seem
to lose its slightly clodhopping
big movie solidity.
In a few moments, however,
Streisand hints at a more un
usual perspective: When
Yentl, alone in her father's
study, dares to try on his
prayer shawl, the camera
remains behind her, framing
her silhouette beneath the
cloth, and there's a fine se
quence in which, stuck up in
the balcony of the segregated
synagogue with the silly, yam
mering ladies of the village,
she looks longingly down at
the praying men.
After the old man's death
the film really begins in ear
nest. Seizing a male right,
Yentl reads Kaddish (the
mourner's chant) over his
grave, and then realizing she
can never be happy leading a
woman's life, she cuts her
hair, binds her breasts,
dresses in young man's cloth
ing, and, calling herself An
shel, she joins a group of stu
dents headed for a yeshiva in
another town.
Streisand has always been a
great camera subject, but in
trousers and spectacles, her
ears sticking out of her
cropped locks, she commands
it in a new way. Her ears are
now as prominent as her nose,
and with those sharp, darting
eyes she looks a little like a
bookish, adolescent mouse.
It's an irresistible comic image
— this intense, awkward,
feminine boy among the other
would-be scholars, trying on
their newly acquired mascu
linity, many of them proudly
sprouting beards, like the
gently handsome Avigdor
(Mandy Patinkin), who
becomes Anshel's comrade
and study partner.
In his two previous screen
appearances, playing E.L.
Doctorow creations — Ta
teh in Ragtime and Paul
Isaacson in Daniel — the stage
actor Mandy Patinkin couldn't
manage to shake off an un
pleasantly ego-centered
theatrical quality. But he
makes a sweetly charming
Avigdor, and not a moment in
his performance rings false
His scenes with Barbra
Streisand are so balanced that
their mutual attraction, which
is in the manner of Orsino's
and Viola's in Twelfth Night,
feels not only right but inevi
table.
Streisand's most successful
leading men have always been
understated actors — David
Selby in Up the Sandbox,
Robert Redford in The Way We
Were, Gene Hackman in her
last film, the extraordinary, al
most unknown comedy All
Night Long — who bring out
her gentle tones, her vul

nerability. (The exception is
The Owl and the Pussycat, in
which she and George
gave perfectly matched .iigi
pitched performances.)
Mandy Patinkin achieves just
that — and in return she
directs him beautifully.
Avigdor is drawn to Anshel's
grasping mind and passion for
arguing Talmud, which equal
his own, and, like Yentl's fa
ther, he sees her as a substi
tute for a dead boy —• his
younger brother, a suit ide.
What he doesn't comprehend
is that his physical playfulness
with Anshel has a sexual com
ponent — but we do, and so
does Anshel, who is conscious
for the first time of her own
feminine sexual desires.

When he shares a bed with
' °r, she invents ■> Jewish law
it I : u I -lors in bed together
must be back to back; "So
turn over, please," she com
mands in the deepest voice
she can muster. (It's an im
perially funny moment.)
This tantalizing, ambiguous
sexual comedy, in which one
character is experiencing
emotions sin l can't control
and the other emotions he in
correctly believes he under
stands, is the tief delight of
As You Like It and Twelfth
Night, though few produc
tions of these plays illuminate
it the way Yentl does. (The
Anshel-Avigdor scenes kept
reminding me of the most in
spired As You Like It I've ever

seen - Robin Phillips at Strat
ford, Ontario in 1977, with
Maggie Smith as Rosalind. In
the mock wedding, the imita
tion of romantic love came so
close to reality that scene
ended with Orlando pulling
back in amazement and
shaking himself, as if trying to
wake up from a seductive,
puzzling dream.)
Of course, this Twelfth
Night has its Olivia. Amy Ir
ving plays Hadass, Avigdor
fiancee; under a thick head of
auburn hair, she looks in
credibly beautiful and exude
a warm, slightly exotit
sexuality (like the women in
Fanny and Alexander). She
and Avigdor love each other,
but her father (played with dry

wit by Steven Hill) learns of
the suicide in Avigdor's family
and, fearing a melancholi'
streak may run through the
older brother too, calls off the
wedding.
Looking around for a substi
tute groom, Hadass and her
parents light on Anshel, who
dinnei at Hadass' house many
times, and Avigdor, deluding
friend, his surrogate kid bro
agrees — partly because she
believes it will make Avigdor
happy, partly because by in
forming him of Hadass still
burning ardor she can declare

thrust of Singer's story) out of
an obstinate curiosity about
night by declining to con
summate the marriage, ai-
Hadass' virginal terror. And

shifts entirely from Avigdor lo


INCOGNITO: Barbra Streisand >tars as Yentl, a young Jewish woman living pursue an education
in turn-of-the-century Europe who must disguise herself as a man in order to the film
her new "husband."
It is in the Anshel-Hadass
scenes that Streisand does her
strongest directing. Amy Ir
ving and Streisand make an in
spired pair: Irving's voice is
much deeper than Streisand's
(a brilliant touch), she is
darker, and she shows comic
flair. (After her fatuous, un
comfortable posturing in the
stage production of Amadeus,
in which she was stuck in the
role of Mozart's wife, she
must have found playing a real
woman in Yentl a relief.)
In their first scene together,
Streisand lets us see not only
Anshel's trepidation but also
Hadass' desperate need to
make Anshel fall in love with
her, so that she won't be
married off to a stranger. The
wedding night sequence is a
genuine surprise, for the audi
ence and for Yentl, too, who
— conspiring with Hadass to
fake the loss of her virginity by
spilling wine on the sheets —
behaves like a joyful, giggling
schoolgirl for quite likely the
first time in her life. And when
Hadass responds to Anshel's
emotional generosity, which
derives partly from her under
standing of another woman's
feelings, we see that Anshel
does indeed love Hadass,
though not with a sexual love.
You won't find these fine
shadings in Singer's story, and
I don't imagine a male
adaptor-director would have
provided them, or given the
scenes between Anshel and
Hadass this kind of delicacy.
Yentl is one of the few movies
I can think of that reveals a dis
tinctly feminine sensibility.
It's impossible to think
about any part of this movie
without thinking of Barbra
Streisand, and not just be
cause her name dominates the
credits. The entire movie has
been conceived as an expres
sion of Yentl's point of view.
The most ticklish (and visually
imaginative) instance of this
scheme occurs when Avigdor
strips to go swimming with the
other yeshiva students and
tries to coax Anshel to join
him: The camera pans up
Avigdor's naked body and

stops below the crotch, be
cause Yentl won't let herself
look at his genitals.
The most troublesome ex
tension of the unified-point
of-view structure is in the
songs, which form a kind of
interior monologue that coun
terpoints the dialogue in most
of the key scenes. It's a great
idea (even though it precludes
the possibility of any duets or
trios), or it would be if
Streisand had better taste in
songwriters. But the songs are
tinkling mediocrities by Mic
hel Legrand, with painfully
banal, overexplicit lyrics by
those Hollywood theme song
terrors, Marilyn and Alan
Bergman, who have never, to
my knowledge, risen to a
single dramatic occasion.
The fact that Streisand sings
the songs in Yentl with the
same conviction she lent to
the Bergmans' lyrics for "The
Way We Were" a decade ago
— that is, as if they had
escaped from the pen of a
Lorenz Hart or a Stephen
Sondheim — helps con
siderably, as does the fact that
she is in magnificent voice,
but there is too damn much
bad music for us to pretend

not to notice it.
Furthermore, it's impossible
to watch Yentl without seeing
Streisand's identification with
the title character. Streisand
struggled for years to gel
"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy" on
film, and when she had to turn
writer-producer-director her
self to do so, Hollywood took
a typically jeering attitude to
what it saw as her egotism. Of
course, there's always been a
resistance to Barbra Streisand
among men (and women, too)
who find aggressive female
performers strident and unset
tling.
Yentl's audacious, extrava
gant efforts to win the right to
study Talmud parallel
Streisand's ambitions for her
movie. And though that iden
tification may have led her to
make her worst mistake in the
picture, the only mistake that
violates the spirit of Singer's
story — giving it an upbeat
musical comedy finish lifted
from the "Don't Rain on My
Parade" number in Funny Girl
(which had already been
reprised in Funny Lady) — in
every other way Yentl is a form
of self-expression rather than
self-indulgence.
Isaac Bashevis Singer's 20-
page story "Yentl the Yeshiva
Boy" has the complexity of
Shakespeare's sexual disguise
comedies; its compactness is
characteristic of Singer's
pared-down folk fable style,
and so is its toughness. It's a

wrote (with Jack Rosenthal),
co-produced, directed and

arguing Talmud, which equal
his own, and, like Yentl's fa
ther, he sees her as a substi
tute for a dead boy —• his
younger brother, a suit ide.
What he doesn't comprehend
is that his physical playfulness
with Anshel has a sexual com
ponent — but we do, and so
does Anshel, who is conscious
for the first time of her own
feminine sexual desires.

This tantalizing, ambiguous
sexual comedy, in which one
character is experiencing
emotions sin l can't control
and the other emotions he in
correctly believes he under
stands, is the tief delight of
As You Like It and Twelfth
Night, though few produc
tions of these plays illuminate
it the way Yentl does. (The
Anshel-Avigdor scenes kept
reminding me of the most in
spired As You Like It I've ever

seen - Robin Phillips at Strat
ford, Ontario in 1977, with
Maggie Smith as Rosalind. In
the mock wedding, the imita
tion of romantic love came so
close to reality that scene
ended with Orlando pulling
back in amazement and
shaking himself, as if trying to
wake up from a seductive,
puzzling dream.)
Of course, this Twelfth
Night has its Olivia. Amy Ir
ving plays Hadass, Avigdor
fiancee; under a thick head of
auburn hair, she looks in
credibly beautiful and exude
a warm, slightly exotit
sexuality (like the women in
Fanny and Alexander). She
and Avigdor love each other,
but her father (played with dry

wit by Steven Hill) learns of
the suicide in Avigdor's family
and, fearing a melancholi'
streak may run through the
older brother too, calls off the
wedding.
Looking around for a substi
tute groom, Hadass and her
parents light on Anshel, who
dinnei at Hadass' house many
times, and Avigdor, deluding
friend, his surrogate kid bro
agrees — partly because she
believes it will make Avigdor
happy, partly because by in
forming him of Hadass still
burning ardor she can declare

INCOGNITO: Barbra Streisand >tars as Yentl, a young Jewish woman living pursue an education
in turn-of-the-century Europe who must disguise herself as a man in order to the film
her new "husband."
It is in the Anshel-Hadass
scenes that Streisand does her
strongest directing. Amy Ir
ving and Streisand make an in
spired pair: Irving's voice is
much deeper than Streisand's
(a brilliant touch), she is
darker, and she shows comic
flair. (After her fatuous, un
comfortable posturing in the
stage production of Amadeus,
in which she was stuck in the
role of Mozart's wife, she
must have found playing a real
woman in Yentl a relief.)
In their first scene together,
Streisand lets us see not only
Anshel's trepidation but also
Hadass' desperate need to
make Anshel fall in love with
her, so that she won't be
married off to a stranger. The
wedding night sequence is a
genuine surprise, for the audi
ence and for Yentl, too, who
— conspiring with Hadass to
fake the loss of her virginity by
spilling wine on the sheets —
behaves like a joyful, giggling
schoolgirl for quite likely the
first time in her life. And when
Hadass responds to Anshel's
emotional generosity, which
derives partly from her under
standing of another woman's
feelings, we see that Anshel
does indeed love Hadass,
though not with a sexual love.
You won't find these fine
shadings in Singer's story, and
I don't imagine a male
adaptor-director would have
provided them, or given the
scenes between Anshel and
Hadass this kind of delicacy.
Yentl is one of the few movies
I can think of that reveals a dis
tinctly feminine sensibility.
It's impossible to think
about any part of this movie
without thinking of Barbra
Streisand, and not just be
cause her name dominates the
credits. The entire movie has
been conceived as an expres
sion of Yentl's point of view.
The most ticklish (and visually
imaginative) instance of this
scheme occurs when Avigdor
strips to go swimming with the
other yeshiva students and
tries to coax Anshel to join
him: The camera pans up
Avigdor's naked body and

stops below the crotch, be
cause Yentl won't let herself
look at his genitals.
The most troublesome ex
tension of the unified-point
of-view structure is in the
songs, which form a kind of
interior monologue that coun
terpoints the dialogue in most
of the key scenes. It's a great
idea (even though it precludes
the possibility of any duets or
trios), or it would be if
Streisand had better taste in
songwriters. But the songs are
tinkling mediocrities by Mic
hel Legrand, with painfully
banal, overexplicit lyrics by
those Hollywood theme song
terrors, Marilyn and Alan
Bergman, who have never, to
my knowledge, risen to a
single dramatic occasion.
The fact that Streisand sings
the songs in Yentl with the
same conviction she lent to
the Bergmans' lyrics for "The
Way We Were" a decade ago
— that is, as if they had
escaped from the pen of a
Lorenz Hart or a Stephen
Sondheim — helps con
siderably, as does the fact that
she is in magnificent voice,
but there is too damn much
bad music for us to pretend

not to notice it.
Furthermore, it's impossible
to watch Yentl without seeing
Streisand's identification with
the title character. Streisand
struggled for years to gel
"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy" on
film, and when she had to turn
writer-producer-director her
self to do so, Hollywood took
a typically jeering attitude to
what it saw as her egotism. Of
course, there's always been a
resistance to Barbra Streisand
among men (and women, too)
who find aggressive female
performers strident and unset
tling.
Yentl's audacious, extrava
gant efforts to win the right to
study Talmud parallel
Streisand's ambitions for her
movie. And though that iden
tification may have led her to
make her worst mistake in the
picture, the only mistake that
violates the spirit of Singer's
story — giving it an upbeat
musical comedy finish lifted
from the "Don't Rain on My
Parade" number in Funny Girl
(which had already been
reprised in Funny Lady) — in
every other way Yentl is a form
of self-expression rather than
self-indulgence.
Isaac Bashevis Singer's 20-
page story "Yentl the Yeshiva
Boy" has the complexity of
Shakespeare's sexual disguise
comedies; its compactness is
characteristic of Singer's
pared-down folk fable style,
and so is its toughness. It's a
hard nut with a sour rind, but
Barbra Streisand's screen
adaptation of it, which she co
wrote (with Jack Rosenthal),
co-produced, directed and
stars in, cracks the nut open.
Taking what seems at first a
square, somewhat literal
minded approach to the ma
terial, she misses none of its
levels of meaning; what she
adds are a warmth that is faith
fully Shakespearean and a
silken-edged comic tempera
ment that is distinctly her
own.
The opening shots of the
movie, of 1904 Eastern
European Jews engaged in
typical activity (the women
shop and gossip, the young
men — yeshiva students —
discuss religious texts, the
peddlers hawk), suggest a dis
tilled, modified version of the
"Tradition" number that
begins Fiddler on the Roof —
without the stylization and
without the benefit of Isaac
Stern's violin. A sentimental
generalization of synagogue
chanting blurs the soundtrack,
and David Watkin's photogra
phy has a matching honeyed
softness. But if the film gets
off on the wrong foot, it rights
itself as soon as Barbra
Streisand appears, bursting
with life, her eyes sharp and
shrewd.
Streisand's Yentl has no pa
tience for the chatter of the
other women over which fish
to buy and the latest scandals;
her father (Nehemiah Persoff),
who instructs teenage boys in
Talmud study, has — against
« Jewish tradition — taught her
as well, and her intellectual
fervor has grown in propor
tion with her knowledge.
It is unmistakably one of the
movie's theses that the wo
men around Yentl are small
minded because no attempt
has ever been made to thrust
anything larger than
housekeeping into their
A travelling book ven
dor sells romances for women
and satied volumes (the only
available store of philosophy,
history and literature) for
men, so Yentl can purchase a
sacred text only by pretending
it's a gift for her father.
In these early scenes
Streisand's intellectual energy
and her astounding actress'
instinct keep the movie going,
because despite the lovely
rapport between her and
Nehemiah Persoff, the father
daughter relationship is basi
cally old hat (she has provided

a substitute for the son who
died young etc.), and the di
rection of this part can't seem
to lose its slightly clodhopping
big movie solidity.
In a few moments, however,
Streisand hints at a more un
usual perspective: When
Yentl, alone in her father's
study, dares to try on his
prayer shawl, the camera
remains behind her, framing
her silhouette beneath the
cloth, and there's a fine se
quence in which, stuck up in
the balcony of the segregated
synagogue with the silly, yam
mering ladies of the village,
she looks longingly down at
the praying men.
After the old man's death
the film really begins in ear
nest. Seizing a male right,
Yentl reads Kaddish (the
mourner's chant) over his
grave, and then realizing she
can never be happy leading a
woman's life, she cuts her
hair, binds her breasts,
dresses in young man's cloth
ing, and, calling herself An
shel, she joins a group of stu
dents headed for a yeshiva in
another town.
Streisand has always been a
great camera subject, but in
trousers and spectacles, her
ears sticking out of her
cropped locks, she commands
it in a new way. Her ears are
now as prominent as her nose,
and with those sharp, darting
eyes she looks a little like a
bookish, adolescent mouse.
It's an irresistible comic image
— this intense, awkward,
feminine boy among the other
would-be scholars, trying on
their newly acquired mascu
linity, many of them proudly
sprouting beards, like the
gently handsome Avigdor
(Mandy Patinkin), who
becomes Anshel's comrade
and study partner.
In his two previous screen
appearances, playing E.L.
Doctorow creations — Ta
teh in Ragtime and Paul
Isaacson in Daniel — the stage
actor Mandy Patinkin couldn't
manage to shake off an un
pleasantly ego-centered
theatrical quality. But he
makes a sweetly charming
Avigdor, and not a moment in
his performance rings false
His scenes with Barbra
Streisand are so balanced that
their mutual attraction, which
is in the manner of Orsino's
and Viola's in Twelfth Night,
feels not only right but inevi
table.
Streisand's most successful
leading men have always been
understated actors — David
Selby in Up the Sandbox,
Robert Redford in The Way We
Were, Gene Hackman in her
last film, the extraordinary, al
most unknown comedy All
Night Long — who bring out
her gentle tones, her vul

nerability. (The exception is
The Owl and the Pussycat, in
which she and George
gave perfectly matched .iigi
pitched performances.)
Mandy Patinkin achieves just
that — and in return she
directs him beautifully.
Avigdor is drawn to Anshel's
grasping mind and passion for
arguing Talmud, which equal
his own, and, like Yentl's fa
ther, he sees her as a substi
tute for a dead boy —• his
younger brother, a suit ide.
What he doesn't comprehend
is that his physical playfulness
with Anshel has a sexual com
ponent — but we do, and so
does Anshel, who is conscious
for the first time of her own
feminine sexual desires.

trios), or it would be if
Streisand had better taste in
songwriters. But the songs are
tinkling mediocrities by Mic
hel Legrand, with painfully
banal, overexplicit lyrics by
those Hollywood theme song
terrors, Marilyn and Alan
Bergman, who have never, to
my knowledge, risen to a
single dramatic occasion.
The fact that Streisand sings
the songs in Yentl with the
same conviction she lent to
the Bergmans' lyrics for "The
Way We Were" a decade ago
— that is, as if they had
escaped from the pen of a
Lorenz Hart or a Stephen
Sondheim — helps con
siderably, as does the fact that
she is in magnificent voice,
but there is too damn much
bad music for us to pretend

not to notice it.
Furthermore, it's impossible
to watch Yentl without seeing
Streisand's identification with
the title character. Streisand
struggled for years to gel
"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy" on
film, and when she had to turn
writer-producer-director her
self to do so, Hollywood took
a typically jeering attitude to
what it saw as her egotism. Of
course, there's always been a
resistance to Barbra Streisand
among men (and women, too)
who find aggressive female
performers strident and unset
tling.
Yentl's audacious, extrava
gant efforts to win the right to
study Talmud parallel
Streisand's ambitions for her
movie. And though that iden
tification may have led her to
make her worst mistake in the
picture, the only mistake that
violates the spirit of Singer's
story — giving it an upbeat
musical comedy finish lifted
from the "Don't Rain on My
Parade" number in Funny Girl
(which had already been
reprised in Funny Lady) — in
every other way Yentl is a form
of self-expression rather than
self-indulgence.
Isaac Bashevis Singer's 20-
page story "Yentl the Yeshiva
Boy" has the complexity of
Shakespeare's sexual disguise
comedies; its compactness is
characteristic of Singer's
pared-down folk fable style,
and so is its toughness. It's a
hard nut with a sour rind, but
Barbra Streisand's screen
adaptation of it, which she co
wrote (with Jack Rosenthal),
co-produced, directed and
stars in, cracks the nut open.
Taking what seems at first a
square, somewhat literal
minded approach to the ma
terial, she misses none of its
levels of meaning; what she
adds are a warmth that is faith
fully Shakespearean and a
silken-edged comic tempera
ment that is distinctly her
own.
The opening shots of the
movie, of 1904 Eastern
European Jews engaged in
typical activity (the women
shop and gossip, the young
men — yeshiva students —
discuss religious texts, the
peddlers hawk), suggest a dis
tilled, modified version of the
"Tradition" number that
begins Fiddler on the Roof —
without the stylization and
without the benefit of Isaac
Stern's violin. A sentimental
generalization of synagogue
chanting blurs the soundtrack,
and David Watkin's photogra
phy has a matching honeyed
softness. But if the film gets
off on the wrong foot, it rights
itself as soon as Barbra
Streisand appears, bursting
with life, her eyes sharp and
shrewd.
Streisand's Yentl has no pa
tience for the chatter of the
other women over which fish
to buy and the latest scandals;
her father (Nehemiah Persoff),
who instructs teenage boys in
Talmud study, has — against
« Jewish tradition — taught her
as well, and her intellectual
fervor has grown in propor
tion with her knowledge.
It is unmistakably one of the
movie's theses that the wo
men around Yentl are small
minded because no attempt
has ever been made to thrust
anything larger than
housekeeping into their
A travelling book ven
dor sells romances for women
and satied volumes (the only
available store of philosophy,
history and literature) for
men, so Yentl can purchase a
sacred text only by pretending
it's a gift for her father.
In these early scenes
Streisand's intellectual energy
and her astounding actress'
instinct keep the movie going,
because despite the lovely
rapport between her and
Nehemiah Persoff, the father
daughter relationship is basi
cally old hat (she has provided

a substitute for the son who
died young etc.), and the di
rection of this part can't seem
to lose its slightly clodhopping
big movie solidity.
In a few moments, however,
Streisand hints at a more un
usual perspective: When
Yentl, alone in her father's
study, dares to try on his
prayer shawl, the camera
remains behind her, framing
her silhouette beneath the
cloth, and there's a fine se
quence in which, stuck up in
the balcony of the segregated
synagogue with the silly, yam
mering ladies of the village,
she looks longingly down at
the praying men.
After the old man's death
the film really begins in ear
nest. Seizing a male right,
Yentl reads Kaddish (the
mourner's chant) over his
grave, and then realizing she
can never be happy leading a
woman's life, she cuts her
hair, binds her breasts,
dresses in young man's cloth
ing, and, calling herself An
shel, she joins a group of stu
dents headed for a yeshiva in
another town.
Streisand has always been a
great camera subject, but in
trousers and spectacles, her
ears sticking out of her
cropped locks, she commands
it in a new way. Her ears are
now as prominent as her nose,
and with those sharp, darting
eyes she looks a little like a
bookish, adolescent mouse.
It's an irresistible comic image
— this intense, awkward,
feminine boy among the other
would-be scholars, trying on
their newly acquired mascu
linity, many of them proudly
sprouting beards, like the
gently handsome Avigdor
(Mandy Patinkin), who
becomes Anshel's comrade
and study partner.
In his two previous screen
appearances, playing E.L.
Doctorow creations — Ta
teh in Ragtime and Paul
Isaacson in Daniel — the stage
actor Mandy Patinkin couldn't
manage to shake off an un
pleasantly ego-centered
theatrical quality. But he
makes a sweetly charming
Avigdor, and not a moment in
his performance rings false
His scenes with Barbra
Streisand are so balanced that
their mutual attraction, which
is in the manner of Orsino's
and Viola's in Twelfth Night,
feels not only right but inevi
table.
Streisand's most successful
leading men have always been
understated actors — David
Selby in Up the Sandbox,
Robert Redford in The Way We
Were, Gene Hackman in her
last film, the extraordinary, al
most unknown comedy All
Night Long — who bring out
her gentle tones, her vul

nerability. (The exception is
The Owl and the Pussycat, in
which she and George
gave perfectly matched .iigi
pitched performances.)
Mandy Patinkin achieves just
that — and in return she
directs him beautifully.
Avigdor is drawn to Anshel's
grasping mind and passion for
arguing Talmud, which equal
his own, and, like Yentl's fa
ther, he sees her as a substi
tute for a dead boy —• his
younger brother, a suit ide.
What he doesn't comprehend
is that his physical playfulness
with Anshel has a sexual com
ponent — but we do, and so
does Anshel, who is conscious
for the first time of her own
feminine sexual desires.

When he shares a bed with
' °r, she invents ■> Jewish law
it I : u I -lors in bed together
must be back to back; "So
turn over, please," she com
mands in the deepest voice
she can muster. (It's an im
perially funny moment.)
This tantalizing, ambiguous
sexual comedy, in which one
character is experiencing
emotions sin l can't control
and the other emotions he in
correctly believes he under
stands, is the tief delight of
As You Like It and Twelfth
Night, though few produc
tions of these plays illuminate
it the way Yentl does. (The
Anshel-Avigdor scenes kept
reminding me of the most in
spired As You Like It I've ever

seen - Robin Phillips at Strat
ford, Ontario in 1977, with
Maggie Smith as Rosalind. In
the mock wedding, the imita
tion of romantic love came so
close to reality that scene
ended with Orlando pulling
back in amazement and
shaking himself, as if trying to
wake up from a seductive,
puzzling dream.)
Of course, this Twelfth
Night has its Olivia. Amy Ir
ving plays Hadass, Avigdor
fiancee; under a thick head of
auburn hair, she looks in
credibly beautiful and exude
a warm, slightly exotit
sexuality (like the women in
Fanny and Alexander). She
and Avigdor love each other,
but her father (played with dry

wit by Steven Hill) learns of
the suicide in Avigdor's family
and, fearing a melancholi'
streak may run through the
older brother too, calls off the
wedding.
Looking around for a substi
tute groom, Hadass and her
parents light on Anshel, who
dinnei at Hadass' house many
times, and Avigdor, deluding
friend, his surrogate kid bro
agrees — partly because she
believes it will make Avigdor
happy, partly because by in
forming him of Hadass still
burning ardor she can declare

thrust of Singer's story) out of
an obstinate curiosity about
night by declining to con
summate the marriage, ai-
Hadass' virginal terror. And

INCOGNITO: Barbra Streisand >tars as Yentl, a young Jewish woman living pursue an education
in turn-of-the-century Europe who must disguise herself as a man in order to the film
her new "husband."
It is in the Anshel-Hadass
scenes that Streisand does her
strongest directing. Amy Ir
ving and Streisand make an in
spired pair: Irving's voice is
much deeper than Streisand's
(a brilliant touch), she is
darker, and she shows comic
flair. (After her fatuous, un
comfortable posturing in the
stage production of Amadeus,
in which she was stuck in the
role of Mozart's wife, she
must have found playing a real
woman in Yentl a relief.)
In their first scene together,
Streisand lets us see not only
Anshel's trepidation but also
Hadass' desperate need to
make Anshel fall in love with
her, so that she won't be
married off to a stranger. The
wedding night sequence is a
genuine surprise, for the audi
ence and for Yentl, too, who
— conspiring with Hadass to
fake the loss of her virginity by
spilling wine on the sheets —
behaves like a joyful, giggling
schoolgirl for quite likely the
first time in her life. And when
Hadass responds to Anshel's
emotional generosity, which
derives partly from her under
standing of another woman's
feelings, we see that Anshel
does indeed love Hadass,
though not with a sexual love.
You won't find these fine
shadings in Singer's story, and
I don't imagine a male
adaptor-director would have
provided them, or given the
scenes between Anshel and
Hadass this kind of delicacy.
Yentl is one of the few movies
I can think of that reveals a dis
tinctly feminine sensibility.
It's impossible to think
about any part of this movie
without thinking of Barbra
Streisand, and not just be
cause her name dominates the
credits. The entire movie has
been conceived as an expres
sion of Yentl's point of view.
The most ticklish (and visually
imaginative) instance of this
scheme occurs when Avigdor
strips to go swimming with the
other yeshiva students and
tries to coax Anshel to join
him: The camera pans up
Avigdor's naked body and

stops below the crotch, be
cause Yentl won't let herself
look at his genitals.
The most troublesome ex
tension of the unified-point
of-view structure is in the
songs, which form a kind of
interior monologue that coun
terpoints the dialogue in most
of the key scenes. It's a great
idea (even though it precludes
the possibility of any duets or
trios), or it would be if
Streisand had better taste in
songwriters. But the songs are
tinkling mediocrities by Mic
hel Legrand, with painfully
banal, overexplicit lyrics by
those Hollywood theme song
terrors, Marilyn and Alan
Bergman, who have never, to
my knowledge, risen to a
single dramatic occasion.
The fact that Streisand sings
the songs in Yentl with the

shel, she joins a group of stu
dents headed for a yeshiva in
another town.
Streisand has always been a
great camera subject, but in
trousers and spectacles, her
ears sticking out of her
cropped locks, she commands
it in a new way. Her ears are
now as prominent as her nose,
and with those sharp, darting
eyes she looks a little like a
bookish, adolescent mouse.
It's an irresistible comic image
— this intense, awkward,
feminine boy among the other
would-be scholars, trying on
their newly acquired mascu
linity, many of them proudly
sprouting beards, like the
gently handsome Avigdor
(Mandy Patinkin), who
becomes Anshel's comrade
and study partner.
In his two previous screen
appearances, playing E.L.
Doctorow creations — Ta
teh in Ragtime and Paul
Isaacson in Daniel — the stage
actor Mandy Patinkin couldn't
manage to shake off an un
pleasantly ego-centered
theatrical quality. But he
makes a sweetly charming
Avigdor, and not a moment in
his performance rings false
His scenes with Barbra
Streisand are so balanced that
their mutual attraction, which
is in the manner of Orsino's
and Viola's in Twelfth Night,
feels not only right but inevi
table.
Streisand's most successful
leading men have always been
understated actors — David
Selby in Up the Sandbox,
Robert Redford in The Way We
Were, Gene Hackman in her
last film, the extraordinary, al
most unknown comedy All
Night Long — who bring out
her gentle tones, her vul

nerability. (The exception is
The Owl and the Pussycat, in
which she and George
gave perfectly matched .iigi
pitched performances.)
Mandy Patinkin achieves just
that — and in return she
directs him beautifully.
Avigdor is drawn to Anshel's
grasping mind and passion for
arguing Talmud, which equal
his own, and, like Yentl's fa
ther, he sees her as a substi
tute for a dead boy —• his
younger brother, a suit ide.
What he doesn't comprehend
is that his physical playfulness
with Anshel has a sexual com
ponent — but we do, and so
does Anshel, who is conscious
for the first time of her own
feminine sexual desires.

When he shares a bed with
' °r, she invents ■> Jewish law
it I : u I -lors in bed together
must be back to back; "So
turn over, please," she com
mands in the deepest voice
she can muster. (It's an im
perially funny moment.)
This tantalizing, ambiguous
sexual comedy, in which one
character is experiencing
emotions sin l can't control
and the other emotions he in
correctly believes he under
stands, is the tief delight of
As You Like It and Twelfth
Night, though few produc
tions of these plays illuminate
it the way Yentl does. (The
Anshel-Avigdor scenes kept
reminding me of the most in
spired As You Like It I've ever

seen - Robin Phillips at Strat
ford, Ontario in 1977, with
Maggie Smith as Rosalind. In
the mock wedding, the imita
tion of romantic love came so
close to reality that scene
ended with Orlando pulling
back in amazement and
shaking himself, as if trying to
wake up from a seductive,
puzzling dream.)
Of course, this Twelfth
Night has its Olivia. Amy Ir
ving plays Hadass, Avigdor
fiancee; under a thick head of
auburn hair, she looks in
credibly beautiful and exude
a warm, slightly exotit
sexuality (like the women in
Fanny and Alexander). She
and Avigdor love each other,
but her father (played with dry

wit by Steven Hill) learns of
the suicide in Avigdor's family
and, fearing a melancholi'
streak may run through the
older brother too, calls off the
wedding.
Looking around for a substi
tute groom, Hadass and her
parents light on Anshel, who
dinnei at Hadass' house many
times, and Avigdor, deluding
friend, his surrogate kid bro
agrees — partly because she
believes it will make Avigdor
happy, partly because by in
forming him of Hadass still
burning ardor she can declare

thrust of Singer's story) out of
an obstinate curiosity about
night by declining to con
summate the marriage, ai-
Hadass' virginal terror. And

INCOGNITO: Barbra Streisand >tars as Yentl, a young Jewish woman living pursue an education
in turn-of-the-century Europe who must disguise herself as a man in order to the film
her new "husband."
It is in the Anshel-Hadass
scenes that Streisand does her
strongest directing. Amy Ir
ving and Streisand make an in
spired pair: Irving's voice is
much deeper than Streisand's
(a brilliant touch), she is
darker, and she shows comic
flair. (After her fatuous, un
comfortable posturing in the
stage production of Amadeus,
in which she was stuck in the
role of Mozart's wife, she
must have found playing a real
woman in Yentl a relief.)
In their first scene together,
Streisand lets us see not only
Anshel's trepidation but also
Hadass' desperate need to
make Anshel fall in love with
her, so that she won't be
married off to a stranger. The
wedding night sequence is a
genuine surprise, for the audi
ence and for Yentl, too, who
— conspiring with Hadass to
fake the loss of her virginity by
spilling wine on the sheets —
behaves like a joyful, giggling
schoolgirl for quite likely the
first time in her life. And when
Hadass responds to Anshel's
emotional generosity, which
derives partly from her under
standing of another woman's
feelings, we see that Anshel
does indeed love Hadass,
though not with a sexual love.
You won't find these fine
shadings in Singer's story, and
I don't imagine a male
adaptor-director would have
provided them, or given the
scenes between Anshel and
Hadass this kind of delicacy.
Yentl is one of the few movies
I can think of that reveals a dis
tinctly feminine sensibility.
It's impossible to think
about any part of this movie
without thinking of Barbra
Streisand, and not just be
cause her name dominates the
credits. The entire movie has
been conceived as an expres
sion of Yentl's point of view.
The most ticklish (and visually
imaginative) instance of this
scheme occurs when Avigdor
strips to go swimming with the
other yeshiva students and
tries to coax Anshel to join
him: The camera pans up
Avigdor's naked body and

stops below the crotch, be
cause Yentl won't let herself
look at his genitals.
The most troublesome ex
tension of the unified-point
of-view structure is in the
songs, which form a kind of
interior monologue that coun
terpoints the dialogue in most
of the key scenes. It's a great
idea (even though it precludes
the possibility of any duets or
trios), or it would be if
Streisand had better taste in
songwriters. But the songs are
tinkling mediocrities by Mic
hel Legrand, with painfully
banal, overexplicit lyrics by
those Hollywood theme song
terrors, Marilyn and Alan
Bergman, who have never, to
my knowledge, risen to a
single dramatic occasion.
The fact that Streisand sings
the songs in Yentl with the
same conviction she lent to
the Bergmans' lyrics for "The
Way We Were" a decade ago
— that is, as if they had
escaped from the pen of a
Lorenz Hart or a Stephen
Sondheim — helps con
siderably, as does the fact that
she is in magnificent voice,
but there is too damn much
bad music for us to pretend

not to notice it.
Furthermore, it's impossible
to watch Yentl without seeing
Streisand's identification with
the title character. Streisand
struggled for years to gel
"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy" on
film, and when she had to turn
writer-producer-director her
self to do so, Hollywood took
a typically jeering attitude to
what it saw as her egotism. Of
course, there's always been a
resistance to Barbra Streisand
among men (and women, too)
who find aggressive female
performers strident and unset
tling.
Yentl's audacious, extrava
gant efforts to win the right to
study Talmud parallel
Streisand's ambitions for her
movie. And though that iden
tification may have led her to
make her worst mistake in the
picture, the only mistake that
violates the spirit of Singer's
story — giving it an upbeat
musical comedy finish lifted
from the "Don't Rain on My
Parade" number in Funny Girl
(which had already been
reprised in Funny Lady) — in
every other way Yentl is a form
of self-expression rather than
self-indulgence.
