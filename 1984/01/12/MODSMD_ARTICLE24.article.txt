# Wonder delivers moving message
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
In a cute handout that the press
received courtesy of the Circle Star
Theater, there was a simple, yet
profound quote from Stevie Wonder,
that night's performer —"To me, the
challenge in performing is to make an
audience aware of everything that's
within me now. People shouldn't ex
pect a set thing from me — I love to
grow."
Well, even though the majority of
the audience at the sold-out opening
night performance (Dec. 14) at the
Circle Star Theater did not have the
opportunity to read this quote, I can
positively assert that the whole audi
ence was thoroughly made aware of all
that lay within Wonder — and no mat
ter how high the expectations held by
the members of the audience were,
Wonder easily went beyond any of
these limited categorizations.
In a stupendous three-hour perfor
mance, I have never seen such a
beautifully moving, emotionally
honest and uplifting show. Above all,
the show's beauty emanated from
Wonder's exuberant and spiritually
powerful "innervisions" which
radiated outward into the audience.
Those three hours were complete
proof that black and white could truly
be one through the power of music.
To start off the night, Wunderlove,
Wonder's talented back-up band
which features the heavy bass riffing of
Nathan Watts and the pleasures of four
sultry female vocalists, opened up with
the funky new number called "It's
Crowing," in the middle of which,
Wonder entered and took the stage.
Then, in a surprising, but ultimately
hysterical move, Wonder went into a
comic monologue whose inspiration
must have come from Wonder's excel
lent appearance on "Saturday Night
Live" with Eddie Murphv.
He joked about the "new" Stevie
Wonder by breaking up the crowd
with humorous renditions of a
country-and-western tune, a blues
tune, and "Jingle Bells." Finally,
though, he got "serious" and moved
into a resplendent set which featured
mostly slow, ballad, piano-based num
bers and, although consisted of lesser
known tunes (as compared with the
night's second set), was still highly

captivating and engaging.
Such highlights as "Superwoman
(Where Were You When I Needed
You?)" from his 1972 album, Music In
My Mind , "Ribbon In The Sky" from
The Original Musiquarium, and a gor
geous new ballad entitled
"Overjoyed" were firm indicators of
Wonder's warmth and love as ex
pressed musically.
Wonder displayed his total com
mand and knowledge of music instru
mentation in a surprise jam with
renowned jazz saxophonist Stan Cetz.
During this impromtu jam (which in
cluded the standard, "The Girl From
Impanema"), Wonder exhibited his
musical finesse by dueling with Cetz's
sax on harmonica, piano, electric
keyboards and synthesizer.
It was a wondrous (no pun intended)
sight; one that, in the hands of a lesser
musician would have been seen as
weak, trite and show-offish. However,
here and throughout the show,
Wonder's musical and technical adept
ness enhanced his attempts to com
municate and translate musical sounds
into musical emotions and visions.
The highlight of the night's first set,
though, was a flashback into the far
past, to the time when Wonder was
the 12-year-old wonderchild. Through
the use of a special electronic
microphone, Wonder could transform
his voice into sounding as it did back
in 1963.
Besides throwing in another comic
monologue at this point, he also did a
short, yet killer version of
"Fingertips," along with "Uptight
(Everything Is All Right)" and "For
Once In My Life."
After an intermission, Wonder came
back with a bouyant vitality and pas
sion by burning through a non-stop ar
ray of hits that encompassed his entire
career. From the early rhythm and
blues of "Signed, Sealed, Delivered
(I'm Yours)" and the aching "My
Cherie Amour" to the latter-day hard
rock/funk powerhouses like "Living
For The City," "Higher Ground" and
"Superstition," the audience was bat
tered with stunning numbers one after
another.
The back-to-back shot of "Sir Duke"
followed by "I Wish" (both off of

Songs In The Key Of Life) completely
knocked the crowd out of their seats
and dynamically transcended any bar
riers between audience and per
former.
The most touching and transcendent
moment of the evening, however, was
when Wonder called up on stage a
group of about 10 young children to
join him in a heartfelt rendition of
"Ebony and Ivory." Previously, I had
thought this song (written by Paul
McCartney and sung with Wonder on
McCartney's 1982 Tug of Wjr) as being
too simple and airy to be ot any value.
Sure, it was a pleasantly cute number
which helped to break through the
black versus white racial barriers of
radio, but basically, I thought that the
song should have been much more
strong and decisive, especially lyrical
ly-
Nevertheless, my view of this song
was drastically altered upon viewing
these youngsters reciting the words of
this song perfectly from their
memories. For these youngsters, who
were of varied races, to be singing,
"Ebony and ivory, live together in per
fect harmony," they were bringing to
life the true message behind the song.
It was touching and honest proof
that the power to achieve this
"harmony" lies within us all. These
children, though simple (as the song
was) and unexposed to the harsh hor
rors and realities of the world, proved
themselves to the wisest and
profoundest of all in their honest sing
ing of this song. It is a credit to
Wonder's musical vision of hope that
he could tap into this source and
spread it into the hearts of the crowd.
For the show's closing sequence,
though, Wonder took this musical
transcendence and funked it up to end
with a long, rollicking "Do I Do," and
moving into "Happy Birthday"
(Wonder's tribute to Martin Luther
King, Jr.). In the process, the whole au
dience finally became the children
who previously sang "Ebony and
Ivory," and joined together to tribute
Wonder and the love, warmth and
compassion he represented. It was a
musical vision come to life — one that
will undoubtedly linger forever in the
hearts and souls of all who saw
Wonder's show.

transcendence and funked it up to end
with a long, rollicking "Do I Do," and
moving into "Happy Birthday"
(Wonder's tribute to Martin Luther
King, Jr.). In the process, the whole au
dience finally became the children
who previously sang "Ebony and
Ivory," and joined together to tribute
Wonder and the love, warmth and
compassion he represented. It was a
musical vision come to life — one that
will undoubtedly linger forever in the
hearts and souls of all who saw
Wonder's show.
In a cute handout that the press
received courtesy of the Circle Star
Theater, there was a simple, yet
profound quote from Stevie Wonder,
that night's performer —"To me, the
challenge in performing is to make an
audience aware of everything that's
within me now. People shouldn't ex
pect a set thing from me — I love to
grow."
Well, even though the majority of
the audience at the sold-out opening
night performance (Dec. 14) at the
Circle Star Theater did not have the
opportunity to read this quote, I can
positively assert that the whole audi
ence was thoroughly made aware of all
that lay within Wonder — and no mat
ter how high the expectations held by
the members of the audience were,
Wonder easily went beyond any of
these limited categorizations.
In a stupendous three-hour perfor
mance, I have never seen such a
beautifully moving, emotionally
honest and uplifting show. Above all,
the show's beauty emanated from
Wonder's exuberant and spiritually
powerful "innervisions" which
radiated outward into the audience.
Those three hours were complete
proof that black and white could truly
be one through the power of music.
To start off the night, Wunderlove,
Wonder's talented back-up band
which features the heavy bass riffing of
Nathan Watts and the pleasures of four
sultry female vocalists, opened up with
the funky new number called "It's
Crowing," in the middle of which,
Wonder entered and took the stage.
Then, in a surprising, but ultimately
hysterical move, Wonder went into a
comic monologue whose inspiration
must have come from Wonder's excel
lent appearance on "Saturday Night
Live" with Eddie Murphv.
He joked about the "new" Stevie
Wonder by breaking up the crowd
with humorous renditions of a
country-and-western tune, a blues
tune, and "Jingle Bells." Finally,
though, he got "serious" and moved
into a resplendent set which featured
mostly slow, ballad, piano-based num
bers and, although consisted of lesser
known tunes (as compared with the
night's second set), was still highly

captivating and engaging.
Such highlights as "Superwoman
(Where Were You When I Needed
You?)" from his 1972 album, Music In
My Mind , "Ribbon In The Sky" from
The Original Musiquarium, and a gor
geous new ballad entitled
"Overjoyed" were firm indicators of
Wonder's warmth and love as ex
pressed musically.
Wonder displayed his total com
mand and knowledge of music instru
mentation in a surprise jam with
renowned jazz saxophonist Stan Cetz.
During this impromtu jam (which in
cluded the standard, "The Girl From
Impanema"), Wonder exhibited his
musical finesse by dueling with Cetz's
sax on harmonica, piano, electric
keyboards and synthesizer.
It was a wondrous (no pun intended)
sight; one that, in the hands of a lesser
musician would have been seen as
weak, trite and show-offish. However,
here and throughout the show,
Wonder's musical and technical adept
ness enhanced his attempts to com
municate and translate musical sounds
into musical emotions and visions.
The highlight of the night's first set,
though, was a flashback into the far
past, to the time when Wonder was
the 12-year-old wonderchild. Through
the use of a special electronic
microphone, Wonder could transform
his voice into sounding as it did back
in 1963.
Besides throwing in another comic
monologue at this point, he also did a
short, yet killer version of
"Fingertips," along with "Uptight
(Everything Is All Right)" and "For
Once In My Life."
After an intermission, Wonder came
back with a bouyant vitality and pas
sion by burning through a non-stop ar
ray of hits that encompassed his entire
career. From the early rhythm and
blues of "Signed, Sealed, Delivered
(I'm Yours)" and the aching "My
Cherie Amour" to the latter-day hard
rock/funk powerhouses like "Living
For The City," "Higher Ground" and
"Superstition," the audience was bat
tered with stunning numbers one after
another.
The back-to-back shot of "Sir Duke"
followed by "I Wish" (both off of

Songs In The Key Of Life) completely
knocked the crowd out of their seats
and dynamically transcended any bar
riers between audience and per
former.
The most touching and transcendent
moment of the evening, however, was
when Wonder called up on stage a
group of about 10 young children to
join him in a heartfelt rendition of
"Ebony and Ivory." Previously, I had
thought this song (written by Paul
McCartney and sung with Wonder on
McCartney's 1982 Tug of Wjr) as being
too simple and airy to be ot any value.
Sure, it was a pleasantly cute number
which helped to break through the
black versus white racial barriers of
radio, but basically, I thought that the
song should have been much more
strong and decisive, especially lyrical
ly-
Nevertheless, my view of this song
was drastically altered upon viewing
these youngsters reciting the words of
this song perfectly from their
memories. For these youngsters, who
were of varied races, to be singing,
"Ebony and ivory, live together in per
fect harmony," they were bringing to
life the true message behind the song.
It was touching and honest proof
that the power to achieve this
"harmony" lies within us all. These
children, though simple (as the song
was) and unexposed to the harsh hor
rors and realities of the world, proved
themselves to the wisest and
profoundest of all in their honest sing
ing of this song. It is a credit to
Wonder's musical vision of hope that
he could tap into this source and
spread it into the hearts of the crowd.
For the show's closing sequence,
though, Wonder took this musical
transcendence and funked it up to end
with a long, rollicking "Do I Do," and
moving into "Happy Birthday"
(Wonder's tribute to Martin Luther
King, Jr.). In the process, the whole au
