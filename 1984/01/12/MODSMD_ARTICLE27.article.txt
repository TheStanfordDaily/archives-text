# Daily elects a dam good man
## 
### 
Clearly, he was Born to Run.
Adam Goodman, a dam good
man, was elected the next editor of
The Daily yesterday — even though
he had to overcome fears about
being too short to do the job.
Goldberg, as Goodman is often
called, may need to purchase some
velour platform shoes to match his
shirts of the same material, but he
certainly was not Running on Empty.
The voters at The Daily decided he's
the man For Everyman. Well, al
most.
Goodman has come along way.
He is the second Daily editor in
recent years to hail from Ohio — but
at least the other Midwesterner was
from some place people had heard
of.
Goldberg made it to Stanford and
attacked the campus with that Ready
or Not attitude. Things were fine
Before the Deluge, but that rush
time drunken spill (while fully
clothed) into Lake Lag showed him

that his favorite saying, "Rock Me
on the Water," doesn't work These
Days.
But life picked up quickly:
Goldberg became a frat geek.
Cream shots and dinnertime ha-has
became standard fare.
Soon, the Gahanna town boy
went too far. He had a sudden pas
sion for donning a red-and-white
pin-striped shirt (quite a change
from the standard baseball T-shirt),
and Fruit-of-the-Looms, grabbing
rolled-up newspaper, and standing
on tables while bellowing out Bob
Seger ballads.
His fellow frat geeks just couldn't
take it. So they sent him out on The
Road to The Daily. Ever since then,
Goodman has believed that all roads
lead to The Daily.
Things were good there in that
bastion of hard work and stellar
journalism, but, for the ambitious
Gahannan, meeting girls (especially
ones with "that sort" of last name)

was no easy task. So he was forced
to turn to Rosie.
just as Kappa Sig members were
about to build a Fountain of Sorrow
in honor of Goldberg, a special wo
man came along. All was well until a
certain night at a certain Japanese
restaurant when that special woman
left Goodman for Joe Plate.
The fighter from Ohio once again
turned back to journalism to save
him from depression and his obses
sion with Linda Paloma.
Once again, he's back on the right
track, and he's Racing in the Streets
— even though he still does neu
rotic things like setting his watch
alarm at 9:42 so he wouldn't forget
to vote for himself.
But The Daily's in good hands:
What other editor has made exten
sivve evacuation plans in the event
of an earthquake?
Welcome to the Chief spot in the
Short Editor's Club, Goldberg.


The winner and Linda Paloma
