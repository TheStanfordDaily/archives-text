Phew!
Well, now that elections are over
and those anxious moments of
waiting for the results are all behind
us, The Daily is ready to get back to
normal again. That means, of course

Hippo Hour
The Chief promises that dozens of
animal crackers featuring, yes, hip
popotami will grace the next Friday
at Five. Be there. Friday. At five.
And . . .
Scores of story assignments await
a little reporter to attend to them.
They feel left out. Please come and
pick them up.
