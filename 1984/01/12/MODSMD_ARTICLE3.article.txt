# Computer error responsible
## 550 students overbilled for housing 
### SAM DELSON Staff writer 
Approximately 550 students were
overtoiled for housing this quarter
because of an error by a University
computer system.
The overcharges ranged from $33
to $77 per student and affected resi
dents of almost all University-billed
housing units. The University has
prepared a list of students who were
overcharged and will send them
credits or refunds within the next
few weeks, according to Rodger
Whitney, assistant dean of students
and director of the housing center.
"Students don't need to do a
thing to get it corrected," said Whit
ney. "The adjustments will be taken
care of automatically."
Those who have already paid their
fees will receive checks, while stu
dents with referrals will be given
credits.
According to Whitney, errors in
housing bills are common, but this
quarter more students than usual
were affected. "In a normal quarter,
up to 250 students would need ad
justments in their bills," he said.
The unusually large number of
overcharges this term was caused by
an error in the University's experi
ment with a new student database
called Network of Student Informa
tion (NSI).
Information about winter housing
rates was recorded on the old sys
tem, but was not transferred to the
new computer network, according
to Whitney.
As a result, many students were
mistakenly billed at autumn housing
rates on their winter PTRs.
"The Office of Residential Educa
tion sent the correct rates to the
registrar," he said, "but the inter

face between the two systems was
not made.
"Residential Education had noth
ing to do with the problem," he
added.
The old system was used during
advance registration, but the new
system was tested during the regular
registration session this week. Be
cause of the experiment, almost all
students in University-billed
housing who registered on Monday
were overcharged.
The only housing units not af
fected by the overcharges are those
occupied by law students. Because
the Law School uses a semester
calendar, its students are charged
different housing rates than the rest
of the university.
As a result, data for buildings with
law students are recorded by hand
rather than automatically calculated
by the computer system. According
to Whitney, the only buildings not
affected by the billing error are
Crothers, Crothers Memorial, Man
zanita Park, Escondido Village and
Synergy.
The problem came to light on
Monday when several residents of
353 Campus Drive House com
plained that they were charged the
$715 autumn quarter housing fee in
stead of $654, the rate for the winter
quarter.
Although he first learned of the
overcharges from student com
plaints, Whitney said the University
would have discovered the mistakes
even if no students had objected.
"We verify every student's bill twice
every quarter," he said.
"There's no reason for anybody to
worry," he added. "It will all be
straightened out."
