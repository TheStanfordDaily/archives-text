# Cowell adds appointment system, plans more improvements

### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
Cowell Student Health Center has in
stituted a new appointment system and is
considering adding a women's clinic and a
pharmacy, according to its director.
Paul Walters, director of Cowell, said the
new appointment system took effect on
Tuesday. Potential improvements at Cowell
include the addition of a women's clinic, a
pharmacy and dental care, as well as im
proved health insurance.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons

recently informed the Undergraduate
Cabinet of Cowell's plans.
Walters said students requiring regular
care now must get appointments in ad
vance, although those who need urgent
care will still be able to walk in and receive
immediate attention.
The appointment system provides
"continuity of care," the director said, by
allowing students to know when, by whom
and at what time they will be seen. The pri
mary benefit is a reduction in waiting time.
Cowell now stays open during lunchtime

on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays to
facilitate the appointment process.
Walters said the new scheduling system
designates more student choice in medical
care because each student will be able to
pick his or her own physician.
Cowell also hopes to improve its service
to students by creating a women's clinic.
Lyons described the clinic as a response to
the "cluster of medical and psychological
concerns that are special to women. There
is a need for differential treatment."
The pharmacy, which would allow stu

dents to obtain prescription drugs at the
lowest possible cost and at a convenient lo
cation, will not be built in the near future,
according to Walters. Current considera
tions for the pharmacy's location include
Cowell or Tresidder Union.
Walters said that currently the pharmacy
appears near to being cost-effective. The
current rate of 1.5 prescriptions per student
per year would barely provide the phar
macy with enough funds to operate.
Both Lyons and Walters expressed the
need for more health insurance options.

Currently under study by the University's
health service, an increased number of op
tions would perhaps encourage more stu
dents to apply for coverage.
Lyons said graduate students "have a
more direct concern (than undergraduates)
with health insurance, but also don't have
much money." He said that now students
are playing a game of "insurance roulette"
in which they pay for coverage one year and
then terminate the insurance the next year.
Yet, as Lyons pointed out, a major
illness could occur in an off year.
A student health survey con
ducted last spring indicated that
there is student interest in a dental
hygiene program.
"It is hard to get a student to
select his own physician, let alone a

dentist," Walters said.
While students may wait until they
return home for dental care rather
than seeking a dentist in the area
surrounding Stanford, they may be
more receptive to receiving dental
care at the University.
Lyons said that it is still uncertain
how much need exists at Stanford
for a program of dental hygiene.
Also to be resolved are the problem
of space and the task of obtaining
the cooperation of local dentists.
