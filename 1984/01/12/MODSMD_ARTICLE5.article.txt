# Recruiters flock to campus searching for new workers

Recruiters have scheduled almost twice the number
of interviews winter quarter at the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) than during the same period
last year, according to CPPC director Christopher
Shinkman.
Of the 6669 interviews to take place this winter, up
from last year's 3688, the majority of recruiters repre
sent technical firms involved in manufacturing,
electronics and aerospace developments, Shinkman
said.
Recruiters from large firms outnumber those from
the small and mid-size firms, as well as public and non
profit organizations, he said.
Employers who visit the University tend to be from
large national and multinational firhns often listed in
Fortune magazine's "Fortune 500," a list of the 500 larg
est publically held companies, he said.
Shinkman noted that IBM has 18 interviews sched
uled over a two-day span in March.
"We'd like to see more organizations looking for

non-technical people — those with humanities and sci
ence degrees," Shinkman said, adding that such jobs
would include those in banking, insurance and sales.
Shinkman said the increase of nearly 3000 visits
should not be viewed as a direct indication of an up
swing in the nation's economy.
"The organizations which recruit at Stanford and all
college campuses are not representative of the entire
economic picture," Shinkman said. One of the main
reasons for the increase in visits, according to
Shinkman, is that recruiters "like to come to Stanford
because there are good students here, good potential
employees."
Another factor, Shinkman said, is that more students
are using the CPPC this year — a fact which he attri
butes in part to the CPPC's effort to contact students in
dorms to make them aware of the center's services.
Shinkman said that in spring quarter there should
also be an increase in visits from recruiters over the
same period last year, although it might be down from
the high of this winter.
"The winter quarter is always the
biggest," he said, noting that
employers who interview then have
the opportunity to conduct follow
up meetings with applicants in the
spring and possibly have them
employed by midsummer or Sep
tember.
