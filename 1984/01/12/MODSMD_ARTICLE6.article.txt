Kissinger report released
Washington — The Kissinger Commission told
President Reagan yesterday that a conflagration in
Central America "could threaten the entire hemi
sphere" and called for boosting military aid to El Sal
vador as well as a five-year, $8 billion economic as
sistance program for the entire region.
The commission warned that the Marxist insur
gency in El Salvador "threatens U.S. security inter
ests because of its ties to Nicaragua, Cuba and the
Soviet Union."
In what has already become the most disputed
section of its work, the commission said, however,
that military aid to El Salvador should be contingent
upon demonstrated progress in security human

rights, in such areas as elections, freedom of assem
bly, rule of law and an end to the "death squads."
Larry Speakes, White House spokesman, has said
the president would not be inclined to accept such a
legislative requirement. Late last year, Reagan
vetoed a bill on that score.
The panel presented its report to the president at
midday, ending a six-month project intended to
outline for the administration and the nation the
problems of its southern neighbors and the effort
needed to end the turmoil responsible for tens of
thousands of deaths in recent years.
"It is the most comprehensive and detailed review
of the issues as they affect our national security that I
have ever seen," Reagan said in the Oval Office as
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, chairman
of the National Bipartisan Commission on Central
America, delivered the 132-page document.
"I'm impressed with the depth of the analysis and
the creativity of the recommendations," Reagan
said, and called for Congress to work with him in a
bipartisan manner to "urgently seek solutions."
Detailed comment was not expected for several days
until after he has read the report.
Speakes said Reagan agreed with the recommen
dation that aid to El Salvador be increased.
The 12-member commission spent more than 30
days in meetings, heard from more than 500 people
in the United States, Central America, Mexico and
Venezuela, and received written material from an
other 400 people. It called for a coordinated effort to
attack the nation's social, economic, political and
security troubles, and said that anything less would
fail. But Kissinger said he saw no need to increase
the number of U.S. military advisers in the region.
"The crisis will not wait," the commissioners said.
"There is no time to wait."
"Unless rapid progress can be made on the politi
cal, economic and social fronts, peace on the mili
tary front will be elusive and would be fragile," the
report said. But, it added, failure to curb the vio
lence and foreign-supported insurgencies will
hamper progress in the other areas.
U.S. Army pilot killed
Washington—A U.S. Army pilot taking part in mil
itary exercises in Honduras was shot and killed yes
terday near the Nicaraguan border after his OH-58
scout helicopter was forced to land, Pentagon offi
cials said.
The pilot, a warrant officer whose name was not
released, was the first U.S. serviceman to die under
hostile fire since the joint U.S.-Honduran military
exercises known as Big Pine II began in August. Two
other soldiers have died in truck and bulldozer acci
dents during the exercises, which are intended to
put pressure on the leftist government in Nicaragua.
The helicopter pilot was killed by "person or per
sons unknown" shooting "from the direction" of
the Nicaraguan border, according to Pentagon
spokesman Col. Robert O'Brien. The helicopter was
flying over what has been the principal war zone in
battles between the Nicaraguan army and Un
supported rebels fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista
government.
Pentagon sources said preliminary reports indi
cated that the small chopper was forced to land after
taking at least six rounds of fire, including one to its
engine. They said the helicopter was flying in "heavy
winds" close to the Nicaraguan border, and the
question of whether the craft had strayed into
Nicaraguan airspace was being investigated.
Two passengers on the helicopter, U.S. Army en
gineers traveling between military construction proj
ects in Honduras, were airlifted from the scene by
Honduran forces. The two were treated for minor
cuts and bruises at a U.S. Army hospital at Palmerola
Air Base near Comayagua, Honduras, and released.

Court rules against nuclear industry
Washington — The Supreme Court, handing an
other serious legal setback to the nuclear industry,
voted five to four yesterday to reinstate the $10 mil
lion punitive damages judgment that a jury had re
quired Kerr-McGee Corp. to pay to the estate of its
deceased laboratory worker Karen Silkwood.
An appeals court had thrown out the judgment on
grounds that allowing juries to impose such damage
awards on nuclear plants would intrude on the
federal government's authority to regulate nuclear
safety. But the Supreme Court decided that nothing
in the 1954 Atomic Energy Act or any other federal
law barred individuals from filing ordinary
negligence suits and seeking punitive damages
against nuclear plants.
The decision, written by justice Byron White,
clears the way for a person damaged by radiation, as
Silkwood was, to seek large sums of money from nu
clear operators. Dissenters said the ruling "could
discourage investment needed to further the ac
knowledged national need for this alternative
source of energy.''
Silkwood was a laboratory analyst at Kerr-McGee's
nuclear plant near Crescent, Okla. She was also ac
tive in the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union
and had been discussing with union officials what
she considered to be inadequate safety practices at
Kerr-McGee.
On Nov. 5 through Nov. 7, 1974, Silkwood was
found to be contaminated by high levels of
plutonium, and a Kerr-McGee decontamination
squad also found high levels of contamination in her
apartment. The explanations for the contaminations
were never established.
Six days later, on Nov. 13, Silkwood, 28, died in a
car accident outside Oklahoma City.
She was driving to a meeting with a New York
Times reporter and a union official to give them
what she suggested were documents showing
health and safety violations at the plant. The docu
ments were never found. Police concluded that the
accident was a one-car crash and rejected the sug
gestions of union officials that her car might have
been forced off the road.
Stocks continue to plummet
New York—Stock prices declined for the third
straight session yesterday after the market's efforts
to challenge last fall's record highs once again
misfired.
Analysts said a sluggish showing by the credit
markets left stock traders uninspired.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
8.16 points in the first two sessions this week,
dropped another 1.16 to 1277.32.
Today's weather
Sunny today except for patchy morning valley fog.
Highs in the 50s. Northwest winds to 15 mph.
Tonight and tomorrow fair except for patchy

other serious legal setback to the nuclear industry,
voted five to four yesterday to reinstate the $10 mil
lion punitive damages judgment that a jury had re
quired Kerr-McGee Corp. to pay to the estate of its
deceased laboratory worker Karen Silkwood.
An appeals court had thrown out the judgment on
grounds that allowing juries to impose such damage
awards on nuclear plants would intrude on the
federal government's authority to regulate nuclear
safety. But the Supreme Court decided that nothing
in the 1954 Atomic Energy Act or any other federal
law barred individuals from filing ordinary
negligence suits and seeking punitive damages
against nuclear plants.
The decision, written by justice Byron White,
clears the way for a person damaged by radiation, as
Silkwood was, to seek large sums of money from nu
clear operators. Dissenters said the ruling "could
discourage investment needed to further the ac
knowledged national need for this alternative
source of energy.''
Silkwood was a laboratory analyst at Kerr-McGee's
nuclear plant near Crescent, Okla. She was also ac
tive in the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union
and had been discussing with union officials what
she considered to be inadequate safety practices at
Kerr-McGee.
On Nov. 5 through Nov. 7, 1974, Silkwood was
found to be contaminated by high levels of
plutonium, and a Kerr-McGee decontamination
squad also found high levels of contamination in her
apartment. The explanations for the contaminations
were never established.
Six days later, on Nov. 13, Silkwood, 28, died in a
car accident outside Oklahoma City.
She was driving to a meeting with a New York
Times reporter and a union official to give them
what she suggested were documents showing
health and safety violations at the plant. The docu
ments were never found. Police concluded that the
accident was a one-car crash and rejected the sug
gestions of union officials that her car might have
been forced off the road.
Stocks continue to plummet
New York—Stock prices declined for the third
straight session yesterday after the market's efforts
to challenge last fall's record highs once again
misfired.
Analysts said a sluggish showing by the credit
markets left stock traders uninspired.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
8.16 points in the first two sessions this week,
dropped another 1.16 to 1277.32.
Today's weather
Sunny today except for patchy morning valley fog.

Kissinger report released
Washington — The Kissinger Commission told
President Reagan yesterday that a conflagration in
Central America "could threaten the entire hemi
sphere" and called for boosting military aid to El Sal
vador as well as a five-year, $8 billion economic as
sistance program for the entire region.
The commission warned that the Marxist insur
gency in El Salvador "threatens U.S. security inter
ests because of its ties to Nicaragua, Cuba and the
Soviet Union."
In what has already become the most disputed
section of its work, the commission said, however,
that military aid to El Salvador should be contingent
upon demonstrated progress in security human

rights, in such areas as elections, freedom of assem
bly, rule of law and an end to the "death squads."
Larry Speakes, White House spokesman, has said
the president would not be inclined to accept such a
legislative requirement. Late last year, Reagan
vetoed a bill on that score.
The panel presented its report to the president at
midday, ending a six-month project intended to
outline for the administration and the nation the
problems of its southern neighbors and the effort
needed to end the turmoil responsible for tens of
thousands of deaths in recent years.
"It is the most comprehensive and detailed review
of the issues as they affect our national security that I
have ever seen," Reagan said in the Oval Office as
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, chairman
of the National Bipartisan Commission on Central
America, delivered the 132-page document.
"I'm impressed with the depth of the analysis and
the creativity of the recommendations," Reagan
said, and called for Congress to work with him in a
bipartisan manner to "urgently seek solutions."
Detailed comment was not expected for several days
until after he has read the report.
Speakes said Reagan agreed with the recommen
dation that aid to El Salvador be increased.
The 12-member commission spent more than 30
days in meetings, heard from more than 500 people
in the United States, Central America, Mexico and
Venezuela, and received written material from an
other 400 people. It called for a coordinated effort to
attack the nation's social, economic, political and
security troubles, and said that anything less would
fail. But Kissinger said he saw no need to increase
the number of U.S. military advisers in the region.
"The crisis will not wait," the commissioners said.
"There is no time to wait."
"Unless rapid progress can be made on the politi
cal, economic and social fronts, peace on the mili
tary front will be elusive and would be fragile," the
report said. But, it added, failure to curb the vio
lence and foreign-supported insurgencies will
hamper progress in the other areas.
U.S. Army pilot killed
Washington—A U.S. Army pilot taking part in mil
itary exercises in Honduras was shot and killed yes
terday near the Nicaraguan border after his OH-58
scout helicopter was forced to land, Pentagon offi
cials said.
The pilot, a warrant officer whose name was not
released, was the first U.S. serviceman to die under
hostile fire since the joint U.S.-Honduran military
exercises known as Big Pine II began in August. Two
other soldiers have died in truck and bulldozer acci
dents during the exercises, which are intended to
put pressure on the leftist government in Nicaragua.
The helicopter pilot was killed by "person or per
sons unknown" shooting "from the direction" of
the Nicaraguan border, according to Pentagon
spokesman Col. Robert O'Brien. The helicopter was
flying over what has been the principal war zone in
battles between the Nicaraguan army and Un
supported rebels fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista
government.
Pentagon sources said preliminary reports indi
cated that the small chopper was forced to land after
taking at least six rounds of fire, including one to its
engine. They said the helicopter was flying in "heavy
winds" close to the Nicaraguan border, and the
question of whether the craft had strayed into
Nicaraguan airspace was being investigated.
Two passengers on the helicopter, U.S. Army en
gineers traveling between military construction proj
ects in Honduras, were airlifted from the scene by
Honduran forces. The two were treated for minor
cuts and bruises at a U.S. Army hospital at Palmerola
Air Base near Comayagua, Honduras, and released.
