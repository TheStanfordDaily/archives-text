The successful drive to raise at
least $500,000 to help renovate Stan
ford's historic Red Barn can only be
described as "thrilling," said L.W.
Lane, Jr., director of the volunteer
effort and publisher of Sunset maga
zine.
Volunteers who began the fund
raising effort last fall have surpassed
their original goal by almost $40,000,
raising more than $535,000 within six
weeks.

The work is now in full swing to
restore one of the oldest buildings
on campus and last remaining
landmarks from Leland Stanford's
Palo Alto Stock Farm. The renova
tion is expected to be completed in
early March, with University classes
being offered at the Red Barn next
fall.
The Red Barn, built between 1878
and 1880, is located on the Stanford
Golf Course. When the University
was opened in 1885 on stock farm
land, the barn was used as the trot

ting department's training stable.
Calling the barn a "tremendous
asset for Stanford and a wonderful
historic tradition," Lane praised the
people involved in the fund-raising
effort for their interest in the proj
ect.
The funds raised by Lane and his
staff will help pay for more than half
of the renovation cost, which was
originally estimated at $950,000. The
rest of the restoration effort will be

covered by the University and Red
Barn tenant Sara Saxe.
Saxe, a stockbroker and certified
financial planner, plans to lease the
barn and surrounding area to oper

ate a riding school and boarding
facility. Saxe is also offering $5000
units in Equestrian Associates Ltd., a
limited partnership that she began.
The funds raised in excess of
$500,000 will be used to improve the
overall setting of the barn using a
design called the "Master Plan."
"With the Master Plan, we hope
to make the most efficient use of the
surrounding 13 acres since the barn

is symbolic of Stanford," Lane said.
Lane added that he would raise
any additional money to cover the
cost of the plan which includes a
visitor information center.
According to Saxe, plans to pour
the cement foundation and frame
the interior have been completed.
Presently the roof is being
renovated.
