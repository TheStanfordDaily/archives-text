## Bug Me 
### 
In the spirit of the new quar
ter and year, I've sifted
through the backlog of mail
and pulled out all of the ques
tions which have been sitting
there for weeks or months but
have missed my attention, for
one reason or another, up to
this frenzy of New Year activ
ity.
Why is the Stanford map
"upside-down?"
Here at Stanford, style has

substance. If you don't
believe me, get a map and
hold it "right-side-up." Would
you want to matriculate there?
I have this class in Cubberley
in the room that used to have
the public policy class. Is there a
public phone around there
somewhere?
If you go out the left door,
then down that long corridor,
then make a right, past the
drinking fountain and go up
the stairs, (the big stairs, not
the little ones that you have to
go through a door to get to),
there should be a working pay
phone right there at the end of
the hall.
I'm curious about the num
bering system in the Quad. It
seems like it might have started
out as a good idea by somebody
— sort of a nod to the decimal
— making it easy to find build
ings by giving them numbers
rather than naming them things
like "McCullough Building" or
the "SRE Center." However, the
person given the job of number
ing the buildings was obviously

not too stable. Why does the
numbering go out in a spiral
from the left inside of the Oval,
peaking at the outside to the
right? This puts buildings 30 and
250 next to each other, makes
buildings 170 and 10 forgotten
twins on the inner corridor, and
thoroughly confuses everyone:
Visitors break down and cry and
students refuse to take any
Quad class in a building other
than the History Corner. The
numbering doesn't even have
any internal logic — it starts
from building 1, then 10, and
then 20, following increments
of ten until it gets to 120, where
it leaps in 40-point increments,
then to ten between buildings
240 and 250, 310 and 320, and
360 to 380. Why has such a
good idea degenerated into such
a confusing welter of totally
meaningless numbers, and what
crazed numerologist is respon
sible for this absurdity?
Oh, don't be such a baby!
Why are there pre-meds?
I think you mean "How?"
What do the big white letters
"C.0.P.-NESS DICK'S IN
PLACE" in White Plaza mean?
I know it's some reference
to Dick Butterfield, a member
of the Council of Presidents in
1980-81, and I think it has
something to do with sex, but
I'm not going to delve into it.
Why is there random under
wear lying around random
places on campus? (jockey
shorts in White Plaza, bras by
Braun Auditorium, etc.) Whose
is it? And more importantly,
what happens to it? It lies there
a few days and then disappears.
Thanks for the quick eyes
and thoughtful questions. Un
fortunately, there were no
identifying marks or labels on
the items, so we're left pretty
much in the dark on this one.
If anyone has information
about all this, forward it to
"Bug Me" care of the The Dai
ly. And please send photos
only, no undergarments.
