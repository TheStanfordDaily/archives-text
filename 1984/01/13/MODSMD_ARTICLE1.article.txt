# Poll says Stanford frosh physically fit, racially diverse
## 
### BAIE NETZER 
This year's incoming freshmen
are more racially diverse, more
dependent on financial aid and
more physically fit than the fresh
men who attend other highly
selective private universities, ac
cording to the results of a survey
conducted jointly by the Ameri
can Council on Education and
UCLA.
The survey results also seem to
support some claims that the
highly publicized "gender gap"
exists here.
While almost all of the men
and women freshmen planned to
obtain degrees beyond their bac
calaureate — 94 percent of the
entering class said they expected
to study for advanced degrees —
the survey showed freshman wo
men to be more liberal, on the
average, than their male counter
parts.
Some 38.2 percent of the fresh
man women described them
selves as liberal compared to 28.3
percent of the men.
The percentage of minorities
among this year's entering fresh
men was consistently higher than
at other selective colleges nation
ally.
At Stanford, the survey re
ported the greatest rise in the
black population, which jumped
to 8.4 percent of this year's fresh
men compared to 3.9 percent in
1973.
The percentage of Chicanos
admitted to Stanford showed the
second biggest rise from the 1973
figure of 3.9 percent to 8.1 per
cent for 1983.

While the highest percentage
of freshmen reported their par
ents' annual income to be be
tween $50,000 and $99,000, al
most half of the entering class —
some 48 percent — said they
would have attended a less ex
pensive college if they had not
been offered any financial aid.
At selective private universities
nationally, a somewhat lower
average of 41.7 percent claimed
they would have gone to a less
expensive college had they not
received financial aid.
In addition, the survey re
ported that freshmen at Stanford
participated in healthier physical
activities.
Seventy-four percent of the
freshmen at Stanford reported
frequent vigorous workouts,
compared with a national average
of 63 percent.
The percentage of students
who said they drank beer occa
sionally or frequently during the
past year was 10 percent below
the national average while the
percentage of those students
who reportedly used tran
quilizers or sleeping pills was
about half the level reported
elsewhere.
Though Stanford students in
previous years indicated a higher
interest in medicine, 1983
marked a new rise in the interest
expressed for engineering and a
decline in the interest expressed
for medicine than was the case in
1973. When asked about their
field of study, the proportion of
freshmen mentioning social sci
ence also rose from 13 percent in
1973 to 15 percent in 1983.
