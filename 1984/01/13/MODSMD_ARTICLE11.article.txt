## The 						Stanford Daily Aid to Central America 
### 
The presidential commission on Central
America presented its report yesterday calling
for large increases in military and economic aid
to the region. The group also explained U.S.
interests in the region by saying that Soviet-
Cuban involvement makes the area important
for U.S. strategic concerns.
The commission has made a good start at de
veloping a national consensus on Central
American policy. The wide-range of committee
members who signed the report agreed on the
rationale for American involvement in the
region and long-term goals. We agree that the
area is important to the United States for strate
gic and humanitarian reasons.
But the commission's recommendations for
U.S. policy present a mixed bag of proposals.
We support the group's call for large increases
in economic aid, although the suggested $8 bil
lion economic aid program may be excessive.
The recommendations include a range of new
initiatives such as a Literacy Corps, 10,000
scholarships for higher education and govern
ment loans to start up a private development
corporation.
We also support the commission's recom
mendations for continued American military
aid to help the current governments maintain
order and resist rebel attacks. But it is essential
that this aid be tied to progress in human rights
and efforts to seek negotiated settlements.

After long hours of debate, the group agreed
that U.S. aid to the region be contingent on
demonstrated progress in human rights, the
ending of death squads and movement toward
free elections. We hope this recommenda
tion will exert enough political force on the
president to make him accept the condition of
periodic, legislatively-mandated reports which
he vetoed in a bill last year.
But the commission showed a regrettable re
luctance to seek negotiated solutions in the
region. Rubber-stamping the president's cur
rent policies, the commission rejected "power
sharing" negotiations with leftist guerillas in El
Salvador, indirectly endorsed American aid for
Nicaraguan rebels and insisted on elections
and other moves toward democracy in
Nicaragua. These are recommendations that
Congress simply will not accept.
In El Salvador, the administration should try
to bring all the parties to the bargaining table
so they can work together in a democratic gov
ernment. In Nicaragua, our government
should increase its diplomatic efforts in
response to that country's recent attempts to
improve human rights. Most importantly,
Reagan must respect the sovereignty of the
popularly supported Nicaraguan government.
If the United States is to win friends and
promote stability in the region, it must show
strong efforts at good will.
