## The 						wind chill factor is -80 
### 
I went home to Minnesota for
Christmas. I was looking forward to
this break, to seeing my family and
going cross-country skiing. The
skiing is better there than in the
Sierras — the snow is colder and
firmer, it's easier to wax your skis
and you can go faster. You don't
have to go 300 miles to get to it,
either — it's just out your back
door. Sure, it's below freezing, but
when you ski you get warm.
It was minus 9 when I got out of
the plane that night. That's pretty
cold, but I wasn't too discouraged.
It would warm up the next day.
It didn't. Two days later we had a
daytime high of minus 14 and a low
of minus 29. That's cold. Cars won't
start unless they've been heated —
the battery loses power. Most cars
will turn over once, slowly. My bro
thers just moaned.
You notice a curious phenome
non beginning at about minus 10
when there's no wind. The water
from the exhaust of the cars that are
running settles to the road and

freezes. You're driving on ice. It
gets worse as it gets colder. It got
colder. You'd see a car in the ditch
every few miles on the freeway.
Other cars were stalled at stop
signs. Stopped, stalled and couldn't
get going again. You drove around
them.
Then the wind started. Living in
Minnesota you learn about wind
and cold early. The wind blows your
bodily warmth away. We can mea
sure it precisely. We call it the Wind
Chill Factor. When the wind chill is
minus 40, exposed skin loses heat as
fast as if the temperature were really
minus 40.
The night before Christmas Eve I
drove a friend to the bus station,.
The temperature was minus 30. The
wind chill was minus 80. I stayed in
the car. He was headed north. Fool.
My girlfriend informed me that
they were having a cold spell in
Hawaii, too. It was down to 55 that
day. I could have gone to Hawaii
with her. Same price. FOOL. No, I
hadn't yet gone skiing. I was readv

to use the skis for firewood, and if I
saw any more of my family I was
going to scream.
You learn to cope. You begin to
get acclimatized. You find things to
do indoors. I read a lot. Every maga
zine had pictures of beautiful
Hawaiian waterfalls and beaches,
thoughtfully put there for my bene
fit by the Hawaiian Tourist Bureau.
Some things are hard to cope with.
It eventually got better. It warmed
up, the wind stopped. The next day
it was as bad as ever. I started calling
airlines about flights to Hawaii. They
were booked solid. Bev told me that
it was 100 degrees warmer there.
It finally warmed up for good. I
went skiing. When it got up to 25 I
skied in a T-shirt. You really don't
mind the cold when you're skiing.
Minnesota's not so bad. Montana
was colder. Minnesota's got a lot
going for it. Maybe I'll go back next
Christmas.
Maybe.
