# Grad-Anon: Solving the graduate crisis
## 
### 
I'm a graduate student.
You see? That was really quite easy, wasn't it?
I'm a graduate student.
And the second time it's even easier. Of
course it's tough getting your tongue around
the hard "g" and the rough "r," but after that it
flows out smoothly as melted butter.
And the third and fourth time it's simpler still.
You'll soon find yourself confessing to your
grad-ness without the slightest twinge of shame
or embarrassment. Well, hardly any.
Maybe some of you think you've never actual
ly seen a grad student, close up, I mean. Of
course you've glimpsed us distantly, nerding in
the labs, or gathering in forlorn clumps at the
back of the Coffeehouse, keeping ourselves to
ourselves. Well, you're in for a shock.
As many as one in four Stanford students is a
graduate!
The seeming Valley girl guzzling fro-yo at the
Corner Pocket, the alleged preppie snoring next
to you at Meyer — any one of them could be a
secret grad!
Now, I'm not one of those radical extremists
who demand grads should be treated as if they

were normal human beings. A little sympathy,
that's all we ask for.
Me, I think the present Stanford policy of
"separate but equal" is all we can reasonably
expect. Like for instance the way Res Ed
quarantines us in blocks on the edge of
campus; or in Manzanita Park when it's thought
no longer fit for human habitation.
Sometimes the petty restrictions seem
irksome. It's not easy to understand why the
typewriters in Meyer can only be used by under
grads. But on second thought, I do sympathize.
Many of you would no doubt shudder with dis
gust at the thought of the communal typewriter
having been touched by graduate fingers.
Now, I've got together with a group of my fel
low sufferers. We call ourselves Grad-Anon. We
meet on Wednesday nights at a secret location
in the sewage tunnels beneath campus. We in
troduce ourselves by saying, "My name is jona
than Treitel and I'm a graduate"; then we rap
about our problems; it's better than nothing, I
guess.
We try and convince ourselves that grad-ness
is really a kind of "disease": it's curable, it

needn't last forever.
So then, what's to be done about the Grad
Crisis? And it is a crisis: Did you know that the
number of grads in the United States has been
increasing steadily since World War II? This
epidemic is raging out of control!
Of course there are some wishy-washy
liberals who talk of glibly of "integrating" grads
among normal people. And indeed at Stanford
they've even allowed a few token grads to live at
the co-ops.
But, honestly, can this really work? I mean,
how would you feel if there was one living next
to you? And anyway, it's not as if we expect to
be treated as "equals."
All we ask for is a little sympathy.
So next time you catch sight of a grad, whe
ther gibbering behind the windows of Cro
Mem, or kicking the card index at Green —
smile at him kindly, and toss him a peanut.
And remember this: In a few years time, who
knows, you too could be a grad.
