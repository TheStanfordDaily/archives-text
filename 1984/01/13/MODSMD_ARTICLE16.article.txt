## Farewell, Dean of Expulsions 
### 
Willard Krebs, Dean of Expulsions
at Stanford, a little known but much
hated man, has decided to leave
Stanford to take the job of Director
of Refuse Collection at Harvard Uni
versity. Though Dean Willard has
tried to keep a low profile and has
an unlisted phone number, he has
received innumerable death threats
from Stanford students during his 15
years here, especially during the

past two years. He claims that this is
one of the main reasons he has
decided to leave Stanford to head a
team of twelve Sanitation Engineers
at Harvard.
Dean Willard is most easily char
acterized by his oft-repeated remark
that Stanford students are "not so
great," and by the license plates on
his car which read "EXPELS." In an
interview last week he told The Dai

ly, "Those who say I'm leaving Stan
ford because I'm tired of my work
here are dead right. I'd rather be a
glorified janitor at a real school like
Harvard than work at this place
anymore. I've been waiting 14 years
for an opportunity like this to come
along. Before I got this offer from
Harvard, I was seriously considering
suicide ... or mass murder."
When asked how often a student
is expelled from Stanford, Krebs
said, "The so-called Honor Code
here is such a joke that I haven't
been able to give anyone the boot
for the past eight years, and that was
for public sodomy. The usual treat
ment for cheaters is a light slap on
the wrist and the exhortation, 'Don't
you EVER do that again!' On the
other hand, I don't think we should
look too much at any one factor
when deciding whether to expel a
student. Sure, maybe a guy cheated
in all of his classes, but he didn't
murder anyone, or offend the gov
ernment of the People's Republic of
China."
Krebs is slow to say what sort of
advice he will offer his successor.
"Oh, God ... I don't know. If you
can get a better job, take it. A lot of
people just don't realize how many
not-so-great people there are at
Stanford. You could go nuts trying
to throw them all out."
