## Ticket shortage plagues Viennese ball 
### 
The Viennese Ball Committee is
proud to announce that tickets for
the Seventh Annual Viennese Ball
will go on sale in White Plaza at
noon this Saturday. The Ball will be
held in the Roble Athletic Complex,
and we anticipate that the approxi
mately 450 tickets for sale will go
very fast.
We also anticipate that many,
many people will not be able to buy
tickets. We want to let you know, in
advance, why there are so few tick
ets, and how we are trying to dis
tribute those we can offer as fairly as
possible.
Because Roble is an old building,
without fire alarms or sprinklers,
there is a strict limit to the number
of people permitted in the building
at one time. In addition, the Roble
Dance Studio can only accommo
date a certain number of waltzers.
These constraints mean we have
fewer tickets to offer than we would
like.
Because tickets to the Ball proper
are so limited, we have made great
efforts to present an extensive
Austria Week, a series of Austrian
cultural events, in the week preced
ing the Ball. It includes singers, folk
dancers, a Kaffeehaus, a Viennese
wine tavern (Heurigen), a showing
of The Sound of Music and a num
ber of Austrian speakers.
Austria Week and strict tickets
policies can only alleviate the
shortage of tickets, not solve it.
Many have offered solutions—most
commonly, that we have the Ball on
two consecutive nights. Both last
year and this, we considered that —
and rejected it. Roble is a very
heavily used facility, and to try to set
up on any day but Saturday would
disrupt several classes. We also con
sidered moving to Maples Pavilion,
but the Athletic Department feared
damage to the special basketball
floor, and conflicts with several Var
sity schedules. There is no other
large, hard-floored, indoor space on
campus. (Elliot Program Center is
not large enough.)
We also looked into the possibili
ty of having the Ball in a hotel ball

room — for instance, at the Hyatt
Palo Alto. While we could accom
modate more people this way, ticket
prices would be forced up to at least
$20, we would not be able to serve
any wine and many who can now
walk to the Ball would be forced to
drive.
There is simply a lack of suitable
space on campus for this type of
event. Roble cannot accommodate
all the requests it receives for non
departmental use of its facilities.
There are two possible solutions.
First, a new facility could be built
which contained a large ballroom.
(It would be fitting to incorporate
such a ballroom into the Reagan
complex, should it come to Stan
ford.) Second, and more practical,
an existing facility could be con
verted. For the Opera Ball, the most
prestigious and lavish of the balls in
Vienna, the stage of the Opera
House is extended over the seats to
provide a vast dance floor. If the
same technique could be applied to
Memorial Auditorium, it could pro
vide a facility for numerous Univer
sity events, while doubling or tri
pling the number of tickets available
for the Viennese Ball.
Until something like this happens,
there is little the Viennese Ball Com
mittee can do to make to make more
tickets available. But there is ab
solutely nothing to stop other
groups from organizing their own
balls. The Camelot Ball, in the Quad
last spring, and the Savannah Ball, in
the Program Center last winter, are
examples of what is possible. The
only good, long-term solution to the
Viennese Ball ticket crunch is to
have many organizations sponsor
ing many balls. Until then, the Vien
nese Ball Committee will continue
its work of the past six years— to
present a taste of the Viennese
Fasching and Austrian culture to the
entire Stanford community.
