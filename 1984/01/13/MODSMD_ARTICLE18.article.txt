# Circle K: students doing anything they can do

### KAREN BOLLERMANN 
Stanford's Circle K Club, a
student service organization
sponsored by the Kiwanis
Club, came close to becoming
a non-entity last year.
Few students here knew the
club existed, and membership
declined drastically last year.
To add to its problems, "The

former president became dis
illusioned and dropped out of
sight," according to Club
President Jim Rutter.
The club was saved by a
recruitment drive planned last
spring by Rutter and Ralph
White, the club's sponsor.

White, who is a member of the
parent organization, the
Kiwanis Club, spoke with Rut
ter about reorganizing the
club this fall. "We got a table
at registration and it was like a
snowball rolling downhill —
we got a few people, who then
got others," said White.
They are still in the organi-

zational process. A group of 15
members elected officers in
the second week of fall quar
ter. The club now has a core
membership of 25 with an ad
ditional 100 who have ex
pressed an interest in Circle K.
White describes the group as

"very motivated and compati
ble."
Despite the club's newness
and small size, the members
are very aware that Circle K is,
in the words of Rutter, "a
registered volunteer service
organization at Stanford" and
that its purpose is to serve the
community "in any way they
can."
Included among their
already-completed three proj
ects were a Halloween party
for approximately 120 children
at the Creative Montessori
School in East Palo Alto and a
three-day hypertension
screening program in White
Plaza. In addition, the club is
planning a basketball tourna
ment for the children on the
waiting list in the Big Brother
program.
Circle K Club at Stanford
was initiated in 1977 when the
Palo Alto Kiwanis Club
decided to sponsor the club
on campus. The Kiwanis or
ganization, as a sponsor, sup
ports the club financially by
paying Circle K's national
dues, according to White.
