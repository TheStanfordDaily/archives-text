## Big Game is big deal for Card hoopsters 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
It's Friday the 13th and Stan
ford Basketball Coach Tom
Davis is praying something
won't go wrong.
But if something does, and
"wrong'' takes the form of a
loss to UC-Berkeley in
tonight's 8 p.m. game at
Maples Pavilion, even praying
might be a waste of time for
the Cardinal.
Although Davis is hesitant to
admit it, tonight's Pacific-10
Conference contest has to be
considered a "must win" for
Stanford if it hopes to keep its
post-season tournament
chances within reason.
The Cardinal is 0-3 in the
Pac-10 after three losses to
conference foes in six days by
a total of 11 points. Granted,
two of those setbacks were to
ranked teams — No. 6 UCLA
and No. 15 Oregon State —
but should Stanford drop to 0-
4, it will be travelling the
wrong way on a raging river.
Upstream.
"I think it is a big game to
us," Davis said, "but all the
Pac-10 games are. And Cal has
been playing well."
Cal enters the game 1-1 in
the Pac-10 and 8-4 overall. The
Bears were routed by Wash
ington in their conference
opener Jan. 2, but came back
three days later to edge
Oregon 55-54.
"Cal is good," Davis contin
ued. "We could go out and
play a good game and lose.
You just have to come out and
take your chances. That's life
in the Pac-10."
One thing Cal isn't, though,
is tall. Ever since 6-foot-11 cen
ter Michael Pitts went down
early in the season with a knee
injury and 6-6 forward Frank
Avalos was declared academi
cally ineligible, the Bears
haven't been ducking under
any doorways.
"It's changed their style
some," Davis said of Pitts'
loss. "It's hurt them to lose a
player of his calibre."
While Coach Dick Kuchen
has indeed changed Cal's style
of play to a ball-control,
defense-oriented team, there
are those that disagree with
Davis and actually believe
losing Pitts, Cal's leading
scorer and rebounder, has
helped them.
Former forward Dave But

ler, last season's Pac-10
Rookie of the Year, has moved
into the vacated center posi
tion and performed admirab
ly, averaging 14.5 points and
6.0 rebounds a game in Pac-10
play. Guard Butch Hays has
also picked up some of the
scoring slack in conference ac
tion with his 14.0 points per
game average.
None of the other Bear
starters — 6-4 jeff Thilgen, 6-8
Gordon Anderson and 6-1
Chris Washington — are
averaging more than seven
points or three rebounds a
game in Pac-10 play, however.
"Cal has some similar prob
lems as us," Davis said. "We
match up pretty evenly with
them."
Davis plans to go with the
same starting line-up he's
used in the first three Pac-10
games — 6-1 Keith )ones and
6-0 Keith Ramee at guard, 6-6
Earl Koberlein and 6-2 Steve
Brown at forward and 6-7 John
Revelli at center.

Because of the similarity in
the two teams, Davis will be
afforded the luxury of playing
a man-to-man defense, some
thing he hasn't been able to
do against the Card's first
three taller opponents.
Davis also will probably be
able to play 6-9 Hans Wichary
and 6-4 Andy Fischer, who
both missed the UCLA trip
with injuries. Even if the two
don't start, the added depth
could be a factor late in the
game.
If Stanford is to chalk up its
first conference win, it will
have to keep Cal's team shoot
ing percentage down. The
Card's first three Pac-10 oppo
nents have shot a blistering
63.7 percent from the floor.
Most of the torrid shooting
has been done in the second
half, as Oregon State went 16-

for-20 (80 percent), Oregon
17-for-21 (81 percent) and
UCLA 16-for-21 (72 percent) in
the second half of their games
against Stanford
"There are two things you
can do (to lower the field
goal percentages)," Davis
said. "Number one, you can't
get behind. This is a ball con
trol league. So once you get
behind, you're forced to come
out of your defense and you
give up some easy shots
inside.
"The other is to identify
who the good shooters are on
the other team, and come out
and play more aggresive
defense against them."
The good shooter, or rather
great shooter, on the other
team last year was guard Mi
chael Chavez, who scored 20
of his 24 points from long
range to lead Cal past the Card
66-64 in Maples Pavilion in the
teams' last meeting.
But Chavez, who won more
than one Stanford-Cal game
for the Bears in his career, has
graduated. And his absence
from tonight's game may be
the difference that the Card
needs to break a string of four
staight Cal victories over Stan
ford.The Bears have also won
three of the last four games in
Maples Pavilion.
Card notes
Tonight's 8 p.m. tip-off is a
half-hour later than the usual
7:30 p.m. because of televi
sion. Metrosports, which has a
contract with the Pac-10 this
season, will carry the game
live. Locally, Channel 48 (KSTS
in San Jose) will air it as well as
ESPN, the 24-hour sports cable
network that will pick up
Metrosports' broadcast.
There is a good possibility
that a few seats will be
available for tonight's game,
although it is technically a sell
out. The availability and num
ber of general admission tick
ets will depend on the ex
pected student turnout, as
students hold nearly half the
tickets in Maples. Any general
admission tickets that do go
on sale will do so shortly
before game-time.
Revelli needs just one more
free throw to break the Stan
ford individual career record
of 459 set by Kimberly Belton
(1977-80), Stanford's all-time
leading scorer and rebounder.

Card's first three Pac-10 oppo
nents have shot a blistering
63.7 percent from the floor.
Most of the torrid shooting
has been done in the second
half, as Oregon State went 16-

for-20 (80 percent), Oregon
17-for-21 (81 percent) and
UCLA 16-for-21 (72 percent) in
the second half of their games
against Stanford
"There are two things you
can do (to lower the field
goal percentages)," Davis
said. "Number one, you can't
get behind. This is a ball con
trol league. So once you get
behind, you're forced to come
out of your defense and you
give up some easy shots
inside.
"The other is to identify
who the good shooters are on
the other team, and come out
and play more aggresive
defense against them."
The good shooter, or rather
great shooter, on the other
team last year was guard Mi
chael Chavez, who scored 20
of his 24 points from long
range to lead Cal past the Card
66-64 in Maples Pavilion in the
teams' last meeting.
But Chavez, who won more
than one Stanford-Cal game
for the Bears in his career, has
graduated. And his absence
from tonight's game may be
the difference that the Card
needs to break a string of four
staight Cal victories over Stan
ford.The Bears have also won
three of the last four games in
Maples Pavilion.
Card notes
Tonight's 8 p.m. tip-off is a
half-hour later than the usual
7:30 p.m. because of televi
sion. Metrosports, which has a
contract with the Pac-10 this
season, will carry the game
live. Locally, Channel 48 (KSTS
in San Jose) will air it as well as
ESPN, the 24-hour sports cable
network that will pick up
Metrosports' broadcast.
There is a good possibility
that a few seats will be
available for tonight's game,
although it is technically a sell
out. The availability and num
ber of general admission tick
ets will depend on the ex
pected student turnout, as
students hold nearly half the
tickets in Maples. Any general
admission tickets that do go
on sale will do so shortly
before game-time.
Revelli needs just one more
free throw to break the Stan
ford individual career record
of 459 set by Kimberly Belton
(1977-80), Stanford's all-time
leading scorer and rebounder.

It's Friday the 13th and Stan
ford Basketball Coach Tom
Davis is praying something
won't go wrong.
But if something does, and
"wrong'' takes the form of a
loss to UC-Berkeley in
tonight's 8 p.m. game at
Maples Pavilion, even praying
might be a waste of time for
the Cardinal.
Although Davis is hesitant to
admit it, tonight's Pacific-10
Conference contest has to be
considered a "must win" for
Stanford if it hopes to keep its
post-season tournament
chances within reason.
The Cardinal is 0-3 in the
Pac-10 after three losses to
conference foes in six days by
a total of 11 points. Granted,
two of those setbacks were to
ranked teams — No. 6 UCLA
and No. 15 Oregon State —
but should Stanford drop to 0-
4, it will be travelling the
wrong way on a raging river.
Upstream.
"I think it is a big game to
us," Davis said, "but all the
Pac-10 games are. And Cal has
been playing well."
Cal enters the game 1-1 in
the Pac-10 and 8-4 overall. The
Bears were routed by Wash
ington in their conference
opener Jan. 2, but came back
three days later to edge
Oregon 55-54.
"Cal is good," Davis contin
ued. "We could go out and
play a good game and lose.
You just have to come out and
take your chances. That's life
in the Pac-10."
One thing Cal isn't, though,
is tall. Ever since 6-foot-11 cen
ter Michael Pitts went down
early in the season with a knee
injury and 6-6 forward Frank
Avalos was declared academi
cally ineligible, the Bears
haven't been ducking under
any doorways.
"It's changed their style
some," Davis said of Pitts'
loss. "It's hurt them to lose a
player of his calibre."
While Coach Dick Kuchen
has indeed changed Cal's style
of play to a ball-control,
defense-oriented team, there
are those that disagree with
Davis and actually believe
losing Pitts, Cal's leading
scorer and rebounder, has
helped them.
Former forward Dave But

ler, last season's Pac-10
Rookie of the Year, has moved
into the vacated center posi
tion and performed admirab
ly, averaging 14.5 points and
6.0 rebounds a game in Pac-10
play. Guard Butch Hays has
also picked up some of the
scoring slack in conference ac
tion with his 14.0 points per
game average.
None of the other Bear
starters — 6-4 jeff Thilgen, 6-8
Gordon Anderson and 6-1
Chris Washington — are
averaging more than seven
points or three rebounds a
game in Pac-10 play, however.
"Cal has some similar prob
lems as us," Davis said. "We
match up pretty evenly with
them."
Davis plans to go with the
same starting line-up he's
used in the first three Pac-10
games — 6-1 Keith )ones and
6-0 Keith Ramee at guard, 6-6
Earl Koberlein and 6-2 Steve
Brown at forward and 6-7 John
Revelli at center.

Because of the similarity in
the two teams, Davis will be
afforded the luxury of playing
a man-to-man defense, some
thing he hasn't been able to
do against the Card's first
three taller opponents.
Davis also will probably be
able to play 6-9 Hans Wichary
and 6-4 Andy Fischer, who
both missed the UCLA trip
with injuries. Even if the two
don't start, the added depth
could be a factor late in the
game.
If Stanford is to chalk up its
first conference win, it will
have to keep Cal's team shoot
ing percentage down. The
Card's first three Pac-10 oppo
nents have shot a blistering
63.7 percent from the floor.
