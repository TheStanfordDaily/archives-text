# Lady hoopsters to start league play tonight
## 
### JOHN LIS 
With a 2-10 non-conference
start behind it, the Stanford
women's basketball team
opens league play this
weekend. The Cardinal travels
to Cal State-Fullerton tonight
and will square off against Cal
State-Long Beach tomorrow in
a pair of WCAA contests.
Stanford Head Coach Dotty
McCrea is optimistic despite
the poor start. "We're looking
at it as a whole new season, "
she said. "We're getting bet
ter every game, and the
players have got to realize that
they're a better team than they
think."
Cal State-Fullerton is 8-5
overall this season. In their
sole non-conference game
they dropped a 72-65 decision
to San Diego State last Tues
day.
Fullerton is led by 6-3 junior
center Terri Withers, who is
averaging 15.5 points and 8.4
rebounds per game. She is

shooting 57 percent from the
field. Joining Withers are 5-8
sophomore guard Robin
Holmes (13.7 points per game)
and 6-0 junior forward Meg
Callagher (12.5 ppg).
After eight games Fullerton
was 7-1 and led the nation in
field goal shooting at a 56 per
cent clip. The shooting has
cooled substantially, and
Fullerton has dropped four of
its last five contests.
McCrea is confident about
her team's chances against
Fullerton. "We match up
pretty evenly with them, " she
said, "but we'll have to play 40
minutes to beat them, " a ref
erence to the Cardinal's ten
dancy to lose its concentration
for five to 10 minutes in a
game and lose to teams it had
otherwise outplayed.
Cal State-Long Beach also
opened quickly, winning its
first seven games before fal
ling to 7-3. Those three losses,
however, were all to ranked

teams — Texas, Louisiana
Tech, and Old Dominion —
and Long Beach is ranked No.
7 in the nation in the latest
poll.
Long Beach is paced by 6-3
junior forward Kirsten Cum
mings, averaging 19 points
and 8.7 rebounds an outing.
Joining her are 6-5 junior cen
ter Janet Davis and 6-4 senior
forward Nina Leonard to give
Long Beach one of the tallest
front lines in the nation. 5-9
junior guard Faye Paige is
averaging 13.3 points per
game.
McCrea looked realistically
at Stanford's chances at Long
Beach, but said, "We'll just
play the team, not their
reputation."
Following the road trip, the
Cardinal returns home next
Tuesday night to face non
conference foe St. Mary's. It
will be Stanford's first game at
Maples Pavilion in over a
month.


The Stanford women's basketball team will use its feet to ac
complish a pair of feats this weekend in away games against

Cal-State Fullerton and Cal-State Long Beach. The team now
holds a 2-10 non-league record.
