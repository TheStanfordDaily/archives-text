# Faculty Senate member questions plan
## Kennedy defends proposed athletic cuts 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Staff writer 
The proposal to offset the Athletic
Department's $1 million budget def
icit by creating a three-tiered system
for the University's 24 intercol
legiate sports teams was strongly
defended by University President
Donald Kennedy at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
Classics Department Chairman
Marsh McCall called the proposed
three-tiered system a "major disap
pointment" and asked if "the daily
running of the Athletic Department
is under strictest possible control?"
In response to McCall's comments
Kennedy said, "It is certainly not a

case of mismanagement within the
department."
The budget deficit, which is ex
pected to reach $1.25 million by Au
gust 1984, is largely a result of the
loss of projected income from tele
vision and gate revenue during foot
ball season due to the team's 1-10
record. The football program is the
major source of revenue for all Ath
letic Department programs.
The proposed three-tiered system
would create three levels for varsity
sports. The 16 teams on the top level
would not suffer any budget cuts
but the second level teams will only
have part-time coaching, no recruit
ing or scholarships and will only

compete on a local level. The third
level teams will be the most affected
and will be responsible for their
own funding, as are Stanford's pres
ent club sports teams.
Kennedy said in regard to the Ath
letic Department, "We are dealing
with an enterprise with a very
volatile income source . . . the defi
cit as a percentage is not as large as
some debts in academic depart
ments." Kennedy expressed regret
at having to cut funds for sports pro
grams but stated, "The amount of
programs we would like to have,
and have had over the past three to
