## Kennedy defends proposed athletic cuts 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Staff writer 
The proposal to offset the Athletic
Department's $1 million budget def
icit by creating a three-tiered system
for the University's 24 intercol
legiate sports teams was strongly
defended by University President
Donald Kennedy at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
Classics Department Chairman
Marsh McCall called the proposed
three-tiered system a "major disap
pointment" and asked if "the daily
running of the Athletic Department
is under strictest possible control?"
In response to McCall's comments
Kennedy said, "It is certainly not a

case of mismanagement within the
department."
The budget deficit, which is ex
pected to reach $1.25 million by Au
gust 1984, is largely a result of the
loss of projected income from tele
vision and gate revenue during foot
ball season due to the team's 1-10
record. The football program is the
major source of revenue for all Ath
letic Department programs.
The proposed three-tiered system
would create three levels for varsity
sports. The 16 teams on the top level
would not suffer any budget cuts
but the second level teams will only
have part-time coaching, no recruit
ing or scholarships and will only

compete on a local level. The third
level teams will be the most affected
and will be responsible for their
own funding, as are Stanford's pres
ent club sports teams.
Kennedy said in regard to the Ath
letic Department, "We are dealing
with an enterprise with a very
volatile income source . . . the defi
cit as a percentage is not as large as
some debts in academic depart
ments." Kennedy expressed regret
at having to cut funds for sports pro
grams but stated, "The amount of
programs we would like to have,
and have had over the past three to


Donald Kennedy
four years, may simply not be
manageable over the next four to
five years' income."
The new three-tiered sports pro
posal has not been finalized yet and
may still be subject to change. Ken
nedy noted the difficulty in propos
ing program cuts.
"There is no sport you can drop
or reduce in status that does not
have an articulate, and impressively
large constituency ... I can't
believe the number of people who
fence for Stanford," Kennedy said.
Under the new proposal, fencing,
which is currently a varsity sport,
would be dropped to the third level.
One solution to the Athletic De
partment's deficit may be to expand
the fund-raising efforts of the de
partment.
"Our Department of Athletics has
been very successful in fund-raising
in the past but the degree of restric
tion on proceeds is a problem,"
Kennedy said. "If we could ease
those restrictions we could offer
more programs."
The senate also heard the Annual
Report for 1982-1983 from the Com
mittee on Computing and Informa
tion Technology (C-CIT). The com
mittee considered the topic of com
puter literacy.
"We didn't think this was a bur

ning issue . . . but what it is and how
to implement it can be infinitely
argued," according to Graduate
School of Business Professor lames
Miller, who presented the report.
The committee saw computer
literacy occuring as a natural
process. "We didn't recommend
any degree requirements," Miller
said. "We didn't feel it was neces
sary . . . we hope everyone will en
courage their students to become
computer literate . . . and we hope
that the administration will nut mnrp
teaching and financial resources be
hind this,"
The committee defined two levels
of computer literacy and deter
mined that the majority of under
graduates — some 50 to 60 percent
— can do at least minimum level
computer work, while probably only
10 to 15 percent are considered
"pretty good." Miller said these
were only very rough approxima
tions.
The decision not to implement
computer literacy requirements for
graduation was also a result of the
committee's observations that the
two main computer programming
courses here are regularly oversub
scribed.
The committee also recognized
the need for more computer power
and facilities for students.
Civil Engineering Prof. Robert
Street, vice provost for the commit
tee, called LOTS "heavily over
loaded," adding that "There are

limits on the number of hours stu
dents may use the system . . . there
is a problem with demand both on
the classroom and computer power
side ... we don't want to stifle the
use of computing ... we are very
conscious of the problem."
Student access to terminals has
somewhat improved with the in
crease in terminals in dorms and in
Meyer Library, according to Street.
"We suspect there will be a fairly
radical change in computing on
nmnm ... as we develop personal
computers on campus we may need
less technical courses ... it is prob
ably not appropriate to leap to con
clusions about expanding CS 105 or
106 until we see how computing
evolves over a relatively short per
iod of time," he said.
Kennedy also reported to the sen
ate on the status of the Ronald
Reagan Library and Policy Center
proposal. Kennedy said, "There is
not much to report with respect to
the Ronald Reagan Library . . . Our
proposal was again labelled unac
ceptable by the White House and
there the matter rests."
In response to a question by En
glish Prof. Ronald Rebholz, Kennedy
said, "There was some reference in
the press that we wrote a letter to
(White House Aide Edwin) Meese
summarizing our position," but ac
cording to Kennedy, the letter con
tained no new information and
merely formalized what had already
been proposed.

sary . . . we hope everyone will en
courage their students to become
computer literate . . . and we hope
that the administration will nut mnrp
teaching and financial resources be
hind this,"
The committee defined two levels
of computer literacy and deter
mined that the majority of under
graduates — some 50 to 60 percent
— can do at least minimum level
computer work, while probably only
10 to 15 percent are considered
"pretty good." Miller said these
were only very rough approxima
tions.
The decision not to implement
computer literacy requirements for
graduation was also a result of the
committee's observations that the
two main computer programming
courses here are regularly oversub
scribed.
The committee also recognized
the need for more computer power
and facilities for students.
Civil Engineering Prof. Robert
Street, vice provost for the commit
tee, called LOTS "heavily over
loaded," adding that "There are

limits on the number of hours stu
dents may use the system . . . there
is a problem with demand both on
the classroom and computer power
side ... we don't want to stifle the
use of computing ... we are very
conscious of the problem."
Student access to terminals has
somewhat improved with the in
crease in terminals in dorms and in
Meyer Library, according to Street.
"We suspect there will be a fairly
radical change in computing on
nmnm ... as we develop personal
computers on campus we may need
less technical courses ... it is prob
ably not appropriate to leap to con
clusions about expanding CS 105 or
106 until we see how computing
evolves over a relatively short per
iod of time," he said.
Kennedy also reported to the sen
ate on the status of the Ronald
Reagan Library and Policy Center
proposal. Kennedy said, "There is
not much to report with respect to
the Ronald Reagan Library . . . Our
proposal was again labelled unac
ceptable by the White House and
there the matter rests."
In response to a question by En
glish Prof. Ronald Rebholz, Kennedy
said, "There was some reference in
the press that we wrote a letter to
(White House Aide Edwin) Meese
summarizing our position," but ac
cording to Kennedy, the letter con
tained no new information and
merely formalized what had already
been proposed.
The proposal to offset the Athletic
Department's $1 million budget def
icit by creating a three-tiered system
for the University's 24 intercol
legiate sports teams was strongly
defended by University President
Donald Kennedy at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
Classics Department Chairman
Marsh McCall called the proposed
three-tiered system a "major disap
pointment" and asked if "the daily
running of the Athletic Department
is under strictest possible control?"
In response to McCall's comments
Kennedy said, "It is certainly not a

case of mismanagement within the
department."
The budget deficit, which is ex
pected to reach $1.25 million by Au
gust 1984, is largely a result of the
loss of projected income from tele
vision and gate revenue during foot
ball season due to the team's 1-10
record. The football program is the
major source of revenue for all Ath
letic Department programs.
The proposed three-tiered system
would create three levels for varsity
sports. The 16 teams on the top level
would not suffer any budget cuts
but the second level teams will only
have part-time coaching, no recruit
ing or scholarships and will only

compete on a local level. The third
level teams will be the most affected
and will be responsible for their
own funding, as are Stanford's pres
ent club sports teams.
Kennedy said in regard to the Ath
letic Department, "We are dealing
with an enterprise with a very
volatile income source . . . the defi
cit as a percentage is not as large as
some debts in academic depart
ments." Kennedy expressed regret
at having to cut funds for sports pro
grams but stated, "The amount of
programs we would like to have,
and have had over the past three to


Donald Kennedy
four years, may simply not be
manageable over the next four to
five years' income."
The new three-tiered sports pro
posal has not been finalized yet and
may still be subject to change. Ken
nedy noted the difficulty in propos
ing program cuts.
"There is no sport you can drop
or reduce in status that does not
have an articulate, and impressively
large constituency ... I can't
believe the number of people who
fence for Stanford," Kennedy said.
Under the new proposal, fencing,
which is currently a varsity sport,
would be dropped to the third level.
One solution to the Athletic De
partment's deficit may be to expand
the fund-raising efforts of the de
partment.
"Our Department of Athletics has
been very successful in fund-raising
in the past but the degree of restric
tion on proceeds is a problem,"
Kennedy said. "If we could ease
those restrictions we could offer
more programs."
The senate also heard the Annual
Report for 1982-1983 from the Com
mittee on Computing and Informa
tion Technology (C-CIT). The com
mittee considered the topic of com
puter literacy.
"We didn't think this was a bur

ning issue . . . but what it is and how
to implement it can be infinitely
argued," according to Graduate
School of Business Professor lames
Miller, who presented the report.
The committee saw computer
literacy occuring as a natural
process. "We didn't recommend
any degree requirements," Miller
said. "We didn't feel it was neces
sary . . . we hope everyone will en
courage their students to become
computer literate . . . and we hope
that the administration will nut mnrp
teaching and financial resources be
