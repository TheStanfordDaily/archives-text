# Wichary will step back soon

### ADAM BERNS 
Some say that absence
makes the heart grow
fonder. This could certainly
be said ot Stanford Coach
Tom Davis' feelings about
the temporary loss of Hans
Wichary.
The 6-foot-9 senior for
ward (with one year of
eligibility remaining), who
started the first 10 games
of the season, but suffered
an ankle sprain against
BYU-Hawaii on Dec. 28 and
has been out of action
since then. His status is
questionable tonight
against UC-Berkeley, al
though he has practiced
lightly with the team.
According to Davis Wich
ary is a streak shooter, the
kind of player who is on
one night and then off the
next. Unlike many other
players of comparable size
and physique, Wichary
likes to shoot from outside
as well as from underneath
the basket. Davis, however,
said that he underes
timated Wichary's physical
contribution to the team.
"We miss Wichary more
than I think we thought we
would," Davis said. "We
need his physical presence
in the inside. Our guards
have had to pack it in
more."
Before the injury, Wic
hary had averaged 5.8
points a game shooting 22-
of-53 from the field. He also
had hit 14-of-22 free
throws. His most important
contribution to the team,
however, was probably his

presence under the basket
where he had 46 rebounds,
15 offensive, for a 4.6 per
game average, second on
the team to senior center
John Revelli.
Wichary has been shoot
ing around the last couple
of days of practice but has
not competed vigorously
and still has problems cut
ting hard on the ankle.
Even if Wichary doesn't
start, there is a good
chance that he might see
limited action tonight.
Davis was quick to point
out, though, that Wichary

would not play if there was
any question about his abil
ity to cut or the possibility
of re-injury.
"This is only the second
day that I've really com
peted in practice," Wichary
said yesterday. "I'll find out
today and tomorrow whe
ther I am ready to play. I
don't think that I'll start,
but I might see some action
against Cal tomorrow.
While I haven't been able
to jump, ever since I have
been injured, I have
practiced my shooting.
While sitting out and

recovering from an injury is
difficult, it is not a new ex
perience for Wichary. Two
years ago, he broke a bone
in his right foot after six
games and had to sit out
the rest of the season. Wic
hary is quick to point out
the difference between that
injury and his current ankle
sprain.
"It's completely differ
ent," Wichary said. "First
of all, the injury is on a dif
ferent foot. It's that way
(frustrating) any time you
are injured, but I knew that
it was just a matter of time
before I'd be back."
Many people feel that the
loss of Wichary was critical,
especially because he
missed all three of Stan
ford's close Pacific-10 Con
ference losses. Wichary,
however, is hesitant to say
how much of a contribu
tion he would have been
able to make.
"One player cannot have
that much of an effect,"
said a modest Wichary. "I'd
like to hope that I could
have made a difference,
but when a team loses a
player it shouldn't change
things that much."
At 6-9, Wichary is Stan
ford's tallest player, two
inches taller than Stanford
center John Revelli. While
speculation on how Wic
hary might have contrib
uted in Stanford's three
Pac-10 losses is futile, there
is little question that his
return will make a differ
ence.
