## It's not 'Moby Dic,' but it beats souvenir shops Whale watching on the coast 
### TIM GRIEVE 
It was a combination of
things: Dad's love for anyth
ing having to do with the sea;
little brother's eagerness to
watch things biological, espe
cially marine-biological; my
hopes for avoiding another
hour of browsing in "those
darling little shops in Carmel"
and Mom's desire to get rid of
the whole family for a couple
hours of peace.
That's why we were racing
through Monterey's version of
the universally-generic Fisher
man's Wharf to board the New
Roz for a three-hour whale
watching excursion. We made
it to the New Roz (it's an old
joke, but I would hate to see
the Old Roz) with seconds to
spare before our appointed
departure time. But that didn't
really matter. The crew of the
New Roz was busy cleaning
bags full of rotting cod from
the boat's early morning
deep-sea charter trip. An hour
later, as the crew finished
hosing down the paint-peeling
deck of the New Roz, we
climbed aboard. Dodging
poorly-aimed sardines thrown
from the tourists above to the
sea lion below, we waited for
the trip to begin.
As the sky grew gray I
thought more and more about

Cilligan's Island. "Five pas
sengers set sail that day for a
three-hour tour, a three-hour
tour." We know the rest of
that story. And my plans for

the future didn't include
eating coconut pies with the
millionaire and his wife, the
movie star, the professor and
Mary Ann.

The skipper cranked up the
groaning motor of the New
Roz and we were on our way,
out of the dock, past the rocks
covered with sea lions and

seals (what's the difference,
anyway?) and into the Pacific.
A half hour later, the skip
per in the bridge said that he
had spotted some whales
about a hundred yards to the
left (he spared us the old port
starboard routine). We stared
and stared out to the left. And

we saw nothing. About five
minutes later, the skipper
shouted that he had seen the
whales again, a whole mess of
em, about 100 yards out.
This time we saw what he
was describing. There were
tiny bursts of water every
couple of minutes, about two
miles away. Somehow the
skipper's version of yards and
mine didn't quite match up.
But that didn't matter. We'd
paid our eight bucks to see
whales, and, by god, whales
were what we were about to
see.
Sure enough, there they
were. Little bursts of water
way off in the distance. Until
we saw whale tails come out of
the water, little brother was
sure the whale boat compan
ies had installed little foun
tains in the Pacific, the same
sort that simulate cannonballs
hitting the water in Dis
neyland's Pirates of the Carib
bean.
But we did see whales,
about 15 in all, before we
headed back to the harbor an
hour later on the pretext that
"there are reports of more
whales back in that direction."
The pictures in the
brochures show whales practi
cally running into tour boats.
We never came within half a
mile of the whales, but it beats
browsing through shelves of
captains hats, California pen

nants and abalone ashtrays.
There are a couple of ways
to watch the Cray Whales on
their migratory passes be
tween now and May. You can
head down to Monterey and
go out on a charter boat. The
average cost is $8 for a three
hour trip aboard any of the
four or five boats that leave
from Fisherman's Wharf.
Easier, cheaper, and a lot
closer is whale watching near
Half Moon Bay, where you can
drive out to the Montara
Lighthouse in Montara at
Highway 1 and 16th Street.
The experts say that this spot
is best for watching the Gray
Whales on their return trip
from Baja California's warm
waters in February through
April.
For the more complete
marine-biology tour, head
south down Highway 1 to Ano
Nuevo State Reserve, where
you can see the whales, plus
sea otters, harbor seals, Cali
fornia sea lions and elephant
seals, hippo-sized sea mam
mals that climb up on dry
ground to mate, fight and gen
erally check things out.
Reservations are required for
access to the elephant seals'
breeding ground.
Between now and April,
though, you should be able to
see whales from just about
anywhere on the coast, from
Monterey to Fort Bragg.

hour trip aboard any of the
four or five boats that leave
from Fisherman's Wharf.
Easier, cheaper, and a lot
closer is whale watching near
Half Moon Bay, where you can
drive out to the Montara
Lighthouse in Montara at
Highway 1 and 16th Street.
The experts say that this spot
is best for watching the Gray
Whales on their return trip
from Baja California's warm
waters in February through
April.
For the more complete
marine-biology tour, head
south down Highway 1 to Ano
Nuevo State Reserve, where
you can see the whales, plus
sea otters, harbor seals, Cali
fornia sea lions and elephant
seals, hippo-sized sea mam
mals that climb up on dry
ground to mate, fight and gen
erally check things out.
Reservations are required for
access to the elephant seals'
breeding ground.
Between now and April,
though, you should be able to
see whales from just about
anywhere on the coast, from
Monterey to Fort Bragg.

It was a combination of
things: Dad's love for anyth
ing having to do with the sea;
little brother's eagerness to
watch things biological, espe
cially marine-biological; my
hopes for avoiding another
hour of browsing in "those
darling little shops in Carmel"
and Mom's desire to get rid of
the whole family for a couple
hours of peace.
That's why we were racing
through Monterey's version of
the universally-generic Fisher
man's Wharf to board the New
Roz for a three-hour whale
watching excursion. We made
it to the New Roz (it's an old
joke, but I would hate to see
the Old Roz) with seconds to
spare before our appointed
departure time. But that didn't
really matter. The crew of the
New Roz was busy cleaning
bags full of rotting cod from
the boat's early morning
deep-sea charter trip. An hour
later, as the crew finished
hosing down the paint-peeling
deck of the New Roz, we
climbed aboard. Dodging
poorly-aimed sardines thrown
from the tourists above to the
sea lion below, we waited for
the trip to begin.
As the sky grew gray I
thought more and more about

Cilligan's Island. "Five pas
sengers set sail that day for a
three-hour tour, a three-hour
tour." We know the rest of
that story. And my plans for

the future didn't include
eating coconut pies with the
millionaire and his wife, the
movie star, the professor and
Mary Ann.

The skipper cranked up the
groaning motor of the New
Roz and we were on our way,
out of the dock, past the rocks
covered with sea lions and

seals (what's the difference,
anyway?) and into the Pacific.
A half hour later, the skip
per in the bridge said that he
had spotted some whales
about a hundred yards to the
left (he spared us the old port
starboard routine). We stared
and stared out to the left. And

we saw nothing. About five
minutes later, the skipper
shouted that he had seen the
whales again, a whole mess of
em, about 100 yards out.
This time we saw what he
was describing. There were
tiny bursts of water every
couple of minutes, about two
miles away. Somehow the
skipper's version of yards and
mine didn't quite match up.
But that didn't matter. We'd
paid our eight bucks to see
whales, and, by god, whales
were what we were about to
see.
Sure enough, there they
were. Little bursts of water
way off in the distance. Until
we saw whale tails come out of
the water, little brother was
sure the whale boat compan
ies had installed little foun
tains in the Pacific, the same
sort that simulate cannonballs
hitting the water in Dis
neyland's Pirates of the Carib
bean.
But we did see whales,
about 15 in all, before we
headed back to the harbor an
hour later on the pretext that
"there are reports of more
whales back in that direction."
The pictures in the
brochures show whales practi
cally running into tour boats.
We never came within half a
mile of the whales, but it beats
browsing through shelves of
captains hats, California pen

nants and abalone ashtrays.
There are a couple of ways
to watch the Cray Whales on
their migratory passes be
tween now and May. You can
head down to Monterey and
go out on a charter boat. The
average cost is $8 for a three
hour trip aboard any of the
four or five boats that leave
from Fisherman's Wharf.
