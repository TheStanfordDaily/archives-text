Friday the 13th. A terrifying
day for the superstitious, but
for most Stanford students it's
just another Friday signaling
another weekend of partying.
Just why the day casts such
power over some people is a
mystery. After a quick check
through some reference
books, Liz Salzer, head libra
rian at Meyer, said that she
found reference to the "ill
luck of the 13th," which is
"heightened if the 13th hap
pens to fall on a Friday." She
also said that encyclopedias
make references to Friday as
the day of crucifixion and that
perhaps this is where the fa
mous date arose."
Psychology Prof. George
Quattrone, cited the self
fulfilling prophecy belief in
which some psychologists
believe that if one believes
something will effect his be
havior on a particular day, he's

likely to change his behavior
to make the prediction a
reality.
The number 13, of course, is
also feared by many. Most
high-rise office buildings
seemingly were designed with
a floor of air built in, with the
elevator proceeding directly
from the 12th to the 14th floor.
In some airplanes, passengers
looking for a seat in row 13 are
out of luck.
In recent years, the day has
been commemorated with a
series of movies going by the
date as its title in which jason,
a man hiding his face behind a
hockey mask, goes on murder
sprees on the appropriate
date, preying on perverted
teenagers.
But residents of Branner
didn't seem fazed in the
slightest yesterday by the
events that today might hold
in store.
Atul Cawande considers the
day to be "a lot of poppycock.

I'd probably give it some
credence if the world happens
to disappear tomorrow."
Along the same vein, David
Fisher said that he takes "no
stock in it whatsoever. I just
hope bad luck befalls Cal in
the basketball game tomor
row."
Telford Work, however, was
more troubled by the implica
tions of the day."I have a
problem with the time zones.
Is half the world terrified at
one time and the other not?
Why couldn't you just jump
across the International Date
Line at midnight and avoid the
whole problem?"
Rick Kelly commented,
"Friday the 13th? It was a good
movie."
Perhaps T. Bag Biglow and
Kelvin Davis, RAs in Branner
Hall, summed up the feeling
of most on The Farm about the
day, "It's overrated."
