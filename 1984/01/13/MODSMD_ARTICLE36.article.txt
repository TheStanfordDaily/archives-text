# MacArthur Park simple, good, but a bit expensive

MACARTHUR PARK
27 University Avenue
Palo Alto
After the initial excitement
of seeing old friends and at
tending parties during
Registration Day, most of us
are stricken with the reality
that another quarter has
passed and yet another quar
ter has begun with the hor
rors of homework, midterms
and all-nighters. This harsh
confrontation with reality
wouldn't be nearly so bad ex
cept for one small thing: How
are you supposed to study
when your stomach is com
plaining about an overdose of
Cross-ribs of Veal, Stewed Egg
plant and Quiche a la Food
Service?
Unfortunately, I have not
discovered a restaurant that
will help prepare you for your
calculus midterm, nor have I
discovered a permanent rem
edy for the ill-fated meals at
Food Service. However, I
hope that I will be able to offer
you a couple of suggestions
about where to go when you
want to escape from your
books, Country Fried Steak
and melted ice cream.
Eating dinner out is usually
most memorable when it of
fers you the chance to enjoy
comfortable surroundings,
good food and most impor
tantly, entertaining conversa
tion. The Mac Arthur Park Res
taurant gives you the opportu
nity to enjoy all of these

things. In fact, it can turn an
ordinary dinner into a real
event, tor dinner at tho Park
almost guarantees a good time
for all.
The atmosphere at Shu Ar
thur Park 1 s best described as
"classy"—a well-lit dining
room with large plants white
tableclothes brass handrail
ings and gentK rotating ceiling
fans. The tables in the main
dining room are tairk well
spaced, but I would recom
mend asking tor a table up in
one of the two balconies—it is
away from the hub of activity
and lends itself to a more inti
mate meal.
Although we were greatly
distracted by the idea of
drawing on our placemats,
(the restaurant furnishes each
table with a set of crayons just
in case there may be a bud
ding Toulouse-Lautrec lurking
around Palo Alto) we finally
got around to ordering. By the
time I finished drawing the last
arm on my stick-figure family,
our appetizers had arrived.
At $4 a plate, Smoked Rare
Tenderloin may seem a bit ex
pensive, but if you appreciate
the taste of superior quality,
succulent beef, then the cost
is well worth it. The tenderloin
is served very rare and it is
beautifully arrayed on a large
platter. The paper-thin strips
of beef offer a robust flavor
which is enhanced by a
delightful horseradish sauce
and a zippy Mexican salsa.
The Potato Skins ($2.75)

were not exactly your average
dried skins filled with mounds
of sour cream and cheese —
they were more like sliced,
boiled potatoes. They didn't
offer much flavor beyond the
taste of a baked potato, and
the size of the serving —
enough for an entire army —
makes me think that they
aren't one of the most popular
items on the menu.
The selection of entrees is
divided into two categories.
The Oakwood Smoker con
sists of several old-time bar

becued favorites such as
chicken and baby back ribs, as
well as some more interesting
dishes like California Duck
and Marinated Sierra Rabbit.
The Mesquite Charcoal Broiler
offers two special fish selec
tions, pork chops, steaks and
fresh game hen.
Not wanting to miss any
thing, we decided to order one
entree from each category.
The combination barbecue
platter consists of ample por
tions of barbecued chicken,
ribs and sausage ($10.95.) But,

beware! This entree is not rec
ommended to anyone who
doesn't enjoy spreading their
meal all over their arms, face
and lap. However, Mac Arthur
Park, keeping the overzealous
eater in mind, does supply an
oversized plastic bib which
should protect all but the most
enthusiastic Neanderthal. The
chicken was both meaty and
tender and it was cooked just
right—crispy on the outside,
but juicy and flavorful inside.
The ribs are supposedly a
specialty at Mac Arthur Park,
but I was disappointed with
them. For me, the two keys to
good ribs are a zesty BBQ
sauce and a meaty slab of ribs.
However, the ribs at Mac A
rthur Park were not very meaty,
and I thought that the little
amount of meat on the bones
was somewhat tough.The
sauce was adequate, but I
would prefer a little less
ketchup and a lot more spice
and pizazz. Nonetheless, I still
managed to coat myself with
sauce and I nearly suffered a
fatal accident when my bib fell
to the floor — luckily my
friend rushed to my aid before
I drowned.
Although the sausage isn't
nearly as much fun to eat as
the ribs, it is truly interesting.
The pork and veal sausage has
a marvelous mix of spices and
hickory flavor — it beats Oscar
Meyer by a long shot!
Our other entree was won
derfully simple, grilled filet of
salmon ($10.80). There was

nothing dramatic about this
entree (it isn't nearly as messy
as our other choice) yet it was
delicious. The salmon was
very fresh and tender and it
was grilled to perfection. The
filet was lightly seasoned and
served with a lemon wedge. It
made me feel that more res
taurants should subscribe to
Mac Arthur Park's example
that simple is often best.
Any average restaurant can
produce a pretty good version
of Mud Pie, but only a few
places can create a fantastic
rendition. Judy's Mud Pie
($2.75) is certainly within the
latter category. Judy's Mud Pie
is especially good because she
uses coffee ice cream,
(probably Haagen Dazs) rather
than some unexciting brand of
chocolate. All in all, the com
bination of ice cream, choco
late sauce, and a non-soggy
graham cracker crust adds up
to a taste sensation that every
one must experience.
But WAIT! Don't stop with
your last bite of mud pie, be
cause there's more — you
simply cannot pass by the
Turtle Pie!!! This nifty little
concoction tastes just like en
glish toffee — a crust of
crushed nuts, filled with choc
olate and smothered in a thick
caramel sauce. Guaranteed to
raise you blood-sugar level 100
percent.
In addition to these block

buster desserts, Mac Arthur
Park offers Apple Brown Betty
($2.65) and Fresh Pecan Pie
($1.95) as well as Fresh Berries
in Cream ($2.75) which we
used as a welcomed palate
cleanser in between our other
two desserts.
Eating dinner at Mac Arthur
Park is really a lot of fun. The
atmosphere seems almost
festive and the workers are
quick, efficient and friendly.
Our waiter was always ener
getic and nice despite the fact
that he had to keep running
up and down the stairs be
tween the main dining room
and balcony. Mac Arthur Park
takes a great deal of care in
their preparations, from the
beautifully arrayed appetizers
and entrees to the house salad
which is an exquisite display
of fresh and colorful
vegetables.
Mac Arthur Park does suffer
from a few drawbacks — the
menu is not overly creative
and the prices are a touch
high. Nonetheless, Mac Arthur
Park offers good quality food
and an atmosphere that is con
ducive to having a good time.
So, when you're looking for a
quick break from the grind of
school work and the
monotony of Food Service,
why don't you walk on over to
Mac Arthur Park? — I think
you'll enjoy it.
