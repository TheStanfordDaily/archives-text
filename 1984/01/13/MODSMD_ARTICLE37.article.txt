Freaks (1 9T2)
New Varsity, Palo Alio
Tod Brownings (hiller,
scl in the tantali/ing
milieu of the c ire us,
begins with a prefatory
title th.it begs compassion
tor the tv pic allv mot keel
and mistreated unfor
tunates t (impelled to seek
employment as sideshow
freaks. But the horror of
the pit ture — and it is one
of the scariest movies
Hollywood has ever
produced — is the func
tion of the ver\
deficiencies and distor
tions that we were told
should make us sympa
thetic to these characters.
Willis Goldbec k and Leon
Cordon adapted the
fatuous, amateurish script
from a Tod Robbins story
called "Spurs." Olga
Bac l.inova plays the
cheap, manipulative
circus star who marries
one of the "freaks/' cuck
olds him, and elects her
self the target of .1
monstrous revenue.
Wallace Ford and Leila
Hyams c o-star.
Plavs Monday evening

The Stinj» (197 J)
( übberlev Auditorium
David S. Ward strung
together antique ideas
from the irresistible-rogue
school of fiction, and
(.eorge Roy Hill, the

director, gave them such
flossy packaging th.it
audiences didn't notice
how wan and limp they'd
become over the years,
rhis cute, grinning com
edy about .1 (supposedly)
ingenious scam and its
(supposedly) charming
perpetrators — Paul New
man and Robert Redford,
neither of whom does ,inv
real acting — made pot
loads of monev and
carried off the Best
Picture Oscar. Every
cight-vear-old who could
knock out .1 tune haltingly
on the piano learned Mar
vin Hamlisch's corruption
of the Scott Joplin rag
("The Entertainer") that
serves as the film's theme
song. With Robert Shaw
as the major impediment
to the con men-heroes'
success, Eileen Brennan,
Charles Durning, Rav
Walston, John Heffernan,
Dimitra Arliss and Harold
Ciould.
Plays tonight.
Rebel Without a Cause
(1955)
kresge Auditorium
A bad movie of uncom
mon resonance. James
Dean was already a star in
consequence of his
feverous performance as
Cal in Elia Ka/an's East of
Eden; Rebel made him .1
">os cult hero, like the
voung Brando, and when

he died in a c ar c rash the
next year, millions of
teenagers were shattered.
Nearly 10 years later,
many movie lovers feel
very close to this movie,
in which Dean gives the
quintessential misun
derstood vouth perfor
mance. He and the movie
override Stewart Stern's
obvious screenplay and
are unreasonably moving.
Nicholas Rav did the
heavy, effective direction.
Jim Backus and Ann
Doran plav Dean's par
ents, Natalie Wood is the
girl who loves him, Sal
Mineo (at his most
histrionic ) is his faithful
spaniel. With Dennis
Hopper in a small part.
Plays tonight.
t
War Games (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
john Badham's picture
starts with a terrific satiric
premise: The potential for
global nuc lear war resides
in the domain of com
puters, which are gigantic J
toys, so in effect World
War 111 is an international
game. And for more than
halt the movie the
filmmakers clearly know
exactly what they're
doing. The script by
Lawrence Lasker and Wal
ter F. Parkes has a quintes-
American
edge-ot-the-abyss humor
that may remind vou of

The Mitiu huri.in Con
did tit e and Blow Out;
Bad ham has never been so
fleet-footed or in sue h
easy control; and, as Iht*
Seattle teenager who in
advertently taps into
NORAD's computer, Mat
thew Brodcrick displays
the freshest double takes
since Robert Mac-
Naughton in E.J. Some
where past the midwa\
mark, however, the movie
deteriorates into fairlv
mushheaded pedantry.
Still, the first half hour
provides almost uninter
rupted pleasure, its
adolescent anarchic pull
giving it much of its
sneaky appeal.
Plays Sunday evening.
The Cold Rush (1925)
Kresge Auditorium
Charles Chaplin's justly
famous comedy, in which
he plays a prospector who
seeks his fortune in
Alaska, with Mack Swain
as the villain and Georgia
Hale as the dance hall girl,
as well as Tom Murray,
Henry Bergman, Malcolm
Waite and Betty Morris
sey. The scene in which
Chaplin boils and eats his
shoe is one of the most
remarkable (and delicate)
examples of physic al com
edy ever photographed.
Plays Wednesday eve
ning.
