# Prof. picked to lead space panel

### LARRY GREEN Staff writer 
The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) has se
lected a professor here to head a
task force responsible for guiding
the development of a proposed
space station scheduled for con
struction in the 19905.
Prof. Peter Banks, director of the
Space Telecommunications and
Radio Science (STAR) Laboratory,
said he is pleased at his appoint
ment. "I've been a proponent (of a
manned space station) for a long
time," he said.
The task force will be looking into
finding the most suitable guidelines
for the space station. Banks said he
believes that the task force will
emerge as the focal point of the
space science community for the
next several years because it will
probably become a clearinghouse of
ideas for the future space station.
Fifteen other leading space scien
tists from universities and scientific
institutions across the nation will
comprise the group. Banks has
already led two studies in the past
for NASA, both designed to deter
mine how experiments should be
carried out in space.
Banks' particular interest is in the
"Pleiades Project." This project was
designed by 40 graduate students
from the School of Engineering's
space engineering course. It calls
for a large space platform sur
rounded by as many as eight to 10
small co-orbiting satellites.
He noted that currently the idea
behind Pleiades is "not widely ap
proved by NASA" but when the plat
form goes into production it will
probably be very similar. He said,
"Many of the ideas (behind
Pleiades) have made their way" in
influencing NASA's policies.

The task force will operate for two
years, under the funding of the
NASA Office of Space Science.
"Spokesmen (from various space re
search and academic institutions)
will present their views to us,"
Banks said. The task force will be re
sponsible for sorting through the
various proposals and ideas for the
space station and selecting the most
efficient and practical plan.
He also noted that he wants to
clarify "the scientific rationale" for
the station. He believes that science
is not the only field that can benefit
from a space station.
Still, he said he sees participating
in the task force, in his words, as
"an add-on research opportunity."
When he is not concentrating on
the NASA task force, Banks will be
busy directing the STAR lab. Among
the areas of study on which STAR lab
is working, Banks mentioned that
"from the radio science side, we're
looking into space-based radar
which will help in oceanography."
STAR lab also concentrates on
areas such as observing the rings of
Jupiter, satellite communications
and experiments to be done on the
Space Shuttle, like one that Banks
and other scientists at STAR lab ran
which he described as
"fundamental plasma physics."
Banks, who is 46, has been in
volved in space science for the past
20 years, since he was a graduate
student at Stanford. His prime con
cern as head of the task force will be
to present a plan acceptable to both
NASA and the American space sci
ence community.
He said he does not want space
scientists to carry the full weight of
such a momentous project. "There
is quite a bit of interest" from com
mercial firms for a space station, he
said.
