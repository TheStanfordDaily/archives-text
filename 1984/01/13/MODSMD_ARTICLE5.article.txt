### CLAY CALVERT LISA LYNCH Senior staff writers 
Although former ASSU senator lames
McCrath insists that his resignation last
quarter was purely because of the time
commitment of senatorial duties, several
questions have been raised about his con
duct as a senator.
McCrath said that he simply did not have
the time to serve on the senate. Resigna
tions by senators are not unusual, he said,
noting that most senators follow a "typical
cycle": As winter quarter approaches, stu
dents often find the time commitment of a
senator to be too great.
McCrath said he "debated about it
(resigning) for a couple of months" before
deciding it would be a better investment of
time to prepare for graduation in )une.
McGrath's long career as a graduate stu
dent here is partly a result of the fact that he

has not been registered every quarter.
However, the constitution of the senate
states that "an officer of the association
must be registered as a student."
McGrath was neither registered for
spring quarter, when he ran for office, nor

for a large portion of last quarter. A call
placed to the registrar's office at the end of
November confirmed that at that time
McGrath had not registered.
McGrath said that the rule on registration
requires only that senators register at some
point during the quarter. He claims that he
did not know he would not end up register
ing last spring quarter.
"I was planning on registering late," he
said, "but that fell through for a variety of
academic reasons."
"In my mind, I never consciously broke
any rule," the former Rules Committee
Chairman said. "After all, I wrote the law."
According to Senate Deputy Chair Donna
Anderson, McGrath's registration status
alone could not disqualitfy him as a
senator. "During spring quarter, he was
illegal in running for senator," she said,
"but once the COP (Council of Presidents)

ratified the election, there's no way you can
change things."
Anderson would not discuss the reasons
behind McGrath's resignation, but said that
it was "better for both parties that McGrath
resigned."
COP member Pete Spivack said that at
times there were some conflicts between
McGrath and the other ASSU senators.
Spivack, who cited McGrath's reform for
ASSU election procedures as his greatest
accomplishment in the Senate, said that
McGrath had "verbal spars with other
senators over disagreement on rules and
procedures" he created.
According to senator Bob Slater, some
senators were "perhaps a little resentful
that (McGrath) did as much as he did."
Slater said that last year at least one senator
expressed resentment that McGrath
dominated the senate and was the only

senator to draw up bills.
"McGrath) got along obviously better
with some (senators) than others," Slater
said.
McGrath responded that "all this scut
tlebutt makes interesting background but it
was not the principal reason I resigned."
McGrath added he felt that he generally
was "looked on as the person to do all the
work" because of his understanding of the
ASSU rules and his contacts with members
of the University community.
He also said he maintained a
"professional relationship" with other
members of the senate, adding that there
was a "respectful attitude" among the
senators with whom he served. He said that
while he might have had disagreements
with senators on certain issues, none
resulted in a "personal grudge match situa
tion."
