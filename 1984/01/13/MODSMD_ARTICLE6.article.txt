Pilot's death called 'intolerable'
Washington — The White House yesterday
branded Nicaragua's killing of a U.S. Army helicop
ter pilot along the Honduras-Nicaragua border as
intolerable and said the U.S. response will
depend on Nicaragua's explanation of the incident.
Pentagon and State Department officials immedi
ately denied any plans for military retaliation, and
relatively restrained statements by Secretary of State
George Shultz and Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government indicated that neither country wanted a
confrontation over the shooting.
But U.S. officials also cautioned that they could
not speak for the Hondurans, in whose territory the

pilot was killed. "I don't know what the Hondurans
might do, since it was a violation of their border by
the Nicaraguans," one Defense Department official
said.
The incident prompted an influential congress
man, Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Mo.), to charge that
the Reagan administration has "misled the public"
about the disposition of U.S. forces participating in
military maneuvers in Honduras.
Barnes, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Latin America, said he and other
congressmen had been repeatedly assured "that no
U.S. forces were going to be anywhere near that
border." He called for "a full investigation and com
plete explanation of what the helicopter was doing
in the very volatile area."
The downed helicopter was part of a U.S. contin
gent in Honduras that now totals about 2900 men. Its

pilot, Chief Warrant Officer )effery Schwab of Joliet,
111., was killed about 8:30 a.m. Wednesday by
"hostile fire . . , from the direction of the
(Nicaraguan) border" after his observation helicop
ter landed in Honduras close to the border, the
Pentagon said. Two Army engineers in the helicop
ter were not injured.
"The indefensible thing," Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger said yesterday, "is that the pilot
was killed after he was out of the helicopter and
simply walking around an unarmed helicopter." A
Pentagon officer said an extended "fire fight" oc
curred around the aircraft after it landed.
Nicaragua appeals to Reagan
Managua, Nicaragua — Chief of State Daniel Or
tega declared yesterday there is no "innocent" ex

planation for Wednesday's flight of an American
helicopter along the troubled Nicaraguan-Honduran
border.
Ortega, head of the ruling three-man junta, ap
pealed to the Reagan administration not to allow the
forcing down of the U.S. OH-58 Scout helicopter by
Nicaraguan gunfire and the death of its pilot to
become a "pretext" for a reprisal attack or an
"escalation" of U.S.-sponsored guerrilla raids
against Nicaragua.
Ortega challenged Washington's assertion that
Nicaraguan soldiers acted unacceptably by firing on
the craft, which Nicaragua has charged violated its
airspace before landing just over the border in Hon
duras. He would neither confirm nor deny U.S.
charges that the pilot was killed when Nicaraguans
then continued shooting at him and his two pas
