Pilot's death called 'intolerable'
Washington — The White House yesterday
branded Nicaragua's killing of a U.S. Army helicop
ter pilot along the Honduras-Nicaragua border as
intolerable and said the U.S. response will
depend on Nicaragua's explanation of the incident.
Pentagon and State Department officials immedi
ately denied any plans for military retaliation, and
relatively restrained statements by Secretary of State
George Shultz and Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government indicated that neither country wanted a
confrontation over the shooting.
But U.S. officials also cautioned that they could
not speak for the Hondurans, in whose territory the

pilot was killed. "I don't know what the Hondurans
might do, since it was a violation of their border by
the Nicaraguans," one Defense Department official
said.
The incident prompted an influential congress
man, Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Mo.), to charge that
the Reagan administration has "misled the public"
about the disposition of U.S. forces participating in
military maneuvers in Honduras.
Barnes, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Latin America, said he and other
congressmen had been repeatedly assured "that no
U.S. forces were going to be anywhere near that
border." He called for "a full investigation and com
plete explanation of what the helicopter was doing
in the very volatile area."
The downed helicopter was part of a U.S. contin
gent in Honduras that now totals about 2900 men. Its

pilot, Chief Warrant Officer )effery Schwab of Joliet,
111., was killed about 8:30 a.m. Wednesday by
"hostile fire . . , from the direction of the
(Nicaraguan) border" after his observation helicop
ter landed in Honduras close to the border, the
Pentagon said. Two Army engineers in the helicop
ter were not injured.
"The indefensible thing," Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger said yesterday, "is that the pilot
was killed after he was out of the helicopter and
simply walking around an unarmed helicopter." A
Pentagon officer said an extended "fire fight" oc
curred around the aircraft after it landed.
Nicaragua appeals to Reagan
Managua, Nicaragua — Chief of State Daniel Or
tega declared yesterday there is no "innocent" ex

planation for Wednesday's flight of an American
helicopter along the troubled Nicaraguan-Honduran
border.
Ortega, head of the ruling three-man junta, ap
pealed to the Reagan administration not to allow the
forcing down of the U.S. OH-58 Scout helicopter by
Nicaraguan gunfire and the death of its pilot to
become a "pretext" for a reprisal attack or an
"escalation" of U.S.-sponsored guerrilla raids
against Nicaragua.
Ortega challenged Washington's assertion that
Nicaraguan soldiers acted unacceptably by firing on
the craft, which Nicaragua has charged violated its
airspace before landing just over the border in Hon
duras. He would neither confirm nor deny U.S.
charges that the pilot was killed when Nicaraguans
then continued shooting at him and his two pas
sengers on the ground. He said his government was
investigating the incident.
His comments, in an interview arranged at the
Nicaraguan government's initiative, reflected evi
dent concern here that the incident could lead to in
creased U.S. hostility and a larger scale of military
pressure against the Sandinista revolution.
"Logically, the last thing the Sandinista army sol
diers in the Jalapa region could have imagined is a
North American helicopter," Ortega said. "The last
thing they supposed was that they were shooting at
a North American helicopter."
Jalapa is the Nicaraguan town nearest a border
area where the Defense Ministry said the U.S.
helicopter penetrated Nicaraguan air space and
overflew several villages and army posts before
being fired on by Nicaraguan soldiers with auto
matic rifles.
North Korean meeting unlikely
Tokyo — U.S., South Korean and Japanese officials
agreed yesterday that while North Korea has signifi
cantly shifted its stance by urging three-way talks on
unification with the South, the formula was unlikely
to result in a meeting.
Only if the North agreed to include China in on
the discussions, and possibly the Soviet Union as
well, would the proposed talks among the two
Koreas and the United States get anywhere, they
said.
Nevertheless, they noted that the Communist
government in Pyongyang had scrapped the cus
tomary diatribe against Seoul as the puppet stooge
of Washington and did not insist on its past version
of how the Koreas could be reunited.
And it did tend to put the South Korean govern
ment in a spot. Former President Carter and the late
South Korean President Park Chung Hee had jointly
proposed a three-way conference in the summer of
1979. It was rejected by the Communists, who are
now proposing a similar format. This time South
Korea is rejecting it and President Reagan is suggest
ing that four-way talks would be better.
The North Korean proposal broadcast on Pyon
gyang radio Wednesday offered talks with the
United States and South Korea about a nonaggres
sion pact and a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armi
stice agreement that left the country divided after a
brutal three-year war.
What seemed new was an offer to include South
Korea. In the past, the North has insisted on talking
directly with the United States because Americans,
not South Koreans, had signed the armistice agree
ment. The United States has consistently refused to
bypass its ally in Seoul.
South Korea responded Wednesday by saying that
to create favorable conditions for talks, the North
"should" admit to and apologize for the bombing in
Rangoon, Burma, on Oct. 9 that killed 17 South
Koreans, including our Cabinet ministers.
Zhao leaves Washington
Washington — The United States and China yester
day signed agreements strengthening their technical
and economic ties, and Reagan administration offi
cials proclaimed three days of talks with Chinese
Premier Zhao Ziyang to be an unqualified success.

Shortly after Zhao left the White House on his way
to San Francisco, a senior administration official said
that the visit had been especially significant because
Zhao committed China to non-proliferation of nu
clear weapons technology and declared China's
desire to see tensions lessened in Korea.
Nonetheless, one of the more significant issues
under negotiation between the two countries was
left unresolved, involving an agreement under
which the United States would provide the Chinese
with nuclear technology for a massive electrical
power program over the next two decades.
A senior administration official who briefed
reporters at the White House said that this week's
talks "did substantially narrow our differences" on
nuclear policy. He noted agreement had been
reached in several key areas.
But he conceded that China remained reluctant to
accept some of the conditions required by U.S. law
regarding inspection of and security for enriched
uranium.
And, he added, both nations have reached the
point where little flexibility remains in negotiations.
However, he said that the possibility exists that an
agreement can be completed by the time President
Reagan travels to Peking in late April.
Zhao and Reagan met privately for about 10
minutes yesterday morning before attending break
fast with members of the Cabinet and signing two
Washington-Peking accords. One pact extended a
science and technology agreement for five years,
while the other initiated new industrial and tech
nological cooperation.
Heart disease study released
Washington—Results of a nationwide clinical trial
prove what doctors have suspected for years:
Reducing the levels of fatty cholesterol in the blood
cuts the risks of heart disease, scientists said yester
day.
And researchers said the 10-year Coronary Primary
Prevention Trial to find out if a drug that alters
cholesterol levels can decrease coronary disease
and heart attack has proved much more.
"This is the first study to demonstrate conclusively
that the risk of coronary heart disease can be
reduced by lowering blood cholesterol, as we previ
ously suspected," said Dr. Basil Rifkind of the Na
tional Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the branch of
the National Institute of Health which sponsored the
study.
Although there have been considerable evidence
from previous human and animal studies that
cholesterol reduction cuts heart disease, none has
been conclusive until now, Rifkind said at a news
briefing.
Dr. Robert Levy of Columbia University, a heart
disease expert who headed the heart institute when
the study began, said the results have implications
far beyond the middle-aged men with high choles
terol levels used in the study.
"Now, for the first time, we have conclusive
evidence that people can do something about heart
disease by lowering their cholesterol," Levy said in
an interview.
"The study showed that the greater the reduction
of cholesterol toward normal levels, the greater the
reduction of heart attack events," he continued.
Experts estimate that more than 40 million
Americans have moderate to high levels of choles
terol and other fats.

Clark plans oil lease changes
Washington—lnterior Secretary William Clark
yesterday announced changes in former Secretary
James Watt's controversial offshore oil and gas
leasing program that could reduce the territory of
fered for exploration and give states and environ
mental groups more influence in the leasing
process.
Clark said a "concerted effort will be made to
avoid dragging through the 22-month leasing
process those areas where industry interest is mini
mal and where conflicts exist with other uses."
He said, "more key decisions" will be made ear
lier and "communications will be strengthened"
through publication of leasing plans, more detailed
descriptions of leases and increased public
hearings.
"I pledge to communicate with the states and
other affected areas and interests before the sales
process begins, and continuously thereafter," Clark
said in a speech to the Outer Continental Shelf
Policy Committee, an advisory panel.
Oil and gas companies "will be urged and ex
pected," he said to reveal where they want to lease
in order to "facilitate early balancing" of defense,
environmental and economic interests.
Clark outlined the changes a day after the Reagan
administration won a victory in the Supreme Court,
which ruled against the right of states to block of
fshore oil leases.
His announcement was met with cautious ap
proval by some environmentalists, who vowed to
continue pressing for congressional action giving
states clear authority to block the federal sale of oil
and gas leases.
Chrysler files suit
Detroit—Stepping up its fight against the plan by
General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. to
build cars together, Chrysler Corp. filed a lawsuit in
federal court in Washington yesterday to block the
venture.
The suit charges that the deal between GM, the
world's biggest car producer, and Toyota, the third
largest, violates U.S. antitrust laws and "will have a
devastating effect on competition in the automobile
market in the United States."
In a 3-to-2 vote last month, the Federal Trade
Commission gave provisional approval to GM and
Toyota's plan to form a new company that would
build Toyota-designed subcompact cars at a vacant
GM assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., beginning
late this year.
Final approval by the FTC awaits the completion of
a 60-day period of public comment on the commis
sion's consent decree that permits the joint venture.
That period ends Feb. 27.
Chrysler's suit was assigned to U.S. District Judge
Thomas Hogan, whose office said no hearing dates
had been set.
Panel suggests spending cuts
Washington—President Reagan's cost-cutting
commission yesterday released a final report with
recommendations it said could save the government
more than $424 billion over three years. About a
fourth of that would come from scaling back the

government's civilian and military retirement pro
grams.
"The government is run horribly," said the
panel's chairman, businessman J. Peter Grace.
"There is no company I know of, except maybe IBM.
that could survive if they ran it this way."
Among the panel's suggestion is a form, similar to
a W-2, that would be issued to everyone receiving a
federal benefit, from Social Security to milk-price
support payments. All benefits would then be
treated as income—many are not now—and be sub
ject to income tax.
This system could save nearly $60 billion in pay
ments over three years, the panel estimated, be
cause "the prospect of having to pay taxes" would
discourage many people from accepting subsidies.
The commission also took a whack at federally
supported hydroelectric power in the Pacific
Northwest, suggesting that the government either
turn over the dams and power stations there to
private enterprise, for a three year savings of $20 bil
lion , or raise electric rates to market levels for $4.5
billion in new revenues.
Smaller-ticket items included proposals to add soy
extender to ground beef in the school-lunch pro
gram, for a three year savings of $84 million, replac
ing some of the Justice Department's attorneys with
paralegals ($l3 million), and abolishing all military
commissaries in the continental United States ($1
billion.)
Stocks show small gain
New York—The stock market struggled to a small
gain yesterday, ending a three session losing streak.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about
seven points at its midday peak, closed with a net
advance of 1.99 at 1279.31. In the first three sessions
this week, the average fell 9.32 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to
99.41 million shares, against 98.66 million Wednes
day.
Today's weather
Sunny today except for morning fog or low clouds
north and east parts. Highs in the 50s to low 60s.
Northeast winds 15 to 25 mph from Carquinez Strait
to the Golden Gate Bridge and light winds else
where. Friday night and Saturday, night and mor
ning fog and low clouds north and east parts and
patchy fog inland areas elsewhere. Otherwise fair.
Lows in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs in the 50s and

1979. It was rejected by the Communists, who are
now proposing a similar format. This time South
Korea is rejecting it and President Reagan is suggest
ing that four-way talks would be better.
The North Korean proposal broadcast on Pyon
gyang radio Wednesday offered talks with the
United States and South Korea about a nonaggres
sion pact and a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armi
stice agreement that left the country divided after a
brutal three-year war.
What seemed new was an offer to include South
Korea. In the past, the North has insisted on talking
directly with the United States because Americans,
not South Koreans, had signed the armistice agree
ment. The United States has consistently refused to
bypass its ally in Seoul.
South Korea responded Wednesday by saying that
to create favorable conditions for talks, the North
"should" admit to and apologize for the bombing in
Rangoon, Burma, on Oct. 9 that killed 17 South
Koreans, including our Cabinet ministers.
Zhao leaves Washington
Washington — The United States and China yester
day signed agreements strengthening their technical
and economic ties, and Reagan administration offi
cials proclaimed three days of talks with Chinese
Premier Zhao Ziyang to be an unqualified success.

Shortly after Zhao left the White House on his way
to San Francisco, a senior administration official said
that the visit had been especially significant because
Zhao committed China to non-proliferation of nu
clear weapons technology and declared China's
desire to see tensions lessened in Korea.
Nonetheless, one of the more significant issues
under negotiation between the two countries was
left unresolved, involving an agreement under
which the United States would provide the Chinese
with nuclear technology for a massive electrical
power program over the next two decades.
A senior administration official who briefed
reporters at the White House said that this week's
talks "did substantially narrow our differences" on
nuclear policy. He noted agreement had been
reached in several key areas.
But he conceded that China remained reluctant to
accept some of the conditions required by U.S. law
regarding inspection of and security for enriched
uranium.
And, he added, both nations have reached the
point where little flexibility remains in negotiations.
However, he said that the possibility exists that an
agreement can be completed by the time President
Reagan travels to Peking in late April.
Zhao and Reagan met privately for about 10
minutes yesterday morning before attending break
fast with members of the Cabinet and signing two
Washington-Peking accords. One pact extended a
science and technology agreement for five years,
while the other initiated new industrial and tech
nological cooperation.
Heart disease study released
Washington—Results of a nationwide clinical trial
prove what doctors have suspected for years:
Reducing the levels of fatty cholesterol in the blood
cuts the risks of heart disease, scientists said yester
day.
And researchers said the 10-year Coronary Primary
Prevention Trial to find out if a drug that alters
cholesterol levels can decrease coronary disease
and heart attack has proved much more.
"This is the first study to demonstrate conclusively
that the risk of coronary heart disease can be
reduced by lowering blood cholesterol, as we previ
ously suspected," said Dr. Basil Rifkind of the Na
tional Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the branch of
the National Institute of Health which sponsored the
study.
Although there have been considerable evidence
from previous human and animal studies that
cholesterol reduction cuts heart disease, none has
been conclusive until now, Rifkind said at a news
briefing.
Dr. Robert Levy of Columbia University, a heart
disease expert who headed the heart institute when
the study began, said the results have implications
far beyond the middle-aged men with high choles
terol levels used in the study.
"Now, for the first time, we have conclusive
evidence that people can do something about heart
disease by lowering their cholesterol," Levy said in
an interview.
"The study showed that the greater the reduction
of cholesterol toward normal levels, the greater the
reduction of heart attack events," he continued.
Experts estimate that more than 40 million
Americans have moderate to high levels of choles
terol and other fats.

Clark plans oil lease changes
Washington—lnterior Secretary William Clark
yesterday announced changes in former Secretary
James Watt's controversial offshore oil and gas
leasing program that could reduce the territory of
fered for exploration and give states and environ
mental groups more influence in the leasing
process.
Clark said a "concerted effort will be made to
avoid dragging through the 22-month leasing
process those areas where industry interest is mini
mal and where conflicts exist with other uses."
He said, "more key decisions" will be made ear
lier and "communications will be strengthened"
through publication of leasing plans, more detailed
descriptions of leases and increased public
hearings.
"I pledge to communicate with the states and
other affected areas and interests before the sales
process begins, and continuously thereafter," Clark
said in a speech to the Outer Continental Shelf
Policy Committee, an advisory panel.
Oil and gas companies "will be urged and ex
pected," he said to reveal where they want to lease
in order to "facilitate early balancing" of defense,
environmental and economic interests.
Clark outlined the changes a day after the Reagan
administration won a victory in the Supreme Court,
which ruled against the right of states to block of
fshore oil leases.
His announcement was met with cautious ap
proval by some environmentalists, who vowed to
continue pressing for congressional action giving
states clear authority to block the federal sale of oil
and gas leases.
Chrysler files suit
Detroit—Stepping up its fight against the plan by
General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. to
build cars together, Chrysler Corp. filed a lawsuit in
federal court in Washington yesterday to block the
venture.
The suit charges that the deal between GM, the
world's biggest car producer, and Toyota, the third
largest, violates U.S. antitrust laws and "will have a
devastating effect on competition in the automobile
market in the United States."
In a 3-to-2 vote last month, the Federal Trade
Commission gave provisional approval to GM and
Toyota's plan to form a new company that would
build Toyota-designed subcompact cars at a vacant
GM assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., beginning
late this year.
Final approval by the FTC awaits the completion of
a 60-day period of public comment on the commis
sion's consent decree that permits the joint venture.
That period ends Feb. 27.
Chrysler's suit was assigned to U.S. District Judge
Thomas Hogan, whose office said no hearing dates
had been set.
Panel suggests spending cuts
Washington—President Reagan's cost-cutting
commission yesterday released a final report with
recommendations it said could save the government
more than $424 billion over three years. About a
fourth of that would come from scaling back the

government's civilian and military retirement pro
grams.
"The government is run horribly," said the
panel's chairman, businessman J. Peter Grace.
"There is no company I know of, except maybe IBM.
that could survive if they ran it this way."
Among the panel's suggestion is a form, similar to
a W-2, that would be issued to everyone receiving a
federal benefit, from Social Security to milk-price
support payments. All benefits would then be
treated as income—many are not now—and be sub
ject to income tax.
This system could save nearly $60 billion in pay
ments over three years, the panel estimated, be
cause "the prospect of having to pay taxes" would
discourage many people from accepting subsidies.
The commission also took a whack at federally
supported hydroelectric power in the Pacific
Northwest, suggesting that the government either
turn over the dams and power stations there to
private enterprise, for a three year savings of $20 bil
lion , or raise electric rates to market levels for $4.5
billion in new revenues.
Smaller-ticket items included proposals to add soy
extender to ground beef in the school-lunch pro
gram, for a three year savings of $84 million, replac
ing some of the Justice Department's attorneys with
paralegals ($l3 million), and abolishing all military
commissaries in the continental United States ($1
billion.)
Stocks show small gain
New York—The stock market struggled to a small
gain yesterday, ending a three session losing streak.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about

this week, the average fell 9.32 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to
99.41 million shares, against 98.66 million Wednes
day.

Pilot's death called 'intolerable'
Washington — The White House yesterday
branded Nicaragua's killing of a U.S. Army helicop
ter pilot along the Honduras-Nicaragua border as
intolerable and said the U.S. response will
depend on Nicaragua's explanation of the incident.
Pentagon and State Department officials immedi
ately denied any plans for military retaliation, and
relatively restrained statements by Secretary of State
George Shultz and Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government indicated that neither country wanted a
confrontation over the shooting.
But U.S. officials also cautioned that they could
not speak for the Hondurans, in whose territory the

pilot was killed. "I don't know what the Hondurans
might do, since it was a violation of their border by
the Nicaraguans," one Defense Department official
said.
The incident prompted an influential congress
man, Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Mo.), to charge that
the Reagan administration has "misled the public"
about the disposition of U.S. forces participating in
military maneuvers in Honduras.
Barnes, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Latin America, said he and other
congressmen had been repeatedly assured "that no
U.S. forces were going to be anywhere near that
border." He called for "a full investigation and com
plete explanation of what the helicopter was doing
in the very volatile area."
The downed helicopter was part of a U.S. contin
gent in Honduras that now totals about 2900 men. Its

pilot, Chief Warrant Officer )effery Schwab of Joliet,
111., was killed about 8:30 a.m. Wednesday by
"hostile fire . . , from the direction of the
(Nicaraguan) border" after his observation helicop
ter landed in Honduras close to the border, the
Pentagon said. Two Army engineers in the helicop
ter were not injured.
"The indefensible thing," Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger said yesterday, "is that the pilot
was killed after he was out of the helicopter and
simply walking around an unarmed helicopter." A
Pentagon officer said an extended "fire fight" oc
curred around the aircraft after it landed.
Nicaragua appeals to Reagan
Managua, Nicaragua — Chief of State Daniel Or
tega declared yesterday there is no "innocent" ex

planation for Wednesday's flight of an American
helicopter along the troubled Nicaraguan-Honduran
border.
Ortega, head of the ruling three-man junta, ap
pealed to the Reagan administration not to allow the
forcing down of the U.S. OH-58 Scout helicopter by
Nicaraguan gunfire and the death of its pilot to
become a "pretext" for a reprisal attack or an
"escalation" of U.S.-sponsored guerrilla raids
against Nicaragua.
Ortega challenged Washington's assertion that
Nicaraguan soldiers acted unacceptably by firing on
the craft, which Nicaragua has charged violated its
airspace before landing just over the border in Hon
duras. He would neither confirm nor deny U.S.
charges that the pilot was killed when Nicaraguans
then continued shooting at him and his two pas
sengers on the ground. He said his government was
investigating the incident.
His comments, in an interview arranged at the
Nicaraguan government's initiative, reflected evi
dent concern here that the incident could lead to in
creased U.S. hostility and a larger scale of military
pressure against the Sandinista revolution.
"Logically, the last thing the Sandinista army sol
diers in the Jalapa region could have imagined is a
North American helicopter," Ortega said. "The last
thing they supposed was that they were shooting at
a North American helicopter."
Jalapa is the Nicaraguan town nearest a border
area where the Defense Ministry said the U.S.
helicopter penetrated Nicaraguan air space and
overflew several villages and army posts before
being fired on by Nicaraguan soldiers with auto
matic rifles.
North Korean meeting unlikely
Tokyo — U.S., South Korean and Japanese officials
agreed yesterday that while North Korea has signifi
cantly shifted its stance by urging three-way talks on
unification with the South, the formula was unlikely
to result in a meeting.
Only if the North agreed to include China in on
the discussions, and possibly the Soviet Union as
well, would the proposed talks among the two
Koreas and the United States get anywhere, they
said.
Nevertheless, they noted that the Communist
government in Pyongyang had scrapped the cus
tomary diatribe against Seoul as the puppet stooge
of Washington and did not insist on its past version
of how the Koreas could be reunited.
And it did tend to put the South Korean govern
ment in a spot. Former President Carter and the late
South Korean President Park Chung Hee had jointly
proposed a three-way conference in the summer of
1979. It was rejected by the Communists, who are

other affected areas and interests before the sales
process begins, and continuously thereafter," Clark
said in a speech to the Outer Continental Shelf
Policy Committee, an advisory panel.
Oil and gas companies "will be urged and ex
pected," he said to reveal where they want to lease
in order to "facilitate early balancing" of defense,
environmental and economic interests.
Clark outlined the changes a day after the Reagan
administration won a victory in the Supreme Court,
which ruled against the right of states to block of
fshore oil leases.
His announcement was met with cautious ap
proval by some environmentalists, who vowed to
continue pressing for congressional action giving
states clear authority to block the federal sale of oil
and gas leases.
Chrysler files suit
Detroit—Stepping up its fight against the plan by
General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. to
build cars together, Chrysler Corp. filed a lawsuit in
federal court in Washington yesterday to block the
venture.
The suit charges that the deal between GM, the
world's biggest car producer, and Toyota, the third
largest, violates U.S. antitrust laws and "will have a
devastating effect on competition in the automobile
market in the United States."
In a 3-to-2 vote last month, the Federal Trade
Commission gave provisional approval to GM and
Toyota's plan to form a new company that would
build Toyota-designed subcompact cars at a vacant
GM assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., beginning
late this year.
Final approval by the FTC awaits the completion of
a 60-day period of public comment on the commis
sion's consent decree that permits the joint venture.
That period ends Feb. 27.
Chrysler's suit was assigned to U.S. District Judge
Thomas Hogan, whose office said no hearing dates
had been set.
Panel suggests spending cuts
Washington—President Reagan's cost-cutting
commission yesterday released a final report with
recommendations it said could save the government
more than $424 billion over three years. About a
fourth of that would come from scaling back the

government's civilian and military retirement pro
grams.
"The government is run horribly," said the
panel's chairman, businessman J. Peter Grace.
"There is no company I know of, except maybe IBM.
that could survive if they ran it this way."
Among the panel's suggestion is a form, similar to
a W-2, that would be issued to everyone receiving a
federal benefit, from Social Security to milk-price
support payments. All benefits would then be
treated as income—many are not now—and be sub
ject to income tax.
This system could save nearly $60 billion in pay
ments over three years, the panel estimated, be
cause "the prospect of having to pay taxes" would
discourage many people from accepting subsidies.
The commission also took a whack at federally
supported hydroelectric power in the Pacific
Northwest, suggesting that the government either
turn over the dams and power stations there to
private enterprise, for a three year savings of $20 bil
lion , or raise electric rates to market levels for $4.5
billion in new revenues.
Smaller-ticket items included proposals to add soy
extender to ground beef in the school-lunch pro
gram, for a three year savings of $84 million, replac
ing some of the Justice Department's attorneys with
paralegals ($l3 million), and abolishing all military
commissaries in the continental United States ($1
billion.)

Pilot's death called 'intolerable'
Washington — The White House yesterday
branded Nicaragua's killing of a U.S. Army helicop
ter pilot along the Honduras-Nicaragua border as
intolerable and said the U.S. response will
depend on Nicaragua's explanation of the incident.
Pentagon and State Department officials immedi
ately denied any plans for military retaliation, and
relatively restrained statements by Secretary of State
George Shultz and Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government indicated that neither country wanted a
confrontation over the shooting.
But U.S. officials also cautioned that they could
not speak for the Hondurans, in whose territory the

pilot was killed. "I don't know what the Hondurans
might do, since it was a violation of their border by
the Nicaraguans," one Defense Department official
said.
The incident prompted an influential congress
man, Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Mo.), to charge that
the Reagan administration has "misled the public"
about the disposition of U.S. forces participating in
military maneuvers in Honduras.
Barnes, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Latin America, said he and other
congressmen had been repeatedly assured "that no
U.S. forces were going to be anywhere near that
border." He called for "a full investigation and com
plete explanation of what the helicopter was doing
in the very volatile area."
The downed helicopter was part of a U.S. contin
gent in Honduras that now totals about 2900 men. Its

pilot, Chief Warrant Officer )effery Schwab of Joliet,
111., was killed about 8:30 a.m. Wednesday by
"hostile fire . . , from the direction of the
(Nicaraguan) border" after his observation helicop
ter landed in Honduras close to the border, the
Pentagon said. Two Army engineers in the helicop
ter were not injured.
"The indefensible thing," Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger said yesterday, "is that the pilot
was killed after he was out of the helicopter and
simply walking around an unarmed helicopter." A
Pentagon officer said an extended "fire fight" oc
curred around the aircraft after it landed.
Nicaragua appeals to Reagan
Managua, Nicaragua — Chief of State Daniel Or
tega declared yesterday there is no "innocent" ex

planation for Wednesday's flight of an American
helicopter along the troubled Nicaraguan-Honduran
border.
Ortega, head of the ruling three-man junta, ap
pealed to the Reagan administration not to allow the
forcing down of the U.S. OH-58 Scout helicopter by
Nicaraguan gunfire and the death of its pilot to
become a "pretext" for a reprisal attack or an
"escalation" of U.S.-sponsored guerrilla raids
against Nicaragua.
Ortega challenged Washington's assertion that
Nicaraguan soldiers acted unacceptably by firing on
the craft, which Nicaragua has charged violated its
airspace before landing just over the border in Hon
duras. He would neither confirm nor deny U.S.
charges that the pilot was killed when Nicaraguans
then continued shooting at him and his two pas
sengers on the ground. He said his government was
investigating the incident.
His comments, in an interview arranged at the
Nicaraguan government's initiative, reflected evi
dent concern here that the incident could lead to in
creased U.S. hostility and a larger scale of military
pressure against the Sandinista revolution.
"Logically, the last thing the Sandinista army sol
diers in the Jalapa region could have imagined is a
North American helicopter," Ortega said. "The last
thing they supposed was that they were shooting at
a North American helicopter."
Jalapa is the Nicaraguan town nearest a border
area where the Defense Ministry said the U.S.
helicopter penetrated Nicaraguan air space and
overflew several villages and army posts before
being fired on by Nicaraguan soldiers with auto
matic rifles.
North Korean meeting unlikely
Tokyo — U.S., South Korean and Japanese officials
agreed yesterday that while North Korea has signifi
cantly shifted its stance by urging three-way talks on
unification with the South, the formula was unlikely
to result in a meeting.
Only if the North agreed to include China in on
the discussions, and possibly the Soviet Union as
well, would the proposed talks among the two
Koreas and the United States get anywhere, they
said.
Nevertheless, they noted that the Communist
government in Pyongyang had scrapped the cus
tomary diatribe against Seoul as the puppet stooge
of Washington and did not insist on its past version
of how the Koreas could be reunited.
And it did tend to put the South Korean govern
ment in a spot. Former President Carter and the late
South Korean President Park Chung Hee had jointly
proposed a three-way conference in the summer of
1979. It was rejected by the Communists, who are
now proposing a similar format. This time South
Korea is rejecting it and President Reagan is suggest
ing that four-way talks would be better.
The North Korean proposal broadcast on Pyon
gyang radio Wednesday offered talks with the
United States and South Korea about a nonaggres
sion pact and a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armi
stice agreement that left the country divided after a
brutal three-year war.
What seemed new was an offer to include South
Korea. In the past, the North has insisted on talking
directly with the United States because Americans,
not South Koreans, had signed the armistice agree
ment. The United States has consistently refused to
bypass its ally in Seoul.
South Korea responded Wednesday by saying that
to create favorable conditions for talks, the North
"should" admit to and apologize for the bombing in
Rangoon, Burma, on Oct. 9 that killed 17 South
Koreans, including our Cabinet ministers.
Zhao leaves Washington
Washington — The United States and China yester
day signed agreements strengthening their technical
and economic ties, and Reagan administration offi
cials proclaimed three days of talks with Chinese
Premier Zhao Ziyang to be an unqualified success.

Shortly after Zhao left the White House on his way
to San Francisco, a senior administration official said
that the visit had been especially significant because
Zhao committed China to non-proliferation of nu
clear weapons technology and declared China's
desire to see tensions lessened in Korea.
Nonetheless, one of the more significant issues
under negotiation between the two countries was
left unresolved, involving an agreement under
which the United States would provide the Chinese
with nuclear technology for a massive electrical
power program over the next two decades.
A senior administration official who briefed
reporters at the White House said that this week's
talks "did substantially narrow our differences" on
nuclear policy. He noted agreement had been
reached in several key areas.
But he conceded that China remained reluctant to
accept some of the conditions required by U.S. law
regarding inspection of and security for enriched
uranium.
And, he added, both nations have reached the
point where little flexibility remains in negotiations.
However, he said that the possibility exists that an
agreement can be completed by the time President
Reagan travels to Peking in late April.
Zhao and Reagan met privately for about 10
minutes yesterday morning before attending break
fast with members of the Cabinet and signing two
Washington-Peking accords. One pact extended a
science and technology agreement for five years,
while the other initiated new industrial and tech
nological cooperation.
Heart disease study released
Washington—Results of a nationwide clinical trial
prove what doctors have suspected for years:
Reducing the levels of fatty cholesterol in the blood
cuts the risks of heart disease, scientists said yester
day.
And researchers said the 10-year Coronary Primary
Prevention Trial to find out if a drug that alters
cholesterol levels can decrease coronary disease
and heart attack has proved much more.
"This is the first study to demonstrate conclusively
that the risk of coronary heart disease can be
reduced by lowering blood cholesterol, as we previ
ously suspected," said Dr. Basil Rifkind of the Na
tional Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the branch of
the National Institute of Health which sponsored the
study.
Although there have been considerable evidence
from previous human and animal studies that
cholesterol reduction cuts heart disease, none has
been conclusive until now, Rifkind said at a news
briefing.
Dr. Robert Levy of Columbia University, a heart
disease expert who headed the heart institute when
the study began, said the results have implications
far beyond the middle-aged men with high choles
terol levels used in the study.
"Now, for the first time, we have conclusive
evidence that people can do something about heart
disease by lowering their cholesterol," Levy said in
an interview.
"The study showed that the greater the reduction
of cholesterol toward normal levels, the greater the
reduction of heart attack events," he continued.
Experts estimate that more than 40 million
Americans have moderate to high levels of choles
terol and other fats.

Clark plans oil lease changes
Washington—lnterior Secretary William Clark
yesterday announced changes in former Secretary
James Watt's controversial offshore oil and gas
leasing program that could reduce the territory of
fered for exploration and give states and environ
mental groups more influence in the leasing
process.
Clark said a "concerted effort will be made to
avoid dragging through the 22-month leasing
process those areas where industry interest is mini
mal and where conflicts exist with other uses."
He said, "more key decisions" will be made ear
lier and "communications will be strengthened"
through publication of leasing plans, more detailed
descriptions of leases and increased public
hearings.
"I pledge to communicate with the states and
other affected areas and interests before the sales
process begins, and continuously thereafter," Clark
said in a speech to the Outer Continental Shelf
Policy Committee, an advisory panel.
Oil and gas companies "will be urged and ex

depend on Nicaragua's explanation of the incident.
Pentagon and State Department officials immedi
ately denied any plans for military retaliation, and
relatively restrained statements by Secretary of State
George Shultz and Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government indicated that neither country wanted a
confrontation over the shooting.
But U.S. officials also cautioned that they could
not speak for the Hondurans, in whose territory the

pilot was killed. "I don't know what the Hondurans
might do, since it was a violation of their border by
the Nicaraguans," one Defense Department official
said.
The incident prompted an influential congress
man, Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Mo.), to charge that
the Reagan administration has "misled the public"
about the disposition of U.S. forces participating in
military maneuvers in Honduras.
Barnes, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Latin America, said he and other
congressmen had been repeatedly assured "that no
U.S. forces were going to be anywhere near that
border." He called for "a full investigation and com
plete explanation of what the helicopter was doing
in the very volatile area."
The downed helicopter was part of a U.S. contin
gent in Honduras that now totals about 2900 men. Its

pilot, Chief Warrant Officer )effery Schwab of Joliet,
111., was killed about 8:30 a.m. Wednesday by
"hostile fire . . , from the direction of the
(Nicaraguan) border" after his observation helicop
ter landed in Honduras close to the border, the
Pentagon said. Two Army engineers in the helicop
ter were not injured.
"The indefensible thing," Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger said yesterday, "is that the pilot
was killed after he was out of the helicopter and
simply walking around an unarmed helicopter." A
Pentagon officer said an extended "fire fight" oc
curred around the aircraft after it landed.
Nicaragua appeals to Reagan
Managua, Nicaragua — Chief of State Daniel Or
tega declared yesterday there is no "innocent" ex

planation for Wednesday's flight of an American
helicopter along the troubled Nicaraguan-Honduran
border.
Ortega, head of the ruling three-man junta, ap
pealed to the Reagan administration not to allow the
forcing down of the U.S. OH-58 Scout helicopter by
Nicaraguan gunfire and the death of its pilot to
become a "pretext" for a reprisal attack or an
"escalation" of U.S.-sponsored guerrilla raids
against Nicaragua.
Ortega challenged Washington's assertion that
Nicaraguan soldiers acted unacceptably by firing on
the craft, which Nicaragua has charged violated its
airspace before landing just over the border in Hon
duras. He would neither confirm nor deny U.S.
charges that the pilot was killed when Nicaraguans
then continued shooting at him and his two pas
sengers on the ground. He said his government was
investigating the incident.
His comments, in an interview arranged at the
Nicaraguan government's initiative, reflected evi
dent concern here that the incident could lead to in
creased U.S. hostility and a larger scale of military
pressure against the Sandinista revolution.
"Logically, the last thing the Sandinista army sol
diers in the Jalapa region could have imagined is a
North American helicopter," Ortega said. "The last
thing they supposed was that they were shooting at
a North American helicopter."
Jalapa is the Nicaraguan town nearest a border
area where the Defense Ministry said the U.S.
helicopter penetrated Nicaraguan air space and
overflew several villages and army posts before
being fired on by Nicaraguan soldiers with auto
matic rifles.
North Korean meeting unlikely
Tokyo — U.S., South Korean and Japanese officials
agreed yesterday that while North Korea has signifi
cantly shifted its stance by urging three-way talks on
unification with the South, the formula was unlikely
to result in a meeting.
Only if the North agreed to include China in on
the discussions, and possibly the Soviet Union as
well, would the proposed talks among the two
Koreas and the United States get anywhere, they
said.
Nevertheless, they noted that the Communist
government in Pyongyang had scrapped the cus
tomary diatribe against Seoul as the puppet stooge
of Washington and did not insist on its past version
of how the Koreas could be reunited.
And it did tend to put the South Korean govern
ment in a spot. Former President Carter and the late
South Korean President Park Chung Hee had jointly
proposed a three-way conference in the summer of
1979. It was rejected by the Communists, who are
now proposing a similar format. This time South
Korea is rejecting it and President Reagan is suggest
ing that four-way talks would be better.
The North Korean proposal broadcast on Pyon
gyang radio Wednesday offered talks with the
United States and South Korea about a nonaggres
sion pact and a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armi
stice agreement that left the country divided after a
brutal three-year war.
What seemed new was an offer to include South
Korea. In the past, the North has insisted on talking
directly with the United States because Americans,
not South Koreans, had signed the armistice agree
ment. The United States has consistently refused to
bypass its ally in Seoul.
South Korea responded Wednesday by saying that
to create favorable conditions for talks, the North
"should" admit to and apologize for the bombing in
Rangoon, Burma, on Oct. 9 that killed 17 South
Koreans, including our Cabinet ministers.
Zhao leaves Washington
Washington — The United States and China yester
day signed agreements strengthening their technical
and economic ties, and Reagan administration offi
cials proclaimed three days of talks with Chinese
Premier Zhao Ziyang to be an unqualified success.

Shortly after Zhao left the White House on his way
to San Francisco, a senior administration official said
that the visit had been especially significant because
Zhao committed China to non-proliferation of nu
clear weapons technology and declared China's
desire to see tensions lessened in Korea.
Nonetheless, one of the more significant issues
under negotiation between the two countries was
left unresolved, involving an agreement under
which the United States would provide the Chinese
with nuclear technology for a massive electrical
power program over the next two decades.
A senior administration official who briefed
reporters at the White House said that this week's
talks "did substantially narrow our differences" on
nuclear policy. He noted agreement had been
reached in several key areas.
But he conceded that China remained reluctant to
accept some of the conditions required by U.S. law
regarding inspection of and security for enriched
uranium.
And, he added, both nations have reached the
point where little flexibility remains in negotiations.
However, he said that the possibility exists that an
agreement can be completed by the time President
Reagan travels to Peking in late April.
Zhao and Reagan met privately for about 10
minutes yesterday morning before attending break
fast with members of the Cabinet and signing two
Washington-Peking accords. One pact extended a
science and technology agreement for five years,
while the other initiated new industrial and tech
nological cooperation.
Heart disease study released
Washington—Results of a nationwide clinical trial
prove what doctors have suspected for years:
Reducing the levels of fatty cholesterol in the blood
cuts the risks of heart disease, scientists said yester
day.
And researchers said the 10-year Coronary Primary
Prevention Trial to find out if a drug that alters
cholesterol levels can decrease coronary disease
and heart attack has proved much more.
"This is the first study to demonstrate conclusively
that the risk of coronary heart disease can be
reduced by lowering blood cholesterol, as we previ
ously suspected," said Dr. Basil Rifkind of the Na
tional Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the branch of
the National Institute of Health which sponsored the
study.
Although there have been considerable evidence
from previous human and animal studies that
cholesterol reduction cuts heart disease, none has
been conclusive until now, Rifkind said at a news
briefing.
Dr. Robert Levy of Columbia University, a heart
disease expert who headed the heart institute when
the study began, said the results have implications
far beyond the middle-aged men with high choles
terol levels used in the study.
"Now, for the first time, we have conclusive
evidence that people can do something about heart
disease by lowering their cholesterol," Levy said in
an interview.
"The study showed that the greater the reduction
of cholesterol toward normal levels, the greater the
reduction of heart attack events," he continued.
Experts estimate that more than 40 million
Americans have moderate to high levels of choles
terol and other fats.

Clark plans oil lease changes
Washington—lnterior Secretary William Clark
yesterday announced changes in former Secretary
James Watt's controversial offshore oil and gas
leasing program that could reduce the territory of
fered for exploration and give states and environ
mental groups more influence in the leasing
process.
Clark said a "concerted effort will be made to
avoid dragging through the 22-month leasing
process those areas where industry interest is mini
mal and where conflicts exist with other uses."
He said, "more key decisions" will be made ear
lier and "communications will be strengthened"
through publication of leasing plans, more detailed
descriptions of leases and increased public
hearings.
"I pledge to communicate with the states and
other affected areas and interests before the sales
process begins, and continuously thereafter," Clark
said in a speech to the Outer Continental Shelf
Policy Committee, an advisory panel.
Oil and gas companies "will be urged and ex
pected," he said to reveal where they want to lease
in order to "facilitate early balancing" of defense,
environmental and economic interests.
Clark outlined the changes a day after the Reagan
administration won a victory in the Supreme Court,
which ruled against the right of states to block of
fshore oil leases.
His announcement was met with cautious ap
proval by some environmentalists, who vowed to
continue pressing for congressional action giving
states clear authority to block the federal sale of oil
and gas leases.
Chrysler files suit
Detroit—Stepping up its fight against the plan by
General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. to
build cars together, Chrysler Corp. filed a lawsuit in
federal court in Washington yesterday to block the
venture.
The suit charges that the deal between GM, the
world's biggest car producer, and Toyota, the third
largest, violates U.S. antitrust laws and "will have a
devastating effect on competition in the automobile
market in the United States."
In a 3-to-2 vote last month, the Federal Trade
Commission gave provisional approval to GM and
Toyota's plan to form a new company that would
build Toyota-designed subcompact cars at a vacant
GM assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., beginning
late this year.
Final approval by the FTC awaits the completion of
a 60-day period of public comment on the commis
sion's consent decree that permits the joint venture.
That period ends Feb. 27.
Chrysler's suit was assigned to U.S. District Judge
Thomas Hogan, whose office said no hearing dates
had been set.
Panel suggests spending cuts
Washington—President Reagan's cost-cutting
commission yesterday released a final report with
recommendations it said could save the government
more than $424 billion over three years. About a
fourth of that would come from scaling back the

government's civilian and military retirement pro
grams.
"The government is run horribly," said the
panel's chairman, businessman J. Peter Grace.
"There is no company I know of, except maybe IBM.
that could survive if they ran it this way."
Among the panel's suggestion is a form, similar to
a W-2, that would be issued to everyone receiving a
federal benefit, from Social Security to milk-price
support payments. All benefits would then be
treated as income—many are not now—and be sub
ject to income tax.
This system could save nearly $60 billion in pay
ments over three years, the panel estimated, be
cause "the prospect of having to pay taxes" would
discourage many people from accepting subsidies.
The commission also took a whack at federally
supported hydroelectric power in the Pacific
Northwest, suggesting that the government either
turn over the dams and power stations there to
private enterprise, for a three year savings of $20 bil
lion , or raise electric rates to market levels for $4.5
billion in new revenues.
Smaller-ticket items included proposals to add soy
extender to ground beef in the school-lunch pro
gram, for a three year savings of $84 million, replac
ing some of the Justice Department's attorneys with
paralegals ($l3 million), and abolishing all military
commissaries in the continental United States ($1
billion.)
Stocks show small gain
