## Peace leaders cite Reagan defeat as foremost objective 
### HILLARY WOOD 
Among leaders of the peace movement, the desire to
defeat Ronald Reagan in the upcoming elections out
weighs concern with selecting an ideal presidential
candidate, according to a poll released by the Stanford
Nuclear Arms Educational Service.
Scott Pious, the director of the service, noted that a
majority of the 25 percent of the peace movement
headquarters that responded to the survey strongly
support former Vice President Mondale. He called that
percentage "phenomenal," adding that he had ex
pected a more typical figure of about 5 percent.
However, Political Science Prof. Richard Brody com
mented that the response is not unusual. Brody has ex
tensively researched political poll-taking and presiden
tial races throughout his career.
The service mailed 1400 surveys to 1240 arms control,
peace and political action groups. The mailing list was
drawn from the American Peace Directory, a highly
touted directory among peace groups. The poll only
"addressed peace group headquarters, excluding
branches, because of the possibility of overlap.
Specifically, the poll asked, "If Ronald Reagan is

reelected, what do you think the chances are ot a nu
clear exchange with the Soviet Union in the next 10
years?" Almost 80 percent replied positively.
The Service is a four-year-old group, consisting of 12
students and faculty, funded in part by a grant from the
Stanford Arms Control and Disarmament Forum.
Poll results also demonstrated that many of those
who responded to the survey believe that President
Reagan will likely draw us into a nuclear war in his
second term. Because of this, the groups tend to aban
don choosing between nuclear arms control and dis
armament platforms of the Democratic presidential
candidates in order to back Mondale — the only can
didate perceived to be capable of defeating Reagan.
Although former Sen. George McGovern was selec
ted as the most ideal candidate (50.2 percent), peace
group headquarters recommended voting for Mondale
(41.2 percent). More than 50 percent indicated Reagan
as the most likely to be elected.
The percentage supporting Mondale roughly
equaled that of Sen. Alan Cranston — who often bills
himself as the "peace candidate" — and McGovern
combined, specifically 41.2 percent to 43.8 percent.
