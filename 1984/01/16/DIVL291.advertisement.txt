PLEIADES: A STANFORD DESIGN FOR

SPACE STATION

Time:
MONDAY, JANUARY 16 — 4:15
refreshments, 4 pm
Place:
McCULLOUGH BLDG, ROOM 134
abstract
The Pleiades system, designed by Stanford students, is a 'flotilla'-like
distributed space system to support the diverse requirements of doing
science in shuttle serviceable Low Earth Orbit.
The Pleiades system is designed to be capable of initial deployment
in the early 1990's and to be capable of supporting the evolving
scientific endeavors for several decades to follow. We show that a
categorization of the classes of scientific investigation along with an
analysis of the act of scientists 'doing science' leads naturally to our
suggested system as a way to optimize the sc'entific payoffs of
space-based exploration. Also discussed is the role of our system as the
transition to a permanently manned space station.
