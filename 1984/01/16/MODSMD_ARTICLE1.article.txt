More than 400 people celebrated the birthday of
the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., at a party yesterday at
Kresge Auditorium that featured uplifting speeches
and songs.
The celebrants were urged to fight for King's goals
of racial equality and social justice.
The keynote speaker, Howard University Prof. Or
lando Taylor, told the audience to honor King and
his ideas every day.
"After the last song has been sung and the last
speech has been given, I want all of you to realize
that it would be an insult to the memory of Martin
Luther King, Jr., if there were only to be one day of
celebration," Taylor said. "We need to recognize
what he said, what he meant by what he said and,
most importantly, what his ideas mean for today and
tomorrow."

When King was assassinated on April 4, 1968,
Taylor said he was afraid King's non-violent methods
and ideas had died.
"I recall my own rage at the time of his death," he
said. "Here we are some 16 years later. I don't hear
the eulogy of a dead dream, but I hear a celebration
of hope. Are his words merely articulate bits of rhet
oric which are irrelevant to 1984 ?" \
In his books and speeches, King called for black
Americans to improve themselves by working for
political power, economic development and politi
cal awareness, Taylor said.
King saw political power as essential to the ad
vancement of any social group, he said.
"People only respond to power," Taylor said.
"That is, those with the power to take what is right
fully theirs."
