More than 400 people celebrated the birthday of
the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., at a party yesterday at
Kresge Auditorium that featured uplifting speeches
and songs.
The celebrants were urged to fight for King's goals
of racial equality and social justice.
The keynote speaker, Howard University Prof. Or
lando Taylor, told the audience to honor King and
his ideas every day.
"After the last song has been sung and the last
speech has been given, I want all of you to realize
that it would be an insult to the memory of Martin
Luther King, Jr., if there were only to be one day of
celebration," Taylor said. "We need to recognize
what he said, what he meant by what he said and,
most importantly, what his ideas mean for today and
tomorrow."

When King was assassinated on April 4, 1968,
Taylor said he was afraid King's non-violent methods
and ideas had died.
"I recall my own rage at the time of his death," he
said. "Here we are some 16 years later. I don't hear
the eulogy of a dead dream, but I hear a celebration
of hope. Are his words merely articulate bits of rhet
oric which are irrelevant to 1984 ?" \
In his books and speeches, King called for black
Americans to improve themselves by working for
political power, economic development and politi
cal awareness, Taylor said.
King saw political power as essential to the ad
vancement of any social group, he said.
"People only respond to power," Taylor said.
"That is, those with the power to take what is right
fully theirs."

The economic health of the
black community was espe
cially important for King,
Taylor said. Saying that black
Americans had a combined
gross national product of $150
billion, Taylor called for eco
nomic cooperation in the
black community.
The presidential candidacy
of the Rev. Jesse Jackson is a
manifestation of King's call for
black Americans to organize
themselves into a strong poli
tical force, he said.
"Jesse Jackson running for
president is important,"
Taylor said.
King was a successful leader
because he knew that black
Americans were tired of the
injustice they faced in the
1950s and 19605, he said.
"We still have the problems
of racism confronting us in
jobs and housing," Taylor
said. "We know that the un

employment of black
teenagers today exceeds 40
percent. We still have the
problem of America trying in
foreign lands to sell the Ameri
can dream through the barrel
of a gun or the threat of a nu
clear weapon."
The audience at the celebra
tion was mainly made up of
black students, faculty and
staff at Stanford. There also
was a contingent of people
from predominantly black East
Palo Alto.
Rachel Bagby, program co
ordinator for the Afro-
American Studies Program,
said the federal government's
decision to establish King's
birthday as a national holiday
was a victory for supporters of
civil rights and racial equality.
"This is a victory that will
put in the national mind the
achievements and thoughts of
this great man," Bagby said.
"Martin Luther King's works
are still being carried on by his
widow. They are still being
carried on by each of us as we

stand up for our rights and the
rights of our brothers."
Two Stanford professors
said King showed that
Americans can change their
society through social move
ments.
Assoc. History Prof.
Clayborne Carson said King
was thrust into leadership in
the late 1950s by the civil rights
movement.
"I think the main legacy is
that King demonstrated the
kind of greatness that can
emerge out of a mass social
movement," Carson said.
"Black people were ready to
take the big step toward a
struggle to gain civil rights and
more political power. In the
19505, all the conditions were
there and it (the movement)
just happened."
King succeeded in bettering
understanding between white
and black Americans, he said.
"The illusions about black
people were shattered," he
said. These misconceptions
included "the illusion that all

black people wanted to in
tegrate — the illusion that black
people were just like white
people. Whatever race rela
tions we have today are based
on a more honest understand
ing."
King would have supported
Jackson's presidential can
didacy, Carson said.
"I am sure King would have
applauded the idea," he said.
"King was in general more in
clined to do what was right
regardless of whether the
timing was right."
King was considering run
ning against President Lyndon
Johnson in 1968 for the Demo
cratic presidential nomina
tion, Carson said.
Law Prof. William Gould
said King succeeded in making
civil rights laws fair to black
and poor Americans.
"King helped to create a
nexus between Supreme
Court decisions, civil rights
legislation and the black and
poor throughout the
country," Gould said.

Americans to improve themselves by working for
political power, economic development and politi
cal awareness, Taylor said.
King saw political power as essential to the ad
vancement of any social group, he said.
"People only respond to power," Taylor said.
"That is, those with the power to take what is right
fully theirs."

The economic health of the
black community was espe
cially important for King,
Taylor said. Saying that black
Americans had a combined
gross national product of $150
billion, Taylor called for eco
nomic cooperation in the
black community.
The presidential candidacy
of the Rev. Jesse Jackson is a
manifestation of King's call for
black Americans to organize
themselves into a strong poli
tical force, he said.
"Jesse Jackson running for
president is important,"
Taylor said.
King was a successful leader
because he knew that black
Americans were tired of the
injustice they faced in the
1950s and 19605, he said.
"We still have the problems
of racism confronting us in
jobs and housing," Taylor
said. "We know that the un

employment of black
teenagers today exceeds 40
percent. We still have the
problem of America trying in
foreign lands to sell the Ameri
can dream through the barrel
of a gun or the threat of a nu
clear weapon."
The audience at the celebra
tion was mainly made up of
black students, faculty and
staff at Stanford. There also
was a contingent of people
from predominantly black East
Palo Alto.
Rachel Bagby, program co
ordinator for the Afro-
American Studies Program,
said the federal government's
decision to establish King's
birthday as a national holiday
was a victory for supporters of
civil rights and racial equality.
"This is a victory that will
put in the national mind the
achievements and thoughts of
this great man," Bagby said.
"Martin Luther King's works
are still being carried on by his
widow. They are still being
carried on by each of us as we

stand up for our rights and the
rights of our brothers."
Two Stanford professors
said King showed that
Americans can change their
society through social move
ments.
Assoc. History Prof.
Clayborne Carson said King
was thrust into leadership in
the late 1950s by the civil rights
movement.
"I think the main legacy is
that King demonstrated the
kind of greatness that can
emerge out of a mass social
movement," Carson said.
"Black people were ready to
take the big step toward a
struggle to gain civil rights and
more political power. In the
19505, all the conditions were
there and it (the movement)
just happened."
King succeeded in bettering
understanding between white
and black Americans, he said.
"The illusions about black
people were shattered," he
said. These misconceptions
included "the illusion that all

black people wanted to in
tegrate — the illusion that black
people were just like white
people. Whatever race rela
tions we have today are based
on a more honest understand
ing."
King would have supported
Jackson's presidential can
didacy, Carson said.
"I am sure King would have
applauded the idea," he said.
"King was in general more in
clined to do what was right
regardless of whether the
timing was right."
King was considering run
ning against President Lyndon
Johnson in 1968 for the Demo
cratic presidential nomina
tion, Carson said.
Law Prof. William Gould
said King succeeded in making
civil rights laws fair to black
and poor Americans.
"King helped to create a
nexus between Supreme
Court decisions, civil rights
legislation and the black and
poor throughout the
country," Gould said.

More than 400 people celebrated the birthday of
the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., at a party yesterday at
Kresge Auditorium that featured uplifting speeches
and songs.
The celebrants were urged to fight for King's goals
of racial equality and social justice.
The keynote speaker, Howard University Prof. Or
lando Taylor, told the audience to honor King and
his ideas every day.
"After the last song has been sung and the last
speech has been given, I want all of you to realize
that it would be an insult to the memory of Martin
Luther King, Jr., if there were only to be one day of
celebration," Taylor said. "We need to recognize
what he said, what he meant by what he said and,
most importantly, what his ideas mean for today and
tomorrow."

When King was assassinated on April 4, 1968,
Taylor said he was afraid King's non-violent methods
and ideas had died.
"I recall my own rage at the time of his death," he
said. "Here we are some 16 years later. I don't hear
the eulogy of a dead dream, but I hear a celebration
of hope. Are his words merely articulate bits of rhet
oric which are irrelevant to 1984 ?" \
