## The
						Stanford Daily Death on the border 
### 
A 27-year-old man, one so patriotic that he
used red, white and blue as the color scheme
at his wedding, was killed by gunfire last week
when his U.S. Army helicopter landed near the
treacherous Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
Jeffry Schwab died as a representative of the
United States, but the standard "He died for
his country," just doesn't seem to fit in this
case. Leftist troops killed Schwab while he was
in Central America on Big Pine 11, a U.S. joint
military manuever in Honduras intended to put
pressure on the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua.
There has been some debate as to what side
of the border Schwab was on when his life was
ended; while the U.S. interpretation, that the
pilot's aircraft landed on the Honduran side of
the border, is likely the correct one, it doesn't
really matter — Schwab is dead.
Hundreds of American lives have been lost
in the past year, and some may say Schwab is
nothing special, just another sad number to

add to the total figure. But it's more than that.
In Big Pine 11, the United States has had
more than 5000 servicemen at a time in Hon
duras — and all too close to the Nicaraguan
border. And what is worst is that U.S. military
presence in Honduras is becoming permanent.
Next June, a new group of large-scale joint
exercises will begin. That scheduled date, still
tentative at this point, is three months after Big
Pine 11 officially ends, but that doesn't mean
that the United States will be out of Honduras
for 12 weeks; hundreds of military personnel
will remain on hand in the country. On top of
all this, the Defense Department is considering
putting permanent bases in Honduras.
That the United States' presence in
Nicaragua's neighbor is moving away from a
temporary status should generate concern.
Pilot Schwab's death was, as the Reagan admin
istration has said, "unacceptable," but it
should not be used as an excuse for placing
more American troops in Honduras.
