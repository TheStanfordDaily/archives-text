# Celebrating 1984: We should honor Martin Luther King
## 
### 
In the spirit of 1984 I recently read George Orwell's
futuristic novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four." I had been
wondering about the massive media campaign spawn
ing a re-edition of Orwell's book, T-shirts, university
courses, colloquia, seminars, articles and book
reviews. Two questions arose while reading "Nineteen
Eighty-Four." First, why such a note of doom? Second,
had not Orwell been so selective in his choice of politi
cal history or had he lived any longer, say until 1968,
could he have written a different story?
Orwell's protagonist Winston Smith lives in Oceania,
an oppressive society that perpetuates itself by con
trolling the minds of its citizens. Winston perceives
himself as a hopeless dust speck against the mammoth,
thought-controlling BIG BROTHER. Smith makes no
protests, takes no stands against the rules of his op
pressive government without first believing that by
doing so he writes his own doom. One day, while
meditating about the hopelessness of his struggle
against the system, he has a brilliant thought and as
signs the task of human liberation to the lower class
noble savages of his time — the proles.
Other than his brief conversation with an old, senile,
drunken, non-threatening male prole, Orwell's
protagonist knows little about the proles. Yet, in his
mind, proles are the last of the "true humans" — loyal
to each other, sensuous, lusty, singing and happy
despite their impoverished, oppressive conditions.
What made Orwell's Smith believe that liberation
was the proles' responsibility? Was it his own sense of
ineptness? Guilt? Immersed in self-pity and self-doubt,
.Winston Smith fails to use his own creativity to liberate
'himself and others. Rather, he makes futile protests
\ (Orwell tells us that he knows that they are futile) and
•plunges into suicide. Winston Smith fails himself and
fails humanity.
Orwell tells us that Winston wants to break the back
; of the oppressive Oceania regime, yet he initiates noth

ing to arrest his oppressor. Winston protests, but at no
times does he really believe that he will make a differ
ence.
Through his tabooed sexual liaison with Julia, a co
worker, he protests. But a protest without a commit
ment to change is very much a waste of energy, or a
redirection of energy. The latter is typified by Orwell in
the government's Hate Week.
During Hate Week citizens were allowed to vent their
frustrations against their enemies — enemies they had
never seen — whom they fought on an unseen battle
front. Daily, during government-certified Hate
Minutes, citizens snarled, hurled insults, and made
faces at the image of a mythical rebel — someone they
had never seen and never heard. The government's
purpose for allocated Hate Minutes was to allow
citizens the opportunity to vent frustrations in a di
rected manner — away from the state towards some
unknown "other."
Typically, Winston Smith redirects his frustration
caused by his oppressive government towards his
sexual relation with Julia — and "triumphs."
At one point the protagonist joins the Brotherhood, a
mythical terrorist, anti-establishment organization that
vows to erupt the bowels of the facist Big Brother. After
joining, Winston pledges his loyalty to the group. His
pledge sounds more like a pledge into the Ku Klux Klan
than into an organization devoted to the liberation of
the human spirit. And even though Orwell's Smith
joins the organization, he wants the organization to
liberate. Orwell's Smith does not want to make any
decisions. He does not want any responsibility. The
great Brotherhood. The Proles. Let those "others," the
noble savages, do it. Even as he joins the Brotherhood,
Winston Smith becomes a mindless slave awaiting "the
place where there is no darkness."
Why such a doomsday? Perhaps Orwell himself did

not understand human compassion. Orwell commits
suicide through his main character Winston Smith. Be
cause Winston Smith lacks compassion, he has no
hope. Because he lacks courage he protests in vain.
In contrast, Orwell gives us Julia — the woman with
no last name, who is Winston's lover. Winston dreams
while Julia acts. Winston hates while Julia loves. Win
ston looks to the Organization, the Brotherhood, the
Proles while Julia lives liberation on a day-to-day basis.
So if a hero must be found, it is Julia — a heroine.
By wearing the mask of a patriotic Oceanian citizen
Julia manages to do just what she pleases, despite Big
Brother. In Julia there is a character that defies fear. Be
cause she refuses to suppress her own sensuality she
finds a way to express it.
Since she exists, Julia assumes there are others like
herself. Moreover, she stakes her life on the belief that
she can find others willing to take risks and enjoy life.
Because she believes in her own sensuality, she
believes in the sensuality of others. Courage quells her
fear and allows her to seek out and identify others who
believe similarly. She awaits no great organization, or
proles, or Brotherhood, to take the first step towards
her liberation.
Her intuition helps her recognize the ideology of the
Brotherhood for what it is, a good lullaby. The Brother
hood's ideology lulls Winston to sleep in the false hope
that some other beings "out there" were taking full re
sponsibility for human liberation while he, Winston,
protests in bed with Julia.
Had Orwell lived longer that 1950, would he have
written his story differently? Perhaps during Orwell's
lifetime he could not predict the liberation of Third
World peoples from colonial powers. Perhaps he could
not predict that their highly motivated youth would
burst into the forefront of world history studying and
mastering science and technology in every major uni
versity throughout the Western world. Orwell did not
foresee Third World people's impact on trade, technol
ogy and eventually world affairs.
If Winston reflects the thought of his creator (Orwell)
he appears weak and hopeless against his own society's
social structure. And if Orwell felt hopeless how could
he anticipate masses of hopeful world citizens? He
could not predict an Indian or China feeding its own
people because he did not feel them capable of this
massive task. He also did not envision them capable of
liberating themselves from European domination. He
projected his own weaknesses and hopelessness upon
the masses of the Third World.
How else could he have ignored the role of non-
Europeans in world history? Was he a product of his
time? Or did he have some mental barrier that systema

tically blocked the possibility that Third World people
would have any role, except a peripheral one, in world
events.
I cannot help but suggest that had Orwell under
stood Afro-American history he would have not so
bleak a story to tell. Perhaps had he taken a course in
Black American literature he would have learned that
others had been there (in bondage) and had arrived in
1984 with compassion, hope and dignity. Somewhere
in the annals of Black American history he would have
come across a spiritual, "Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel,
deliver Daniel, deliver Daniel? Didn't my Lord deliver
Daniel, then why not every man?" You don't have to be
religious to understand that!
If African people with diverse languages, diverse reli
gious practices, diverse kinship systems and diverse
physical characteristics could be forced into slavery in
an unfamiliar land. If they could surmount centuries of
brainwashing and thought control in a society with laws
that reinforced slave status. If these people could call
upon a liberator from outside their own historical expe
rience to assist in their delivery, then why couldn't Or
well's Winston Smith? What made Orwell produce a
Winston who did not believe, did not hope and
struggled in vain?
Can you imagine a year of celebration and reflection
on the triumph of the human spirit? Can you imagine a
year dedicated to the life of Martin Luther King? King
gave us a message of hope and compassion. He in
sisted that humans can do something. The same human
intellect that creates atomic bombs can create methods
to feed the world's hungry.
It is equally possible for an O'Brien to triumph in
crushing millions of Winston Smiths as it is for a Martin
Luther King to inspire millions to participate in liberat
ing themselves. The fascists as well as the civil rights or
ganizers were committed — committed to creating a
different world order. To be human is to choose rather
than to react.
The grass roots organizations of pre-Civil War era,
the civil rights movement, the women's rights move
ment and the nuclear disarmament movement grew
out of the hearts of American people whose minds and
actions are already liberated. People with hope that
they could surmount existing conditions; that the
human spirits can and does triumph. The choice to sub
mit to evil or fight it is what differentiates us. With com
passion comes hope. Without hope, we struggle in
vain.
Orwell doubted. Martin Luther King hoped and
believed. Who would you rather celebrate in 1984?
