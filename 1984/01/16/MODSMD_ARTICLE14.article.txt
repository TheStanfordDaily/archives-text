editorial board members. This is your big chance to get your opinions printed in The
Daily!
•Columnists — Prospective columnists should submit sample columns for consid
eration by the new opinions editors. Columns should be typed, double-spaced
on a 57-character line. Submissions of more than 1000 words will not be ac
