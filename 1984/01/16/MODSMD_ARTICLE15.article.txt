## The 						Yuri-Yuri connection 
### 
It is particularly poignant to me in
this new year to juxtapose the lives
of two Yuris from Russia, both
leaders with enormous world stat
ure and both of whom are in
capacitated, perhaps critically ill,
with kidney diseases.
Attention has recently been
drawn to news from Moscow about
the continuing deterioration of Yuri

Anuiupuv :> ilectini, understood to
be due to diabetic nephropathy. Of
course there is world awareness of
and concern over the outcome of
such a serious condition. In addition
to his personal calamity, as General
Secretary of the Soviet Communist
Party and as President of the
U.S.S.R., Andropov is the chief
spokesperson for his country's
policies and principles. For his deci
sions in this capacity, Andropov will
leave his mark on history.
Less publicized is the concern in
the West over the expected
reimprisonment of Prof. Yuri Orlov,
a brilliant physicist and the founding
chairperson of the Helsinki Watch
Group, an international human
rights movement. Orlov is due to
complete the labor camp portion of
his 12-year sentence on Feb. 10.
These actions present a foreboding
indication of similar reprisals against
other Soviet dissidents on spurious
charges.
In addition to his kidney ailment,
which appears to be pyelonephritis
that has not been adequately
treated, the precarious state of Or
lov's health is further complicated
by "injuries to the skull and brain,"
apparent tuberculosis with
"constant high temperature and
blood-spitting," and "involuntary
spasms" of the arm. Yet, carried for
ward by his indomitable spirit,
against increasing duress, Orlov
continues to practice science.
In a series of six papers, which he

has managed to write over the past
several years and which have at
tracted the attention and admiration
of colleagues in the West, Orlov has
put forth his "wave logic of con
sciousness." This most penetrating
application of quantum physics to
the human mind is a generalization
of the kind of logic used by com
puters. It allows for coding am
biguities, called by Orlov "doubt
states," and provides for the inter
ference of thought processes and
for choice and will functions — the
capacity to make and implement
choice — which has applications to
the creative process and to under
standing the functioning of healthy
and pathological minds. In addition,
Orlov has provided a philosophical
and representational resolution of
the age old "liar paradox."
Assuredly, Orlov will be remem
bered for his devotion to human
rights and for his uncommon contri
bution to science. For these he is
already a powerful symbol to much
of the West. Andropov is in a unique
position to understand Professor
Orlov's condition. This is a rare op
portunity for Andropov to demon
strate, while there is yet time, Soviet
concern for world opinion regard
ing humanitarian issues and scien
tific progress, by ensuring Orlov's
release and, if he wishes, his
emigration.
