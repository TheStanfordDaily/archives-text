### 
The following comments
are excerpts from Martin
Luther King's April 16, 1967,
speech in Memorial
Auditorium.
•"The Negro is facing a de
pression in his everyday life
that is more staggering than
the depression of the
19305."
•"In the North, schools are
more segregated than they
were in 1954. The Negro is
economically worse off. His
unemployment rate was

once about the same as the
white's. Today, his un
employment rate is trice
the white average."
•"Although it may be true
that morality can't be
legislated, behavior can be
regulated. Law may not
change the hearts of men,
but it can and does change
the attitudes of men.
• "We may not have to
repent in this generation
for the violent actions of
bad people but for the inac

tion of good people who
have the . . . notion that
time will cure all evil."
•"It's a cruel thing to ask a
bootless man to pull him
self up by his bootstraps."
•"If we spend $35 billion a
year to fight an ill
conceived war in Vietnam
and $20 billion to put a man
on the moon, we can spend
billions of dollars to put
God's children on their
own two feet, right now."
