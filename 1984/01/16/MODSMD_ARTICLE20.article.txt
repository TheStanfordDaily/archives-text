## Big Game turns into Big Choke for Stanford 
### MARK ZEIGLER Oh well 
That's about all you can say after witnessing Stanford's 66-64
loss to UC-Berkeley Friday night at Maples Pavilion, a game
Basketball Coach Tom Davis and company had to win to have a
realistic shot at a post-season tournament berth.
An over-capacity crowd of 7550 watched Stanford fall apart,
glue itself back together and then fall apart again Friday night.
But more importantly, it was the Cardinal's season that came
apart at the seams against Cal. Stanford — now 11-5 overall, but
0-4 in the competitive Pacific-10 Conference — is staring up a
mountain that even Sir Edmund Hi 11 a ry, the first man to climb
Everest, would hesitate to scale.
Nine of its final 15 games are on the road, including its next
two contests — Thursday at USC and next Monday at Oregon
State. And to have the most outside of outside chances at get
ting an invitation to a post-season tournament, something Stan
ford hasn't done in 42 years, the Cardinal would probably have
to go no worse than 9-6 or 10-5 the rest of the way.
"We will re-evaluate our personnel, our combinations and
who is playing well together," Davis said after the loss to Cal,
now 9-4 overall and 2-1 in conference play.
But what Davis will really have to re-evaluate is his team's play
in the final minute of the game, when Stanford wasted countless
chances to come away with its first Pac-10 victory.
"There were so many opportunities, you could write a
practice plan on the last few moments of the game, on all the
missed opportunities," he said.
Missed opportunities in the late going are nothing new to
Davis and his Cardinal, though. Against No. 15 ranked Oregon
State, Stanford had the ball and the lead twice, only to throw it
away twice and lose the game. Two days later, this time against
Oregon, Stanford coughed it up with 0:20 to go and the game
on the line.
Friday night's version of The Big Choke was only different in
that it lasted longer.
After blowing a 31-21 first-half lead, Stanford found itself be
hind 61-53 with 4:40 to play. The Cardinal then did what is begin
ning to become its trademark, miraculously coming back by
scoring seven straight points, five of them by center John Revel
li, and cut it to 61-60 just over a minute later.
With 1:14 to go, Cal was ahead 66-64, but Stanford had the
ball. Cal center Dave Butler fouled Card forward Earl Koberlein,
who had left the game a few minutes earlier with a bloody cut
over his right eye. Koberlein's first free throw was short and his
second try was long.
Cal gave Stanford another chance with 0:26 left, as guard
Butch Hays, who led the Bears with 21 points, missed the front
end of a one-and-one. Again, Davis and company failed to capi
talize. Guard Keith Jones threw a pass out of bounds that was
intended for Flans Wichary underneath.
But the Bears' gave suicide one more good, old college try.
Revelli fouled Cal's Gordon Anderson with only 13 seconds
remaining and Anderson, usually a steady free throw shooter,
missed the front end of the one-and-one, giving Stanford its
final opportunity to tie the game and send it into overtime.

"We were running a very basic play where lones could tak< a
shot from the top, (Steve) Brown from the (left) side or Revelli in
the middle," Davis explained
Jones started with the ball at the top of the key and, not
having the open shot, passed off to the right side i<> point guard
Keith Ramee, who has made only one field goal in four Pa< tO
games.
Ramee fiddled around with the ball for a few seconds and
then passed it back to lones with about 0:04 left on the < lo< k.
Jones faked the drive and tried to pull up for a 2 Moot despera
tion shot, but slipped and travelled. ( al had the ball and the •
lead with a second to play and Stanford v\,is 0-4 in in the Par 1i'
"You see one of the basic problems of oui ball c lub — back
court leadership," Davis said, referring to the final moments of
the game. "I think that is something we will work on in the up
coming week."
Something else Stanford might work on is stopping th ton i
second-half shooting of its Pac-l(J opponents. For the fourth
straight conference game, the Card's opposition shot better
than 70 percent from the floor in the final period.
Although Stanford outrebounded Cal 15-21, including a I
advantage on the offensive boards, the Bears still manai "d t hit
13-of-18 second-half shots (72 percent) and 24-of-40 for the game
(60 percent). Stanford, meanwhile, was a meager 26-of 55 (47
percent).
But many Cardinal fans did not leave Maples P.tvilion talking
about Stanford's poor field goal or free throw shooting (57 per
cent). Rather, they were questioning Davis' decision not to call
his final time-out with 0:13 to play atter Anderson left the front
end of a one-and-one short.
Another instance when Davis didn't call a time-out when Stan
ford probably could have used one was in the t losing m< -merits
of the first half. Davis and his players watched a 31-21 lead
vanish in the space of 2:47, as Cal scored the final I I points of
the half to take a 32-31 advantage at intermission.
"That probably was the game,' Davis said of the I! point c al
run, "because that took a lot out of our club. We don't cope
with those misfortunes very well.
The Bears, which were consistently able to break Stanford's
full-court press with their backcourt quickness, deployed a full
court press of their own at the end of the first period to key the
turnaround.
"This is a game of momentum," commented Cal Coach Di< k
Kuchen. "Both teams had spurts, but I felt we had the momen
tum in the second halt after our performance just before the
end of the first half."
The Bears picked up in the second half where they left off in
the first, scoring the first four points and extending their scoring
spurt to 15 unanswered points and taking a J6-31 advantage.
The large Maples Pavilion c rowd was never much of a factor
until the second half. Stanford student Eric Abrams, who was
dressed as Zorro and assistant coach Bruce Pearl got the crowd
on its feet during a time-out with 1.: J4 to play
Although Revelli had one ot his best Raines of the s( ason,
scoring a game-high 24 points and grabbing 12 rebounds, Jones


Cal guard Butch Hays slam dunks in the first half of Friday night's basketball game at Maples
Pavilion, which the Bears won 66-64. Hays finished with 21 points and five assists but it was
his quickness that played a key role in the victory, especially in breaking Stanford's full-court
press.
