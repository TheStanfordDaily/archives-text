# Margerum returns to action
## Hoopsters lose two 
### JOHN LIS 
Taking a 2-11 record into Saturday's game
with No. 7 ranked Cal State-Long Beach, the
Stanford women's basketball team seemed
to have no chance against the 49ers. Long
Beach State, after all, had lost only three
games this season, all to teams in the Top
-10. It seemed a classic mismatch.
The Cardinal responded with what Head
Coach Dotty McCrea called "our best, most
consistant effort of the season," staying
with Long Beach for most of the contest
before yielding, 73-62.
Stanford led for much of the first half
before Long Beach took a six-point lead into
the locker room at halftime. Stanford kept it
that close for much of the second half until
Long Beach ran off a spurt late in the game
to seal the verdict.
The Cardinal shut down the 49er running
game for the entire contest and controlled
the tempo throughout. "We're doing what
we have to do defensively," McCrea said,
"and we're setting the tempo we want."
Sophomore center Sarah Evans led Stan
ford with 18 points. Evans has been the Car
dinal's leading offensive threat all year.
Sophomore guard Virginia Sourlis added 15

points, and junior forward Mary Bradach,
still hobbled by an ankle injury, scored 14
points and pulled down 10 rebounds.
Friday, Stanford dropped its WCAA
opener to Cal State-Fullerton, 72-61. Fuller
ton showed the Cardinal a tight, tenacious
man-to-man defense all night, and
succeeded in disrupting the Cardinal's of
fensive flow.
Stanford also suffered from the same
lapses in concentration that has plagued the
Card all season. While Stanford "played all
40 minutes" at Long Beach, at Fulllerton the
Cagers had two stretches that proved fatal.
Evans again led Stanford with 16 points,
and Sourlis added 12. Evans and sophomore
center Judy Carter each had six rebounds.
One bright spot for Stanford was the play
of Lee Ann Margerum. The senior guard suf
fered an ankle injury just before the season
opener and had been handicapped by it for
most of the season. McCrea described Mar
gerum as "back to 100 percent," and she
saw substantial action over the weekend.
Stanford, now 2-12 overall and 0-2 in the
WCAA, will attempt to end its 11-game
losing streak tomorrow night, hosting St.
Mary's in a non-conference contest.
