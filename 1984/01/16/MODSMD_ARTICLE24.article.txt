one of the three spots on the
Olympic team in the luge (a
modified one-person sled) by
placing first in both of her

races in the competition held
at Lake Placid, N.Y. Although
there is one race left, the two
first-place finishes automati
cally qualify her for a spot on
the Olympic team.
The first race was held last
weekend but the race which
clinched the Olympic berth
took place yesterday.
Warner's time of 2:36.321 easi
ly put her on top as she beat
two locals from the Lake Placid

area, Tom Uamigella and Erica
Terwillegar, who took second
and third respectively.

ing goalie on the women's
field hockey team.
