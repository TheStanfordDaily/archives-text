# Navratilova upset
## 
### 
Oakland (AP) â€” Nana Mandlikova, beating Martina Nav
ratilova at her own game, last night ruined the bid by the
world's No. 1 women's tennis player to break one of
sport's most impressive winning streaks.
Mandlikova's masterful 7-6, 3-6, 6-4 triumph in the finals
of the Virginia Slims of California at the Oakland Coliseum
Arena stopped Navratilova an agonizing two victories shy
of Chris Evert Lloyd's 56-match streak set in 1974.
Navratilova's victories included Wimbledon, the U.S.
Open and last month's Australian Open, three of the
jewels in the Grand Slam. She hadn't lost since she was
upset by 16-year-old Kathy Horvath on the clay at the
French Open.
"After awhile people start believing she's not beatable,"
said Mandlikova. "I just tried to put pressure on her. I
knew I could beat her. She had something to lose, not
me."
