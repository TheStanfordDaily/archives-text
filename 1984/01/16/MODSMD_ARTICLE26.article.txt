## 
### PETER CASTILLO 
The Cardinal wrestling team
travelled to Fresno Saturday to
face Boise State and Fresno
State, losing a close decision
to Boise State 26-19 before
being blown away by Fresno
State 39-3. The Cardinal's
record fell to 4-9.
"Though we lost two more
matches, I did not expect us to
win these," said Coach Chris
Horpel. "In the meets our
light weights (below 150 lbs.)
did well, but in our heavier
weights the athletes are just
not experienced enough."
Against Boise State, Mark
Alex (134 pounds) and Scott
Wiggen (142 pounds) won
their matches by pinning their
opponents. Pete Rogers at 150
pounds also posted a victory.
Fresno State was another
story as Stanford could not do
much against the more experi

enced team. Wiggen lost his
match 8-7 and Rogers 4-3. Hor
pel called these loses encour
aging as both wrestlers are
coming off injuries and are
still rusty from the layoff and
lack of wrestling competition.
The bright spot for the Car
dinal was the performance of
Bert Fukunga. Against Boise
State, Fukunga at 118 pounds
won easily 15-4. He won again
8-2 against Fresno State.
"Bert has improved a lot
mentally lately and these
matches show his improve
ment," commented Horpel.
The injury picture for Stan
ford is not encouraging as
heavyweight Ed Katz is out for
the rest of the year. But Flint
Pulskamp (190 pounds), Jeff
Wilson (177 pounds) and Jeff
Bradley (142 pounds) may be
able to compete at San Fran
cisco State Wednesday.
