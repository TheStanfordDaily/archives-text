Come on down
The editor-elect wants to see you. Anyone inter
ested in discussing possible positions, ideas, etc. for
the coming volume should meet with Adam today.
Sign up on the office door. There are still lots of
open spots left from 1 p.m. until 8:30 p.m. and if you
can't make that, from 7 p.m. until whenever on
Wednesday.
