# Housing spaces still available

### DAVE HALE 
The University reports that 32
spaces are still available within the
housing system for undergraduates,
with most located in Crothers, Cro
thers Memorial and Escondido Vil
lage â€” residences that usually
house only graduate students.
"About 20 of these spaces are
available right now, and the others
will open up in the next two to three
weeks," said Roger Whitney, assis
tant of residential education and
director of the housing center.
"They will be available on a first
come, first-serve basis."
The housing center accepted
walk-ins on jan. 11 after housing
spaces were assigned Jan. 6. Seventy
undergraduates showed up to claim
the 50 spaces designated for under
graduates, but only 11 graduate stu
dents appeared to claim the 61

spaces assigned to them.
The unclaimed graduate spaces
were then given over to under
graduates. "We have already met
the expressed need for graduate
housing," Whitney said, adding that
134 undergraduates remain unas
signed.
The construction of Governor's
Corner, which was completed this
year, provided 800 additional spaces
in the housing system, but the con
version of Manzanita Park trailers
from four- to three-person units
caused the loss of about 100 spaces.
In total, the new housing at
Governor's Corner created spaces
for 350 undergraduates and 350
graduates. Vet there was unexpec
tedly strong demand for undergrad
uate housing this year, and so on
campus housing conditions for un
dergraduates are as tight as ever.

Whitney speculated that the
luxurious new Governor's Corner
facilities caused growing interest in
on-campus housing among students
who might otherwise have lived off
campus.
"The new housing appears to
have sparked increased demand for
undergraduate housing," he said.
"We have not seen a proportionate
decrease in demand compared with
the number of units that have been
constructed."
Of those 134 undergraduates who
are still unassigned, only 81 stated
that they would accept placements
anywhere on campus. The other 53
said that they wanted to be placed
only in specific residences.
"Many of those ... on the
waiting list already live on campus
and are shopping for better
housing," Whitney said.
