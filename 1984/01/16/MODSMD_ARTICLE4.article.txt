Democratic candidates debate
Hanover, N.H. — Former Vice President Walter
Mondale and Sen. John Glenn of Ohio accused each
other of talking "gobbledygook" and "baloney"
yesterday, as the first candidates' debate of the
Democratic presidential race turned into a free
swinging verbal brawl.
Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado, making his strongest
pitch of the campaign for a complete turnover of
party leadership, warned the two presumed front
runners that "quarrels between you two are not
going to enable this party to lead and govern again."
The outburst was a face-to-face version of charges
by Glenn that Mondale is offering "secret plans" to
halve the budget deficit and cut defense spending.

Sens. Alan Cranston of California and Ernest Hol
lings of South Carolina and former Gov. Reubin As
kew of Florida joined in the free-form combat,
sometimes turning from the main targets to attack
each other.
Mondale, leading all the early polls, received so
much abuse that toward the end of the unprece
dented, three-hour forum, carried on a national
television network, 1972 Democratic nominee
George McGovern felt called upon to come to his
rescue. McGovern asked his colleagues to resist
"the tendency to clobber the front-runner," adding,
"Sometimes front-runners get nominated."
Jesse Jackson, making his debut in national
presidential politics, differed with the others on
some issues — notably Middle East policy — but
played the role of party unifier. At the height of the
Mondale-Glenn battle, he cautioned, "We
Democrats have to conduct our affairs in a serious
vain."
The cross fire among the Democrats was so sharp
and sustained that, for long stretches, it was almost
as if they had forgotten President Reagan and his
policies.
The eight candidates, who will test their strength
in the Feb.2o lowa caucuses and the Feb. 28 New
Hampshire primary, met on the stage of the Nelson
A. Rockefeller Center in a forum co-sponsored by
Dartmouth College and the House Democratic
Caucus.
Ships shell Lebanese hills
Beirut, Lebanon — The battleship New Jersey and
an American destroyer shelled artillery positions in
the hills east of the capital yesterday after an attack
on U.S. Marines ignited a fuel depot and forced
closure of Beirut airport, a Marine spokesman said.
No Americans were wounded in the fighting, said
Marine Maj. Dennis Brooks.
Brooks said the New Jersey and the Sixth Fleet
destroyer Tattnall fired 5-inch-diameter guns.
Marines on the ground also fired at the positions at
tacking the American base.
"As U.S. forces responded with 81mm mortars,
they were attacked by a heavy concentration of mor
tars and rockets, which damaged a fuel supply depot
of the U.S. contingent of the multinational force,"
Brooks said.
The World War 11-era battleship moved near the
Lebanese coast last September to protect the
Marines.
The naval bombardment was the first since Dec.
18, when the guided-missile cruiser Ticonderoga
and the Tattnall fired at anti-aircraft positions that
had shot at U.S. reconnaissance flights over
Lebanon's central mountains.
The chairman of Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's
national carrier, denied earlier reports that a pas
senger plane at the tarmac had been hit by machine
gun and artillery fire.
The airline chairman, Salim Salam, said in an inter
view broadcast live by Beirut Radio, that heavy
machine-gun fire struck the airport tarmac and run
ways, forcing closure of the facility for about three
hours, but there were no reports of casualties.
Conciliatory Reagan speech today
Washington — President Reagan will propose in
an internationally televised address today that the
United States and the Soviet Union pursue a course
of "credible deterrence and peaceful competition"
that might turn up "areas in which we could engage
in constructive cooperation."
Extracts from the firmly conciliatory speech the
president intends to deliver at 10 a.m. before a
hand-picked audience of dignitaries in the East
Room of the White House were made public by a
senior administration official who discussed the
speech with reporters with the understanding that
he not be quoted by name.
As the official described it, the talk will propose a

controlled thaw in relations between Washington
and Moscow and will argue that the United States is
"in its strongest position in years to establish a con
structive and realistic working relationship with the
Soviet Union."
Reagan will also say that "America's deterrence is
more credible and it is making the world a safer
place, safer because now there is less danger that
the Soviet leadership will underestimate our
strength or question our resolve," the official said.
Another extract relayed by the official said:
"Neither we nor the Soviet Union can wish away the
differences between our two societies and our
philosophies. But we should also remember that we
do have common interests and foremost among
them is to avoid war and reduce the level of arms.
"There is no rational alternative but to steer a
course which I would call credible deterrence and
peaceful competition; and if we do so, we might
find areas in which we could engage in constructive
cooperation."
Salvadoran leftists attack city
San Salvador, El Savador — Leftist guerrillas
launched a heavy mortar attack on the capital of
Chalatenango province in northern El Salvador, but
the army reacted quickly and had the threat under
control before dawn yesterday, military sources
said.
The Defense Ministry press office said rebels at
tacked Chalatenango city at midnight, but the army
was in control by 6 a.m. Army sources in the city said
some fighting continued.
The Army press office said seven soldiers were
killed and 15 were wounded, and preliminary
reports indicated there were heavy rebel casualties.
Chalatenango City, with a population of about
50,000, is about 45 miles north of San Salvador. The
province is a stronghold of the Popular Liberation
Forces, the biggest and most radical of the four
guerrilla organizations locked in a four-year-old civil
war with the conservative, U.S.-backed government.
At midnight, guerrillas began a heavy mortar
barrage on the city's military garrison, a telephone
operator at the barracks said.
He said none of the shells hit the garrison but
many fell nearby.
"If there had not been more troops here when
they attacked, this place would have fallen," the
operator, who asked not to be identified, said.
Americans sighted near crash site
Las Trojes, Honduras — Americans traveling in
helicopters have visited a Nicaraguan-guerrilla supp
ly center at a tobacco farm here three miles from the
Nicaraguan border at least since December, accor
ding to seven local residents and the farm's
caretaker.
The Central Intelligence Agency-financed
Nicaraguan Democratic Force operates the center
eight miles from the spot where a U.S. pilot was
killed when his helicopter was downed by
Nicaraguan troops Wednesday after flying over
Nicaragua and landing just inside Honduras. The
aircraft did not stop at the supply center, according
to residents at the farm's caretaker, but persons they
identified as U.S. personnel are visiting the base.
The residents said most of the visiting personnel,
whom they took to be Americans because of their

appearance, wore civilian clothes, but some wore
uniforms. They arrived at least twice in December
with Honduran soldiers and members of the guerril
la force, the residents said. The local residents said
they assumed the helicopters belonged to the Hon
duran army.
The civilians probably are CIA agents overseeing
the supply operation, diplomatic sources said.
Americans have not been reported previously at the
border in the sensitive area.
Washington has authorized the CIA to funnel $24
million of covert aid in the current fiscal year to the
guerrillas battling the Nicaraguan government.
The U.S. Embassy here routinely refuses to com
ment on intelligence matters.
The U.S. government has said that U.S. military
forces on long-term joint maneuvers in Honduras
are not involved in supporting the Nicaraguan coun
terrevolutionary guerrillas, and U.S. soldiers are un
der orders to stay at least five miles from the border
to avoid incidents. But the caretaker and another
resident reported seeing "gringos" in uniform in
the center.
Reagan may compromise on aid
Washington — The Reagan administration indi
cated yesterday that it might consider "selective
cutoffs" of aid to El Salvador for human-rights viola
tions to find a compromise with Congress on the
controversial issue.
Kenneth W. Dam, deputy secretary of state, said
selective cutoffs are a "possibility," and Henry Kis
singer, who chaired the president's commission on
Central American policy, said aid deliveries could be
slowed in response to human-rights violations. Both
stressed, however, that military and economic aid
should not be conditional solely upon the Sal
vadoran government improving its human-rights
record.
"I think that the one thing we can't be for is an all
or-nothing situation, a kind of situation in which you
have a report card or test, (and) unless you get 100
on the test, you don't get anything at all," Dam said
on "This Week with David Brinkley."
The Kissinger Commission, which delivered its
report to Reagan last week, generally supported the
president's policy of mixing military and economic
aid to defeat leftist forces in Central America. The
commission departed from administration policy,
however, in calling for future aid to be based on El
Salvador's ability to curb rightist "death squads"
and prosecute the murderers.
Diablo protests spark arrests
San Luis Obispo — Police arrested 50 people for
trespassing at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power
plant yesterday following a march by 1000
demonstrators protesting its low-power test licens
ing.
Sheriff's Sgt. John Devine said authorities arrested
42 people who crossed onto Pacific Gas & Electric
Co. property at the plant's main gate and eight
others who snuck onto PG & E property from back
roads earlier in the day.
The afternoon march and arrests culminated an
otherwise low-key weekend of protests that resulted
in seven previous arrests.
Marchers gathered in the community of Avila
Beach for the two-mile walk to the main gate, where

some crossed a blue line marking PG & E property.
Sheriff's officers gave them 10 minutes to dis
perse, then started making arrests.
Devine said it was "absolutely smooth and pleas
ant — they wanted to be arrested and they were very
cooperative."
Those arrested were taken to the San Luis Obispo
County Jail for booking, while the rest of the mar
chers began to disperse.
Missing Gl found
Bonn, West Germany — A U.S. soldier missing for
nearly two days and reported kidnapped was found
apparently unharmed early yesterday in a farmyard
south of Munich, according to West German police.
Spec. 4 Liam Fowler, who serves with the Army's
only Pershing 2 nuclear missile unit based in the
country, was at first believed to have been kid
napped by anti-nuclear protesters, but criminal
police officials said late yesterday that circumstances
surrounding his disappearance remained a mystery.
After questioning Fowler for several hours yester
day police said they were continuing to treat the
case as a kidnapping, but had no clue about who
might have been involved.
"We're just as much in the dark as we were Satur
day; the only difference is we have Fowler back,"
said a police official for the state of Baden-
Wuerttemberg.
Fowler, who reportedly disappeared Friday after
noon, telephoned his wife twice Saturday claiming
he had been taken hostage by a group of four Ger
man men who had jumped into his car after staging a
mock traffic accident on a road near the town of
Schwaebisch-Gmuend, home of his unit, the 56th
Field Artillery Brigade. <
