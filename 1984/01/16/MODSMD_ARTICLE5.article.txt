# University restores Zeta Psi recognition
## 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
I he University restored recognition to the Zeta Psi
fraternity Friday after Norm Robinson, associate dean
of student affairs, accepted the recommendation of a
special Residential Ed-ication committee.
The Zetes will not be allowed to submit a petition for
I niversity housing until January 1985, however. If that
petition is granted, Zete occupancy of a house would
begin in September 1985.
To accept a petition now for housing would mean
your and our having no opportunity to see how well
your new governance system works," Robinson said in
a letter to Zeta Psi president Jeff Scheel.
I he decision came two days after Scheel and others
presented a proposal to the committee that empha
sized improvements current members have made in
the governance of the fraternity.
The Zetes were suspended from University recogni
tion in October 1981 after a party at which a Mills Col
lege woman was pushed into the Zete "pond," a small
cement pool that had been filled with warm water and
was being used as a hot tub.
The committee decided to recognize the fraternity
despite the presentation of a two-page outline of inci
dents involving Zeta Psi members and occurring subse
quent to the suspension. The outline, compiled by
Diana Conklin, director of the Row, reminded the com
mittee that:
•Two Zete pledges were found tied up and left face
down, in their underwear, in a muddy enclosure at the
Stanford stable during a December 1981 hazing inci
dent.
•Cleaning and damage charges totaled more than $5000
after members vacated the Zete house in December
1981.
•Assault and battery charges were levied in November
1982 against a Zeta Psi member after an incident in
which a Rinconada house resident accused three Zetes
of trying to steal a couch.
• Following an April 1982 Zete off-campus rush party, a
freshman living in Branner was left unconscious on his
dormitory lawn by a Zete active. Two other freshmen
reportedly returned to Branner from the party drunk

and belligerent.
• Damages and behavior problems involving six Zetes
living in a Governor's Corner suite last spring resulted
in a 34-page report sent to the Row Office.
• Residence privileges were withdrawn from four Zetes
who, while sharing a trailer in Manzanita Park, amassed
$1200 in cleaning and damage charges.
•A report of rude and physically threatening behavior
by the Zetes at football games this fall was received by
the Row Office.
All of these incidents took place after the Zetes had
been suspended.
Actions of individuals were listed because the Uni
versity, through its policy of collective responsibility,
holds fraternal groups responsible for the actions of
their members.
The recognition comes after more than a year of ef
forts made by members of the fraternity and its alumni
group, the Mu Elder Association. The reinstatement al
lows the fraternity to use once again the name of the
University and to conduct activities on campus, includ
ing rush functions in the spring.
In his letter to Scheel, a copy of which was obtained
by The Daily, Robinson said a Zeta Psi housing position
could not be considered for a year because, "The com
mittee believes that any shorter period would be inade
quate to test the structure's effectiveness during the
various annual events of the fraternity-officer elections,
leadership training, rush, pledging, initiation and so
forth."
Since their suspension, the Zetes have disaffiliated
the older actives involved in the incidents that led to
suspension, and have established a working relation
with the alumni group. The 53 active members have
worked to improve communication with the University
so that their activities are acceptable to the University,
the committee noted.
Scheel and vice president Clark Beyer said in a state
ment that they were happy with the outcome.
"We are pleased with the decision as it brings us one
step closer to our goal of regaining housing privileges
at 353 Campus Drive," the statement said. "This deci
sion gives us the opportunity to plan more activities
and create better communication between members."
