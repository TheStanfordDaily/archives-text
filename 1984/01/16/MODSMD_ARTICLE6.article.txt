# SWOPSI class studies campus research funded by military
## 
### MICHAEL GOFF Staff writer 
Students in a SWOPSI class here have begun to in
vestigate military funding for research at Stanford in a
project that course leader Matt Nicodemus expects will
receive considerable attention in the future.
Nicodemus, a senior here who has been active in
anti-draft registration causes, calls the subject
"incredibly volatile." Although no classified research is
conducted here, the amount of military funding given
to Stanford has quadrupled to nearly $28.5 million in
the last eight years.
The focus of the course, SWOPSI 160, is to gain an
understanding of the nature of this funding and "of
varying perceptions of military research at Stanford,"
Nicodemus says in a course description.
The course is modeled after a 1971 SWOPSI study
that received national attention.
The 1971 class published a report describing the
perspectives of researchers and the military concerning
specific projects. A wide disparity was found. The re
searchers at Stanford felt that their projects had 20
times as many peacetime uses than military ones, while
the military thought the research had only military
uses.
The report even sparked congressional discussion on
whether money had been spent well.
Stanford is currently among the 10 universities re
ceiving the most research money from the Department
of Defense (DoD). According to Nicodemus, the
Computer Science Department gets the most funding
and attention from the military. At present computer
scientists here are working on very high speed integra
ted circuits that have uses in robots and in guided
missiles, he said.
Technical departments aren't the only ones getting
funding. According to Nicodemus, everything from the
School of Education to the Department of Economics to
the Medical School receives money.
Other universities receive large amounts of money
for languages and anthropology, especially in the areas

of Russian and Chinese, he said.
Many other large private and state schools also
receive DoD money. Past and present projects include
research into napalm at Harvard, anti-submarine
warfare and defection at ]ohns Hopkins and the Univer
sity of Washington, and the Stealth system at the Uni
versity of Michigan.
Reasons students give for taking SWOPSII6O are very
different, but all have the common denominator of a
concern about how the military is directly affecting
them.
At least one of the graduate students in the class is
doing military-funded research and there are other
graduates that may have to face a decision of whether
to do military research in the future.
Sophomore Kim Crowley said of her decision to join
the class: "I knew I was against it (military-funded re
search) before. I have come across faculty being
funded by the military, so I have seen it."
Sophomore Eric Doub, who is designing his own
major called "Politics and a technology of unrenewable
energy in a non-nuclear future," said, "I feel an obliga
tion to know what is going on in this high-powered en
vironment."
The group of students will emphasize research tech
niques and collaborative learning. The original re
search will come from conducting interviews and lis
tening to guest speakers, who are scheduled to include
people on both sides of the issue, including some who
have been vocal about it and some who are directly in
volved in the research.
The readings will include an extensive array of arti
cles such as a one-page leaflet entitled, "Is Donald
Kennedy Socially Responsible?", back issues of The
Daily and notes on congressional committee meetings.
Nicodemus, who was responsible for the formation
of the class, says of its members' common goal, "We
want to bring information on what is going on to
people at Stanford and to ourselves. People may get
upset."
