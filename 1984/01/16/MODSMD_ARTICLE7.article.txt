"Central America's crisis is our
crisis/' according to a report issued
Wednesday by the National Bipartisan
Commission on Central America,
headed by former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger.
Citing "the use of Nicaragua as a
base for Soviet and Cuban efforts to
penetrate the rest of the Central
American isthmus, with El Salvador
the target of first opportunity," the
commission called for stepped-up
military aid to the Salvadoran gov
ernment and a five-year, $8 billion
economic aid program for the
region.
"Though the commission believes
that the Sandinista regime will pose
a continuing threat to stability in the
region, we do not advocate a policy
of static containment," the report
said.
"Instead, we recommend, first,
an effort to arrange a comprehen
sive regional settlement," the com
mission said. "This would elaborate
and build upon" the policy objec
tives urged by the Contradora group
of Colombia, Mexico, Panama and
Venezuela.
The commission called the Con
tradoran efforts "constructive in
helping to define issues and to dem
onstrate the commitment of key
Latin American nations to pursue
stability within the region."
But while the report stressed the
importance of diplomatic initiatives
in addressing differences with
Nicaragua's Sandinista regime, it ap
peared to support continued U.S.
military aid to the rebel insurgency.
"As a broad generality, we do not
believe that it would be wise to dis
mantle existing incentives and pres
sures on the Managua regime ex
cept in conjunction with
demonstrable progress on the
negotiating front," the report said.
The foundation of U.S. policy in El
Salvador rests on guaranteed free
elections, the report said. "Thus the
El Salvador government must take
all appropriate measures to make the
March 25 election as safe and open as
possible. This should include the in
troduction of outside observers to
help insure the security and fairness
of the process."
The United States should substan
tially increase military aid to the Sal
vadoran government from the pres
ent level of $65 million, according to
the commission.
"While important U.S. interests
are engaged in El Salvador, and
while we pay a high political price at
home and abroad for assisting the
armed forces there, the United
States has not provided enough mil
itary aid to support the methods of
counterinsurgency we have urged,"
the report said.

"There might be an argument for
doing nothing to help the govern
ment of El Salvador. There might be

an argument for doing a great deal
more. There is, however, no logical
argument for giving some aid but
not enough.
"The worst possible policy is to
provide just enough aid to keep the
war going, but too little to wage it
successfully," the report said. "The
commission has concluded that
present levels of U.S. military assis
tance are inadequate."
An appropriate infusion of mili
tary aid to El Salvador and other
Central American countries should
be tied to "certain minimum stand
ards of respect for human rights,"
the report said. In El Salvador, such
standards include the abolition of
death squads, progress toward free
elections and a "seriously en
forced" judicial system.
"Implementation of this approach
would be greatly facilitated through
the device of an independent moni
toring body, such as the Central
American Development Organiza
tion," the commission said.
"As an additional measure, the
United States should impose sanc
tions, including the denial of visas,
deportation and the investigation of
financial dealings, against foreign
nationals in the United States who
are connected with death-squad ac
tivities in El Salvador or anywhere
else," the commission said.
The report expresses hope that
the United States can "transform
the crisis in Central America into an
opportunity."
"As a region Central America is in
midpassage from the predominately
authoritarian patterns of the past to
what can, with determination, with
help, with luck and with peace,
become the predominantly demo
cratic pluralism of the future," the
report said.
Key sections of the 12-member
commission's 132-page report ap
peared in the Jan. 12 New York
Times.
• ••
Congressional reaction to the Kis
singer report mostly split on party
lines, and while the commission's
recommendations amounted to a
strong endorsement for almost all
the major aspects of the Reagan ad
ministration's Central America
policies, the president suffered at
least one important setback.
The panel's recommendation that
further military aid to El Salvador
"should, through legislation requir
ing periodic reports, be
tingent upon demonstrated prog
ress" on human rights fails to jive
with the current Reagan approach,
according to Hedrick Smith of The
New York Times.

But the panel's rejection of
"power-sharing" negotiations with
leftist guerrillas in El Salvador, indi
rect support of anti-Sandinista insur-

gents, call for free elections and in
sistence that Soviet-Cuban involve
ment in Central America threatens
U.S. interests meshes with the presi
dent's present policies.
On Capitol Hill, the report failed
to trigger an immediate bipartisan
consensus.
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) praised
the report, telling The New York
Times that the commission's work
appropriately demonstrates "an ur
gency that the Sandinista govern
ment does threaten the security of
the Central American neighbors of
Nicaragua and that vital American
interests are threatened."
But presidential aspirant Sen.
Gary Hart (D-Colo.) noted that the
report "failed to recognize that the
enemy in Central America is
poverty, not communism," The
New York Times said. "The report
unwisely emphasizes military aid to
the region rather than political and
diplomatic solutions," Hart said.
In a related development, 32
House Democrats urged the presi
dent to undertake major changes in
U.S. Central American policy, in
cluding an end to covert military ac
tion in Nicaragua, the creation of
new diplomatic initiatives and the
linking of further aid to El Salvador
to human rights certification.

A U.S. Army helicopter pilot was
killed in Honduras during military ex
ercises by hostile fire "from the direc
tion of the Nicaraguan border from a
person or persons unknown," the
Defense Department said Wednes
day.
The four-person OH-58 observa
tion helicopter was forced down on
a Honduran road near the border
during a routine mission, the Pent
agon said, adding that earlier
reports that a U.S.-made helicopter
owned and flown by the Honduran
Air Force had been shot down were
apparently erroneous.
On the ground, the helicopter
came under fire. The Army en*
gineers aboard escaped serious in
jury, but the pilot became the first
U.S. serviceman to die from hostile
fire in Honduras. Two other ser
vicemen have been killed in bul
ldozer and automobile accidents.
Military spokesmen did not imme
diately blame the Sandinista govern
ment for the incident. But by
Thursday the White House had
deemed the killing "intolerable"
and said the U.S. response will
depend on Nicaragua's explanation.
In Managua, Chief of State Daniel
Ortega of the ruling junta chal
lenged Washington's assertion that
Nicaraguan soldiers acted unaccep
tably by firing on the craft, but did
not say whether Nicaraguans had
killed the pilot. Managua claims that
the craft violated Nicaraguan

airspace.
Col. Robert O'Brien, a Pentagon
press officer, said the helicopter was
presumably forced down on the
road from Las Trajes to Cifuentes in
Honduras. Two U.S. journalists
were killed on this road by a land
mine last year, according to The
New York Times. Honduran officials
claimed that Nicaraguans had
crossed the border and placed the
mine.
• ••
The United States and Honduras
will conduct a new set of large-scale
military exercises in June, just three
months after ending the seven
month Big Pine II exercise, the Pent
agon said. The new operation will
probably be similar in scope to the
present exercise of about 5000 U.S.
servicemen.
The future maneuvers in Hon
duras, which like Big Pine II are in
tended partly to apply pressure on
Nicaragua's Sandinista regime, are
still in the planning stage, according
to military spokesmen.
Hundreds of U.S. troops will
remain in Honduras after Big Pine II
officially ends in February until the
next exercise begins, the Pentagon
said, adding that the United States
may seek funds for permanent bases
in Honduras.

• ••
The United States and the Vatican
established full diplomatic relations
Tuesday after a break of 117 years in a
move that appears to reflect Presi
dent Reagan's eagerness to bolster
his administration's standing with
Catholics at home and abroad.
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said Reagan acted at the
"virtually unanimous recommenda
tion of his foreign policy advisers,"
adding that Congress initiated the
action last year by lifting an 1867 ban
on public financing for a U.S.
diplomatic post.
Protestant reaction to the move
was comparatively mild in light of
similar moves in past years, the As
sociated Press said.

Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang said
Friday that Taiwan would enjoy full
autonomy under reunification with
the mainland, adding that the United
States has no role in reunification
talks "because this is China's inter
nal affair." Zhao, speaking through
an interpreter, delivered his
remarks in a San Francisco speech as
part of a U.S. visit.
Zhao joined Gov. George Deuk
mejian and Mayor Dianne Feinstein

in a colorful "Key to the City" cere
mony in the rotunda in City Hall
before attending a state dinner at
the St. Francis Hotel.
About 800 pro-Taiwan demon
strators gathered outside the ho
tel, carrying Taiwanese and Amer
ican flags as well as signs with
messages like "Communists Get
Out of China" and "Chinese People
Need Democracy."
Earlier in the day, the premier
visited the Lawrence Hall of Science
at UC-Berkeley, where he sipped tea
with faculty, visited two elementary
school science classes and was
greeted by a two-foot-tall robot
named RBSX.
Zhao also delivered a 10-minute
address to the California
Roundtable Club, a group of busi
ness leaders from more than 80 of
the state's top corporations.
"In the last few years, growth in
U.S.-Sino trade has been quite im
pressive, but for two large
countries, it is yet too small," he
said. »
