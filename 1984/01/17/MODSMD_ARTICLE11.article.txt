## The 						Stanford Daily The 						Zetes must wait 
### 
It has now been two years since that fateful
night in October of 1981 when two Zeta Psi
pledges allegedly pushed a Mills College wo
man into the Zete "pond." This action was the
latest in a series of incidents which led to
placing the fraternity on Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil "receivership" in 1981.
Subsequent to the pond incident, the Zetes
lost University recognition and were told to
move out of 353 Campus Drive by the end of
the quarter.
In determining whether the Zetes should be
recognized and returned to their house, a spe
cial University committee was asked to answer
the following question: Can the members of
Zeta Psi responsibly govern themselves?
The answer appears to be a qualified
"maybe." Thus we concur with the commit
tee's recommendation to grant the fraternity
recognition while delaying the petition for
housing.
Clearly the Zetes have made strides toward
the responsible conduct of their affairs since
the pond incident. Traditions such as the an
nual scavenger hunt have been modified to
eliminate undesirable behavior. Plans for lead
ership training and effective self-governance
look especially promising.
Still, incidents involving Zete actives con
tinue to surface at the Row Office. During the

last two years this office has received
numerous reports of damages caused by mem
bers of Zeta Psi.
Admittedly, some of these actions, such as
meeting on campus, are relatively minor (and
non-destructive) in nature. But it's still disturb
ing that, in comparison with other fraternities,
a far greater than average number of incidents
were attributed to members of Zeta Psi.
It is for this reason that we agree with Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Norman Robinson's
decision to postpone the Zete housing petition
for an additional year.
The new Zete governance structure and its
addition of a judicial committee, together with
an improved attitude from Zete officers, clearly
warrant fraternity recognition.
But as the committee noted, the University
needs more time to observe the new
structure's effectiveness in action. Recognition
will permit the Zetes to hold meetings, rush ac
tivities and initiation on campus. The Stanford
community will then have an opportunity to
see for itself whether the Zetes have changed
their ways.
Housing, like recognition, is a privilege, and
not a right. The Zetes have shown that they
deserve a chance â€” hence they were granted
the privilege of recognition. Now they have to
prove themselves worthy of housing.
