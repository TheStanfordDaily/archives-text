## Equal rights in University hiring 
### 
The Stanford University Fac
ulty/Staff Directory 1983-84 was
recently distributed throughout the
University. This dissemination
reminded me of an obligation per
sonally imposed over the years: to
comment on the University's efforts
to place people of color and women
in high administrative positions. It is
my view that the true measure of an
organization's affirmative action
program is shown at this level.
The raw data can be taken from
the section on "Administrative Or
ganization" in the Directory, pages
7-9. True to form over the years,
black representation in the non
faculty positions remains signifi
cantly low — less than 2 percent of
approximately 130-plus positions.
Reasons why this statistic remains
low are subject to much debate.
Certain themes, however, intercon
nect most of them and are recur
ring. One theme is that most black
people do not want to play the cor
porate games. One of the common
'y accepted games is the require
ment that racial minorities and wo
men must have mentors (majority
males) if they are to advance and
succeed. Many individuals find this
to be repulsive, in that it is the anti
thesis of efforts to remove all irrele
vant barriers to obtaining employ
ment, advancement and fair salary
setting.

A second theme is stereotyping.
"Will they fit in with us?" is the
question often raised. "Can they
really represent the University in ex
ternal relationships?" "Can they real
ly project the Stanford image?"
Before departing from the Fac
ulty/Staff Directory, a word must be
made about one of the bodies iden
tified therein, the Administrative
Panel on External Affirmative Action.
Stanford is somewhat like the San
Francisco Airport — in a perpetual
state of construction or renovation.
In spite of the University's panel,
one can rarely find a black employee
at anv of the construction or renova
tion sites, and one can assume that
this is also true for all other kinds of
contracts entered into by the Uni
versity for goods and services.
Phrased differently, the University is
financing racism.
One of the prime personnel
events of the last year was the Task
Force on Personnel Policies and Ad
ministration. This effort was of inter
est because it represented a rare op
portunity for the University to make
a useful examination of itself.
Whereas the survey of some 1300
employees was touted to be the
core of the effort, little attention was
actually given to the employees'
responses by the task force in
framing its recommendations. In
stead, the task force was preoc-

cupied with decentralization of em
ployment procedures, something
about which those surveyed were
not questioned, directly or indirect
ly-
Actually, the concerns expressed
by the employees stand to be ag
gravated by decentralization.
Compared to the other topics in the
survey, the University's "problem
solving mechanisms," which should
be key to any survey on personnel
and administration, were essentially
ignored. This might have been
deliberate, in that Employee Rela
tions and Affirmative Action offices
continue to be despised by most
employees, and this is well known
to the administration.
I have never quite understood
what the University had to fear by
treating its employees fair and with
respect, and why University officers
are unable to see what is being lost
in efficiency and morale by the lack
of fairness sensed by so many of its
employees.
The quality of employment and
production at Stanford will not im
prove until such time as all
employees irrespective of race, sex
and age are treated fairly and with
respect.
