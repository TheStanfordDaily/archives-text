Educating the military
In this day and age, the military
has become an inextricable part of
our lives, unless of course one
claims to follow a policy of absolute
pacificism. Assuming the vast
majority of people do recognize the
need and legitimacy of a military in
today's world, the question should
then be asked: What kind of mili
tary?
Here in America, our military has
grown so large in size rhat it is now
a major component of our govern
ment in terms of budget share and
influence on the country's leaders.
Thankfully, nuclear weapons
have not been used again since
their initial deployment in 1945, and
it is obviously debatable whether
this increase in the military's size
and influence is something to
welcome or protest. However,
whether people like it or not, the
military is now in a position to have
a profound effect on many people's
lives. The destructive capabilities of
one nuclear bomb can attest to
that. Consequently, it is in
everybody's best interest to have a
military that has responsible, well
educated, objective and conscien- ,
f/ous leaders. So then, the question i
must now be: How do we develop <
an acceptable military leadership?
The Daily editorial board and
others on campus have asserted
that "military studies" do not
belong in "an academic institu
tion." If we think about the implica
tions of that for a minute, some
contradictions become increasingly
clear.
Assuming everyone wants a re
sponsible military leadership, the
only prescription would be to have
the military's leaders educated at
such academic institutions as Stan
ford. How can we have a respon
sible and trustworthy military if the

leaders are all either uneducated or
"educated" at institutions that are
dubiously labeled "academic" ?
These military leaders are in charge
of (among other things) total
destruction weapons, and as unfor
tunate as those weapons' existence
may be, the facts cannot be
ignored.
A liberal education is forever an
invaluable tool. Why shouldn't
people who are educated at places
like Stanford, who are equipped
with a diversified liberal education,
be included in the military leader
ship? Wouldn't the military be
more responsible and more open
to objectivity? It's scary to think of
our military being organized and
directed by irrational, narrow
minded individuals. In fact, such a
case could turn out to be dis
astrous!
The ROTC students' argument
certainly has good support. It is
both dangerous and expensive to
hurriedly commute between Stan
ford and the various other schools
in the area. Missing classes, as we
all know, is not the best way to
learn the subject at hand. At the
same time, the Faculty Senate's
assertion cannot be disputed, since
nobody will argue that ROTC
classes are as academically demand
ing as the average Stanford class.
In fact, the Facultv Senate's argu
ment is the one responsible for
banning ROTC in the first place,
since the senate insists on oversee
ing and approving material in all of
Stanford's classes. However, in
light of the original conclusion that
outlines the need for a responsible,
well-educated military leadership,
this stance of the senate can only
be seen as most unfortunate. No
ROTC on canpus means fewer
ROTC students, which means fewer
liberally educated officers, and a
less responsible and less

trustworthy military leadership. I
can't think the Faculty Senate wants
that!
As far as The Daily's position is
concerned, it will suffice to say that
students do not see ROTC as a way
to learn the " 'science' of killing
people more efficiently." ROTC
students are hurt and offended by
being associated with such per
verted sensationalism. We (yes, I
am an Air Force ROTC student)
certainly don't plan on forgetting all
the objective skills and values we
have acquired here at Stanford. On
the contrary, we intend to put them
to good use.
The Daily should be commended
for having editorials that usually
aim at trying to change irrational
government policies. However,
"No uniforms, please" missed the
boat concerning whom to kill
"more efficiently." Shouldn't we
try to change irrational policies
instead of the rational ones? As I
have tried to argue, ROTC seems
not only rational but essential in
this day and age.
My purpose in writing this
column is to present an alternative
to the traditional and fashionable
custom of opposing ROTC. Seeing
how all of us want world peace,
shouldn't we ask ourselves: Can we
best establish a lasting and
meaningful peace by rejecting the
military as a legitimate entity or bv
agreeing to recognize and improve
the military as an integral element
of today's society? As a Stanford
student beset by inconveniences
and upset by misperceptions, as
well as a human being faced with
the fact that nuclear weapons are
unfortunately here to stay, I would
hope the answer is "Uniforms,
please."
