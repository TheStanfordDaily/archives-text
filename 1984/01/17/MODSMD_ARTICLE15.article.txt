# Public service: the duty to do what one does best
## 
### 
This )une, some 1500 Stanford stu
dents will experience the terrifying
relief o* leaving school and being
spat out into a world which does not
grade on a curve or give invisible
F's. I will be among them.
As so many of this class begin to
Jicccve cprrptc of interviewing
(real wool, starched cotton,
humility), it is easy to witness the
fears which grip a modern, competi
tive youth: Will I succeed in the
eyes of others? Will I be as com
fortable as I choose? These are
largely concerns of comparative
wealth, and are not new; Alexis de
Tocqueville commented in the 1830s
that he knew of "no country,
indeed, where the love of money
has taken stronger hold in the affec
tions of men . . .
It is against these concerns of a
liberal, consumer society that Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
has launched a crusade of sorts,
reasserting that there is another set
of concerns with a more distin
guished pedigree: an ethic of ser
vice rather than one of personal ac
quisition and acclaim. The case for
such is simple: Life is much more
than influence, acclaim and con
venience; the greatest goods — in
dividual and collective — come from
sacrifices, responsibilities and unre
quited obligations.
Here, though, the audience im
mediately thins. Those who most
need to listen — those entering the
"private" sector whose greatest
gifts lie elsewhere — are with the
first to turn away, offering the
defense that their hard work,
though perhaps done for selfish
gain, will indirectly benefit their
brethren monetarily. Unfortunately,

the modern rebuttal on behalf of
service falters here — after all, that
defense, however hollow, is clearly
true — and so is then reduced to the
"revolving door" idea: "Well, since
life is so much a matter of standard
of living, and we do want people to
be comfortable (and therefore hap
py, no?), and since we do need both
dedicated capitalists and
humanitarians, we will ask only that
you bounce between or juggle si
multaneously these disparate ethics,
the "public" and "private," the
"selfless" and the "selfish." Earn a
while, serve a while.
Such packaging is nice and neat,
but as with all easy modern answers,
it falls short. Business activity is not,
or should not be, simple selfish
ness. If it is reduced to such, the
community loses not only its best
business figures, but also sur
renders its business ethics. Those
who then take to this morally un
restricted "private" sector will tend
to remain on that side of the revolv
ing door, their conduct weakening
the larger social structure.
At the same time, the other
"sector" suffers from what
"revolving" occurs; "professional"
service — e.g., ministerial work,
teaching and scholarship, non-profit
administration, government — is a
vocation, not a vacation, and re
quires years of experience.
As with so many current ills,
there is a better solution, one some
what old, one rather demanding,
and one discarded somewhere be
tween Plymouth Rock and Pet Rock.
In this case it is a piece of Western
ethics at least as old as ancient
Greece: duty. Simply put, various
persons have various talents, some

in, say, commerce, medicine or
labor, yet all are equally necessary
to the whole of society. The demand
made, rather than to switch back
and forth between pursuits, is to do
well one's real job, whatever it is,
because one ought, because it is
one's function and it benefits the
whole and the individual.
Stanford students, one must
hope, are among the more learned
and capable of their generation,
among the persons one hopes will
occupy the most difficult and deli
cate positions in all of our institu

tions, from religious to governmen
tal to commercial. That so many
view such callings as a matter of
choice instead of duty reflects a cul
ture of ridiculous individualism and
collective inassertiveness and ex
plains the poverty of leadership
from which we now suffer in all of
those areas. Comfort, public
opinion and vanity are pitiful
excuses for the neglect of those ac
tivities which one could perform
well to the benefit of one's world,
one's family and truly, oneself.
The timid or selfish among us will

insist, still, that times have some
how changed, and that such social
duty is dead, yet they, as so many
middle-aged Americans today, will
someday discover how much more
than a balance sheet or reputation is
offered by youth and all of life.
Luckily, too, wise parents still
hoist their children to their knee
and say, "Kiddo, when you grow up
and decide what to do, do what
needs doing, what you do well,
what you love. Vou will then do a
good job of it, you will be very hap
py and you will probably be

rewarded well by society, but more
importantly, you will have done
your duty." The children that listen
probably will sit someday across
from smiling recruiters, perhaps
from Chase-Manhattan or the Peace
Corps, yet each of them will be
armed with one of life's greatest
truths: That mere earning in any oc
cupation is just part of the rich par
cel of human service.
