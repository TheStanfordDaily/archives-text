## Berns Aside Adam Berns Stanford's 0-4 in the Pac-10, but don't fold the tent 
### 
There was an air of disappointment
following Stanford's basketball loss to
UC-Berkeley Saturday night. It was not
just another loss, but the Cardinal's
fourth straight Pacific-10 Conference dis
appointment.
Coming off a 1-10 football season, it is
easy to see how a crowd can start to
become cynical. High expectations can
lead to crushing disappointment. The
Stanford fans gave it everything they had
Saturday. They hooted; they hollered;
they stood on ihei r feet the last eight
minutes of the game.
Stanford Coach Tom Davis was asked
after the game how he thought the fans
would react to the Cardinal's fourth
straight conference loss. "We never
promised these fans a lot more than that
we're going to work hard," he said.
"And I'm sure that our student section,

which is the nucleus of our crowd, un
derstands that."
Stanford is not a great team this year.
They are not especially fast or tall. But
the Cardinal is competitive, down to the
very last bruise on forward Andy Fis
cher's body.
"We may have lacked on execution,"
Davis said after the Cal loss, "but I can't
fault the effort."
The players have been hustling, press
ing, running and playing their hearts
out. What they have not been doing is
executing under pressure, making
clutch free throws, and winning the
close games. One word sums up the
problem. Choke.
In defeat, Stanford has not yet known
the words "wipeout," "blowout," or
"crushing defeat." Its four Pac-10 losses
and one non-conference loss have all
been to very good teams. And the games

have been close. A 1 {-point non
conference loss to No. 1 North Carolina,
a five-point loss to then-No. 15 Oregon
State, a one-point loss to Oregon, a five
point loss to then-No. 7 UCLA at Pauley
Pavilion, and a two-point loss to Cal do
not qualify a team as powder puff in the
Pac-10.
But four conference losses by a total of
13 points can be frustating.
One problem facing Davis is the in
creased parity in the Pac-10. Take this
past weekend. Oregon heat UCLA in
Eugene. The Ducks in turn were earlier
beat by Cal by one point. Highly
regarded Washington just barely got by
Arizona by two points. And on it goes. In
sum, just about any team is capable of
beating any other team on any given
night.
"This year the Pac-10 is very strong
from top to bottom so there are no easy

wins," Davis said. "It makes it kind of
frustrating to build a winning team in the
first few years because all of the teams in
the conference have gotten so much
better. But I think that it will really help
in the long-term."
Stanford's confidence-building early
season schedule may have in some ways
been a double-edged sword. While Stan
ford gained confidence and cruised to
some early season blowouts, it did not
gain the experience if may have needed
to compete in its close conference con
tests.
Often the difference between a good
and a great athlete or between a good
and a great team is performance under
pressure. Davis may still be two or three
years away from fielding the kind of
team he wants — a team that will make it

to the NCAA Tournament. But that does
not mean that Stanford basketball won't
be fun.
Like the players, Stanford fans will
have difficulty dealing with the four
straight losses. But giving up is not the
answer. If anything, the last four games
have proved that the Cardinal is compet
itive.
The four conference losses have put a
damper on the Cardinal's post-season
tournament chances. An NCAA bid is
about as probable as bilateral nuclear
disarmament, and an NIT (National Invi
tational Tournament) bid is at best a
long shot. Yet that should not deter the
players or the fans. Stanford basketball
thus far may be frustrating, disappoint
ing and even angering. But it is also fun.
Both the players and the fans should
not forget that.

season schedule may have in some ways
been a double-edged sword. While Stan
ford gained confidence and cruised to
some early season blowouts, it did not
gain the experience if may have needed
to compete in its close conference con
tests.
Often the difference between a good
and a great athlete or between a good
and a great team is performance under
pressure. Davis may still be two or three
years away from fielding the kind of
team he wants — a team that will make it

to the NCAA Tournament. But that does
not mean that Stanford basketball won't
be fun.
Like the players, Stanford fans will
have difficulty dealing with the four
straight losses. But giving up is not the
answer. If anything, the last four games
have proved that the Cardinal is compet
itive.
The four conference losses have put a
damper on the Cardinal's post-season
tournament chances. An NCAA bid is
about as probable as bilateral nuclear
disarmament, and an NIT (National Invi
tational Tournament) bid is at best a
long shot. Yet that should not deter the
players or the fans. Stanford basketball
thus far may be frustrating, disappoint
ing and even angering. But it is also fun.
Both the players and the fans should
not forget that.
