# Executions in U.S. to occur more frequently, experts say
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL 
Despite record numbers on death
row and a recently-released study
conducted by Stanford-associated
researchers that calls into question
the constitutionality of capital
punishment, the number of execu
tions in the United States will prob
ably increase, according to profes
sors here.
Law School Prof. Robert Weisberg
says that more Americans are being
sentenced to death than at any time
in our history. Thirty-eight states al
low death sentences. And 34 of
these states imprison the 1163
people on death row. There are
twice as many people on death row
as there were 10 years ago.
In relative terms, however, the
number of people on death row is
small. If every one of these inmates
were executed, the number of con
victed murderers imprisoned in this
country would decline only about 3
percent.
The trend is toward more execu
tions. From 1977 to 1983, there were
only seven executions, but in the
last few months there have been
three.
Weisberg, figuring the median
age of a death penalty appeal at
around eight years, and considering
the small number of executions in
the last seven years, estimates one

or two executions a month for the
next year.
This comparatively high rate of ex
ecutions will create "a small amount
of unhappiness," said Law School
Prof. John Kaplan, out luw fcrifurce
ment officials "will have to execute
a lot more people before turning the
stomachs of the proponents."
Weisberg says that almost all of
the death sentences involve cases of
aggravated murder. Thus, mur
derers receiving a death sentence
are repeat offenders or criminals
who have committed a felony such
as kidnapping or robbery in con
junction with murder.
The death penalty exists, writes
David Bruck in the Dec. 12 issue of
The New Republic, because "violent
crime undermines the sense of or
der and shared moral values without
which no society could exist. We
punish people who commit such
crimes in order to reaffirm our
standards of right and wrong, and
our belief that life in society can be
orderly and trusting rather than fear
ful and chaotic."
According to Kaplan, the only
other major developed countries
with the death penalty are the Soviet
Union, South Africa and Japan.
Another rationale for the death
penalty is that it deters crime. But,
Weisberg says, the issue is whether
it deters more than a life sentence.

According to Kaplan, "No good
evidence exists that the death
penalty deters murder."
Whether death sentences are
imposed "arbitrarily" or dis-
has been an important
issue since 1972, the year of the
landmark Supreme Court case Fur
man vs. Georgia. As Bruck, in The
New Republic, explains the deci
sion, "if the 1163 convicts now on
death row throughout the United
States had actually been selected by
means of a lottery from the roughly
33,500 inmates now serving sen
tences for murder, most Americans,
whatever their views on capital
punishment as an abstract matter,
would surely be appalled."
Prior to the decision, death sen
tences were issued by juries without
regard to mitigating circumstances
or the defendent's background,
but, in 1976, the death penalty was
reinstated when states reformed
their laws to the satisfaction of the
Supreme Court.
However, a recently-released
study by Law School lecturer Samuel
Gross and Robert Mauro, a graduate
student in psychology, casts doubt
on the constitutionality of the state
laws. Their statistical analysis of
17,000 homicides over a five-year
period in eight states found a con
sistent relationship between the im
position of the death penalty and
the race of the murder victim.
The study shows that murderers
of whites receive the death penalty
more often than murderers of
blacks. Thus, opponents of the
death penalty now argue that im
position of the death penalty is not
as closely tied to the criminal or his
actions as it is to race — the race of
his victim.
The issue is expected to be con
sidered this week in the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in At
lanta. A study by David Baldus of the
University of lowa which is similar to
the Stanford study but focused ex
clusively on Georgia will be pre
sented to the court there.
The ultimate effect this evidence
will have on the constitutionality of

the death penalty remains to be
seen, but Weisberg predicts no
changes. He said, "The mood of the
Supreme Court is 'we have forced
states to try their hardest to come up
with a rational death penalty,' and it
would take the election of (former
Vice President Walter) Mondale and
four instant appointees" to signifi
cantly change the current death
penalty laws.
While this situation may not lead
to more death sentence convictions,
it will make it easier to get those
convictions upheld in appellate
courts, according to Weisberg.

crimes in order to reaffirm our
standards of right and wrong, and
our belief that life in society can be
orderly and trusting rather than fear
ful and chaotic."
According to Kaplan, the only
other major developed countries
with the death penalty are the Soviet
Union, South Africa and Japan.
Another rationale for the death
penalty is that it deters crime. But,
Weisberg says, the issue is whether
it deters more than a life sentence.

According to Kaplan, "No good
evidence exists that the death
penalty deters murder."
Whether death sentences are
imposed "arbitrarily" or dis-
has been an important
issue since 1972, the year of the
landmark Supreme Court case Fur
man vs. Georgia. As Bruck, in The
New Republic, explains the deci
sion, "if the 1163 convicts now on
death row throughout the United
States had actually been selected by
means of a lottery from the roughly
33,500 inmates now serving sen
tences for murder, most Americans,
whatever their views on capital
punishment as an abstract matter,
would surely be appalled."
Prior to the decision, death sen
tences were issued by juries without
regard to mitigating circumstances
or the defendent's background,
but, in 1976, the death penalty was
reinstated when states reformed
their laws to the satisfaction of the
Supreme Court.
However, a recently-released
study by Law School lecturer Samuel
Gross and Robert Mauro, a graduate
student in psychology, casts doubt
on the constitutionality of the state
laws. Their statistical analysis of
17,000 homicides over a five-year
period in eight states found a con
sistent relationship between the im
position of the death penalty and
the race of the murder victim.
The study shows that murderers
of whites receive the death penalty
more often than murderers of
blacks. Thus, opponents of the
death penalty now argue that im
position of the death penalty is not
as closely tied to the criminal or his
actions as it is to race — the race of
his victim.
The issue is expected to be con
sidered this week in the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in At
lanta. A study by David Baldus of the
University of lowa which is similar to
the Stanford study but focused ex
clusively on Georgia will be pre
sented to the court there.
The ultimate effect this evidence
will have on the constitutionality of

the death penalty remains to be
seen, but Weisberg predicts no
changes. He said, "The mood of the
Supreme Court is 'we have forced
states to try their hardest to come up
with a rational death penalty,' and it
would take the election of (former
Vice President Walter) Mondale and
four instant appointees" to signifi
cantly change the current death
penalty laws.
While this situation may not lead
to more death sentence convictions,
it will make it easier to get those
convictions upheld in appellate
courts, according to Weisberg.
Despite record numbers on death
row and a recently-released study
conducted by Stanford-associated
researchers that calls into question
the constitutionality of capital
punishment, the number of execu
tions in the United States will prob
ably increase, according to profes
sors here.
Law School Prof. Robert Weisberg
says that more Americans are being
sentenced to death than at any time
in our history. Thirty-eight states al
low death sentences. And 34 of
these states imprison the 1163
people on death row. There are
twice as many people on death row
as there were 10 years ago.
In relative terms, however, the
number of people on death row is
small. If every one of these inmates
were executed, the number of con
victed murderers imprisoned in this
country would decline only about 3
percent.
The trend is toward more execu
tions. From 1977 to 1983, there were
only seven executions, but in the
last few months there have been
three.
Weisberg, figuring the median
age of a death penalty appeal at
around eight years, and considering
the small number of executions in
the last seven years, estimates one

or two executions a month for the
next year.
This comparatively high rate of ex
ecutions will create "a small amount
of unhappiness," said Law School
Prof. John Kaplan, out luw fcrifurce
ment officials "will have to execute
a lot more people before turning the
stomachs of the proponents."
Weisberg says that almost all of
the death sentences involve cases of
aggravated murder. Thus, mur
derers receiving a death sentence
are repeat offenders or criminals
who have committed a felony such
as kidnapping or robbery in con
junction with murder.
The death penalty exists, writes
David Bruck in the Dec. 12 issue of
The New Republic, because "violent
crime undermines the sense of or
der and shared moral values without
which no society could exist. We
punish people who commit such
crimes in order to reaffirm our
standards of right and wrong, and
our belief that life in society can be
orderly and trusting rather than fear
ful and chaotic."
