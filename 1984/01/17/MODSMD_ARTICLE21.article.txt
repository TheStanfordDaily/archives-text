## 'Silkwood': moving but ambiguous 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Despite her status among
female movie stars — she has
been offered most of the plum
roles for women in the last
two or three years — and her
pair of Oscars, a backlash of
censure has descended on
Meryl Streep lately: More and
more you hear people saying,
"Except for Sophie's Choice, I
don't really like her that
much."
When an actress is as gifted
as Streep is, it may seem un
grateful to demand more than
what she gives out in
Silkwood, i.e., a studied,
beautifully modulated portrait
of a young woman in an Okla
homa nuclear plant who
becomes more and more cer
tain that her employers are
guilty of criminal negligence
in providing for the safety of
their workers. It's a fairly com
pelling, rhythmed perfor
mance, with flashes of humor,
and it isn't much like anything
else she's done; furthermore,
in one sequence — when she
learns that she has absorbed
so much radiation that her
whole house is contaminated
— she does a bravura job of
swinging the entire movie, for
a few minutes, around her
own tension.
But when the movie was
over I still wasn't clear on
Karen Silkwood's motives for

resisting the lulling com
placency even her smartest
co-workers were caught up in,
and I didn't understand her
restlessness or even her
sexual choices. The director,
Mike Nichols, has built in
several silent moments when
the camera is riveted on
Streep and her gorgeous,
ravaged face tells us that she's
deep in thought. But what is
she thinking?
This inadequacy is ag
gravated by our earlier experi
ences with Meryl Streep
(especially in rhe Deer
Hunter), when she conveyed
so much more than the scripts
provided, and by its following
a truly great performance in
Sophie's Choice. Since we
know she can expand and
clarify a character, we have the
right to grow impatient when
she prefers to shroud it in
mystery.
In Silkwood, both Cher
(who plays her best friend,
Dolly) and Kurt Russell (her
live-in boyfriend, Drew) are
more eloquent than she is,
and they don't have to work
so hard for their effects —
they're both such naturals that
you can't help feeling that
they were born in that Okla
homa town, while Streep got
there by dint of admirable dis
cipline and study habits and
the best available acting in

structors.
Based on Come Back to the
5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, jimmy
Dean and her even more
trenchant performance in
Silkwood, in which she plays a
woman who hasn't yet
resigned herself to the impos
sibility of getting what she
wants (Karen as her lover),
Cher's second career is more
likely to reveal the artist in her
than her first. When she sits
alone, smoking in the dark
kitchen of the house she
shares with Karen and Drew,
you don't need a script to tell
you what's on her mind.
Similarly, Kurt Russell,
whose sexually vivid presence
makes him the most affirma
tive force in the picture,
carries Drew's love for Karen,
and his disapproval of her in
creasing commitment to the
union, in the way he walks and
moves his arms. The
screenplay (by Nora Ephron
and Alice Arlen) threatens to
diminish him the way Norma
Rae diminished Beau Bridges,
but Russell won't allow it: He
fills up the screen.
He also has the most in
ventive (and witty) moment in
the film. After walking
through the empty house after
the company, Kerr-McCee,
has torn it apart because of the
radiation readings on it, he
steps outside to find Winston

(Craig Nelson, in another in
triguing supporting perfor
mance), who he suspects
wants to sleep with Karen and
who almost definitely in
formed on her attempts to ga
ther information against the
company for the union. Im
pulsively, he takes a swing at
Winston and knocks him
down; then, suddenly realiz
ing that Winston, a bigger
man, could probablv beat the
hell out of him, he sprints for
his car. Russell's work here is
a special delight to those of us
who admired him in Used Cars
and in the TV movie Elvis and
hope that, having made his
mark in an "important"
feature film, he'll no longer be
referred to as "that Disney ac
tor."
Silkwood does what it sets
out to do, I guess, but most of
the emotional contact it makes
with the audience — the ten
sion it produces — can be
traced to the exceptional cast
(which also includes Fred
Ward, Diana Scarwid, Ron Sil
ver and )osef Sommer) and the
incendiary subject matter. It's
really a bare-bones movie — a
weak entry in the China
Syndrome, the-whole-system
is-corrupt sweepstakes. The
picture lopes along — it could
use trimming and zippier
pacing and editing, as well as a
consistent narrative line.

(We're constantly being told
things about Karen's behavior
that we don't get to see.) But I
think it does want to embrace
Karen Silkwood's cause and
point an accusing finger at her
adversaries.
The filmmakers make a
feeble pass at ambiguity in
presenting the case: We don't
see anyone in power at the
plant actually spiking her
urine sample test tube with
plutonium (her explanation
for the contamination), and of
course we don't see her death
(in a car accident), because no
one knows for sure how it oc
curred. But the scene leading
up to it ends ominously, with
her squinting in the glare of
headlights inching up behind
her.
Actually, the movie's point
of view seems to be more

deeply depressive and
defeatist than that of a
"problem" picture like The
China Syndrome. The first
worker to get "cooked"
(employees' slang for
"contaminated"), middle
aged Thelma (Sudie Bond),
has a child dying in the hospi
tal of cancer. Karen has
children, too, but they're in
the custody of her ex
common-law husband in an
other state. In one early
scene, we see her spending a
few unsatisfying hours with
them before learning —
through his wife, who isn't
supposed to let her in on the
secret — that he's planning to
move his family even farther
away.
This listless, overlong se
quence seems at first to have

been inserted without pur
pose, but when we see Karen
driving home in the rain after
wards with Dolly and Drew,
singing "Amazing grace / How
sweet the sound / That saved a
wretch like me," Mike Nic
hols' scheme becomes
clearer. These people are all
wretches — they have to work
for Kerr-McGee, because Kerr-
McGee owns the whole town
(and even, it seems, the doc
tors in Los Alamos who check
Karen out and tell her, with
transparent dishonesty, that
she's perfectly healthy), and
sooner or later they're bound
to die as a result. But it doesn't
matter anyway, because their
lives aren't worth a damn —
they can't love the people
they want or their kids are
taken away from them. Life
stinks in Silkwood.

mance, with flashes of humor,
and it isn't much like anything
else she's done; furthermore,
in one sequence — when she
learns that she has absorbed
so much radiation that her
whole house is contaminated
— she does a bravura job of
swinging the entire movie, for
a few minutes, around her
own tension.
But when the movie was
over I still wasn't clear on
Karen Silkwood's motives for

resisting the lulling com
placency even her smartest
co-workers were caught up in,
and I didn't understand her
restlessness or even her
sexual choices. The director,
Mike Nichols, has built in
several silent moments when
the camera is riveted on
Streep and her gorgeous,
ravaged face tells us that she's
deep in thought. But what is
she thinking?
This inadequacy is ag
gravated by our earlier experi
ences with Meryl Streep
(especially in rhe Deer
Hunter), when she conveyed
so much more than the scripts
provided, and by its following
a truly great performance in
Sophie's Choice. Since we
know she can expand and
clarify a character, we have the
right to grow impatient when
she prefers to shroud it in
mystery.
In Silkwood, both Cher
(who plays her best friend,
Dolly) and Kurt Russell (her
live-in boyfriend, Drew) are
more eloquent than she is,
and they don't have to work
so hard for their effects —
they're both such naturals that
you can't help feeling that
they were born in that Okla
homa town, while Streep got
there by dint of admirable dis
cipline and study habits and
the best available acting in

structors.
Based on Come Back to the
5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, jimmy
Dean and her even more
trenchant performance in
Silkwood, in which she plays a
woman who hasn't yet
resigned herself to the impos
sibility of getting what she
wants (Karen as her lover),
Cher's second career is more
likely to reveal the artist in her
than her first. When she sits
alone, smoking in the dark
kitchen of the house she
shares with Karen and Drew,
you don't need a script to tell
you what's on her mind.
Similarly, Kurt Russell,
whose sexually vivid presence
makes him the most affirma
tive force in the picture,
carries Drew's love for Karen,
and his disapproval of her in
creasing commitment to the
union, in the way he walks and
moves his arms. The
screenplay (by Nora Ephron
and Alice Arlen) threatens to
diminish him the way Norma
Rae diminished Beau Bridges,
but Russell won't allow it: He
fills up the screen.
He also has the most in
ventive (and witty) moment in
the film. After walking
through the empty house after
the company, Kerr-McCee,
has torn it apart because of the
radiation readings on it, he
steps outside to find Winston

(Craig Nelson, in another in
triguing supporting perfor
mance), who he suspects
wants to sleep with Karen and
who almost definitely in
formed on her attempts to ga
ther information against the
company for the union. Im
pulsively, he takes a swing at
Winston and knocks him
down; then, suddenly realiz
ing that Winston, a bigger
man, could probablv beat the
hell out of him, he sprints for
his car. Russell's work here is
a special delight to those of us
who admired him in Used Cars
and in the TV movie Elvis and
hope that, having made his
mark in an "important"
feature film, he'll no longer be
referred to as "that Disney ac
tor."
Silkwood does what it sets
out to do, I guess, but most of
the emotional contact it makes
with the audience — the ten
sion it produces — can be
traced to the exceptional cast
(which also includes Fred
Ward, Diana Scarwid, Ron Sil
ver and )osef Sommer) and the
incendiary subject matter. It's
really a bare-bones movie — a
weak entry in the China
Syndrome, the-whole-system
is-corrupt sweepstakes. The
picture lopes along — it could
use trimming and zippier
pacing and editing, as well as a
consistent narrative line.

(We're constantly being told
things about Karen's behavior
that we don't get to see.) But I
think it does want to embrace
Karen Silkwood's cause and
point an accusing finger at her
adversaries.
The filmmakers make a
feeble pass at ambiguity in
presenting the case: We don't
see anyone in power at the
plant actually spiking her
urine sample test tube with
plutonium (her explanation
for the contamination), and of
course we don't see her death
(in a car accident), because no
one knows for sure how it oc
curred. But the scene leading
up to it ends ominously, with
her squinting in the glare of
headlights inching up behind
her.
Actually, the movie's point
of view seems to be more

deeply depressive and
defeatist than that of a
"problem" picture like The
China Syndrome. The first
worker to get "cooked"
(employees' slang for
"contaminated"), middle
aged Thelma (Sudie Bond),
has a child dying in the hospi
tal of cancer. Karen has
children, too, but they're in
the custody of her ex
common-law husband in an
other state. In one early
scene, we see her spending a
few unsatisfying hours with
them before learning —
through his wife, who isn't
supposed to let her in on the
secret — that he's planning to
move his family even farther
away.
This listless, overlong se
quence seems at first to have

been inserted without pur
pose, but when we see Karen
driving home in the rain after
wards with Dolly and Drew,
singing "Amazing grace / How
sweet the sound / That saved a
wretch like me," Mike Nic
hols' scheme becomes
clearer. These people are all
wretches — they have to work
for Kerr-McGee, because Kerr-
McGee owns the whole town
(and even, it seems, the doc
tors in Los Alamos who check
Karen out and tell her, with
transparent dishonesty, that
she's perfectly healthy), and
sooner or later they're bound
to die as a result. But it doesn't
matter anyway, because their
lives aren't worth a damn —
they can't love the people
they want or their kids are
taken away from them. Life
stinks in Silkwood.


CONTAMINATED: Meryl Streep, Kurt Russell and Cher star in the story of Karen Silkwood,
who died under suspicious circumstances while trying to expose safety hazards at the
plutonium processing plant where she worked.
Despite her status among
female movie stars — she has
been offered most of the plum
roles for women in the last
two or three years — and her
pair of Oscars, a backlash of
censure has descended on
Meryl Streep lately: More and
more you hear people saying,
"Except for Sophie's Choice, I
don't really like her that
much."
When an actress is as gifted
as Streep is, it may seem un
grateful to demand more than
what she gives out in
Silkwood, i.e., a studied,
beautifully modulated portrait
of a young woman in an Okla
homa nuclear plant who
becomes more and more cer
tain that her employers are
guilty of criminal negligence
in providing for the safety of
their workers. It's a fairly com
pelling, rhythmed perfor
mance, with flashes of humor,
and it isn't much like anything
