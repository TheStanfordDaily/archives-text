# 18-month growth
## Stanford puts $14 million into computer facilities 
### ROBERT BARCKLAY Staff writer 
Between March 1982 and Sept. 1983, Stanford spent
$14 million on the acquisition of computer systems —
an average of $750,000 per month — for academic and
administrative use, according to a preliminary study
released by the University's Information Technology
Services.
I he study, aimed at analyzing the use of computers
in the administrative departments in the University,
also revealed that two-thirds of the total, $9 million,
spent in that 18-month period was used for
decentralized systems "to which access is fairly
restricted," said project leader Linnea Marenco.
Marenco cited departmental computers funded by
special grants as an example of a restricted system.
fhe remaining one-third, $5 million, of the expendi
tures was used for centralized systems such as those
managed by Low Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS) and
the Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social
Sciences (IMSSS).
I he high monthly average was no surprise to those
involved in the study, but Marenco said, " There has
not been a sudden increase in spending on computers
at Stanford."
Marenco said a new trend toward buying microcom
puters became evident in the last several months of the
study, and these smaller computers now account for 45
percent of the systems used on campus.

Possible reasons for the popularity of smaller com
puters, Marenco said, are the lower expense of and
greater control one has over a personal computer.
" One person can be in total control," Marenco ex
plained. "They can work on the computer when they
want to — they don't have to worry about working
during specific hours."
Fhe study also found that there has been a large re
duction in the number of word processors that the Uni
versity is buying, which may account for the increase in
microcomputers.
Chartered by the Administrative Systems Policy and
Planning Croup at Stanford, the study examined com
puter use in the Law School, Personnel Department,
and the Biological Sciences, Political Science and Phi
losophy departments.
Marenco explained that this first study is a prelimi
nary step in preparation for a larger "needs" analysis of
administrative computer use here.
"Exploratory interviews" within several different de
partments revealed that computers are currently ser
ving five basic administrative functions ranging from
finances to faculty assistance.
Marenco said she expects that the study will have a
"signifigant impact" on computer usage at Stanford.
The study has already suggested a number of ways in
which to develop the University's computer systems,
including efforts to coordinate the University's current
mix of systems.
