# Lagunita fills early for sailors
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
There's both some good news
and some bad news about Lake
Lagunita.
The good news is that the lake is
already almost completely filled,
and although the water is cold and a
bit dirty, swimmers, sailboaters and
many others are already using the
facilities.

The bad news is that there is no
guarantee that the water level will
stay this high through spring quar
ter.
According to Joseph Petrucci, that
might not be as bad as it sounds.
Petrucci, who runs the sailing pro
gram and teaches the sport here,
said that despite the lowered water
level, windsurfing, sailing and swim
ming can continue on the lake with

only some inconveniences.
Cheryl Jensen, manager of
utilities systems, said that if, as ex
pected, it rains more this winter, the
University will be able to keep the
lake at least at the nine-foot level
through spring quarter by drawing
water from nearby Felt Lake. Lake
Lagunita is now at approximately 10-
and-a-half feet.
These figures refer to a gauge
near the Boathouse which is marked
to indicate the water level at the
lake's deepest point. Depths vary
throughout the lake and average
depth is lower than this figure.
The lake's problem, Petrucci said,
is that it is losing water through
leakage, and that water is not being
replenished fast enough. Last year,
he said, the water level was so low
that "we're surviving by the skin of
our teeth," and this year could be as
bad.
Lake Lagunita's woes started last
year when heavy winter rains broke
a pipe that carried runoff from
Francisquito Creek to the lake,
which is man-made. This problem
still exists, and Jensen indicated that
little could be done about it because

"we're talking about some fairly
major dollars."
Jensen said the University will
study future repair of the pipe, but
that a solution, besides being ex
pensive, would be difficult and even
then "we couldn't guarantee that
any fix would hold."
Most of the damage to the pipe
occurred because of hillside sliding,
and to cure the problem, extensive
repairs would be needed. "Ever
tried to move a mountain?" quipped
Jensen when asked about the diffi
culty of the project.
According to Jensen, there could
be a problem in keeping the lake
filled to even the nine-foot level, but
this is a worst-case possibility and
would occur only if there was no
more rainfall this winter.
There is hope for Stanford
aquasports. The sailing team has
built a new facility near Redwood
City, and Petrucci said this will pro

vide year-round use for both sailing
classes and competition. If the water
level of Lake Lagunita falls too low in
the future, the Redwood City facility
could be used, at least for sailing,
which is the sport most affected by
low water levels.
Also, unlike Lake Lagunita, the
new facility can be used all year.
The lake's high water level has
helped those charged with main
taining the lake and Boathouse.
Brian Mariscal, manager of the
Boathouse, said, "It's advantageous
that it's filling up this early" because
objects which could impede use of
the lake are floating to the surface
before the weather improves, and
the lake becomes crowded. He can
clear these objects so that they do
not interfere with activity on the
lake.
In addition, Mariscal plans to
paint and repair the Boathouse in
time for spring quarter.
