# Lagunita fills early for sailors
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
There's both some good news
and some bad news about Lake
Lagunita.
The good news is that the lake is
already almost completely filled,
and although the water is cold and a
bit dirty, swimmers, sailboaters and
many others are already using the
facilities.

The bad news is that there is no
guarantee that the water level will
stay this high through spring quar
ter.
According to Joseph Petrucci, that
might not be as bad as it sounds.
Petrucci, who runs the sailing pro
gram and teaches the sport here,
said that despite the lowered water
level, windsurfing, sailing and swim
ming can continue on the lake with

only some inconveniences.
Cheryl Jensen, manager of
utilities systems, said that if, as ex
pected, it rains more this winter, the
University will be able to keep the
lake at least at the nine-foot level
through spring quarter by drawing
water from nearby Felt Lake. Lake
Lagunita is now at approximately 10-
and-a-half feet.
