# History professor lectures on Orwell's English past and '1984'

### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer 
George Orwell's novel "Nineteen Eighty
four" was shaped by the author's relationship
to English society and authority, History Prof.
Peter Stansky told a group of staff members
and students yesterday in Jordan Hall.
Stansky, an English historian who Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy called a
"world-renowned expert on George Orwell,"
said Orwell s English background is essential
to understanding both the author and his
novel, which has received considerable atten
tion in the past few months.
English society was essentially conformist,
Stansky said, a fact which was reinforced by
the exclusive private school system. Yet at the
same time, the schools trained minds to be

ready to question their society.
"The crucial development in Orwell's rela
tion to authority was his being sent away to
prep school," Stansky said, in his lecture
titled, "The Englishness of George Orwell."
At school Orwell learned to be dubious of the
status quo at the same time that he was
imbued with England's traditional values.
Noting that the actual title of the book is
"Nineteen Eighty-four," in words rather than
in numbers, Stansky commented that the
book is being considered not as ordinary
literature, but as a genre of its own.
"The media blitz is absolutely incredible,"
Stansky said. "The book is selling out — it's
hard to get."
Stansky compared Orwell to England's poli
tical mavericks, such as former Prime Minister

Winston Churchill, who sought to transform
society, yet were deeply wedded to England's
traditional institutions.
Orwell believed there must be extraordi
nary transformations in English society. He
was "one of the original anti-communist
socialist left, '' Stansky said. Yet he was deeply
committed to the lasting values of that soci
ety, and his ultimate purpose was to protect
and enrich England.
Orwell's political philosophies were in
fluenced by his term as a policeman in Burma,
Stansky said. He returned to England because
he "couldn't bear to remain part of an im
perialist system," according to Stansky. The
novels he wrote after this period involve char
acters coming to terms with a society in which
they live and of which they don't approve.

Serving on the side of the loyalists in the
Spanish Civil War, Orwell became strongly
opposed to the communists fighting on the
other side. He witnessed their extreme hatred
of their enemies, and the fact that they would
rewrite the past for political purposes — traits
which characterize the imaginary Party in
"Nineteen Eighty-four."
"Homage to Catalonia," a novel which Or
well wrote based on his experience in Spain,
contains warnings about the dangers hover
ing over a free society in a world turning in
creasingly toward totalitarianism.
"Nineteen Eighty-four" reflects his belief in
the danger of totalitarianism of the left and,
by implication, of the right, according to
Stansky. It is a "depiction of a dehumanized
