Reagan urges new talks
Washington — President Reagan, declaring that
1984 is a year of opportunities for peace," chal
lenged the Soviet Union yesterday to revive nuclear
arms control talks and said that fears of war are un
derstandable but mistaken.
In an otherwise conciliatory speech, Reagan
criticized Soviet violations of arms control agree
ments and the Kremlin's handling of human rights
issues. But he stated that as a result of the military
buildup of his first three years in office, "We are
safer now."
Reagan s advisers acknowledged that the speech
was intended to dispel impressions of the president
as warlike in the face of concerns that his political

standing could be damaged in the election year by a
negative image of U.S.-Soviet relations.
The speech was given before an audience of top
government officials and members of Congress and
delivered by satellite in time for European evening
news broadcasts. It opened a busy two-week period
for Reagan. In coming days, he will deliver his State
of the Union address, announce his political plans,
and make two out-of-town trips as his participation
in the 1984 presidential campaign picks up.
"I believe 1984 finds the United States in its
strongest position in years to establish a con
structive and realistic working relationship with the
Soviet Union," the president said.
"The opportunity for progress in arms control
exists; the Soviet leaders should take advantage of
it,"he said.

Meanwhile, a senior administration official,
speaking on the condition that he not be identified
by name, said the president continues to support re
search and development for an anti-ballistic missile
system and that continued funding is needed.
Reagan said the United States' military buildup
may account for the "strident rhetoric from the
Kremlin recently."
These harsh words have led some to speak of
heightened uncertainty and an increased danger of
conflict/' the president said. "This is understan
dable, but profoundly mistaken. Look beyond the
words, and one fact stands out: America's deter
rence is more credible and it is making the world a
safer place; safer because now there is less danger
that the Soviet leadership will underestimate our
strength or question our resolve."

U.S. sees El Salvador progress
Washington — The Reagan administration said
yesterday that the U.S.-backed government of El Sal
vador had made significant progress in controlling
rightist death squads, but a State Department official
said still more action is needed.
"Continued abuse of human rights remains a
central problem, despite efforts to end violence
from the terrorist right as well as the guerrilla left," a
State Department report to Congress said.
"Nevertheless, important progress has been
made on the several fronts related to human rights."
The 57-page paper called the government's four
year-old war with leftist guerrillas "a continued
stalemate" and endorsed a sharp increase in U.S.
military aid.
