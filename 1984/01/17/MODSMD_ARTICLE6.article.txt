Reagan urges new talks
Washington — President Reagan, declaring that
1984 is a year of opportunities for peace," chal
lenged the Soviet Union yesterday to revive nuclear
arms control talks and said that fears of war are un
derstandable but mistaken.
In an otherwise conciliatory speech, Reagan
criticized Soviet violations of arms control agree
ments and the Kremlin's handling of human rights
issues. But he stated that as a result of the military
buildup of his first three years in office, "We are
safer now."
Reagan s advisers acknowledged that the speech
was intended to dispel impressions of the president
as warlike in the face of concerns that his political

standing could be damaged in the election year by a
negative image of U.S.-Soviet relations.
The speech was given before an audience of top
government officials and members of Congress and
delivered by satellite in time for European evening
news broadcasts. It opened a busy two-week period
for Reagan. In coming days, he will deliver his State
of the Union address, announce his political plans,
and make two out-of-town trips as his participation
in the 1984 presidential campaign picks up.
"I believe 1984 finds the United States in its
strongest position in years to establish a con
structive and realistic working relationship with the
Soviet Union," the president said.
"The opportunity for progress in arms control
exists; the Soviet leaders should take advantage of
it,"he said.

Meanwhile, a senior administration official,
speaking on the condition that he not be identified
by name, said the president continues to support re
search and development for an anti-ballistic missile
system and that continued funding is needed.
Reagan said the United States' military buildup
may account for the "strident rhetoric from the
Kremlin recently."
These harsh words have led some to speak of
heightened uncertainty and an increased danger of
conflict/' the president said. "This is understan
dable, but profoundly mistaken. Look beyond the
words, and one fact stands out: America's deter
rence is more credible and it is making the world a
safer place; safer because now there is less danger
that the Soviet leadership will underestimate our
strength or question our resolve."

U.S. sees El Salvador progress
Washington — The Reagan administration said
yesterday that the U.S.-backed government of El Sal
vador had made significant progress in controlling
rightist death squads, but a State Department official
said still more action is needed.
"Continued abuse of human rights remains a
central problem, despite efforts to end violence
from the terrorist right as well as the guerrilla left," a
State Department report to Congress said.
"Nevertheless, important progress has been
made on the several fronts related to human rights."
The 57-page paper called the government's four
year-old war with leftist guerrillas "a continued
stalemate" and endorsed a sharp increase in U.S.
military aid.
The voluntary report replaced a twice-yearly cer
tification of progress on human rights which
Congress had demanded as a condition for contin
ued aid, but which President Reagan vetoed in No
vember.
Even before the report's release the American
Civil Liberties Union and four other human rights
groups disputed its human rights claims.
"Everything remains as it was," charged Aryeh
Neier of Americas Watch, a private monitoring or
ganization. "Terror continues to prevail."
Administration officials have said they will ask
Congress for about $400 million in military aid for El
Salvador over the next 18 months — a fourfold in
crease over current levels.
Last year, Congress approved an initial appropria
tion of $65 million for 1984.
Officials have acknowledged, however, that
Congress is unlikely to approve those massive in
creases unless some signs of progress can be seen
on human rights. Yesterday's report, even though it
was not required by Congress, was an attempt to
meet those concerns, and a State Department offi
cial said additional reports would be made roughly
every six months.
Court approves more oil leases
Washington — California environmentalists lost a
second round yesterday as the Supreme Court said
the Reagan administration can continue selling
leases for offshore oil and gas exploration.
The court, following a major ruling last week,
denied a request by California officials that it
overrule justice William Rehnquist, who allowed the
Interior Department to resume selling off-shore
leases on Dec. 20.
California officials say irreparable harm could be
caused if the sales are allowed. They say oil compan
ies will "expend substantial sums to begin the sus
tained work required to explore and develop these
tracts."
In a 5-to-4 ruling on Jan. 11, the court allowed the
government to sell all leases beyond three miles of
the nation's coasts. It said the government could sell
the leases without determining whether the sales
endanger the environment of California's coastline.
The leases at issue yesterday dealt with sub
merged land further offshore than the tracts that
figured in the court's earlier ruling. The California
attorney general's office tried unsuccessfully to
block the leases pending last week's ruling.
The Interior Department opened bids for the
leases after Rehnquist suspended a lower court or
der halting the sales. It received bids for only eight
of the 137 offshore tracts that were offered. High
bids totaled $16 million.

Included in the offshore area are 12,574 square
miles off the central California coast, from Morro
Bay in San Luis Obispo County to Point Conception
in Santa Barbara County.
The government says the area might yield 230 mil
lion barrels of oil and 220 billion cubic feet of natural
gas to help the nation attain energy independence.
Hispanic caucus drops sanctions
Washington — The Congressional Hispanic
Caucus is preparing to introduce a substitute im
migration reform measure stripped of any sanctions
against employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens,
the Los Angeles Times learned yesterday.
The caucus' bill, to be submitted shortly after
Congress reconvenes next week, would stiffen en
forcement and penalties under existing wage and
hour laws, eliminating the need for workers to file
claims against their employers for mistreatment — a
step an illegal alien would likely avoid for fear of de
tection.
A spokesman for Attorney General William French
Smith, noting that the Carter and Reagan administra
tions had concluded that employer sanctions were
essential to any immigration reform, dismissed the
caucus substitute as unacceptable.
"The attorney general views employer sanctions
as the only credible deterrent that remains,"
spokesman Thomas DeCair said, "but we welcome
their (the caucus') input."
Latino groups have objected to the provision in
the sweeping Simpson-Mazzoli bill which was
passed by the Senate and approved by four House
committees, that calls for fines and prison sentences
for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens. It
might cause employers to discriminate against appli
cants thought to be Latinos, they contend.
The Simpson-Mazzoli bill has been caught in poli
tical crossfire since it was introduced more than two
years ago. Late last year, House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass), said he would prevent the
bill from coming before the House because he
feared that President Reagan would reverse his ini
tial support and veto the bill to curry favor with
Latinos.
O'Neill subsequently said that he would allow the
bill to come up for a vote early this year and asked
Latino House members to submit an alternative that
they would find more acceptable.
Under the caucus proposal, the Department of
Labor could collect up to three times the shortfall in
minimum wages or overtime denied workers in their
paychecks, with the workers having to come for
ward and file a claim. The money would be held in a
special account, and if no one claimed it after three
years, the funds would go to the government.
The caucus proposal also would establish
penalties of $10,000 for employers who did not meet
government standards for keeping records of such
employment data as wages.

Saudis agree on weapons deal
Paris — France has signed the biggest arms deal
in its history with Saudi Arabia in a move likely to
strengthen its political and economic presence in
the Middle East despite some Arab dissatisfaction
with its role in Lebanon.
The French Defense Ministry refused to specify
the exact value of the contract, but it was estimated
by military experts here at between 35 billion and 40
billion francs (between $4.1 billion and $4.7 billion).
The normally reliable Paris newspaper Le Monde
reported that the largest component in the deal was
for the provision of an anti-aircraft defense system
complete with ground-to-air missiles and radar.
In addition to providing a much-needed boost for
France's balance of payments, the deal is politically
welcome in Paris as it suggests that France's Socialist
government still enjoys the confidence of moderate
Arab states such as Saudi Arabia. It confirms a trend
begun in the early 19705, of Riyadh looking to Paris
as a partner to diversify its defense ties away from
the United States.
In recent weeks, Saudi officials have expressed
unease at the expansion last fall of U.S.-Israeli strate
gic and political cooperation aimed partly at offset
ting Syrian influence in Lebanon. Saudi Foreign Min
ister Prince Saud complained recently that "instead
of proving its all-out support for Israel, the United
States should demonstrate that is does not support
Israel regardless of whether it is right or wrong."
Nuclear protesters stay in jail
San Luis Obispo — Most of the 60 protesters ar
rested on property of the Diablo Canyon nuclear
power plant during a weekend demonstration have
chosen to remain in jail rather than go free on their
own recognizance, authorities said yesterday.
The demonstrators were booked for investigation
of trespassing during prolonged anti-nuclear
protests that began Friday. Only 12 of them took au
thorities up on the offer to go free without bail, said
San Luis Obispo County jail clerk Shiela Wolf.
In addition, six never were jailed because they
refused to give their names, said sheriff's Sgt. John
Devine.
"Apparently it was a (Sheriff's Department) policy
decision that if they were John and Jane Does to just
kick them loose," rather than take the time to try
and identify them by fingerprints, Devine said.
Three of those arrested during the peaceful
protests over the weekend were children, who were
turned over the juvenile authorities. The rest
remained in jail in lieu of $675 bail each.
About a dozen showed up at the main gate of
power plant yesterday morning continuing the
protest against the plant's expected low-power test
ing license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commis
sion. Three arrests were made yesterday.
An estimated 1000 to 1500 people marched on

Sunday after lesser demonstrations Saturday,
sheriff's officials said. The Abalone Alliance, the
anti-nuclear group organizing the demonstrations,
promised more protests are ahead.
"This is not going to be over in a few weeks,"
spokeswoman Mary Moore said Sunday. "This is a
longer, extended action as opposed to the larger
dramatic action" of September 1981, when more
than 1900 people were arrested trying to blockade
the $4.3 billion plant 170 miles up the coast from Los
Angeles.
Shultz challenges Soviets
Stockholm, Sweden — Denying that President
Reagan is playing election-year politics with issues of
war and peace, Secretary of State George Shultz yes
terday challenged the Soviet Union to reopen arms
talks and expand its proposal for a ban on chemical
weapons.
Shultz made his comments after flying to Stock
holm for a 35-nation European security conference,
which is to start today. He plans to meet tomorrow
with Foreign Minister Andrei Cromyko of the Soviet
Union for the first time since September.
President Reagan, who has bitterly castigated the
Soviet Union in past speeches, took a conciliatory
tone during a foreign policy speech yesterday.
Shultz denied it was an election-year ploy.
"The president has run for office quite a few times
and he has managed to win," Shultz said. "His
stance has been rather anti-Soviet. I don't think he
needs them in order to win elections."
Shultz challenged the Soviets and their East
European allies to expand their proposal for a ban
on chemical weapons in Europe into a worldwide
pact that can be policed against cheating.
"It's easy enough to say let's have an area free of
something or another," Shultz said. "It's another
thing to carry it out."
Gromyko, speaking to reporters on his arrival,
said the Soviet delegation "will do everything" to
solve the impasse between East and West. But he
said resolution of the differences "depends also on
Sweden and other nations" taking part in the con
ference.

Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slowed to
93.79 million shares from 101.79 million Friday.
