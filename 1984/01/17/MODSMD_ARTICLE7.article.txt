## 'Make friends with your dreams, 'psychologist urges 
### USA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Another boring Western C'-'ture lecture.
You're sitting in the front-row seat, staring
up at the podium, and suddenly the profes
sor turns into a metallic blue dragon, spit
ting fire into the terrified crowd. You hear
the screams, smell the burning notebooks,
cry out for help, and wake up. So does your
roommate.
"What's wrong?"
"I just had the strangest dream ..."
Dreams are a part of everyone's life. The
proportion of dreams remembered varies
from one person to another, but it is gener
ally accepted that dreaming is a universal
phenomenon. Despite our spending a third
of our lives sleeping, and a fair portion of
that time dreaming, dreams are often
misunderstood, misinterpreted or ignored.
Douglas Daher, a staff psychologist at
Stanford's Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), sees dreaming as a useful
tool. He believes they should be used to
help individuals sort through their col
lected thoughts and impressions, or to aid
the psychologist in assessing the state of a
patient's subconscious.
"Until recently, dreams have been a ne
glected area in terms of resea/ch and per
sonal growth," Daher said. "Almost every
other culture uses dreams in some way, ex
cept for Western culture since the time of
Descartes." He explained that Western
thought since Descartes' time has tradition
ally been logic-oriented, concerned with
external rather than internal order, and in
tolerant of symbolism.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
however, the advent of psychology and the
recognition of the subconscious brought
dreaming back into the realm of the scien
tific. Finally, the discovery in 1955 of the
REM sleep period (named after the
sleeper's characteristic Rapid Eye Move
ment) generated an interest in sleep and
dream research that continues today.

Daher said that in modern psychology,
emphasis on dreams varies with the individ
ual psychologist. In his own therapy, he ex
plained, about one-fourth to one-third of
his patients bring their dreams into the of
fice.
"CAPS generally deals with short-term
crisis situations rather than long-term
therapy," Daher said. "Because of this,

dreams aren't usually the most important
part of treatment. I don't usually initiate
looking at dreams with clients, but if they
introduce them, I'm very interested."
According to Daher, however, it isn't
only on the psychologist's couch that we
can learn to benefit from our dreams. If we
"befriend our dreams, they can provide us
with information that our conscious mind
might be ignoring or suppressing," Daher
said.
Daher explained that there are seven
types of dreams. The first, called a "clear"
dream, is precisely that — a dream which
has a very specific message. "For example,
a dream that makes you remember that you

forgot your mother s birthday," he said.
Another, common type of dream is the
survey" dream. "These are dreams that
comment on the previous day's events,"
Daher said. "For example, you might dream
that you finished a conversation that had
been interrupted, or you might dream
about something that you noticed during
the day, such as an unusual sight or event."

There are also "prophetic" dreams,
which are the most widely discussed yet
least commonly occuring of dreams. These
dreams are premonitions of things to come,
such as dreaming of the death of a friend or
relative, or some future event. "These
dreams are really very rare — yet you hear
some pretty impressive stories from
people," Daher said.
"Numanist" dreams, according to Daher,
may only occur once in a person's lifetime,
but they are often vividly remembered.
These are dreams in which the dreamer is
given a sense of a transcendent presence or
force, a sense of the divine or merely super
natural.

Another infrequent type of dream is the
"big" dream, where the dreamer sees his
entire life and understands his place in soci
ety. "This is the equivalent of having your
life flash before your eyes," Daher said.
Finally, there are two additional
categories of dreams, described in the
writings of the psychologist Carl Jung.
Ihere are dreams dealing with the

"personal unconscious," or the thoughts
and experiences peculiar to the individual,
and dreams dealing with the "collective un
conscious," containing the basic ideas per
tinent to all dreamers.
Most people, however, recognize only
two types of dreams —"good" dreams, and
"bad" dreams or nightmares. Accor
ding to Daher, nightmares stem from a vari
ety of causes — they can be physiological,
they can be caused by stress or anxiety, or
they can be induced by suggestion — for
example, watching the movie "Psycho" and
dreaming that your mother attacks you in
the shower.

Although they can be frightening and dis
turbing, nightmares are not necessarily a
sign that something is wrong. According to
Daher, there is really no such thing as a
"good" or "bad" dream. "The more dra
matic the content of the dream, the more
you should pay attention to it, but frighten
ing dreams are not a sign of psychological
disturbance," he said.
Daher said that it is true that disturbed
people often have disturbing dreams, "but
the relationship is not reciprocal," he said.
So, if you have a dream about dissecting
the professor who gave you a 'C' on your
biology exam, you needn't check yourself
into Cowell for examination. There is a dan
ger, however, in interpreting these dreams
yourself, without the advice of someone
trained in analysis.
"The actual analysis of dreams is a
structured process requiring specialized
knowledge, which is best done during
therapy," he said. That doesn't mean that
dreams should only be brought up in
therapy — "befriending" one's dreams by
observing and recording them in a dream
journal, and questioning their meaning, is
something anyone can do.
In order to familiarize students with the
role that dreams play in their lives, Daher
and Greg Salerno, a post-doctoral student
in psychology who also works at CAPS, are
holding a four-session workshop on dream
ing starting Jan. 18. Those interested can
call CAPS before then to register.
Daher said the workshop, held on Wed
nesday nights, will have four parts. "First,
we'll provide a Freudian model of dream
analysis, then a Jungian model," he said.
"Then, I'll provide a sample dream along
with a dream interpretation. Finally, I will
ask students to volunteer their own
dreams."
Daher stressed that students will not be
required to discuss their dreams in the
workshop; those who feel comfortable or
curious about their dreams may volunteer.

"The actual analysis of dreams is a
structured process requiring specialized
knowledge, which is best done during
therapy," he said. That doesn't mean that
dreams should only be brought up in
therapy — "befriending" one's dreams by
observing and recording them in a dream
journal, and questioning their meaning, is
something anyone can do.
In order to familiarize students with the
role that dreams play in their lives, Daher
and Greg Salerno, a post-doctoral student
in psychology who also works at CAPS, are
holding a four-session workshop on dream
ing starting Jan. 18. Those interested can
call CAPS before then to register.
Daher said the workshop, held on Wed
nesday nights, will have four parts. "First,
we'll provide a Freudian model of dream
analysis, then a Jungian model," he said.
"Then, I'll provide a sample dream along
with a dream interpretation. Finally, I will
ask students to volunteer their own
dreams."
Daher stressed that students will not be
required to discuss their dreams in the
workshop; those who feel comfortable or
curious about their dreams may volunteer.

Another boring Western C'-'ture lecture.
You're sitting in the front-row seat, staring
up at the podium, and suddenly the profes
sor turns into a metallic blue dragon, spit
ting fire into the terrified crowd. You hear
the screams, smell the burning notebooks,
cry out for help, and wake up. So does your
roommate.
"What's wrong?"
"I just had the strangest dream ..."
Dreams are a part of everyone's life. The
proportion of dreams remembered varies
from one person to another, but it is gener
ally accepted that dreaming is a universal
phenomenon. Despite our spending a third
of our lives sleeping, and a fair portion of
that time dreaming, dreams are often
misunderstood, misinterpreted or ignored.
Douglas Daher, a staff psychologist at
Stanford's Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), sees dreaming as a useful
tool. He believes they should be used to
help individuals sort through their col
lected thoughts and impressions, or to aid
the psychologist in assessing the state of a
patient's subconscious.
"Until recently, dreams have been a ne
glected area in terms of resea/ch and per
sonal growth," Daher said. "Almost every
other culture uses dreams in some way, ex
cept for Western culture since the time of
Descartes." He explained that Western
thought since Descartes' time has tradition
ally been logic-oriented, concerned with
external rather than internal order, and in
tolerant of symbolism.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
however, the advent of psychology and the
recognition of the subconscious brought
dreaming back into the realm of the scien
tific. Finally, the discovery in 1955 of the
REM sleep period (named after the
sleeper's characteristic Rapid Eye Move
ment) generated an interest in sleep and
dream research that continues today.

Daher said that in modern psychology,
emphasis on dreams varies with the individ
ual psychologist. In his own therapy, he ex
plained, about one-fourth to one-third of
his patients bring their dreams into the of
fice.
"CAPS generally deals with short-term
crisis situations rather than long-term
therapy," Daher said. "Because of this,

dreams aren't usually the most important
part of treatment. I don't usually initiate
looking at dreams with clients, but if they
introduce them, I'm very interested."
According to Daher, however, it isn't
only on the psychologist's couch that we
can learn to benefit from our dreams. If we
"befriend our dreams, they can provide us
with information that our conscious mind
might be ignoring or suppressing," Daher
said.
Daher explained that there are seven
types of dreams. The first, called a "clear"
dream, is precisely that — a dream which
has a very specific message. "For example,
a dream that makes you remember that you

forgot your mother s birthday," he said.
Another, common type of dream is the
survey" dream. "These are dreams that
comment on the previous day's events,"
Daher said. "For example, you might dream
that you finished a conversation that had
been interrupted, or you might dream
about something that you noticed during
the day, such as an unusual sight or event."

There are also "prophetic" dreams,
which are the most widely discussed yet
least commonly occuring of dreams. These
dreams are premonitions of things to come,
such as dreaming of the death of a friend or
relative, or some future event. "These
dreams are really very rare — yet you hear
some pretty impressive stories from
people," Daher said.
"Numanist" dreams, according to Daher,
may only occur once in a person's lifetime,
but they are often vividly remembered.
These are dreams in which the dreamer is
given a sense of a transcendent presence or
force, a sense of the divine or merely super
natural.

Another infrequent type of dream is the
"big" dream, where the dreamer sees his
entire life and understands his place in soci
ety. "This is the equivalent of having your
life flash before your eyes," Daher said.
Finally, there are two additional
categories of dreams, described in the
writings of the psychologist Carl Jung.
Ihere are dreams dealing with the

"personal unconscious," or the thoughts
and experiences peculiar to the individual,
and dreams dealing with the "collective un
conscious," containing the basic ideas per
tinent to all dreamers.
Most people, however, recognize only
two types of dreams —"good" dreams, and
"bad" dreams or nightmares. Accor
ding to Daher, nightmares stem from a vari
ety of causes — they can be physiological,
they can be caused by stress or anxiety, or
they can be induced by suggestion — for
example, watching the movie "Psycho" and
dreaming that your mother attacks you in
the shower.

Although they can be frightening and dis
turbing, nightmares are not necessarily a
sign that something is wrong. According to
Daher, there is really no such thing as a
"good" or "bad" dream. "The more dra
matic the content of the dream, the more
you should pay attention to it, but frighten
ing dreams are not a sign of psychological
disturbance," he said.
Daher said that it is true that disturbed
people often have disturbing dreams, "but
the relationship is not reciprocal," he said.
So, if you have a dream about dissecting
the professor who gave you a 'C' on your
biology exam, you needn't check yourself
into Cowell for examination. There is a dan
ger, however, in interpreting these dreams
yourself, without the advice of someone
trained in analysis.
