# Neurologist discusses split-brain theory
## 
### 
Was Feodor Dostoyevsky a
genius or a neurological burn
out?
Norman Ceschwind, a Har
vard neurologist specializing
in split-brain research, thinks
he may have the answer.
Geschwind, who will speak
at the Medical School
Thursday and Friday, is
renowned for his research of
brain activity. He proposes
that certain mental abilities,
physiological disabilities and
character traits are linked to
right-brain activity.
The brain is split, functional
ly and anatomically, into two
hemispheres, right and left. It
is generally accepted that the
left, dominant side of the
brain controls the body's

motor functions — such as
walking and handwriting,
while the right side of the
brain is responsible for crea
tive and cognitive functions.
According to Geschwind,
however, left-handedness
results from a hormonal im
balance which enhances the
capabilities of the right hemi
sphere of the brain, and
makes the "right brain" domi
nant.
This hormonal imbalance,
he claims, may affect the
immune system, or cause
problems such as autism, dys
lexia or stuttering. However,
the enlarged right brain can
also facilitate mathematical,
musical or literary genius.

Geschwind's somewhat
controversial theories also link
a peculiar form of seizure dis
order with sexual, religious
and literary phenomena usual
ly not felt to have their basis in
the electrical functioning of
the brain.
Among the questions which
Geschwind will address are:
Did Dostoyevsky's literary
genius result from electrical
malfunctions in his brain's
mental 'circuits'? Are religious
visions in reality generated by
a part of the brain known as
the temporal lobe? Why are
monks celibate?
Many of Geschwind's inter
ests will barely be touched
upon in these two lectures. He
has received international at

tention for his neurological
examinations of Soviet dissi
dents imprisoned in
"psychiatric hospitals." His
research encompasses sexual
differences in brain develop
ment as well as previously un
known flexibility in the brain's
response to injury.
If mankind is the proper ob
ject of man's attention, then
Geschwind's attention has
surely been directed properly.
By linking medicine and biol
ogy with literature, religion,
politics, sports and education,
Geschwind has helped us find
the means to answer some of
the most pressing and
perplexing questions of our
time.
