OUT WITH THE OLD
IN WITH THE NEW
It's time to send old columnists and editorial board members out to
pasture and herd in a new pack. If you can type and think, preferably
both at the same time, The Daily wants you for the next volume.
Prospective columnists should submit a timely writing sample of no more than 1000 words for consideration
for a biweekly slot. Columns should be typed on a 57-character line and include author's name, year, major and
phone number.
Students who want to serve as at-large members of the Editorial Board should submit a short written statement,
no more than one page, explaining why you want the position and what edit board should do. Sample columns and
statements are due by Monday, |an. 23 at 5 p.m. in the opinions box at The Stanford Daily, Storke Publications
Building. Across from Terman.
