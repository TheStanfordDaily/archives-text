## The 						Stanford Daily 39 days 'til the primaries 
### 
Despite what you may have heard, the 1984
presidential primary season is not over. In fact,
it does not start tor another month. We find it
frustrating that many voters are already aban
doning their preferred candidates, and thus
limiting their candidate's exposure, with the
distorted view that electability is the overriding
factor at this stage of the game.
The latest evidence of this misperception
was last week's poll released by the Stanford
Nuclear Arms Educational Service, which
found that while 50.2 percent of peace move
ment leaders nationwide saw George
McCovern as the most ideal candidate, only 17
percent recommended voting for him. The
results were the opposite for Democratic
trontrunner Walter Mondale, with 8.9 percent
calling him the most ideal candidate but 41.2
percent recommending a vote for him.
We recognize the peace leaders' rationale.
Not one of the more than 300 groups that
responded named President Reagan as the
most ideal candidate or one to support, and
the peace groups obviously want the most
electable candidate heading the Democratic
ticket. Interestingly, Senator and astronaut
]ohn Glenn was not perceived as a winner in
the poll, with only 3.9 percent recommending
support for him, and zero percent calling him

the most ideal candidate.
The peace leaders' hope of defeating Reagan
will be aided by support for the most electable
Democrat, but the purpose of the primaries is
to find that Democrat, not anoint one
beforehand. The primaries are an opportunity
to hear different perspectives on the issues and
to put the candidates to a test. Sunday's debate
on public television is a prime example. If a
Jesse Jackson, Gary Hart or other candidate is
ignored because of his or her "unelectability,"
then both the American public and Walter
Mondale will miss the chance to hear and
respond to that candidate's views. If some
peace groups want a George McGovern as
president, then they should recommend a vote
for him; the public at large will then get more
of a chance to hear him and decide for them
selves.
Those who think the Democrats need to pick
their nominee immediately to have any hope of
beating Reagan are not only wrong, but they
are cheating the Democratic Party as well as
our democratic process. If an anti-Reagan vote
is their goal, then the time to rally behind the
Democratic nominee would be later this sum
mer in San Francisco, and then right on
through to November. The time is not one
month before New Hampshire.
