"Diversity does not just happen at a place
like Stanford. It is sought out, courted,
treasured. We believe that it is a cornerstone of
the experience you will have here." Pretty
tough words, these, but they are standard fare.
Every recent entering class has been told since
University President Donald Kennedy took of
fice that diversity is the pot of gold on the other
side of the Stanford rainbow.
A recently-released poll of this year's enter
ing class shows, however, that diversity — at
least in one area — is not being achieved. A
total of 65.7 percent of the freshman class said
their parents' combined incomes are more
than $40,000 a year in the poll, which was con
ducted by the American Council on Education
and UCLA. And 19.1 percent estimated their
parental income as more than $100,000.
This is sobering news for those of us who
like to think of American universities as open
centers of education. Given that the average

parental income in the United States is approx
imately $20,000, the study seems to confirm
what many educators have been saying all
along: Private universities exist to make the
rich richer.
The survey also reports that the number of
wealthy students at other private universities is
comparable to the number of the wealthy here.
However, for a school that prides itself on di
versity as much as Stanford does, varied socio
economic class should be "sought out,
courted, treasured" as much as varied inter
ests.
Diversity is lauded here and elsewhere be
cause students learn from being exposed to a
variety of people. And universities are crucial
stepping-stones in helping achieve cultural
pluralism. Therefore, it is lamentable that stu
dents are being exposed to a very narrow range
of people — rich people.
