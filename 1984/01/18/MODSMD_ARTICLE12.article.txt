# Science: the modern God
## 
### 
In modern times, religion has
become much less popular than in
the past. In the 18th century, church
or synagogue attendance was the
norm, and tew people of any reli
gion would admit to doubts about
the existence of Cod. However, in
the 20th century, belief has become
much rarer, and relatively few
people firmly believe in Cod. For
many, this decline in religion has
left something of a void.

lo till this void, many new faiths
have arisen. Even in ancient times,
other gods were worshipped.
Money and power were the two
classic ones. When Catholic priests
sold indulgences for money, they
clearly had more faith in the money
than in their religion. Many people
found power more intoxicating than
religion.
With the coming of the age of rea
son, a whole new set of faiths have
arisen. By faith, I mean a belief that
something is desirable as an end in
itself, to be sought above other
things, for its own sake. Among
these new religions are beliefs in
science, education, countries, laws
and a host of other concepts. This
leads to the question of what the ul
timate goal should be, but perhaps
that is a subject for another column.
An education is a wonderful
thing. However, it can be used for
good or bad. It can be used to help
people or to cheat them. Despite
this, Renaissance thinking held up
education as a virtue, and in many

circles that view prevails today. Even
in some religious circles, a person's
knowledge of religion is considered
a measure of goodness.
Likewise, nationalism for its own
sake is neither necessarily gcod nor
bad. A country is good or bad be
cause of what it does, not because
of what it is. A good country is worth
supporting, a bad one isn't (unless
the alternative is even worse).
A legal system is a wonderful in-

novation. It allows a country to run
smoothly and consistently.
However, a legal system can be
either good or bad. The Nazi legal
system codified wholesale
slaughter. The object of a code of
laws should be justice. When law
becomes an end in itself, it becomes
simply a way for lawyers to get rich.
Far too often, the American legal
system loses sight of its purpose.
Too often, law is pursued for the
sake of law.
Science has also been considered
a modern god. In the 1950s and early
'60s, it was presented as the answer
to all our problems, from poverty to
mental illness. In the '50s, atomic
power was supposed to be so cheap
that we could stop having power
meters. In biology, we were told
that the end of disease was almost in
sight. In short, it almost sounded
like the Messiah was coming.
Now, our view of science has
grown much darker. Science is
blamed for some of our worst prob
lems. Nuc lear power is often viewed
as a looming menace. The waste it

creates is an ever-growing problem.
Instead of the elimination of
diseases, we have new ones to con
sider. Various types of pollution
have left us with a variety of new
neurological disorders and an in
creased cancer rate. Massive use of
pesticides has given us massive
pesticide-resistant bugs. People
have realized that the "wonder
chemicals" of decades past have left
us with a residue of unwonderful
waste for future generations to con
front. In short, science is sometimes
looked at as a modern demon.
However, both attitudes are ex
treme. It is undeniable that science
has given us many wonders: Televi
sion multiplied our horizons,
modern medicine has multiplied
our lifespans and modern farming
methods have multiplied our food
supplies. It has also left us with
DDT, dioxin, and radiation. So sci
ence is not inherently good or bad.
Everything depends on how it is
used. Science can't solve all the
world's problems, but, intelligently
applied, it can help solve some of
them.
