Graduation location
For the first time in more than 40
years, graduation will not be held in
Frost Amphitheater this June. While
the move out of Frost will be a
difficult one, it is also wise as the
increasing participation in gradua
tion makes the use of the small
facility nearly impossible. As a
result, a new commencement site
must be chosen, and this, too, is a
difficult decision.
Two new graduation sites are
under consideration: The Sunken
Diamond and the Stadium. The
senior class has the unique and
unusual opportunity to have a say
in which site the students would
prefer at a class meeting tonight at
7 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
The advantages and disadvantages
of each site will be presented and
President Kennedy will speak.
Students will be given a chance to
voice opinions as well as to fill out a
survey indicating their choice for a
new site.
Seniors, this time you can make a
difference in the outcome of Uni
versity policy and we, as presidents
of the senior class, can not stress
enough the importance of your
attendance at the meeting tonight.
Graduation depends on us —
Stadium or Sunken Diamond — our
input counts.

The world is on fire
"Wake up students, staff and
faculty! The world is on fire. Are we
still able to play, indifferent to this
crisis? Can we ignore the train that
rides down upon us? Time is a
sequence of permanent events,
each a point of integration for all
that will happen thereafter. We
must move — radically and
creatively — if we are not to perish.
Wake up students, staff and
faculty! We stand at the brink of
extinction. We must respond. War
is obsolete, but we seem indifferent
to its continued growth. We stand
in such darkness. Will we not step
into the light?
What can we do, what must we
do, if we are to head off this certain
peril? How are we to act? Those are
certainly relevant questions. To
ignore them will seal our fate. To
embrace them, with the commit
ment to act creatively for life, will
bring about new possibility, the
source of all hope we have.
Consciousness is the life force,
the anti-entropic source of energy,
that we are evolving toward. Aware
ness unlocks the door to conscious
ness in us. But this awareness must
be coupled with the decision to act,
and then the action itself, if we
humans are to be responsive. Indif
ference is the highest form of hate.
Wake up, Stanford students,
faculty and staff! We are rapidly
entering into a new age, the age of
relationship. We are already on our

second chance. Consciousness only
grows in the context of a good
relationship. That is, one which is
pre-committed to do what is right
for life. Without this intention, this
total decision, we shall never dis
cover the "new way" so needed
today.

Sexist headlines
The Daily's sexism is showing.
Since when is it okay to refer to
the Stanford women's basketball
team as "lady hoopsters" ("Lady
hoopsters to start league play
tonight," Jan. 13).
For the record, the term "lady"
carries various degrading connota
tions that have little to do with
playing basketball. . . .

Lighten up
In response to Lesley Jackson's
comment (Daily, Jan. 12) that "the
mascot of any organization is
supposed to represent that particu
lar organization" (the Indian
therefore being an unsuitable
choice as a mascot for Stanford,
considering the lack of any Ameri
can Natives on the football team):
Tell me, how many bulldogs are
currently playing on the University
of Georgia football squad? C'mon,
lighten up! I was only kidding!
