## Women finally break 11 -game losing streak 
### JOHN LIS 
It's finally over.
After nearly two months
without a win, the Stanford
women's basketball team
ended its 11-game losing
streak with a 75-55 non
conference victory over St.
Mary's College last night in
Maples Pavilion.
Stanford Head Coach Dotty
McCrea was not overwhelmed
by the triumph. "I knew it
would come â€” eventually,"
she said.
Sophomore captain Virginia
Sourlis was also controlled.
"It's almost anti-climactic
when you win by this much,"
she said, "but it still feels
good."
junior forward Mary
Bradach and Sourlis both had
18 points to lead the Stanford
attack. Bradach came out
firing in the first half, scoring
14 points before the intermis
sion. She also pulled down
eight rebounds on the eve
ning.
Sourlis was six of 11 from
the field and a perfect six for
six from the line, as the Car
dinal hit 77 percent of its free
throws on the night.
Never trailing, Stanford
opened up a 37-28 lead at
halftime. The Cardinal used a
tough 1-3-1 matchup zone to
virtually shut down St. Mary's
center Anne Cooper. The 6-
foot sophomore, who was
named NAIA District 111 Player
of the Week last week, was
held to six points in the first
half and finished with a below
average 16 for the night.
Two minutes into the
second half, a coast-to-coast
drive by Sourlis gave the Car
dinal a 41-30 lead. St. Mary's
closed it to seven at 49-42 with
8:11 left to play, but then the
Cardinal went to work. Stan
ford ran off nine unanswered
points and held the Gaels
without a field goal for the
next six and a half minutes to
seal the win.
The last two minutes were
perhaps the longest of the
season, as both teams com
mitted a seemingly endless
number of fouls down the
stretch. There were a total of
49 fouls called in the game and
58 free throws awarded.
Stanford had four scorers in

double figures. In addition to
Bradach and Sourlis, sopho
more center Sarah Evans
scored 13 points and freshman
forward Kim Mercer had 10.
Both had eight rebounds.
McCrea said Mercer turned in
"an unbelievable job on the
boards all night."
One of the few pieces of
bad news for Stanford was
senior guard Lee Ann Mar
gerum, who re-injured her left
ankle only two minutes into
the game. Margerum,
however, said she should be
able to play Friday against
UCLA. Freshman Erica Mueser
took over for her and turned
in a solid performance, finish
ing with nine points, including
a seven of eight showing from
the line.
In addition to keeping
Cooper in check all night, the
Cardinal defense succeeded

in shutting down St. Mary's
high-scoring forward Tracy
Britz. The 6-0 sophomore from
perennial powerhouse New
port High School in Bellevue,
Wash., was held to only two
points on the night.
The only difficulty the Stan
ford defense had was stopping
Gael forward Michelle Neely.
The 5-10 junior scored a game
high 21 points, often attacking
the backside of the Cardinal
zone for easy layups. Neely
also pulled down 17
rebounds, converting several
into easy buckets.
The win was Stanford's first
of the season at Maples. The
Cardinal is now 3-12 overall
this season. Stanford has a
pair of WCAA contests this
weekend, hosting UCLA
Friday night before traveling
to USC Saturday to face the
defending national cham
pions.
