# Upset Lewis quits hoop team
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Senior point guard Ricky
Lewis didn't suit up for
Stanford's basketball game
with UC-Berkeley Friday
night. In fact, he won't
wear the Cardinal uniform
again.
Lewis quit the team Sun
day.
But according to lewis,
who has been used
sparingly all season and not
at all recently, he didn't
quit solely because of lim
ited playing time.
"Basically, I'm upset with
the way I've been treated,"
he told The Daily yesterday.
"From day one, he (Head
Coach Tom Davis) was all
over me. From the very first
practice, he's picked on
me. Every mistake I made
seemed to be the end of
the world."
Davis, however, indi
cated that Lewis left the
team because he was
frustrated sitting on the
bench behind point guards
Keith Ramee, a sophor
and John Paye, a freshm.i.
In Stanford's first lb
games, Ramee and Paye
have played in all of them
and logged 371 and 179.5
minutes, respectively.
Lewis has played 96.5
minutes in only 11 games
and scored a total of 17
points. He also has sat on
the bench in three of Stan
ford's four Pacific-10 Con
ference games.
"It was a tough position
he was in being a third
string point guard," Davis
said after practice yester
day."It was a tough situa
tion for him (being a
senior) and I understand
that. We did the best we
could to help him through
it."
A bitter Lewis told a dif
ferent story, though.
"It seemed like they
didn't want me in the pro
gram," he said. "If I didn't
play well and was beaten
out fairly, I would still be
on the team. That's just the
way I am. But I just got fed
up."
Lewis, who transferred to
Stanford as a junior from
Merced Junior College, did
not show up at the Cal
game Friday nrpHfttrrti then
met with Davis the follow

ing Thursday.
"I told him last Thursday
that I didn't want to play
anymore, and he tried to
talk me out of it. But we
talked again Sunday night
and I told him I'd thought
about it and that I still
didn't want to play."
The 6-foot-2, 180-
pounder from San Jose's
Silver Creek High School
said the straw that broke
the camel's back was when
he didn't play Jan. 10
against UCLA after, accor
ding to Lewis, Davis
promised him he would.
Besides missing Friday's
66-64 loss to Cal, which
dropped Stanford to 0-4 in
the Pac-10 and 11-5 overall,
Lewis skipped the Car
dinal's first game against
Hawaii Pacific Nov. 26.
■"A hptore th-e
-season started, we were

having our final scrimmage
before our first game
(against Hawaii Pacific),"
he explained. "I'm having a
good scrimmage and
toward the end of the
scrimmage, he (Davis) calls
me over to the bench.
"I went jogging over to
him and he says, "Is that as
fast as you can run?" and
he tells me to switch my jer
sey and play on the grays."
Davis' gray team is the
equivalent of a football
scout team and acts almost
solely as practice dummies
for the regulars, or the red
team.
Lewis thinks his prob
lems with Davis began last
May, when he told the Card
coach he would be unable
to make the team's June
trip to Japan because he
hud not yft recov&r&cl from
a shoulder operation. Lewis

separated each shoulder
three times last season,
missing a total of 14 games,
and finally underwent sur
gery on both.
"It had only been two
months since surgery, he
said. "So I went and told
Coach Davis that, 'Hey, I
won't be able to practice or
play in Japan.' And he kind
of got upset."
Davis didn't remember it
the same way, though. "I
don't recall being upset
with him. He had some tre
mendous misfortune with
his shoulders last season."
Lewis, who drives a white
Porsche, also mentioned
what he calls the "playboy
incident."
Once at a team meeting,
Davis "said something like,
'We have have some guys
on this team who are
driving fancy cars and
trying to be playboys,' '
Lewis stated.
"First of all, I saved up
and bought the car because
I liked it. And right now,
Stanford (academically) is
too hard to keep up on and
be a playboy at the same
time. There are only 24
hours in a day."
Lewis is the second
player to leave the Stanford
basketball program under
Davis in less than a year, as
forward Johnny Rogers
dropped out of school last
spring.
"From what I could see,"
Lewis said, comparing his
reasons for leaving to
Rogers', "it was similar, but
it could have been for dif
ferent reasons. Johnny was
unhappy here, though."
Lewis also claimed that
Davis encouraged two or
three players to leave the
program after last season.
"He told some players last
spring that they couldn't
play for him and he would
help them transfer."
Asked if any other
players on the team are
presently upset with Davis,
he said, "I think a few of
the players are unhappy,
but I can't speak for them."
Lewis, an economics
major, isn't sure of his
future plans, although he
wiil iinrnh -out tHe scho*)/-
year.

"It was a tough position
he was in being a third
string point guard," Davis
said after practice yester
day."It was a tough situa
tion for him (being a
senior) and I understand
that. We did the best we
could to help him through
it."
A bitter Lewis told a dif
ferent story, though.
"It seemed like they
didn't want me in the pro
gram," he said. "If I didn't
play well and was beaten
out fairly, I would still be
on the team. That's just the
way I am. But I just got fed
up."
Lewis, who transferred to
Stanford as a junior from
Merced Junior College, did
not show up at the Cal
game Friday nrpHfttrrti then
met with Davis the follow

ing Thursday.
"I told him last Thursday
that I didn't want to play
anymore, and he tried to
talk me out of it. But we
talked again Sunday night
and I told him I'd thought
about it and that I still
didn't want to play."
The 6-foot-2, 180-
pounder from San Jose's
Silver Creek High School
said the straw that broke
the camel's back was when
he didn't play Jan. 10
against UCLA after, accor
ding to Lewis, Davis
promised him he would.
Besides missing Friday's
66-64 loss to Cal, which
dropped Stanford to 0-4 in
the Pac-10 and 11-5 overall,
Lewis skipped the Car
dinal's first game against
Hawaii Pacific Nov. 26.
■"A hptore th-e
-season started, we were

having our final scrimmage
before our first game
(against Hawaii Pacific),"
he explained. "I'm having a
good scrimmage and
toward the end of the
scrimmage, he (Davis) calls
me over to the bench.
"I went jogging over to
him and he says, "Is that as
fast as you can run?" and
he tells me to switch my jer
sey and play on the grays."
Davis' gray team is the
equivalent of a football
scout team and acts almost
solely as practice dummies
for the regulars, or the red
team.
Lewis thinks his prob
lems with Davis began last
May, when he told the Card
coach he would be unable
to make the team's June
trip to Japan because he
hud not yft recov&r&cl from
a shoulder operation. Lewis

separated each shoulder
three times last season,
missing a total of 14 games,
and finally underwent sur
gery on both.
"It had only been two
months since surgery, he
said. "So I went and told
Coach Davis that, 'Hey, I
won't be able to practice or
play in Japan.' And he kind
of got upset."
Davis didn't remember it
the same way, though. "I
don't recall being upset
with him. He had some tre
mendous misfortune with
his shoulders last season."
Lewis, who drives a white
Porsche, also mentioned
what he calls the "playboy
incident."
Once at a team meeting,
Davis "said something like,
'We have have some guys
on this team who are
driving fancy cars and
trying to be playboys,' '
Lewis stated.
"First of all, I saved up
and bought the car because
I liked it. And right now,
Stanford (academically) is
too hard to keep up on and
be a playboy at the same
time. There are only 24
hours in a day."
Lewis is the second
player to leave the Stanford
basketball program under
Davis in less than a year, as
forward Johnny Rogers
dropped out of school last
spring.
"From what I could see,"
Lewis said, comparing his
reasons for leaving to
Rogers', "it was similar, but
it could have been for dif
ferent reasons. Johnny was
unhappy here, though."
Lewis also claimed that
Davis encouraged two or
three players to leave the
program after last season.
"He told some players last
spring that they couldn't
play for him and he would
help them transfer."
Asked if any other
players on the team are
presently upset with Davis,
he said, "I think a few of
the players are unhappy,
but I can't speak for them."
Lewis, an economics
major, isn't sure of his
future plans, although he
wiil iinrnh -out tHe scho*)/-

Senior point guard Ricky
Lewis didn't suit up for
Stanford's basketball game
with UC-Berkeley Friday
night. In fact, he won't
wear the Cardinal uniform
again.
Lewis quit the team Sun
day.
But according to lewis,
who has been used
sparingly all season and not
at all recently, he didn't
quit solely because of lim
ited playing time.
"Basically, I'm upset with
the way I've been treated,"
he told The Daily yesterday.
"From day one, he (Head
Coach Tom Davis) was all
over me. From the very first
practice, he's picked on
me. Every mistake I made
seemed to be the end of
the world."
Davis, however, indi
cated that Lewis left the
team because he was
frustrated sitting on the
bench behind point guards
Keith Ramee, a sophor
and John Paye, a freshm.i.
In Stanford's first lb
games, Ramee and Paye
have played in all of them
and logged 371 and 179.5
minutes, respectively.
Lewis has played 96.5
minutes in only 11 games
and scored a total of 17
points. He also has sat on
the bench in three of Stan
ford's four Pacific-10 Con
ference games.
