# Graduation ceremonies will not be held in Frost

Commencement exercises will be held away from
frost Amphitheater this June for the first time in 45
years, and that has roused the ire of a number of this
year's seniors, according to Trish Conroy, senior class
president.
the move — probably to either the Stadium or the
Sunken Diamond — is necessary to accommodate the
growing size of the event, said Nan Bentley, assistant
director of events and services.
Conroy and the three other senior class presidents
will meet today with University President Donald Ken
nedy at a public forum at 7 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium to discuss the options for commencement.
Larry Davidson, director of Events and Services, said it
would be "a primarily informative meeting."
Bentley said that the final decision on where to hold
this year's proceedings will be made by the Administra
tive Council, which is comprised of the president, vice
presidents and deans. She said the Stadium and the
Sunken Diamond are the two sites most seriously un
der consideration, and added that a final decision will
likely be made within two weeks.
No invitation has yet been extended to a speaker for
this year's commencement, according to Marlene
Wine, a special assistant to Kennedy and a member of
the speaker selection committee.
Susan Rasinski, a senior class president who is also a
member of the committee, said writer Robert Penn
Warren had been the panel's first choice.
But Warren, 78, a Rhodes Scholar and three-time

Pulitzer-prize winner whose best-known work is "All
the King's Men, "recently turned down an invitation to
take part in a lecture series here, citing his wife's health
as a reason, according to Wine. She said it appeared
unlikely that he would accept a commencement invita
tion.
An alternate choice might be Douglas Fraser, presi
dent of the United Auto Workers, Rasinski said.
Frost Amphitheater was built in 1937 specifically for
commencement ceremonies and can safely accommo
date 10,000 people, Bentley said.
Before then, commencement was most often held in
Memorial Church. Only once — in 1935, when Herbert
Hoover was the featured speaker — were exercises
held in the Stadium.
"From the feedback I've received, my impression is
that everyone is very sad to move out of Frost," Conroy
said, calling the site "so pretty." She added that it is
also hard to break a tradition which has been around
for so long.
"I don't know anyone who is happy with the move,"
Conroy said.
Davidson said, however, that of the students he had
talked to, most would like to have their entire families
view the ceremonies, even if ii meant moving from
Frost.
Conroy did say that when individuals realize the
practicality of moving from Frost, they are "more ac
cepting" of the decision.
Last year, "at least 17,000 people" crowded into Frost
while others holding tickets were turned away, creating
