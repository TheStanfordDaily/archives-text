# Why change the rules?
## 
### 
Sometimes the NCAA Rules Com
mittee reminds me of the story my
father used to tell about the boun
cer, back when I was a kid tending
bar in Rockaway Beach.
About every third week, if things
were quiet, the bouncer would start
a fight, just so the guy that owned
the place would think we needed
him. It's like that with the Rules
Committee. Sometimes it seems
like they change rules just for the
sake of change.
I've always said, hey, if someth
ing's not broken, don't fix it. We've
got a game that's flying high on two
networks, and whatever cable, or
box office you want to mention. It's
got excitement, thrills, roller
coaster emotion, it shimmers like
the jello when you shake the dish.
So why change it?
This year, the Rules Committee
made two major changes and one
minor one. And then ended up res
cinding one of the major ones, just
four weeks after the season started.
The three were the Jim Valvano
rule, which was later rescinded, the
Patrick Ewing rule, and the Al
McCuire rule. The last two are
okay, but the Valvano rule was dead
wrong from the start. A Dunkirk for
college basketball, that I had
predicted wouldn't be around for
the opening of the 1984-85 season.
I give the Rules Committee credit

for rectifying their mistake so quick
ly. But the point is, it was a mortal
sin to adopt the rule in the first
place.
The Valvano rule called for two
free throws to be awarded for each
common foul committed within the
last two minutes of the second half
and entire overtime periods, if the
bonus rule was in effect. It was an
over-reaction, because last year, in
North Carolina State's Cardiac Run
to the National Championship,
Coach Valvano won six or seven
games by having his players inten
tionally foul opposing teams that
were leading in the last two
minutes, figuring their players
would miss the front half of the
one-and-one.
The reason for this rule was to foil
that strategy, and to take the pres
sure off an official having to call an
intentional foul. But if the inten
tional foul was such great strategy,
then the leading team would be
doing it, too. And hey, it's never
been easy to ref, but the Rules
Committee shouldn't be trying to
do their job. Basketball will always
be a judgment call, a roller coaster,
up-and-down type sport where
things happen in an instant.
Plus, there's something about
that young kid getting up there,
having to make the first shot of a
one-and-one, that puts goose
bumps on your arms. And officials

will always be the enemy in hoops.
It's like the Christians and the lions,
it never changes.
I think the Rules Committee
should meet only every second
year. I believe the Valvano episode
shows we're tampering too quickly
with rules changes. Experiments
should run two years, and only in
one conference.
The Ewing rule is that the T-shirt
must be the same color as the uni
form, and there will be no marking
on the T-shirt. It's called the Patrick
Ewing rule because the last two
years Patrick Ewing wore a T-shirt
with a Nike emblem on the arm.
That's a no-no, so the committee
passed the T-shirt rule.
Lots of players have to wear T
shirts because the material of the
uniform irritates their skin and
creates rashes. But the rule was
passed to stop the wearing of Nike.
It seems inconsistent, because all
the shoe companies have emblems
on their shoes, and if you carried it
out to the end, everybody would
have to play barefoot.
Also, we have a serious problem
interviewing coaches because
they're making like race drivers,
who have caps that say Goodyear
and suits that are walking mar
quees. Lots of coaches now have a
Converse, or Adidas, or Puma T
shirt or sweat jacket on. But that's a
broadcasting problem, nothing

more.
What I'm saying is, I think the in
significant Ewing rule was right, be
cause the pros were getting into
amateur sports by being on the
marquee, that is, the players.
The McCuire rule, I believe, will
stand the test of time. It's someth
ing I've pushed for years, that in all
commercially televised games, the
numbers of timeouts be reduced
from five to three per team during a
regulation g^me.
See, in the past, the normal TV
game had eight to 10 automatic
commercial timeouts on dead balls,
usually occurring at 16, 12, 8 and
four minutes remaining in each
half. So what a coach would do is
wait for a commercial timeout,
rather than take his own. So then he
had five left. So in the last three
minutes of the game, coaches
sometimes could call as many as 10
timeouts, and it would take 30
minutes to play the last three
minutes of the game.
You must remember, if all
timeouts are used in a game,
sometimes you could have 18 to 20
timeouts during a 40-minute col
legiate game. It's like taking a 400-
meter run and making it a marat
hon. It may be great for the guys on
Madison Avenue, but three extra
pantyhose commercials don't make
for good basketball.

more.
What I'm saying is, I think the in
significant Ewing rule was right, be
cause the pros were getting into
amateur sports by being on the
marquee, that is, the players.
The McCuire rule, I believe, will
stand the test of time. It's someth
ing I've pushed for years, that in all
commercially televised games, the
numbers of timeouts be reduced
from five to three per team during a
regulation g^me.
See, in the past, the normal TV
game had eight to 10 automatic
commercial timeouts on dead balls,
usually occurring at 16, 12, 8 and
four minutes remaining in each
half. So what a coach would do is
wait for a commercial timeout,
rather than take his own. So then he
had five left. So in the last three
minutes of the game, coaches
sometimes could call as many as 10
timeouts, and it would take 30
minutes to play the last three
minutes of the game.
You must remember, if all
timeouts are used in a game,
sometimes you could have 18 to 20
timeouts during a 40-minute col
legiate game. It's like taking a 400-
meter run and making it a marat
hon. It may be great for the guys on
Madison Avenue, but three extra
pantyhose commercials don't make
for good basketball.

Sometimes the NCAA Rules Com
mittee reminds me of the story my
father used to tell about the boun
cer, back when I was a kid tending
bar in Rockaway Beach.
About every third week, if things
were quiet, the bouncer would start
a fight, just so the guy that owned
the place would think we needed
him. It's like that with the Rules
Committee. Sometimes it seems
like they change rules just for the
sake of change.
I've always said, hey, if someth
ing's not broken, don't fix it. We've
got a game that's flying high on two
networks, and whatever cable, or
box office you want to mention. It's
got excitement, thrills, roller
coaster emotion, it shimmers like
the jello when you shake the dish.
So why change it?
This year, the Rules Committee
made two major changes and one
minor one. And then ended up res
cinding one of the major ones, just
four weeks after the season started.
The three were the Jim Valvano
rule, which was later rescinded, the
Patrick Ewing rule, and the Al
McCuire rule. The last two are
okay, but the Valvano rule was dead
wrong from the start. A Dunkirk for
college basketball, that I had
predicted wouldn't be around for
the opening of the 1984-85 season.
I give the Rules Committee credit

for rectifying their mistake so quick
ly. But the point is, it was a mortal
sin to adopt the rule in the first
place.
The Valvano rule called for two
free throws to be awarded for each
common foul committed within the
last two minutes of the second half
and entire overtime periods, if the
bonus rule was in effect. It was an
over-reaction, because last year, in
North Carolina State's Cardiac Run
to the National Championship,
Coach Valvano won six or seven
games by having his players inten
tionally foul opposing teams that
were leading in the last two
minutes, figuring their players
would miss the front half of the
one-and-one.
The reason for this rule was to foil
that strategy, and to take the pres
sure off an official having to call an
intentional foul. But if the inten
tional foul was such great strategy,
then the leading team would be
doing it, too. And hey, it's never
been easy to ref, but the Rules
Committee shouldn't be trying to
do their job. Basketball will always
be a judgment call, a roller coaster,
up-and-down type sport where
things happen in an instant.
Plus, there's something about
that young kid getting up there,
having to make the first shot of a
one-and-one, that puts goose
bumps on your arms. And officials

will always be the enemy in hoops.
It's like the Christians and the lions,
it never changes.
I think the Rules Committee
should meet only every second
year. I believe the Valvano episode
shows we're tampering too quickly
with rules changes. Experiments
should run two years, and only in
one conference.
The Ewing rule is that the T-shirt
must be the same color as the uni
form, and there will be no marking
on the T-shirt. It's called the Patrick
Ewing rule because the last two
years Patrick Ewing wore a T-shirt
with a Nike emblem on the arm.
That's a no-no, so the committee
passed the T-shirt rule.
Lots of players have to wear T
shirts because the material of the
uniform irritates their skin and
creates rashes. But the rule was
passed to stop the wearing of Nike.
It seems inconsistent, because all
the shoe companies have emblems
on their shoes, and if you carried it
out to the end, everybody would
have to play barefoot.
Also, we have a serious problem
interviewing coaches because
they're making like race drivers,
who have caps that say Goodyear
and suits that are walking mar
quees. Lots of coaches now have a
Converse, or Adidas, or Puma T
shirt or sweat jacket on. But that's a
broadcasting problem, nothing

more.
