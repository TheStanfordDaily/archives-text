## Kassulke: a wrestler and more 
### BETH KLEID 
Freshman wrestler Kurt
Kassulke's talents spread
over many keys. When Kas
sulke isn't busy pinning his
opponent to the mat, he
spends his time playing the
piano, composing songs,
singing, writing poetry or
rock climbing.
In fact, the freshman
plays the piano as a way to
relax himself before a wres
tling match. "I even found
a piano to play when we
were away at the Oregon
State Tournament over
Christmas break." he said.
As a the No. 2 wrestler to
come out of Minnesota last
year, Kassulke is a for
midable force as a wrestler,
but the songs that he
composes show another
side of his personality.
"I like to write soft
stuff," he said. "I write
when I'm depressed, con
cerned about something or
in a happy mood. I like mel
low music."
The 190-pounder is
definitely not a pussycat
when it comes to wrestling.

In high school he was All-
Conference three years in a
row, and his record during
his senior year was 31-2. As
one of two freshmen to join
the wrestling team here this
year, Kassulke shows great
promise.
"I still have a lot to learn,
though. I am learning from
both the competition and
the coaches," he said.
"Everybody on the team is
trying to help me —
everybody is just working
together to make the team
better."
Kassulke is pleased with
the wrestling program on
the Farm, and he feels well
received as a new team
member. "I feel com
fortable on the team, which
is made up of mostly sop
homores and juniors. We
are a young team with a lot
of talent. We just need time
to get more experience."
He is also satisfied with
the team's coaches. Head
Coach Chris Horpel was a
former Stanford wrestler
who took fifth place in the
NCAAs, assistant coach

Dave Shultz was a world
champion, and his brother
Mark Shultz was a three
time NCAA champion.
"The coaches are so
good that just by wrestling
them during practice you
have to get better."
The freshman started his
wresting career in the third
grade at his elementary
school in Shakopee, Minn.
Kassulke was not a particu
larly coordinated athlete. "I
had trouble with things like
bouncing a basketball," he
said.
But even in third grade
Kassulke was big, and wres
tling seemed a to be a good
sport for him. "I was a
heavyweight then, and a lot
of times I would win tour
naments because there was
no one there to compete
against. There weren't too
many heavyweights in third
grade."
Kassulke said that wres
tling was something athlet
ic that he could do, but the
sport never came naturally
to him.
"Technically I was

average/' he continued,
"hut I had a good attitude.
I'm not a natural athlete,
but I'm willing to work."
The freshman's good atti
tude is the basis for his suc
cess as a wrestler, and for
his successes in daily life.
His experience with wres
tling has taught him that if
he really throws himself
into something, he will be
able to do it.
"I have learned not to
give up — because out on
that mat you can't give up."
Kassulke views wrestling
as a way to test himself and
his attitude. "It's a good
way to put yourself and
your whole attitude against
someone, " he said. Kas
sulke does not let his oppo
nents "psyche him out."
"If I hear that someone
I'm going to wrestle is bet
ter than me, I don't give
up. They have to beat me
wrestling, not mentally,"
he said. During the Las
Vegas tournament Kassulke
showed that this philoso
phy works.
"I was up against an lowa

State wrestler, and lowa
State is one of the most
repected names in wres
tling," he said. "But I didn't
let the name get to me — I
stayed with the guy and
won the match."
Another memorable
match for Kassulke this
season was the last match
of the Mercer Island tourn
ament. "It all came down to
me. If I won, then Stanford
would take second place,
and if I lost then we would
take third."
The pressure was on, and
Kassulke overcame it. He
was behind 5-1 in the last
period, until he used a
move which switched him
from the bottom to top and
gave him four points. He

was awarded another point
for riding time and won the
match for the Cardinal.
Kassulke stresses the
mental aspects of his sport.
He employs certain tech
niques to psychologically
prepare himself for a
match. "I pace a lot, and
generally think things out.'
The best way that Kas
sulke prepares himself
mentally for a match is to
know that he is as ready for
it as he can be. Wrestling
practice two hours a day
combined with a weight lif
ting program three times a
week allows him to achieve
this readiness.
How does the freshman
have time to practice his

other hobbies with all that
wrestling? "It's hard," he
admits, "but I've always
been insanely over
scheduled, so I'm used to
it."
Kassulke does want to
develop his other talents,
and possibly become in
volved in a drama produc
tion here. "I would also
like to play the piano as an
entertainer — at the Coffee
House or at private par
ties."
Whether he is pounding
on the keyboard, or pound
ing another wrestler to the
mat, Kassulke is releasing
his frustrations. "Wrestling
helps me work out a nasty
mood," he said.

when it comes to wrestling.

In high school he was All-
Conference three years in a
row, and his record during
his senior year was 31-2. As
one of two freshmen to join
the wrestling team here this
year, Kassulke shows great
promise.
"I still have a lot to learn,
though. I am learning from
both the competition and
the coaches," he said.
"Everybody on the team is
trying to help me —
everybody is just working
together to make the team
better."
Kassulke is pleased with
the wrestling program on
the Farm, and he feels well
received as a new team
member. "I feel com
fortable on the team, which
is made up of mostly sop
homores and juniors. We
are a young team with a lot
of talent. We just need time
to get more experience."
He is also satisfied with
the team's coaches. Head
Coach Chris Horpel was a
former Stanford wrestler
who took fifth place in the
NCAAs, assistant coach

Dave Shultz was a world
champion, and his brother
Mark Shultz was a three
time NCAA champion.
"The coaches are so
good that just by wrestling
them during practice you
have to get better."
The freshman started his
wresting career in the third
grade at his elementary
school in Shakopee, Minn.
Kassulke was not a particu
larly coordinated athlete. "I
had trouble with things like
bouncing a basketball," he
said.
But even in third grade
Kassulke was big, and wres
tling seemed a to be a good
sport for him. "I was a
heavyweight then, and a lot
of times I would win tour
naments because there was
no one there to compete
against. There weren't too
many heavyweights in third
grade."
Kassulke said that wres
tling was something athlet
ic that he could do, but the
sport never came naturally
to him.
"Technically I was

average/' he continued,
"hut I had a good attitude.
I'm not a natural athlete,
but I'm willing to work."
The freshman's good atti
tude is the basis for his suc
cess as a wrestler, and for
his successes in daily life.
His experience with wres
tling has taught him that if
he really throws himself
into something, he will be
able to do it.
"I have learned not to
give up — because out on
that mat you can't give up."
Kassulke views wrestling
as a way to test himself and
his attitude. "It's a good
way to put yourself and
your whole attitude against
someone, " he said. Kas
sulke does not let his oppo
nents "psyche him out."
"If I hear that someone
I'm going to wrestle is bet
ter than me, I don't give
up. They have to beat me
wrestling, not mentally,"
he said. During the Las
Vegas tournament Kassulke
showed that this philoso
phy works.
"I was up against an lowa

State wrestler, and lowa
State is one of the most
repected names in wres
tling," he said. "But I didn't
let the name get to me — I
stayed with the guy and
won the match."
Another memorable
match for Kassulke this
season was the last match
of the Mercer Island tourn
ament. "It all came down to
me. If I won, then Stanford
would take second place,
and if I lost then we would
take third."
The pressure was on, and
Kassulke overcame it. He
was behind 5-1 in the last
period, until he used a
move which switched him
from the bottom to top and
gave him four points. He

was awarded another point
for riding time and won the
match for the Cardinal.
Kassulke stresses the
mental aspects of his sport.
He employs certain tech
niques to psychologically
prepare himself for a
match. "I pace a lot, and
generally think things out.'
The best way that Kas
sulke prepares himself
mentally for a match is to
know that he is as ready for
it as he can be. Wrestling
practice two hours a day
combined with a weight lif
ting program three times a
week allows him to achieve
this readiness.
How does the freshman
have time to practice his

other hobbies with all that
wrestling? "It's hard," he
admits, "but I've always
been insanely over
scheduled, so I'm used to
it."
Kassulke does want to
develop his other talents,
and possibly become in
volved in a drama produc
tion here. "I would also
like to play the piano as an
entertainer — at the Coffee
House or at private par
ties."
Whether he is pounding
on the keyboard, or pound
ing another wrestler to the
mat, Kassulke is releasing
his frustrations. "Wrestling
helps me work out a nasty
mood," he said.

Freshman wrestler Kurt
Kassulke's talents spread
over many keys. When Kas
sulke isn't busy pinning his
opponent to the mat, he
spends his time playing the
piano, composing songs,
singing, writing poetry or
rock climbing.
In fact, the freshman
plays the piano as a way to
relax himself before a wres
tling match. "I even found
a piano to play when we
were away at the Oregon
State Tournament over
Christmas break." he said.
As a the No. 2 wrestler to
come out of Minnesota last
year, Kassulke is a for
midable force as a wrestler,
but the songs that he
composes show another
side of his personality.
"I like to write soft
stuff," he said. "I write
when I'm depressed, con
cerned about something or
in a happy mood. I like mel
low music."
