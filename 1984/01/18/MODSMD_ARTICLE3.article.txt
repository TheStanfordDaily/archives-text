# Mosher files final appeal
## 
### 
University President Donald Ken
nedy yesterday received Steven
Mosher's final appeal for reinstate
ment. Mosher, a former anthropol
ogy graduate student, was expelled
from the University last year for
"illegal and seriously unethical con
duct" while doing research in the
People's Republic of China.
Kennedy's decision on this ap
peal, the last in a crescendo of ap
peals made at the departmental
level and continuing up to the dean
of graduate studies level, will mark
the end of administrative debate on
whether the former student will be
reinstated.
The buck will stop with Kennedy,
unless Mosher decides to take legal
action and sue the Board of Trus
tees.
The 25-page document was filed
by Steven Fabbro, a San Francisco
attorney. If it fails, Fabbro told the
Associated Press that his client in
tends to "pursue the appropriate le
gal remedies" in the California
courts.
The appeal contends that Mosher
"was denied appropriate procedural
rights in the review process and that
the University made a gross error in
its review of the . . . evidence," said
Fabbro.
Mosher, 34, was expelled last
February. The exact reasons for his
dismissal were never released and
this caused nationwide controversy.
Both Mosher and University officials
have the power to release the expla
nation for the University's action.
Neither have done so, though much
public pressure has been focused
on the issue.
Mosher has claimed that the pri
mary reason for his expulsion has to
do with an article he published in a
Taiwan newsmagazine about forced
abortions in the PRC. The article an
gered PRC officials and Mosher has
claimed that political pressure from
these officials was part of the reason
he was expelled.
University officials have repeated
ly said that the faculty's action had
nothing to do with the article.
Kennedy has 30 days in which to
act on Mosher's appeal. He was un
available for comment last night.
