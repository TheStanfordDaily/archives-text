# Local experts say women paid less

Although affirmative action programs enabled blacks
to make significant economic gains during the 19705,
white women suffered economic setbacks and saw
their starting salaries fall further behind those of white
men, according to a new study by a senior U.S. Census
Bureau official.
As reported in The New York Times, not only did wo
men start work at lower wage rates than men, but also
received fewer raises, which meant that the wage gap
between the sexes increased over the course of a
worker's career.
Three Stanford experts on sex discrimination issues
expressed little surprise at the study's findings.
Deborah Rhode, a law professor, Myra Strober, an
associate education ofussur, una r\ussefl fiumoergwr,
a senior research associate in education, all agreed that
the structure of American society perpetuates the eco
nomic inequalities between men and women.
"The barriers to women are structural," said Rhode.
"They are rooted in basic institutional patterns of the
labor force and are very difficult to change.
"In this society, sensitivity to racism is more
pronounced than sensitivity to sexism," she added.
Tht study found that in 1970 the average white wo
man entering the job market was paid 14 percent less
than the average white man, while the average black
man was paid 20 percent less.

But by 1980, black men's starting salaries were higher
than white women's. In that year the average black man
started at a wage rate 12 percent behind his white coun
terpart, while the average white woman began her
career earning 17 percent less than white men.
The study also concluded that white women's ear
ning power fell even further behind white men's
during the first decade of their careers. Among those
hired in 1970, the women's initial 14 percent disadvan
tage grew to 32 percent by 1980.
Expressed in terms of 1979 purchasing power, the
average white woman earned a starting salary of $4.38
per hour in 1970 and received raises bringing her wages
to $5.79 per hour by 1980.
In contrast, white men started at an average wage of
$5.11 in 1970 and earned $8.54 after 10 years on the job.
have equal access to all jobs is a very recent develop
ment. "This is a new concept and the job market hasn't
caught up to it yet. Change comes slowly," she said.
According to Strober, jobs such as teaching and nur
sing which have traditionally been held by women offer
fewer possibilities for advancement than those held by
men. She said this will not change until employers
adopt wage scales based on the principle of compara
ble worth.
"The chances tor comparable worth are good in the
public sector," said Strober. "New York and Washing-
ton states and the City of San lose
have already moved in that direc
tion, but I'm pessimistic about get
ting comparable worth adopted by
private employers."
The problem is that comparable
worth requires employers to dis
regard market conditions when de
termining salaries. Strober referred
to a Denver court case in which a
judge agreed that nurses should be
paid at least as well as plumbers but
wouldn't require such a change be
cause, the judge said, "I personally
don't want to be responsible for the
overthrow of the capitalist system."
Despite the problems she men

tioned, Strober said she is
optimistic about the chances of
narrowing the pay gap in the next 20
years.
"More and more women are
training in the high-paying tradition
ally male occupations and many of
the barriers seem to have fallen,"
she said.
Both Strober and Rumberger have
conducted their own research on is
sues related to economic differ
ences between the sexes.
Strober is the director of the Uni
versity's Center for Research On
Women.
In a 1982 study, she compared the
earning power of male and female
members of the Stantord Business
School class of 1974. She found no
differences in starting salaries, but

noted that by 1978 the women were
earning only 80 percent as much as
their male classmates.
Rumberger has studied the types
of jobs that have been available to
different racial and sexual groups
during the last 25 years.
According to his findings, the
public sector has been the principal
source of employment opportuni
ties and social mobility for women.
But Rumberger also found that
the public sector job market con
tracted during the 19705, leading to
a decrease in job openings in the
areas where women have tradition
ally found work.
"Women have been hurt much
more than men by the decline in the
number of public sector jobs," he
said.
