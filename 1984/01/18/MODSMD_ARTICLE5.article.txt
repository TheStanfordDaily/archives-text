# Should members be registered?
## Senate questions eligibility 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night
defeated by a narrow margin legisla
tion which would have provided for
the expulsion or suspension of all
non-registered students from the
senate.
The senate voted 11-7 to expel or
suspend non-registered students
but the legislation needed a two
thirds majority to pass.
According to the by-laws, a senate
candidate has to be a registered stu
dent, or registered for the three
quarters previous to his candidacy.
But there is nothing in the by-laws
about whether or not a senator has
to be registered during his or her
term of office.
Acording to senator David Porter,
this policy allows senators to repre
sent a constituency of which they
may not be a part.
"This could be a serious prob
lem," Porter said.
At present, three members of the
senate are not registered students.
According to senate chair )ug
Jagadish, all three are graduate
senators; one, Eric Berg, was unable

to register because of financial diffi
culties.
"However, he said he was going
to borrow the money and would be
registering shortly," Jagadish said.
Su Uhland, a Council-of-
Presidents-member, who also iden
tified herself as non-registered, ex
plained that in some situations
registration is a technicality.
"I applied for co-terminal status,
and my department said they'd ac
cept me after Jan. 30," Uhland said.
"So at the moment, I'm not a regis

tered student, but I go to classes like
everyone else."
The debate focused around the
issue of late registration. Several
graduate senators said that due to
the nature of the graduate program,
they could and often did register
late in the quarter. The senators
generally agreed that if a deadline
should be set, it should be the offi
cial registration deadline for the
quarter â€” for this quarter, it would
be Jan. 30.
Several senators suggested that a
senator who could not meet this
deadline should be required to sub
mit a letter declaring intent to regis
ter. Rut Porter argued that such a
letter could not be held binding.
' What if, 'at the end of the quar
ter, someone says that they had no
intent to register after all?" he
asked.
Jagadish said that as long as a
senator is "generally perceived as a
student," he did not anticipate com
plications resulting from his or her
registration status.
"If a person is behaving like a stu
dent, and not like a professional
politician, do we say it's OK?" he
asked.
