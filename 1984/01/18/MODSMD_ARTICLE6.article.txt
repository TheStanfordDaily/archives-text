# Gays furious over Ariz, official's slurs
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (CLAS) has called for the
resignation of an elected Arizona
official who said Stanford should
experiment with "homosexuals
and lesbians from San Francisco"
instead of animals from shelters.
In December, GLAS sent a let
ter to the Boarrl of Supervisors of
counry, /-Arun., c/crnanu
ing that Supervisor Hawley Atkin
son, a member of the board for
eight years, resign.
Maricopa County includes the
Phoenix metropolitan area.
"If Mr. Atkinson continues to
refuse this reasonable demand,
we ask that his fellow board
members vote his removal from
office," the letter said. "If this is
not within their legal power, we
ask the board to vote a formal
censure, in order to ensure that
Mr. Atkinson's statements have
no appearance of board ap
proval."
Gerard Koskovich, a member
of GLAS' steering committee,
said the board has not answered
the letter.
GLAS will send another letter
this week to the board asking for
a response, he said.
A furor has arisen in Arizona
since Atkinson, 68, made the
remark in December to a
reporter from the Phoenix
Gazette.
He spoke a few days before the
board lifted its controversial ban
on the sale of animals from the
pound to research institutions.
Stanford and other universities
had asked the board to lift the
ban.
David Mendelow, associate
dean for administration at the
Stanford School of Medicine,
sent a telegram to the board in
October describing the impor
tance of animals in scientific re
search. The board, however,
voted to impose the ban.
Michael Goodkind, a Medical
Center spokesman, said the
telegram was a response to
"factually inaccurate informa
tion" given to the board by the
Environmental Communication
Network, a group in Phoenix that
lobbied against lifting the ban.

Stanford bought 50 cats and 11
dogs from the Maricopa County
pound in the first eight months of
1983, Goodkind said. The animals
were primarily used for heart
transplant research, he said.
Atkinson's remark has gotten
him into some political trouble.
The Arizona Republic has
called on Atkinson to resign. The
Arizona I psbiaßa£f'',l a, i'i f-nrr«.
« g'oup cm people, plans to
mobilize the county's estimated
150,000 homosexual voters
against Atkinson when he runs
for re-election Nov. 4.
Atkinson claimed the Phoenix
Gazette misinterpreted his
remark.
When contacted by The Daily,
Atkinson said: "If you are a stu
dent at Stanford, you ought to
know more than most people
that you shouldn't believe what
you read in the newspapers."
He refused to answer any more
questions.
Koskovich said Atkinson's
remark is a "severe example" of
a "homophobic" politician, of
which he says there are many.
"It is simply a question of
degree," he said. "Most
politicians don't appear to be ad
vocating violence. They do ad
vocate all sorts of unpleasant
things like discrimination against
gay persons.
"Statements of a general na
ture disparaging gay persons are
so commonplace that both the
Gay Community News and the
Advocate (two leading gay
publications) run a regular
feature of quotes from various
political officials that are ob
noxious and offensive."
Two homosexual activists in
Phoenix said they had no doubt
Atkinson made the controversial
statement.
"There was a group (of gay ac
tivists) that met him and it was
very clear that he did make the
statement," said Kirk Baxter, a
member of the Arizona Lesbian-
Gay Task Force. "Mr. Atkinson
has violated the basic human
rights of a lot of people, not just
gays."
Atkinson's remark demonstrates
his political ignorance, Baxter said.
"His incompetence has been
brought out be all this," he said. "I
am surprised that somebody could
be that ridiculously politically ig
norant. He wasn't even aware that
there were any gays in Arizona."
Tom Fitzpatrick, a columnist for
the Arizona Republic who has harsh
ly criticized Atkinson's statement,
said homosexual activists will not be
able to unseat Atkinson in the Nov.
4 election.
"I think most people in Arizona
agree with him," Fitzpatrick said. "I
am sure he will get re-elected."
Atkinson represents the conserva
tive retirement community of Sun
City, whose state representative, Re
publican Jim Rati iff, caused a furor

in 1981 when he suggested that
abortion be banned except in cases
where a white woman was raped by
a black man.
