Private taping ruled legal
Washington — The Supreme Court decided 5-4
yesterday that manufacturers of video tape recor
ders do not violate federal copyright law when the
devices are used to record programs for private
home viewing.
In the most closely watched commercial dispute at
the court in the past decade, the justices concluded
that the private taping of a TV program by consu
mers for viewing at a later time amounts to "fair
use" of the material and is therefore permitted un
der current federal law.
The ruling was a defeat for the entertainment in
dustry, which had generally supported a copyright
suit filed in 1976 by Walt Disney Productions and

Universal City Studios Inc. against the Sony Corp.,
manufacturer of the Betamax video recorder.
In an important victory for the billion-dollar video
industry, the Supreme Court also ruled that Sony
could not be held legally responsible even if the
Betamax were being used by consumers in a way
that violated the copyright law. The sale of copying
equipment, the justices said, "does not constitute
contributory infringement if the product is widely
used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes."
Shultz urges arms talks
Stockholm, Sweden — Secretary of State George
Shultz, speaking at the opening session of a 35-
nation European security conference, appealed to
the Soviet Union yesterday to create a "turning
point in East-West relations" by agreeing to resume
arms-control negotiations.
