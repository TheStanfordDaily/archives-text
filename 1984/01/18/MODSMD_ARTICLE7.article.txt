Private taping ruled legal
Washington — The Supreme Court decided 5-4
yesterday that manufacturers of video tape recor
ders do not violate federal copyright law when the
devices are used to record programs for private
home viewing.
In the most closely watched commercial dispute at
the court in the past decade, the justices concluded
that the private taping of a TV program by consu
mers for viewing at a later time amounts to "fair
use" of the material and is therefore permitted un
der current federal law.
The ruling was a defeat for the entertainment in
dustry, which had generally supported a copyright
suit filed in 1976 by Walt Disney Productions and

Universal City Studios Inc. against the Sony Corp.,
manufacturer of the Betamax video recorder.
In an important victory for the billion-dollar video
industry, the Supreme Court also ruled that Sony
could not be held legally responsible even if the
Betamax were being used by consumers in a way
that violated the copyright law. The sale of copying
equipment, the justices said, "does not constitute
contributory infringement if the product is widely
used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes."
Shultz urges arms talks
Stockholm, Sweden — Secretary of State George
Shultz, speaking at the opening session of a 35-
nation European security conference, appealed to

point in East-West relations" by agreeing to resume
arms-control negotiations.
Shultz, who will press his case for renewed talks in a private
meeting today with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, also an
nounced that the United States was preparing a new proposal for ban
ning the use of chemical weapons worldwide. The Soviets have pro
posed such a ban in Europe only.

helicopter for "a few moments" after it was forced down last Wednes
day along the Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
A Defense Ministry communique on the results of a Nicaraguan in
vestigation of the incident added, however, that without seeing the
helicopter or interviewing the crew it was impossible to say whether
the craft's pilot was killed in the air or on the ground.
Beirut university president killed

Beirut, Malcolm Kerr, was shot and killed on the campus today, police
