# Tuition increase rate slows
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Tuition, according to a recent University projection,
will not decrease next year, but it will do the next best
thing: increase at a slower rate.
This is partly because of the economic recovery,
which has lowered the rate of inflation, and partly be
cause of the University, which has made an effort to
hold down the rate of the tuition increase.
If inflation remains low, Stanford students can look
forward to even smaller increases in tuition in coming
years, according to the University's long-range
forecast.
Tuition will increase 7.5 percent, from $9027 to $9704,
for the 1984-85 school year if the Board of Trustees ac
cepts a current recommendation from the University's
Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This
represents an increase of 2.5 percent above the
projected inflation rate of 5 percent, which was deter

mined in an OMB survey of both Stanford and Federal
Reserve Board economists.
These figures are only tentative, and may be adjusted
before they are presented to the Board at its meeting
next month or by the Board itself. Trustees last year
trimmed the projected tuition hike from 12 to 9.8 per
cent.
According to Tim Warner, an associate provost in the
OMB, his department "made a conscious decision to
try to bring down the rate of growth of tuition," which
last year was 9.8 percent, or 3.8 percent more than the 6
percent rate of inflation.
Projections by the OMB for 1985-86 and 1986-87 indi
cate that this trend will continue, with inflation
predicted to be 5 percent and tuition expected to rise
by only 1.5 percent over this inflation rate, or 6.5 per
cent.
The tuition increase will affect the
pocketbooks of students but not the
coffers of the Financial Aids Office,
which will receive additional fun
ding for its programs, according to
Vincent De Anda, associate director
of the Financial Aids Office.
After being informed of the rate at
which fees are expected to increase,
his office determines how much fin
ancial aid students are likely to
need, De Anda said. Because the
University maintains a need-blind
admissions policy and meets the
demonstrated financial need of all
undergraduates, this request is met,
he said.
The operating budget of the Fin
ancial Aids Office, however, along
with most other University budgets,
has been cut to cover recent Univer
sity budget shortfalls. "We try to
function with fewer people," De
Anda said.
According to Warner, the Univer
sity uses three factors in determin
ing the increase in tuition.
One is the goal of maintaining the
quality of Stanford's programs. Pro
viding funds for faculty salaries,
construction and maintenance and
library costs are all aspects of this
goal, and increased income is
needed to meet all of these ex
penses as they rise.
The second goal, Warner said, is
to keep Stanford affordable to a
wide range of families.
The third goal is to keep tuition
comparable to that charged by
schools of Stanford's caliber — Yale,
Columbia, Brown, Harvard etc.
