# Tuition increase rate slows
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Tuition, according to a recent University projection,
will not decrease next year, but it will do the next best
thing: increase at a slower rate.
This is partly because of the economic recovery,
which has lowered the rate of inflation, and partly be
cause of the University, which has made an effort to
hold down the rate of the tuition increase.
If inflation remains low, Stanford students can look
forward to even smaller increases in tuition in coming
years, according to the University's long-range
forecast.
Tuition will increase 7.5 percent, from $9027 to $9704,
for the 1984-85 school year if the Board of Trustees ac
cepts a current recommendation from the University's
Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This
represents an increase of 2.5 percent above the
projected inflation rate of 5 percent, which was deter

mined in an OMB survey of both Stanford and Federal
Reserve Board economists.
These figures are only tentative, and may be adjusted
before they are presented to the Board at its meeting
next month or by the Board itself. Trustees last year
trimmed the projected tuition hike from 12 to 9.8 per
cent.
According to Tim Warner, an associate provost in the
OMB, his department "made a conscious decision to
try to bring down the rate of growth of tuition," which
last year was 9.8 percent, or 3.8 percent more than the 6
percent rate of inflation.
Projections by the OMB for 1985-86 and 1986-87 indi
cate that this trend will continue, with inflation
predicted to be 5 percent and tuition expected to rise
by only 1.5 percent over this inflation rate, or 6.5 per
cent.
