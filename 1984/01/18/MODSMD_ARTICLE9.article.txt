## KZSU seeks new fans 
### DANNY PEARL 
In KZSU's studio B there is a
poster, drawn in 1970, which
pictures the station as being in
the thick of campus life. A
roving reporter sits atop
Hoover Tower looking down
on speeches, rallies and local
performances proceeding
below. And lettered under
neath is the proud slogan:
"KZSU is everywhere."
But in 1984, KZSU is
everywhere but on campus.
While student interest in
working at the station is at a
healthy high, student interest
in listening is lagging. The
truth is that most of KZSU's lis
teners for quite some time
have been off-campus —
guesses run anywhere from 70
percent to 90 percent.
While this distribution
might not be unusual for a col
lege station with a signal that

reaches as far as the East Bay,
it has been a cause for con
cern recently.
"KZSU traditionally has not
been listened to by Stanford
students," program director
Linda Christie said. "But we
should try to appeal to Stan
ford students. After all,
they're funding us."
And student financial sup
port, which is the station's
only significant source of
income, can no longer be
taken for granted as more and
more students take back their
fee assessment dollars.
In an attempt to address the
problem of campus visibility,
KZSU conducted a survey of
Stanford students last quarter
to find out what kind of music
and what kind of non-music
features they wanted to hear
on their campus station, and
to find out what students liked

and disliked about it. The sur
vey form was returned by 110
graduates and 226 under
graduates, and the results are
now being translated into
changes for winter quarter.
" What we found," said pro
motions director Paul Salazar,
who engineered the survey,
"is that students have checked
off what we do anyhow. In
other words, they said they
want to hear '60s and '70s rock
not heard on other stations,
they want to hear new music
the minute it comes out, plus
a little bit of Rand B, reggae,
and ethnic music. And that's
what we already play."
Part of the problem comes
from the station's lack of ad
vertising. KZSU does its fair
share of on-air promotions,
but little off-air advertising.

TURNING THE TABLES: KZSU disc jockey Jorge Soto, a KZSU studio. Although many students have expressed inter
senior in electrical engineering, puts on an album in the est in working for the station, few of its listeners are students.
Lack of funds makes in
creased advertising almost
impossible, though, when re
placement of outmoded and
defective equipment, attain
ment of better news re
sources, and other mainte
nance costs take priority. "At
this point we're not looking to
do much more advertise
ment," admitted station
manager Tracie Lindeman.
Rather, KZSU is planning
some format changes and
other improvements in
response to the survey. For
one thing, many students indi
cated that they don't listen to
KZSU because they never
know what's going to be on
when they tune in. This quar
ter, Christie said, an expanded
program guide will be dis
tributed, in which each hour
of programming for each day
will be outlined and in which
each disc jockey will be given
the opportunity to write a
description of the music he or
she plays. The schedule will
be distributed in student dor
mitories, in off-campus loca
tions such as Tower Records,
and through the mail.
In addition, there will be
more varied "music meals"
this quarter, in which local
and thematic music will be
featured. Local bands will
brought into the studio, either
to air demo tapes or to per
form live. Special features,
like a 10-part series on Ameri

can music from 1900 to 1980
and a "Zoo Picks" new album
series, will be presented.
And there will be more clas
sical music in response to the
fact that classical music ranked
third in the survey's ranking of
preferred musical styles.
Improvements also will be
made in the news and public
affairs departments. KZSU
news, according to both Lin
deman and Christie, was once
a highly popular and highly ac
tive department which literally
took to the streets in covering
the student uprisings of the
late '60s and early '70s. In
recent years, however, KZSU
news has fallen victim to indif
ference and neglect.
In the last year the news de
partment has been rebuilding
slowly. This quarter will see
beefed-up local news

coverage, a "round table" dis
cussion show, and depart
ment heads Tony lames and
Daryn Kagan hope to see a
more lively "Campus Confer
ence" interview show.
While changes have been
made, survey results indicate
that KZSU will have to make
more substantial changes if it
is serious about courting the
campus listeners. The survey,
in addition to providing ideas
for minor adjustments, indi
cated genuine student discon
tent with KZSU's basic format
and style. "Too much New
Wave," was a recurring com
ment, as were "not enough
professionalism," "poor DJs,"
and "no continuity."
Much of this criticism stems
from KZSU's hands-off philo
sophy. DJs are not told what to
play or when to play it. They
are given rudimentary training

for one quarter and then are
set free to gain their experi
ence over the air. After all,
KZSU is "the Zoo" — more
than just a convenient
nickname for the stations's
call letters, but also an apt
description of the station's
anything-goes format. It is a
philosophy that KZSU's more
faithful listeners appreciate,
partly because it makes it easy
to get requests played. And it
is a philosophy that the sta
tion's management shows no
signs of wanting to change.
"We've considered tighten
ing things up," said Lin
deman. "We've even talked
about formatting across the
board, with 6 to 10 a.m. being
jazz, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. being
classical, 2 to 6 p.m. being
something else, and so on.
We would gain some listeners,
but they would be listeners

only for a certain time slot
each day. That's not what we
want."
KZSU is experimenting with
rough formatting of the week
ly schedule, with the idea of
playing more "hard" music as
the week progresses. Christie,
who came up with the new
format as a compromise, said
she didn't want to present
anything more dramatic for
fear of taking control of what
is played from the students.
"We don't pay our disc
jockeys, so we can't really tell
them what to play. It's up to
the student," Salazar said.
Student control of the sta
tion has been an inviolable
principle for KZSU. Only stu
dents are allowed to work for
the station, and it has no in
tention of sacrificing student
autonomy in the name of
professionalism.

The question of how close
KZSU should be to commer
cial radio is a relevant one,
though. If KZSU wants to
please the student body, and
90 percent of the students
want to hear Michael lackson
and Culture Club, is that what
KZSU should play?
But even DJs who want to
play more obscure music are
hampered by the fact that
KZSU is serviced mainly by the
big commercial record com
panies. Music director Frank
Bird has been making an all
out effort to get independent
labels, but the station is
caught in the industry catc;h-22
which makes independent
and import labels reluctant to
service a station unless the sta
tion is already playing in
dependents and imports.
It is unlikely that KZSU will

dramatically change the kind
of music it plays. In truth, it is
not clear that the station
would endear itself to the
campus by making this kind of
change. Christie suggested
that an increase in non-music
programming which is rele
vant to the campus could be
the key.
And the station will have to
make a concerted effort to
find more funds for advertis
ing and programming. The
most obvious source of
money is underwriting by
local businesses — KLAX, KFJC
and KUSF all rely fairly heavily
on underwriting. "We're
trying this year to get more un
derwriting," said lindeman.
"It's hard to get underwriting
when you have as free a for
mat as we do, but we're
trying."

that KZSU will have to make
more substantial changes if it
is serious about courting the
campus listeners. The survey,
in addition to providing ideas
for minor adjustments, indi
cated genuine student discon
tent with KZSU's basic format
and style. "Too much New
Wave," was a recurring com
ment, as were "not enough
professionalism," "poor DJs,"
and "no continuity."
Much of this criticism stems
from KZSU's hands-off philo
sophy. DJs are not told what to
play or when to play it. They
are given rudimentary training

for one quarter and then are
set free to gain their experi
ence over the air. After all,
KZSU is "the Zoo" — more
than just a convenient
nickname for the stations's
call letters, but also an apt
description of the station's
anything-goes format. It is a
philosophy that KZSU's more
faithful listeners appreciate,
partly because it makes it easy
to get requests played. And it
is a philosophy that the sta
tion's management shows no
signs of wanting to change.
"We've considered tighten
ing things up," said Lin
deman. "We've even talked
about formatting across the
board, with 6 to 10 a.m. being
jazz, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. being
classical, 2 to 6 p.m. being
something else, and so on.
We would gain some listeners,
but they would be listeners

only for a certain time slot
each day. That's not what we
want."
KZSU is experimenting with
rough formatting of the week
ly schedule, with the idea of
playing more "hard" music as
the week progresses. Christie,
who came up with the new
format as a compromise, said
she didn't want to present
anything more dramatic for
fear of taking control of what
is played from the students.
"We don't pay our disc
jockeys, so we can't really tell
them what to play. It's up to
the student," Salazar said.
Student control of the sta
tion has been an inviolable
principle for KZSU. Only stu
dents are allowed to work for
the station, and it has no in
tention of sacrificing student
autonomy in the name of
professionalism.

The question of how close
KZSU should be to commer
cial radio is a relevant one,
though. If KZSU wants to
please the student body, and
90 percent of the students
want to hear Michael lackson
and Culture Club, is that what
KZSU should play?
But even DJs who want to
play more obscure music are
hampered by the fact that
KZSU is serviced mainly by the
big commercial record com
panies. Music director Frank
Bird has been making an all
out effort to get independent
labels, but the station is
caught in the industry catc;h-22
which makes independent
and import labels reluctant to
service a station unless the sta
tion is already playing in
dependents and imports.
It is unlikely that KZSU will

dramatically change the kind
of music it plays. In truth, it is
not clear that the station
would endear itself to the
campus by making this kind of
change. Christie suggested
that an increase in non-music
programming which is rele
vant to the campus could be
the key.
And the station will have to
make a concerted effort to
find more funds for advertis
ing and programming. The
most obvious source of
money is underwriting by
local businesses — KLAX, KFJC
and KUSF all rely fairly heavily
on underwriting. "We're
trying this year to get more un
derwriting," said lindeman.
"It's hard to get underwriting
when you have as free a for
mat as we do, but we're
trying."
In KZSU's studio B there is a
poster, drawn in 1970, which
pictures the station as being in
the thick of campus life. A
roving reporter sits atop
Hoover Tower looking down
on speeches, rallies and local
performances proceeding
below. And lettered under
neath is the proud slogan:
"KZSU is everywhere."
But in 1984, KZSU is
everywhere but on campus.
While student interest in
working at the station is at a
healthy high, student interest
in listening is lagging. The
truth is that most of KZSU's lis
teners for quite some time
have been off-campus —
guesses run anywhere from 70
percent to 90 percent.
While this distribution
might not be unusual for a col
lege station with a signal that

reaches as far as the East Bay,
it has been a cause for con
cern recently.
"KZSU traditionally has not
been listened to by Stanford
students," program director
Linda Christie said. "But we
should try to appeal to Stan
ford students. After all,
they're funding us."
And student financial sup
port, which is the station's
only significant source of
income, can no longer be
taken for granted as more and
more students take back their
fee assessment dollars.
In an attempt to address the
problem of campus visibility,
KZSU conducted a survey of
Stanford students last quarter
to find out what kind of music
and what kind of non-music
features they wanted to hear
on their campus station, and
to find out what students liked

and disliked about it. The sur
vey form was returned by 110
graduates and 226 under
graduates, and the results are
now being translated into
changes for winter quarter.
" What we found," said pro
motions director Paul Salazar,
who engineered the survey,
"is that students have checked
off what we do anyhow. In
other words, they said they
want to hear '60s and '70s rock
not heard on other stations,
they want to hear new music
the minute it comes out, plus
a little bit of Rand B, reggae,
and ethnic music. And that's
what we already play."
Part of the problem comes
from the station's lack of ad
vertising. KZSU does its fair
share of on-air promotions,
but little off-air advertising.

TURNING THE TABLES: KZSU disc jockey Jorge Soto, a KZSU studio. Although many students have expressed inter
senior in electrical engineering, puts on an album in the est in working for the station, few of its listeners are students.
Lack of funds makes in
creased advertising almost
impossible, though, when re
placement of outmoded and
defective equipment, attain
ment of better news re
sources, and other mainte
nance costs take priority. "At
this point we're not looking to
do much more advertise
ment," admitted station
manager Tracie Lindeman.
Rather, KZSU is planning
some format changes and
other improvements in
response to the survey. For
one thing, many students indi
cated that they don't listen to
KZSU because they never
know what's going to be on
when they tune in. This quar
ter, Christie said, an expanded
program guide will be dis
tributed, in which each hour
of programming for each day
will be outlined and in which
each disc jockey will be given
the opportunity to write a
description of the music he or
she plays. The schedule will
be distributed in student dor
mitories, in off-campus loca
tions such as Tower Records,
and through the mail.
In addition, there will be
more varied "music meals"
this quarter, in which local
and thematic music will be
featured. Local bands will
brought into the studio, either
to air demo tapes or to per
form live. Special features,
like a 10-part series on Ameri

can music from 1900 to 1980
and a "Zoo Picks" new album
series, will be presented.
And there will be more clas
sical music in response to the
fact that classical music ranked
third in the survey's ranking of
preferred musical styles.
Improvements also will be
made in the news and public
affairs departments. KZSU
news, according to both Lin
deman and Christie, was once
a highly popular and highly ac
tive department which literally
took to the streets in covering
the student uprisings of the
late '60s and early '70s. In
recent years, however, KZSU
news has fallen victim to indif
ference and neglect.
In the last year the news de
partment has been rebuilding
slowly. This quarter will see
beefed-up local news

coverage, a "round table" dis
cussion show, and depart
ment heads Tony lames and
Daryn Kagan hope to see a
more lively "Campus Confer
ence" interview show.

income, can no longer be
taken for granted as more and
more students take back their
fee assessment dollars.
In an attempt to address the
problem of campus visibility,
KZSU conducted a survey of
Stanford students last quarter
to find out what kind of music
and what kind of non-music
features they wanted to hear
on their campus station, and
to find out what students liked

and disliked about it. The sur
vey form was returned by 110
graduates and 226 under
graduates, and the results are
now being translated into
changes for winter quarter.
" What we found," said pro
motions director Paul Salazar,
who engineered the survey,
"is that students have checked
off what we do anyhow. In
other words, they said they
want to hear '60s and '70s rock
not heard on other stations,
they want to hear new music
the minute it comes out, plus
a little bit of Rand B, reggae,
and ethnic music. And that's
what we already play."
Part of the problem comes
from the station's lack of ad
vertising. KZSU does its fair
share of on-air promotions,
but little off-air advertising.

TURNING THE TABLES: KZSU disc jockey Jorge Soto, a KZSU studio. Although many students have expressed inter
senior in electrical engineering, puts on an album in the est in working for the station, few of its listeners are students.
Lack of funds makes in
creased advertising almost
impossible, though, when re
placement of outmoded and
defective equipment, attain
ment of better news re
sources, and other mainte
nance costs take priority. "At
this point we're not looking to
do much more advertise
ment," admitted station
manager Tracie Lindeman.
Rather, KZSU is planning
some format changes and
other improvements in
response to the survey. For
one thing, many students indi
cated that they don't listen to
KZSU because they never
know what's going to be on
when they tune in. This quar
ter, Christie said, an expanded
program guide will be dis
tributed, in which each hour
of programming for each day
will be outlined and in which
each disc jockey will be given
the opportunity to write a
description of the music he or
she plays. The schedule will
be distributed in student dor
mitories, in off-campus loca
tions such as Tower Records,
and through the mail.
In addition, there will be
more varied "music meals"
this quarter, in which local
and thematic music will be
featured. Local bands will
brought into the studio, either
to air demo tapes or to per
form live. Special features,
like a 10-part series on Ameri

can music from 1900 to 1980
and a "Zoo Picks" new album
series, will be presented.
And there will be more clas
sical music in response to the
fact that classical music ranked
third in the survey's ranking of
preferred musical styles.
Improvements also will be
made in the news and public
affairs departments. KZSU
news, according to both Lin
deman and Christie, was once
a highly popular and highly ac
tive department which literally
took to the streets in covering
the student uprisings of the
late '60s and early '70s. In
recent years, however, KZSU
news has fallen victim to indif
ference and neglect.
In the last year the news de
partment has been rebuilding
slowly. This quarter will see
beefed-up local news

coverage, a "round table" dis
cussion show, and depart
ment heads Tony lames and
Daryn Kagan hope to see a
more lively "Campus Confer
ence" interview show.
While changes have been
made, survey results indicate
that KZSU will have to make
more substantial changes if it
is serious about courting the
campus listeners. The survey,
in addition to providing ideas
for minor adjustments, indi
cated genuine student discon
tent with KZSU's basic format
and style. "Too much New
Wave," was a recurring com
ment, as were "not enough
professionalism," "poor DJs,"
and "no continuity."
Much of this criticism stems
from KZSU's hands-off philo
sophy. DJs are not told what to
play or when to play it. They
are given rudimentary training

for one quarter and then are
set free to gain their experi
ence over the air. After all,
KZSU is "the Zoo" — more
than just a convenient
nickname for the stations's
call letters, but also an apt
description of the station's
anything-goes format. It is a
philosophy that KZSU's more
faithful listeners appreciate,
partly because it makes it easy
to get requests played. And it
is a philosophy that the sta
tion's management shows no
signs of wanting to change.
"We've considered tighten
ing things up," said Lin
deman. "We've even talked
about formatting across the
board, with 6 to 10 a.m. being
jazz, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. being
classical, 2 to 6 p.m. being
something else, and so on.
We would gain some listeners,
but they would be listeners

only for a certain time slot
each day. That's not what we
want."
KZSU is experimenting with
rough formatting of the week
ly schedule, with the idea of
playing more "hard" music as
the week progresses. Christie,
who came up with the new
format as a compromise, said
she didn't want to present
anything more dramatic for
fear of taking control of what
is played from the students.
"We don't pay our disc
jockeys, so we can't really tell
them what to play. It's up to
the student," Salazar said.
Student control of the sta
tion has been an inviolable
principle for KZSU. Only stu
dents are allowed to work for
the station, and it has no in
tention of sacrificing student
autonomy in the name of
professionalism.

The question of how close
KZSU should be to commer
cial radio is a relevant one,
though. If KZSU wants to
please the student body, and
90 percent of the students
want to hear Michael lackson
and Culture Club, is that what
KZSU should play?
But even DJs who want to
play more obscure music are
hampered by the fact that
KZSU is serviced mainly by the
big commercial record com
panies. Music director Frank
Bird has been making an all
out effort to get independent
labels, but the station is
caught in the industry catc;h-22
which makes independent
and import labels reluctant to
service a station unless the sta
tion is already playing in
dependents and imports.
It is unlikely that KZSU will

dramatically change the kind
of music it plays. In truth, it is
not clear that the station
would endear itself to the
campus by making this kind of
change. Christie suggested
that an increase in non-music
programming which is rele
vant to the campus could be
the key.
And the station will have to
make a concerted effort to
find more funds for advertis
ing and programming. The
most obvious source of
money is underwriting by
local businesses — KLAX, KFJC
and KUSF all rely fairly heavily
on underwriting. "We're
trying this year to get more un
derwriting," said lindeman.
"It's hard to get underwriting
when you have as free a for
mat as we do, but we're
trying."
