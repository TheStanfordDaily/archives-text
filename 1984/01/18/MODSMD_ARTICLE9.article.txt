## KZSU seeks new fans 
### DANNY PEARL 
In KZSU's studio B there is a
poster, drawn in 1970, which
pictures the station as being in
the thick of campus life. A
roving reporter sits atop
Hoover Tower looking down
on speeches, rallies and local
performances proceeding
below. And lettered under
neath is the proud slogan:
"KZSU is everywhere."
But in 1984, KZSU is
everywhere but on campus.
While student interest in
working at the station is at a
healthy high, student interest
in listening is lagging. The
truth is that most of KZSU's lis
teners for quite some time
have been off-campus â€”
guesses run anywhere from 70
percent to 90 percent.
While this distribution
might not be unusual for a col
lege station with a signal that

reaches as far as the East Bay,
it has been a cause for con
cern recently.
"KZSU traditionally has not
been listened to by Stanford
students," program director
Linda Christie said. "But we
should try to appeal to Stan
ford students. After all,
they're funding us."
And student financial sup
port, which is the station's
only significant source of
income, can no longer be
taken for granted as more and
more students take back their
fee assessment dollars.
In an attempt to address the
problem of campus visibility,
KZSU conducted a survey of
Stanford students last quarter
to find out what kind of music
and what kind of non-music
features they wanted to hear
on their campus station, and
to find out what students liked

and disliked about it. The sur
vey form was returned by 110
graduates and 226 under
graduates, and the results are
now being translated into
changes for winter quarter.
" What we found," said pro
motions director Paul Salazar,
who engineered the survey,
"is that students have checked
off what we do anyhow. In
other words, they said they
want to hear '60s and '70s rock
not heard on other stations,
they want to hear new music
the minute it comes out, plus
a little bit of Rand B, reggae,
and ethnic music. And that's
what we already play."
Part of the problem comes
from the station's lack of ad
vertising. KZSU does its fair
share of on-air promotions,
but little off-air advertising.

TURNING THE TABLES: KZSU disc jockey Jorge Soto, a KZSU studio. Although many students have expressed inter
senior in electrical engineering, puts on an album in the est in working for the station, few of its listeners are students.
