# Kennedy: library compromise 'difficult'
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy reiterated yesterday that Stan
ford will allow a Ronald Reagan cen
ter tor public affairs to be built here
only if the University can have aca
demic governance over the center.
Academic governance is
"essential to the University" but
remains "absolutely unacceptable
to the White House," and that basic
difference makes it "difficult" for
the University and the White House
to devise a mutually acceptable
compromise that would bring a
Reagan presidential complex here,
Kennedy said.
His statement, issued in response
to alumni and media inquiries about
the University's position, appeared

to put further in doubt the possibili
ty that Stanford and White House
will ever reach agreement.
The lengthy statement detailed
the reasons behind Stanford's
steadfast stance, which is that the
public affairs center must be part of
the University's normal academic
governance structure â€” and not ad
ministered by the Hoover Institu
tion, as the White House has in
sisted.
Kennedy's statement indicated
that neither of two alternative
proposals that have been raised in
recent months would be likely to
satisfy the University's insistence on
academic governance.
One such alternative, proposed
by White House officials at a
meeting with Kennedy and others

Dec. 7, would be for the policy cen
ter to take the form of an indepen
dent national center managed by a
private foundation and built on land
leased from the University.
Kennedy said the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences, which was founded with
support from the Ford Foundation,
has been put forth as an example,
but "the cases are not comparable."
Kennedy explained that "neither
the foundation nor the center was
associated with any doctrine or
school of thought within the behav
ioral sciences ....
"A foundation to be created for a
presidential center for public affairs
has no such history. It would be
formed for the purpose of maintain

ing such a center on behalf of a
public figure with a particular politi
cal philosophy," the statement said.
\ presidential center for public af
fairs, Kennedy said, "would in
evitably be viewed as connected
wirh the University."
"There can be no convincing as
surances that a center organized in
dependently of the University and
functioning merely as lessee would
be 'subject' to normal academic
governance," he said.
Another proposal, one version of
which was reportedly forwarded by
Hoover Institution officials at the
White House meeting, would be for
a board composed of both Univer
sity and Hoover officials to


"Mr. Meese has made it
plain . . . that academic
governance is not
merely a principle in
which he is
uninterested; it is one
he wishes actively to
reject
