# Kennedy: library compromise 'difficult'
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy reiterated yesterday that Stan
ford will allow a Ronald Reagan cen
ter tor public affairs to be built here
only if the University can have aca
demic governance over the center.
Academic governance is
"essential to the University" but
remains "absolutely unacceptable
to the White House," and that basic
difference makes it "difficult" for
the University and the White House
to devise a mutually acceptable
compromise that would bring a
Reagan presidential complex here,
Kennedy said.
His statement, issued in response
to alumni and media inquiries about
the University's position, appeared

to put further in doubt the possibili
ty that Stanford and White House
will ever reach agreement.
The lengthy statement detailed
the reasons behind Stanford's
steadfast stance, which is that the
public affairs center must be part of
the University's normal academic
governance structure — and not ad
ministered by the Hoover Institu
tion, as the White House has in
sisted.
Kennedy's statement indicated
that neither of two alternative
proposals that have been raised in
recent months would be likely to
satisfy the University's insistence on
academic governance.
One such alternative, proposed
by White House officials at a
meeting with Kennedy and others

Dec. 7, would be for the policy cen
ter to take the form of an indepen
dent national center managed by a
private foundation and built on land
leased from the University.
Kennedy said the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences, which was founded with
support from the Ford Foundation,
has been put forth as an example,
but "the cases are not comparable."
Kennedy explained that "neither
the foundation nor the center was
associated with any doctrine or
school of thought within the behav
ioral sciences ....
"A foundation to be created for a
presidential center for public affairs
has no such history. It would be
formed for the purpose of maintain

ing such a center on behalf of a
public figure with a particular politi
cal philosophy," the statement said.
\ presidential center for public af
fairs, Kennedy said, "would in
evitably be viewed as connected
wirh the University."
"There can be no convincing as
surances that a center organized in
dependently of the University and
functioning merely as lessee would
be 'subject' to normal academic
governance," he said.
Another proposal, one version of
which was reportedly forwarded by
Hoover Institution officials at the
White House meeting, would be for
a board composed of both Univer
sity and Hoover officials to


"Mr. Meese has made it
plain . . . that academic
governance is not
merely a principle in
which he is
uninterested; it is one
he wishes actively to
reject
- Donald Kennedy
administer the center.
Rut Kennedy said, "Hybrid boards
and similar devices appear to pro
vide solutions, but they fail to pro
vide tor academic control — a
feature essential to the University
but asserted by the White House to
be completely unacceptable . . .
Responding to Kennedy's state
ment, Hoover Institution Director
W. Glenn Campbell said, "The
opinions expressed in his public
paper . . . are Dr. Kennedy's per
sonal views.
I have been aware of them for
some time on a private, confidential
basis."
A spokesman in Presidential
Counselor Edwin Meese's office
said, "Edwin Meese has no com
ment on Donald Kennedy's per
sonal statement."
The spokesman, however, said
that Meese has prepared a response
to last month's Board vote and that
it is "en route" from the White

House to Board of Trustees Presi
dent William Kimball. He said he did
not know when, how or in what
form it would arrive.
Kimball told The Daily yesterday
that he had not heard from the
White House since he spoke by tele
phone with Meese on Dec, 13 fol
lowing the unanimous Board vote
that any public affairs center should
be part of the University's normal
academic structure.
Kennedy's statement, Kimball
said, was prepared with his concur
rence and that of other members of
the trustees' Committee on the
Hoover Institution.
Kimball said he saw no chance
that the Board would approve a pro
posal that would allow an indepen
dent foundation to lease Stanford
land and build a Reagan policy cen
ter upon it.
A policy center won't be ap
proved by the Board, "unless it's
under Stanford governance," he
said.
Despite the fact that the White
House has repeatedly said it does
not want Stanford to run the center,
Kimball said he would not rule out

the prospect oi a Reagan center
someday coming to Stanford.
"What we're still hoping is that
they'll uncouple," he said, referring
to the University's long-time hope
that the White House would back
away from its insistence that Stan
ford accept or reject the complex as
a package deal including a library, a
museum and a Hoover-run public
affairs center.
In the statement, Kennedy also
disclosed for the first time publicly
that Meese told University officials
at the White House meeting that
"the president's interest in Stanford
University, beyond the Hoover Insti
tution, is 'zero.' "
"We have been told by (Meese),"
Kennedy said, "that he would be
derelict in his fiduciary duty if he
permitted the center to come under
faculty governance ....
"We find incomprehensible the
suggestion that this faculty, respon
sible for the entire academic mis
sion of a great university, cannot be
entrusted with the governance of
the proposed center," Kennedy
said.
