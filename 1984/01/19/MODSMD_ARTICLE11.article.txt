But the administration line
is that this kind of rationalizing
has been going on for too long
already, and you've got to
change sometime. After all,
three tickets is a crummy limit
for such a pomp-and
circumstance event. Folks
come to Commencement to
'■ee the place, and if they can't
because of population den
sity, then what's the point?
You might as well be at the
Physics Tank. My guess is that
the honchos upstairs waited
around tor some joggers to
take pity on the situation (hey
— it worked for the Oval),
and, finding none, finally
decided to take matters into
their own hands.
Speaking of the Oval, it now
looks as it it is out of the run
ning as a graduation site.
Which is probably just as well;
I couldn't imagine Don Ken
nedy taking a Marguerite up to
the bus stop to make a speech
to the graduates, and let's face
it, a parking lot is a parking lot,
no matter what the view. If
you want an uncomfortable
place that looks like it was
made for cars, go to the Inner
Quad.
(I'd like to break for a mo
ment to deal with this whole
Inner Quad business. Now I
like historical accuracy as
much as the next art student,
but if the Quad of the future is
as inhospitable as the present
one this Bug promises to start
campaigning for reconsidera
tion of the ban on motorized
vehicles. I'd rather look at a
'6b Mustang than concrete any
day.)
So the remaining choices

nothing ot the irresistible
temptation of firing a water
balloon. And how do you
keep the folks from camping
out the night before Big
Speech? Vou don't. And
there're splinters, too. Case
closed.
Another big drawback to
both sites — anywhere that
has chain link fencing as an in
tegral part of the environment
should be out. This is Stan
ford, not Soledad.
Which brings us back to
Frost. It's grassy, you can't see
the fences unless you try, and
moreover, you can't imagine
anything else going on in
there (except Dead concerts,
which remind me more and
more of old-wave Tupperware
parties than festivals).
So what do you do? Well,
when you have a hole in the
ground, like Frost, that isn't
big enough, like Frost, you dig
deeper. There's almost no
limit to the expansion, until
you hit oil or maybe a water
main. The name "Frost Can
yon" doesn't sound bad,
either — kinda Western, hm?
And the incline can't be any
worse than some of the more
precarious stairwells in old
Green Library.
Besides, unless someone
else digs up some more
"original designs" for Frost
and makes a ruckus, I can't
think of a better way to leave
Stanford — known as the
Winchester Mystery FHouse of
the North for its incessant
construction — than looking
up from a hole in the ground,
wearing a hard hat with a tas
sel.
