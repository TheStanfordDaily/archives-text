# Out Of Our Past

In this photograph from the early 19505, things are not quite how you
may remember them from the last time you were near Memorial
Auditorium. Tanner Fountain, that bastion of post-frosh-field-day-

dunkings, is missing, replaced by a parking lot. It seems that at Stanford,
it's a case where they tore down a parking lot and made paradise. Close
enough.
