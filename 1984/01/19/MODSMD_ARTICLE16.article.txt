## The 						Stanford Daily That terrible toxic waste 
### 
Lorraine Ross was used to the chemical smell
coming from the Fairchild Camera and Instru
ment Co. across the street from her San Jose
home. She wasn't ready to have her baby
daughter born with multiple heart defects,
however.
It would be six months after the birth of
Ross' child that residents of her neighborhood
would learn that a leak from Fairchild had been
contaminating their water. The culprit: toxic
waste.
Fairchild is only one of many Silicon Valley
firms that is known to have experienced leaks
of toxic wastes from their facilities. But the
danger in storing such hazardous materials
exists right here on campus, too.
In October 1982 a garbage truck driver
noticed that his load of garbage was afire and
immediately deposited it on the street between
the Stanford Museum and the orthopedic re
search laboratory. Firefighters arrived on the
scene to combat the blaze and one was
injured. Health and safety officials searched
through a ton of garbage to find out what
started the fire. The cause: flammable chemi
cals which had been dumped into trash cans.
The storage and disposal of hazardous
wastes is a serious problem, and one that can
not be ignored on a campus where there is
widespread use of toxic chemicals in labs and
research. For this reason we applaud the Uni
versity for allocating $6 million to build a waste
handling facility on campus. The effort was not
purely noble however: Federal and state laws
require that such a center be built.

Since 1982, the University has been getting
by with the use of a temporary site tor the
centralization of hazardous waste storage
before it is trucked out by contractors for dis
posal elsewhere at the Kettleman Hills dump
sites. But the University has run out of exten
sion time on its temporary toxic Band-Aid and
has found that it cannot delay the construction
of a permanent facility any longer.
Where to build such a facility on campus has
proven to be quite a volatile issue. Who wants
a toxic waste handling facility next to his
home?
Planners insist that the center's three build
ings would be safe, free from the danger of
leakage caused by anything — from vandalism
to earthquakes. Let's hope so. In addition, the
site is nearby many of the areas where hazar
dous wastes originate so that transporting
chemicals, etc., to the center should be less
risky than moving them to a more distant loca
tion.
The possible dangers associated with the
proposed center are only speculative, those of
the current waste storage set-up, well
founded. The University already shied away
from building the facility back in 1981, when
residents of Searsville Road first began protest
ing, and instead chose to erect the temporary
facility near the Med Center.
But radioactive half-life decay is a slow
process and the toxic waste problem has not
disappeared in a short few years. And it's not
about to start now unless we move ahead with
this project.
