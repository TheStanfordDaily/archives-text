# How much will you bid?

lines at the CPPC. Bid points. Interviews. Biting

your hair out.
"Augh! I'll never get a job."
It's an all too common winter-quarter cycle
here at Stanford, and indeed at colleges and
universities across the country. Students, com
pelled to abandon the allegedly carefree and
whimsical fancies which normally govern their
lives, are faced with "real" concerns: finding
that summer job, internship or, (tension, ten
sion), a permanent position.
The CPPC reports that job recruiters have
scheduled nearly twice as many interviews this
quarter than in the same period last year. Stu
dents thus have 3000 more interviews to con
sider this year, along with volumes of job and
internship offers to peruse. Whether this
means that the job outlook is brighter is
debatable; that student anxiety over future
plans is at a fevered pitch is certainly not
debatable.
Every year at about this time a wave of pre

protessionalism crashes onto campus. For us
to say, "Relax, don't worry, don't be so up
tight," might be nice, but it would be unrealis
tic and hypocritical. Good jobs now mean bet
ter jobs later, and we've all been taught to
strive for the best.
As the corporate responses begin rolling in
over the next few months, we all hope that the
inevitable rejections will be peppered with a
few acceptances. For every 10 "I'm sorry but
all our positions are filled," that you paste up
on your dorm room door, hopefully you have a
"Congratulations and welcome to our staff"
tucked away in a desk drawer.
But if you don't, it doesn't mean that you
have failed. Take a step back from this career
fest. Not everyone can get the best summer
jobs or starting positions. To nab the desirable
spots, you've got to plan ahead. You've got to
carefully calculate your CPPC bid point tally.
You've got to have a firm handshake and a sin
cere smile. You've got to know the right
people. And, most of all, you've got to be
lucky.
