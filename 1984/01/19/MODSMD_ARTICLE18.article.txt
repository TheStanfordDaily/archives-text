# Reagan's spacey ray guns
## 
### 
It is hard to criticize anything that
might make the Reagan administra
tion spend more money on scien
tific research. Any advantage
America might have over the Soviet
Union in arms is due to our techni
cal and scientific edge. Nonethe
less, despite the enormous growth
of the Pentagon's budget in the past
three years, military spending on
basic research has remained essen
tially level under Reagan. Funds for
research from the rest of the gov
ernment have of course been
slashed dramatically since 1981.
But the administration is about to
waste a staggering amount of money
on a major new scientific effort.
Reagan wants to spend multi
billions of dollars on space beam
weapons, which in theory would
shoot down incoming Soviet
missiles before they reach the
United States. Vet even if the admin
istration is successful, and even if
the death beams work just as ad
vertised, the United States will not
be any safer from nuclear attack
than if the project were scrapped
today.
The proposal sounds far-fetched:
The press immediately dubbed it
"the Star Wars project," but in fact
the scientific obstacles are not over
whelming. The basic concept is that
the United States would launch
hundreds of nuclear weapons into
space and wait for a Soviet missile
attack on America. Each U.S.
weapon would have a device which
would focus one of several particles
or rays emitted in a nuclear explo
sion. If the Soviets ever launched an
attack, then we would explode our
space weapons. The U.S. weapons
would create beams which would
then be aimed at the Soviet missiles
in mid-flight. The Soviet missiles
would be destroyed before they
ever reached the United States.

Focusing and aiming the rays
emitted in a nuclear explosion is a
formidable engineering challenge,
but not an impossible one. Perhaps
more of a challenge is the comput
ing and communications problem of
sighting all the Soviet rockets and
assigning one of our ray weapons to
destroy each missile. Since each of
our space weapons can only be fired
once, and the Soviets have
thousands of missiles, the magni
tude of the costs involved should be
apparent. We would need to build
and launch thousands of these
death-ray platforms to be safe from
Soviet attack.
The whole project is predicated
by the fact that Soviet missiles are
launched into space before re
entering the atmosphere to ex
plode. But the United States already
has, and the Soviets are developing,
nuclear cruise missiles fired from
submarines or bombers, which
never go higher than 10 feet off the
surface of the earth. Currently, such
missiles could be launched under
cloud cover, and satellites in space
would never know about it. Even if
our space weapons could sense
these cruise missiles, the beams
now being considered for use,
photon lasers and X-ray beams, dis
sipate their strength when shot
through the atmosphere. The
Soviets can simply reduce their cur
rent high-altitude missiles and in
crease the number of low-altitude
cruise missiles, and the United
States will be no safer from attack
than it is today.
Even if the United States can solve
both the problems of sighting and
shooting down Soviet cruise
missiles, the space weapons will still
ultimately fail. It will always be
cheaper for the Soviet Union to
build small nuclear missiles than it
will be for us to build the nuclear

anti-missile bombs and the focusing
devices, to launch them into space
and to run the sensing and commu
nications systems that will link the
space platforms.
We have enough trouble keeping
up with the U.S.S.R. when both
countries are just building missiles.
We gain no advantage by switching
unilaterally to these more expensive
anti-missile weapons, while they still
build and stockpile comparatively
cheap missiles. If Reagan desperate
ly needs to spend a few hundred bil
lion dollars, I can think of a few bet
ter ways to spend it than putting ray
guns in space.
