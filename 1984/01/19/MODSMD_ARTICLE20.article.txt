## Zetes appeal to the community 
### 
After a year of petitioning and meeting with Univer
sity officials, Zeta Psi was granted recognition last
Friday. As officers and members of Zeta Psi, we feel
compelled to correct some inaccuracies reported in
The Daily regarding the recognition as well as relate our
current motives and status in the Stanford community.
Once again we find our position as a fraternity very
much in the public eye, and justifiably so, as we are
working closely with University officials in forming a
new, autonomous group. Moreover, we realize that
public opinion is very important for our purposes as
well as influencing University decisions regarding Zeta
Psi's progress. It is in this spirit that we wish to address
several key issues as reported and editorialized in The
Daily in recent days.
By far our greatest concern lies with The Daily's
penchant for emphasizing negative aspects of the
fraternity as well as some of the problems we encoun
tered as an unrecognized fraternity trying to sustain it
self and reorganize. Unfortunately, Zeta Psi's quarterly
community service projects and contributions to the
University have been all but ignored by The Daily.
Granted, this is often a characteristic of journalism in
general, e.g. a person is reported as being suspected of
a crime, yet discovers that the media takes no notice
when he is cleared. But what is most distressing is the
manner in which our problems have been reported —
presented as hard facts without regard to extenuating
circumstances or explanations. Some of these incidents
are misleading as reported, and warrant clarification:
• "Assault arid battery charges levied against a Zeta Psi
member" were reported, yet there was no mention of
the fact that the charges were subsequently dropped.
• Due to an error in a Governor's Corner residential
report, Row Director Diana Conklin was incorrectly in
formed that six Zetes living in a suite last spring had

provided the impetus tor a 34-page damage report. The
Daily received the same erroneous information, so no
one is to blame. However, there were only two Zetes
living in that residence, and the other tour residents
each received higher damage charges at the end of the
year than did the two Zetes.
•It was reported that, following a Zete off-campus rush
party, a Branner freshman was left unconscious on the
dormitory lawn, and two other freshman returned
drunk and belligerent." First of all, our witness
reports indicated that the particular freshman returned
to his dorm and subsequently left again after the Zete
member had driven off. More importantly, it' fratei
nities are expected to monitor the drinking habits ot
rushees, then the IFC and the University must take a
firm stand on alcohol in regard to rush. Zeta Psi vio
lated no rules regarding alcohol and non-alcoholic al
ternatives. At least it should be noted, to our credit,
that Zeta Psi takes the time and effort to drive rushees
home safely after parties.
Since the suspension, Zeta Psi has performed
numerous community service projects. In addition to a
jog-a-thon to benefit the C.A.R. Swim Center, Zeta Psi
has staffed Stanford Special Olympics, hosted a sherry
hour/dinner with a Stanford trustee, volunteered
services for the Big Came Rally Monitors, and helped
renovate facilities at a Senior Citizen's Services Home
in Menlo Park. These projects are part of an ongoing
process dedicated to assuming more responsibility and
bettering relations with the community. Zeta Psi has
much to offer Stanford. We hope the community will
receive us with an open mind.
