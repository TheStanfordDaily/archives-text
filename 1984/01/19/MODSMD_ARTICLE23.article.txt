## Paye to start for first time No horsing around for Card at USC 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Though only a freshman,
Stanford's John Paye will be in
a familiar situation when he
takes the floor in the Los An
geles Sports Arena tonight
against USC.
It was only last November
when Paye took the field in
the Los Angeles Coliseum, just
yards from the Sports Arena,
as Stanford's starting quarter
back against USC, a game the
Card lost, 30-7.
Paye, a point guard, again
will start as Stanford's
"quarterback," but this time it
will be in a different sport.
Paye also hopes something
else will be different. The
result.
So does Head Basketball
Coach Tom Davis, whose Car
dinal team is 0-4 in the rugged
Pacific-10 Conference and
already looking down the bar
rel of a loaded gun.
"What we're confronted
with is that we're playing
pretty well in most areas of the
game," he said, "but we've
had some key problems."
One of those problems has
been backcourt leadership,
something that became all too
apparent in Stanford's most
recent Pac-10 loss to UC-
Berkeley last Friday, 66-64,
when the Card muffed
numerous last-minute oppor
tunites to win the game.
Davis hopes Paye, who so
far has acted as sophomore
Keith Ramee's backup at
point guard, will use his quar
terbacking experience from
the football field and apply it
to the basketball court. Accor
ding to Stanford Co-Sports In
formation Director Steve Rac
zynski, Paye will be the first
freshman ever to start both a
basketball and a football game
in NCAA Division I history.
"Keith Ramee has done a
fine job for us," Davis said
Wednesday after practice,
"but I think he might have
tried to do too much. I think
Keith will play a little more
relaxed coming off the
bench."
While one Stanford point
guard moved up, another,
senior Ricky Lewis, moved in
the other direction. In fact,
Lewis moved completely off
the team when he quit last
Sunday.
The only other change in
Davis' starting line-up will be
at the small forward position,
where Andy Fischer will return
to the first five since regular
Steve Brown missed Tuesday's
practice with a sprained finger
on his shooting hand. X-rays
taken on the finger were

negative and Brown will suit
up for tonight's game.
To get back into the Pac-10
race (Stanford is already four
games behind the leader),
Davis and company probably
will have to win two of its next
three games.
That is much easier said than
done, though, especially
when two of those next three
opponents are No. 11 ranked
Oregon State and league
leader Washington. Stanford
plays Oregon State in Corvallis
next Monday and hosts Wash
ington the following Thursday
night.
But first things first. "You
have to win your first league
game before you can start
thinking about win number
two," Davis said.
Tonight's game with USC —
6-11 overall and 1-3 in the Pac

10 — takes on even moie im
portance because it should
test Stanford's true character,
whether it will sink or swim in
the competitive Pac-10 after an
0-4 start.
Davis, however, already
thinks he knows the answer.
"I don't think they'll fold. I
think I've seen enough of this
team to know that."
Something else Davis has
certainly seen enough of is
Stanford's tendency to come
back from seemingly insur
mountable deficits late in the
game and then choke when it
finally has a chance to win, the
case in three of the Card's
four Pac-10 losses.
"I guess you've got to go
through it a few times and
screw it up," he said. "It's a
learning process. That's what
we're trying to stress — to

learn from our mistakes."
Another coach whose
players are doing a lot of
learning this season is USC's
Stan Morrison. The Trojans'
15-man roster includes seven
freshman, three sophomores
and four juniors. Cedric
Bailey, a 6-foot-7 forward, is
the only senior.
Morrison lost AII-Pac-10
point guard Jacque Hill and
muscular forward james
McDonald and their
combined 21 points a game to
graduation. Morrison s 1982-
83 team went 17-11, but was
not invited to a post-season
tournament.
USC's steadiest player this
year is 6-8 junior forward
Wayne Carlander, leading the
Trojans in both points, 14.1,
and rebounds, 6.1, per game.

One of the key points for Stanford in tonight's game at USC will be stopping Trojan forward
Wayne Carlander, USC's leading scorer and rebounder. Stanford, 11-5 overall, but 0-4 in the
Pacific-10 Conference, is still looking for its first league victory.
Carlander will be joined by 6-5
Ron Holmes (13.1 points) at
the forward spot, while Bailey
and 5-11 sophomore Larry
Friend are expected to get the
call at guard.

Who will start at center is
still undecided, although 6-9
freshman Charlie Simpson has
started the last two games and
has the inside track to start his
third. However, 6-10 junior
Clayton Olivier or 6-6 fresh
man Derrick Dowell could
crack the first five tonight.
USC's 6-11 record is deceiv
ing in that the Trojans are 6-3

in Los Angeles and 5-3 in the
Sports Arena, where the game
will be played tonight. USC
played its only Pac-10 home
game, a 71-61 victory over
Arizona, in The Forum be
cause of a scheduling conflict.
USC has yet to win on the
road.
The Trojans were blown out
in two of their three Pac-10
losses, 80-49 by Oregon and
65-48 by Arizona State. In its
most recent outing, though,
USC played Oregon State
tough and only lost by six
points, 51-45, in Corvallis.
Card notes
Stanford and USC split their
two games last season, with
each team winning at home.
The Card won first at Maples
Pavilion, 92-74, but the Trojans
rebounded in the Sports
Arena later in the season, 90-
76.
The last time Stanford beat
USC in the Sports Arena was
in 1976, when the Dick
Dißiaso-coached Cardinal was

on the upper end of a 86-75
score. The Trojans are 30-7 in
the Sports Arena dating back
to the start of the 1982 cam
paign.
Stanford, bolstered by its
easy pre-Pac-IO schedule, led
the nation last week in team
field goal percentage with a
.573 figure. Oregon was
second at .561. The Cardinal,
however, dropped to .564
after losses to UCLA and Cal.
This week's NCAA statistics are
yet to be released.
