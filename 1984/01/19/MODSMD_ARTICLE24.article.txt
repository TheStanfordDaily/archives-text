# Water polo, fencing upgraded
## Geiger alters proposal 
### ADAM BERNS 
Stanford University Athletic Director Andy
Geiger proposed Tuesday that the water
polo team remain a Varsity I sport under the
new three-tier proposal and that men's and
women's fencing, which are currently var
sity sports, be moved from the third tier
(Club Sports) to the second tier (Varsity II),
thus remaining varsity sports.
Ihese recommendations were made to
the Committee on Athletics, Physical Educ
tion and Recreation (CAPR) at a meeting
Tuesday night. Geiger also reaffirmed that
sailing would remain self-supporting.
The three-tiered system, which will prob
ably be voted on by the Board of Trustees in
February, involves dividing sports into three
levels of University support. Varsity I sports
have full-time coaching, recruiting and
scholarships. Varsity II sports have part-time
coaches and no scholarships, while Varsity
111 sports get no University support and will
be similar to what Club Sports are now.
"That's my plan, that fencing be moved
from Varsity 111 status to Varsity II status and
that water polo will go from the II to the I
level," Geiger said yesterday. "Sailing will
continue to be self-supporting. All of this is
still transition. This is not final. Sailing has
done well on its own and we will continue to
use that. I wanted to keep fencing at the II
level so that we would be able to keep staff.
"I've gone over past records and consid
ered the responses from my previous re
commendation. It (these changes) are part
of a total effort to support as much athletics
as we are capable of."
Geiger did admit, however, that there
could be some cutbacks in track forthcom
ing.
While Assoc. Athletic Director Pam Strat
horne said that no mention of track cutbacks
was made at the meeting, she confirmed
Geiger's position on water polo and fen
cing. "Mr. Geiger indicated to the group
that he would do everything he possibly
could to put water polo in the Varsity I
group," Strathorne said. "He also said that
he overlooked some information which
made it inappropriate to make fencing a
club sport."
Cardinal water polo Coach Dante Detta
manti who had heard rumors of the CAPR
meeting seemed pleased with the outcome,
but was cautious in optimism.
"It was simply a plan, not a final deci
sion," Dettamanti said about Geiger's
original decision to drop water polo to Var
sity II status. "He wanted input on the plan.
Somebody said that the decision has been
made to move us up to the Varsity I level,
but we would probably still have some re
strictions.
"I'll have different teaching and adminis
trative chores. I might also have to raise
money for travel outside of the local area.
But regaining the scholarships is the most
important thing. I can do without the other
things. I can teach and I can raise money,
but I can't replace the scholarships."
Geiger confirmed yesterday that under his
proposal the water polo team would have its
scholarships and things would remain as
they currently are. The only change might
be the added teaching duties imposed on
Dettamanti.

Ironically, it may have been Geiger's activ
ities at the last meeting of the NCAA which
not only led to the change in Stanford's fun
ding for the sport, but possibly saved the
sport as an NCAA-sanctioned event.
"There have been four or five sports in
the NCAA which have been close to losing
their national sponsorship," Dettamanti
said. "Seven percent of the schools in the
NCAA have to play your sport. While the
number of schools with water polo pro
grams has remained steady, the total num
ber of schools in the NCAA has increased.
Perhaps the threat of no NCAA sponsorship
led to his (Geiger's) original decision.
"That problem was solved in the NCAA
convention (Jan. 10). Andy Geiger got the
Pac-10 to sponsor legislation that would al
low for sports to bypass the 7-percent rule if
it was an Olympic sport. After that, he prob
ably thought as long as there was going to
be an NCAA championship, we might as
well go for it."

Dettamanti also emphasized that Geiger
was on the NCAA Rules Committee for
water polo and had played a major part
keeping the sport going on an intercol
legiate level by constantly talking with
schools that had water polo as a club sport,
encouraging them to go varsity. He also in
troduced legislation in 1982 which extended
water polo's NCAA sanction through this
year.
Stanford Head Fencing Coach Buzz Hurst,
who stood to lose his job if fencing had not
been moved up to Varsity II status, said yes
terday that he was delighted by the decision.
According to Hurst, Varsity II status will es
sentially keep fencing at its current level.
"We have always been sort of at a level
II," Hurst said. Our budget is miniscule
compared with other sports. Our budget is
only a wart on the Athletic Department's fin
ancial picture. I would have the expectation
that we will now stay pretty much where we
are at now.
"I have no scholarships for the men and
only one for the women which has been
split between two people. None of these
(lack of scholarships under Division II) will
effect our ability to put out a competitive
team. We do have the largest booster fund
of any sport on campus."
After learning of the initial decision to cut
fencing, Hurst said that the major source of
support for his teams came from the
Swordsmaster Booster Club and the United
States Olympic Committee.
