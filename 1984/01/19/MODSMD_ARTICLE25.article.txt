# Doing time on the Stanford pine isn't too bad at all

### TRASK LEONARD 
When the Cardinal basketball
team beats a tough opponent, the
fans go wild, and tine top few players
get most of the attention. However,
at the end of the bench, usually un
recognized, sit players who do
much more for the program than
just ride the pine.
It's difficult eyeing most of the ac
tion from the sidelines, and even
more difficult not not suiting up for
most of the games. Accordingly,
only those tough individuals with
bright outlooks play the the sup
porting roles in Coach Tom Davis'
cast.
For some players the hope of
future success on the red team,
which consists of the top few
players, is enough incentive to
remain on the gray team, which in
cludes the rest of the squad. John
"Scooter" Williams, a sophomore,
works out every day with the red
squad in hopes of developing his
game to the point where he can join
it permanently.

'Our main function is
clearly to contribute to
the program by playing
hard against the red
team. Of course, our
opportunities are quite
limited, but we all
understand that. The
thrill consists of playing
Division I basketball/
-Steve Phillips

"Sure, I'm aiming for the red team
eventually. And that's the main rea
son for my being here," said Wil
liams. "While I'm on the gray team,
however, I can work hard in a
healthfully competitive atmosphere.
It gives me a chance to identify my
weaknesses by playing every day
against a player like Keith Jones and
hence to be able to work on them."

Grady Johnson, another player on
scholarship yet seeing limited ac
tion, agrees with Williams. "I'm
hoping for a spot on the red team
later in my career. But I'm quite hap
py right now, being a freshman and
improving against some great
players. We're not out there just to
help ourselves, however. We're out
on the court mainly to help the red
team prepare for the next game,"
explained Johnson.
Steve Phillips, a sophomore for
ward, would second that opinion.

"Our main function is clearly to
contribute to the program by
playing hard against the red team
Of course, our opportunities are
quite limited, but we all understand
that. The thrill consists of playing
Division I basketball, even if we
don't see much action in games.
Vet, I'm still hoping to be with the
reds some day," said Phillips.
When these players do get playing
time, however, the pressure to
impress the coaching staff naturalK
exists.

Neil lohnson. a junior who has
been with the squad for two years,
feels that the pressure is all self
imposed.
"I do feel that I have to demon
strate my abilities under pressure
situations, like games, to the staff,
so that I can prove competent in
such a situation. Yet without the
desire to move up, we'd have no in
centive, and I think that's a very im
portant part of Coach Davis' pro
gram," said Johnson.
Other players take different views

on this pressure.
Williams, for instance, believes
the pressure exists only in practice.
"During practice each day, we are
working hard to knock off the red
team. That's how we move up on
the team. Yet when I play a game, I
don't sense it at all. The games are
the funnest part of it all," observed
Williams.
Going a step further, Grady
Johnson holds that there is really no
pressure at all.
"If I mess up in practice, I can al

ways work on it the next day. That's
the purpose of practice, not to be at
each other's throats," said Johnson.
A few players, although possess
ing long-range goals of advancing to
the red team, feel quite fortunate
and content to be exactly where
they are. For them, the love of the
game is enough to keep them going
every day.

'I'm just thankful to be
on the team at all. I'd
love to be on the red
team eventually, but
right now just
dedication and love for
basketball are enough to
bring me out to practice
every day.'
- Charles Schwager

"I'm just thankful to be on the
team at all," stated freshman walk
on Charles Schwager. "I'd love to
be on the red team eventually, but
right now just dedication and love
for basketball are enough to bring
me out to practice every day. I
realize it's very tough to make the
red team as a walk-on. Andy Fischer
was certainly the exception. Yet,
with extra work this summer, I'm
going to give it a shot. I'm still just a
freshman soaking up the action,
though," said Schwager.
He, too, realizes the ultimate pur
pose of the gray team.
"Our job is to work with the other
guys to try to give them some tough
competition. We know we've done
our job when Coach Davis yells at
the red players; we've found a
weakness for them to concentrate
on," continued Schwager.
Meanwhile, aside from the overall
purpose of their existence, and for
the chance to play for the red team,
some gray players noticed other
benefits. When asked why he came
out for the gray team, freshman Joe
Watson responded, "For the
shoes."
