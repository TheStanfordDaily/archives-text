### PETER CASTILLO 
In a season full of disappointment for
the Stanford wrestling team, the Cardinal
had an emotional victory losing to San
Francisco State, 22-20, last night. It was
the 10th loss of the season against only
four wins for Stanford.
"Going into the match I expected to
lose, maybe by a large margin, so I was
pleased with the team's performance,"
said Cardinal Coach Chris Horpel. "We
won all the mental battles and I noticed
an improving technique among our ath
letes. The team's conditioning has im
proved with the morning workouts and I
am happy with the continual improve

ment the wrestlers are showing."
Bert Fukunaga (118 pounds) has had
trouble making his weight recently and
his 5-4 loss reflected this. Bob Spurlock
(167 pounds) returned to the line-up for
the first time this season, after recovering
from pneumonia, and lost 12-6.
Also returning to the line-up was Jeff
Bradley (142 pounds), recovered from a
pulled tendon in his elbow, who won 11-
4. In another strong showing, Jody Wil
liams (167 pounds) won 15-6 and Scott
Wiggen (150 pounds) posted a 7-6 victory.
The best Stanford wrestler of the eve
ning was Bill George (126 pounds), who
demolished his opponent 20-6. At 190

pounds Kurt Kassulke tied 4-4, which gave
Stanford a 20-16 lead with just one match
left.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, though,
injuries again worked against the team, as
it was forced to forfeit the heavyweight
match, giving San Francisco State the six
points it needed for victory.
In a unique exhibition, the current
world champion, Assistant Coach Dave
Shultz wrestled against the nation's sixth
ranked heavyweight from San Francisco
and won 9-0, although he gave away more
than 35 pounds.
Stanford goes on the road igain Satur
day to face Cal-State Bakersfield.
