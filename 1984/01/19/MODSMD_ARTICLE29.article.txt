Blowing a Ball and Dunking a Bubble . . . The Harlem Globetrotters invade Maples
Pavilion Saturday afternoon for a 1 p.m. showing of their world-famous basketball
wizardry. The proceeds from the event will help fund Club Sports at Stanford. The
Globetrotters are almost a sure bet to win, as they sport a career record of 15,669-331,
a .979 winning percentage. Fred "Curly" Neal will be on hand for the Trotters' annual
Bay Area appearance.
