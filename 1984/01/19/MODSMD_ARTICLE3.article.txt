# Defense-funded research increasing
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Staff writer 
Defense-related research funding
here has risen at a faster rate than
other federal research programs, ac
cording to statistics released by the
Sponsored Projects Office.
And experts here are divided on
whether the rise in defense-related
research is changing the nature of
the University.
Peter Hochschild, a member of
the University's Committee on Re
search and a graduate student in
computer science, warns that rising

levels of research funding from mili
tary sources threaten to turn the
University into a "weapons lab."
Hochschild pointed to increases
in Department of Defense funding
at Stanford over the past five years
— from $9.7 million in 1978 to $28.4
million in 1983 — as cause for con
cern.
Pat Devaney, associate dean of
graduate studies and research,
agreed that defense-oriented re
search funding had grown and had
accompanied a "decline in social
science research" funding. Devaney

said this trend is "a reflection of the
priorities of the current administra
tion in Washington."
Devaney, however, disagrees with
the assertion that the University is in
danger of becoming a military
workshop. "As long as the Univer
sity is not engaged in classified re
search, we cannot be called a weap
ons lab," she said.
Stanford adopted a policy in the
late 60s that precludes the Univer
sity from taking part in classified re
search.
Hochschild claims that the Uni

versity is in danger of becoming
subservient to "mission-oriented
agencies" such as the Department
of Defense, NASA and Department
of Energy.
"In high-tech departments
(computer science, electrical engi
neering, applied physics, statistics),
I think you can make a case that the
University is becoming a weapons
lab," he said.
Devaney pointed out that the
Committee on Research reported
