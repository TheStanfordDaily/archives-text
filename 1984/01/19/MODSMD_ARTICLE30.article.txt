### STEPHAN MALMOLI 
ALIVE, she cried
The Doors
Kiecktra Records

The Lizard King lives! Alive, She Cried
|s the title of the Doors' "new" live al
bum, and to put it modestly, it is mag
nificent. The album culls unreleased live
material from the latter part of the '60s
and it proves to be the finest, and most
dynamic music ever presented by the
Doors on record. It truly captures the es-
Isence of rock-and-roll, and the essence of
Jim Morrison and the Doors.
Without a doubt, this is the greatest live
album released since the Who's Live at

Leeds LP from 1970. It showcases a classic
band in the prime of its career, when
it sounds as vital and contemporary as ever.
Unlike their previously released live al
bum, Absolutely Live (1970), this album is
full of the magical intensity of the Doors.
Absolutely Live catered to excess, and
was erratic, drawn-out, and less than in
spiring. Even Morrison's vocals sounded
strained and shot. However, Alive, She
Cried is the Doors as the legends pur
ported them to be. The band has never
sounded this powerful and innovative,
and Morrison is in electrifying shape,
both vocally and mentally. Finally, this
legend is caught live on record.
To begin with, this is a rock-and-roll al
bum. No celebrations to lizards or

eulogies to Oedipus on this album. No
stoned out, drunken ramblings or flash
ing here. Instead, the focus is on the
music and the music alone. What we get
is alive and mesmerizing rock-and-roll,
with a total emphasis on sex, joy, youth
and rebellion. It encompasses everything
that rock has stood for and will ever stand
for. It is the driving musical vision of four
musicians — not just ]im Morrison and a
back-up band — all creating a sound that
proves why the Doors were the most
lauded American band of the '60s.
The album explodes open with a seven
minute soundcheck version of "Gloria,"
the old Van Morrison and Them tune.
This classic song has been covered

numerous times by some of the finest of
bands, but nevertheless, this version
somehow is the greatest one yet. Mor
rison fully captures the song's sexual ten
sion and mood with one of his finest vo
cals ever. As the album's liner notes ac
curately express: "Gloria" was pure
release for the band . . . Here was an
other side of the Doors: Celebrating the
endurance of the simple urge to rock."
The Doors have never performed so to
gether and tight as a group on this rendi
tion. Never have Morrison's vocals
sounded so playful and free, which is es
pecially evident when he coyly ad-libs,
"Here she is in my room-Oh, Boy-Hey,
what's your name-How old are you?-
Where'd you go to school-Uh, huh, oh,

yeah-Now that we know each other a little
better, why don't you come over here
and ... and make me feel all right." And if
that isn't good enough, the song ends
with a cry that will rank as Morrison's
finest scream ever. (Yes, even better than
the screech he emits during "When The
Music's Over.")
That's only for starters. Next is a 10-
minute version of "Light My Fire" that is
far more hypnotic than the original studio
version. Ray Manzarek's keyboards and
Robbie Krieger's guitar work interplay
with one another to such an astonishing
degree that it fully shows off the magnetic
talents which the members of the band
possessed. Likewise, ]ohn Densmore's
drumming is sharply executed and never
misses a beat once, always following the
unpredictable shifts in musical moods
that Morrison was prone to take without
warning.
Furthermore, the album continually
surprises me, as well, in regard to the
Doors' musical skills. For instance, "You
Make Me Real" (originally from 1970s
Morrison Hotel LP) is done up soul style
(in fact, Krieger's guitar is directly copped
from the horn riffs on Otis Redding's "I
Can't Turn You Loose,") while the
remake of the blues classic "little Red
Rooster" (recorded in New York with
john Sebastian of Lovin' Spoonful fame
guesting on harmonica) remind-, the lis
tener of just how exciting the Doors
could be when they played straight blues.
(And when Morrison sings the lines, "The
dogs begin to bark, the hounds begin to
howl" and you hear his orgasmic barks
and howls followed by the orgasmic barks
and howls followed by the orgasmic
screams of the teeny boppers in the audi
ence, you realize that this was an act that
had to be reckoned with on a visual scale
as well.)
The rest of the album is reserved for
Doors' originals. These include a sly com
bination of "Moonlight Drive" and
"Horse Latitudes" (which showcases
Krieger's finest slide guitar work found
on this record), along with an early 1968
Danish TV show appearance where the
Doors performed "Texas Radio and the
Big Best" (which didn't appear in album
form until three years later on the L.A.
Woman album) and the sexually happy
"Love Me Two Times."
So, if you haven't figured it out already
by this ecstatic review of the album, get it
anyway. It is an album that cuts through
and dismisses all of the rumors written
about ]im Morrison and the Doors. It
presents them in a purely musical con
text. You don't have to read the question
able "No One Here Gets Out Alive" or try
to decipher the meaning behind the "Soft
Parade" to comprehend the full purpose
and musical grandeur of Morrison and
the Doors. On Alive, She Cried it all can
be found in the pure unadulterated form.
It is one of rock's finest hours. Alive, She
Cried- Indeed!

rison fully captures the song's sexual ten
sion and mood with one of his finest vo
cals ever. As the album's liner notes ac
curately express: "Gloria" was pure
release for the band . . . Here was an
other side of the Doors: Celebrating the
endurance of the simple urge to rock."
The Doors have never performed so to
gether and tight as a group on this rendi
tion. Never have Morrison's vocals
sounded so playful and free, which is es
pecially evident when he coyly ad-libs,
"Here she is in my room-Oh, Boy-Hey,
what's your name-How old are you?-
Where'd you go to school-Uh, huh, oh,

yeah-Now that we know each other a little
better, why don't you come over here
and ... and make me feel all right." And if
that isn't good enough, the song ends
with a cry that will rank as Morrison's
finest scream ever. (Yes, even better than
the screech he emits during "When The
Music's Over.")
That's only for starters. Next is a 10-
minute version of "Light My Fire" that is
far more hypnotic than the original studio
version. Ray Manzarek's keyboards and
Robbie Krieger's guitar work interplay
with one another to such an astonishing
degree that it fully shows off the magnetic
talents which the members of the band
possessed. Likewise, ]ohn Densmore's
drumming is sharply executed and never
misses a beat once, always following the
unpredictable shifts in musical moods
that Morrison was prone to take without
warning.
Furthermore, the album continually
surprises me, as well, in regard to the
Doors' musical skills. For instance, "You
Make Me Real" (originally from 1970s
Morrison Hotel LP) is done up soul style
(in fact, Krieger's guitar is directly copped
from the horn riffs on Otis Redding's "I
Can't Turn You Loose,") while the
remake of the blues classic "little Red
Rooster" (recorded in New York with
john Sebastian of Lovin' Spoonful fame
guesting on harmonica) remind-, the lis
tener of just how exciting the Doors
could be when they played straight blues.
(And when Morrison sings the lines, "The
dogs begin to bark, the hounds begin to
howl" and you hear his orgasmic barks
and howls followed by the orgasmic barks
and howls followed by the orgasmic
screams of the teeny boppers in the audi
ence, you realize that this was an act that
had to be reckoned with on a visual scale
as well.)
The rest of the album is reserved for
Doors' originals. These include a sly com
bination of "Moonlight Drive" and
"Horse Latitudes" (which showcases
Krieger's finest slide guitar work found
on this record), along with an early 1968
Danish TV show appearance where the
Doors performed "Texas Radio and the
Big Best" (which didn't appear in album
form until three years later on the L.A.
Woman album) and the sexually happy
"Love Me Two Times."
So, if you haven't figured it out already
by this ecstatic review of the album, get it
anyway. It is an album that cuts through
and dismisses all of the rumors written
about ]im Morrison and the Doors. It
presents them in a purely musical con
text. You don't have to read the question
able "No One Here Gets Out Alive" or try
to decipher the meaning behind the "Soft
Parade" to comprehend the full purpose
and musical grandeur of Morrison and
the Doors. On Alive, She Cried it all can
be found in the pure unadulterated form.
It is one of rock's finest hours. Alive, She
Cried- Indeed!

ALIVE, she cried
The Doors
Kiecktra Records

The Lizard King lives! Alive, She Cried
|s the title of the Doors' "new" live al
bum, and to put it modestly, it is mag
nificent. The album culls unreleased live
material from the latter part of the '60s
and it proves to be the finest, and most
dynamic music ever presented by the
Doors on record. It truly captures the es-
Isence of rock-and-roll, and the essence of
Jim Morrison and the Doors.
Without a doubt, this is the greatest live
album released since the Who's Live at

Leeds LP from 1970. It showcases a classic
band in the prime of its career, when
it sounds as vital and contemporary as ever.
Unlike their previously released live al
bum, Absolutely Live (1970), this album is
full of the magical intensity of the Doors.
Absolutely Live catered to excess, and
was erratic, drawn-out, and less than in
spiring. Even Morrison's vocals sounded
strained and shot. However, Alive, She
Cried is the Doors as the legends pur
ported them to be. The band has never
sounded this powerful and innovative,
and Morrison is in electrifying shape,
both vocally and mentally. Finally, this
legend is caught live on record.
To begin with, this is a rock-and-roll al
bum. No celebrations to lizards or

eulogies to Oedipus on this album. No
stoned out, drunken ramblings or flash
ing here. Instead, the focus is on the
music and the music alone. What we get
is alive and mesmerizing rock-and-roll,
with a total emphasis on sex, joy, youth
and rebellion. It encompasses everything
that rock has stood for and will ever stand
for. It is the driving musical vision of four
musicians — not just ]im Morrison and a
back-up band — all creating a sound that
proves why the Doors were the most
lauded American band of the '60s.
The album explodes open with a seven
minute soundcheck version of "Gloria,"
the old Van Morrison and Them tune.
This classic song has been covered

numerous times by some of the finest of
bands, but nevertheless, this version
somehow is the greatest one yet. Mor
rison fully captures the song's sexual ten
sion and mood with one of his finest vo
cals ever. As the album's liner notes ac
curately express: "Gloria" was pure
