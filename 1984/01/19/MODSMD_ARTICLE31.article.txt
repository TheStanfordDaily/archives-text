The records that appear here are those that
the music staff at KZSU feels have exception
al merit. Tracks off these albums are high-
Beauty Stab
ABC
Beauty Stab, ABC's follow-up to The Lexi
con of Love, is definitely not a "son of Lexi
con." It has in fact been described as per
verse, by no less perverse an individual than
julie Birch ill of London's New Musical Ex
press. Beauty Stab certainly breaks new
ground for Fry, Singleton and White, being a
very guitar-oriented, but otherwise sparse
sound.
Beauty Stab takes some getting used to,
but it is a worthwhile endeavour. If this al
bum is an attempt to reach an older audi
ence then it certainly hasn't sacrificed any of
the melodic appeal of the "Look of Love"
era but rather addresses some more, um,
serious topics such as sexuality ("Unzip"),
England as the industrial backwash of
Europe ("UNITED KINGDOM"), avarice
("King Money"), the anti-climax of filling
the luxury gap ("Hey Citizen"), and the in
sidious nature of advertising ("Power of Per
suasion").
The love songs are still there too, with

lighted during ZOO Preview airing Tuesdays
from 5-fl p.m. and on Dance for Your Dinner
Thursdays from 5-8 p.m.

Martin Fry (who makes Bryan Ferry look as if
he does his clothes-shopping at the local
hardware store), crooning for all his worth.
All-in-all a very interesting and well-written
album paying homage to a simpler rock
style. What next, Martin, punkabilly?
