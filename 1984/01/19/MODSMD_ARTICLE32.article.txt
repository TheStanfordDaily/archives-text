# This Charming Man
## 
### 
Finally we come to the group which wins
the "flashiest name in decades" award, The
Smiths. Again, very trendy, new and British,
it's difficult to tell whether The Smiths have
substantial talent or are one (actually two)
hit wonders. Their brand of tinny '60s pop
sounds remarkably contemporary and is
unique enough, but their singer, Morrissey
sounds like Nick Heyward on a bad day,
pretentious to say the least.
Nevertheless, "This Charming Man," the
A-side of the EP, is a very catchy pop song
with rather off-beat, charming (or just silly?)
lyrics and a great Motown bass line, reminis
cent of The Jam's "Town Called Malice."
The other two songs, on the B-side, are less
appealing however and cast an ominous
shadow over the whole EP. Wimps or
toughies? The verdict will have to wait on
this one.
