# This Are Two Tone Collection
## 
### 
This collection of hits from Walt Jabsco's
2-Tone label features the best of the pop/ska
bands that have come out of England in the
past several years — the Selecter, Madness,
the English Beat, Rico and the Specials are all
crowded onto one album.
The musicians on the 2-Tone label were
culled from the dancehalls and discos of the
London area beginning back in 1979. They
were a racially mixed group — each band
featured black and white members and a
sound that reflected this mix. The 13 tracks
on This Arc Two Tone were all big hits in the
U.K., but did not receive similar air-play in
America. Of the five artists gathered here,
only the English Beat achieved much
recognition over here. Don't let that deter
you, though — even if you aren't familiar

with the music, you shouldn't find it too dif
ficult to appreciate the energy and fun that
this album represents.
