# 'Heart Like a Wheel' spins predictably
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The initially appealing
modesty of Heart Like a
Wheel, the biography of Shir
ley Muldowney — the only
driver ever to win the National
Hot Rod Association World
Championship three times —
is what makes it such a limited
and, finally, unmemorable
movie.
ken Friedman's script has
clarity and narrative logic and
even polish, and the director,
lonathan Kaplan, demon
strates intelligence and an
unfussy control of the ac
tors of the material. He has
learned a great deal about
tocus and acquired some
storytelling skills since his last
theatrical film, the 1979 Over
the Edge, a study in suburban
adolescence that had the
virtues of unpretentiousness
and a lack of sentimentality
and not much else (except a
fresh, untutored performance
by 14-year-old Matt Dillon).
Heart Like a Wheel, lit by the

fine cinematographer Tak
Fujimoto (Melvin and
Howard), has a clean, classi
cally small-town American
look, and the major emotional
encounters are staged
shrewdly and economically.
But Kaplan and Friedman
show a worse deficiency than
sloppy craftsmanship or
histrionic excessiveness: They
have ordinarv eyes. Heart Like
a Wheel keeps leading us into
settings and situations that
promise quirky, revealing
details — the grounds of hot
rod races in New York and
New lersey, a hospital room
where Shirley (Bonnie
Bedelia) is recuperating after a
near-fatal wreck, a motel cot
tee shop where she meets her
lover's other mistress for a
surprise confrontation — and
then showing us just what we
would have seen if we'd hap
pened to walk in by ourselves.
Shirley Muldowney is a
female champion in a virtually
all-male sport, and the movie

emphasizes that contrast by
making her the only important
woman character. Her mo
ther's role is minimized (to
such an extent that her reap
pearance late in the movie, to
look disapprovingly on her
daughter's affair with a
married man, seems an intru
sion) and except for the races
— which are unexcitingly
shot, even played down — the
film generally takes the form
of a series of two-character
dialogues between Shirley and
the men in her life: her father,
Tex Roque (Hoyt Axton); her
husband, lack Muldowney
(Leo Rossi), who is her first
partner; her lover, Connie
Kalitta (Beau Bridges), who is
her second partner; and her
son, John (Anthony Edwards).
However, the filmmakers
have nothing much to say
about Shirley's struggle
against the prejudices of the
men who run the world of
racing, or her victory over the
men and their prejudices. You

can detect the TV movie sen
sibility of Heart Like a Wheel
very early, when Tex grudg
ingly gives his teenage
daughter permission to marry,
concerned over the possible
loss of her integrity, and in
lack's momentary reluctance
to surrender the wheel to Shir
ley when a local drag king
challenges him to a test of
skill. The filmmakers don't
treat these moments as issues,
just as bases that have to be
tagged before the story can
proceed.
Similarly, Shirley's tirst
encounter with the exclusive
ness ot male drivers is given a
storybook facility. When she
tries to enter a New lersey
race in 196b, atter she and Jack
(as her mechanic) have been
winning all o\er upstate New
York for nearl\ ten years, the
administrator — a male
chauvinist cartoon — laughs
her off, and the other drivers
make mocking remarks about
a woman's place when she

asks tor their signatures on
her application form. But
champ driver Connie kalitta,
whose initial interest in her is
transparently sexual, gallantlv
signs his own name and then
bullies his pals into adding
theirs — and then of course
Shirley beats the track record.
The rest of the picture con
tinues this predictable, non
exploratory approach, and it is
similarly unimaginative, even
uninformative, in its portrayal
of Shirley Muldowney. Bonnie
Bedelia s performance doesn't
help. Bedelia has a believable,
unshaped prettiness — she
looks like she could have
emerged trom the back roads
of Schenectady — and she
doesn't look much older than
she did 14 years ago, when she
played Bruce Dern's pregnant
dance partner in They Shoot
Horses. Don't They? And she's
certainly a competent actress
— but not a highly varied one,
nor even an unusually sympa
thetic one.
She's ingratiatingly torn
boyish in her teenage scenes,
but as Shirley ages (the perfor
mance covers the period from
to her second NHRA win
in 1980) Bedelia doesn't show
any genuine progression: She
retains the unself-conscious
courageousness, the dogged
determination, and the girlish
whine that offsets the other
two qualities. No hump in her
life — the failed marriage, the
accident, the rocky affair with
Connie — has any visible ef
fect on her beyond a momen
. tary emotional response, and
her range for expressing emo
tion even in a crisis isn't terrib
ly large. She does wide-eyed
amazement, frozen anger,
verge-of-tears poutiness,
ironic distance, and tentative
toughness. I don't mean to
belittle Bedelia: Many
actresses (and actors) have
only one or two stock reac
tions and no talent at all for
the physica' accuracy that
Bedelia has been (justly)
praised for. But I didn't care
much about Shirley while I
was watching the picture, and
afterwards I realized it was be
cause I'd learned so little
about her.

The filmmakers make two
dumb mistakes: killing Tex
Roque off so early and trying
to make a philandering fool
out of Connie kalitta in the last
half hour. Hoyt Axton and
Beau Bridges both have warm,
big-old-bear presences that
dominate the movie. Axton,
the songwriter-folksinger who
had a brief, memorable part as
the father in The Black Stal
lion, makes Tex Roque such a
vital character that when his
jovial wail on "You Taught Me
How To Cry" (one of two ter
rific numbers he sings here,
and the one Axton wrote him
self; the other is Willie
Dixon's "Built for Comfort")
winds to a growling close and
you realize you're watching
the cars approaching his fu
neral, you feel a sense of loss
— even though Tex only has
three small scenes. Unfortun
ately, Tex's death is the emo
tional high point of the film,
which has barely begun.
Beau Bridges' gift for
playing charming, vulnerable
men has been demonstrated
in movies like The Landlord,
Lovin' Molly and Norma Rae,
but he hasn't had a lot of
major roles, and nothing I've
seen him in before has af
forded him the opportunity to
create as complex a character
as Connie Kalitta. It could cer
tainly be argued that Ken
Friedman did a better job of
drawing Connie than he did
with Shirley or any of the
other characters, but Badges
plays much more than he's
given.
The thinness of Bonnie
Bedelia's (and Leo Rossi's) act
ing becomes obvious when
Bridges shows you layers of

kindness and hurt and sexual
energy in a single look. In one
scene, Connie's disqualified
from a race because of late
ness, and he storms toward
the administrator's office to
protest; Shirley scampers after
him, trying to calm him down,
and when a restraining official
presses on the arm that she
injured in the wreck and she
screams out in pain, Connie
whirls around and slams the
official on the jaw. Somehow,
Bridges lets you know that his
violence arose from both his
lury at being dropped from
the race and his protective
feelings for Shirley — and that
he's so whipped up and so
confused that he couldn't tell
you which impulse is stronger
at that moment. In the next
scene, after his brawling has
gotten him placed on proba
tion, Shirley offers to make
him her crew chief, and he
refuses flat out — until she
catches the eye of an old male
friend as she crosses the room
and, Connie's jealousy and
sense of sexual competitive
ness set in motion, he shouts
merrily that he's reconsidered
her offer. These two se
quences may take up no more
than five or six minutes of
screen time, but they equal a
short story-length character
study of Connie Kalitta. And
when the movie attempts to
reduce him to a joke — a com
pulsive womanizer and a
paltry liar — later on, the foun
dation Beau Bridges has laid
for this man causes us to resist
any such cheap development.
Bridges' Connie Kalitta is a
character we can understand
and care about. When we
leave Heart Like a Wheel, we
take him with us.
