# 'Gorky Park' solid, not brilliant
## 
### JIM TASSOPULOS 
Corky Park is a solid movie,
not brilliant, terribly original,
insightful or energetic, but
competent in almost every
way.
The story is taken from Mar
tin Cruz Smith's novel of the
same name, which received a
good deal of praise, not only
as an exciting thriller, but as a
depiction of modern Soviet
society. The book, I think was
overpraised, and the movie
has fallen victim to some very
negative reviews, to people's
exaggerated conception of the
book's quality.
The story begins with the
discovery of three dead
bodies in Moscow's Corky
Park, bodies which have had
the faces stripped off and the
fingertips severed. Arkady
Renko, played by William
Hurt, is the honest, principled
police investigator assigned to
the case. With the possibility
of KGB involvement looming
in the background, Renko
begins his search for the vic
tims' identity and the killer.
The investigation brings
Renko into contact with Irina,
a young attractive Soviet dissi
dent who dreams of getting
out of Russia Ooanna Pacula in
her first screen role); a tough,
cynical New York police cap
tain played by Brian Dennehy;
and Robert Osborne, a
wealthy American industrialist
played by Lee Marvin.
Corky Park succeeds by tel
ling an interesting story with
solid acting and solid filmmak
ing. Only one or two scenes
stand out as memorable or ex
ceptional. However, director

Michael Apted develops the
intricate piot, which follows
the book very closely,with
clarity and a good deal of
suspense. The screenplay by
Dennis Potter, who wrote the
brilliant Pennies From Heaven
(both the television and the
screen versions) may not be as
inspired as might have been
expected, but the dialogue is
always sharp.
The film was shot in En
gland, but it is easy to accept
the cold dank streets as
genuine. In fact, the quality of
the cinematography and set
design stands out, giving the
film an appropriately dreary,
somber feel. It is a nice
change of pace from the
bright, slick look of most thril
lers.
The human relationships in
the story pose the biggest

problems for the movie. The
inevitable involvement be
tween Renko, the reluctant
dissatisfied representative of
the establishment, and Irina,
the dissident, could have been
more electrifying. There was
never enough passion in the
scenes between them.
In fact, the relationship be
tween Renko and the police
captain was, for me the most
moving, satisfying element ot
the film. As each learns that he
can trust no person or institu
tion around him — America')
or Russian — the bond be
tween these radically different
individuals gives humanity to a
very dark world.
The larger issues raised by
the film are basic, but still in
teresting. The desire to leave
the closed, constricting Soviet

society is eloquently embodied
by Irina and her friends. At the
same time, the power of
money, exemplified by the in
dustrialist Osborne balances
the scales, scattering Irina's
image of paradise in the West.
The story oi death, greed and
corruption begins in Moscow,
but it ends in Stockholm,
Sweden. Soviet society
emerges as corrupt and op
pressive, but it is Western
values which fuel the destruc
tion.
The two most memorable
scenes — Hurt's re-enactment
ot the murders to convince
Irina that her triends are dead,
and his outrage at the luxury
in which Irina is living after
Osborne has taken her to
Stockholm — effectively slip
the viewer a tew things to
ponder.
The performances are, as I
have said, all solid. I must say
that Hurt is miscast as a brood
ing Russian; however, he does
his best, and by the end, he
makes the character
believable. Pacula's screen
presence is excellent, and she
looks exactly right in the role.
However, it is Dennehy and
Marvin, as the captain and the
industrialist, who provide the
film with energy, both
humane and perverse. If a
similar energy had been
prevalent in the film as a
whole, Gnrky Park might have
been a memorable experi
ence.
As it is, it will keep most
people interested in its world
of greed, love, friendship and
desire; even if it never makes
this world come totally alive.

book's quality.
The story begins with the
discovery of three dead
bodies in Moscow's Corky
Park, bodies which have had
the faces stripped off and the
fingertips severed. Arkady
Renko, played by William
Hurt, is the honest, principled
police investigator assigned to
the case. With the possibility
of KGB involvement looming
in the background, Renko
begins his search for the vic
tims' identity and the killer.
The investigation brings
Renko into contact with Irina,
a young attractive Soviet dissi
dent who dreams of getting
out of Russia Ooanna Pacula in
her first screen role); a tough,
cynical New York police cap
tain played by Brian Dennehy;
and Robert Osborne, a
wealthy American industrialist
played by Lee Marvin.
Corky Park succeeds by tel
ling an interesting story with
solid acting and solid filmmak
ing. Only one or two scenes
stand out as memorable or ex
ceptional. However, director

Michael Apted develops the
intricate piot, which follows
the book very closely,with
clarity and a good deal of
suspense. The screenplay by
Dennis Potter, who wrote the
brilliant Pennies From Heaven
(both the television and the
screen versions) may not be as
inspired as might have been
expected, but the dialogue is
always sharp.
The film was shot in En
gland, but it is easy to accept
the cold dank streets as
genuine. In fact, the quality of
the cinematography and set
design stands out, giving the
film an appropriately dreary,
somber feel. It is a nice
change of pace from the
bright, slick look of most thril
lers.
The human relationships in
the story pose the biggest

problems for the movie. The
inevitable involvement be
tween Renko, the reluctant
dissatisfied representative of
the establishment, and Irina,
the dissident, could have been
more electrifying. There was
never enough passion in the
scenes between them.
In fact, the relationship be
tween Renko and the police
captain was, for me the most
moving, satisfying element ot
the film. As each learns that he
can trust no person or institu
tion around him — America')
or Russian — the bond be
tween these radically different
individuals gives humanity to a
very dark world.
The larger issues raised by
the film are basic, but still in
teresting. The desire to leave
the closed, constricting Soviet

society is eloquently embodied
by Irina and her friends. At the
same time, the power of
money, exemplified by the in
dustrialist Osborne balances
the scales, scattering Irina's
image of paradise in the West.
The story oi death, greed and
corruption begins in Moscow,
but it ends in Stockholm,
Sweden. Soviet society
emerges as corrupt and op
pressive, but it is Western
values which fuel the destruc
tion.
The two most memorable
scenes — Hurt's re-enactment
ot the murders to convince
Irina that her triends are dead,
and his outrage at the luxury
in which Irina is living after
Osborne has taken her to
Stockholm — effectively slip
the viewer a tew things to
ponder.
The performances are, as I
have said, all solid. I must say
that Hurt is miscast as a brood
ing Russian; however, he does
his best, and by the end, he
makes the character
believable. Pacula's screen
presence is excellent, and she
looks exactly right in the role.
However, it is Dennehy and
Marvin, as the captain and the
industrialist, who provide the
film with energy, both
humane and perverse. If a
similar energy had been
prevalent in the film as a
whole, Gnrky Park might have
been a memorable experi
ence.
As it is, it will keep most
people interested in its world
of greed, love, friendship and
desire; even if it never makes
this world come totally alive.
