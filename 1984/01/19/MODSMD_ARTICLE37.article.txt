The envelope . . .
The editor-elect will announce his
choices for positions on next
volume's staff . . . someday. Mr.
Goldberg announces that he is sure
about one thing: He is not sure yet
who will make up next volume's

staff. "Please, give me time," he
cries out in a sickly, dying voice as
he tugs at the dozens of hairs that
have recently turned gray. "Maybe
tomorrow," he says, struggling to
stay awake, sinking further and fur
ther into an abyss of sweat and
blood and work.
