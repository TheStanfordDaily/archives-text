# Stanford contributes nearly $800 million to state economy
## 
### DUN GIFFORD, JR 
The University and its affiliates pumped approximate
ly $753.3 million in expenditures into the state economy
in the academic year 1981-1982, according to a recently
published report.
Educational expenditures, faculty and staff payroll
and research were cited as Stanford's major financial
outlays.
The report was published by The Association of Inde
pendent California Colleges and Universities (AICCU),
a non-profit research and lobbying group supported by
California's independent universities.
"It's sort of in vogue right now to show how univer
sities can be industries in and of themselves," said
Hans Gisecke, assistant director of the AICCU. He
added that similar reports have been made in 15 other
states.
Cisecke said increased competition for such things
as the state Cal Grant program have made it imperative
for independent universities "to increase their
visibility and show legislators that universities are

not just sleepy little outposts for academicians."
The California Post-Secondary Education Commis
sion is currently preparing a similar report, according
to Cisecke, that will appraise the economic impact of
state universities.
The AICCU included all of its members in the report,
but carried out case studies on its three largest: Stan
ford, The California Institute of Technology, which ac
counted for $496.7 million annually and the University
of Southern California, which added $506.6 million.
"The report was a substantial undertaking," said
Andrew Doty, director of community relations, who
was involved in the late stages of preparing the Univer
sity's case study.
"It contains mixtures of hard figures provided by uni
versity offices and projections by the AICCU," he
said."lt shows clearly that Stanford is one of the major
economic forces in the mid-Peninsula."
Doty also said that in times of recession, Stanford
provides, unlike some companies, a "steady source of
employment" and "is a strong and stable economic
force."
Stanford's multi-million dollar expenditures,
however, rank behind those of some of the larger cor
porations. Hewlett-Packard, for example, spent $41.5
million per month on payroll in Santa Clara county
alone.
The single largest expenditure, $238.1 million, was di

rected to education and general needs. This included,
according to Doty, "a broad range of everything from
vegetables for residence food services to technical
equipment for laboratories, from chalk for the black
board to library aquisitions."
Faculty, staff and administrative payroll, $165.5 mil
lion, accounted for the second largest expense.
As one of the major research institutions in the
country, Stanford spent more than $152 million a year
in a variety of disciplines.
The report also estimated the combined, state-wide
economic impact of the other independent universities
in California at $7.5 billion.
