### DUN GIFFORD, JR 
The University and its affiliates pumped approximate
ly $753.3 million in expenditures into the state economy
in the academic year 1981-1982, according to a recently
published report.
Educational expenditures, faculty and staff payroll
and research were cited as Stanford's major financial

not just sleepy little outposts for academicians."
The California Post-Secondary Education Commis

to Cisecke, that will appraise the economic impact of
state universities.
The AICCU included all of its members in the report,
but carried out case studies on its three largest: Stan
ford, The California Institute of Technology, which ac
counted for $496.7 million annually and the University
of Southern California, which added $506.6 million.
"The report was a substantial undertaking," said
Andrew Doty, director of community relations, who
was involved in the late stages of preparing the Univer
sity's case study.
"It contains mixtures of hard figures provided by uni
versity offices and projections by the AICCU," he
said."lt shows clearly that Stanford is one of the major
economic forces in the mid-Peninsula."
Doty also said that in times of recession, Stanford
