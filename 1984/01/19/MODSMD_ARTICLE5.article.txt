contacts were addressed."
In his address to the 35-nation Furopean Disarma
ment Conference, Cromyko accused the United
States of making "maniacal plans" for nuclear war.
He said, "New missiles, bombers and aircraft carri
ers are being churned out in some kind of pathologi
cal obsession."
Asked about Cromyko's address, the U.S. official
said Shultz "recognized it was a speech, but he took
his normal, constructive attitude toward doing busi
ness with a foreign minister."
The meeting at the Soviet Embassy lasted five
hours and 10 minutes — two hours more than ex
pected.
Shultz then phoned a report to President Reagan,
who joined with him this week in urging the Soviets
to seek reconciliation after several months of dead
locked negotiations and public recriminations.
