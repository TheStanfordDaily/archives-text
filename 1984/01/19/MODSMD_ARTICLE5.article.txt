Soviets block U.S. policies
Stockholm, Sweden — Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei (jromyko delivered a blistering attack on
U.S. policies yesterday. But in a private meeting later
he and Secretary of State George Shultz appeared to
make headway toward better relations.
' I S official said Shultz and Cromyko shook
ands before and after their meeting and "were
even smiling" afterward.
It was the first two-level contact between the su
perpowers since U.S.-Soviet arms talks broke off in
~ ovember. Ihe U.S. official called the discussion
go<x anc progress was made on many issues.

contacts were addressed."
In his address to the 35-nation Furopean Disarma
ment Conference, Cromyko accused the United
States of making "maniacal plans" for nuclear war.
He said, "New missiles, bombers and aircraft carri
ers are being churned out in some kind of pathologi
cal obsession."
Asked about Cromyko's address, the U.S. official
said Shultz "recognized it was a speech, but he took
his normal, constructive attitude toward doing busi
ness with a foreign minister."
The meeting at the Soviet Embassy lasted five
hours and 10 minutes — two hours more than ex
pected.
Shultz then phoned a report to President Reagan,
who joined with him this week in urging the Soviets
to seek reconciliation after several months of dead
locked negotiations and public recriminations.
1 he U.S. official c tid the ♦■•Iks covered the state of
arms control, sec urity issu human rights, Central
America and regional and bilateral questions, but he
gave no details.
On Tuesday, administration sources said Shultz
would suggest that U.S.-Soviet arms talks resume on
somp level even it formal negotiations remained
stalled.
Ihe Soviet Embassy refused to discuss the
meeting.
In his address to the conterence, Cromyko made
it clear Moscow would not return to the Geneva
talks on intermediate-range nuclear missiles so long
as NATO continues to deploy U.S. cruise and Persh
ing lis in Western Europe. He charged that "at pres
ent the aggressive foreign policy of the United States
is the main threat to peace."
Court rules on jury selection
Washington — The Supreme Court ruled yesterday
that the jury selection process in trials must be open
to the press and the public, except in rare circum
stances, to assure society that the criminal justice
system is functioning fairly.
The unanimous decision, written by Chief Justice
Warren Burger, was an important extension of the
public's right to open trials, first announced by the
court in 1980. It stemmed from a judge's closing of
jury selection for a California rape-murder trial that
resulted in the death sentence for the detendent.
)ury selection, called voir dire (French for "to
speak the truth"), is a process of elimination by
which a judge and lawyers for both sides select
jurors from a large pool. Potential jurors are ques
tioned generally about their availability for a trial and
for possible bias, and may be eliminated for cause.
Each side, using so-called peremptory challenges,
may eliminate a certain number of prospective
jurors without giving a specific reason.
)ury selection is done openly in most trials. In
creasingly, however, judges have been closing the
proceedings to protect the privacy or ensure the
candor of potential jurors, who sometimes must an
swer personal questions.
Honduran officer rebuts U.S.
Ojo de Agua, Honduras — The Honduran army
colonel in charge of the military region where a U.S.
helicopter was downed near the Nicaraguan border
a week ago said yesterday he received a radio
message three days before the incident advising him

that the helicopter planned to fly over the border
area.
Col. Danilo Ferrera, in an interview at his
headquarters here, showed two foreign reporters
the message taken bv his radio operator notifying
him that the helicopter's flight plan included the
town Cipuentes, less than one mile from the border
and a short distance from where the aircraft was shot
down. It came under fire from Nicaraguan troops
after reportedly having violated Nicaraguan
airspace.
Ferrera's account of the incident conflicted with
that given by the U.S. government, which has
denied that the helicopter planned to fly hear the
border and has attributed its presence in the area to
heavy winds or navigational error.
In Tegucigalpa, U.S. military spokesman Col.
lames Strachan said, "The flight plan that you have is
obviously erroneous." Strachan said the helicopter
"definitely was not going to Cipuentes," which
would have placed it 25 to 30 nules southeast of the
course as stated by the U.S. Embassy: From San
Lorenzo, in southwestern Honduras, to the central
town of Aguacate.
The advisory message displayed by Ferrera was
dated |an. 8, 1984, and advised of a "U.S. helicopter
flight route" of Tegucigalpa-San Lorenzo-Cipuentes-
Aguacate. Strachan said flight plans normally are
filed the day of the flight rather than three days
before and that the U.S. aircraft did not originate in
Tegucigalpa. He also noted a discrepancy in that the
advisory referred to "HI-58" rather than the U.S.
helicopter's proper designation of HO-58.
Before Ferrera's statement, the U.S account of
the incident was repeated Wednesday morning by
the two U.S. Army captains who were passengers on
the helicopter. The pilot was killed by Nicaraguan
troops, who continued tiring across the be : ifter
the damaged copter landed just inside Honduras.
