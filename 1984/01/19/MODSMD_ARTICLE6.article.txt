### ROBERT BARCKLAY Staff writer 
Presidential candidates, members
of Congress and other government
officials may come here in April for a
three ody conference ii a Lobby Of
fice proposal garners financial sup
port and ASSU Senate approval.
Informing "students of diverse
opinions and options regarding
public affairs" is the purpose of the
proposed three-day conference, ac
cording to a written proposal
released by the Lobby Office last
month
"Financing is always a problem,"
Lobby Office Director John Hof
fmire said of the plan. "It is going
well ( but we have a few more
roadblocks to overcome."
The group may have overcome at
least one of these "roadblocks"
already with the help of the Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE). SCOPE has earmarked
$11,000 to fund the conference.
But questions remain as to whe
ther the SCOPE funds can be used
for the conference.
Council-of-Presidents-member
Peter Spivack said SCOPE had not
specified in its proposed budget
that it would use the money for this
purpose. The problem, he said, is
that SCOPE'S money came from as
sessment fees based on a submitted
budget — a budget on which the
student body voted.
For this reason, the money cannot
be used for purposes other than
what the group proposed unless the
new budget is submitted and ap
proved by the ASSU Senate.
Hoffmire said the conference was
"originally thought of as a way to get
students interested in voter registra
tion and participation in the 1984
election."

i he lobby Office proposal es
timates expenses for the conference
at about $27,833. This figure does
not include the cost of seminars
planned by other campus organiza
tions.
Hoffmire said he is fairly confi
dent that the Senate will approve
the new budget, but added that
there are some people within the
Senate who do not think the money
should be used for the event.
At the moment, organizers do not
have firm commitments from any of
the major presidential candidates. "
I think there is about a 25 percent
chance that we will get at least one
of the major presidential candidates
who are left by the time of the Cali
fornia primaries," Hoffmire said.
He added that there was a 75 per
cent chance that a minor candidate
would agree to come, but Hid not
specify who that might be.
The list of "tentatively commit
ted" speakers includes Congres
swoman Barbara Boxer (D-
Creenbrae) and Mervin Field, the
administrator of the California Poll.
Those who have agreed to speak
include Elizabeth Martin, director of
the California Agrarian Action Proj
ect, Don Villarejo, director of the In
stitute for Rural Studies and news
anchorman Tom Brokaw, who will
give the welcoming address.
Planners intend the conference to
be composed of a number of ses
sions on economic, domestic,
foreign, military and environmental
issues.
Much of the planning for confer
ence sessions may come from or
ganizations on campus that the Lob
by Office will ask to "provide direc
tion and guidance for many of the
conference's sessions," Hoffman
said. These campus organizations
will also be asked to raise the money
required to bring in people to speak

for the session they plan.
Hoffmire characterized the plan
ning for the conference as "
decentralized and democratic." Ac
cording to the proposal, the involve
ment of the campus in the planning
of the conference is an attempt to "
insure high quality presentations
and "greater participation."
