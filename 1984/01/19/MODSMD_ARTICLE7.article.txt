# Students ask Kennedy to pick Diamond for commencement
## 
### JULIE RYAN 
Students voted two-to-one to
hold this year's Commencement at
the Sunken Diamond at a meeting
last night in Memorial Auditorium.
But senior class presidents
stressed that while the 65 students
in attendance may have reached a
consensus, additional student input
is necessary to persuade the Admin
istrative Council to back the Sunken
Diamond instead of the Stadium.
After seeing slides and listening to
accounts of the benefits and draw
backs of potential sites, only three
students voted to keep the cere
mony at Frost Amphitheater.
Despite a gentle push for the
Stadium site by University President
Donald Kennedy, the majority of
students seemed to feel that the
Sunken Diamond's better aesthetics
and easier access make it the prefer
rable site.
Senior class presidents conduct
ing the meeting explained that they
can only make an advisory decision
and that the final verdict remains in
the hands of the Administrative
Council.
That verdict should be reached
within a week to 10 days, according
to Kennedy. "We've got to do some
thing clever and do it fast," he said.
I don't have, nor do my colleagues
have, a great stake in this issue."
Another meeting to gauge student
opinion has been scheduled for
next Wednesday, and the senior
(lass presidents said they are hoping
tor a larger student turnout in order
to influence the Administrative
Council's final decision.
The final decision could be

strongly affected by the opinions of
seniors and graduate students, Ken
nedy said.
Senior President Andy Chan made
a pitch for the Stadium, touting bet
ter sightlines as its principle
strength. He added that a decorated
stage would be placed on the field
with the estimated 20,000 observers
seated in the bleachers under the
press box from goal line to goal line.

"If we had graduation in the
Sunken Diamond your mom would
only see you for five seconds,"
Chan said. The view in the Stadium
"was the clinching point for me and
I was as vehemently against having it
in the Stadium when I started as you
probably are," he said.
