# An end to terminal rudeness
## 
### NANETTE ARCHER 
Thus tar, Emily Post, Amy
Vanderbilt, Miss Manners
and the rest of the etiquette
experts have completely
neglected the proper con
ventions of courtesy for the
computer world.
So Judith Windt, of Stan
ford's Information Tech
nology Services, has taken
it upon herself to compile
and release some
guidelines for "computer
etiquette."
Windt began this task
unintentionally. Shortly
after she started her job as
ITS public information
writer, she asked her boss
for a basic guide to com
puter etiquette and was
told to "make one."
So, based on her own ex
periences ot difficulties en
countered on the computer
terminal screen and the
problems and complaints
of those around her, she
put together some sugges
tions of general courteous
ness for terminal users.
Windt, who graduated
from Stanford and returned
to teach numerous fresh
man English courses, had
her list of rules f'rst printed
in the August issue of
"Office Automation," a
part of Computerworld
magazine. Her ideas are
mainly related to CON
TACT/EMS (Electronic
Message System) usage.
The following provide
some examples of Windt's
concept of computer con
sideration:
•When setting priorities,
remember that the person
in your office should come
tirst, the caller on the tele
phone should come
second, and the electronic
message should be last.
• Never try to weasel past
another person's office,
visitors or telephone busy
signals via an electronic
message.
• Send yourself a copy of
the message you send
someone else, especially if
it requires a reply. "This
ploy will save you embar
rassment when you get the
reply a week later and can't
fur the life of you figure out
what your question was,"
she says. " '

•Be careful of your tone.
"People react to electronic
messages in different ways.
In the absence of body lan
guage cues, some people
wonder whether to be for
mal or informal. Until you
become chummier with the
other person, it's usually
safer to err on the side of
formality," she states.

• Resist the temptation to
read what's on the screen
of the person you are visit
ing.
•Do occasionally send
pleasant messages —"not
only birthday greetings and
lists of good books, but
also praise for a job well
done."

In addition to these,
Windt cautions against
"flaming" on the EMS —
she feels that there is a defi
nite tendency toward ag
gression and even rude
ness the further removed
from personal contact
transactions become.
"There seems to be a
'rudeness hierarchy,' " she

comments, "from personal
meetings to telephone con
versations to computer
screens."
Also, she stresses the
need to eliminate indis
criminate message
sending. Instead of sending
a specific message to every
one on jhe system, she

recommends that terminal
users limit their output to
only the directly involved
parties.
Windt said she feels that
these problems will eventu
ally work themselves out
once people grow more
used to computers.
"People will seek their own
level of courteousness as
they become more familiar
and comfortable with the
system,'' she claims.
Right now, Windt
compares our terminal-to
terminal communication
manners to those of a five
year-old on the telephone,
lust as the child may act
seemingly senseless or
rude merely from ignor
ance and lack of experi
ence, so are computer
users apt to act in similar
ways due to the newness of
the whole process and the
scarcity of firmly estab
lished conventions, she ex
plained.
Among the most com
mon "courtesy violations"
(and one of Windt's pet
peeves) is the tendency
people have to ignore an
office visitor every time the
terminal sends out a beep
signalling a new message.
Those actually in the office
deserve prime considera
tion always, she said.
Another frequent prob
lem is people's failure to
acknowledge messages,
which could partly be due
to an incoming-message
overload. Still, Windt urges
people to keep abreast of
their "mail'' and at least ac
knowledge receipt of
messages even if actual
answers must be delayed.
Windt is continuing her
campaign to civilize the
computer world through
more research connected
with Silicon Valley
operators. She hopes to
rec. ive as much informa
tion as possible so that eti
quette guidelines can be
established for all areas
utilizing computer commu
nication.
Yet, although she plans
to expand her investiga
tions and formal publica
tions, Windt has no plans
for an upcoming computer
courtesy bestseller.
