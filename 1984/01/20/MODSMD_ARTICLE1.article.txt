# Killer of prof to be paroled after 5-year sentence
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Five years ago, Theodore Streleski, a graduate
student in the Stanford Mathematics Depart
ment, murdered Mathematics Prof. Karel
deLeeuw with a two-pound hammer. In a
month, Streleski will be out of jail.
He will be freed Feb. 22 with a one-year
parole, on the condition that he not return to
the Stanford campus.
On campus, the police are taking precautions
to see that Streleski does not return — though
according to Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer,
short of "putting a ring of guards around the
Math Department," there is not much that can
be done.
The police held a meeting with members of
the mathematics faculty, but according to Bob
Beyers, director of University News and Publica
tions, the police do not even have a recent I.D.
photograph of Streleski.
"FHe is, at the moment, legally restricted from
coming onto campus — but who knows what he
looks like?" Beyers said.
Although Beyers will speak for the Math De
partment in saying that faculty members are
nervous, not to mention dismayed, about
Streleski's release, the department itself chose
to make no comment whatsoever to the press.

Today, television stations and newspapers
contacting the department were referred to the
Office of Legal Counsel for a statement con
cerning the Streleski case. Several TV 7 news seg
ments were tilrned outside of Building 400,
where the department is housed, but no mathe
matics professors were interviewed.
Their silence is understandable: Streleski told
the media during his trial that although
deLeeuw had been his "first choice," he had
lined up several alternative victims.
According to both Beyers and Santa Clara
County Deputy District Attorney Alan Nudel
man, there is a fear that anyone making a state
ment about Streleski or deLeeuw would be a
possible target.
"No one here wants to become someone
who would be 'of interest' to Streleski," Beyers
said.
A graduate student in mathematics, Streleski,
now 47, had been working towards his doc
torate for more than 19 years when he decided
that it would be "more constructive for me to
commit a murder than to hunt for a job," accor
ding to a 1979 interview with The San lose Mer
cury News.
Streleski choose deLeeuw as his victim, he ex
plained during the trial because he felt the man
was blocking progress toward his degree — and

also because he claimed, deLeeuw had once
made a joke about Streleski's shoes.
In the late afternoon on Aug. 18, 1979, a cus
todian found deLeeuw's body while he was
cleaning offices A 5 x 5 card taped to the door
of deLeeuw's office read: "No appointments
today — family emergency."
According to Niemeyer, who worked on the
Streleski case, the graduate student turned him
self in to the Stanford police later that evening.
"I believe he said, 'I think you may have been
looking for mr " Niemeyer said.
During the trial, the defense maintained that
Streleski had shown "diminished capacity" by
murdering deLeeuw According to Assoc. Psy
chiatry Prof. Donald Lunde, a diminished
capacity defense claims that while the murder
may have been committed with malice, the
defendant was mentally impaired and therefore
unable to premeditate the murder.
"It's different from an insanity plea — usually,
the diminished capacity defense reduces the
sentence from first-degree murder to second
degree murder or voluntary manslaughter,"
Lunde said. FHe explained that an insanity plea
can be used to acquit a defendant.
