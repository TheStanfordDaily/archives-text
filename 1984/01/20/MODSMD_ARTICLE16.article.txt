# Durham questions military solution
## Prof blasts Salvador policy 
### MICHAEL HARVEY 
"Presidents and statesmen"
are incorrei tly identifying the
problems facing El Salvador as
"recent and imported from
abroad," according to William
Durham, an assistant profes
sor in anthropology and
human biology here.
Durham was one of the last
social scientists to study El ,*>al
vador in the field before the
political coup of 1979 that
brought the Salvadoran plight
into the international spot
light.
In a speech at the Bechtel
International Center yester
day, Durham criticized the di
rection taken by U.S. policy
makers and, specifically, the
recently released report on
Central America by the Kis
singer Commission.
"Our policy continues to
emphasize a military solution

aimed at the symptoms,"
rather than the real cause of
the social conflicts in F.I Sal
vador, Durham explained.
Although Durham said El
Salvador suffers from a popu
lation that is growing too

rapidly, he explained that the
nation's problem is "not simp
ly a Malthusian result."
Rather, Durham said, it is
the "dynamic competition"
between land used to grow
food and land used to grow
export crops that deprives the
average Salvadoran of "access
to productive resources and a
right to a decent standard of
living."
Durham said another root of
the Salvadoran conflict lies in
the distribution of the land it
self.
Durham traces the root of
this inequity to the days of the
Spanish conquistadores and
their exploitation of the Indi
ans, emphasizing once again
that the social conflict in El Sal
vador is not a recent "volcanic
eruption."
