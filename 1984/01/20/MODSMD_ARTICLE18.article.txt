## The 						Stanford Daily Sino-American potential 
### 
Premier Zhao Ziyang of the People's
Republic of China visited the United States lasf
week in an attempt to strengthen the technical
and economic ties between the U.S. and China
â€” and indirectly to improve communication
and political relations between the two super
powers.
The White House has proclaimed that the
visit was an unqualified success, especially
since China committed itself to the non
proliferation of nuclear weapons technology
and to the lessening of tensions in Korea.
Yet some Taiwanese-Americans have vehe
mently opposed the thaw in relations between
the U.S. and the Chinese mainland. In addition
to harboring bitter memories of the Commu
nist takeover of China, they feel that President
Reagan's warm policies towards the People's
Republic have lessened the chance that Taiwan
and China will be reunified under Nationalist
rule.
However, in today's political climate it would
be shortsighted and misguided for the Reagan
administration to ignore the Chinese govern
ment and the one billion people it represents.

Some obstacles still remain before the issues
dividing the two countries can be totally re
solved. But these problems, such as whether
the United States will provide the Chinese with
nuclear technology for a electrical power pro
gram, will hopefully be resolved by the time
Reagan visits Beijing in April.
Zhao's visit seems especially significant in
light of the United States' history of enmity
toward Communist China. Only 40 years ago
the United States was supporting the
Nationalists in their war against the Commu
nists; just 30 years ago our country was
embroiled in a bitter struggle with the Chinese
over Korea. Less than 20 years ago, Mao
Zedong's Cultural Revolution convinced many
Americans that the United States could never
establish formal ties with the Communist na
tion.
Yet now, more than a decade after former
President Nixon opened up relations with the
PRC, and five years after former President
Carter formally recognized China, it appears
that the United States and the most populous
nation on the globe are finally learning to
cooperate with one another.
