# Voting Democratic in 1984
## 
### 
Over vacation, I talked politics with an old friend of
mine, Arthur Digby of St. Charles, lowa. Digby's been
active in the Democratic Party in lowa for as long as he
can remember, and he's pretty excited about the
presidential caucus coming up next month, where he'll
be fighting hard for the presidential candidate of his
choice.
If he can decide on one, that is.
"Frankly Bob," he told me, "I'm worried about the
caucus."
"Why?" I asked.
"Well, you see, I want to vote for Mondale."
"Then vote for Mondale."
"But I don't know if he could beat Reagan. So I
thought I'd vote for Glenn instead."
"Do you think Glenn could beat Reagan?"
"Oh definitely. I just don't think he can beat
Mondale. So I thought maybe I'd just go ahead and
vote for Mondale anyway."
"You don't sound too excited about it," I said.
"Of course not," said Digby, "Nobody really wants
to vote for Mondale. I'd much rather vote for Cranston
or Hart."
"Well, then, why don't you just vote for Cranston or
Hart?"
"How could I face my kids if I did that?"
"What do you mean?"
"Well, I've always told my kids how important it is to
succeed in whatever you try. Even if I try to elect
Cranston or Hart, they'll still lose, and I'll be a failure to
my kids."
"You could always vote for Cranston or Hart to send
a message to Washington."
"But if I wanted to send a message, I'd vote for lack
son or McGovern."
"Why don't you do that then?"
"I'd like to, I really would. But lowa's the first caucus
state, and we have to pick the winner so everybody else
can have a chance to send a message for us."
"What sacrifice."
"I know. Having a vote that means something is a ter

rible burden. What I'd give for a throw-away vote I
could send a really strong message with."
"Wait a minute," I said. "Let's back up a little bit.
How do you know Mondale can't beat Reagan, Reagan
can't beat Glenn and Glenn can't beat Mondale?"
"Oh, everybody knows that," he said. "Don't you
read newspapers?"
"How do the newspapers know?"
"It's their job to investigate these things, and to find
out who's going to win before they even enter the race.
That's how the public stays informed."
"But," I said, "if the papers know who's going to win
before anybody votes, why vote?"
"Because we live in a democracy, and voting is how
we decide things."
"Right," I said. "But if the people should decide,
why doesn't everybody just vote for whoever they
think is the best person for the job?"
"Because whoever they might think is best doesn't
stand a chance."
"How do you know, if nobody bothers to vote for
him?"
"No, no," said Digby, "you've got it backwards â€”
we know he can't win, because nobody will vote for
him."
"And nobody votes for him because he can't win be
cause nobody'll vote for him."
"Exactly."
"What happens if only a jerk could win? Do you vote
for him?"
"I always have in the past. And they've won."
"So you'll vote for whoever can win, no matter how
bad a candidate?"
"Of course. I'd rather elect a Democrat who's a car
bon copy of Reagan than lose to Reagan with a good
candidate."
"Why?"
"It's the only way we'll ever accomplish anything."
