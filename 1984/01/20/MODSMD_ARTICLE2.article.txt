## Afghans adamant in holy war 
### DAVID AZRIN 
Afghan resistance fighters are determined to con
tinue battling the Soviet troops which invaded their
country more than four years ago, according to Scott
Andrews, an anthropology graduate student who
returned from Afghanistan last month.
Andrews, who spent six weeks visiting Afghan
refugee camps, villages and training camps, said the
70,000 Afghan mujahadeen, or freedom fighters,
believe they are engaged in a holy war against the ath
eist Soviets.
"When you talk to Afghans about the future all
they talk about is the jihad or holy war. Nobody
there really seef an end to it," said Andrews, who
travelled through Pakistan and Afghanistan with
three other Americans to make a film on Afghan cul
ture.
"They can see that the odds are overwhelming on
the one hand, but on the other hand, they don't
(are," he said. "I don't think they are ever going to
stop fighting."
The rebels, who have the support of most of the
Afghan population, have waged a guerrilla war using
hit-and-run tactics to harass Soviet convoys and
strike at Soviet targets in the cities.
But since the invasion in December of 1979, the
well-equipped Soviet force of 105,000, backed by so
phisticated air power, has been unable to gain an ad
vantage over the uncoordinated army of rebel
fighters.

"The Russians' policy has been a scorched earth
policy," Andrews said. "What they want to do is
empty the countryside of people so there will be no
one left to help the freedom fighters."
The Soviets have burned harvests and bombed
villages, sending almost 4 million Afghan refugees —
or one-quarter of the total 14 million population —
into neighboring Pakistan and Iran. Some 1 million
Afghan civilians have been killed by the Soviets,
Andrews said.
Andrews, who visited refugee camps along the
Pakistan-Afghan border, said the displaced Afghans
were supplied with food and mud-wall houses by
the United Nations.
"A lot of the people we talked to had relatives
who had been imprisoned and never heard from
again," he said.
Andrews said the rebels have been unable to drive
out the Soviets because of a lack of effective anti
aircraft weapons, transport facilities, communica
tion lines, food and medical supplies.
"Everywhere we went the first thing the people
would say to us was, If you would just give us some
surface-to-air missiles we would get the Russians out
of here in a year.' "
"They are being killed by the Soviet air power, the
MiGs and the helicopters," Andrews said. "And all
they can do to defend is use machine guns ....
