## Afghans adamant in holy war 
### DAVID AZRIN 
Afghan resistance fighters are determined to con
tinue battling the Soviet troops which invaded their
country more than four years ago, according to Scott
Andrews, an anthropology graduate student who
returned from Afghanistan last month.
Andrews, who spent six weeks visiting Afghan
refugee camps, villages and training camps, said the
70,000 Afghan mujahadeen, or freedom fighters,
believe they are engaged in a holy war against the ath
eist Soviets.
"When you talk to Afghans about the future all
they talk about is the jihad or holy war. Nobody
there really seef an end to it," said Andrews, who
travelled through Pakistan and Afghanistan with
three other Americans to make a film on Afghan cul
ture.
"They can see that the odds are overwhelming on
the one hand, but on the other hand, they don't
(are," he said. "I don't think they are ever going to
stop fighting."
The rebels, who have the support of most of the
Afghan population, have waged a guerrilla war using
hit-and-run tactics to harass Soviet convoys and
strike at Soviet targets in the cities.
But since the invasion in December of 1979, the
well-equipped Soviet force of 105,000, backed by so
phisticated air power, has been unable to gain an ad
vantage over the uncoordinated army of rebel
fighters.

"The Russians' policy has been a scorched earth
policy," Andrews said. "What they want to do is
empty the countryside of people so there will be no
one left to help the freedom fighters."
The Soviets have burned harvests and bombed
villages, sending almost 4 million Afghan refugees —
or one-quarter of the total 14 million population —
into neighboring Pakistan and Iran. Some 1 million
Afghan civilians have been killed by the Soviets,
Andrews said.
Andrews, who visited refugee camps along the
Pakistan-Afghan border, said the displaced Afghans
were supplied with food and mud-wall houses by
the United Nations.
"A lot of the people we talked to had relatives
who had been imprisoned and never heard from
again," he said.
Andrews said the rebels have been unable to drive
out the Soviets because of a lack of effective anti
aircraft weapons, transport facilities, communica
tion lines, food and medical supplies.
"Everywhere we went the first thing the people
would say to us was, If you would just give us some
surface-to-air missiles we would get the Russians out
of here in a year.' "
"They are being killed by the Soviet air power, the
MiGs and the helicopters," Andrews said. "And all
they can do to defend is use machine guns ....

CHII DOF CONFLICT: Military training starts early among the Afghan rebels. This 6-year-old child

"They need weapons, and
they need supplies in the
sense of food and medical
supplies."
The United States currently
sends about $100 million in
covert aid including supplies
and weapons, Newsweek
magazine reported. Most of
the weapons are Russian or
Chinese-made guns supplied
through middlemen to hide
U.S. or Pakistani involvement,
Andrews said.
"There are a certain number
of weapons there now that are
getting there from the U.S.,
but no one there will admit it
because it endangers them,"
he said.
"Any weapons that come in
are Russian or Chinese weap
ons that can be bought on the
world market, and it's hard to
separate Russian weapons that
were given from those that

were captured," Andrews
said.
Brigadier General Safi, the
commander of a training camp
in Afghanistan that Andrews
visited, told him the rebels
"obvioush needed more aid,
but denied that they currently
received any U.S. aid.
Andrews, who retused to
disclose the camp's location,
said about 120 men were
trained there at a time in four
week to two-month courses.
The fighters learned to make
homemade bombs, fire
Russian-made weapons,
engage in ambush attacks and
practice urban guerrilla
warfare.
Andrews said he did not
hear or see any evidence that
the Soviets used chemical
weapons which are forbidden
by international law. Recent
reported accounts from
refugees have suggested that
the Soviets may be using these
weapons.
The Soviets have also been

hurt by the virtual collapse of
the Afghan army which,
plagued by desertions, has
dwindled from a total ot about
125,000 in 1979 to about 25,000
presently, Andrews said.
Andrews said Afghan village
residents in the Jaji valley told
him about an entire Afghan
army garrison of 800 men that
deserted to join the
Mujahiideen in October.
The Mujcihadeen had sur
rounded the garrison that was
stationed in the middle of the
valley, cutting off all their
supplies except those that
could be dropped by Soviet
helicopters.
When a Soviet convoy of
12.000 soldiers arrived to
relieve the soldiers, more than
700 of the Afghan army men
reportedly fired on the
Soviets, killed their own So
viet advisers and turned them
selves over to the
Mujahadeen.
Andrews said he saw about
10 destroyed Soviet tanks,

wrecked houses and ruins of
the garrison from the battle.
The Soviet invasion has revi
talized the Afghan people's re
ligious zeal and helped unify
the various religious and eth
nic factions into a sense ot
nationhood, according to
Andrews.
"People art' beginning to
think about Atghan
nationalism where in the past
there was mostly fighting and
teuding between the different
tribes and factions," he said.
The important things that
are going on are a revitaliza
tion of Islam and a revitaliza
tion of their cultural code," he
said.
Andrews said his non-profit
group, Cultural and Educa
tional Media, based in
Sausalito, hopes to produce
an hour-long film for the
Public Broadcasting System,
but he is seeking additional
funds.
"Right now, we are broke,"
he said.
