## We've almost got the library 
### 
Since early 1981 the establishment
of the proposed Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library Complex at
Stanford University has been the
subject of discussions both public
and private. Where do we stand
today? All parties may be closer than
they think!
After the intense debates of the
past several months, conducted
with such fervor, two conclusions
seem, to me at least, inescapable.
First, in the heat of the arguments
that have taken place so far, many
seem to have lost sight of what a
magnificent opportunity Stanford
has been offered. Second, many
seem to have lost sight of the fact
that all the parties involved agree on
almost all aspects of the proposed
complex.
Let's shine a little light on the mat
ter:
1) There is widespread agreement
that a Ronald Reagan presidential li
brary would be a major asset to
Stanford and the intellectual com
munity.
2) There is widespread agreement
that an appropriate museum would
strengthen the value of the library
and give life to the historical records
it would contain.
3) There is widespread agreement
that the establishment of a center
for public affairs would be of major
benefit to the University; that is to
say, a major conference center
which the University does not now
have and a program for advanced re
search which would bring approxi
mately two dozen distinguished
scholars annually.
Where does the disagreement lie?
It lies with who should govern the
center for public affairs — the Stan
ford faculty through the provost or

the Hoover Institution through the
president of the University and the
Board of Trustees? The issue is not,
nor has it ever been, a question of
University control versus Hoover In
stitution control.
One point that continually seems
to get lost in rhetoric is that the
president of the United States envi
sions the center for public affairs as
national in character, and not as a
University department. Therefore,
reasonable men and women have
argued during the debate that the
center should be placed in that part
of the University — namely, the
Hoover Institution — which has a
proven ability to conduct a compre
hensive public policy research pro
gram.
Some have said that the Hoover
Institution's governance of the cen
ter would be intolerable, arguing
that "enough is enough," and in so
doing have provided highly ques
tionable justifications which
reasonable people have argued con
stitute direct violations of academic
freedom.
Others observe that "normal"
University governance is inappropri
ate to a national public policy cen
ter, and in so doing point to the
Hoover Institution's independent
status within the framework of the
University as one of the principal
reasons for the national and interna
tional reputation for excellence it
enjoys today.
No one has argued that the pro
posed center has no academic
merit. Thus, at the beginning of this
new year the positions of the pros
and of the cons are clear — so
where do we go from here?
Reasonable men and women can
reach different conclusions con

cerning the same set of facts and cir
cumstances. But reasonable men
and women seldom allow disagree
ment over a single point to obscure
what is really at issue — namely, a
magnificent opportunity for Stan
ford.
Surely, the Board of Trustees of
one of the very best universities in
the United States can work out a
reasonable alternative — an alterna
tive which would accord due
respect to all concerned, and which
would bring an unparalleled aca
demic resource to Stanford.
