Kennedy letter
Several days ago I received my
"Dear Don" letter (President Ken
nedy's letter to the staff dated jan.
3). It purported to deal with the
critical parking problem presently
existing at Stanford. In reality
parking was mentioned only in
passing while the thrust of the
letter highlighted the new Mar
guerite bus service available since
Jan. 3.
After rereading the letter I
became outraged over the fact that
the University administration has so
little regard for the well-being of its
personnel — in this instance
placing those with "C" stickers in a
perennial Catch-22 situation.
I would like to invite our Presi
dent to visit the parking lot at
Panama and Via Ortega Streets
(across from the tennis courts) any
afternoon of the week. It is a typical
campus parking area. There you
will find 15 or 20 "C" stickered cars
parked along the red curbs while an
equal number of "A" pa/king
spaces remain unused. Chances are
the police will be tagging those

vehicles in violation.
This situation has been brought
to the attention of both the Stan
ford police administrator and the
chairman of the Stanford Parking
Committee. My calls were met with
lots of "talk" but not much enthusi
asm.
Isn't the solution to the problem,
at least at this location, really a
simple one. Why not return one
row of "A" parking spaces to the
"C" sticker holders. This was sug
gested and the answer I received
was that . . the problem is under
review."
It seems to me that the time for
"review" has long since passed. It
is decision time!
President Kennedy, please assert
yourself and resolve this cam
puswide issue.

In regard to The Daily's recent
article on tuition increases

("Tuition increase rate slows," Jan.
18), just how does the University
propose to "keep Stanford affor
dable to a wide range of families"
by keeping "tuition comparable to
that charged by Vale, Columbia,
Brown and Harvard?"
In light of The Daily's editorial,
"Upper class education" ()an. 18),
this just seems to be another way ir
which Stanford will remain a uni
versity only the rich can afford.
Does charging high tuition, such a'
Harvard or Vale, make Stanford
automatically a nationally-ranked
university? There is a public univer
sity right across the Bay which
achieves national ranking yet
charges about one-third of Stan
ford's tuition.
If Stanford's first priority is to
maintain the quality of education it
provides, then it shuld do so rather
than worry if its tuition is (gasp!)
too low. C'mon Stanford, let's not
have the Weenies beat us in the
area that really counts . . . educa
tion.
