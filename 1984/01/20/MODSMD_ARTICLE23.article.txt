# What's in a word

### 
The following is a letter written
by The Daily's women's basket
ball reporter, John Lis. He found
it necessary to respond to a
recent letter printed in The Daily.
I must reply to the )an. 18 letter
from graduate student Nancy
Webb, in which she labelled a
Daily headline of Jan. 13 contain
ing the term "Lady hoopsters" as
sexist and carrying "various
degrading connotations that have
little to do with playing basket
ball." Though I did not write the
headline, I do on occasion make

use ot the terms "lady
hoopsters" and "lady cagers" in
my articles.
The sexism perceived by Webb
simply does not exist. I have
talked to members of the wo
men's basketball team about the
term and they also do not feel
that the terms are sexist. The fact
is that many teams across the
country use the word "lady" in
their nicknames, such as the
"Lady Techsters," "Lady Tigers,"
or "Lady Dons." The use of the
term "lady" in women's basket
ball is accepted and in fact en
couraged by the teams them-

selves.
While conversations I have had
with several women here have
failed to help me see what is
sexist about the word "la
dy" — I personally have al
ways thought of it as a compli
ment — I am sure that Webb has
some basis for her allegation that
the word is degrading. Basket
ball, however, is one area where
the word carries no sexist conno
tations whatsoever. Webb would
be well advised to confine her at
tacks against sexism to those
areas in which she has some ex
pertise.
