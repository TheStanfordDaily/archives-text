# It's (almost) too late...

### 
to write regularly for The Daily's
editorial page â€” but not quite
You have three days left to mull over your thoughts and put your paper in the
typewriter. Then, write up a sample column for application for biweekly colum
nist. Or perhaps you'd rather type up your reasons for wanting to be an at-large
member of the Daily's editorial board. Either way, thousands of folks across
campus will be reading your opinion in the morning in between bites of croissant
and sips of coffee.
Sample columns should be typed double-spaced on a 57-character line. Candi
dates for editorial board should attend a grill session Tuesday at noon, followed
by the editorial board elections that afternoon and evening. Columns and edito
rial board platforms are due at The Daily office by noon on Monday. Drop them
in the opinions box or ask for Troy or Shirish.
