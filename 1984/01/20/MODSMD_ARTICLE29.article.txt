## Campus safety: Are you always careful enough? 
### NANETTE ARCHER 
1 he lack of violent crime on campus this year
is cause for optimism, but members of the
Stantord police force and various campus
groups are growing concerned about students'
increasing lack of concern for personal safety.
Because there have been no major oc
curences of violent crime in 198.?-84 — such as
the series of rapes and attempted rapes two
years ago — there has been a tendency for
campus residents to become somewhat care
less, police said.
"We've been fortunate lately," Stanford
police officer Dan Smith said, "but because of
this, the level of student awareness is also at a
low right now."
Smith points out that it is the Police Depart
ment's job to maintain a high level of safety
awareness on a long-term basis, and not just
after instances of crime and violence. "This
university does a lot in the area of personal
safety," he said.
Smith added that a variety of groups and pro
grams on campus continue to be involved with
the issue of personal satetv.
Derek Passarelli, director of the SURt escort
service, agreed with Smith that students are
less concerned about personal safety now than
in previous years.
A few years ago there were numerous volun
teers and participants for the service, but
recently there has been a decline, prompting
SURE to redesign its system tor the present golf
cart service with paid drivers.
Passarelli said that in the absence of a given
crisis all that can be done is to "bombard
people with awareness tips discouraging
laxity."
Other campus organizations have been striv
ing to increase awareness as well. The Police
Department offers literature on several per

sonal safety topics which Smith believes have
been "very effective, overall, judging from the
amount of requests for material.'' One popular
brochure provides information on advised
travel routes through campus for all modes of
transportation.
Also, police alarms have been installed at 11
different locations on campus as part ot a pilot
program. When activated, they emit an audible
alarm and directly signal the officer-dispatch
station, insuring a police response within two
to three minutes.
Another group which deals with campus se
curity is the Personal Safety Committee,
headed by Row Director Diana Conklin. The
group meets regularly in an open forum that
encourages community input and participa
tion.
Above all, the various groups stress taking
advantage of their services and being constant
ly aware — not paranoid, but alert — to possi
ble danger. Risky practices that have been on
the rise include travelling through secluded
areas after dark, propping open doors to
campus residences after they have been
locked, and most notably, jogging alone at all
times of the day and night.
Students, on the whole, seem to have
become more lax because of a pervading, and
quite possibly unwarranted, sense of security.
"It's important to be cautious, just not
paranoid," student loselyn Lee said.
Junior Rebecca Buechel agreed with Lee:
"It's good to be conscious, but I know there
have been times when I've been in situations
which weren't especially safe."
The key to being safe comes down to just
being alert and aware, and taking precautions
accordingly — because you can never be ab
solutely sure.
