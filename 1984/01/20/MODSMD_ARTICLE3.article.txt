# Congressman blasts Reagan
## 
### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
In the third of a trio of speeches delivered here yes
terday, Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.), criticized the
Reagan administration's policies toward Third-World
countries as overly militaristic and negligent of human
rights.
Citing what he called an "extensive militarization of
the entire economy and foreign policy," Wolpe was
primarily pessimistic in his views towards Reagan's
policies with respect to both issues and countries, es
pecially those in the Third World.
While he conceded that "the U.S. is uniquely posi
tioned to become identified with Third-World
pt oples," he warned that "as long as we fail to under
stand the indignant forces that give rise to conflicts, we
will never come to terms" with problems such as anti
c< onialism and communism.
He also warned against U.S. support of unstable,
politically precarious countries which could turn
aj'jinst democracy and towards socialism. Wolpe said
' < makes no sen&£ fronrfTi p'tfTftical standpoint" to give
support to such regimes, adding that such support is
"counterproductive," and, "in reality, it is we that are
being manipulated."

Wolpe, chairman of the African Subcommittee of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, will go from here to
Arizona State on the end of a Western trip that has
taken him to UC-Berkeley, USC and UCLA.
Earlier in the day, Wolpe held an open forum on
recent trends in U.S. foreign policy toward Africa in
which he was critical of the role of the Reagan adminis
tration in assisting and stabilizing that continent as a
whole.
Claiming the "same paternal racism that under
pinned American policy" for the past few administra
tions is still present today, Wolpe questioned the ad
ministration's effectiveness in dealing with the area, es
pecially southern Africa.
"We are engaged in a policy that appears to reinforce
the policies of the regime (of pro-American countries in
Africa) while we are actually undercutting it,"he said.
In addition, he explained that the administration has
shirked some of its more humanitarian duties in the
region in favor of military advancement.
"The very heavy emphasis on the military," he said,
"has diminished the emphasis on foreign assistance pro
grams." He added that there should be "nothing in
consistent with strong human rights advocacy on one
hand and American interest on the other."
