# It takes all kinds to put out The Daily
## 
### 
But not this kind.
Here's the deal: We want you to work
with us. But only if you're not a naked mole
rat from Kenya, Ethiopia or Somalia. That's
what the little fellow in the picture is.
But since we don't think there are many
of these naked mole rats cruising around
Palo Alto, you're probably OK with us.

Drop by The Daily, conveniently located
across from Terrnan Engineering Center in
the Storke Student Publications Building.
Pick up a story or photo assignment.
We won't say what'll happen if you don't,
but let's just say that there are better things
in this world than waking up with a mess of
naked mole rats in your bed.
