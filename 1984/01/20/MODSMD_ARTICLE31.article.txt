## Trojans hand Cardinal yet another conference loss 
### MARK ZIEGLER 
Los Angeles — It's starting to get ridiculous.
Stanford lost yet another basketball game it should have won
last night. And the only change in the Cardinal's The Big Choke
script was that this time it included an overtime.
In what had to be one of the most boring overtime games in
college basketball history, USC took advantage of late-game
Stanford mistakes to win, 51-49, before a meager crowd of 3092
in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
USC also got help from someone upstairs when point guard
Larry Friend hit what Trojan Coach Stan Morrison called a
"semi-Hail Mary" shot with 0:06 to play in the overtime.
Friend's double-clutch, lean-in 10-foot bank shot proved to be
the difference for USC as the Keith Jones jumper at the buzzer
was no good.
The loss, which dropped Stanford to 11-6 overall and 0-5 in the
Pacific-10 Conference, all but ended the Cardinal's post-season
tournament chances. Unless Coach Tom Davis and company
pull off a small miracle in their 14 remaining games, they will be
watching television come tournament time.
"I tried to stress to the kids that this might be like Mother Na
ture," Davis said after the game. "There's nothing we can do to
force it. We've just got a lot of learning to do.
"But I can't fault the effort. We just find new ways to cause
ourselves problems.'
Most of the problems didn't arise until mid-way through the
second half, after Stanford had climbed to a 45-41 lead, its big
gest of the evening.
The Cardinal however, scored just two points — a pair of )ohn
Revelli free throws — in the final 9:16 of the game.
Meanwhile, USC — which improved to 7-11 overall and 2-3 in
the Pac-10 — closed it to 45-43 on the Friend lay-in and then tied
it at 45-all when Cedric Bailey, the only senior on the team,
picked up a loose ball and scored.
After the two teams traded points, the score was knotted
again at 47 apiece with 3:13 left.
Davis decided to hold the ball and go for the last shot, but
point guard Keith Ramee was whistled for a five-second viola
tion with 1:50 to go when he failed to bring the ball past the
sideline hash marks in the allotted time.
Now it was USC 's turn to screw up, and center Clayton
t.Olivier played his part perfectly, fouling Ramee when the
Trojans had the ball.
Ramee, though, was just as adept at giving the ball back to the
other team, missing the front end of the one-and-one with 0:36
to go. The game went into overtime when a Bailey prayer

hounded off the front rim at the end of regulation.
Stanford took its final lead of the evening at 49-47 one minute
into the overtime, but USC tied it just seconds later on a pair of
Bailey free throws.
Once again, Stanford had the ball, and once again it turned it
over. The goat this time was Revelli, who committed the same
five-second violation that Ramee was whistled for a few minutes
earlier.
"We got really tentative and hesitant near the end," Davis
said. "We sat back on our heels too much."
USC had the ball back and held it, setting up Friend's last
second heroics.
"That (Friend's shot) wasn't exactly what we were looking for,
but we'll take it," Morrison said. "We wanted to get the ball
inside, but we were so spread out."
It was no surprise that the Stanford locker room after the
game was as quiet as a church with no one in it. "You lose a
couple of close games and you lose your confidence down the
stretch," said a dejected Jones. "We just have so many prob
lems down the stretch."
Making last night's loss an even harder pill to swallow was
Stanford's whopping 24-15 rebounding margin and its ability to
finally cool its opponent's second-half shooting.
USC made only 42.1 percent of its second-period shots, a far
cry from the 70-plus percent shooting of Stanford's first four
Pac-10 opponents in the second half.
One Trojan who had no problem shooting was forward
W.ivne Carlander, who finished with a game-high 22 points on
11-of-15shootingfrom thefloor after making his first eight with
out a miss.
lones led Stanford with 17 points, but his turnover problems
continued as he gave it up seven times. Revelli was the only
other Card in double figures with 12 points, but he pulled down
a game-high 11 rebounds, seven of them on the offensive
board.

Stanford guard Keith Jones missed an 18-foot attempt at the buzzer in overtime as the Car
dinal just fell short against the USC Trojans, 51-49. Jones led Stanford scorers with 17 points
on the night. Jones also had the last chance to shoot against UC-Berkeley last Friday but
slipped and was called for travelling.
