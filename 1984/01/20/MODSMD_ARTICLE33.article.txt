# Women hoopsters host UCLA, travel to USC
## 
### JOHN LIS 
Coming off a convincing 75-55 victory over
NAIA foe St. Mary's College Tuesday night, the
Stanford women's basketball team returns to
action this weekend with a pair of Western Col
legiate Athletic Association contests.
The Cardinal will host UCLA tonight before
traveling to Los Angeles to face defending na
tional champion USC tomorrow evening.
UCLA is 9-5 overall this season, 1-1 in the
WCAA. The Bruins lost their conference
opener to Arizona State, 79-78, but came back
to soundly defeat Arizona, 81-60.
UCLA is coming off its biggest win of the
season, a 76-64 upset over No. 6 Old Dominion
last Tuesday night.
The Bruins are led by a pair of players from
the Netherlands — center Annette Keur and
forward Marja Van Helvoort. Keur, a 6-foot-4
freshman, is averaging 14.4 points and seven
rebounds per game to pace the Bruins, while
Van Helvoort is scoring at a 12.5 point per game
clip.
Forward Char Jones rounds out the UCLA
front line. Jones, a 6-2 junior, is averaging 12.1
points per contest.
USC was ranked No. 1 by most polls this
season, and the women of Troy seemed un
stoppable after an early-season 82-74 victory
over No. 3 Georgia. USC, however, started
1984 with three straight losses on the road to
Texas, Louisiana Tech and Old Dominion, all
ranked in the Top 10.
USC is 2-0 in the WCAA this season, having
defeated Arizona, 74-53, and Arizona State, 101 -
67, on the road last weekend. The Trojans faced
San Diego State last night in another confer
ence match-up.
USC features perhaps the finest woman in
college basketball, Cheryl Miller. The 6-2 soph
omore forward from Riverside was a consensus

All-America choice last season when she
averaged 20.4 points per game, and was named
Most Valuable Player of the NCAA Tourna
ment.
Miller has posted even more impressive
numbers this season. She is averaging 22.8
points per game and 11.4 rebounds an outing.
Miller is shooting 58 percent from the field. Her
high game came in the 102-90 loss to Old
Dominion, when she exploded for 38 points.
Joining Miller in the frontcourt are twins Pam
and Paula McCee. Pam McGee, a b-3 senior
center, averaged 17.6 points and 9.9 rebounds
per game in her first three seasons. This year
she is averaging 19.4 points and 11.4 rebounds
while shooting at a 59-percent clip.
Paula McGee, a 6-3 senior forward, averaged
19.8 points and 9.6 rebounds her first three
seasons, and is scoring 13.2 points per game
this year.
For Stanford, sophomore guard Virginia
Sourlis and junior forward Mary Bradach are
both coming off 18-point efforts against St.
Mary's. Sourlis is the Cardinal's leading scorer,
averaging 14.7 points per game, while Bradach
is scoring 12.8 points per contest.
Sophomore center Sarah Evans will have to
play a major role in stopping both teams' inside
games. Evans is averaging 14.5 points and 7.4
n '' game while hitting 52 percent
from th<
Also starting for Stanford will be freshman
forward Kim Mercer (7.1 ppg, 3.9 rpg) and
freshman guard Erica Mueser (3.2 ppg, 2.7 as
sists).
Came time tonight is 7:30 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion. Tomorrow night's contest will start at
6:30 p.m. at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
Tonight's game will be carried live over KZSU,
90.1 FM.

USC All-America forward Cheryl Miller will play against
Stanford Saturday. The 6-foot-2 forward is averaging 22.8
points a game and 11.4 rebounds.


Stanford center Sarah Evans should be severely tested this
weekend, especially against USC, where the Cardinal front
line gives up two to three inches in height. Evans is averaging
14.5 points and 7.4 rebounds so far this year.
