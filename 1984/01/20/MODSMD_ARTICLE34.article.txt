The No. 1 ranked Stanford
swimming and diving team
will look for its third and
fourth victories of the season
this weekend as it hosts the
UC-Santa Barbara Cauchos
and the Arizona State Sun
Devils.
The Cardinal will meet
Gauchos today at 2 p.m. at
DeCuerre Pool. UCSB has
won the Pacific Coast Athletic
Association crown for the past
six years.
Tomorrow Stanford hosts
Arizona State in Pacific-10 ac
tion.

In Stanford's opening two
meets, the Cardinal narrowly
defeated No. 3 ranked Texas,
57-56, and then came back to
cruise by Arizona, 66-47.
One of the keys to Stan
ford's success this season has
been freshman Jeff Kostoff,
the nation's top recruit last
year. Against Arizona last
weekend, Kostoff set both
school and pool records in the
500- and 1000-yard freestyles
and met NCAA qualifying
times in both events. Kostoff
clocked a time of 4:21.35 in
the 500 free and 8:54.86.

Cardinal Jon Denny is the
only other swimmer on the
Stanford team to meet an
NCAA qualifying time this ear
ly in the season as Denny
swam to a time of 1:48.50
against Arizona. The Cardinal
400 medley relay also met the
NCAA qualifying time, clock
ing a 3:20.71.
Stanford diver Thor Johnson
has also been a top performer
this year. Johnson won both
the 1-meter and 3-meter
diving competitions last week
against Arizona with scores of
331.20 and 300.15.
