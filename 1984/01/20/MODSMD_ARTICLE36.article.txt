In its toughest match of the season so far, the
injury-plagued Stanford wrestling team faces
Cal-State Bakersfield tomorrow on the road.
Cal-State Bakersfield is currently ranked No.
1 in Division II and has won the NCAA champi
onship seven of the past 10 years.
"I seriously do not expect us to win, but this
will be a good match for our experienced
wrestlers to prepare them for post-season com
petition since Bakersfield is such a good
school," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said. "I
am concerned about our second stringers to
make sure they have the right attitude about

the match. Right now we are over our heads,
but we will do our best."
Wrestlers that could give Bakersfield some
trouble are Bill George (126 pounds) who has
looked tough lately, Jeff Bradley (142 pounds),
and freshman standout Kurt Kassulke (190
pounds).
The season's schedule would have been very
tough for Stanford, even with an injury free
squad, and the team still faces tough op
ponents in the next few weeks, such as highly
ranked San Jose State, who placed third in the
Caesar's Palace Invitational, and perennial
powerhouse Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo.
