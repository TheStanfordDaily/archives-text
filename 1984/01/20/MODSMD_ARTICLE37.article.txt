# Olympic plans dissatisfy Soviets

### 
Moscow (AP) â€” With just six months
left before the 1984 Summer Olympics,
Soviet officials yesterday raised new ob
jections to preparations in Los Angeles
and left open whether they would take
part.
Marat Cramov, head of the Soviet Com
mittee for Physical Culture and Sports,
accused the U.S. State Department of in
terfering with an agreement to provide
for travel and safety of Soviet Olympic
athletes, and complained the Soviet
Union's "Olympics attache'' had been
barred from Los Angeles.
These are the latest in a long list that
the Soviets began drawing up shortly
after the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Moscow
Games. And U.S. protests launched to
bar Soviet athletes from the Games after

the Soviets shot down a South Korean air
liner Sept. 1 have further politicized the
1984 Olympics.
In the Soviet Union, there has been a
constant barrage at the Games, with the
Soviet press using them to attack Presi
dent Reagan, charging his administration
with "turning the summer Games into
anti-Soviet propagandistic hysteria."
But Western diplomats predict the
Soviets will take part unless a crisis similar
to the plane disaster causes another up
heaval in U.S.-Soviet relations. Los An
geles Olympics officials say they did not
expect confirmation of the Soviets' intent
to participate until just before the June
deadline.
Moscow has denied any intention of
seeking revenge for the U.S. Olvmpic

boycott, which was called by then-
President Jimmy Carter alter the Soviet
military move into Afghanistan. And the
Soviets signed a major TV contract last
summer to beam the games home.
He said Soviet Olympic Committee
members, in a recent visit to Los Angeles,
had signed an agreement with the U.S.
Olympic Committee, but the State De
partment had intervened.
Cramov also said the State Department
objects to the presence of the Soviet
"Olympics attache" in Los Angeles. Parts
of the Los Angeles area are closed to So
viet diplomats and journalists and West
ern observers believed this rule may have
been t ie reason the Soviet representative
was denied access.
