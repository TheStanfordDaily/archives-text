Memphis, Tenn. (AP) —
Former Tennessee defensive
back Reggie White signed a $4
million contract yesterday
with the Memphis Showboats
of the United States Football
League.
Team owner Logan Young
said the five-year contract
gives White a $550,000 signing
bonus, $300,000 cash and
$250,000 in five annual install
ments.

White said he was told he
could possibly make more
money by waiting for the Na
tional Football League draft.
"But I knew they were
lying," he said.
The b-foot-6, 270-pound Ail-
American said he negotiated
with the Showboats for several
weeks, holding out for more
money.
White said he plays football

because God gave him the tal
ents to do so.
"I figured God had blessed
me to be a better athlete than
what they had offered me at
first," he said.
Showboats Coach Pepper
Rodgers said he hoped
White's signing will make it
easier to convince Alabama
quarterback Walter Lewis to
play for Memphis.
"The job that I have right

now is working with Reggie to
sell Walter Lewis on coming
over here and playing foot
ball," Rodgers said.
The Showboats obtained
rights to negotiate with Lewis
through a trade with the Bir
mingham, Ala., Stallions.
White is the first big-name
plaver to sign with the Show
boats, one of six expansion
teams with the 1-year-old
USFL.
