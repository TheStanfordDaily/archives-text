# Smart money is on the Raiders
## 
### 
From I he Washington Post
A year ago, when the Redskins faced
Dallas and Miami in the playoffs, the
smart money was on Washington.
Handicappers for top sports-advisory
services agreed that the Redskins were
underdogs in both games only because
their opponents were teams that the
public has traditionally loved to bet. It
was a classic situation; The best team was
getting points.
But a lot has (hanged between that
game and Super Howl XVIII, in which the
Redskins are three-point favorites over
the Los Angeles Raiders.
"The betting line is wrong," declared
Rich Bomze, publisher of the Sports
Reporter, one of the handicappers who
loved the Redskins last season.
"Washington was only a two-point favor
ite at home against LA. this fall when the
Raiders had a lot of key players out. This
game ought to be pick-'em. The odds
makers are making you pay for betting
the new America's team."
The Super Bowl teams figure so close
that professional handicappers and bet
tors have difficulty formulating a strong
opinion on the game.
"The public's interest is very strong be
cause these are popular teams," said Las
Vegas handicappc r Russell Culver, "but
there haven't been any overwhelming
moves by the wise guys here. There's a
good chance the\ may bet more on the

UCLA basketball game the same day.'
Fven though it may be tough to pick a
winner, the proprietors of sports services
are obliged to tell their clients something.
For the most part, the handicappers are
telling them to bet Washington, judi
ciously:
• Jim Feist of National Sports Services in
Las Vegas: "The biggest statistic in the
game is the turnover ratio in favor of the
Redskins, and their consistency should
be the major factor. But if this weren't the
Super Bowl, I would pass the game."
• Bom/e: "The Redskins have got consis
tency, character and a recent winning
tradition, and I like Theismann over
Plunkett. But I'm telling people that
laying three points is a sucker play; they
shouldn't be too heavy."
• Ron Lowe of Washington's Capital
Sports Service: "I like the 'Skins because
of the quarterback matchup Plunkett's
an immobile quarterback and the
Redskins feast on immobile quarter
backs."
•Steve Turner of the lexas Sports Wire:
"I'll take the Raiders; I think their sec
ondary gives them an edge and I think
their line can play with the Hogs. But if
this were the regular season, I'd have no
opinion.
Handicappers in Las Vegas who have
trouble picking a winner of the Super
Bowl still have plenty of opportunities for
action. That city's bookmakers are offer

ing a potpourri ot "proposition bets" on
every phase of the game.
Will there be more or fewer than two
tumbles lost in the game? Will there be
more or fewer than three field goals?
Which team will lead in time of posses
sion? You can lay 11 to 10 and bet on any
of these propositions.
You can lay $1.40 to $1 and take the
Raiders plus half a point in the tirst quar
ter. You can lay $1.55 to $1 and bet that
|ohn Riggins will < arry the ball fewer than
28Vi times. ("The sharpies really came in
on that one," a Las Vegas source said.)
The most popular and widespread form
of special wagering is on "totals" — the
total number of points scored in a game.
The line on the Super Bowl is 48Vi, and
the handicappers surveyed are inclined to
think the total will go over that number.
"Normally in a Super Bowl, teams are in
clined to be conservative," Turner said.
"But I don't think these teams will. Arid I
think they'll both be able to move the
ball."
Feist's major recommendation to his
customers will be to bet "over 48",*.'
"Offensive football is in now," he said,
"and these are two of the best offenses in
years. I don't feel any defense can con
tain these offenses, and I suspect the total
on this game will go into the 60s, maybe
even the 70s. I will recommend a bet on
the over for business, and a bet on Wash
ington for entertainment."

From I he Washington Post
A year ago, when the Redskins faced
Dallas and Miami in the playoffs, the
smart money was on Washington.
Handicappers for top sports-advisory
services agreed that the Redskins were
underdogs in both games only because
their opponents were teams that the
public has traditionally loved to bet. It
was a classic situation; The best team was
getting points.
But a lot has (hanged between that
game and Super Howl XVIII, in which the
Redskins are three-point favorites over
the Los Angeles Raiders.
"The betting line is wrong," declared
Rich Bomze, publisher of the Sports
Reporter, one of the handicappers who
loved the Redskins last season.
"Washington was only a two-point favor
ite at home against LA. this fall when the
Raiders had a lot of key players out. This
game ought to be pick-'em. The odds
makers are making you pay for betting
the new America's team."
The Super Bowl teams figure so close
that professional handicappers and bet
tors have difficulty formulating a strong
opinion on the game.
"The public's interest is very strong be
cause these are popular teams," said Las
Vegas handicappc r Russell Culver, "but
there haven't been any overwhelming
moves by the wise guys here. There's a
good chance the\ may bet more on the

UCLA basketball game the same day.'
Fven though it may be tough to pick a
winner, the proprietors of sports services
are obliged to tell their clients something.
For the most part, the handicappers are
telling them to bet Washington, judi
ciously:
• Jim Feist of National Sports Services in
Las Vegas: "The biggest statistic in the
game is the turnover ratio in favor of the
Redskins, and their consistency should
be the major factor. But if this weren't the
Super Bowl, I would pass the game."
• Bom/e: "The Redskins have got consis
tency, character and a recent winning
tradition, and I like Theismann over
Plunkett. But I'm telling people that
laying three points is a sucker play; they
shouldn't be too heavy."
• Ron Lowe of Washington's Capital
Sports Service: "I like the 'Skins because
of the quarterback matchup Plunkett's
an immobile quarterback and the
Redskins feast on immobile quarter
backs."
•Steve Turner of the lexas Sports Wire:
"I'll take the Raiders; I think their sec
ondary gives them an edge and I think
their line can play with the Hogs. But if
this were the regular season, I'd have no
opinion.
Handicappers in Las Vegas who have
trouble picking a winner of the Super
Bowl still have plenty of opportunities for
action. That city's bookmakers are offer

ing a potpourri ot "proposition bets" on
every phase of the game.
Will there be more or fewer than two
tumbles lost in the game? Will there be
more or fewer than three field goals?
Which team will lead in time of posses
sion? You can lay 11 to 10 and bet on any
of these propositions.
You can lay $1.40 to $1 and take the
Raiders plus half a point in the tirst quar
ter. You can lay $1.55 to $1 and bet that
|ohn Riggins will < arry the ball fewer than
28Vi times. ("The sharpies really came in
on that one," a Las Vegas source said.)
The most popular and widespread form
of special wagering is on "totals" — the
total number of points scored in a game.
The line on the Super Bowl is 48Vi, and
the handicappers surveyed are inclined to
think the total will go over that number.
"Normally in a Super Bowl, teams are in
clined to be conservative," Turner said.
"But I don't think these teams will. Arid I
think they'll both be able to move the
ball."
Feist's major recommendation to his
