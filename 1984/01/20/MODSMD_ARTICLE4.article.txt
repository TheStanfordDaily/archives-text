# Money, practice site dilemmas cloud water for sailing team
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
After a year of smooth sailing, the
Stanford sailing program may be
headed for rough waters.
During the past year the program
lias invested more than $100,000 on
equipment and operations at its
tacility in Redwood City. But now
uncertainty over the future of that
tacility's lease is making Director of
Sailing joseph Petrucci reluctant to
invest the final $10,000 needed to
complete the project.
The sailing facility sits on land
which the program leases from
Leslie Salt Co. on a year-to-year
basis â€” and the company isn't cer
tain it can continue that lease.
Petrucci said the University may
attempt to gain a "bargain sale" of
the property from Leslie. In such a
deal Leslie would undersell the
property and take the difference
trom the actual value of the land as a
lax write-off. However, Leslie has
turned down one such offer already.
According to Athletic Director
Andy Geiger, the University "has
not actively pursued purchase of the
land." He added, however, that the
University may ask Leslie to give the
land to the sailing program outright.
Since last fall, when the program
first moved to the site, located along
Highway 101 and Seaport Boulevard,
donations in kind totalling more
than $100,000 have been used to im
prove the facilities, Petrucci said.
Because sailing is a club sport, it is
financed solely through fund raising

done by Petrucci and other mem
bers of the sailing program, Geiger
said.
A great deal of work has already
gone into the Redwood City site.
After adding "hundreds of tons of
fill" and grading the site, under
ground plumbing, piling, docks and
an office and a storage building
were erected, Petrucci said.
The office, which he said is valued
at nearly $50,000, is modular and
could be moved along with the
storage building and docks to an
other site if the lease is lost. The
program uses temporary docks

donated trom the site of last year's
sailing headquarters, Pete's Harbor.
Petrucci called the present loca
tion, which is about 20 minutes from
campus, an "ideal" one. He added
that if the sailing program were
moved to a site further from
campus, the actual workout and
class time would be cut to a mini
mum.
If the University were to receive
permanent control of the land,
sailing could possibly become a
year-round sport at Stanford, offer
ing instruction, recreation and com
petition, Petrucci said.
