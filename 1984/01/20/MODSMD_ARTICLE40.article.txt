Its happened: You just got a job or found
out you were admitted to law school. Whatever
the occasion, large or small, L'Olivier is the
perfect place to celebrate.
Tucked away off Jackson Street close to Em
hart adero Center, I Olivier appears to be the
type ot place with a regular clientle. People felt
very much at ease, and most parties lingered
over their coffee almost as long as we did.
The decor is chic — very tasteful and not os
tentatious. Pink tablecloths and beige carpet
give the restaurant an open, airy feeling, while
the wood breakfronts and other wood
furniture provide warmth. Fresh flowers,
candles and beautiful china on every table also
provide a personal touch.
Our waiter promptly brought us two leather
bound menus, and proceded to tell us both the
daily specials and his personal recommen
dations from the menu. Before we go any fur
ther, we must stress that the service was impec
cable. At first we thought that our identity had
been discovered, but after watching our waiter
we noticed that he was equally attentive to all
his tables.
While waiting for our meal to begin, our
waiter brought us a basket filled with miniature
slices of French bread — suitable for spreading
with pate or later dipping into leftover sauce.
(While one of us kept exclaiming how adorable
the arrangement was, the other finished off
three slices.)
After an eloquent description from our
waiter of two appetizers, we couldn't resist
trying both. The first, Mousseline de Crabe
($5), proved to be excellent. This consisted of
jellied and formed crab, covered with lobster
sauce, and served with a puffed pastry shell on
the side. It was delicately seasoned and the
lobster sauce was a perfect compliment. Our
other choice, Saucisse de Fruits de Mer aux
Deux Sauce ($5), was more fondly known as
seafood sausage. Shrimp, crab and other
whitefish were molded and put into a skin
which did indeed resemble a large sausage. It
was served with the same lobster sauce and an
incredibly wonderful cream sauce (obviously
our favorite). The sausage itself was delectable
— the combination of seafood was perfect,
while each type of fish also retained its own dis
tinct flavor.
For our next course, we chose Soupe a

I'Oignon Granitee ($3.50). The onion soup was
baked just right, with an abundance of Gruyere
cheese melted on top. We didn't try the potage
du jour ($2.50), but our waiter described it as a
puree ot vegetables in a light cream sauce.
(Well, maybe next time.)
To accompany our meal, we ordered a bottle
of Round Hill Chardonnay from L'Olivier's ex
tensive list of French and Californian wines.
Our attentive waiter also unobtrusively kept
our glasses full throughout the evening.
Although praise can get monotonous, we
can't give our entrees anything but praise. The
Rosette d'Agneau a I'Estragon ($l6), filet of
lamb in tarragon sauce, consisted of three
savory and tender filets covered with a deli
cious sauce that had a hint of anise. The lamb
was accompanied by somewhat nondescript
string beans and what we termed "scalloped
potato pie" — thin potato slices baked with
cheese on top and served in a wedge. (We're
still sure that somewhere there's a better name
for it because it was so tasty.)
Our other entree was the fresh fish ot the
day, or Poisson Frais de la Maree ($l3). The
seafood panache was comprised of a large
prawn, scallops, and one tender and one meaty
whitefish. All were then poached and smot
hered in a delicate cream sauce. A variety of
steamed vegetables surrounded the seafood.
Again, we pronounced this dish a winner
Other recommendations from our waiter in
cluded Escalope de Saumon a la Ciboulette,
fresh salmon in white butter sauce and chives
($l3), and Tournedos au Raiford, filet mignon
with an understated horseradish sauce ($l5). A
few other entrees included loin of veal, filet of
rabbit and rack of lamb, ranging from $12 to
$16.
Of course we couldn't linger over coffee
without dessert, and from the large selection
we chose Framboises au Gratin (fresh
raspberries in a cream glace — $4.50), and
Charlotte a la Fraise (strawberry mousse sur
rounded by angel food cake soaked in raspber
ry paste — $2.50). Both were exquisite — a per
fect ending to a delightful meal.
In addition to the excellent cuisine, the other
attractions of L'Olivier — having fresh sil
verware brought to the table on a platter be
tween every course, and having the car waiting
at the front door at the close of our meal
make lunch or dinner here a memorable expe
rience.
L'Olivier is closed on Sundays and reserva
tions are recommended.
