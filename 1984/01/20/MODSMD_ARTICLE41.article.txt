# Not too spicy—an Indian restaurant for beginners
## 
### 
THE KUNDAN
601 Van Ness Avenue
San Francisco
673-5600
Now, I know that a lot of you are ap
prehensive about trying Indian food
because you're afraid that you will un
knowingly order a hot curry dish that
will permanently scorch your taste
buds. And maybe some of you like In
dian food or are at least willing to try it,
but you never go to an Indian restau
rant because you have heard that they
are all dingy storefront establishments.
If you fit either of these descrip
tions, then The Kundan may be the an
swer to your problem. The Kundan of
fers a wide selection of fine quality
food and most of the dishes are
prepared with less spice than is found
at many other Indian restaurants. In
addition, The Kundan has three, softly
: lit dining rooms which provide a com
fortable atmosphere for enjoying your
meal.
I Be sure to begin your meal with any
of the numerous appetizers that are of
fered. I would especially recommend a
Nawab dish called Shami Kabab

AwancJi — finely ground lamb
seasoned with rich spices and
Himalayan herbs ($3.50). You might
also try the Vegetable Somozas —
crisp, flaky deep-fried turnovers
stuffed with spiced potatoes, onions,
carrots and peas and served with mint,
chutney and yogurt sauces.
The Kundan specializes in the
cuisine of Northern India, particularly
in the use of the tandoor. A tandoor is
a clay oven in which a blazing wood or
charcoal fire sears all types of meat in
just moments. The effect of this
"awesomely fiery oven" is to seal in
the natural juices of the meat as well as
the remains of the marinade in which it
has been steeping.
Murgh (chicken) Tandoori is the
classic dish of this type of cooking, and
the rendition created at The Kundan is
one of the best items on the menu.
The chicken is marinated in yogurt and
enough spices to open a spice store;
then it is exquisitely cooked in the tan
door and garnished with lemon juice.
This dish is not overly spicy, but the
delicate flavor of the chicken is truly
special.

In addition to chicken, The Kundan
offers two beef and two lamb entrees
that are also cooked in the tandoor
Unfortunately, our other two dishes
were not nearly as interesting nor as
tasty as the Murgh Tandoori. Although
Lamb Johl Fraizee ($l4) is supposedly a
specialty of the house, I was disap
pointed. The lamb was tender and the
onions and green peppers were tasty,
but it lacked any special qualities.
Usually, Johl Fraizee is very spicy and
hot, but my entree was quite mild and
devoid of the normally prominent
onion aroma and flavor.
In addition, the Chicken Makhani
($9), boneless chicken cooked in a but
ter sauce, offered only a mild hint of
curry. In fact, it bordered on being
bland which is surprising for an Indian
restaurant. Other entrees include the
standard Roghan Josh — tender lamb
cooked in butter with onions, ginger
root, garlic and tomatoes — and an in
teresting vegetarian dish called Chana
Masala — chick peas cooked with
tomatoes, spices and a sea of herb
The Kundan also offers a varietv of
Indian breads which are an essential

accompaniment to any meal. Chan
gaize Naan is an unleavened wheat
bread that puffs up like a balloon when
it is placed in the hot tandoor oven. Or
else try the Onion Kulcha — a deli
cious puffy bread that is stuffed with
onions.
All in all, I would have to say that The
Kundan is not a bad restaurant, but
then again, it isn't a great restaurant.
The quality of the food is very high,
and the service is polite and impec
cable, though they evoke an air of for
mality that can be disconcerting.
Unfortunately, The Kundan just
does not live up to its reputation — it is
not nearly as good as its companion
restaurant in London. It seems as
though The Kundan has changed its
cuisine slightly to match what they
consider to be American tastes —
which is really too bad. The Kundan
does not offer the type of spicy Indian
cuisine which I adore, but I would still
recommend this restaurant to those
who have never tried Indian food
before, or for those who do not like
extremely spicy food.
