Polish jokes have been stan
dard fare for years, but not at
the Warszawa restaurant in
Berkeley.
Though in this area
Chinese, Italian, )apanese,
Vietnamese and French res
taurants are as common as the
"How many Poles does it take
to screw in a light bulb?" joke,
it is difficult to find a restau
rant offering an Eastern
European flavor. This where
Warszawa fits the bill: It spe
cializes in Polish cuisine.
On the whole, eating at
Warsawa is an enjoyable,
though filling, experience:
We walked through the
front garden and climbed the
stairs leading to the oak door
of the restaurant. Upon going

through that door we entered
another world: the Old
World. Perhaps because it is
run by a Polish couple and
built into the lower floor of a
house, Warszawa has a
familial atmosphere. It
embraced us.
What used to be the front
parlor is now filled with red
checkered tablecloths and
straight-backed chairs. The
partially brick walls and Polish
folk art hanging on them
create a warm feeling which is
reinforced by the crackling
fire set into the closest wall.
The waitress sat us next to the
fireplace.
Savoring the dusky, oaky
Polish wine suggested by the
maitre d', we pondered the
menu. This is easier done than
said — I found ordering to be
quite an ordeal due to the

overabundance of consonants
in Polish words. Luckily, my
dinner partner was born in
Poland and knew enough
Polish to get through the
menu.
We started with Kabanosy
Flam be ($3), spicy polish
sausages flamed in Polish
Vodka. They looked like hot
dogs soaked in gin and then
set on fire. They tasted about
the same. We would have
probably been better off with
the Watrobka Po Polsku
(chopped liver polonaise for
$2.25). But the wine and Polish
black bread covered the
shortcomings of the hot dogs
flambe.
The soups more than made
up for the appetizer. My com
panion had Barszcz or borsht
($3), a shredded beet soup

with a sour cream base and I
had the Grochowka ($3), a
hearty pea soup garnished
with smoked ham. The
Barszcz was good, by all
reports, and the pea soup was
absolutely terrific.
All the culinary preamble —
appetizer, soup, wine and
bread — is probably enough
for most California appetites,
or any appetite. Warszawa's
food is well-prepared but it
errs on the side of heaviness.
To be fair, my partner said this
is probably due to the Polish
style of cooking rather than
any mistake on the part of the
chef.
Our entrees, generous to
say the least, carried on this
Polish tradition. I had Pieczen
Wieprzowa ($11.50) a pork
loin roast prepared with Polish
herbs and spices and served
with fresh vegetables. A Polish
favorite, the roast was moist
but the spices were a little

sweet for my taste. But the
vegetable chef must have
taken a lesson from one of the
many Chinese or Japanese res
taurants in the area; the side
dish of vegetables was freshly
crisp and delicately spiced.
The Nalesniki ($9.95) which
my dinner partner chose were
the high point of the evening.
Crepes filled with meat, mush
rooms and sour cream, they
were like a Polish version of a
Vietnamese spring roll and
they were just as delicious.
The crepes were golden and
lightly crisped and filling was
heartily spiced. The vegetable
side dish was, like mine, ter
rific.
If you can handle it — we
couldn't — the desserts at
Warszawa brought rave
reviews from the party at the
next table. The homemade
walnut torte and the iced cof
fee with ice cream, whipped
cream and nuts seemed to be
the favorites.
As we left, the proprietors
bid us a warm good-bye, a
warm touch, a warm restau
rant. Warszawa is a piece of
the Old World in Berkeley
which, despite its shortcom
ings, is worth a return visit.

the Watrobka Po Polsku
(chopped liver polonaise for
$2.25). But the wine and Polish
black bread covered the
shortcomings of the hot dogs
flambe.
The soups more than made
up for the appetizer. My com
panion had Barszcz or borsht
($3), a shredded beet soup

with a sour cream base and I
had the Grochowka ($3), a
hearty pea soup garnished
with smoked ham. The
Barszcz was good, by all
reports, and the pea soup was
absolutely terrific.
All the culinary preamble —
appetizer, soup, wine and
bread — is probably enough
for most California appetites,
or any appetite. Warszawa's
food is well-prepared but it
errs on the side of heaviness.
To be fair, my partner said this
is probably due to the Polish
style of cooking rather than
any mistake on the part of the
chef.
Our entrees, generous to
say the least, carried on this
Polish tradition. I had Pieczen
Wieprzowa ($11.50) a pork
loin roast prepared with Polish
herbs and spices and served
with fresh vegetables. A Polish
favorite, the roast was moist
but the spices were a little

sweet for my taste. But the
vegetable chef must have
taken a lesson from one of the
many Chinese or Japanese res
taurants in the area; the side
dish of vegetables was freshly
crisp and delicately spiced.
The Nalesniki ($9.95) which
my dinner partner chose were
the high point of the evening.
Crepes filled with meat, mush
rooms and sour cream, they
were like a Polish version of a
Vietnamese spring roll and
they were just as delicious.
The crepes were golden and
lightly crisped and filling was
heartily spiced. The vegetable
side dish was, like mine, ter
rific.
If you can handle it — we
couldn't — the desserts at
Warszawa brought rave
reviews from the party at the
next table. The homemade
walnut torte and the iced cof
fee with ice cream, whipped
cream and nuts seemed to be
the favorites.
As we left, the proprietors
bid us a warm good-bye, a
warm touch, a warm restau
rant. Warszawa is a piece of
the Old World in Berkeley
which, despite its shortcom
ings, is worth a return visit.
