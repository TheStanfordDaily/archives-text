## Truckee bed and breakfast: all the comforts of home 
### CATHY JANUS 
Visiting new places can be
very exciting, and when travel
ing, one naturally wants the
experience to be as
pleasurable as possible. This
involves finding a place to go
where you'll enjoy the accom
modations and restaurants, as
well as the activities available
in the area.
Choosing lodging is often
no easy task, however. While
standard hotels and motels
pride themselves on their
cleanliness and comfort, they
fail to provide the true
luxuries of home. Warm per
sonal touches are missing.
Now, however, this drawback
to traveling has been allevi
ated by the introduction of
bed and breakfast inns around
the United States. Though not
a new idea, the number of bed
and breakfast inns is growing
steadily as their popularity in
creases.
Europeans have always
loved the bed and breakfast
tradition, and it is not difficult
to understand why a person
would prefer to stay at such a
place. Taking the Central
Truckee exit off Highway 80, I
drove to the Bradley House,
an 1880's large Victorian home
with a panoramic view of the
town and the snow-covered
mountains.
Stepping into the foyer, I
was greeted by Donna Bradley

and her young son, Alex, who
proceeded to give me a tour of
their lovely house. Donna
restored the house to its
original elegance, furnishing it
with antiques passed down
through the family and pur
chased at auctions in Orange
County.
The parlor is heated by an
antique wood-burning stove.
The sofas and chairs invite you
to relax and watch the color
television which is especially
appealing because a video cas
sette recorder complete with
current films including The
Blues Brothers and Kramer vs.
Kramer accompanies the TV.
The room was warm and cozy
and made especially attractive
by the oak and stained-glass
backed bar dated about 1900
and the antique telephone
hanging on the wall.
There are five upstairs
bedrooms and a downstairs
"cabin" reserved for lodgers.
Hand-made Amish quilts cov
er the beds, the upstairs win
dows offer some spectacular
views, and everything is de
signed with warmth and com
fort in mind. The cabin, so
named because it has a private
entrance and bathroom, is
decorated in a rustic motif,
complete with a woodstove.
Rates for the rooms range
from $40-60 per night and in
clude wine and cheese served
in the parlor between 5 and

6:00 p.m. As the name
implies, breakfast is also in
cluded.
To accommodate skiers,
Mrs. Bradley begins serving
breakfast at 7:30 in the dining
room on a roll-top oak table.
Mrs. Bradley serves fresh fruit
in season as well as home
made apple strudel. Her rec
ipe is borrowed from her
Austrian mother and Mrs.
Bradley says her sisters claim

she has only improved the
original recipe. I found the ap
ple strudel very tasty: It was
flaky and warm. Home-baked
muffins, banana bread and
carrot cake completed the
menu.
To get to the main street in
town simply involves walking
down the street. Unlike the
area further south beginning
at Squaw Valley, Truckee is
graced with slightly warmer

weather and less snowfall. We
could walk around the town in
comfort.
In winter, skiing at Squaw
Valley is a mere 10-15 minutes
drive. Skiing at Squaw is
cheaper than at Heavenly Val
ley, especially if you take ad
vantage of discounts tickets
available at Lucky super
markets. Other popular
recreations in Truckee include
cross-country skiing, hiking

lulie Ha^an/Daily
and in the warmer seasons,
river-rafting and camping.
Tahoe City and Lake Tahoe are
only 15 miles away, offering
water activities, quaint shops
and more restaurants.
Fine restaurants can also be
found in Truckee itself. A tew
minutes walk from the Brad
ley's (on the main street) are
sporting goods stores, desig
ner clothing shops, pubs and
unique eating establishments.
We chose to eat at 0.8.'s
Pub and Restaurant, a restau
rant I'd recommend to anyone
who insists on both pleasing
atmosphere and excellent
food. The wood panelling and
stone interior was warm and
cozy.
To the right of the entrance
is the bar, which we had only a
few minutes time to admire
before we were seated. It is
possible to have a drink and/or
appetizers in the bar area
before being seated. After
skiing, it is nice to relax with a
hot buttered rum or one of the
other many winter cocktails
served at 0.8.'5. Choices in
clude Keoke, Irish, lamaican,

Dutch, and Hawaiian coffees,
the Snuggler (hot chocolate,
peppermint schnapps,
whipped cream and cream de
cocoa), and Tea and Sympathy
(tea laced with Grand Mar
nier).
The decor of 0.8.'s comple
ments the area. The cloth nap
kins are decorated in country
style patterns, water is served
from iron kettles, mining lan
terns and stone coffee mugs
adorn the walls, and flowers
add a special touch to the dim
ly lit booths. 0.8.'s success
fully creates an intimate atmo
sphere.
Furthermore, the meals are
excellent. For my main course
I chose barbecued ribs, one of
the specialties of the house.
The menu features dinner
specialties in three categories
— beef, seafood and chicken
— and they include
homemade soup or salad, a
choice of baked potato, rice
pilaf, pasta or steak fries, and
warm bread and butter. The
dinners range in price from
$7.95 to $14.95. Selections for
less than $5.50 are featured in
the caboose section and in
clude soup and salad, the
O'Burger and a child's plate.
When my meal arrived, I felt
overwhelmed by the very
generous portion of ribs, the
potato and fresh fruit. After
one bite of the ribs, so tender
they fell off the bone, I knew I
was going to be capable of
eating everything and
"suffering" the consequences
later! My friend ordered the
Surf 'n' Turf, a petite top sir
loin with shrimp tempura,
which he also considered first
rate.
Tempting desserts are of
fered for those who want to
prolong the enjoyment of
their dining experience. There
is quite a variety including ice
cream sundaes, chocolate
mousse pie and mud pie. The
atmosphere, food and service
are exceptional at 0.8.'s and I
encourage anyone traveling
through or staying in Truckee
to dine there.
