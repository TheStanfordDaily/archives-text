The Thief of Bagdad (1940)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The hero of this magnificent
Arabian Nights fantasy ad
venture, Prince Ahmed (John
Justin), has liquid brown eyes
and a light, teasing moustache,
and the villain, the Grand
Vizier Jaffer (Conrad Veidt),
stands on a tower, shrouded in
white, his arms upraised as he
invokes the winds to visit the
sea — a great fairy tale image.
Ludwig Berger, Michael Powell
and Tim Whelan (credited) and
producers Alexander Korda,
Zoltan Korda and William
Cameron Menzies
(uncredited) all had a hand in
the direction, and Miles Mal
leson and Lajos Biro col
laborated on the clumsy,
confusing screenplay, which
you forget about whenever
there's a new set (Vincent
Korda was the designer) or a
new effect. Except for Conrad
Veidt, who is the soul of
malevolence, and Rex Ingram
as a djinni with a laugh that
causes tidal waves, the acting
is mostly Grade B, but the
movie has such an amiable
spirit and so many magical se
quences (in the best one, the
thief, played by Sabu, eludes a
giant spider on an immense
web) that it transcends all its
shortcomings. Malleson makes
an appearance, memorably, as
the childish Sultan, who is ad
dicted to toys, and )une
Duprez plays his daughter, the
object of " hmed's affection.
Plays ' orrow and Sunday
afterm n

Kramer vs. Kramer (1979)
Kresge Auditorium
An exceptionally good soap
opera chronicling a man's
growth as a father and conse
quently as a human being
when his wife abandons him
and his son. Robert Benton
based his intelligent
screenplay on a popular be
stseller by Avery Corman, and
he directed, also with intelli
gence. As Ted Kramer, Dustin
Hoffman gives his most
meticulously worked out, most
finely detailed and most
moving performance so far.
With Meryl Streep, who almost
manages to humanize the role
of Ted's wife )oanna, Justin
Henry and Jane Alexander.
Plays tonight.
The In-Laws (1979)
Cubberley Auditorium
The script of this comedy by
Andrew Bergman has enough
clever ideas to keep it going
for two-thirds of the way, but
Arthur Hiller's direction kills
much of it. He doesn't know
how to structure or pace a
scene, and he tends to either
misread the tone of a situation
or else give it no tone at all.
However, Alan Arkin and Peter

Falk are hilarious as a conser
vative dentist and his wacky in
law-to-be, and Richard
Libertini contributes a sweet,
loony bit as a the military dic
tator of a banana republic.
Plays tonight.
The Lion in Winter (1968)
Lagunita Dining Room;
Madera Lounge
"Every family has its ups and
downs," admits Eleanor of
Aquitaine (Katharine Hepburn)
after a colossal Christmas row
with her husband, King Henry
II (Peter O'Toole), who keeps
her imprisoned in a castle far
from his own the rest of the
year and only tolerates her
presence — for the sake of ap
pearances — at Vuletide.
Medieval England has never
seemed so drab and dirty as in
this pointlessly cynical, reduc
tionist historical melodrama by
James Goldman (adapting his
own Broadway play), directed
by Anthony Harvey with ex
cessive attention to uninterest
ing detail. If it weren't for the
sour tone and the tastefully
boring style of the production,
Goldman's depiction of the

royal family as petty, squab
bling egotists might be
amusing. Katharine Hepburn's
power is diminished by a
slightly depressing sentimen
tality (as it has been in almost
all of her subsequent appear
ances, too), but Peter O'Toole
gives a near-great performance
as King Henry. (He had played
a much younger, randier
Henry in Becket four years ear
lier.) Anthony Hopkins, Nigel
Terry and Timothy Dalton play
the sibling princes.
Plays Monday evening
(Lagunita) and Tuesday eve
ning (Madera).
The Blue Angel (1929)
Kresge Auditorium
Josef von Sternberg's Holly
wood films quickly descended
into kitsch, but there is no
debate about the quality of this
German semi-expressionist
classic, adapted (by Karl Zuck
mayer, Karl Vollmoller and
Robert Liebmann) from Hein
rich Mann's novel Professor
Unrath." Emil Jannings gives a
superlative demonstration of
how repressed sexuality — the
unlived life — leads to unrea

sonable infatuation, emotional
blindness and finally self
contempt and violence. He
plays a small-town
schoolmaster who, learning
that his adolescent pupils have
been visiting a local dive to
watch the overtly sexual per
formances of the singer, Lola
(Marlene Dietrich), shows up
at the club to protest and falls
hopelessly, foolishly in love
with her. The professor's pas
sion is balanced by Lola's
sneering dispassionateness.
What Dietrich does in this film
may or may not be acting, but
it's amazing — and it made her
a star. Friedrich Hollaender
wrote "Falling in Love Again"
and the other songs.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Apocalypse Now (1979)
lerman Auditorium
Francis Ford Coppola's ver
sion of "Heart of Darkness,"
set in the jungles of Vietnam.
Vittorio Storaro has shot the
film in Conrad's colors — deep
greens with a heavy white mist
— and the sound recording,
designed by Walter Murch and
executed in Dolby Stereo, is
awesome; the best sequences
are surreal, nightmarish. Un
fortunately, during the three
years of shooting Coppola
must have lost his hold on his

ideas. The movie lacks focus,
and its hero, Captain Willard
(inexpressively played by Mar
tin Sheen), is such a zombie
from the beginning that there's
nowhere for him to go. Kurtz is
played by Marlon Brando, who
reads "The Hollow Men"
aloud and gives an opaque
performance. If crazy
Lieutenant Kilgore (Robert
Duvall), who bombs islands so
that he can surf off them, had
been used as the symbol for
this war rather than Kurtz, the
movie might have made more
sense. However, the helicop
ter attack sequence is worth
seeing the movie for: It is just
about the best war footage
ever put on film.
Plays tomorrow evening.
The Last Waltz (1978)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The Band (Robbie
Robertson, Rick Danko, Levon
Helm, Garth Hudson and Rich
ard Manuel) played their last
concert in Bill Graham's ele
gant old palace, the Winter
land, on Thanksgiving Day,
1977, and Martin Scorsese
filmed it, using the most
phenomenal camera crew ever
assembled: Vilmos Zsigmond,
Michael Chapman, Laszlo
Kovacs, David Myers, Bobby
Byrne, Hiro Narita and Michael
Watkins. Most filmed concerts
make you ache, hopelessly, to
be sitting in the audience up
on the screen, but not this one
— it's impossible to imagine
that there could be a better
vantage point than Scorsese
has provided. It's a dramati
cally intimate, exuberant
movie — certainly the best of
all rock movies. The guest per
former list includes Bob Dylan,
Paul Butterfield, Joni Mitchell,
Eric Clapton, Emmylou Harris,
Ringo Starr, Dr. John, Van
Morrison, Ronnie Hawkins,
The Staple Singers, Ron Wood,
Neil Diamond (regrettably), a
fascinating, paranoid-looking
Neil Young and the formidable
Muddy Waters singing
"Mannish Boy." That Robert
De Niro look-alike, Rick
Danko, performs the two best
numbers, "Stage Fright" and
"It Makes No Difference."
Plays tonight with No Nukes.
Trouble in Paradise (19.J2)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Ernst Lubitsch directed com
edy with a light, dry-hand; his
characters were often cheer
fully amoral and his best films
were triumphs of elegance and
delicacy, though (except for
Ninotchka and The Shop
Around the Corner) essentially
synthetic. Trouble in Paradise
is one of the funniest of these
epicurean comedies. Miriam
Hopkins and Herbert Marshall
play jewel thieves who rob
each other and then fall in
love; Kay Francis is delightful
as a fatuous, pampered, but
extraordinarily graceful mil
lionairess; and Edward Everett
Horton and Charles Ruggles
offer hilarious contributions in
supporting roles. ("Look here,
my good man," Ruggles says to
Horton, "you've been saying
goodbye for half an hour and
staying on. I wish you'd say

how-d'ye-do' and leave.")
Samson Raphaelson and
Grover Jones adapted the
screenplay from Laszlo
Aladar's play The Honest
Finder.
Plays Monday evening with
To Be or Not to Be (1942 ver
sion).
The Seven Samurai (1954)
Festival, Palo Alto
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spec
tacular adventure, set amid the
civil wars in 16th-century
Japan. A community of farm
ers, slowly starving under the
double burden of land taxes
and the raids of brigands, hires
samurai to protect it, and
swords really start to fly. The
characters have a funny,
foolish braggadocio, and the
actors (Toshiro Mifune,
Takashi Shimura, Voshi Inaba,
etc.) - give stylized perfor
mances reminiscent of the
silent comedies. The real star,
of course, is Kurosawa, who
displays the kind of witty mas
tery of film technique that still
makes audiences grin. Take
note; This is the full-length
version of the film.
Plays through Wednesday.
H'/ 2 (1963)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Or, The Price of Fame.
Federico Fellini's dream revue
about a famous film director
whose self-doubts result in a
creative block concerns itself
with how great filmmakers
turn their own fantasies and
the unresolved shreds of their
lives into art. This self
proclaiming autobigoraphy has
more glamor than pain in it,
however, and it has a
handsome movie star in the
"Fellini" role — Marcello
Mastroianni. Some of the se
quences are extraordinarily
compelling (and Gianni Di
Venanzo has shot them in gor
geous black and white), but
Fellini cheats on the ambigu
ous overlapping-levels-of
reality structure by making all
the supporting characters, es
pecially the adoring women,
so extravagantly absurd that
you can't take any of them
seriously. Guido (Mastroianni)
is a questionable hero: his sen
sitivity has such stringent limits
(that is, it's inner-directed) that
one's sympathy for him may
i.s a minority
opinion, however — BVi has
won over a dozen awards
(including the Oscar and the
New York Film Critics' prize for
Best Foreign Film), is widely
considered a masterpiece, and
has influenced many important
directors, among them Paul
Mazursky (Bob and Carol and
Ted and Alice, Alex in Wonder
land), Bob Fosse (All That jazz)
and Woody Allen (Stardust
Memories). With Anouk
Aimee, Sandra Milo, Claudia
Cardinale and Rossella Falk;
script by Fellini, Ennio Flaiano,
Tullio Pinelli and Brunello
Rondi.
Plays Thursday evening with
Day for Night.
