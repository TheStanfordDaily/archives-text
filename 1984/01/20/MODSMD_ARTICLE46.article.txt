Edit bored
Members of that bastion of Cross conser
vative thought, congregate at The Daily
promptly at noon for an edit board field trip
to The Goose.
New edit bored
Statements for the three at-large members
of the new edit board are due Monday. Grill
session is Tuesday noon. Be there for fried
liberals and crunchy conservative fun.
New staff bored
After days of secret back-room finagling,
Goodman, Cohn and Biddulph-more-than
he-could-chew have basically finished the
staff appointments for Vol. 185. Check the
sign board in The Daily office for all the excit
ing results.
