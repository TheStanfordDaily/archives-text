FCC delays access fee
Washington — The Federal Communications
Commission yielded to pressure from Congress yes
terday and voted to delay until mid-1985 a $2-a
month telephone access fee that was scheduled to
be imposed on consumers and small businesses in
April.
The FCC's preliminary ruling, which is expected to
be adopted formally next week, represents an
about-face from the agency's previous orders and
will have broad impact on the telecommmunications
industry, as well as consumers. American Telephone
& Telegraph Co., which called the agency's action
"extremely troublesome," said it jeopardizes the
company's proposal to cut long distance rates 10.5

percent in April.
The FCC action, however, represented a major
victory for AT & T's long-distance competitors, such
as MCI Communications Corp., and GTE Corp. The
ruling trimmed back the increases in fees those
companies must pay to hook up to local telephone
lines, thus allowing the firms to continue undercut
ting AT & T in the battle for iu.ig distance custom
ers.
FCC Chairman Mark Fowler, who said last month
that congressional legislation postponing access
fees would produce "an economic Lebanon," said
yesterday the agency was forced to act because of
criticism from the public and Congress.
"Certainly, we're sensitive to what Congress is
thinking," Fowler said when asked the reasons for
the agency's reversal. "Is it political? Yes. It has
become, unfortunately, a political issue."

The FCC's access-fee order, adopted last July, was
intended to replace long-standing Bell System sub
sidies that kept long-distance rates high in order to
maintain artificially low local telephone rates. Charg
ing consumers a flat monthly access fee for the
privilege of being connected to long-distance lines
would allow long-distance rates to come down, the
tCC said.
Reagan faces growing criticism
Washington — President Reagan faces growing
'lomestic criticism of his conduct of foreign policy,
especially in the Middle East and Central America,
iccording to a new Washington Post-ABC News Poll.
The poll reveals increased opposition to U.S. in
volvement in lebanon, a growing perception that
Reagan is attempting to do too much with the mili
tary overseas, a renewed resistance to entanglement

in Central America and a hardening of the belief that
foreign affairs, including the possibility of war, now
pose as great a problem for the country as economic
issues.
Overall, 50 percent give Reagan a negative rating
for his handling of foreign affairs, as low a rating as
he has ever received in a Post-ABC News Poll. The
survey strongly suggests, however, that many
people feel thaf forces outside the United States are
largely responsible for increasing world tension, and
that Reagan deserves credit for responding to those
forces, or at the worst, little of the blame.
But large numbers of citizens, often a majority, are
critical of Reagan for particular problems, especially
the presence of U.S. Marines in Lebanon. The poll,
conducted from |an. 12 to Jan. 17, shows f>o percent
saying they disapprove of Reagan's handling of the
situation in Lebanon, compared with 50 percent who
say they approve.
