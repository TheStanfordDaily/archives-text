FCC delays access fee
Washington — The Federal Communications
Commission yielded to pressure from Congress yes
terday and voted to delay until mid-1985 a $2-a
month telephone access fee that was scheduled to
be imposed on consumers and small businesses in
April.
The FCC's preliminary ruling, which is expected to
be adopted formally next week, represents an
about-face from the agency's previous orders and
will have broad impact on the telecommmunications
industry, as well as consumers. American Telephone
& Telegraph Co., which called the agency's action
"extremely troublesome," said it jeopardizes the
company's proposal to cut long distance rates 10.5

percent in April.
The FCC action, however, represented a major
victory for AT & T's long-distance competitors, such
as MCI Communications Corp., and GTE Corp. The
ruling trimmed back the increases in fees those
companies must pay to hook up to local telephone
lines, thus allowing the firms to continue undercut
ting AT & T in the battle for iu.ig distance custom
ers.
FCC Chairman Mark Fowler, who said last month
that congressional legislation postponing access
fees would produce "an economic Lebanon," said
yesterday the agency was forced to act because of
criticism from the public and Congress.
"Certainly, we're sensitive to what Congress is
thinking," Fowler said when asked the reasons for
the agency's reversal. "Is it political? Yes. It has
become, unfortunately, a political issue."

The FCC's access-fee order, adopted last July, was
intended to replace long-standing Bell System sub
sidies that kept long-distance rates high in order to
maintain artificially low local telephone rates. Charg
ing consumers a flat monthly access fee for the
privilege of being connected to long-distance lines
would allow long-distance rates to come down, the
tCC said.
Reagan faces growing criticism
Washington — President Reagan faces growing
'lomestic criticism of his conduct of foreign policy,
especially in the Middle East and Central America,
iccording to a new Washington Post-ABC News Poll.
The poll reveals increased opposition to U.S. in
volvement in lebanon, a growing perception that
Reagan is attempting to do too much with the mili
tary overseas, a renewed resistance to entanglement

in Central America and a hardening of the belief that
foreign affairs, including the possibility of war, now
pose as great a problem for the country as economic
issues.
Overall, 50 percent give Reagan a negative rating
for his handling of foreign affairs, as low a rating as
he has ever received in a Post-ABC News Poll. The
survey strongly suggests, however, that many
people feel thaf forces outside the United States are
largely responsible for increasing world tension, and
that Reagan deserves credit for responding to those
forces, or at the worst, little of the blame.
But large numbers of citizens, often a majority, are
critical of Reagan for particular problems, especially
the presence of U.S. Marines in Lebanon. The poll,
conducted from |an. 12 to Jan. 17, shows f>o percent
saying they disapprove of Reagan's handling of the
situation in Lebanon, compared with 50 percent who
say they approve.
Egypt to rejoin conference
Casablanca, Morocco — The Islamic Con
ference Organization today invited Egypt to
rejoin the organization at the end of a tour
day summit here.
The final communique of the 42 heads of
state or their representatives was announced
on television by Moroccan Foreign Minister
Mohammed Boucetta.
Boucetta said that the summit had made
the decision, but gave no further details.
Egypt's membership in the Islamic Confer
ence Organization was suspended in 1979
after Cairo's conclusion of the Camp David
agreements with Israel.
The Moroccan foreign minister said the
next Islamic summit would take place in
Kuwait, probably in 1987. He also said that
the summit had adopted a "charter of
Casablanca" but he did not define its con
tents.
Honduran helicopter report
Tegucigalpa, Honduras — A Honduran
Cabinet minister and a Honduran air force
operations officer said yesterday that the
U.S. helicopter downed near the Nicaraguan
border last week had plans to fly to the bor
der area.
Their statements underscored quest oris
raised Wednesday by the Honduran arm\ of
ficer in charge ot the border region about the
circumstances of the flight, which the United
States has said was accidentally 25 to 30 miles
off course when it was downed by gunfire
from Nicaraguan border troops.
U.S. officials here said they were
"absolutely convinced" that the aircraft was

not scheduled to be anywhere near the bor
der. But they said that U.S. Ambassador John
Negroponte had ordered all details ot the in
cident to be re-examined and that the embas
sy had gone to Honduran authorities seeking
an explanation of why the Honduran ac
counts have differed from those of the
United States.
U.S. helicopters on maneuvers here are
prohibited from coming closer than five
miles to the tense border, where Nicaraguan
troops have clashed repeatedly with
Honduran-based rebel groups. Nicaragua
has charged that the helicopter was on a sup
port mission to the CIA-backed rebels when
it violated Nicaraguan airspace and came un
der tire. It landed 100 yards inside Honduras,
where its pilot was killed under continuing
Nicaraguan guntire.
Shultz meets with Soviets
Oslo, Norway — Secretary ot State
George Shultz, acknowledging he made no
headway in reopening nuclear arms talks
with the Soviets, vowed yesterday the United
States would maintain its "willpower and
self-confidence" while seeking new oppor
tunities for negotiation.
Shultz said he had "nothing positive to
report" after his five-hour meeting in Stock
holm on Wednesday with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko on breaking the
deadlock in the negotiations.
But he also indicated the Soviets may be
preparing to reopen talks limiting conven
tional forces in Europe. The talks, suspended
a month ago, "are in a somewhat different
category for the Soviets.
The talks, called Mutual and Balanced
Force Reductions, focus on the troops sta
tioned in Europe by NATO and the Warsaw
Pact. In Stockholm, Foreign Minister Lennart
Bodstrom said they might begin by March.

Shultz meets with Soviets
Oslo, Norway — Secretary ot State
George Shultz, acknowledging he made no
headway in reopening nuclear arms talks
with the Soviets, vowed yesterday the United
States would maintain its "willpower and
self-confidence" while seeking new oppor
tunities for negotiation.
Shultz said he had "nothing positive to
report" after his five-hour meeting in Stock
holm on Wednesday with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko on breaking the
deadlock in the negotiations.
But he also indicated the Soviets may be
preparing to reopen talks limiting conven
tional forces in Europe. The talks, suspended
a month ago, "are in a somewhat different
category for the Soviets.
The talks, called Mutual and Balanced
Force Reductions, focus on the troops sta
tioned in Europe by NATO and the Warsaw
Pact. In Stockholm, Foreign Minister Lennart
Bodstrom said they might begin by March.

FCC delays access fee
Washington — The Federal Communications
Commission yielded to pressure from Congress yes
terday and voted to delay until mid-1985 a $2-a
month telephone access fee that was scheduled to
be imposed on consumers and small businesses in
April.
The FCC's preliminary ruling, which is expected to
be adopted formally next week, represents an
about-face from the agency's previous orders and
will have broad impact on the telecommmunications
industry, as well as consumers. American Telephone
& Telegraph Co., which called the agency's action
"extremely troublesome," said it jeopardizes the
company's proposal to cut long distance rates 10.5

percent in April.
The FCC action, however, represented a major
victory for AT & T's long-distance competitors, such
as MCI Communications Corp., and GTE Corp. The
ruling trimmed back the increases in fees those
companies must pay to hook up to local telephone
lines, thus allowing the firms to continue undercut
ting AT & T in the battle for iu.ig distance custom
ers.
FCC Chairman Mark Fowler, who said last month
that congressional legislation postponing access
fees would produce "an economic Lebanon," said
yesterday the agency was forced to act because of
criticism from the public and Congress.
"Certainly, we're sensitive to what Congress is
thinking," Fowler said when asked the reasons for
the agency's reversal. "Is it political? Yes. It has
become, unfortunately, a political issue."

The FCC's access-fee order, adopted last July, was
intended to replace long-standing Bell System sub
sidies that kept long-distance rates high in order to
maintain artificially low local telephone rates. Charg
ing consumers a flat monthly access fee for the
privilege of being connected to long-distance lines
would allow long-distance rates to come down, the
tCC said.
Reagan faces growing criticism
Washington — President Reagan faces growing
'lomestic criticism of his conduct of foreign policy,
especially in the Middle East and Central America,
iccording to a new Washington Post-ABC News Poll.
The poll reveals increased opposition to U.S. in
volvement in lebanon, a growing perception that
Reagan is attempting to do too much with the mili
tary overseas, a renewed resistance to entanglement

in Central America and a hardening of the belief that
foreign affairs, including the possibility of war, now
pose as great a problem for the country as economic
issues.
Overall, 50 percent give Reagan a negative rating
for his handling of foreign affairs, as low a rating as
he has ever received in a Post-ABC News Poll. The
survey strongly suggests, however, that many
people feel thaf forces outside the United States are
largely responsible for increasing world tension, and
that Reagan deserves credit for responding to those
forces, or at the worst, little of the blame.
But large numbers of citizens, often a majority, are
critical of Reagan for particular problems, especially
the presence of U.S. Marines in Lebanon. The poll,
conducted from |an. 12 to Jan. 17, shows f>o percent
saying they disapprove of Reagan's handling of the
situation in Lebanon, compared with 50 percent who
say they approve.
Egypt to rejoin conference
Casablanca, Morocco — The Islamic Con
ference Organization today invited Egypt to
rejoin the organization at the end of a tour
day summit here.
The final communique of the 42 heads of
state or their representatives was announced
on television by Moroccan Foreign Minister
Mohammed Boucetta.
Boucetta said that the summit had made
the decision, but gave no further details.
Egypt's membership in the Islamic Confer
ence Organization was suspended in 1979
after Cairo's conclusion of the Camp David
agreements with Israel.
The Moroccan foreign minister said the
next Islamic summit would take place in
Kuwait, probably in 1987. He also said that
the summit had adopted a "charter of
Casablanca" but he did not define its con
tents.
Honduran helicopter report
Tegucigalpa, Honduras — A Honduran
Cabinet minister and a Honduran air force

ficer in charge ot the border region about the
circumstances of the flight, which the United
States has said was accidentally 25 to 30 miles
off course when it was downed by gunfire
from Nicaraguan border troops.
U.S. officials here said they were
"absolutely convinced" that the aircraft was

not scheduled to be anywhere near the bor
der. But they said that U.S. Ambassador John
