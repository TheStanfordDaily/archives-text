### CLINT HIGHFILL 
Three writers and a consumer
advocate will speak here in ASSU
Speakers Bureau-sponsored appear
ances this quarter, and a labor cor
respondent and an environmentalist
may participate in the guest profes
sorship program spring quarter.
Playwright David Hwang, writer
Ken Kesey, poet Donald Justice and
consumer advocate Ralph Nader
have been scheduled to speak this
quarter, according to Katie Wine,
director of the Speakers Bureau.
Also, the ASSU Guest Professorship
Bureau has selected former New
York Times correspondent A.H. Ras
kin and environmentalist David
Brower to teach, said Enrique
Lerner, co-director of the bureau.
Hwang, a 1979 Stanford graduate
who has won international acclaim
as a playwright, will speak here on
Feb. 1. His plays have won critical
praise in major publications and in
clude "The Railroad," "FOB" and
"Dance."
Wine foresees Hwang discussing
the literary aspects of his plays, the
craft of playwrighting and how to
break into the playwright profes
sion.
In addition, Nader will speak in
Kresge Auditorium on Feb. 2.
Kesey, the author of "One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest," will read
from his works and discuss his cur
rent work on Feb. 8 at Kresge
Auditorium. Kesey did postgraduate
work at Stanford.
Justice, who has been a fellow in
poetry at both the Ford and Guggen
heim Foundations and has studied
at Stanford, will speak in early
March.
A hoped-for speech by
astronomer Carl Sagan "might
materialize and might not," accor
ding to Reid Sherline of the
Speakers Bureau. Sherline said the
Speakers Bureau has contacted a
Washington, D.C., speakers agency
and heard that Sagan will be in the
Bay Area, but no formal arrange
ments have been made. Funding, he
said, would have to be in conjunc
tion with another group such as the
Program Board.
Harold Washington, mayor of
Chicago, has also accepted an invi
tation to speak here, according to
Wine, but, she said, "We're still
working on the logistics."
Because it failed to get a fee as
sessment last spring, the Speakers
Bureau has been relying primarily
on "people who have Stanford at

tachments or are political candi
dates" and thus are asking for only a
small stipend, Wine said.
Raskin, who covered labor issues
for The New York Times for more
than 30 years and is writing a history
of the union movement since the
New Deal, will teach a course on
American labor since 1935 if the His
tory Department approves. Lerner
expects that decision later this
week, but said that the Guest
Professorship Bureau has yet to
decide whether Raskin will teach
spring quarter or next fall.
Environmentalist David Brower,
the founder of the Sierra Club and
Friends of the Earth who was a guest
professor here in 1981, may also
teach a class spring quarter. But de
partment approval is still pending,
Lerner said, adding that, "We still

have to look at budget considera
tions." His course is being organ
ized in conjunction with Stanford
for Environmental Education.
Also planned by the bureau is a
human rights conference in May. Fa
ther Robert Drinan, a human rights
activist and former Massachusetts
congressman, has already accepted
an invitation to attend, Lerner said,
but the bureau will invite other
speakers only after deciding which
issues will be discussed.
Lerner, saying that "human rights
is an important issue to keep in
mind in an election year," sugges
ted that Soviet Jews and human
rights in the U.S.S.R., Central
America, Argentina, Chile and
South Africa might be topics for the
conference.
