## The
						Stanford Daily No to Stadium 
### 
The memories of college graduation day are
usually a tradition passed down from class to
class, and for the past 45 classes of Stanford
graduates, that tradition has been Frost Amphi
theater. But this year's seniors will have a dif
ferent memory — one without a tradition. It's
either the Sunken Diamond pitcher's mound
or the Stanford Stadium press box.
After last spring's commencement, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy ordered a com
mission to investigate a possible move from
Frost. In 1983, at least 17,000 people crowded
into the amphitheater and others holding tick
ets were turned away. The review was
prompted by what some officials have describ
ed as a "dangerous situation" at the com
mencement exercises.
The senior class presidents were notified last
October of the decision to move the site and
the senior class has been given a chance to at
least — but maybe at most — voice their
opinions on their ceremony.
The issue seemed to come out of nowhere.
Before last week's forum for the senior class,
most about-to-be-graduates assumed they
would bid their final adieu in Frost. But some
hasty decisions had already precluded the am
phitheater as the site. Apparently, only a
second thought stopped the administration
from railroading the Stadium through as the
new spot.

The Administrative Council under Kennedy's
jurisdiction favors the Stadium for the home of
commencement, but it shouldn't. Sunken Dia
mond is a better site than the Stadium. Or,
more precisely, the Stadium is worse.
The two important criteria in choosing a site
are aesthetics and convenience. The Stadium
doesn't meet either. Aesthetics get a low score.
The bleachers are old and endless enough to
make a crowd of 20,000 seem like a bad tur
nout. And all the plants, flowers and decora
tions in the world won't make you forget that
you graduated in a football stadium.
The Stadium tallies low marks on the con
venience meter as well. If one of the chief
reasons for abandoning Frost was the danger
ous overcrowding effect on grandparents and
other oldsters, perhaps officials should con
sider the prospects of long stairways on some
of these weak hearts.
Most importantly, there is something intan
gibly unsettling about graduation at the
Stadium. Call it dismal memories of four years
of mediocre Cardinal football. Whatever it is,
the Stadium doesn't evoke the proper mood. If
we all had our druthers, graduation would
remain at Frost. Given the existing alternatives,
consider this a strong vote for Sunken Dia
mond . . . and against the Stadium.
