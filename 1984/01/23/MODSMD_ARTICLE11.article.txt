## Harvard students: a bottle of whine

News item: 47.6 percent of the
college presidents surveyed by U.S.
News and World Report named Har
vard as one of the five best places for
undergraduate education. Many
commentators played up the slightly
higher fraction (48.8) who placed
Stanford University in the top five.
But that ignores the truly outrageous
implication of the first figure. Apply
ing subtraction, one finds that 52.4
percent of these college presidents
evidently think Harvard doesn't rank
in the top five undergraduate col
leges.
College presidents say many silly
things. Who are these people? Why
should we care what they say? Let's
face it: Most college presidents are
losers. Our own Derek Bok may be
president of the college, Roscoe
Pound professor of law, curator of
the Peabody Museum, head of the
oldest self-perpetuating corporation
in the Western World and a pub-

If college presidents
believe Harvard's not
up there, what else
don't they believe? Is
not Pope John Paul II
one of the five leading
Catholics? Is not the
Pacific Ocean one of
the five largest bodies of
water on the West
Coast? Is not the moon
one of the five largest
celestial bodies orbiting
our planet? We think so.

lished author. But what does the
president of say, Florida State Uni
versity, do? To quote a customer at
Emack and Bolio's yesterday be
tween 3 and 4 p.m., "I don't know."
Do these people think they're
funny? This is no joking matter. If
they wanted to tell jokes, they
should have hooked up with Rod
ney Dangerfield and put on a show
at the Park Street T-station. jokes
belong in the Johnny Carson Show,
the Vale Daily News or the Demo
cratic Party platform. They don't
belong on the cover of national
news magazines. So there.
Asking whether Harvard belongs
in the top five is like asking whether
the United States is one of the top
five nuclear superpowers. Snide,
you say? Maybe. Arrogant? Prob
ably. But it's the veritus nonethe
less. Harvard may not be the best of
all possible collegiate worlds,
though that's a distinct possibility,
but who are our real world
"competitors"?
Stanford? Certainly some college
presidents prefer that tennis club by

the Pacific. You know the place:
You've seen one Coppertone com
mercial, you've seen Stanford.
Some people get mugged traversing
the Cambridge Common. But at
least no one in the Yard dies a
violent death from runaway frisbees
or errant golf balls. Stanford stu
dents like to say Palo Alto is more
laid back, but there's a medical term
for that: coma. We have crew races
on the Charles River. Stanfordites
sail on a man-made cesspool chris
tened "Lake Lagunita." For non-
Romance language aficionados that
translates as "Lake Lake."
What other schools were named
frequently in the survey? Yale got
37.8 percent. But what can we say?
We said it all in the Yale Supple
ment. Page 2: "Yale hates Harvard.
Harvard doesn't care." So there.
Princeton — named by 28.0 percent
— is in New Jersey. Imagine an
entire campus quadded. Their
shuttle buses don't run to New York
City, let alone Harvard Square. How
do they get to the Science Center?
Why did 53 percent of college
presidents still not name Harvard in
the top five? If it was a joke, we, like
Queen Victoria, are not amused.
But college presidents aren't funny
— not intentionally. We must
assume they meant it. This is terrify
ing. If college presidents believe
Harvard's not there, what else
don't they believe? Is not John Paul
II one oi the five leading Catholics?
Is not the Pacific Ocean one of the
five largest bodies of water on the
West Coast? Is not the moon one of
the five largest celestial bodies or
biting our planet? We think so. But
52.4 percent of college presidents
probably don't.
Maybe they're just jealous. Of the
14,000 people who apply to Harvard
College each year, 12,000 don't get
in. Many become college presi
dents. After all, every college pro
fessor or academic deep down
inside wants to live in Massachusetts
Hall — but they don't. We can pity
them. We also pity the bums in Har
vard Square, but we don't make
them college presidents. Evidently
52.4 percent of American univer
sities have.
Perhaps the college presidents
just didn't understand the question.
Illiteracy among college presidents
remains one of our hidden national
tragedies. If Johnny can't read, why
is he a college president? Perhaps
even reporters for U.S. News and
World Report should have had them
point at photographs of prominent
colleges instead. A more disturbing
thought: Just one day after this
newspaper publicized the survey
results, $1500 worth of rare jewelry
was stolen from the Harvard Semitic
Museum. That's too much of a coin
cidence for us.
So what do we do now? We could
make existing college presidents rip
their clothing and shout, "Unclean,
unclean," to warn innocent
bystanders. But that doesn't solve
the problem.
We need replacements for these
men (and women). How about the
astrologer at Harvard Square? For
two bucks, he'll tell your fortune.
For four, he'd probably run Ap
palachian State College. What about
the penguin in Bloom County? Is he
a college president? Why not? He's
dressed for it.

ably. But it's the veritus nonethe
less. Harvard may not be the best of
all possible collegiate worlds,
though that's a distinct possibility,
but who are our real world
"competitors"?
Stanford? Certainly some college
presidents prefer that tennis club by

the Pacific. You know the place:
You've seen one Coppertone com
mercial, you've seen Stanford.
Some people get mugged traversing
the Cambridge Common. But at
least no one in the Yard dies a
violent death from runaway frisbees
or errant golf balls. Stanford stu
dents like to say Palo Alto is more
laid back, but there's a medical term
for that: coma. We have crew races
on the Charles River. Stanfordites
sail on a man-made cesspool chris
tened "Lake Lagunita." For non-
Romance language aficionados that
translates as "Lake Lake."
What other schools were named
frequently in the survey? Yale got
37.8 percent. But what can we say?
We said it all in the Yale Supple
ment. Page 2: "Yale hates Harvard.
Harvard doesn't care." So there.
Princeton — named by 28.0 percent
— is in New Jersey. Imagine an
entire campus quadded. Their
shuttle buses don't run to New York
City, let alone Harvard Square. How
do they get to the Science Center?
Why did 53 percent of college
presidents still not name Harvard in
the top five? If it was a joke, we, like
Queen Victoria, are not amused.
But college presidents aren't funny
— not intentionally. We must
assume they meant it. This is terrify
ing. If college presidents believe
Harvard's not there, what else
don't they believe? Is not John Paul
II one oi the five leading Catholics?
Is not the Pacific Ocean one of the
five largest bodies of water on the
West Coast? Is not the moon one of
the five largest celestial bodies or
biting our planet? We think so. But
52.4 percent of college presidents
probably don't.
Maybe they're just jealous. Of the
14,000 people who apply to Harvard
College each year, 12,000 don't get
in. Many become college presi
dents. After all, every college pro
fessor or academic deep down
inside wants to live in Massachusetts
Hall — but they don't. We can pity
them. We also pity the bums in Har
vard Square, but we don't make
them college presidents. Evidently
52.4 percent of American univer
sities have.
Perhaps the college presidents
just didn't understand the question.
Illiteracy among college presidents
remains one of our hidden national
tragedies. If Johnny can't read, why
is he a college president? Perhaps
even reporters for U.S. News and
World Report should have had them
point at photographs of prominent
colleges instead. A more disturbing
thought: Just one day after this
newspaper publicized the survey
results, $1500 worth of rare jewelry
was stolen from the Harvard Semitic
Museum. That's too much of a coin
cidence for us.
So what do we do now? We could
make existing college presidents rip
their clothing and shout, "Unclean,
unclean," to warn innocent
bystanders. But that doesn't solve
the problem.
We need replacements for these
men (and women). How about the
astrologer at Harvard Square? For
two bucks, he'll tell your fortune.
For four, he'd probably run Ap
palachian State College. What about
the penguin in Bloom County? Is he
a college president? Why not? He's
dressed for it.

News item: 47.6 percent of the
college presidents surveyed by U.S.
News and World Report named Har
vard as one of the five best places for
undergraduate education. Many
commentators played up the slightly
higher fraction (48.8) who placed
Stanford University in the top five.
But that ignores the truly outrageous
implication of the first figure. Apply
ing subtraction, one finds that 52.4
percent of these college presidents
evidently think Harvard doesn't rank
in the top five undergraduate col
leges.
College presidents say many silly
things. Who are these people? Why
should we care what they say? Let's
