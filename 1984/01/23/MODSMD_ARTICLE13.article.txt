# Treading on thin ice
## 
### 
At Stanford, and indeed, in the
United States as a whole, it seems
that when you walk toward the left
bank of the political Main Stream,
you tread on thin ice. You must test
your footing every few feet. Plenty
of people are rooting for you to fall
in. And since the ice is covered by a
deep snowfall of fear, propaganda
and ignorance, it is hard to tell just
how thick that ice really is. Yet, if
you sense that the truth lies in that
direction, you go anyway. With this
in mind, let me venture to critique
capitalism as it currently exists in the
United States — good things first.
The price system works. Provided
there is sufficient competition,
supply and demand will work them
selves out to achieve the proper
price for a good.
Another point in capitalism's fa
vor is the role it provides for
entrepreneurs. Although they are
less and less commonly the bold,
adventurous knights of capitalism
that we read about in economics
textbooks, they do exist, and the
role they play in developing new
products — ev *n new technologies
— is important.
Finally, capitalism does offer
people choices — about what they
wear, about what car they drive,
about which stocks they own.
Capitalism fails, however, on
several counts, most of which have
to do with equity, opportunity and
the dignity of life.
For instance, work under
capitalism has become, for most
people, a daily exercise in aliena
tion. Inspired by the ideas of Freder
ick Taylor, U.S. businessmen have
divided up and rationalized the

work process to the point where
most jobs are excruciatingly boring
and repetitive, offering the worker
no say in how his work is to be
carried out. This the capitalists have
done in the name of greater effi
ciency and profits.
And where do these profits come
from? The answer is painfully ob
vious: from labor. That this is true is
substantiated by the everyday deci
sions of businessmen. For instance,
when a company shuts down a fac
tory in the United States and opens
one in Indonesia, it is not because
the factory is any cheaper to build
there, or because it is cheaper to
ship the machinery there; it is be
cause labor costs are lower. Given a
relatively stable market price for the
finished good, lower labor costs im
ply greater profits.
Then there is the matter of the dis
tribution of the profit. Some is rein
vested in the company. The rest
goes to the owners of corporate
stock, or as Marx would have called
them, the capitalist class. I hesitate
to use such terminology because it
conjures up images of portly old
gentlemen in fur coats and top hats,
a la Leland Stanford.
And as Time magazine recently
pointed out, American workers
themselves are in some sense
capitalists: They own, via the pen
sion funds, at least 30 percent of
U.S. corporate stock. Nonetheless,
the fact remains that there is a class
of real capitalists in this country. In
1972 the richest 1 percent of the U.S.
population owned 57percent of cor
porate stock. They owned 15 per
cent of real estate, 60 percent of
bonds, 90 percent of trusts. Et

cetera Obviously, then, wealth, and
the income that is derived from
ownin 5 it, is not distributed on a
very equitable basis in this country.
But, as if owning half the produc
tive capital weren't enough, the very
rich benefit from a further advan
tage: the capital gains tax. Fearful
that too much taxation would dis
courage investment, the U.S. gov
ernment taxes only 40 percent of
capital gains. Thus, if a wealthy per
son earns $100,000 on th<> sale of his
stock, the government taxes him
only on the first $40,000. The other
$60,000 is his to keep, tax-free. The
dishwasher in Wilbur, however, has
every penny of his income taxed, al
beit at a lower rate.
Let me finish by making what may
seem to some a paradoxical state
ment, given all I have just said: I am
a patriot. The United States has
done better for more people than
any other country in history. And
the principles on which this country
was founded are still some of the
most laudable of which I know. But I
would like to see an America where
these ideals are realized for every
one, not just the fortunate few at the
top of the capitalist pyramid.
Socialism might not solve all of
America's problems, and it would
undoubtedly create some of its
own, but as a step toward improving
the lot of the vast majority of
people, it would be a new and pow
erful river to compete with the Main
Stream, and maybe even replace it.
And you can bet that in the winter
time, its ice would be thick and
clear.
