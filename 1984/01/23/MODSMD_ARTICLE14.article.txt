## All eyes on Jesse Jackson 
### 
As the election year begins, candidates are shifting
into gear for the political races. And while it is still hard
to see who will lead the pack, the characteristics of the
campaigns are beginning to be seen. One perception is
becoming clearer: Jesse Jackson is the man to watch.
Jackson scored a major coup by freeing Lt. Goodman
from Syria. The political analysts and commentators are
still debating the number of votes Jackson has gained,
and many are trying to belittle the political impact of
the Syrian impact. But one thing is certain — it has
given Jackson what he needed most: legitimacy.
Now when Jackson speaks people listen more close
ly. The media starts to print his positions and ideas,
rather than superfluous campaign details. And the
more Jackson speaks, the more poignant his words
become, the more his clear vision of common sense
challenges the monolithic "conventional wisdom."
Jackson is defining issues that the other candidates will
have to address. And the reason is that he is not speak
ing to the political professionals: the officials, the ad
ministrators and lobbyists; Jackson is talking to the
people.
While this may seem a rhetorical point, the potential
for the Jackson approach is awesome. Reagan brought
the message that the governmental machinery has

overlooked the "common people" long enough. The
surprisingly strong Reagan victory of 1980, when politi
cal commentators and pollsters had declared a close
race, reaffirmed that America is governed by the
people, not the political elite.
The Democratic/Republican hierarchy is watching
Jackson closely, you can be sure. Is it possible for the
Democrats to nominate for president a man whom 30
years ago would not have been able to use their toilets?
Surely the party leadership would rather address the
issue of race in 1988, not 1984.
If Jackson does not receive the nomination, he will
surely run as an independent. This will force a major
split in the Democratic Party, and it is plausible many
Republicans will be attracted to Jackson also. If no can
didate was to gain a majority of delegates in the general
election, there could be lasting repercussions for the
two-party structure.
In 1980, Anderson was the man to watch. He had the
flair, the sharp common sense. He galvanized a sector
of the electorate, albeit a small one, and caused con
sternation for the two-party regime.
This year, keep your eyes on Jesse Jackson.
