# Professor's Commentary: Robert Sinclair
## Passion for soccer influences foreign policy U.S. isolationist stance may prevent worldwide holocaust 
### 
Robert Sinclair came to Stan
ford in 1977 and is now associ
ate professor of materials sci
ence and engineering. He was
born and brought up in Liver
pool which some regard as the
epicenter of English soccer.
He is a fanatical soccer fan.
It is not well-known,
hereabouts, that soccer can
have a profound influence on
international affairs. Before
embarking on the implications
of this statement, I feel I
should elaborate on how I
conjured up this point of view.
Association football (to dis
tinguish it from rugby football,
and latterly American football)
originated in England in the
mid-19th century. In fact, the
Brits were rather prolific
during this period of inventing
games to play. Unlike other
sports, which were designed
to occupy the considerable
leisure time of the upper,
ruling class, soccer was quick
ly adopted by those in the
working class.
Benefits of the Industrial
Revolution were gradually
percolating down the strata of
British society, such that the
urban male population found
itself with a small, but percep
tible, amount of energy
remaining at the end of a 72-
hour work week. When one
realizes how much the spirits
can be revived by the pursuit
of an elusive round ball, with
the concomitant release of ag
gression by kicking one's op
ponents on appropriate occa
sions, the popularity of soccer
amongst the working people
is not surprising.
Organized teams, leagues
and competitions sprang up, it
seems now in "the twinkling
of an eye." The strongest still
survive today. Names like
Wolverhampton Wanderers,
Blackburn Rovers, Plymouth
Argyle, West Bromwich Albion
and Tottenham Hotspurs
evoke a nostalgic response as
sociated with the
"quaintners" of English life.
However, soccer's
preeminent position arose not
so much from one's actual
participation, but from its
power as a spectator sport. I
could wax on at inordinate
length on the beauty of the
patterns woven by the players
during the course of a game,
the fluidity of the action, eb
bing and flowing as waves on a
beach, the climax which can
hardly be surpassed as the ball
is held by the net, suspended
in space and time, when a
score is made, but it will
suffice merely to say that soc
cer is a truly elegant experi
ence.
When this power is coupled

with the deep loyalty of the
British working class and the
frustrations generated by their
upbringing, societal hierarchy
and reserved nature, one has a
force to be reckoned with. It
was not unusual, at the peak
of popularity, for the more es
tablished teams to attract a
regular clientele of 50,000.
This is really an amazing figure
when one considers the large
number of teams, their close
proximity to one another,
(there are often two major
teams in a city of less than one
million, and the adjacent
major city may be less than
50 miles away), the fre
quency of the games
(approximately 50 per season),
the English weather in winter
and the truly spartan nature of
the stadia that even Dickens
would find difficult to
describe. As to this latter
point, I am tempted to recall
the most common method of
physical relief, with the aid of
a rolled newspaper, when one
was captured like a sardine in
the bowels of the crowd, but I
will leave that to another occa
sion.
The outcome of this situa
tion was the intense partisan
ship of the people for the
"home" team. In fact, true
hatred existed for the oppo
nents and their supporters.
The cotton towns, with their
"dark satanic mills," hated the
big industrial cities. The
"South" hated the "North"

(which began, or ended,
depending on your direction
of travel , at Watford, a sleazy
town outside London, famous
only for a modern popular
singer). Everyone just plain
disliked the midlands, includ
ing, one suspects, those who
lived there!
Rivalry can be healthy when
it is channeled in a positive
way (we secretly like the Cal
Weenies, don't we?).
However, it can be manip
ulated to divert the attentions
of the populace from its more
fundamental problems. And
when it becomes consuming
to the extent of a passion, it
can provide a divisive wedge
to disrupt the fabric of society.
One can notice evidence of
these aspects in contemporary
Britain. Soccer provides an ex
pression of the character of
the working class. Its
popularity allows the escape
from a financially miserable
life for the few talented
sportsmen. But the distrust of
North for South is more con
tinually exposed through soc
cer than are the class divisions
which pervade everyday En
glish life. Partisanship has
evolved into weekly violent
confrontations between sup
porters of opposing teams,
such that what was once re
garded as a peaceful, gentle
notion now shows alarming
precursors to an eruption. The
rioting (rioting in England?) in

Brixton, Toxteth and
Manchester in 1981 was
quenched by a brilliant ma
neuver on the part of the
British Royal Family: the mar
riage of Prince Charles. Na
tional harmony was restored,
but perhaps only temporarily.
Soccer on an international
level grew since the last war
(for those of my vintage, this is
understood to mean World
War II). A most shocking event
occurred in 1953: The English
national team was ig
nominiously beaten 6-3 for the
first time at home, by, of all
nations, Hungary. The effects
of this defeat were as deep
and as galvanizing as were
those of the first Russian Sput
nik on the American space
program. England's attitude to
international soccer, previ
ously one of disdain, was
transformed. England went
on, in 1966, to win the single
most popular competition on
the planet, the World Cup. At
that time, the national spirit
was similar to that during
World War II and at Prince
Charles' wedding.

But now it was led by the
working class. The resounding
success of the Labour Party in
the 1%6 general election and
its equally resounding defeat
in 1970 do not seem to be
merely coincidental with En
gland's soccer success in 1966
and its subsequent demise four
years later. The Falklands war
with Argentina can be partly
blamed on a reference to the
Argentinian soccer team as
"animals" following a particu
larly gruesome game during
the 1966 World Cup (I still
wince at some of the fouls
committed by both teams
during that match). Animosity
between Britain and its
European Community col
leagues sometimes seems at
its highest level since the
Hundred Years War as a con
sequence of the invasions by
British soccer fans.
Now, were Britain an in
fluential nation, rather than
one approaching Third-World
status, these events might
have had more impressive in
ternational repercussions. The
passions of other nations

toward their soccer heroes
can be interpreted in a parallel
manner. Clearly it seems that
we have a situation whereby
catastrophe is at hand, due to
the propagation of soccer
throughout the world.
Fortunately there is one re
assurance I can draw from our
plight. The United States will
never become so passionately
involved in this sport. Despite
predictions of U.S. soccer
supremacy by say, the year
2000, it will just not occur. To
develop the necessary skills,
ghetto kids have to learn the
game from the time they walk,
using old tennis balls and
derelict cans, perfecting their
accuracy by kicking stones
through the neighbor's win
dow and practising fouling
tactics by tripping up innocent
passers-by. Too much empha
sis is placed here, at an early
age, on the delightful Ameri
can version of football and on
other interesting pastimes.
The U.S. isolationist stance
with regards to the pervasive
ness of soccer will therefore
prevent the incident which
might bring about the
holocaust we all dread. Let us
be thankful for small mercies.
But if the Martians arrive
bouncing a soccer ball, watch
out!
