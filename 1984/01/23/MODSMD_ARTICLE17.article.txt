### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
The Stanford men's swim team extended its dual-meet record
to 4-0 with a 74-39 victory over conference rival Arizona State
Saturday.
As the No. 1 ranked swim team in the nation, Stanford was ex
pected to win, but there were a few unexpected surprises
throughout the day.
Before the second event of the meet — the 1000 freestyle —
Cardinal John Kostoff was heavily favored to place first,
Arizona State's Scot Brackett was favored to place second and
Stanford's Dave Sims was to place third.
But Sims managed to beat the odds by coming in second be
hind Kostoff, edging Brackett in the final seconds. This upset
gave Stanford the first two places and "set the trend for the rest
of the meet," Cardinal Coach Skip Kenney said.
Following in the same trend, freshman Dave lauden beat
three of Arizona State's swimmers in the top 10 with a time of
1: 39.19 in the 200 freestyle.
As usual, Kostoff had an excellent day with winning times of
9:06 and 4:27.34 in the 1000 and 500 respectively. These times
also qualify him for the NCAA conference final. He's such a
great athlete that he always makes his (qualifying) times," Ken
ney said.
Besides standouts like Kostoff, many other individuals are
beginning to show signs of stardom

Most notably, freshman Pablo Morales had his best meet this
season by winning the 200 individual medley in 1:52.1 and
finishing just as well in the 200 butterfly .at 1:49.0h. Both times
were season highs for Morales.
Dave Bottom also had season high marks with his times of
2 i.20 in the 50 freestyle and 46.37 in the 100 freestyle.
In all, Stanford captured 11 of 13 events against an Arizona
State team ranked No. 7 in the nation.
"These guys are training extremely well and are tired up tor
this season and the NCAA conference final," Kenney said ac
counting tor his team's easy victory.
On Friday, Stanford beat UC-Santa Barbara by the same score
of 74-39. Santa Barbara is a four-time PCAA champion, yet Ken
ney knew Stanford would dominate. With this in mind, the
coach mixed up the lineup in order to put his swimmers in their
weaker events.
Our team is so strong and versatile, I wanted them to per
form in their weaker strokes so they would improve tor the
medley,' Kenney said. "These meets also help the team to im
prove for the NCAA finals."
Next weekend, eight members of the swim team will compete
in the Dallas Morning News Swim Classic which features the top
six teams in the country. Stanford is the favorite followed by
Florida, Texas and Southern Methodist University.
