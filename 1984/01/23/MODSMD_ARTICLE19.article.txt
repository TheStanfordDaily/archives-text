Corvallis, Ore. — The Stanford basket
ball team no longer has company in
misery.
Previously winless Arizona defeated
Arizona St. Friday night and suddenly
Stanford became the Pacific-10 Confer
ence's only team still with a goose egg in
the league-play win column.
And now Stanford looks for conference
win number one tonight at 7:30 against
the Oregon State Beavers in Gill
Coliseum — no easy task.
The fact that the Cardinal is 0-5 in the
Pac-10 is one thing. But having to go for
its fifth conference victory on the
Beavers' side of the dam is quite another.
Oregon State is 49-5 since the start of
the 1979-80 season in the 10,000-seat Gill
Coliseum, which has been sold-out for 61
straight regular-season games, including
tonight's.
The Beavers have been even more
dominant over the Cardinal in recent
years. Coach Ralph Miller's teams have
won eight of its last nine games with Stan
ford and the last eight straight at Gill.
Oregon State's No. 11 rating in the As
sociated Press' weekly poll is deceiving.
In fact, when the new rankings come out
early this week, the Beavers probably
won't be in the top 20.
Why? Oregon State did something in its
last two games that has chain-smoking
Miller in an uprage. It lost both of them —
Thursday at Washington State, 74-65, and
Saturday at league-leading Washington,

72-58.
But the Beavers' two-game losing
streak can't be thought of as working in
Stanford's favor. For starters, Oregon
State is returning home to the com
fortable confines of Gill. And Ralph
Miller-coached teams simply don't lose
three straight.
The disasters — at least by Oregon
State's standards — left Miller and his
team with a 9-4 overall record and a 2-2
Pac-10 mark, good for a fourth-place tie
With USC.
Right now, Davis and company would
give anything to have even one confer
ence win. They have lost their five Pac-10
games by a total of 15 points and making
matters worse, four of those five were
games they could have won minus some
costly turnovers in the late going.
"We've got an awful lot of learning to
do," Davis said after Thursday's 51-49
overtime loss at USC. "But we're better
than we were a year ago.
"Yet, we're having trouble winning in
the league. That's not because of the
quality of our play, but because of the im
provement of the other teams."
The best part about playing Oregon
State tonight for Stanford is that it won't
have to face the Beavers again this
season. The two teams met in their con
ference opener Jan. 5 at Maples Pavilion,
a game Oregon State won, 64-59.
Forward A.C. Green led the Beavers
with a game-high 11 rebounds and 22

points, shooting a perfect 8 'or-H from the
floor and 6-for-6 from the free throw line.
Green, forward Charlie Sitton, center
Steve Woodside and guards Alan Tait and
Darrin Houston started that game and
Oregon State's following contests.
However, after two straight road losses to
the Washington schools, Miller may very
well make some changes.
Davis, meanwhile, will probably go
with John Paye and Keith )ones at guard,
Earl Koberlein and Steve Brown at for
ward and John Revelli at center. Brown is
the only new starter from the USC game,
as he was bothered by a sprained finger
on his shooting hand and was riot in the
first five.
Freshman Paye, Stanford's starting
quarterback on the football team, made
his debut as a basketball starter against
USC, tallying four points and three assists
in 29 minutes. According to Stanford's
Sports Information Department, he is the
first person in NCAA Division I history to
start both a football and a basketball
game as a freshman.
Revelli, who leads Stanford with a 17.8
points per game average in Pac-10 play,
was the nation's second-best field goal
percentage shooter last week at .697, only
.002 behind leader Bernard Thompson of
Fresno State. However, in his 4-of-5 per
formance against USC, Revelli improved
to .701 and should be on top this week
when the NCAA statistics are released
Wednesday.

teams have proved to he much more difficult than the Divi

to win a conference game. Cardinal forward Hons Wichary
