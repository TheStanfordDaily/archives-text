# Raiders destroy Skins by widest margin in Super Bowl history
## 
### 
Tampa, Fla. (AP) — Marcus Allen rushed
for a record 191 yards, including a 74-yard
touchdown run, and the Los Angeles
defense shut down Washington's John Rig
gins and Joe Theismann as the Raiders
crushed the defending champion Redskins
38-9 Sunday in the most lopsided Super
Bowl ever.
Understudies Derrick Jensen and Jack
Squirek turned alert defensive plays into in
stant first-half touchdowns before Allen, a
unanimous selection as the game's Most
Valuable Player, broke loose in the second
half and paced the Raiders to a Super Bowl
record 38 points.
Allen picked up his yardage on 20 carries
and broke the record of 166 rushing yards
set by Riggins in last year's 27-17 Washing
ton victory over the Miami Dolphins.
Jensen, a reserve tight end and L.A.'s spe
cial teams captain, blocked Jeff Hayes' punt
and fell on it in the end zone for a touch
down 4:52 into the game. Squirek, a backup
linebacker, intercepted Theismann's screen
pass and burst 5 yards for a score just seven
seconds before halftime.
Between those scores, Jim Plunkett
passed 12 yards to Cliff Branch for a second
period touchdown and Allen applied the
coup de grace in the third quarter with two
touchdowns — running 5 and a Super Bowl
record 74 yards to put the Raiders safely in
command for their third Super Bowl tri
umph.
The Redskins had been three-point
favorites to win their second successive
Super Bowl — but by holding Riggins to 64
yards and Washington's only touchdown on
a 1-yard dive in the third period, the Raiders
became the only team besides the Pitts
burgh Steelers to win more than two. The
Steelers won four times in the 19705.
Three plays served to propel the Raiders
to this victory over a team which, at 14-2,
was the best in the National Football League
during the regular season — Squirek's inter
ception, Allen's big run and, between them,

a defensive stand that stopped Riggins on
fourth-and-one at the L.A. 26 late in the third
quarter. If that wasn't enough, the defense
also blocked a Washington extra-point at
tempt and forced a Theismann fumble that
ended a Redskins threat in the fourth per
iod.
The Redskins never were really in the
game. Riggins' run typified the Redskins'
frustration on this day.
With the Raiders holding a 14-3 lead, Ray
Guy's 27-yard punt buried the Redskins at
the 12-yard line with 12 seconds remaining
in the first half. Theismann brought his team
to the line with three receivers split wide to
the right, apparently ready for a bomb.
Instead, he only looked to his right, then
turned to his left, where )oe Washington
was a step outside defensive end Lyle Al
zado.
Theismann lofted the ball toward his all
purpose back but Squirek, sweeping to his
right, stepped between them, grabbed the
ball and was in the end zone in a flash.
The Raiders' bench erupted, Coach Tom
Flores grinning widely while his players
danced around. On the other sideline,
Coach Joe Gibbs muttered what for him
must have been an expletive at what had
become a 21-3 halttime deficit.
Riggins and Allen traded touchdowns in
the third period and the Redskins, now
down 28-9, were driving, hoping to close the
gap. Less than a minute remained when the
momentum turned.
A year ago, on a fourth-and-one against
Miami, Riggins broke loose on a sweep to
the left for 43 yards and the decisive touch
down. Yesterday, with Washington facing
fourth-and-one at the L.A. 26, the Raiders
were waiting for him. Linebacker Rod Martin
pursued the sweep to the left and stacked
up Riggins for no gain.
On the very next play, with 12 seconds
remaining in the period, the Raiders ended
any chance the Redskins had.
On first down, rl'nkett
lianded otf to A'len, who
began sweeping to his left,
only to find strong safety Ken
Coffey in his way. Allen
reversed his field, cutting back
to the right, then suddenly cut
upfield through a mammoth
hole in the middle of the line
and was gone on his 74-yard
scoring run, 16 yards longer
than the record Baltimore's
Tom Matte had held since
Super Bowl 111 in 1969.
It was now 35-9 and the
Raiders only needed Chris
Bahr's 21-yard field goal with
2:24 remaining to shatter the
record of 35 points s< red by
Green Bay in the first of these
18 Super Bowls and the
Steelers in Super Bowi XIII.
Theismann, the Most
Valuable Player during the
season, spent much of this
game running for his life as his
offensive line — the famed
Hogs — was unable to contain
the Raider rush and the L.A.
secondary took away his pri
mary receivers. He was sacked
six limes, intercepted twice
md completed only 16 of 35
passes for 243 vards.

for a record 191 yards, including a 74-yard
touchdown run, and the Los Angeles
defense shut down Washington's John Rig
gins and Joe Theismann as the Raiders
crushed the defending champion Redskins
38-9 Sunday in the most lopsided Super
Bowl ever.
Understudies Derrick Jensen and Jack
Squirek turned alert defensive plays into in
stant first-half touchdowns before Allen, a
unanimous selection as the game's Most
Valuable Player, broke loose in the second
half and paced the Raiders to a Super Bowl
record 38 points.
Allen picked up his yardage on 20 carries
and broke the record of 166 rushing yards
set by Riggins in last year's 27-17 Washing
ton victory over the Miami Dolphins.
Jensen, a reserve tight end and L.A.'s spe
cial teams captain, blocked Jeff Hayes' punt
and fell on it in the end zone for a touch
down 4:52 into the game. Squirek, a backup
linebacker, intercepted Theismann's screen
pass and burst 5 yards for a score just seven
seconds before halftime.
Between those scores, Jim Plunkett
passed 12 yards to Cliff Branch for a second
period touchdown and Allen applied the
coup de grace in the third quarter with two
touchdowns — running 5 and a Super Bowl
record 74 yards to put the Raiders safely in
command for their third Super Bowl tri
umph.
The Redskins had been three-point
favorites to win their second successive
Super Bowl — but by holding Riggins to 64
yards and Washington's only touchdown on
a 1-yard dive in the third period, the Raiders
became the only team besides the Pitts
burgh Steelers to win more than two. The
Steelers won four times in the 19705.
Three plays served to propel the Raiders
to this victory over a team which, at 14-2,
was the best in the National Football League
during the regular season — Squirek's inter
ception, Allen's big run and, between them,

a defensive stand that stopped Riggins on
fourth-and-one at the L.A. 26 late in the third
quarter. If that wasn't enough, the defense
also blocked a Washington extra-point at
tempt and forced a Theismann fumble that
ended a Redskins threat in the fourth per
iod.
The Redskins never were really in the
game. Riggins' run typified the Redskins'
frustration on this day.
With the Raiders holding a 14-3 lead, Ray
Guy's 27-yard punt buried the Redskins at
the 12-yard line with 12 seconds remaining
in the first half. Theismann brought his team
to the line with three receivers split wide to
the right, apparently ready for a bomb.
Instead, he only looked to his right, then
turned to his left, where )oe Washington
was a step outside defensive end Lyle Al
zado.
Theismann lofted the ball toward his all
purpose back but Squirek, sweeping to his
right, stepped between them, grabbed the
ball and was in the end zone in a flash.
The Raiders' bench erupted, Coach Tom
Flores grinning widely while his players
danced around. On the other sideline,
Coach Joe Gibbs muttered what for him
must have been an expletive at what had
become a 21-3 halttime deficit.
Riggins and Allen traded touchdowns in
the third period and the Redskins, now
down 28-9, were driving, hoping to close the
gap. Less than a minute remained when the
momentum turned.
A year ago, on a fourth-and-one against
Miami, Riggins broke loose on a sweep to
the left for 43 yards and the decisive touch
down. Yesterday, with Washington facing
fourth-and-one at the L.A. 26, the Raiders
were waiting for him. Linebacker Rod Martin
pursued the sweep to the left and stacked
up Riggins for no gain.
On the very next play, with 12 seconds
remaining in the period, the Raiders ended
any chance the Redskins had.
On first down, rl'nkett
lianded otf to A'len, who
began sweeping to his left,
only to find strong safety Ken
Coffey in his way. Allen
reversed his field, cutting back
to the right, then suddenly cut
upfield through a mammoth
hole in the middle of the line
and was gone on his 74-yard
scoring run, 16 yards longer
than the record Baltimore's
Tom Matte had held since
Super Bowl 111 in 1969.
It was now 35-9 and the
Raiders only needed Chris
Bahr's 21-yard field goal with
2:24 remaining to shatter the
record of 35 points s< red by
Green Bay in the first of these
18 Super Bowls and the
Steelers in Super Bowi XIII.
Theismann, the Most
Valuable Player during the
season, spent much of this
game running for his life as his
offensive line — the famed
Hogs — was unable to contain
the Raider rush and the L.A.
secondary took away his pri
mary receivers. He was sacked
six limes, intercepted twice
md completed only 16 of 35
passes for 243 vards.
