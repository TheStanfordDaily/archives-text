# Card wins just one match
## Matmen lose to Bakersfield 
### 
In its worst defeat of the
season, the Stanford wrestling
team was trounced by Division
II powerhouse Cal-State
Bakersfield 48-3 Saturday. The
Cardinal dual-meet record fell
to 4-11 with the loss and a win
ning dual-meet season is now
out of the question.
"The team was psyched-out
by the level of competition
they had to face," Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel said. "In
the matches we had little
scoring, plus we were not
prepared. If we were 100 per
cent we would have been
competitive and maybe taken
four matches."
One of the finest Cardinal
wrestlers of the day was Scott
Wiggen, who is a potential
NCAA qualifier. Wiggen lost
19-5 to a Bakersfield wrestler
who in Horpel's opinion could
take the NCAA crown.
Stanford's only points came
on a victory by Kurt Kassulke.
In an extremely tough match,
Kassulke showed his future
potential in a 7-2 victory.
