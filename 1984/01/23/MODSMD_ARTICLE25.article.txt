## 
### JOHN LIS 
After defeating NAIA foe St.
Mary's College 75-55 Tues
day, the Stanford women's
basketball team returned to
action over the weekend with
games against two of the top
teams in the Western Col
legiate Athletic Conference,
UCLA and L sC.
The youthful Cardinal
played well in both contests,
but was soundly defeated by
the Bruins, 81-51, and the Wo
men of 82-56.
Stanford started off slowly
Friday against UCLA, falling
behind 31-11 early in the first
half. The Cardinal, however,
wasn't read\ to let the Bruins
run away with the game that
early.
Stanford roared right back
and over a six-minute stretch
outscored the Bruins 17-4,
closing the gap to <5-28 with
two minutes left in the half.
The small but extremely en
thusiastic crowd in Maples
Pavilion came to its feet as the
Cardinal played some of its
best basketball of the yeai On
defense, Stanford denied the
inside game to UCLA's two
top scorers senior forward
Marja Van Helvoort and fresh
man center Annette Keur,
while on offense, the Cardinal
began to take the ball to the
hoop with confidence.
The outburst was quickly
nullified, however, as the
Bruins ran off the last seven
points of the half to take a 42-
28 halttime lead. UCLA then
came out firing in the second
half, opening with eight un
answered points to make it 50-
28 and ending any hope for
Stanford.
The Bruins' advantage in
height and experience
showed in the second half as
they coasted to victory. UCLA
had its biggest lead of the
night at 79-44 with six minutes
remaining before Bruin Head
Coach Billie Moore cleared
her bench.
Sophomore center Sarah
Evans and sophomore guard
Virginia Sourlis paced the
Stanford attack. Evans finished
the night with 12 points
against the taller UCLA front
line, while Sourlis added 11.

lunior forward Mary
Bradach pulled down seven
rebounds for Stanford, but
she had a disappointing night
offensively, as she was held to
only three points.
Freshman guard Erica
Mueser played a solid game,
with seven assists and three
steals on the night.
UCLA had all five starters in
double figures. Keur finished
with 1b points and Van Hel
voort had 15 to lead the
Bruins. UCLA hit on 61 per
cent of its field goal attempts,
c ompared to only a 34 percent
success rate for Stanford.
At the Los Angeles Sports
Arena Saturday night, the Car
dinal played solidly against the
defending national champion
Trojans, leading early on, but
Stanford could not keep up
with the more talented USC
squad.
Stanford led, 18-16, eight
minutes into the contest,
but the No. 5 ranked Women
of Troy ended the half with a
20-5 stretch to take a 36-21 lead
into the locker room.
In the second half, USC
quickly opened up a 20-point
lead and rolled to victory
before a crowd of 2500.
Evans was the only Stanford
player to score in double fig
ures, finishing with 10 points
and seven rebounds. Mueser
and freshman forward Karen
Goodewaagen each scored
nine, while Sourlis had eight.
Bradach led the Card in
rebounds with eight.
USC senior forward Paula
McGee had 24 points and
eight rebounds to lead the
! rojans. Consensus All-
America forward Cheryl Miller
scored 16, and McGee's twin
sister, Pam, a senior center,
finished with 13.
Stanford held USC to only a
36 percent shooting effort in
the first half, but the Women
of Troy, behind Paula
McGee's 12-of-18 effort,
finished the night at 44 per
cent. Stanford shot 40 percent
on the night.
With the losses Stanford
falls to 3-14 overall, 0-4 in the
WCAA. The Cardinal is idle
this week until Saturday, when
USC will visit Maples for a
rematch.

teams in the Western Col
legiate Athletic Conference,
UCLA and L sC.
The youthful Cardinal
played well in both contests,
but was soundly defeated by
the Bruins, 81-51, and the Wo
men of 82-56.
Stanford started off slowly
Friday against UCLA, falling
behind 31-11 early in the first
half. The Cardinal, however,
wasn't read\ to let the Bruins
run away with the game that
early.
Stanford roared right back
and over a six-minute stretch
outscored the Bruins 17-4,
closing the gap to <5-28 with
two minutes left in the half.
The small but extremely en
thusiastic crowd in Maples
Pavilion came to its feet as the
Cardinal played some of its
best basketball of the yeai On
defense, Stanford denied the
inside game to UCLA's two
top scorers senior forward
Marja Van Helvoort and fresh
man center Annette Keur,
while on offense, the Cardinal
began to take the ball to the
hoop with confidence.
The outburst was quickly
nullified, however, as the
Bruins ran off the last seven
points of the half to take a 42-
28 halttime lead. UCLA then
came out firing in the second
half, opening with eight un
answered points to make it 50-
28 and ending any hope for
Stanford.
The Bruins' advantage in
height and experience
showed in the second half as
they coasted to victory. UCLA
had its biggest lead of the
night at 79-44 with six minutes
remaining before Bruin Head
Coach Billie Moore cleared
her bench.
Sophomore center Sarah
Evans and sophomore guard
Virginia Sourlis paced the
Stanford attack. Evans finished
the night with 12 points
against the taller UCLA front
line, while Sourlis added 11.

lunior forward Mary
Bradach pulled down seven
rebounds for Stanford, but
she had a disappointing night
offensively, as she was held to
only three points.
Freshman guard Erica
Mueser played a solid game,
with seven assists and three
steals on the night.
UCLA had all five starters in
double figures. Keur finished
with 1b points and Van Hel
voort had 15 to lead the
Bruins. UCLA hit on 61 per
cent of its field goal attempts,
c ompared to only a 34 percent
success rate for Stanford.
At the Los Angeles Sports
Arena Saturday night, the Car
dinal played solidly against the
defending national champion
Trojans, leading early on, but
Stanford could not keep up
with the more talented USC
squad.
Stanford led, 18-16, eight
minutes into the contest,
but the No. 5 ranked Women
of Troy ended the half with a
20-5 stretch to take a 36-21 lead
into the locker room.
In the second half, USC
quickly opened up a 20-point
lead and rolled to victory
before a crowd of 2500.
Evans was the only Stanford
player to score in double fig
ures, finishing with 10 points
and seven rebounds. Mueser
and freshman forward Karen
Goodewaagen each scored
nine, while Sourlis had eight.
Bradach led the Card in
rebounds with eight.
USC senior forward Paula
McGee had 24 points and
eight rebounds to lead the
! rojans. Consensus All-
America forward Cheryl Miller
scored 16, and McGee's twin
sister, Pam, a senior center,
finished with 13.
Stanford held USC to only a
36 percent shooting effort in
the first half, but the Women
of Troy, behind Paula
McGee's 12-of-18 effort,
finished the night at 44 per
cent. Stanford shot 40 percent
on the night.
With the losses Stanford
falls to 3-14 overall, 0-4 in the
WCAA. The Cardinal is idle
this week until Saturday, when
USC will visit Maples for a
rematch.
