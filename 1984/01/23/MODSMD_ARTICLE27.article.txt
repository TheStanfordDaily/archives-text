Tampa, Fla. (AP) — To a
man, members of the Los
Angeles Raiders' defense
were confident they would
shut down the powerful of
fense of the defending
champion Washington
Redskins in Super Bowl
XVIII.
And that's exactly what
happened.
"They tried everything,"
said defensive end Howie
Long after the Raiders over
whelmed the Redskins 38-9
yesterday. "Nothing
worked. We felt the game
was going to be won by our
front seven and thought we
handled 'The Hogs' very
well."
While Long and his
cohorts in the Los Angeles
3-4 defense controlled
Washington's vaunted of
fensive line, nicknamed
"The Hogs," pressured
quarterback Joe Theismann
and stymied fullback John
Riggins, the Raiders' sec
ondary was at least as good,
if not better.
Wide receivers Charlie
Brown and Art Monk of the
Redskins caught 14 passes
between them in Washing
ton's 37-35 triumph over
the Raiders on Oct. 2. Yes

terday, they combined for
just four receptions.
"They got those against
zone coverage, so that
doesn't matter/' said L.A.
cornerback Lester Hayes,
who spent much of the
game on Monk. "In man
to-man coverage, the focal
point was to make it a dog
fight in the first five yards,
hit them, bump them,
scratch them."
The most effective Wash
ington receiver was tight
end Clint Didier, who
caught five passes for 65
yards. He was matched up
most of the time on Los An
geles strong saftey Mike
Davis.
"What can you say,
you've got two of the best
at corner, how can you at
tack them?" Davis said, re
ferring to Hayes and Mike
Haynes.
The other member of the
Los Angeles secondary,
free safety Vann McElroy,
couldn't seem to believe
what had happened.
"My second year, we
won the Super Bowl, I'm
going to the Pro Bowl, I
couldn't ask for anymore,"
he said.
Linebacker Ted

Hendricks, a 15-year vet
eran playing in his 216 th
straight game, said he
thought the domination
was the second by his team
against the Redskins.
"What happened in the
first game is we had too
many turnovers," he said.
"We didn't make those
kind of mistakes today. We
have talent, we have coach
ing. Both of those jelled to
gether today."
The Raiders went ahead
to stay when Derrick Jen
sen blocked a punt by Jeff
Hayes and recovered it in
the Washington end zone
for a touchdown less than
five minutes into the game.
Another seldom-used
Raider, linebacker Jack
Squirek, gave his team a 21-
3 halftime lead by returning
an interception 5 yards for a
touchdown with seven
seconds before the inter
mission.
"It felt like a dream,"
Squirek said. "It dawned
on me when everyone
started hitting me in the
end zone. I just stepped in
front of Joe Washington
and he (Theismann) threw
it right to me."
