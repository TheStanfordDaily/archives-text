# Riggins not the same

Tampa, Fla. — It's been worse for the
Redskins, 112 course — 73-0 awful — back
when I tional Football League champi
onship imply that and not the Super
Bowl. They also lost a world title on a quar
terbacking quirk, when a Sammy Baugh pass
hit the goalpost in his own end zone and
cost them j two-point safety during a game
Clevelana won by one.
But this disaster might well have been the
most eerily ironic any franchise has
endured.
A year and eight days ago, Joe Theis
mann's instant instincts under pressure
made victory over the Dolphins possible;
yesterday, a teeny-tiny connection in his
brain surely snapped when he threw the
pass that made defeat to the Raiders
probable.
Also, go back a year and eight days and
recall the most memorable play of Super
Bowl XVII, the glorious "70 Chip" on fourth
down that John Riggins broke for the win
ning touchdown; Washington tried what
seemed the same play near the end of the
third quarter this ill-fated early evening and
Riggins got stuffed.
Fourth-and-a-foot again. Twelve seconds
left in the third quarter.

Last hope. Clint Didier cruised in motion
to the left, as he had in arguably the greatest
play in Redskin history. Dolphin Don
McNeal slipped just enough so that when
Riggins met him hip-to-hands a few yards
upfield there was almost no chance for a
game-saving tackle.
This time it was Riggins who had no
chance. A Raider usually anonymous except
in the Super Bowl, linebacker Rod Martin,
refused to be hooked inside by Rick Walker.
He was joined immediately by a pal, strong
safety Mike Davis. Needing maybe 12
inches, Riggins got maybe two.
A year and eight days ago, Riggins had run
43 yards into the end zone and come out the
game's most valuable player; he might not
have been looking when Marcus Allen
grabbed the ball immediately after "70
Chip" fizzled and assured MVP honors for
himself
And that the team with the best regular
season would suffer the worst Super Bowl
loss.
So much that almost always goes right for
the Redskins went goofy. Special teams that
almost never err, except in the Super Bowl,
blew a beaut.
