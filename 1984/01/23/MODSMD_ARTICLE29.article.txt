# Volleyball team kills St. Mary's

The Germans used to call it
blitzkrieg: a sudden, lighten
ing swift attack that was over
before the enemy knew what
hit them. Saturday night, the
Stanford men's volleyball
team adopted its own version
of this ancient concept.
In what may have been the
shortest volleyball match in
the history of Maples Pavilion,
the Cardinal crushed St.
Mary's 15-1, 15-3, 15-2 in just
37 minutes.
This is St. Mary's first year in
varsity volleyball competition
and after Saturday's crushing
defeat they may have been
wondering whether the switch
from club sports status was
worth it. The loss dropped St.
Mary's record to 0-2 while the
Cardinal got its first win of the
year in as many tries.
Stanford's hitting
percentage in the match was
an excellent .367 while St.
Mary's hit just -.196. (Hitting
percentage is calculated by
subtracting the number of er
rors from the number of
spikes and then dividing by
the total number of attacks.
Normally .200 is considered
around average while any
thing over .300 is very good.)
Freshman Karl Kolderup led
the Stanford attack with five
kills and was followed by
freshmen John McDermott
and Brett Monello with four
kills each. Pre-season second
team All-America middle
blocker John Root had four
kills in the match.
Stanford was ranked No. 5
nationally in the Volleyball
News Coaches Pre-Season
Poll, and Head Coach Fred
Sturm is optimistic about the
Cardinal season.
"I really feel good about the
team's chances in 1984," he
said. "An important key is to
get off to a good start. It seems
like in past years we have lost
the crucial fifth game, and it
has seemed to carry over the
rest of the year. The team is
working hard in practice.
You'll see an exciting Stanford
volleyball team in 1984."
