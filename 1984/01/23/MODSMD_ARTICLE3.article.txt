# Justice chief Smith resigns
## Meese rumored as successor 
### LISA LYNCH 
Compiled from wire and staff reports
William French Smith, the multi
millionare corporate lawyer who has
served as attorney general for the
past three years, resigned yesterday
without giving an official explana
tion for his resignation, according to
administration sources.
According to several Stanford fac
ulty members, his resignation was
unexpected but not surprising.
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin,
who was an adviser to the Reagan
campaign, speculated that the resig
nation had something to do with the
demands of the attorney general
post and with Smith's success in his
private practice.
"I think when someone goes into
government from Smith's type of
practice, he first of all takes a gigan
tic cut in pay, and secondly enters
into a situation extremely demand
ing of his time. After spending that
much time in a pressure-cooker po
sition, he probably decided it was
time to go back into private
practice," Boskin said.
Another possible reason for
Smith's resignation, according to
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall, is that Reagan may want
Smith, a close personal friend, to
help with his upcoming presidential
campaign.
"I can't imagine any ideological
reason why Smith would resign . . .
but it seems that it would be inap
propiate for him to remain as attor
ney general were he to actively par
ticipate in Reagan's campaign,"
Marshall said.
Administration sources told
reporters that. Presidential Coun
s«»/or fccfw in Meese, adviser to
Reagan since his first term as gover
nor of California, will probably be
chosen to succeed Smith. Meese, a

former deputy district attorney who
has long been interested in law and
law enforcement, is described
sources as a "tougher law-and-orefer
activist" than Smith, whose effect
on the Justice Department has been
said to be minimal.
Boskin agrees that Meese would
be a likely candidate, but said, I'm
not certain he wants the job. He may
enjoy what he's doing right now.

He explained that as attorney gen
eral Meese would have to sacrifice
his "broader influence" and greater
contact with the president as
Reagan's adviser in order to focus
on more specific issues.
Even though Meese is currently an
administration official, his nomina
tion as attorney general would have
to be confirmed by the Senate. Offi
cial estimations of his chances <>>
being confirmed arc mostly
point to Meese
as a controversial figure. Sen.
