# Justice chief Smith resigns
## Meese rumored as successor 
### LISA LYNCH 
Compiled from wire and staff reports
William French Smith, the multi
millionare corporate lawyer who has
served as attorney general for the
past three years, resigned yesterday
without giving an official explana
tion for his resignation, according to
administration sources.
According to several Stanford fac
ulty members, his resignation was
unexpected but not surprising.
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin,
who was an adviser to the Reagan
campaign, speculated that the resig
nation had something to do with the
demands of the attorney general
post and with Smith's success in his
private practice.
"I think when someone goes into
government from Smith's type of
practice, he first of all takes a gigan
tic cut in pay, and secondly enters
into a situation extremely demand
ing of his time. After spending that
much time in a pressure-cooker po
sition, he probably decided it was
time to go back into private
practice," Boskin said.
Another possible reason for
Smith's resignation, according to
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall, is that Reagan may want
Smith, a close personal friend, to
help with his upcoming presidential
campaign.
"I can't imagine any ideological
reason why Smith would resign . . .
but it seems that it would be inap
propiate for him to remain as attor
ney general were he to actively par
ticipate in Reagan's campaign,"
Marshall said.
Administration sources told
reporters that. Presidential Coun
s«»/or fccfw in Meese, adviser to
Reagan since his first term as gover
nor of California, will probably be
chosen to succeed Smith. Meese, a

former deputy district attorney who
has long been interested in law and
law enforcement, is described
sources as a "tougher law-and-orefer
activist" than Smith, whose effect
on the Justice Department has been
said to be minimal.
Boskin agrees that Meese would
be a likely candidate, but said, I'm
not certain he wants the job. He may
enjoy what he's doing right now.

He explained that as attorney gen
eral Meese would have to sacrifice
his "broader influence" and greater
contact with the president as
Reagan's adviser in order to focus
on more specific issues.
Even though Meese is currently an
administration official, his nomina
tion as attorney general would have
to be confirmed by the Senate. Offi
cial estimations of his chances <>>
being confirmed arc mostly
point to Meese
as a controversial figure. Sen.


Edwin Meese
Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), said that
Meese would be subjected to in
tense questioning but would even
tually be confirmed.
"The way the Senate is presently
constituted, it makes no difference
whether someone is very good or
very, very bad," Leahy said. "If the
president sent the name of Jack the
Ripper to be Surgeon General, it
would be confirmed."
The debate around Meese would
focus partly on the fact that he was
Reagan's chief of staff during the
1980 presidential campaign. The last
close presidential campaign aide to
serve as attorney general was John
Mitchell, who was convicted of

Watergate-era crimes. In a 1975 final
report, the Watergate special prose
cutor warned that, "The president
should not nominate and the Senate
should not confirm as attorney gen
eral or as any other appointee in
high justice posts, a person who has
served as the president's campaign
manager or in a similar high-level
campaign role."
Democrats have reacted to the
prospect of Meese's candidacy with
criticism and cries of cronyism. Ac
cording to Sen. Howard Metzen
baum (D-Ohio), a member of the
Senate Judiciary Commitee, which
will conduct the confirmation
hearings, "William French Smith has
not been a distinguished attorney
general, but if Ed Meese is ap
pointed it would just be another ex

ample of government by political
crony. It would certainly lower the
stature of the attorney general's of
fice."
Some observers, saying that the
political wisdom of appointing
Meese to Smith's post is dubious,
have theorized that perhaps Reagan
may choose not to stand for re
election.
Law Prof. William Gould said he
thought that Smith's leaving could
also point to Reagan's possible
withdrawal from the presidential
race. "High-level officials often
leave their posts when the ad
minstration is leaving," Could said.
"Since Smith is so close to Reagan,
it's interesting that he should
choose to leave now."

choose to leave now."
Compiled from wire and staff reports
William French Smith, the multi
millionare corporate lawyer who has
served as attorney general for the
past three years, resigned yesterday
without giving an official explana
tion for his resignation, according to
administration sources.
According to several Stanford fac
ulty members, his resignation was
unexpected but not surprising.
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin,
who was an adviser to the Reagan
campaign, speculated that the resig
nation had something to do with the
demands of the attorney general
post and with Smith's success in his
private practice.
"I think when someone goes into
government from Smith's type of
practice, he first of all takes a gigan
tic cut in pay, and secondly enters
into a situation extremely demand
ing of his time. After spending that
much time in a pressure-cooker po
sition, he probably decided it was
time to go back into private
practice," Boskin said.
Another possible reason for
Smith's resignation, according to
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall, is that Reagan may want
Smith, a close personal friend, to
help with his upcoming presidential
campaign.
"I can't imagine any ideological
reason why Smith would resign . . .
but it seems that it would be inap
propiate for him to remain as attor
ney general were he to actively par
ticipate in Reagan's campaign,"
Marshall said.
Administration sources told
reporters that. Presidential Coun
s«»/or fccfw in Meese, adviser to
Reagan since his first term as gover
nor of California, will probably be
chosen to succeed Smith. Meese, a

former deputy district attorney who
has long been interested in law and
law enforcement, is described
sources as a "tougher law-and-orefer
activist" than Smith, whose effect
on the Justice Department has been
said to be minimal.
Boskin agrees that Meese would
be a likely candidate, but said, I'm
not certain he wants the job. He may
enjoy what he's doing right now.

He explained that as attorney gen
eral Meese would have to sacrifice
his "broader influence" and greater
contact with the president as
Reagan's adviser in order to focus
on more specific issues.
Even though Meese is currently an
administration official, his nomina
tion as attorney general would have
to be confirmed by the Senate. Offi
cial estimations of his chances <>>
being confirmed arc mostly
point to Meese
as a controversial figure. Sen.


Edwin Meese
Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), said that
Meese would be subjected to in
tense questioning but would even
tually be confirmed.
"The way the Senate is presently
constituted, it makes no difference
whether someone is very good or
very, very bad," Leahy said. "If the
president sent the name of Jack the
Ripper to be Surgeon General, it
would be confirmed."
The debate around Meese would
focus partly on the fact that he was
Reagan's chief of staff during the
1980 presidential campaign. The last
close presidential campaign aide to
serve as attorney general was John
Mitchell, who was convicted of

Watergate-era crimes. In a 1975 final
report, the Watergate special prose
cutor warned that, "The president
should not nominate and the Senate
should not confirm as attorney gen
eral or as any other appointee in
high justice posts, a person who has
served as the president's campaign
manager or in a similar high-level
campaign role."
Democrats have reacted to the
prospect of Meese's candidacy with
criticism and cries of cronyism. Ac
cording to Sen. Howard Metzen
baum (D-Ohio), a member of the
Senate Judiciary Commitee, which
will conduct the confirmation
hearings, "William French Smith has
not been a distinguished attorney
general, but if Ed Meese is ap
pointed it would just be another ex

ample of government by political
crony. It would certainly lower the
stature of the attorney general's of
fice."
Some observers, saying that the
political wisdom of appointing
Meese to Smith's post is dubious,
have theorized that perhaps Reagan
may choose not to stand for re
election.
Law Prof. William Gould said he
thought that Smith's leaving could
also point to Reagan's possible
withdrawal from the presidential
race. "High-level officials often
leave their posts when the ad
minstration is leaving," Could said.
"Since Smith is so close to Reagan,
it's interesting that he should
choose to leave now."
