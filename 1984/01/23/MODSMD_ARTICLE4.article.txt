# Committee of 15 gets more work, influence
## 
### SUSAN PORTER-SHIRLEY 
The Committee of 15 is but one of
many in the tangle of committees
that comprises the University bu
reaucracy, and it is less known than
most of them. But the panel is ex
pected to have a substantial influ
ence this year in responding to
three student concerns expressed
last spring in a campus vote.
The panel is responsible for
proposing amendments to the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, a
lengthy document which sets forth
the rules that comprise the Univer
sity's judicial system.
Created in the late 1960s in
response to student concern about
lack of involvement in the judicial
system, the committee has been of
little consequence in recent years.
Not since October 1981 has it
brought an amendment proposal
before the ASSU Senate and the Fac
ulty Senate. Last year, the commit
tee never met.
But, because of a measure on last
spring's student ballot, this year
promises to be a more active one for
the committee. A chairman, Electri
cal Engineering Prof. Ronald
Bracewell, and other new members
of the panel — which is composed
of six students, six faculty members
and three administrators — were ap
pointed Jan. 17, and their work is ex
pected to begin soon.
The ballot measure, which at
tracted little attention but was ap
proved by a wide margin, was in
tended to give students more input
into the student conduct process

here. In an attempt to clarify
procedures of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) and the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC), it
recommended that the Committee
of 15 make amendments to charter
provisions regarding the groups.
The measure recommended that
the committee make more specific
provisions regarding the member
ship policies of the SJC, faculty re
sponsibility to abide by the Honor
Code, and the rights and privileges
of student groups.
The SJC is responsible for protect
ing students against arbitrarily
imposed regulations and
procedures, and it grants trials to all
individuals who have been accused
of violating the Honor Code.
In naming members, the Faculty
Senate is free to choose from the
entire faculty, while the ASSU Sen
ate must choose from a randomly
selected sample of 25 students. This
means that the ASSU can choose
from only about 0.25 percent of the
students — a policy some say works
at cross-purposes to the SJC's goal
of student protection.
The resolution passed last spring
requests an amendment that would
allow for the same membership
policy to hold for both students and
faculty.
With regard to the Honor Code,
the resolution requested that an
amendment be proposed that
would clarify the faculty's responsi
bility under the Honor Code and the
methods that should be used for en
forcing it.
