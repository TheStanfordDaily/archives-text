plans to build a hazardous waste

After at least two years of plan
ning, construction on the Univer
sity's hazardous waste treatment
plant is expected to begin this
spring. But controversy remains
about the appropriateness of the
site and about the way in which
the University kept the communi
ty appraised of the situation.
Construction on the plant is
slated to start May 15, 1984 and
be completed July 1,1985. Activa
tion is scheduled for sometime in
August 1985.
The plant will be located to the
west of Campus Drive about 1000
feet from faculty residences and
1600 feet from Governor's Cor
ner.
Construction is pending action
by the Santa Clara County Plan
ning Commission, which will
decide on the plant after a public
hearing that has not yet been
scheduled.
A spokesperson for the plan
ning commission said the Univer
sity sent in an application for the
facility but that it was sent back
for lack of enough environmental

information.
The original idea for a
centralized facility came as a
result of new government regula
tions requiring universities to
build toxic waste collection sites.
The new center will basically
be a centralization of facilities
that already exist in different
parts of campus.
Alain Decleve, the University's
director of health and safety, said
the plant has to be on Stanford
land because stringent state reg
ulations about crossing public
roads with hazardous waste make
an off-campus site more expen
sive.
Local residents have raised
questions over the last few years
about the location of the plant
and its effects on the surround
ing area. The University,
however, says the problems have
been ironed out.
The Faculty Task Force for
Hazardous Waste Management
studied the proposal for the
centralized toxic waste treatment
plant from Dec. 16, 1982 until
April 26, 1983. The task force was
never able to reach a unanimous
decision on the location of the
facility, however.
According to the minutes of
the April 5, 1983, meeting, some
of the professors who made up
the task force endorsed sites A
through E (see map) because of
their proximity to the generators
of hazardous waste. Others

thought the site should be at G,
"as far away from main campus
as possible."
However, the task force made
no recommendation on a specific
site because it felt it didn't have
sufficient information to judge
one site over another. The task

force did, however, decide that
because transportation of waste
on campus would be, "relatively
free of hazard to the community
in general," the facility didn't
need to be near the generators
The new site, ), will become
