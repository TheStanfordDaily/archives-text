(Editor's note: This is the first in a
series concerning the University's
plans to build a hazardous waste
treatment plant on campus.
Today's article focuses on the
controversy surrounding the site
of the plant and the plant's func

After at least two years of plan
ning, construction on the Univer
sity's hazardous waste treatment
plant is expected to begin this
spring. But controversy remains
about the appropriateness of the
site and about the way in which
the University kept the communi
ty appraised of the situation.
Construction on the plant is
slated to start May 15, 1984 and
be completed July 1,1985. Activa
tion is scheduled for sometime in
August 1985.
The plant will be located to the
west of Campus Drive about 1000
feet from faculty residences and
1600 feet from Governor's Cor
ner.
Construction is pending action
by the Santa Clara County Plan
ning Commission, which will
decide on the plant after a public
hearing that has not yet been
scheduled.
A spokesperson for the plan
ning commission said the Univer
sity sent in an application for the
facility but that it was sent back
for lack of enough environmental

information.
The original idea for a
centralized facility came as a
result of new government regula
tions requiring universities to
build toxic waste collection sites.
The new center will basically
be a centralization of facilities
that already exist in different
parts of campus.
Alain Decleve, the University's
director of health and safety, said
the plant has to be on Stanford
land because stringent state reg
ulations about crossing public
roads with hazardous waste make
an off-campus site more expen
sive.
Local residents have raised
questions over the last few years
about the location of the plant
and its effects on the surround
ing area. The University,
however, says the problems have
been ironed out.
The Faculty Task Force for
Hazardous Waste Management
studied the proposal for the
centralized toxic waste treatment
plant from Dec. 16, 1982 until
April 26, 1983. The task force was
never able to reach a unanimous
decision on the location of the
facility, however.
According to the minutes of
the April 5, 1983, meeting, some
of the professors who made up
the task force endorsed sites A
through E (see map) because of
their proximity to the generators
of hazardous waste. Others

thought the site should be at G,
"as far away from main campus
as possible."
However, the task force made
no recommendation on a specific
site because it felt it didn't have
sufficient information to judge
one site over another. The task

force did, however, decide that
because transportation of waste
on campus would be, "relatively
free of hazard to the community
in general," the facility didn't
need to be near the generators
The new site, ), will become

part of a new Support Service Zone
being formed on the west side of
campus. The zone will take up 17 of
the 85 acres in the plot of land
bounded by Campus Drive, Willow
Road, Searsville Road and Pasteur
Drive and will also include other
support buildings for the Medical
Center and the campus as a whole.
The other possible sites, A
through I, were turned down for a
number of reasons:
• A,B,C,D — New boundaries for
the Support Service Zone excluded
these areas, according to a report
secured from Lynda Weisberg, assis
tant provost in the Office of Man
agement and Budget.
• E — This site was found to conflict
with future Medical Center academ
ic land-use needs.
• F,G — According to the report
from Weisberg's office, these have
"too much land area with strong his
torical association." The two areas
are, respectively, near the
Mausoleum and the stables.
• H — This site in the foothills is a
problem because it is too remote
and would be a security risk.
• I — This, the site of the present
temporary facility and the closest to
the generators of the hazardous
waste of all the proposed sites, was
deemed inappropriate for the waste
facilities, according to Decleve, be
cause of aesthetic reasons, the large
traffic flow and plans for a future
parking lot in the same location.
According to the site report from
Weisberg's office, J was chosen for
its "proximity, accessibility, and
ease of patrolling." The only two
disadvantages the report finds with J
are its expense and its "perceived
proximity to the Searsville block as
well as to residents across Willow
Road."
However, Kandis Scott, a resident
of the Searsville block, observed in a
letter she sent to members of the
Board of Trustees in September
1983: "The staff contends that the

facility will not be offensive in ap
pearance, sound or smell . . . sites
near the Red Barn (C) and the Arbo
retum (F) were rejected because the
visual effects of the hazardous waste
facility would 'intrude' on the am
bience, character and historical
values of these locations."
The administrative report of Oct.
11, 1983, says that reviewers of the
facility's plans found it safe on the
basis of, among other things, small
quantities of waste, limited amounts
of incineration, low waste toxicity
and the planned implementation of
a special three-point failure plan to
safeguard against a variety of possi
ble mishaps.
Three committees were set up to
study the three types of waste — bi
ological, chemical and radioactive
— to be handled at the center. At
this point it is not clear to what ex
tent the Hospital will use the new
facility. Administrators there are
trying to decide whether it will be
more efficient to continue incinera
tion at the Hospital or at the new
centralized facility.
The Medical School, however,
will be using the center for its waste.
The biological waste to be treated
at the plant will be in the form of
contaminated syringes, bandages
and other material, known at the
hospital as "red-bag waste." It
would also include such pathologi
cal waste as diseased organs, blood
and other anatomical parts. A large
part of the waste will be autoclaved
— sterlized by super-heated steam
— before leaving the Hospital to
sterilize it before incineration at the
facility.
Toxic chemical waste will be
treated at the center through
segregation, packaging and ship
pint to other centers for incinera

tion and landfill. Decleve said, "We
will recycle what we can within"
into paint thinners and other such
products.
The administration compares the
danger of the radioactive material to
be treated in the hazardous waste
facility to the amount found in an or
dinary wristwatch. Administration
members say there is no danger
from contact with the waste, and
physical harm can only result from
ingestion.
Roland Finston, director of Uni
versity health physics, estimates that
about 300 different projects on
campus use radioactive materials.
Those with short half will be
stored for up to three , in the
waste treatment center atter which
the radioactivity will have decayed
and the waste will be incinerated.
Tridium and Carbon 14, long half
life isotopes, will be, "incinerated in
known quantities and in observance
of air quality for radioactivity,"
Finston said. Other long half-life iso
topes will be put into 55-gallon
drums and shipped to a radioactive
disposal site in the state of Washing
ton.
University administrators say the
facility will be safe. Andy Doty,
director of community relations,
says, in respect to the effect on stu
dent residences, the project is "very
safe" and "very remote."
There are, however, concerns
about the facility. A Searsville block
resident who asked not to be identi
fied said he feels very strongly that
"in spite of all safeguards there is al
ways capacity for human error."
Scott, also a resident of the area,
says of the location, "Reality is that
the area is being highly developed.
It's not going to be in the middle of
nowhere for very long."
