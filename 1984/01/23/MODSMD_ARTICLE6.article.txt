U.S. will use preemptive strike
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz
confirmed yesterday that the administration might
launch a preemptive strike to forestall a new suicide
attack on the U.S. Marine force in Lebanon and ex
pressed deep concern about "the emergence of ter
ror as a kind of weapon of war by states."
Asked during a televised interview if it were true,
as an unnamed senior official suggested Friday, that
the United States might indeed use force to head off
a "kamikaze-type" attack, the secretary replied:
"Yes, I think we have to be very conscious of the rise
in terrorism, not only in Lebanon but around the
world."
"It is increasingly evident that it has a base in a

state, it isn't some random crazy group, it's some
thing that is organized, systematic, people get trained
for it," Shultz added on during an appearance on
ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley."
In Lebanon, Shultz continue'!, terrorist incidents
originate increasingly in Iran, ' with the acquies
cence of Syria." In addition, he said, "there's Libya,
and there's the Soviet Union."
"The emergence of terrorism as a kind of weapon
of war by states is something we have to be very con
cerned about," the secretary added.
To a suggestion that a preemptive strike against a
terrorist base would deepen U.S. involvement in the
Middle Eastern war, Shultz replied: "It's not involv
ing ourselves deeper ... to defend ourselves and
our citizens against these tactics of terrorism."

Quakes shake California coast
San Francisco — A "sharp" earthquake, followed
by a more moderate aftershock, shook houses for at
least 200 miles along the California coast — includ
ing the Stanford campus — last night. T here were no
immediate reports of injuries or damage.
The first quake, registering 5.25 on the Richter
Scale with an epicenter 12 miles southwest of Mon
terey, struck at 9:40 p.m., according to Patty Murtha
of the University of California Seismographic Station
in Berkeley.
The aftershock, which had a preliminary reading
of 4.0, hit nine minutes later, Murtha said.
(Students here felt the shake, but the director of
Stanford's marine biology center near Monterey
said he had no reports of damages.
"We were badly shaken up at home," explained
Prof. Colin Pittendrigh, director of the Hopkins

Marine Station. Pittendrigh, who lives in Pacifu
Grove, a small community just south of Monterey
said he felt "two good shakes," but his house w,t
undamaged.)
The stronger first quake, a roller that lastec
about 15 seconds, was felt as far south as San lur
Obispo and as far north as Marin County. Th«
epicenter for both quakes was approximately 7(
miles south of Stanford.
Any quake with a Richter Scale reading of over tivc
is capable of "considerable" damage, experts say
Every increase of one number means a tenfold in
crease in magnitude.
