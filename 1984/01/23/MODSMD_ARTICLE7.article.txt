The nuclear power industry suffered
a setback Saturday when three Ohio
utilities announced that they will try
to convert a nearly completed nuclear
power plant in Cincinnati to a coal
fired facility.
The Cincinnati Gas and Electric
Co. said the decision was made be
cause of the high cost of completing
the William H. Zimmer nuclear
facility in accordance with federal
regulations, and the uncertainty that
the plant would receive an operat
ing license once completed.
Officials said the Zimmer plant is
97 percent complete after outlays of
more than $1.6 billion. The Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) or
dered a halt to all but safety-related
work on the facility in November
1982, The New York Times reported.
A private consultant recently in
formed the utilities that they would
have to spend at least another $1.5
billion to meet federal requirements
and open the nuclear plant by 1986.
The decision marks the third
major blow to the nuclear industry
this year. Earlier this week the $2.5
billion Marble Hill nuclear plant in
Indiana was abandoned due to lack
of funds. And last week the nearly

completed $3.35 billion Common
wealth Edison facility near Rockford,
111., was denied an operating license
by the NRC, which cited inadequate
quality control in the plant's con
struction.
Converting a nuclear power plant
to a coal-tired unit has never been
attempted before in this country.
Ohio officials said conversion may
be cheaper than trying to complete
Zimmer as a nuclear facility, adding
that it may be operational as a coal
plant by 1991.

The Air Force announced Saturday
that it has conducted the first test
flight of an anti-satellite missile. The
test apparently involved only a
booster and was not aimed at any
target.
At the Pentagon, Commander Jef
frey Rink told The New York Times
that details of the test are classified
and will not be disclosed.
The missile was fired from an F-15
fighter plane flying out of Edwards
Air Force Base. While the Air Force
has conducted "captive-carry" tests
over the past year — taking the
missile aloft attached to the F-15 —
Saturday's test marked the first actu

al tiring of the missile.
The test of the U.S.-launched
Anti-satellite (ASAT) missile seems
likely to fuel the debate over Presi
dent Reagan's "Star Wars" space
weapons system. The U.S. anti
satellite weapon is described as con
siderably more sophisticated in
design than its Soviet counterpart.

The president of the American Uni
versity of Beirut, Malcolm Kerr, was
shot in the head as he emerged from
an elevator to enter his second-floor
campus office Tuesday.
Government-run Beirut radio said
Kerr, 52, was pronounced dead on
arrival at American University Hospi
tal. The privately-owned Voice of
Lebanon radio station reported that
Kerr died while undergoing emer
gency surgery to remove a bullet
from his brain.
There were also conflicting
reports about the attack. An initial
report said a lone gunman fired a
bullet into Kerr's head from a
silencer-equipped pistol and
escaped, but the state radio re
ported that three assailants were in
volved in the shooting.
In other news from Lebanon,

Syrian-backed insurgents shelled
President Amin Gemayal's govern
ment palace Saturday during a battle
with Lebanese soldiers. No
casualties were reported in the
palace, but two Lebanese corporals
were killed and another soldier was
wounded in the barrage.

"Positive developments" in Poland
and an appeal by Lech Walesa, foun
der of the Solidarity labor union, have
prompted the United States to ease
two of the economic sanctions
imposed when the Warsaw govern
ment declared martial law in 1981.
Polish fishing vessels are now per
mitted to operate in U.S. waters,
and the right of a limited number of
charter flights to land in the United
States has also been restored, accor
ding to Thursday's White House an
nouncement. Regularly scheduled
Polish flights remain suspended.
The new measures constitute "no
change in policy," presidential
spokesman Larry Speakes said,
noting that more stringent restric
tions, including a freeze on trade
credits, remain in effect.
The positive developments that
helped trigger the White House ac
tion include the release of most po
litical prisoners and the visit of Pope
John Paul II last year, according to
State Department spokesman Alan
Romberg.
"It is the president's hope that the
administration action will help con
tribute to the process of reconcilia
tion and the improvement of human
rights in Poland," Romberg told The
New York Times.
In Warsaw, Walesa said he
welcomed the easing of sanctions
but tacitly reiterated his appeal last
month that Poland needs "not
losses of millions of dollars, but aid
of billions of dollars." The 1983
Nobel Peace Prize recipient said he
is "in favor of lifting all the sanctions
against Poland, of financial assis
tance and things like that."
There was no immediate reaction
from the Polish government, which
has also been pushing for the
removal of all sanctions. Govern
ment officials claim that the curbs
have cost Poland as much as $12.5
billion.

Secretary of State George Shultz
said he had "nothing positive to
report" after a five-hour meeting in
Stockholm on Wednesday with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
aimed at breaking the deadlock in
superpower negotiations.
But Shultz vowed that the United
States would maintain its
"willpower and self-confidence"
while seeking new opportunities for
a U.S.-Soviet dialogue. He also indi
cated that the Soviets may be pre
paring to reopen talks limiting con
ventional forces in Europe.
Those talks, called Mutual and
Balanced force Reduction (MBFR),
focus on the troops stationed in
Europe by NATO and the Warsaw
Pact. Swedish Foreign Minister Len
nart Bodstrom said the MBFR
negotiations may begin by March.

Egypt, estranged from the Arab
world after the 1979 Camp David Ac
cords, was readmitted to the 42-
member Islamic Conference after a
four-day meeting in Casablanca,
Morocco. Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said his country would ac
cept no conditions for its return,
and the decision to readmit Egypt
prompted Libya, Syria and South
Yemen to walk out of the talks.
The grounds for readmittance ap
parently included Mubarak's cooler
treatment of Israel, particularly
since the 1982 Israeli invasion of
Lebanon, and the friendliness with
which he received Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, in Cairo after Arafat
evacuated the Lebanese port of
Tripoli.

The president of the American Uni

shot in the head as he emerged from
an elevator to enter his second-floor

Government-run Beirut radio said
Kerr, 52, was pronounced dead on
arrival at American University Hospi

Kerr died while undergoing emer

from his brain.
There were also conflicting
reports about the attack. An initial
report said a lone gunman fired a
bullet into Kerr's head from a
silencer-equipped pistol and
escaped, but the state radio re

"Positive developments" in Poland
and an appeal by Lech Walesa, foun
der of the Solidarity labor union, have
prompted the United States to ease
two of the economic sanctions
imposed when the Warsaw govern
ment declared martial law in 1981.
Polish fishing vessels are now per
mitted to operate in U.S. waters,
and the right of a limited number of
charter flights to land in the United
States has also been restored, accor
ding to Thursday's White House an
nouncement. Regularly scheduled
Polish flights remain suspended.
The new measures constitute "no
change in policy," presidential
spokesman Larry Speakes said,
noting that more stringent restric
tions, including a freeze on trade
credits, remain in effect.
The positive developments that
helped trigger the White House ac
tion include the release of most po
litical prisoners and the visit of Pope
John Paul II last year, according to
State Department spokesman Alan
Romberg.
"It is the president's hope that the
administration action will help con
tribute to the process of reconcilia
tion and the improvement of human
rights in Poland," Romberg told The
New York Times.
In Warsaw, Walesa said he
welcomed the easing of sanctions
but tacitly reiterated his appeal last
month that Poland needs "not
losses of millions of dollars, but aid
of billions of dollars." The 1983
Nobel Peace Prize recipient said he
is "in favor of lifting all the sanctions
against Poland, of financial assis
tance and things like that."
There was no immediate reaction
from the Polish government, which
has also been pushing for the
removal of all sanctions. Govern
ment officials claim that the curbs
have cost Poland as much as $12.5
billion.

Secretary of State George Shultz
said he had "nothing positive to
report" after a five-hour meeting in
Stockholm on Wednesday with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
aimed at breaking the deadlock in
superpower negotiations.
But Shultz vowed that the United
States would maintain its
"willpower and self-confidence"
while seeking new opportunities for
a U.S.-Soviet dialogue. He also indi
cated that the Soviets may be pre
paring to reopen talks limiting con
ventional forces in Europe.
Those talks, called Mutual and
Balanced force Reduction (MBFR),
focus on the troops stationed in
Europe by NATO and the Warsaw
Pact. Swedish Foreign Minister Len

negotiations may begin by March.

Egypt, estranged from the Arab
world after the 1979 Camp David Ac

member Islamic Conference after a
four-day meeting in Casablanca,
Morocco. Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said his country would ac
cept no conditions for its return,
and the decision to readmit Egypt
prompted Libya, Syria and South
Yemen to walk out of the talks.
The grounds for readmittance ap
parently included Mubarak's cooler
treatment of Israel, particularly
since the 1982 Israeli invasion of
Lebanon, and the friendliness with
which he received Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, in Cairo after Arafat
evacuated the Lebanese port of
Tripoli.

The nuclear power industry suffered
a setback Saturday when three Ohio
utilities announced that they will try
to convert a nearly completed nuclear
power plant in Cincinnati to a coal
fired facility.
The Cincinnati Gas and Electric
Co. said the decision was made be
cause of the high cost of completing
the William H. Zimmer nuclear
facility in accordance with federal
regulations, and the uncertainty that
the plant would receive an operat
ing license once completed.
Officials said the Zimmer plant is
97 percent complete after outlays of
more than $1.6 billion. The Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) or
dered a halt to all but safety-related
work on the facility in November
1982, The New York Times reported.
A private consultant recently in
formed the utilities that they would
have to spend at least another $1.5
billion to meet federal requirements
and open the nuclear plant by 1986.
The decision marks the third
major blow to the nuclear industry
this year. Earlier this week the $2.5
billion Marble Hill nuclear plant in
Indiana was abandoned due to lack
of funds. And last week the nearly

completed $3.35 billion Common
wealth Edison facility near Rockford,
111., was denied an operating license
by the NRC, which cited inadequate
quality control in the plant's con
struction.
Converting a nuclear power plant
to a coal-tired unit has never been
attempted before in this country.
Ohio officials said conversion may
be cheaper than trying to complete
Zimmer as a nuclear facility, adding
that it may be operational as a coal
plant by 1991.

The Air Force announced Saturday
that it has conducted the first test
flight of an anti-satellite missile. The
test apparently involved only a
booster and was not aimed at any
target.
At the Pentagon, Commander Jef
frey Rink told The New York Times
that details of the test are classified
and will not be disclosed.
The missile was fired from an F-15
fighter plane flying out of Edwards
Air Force Base. While the Air Force
has conducted "captive-carry" tests
over the past year — taking the
missile aloft attached to the F-15 —
Saturday's test marked the first actu

al tiring of the missile.
The test of the U.S.-launched
Anti-satellite (ASAT) missile seems
likely to fuel the debate over Presi
dent Reagan's "Star Wars" space
weapons system. The U.S. anti
satellite weapon is described as con
siderably more sophisticated in
design than its Soviet counterpart.
