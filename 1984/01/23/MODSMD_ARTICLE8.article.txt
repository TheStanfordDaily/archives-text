## Government funds psychic research 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
It seems that there would
be an almost unbridgeable
gap between the politician
and the psychic — one
belongs to the domain of
cold fact and Machiavellian
pragmatism, the other to
the realm of science fiction
and certain Stephen King
movies.
But that gap is closing.
According to physicist
and pyschic researcher
Russell Targ, both the
United States and the So
viet Union have turned to
psychic phenomena as a
"last frontier" in detense
research.
Psychic research is more
legitimate in the Soviet Un
ion than here, Targ said. After
attending a conference
held by the Soviet Academy
of Science, he realized that
the Soviets view study of
the paranormal as an ordi
nary science.
Although psychic re
search is a shadowy field in
the higher level of Ameri
can science, there is a
healthy interest here
among both scientists and
politicians in the manifesta
tion and application of psy
chic power.
Targ was involved for a
decade in a multi-million
dollar government program
of psychic research. His
work concentrated mainly
on the phenomenon of
remote viewing, which he
describes as "the ability to
describe what is going on
in distant places."
He explained that since
some of his work was clas
sified, he could not specify
sources ot funding for spe
cific projects, but admitted
that government agencies
were high on the list of fun
ding sources, which also in
cluded the U.S. Navy and
Richard Bach, the author of
"Jonathan Livingston
Seagull."
"'Jonathan Livingston
Seagull' is about a seagull
with out-of-body experi
ences, but we surmised

that the book was actually
autobiographical," Targ
said. "We approached
Bach and he acknowledged
we were right, and said that
he would fund our research
as long as we helped him to
successfully utilize remote
viewing."
In 1972, Targ said, he was
doing laser research at Syl
vania in Mountain View,
when NASA asked him to
participate in a conference
on "speculative technolo
gy." At the conference, he
proposed his idea for an
ESP training machine,
which would allegedly im
prove a subject's perfor
mance on ESP tests through
feedback. The government
was interested.
"Sylvania," Targ said,
"wasn't interested in ESP,"
so he moved to Stanford
Research International, a
research group that
severed its ties with Stan
ford in 1970. Working with
physicist Harold Puthoff,
Targ designed, constructed
and tested the ESP ma
chine.
"The machine has four
possible states which it
chooses among alternative
ly, and the subject has to
guess which state it is in. If
he is correct, a bell will
ring," Targ said. The scien
tists discovered that, after
using the machine, a
"significant number" of
subjects improved their
scores, and no one actually
got worse.
At the same time they
were working with the ESP
machine, Targ and Puthoff
had begun to conduct
remote viewing experi
ments. They designed an
experiment in which one of
them would leave SRI and
travel to a site randomly
chosen from a preselected
set. A physicist who
remained at SRI would then
'describe' the site and
make a drawing, based on
the psychic signals he was
receiving from Targ or Put
hoff.

After working successful
ly with SRI physicists, the
scientists began using
scientists in their experi
ments. Targ said that both
the scientists and non
scientists improved in their
psychic abilities through
practice, and many became
remarkably accurate in
their predictions.
In 1981, a decade after
the intial experiments with
the "ESP machine," the
government agencies fun
ding Targ and Puthoff an
nounced that they were no
longer interested in doing
psychic research — accor
ding to Targ, they insisted it
was time to begin inventing
applications for the psychic
tools they had discovered.
Targ left SRI with Keith
Harary, a psychiatrist who
had joined SRI the year
before, and, together with
businessman Anthony
White, formed a psychic re
search corporation called
Delphi International.
"I don't plan to go back
to SRI," Targ said,
"because I feel that it is im
portant right now to dis
seminate the information
we've learned so far, and
because I feel that the in
formation we have is too

important to be owned by
the government — ours or
a foreign power.''
Delphi immediately
began working on several
projects, applying what
Targ, Puthoff, Harary and
others had done to more
commercial applications.
Atari is interested in a video
game based on some of the
same principles as Targ's
original ESP machine,
where the player would use
his mind instead of a joy
stick to control the machine.
Psychic projection is also
being used to attempt to lo
cate oil and other natural
resources.
The most direct commer
cial application of psychic
phenomena that Delphi has
done has been to accurate
ly predict fluctuations in
the price of silver. Delphi,
using Harary's predictions,
made nine speculative in
vestments in the futures ex
change — and was success
ful nine out of nine times.
The complexity of silver
futures makes this almost a
technically impossible feat;
on the 10th attempt, Harary
failed, but not before
making an outstanding
demonstration of paranor
mal ability.

"We figured Harary had
become run-down by
doing the same thing over
and over, so we decided to
give him a vacation," Targ
said, adding that Delphi
plans to resume the proj
ect.
Harary and Targ have
written a book, called
"Mind-Reach," abort the
psychic research done in
the United States and the
USSR and its implications.
Due to be released in a
month, the book details
several remote viewing ex
periments, including one in
which a viewer in California
is asked to describe a site
randomly chosen and
visited by Targ in New York
City.
Ihe viewer described "a
cement depression — as if
a dry fountain — with a ce
ment post in the middle or
inside" and said there
seemed to be pigeons sur
rounding the object.
Targ was in fact at the
central fountain in Wash
ington Square Park, which
was temporarily dry, had a
cement post in the middle,
and was surrounded by
pigeons.
Whether or not psychic
warfare will become a
reality is debatable. Targ
said that he told the Soviets
at the Academy of Sciences
conference that it "just
isn't possible to hide things
anymore — if a well
intentioned psychic can put
his mind anywhere on the
planet and describe what is
there, then the whole con
cept of secret installation
has to be rethought."
He added that the Soviets
are not only interested in
remote viewing, where the
subject attempts to see
things at a distance, but
also are investigating meth
ods of psychic mind con
trol.
"In the next few years,"
he predicted, "there will be
a great increase in investi
gation and use of pyschic
phenomena."


ESP: Psychics at SRI made these drawings in remote viewing
experiments, when they used clairvoyance to identify the
Louisiana Superdome, snown in the photographs.

said. "We approached
Bach and he acknowledged
we were right, and said that
he would fund our research
as long as we helped him to
successfully utilize remote
viewing."
In 1972, Targ said, he was
doing laser research at Syl
vania in Mountain View,
when NASA asked him to
participate in a conference
on "speculative technolo
gy." At the conference, he
proposed his idea for an
ESP training machine,
which would allegedly im
prove a subject's perfor
mance on ESP tests through
feedback. The government
was interested.
"Sylvania," Targ said,
"wasn't interested in ESP,"
so he moved to Stanford
Research International, a
research group that
severed its ties with Stan
ford in 1970. Working with
physicist Harold Puthoff,
Targ designed, constructed
and tested the ESP ma
chine.
"The machine has four
possible states which it
chooses among alternative
ly, and the subject has to
guess which state it is in. If
he is correct, a bell will
ring," Targ said. The scien
tists discovered that, after
using the machine, a
"significant number" of
subjects improved their
scores, and no one actually
got worse.
At the same time they
were working with the ESP
machine, Targ and Puthoff
had begun to conduct
remote viewing experi
ments. They designed an
experiment in which one of
them would leave SRI and
travel to a site randomly
chosen from a preselected
set. A physicist who
remained at SRI would then
'describe' the site and
make a drawing, based on
the psychic signals he was
receiving from Targ or Put
hoff.

After working successful
ly with SRI physicists, the
scientists began using
scientists in their experi
ments. Targ said that both
the scientists and non
scientists improved in their
psychic abilities through
practice, and many became
remarkably accurate in
their predictions.
In 1981, a decade after
the intial experiments with
the "ESP machine," the
government agencies fun
ding Targ and Puthoff an
nounced that they were no
longer interested in doing
psychic research — accor
ding to Targ, they insisted it
was time to begin inventing
applications for the psychic
tools they had discovered.
Targ left SRI with Keith
Harary, a psychiatrist who
had joined SRI the year
before, and, together with
businessman Anthony
White, formed a psychic re
search corporation called
Delphi International.
"I don't plan to go back
to SRI," Targ said,
"because I feel that it is im
portant right now to dis
seminate the information
we've learned so far, and
because I feel that the in
formation we have is too

important to be owned by
the government — ours or
a foreign power.''
Delphi immediately
began working on several
projects, applying what
Targ, Puthoff, Harary and
others had done to more
commercial applications.
Atari is interested in a video
game based on some of the
same principles as Targ's
original ESP machine,
where the player would use
his mind instead of a joy
stick to control the machine.
Psychic projection is also
being used to attempt to lo
cate oil and other natural
resources.
The most direct commer
cial application of psychic
phenomena that Delphi has
done has been to accurate
ly predict fluctuations in
the price of silver. Delphi,
using Harary's predictions,
made nine speculative in
vestments in the futures ex
change — and was success
ful nine out of nine times.
The complexity of silver
futures makes this almost a
technically impossible feat;
on the 10th attempt, Harary
failed, but not before
making an outstanding
demonstration of paranor
mal ability.

"We figured Harary had
become run-down by
doing the same thing over
and over, so we decided to
give him a vacation," Targ
said, adding that Delphi
plans to resume the proj
ect.
Harary and Targ have
written a book, called
"Mind-Reach," abort the
psychic research done in
the United States and the
USSR and its implications.
Due to be released in a
month, the book details
several remote viewing ex
periments, including one in
which a viewer in California
is asked to describe a site
randomly chosen and
visited by Targ in New York
City.
Ihe viewer described "a
cement depression — as if
a dry fountain — with a ce
ment post in the middle or
inside" and said there
seemed to be pigeons sur
rounding the object.
Targ was in fact at the
central fountain in Wash
ington Square Park, which
was temporarily dry, had a
cement post in the middle,
and was surrounded by
pigeons.
Whether or not psychic
warfare will become a
reality is debatable. Targ
said that he told the Soviets
at the Academy of Sciences
conference that it "just
isn't possible to hide things
anymore — if a well
intentioned psychic can put
his mind anywhere on the
planet and describe what is
there, then the whole con
cept of secret installation
has to be rethought."
He added that the Soviets
are not only interested in
remote viewing, where the
subject attempts to see
things at a distance, but
also are investigating meth
ods of psychic mind con
trol.
"In the next few years,"
he predicted, "there will be
a great increase in investi
gation and use of pyschic
phenomena."


ESP: Psychics at SRI made these drawings in remote viewing
experiments, when they used clairvoyance to identify the
Louisiana Superdome, snown in the photographs.
It seems that there would
be an almost unbridgeable
gap between the politician
and the psychic — one
belongs to the domain of
cold fact and Machiavellian
pragmatism, the other to
the realm of science fiction
and certain Stephen King
movies.
But that gap is closing.
According to physicist
and pyschic researcher
Russell Targ, both the
United States and the So
viet Union have turned to
psychic phenomena as a
"last frontier" in detense
research.
Psychic research is more
legitimate in the Soviet Un
ion than here, Targ said. After
attending a conference
held by the Soviet Academy
of Science, he realized that
the Soviets view study of
the paranormal as an ordi
nary science.
Although psychic re
search is a shadowy field in
the higher level of Ameri
can science, there is a
healthy interest here
among both scientists and
politicians in the manifesta
tion and application of psy
chic power.
Targ was involved for a
decade in a multi-million
dollar government program
of psychic research. His
work concentrated mainly
on the phenomenon of
remote viewing, which he
describes as "the ability to
describe what is going on
in distant places."
He explained that since
some of his work was clas
sified, he could not specify
sources ot funding for spe
cific projects, but admitted
that government agencies
were high on the list of fun
ding sources, which also in
cluded the U.S. Navy and
Richard Bach, the author of
"Jonathan Livingston
Seagull."
"'Jonathan Livingston
Seagull' is about a seagull
with out-of-body experi
ences, but we surmised

that the book was actually
autobiographical," Targ
said. "We approached
Bach and he acknowledged
we were right, and said that
