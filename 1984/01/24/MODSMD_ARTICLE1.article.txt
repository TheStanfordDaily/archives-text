# White House foregoes Hoover-run center
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
The White House has apparently
abandoned its insistence that the University
accept a public policy center as an in
separable part of a Ronald Reagan presiden
tial library complex, a move that opens the
way for a Reagan library and museum to be
built here.
Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese,
writing to Board of Trustees President
William Kimball on behalf of President
Reagan, accepted Stanford's offer to locate
a presidential library and museum here
saying, "We are very pleased that the
(library complex) will be located on the
Stanford University campus."
In the letter, dated Jan. 17 but received
and made public yesterday, Meese went on
to say that Reagan still believes that a public
policy center should be part of the com
plex, but now favors the idea of building an
"independent national center" as "a com
promise that might be acceptable to all par
ties concerned."
Whether the public affairs center remains
linked to the library was not entirely clear
from Meese's letter.
But Hoover Institution officials close to
the White House were adamant in saying
that the president has acceded to Stan
ford's request that the library, museum and
public policy center be "decoupled" —
treated as separate entities rather than as
part of a package deal.
Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell,
who received a copy of the letter from

Meese, said in a statement, "By decoupling
the library and museum from the center for
public affairs, as recommended by the Uni
versity, and by proposing a national center,
administratively independent from both the
Hoover Institution and the faculty gover
nance structure of the University, the White
House has offered a reasonable compro
mise."
Martin Anderson, a Hoover senior fellow
and former chief domestic policy adviser to
Reagan who drafted the original library pro
posal, told The Daily that even if the White
House and the University are unable to
reach a compromise on the policy center,
the White House would still allow the li
brary and the museum to come here.
Stanford officials, however, were cau
tious in their reactions, and refused to
characterize the letter as a breakthrough in
the negotiations, which have been at an im
passe due to disagreements between the
White House and the University over the
proposed policy center.
"It appears that the White House has
decided to proceed on the library, with an
included museum," University President
Donald Kennedy said from Colorado,
where he is vacationing and attending a
conference. "But the degree to which the
White House is willing to do so without the
center is not entirely clear to me from
hearing Mr. Meese's letter. I am sure the
Board of Trustees will consider it at their
next meeting Feb. 14."
The University and the White House have
been in agreement since October over the

library and the museum, but sharp differ
ences over governance of the proposed
policy center kept the two sides apart in
their negotiations.
The formal Stanford offer to the White
House, made by the Board of Trustees Dec.
13, welcomed the library and museum but
said any center for public affairs must come
under normal academic governance. Be
cause the White House had insisted that a
center run by the Hoover Institution be part
of any complex, the resolution was an im
plicit rejection of the White House plan.
Then, Meese said the Board offer was un
satisfactory to the President.
But in the Jan. 17 letter, he said the presi
dent "was pleased to learn that in their
resolution of 13 December 1983 the Stan
ford University Board of Trustees
welcomed the location of the Ronald
Reagan presidential library and museum at
the University, with the Hoover Institution
in charge of these two entities."
"We are very pleased that the (library and
museum) will be located on the Stanford
University campus, and we accept the offer
of the Board of Trustees in this regard," the
letter said.
The library and museum, once built,
would be operated by the General Services
Administration as part of the national ar
chives.
It was at the Dec. 7 meeting with Stanford
officials that the White House first suggest-

reservations regarding such an idea.

"The more distinctive the philoso
phy, of course, the more interesting
the archives of an administration are

same token, it becomes all the more
important for the University to
assure both the fact and the appear
ance of political neutrality — those
characteristics of academic excel
lence that the University's mode of
governance is designed to insure."
Meese said, "Such an indepen
dent entity, located on leased land,
would not require the administra
tive involvement of either the
Hoover Institution or other ele
ments of the University. We would
very much appreciate it if the Board
could review this one remaining

issue at its earliest possible conveni
ence."
Political Science Prof. John Man

Hoover Institution and opponent of
the Reagan complex, said that he is
"really pleased that the plans for the
expansion of the Hoover Institution
and its control of a policy center
seem to be dead."
But English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said he was "sad to hear" the news.
"I bet that sooner or later' Vy'll get
a policy center."

the development, saying, "I think it

the White House were adamant in saying
that the president has acceded to Stan
ford's request that the library, museum and
public policy center be "decoupled" —
treated as separate entities rather than as
part of a package deal.
Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell,
who received a copy of the letter from

Meese, said in a statement, "By decoupling
the library and museum from the center for
public affairs, as recommended by the Uni
versity, and by proposing a national center,
administratively independent from both the
Hoover Institution and the faculty gover
nance structure of the University, the White
House has offered a reasonable compro
mise."
Martin Anderson, a Hoover senior fellow
and former chief domestic policy adviser to
Reagan who drafted the original library pro
posal, told The Daily that even if the White
House and the University are unable to
reach a compromise on the policy center,
the White House would still allow the li
brary and the museum to come here.
Stanford officials, however, were cau
tious in their reactions, and refused to
characterize the letter as a breakthrough in
the negotiations, which have been at an im
passe due to disagreements between the
White House and the University over the
proposed policy center.
"It appears that the White House has
decided to proceed on the library, with an
included museum," University President
Donald Kennedy said from Colorado,
where he is vacationing and attending a
conference. "But the degree to which the
White House is willing to do so without the
center is not entirely clear to me from
hearing Mr. Meese's letter. I am sure the
Board of Trustees will consider it at their
next meeting Feb. 14."
The University and the White House have
been in agreement since October over the

library and the museum, but sharp differ
ences over governance of the proposed
policy center kept the two sides apart in
their negotiations.
The formal Stanford offer to the White
House, made by the Board of Trustees Dec.
13, welcomed the library and museum but
said any center for public affairs must come
under normal academic governance. Be
cause the White House had insisted that a
center run by the Hoover Institution be part
of any complex, the resolution was an im
plicit rejection of the White House plan.
Then, Meese said the Board offer was un
satisfactory to the President.
But in the Jan. 17 letter, he said the presi
dent "was pleased to learn that in their
resolution of 13 December 1983 the Stan
ford University Board of Trustees
welcomed the location of the Ronald
Reagan presidential library and museum at
the University, with the Hoover Institution
in charge of these two entities."
"We are very pleased that the (library and
museum) will be located on the Stanford
University campus, and we accept the offer
of the Board of Trustees in this regard," the
letter said.
The library and museum, once built,
would be operated by the General Services
Administration as part of the national ar
chives.
It was at the Dec. 7 meeting with Stanford
officials that the White House first suggest-


'We are very pleased that the
(library complex) will be
located on the Stanford
University campus/
- Edwin Meese 111, counselor
to the president


'It appears that the White
House has decided to
proceed on the library. . . .
But the degree to which the
White House is willing to do
so without the center is not
entirely clear to me/
- University President
Donald Kennedy
Ed that the policy center be run by a
private foundation as an
"independent national center" built
on land leased from Stanford.
In a lengthy statement last week,
reportedly drafted with the concur
rence of Kimball and other members
of the Board, Kennedy expressed
reservations regarding such an idea.
"A foundation to be created for a
presidential center . . . would be
formed for the purpose of maintain
ing such a center on behalf of a
public figure with a particular politi
cal philosophy.

"The more distinctive the philoso
phy, of course, the more interesting
the archives of an administration are
likely to be to scholars; but by the
same token, it becomes all the more
important for the University to
assure both the fact and the appear
ance of political neutrality — those
characteristics of academic excel
lence that the University's mode of
governance is designed to insure."
Meese said, "Such an indepen
dent entity, located on leased land,
would not require the administra
tive involvement of either the
Hoover Institution or other ele
ments of the University. We would
very much appreciate it if the Board
could review this one remaining

issue at its earliest possible conveni
ence."
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley, a leading faculty critic of the
Hoover Institution and opponent of
the Reagan complex, said that he is
"really pleased that the plans for the
expansion of the Hoover Institution
and its control of a policy center
seem to be dead."
But English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said he was "sad to hear" the news.
"I bet that sooner or later' Vy'll get
a policy center."
Anderson was enthusiastic about
the development, saying, "I think it
(the library and museum) will be
great ... a great academic resource
for Stanford."
The White House has apparently
abandoned its insistence that the University
accept a public policy center as an in
separable part of a Ronald Reagan presiden
tial library complex, a move that opens the
way for a Reagan library and museum to be
built here.
Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese,
writing to Board of Trustees President
William Kimball on behalf of President
Reagan, accepted Stanford's offer to locate
a presidential library and museum here
saying, "We are very pleased that the

Stanford University campus."
In the letter, dated Jan. 17 but received
and made public yesterday, Meese went on
to say that Reagan still believes that a public
policy center should be part of the com
plex, but now favors the idea of building an
"independent national center" as "a com
promise that might be acceptable to all par
ties concerned."
Whether the public affairs center remains
linked to the library was not entirely clear
from Meese's letter.
But Hoover Institution officials close to
the White House were adamant in saying
that the president has acceded to Stan
ford's request that the library, museum and
public policy center be "decoupled" —
