# Dorms to get cash for conservation
## 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
faking shorter showers and turning
lights off when leaving the room will now
turn a profit for residents of University
housing.
last week, the Housing Energy Conser
vation Center began a three-month mon
etary incentive program for conservation
within residences. All University
residences, with the exception of Escon
dido Village, will receive cash awards for
reducing their energy use from last year's
level.
The awards will be made to each
residence rather than to individuals.
The program continues until April 18
and includes spring break. The dates are
scheduled to coincide with University
meter reading dates. Program coordina
tors hope that the length of the program
will encourage the formation of energy
conservation habits .
Incentives will be given three ways:
— Large dorms, such as Wilbur, will
receive incentives if they reduce energy
consumption by 5 percent; and there will
be progressive awards for each
percentage point of reduction up to 20
percent.
— The Row and Cluster houses will
receive awards beginning at 7 percent re
duction and increasing to 20 percent re
duction.

— Governor's Corner residences will
receive incentives for energy reductions
from 5 to 15 percent.
The actual amount of the awards will
vary according to residence size and re
duction percentage. Savings will be
computed solely on a comparison of a
this year's residence's kilowatt-hours
per-day consumption with last year's con
sumption.

'We are hoping to foster an
attitude of conservation,
and not of competition/
- Kathy O'Connor, program
director

The exception is Governor's Corner,
where savings will be based upon data
from last November and December be
cause the new complex was not com
pleted a year ago.
Houses currently low in energy usage
will receive a proportionately larger in
centive than similarly constructed houses
high in energy usage in order to give all
residences an equal incentive for im
provement. This will reward houses

which have responded favorably to past
conservation programs and ac
knowledges that further reductions will be
increasingly difficult.
Kathy O'Connor, the coordinator of
the program, explains that this program is
intended to unite energy conservation
within residences and not to create inter
house competitions.
"We are hoping to foster an attitude of
conservation and not of competition,"
she said. "Unsafe practices, such as
candles in the halls, will not be accep
table and could result in a residence's in
eligibility for an award. A house could
also lose their incentives by hampering
another residence's chances
The HECC will work closely with all
residences to insure that each has the op
portunity to achieve a 10 percent reduc
tion in energy usage.
"A University-wide 10 percent reduc
tion would be outstanding," O'Connor
said."This should not be difficult if
everybody works together, especially
since this year has had milder weather."
The HECC will be distributing flyers in
White Plaza today at lunchtime to give
students more information about the pro
gram. The HECC also plans speakers,
posters and slide shows to promote con
servation, as well as a $6000 student fund
for conservation projects created by stu
dents.
