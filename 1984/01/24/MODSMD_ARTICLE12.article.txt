President Reagan apparently realized last
week that the Soviet Union is not the "focus of
all evil" in the world today.
In a speech before the foreign ministers
of NATO and Warsaw Pact countries in
Stockholm, Reagan refrained from describing
the Soviet Union as an "evil empire' as he has
done in the past. Instead, he called for a new
policy of credible deterrence, peaceful compe
tition and constructive cooperation with Mos
cow in order to establish a better working rela
tionship.
Many observers have hailed this speech as a
sign that Reagan wants a new policy of concilia
tion with the Soviets. But we don't buy it.
Reagan has shown he cannot deal con
structively with the Soviets. He has pursued
hostile policies with the Soviets for three years,
plunging U.S.-Soviet relations to their lowest
point since the Cold War. His speech can only
be seen as an election-year ploy to win the
hearts of Americans and Western Europeans
concerned about his dangerous moves.
U.S.-Soviets relations in every area, includ
ing arms control, trade and even cultural ex
changes, have been strained since Reagan took
office. It is true that Soviet actions have helped

worsen relations. The Soviets have invaded Af
ghanistan, imposed martial law in Poland and
downed a Korean jetliner. But the U.S. must
still be willing to continue working relations
with the Kremlin.
Reagan's arms control policies have been
particularly dangerous. U.S. miscalculations in
deploying cruise and Pershing 2 missiles in
Europe have led to a breakdown in the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces talks, while
arms control negotiations in many other areas
have also been terminated indefinitely. Mean
while, Reagan has pushed through a massive
military buildup causing an unprecedented es
calation of the arms race.
American troops are now involved in more
hostile parts of the world than any time in the
past 10 years. Combined with his hostile rheto
ric, Reagan's foreign policy moves have only
led us closer a confrontation between the su
perpowers.
Reagan has promised that he will soon pro
pose "practical and concrete measures" to
back up his new conciliatory stance toward the
Soviet Union. We remain skeptical. There is a
lot of damage that must be undone.
