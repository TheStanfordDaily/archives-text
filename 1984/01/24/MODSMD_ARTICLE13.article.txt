# One step closer

The White House's acceptance of the Uni
versity's offer to house a Ronald Reagan library
and inuseum on campus is a progressive step
that apparently brings Stanford closer to being
the home of Reagan's presidential papers.
But the White House has also proposed, as
part of the presidential complex package, an
independently administered policy center run
by a private national foundation. The presi
dent's apparent hope is that the University will
consider the offer an acceptable substitute for
the Hoover Institution-run center originally
proposed.
The University should look closely at just ex
actly what this independent center will mean.
The center would be administered by an as-yet
unformed "President Reagan Foundation."
Meese's "compromise" offer of an indepen
dent policy center on leased University land
might seem attractive, especially since the
refusal of such a proposal might mean that the
University will lose its chance to gain the li
brary. Meese's offer has left ambiguous the
question of whether the library is still linked to
the policy center.
The University has rejected the concept of a

policy center run by the Hoover Institution and
has proposed that such a center be placed
within the normal academic governance
structure of the University. While the White
House would probably still welcome a Hoover
administered policy center to be a part of the
presidential complex, Reagan and his staff rec
ognize that the University faces "severe inter
nal political problems" in accepting that pro
posal.
The University has previously objected to
Hoover governance of the center because it
does not want a policy center that would be
fundamentally partisan. But who can guarantee
that the "President Reagan Foundation" would
not be composed of — and administered by —
a partisan body? Couldn't this center become
the creation of a Hoover-like entity over which
the University has no control?
The Board of Trustees must now decide if it
can accept an "independent" policy center
and still maintain, as University President
Donald Kennedy has said, "both the fact and
the appearance of political neutrality."
We doubt that even this compromise can
preserve the non-partisan academic atmo
sphere of this university.
