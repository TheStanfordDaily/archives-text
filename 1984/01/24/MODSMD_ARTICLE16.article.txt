# Our Liberal institutions
## 
### 
Somewhere between L.A. and New York City there
lies, in America, that mythic town that represents the
true American Consciousness. It is an overroman
ticized and oversimplified town, but it is a town that
must be kept in mind when people get together to dis
cuss the "good of the country."
If one wants to get a taste of that distinctly American
mentality, he shouldn't seek it at one of America's
Great Universities. No, for there, the "liberal" factions
still rule, preparing what may be a last ditch stand
against the New Conservatism.
The times are changing a bit, to the chagrin of many a
1960s burnout. We look around, and we see a bustling,
though often naive, conservative (anti-liberal?) move
ment. It is a movement that has decided that intellec
tualism is not antithetical to common sense — a view
which our predecessors, in their fits of coffee-house
elitism, came to represent.
There are many reasons why our universities (and
our press to a large degree) have moved toward the
left in the period of our generation. They're there,
floating around — I just don't know which ones are
most important.
It isn't necessarily tragic that our universities have
become skewed toward the Left, but it is problematic.
Grenada is a good example. When the Marines landed,
those on our campus of a more moronic school of
thought were up the next morning, before most people
had a clue of what was going on, soliciting our
signatures for Washington-destined propaganda. Now
that the story is clearer to all of us, we can see that this
was a gross overreaction.
Vet our community's agreeable tolerance of these
Prophets of Empty Protest points to our tacit accep
tance of Left-of-center rhetoric. It is funny, but no one
seems to question the dangers that arise from the one
sided, patriot-baiting hot air that emanates from our
soapboxes to our most revered podiums. But let some
of our more conservative members reap the rewards of
great scholarship, and the "liberal" forces make an
envy-inspired call to arms.

I mean, it's great when we clap politely (and over
zealously, in the case of some zombie-ish persons) for
the likes of Bella Abzug, but it does make one wonder
when Caspar Weinberger thanks us for "only" pound
ing on the walls of Kresge while he spoke a few years
back. After all, conservatives of all types have to risk
their lives when daring college podiums.
Maybe stuff like this goes on because there is a mis
guided assumption that "liberals" are more
"moralistic" — or at least "humanistic" lhan con
servatives. After all, "liberals" seem to push for, say,
the welfare state, and isn't that the moral thing to do?
Of course it sounds good, but when "moral good" is
achieved by coercive and inefficient means, it separates
men by a wall that is intrusive government. A dog on a
leash won't run away, but he's not necessarily a loyal
dog. He's a dog on a leash.
The "liberals" are good people, and it's good that we
have them, because much of the progress that we have
seen in this country has come from the healthy com
promises between two opposing schools. But I am tired
of boneheads who don't seem to care at all that our
country is really great. I don't want to see them become
zealots or anything like that. But I would like for them
to take the devil's horns off Reagan and business and
democratic/capitalistic success in general.
I guess I should define what the "American Con
sciousness" was that I alluded to at the beginning of
this essay. But I don't think that I can. All I know is,
corny as it sounds, there is a whole lot of strength,
pride, freedom and good Christian (and all other religi
ous) values floating around in our heritage, and we
ought to keep that fact in mind. No, I'm not saying that
the "liberal" element around us doesn't believe that
this is true. But they overreact to American actions in
too-phobic a way. They have a right to speak. This is the
U.S. of A.
And if they don't love it, they can always leave it.
