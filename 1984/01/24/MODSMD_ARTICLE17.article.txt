Sailing along nicely
We appreciate The Daily's
front-page story (Jan. 20) on the
new sailing program facility at Red
wood City. We would like to clarify
two or three points: First, the total
dollar expenditure of monies from
our program development fund has
been in the neighborhood of
$10,000. Second, donations in kind
of materials and labor have boosted
the value of what has been accom
plished to a figure that approaches
$100,000. Third, we will continue to
improve the facility as long as we
have it and hope that we may some
day own the property, thereby
justifying even greater capital im
provement.
Finally, all this has been accom
plished with funds generated hy the
sailing program, not with money we
have had to ask the Athletic Depart
ment or University to furnish.

Thank you for your continued
interest in our program.

A slick idea
To justify the selling of leases for
offshore oil and gas exploration,
the Reagan administration has
stated that the California coastline
might yield 230 million barrels of oil
"to help the nation attain energy
independence." Since the nation
uses more than 15 million barrels of
oil per day, this quantity would last
about 15 days. If we must gamble
our California scenery, beaches,
fisheries and marine life for two
weeks of "independence/' what
additional treasures must we throw
in for a year's supply?

Frosting on Frost
Having read of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's decision to
relocate graduation ceremonies to
one of two athletic playing fields, I
must say I am immensely dis
pleased. President Kennedy has
presented the plan as extremely
sensible and has downplayed much
of the downside to such a reloca
tion. As Kennedy is the man who
will make the decision, regardless
of his smoke screen about the
Administrative Council and student
feedback, I take issue with his
underlying assumption that Frost is
not an alternative to be considered.
Over half of the student body
and over half of all graduating
classes since the beginning of Stan
ford University have graduated at
Frost. Graduating at Frost is a tradi
tion. Traditions help bind loosely
held organizations together; they

instill a sense of organizational
continuity, culture and develop
commonalities between individuals
who, because of their department,
residence or year of attendance,
might otherwise have little in com
mon. There are times when practi
cal considerations outweigh the
benefits of maintaining traditions —
they are sad times — and this is not
one of them.
Since Kennedy's appointment as
president, I have witnessed a regu
lar tendency to undervalue the
worth of traditions relative to small
practical improvements. I would
like to send a loud and clear
message to the president: I will
accept a shortage of tickets, over
crowding and the sunburnt faces of
my parents. I will accept safety
hazards that have yet to cause sig
nificant problems and any of the
other undesirable attributes of
Frost, if you allow me to join with

every student since the class of 1939
who has spent the last few minutes
of his life as an undergraduate in
the historical and aesthetically
pleasing setting of Frost Amphit
heatre. I do not think that I am
alone in making this trade-off be
tween the practical and the
aesthetic-traditional.

Sign on the diamond
Remarkable, isn't it, that on
Senior Pub Nights everyone is
there, but a forum for commence
ment sites arouses the interest of
only 65 seniors? I hate to accuse the
entire class of 1984 of apathy, but it
seems to be an inescapable conclu
sion. We are the ones who should
be deciding where commencement
will be (since Frost is clearly too
small and no longer considered),
yet without a strong showing of
interest we leave it in the lap of the
Administrative Council, which has
already indicated favoritism for the
Stadium site.
So what's wrong with the
Stadium? 1) It is simply too large —
it was used once before, in the
19305, and everyone agreed that it
was aesthetically unpleasing (empty
stadiums should be saved for the
USFL). 2) Seating will be on wooden
benches; while this may be fine for
students, parents and grandparents
will find it at least rather strenuous
and probably unthinkable. There
is limited access for the handi
capped, due to the stairs and in
clines.
Moreover, the proposed advan
tages of using the Stadium are
questionable. Granted, the
sightlines are better there — but
the existence of the departmental
ceremonies (which, after all, are
where the diplomas are given out)
outweighs the dubious distinction
of being sighted by your parents (if
they happen to be armed with
binoculars) while Donald Kennedy
gives his speech. I attended my
brother's graduation and it was

impossible to distinguish him
among the sea of black robes in
Frost, let alone in the vastness of
Stanford Stadium.
The second advantage, that of
better logistics (restrooms, drinking
fountains, etc.) is also true — but
they've managed to deal with it at
Frost for the past umpteen years.
Why is it suddenly a major disad
vantage for Sunken Diamond? The
University has demonstrated the
capacity to handle simple logistical
problems — the difference be
tween Frost and Sunken Diamond
in this regard is negligible.
And now, the overwhelming
choice of the students (at least, of
the 65 who bothered to show):
Sunken Diamond. Not only is it
clearly the favorite for aesthetic
reasons (it provides a more con
genial, intimate atmosphere, yet
can seat 20,000 and still have stand
ing room), it also provides better
access for the handicapped and the
elderly. A stage would be built near
home plate, with students seated in
the infield and the faculty in the
bleachers. Obviously, since Sunken
Diamond is flat, the possibility of
your parents spying you seated with
your friends, drinking the cham
pagne you smuggled in, is slight.
However, your parents will see you
in the departmental ceremonies.
Unfortunately, without active
student participation, We' 11 end up
in the Stadium by default. The
Administrative Council will not
listen unless they can be sure that
we represent a majority opinion.
But this doesn't have to happen!
Seniors, grad students, med stu
dents, law students, anyone and
everyone who will graduate in June
— please, clip this out, sign it, and
send it to President Kennedy. I
realize this takes time, effort and a
pair of scissors, but please do it.
And come to the forum tomorrow
night and speak out. Only
then will you be able to graduate at
the site of your choice.
