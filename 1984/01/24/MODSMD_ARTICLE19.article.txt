# Same old story as Card hoopsters lose – again

### MARK ZEIGLER 
Corvallis, Ore. — Stanford
didn't choke in its Pacific-10
Conference game last night
against Oregon State. Instead,
it simply ran out of time.
Oregon State ended a two
game losing streak before out
a sold-out Gill Coliseum
crowd of 10,000 by defeating
the Cardinal 73-68. One thing
it wasn't for the Beavers,
however, was easy.
Playing what Coach Tom
Davis called "our best game
yet," Stanford simply refused
to roll over and play dead to
the taller, quicker and more
talented Beavers ranked No.
11 nationally by the Associated
Press.
For virtually the entire
second half, Stanford —which

fell to 11-7 overall and 0-6 in
the Pac-10 — literally went toe
to-toe with Oregon State
which improved to 10-4 and 3-
2. But Stanford was equal to
the task, returning Oregon
State basket after basket to
stay in the game. The only
thing that put an end to the
Rocky Balboa-like comebacks
of the Cardinal was the final
buzzer.
"I think both teams needed
a win," Davis said after the
game, "and both teams played
as possibly hard as they could
have."
Hard, however, was a
synonym for rough play and,
in a word, the game was all
out war. A total of 59 fouls
were whistled on the two
teams and five players fouled

out, including Stanford's John
Revelli, Earl Koberlein and
Andy Fischer.
Exactly how rough was the
game? "It's kind of hard to an
swer that right now," said
Stanford guard Keith Jones
who finished with four fouls
and a team-high 19 points. "I'll
probably be able to tell in
about two hours when all the
bruises form. But it was easily
the most physical game of the
year."
Davis, who drew one tech
nical foul and came extremely
close to getting a few others,
refused to comment on what,
judging from his frequent
referee-directed fits, appeared
to be questionable officiating.
Stanford held its biggest
lead of the evening at 20-15

with 9:38 remaining in the first
half but behind fine all-around
shooting of center Steve
Woodside, who led all scorers
with a career-high 28 points,
Oregon State moved ahead
four minutes later and led 35-
33 at halftime.
The Cardinal tied it up at 41-
all with 14:40 to play but that
was as close as it got the rest
of the way. Woodside, who
completed dominated the
second half with 20 points,
went to work and scored five
of the next seven Beaver
points, putting Oregon State
in front 48-43 with 12:25 to go.
Oregon State tried
desperately to pull away from
the scrappy Cardinal but it was
to no avail, as Stanford kept
quieting the roaring Gill
Coliseum crowd with its
clutch baskets and free
throws.
The Beavers held their larg
est lead, 69-63, with 0:37 left
and even then it wasn't safe.
Stanford took the ball to the
other end and fed Hans Wic
hary, who scored, was fouled,
and hit the ensuing free
throw. Suddenly, the never
say-die Cardinal was within
three at 69-66.
However, Beaver forward
Charlie Sitton converted 3-of-4
free throws and Woodside
added one more to put the
game on ice for Oregon State
and keep its critical fans, espe
cially so after two straight
losses, at bay.
Stanford had no problem at
all against the taller Beavers,
outboarding them 33-28. The
Card also hit 56.1 percent of its
shots from the floor to the
Beavers' 49 percent. But both
those statistics in Stanford's
favor were neutralized by the
Card's 20 turnovers to the
Beavers' 11.
