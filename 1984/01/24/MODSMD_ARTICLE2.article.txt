Most people agree that the prob
lem of dealing with hazardous waste
is important. But most people don't
want a treatment plant in their
neighborhood.
That's the dilemma facing resi
dents of the Oak Creek Apartments,
the Searsville Block and Stanford's
newest student housing.
The planning for a new hazardous
waste treatment plant — called an
"Environmental Safety Facility" by
University administrators — has
been going on for a few years.
Protest to the proposal has come in
waves because of oscillating deci
sions over the particulars of the
facility and also because many of the
people who live near the site were
not aware of the planning of the
new center.
The protests started a few years
ago when residents of the Searsville
Block on the west side of campus
received letters from the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission in
forming them that Stanford was
building a temporary treatment
facility. This facility was to function
in the interim until a permanent one
could be fully planned.
When Searsville residents looked
at the proposal, they found that
there was no local representation on
the original committee to study the
problem of hazardous waste.
Alain Decleve, the University's
director of health and safety, said
excluding local residents from the
committee was an oversight. "It was
a mistake," he said, but added that
residents were kept informed and
involved through the rest of the
process both for the temporary
facility and the permanent one still
in the planning stages.
"At first they tried to sneak it (the
temporary facility) in until we blew it
open," said Searsville resident Rich
ard LaPiere, an emeritus sociology
professor.
For a variety of reasons, the vast
majority of the residents of the Oak
Creek Apartments — 1000 feet from

the proposed site — and Governor's
Corner — about 1600 feet from the
site — knew nothing of the pro
posed facility until contacted by The
Daily.
"No one I know of was officially
notified of the plans,'' said )an Van-
Houten, director of Governor's Cor
ner. Van Houten said that Norm
Robinson, associate dean of Resi
dential Education, may have been
notified but that he "didn't tell any
of us."
Robinson said that Res Ed didn't
tell students about the facility even
though his office knew about the
project for quite a while. "There was
so much publicity that anyone with
any great concern would have
known about it through The Daily
and Campus Report," he explained.
"No matter where it was, they (the
planners) were sure it would be to
tally safe."
Michael Hoffer, a resident assis
tant in Sterling Quad, said he had
never heard of the plans until he
was contacted by The Daily. "Even if
the University just didn't publicize it
I'd say that they haven't been totally
on the up and up," Hoffer said.
"Even a toxic waste center on the
other side of campus would concern
me."
Hoffer said that the University
"should have had an open forum or
something" so that people wouldn't
feel that the University has tried to
hide something.
In fact, the Faculty Task force on
Hazardous Waste Management
which met from Dec. 16, 1982, until
April 26, 1983, recommended in its
final letter that, "In order to ade
quately address all the issues in
volved, an open meeting for the
University community by the admin
istration is strongly urged to discuss
and in turn to receive comments on
plans for the centralization of both
the administration of, and facilities
for, handling and disposing of hazar
dous wastes."
A meeting was held for residents
of the Searsville Block, but not for
other residents in the area who
might be affected by the plant.
The 759 families who live in the
Oak Creek Apartments are almost
exactly the same distance from the
new site as the Searsville Block resi
dents. Andy Doty, director of com
