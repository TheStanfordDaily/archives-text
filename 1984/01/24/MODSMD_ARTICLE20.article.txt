From The Washington Post
Tampa, Fla. — Tom Flores didn't have to
wait until he broke down the films to explain
this sweet, sweet victory.
Even from his sideline view, Flores could
recognize near-perfection. His Los Angeles
Raiders had talked a good fight all week,
then played even better in Super Bowl XVIII
Sunday.
"We've been very, very good in the
playoffs," said Flores, whose vision of the
Raiders' stunning 38-9 victory over Washing
ton had not been clouded by only two hours
of sleep.
"We just peaked at the right time ... I
knew we had to play an outstanding game to
beat them because they are a very good
football team.
"We were just better. We dominated and
didn't even make it close. I've never seen a
Raider team play any better."
Neither had owner Al Davis. He called this
the greatest Raider team of all time. Then he

went further: "I think it ranks with the great
teams of all time to have ever played any
professional sport."
Time will give a better measure of this
squad's place in history. But for one
electrifying afternoon, the Raiders showed
what a well-prepared, immensely talented
team can accomplish when everything is
going just right.
The Raiders had been saying all week that
the Redskins were just the kind of team they
like playing best: physical, macho and, yes,
predictable.
The Raiders had been saying all week to
forget October's 37-35 loss to Washington
because two players of all-pro caliber, run
ning back Marcus Allen and cornerback
Mike Haynes, didn't play.
And they had been saying something else:
They readily announced their game plan be
cause no matter who the opponent, the
Raiders usually don't vary their routine.
