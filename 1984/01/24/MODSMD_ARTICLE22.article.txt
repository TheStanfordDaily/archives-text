# Stanford spikers coast to easy victory over Davis

### SARAH CARREL 
The Stanford men's volley
ball team played one easy and
two hard-fought games in
defeating UC-Davis last night,
15-3, 15-12, 15-11, at home in
Maples Pavilion.
"We were always in con
trol," said assistant coach Don
Shaw. "But we have to learn
how to not let off. It's natural
to let off after winning the first
game."
The Cardinal cruised by its
troubled opponents in game
one with few mistakes. Davis
mishandled the ball several
times. But by the second game
the Aggies were warmed up
and forced Stanford to work
hard. Head Coach Fred Sturm
then made some major
changes in the line-up, replac
ing most of the starters.
UC-Davis pulled ahead for
the first time, 6-5, and hung
onto that lead until Stanford
fought back at 10-10, going on
to take the game. In game
three, the Aggies jumped to
an early lead, which thev held
for most of the contest. Ihe
feisty Card regained the ad
vantage at 11-11, capitalizing
on some Aggie mistakes and
its own intelligent play. As a
result, the men in red picked
up the match in three games.
Playing particularly well for
Stanford was junior Craig
Lauchner, who led the team
with 12 kills. But Lauchner at
tributed the success to the
team effort.
"Every match we seem to
pull together and play as a
team a bit more efficiently,"
said the setter and team co
captain. "All we need is expe
rience, and after a weekend of
intense volleyball next
weekend things should really
click together."
This weekend the Card
travels to the UC-Santa Bar
bara Collegiate Tournament to
face such formidable oppo
nents as Manitoba, the team
ranked as No. 1 in Canada.
The experience gained at
the UCSB tournament will be
valuable when Stanford takes
on top-ranked Pepperdine
and UCLA in the following
weeks.
"We are young, but we are
better than we have ever
been," said Shaw of his fifth
ranked Cardinal. "Our suc
cess is pretty much team
oriented."
