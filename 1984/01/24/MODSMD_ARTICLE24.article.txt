# The 						Clash revitalize image

### PATRICK McCRYSTLE 
It must have come as a surprise to most
when they heard that the Clash would be
playing in San Francisco on |an. 21. Usual
ly a tour coincides with the release of an
album, but this show came at a time when
the Clash's status was obscured by the
strange ejection of guitarist-vocalist Mick
lones by group leader Joe Strummer.
While the Clash's popularity has increased
since their 1982 release of Combat Rock,
many of their long-time fans felt betrayed
by the band's alleged "sell out." To those
people, Saturday night's show was a
treat, a throwback to the old days of Rude
Boy and White Riot.
The packed Civic Center had suffered
through Los Lobos, who resembled Dis
neyland's Bear Country Jamboree and ex
hibited as much originality as the movie,
Jaws 3-D. The crowd was restless and
wary of the next act, Malcolm McClaren,
but he brought them back to life by as
sembling a troupe of high school pop and
break dancers from the crowd and sen
ding them through spins and backsliding,
to the tune of his new release, "Buffalo
Gal."
For those who entered the popular cul
ture during the Flashdance/Combat Rock
craze, it would probably have been
enough to hear "Should I Stay or Should I
Go?" and then leave.
But for the audience who could trace
their allegiance back to the old days, the

show was just beginning. From the
opening chords of "London Calling" to
the ending chords of "lanie lones" 23
songs later, the Clash performed with the
intensity that is their trademark. New
members Nick Sheppard (guitar), Vince
White (guitar) and Pete Howard (drums)
filled in ably and allowed originals Paul
Simonon (bass) and |oe Strummer
(vocals/guitar hammerer) to exist in per
petual motion.
The group played primarily songs from
their first three albums. They kept it musi
cally simple and upbeat. The five meshed
very well, especially on "Rock the Cas
bah," "Police and Thieves," and
"Spanish Bombs." They plaved tour new
songs that were excellent, but will prob
ably be received with less fanfare than
"Combat Rock," since they harken back
to older, more guitar-oriented days.
I had wondered how the new band
would sound, and if the Clash would
remain an upfront, hard-hitting socio
political entity. They are definitely still in
that category, although there's been
change. While their intensity level was
still too high to register on any meter,
their doomsday approach and war atti
tude has lightened. It was as if Strummer
realized that he could reach more people
during a performance if his attitude took
a turn for the calmer. At many times
during the concert, he was outright
humorous with his fans.

While Strummer may have lightened,
he has not lost his passion or his beliefs.
Controversial as always, he attacked
everything he felt was wrong, including
racism, Reagan, male-dominated society
and apathy. He himself was the antithesis
of anything apathetic, both mentally and
physically.
With mouth and body in constant mo
tion, Strummer danced on the bass drum,
ran into the pit between his audience and
his stage, and spent a good deal of the
time writhing in mock pain on the floor.
He constantly battered the crowd with
remarks like, "This next song is about
Ronald Reagan's favorite hobby, or
smashing Central America to fuck." His
lead-in to "Police and Thieves" ended
with "We can't continue to patronize the
black culture for everything we got. There
must be two cultures coming together. I
mean you, Sting."
He accused our society of being male
oriented (rightly so) and said one of the
new songs ("Sex Mad World") was about
the victims of our infatuation with sex,
"i.e., the women, the women. You don't
ever think about them. Things go too fast
in a sex-crazed world." He ended the first
set with "White Riot," but first he en
gaged in a long soliloquy which con
cluded with "I must have some culture. It
sure ain t Shakespeare, and sure ain't
fuckin' Van Halen. Well, mavbe I'll find it
in 'White Riot.' "
The stage itself was framed in drapes
that looked like crumbling cement and
ringed in by huge red-iron grates and
panels. The drums were up on an urban
staircase and stood out against a back
drop of a black-and-white stripes and
banks of TV sets playing "The Road War
rior." The crowd nearly shook down the
set-up during "Clash City Rockers" and
"I Fought the Law," while Strummer him
self attempted to mutilate them during
"Tommy Gun" and "Sate European
Home."
Strummer looked fit, and exuded his
same urgency, but this time touched with
some fun. He was adorned in overalls let
loose at the waist and a red dress jacket.
His hair was short and dyed orange. The
rest of the band wore the usual sleeveless
black and/or combat articles that have
come to signify The Clash, but somehow,
despite all their movement, they seemed
invisible next to Strummer's om
nipotence.
Definitely, the concert was a forum for
Strummer to preach. The difference be
tween this concert and past ones in which
he had done the same thing was that he
added hope. I have seen the Clash five
times, and while I thoroughly enjoyed
every one, many of my friends felt that
the Clash looked and played like they
were waiting for an imminent war. This
concert could not be accused of leaving
the same feeling. For that reason, I think
The Clash will go on. And their new al
bum will be excellent, judging by the new
material and the attitude of this show. All
in all, it was an evening of fun and fulfill
ment, and as always left me with the vi
sion of Strummer standing center stage,
left leg pumping to the beat, eyes shut,
and mind imploring us to make some
change.
