# Raving Tonight
## Don Carlos and Gold 
### 
RAS Records
RAS Records out ot Washington, D.C., put
together this album of music from Don
Carlos late last year, taking the best from
two earlier albums and adding two new
songs to create an enjoyable anthology.
Carlos, from the Waterhouse ghetto of
Kingston, Jamaica, was one of the founders
of Black Uhuru and has since gone on to a
successful solo career. Natty Dread Creden
tial was voted top reggae album of 1982, es
tablishing him as one of reggae's top
vocalists.
Two of the tracks on this LP, "Jah, |ah,
Hear My Plea" and "Prophecy," are pre
sented in their original forms with the in
strumental dub version; the two new tracks
"Spread Out and "Black History" feature
the High Times Players, and two other songs
"White Squal" and "In Pieces" feature Sly


Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, probably
the best-known rhythm section in reggae
today. The style is lyrical and accessible, the
music is soothing and Don Carlos should do
well with his future releases on RAS records.
