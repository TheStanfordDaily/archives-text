# No Parlez—Paul Young
## 
### 
Columbia Records
Speaking of well-dressed young men, Paul
Young, a handsome, honest, hardworking
lad from England had made a record called
No Parlez and since spring 1983 it has been
hogging the top of the United Kingdom's
charts. Not surprising really. Paul Young,
formerly of the Q-Tips, has assembled a su
perb collection of songs written mostly by
other songwriters, applied his excellent
voice, the voice of his female vocal group,
The Fabulous Wealthy Tarts, and a snappy
back-up group to produce an album that
may well be the next British export to attack
the carcass of the United States' top 40. The
album is full of catchy, well-sung
pop/rock/soul. The standout is a cover of
Marvin Gaye's "Whereto- I [ ay My Hat." Joy
Division's "Love Wii; fear Us Apart," is
given a surprisinglv fresh treatment (now I
can understand the words) and songs such
as "Sex," "Iron Out The Rough Spots,"
"Come Back and Stay," "Love of the Com
mon People" and "Tender Trap" are some


of the most infectious pop you'll hear in
1984. Every song sounds just right with
Young's full, yet sensitive vocal treating the
tunes with respect. A great record, get it
before "rock of the '80s" makes you despise
it.
