Red Flame, U.K. Import
A woman by the name of Carmel is cur
rently wowing most of the undercover
trendies in England with her distinct brand
of night music. Carmel, her debut EP,
showcases six songs which give the listener
an idea of the pure talent this performer has.
With a voice that can croon, boom, scratch,

(cover not available)

and caress. Carmel could sing the Datsun
commercial and make it sound passionate
and meaningful. When she gets her hands
on "The Tracks of My Tears," "Storm,"
"Guilty" and "Love Affair" she is dynamite.
Racked with an acoustic base and various
percussion she and her band conjure up
vivid of beauty, pain and disequi
librium. She recently had a top-20 hit in the
United Kingdom with "Bad Day" (not on
this EP) so the bet is that soon she'll be test
marketed inthis country; be sure not to miss
out.
