Meese nomination blasted
Washington — President Reagan said yesterday
that he will nominate Edwin Meese 111, his White
House counselor, to he attorney general, and the
nomination immediately came under attack by Dem
ocratic presidential contenders and Democratic
leaders on Capitol Hill.
Reagan praised Meese as "a person whose life and
experience reflect a profound commitment to the
law and consistent dedication to the improvement
of our justice system."
Meese, 52, a longtime confidant of the president,
told reporters in Montecito, Calif., a suburb of Santa
Barbara, where he was making a speech on national
security, that he does not consider himself contro
versial.

He defended his views on civil rights as reflecting
"mainstream" American thinking and said he ex
pects to follow the policies established at the De
partment of Justice by Attorney General William
French Smith, his predecessor.
The president also accepted "with deepest ap
preciation and regret" the resignation of Smith,
which will be effective upon Me. s confirmation
by the Senate. Smith said that he will return to his
private law practice but will be active in Reagan's re
election campaign.
Court: no death row reviews
Washington — The Supreme Court ruled yesterday
that death-row inmates are not entitled to a special
appeals court review to ensure that they are not
being treated more harshly than others convicted of
similar crimes.
The court, in a 7-2 decision, rejected the conten
tion that such "proportionality reviews" are neces
sary to prevent discriminatory or arbitrary application
of capital punishment laws. Safeguards already
mandated by the court and implemented by the
states are sufficient, Justice Byron White wrote for
the majority.
"Any capital sentencing scheme may occasionally
produce aberrational outcomes," White said.
" ...As we have acknowledged in the past, 'there can
be no perfect procedure' " for imposing death sen
tences, he said.
Dissenting Justice William Brennan Jr., joined by
Justice Thurgood Marshall, said the court is
"deluding itself, and also the American public,
when it insists that those defendants who have
already been executed or are today condemned to
death have been selected on a basis that is neither
arbitrary nor capricious, under any meaningful defi
nition of those terms."
The ruling, the most significant capital
punishment decision expected this term, eliminated
another potential obstacle to executions in several
states and underscored the court's determination to
let executions go forward.
Anti-abortion forces protest
Washington — About 35,000 demonstrators
marched on Capitol Hill and the Supreme Court yes
terday vowing to escalate their battle against the
1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion
and against the proposed equal rights amendment.
Waving signs such as "Abortion: The Silent
Holocaust" and "Planned Parenthood Murder,
Inc.," the "March for Life" demonstrators, a spirited
group that included many students from parochial
and private schools, chanted, "No ERA, No ERA."
The march was led by a dozen coffins symbolizing
the estimated 15 million legal abortions performed
in the country since the court's ruling 11 years ago
on Jan. 22.
60 killed in Morocco riots
Rabat, Morocco — At least 60 people were killed in
riots against planned food price hikes in Morocco,
diplomatic sources said yesterday, prompting King

Hassan II to cancel the measures.
The government made no announcement on
casualties. But diplomatic sources, who requested
anonymity, said the death toll from disorders last
week included 20 dead in Tetouan, 20 in Nador, 15 in
Al Hoceimas and three in Fez, all northern cities on
the Mediterranean coast.
They said two demonstrators were killed during
student demonstrations in Marrakesh in central
Morocco.
Spanish press reports that as many as 200 were
killed on the coast, a former Spanish colony, were
"greatly exaggerated," they said.
But by yesterday calm was reported throughout
the country.
Report on arms violations
Washington — President Reagan formally sent a
report to Congress yesterday accusing the Soviet
Union of arms-control violations that, he said, in
crease doubts "about the reliability of the USSR as a
negotiating partner, and thus damages the chances
for establishing a more constructive U.S.-Soviet rela
tionship."
The report says the Soviets "have not been willing
to meet our basic concerns" about these issues
when raised in diplomatic channels and special com
missions. In a covering letter, Reagan says"it is fun
damentally important that the Soviets take a con
structive attitude toward compliance" if future prog
ress in arms control is to be made.
