# 'Big Man' Clemons rescues soul with poise, vigor
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Who's built like a defensive lineman,
stands about 6-foot-5, wears snazzy hats
and blows the meanest sax in America's
premiere live attraction? If you haven't
said "The Big Man," already, then you
may as well not even go on reading this
article. But have you ever heard of Bruce
Springsteen? Okay, you do recall
hearing about a rock star of such a name
who your old roommate from New Jer
sey used to rave about. And yeah,
doesn't he have a big black saxophone
player, you say? Yes, uninitiates, this sax
player is "The Big Man," whose real
name is Clarence Clemons.
Clemons is the excitement and focal
point of the E Street Band, Springsteen's
back-up band, and is the finest
saxophone player presently playing in
the rock-and-soul mode. His saxophone
playing is renowned on such
Springsteen songs as "Jungleland,"
"Rosalita" and "Thunder Road," and he
has proven himself to be a humorous,
stamina-filled, hard-driving performer in
concert, as well.
In addition to his duties as an E Street

Band member, though, Clemons has
recently sought out a solo career
whereby he can explore more fully his
musical talents into soul and rhythm
and-blues styles. He has done quite a
few club tours over the past two years
with a group of New jersey veterans who
call themselves the Red Band Rockers.
These live performances of Clemons and
the Red Band Rockers have been inspir
ing affairs that have matched the inten
sity and quality of the finest rock-soul
performers. These concerts hark the lis
tener back to an era when Otis Redding,
James Brown, Sam and Dave, Ike and
Tina Turner, and Wilson Pickett were in
their heydays, wooing multi-racial
audiences in sleazy ghetto theaters
during the mid to late '60s.
Rescue, though, is the name of the
debut studio record of Clemons and the
Red Bank Rockers. It is a hard, soulful al
bum that is a must for partying, dancing
and having a good time. Rescue, is, in
fact, a "rescue" for the listener in two
respects. In the album's uplifting charac
ter, the listener is instantly "rescued"
from any of life's worries and is put into

a relaxed, party mood. The other level,
though, in which this album is a
"rescue", is that the album makes the
listener enjoy soul and R & B to such an
extent that it may cause him or her, the
listener, to hunt down some old 1960s
soul albums. This is, therefore, a
"rescue" for soul music, in general,
which has been in a drastic decline since
the early '70s. Rescue brings back the
glory of soul and is a fine album to intro
duce any Springsteen fan (or any fan, for
that matter) to what soul music is all
about.
For the most part, Rescue is an up
tempo, rollicking album made up of
mostly new and original soul tunes writ
ten by Clemons and the various
musicians and personnel who have con
tributed to the album. There also are two
more obscure and older soul numbers
which fit the sound of the band perfect
ly-
With Clemons' sax blowing clean and
strong, the Red Bank Rockers prove to
be a formidable soul band in their own
right. Led by the gritty, rough vocals of
John "J.T." Bowen (who could pass for a

Wilson Pickett sound-alike) and the
Memphis-style drumming of Wells Kelly,
the band fully captures the emotional
depth of the best of soul music. This can
be best heard on "A Woman's Got The
Power," "Money To The Rescue" and
"Heartache 99," which are powerful,
gutsy soul tunes that sound as if they
came straight out of Stax's (one of the
'60s major soul labels located in
Memphis) classic vaults. On all of the
above songs, especially Clemons' sax
work is beautiful in timing, poise and
vigor.
However, the band just doesn't copy
the sounds and mannerism of old soul
performers. They experiment a bit and
try to inject their own distinct brand of
humor as well. On "Jump Start My
Heart," and "Rock and Roll D.J.," the
band strives for a heavy rock and soul
combination which is somewhat remi
niscent of Bob Seger's more soul
derived numbers like "Old Time Rock
and Roll." "Jump Start My Heart," in
fact, sounds very reminiscent of a song
by Ike and Tina Turner, called "Nutbush

City Limits," which Seger used to open
up his shows with.
The finest performance on the record,
though, is on Springsteen's song,
"Savin' Up." It is a Memphis-styled
shuffle number which starts out as a
light, slow tempo groove and then
gradually picks up into a moving, hiting
shouter. The guitar work, supplied by
Springsteen, is slinky and sexy in all the
right places, while the organ fills are
reminiscent of Booker T. Jones'
keyboard work found on the majority of
Stax's classic songs. The sax is emotion
ally packed which complements
Bowen's forceful singing to the utmost.
It is the highlight of the album, and a
song that makes you wish Springsteen
would write these rock/soul derived
numbers for himself.
However, this is Clarence Clemons
and his Red Bank Rockers' own album.
The band succeeds in its mission of
rescuing soul music from its decay and
instill it with new energy and blood. This
could just be a re-birth of soul on a small
scale. Let's hope so. Blow, Big Man,
Blow!
