# Remake of 'To Be' even louder, less funny
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Ernst Lubitsch made To Be
or Not to Be in 1942, and
among the brash, sloppy, jin
goistic American movies of
(hat era its aggressive taste
lossness must not have
cmed unusual or untoward.
What is more surprising is that
it has, in the intervening years,
acquired the status of a classic
comedy.
Perhap too can be ex
plained: It's such an eccentric
project — an anti-Nazi send
up starring lack Benny and
Carole Lombard as the heads
of a Shakespearean troupe in
Poland — that it draws atten
tion to itself, especially in
terms of Ernst Lubitsch's
career. (Lubitsch was famous
for his light, dry hand and the
synthetic elegance of his
comedies, but To Be or Not to
Be is a pushy, clumsy mess.)
Besides, it was Lombard's last
picture — she died in a plane
crash later that year — so even
though she's nowhere near
her best in it, her performance
has an inescapable nostalgic
appeal.
Having no affection for the
original, I wasn't wary of how
the remake would compare to
it. But where movies are con
cerned, you should always be
prepared for the one even
tuality you couldn't have an
ticipated, and the new direc
tor (Alan lohnson) and the
new screenwriters (Thomas

Meehan and Ronny Graham)
have done the one thing I
would never have guessed —
remained faithful to Lubitsch.
The first movie was loud and
unfunny; the remake is even
louder and less funny, with an
even more strident confusion
of tones.
The only significant change
is the addition of a
homosexual character —
Sasha (James Haake), personal
dresser to Anna Bronski (Anne
Bancroft, in the Lombard part)
— whom the Nazis want to
send to a concentration camp
as an undesirable. The treat
ment of Sasha provides the
clearest example of the film's
baseness: Haacke makes him
the grossest gay caricature in
movies in decades, yet the
script keeps telling us to be
moved by his plight.
To Be or Not to Be stars Mel
Brooks, in the Jack Benny role
(Frederick Bronski), but it's
not a Mel Brooks movie — he
didn't have a hand in the di
rection (which is slickly
anonymous) or the writing,
though he's intermittently
very funny. He's at his most
buoyant in the opening num
ber with Anne Bancroft, a
Polish version of "Sweet
Georgia Brown" which, dis
mayingly, turns out to be the
best sequence in the movie,
and in the scene that gives the
film its name.
Playing a truncated edition

of Hamlet, Bronski enters in a
preposterous blond wig and
embarks on the soliloquy;
before he has reached the
second line, a handsome
young flier in the audience
(Tim Matheson) rushes out of
the theater, and Bronski, un
nerved by this behavior, ex
presses his anger and frustra
tion in the way he recites the
next part of the speech. (He
directs the words at the flier as
if he were delivering an indig

nant lecture.) Unfortunately,
this idea becomes a running
gag, and it's only funny the
first time.
Brooks has a severely lim
ited range, but the role of
Bronski lies safely within it.
On the other hand, Anne
Bancroft, who is both an adept
comedienne and a gifted dra
matic actress, seems com
pletely wrong here — she
mugs so broadly and uncom
fortably that you'd think she

had never played comedy
before in her life. Every male
in the film trips all over him
self trying to impress Anna,
but I've never seen Anne
Bancroft look less attractive;
she's actually frowsy in some
scenes, though that may be
more obvious because her act
ing is so ringingly off course.
Luckily, in the second half
of the picture Charles Durning
shows up as a Nazi colonel
and redeems even a few

scenes with Bancroft. This is
the first time Durning has
played revue sketch comedy
in a movie, and he proves him
self an unerringly deft clown.
He acts everyone else off the
screen — just as he did in The
Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas a year and a half ago,
when his "Sidestep"
vaudeville number slyly stole
the movie away from some of
the most outrageous camera
hogs in the business.

My least favorite part of To
Be or Not to Be is the end,
when the cast takes curtain
calls. No doubt the theatrical
reference was intended to be
endearing, but all I kept think
ing of was the gall of the
filmmakers to force an
applause-milking finale on us
after such a dreadful picture.
For the first time in my
movie-going life, I longed to
get my hand around a rotten
egg-
