Following is the text of a lan. 7 7 letter from
Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese 111 to William
Kimball, president of the Stanford Board of Trustees:
The President was pleased to learn that in their
resolution of Dec. 13, 1983 Stanford University
Board of Trustees welcomed the location of the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum at
the University, with the Hoover Institution in charge
of these two entities. Both the President and Mrs.
Reagan believe that these archival resources should
be located in California and that Stanford is particu
larly appropriate in view of President Reagan's long
association with Hoover Institution and the fact that
his gubernatorial papers, as well as all the papers
from his presidential campaigns and the transition,
are already on deposit there. The presidential
papers, combined with the earlier papers, should
provide a unique and comprehensive record for
scholars in a variety of fields.
We are very pleased that the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library and Museum will be located on
the Stanford University campus, and we accept the
offer of the Board of Trustees in this regard. Con
cerning the proposed location, the ideal one from
our viewpoint would be adjacent to the National
Bureau of Economic Research and the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. We under
stand that this site has already been suggested by
the University's planning officials. We look forward
to receiving the detailed proposal prepared by the
Hoover Institution in cooperation with the appropri
ate Universitv officials, and to the opportunity to

review it with regard to its mutual acceptability.
The President still believes that a national center
for furthering the advanced study of public policy,
under the auspices of the Hoover Institution, should
be a part of the presidential library complex. We rec
ognize, however, that the University has some se
vere internal political problems concerning the pro
posed center for public affairs. On the other hand,
the University's proposal of a center for public af
fairs primarily directed toward assisting departmen
tal research institutes and teaching programs is not
in accordance with the overall purpose of the com
plex as we have understood it since the Director of
the Hoover Institution (extended) the invitation to
locate the presidential library complex on the Stan
ford campus in early 1981.
We hope that the idea we discussed together at
our meeting on Dec. 7, 1983 of an independent na
tional center, like the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences and the National Bureau of
Economic Research, would be a compromise that
might be acceptable to all parties concerned. Such
an independent entity, located on leased land,
would not require the administrative involvement of
either the Hoover Institution or other elements of
the University. We would very much appreciate it if
the Board could review this one remaining issue at
its earlier possible convenience.
I look forward to hearing from you on this matter.
