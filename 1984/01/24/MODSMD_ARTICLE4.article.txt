# Students to protest minority policies
## 
### MARY SMATHERS 
Students from the Bilingual Edu
cation and Second Language In
struction programs are planning to
protest what they see as the School
of Education's lack of commitment
to the two programs in a demonstra
tion in front of Cubberley tomorrow
at noon.
Pedro Castenada, an organizer of
the event and a student in the Bilin
gual Education Program, said stu
dents will gather to "make the
campus aware" of the lack of sup
port for the Bilingual Education and
Second Language Instruction pro
grams and the School's poor affirm
ative action practices for faculty and
students.
Because the Bilingual Education
and Second Language Instruction
programs attract many minority stu
dents, "doing away with the pro
gram is doing away with
minorities," Castenada said.
The future of affirmative action
and bilingual instruction programs
at the School of Education continues
to be in question since the Novem

ber departure of Associate Dean Ar
turo Pacheco, who resigned be
cause of the school's poor affirma
tive action record.
Castenada said the students will
ask that Pacheco be replaced and
that Applied Linguistics Prof. Robert
Politzer, who had directed both
second language programs before
j e became ill this summer, be
replaced by two faculty members.
At the protest, the students will
for the first time publicly state their
recommendations, which they pre
sented in a letter to School of Educa
tion Dean Myron Atkin Friday.
In response to the announcement
of the protest, Atkin said, "we have
devised a plan to attack these prob
lems which we will present in a
meeting with the students." The
meeting is scheduled for this after
noon.
Upon hearing of the meeting with
the dean, Castenada said the protest
will still be held tomorrow because
"they will probably just propose
that Pacheco and Politzer be
replaced by one minority linguist."

The students are concerned, Cas
tenada said, that Atkin will combine
the Pacheco and Politzer billets and
replace both professors with one
new faculty member. The bilingual
programs were understaffed even
when both were at the School of
Education and Politzer was advising
at least 60 graduate students, Cas
tenada said.
The understaffing has forced stu
dents to look outside the School of
Education for advisers and disserta
tion committee members.
Asst. Linguistics Prof, john Rick
ford wrote a letter Jan. 12 express
ing his support for a strong bilingual
program, citing the fact that he cur
rently serves on three times as many
dissertation committees for Educa
tion School students than for Lin
guistic Department students.
"The strain on faculty members in
other schools and departments on
campus is fast approaching the
breaking point," he wrote.
Rickford recommended that if
Politzer does not return to Stanford
his position should be filled by two

faculty members. "The need obvi
ously exists," he wrote.
The protesting students are asking
other faculty members to support
their positions on the issue by
writing letters to Atkin.
