# Modernization of Hospital to begin
## Directors approve remodeling plan 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
The first major remodeling of the Stanford University
Hospital since its opening in 1959 was approved last
week by the Board of Hospital Directors, according to
project director Elvia Garwood.
The $110 million plan now will go before the Univer
sity's Board of Trustees, where Garwood said it stands
a 99.9 percent chance of approval.''
Dan Heath, associate director of Medical Center
finance, said funding for the project will come from
three sources. Heath said $72.5 million will be raised
through the sale of tax exempt bonds, $29.1 million will
be taken from the hospital's reserve funds and an addi
tional $8.4 million will be raised from private gifts.

According to Vice-President for Medical Affairs
Lawrence Crowley, the main goal of the plan is to
"modernize an outdated hospital for modern care."
Garwood said the first stage of the project is to com
plete construction on a modernization project at the
north end of the hospital which was halted in 1976. That
project, an addition to the hospital designed to handle
in-patient care, was under construction when Califor
nia building laws changed. Funds allocated for the
completion of the project were exhausted in modifying
that portion of the building already under construction.
The second stage of the new project includes the
construction of a new four-story building which will
house diagnostic and treatment
facilities as well as nursing units,
Garwood said. One of the features
of the building will be 20 new oper
ating rooms equipped for modern
medical technology.
Garwood said that there was "no
way to modify" the 14 existing oper
ating rooms to handle the
"drastically different" medical
equipment of the 1980s. Those
rooms will be converted for other
unspecified purposes, she said.
The building will also contain the
headquarters for a new material
management system, which will
handle the inventory and distribu
tion of incoming supplies to the
hospital, she said.
Construction on the new building
is tentatively scheduled to begin this
summer. Completion is set for
March 1987.
The final phase of the project calls
for an "across the board" moder

nization of the existing structure to
create a "balance of excellence"
among the hospital's 44 depart
ments, Garwood said.
The Morse-Diesel firm will serve
as construction manager of the Droi
ect, she said, handling submissions
of bids for the new facilities.
Plans for modernization have
been underway since 1980.
