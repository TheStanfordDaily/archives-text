# Students learn to live with cardiopulmonary resuscitation

Taking to heart the Roy Scout "be
|>r pared" motto, students here are signing
up in ret ord numbers this year to learn how
to save lives through a new residence
ased basic life support training program,
mphasizing cardiopulmonary resuscita
tion (CPR) training.
I he CPR technique combines artificial
respiration with chest compressions to circ
l.itt and provide oxygen for the blood of
lie incapacitated victim.
Studies show that applying CPR immedi
leiy to a victim can double the survival rate
itter ventricular fibrillation, while lessening
he degree ot brain damage.
Cardiac arrest kills more than 325,000
Americans each year before they ever make
it to the hospital. Although emergency
treatments and highly-trained health
workers in a hospital can maximize a heart
ittack victim's chances of survival, if the pa
tient is dead or irretrievably brain-damaged
>efore even arriving, the hospital's facilities
ire useless.
The premise of the training program is
that more lives could be saved if people in
the general community, especially those
.vho work or live with people known to be
it risk, were trained in life-support tech
niques.
The idea of training people not expert in
medical care to "saturate the population''
with citizens able to keep cardiac arrest vic
tims alive is a new one, but worked well in
other communities, drastically reducing the
number of "dead on arrival" heart attack
victims.
Richard Knight, a CPR instructor on
campus, describes the response of students
to the course as "overwhelmingly posi
tive." According to Knight, "The course
takes about six hours of class time to
master." Students in the classes make use
of many training aids such as a full-size life
like mannequin called a Resusci-Anne

which electronically provides feedback on
how effective the CPR would be on a real
person.
Knight describes himself as a meticulous
teacher. "Anyone who has passed my class
can do CPR on me with confidence," he
said. ' People who come in here are
genuinely concerned and want to learn
how to save someone's life. It could be
someone off the street, your boss, your
wife, your friend. Vou don't need to be old
to need CPR; you could have an accident,

'There was one sad incident
in which a man collapsed,
and no one in his family
knew CPR. His wife and son
called the hospital and then
sat on the curb, waiting for
the ambulance to arrive
while he lay dying/

choke on some food or get shocked fixing
your television," he said.
"I heard of one sad incident in which a
man collapsed and no one in his family
knew CPR. His wife and son called the hos
pital and sat on the curb, waiting for the
ambulance to arrive while he lay dying,''
said Knight.
"We teach out of Cowell and need
people who have taken the class to go on
and work as instructors," he said.
According to Todd Kiskaddon, coordina
tor of the Life Support Center at the Med
Center, the first training programs ap
peared in 1973. Before then life-support
was considered to lie in the realm of the

medical specialist. Since the early 1970 s,
the public's interest in the technique has
grown tremendously.
The modern technique itself, based on
repeated chest compressions, was dis
covered accidentally in the early 19605. Re
searchers were trying to make dogs recover
from ventricular fibrillation by using shocks
administered to the animal's chest. They
monitored the blood s circulation and
found that when they placed the heavy
electrodes on the dog's chest, it was com
pressed, and the heart pumped some
blood.

This effect is the basis of the sequence of
carefully directed and timed thrusts against
the heart-stopped victims chest which
when combined with systematic artificial
respiration comprises CPR.
Before the value of the chest compres
sions was proven, the standard mean of at
tempting resuscitation was to surgically
expose the heart and massage it on the
operating table. Using this technique, sur
vival of cardiac arrest was infrequent.
In the last 20 years, the art of resuscita
tion has steadily evolved. In the '50s, accor
ding to Kiskaddon, the focus was primarily

on breathing, providing oxygen to the
body.
With the development of the effective,
chest compression method of circulating
blood in the 19605, non-specialists could
expect to contribute substantially to a car
diac arrest victims chances of survival.
In the '70s and '80s, the focus of the res
cuer's training shifted from preserving the
heart to minimizing brain damage. Those
patients who enter the hospital in a deep
coma only have an 8 percent chance of
leaving the hospital without a neurological
deficit, said Kiskaddon.

tive." According to Knight, "The course
takes about six hours of class time to
master." Students in the classes make use
of many training aids such as a full-size life
like mannequin called a Resusci-Anne

which electronically provides feedback on
how effective the CPR would be on a real
person.
Knight describes himself as a meticulous
teacher. "Anyone who has passed my class
can do CPR on me with confidence," he
said. ' People who come in here are
genuinely concerned and want to learn
how to save someone's life. It could be
someone off the street, your boss, your
wife, your friend. Vou don't need to be old
to need CPR; you could have an accident,

According to Todd Kiskaddon, coordina
tor of the Life Support Center at the Med
Center, the first training programs ap
peared in 1973. Before then life-support
was considered to lie in the realm of the

medical specialist. Since the early 1970 s,
the public's interest in the technique has
grown tremendously.
The modern technique itself, based on
repeated chest compressions, was dis
covered accidentally in the early 19605. Re
searchers were trying to make dogs recover
from ventricular fibrillation by using shocks
administered to the animal's chest. They
monitored the blood s circulation and
found that when they placed the heavy
electrodes on the dog's chest, it was com
pressed, and the heart pumped some
blood.

This effect is the basis of the sequence of
carefully directed and timed thrusts against
the heart-stopped victims chest which
when combined with systematic artificial
respiration comprises CPR.
Before the value of the chest compres
sions was proven, the standard mean of at
tempting resuscitation was to surgically
expose the heart and massage it on the
operating table. Using this technique, sur
vival of cardiac arrest was infrequent.
In the last 20 years, the art of resuscita
tion has steadily evolved. In the '50s, accor
ding to Kiskaddon, the focus was primarily

on breathing, providing oxygen to the
body.
With the development of the effective,
chest compression method of circulating
blood in the 19605, non-specialists could
expect to contribute substantially to a car
diac arrest victims chances of survival.
In the '70s and '80s, the focus of the res
cuer's training shifted from preserving the
heart to minimizing brain damage. Those
patients who enter the hospital in a deep
coma only have an 8 percent chance of
leaving the hospital without a neurological
deficit, said Kiskaddon.

Taking to heart the Roy Scout "be
|>r pared" motto, students here are signing
up in ret ord numbers this year to learn how
to save lives through a new residence
ased basic life support training program,
mphasizing cardiopulmonary resuscita
tion (CPR) training.
I he CPR technique combines artificial
respiration with chest compressions to circ
l.itt and provide oxygen for the blood of
lie incapacitated victim.
Studies show that applying CPR immedi
leiy to a victim can double the survival rate
itter ventricular fibrillation, while lessening
he degree ot brain damage.
Cardiac arrest kills more than 325,000
Americans each year before they ever make
it to the hospital. Although emergency
treatments and highly-trained health
workers in a hospital can maximize a heart
ittack victim's chances of survival, if the pa
tient is dead or irretrievably brain-damaged
>efore even arriving, the hospital's facilities
ire useless.
The premise of the training program is
that more lives could be saved if people in
the general community, especially those
.vho work or live with people known to be
it risk, were trained in life-support tech
niques.
The idea of training people not expert in
medical care to "saturate the population''
with citizens able to keep cardiac arrest vic
tims alive is a new one, but worked well in
other communities, drastically reducing the
number of "dead on arrival" heart attack
victims.
Richard Knight, a CPR instructor on
campus, describes the response of students
to the course as "overwhelmingly posi
tive." According to Knight, "The course
takes about six hours of class time to
