A 3 x 5 card taped to the door read: "No of
fice hours today — family emergency." Inside,
Mathematics Professor Karel deLeeuw lay
dead, having been clubbed to death with a
two-pound hammer by graduate student
Theodore Streleski.
The grisly details of that horrible afternoon
of August 18,1978 came back to haunt the Stan
ford community last week, when it was
revealed that Streleski will be freed on parole
in the next two months. The short, five-year
sentence understandably brought anger and
fear to many on campus.
One can't help comparing the case with an
other 1978 tragedy: Dan White's murders of
San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Su
pervisor Harvey Milk. Like Streleski, White's
sentence ended early this year, and the double
killer is now a free man in Los Angeles.
In addition to the strong emotions these
cases evoke, they also make us want to ques
tion our judicial system and cry out for tougher
sentences. Thankfully, reforms already made
in the system have responded to our com

plaints.
The diminished capacity defense used in
both cases was abolished by the California
Legislature. Moreover, the prison sentence for
second degree murder — Streleski's crime —
was increased from a seven-year maximum to a
15-year minimum term shortly after the
deLeeuw killing. If a White or Streleski case
happened today, the criminal would be more
justly punished.
While these reforms do little to lessen the
grief surrounding the deLeeuw murder, they
do temper our concern about the judicial sys
tem. The way people feel about Theodore
Streleski or Dan White may be unchangeable,
but we are fortunate to have a democratic sys
tem that responds to complaints about how we
punish criminals.
Care must be taken to keep emotions in
check when determining policy for society as a
whole. In this case, however, changes were
necessary. There will be anger and fear when
Streleski is released, but it is reassuring that
justice will be better served in the future.
