# Reagan foreign policy and the facade of "peace"
## 
### 
I was reading one of the Chronicle's in
depth human interest stories — I believe it
was about a woman who was into bondage
— when another article caught my eye:
"Reagan: U.S. to continue peace initia
tive."
My first reaction was: What is this
"peace" stuff? Is our president a dupe of
the KGB? An agent of Libyan terrorism?
But this was only wishful thinking. It had
more to do with 1984, and I'm not talking
about Big Brother. It's just that too many
people are saying, "Yeah, I like what he's
done for the economy, but I feel uncom
fortable knowing he wants to blow the
world to smithereens." It's an election
year, and advisers probably fear the voters
might seek a more steady finger on the
doomsday button.
So now the president is changing his
"image." He won't appear in campaign ads
carrying a bazooka. He won't refer to cruise

missiles as "love buckets." He won't reply
to the question of whether a limited nuclear
war is possible by saying, "Well, we'll never
know until we've tried."
But just because Reagan has eaten a little
quiche in his recent speeches, don't expect
him to start saving whales or to send the
Russians love beads. Nothing will change
policy-wise, because, in his clouded little
mind, he's been working for peace all
along.
Look at his Russian policy, for example.
Reagan gets all his information on the Rus
sians from books like The Reader's Digest
Condensed Guide to the Communist
Menace, which offer fascinating quotes
from Marx and Lenin proving that they felt a
nuclear war was necessary to mutate
people into the New Communist Man.
In the tired mind of a suddenly powerful
B-movie actor, such books have powerful

influence. Peace for you and I might mean
coexistence, but for Reagan peace is what
we had with Germany after V-E Day, or with
Japan after we dropped . . . but let's not
think about that.
He tries to talk to the Soviets. He submits
plan after plan for arms control to them,
each in its own way guaranteeing U.S. nu
clear superiority. But after all, isn't that our
birthright, as Americans? I can see him lying
in bed, in his footie pajamas, saying, "Gee
Nancy, why can't they just be reasonable?"
Vou can't negotiate with the Bad Guys,
you can only have a showdown with them
in the last reel. One gunslinger's going to
be lying in the dust when it's over, as the
other rides into the sunset. And Reagan
thinks that can be us on that horse, as long
as we have enough nukes in our six
shooter.
Or take Grenada—Reagan did. Or
Lebanon — a bizarre example of Reagan's

belief that the mere presence of military
power — Marines who don't even have a
specific mission beyond blowing up anyone
who shoots at them — can solve complex
social crises.
With Israel, Syria, America, France and
Italy all occupying parts of Lebanon, per
haps they should form a support group to
help each other get out. They could call it
Lebanonymous.
The shooting of the American on the
Nicaraguan border calls another of
Reagan's "peace initiatives" to the nation's
attention. The story itself is a little hard to
follow. First Hondurans reported that the
pilot was killed while trying to surrender.
Then one of the crew members said no, we
were trying to take cover in a ditch. Finally,
a member of the Honduran Air Force was
dismissed for admitting that the "off
course" helicopter was actually right where

it was supposed to be.
The issue of whether or not Nicaraguan
soldiers are trigger-happy obscures one
more fundamental question: Why are we
trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan govern
ment? (Which, by the way, is illegal, by
both U.S. and international law.)
Answer: Because they are socialists, and
no people could be happy with a socialist
government. But it doesn't really matter if
they are happy or not, because, by God,
this is our hemisphere, and, for that matter,
our world. And if everybody in it acts the
way we want them to then there isn't going
to be any trouble.
And that, for Ronald Reagan, is what
peace is all about.
