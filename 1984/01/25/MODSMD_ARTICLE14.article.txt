More chemistry
There is a problem with the lower
division undergraduate chemistry
program here. No one important
will admit it, but the problem exists
and the remedy is fairly simple. All
that is required is money and labor.
The program would have to get a
substantial increase in allowance,
and the curriculum committee
would have to pass measures that
would alter the format of the cur
rent program and adjust the curric
ulum accordingly. Let me explain.
As I understand it, way back
when Donald Kennedy was brought
to Stanford to set up the Human
Biology program, he decided that
Stanford undergraduates should
have three quarters of organic
chemistry by their first quarter
sophomore year. This approach in
fact, may be ideal for proceeding
into the biochemistry requirements
of the major, but neglects two very
important facts.
First, general chemistry, usually
taught in the first year at other
schools (they don't get O-chem
until sophomore year), contributes
to the understanding of organic
chemistry. Second, people don't
study during the summer, and it is
important to have all the organic
chemistry presented on the same

side of a summer break.
Currently, the normal pre-med
undergraduate takes Chem. 31, 33,
35 and 36 in the freshman year, and
130, 131 and 135 in the sophomore
year (odd numbers refer to
lectures, even numbers to labs).
The meat of the organic sequence,
Chem. 35 and 131, is presented on
opposite sides of that first summer.
It also puts the two organic labs on
opposite sides of the break as well.
Furthermore, since many topics
usually covered in a general
chemistry class are left for the or
ganic chemistry professors to
introduce, the natural flow of the
course is often interrupted .
The best remedy for this
ridiculous situation is to create
another general chemistry class
between 31 and 33, and eliminate
135. This shuffle would help to
solidify the non-organic back
ground of the student prior to the
introduction of organic chemistry,
putting all the organic courses in
the sophomore year.
The problems with the program
would also be eased by a major
increase in budget. It is a fact that a
Stanford student receives only eight
quarter- hours of lab to a Cal stu
dent's 20. Part of the reason for this
discrepancy appears to be an un-

willingness to spend the necessary
amount of money.
Speaking from experience, being
a TA for a lab here is an unparal
leled onus. The students have very
little understanding of the method
ology of experimentation. In gen
eral, they can't work alone because
their understanding is so limited
that they don't know how to
proceed if something doesn't work
exactly as advertised in the labora
tory manual. Organic lab has been
reduced to a "cookbook" in much
the same way that my first Fisher-
Price chemistry set was.
A quarter or two, or even three of
general chemistry lab before the
introduction of organic lab would
definitely help. Such a course em
phasizes techniques of measure
ment in preparation for their imple
mentation in the organic lab.
Chemistry lab is expensive, since
there are necessarily non
renewable resources, i.e., chemi
cals involved.
The solution to the problems are
somewhat costly, but Stanford
undergraduates are paying $9000 to
attend school here. Can we really
justify not giving as good an educa
tion as a cheaper public school?

The Daily recently published an
article on the new Marguerite
shuttle service. We would like to
add one item that was not included
in that article and which we think
warrants the attention of the Stan
ford community.
Associated with the Marguerite is
an on-call door-to-door campus
dispatch service for people with
disabilities. This "paratransit" ser
vice is available within the same
geographical boundries and time
limits as the rest of Marguerite. It is
free of charge and open to all fac
ulty, staff and students with dis
abilities. For optimum service, at
least two-hours notice should be
given before the desired pick-up
time. However, the service is
available on an on-call basis with
passenger pick-up following 10 to
30 minutes after the request is
placed.
Individuals who would like to use
the Marguerite paratransit service
or who want additional information
should call 947-4000 or, if no an
swer, 968-1617. Those calling the
latter number should indicate they
are requesting Marguerite paratran
sit service.

Door-to-door
The Daily recently published an
article on the new Marguerite
shuttle service. We would like to
add one item that was not included
in that article and which we think
warrants the attention of the Stan
ford community.
Associated with the Marguerite is
an on-call door-to-door campus
dispatch service for people with
disabilities. This "paratransit" ser
vice is available within the same
geographical boundries and time
limits as the rest of Marguerite. It is
free of charge and open to all fac
ulty, staff and students with dis
abilities. For optimum service, at
least two-hours notice should be
given before the desired pick-up
time. However, the service is
available on an on-call basis with
passenger pick-up following 10 to
30 minutes after the request is
placed.
Individuals who would like to use
the Marguerite paratransit service
or who want additional information
should call 947-4000 or, if no an
swer, 968-1617. Those calling the
latter number should indicate they
are requesting Marguerite paratran
sit service.

More chemistry
There is a problem with the lower
division undergraduate chemistry
program here. No one important
will admit it, but the problem exists
and the remedy is fairly simple. All
that is required is money and labor.
The program would have to get a
substantial increase in allowance,
and the curriculum committee
would have to pass measures that
would alter the format of the cur
rent program and adjust the curric
ulum accordingly. Let me explain.
As I understand it, way back
when Donald Kennedy was brought
to Stanford to set up the Human
Biology program, he decided that
Stanford undergraduates should
have three quarters of organic
chemistry by their first quarter
sophomore year. This approach in
fact, may be ideal for proceeding
into the biochemistry requirements
of the major, but neglects two very
important facts.
First, general chemistry, usually
taught in the first year at other
schools (they don't get O-chem
until sophomore year), contributes
to the understanding of organic
chemistry. Second, people don't
study during the summer, and it is
important to have all the organic
chemistry presented on the same

side of a summer break.
Currently, the normal pre-med
undergraduate takes Chem. 31, 33,
35 and 36 in the freshman year, and
130, 131 and 135 in the sophomore
year (odd numbers refer to
lectures, even numbers to labs).
The meat of the organic sequence,
Chem. 35 and 131, is presented on
opposite sides of that first summer.
It also puts the two organic labs on
opposite sides of the break as well.
Furthermore, since many topics
usually covered in a general
chemistry class are left for the or
ganic chemistry professors to
introduce, the natural flow of the
course is often interrupted .
The best remedy for this
ridiculous situation is to create
another general chemistry class
between 31 and 33, and eliminate
135. This shuffle would help to
solidify the non-organic back
ground of the student prior to the
introduction of organic chemistry,
putting all the organic courses in
the sophomore year.
The problems with the program
would also be eased by a major
increase in budget. It is a fact that a
Stanford student receives only eight
quarter- hours of lab to a Cal stu
dent's 20. Part of the reason for this
discrepancy appears to be an un-

willingness to spend the necessary
amount of money.
Speaking from experience, being
a TA for a lab here is an unparal
leled onus. The students have very
little understanding of the method
ology of experimentation. In gen
eral, they can't work alone because
their understanding is so limited
that they don't know how to
proceed if something doesn't work
exactly as advertised in the labora
tory manual. Organic lab has been
reduced to a "cookbook" in much
the same way that my first Fisher-
Price chemistry set was.
A quarter or two, or even three of
general chemistry lab before the
introduction of organic lab would
definitely help. Such a course em
phasizes techniques of measure
ment in preparation for their imple
mentation in the organic lab.
