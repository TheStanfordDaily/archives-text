## Unnecessary deaths add up for Reagan 
### 
In what has become almost a com
monplace occurrence recently, the
body of another U.S. serviceman
returned home last week beneath a
flag-draped coffin. Surprisingly, the
victim, Jeffery Schwab, 27, fell not
on the runway of the Beirut Airport;
he was killed as the U.S. Army
helicopter which he piloted was
shot down over the Honduras-
Nicaragua border. Schwab is the
first U.S. serviceman to die from
hostile combat fire in Honduras.
Schwab joins the continually
swelling ranks of U.S. servicemen
who have sacrificed their lives
defending U.S. interests abroad for
the Reagan administration. One may
find it tempting, therefore, to view
Schwab as another "statistic" — an
"expenditure" made necessary by
the high cost of maintaining peace.
Yet this would be a grievous
mistake.
Schwab's death has brought great
suffering to his family and friends.
Their personal anguish cannot fail to
arouse our deepest sympathies. Yet
his loss should awaken our political
sensibilities as well. Both in the par
ticular circumstances surrounding it
and in its broader implications,
Schwab's death argues for a re
examination of the U.S. military role
in Honduras.
The precise details of the downing
of Schwab's helicopter remain a
subject of controversy. American of
ficials in Honduras claim that
Schwab and his crew were en route
to assist a "civilian project" when
their helicopter veered off course by
25 to 30 miles and came under fire
from an area within Nicaragua; they
have vehemently denied that the
crew was involved in military-related
activity or ever entered Nicaraguan
airspace.
Both assertions seem question
able, at best. Honduran officials
claim that they received reports
prior to the incident which revealed
that a U.S. Army helicopter in
tended to fly over the border area.
In light of the important strategic in
terests the United States has here —
helping the "Contras" to infiltrate
Nicaragua and controlling the flow
of arms to the rebels in El Salvador
— such a claim does not seem im
plausible.

In fact, the doubts cast by the
Honduran version have forced John
Negroponte, U.S. ambassador to
Honduras, to sanction a compre
hensive review of the incident.
Should this investigation reveal that
Schwab had direct orders to fly the
border area, the administration
must account for why it contravened
Congressional legislation which
prohibits U.S. servicemen from
being within five miles of this hostile
zone.
Schwab's death, however, holds
even broader implications for U.S.
policy in Honduras. Schwab was
part of Big Pine 11, the large scale
military maneuver which has been
taking place in and off the coast of
Honduras since August, 1983. The
Reagan administration has sched
uled a second operation of similar
magnitude for this summer.
With the inevitable escalation of
the "border war," facilitated by the
$24 million Congress appropriated
for this purpose in September, the
possibility that the United States will
be "drawn in" to a full-scale conflict
with Nicaragua will undoubtedly in
crease. And while heightened U.S.
pressure may lead to a reduction in
the arms flow to rebels in El Sal
vador, it will not, in all likelihood,
achieve the ultimate objective of the
Reagan administration: the ousting
of the Sandinista government (the
latter has proved adept at repulsing
the Contras" and in consolidating
its rule in the face of the growing
U.S. threat.
Ironically, the death of Schwab
presents the Reagan administration
with a timely opportunity to ease
tensions with the Sandinista govern
ment. By renouncing its intentions
to overthrow the Marxist regime and
by undertaking extensive diplomatic
negotiations, the administration
could move the Sandinistas to es
chew direct support for the rebels in
El Salvador and establish a more
democratic system at home. If it fails
to seize the initiative, leffery
Schwab will recede into the
meaningless world of numbers —
the first, but not the only U.S. ser
viceman to die in Honduras.

military maneuver which has been
taking place in and off the coast of
Honduras since August, 1983. The
Reagan administration has sched
uled a second operation of similar
magnitude for this summer.
With the inevitable escalation of
the "border war," facilitated by the
$24 million Congress appropriated
for this purpose in September, the
possibility that the United States will
be "drawn in" to a full-scale conflict
with Nicaragua will undoubtedly in
crease. And while heightened U.S.
pressure may lead to a reduction in
the arms flow to rebels in El Sal
vador, it will not, in all likelihood,
achieve the ultimate objective of the
Reagan administration: the ousting
of the Sandinista government (the
latter has proved adept at repulsing
the Contras" and in consolidating
its rule in the face of the growing
U.S. threat.
Ironically, the death of Schwab
presents the Reagan administration
with a timely opportunity to ease
tensions with the Sandinista govern
ment. By renouncing its intentions
to overthrow the Marxist regime and
by undertaking extensive diplomatic
negotiations, the administration
could move the Sandinistas to es
chew direct support for the rebels in
El Salvador and establish a more
democratic system at home. If it fails
to seize the initiative, leffery
Schwab will recede into the
meaningless world of numbers —
the first, but not the only U.S. ser
viceman to die in Honduras.
