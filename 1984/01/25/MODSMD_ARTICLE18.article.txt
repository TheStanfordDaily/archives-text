# Grissum and Harry: Injuries cause them to make choices
## 
### PETER HAVEN 
When juniors Darrell Gris
sum and Emile Harry tried out
for Coach Tom Davis' basket
ball squad last June, they ap
peared to have a lot in com
mon. Now, however, the only
apparent similarity between
the two is that they are both
recovering from football injur
ies.
At the end of the 1982 foot
ball season, Harry was the
starting wide reciever for the
Cardinal, and Grissum was a
defensive back on the verge of
becoming a full-time starter.
The two football players had
[ so impressed Davis with their
r basketball ability, that they
made the 12-man squad selec
ted to play in Japan at the Kirin
j World Tournament last sum
| mer. After their trip, Harry and
Grissum had both planned to
play basketball this season.
Then their paths started to
; diverge.
On a rainy November Satur
day, Grissum, from his free
safety position, moved to
tackle a UC-Berkeley ball car
rier near the sideline. When
the pile-up of players began to
disassemble, Grissum
remained on the soggy turf.
He had suffered multiple in
juries — a spinal contusion, a
pinched nerve in his neck and
a slight concussion.

"I existed but I didn't exist,"
said Grissum. "I was seriously
concentrating on just moving
anything in my body, and I
was also praying at the same
time."
Fortunately, Grissum
regained sensation and move
ment in his arms and legs, but
the thought that he had almost

been paralyzed forced him to
reconsider his football career.
A short while later he an
nounced that he would not
play football again. It was a
sport he had participated in
since he was nine-years-old
and one of which he had
hoped to make a career.
"It was no secret that I

wanted to play pro football or
pro anything for that matter,"
said Grissum "But now that's
been doused. This injury has
opened my eyes to a lot of
things."
Despite the fact that his in
jury has prevented him from
participating in am competi
tive sports this year, Grissum
has opted to try out for the
basketball team again next
year. It is a decision that he
said is prompted more by a
desire to meet a (hallenge,
not because he wants to find
another means to a profes
sional sports careei
"I had always planned on
playing basketball, said Gris
sum. "I'm a firm believer in
trying to get as much out of
yourself as possible, and I
would be cheating myself if I
didn't try to play basketball.
I'm not thinking of a pro
career, though."
After the 1983 season, Harry
was also left with an injury. His
shoulder had caused him
recurring problems and he
recently had an operation on
it. Although his injury was less
severe than Grissum's, Harry
has decided not to jeopardize
his football career on the bas
ketball court.
"I play football and that's
what I do first," said Harry. "I
don't want to take the chance
of hurting the shoulder

playing basketball. I have to
take first things first."
Harry, a prime offensive tar
get for former Stanford quar
terback )ohn Elway in 1981 and
1982, as well as John Paye this
past season, is thought to have
an excellent chance at a career
in the professional ranks.
"I think I'm in a good posi
tion to play pro football. I had
a great time in Japan with the
basketball team, visiting an
other country, but basketball
is just a competitive hobby to
me. It's just something I enjoy
doing," Harry said.
Davis also agreed that Harry
should probably be more con
cerned with a football future
than with college basketball.
"From what I understand,
Emile is going to be a highly
sought after receiver. He's
going to be looking at things

like the NFL and USFL in the
next year or so. I think he'll be
a pro wide receiver someday,"
said Davis.
Davis added, "Grissum and
Harry are both really good ath
letes and great guys. They
made the trip to Japan and I
was impressed with them. You
could tell they enjoyed playing
basketball. They were out
there because it was a kick for
them."
Both Harry and Grissum
came to Stanford in 1981 after
being recruited by many
schools for football and basket
ball.
After remarkably similar
high school and early college
careers and future plans, the
dissimilarities between the
two now are even more
surprising. Grissum, unlike
Harry, now finds himself out

of the world of professional
athletics and hanging between
two sports. He is looking back
on one and anticipating an
other.
"A lot is still up in the air
right now," said Crissum. "I
am still under the doctor's
care. I want to make sure its
perfectly safe for me to partici
pate in competitive athletics
again."
He continued, "I miss foot
ball more than I thought. I'm
looking forward to possibly
participating in basketball. As
long as you have your sights
set on something, you feel
better."
Although Grissum and Har
ry represent a tale of two ath
letes, there is still one thing
they share in common. "They
both have winning per
sonalities," said Davis.

most paralyzed Grissum, caused him to rethink the course of

been paralyzed forced him to
reconsider his football career.
A short while later he an
nounced that he would not
play football again. It was a
sport he had participated in
since he was nine-years-old
and one of which he had
hoped to make a career.
"It was no secret that I

wanted to play pro football or
pro anything for that matter,"
said Grissum "But now that's
been doused. This injury has
opened my eyes to a lot of
things."
Despite the fact that his in
jury has prevented him from
participating in am competi
tive sports this year, Grissum
has opted to try out for the
basketball team again next
year. It is a decision that he
said is prompted more by a
desire to meet a (hallenge,
not because he wants to find
another means to a profes

"I had always planned on
playing basketball, said Gris
sum. "I'm a firm believer in
trying to get as much out of
yourself as possible, and I
would be cheating myself if I
didn't try to play basketball.
I'm not thinking of a pro
career, though."
After the 1983 season, Harry
was also left with an injury. His
shoulder had caused him
recurring problems and he
recently had an operation on
it. Although his injury was less
severe than Grissum's, Harry
has decided not to jeopardize
his football career on the bas
ketball court.
"I play football and that's
what I do first," said Harry. "I
don't want to take the chance
of hurting the shoulder

playing basketball. I have to
take first things first."
Harry, a prime offensive tar
get for former Stanford quar
terback )ohn Elway in 1981 and
1982, as well as John Paye this
past season, is thought to have
an excellent chance at a career
in the professional ranks.
"I think I'm in a good posi
tion to play pro football. I had
a great time in Japan with the
basketball team, visiting an
other country, but basketball
is just a competitive hobby to
me. It's just something I enjoy
doing," Harry said.
Davis also agreed that Harry
should probably be more con
cerned with a football future
than with college basketball.
"From what I understand,
Emile is going to be a highly
sought after receiver. He's
going to be looking at things

like the NFL and USFL in the
next year or so. I think he'll be
a pro wide receiver someday,"
said Davis.
Davis added, "Grissum and
Harry are both really good ath
letes and great guys. They
made the trip to Japan and I
was impressed with them. You
could tell they enjoyed playing
basketball. They were out
there because it was a kick for
them."
Both Harry and Grissum
came to Stanford in 1981 after
being recruited by many
schools for football and basket
ball.
After remarkably similar
high school and early college
careers and future plans, the
dissimilarities between the
two now are even more
surprising. Grissum, unlike
Harry, now finds himself out

of the world of professional
athletics and hanging between
two sports. He is looking back
on one and anticipating an
other.
"A lot is still up in the air
right now," said Crissum. "I
am still under the doctor's
care. I want to make sure its
perfectly safe for me to partici
pate in competitive athletics
again."
He continued, "I miss foot
ball more than I thought. I'm
looking forward to possibly
participating in basketball. As
long as you have your sights
set on something, you feel
better."
Although Grissum and Har
ry represent a tale of two ath
letes, there is still one thing
they share in common. "They
both have winning per
sonalities," said Davis.

Darrell Grissum's football career was cut short by a debilitat
ing injury he received during Big Game. The injury, which al
most paralyzed Grissum, caused him to rethink the course of
his athletic future.


Emile Harry's collegiate basketball career was ended this season because of an injured
shoulder. Harry, shown being hit by an Arizona player, chose to favor football over basket
ball. He did not want to risk further injury by playing for the Card hoopsters.
When juniors Darrell Gris
sum and Emile Harry tried out
for Coach Tom Davis' basket
ball squad last June, they ap
peared to have a lot in com
mon. Now, however, the only
apparent similarity between
the two is that they are both
recovering from football injur
ies.
At the end of the 1982 foot
ball season, Harry was the
starting wide reciever for the
Cardinal, and Grissum was a
defensive back on the verge of
becoming a full-time starter.
The two football players had
[ so impressed Davis with their
r basketball ability, that they
made the 12-man squad selec
ted to play in Japan at the Kirin
j World Tournament last sum
| mer. After their trip, Harry and
Grissum had both planned to
play basketball this season.
Then their paths started to
; diverge.
On a rainy November Satur
day, Grissum, from his free
safety position, moved to
tackle a UC-Berkeley ball car
rier near the sideline. When
the pile-up of players began to
disassemble, Grissum
remained on the soggy turf.
He had suffered multiple in
juries — a spinal contusion, a
pinched nerve in his neck and
a slight concussion.

"I existed but I didn't exist,"
said Grissum. "I was seriously
concentrating on just moving
anything in my body, and I
was also praying at the same
time."
Fortunately, Grissum
regained sensation and move
ment in his arms and legs, but
the thought that he had almost

been paralyzed forced him to
reconsider his football career.
A short while later he an
nounced that he would not
play football again. It was a
sport he had participated in
