## Nothing funny about the money 
### 
AI McGuire

Believe it or not, there is
a flip side, a serious side to
AI McGuire. So let's stop
and talk a minute about
something that's been on
my mind for some time,
sort of nagging like the
water faucet that drips in
(he night, or the headache
that gets a little worse each
day until you finally reach
for the aspirin.
I really think it's time for
the presidents of the uni
versities to take a firmer
hold on the whole college
sports world where monies
and the future of college
athletics are concerned.
Cut across all the lines of
conferences, alumni and
TV to straighten out a mess
that atfects more young
people's lives every year.
First of all, I've always
believed day one that all
monies from the bowl
games and the NCAA Bas
ketball Tourney should be
divided between all of the
275 Division I schools. Last

year, the Final Four got
$550,000 each, and when
you talk about the Rose
Bowl or Cotton Bowl,
you're talking millions. So
there's more than enough
pie to go around. Power
house schools like ken
tut k\ or North Carolina
wo u I d nt miss a smaller
piece but for schools like
Northern Illinois or Xavier,
a $.*O,OOO to $50,000 check
would be like a parting of
the Red Sea.
Also, I think a percentage
of those monies should be
kept in escrow by the
schools for any student
athlete from an income
producing sport who has to
return to the classroom to
tinish getting his degree
after his senior year. The
-tudent-athlete should be
able to finish up his degree
at the school of his choice
with the only requirement
being that he must pass his
courses.
Hey, the teams that go to
bowls and to the Final Four
have got pavment enough
just from the exposure
from the tube. That helps
them recruit the blue chip
high school athletes, plus
they also receive more
monies from the alumni
every time they go to the
Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl or

Final Four. To have those
schools receive such tre
mendous size checks every
New Year's Day or in April
puts them too far ahead of
the competition. What
we're doing is creating
dynasties; haves and have
nots. What we're going to
end up with are about 50
universities that are legit
heavyweights, but no light

heavyweights, no welter
weights. Instead we drop
right down to flyweights.
By distributing the dol
lars, we have a better
chance of achieving parity
throughout Division I and
that is good for the sport.

I also believe student
athletes should be forced
to maintain an orderly
process toward a degree
and not be allowed to take
all the "Mickey Mouse"
courses.
Each year the student
athlete must have a certain
percentage of quality
credits. They can't just be

numbers. There must be
quality inside the credits
that lead to the degree. I
don't care if it takes five
years, as long as there is
normal progress toward a
desired degree. That way,
the kid isn't just left hang

ing after four years, a bas
ket case who still needs t>o
to 70 credits because he
took nothing but garbage
courses all along the wa\.
When he gets through with
his four years he would at
least be close to the brass
ring, maybe six or eight
credits short, but no more
than that.
Too many people are not
getting their degree. A total
of 71 percent of the football
players in the NFL don't
have college degrees.
Why? There's something
rotten in Denmark, that's
why.
The colleges ought to be
trying to help the student
athlete — not just use
them. Too many schools
give athletic-ships, not
scholarships. These kids go
out and attract the bright
lights and TV cameras for
the school, so why
shouldn't the school pay
them back?
CBS paid $90 million to
telecast the NCAA Tourney
for three years. That's tre
mendous money, mega
dollars from the tube, and
it's only fair that some of
those dollars be channeled
back to maintain parits in
Division I, and to make
sure these kids get then
degrees.

Believe it or not, there is
a flip side, a serious side to
AI McGuire. So let's stop
and talk a minute about
something that's been on
my mind for some time,
sort of nagging like the
water faucet that drips in
(he night, or the headache
that gets a little worse each
day until you finally reach
for the aspirin.
I really think it's time for
the presidents of the uni
versities to take a firmer
hold on the whole college
sports world where monies
and the future of college
athletics are concerned.
Cut across all the lines of
conferences, alumni and
TV to straighten out a mess
that atfects more young
people's lives every year.
First of all, I've always
believed day one that all
monies from the bowl
games and the NCAA Bas
ketball Tourney should be
divided between all of the
275 Division I schools. Last

year, the Final Four got
$550,000 each, and when
you talk about the Rose
Bowl or Cotton Bowl,
you're talking millions. So
there's more than enough
pie to go around. Power
house schools like ken
tut k\ or North Carolina
wo u I d nt miss a smaller
piece but for schools like
Northern Illinois or Xavier,
a $.*O,OOO to $50,000 check
would be like a parting of
the Red Sea.
Also, I think a percentage
of those monies should be
kept in escrow by the
schools for any student
athlete from an income
producing sport who has to
return to the classroom to
tinish getting his degree
after his senior year. The
-tudent-athlete should be
able to finish up his degree
at the school of his choice
with the only requirement
being that he must pass his
courses.
Hey, the teams that go to
bowls and to the Final Four
have got pavment enough
just from the exposure
from the tube. That helps
them recruit the blue chip
high school athletes, plus
they also receive more
monies from the alumni
every time they go to the
Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl or

Final Four. To have those
schools receive such tre
mendous size checks every
New Year's Day or in April
puts them too far ahead of
the competition. What
we're doing is creating
dynasties; haves and have
nots. What we're going to
end up with are about 50
universities that are legit
heavyweights, but no light

heavyweights, no welter
weights. Instead we drop
right down to flyweights.
By distributing the dol
lars, we have a better
chance of achieving parity
throughout Division I and
that is good for the sport.

I also believe student
athletes should be forced
to maintain an orderly
process toward a degree
and not be allowed to take
all the "Mickey Mouse"
courses.
Each year the student
athlete must have a certain
percentage of quality
credits. They can't just be

numbers. There must be
quality inside the credits
that lead to the degree. I
don't care if it takes five
years, as long as there is
normal progress toward a
desired degree. That way,
the kid isn't just left hang

ing after four years, a bas
ket case who still needs t>o
to 70 credits because he
took nothing but garbage
courses all along the wa\.
When he gets through with
his four years he would at
least be close to the brass
ring, maybe six or eight
credits short, but no more
than that.
Too many people are not
getting their degree. A total
of 71 percent of the football
players in the NFL don't
have college degrees.
Why? There's something
rotten in Denmark, that's
why.
The colleges ought to be
trying to help the student
athlete — not just use
them. Too many schools
give athletic-ships, not
scholarships. These kids go
out and attract the bright
lights and TV cameras for
the school, so why
shouldn't the school pay
them back?
CBS paid $90 million to
telecast the NCAA Tourney
for three years. That's tre
mendous money, mega
dollars from the tube, and
it's only fair that some of
those dollars be channeled
back to maintain parits in
Division I, and to make
sure these kids get then
degrees.
