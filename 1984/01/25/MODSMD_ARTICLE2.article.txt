# OSA investigating SCOPE fund transfer
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The Stanford Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE) has come under fire from the
ASSU and the Office of Student Activities (OSA)
because the group — which has only one mem
ber — tried to donate all of its money to a con
ference sponsored by the ASSU Lobby Office.
In mid-December, SCOPE transferred the
$11,000 remaining in its account to the Lobby
Office. The Lobby Office hopes to use the
money for a conference on political coalitions
that will be held Saturday, according to Scott
Newar, the sole member of SCOPE.
On jan. 16, ASSU student financial manager

Melinda Basham returned the money to SCOPE
and froze its account because the group failed
to outline its governing structure and budget.
The ASSU must have such information before it
can let a group use its money, she said.
ASSU's Appropriations Committee will dis
cuss the transfer with Newar today. Eric Berg, a
member of the committee, said the committee
will make a recommendation to the senate on
whether to approve the transfer.
Students voted down the Lobby Office's re
quest for fee assessment funds by more than
600 votes last spring quarter.
"I am pretty sure that SCOPE was not aware of
the need to file anything," Basham said.

OSA questioned the group's legitimacy after
Newar had five students who were not mem
bers sign a student group registration form at
the beginning of autumn quarter.
Newar, who has been a member of SCOPE
since autumn quarter 1982, said he had the non
members sign the form so he could transfer the
group's money to the Lobby Office for the con
ference.
Ellen Oppenheim, acting director of OSA,
said at least five active student members of a
group must sign the registration form before it
can be recognized as a voluntary student group.
