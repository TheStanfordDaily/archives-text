# OSA investigating SCOPE fund transfer
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The Stanford Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE) has come under fire from the
ASSU and the Office of Student Activities (OSA)
because the group — which has only one mem
ber — tried to donate all of its money to a con
ference sponsored by the ASSU Lobby Office.
In mid-December, SCOPE transferred the
$11,000 remaining in its account to the Lobby
Office. The Lobby Office hopes to use the
money for a conference on political coalitions
that will be held Saturday, according to Scott
Newar, the sole member of SCOPE.
On jan. 16, ASSU student financial manager

Melinda Basham returned the money to SCOPE
and froze its account because the group failed
to outline its governing structure and budget.
The ASSU must have such information before it
can let a group use its money, she said.
ASSU's Appropriations Committee will dis
cuss the transfer with Newar today. Eric Berg, a
member of the committee, said the committee
will make a recommendation to the senate on
whether to approve the transfer.
Students voted down the Lobby Office's re
quest for fee assessment funds by more than
600 votes last spring quarter.
"I am pretty sure that SCOPE was not aware of
the need to file anything," Basham said.

OSA questioned the group's legitimacy after
Newar had five students who were not mem
bers sign a student group registration form at
the beginning of autumn quarter.
Newar, who has been a member of SCOPE
since autumn quarter 1982, said he had the non
members sign the form so he could transfer the
group's money to the Lobby Office for the con
ference.
Ellen Oppenheim, acting director of OSA,
said at least five active student members of a
group must sign the registration form before it
can be recognized as a voluntary student group.
"There has been some discussion
in the Office of Student Activities
pertaining to SCOPE'S support of
ASSU's Lobby Office," Oppenheim
said. "As that discussion began to
unfold, the question was asked
Who is in that group ?' "
John Hoffmire, director of the
Lobby Office, said, "The goal was to
register the organization so the
money could be transferred."
Newar said he decided to donate
the money to the Lobby Office be
cause he wanted to phase out
SCOPE in a way consistent with the
group's objectives.
"SCOPE is really no longer an or
ganization," he said. "There are a
number of groups that are doing ex
actly what we were doing."
Newar said he, a former member
of SCOPE and several interested
non-members concluded at the end
of spring quarter that SCOPE had a
limited future.
"We decided that SCOPE didn't
serve any purpose on campus," he
said. "There was an unstated deci

sion that SCOPE wouldn't exist as it
existed in the 1982-1983 year."
Hoffmire said he approached
Newar in December about the pos
sibility of SCOPE participating in the
Lobby Office's conference.
Newar said the conference
sounded like such an appropriate
event for SCOPE that he decided
soon after his meeting with Hof
fmire to transfer the funds.
"I took it upon myself to transfer
the funds," he said.
SCOPE had $11,000 remaining in
its account because the ASSU forgot
to collect money that had been all
ocated to the organization in spring
quarter 1982.
About $13,000 in special fees had
been appropriated to SCOPE during
fee assessment elections.
The money was to have been
given in three installments starting
autumn quarter 1982. Because ASSU
failed to include SCOPE on the stu
dent fees section of the permit-to
register forms, SCOPE did not get
the money until late in spring quar
ter 1983.
Newar said SCOPE spent $2000
during last spring quarter on various
activities.
