# Court to decide where Sims plays
## 
### 
Detroit (AP) — The trial to
determine where Billy Sims
will continue his professional
football career begins in
federal court today with
franchises in rival leagues
claiming his services.
U.S. District Judge Robert
DeMascio will decide whether
Sims continues with the
Detroit Lions of the National
Football League or moves to
the Houston Gamblers of the
United States Football League.
The brilliant running back has
signed five-year contracts with
each.
Sims signed a $3.5 million
contract with the Gamblers on
July 1 and an undated agree
ment Nov. 12, the USFL team
said. He got $197,608 in July as
part of a $1 million signing
bonus, the Gamblers said. He
also signed a $5 million pact
with the Lions Dec. 16, that
team said.
Suits were filed in various
courts both in Michigan and in
Texas, but they eventually
landed in federal court at the
request of all parties because
of the geographical diversity
of the principals.
The basic suit has been split
into two parts.
One is the question of

which contract Sims must
honor. Then, if DeMascio
decides that the Lions' con
tract with Sims is valid, there
may be a separate trial to de
termine whether Argovitz and
the Gamblers owe the Lions
damages.
But for now the question of
contracts is the only issue.
Elbert Hatchett, Sims' attor
ney, said that the case would
take about a day and a half. At
torneys for the Gamblers,
however, feel it could last up
to five days.
"I think this is a relatively
simple case of whether he can
be forced to honor the Ar
govitz contract," Hatchett
said. "I don't think it'll take a
lot of witnesses to determine
that he doesn't."
Hatchett said that he would
call Sims, Argovitz and
"people who were present
when the contracts were
signed."
The Gamblers have argued
that their contract is valid and
that the team won the rights to
Sims' services fairly.
DeMascio ruled Monday
that the Lions have no stand
ing in the case, but their attor
neys will be allowed to sit at
the counsel table with

Hatchett.
In a separate suit Sims filed
on Jan. 9, the running back is
seeking $775,000 in damages
from Argovitz, a former den
tist and Houston real estate
broker. Sims also is trying to
recover $175,000 Argovitz
charged him for handling the
contract with the Gamblers
and $600,000 in damages be
cause he maintains the agent
failed to negotiate the option
year of Sims' contract with the
Lions.
"Billy originally took the po
sition that he did not want to

become involved in any suit,
but it has become clear that he
was a victim of all victims,"
Hatchett said. "Argovitz
signed Billy to his own team
and then charges him $175,000
for doing so."
Argovitz denies any conflict
of interest.
"I am very disappointed and
hurt that Billy never once dis
cussed with me any of the alle
gations made by his attorney,"
Argovitz said. "It is unfortun
ate that our relationship has
come to this.
