A story in yesterday's Daily on the
Stanford University Hospital
remodeling plan cited the project's
fundraising goal as $8.4 million. Ac
tually, the total fundraising goal for
the project is $15 million. The Hospi

tal expects to raise $8.4 million of
that amount during the remodeling
period, and to raise the balance
after the project is completed.
A picture on the back page of yes
terday's Daily showed a building on
Stanford land and implied that the
building is the proposed site of a
hazardous waste center. The pro

posed site is actually in a field near
the building.
