# Experts rap space station
## Reagan to endorse plan tonight 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
Experts here have criticized a pro
posal for a permanently manned
space station expected to be an
nounced by President Reagan in his
State of the Union address tonight.
Prof. Von Eshleman, director of
Stanford's Center for Radar
Astronomy, said the proposal is un
necessary, while graduate student
Lou Lerman said the proposal may
not go far enough.
Eshleman, a former member of
NASA's Lunar and Planetary Mis
sions Board, said Reagan may be
leading this country's space pro
gram "down a blind alley."
Eshleman said a manned space
station would serve no other pur
pose "than studying man in space."
He added that a space station could
just as easily be operated from the
ground by today's "remote technol
ogy."
Eshleman said he disagrees with
the "basic assumption that the pres
ence of humans in space is re
quired."
Although a manned station is
feasible, he said the proposal is an
extension of the early days of the
space race with the Soviet Union
and a "dramatization of technologi
cal leadership."
The estimated $10 billion to fund
the manned station could be better
spent on planetary exploration proj
ects, including the proposed
launching of an unmanned craft to
observe Halley's Comet, he said.
Other programs Eshleman sees as
more beneficial include a sample

return mission to Mars to observe
the planet and a proposal to send a
craft "over the North and South
poles of the sun."
The NASA proposal, which
Reagan is expected to endorse,
would be used intitially as a platform
to service satellites and to do experi
ments, including processing of ma
terials in space. NASA says the space
station would serve as a destination
for the shuttle and as a jumping-off
point for further exploration of
space.
The station, which could cost $20
billion or more, would be launched
in 1991 and house six to eight
astronauts for a period of up to six
months. Lerman, who has out
lined a design for a space system


Lou Lerman
with a group of students, said the
NASA proposal does not go tar
enough, his group plans to submit
their own proposal within the
month to NASA officials.
According to Lerman, the country
"does not need a manned space sta
tion. What it needs is an entire sys
tem in which man plays a role. A
manned space station is only a piece
of a system, not an end in itself."
He and other members of Engi
neering 235 will submit their own
iOO-page plan for a space system,
the result of a class project.
Their proposal calls for "a flotilla
of distributed unmanned platforms,
each of which hosts a class of com
patible instruments or facilities. This
system is directed by a coordinating
platform which acts as a communi
cation, control and resource hub of
this network of platforms," Lerman
said.

Their detailed design "utilizes
only current technologies and so al
low the coordinating platform to be
built and launched by 1990. Once
launched it will support a variety of
experiments both on, and espe
cially, off this coordinating plat
form," Lerman said.
"The space shuttle can also dock
with the coordinating platform, use
its resources, and hence con
siderably extend its time in orbit.
Therefore the manned support tech
nology required for a permanently
manned structure can be developed
and tested in stages in a more
economical and functional man
ner," Lerman said.
Commenting on the evolutionary
nature of the support requirements
for performing science and its appli
cations in low-earth orbit, Lerman
said "If you consider a manned
versus an unmanned station to be
black versus white, then for 10 to 20
billion dollars there is an awful lot of
gray."
