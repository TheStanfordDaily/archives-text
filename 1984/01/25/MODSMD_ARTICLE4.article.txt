# Stanford and NFL are already preparing for Super Bowl XIX
## 
### LARRY GREEN Staff writer 
Large-scale renovations on Stan
ford Stadium's press box, locker
rooms, ticket booths and conces
sions areas began this week in prep
aration for Super Bowl XIX, which
will be held here next January.
Associate Director of Athletics
Alan Cummings said he hopes the
game, the first National Football
League (NFL) championship to be
held in the Bay Area, "will give posi
tive exposure to the athletic pro
gram here at Stanford.
"The renovation of the press box
began this week," said Cummings,
who is in charge of stadium manage
ment for the game, which is sched
uled for Jan. 25, 1985.
The NFL will pay for the new press
area and temporary lighting at a
projected cost of about $400,000,
Cummings said .
The total cost of the improve

ments to be paid for by the Univer
sity including the locker rooms,
ticket booths and concession areas
is expected to run about $1.15 mil
lion.
The Athletic Department has
already initiated a fund-raising pro
gram with an intended goal of
$750,000. "We're about halfway
there. It's going very well Cum
mings said. The University will pay
the remaining costs.
"The plans and specifications for
a locker facility and the ticket,
restroom and concession facilities
are out to bid now," Cummings
said, "and we hope to have the
building permit around Feb. 1. We
don't anticipate any problem
meeting the construction
schedule."
All of these major improvements
should be in place by July 1, when
Stanford Stadium hosts nine sum
mer Olympic soccer matches.

"The other work we're going to
be doing involves some utilities sys
tems work (electrical, water and
plumbing), seating for the physically
limited and handrailings, but these
don't require the same scope of
planning," Cummings • said.
"There's a lot of work to be done
but it's manageable."
The wooden benches will remain
at Stanford Stadium, however.
"The magnitude of replacing the
bench seating is beyond our
capacity," Cummings said. But he
also said the NFL was looking into
installing temporary seat cushions
before the game. These cushions
are square and fold down with a flap
for holding food or game programs.
After the game, fans would be able
to take them home as souvenirs, but
Cummings said the plan was "not
final."

SUPER SITE: Stanford Stadium, the site of the 1985 Super Bowl, is going to be renovated in a joint effort by
the NFL and Stanford, with an estimated cost of more than $2 million.
Cummings said he was
"concerned about the amount of
space it takes to stage the game-day
activities" inside of the gate. These
activities include press services,
concessions booths and souvenir
stands.
"After the ticket's been ripped
and fans are inside the fence, I don't
think our perimeter concourse
areas, as they stand now, are ade
quate to do both, provide space as
well as comfort." He indicated that
he was working on ways to ease this
potential problem.
"I'm anxious to get this one (the
Super Bowl game) under our belt
successfully," he said.
Last week Cummings traveled to
Tampa Bay to observe Super Bowl
preparations prior to and particu
larly on game day. "Our involve
ment is primarily on the day of the
game."
Cummings said a small number of
tickets will be made available to stu
dents, probably to be distributed by
lottery.
"There's going to be a few tickets
available to students. As the game
nears and we know how many we'll
have available, we'll set up some
kind of (ticket lottery) program," he
said.
Tickets for this year's Super Bowl
ran at a minimum of $60 so the ticket
price will probably remain near this
level.
According to Cummings, the idea
of Stanford hosting a Super Bowl
began with the San Francisco Bay
Super Bowl Task Force, a group of
Bay Area officials who had been
considering plans for the Bay Area
to hold a Super Bowl for several
years.
"As part of the community we
joined the task force. It (a Bay Area
Super Bowl) has been something
that NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle
has been considering for a long per
iod of time," he said.
The task force approached Athlet
ic Director Andy Geiger several
times in the past, but in the spring of
1982, Cummings said, "It was finally
discussed with (University Presi
dent) Donald Kennedy and ap
proved. The NFL then awarded the
game to us a year ago."
Cummings said the Stanford
Stadium is the "only stadium in the
Bay Area that meets the NFL's
stadium requirements." One of
those requirements is that the
seating capacity tops 70,000-plus
spectators.

for holding food or game programs.
After the game, fans would be able
to take them home as souvenirs, but
Cummings said the plan was "not
final."

SUPER SITE: Stanford Stadium, the site of the 1985 Super Bowl, is going to be renovated in a joint effort by
the NFL and Stanford, with an estimated cost of more than $2 million.
Cummings said he was
"concerned about the amount of
space it takes to stage the game-day
activities" inside of the gate. These
activities include press services,
concessions booths and souvenir
stands.
"After the ticket's been ripped
and fans are inside the fence, I don't
think our perimeter concourse
areas, as they stand now, are ade
quate to do both, provide space as
well as comfort." He indicated that
he was working on ways to ease this
potential problem.
"I'm anxious to get this one (the
Super Bowl game) under our belt
successfully," he said.
Last week Cummings traveled to
Tampa Bay to observe Super Bowl
preparations prior to and particu
larly on game day. "Our involve
ment is primarily on the day of the
game."
Cummings said a small number of
tickets will be made available to stu
dents, probably to be distributed by
lottery.
"There's going to be a few tickets
available to students. As the game
nears and we know how many we'll
have available, we'll set up some
kind of (ticket lottery) program," he
said.
Tickets for this year's Super Bowl
ran at a minimum of $60 so the ticket
price will probably remain near this
level.
According to Cummings, the idea
of Stanford hosting a Super Bowl
began with the San Francisco Bay
Super Bowl Task Force, a group of
Bay Area officials who had been
considering plans for the Bay Area
to hold a Super Bowl for several
years.
"As part of the community we
joined the task force. It (a Bay Area
Super Bowl) has been something
that NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle
has been considering for a long per
iod of time," he said.
The task force approached Athlet
ic Director Andy Geiger several
times in the past, but in the spring of
1982, Cummings said, "It was finally
discussed with (University Presi
dent) Donald Kennedy and ap
proved. The NFL then awarded the
game to us a year ago."
Cummings said the Stanford
Stadium is the "only stadium in the
Bay Area that meets the NFL's
stadium requirements." One of
those requirements is that the
seating capacity tops 70,000-plus
spectators.
Large-scale renovations on Stan
ford Stadium's press box, locker
rooms, ticket booths and conces
sions areas began this week in prep
aration for Super Bowl XIX, which
will be held here next January.
Associate Director of Athletics
Alan Cummings said he hopes the
game, the first National Football
League (NFL) championship to be
held in the Bay Area, "will give posi
tive exposure to the athletic pro
gram here at Stanford.
"The renovation of the press box
began this week," said Cummings,
who is in charge of stadium manage
ment for the game, which is sched
uled for Jan. 25, 1985.
The NFL will pay for the new press
area and temporary lighting at a
projected cost of about $400,000,
Cummings said .
The total cost of the improve

ments to be paid for by the Univer
sity including the locker rooms,
ticket booths and concession areas
is expected to run about $1.15 mil
lion.
The Athletic Department has
already initiated a fund-raising pro
gram with an intended goal of
$750,000. "We're about halfway
there. It's going very well Cum
mings said. The University will pay
the remaining costs.
"The plans and specifications for
a locker facility and the ticket,
restroom and concession facilities
are out to bid now," Cummings
said, "and we hope to have the
building permit around Feb. 1. We
don't anticipate any problem
meeting the construction
schedule."
All of these major improvements
should be in place by July 1, when
Stanford Stadium hosts nine sum
mer Olympic soccer matches.

"The other work we're going to
be doing involves some utilities sys
tems work (electrical, water and
plumbing), seating for the physically
limited and handrailings, but these
don't require the same scope of
planning," Cummings • said.
"There's a lot of work to be done
but it's manageable."
The wooden benches will remain
at Stanford Stadium, however.
"The magnitude of replacing the
bench seating is beyond our
capacity," Cummings said. But he
also said the NFL was looking into
installing temporary seat cushions
before the game. These cushions
are square and fold down with a flap
for holding food or game programs.
After the game, fans would be able
to take them home as souvenirs, but
Cummings said the plan was "not
