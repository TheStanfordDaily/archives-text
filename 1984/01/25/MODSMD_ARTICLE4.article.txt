Large-scale renovations on Stan
ford Stadium's press box, locker
rooms, ticket booths and conces
sions areas began this week in prep
aration for Super Bowl XIX, which
will be held here next January.
Associate Director of Athletics
Alan Cummings said he hopes the
game, the first National Football
League (NFL) championship to be
held in the Bay Area, "will give posi
tive exposure to the athletic pro
gram here at Stanford.
"The renovation of the press box
began this week," said Cummings,
who is in charge of stadium manage
ment for the game, which is sched
uled for Jan. 25, 1985.
The NFL will pay for the new press
area and temporary lighting at a
projected cost of about $400,000,
Cummings said .
The total cost of the improve

ments to be paid for by the Univer
sity including the locker rooms,
ticket booths and concession areas
is expected to run about $1.15 mil
lion.
The Athletic Department has
already initiated a fund-raising pro
gram with an intended goal of
$750,000. "We're about halfway
there. It's going very well Cum
mings said. The University will pay
the remaining costs.
"The plans and specifications for
a locker facility and the ticket,
restroom and concession facilities
are out to bid now," Cummings
said, "and we hope to have the
building permit around Feb. 1. We
don't anticipate any problem
meeting the construction
schedule."
All of these major improvements
should be in place by July 1, when
Stanford Stadium hosts nine sum
mer Olympic soccer matches.

"The other work we're going to
be doing involves some utilities sys
tems work (electrical, water and
plumbing), seating for the physically
limited and handrailings, but these
don't require the same scope of
planning," Cummings â€¢ said.
"There's a lot of work to be done
but it's manageable."
The wooden benches will remain
at Stanford Stadium, however.
"The magnitude of replacing the
bench seating is beyond our
capacity," Cummings said. But he
also said the NFL was looking into
installing temporary seat cushions
before the game. These cushions
are square and fold down with a flap
for holding food or game programs.
After the game, fans would be able
to take them home as souvenirs, but
Cummings said the plan was "not
final."
