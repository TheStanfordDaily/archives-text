# University names facilities manager

Amy Blue became one of Stanford's highest ranking
female managers last week when she was named direc
tor of the male-dominated facilities and services de
partment.
At 40, Blue is no stranger to high-level responsibility.
She has worked for Stanford nearly nine years: as an as
sistant to the provost in academic planning from 1972 to
1974 and as assistant provost from 1974 to 1978, when
she left Stanford for a management position at Ohio
State University. She returned in 1980 to head facilities
project management and engineering, overseeing 290
construction projects worth $220 million.
I m very excited about my new position," Blue said
after her appointment by William Massy, vice president
of business and finance. As director of facilities and
services, Blue will manage her previous post as well as
the University's operations and maintenance, utilities
and housing and food services. In sum, she will be re
sponsible for four departments, 580 employees and an
operating budget of $51 million.
But Blue and others are confident she can handle the

job. "I am sure of my abilities," said Blue, "though I'll
admit I felt anxiety when I came to this department
three years ago and had to deal with engineers and ar
chitects. I soon realized that their technical skills and
my managerial skills could function easily together."
Massy and co-workers agree that Blue is able and
qualified. "Blue's appointment was based on her excel
lent track record, on her ability to bring people to
gether," Massy said. Co-worker Curt Williams, director
of engineering, said "she has all the right qualifica
tions."
While co-workers praised Blue's qualifications and
abilities, it is possible she may face special problems as
a woman manager of an overwhelmingly male
dominated department.
Bob Nerrie, manager of University projects, said that
while he has no problems working for a woman, he
doesn't "think that all men can accept a woman as a
boss." He added that "she's not going to face any
problems. But some men will."
But Blue says no one feels threatened, neither she
