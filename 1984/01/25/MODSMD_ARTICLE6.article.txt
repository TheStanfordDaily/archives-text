Soviets want talks renewed
Moscow — President Yuri Andropov
assured the United States yesterday that the
oviet Union wants to reopen a dialogue on
arms control, but he challenged the Reagan
administration to produce concrete new of
iiccJ^ 6 ' S no nee d to convince us of the
A n H U nPSS anc^. ex P e dience of dialogue,"
Sa n an ' nter view to be pub
daily ° ' n Prav<^a 'the Communist party
thprp'L^ Viel ' ea dership is convinced that
sion nf ' S S P o^ s '^"' t ' es for a serious discus
a num t>er of problems," Andropov

observed, but added, "Dialogue should not
be conducted for the sake of dialogue. It
should be directed at the attainment of con
crete accords."
"We expect of the government of the
United States of America practical deeds.
This will find an appropriate response from
us."
Andropov's remarks, distributed by the of
ficial news agency Tass, were clearly meant
as the Kremlin's formal reply to President
Reagan's address of Jan. 16, in which he
called for "constructive cooperation" with
the Soviet Union, including renewed arms
reduction talks.
The Soviet leader's statement was relative
ly restrained and measured in tone. It in
cluded standard Soviet charges that the

United Stales bears full responsibility for the
collapse of the Geneva talks on medium
range nuclear missiles and the general
heightening ot East-West tensions. But it was
notably free of the vitriolic rhetoric that
marked Foreign Minister Andrei Cromyko's
speech last week at the opening of the
European Security Conference in Stockholm.
The cooling of Soviet rhetoric appears to
be a response to the conciliatory tone of
Reagan's speech last week.
Andropov nevertheless said it appeared
that the Reagan administration, while
seeking renewed contacts with Moscow, had
not given up what he called "its negative ap
proach."
Reagan reassures Congress
Washington — President Reagan, seeking to
defuse congressional calls for the withdrawal of
Marines from Beirut, visited Capitol Hill yesterday to
urge Senate Republicans to resist election-year chal
lenges to his Middle East policies.
"In Lebanon, the peace progress has been slow
and painful, but we've rmde genuine progress,"
Reagan said.
As he addressed his political allies in the Senate,
Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.), said more than
half the House Democrats who voted to back the
continued presence of Marines in Lebanon now
changed their minds.
"They would vote for the president to move them
(1600 U.S. Marines) and to cut off funds," O'Neill
said.
In a closed portion of his meeting with most of the
55 Senate Republicans, Reagan gave general answers
to about a dozen questions on Lebanon, taxes, the
federal and other issues likely to be raised on
Cap'tol Hili during the shortened election-year ses
sion.
He has to return to Capitol Hill tonight to deliver
his State of the Union address to a joint session of
Congress.
Those at yesterday's meeting said Reagan urged
unity among COP Senate members, but offered no
specific reasons to believe the Marines can leave
Beirut soon, or that there will be any major effort to
reduce federal deficits of almost $200 billion.
Donald Rumsfeld, Reagan s Middle East
negotiator, also was present yesterday briefing Sen
ate Majority Leader Howard Baker, (R-Tenn.), Senate

Armed Service Committee Chairman )ohn Tower (R-
Texas), members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee and O'Neill.
Baker said diplomatic efforts are under way in the
United Nations and elsewhere to bring Lebanon's
warring factions together, but gave no indication
Rumsfeld reported significant progress.
Asked if there should be a pullout, Baker said he
would back Reagan while efforts to negotiate an
agreement continued.
Consumer price rise slows
Washington — Consumer costs rose 3.8 percent in
1983, the least since the price-controlled years of
1971-72, the government said yesterday. President
Reagan's chief economist called it "outstanding"
and private analysts agreed inflation appears "down
for the count."
Prices rose 3.9 percent in 1982, after shooting up
12.4 percent in 1980 and 3.9 in 1981.
Stock market closes mixed
New York — The stock market closed mixed yes
terday following an afternoon attempt at a rally
fizzled out. But many energy issues turned in a
strong showing in an active session on Wall Street.
The Dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped
1.57 to 1242.88, recordings its fifth straight loss.
Since Jan. 7 the average has fallen 43.76 points.

Soviets want talks renewed
Moscow — President Yuri Andropov
assured the United States yesterday that the
oviet Union wants to reopen a dialogue on
arms control, but he challenged the Reagan
administration to produce concrete new of
iiccJ^ 6 ' S no nee d to convince us of the
A n H U nPSS anc^. ex P e dience of dialogue,"
Sa n an ' nter view to be pub
daily ° ' n Prav<^a 'the Communist party
thprp'L^ Viel ' ea dership is convinced that
sion nf ' S S P o^ s '^"' t ' es for a serious discus
a num t>er of problems," Andropov

observed, but added, "Dialogue should not
be conducted for the sake of dialogue. It
should be directed at the attainment of con
crete accords."
"We expect of the government of the
United States of America practical deeds.
This will find an appropriate response from
us."
Andropov's remarks, distributed by the of
ficial news agency Tass, were clearly meant
as the Kremlin's formal reply to President
Reagan's address of Jan. 16, in which he
called for "constructive cooperation" with
the Soviet Union, including renewed arms
reduction talks.
The Soviet leader's statement was relative
ly restrained and measured in tone. It in
cluded standard Soviet charges that the

United Stales bears full responsibility for the
collapse of the Geneva talks on medium
range nuclear missiles and the general
heightening ot East-West tensions. But it was
notably free of the vitriolic rhetoric that
marked Foreign Minister Andrei Cromyko's
speech last week at the opening of the
European Security Conference in Stockholm.
The cooling of Soviet rhetoric appears to
be a response to the conciliatory tone of
Reagan's speech last week.
Andropov nevertheless said it appeared
that the Reagan administration, while
seeking renewed contacts with Moscow, had
not given up what he called "its negative ap
proach."
Reagan reassures Congress
Washington — President Reagan, seeking to
defuse congressional calls for the withdrawal of
Marines from Beirut, visited Capitol Hill yesterday to
urge Senate Republicans to resist election-year chal
lenges to his Middle East policies.
"In Lebanon, the peace progress has been slow
and painful, but we've rmde genuine progress,"
Reagan said.
As he addressed his political allies in the Senate,
Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.), said more than
half the House Democrats who voted to back the
continued presence of Marines in Lebanon now
changed their minds.
"They would vote for the president to move them
(1600 U.S. Marines) and to cut off funds," O'Neill
said.
In a closed portion of his meeting with most of the
55 Senate Republicans, Reagan gave general answers
to about a dozen questions on Lebanon, taxes, the
federal and other issues likely to be raised on
Cap'tol Hili during the shortened election-year ses
sion.
He has to return to Capitol Hill tonight to deliver
his State of the Union address to a joint session of
