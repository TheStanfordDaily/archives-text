Soviets want talks renewed
Moscow — President Yuri Andropov
assured the United States yesterday that the
oviet Union wants to reopen a dialogue on
arms control, but he challenged the Reagan
administration to produce concrete new of
iiccJ^ 6 ' S no nee d to convince us of the
A n H U nPSS anc^. ex P e dience of dialogue,"
Sa n an ' nter view to be pub

thprp'L^ Viel ' ea dership is convinced that
sion nf ' S S P o^ s '^"' t ' es for a serious discus
a num t>er of problems," Andropov

observed, but added, "Dialogue should not
be conducted for the sake of dialogue. It
should be directed at the attainment of con
crete accords."
"We expect of the government of the
United States of America practical deeds.
This will find an appropriate response from
us."
Andropov's remarks, distributed by the of
ficial news agency Tass, were clearly meant
as the Kremlin's formal reply to President
Reagan's address of Jan. 16, in which he
called for "constructive cooperation" with
the Soviet Union, including renewed arms
reduction talks.
The Soviet leader's statement was relative
ly restrained and measured in tone. It in
cluded standard Soviet charges that the

United Stales bears full responsibility for the
collapse of the Geneva talks on medium
range nuclear missiles and the general
heightening ot East-West tensions. But it was
notably free of the vitriolic rhetoric that
marked Foreign Minister Andrei Cromyko's
speech last week at the opening of the
European Security Conference in Stockholm.
The cooling of Soviet rhetoric appears to
be a response to the conciliatory tone of
Reagan's speech last week.
Andropov nevertheless said it appeared
that the Reagan administration, while
seeking renewed contacts with Moscow, had
not given up what he called "its negative ap
proach."
