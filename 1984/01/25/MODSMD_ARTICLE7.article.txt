# Protest charge against EE professor dropped

### KEN CHAVEZ 
The Alameda County deputy dis
trict attorney yesterday dropped a
misdemeanor charge against Robert
Kincheloe, an emeritus professor in
electrical engineering, for obstruct
ing traffic during a protest at the
Lawrence Livermore National Labo
ratory last June.
Kincheloe, who was arrested with
his son Wyll and more than 1000
other protesters, said he had hoped
the charge would not be dropped so
he could express his opposition to
the facility's testing of nuclear weap
ons.
The protesters were charged with
a misdemeanor of willfully and mali
ciously obstructing traffic. But
Kincheloe said police had already
barricaded the roads when
protesters arrived.
By going to trial, Kincheloe said
he hoped to raise issues concerning
nuclear weapons, something that
was not permitted during the large
representative trials last week where
one person spoke for the entire
group.
"By defense department es
timates (nuclear weapons) would
kill 500 million people if a confronta
tion between the United States and
the Soviet Union occurs,"
Kincheloe said.
Kincheloe said he is also con
cerned with possible malfunctions
of the electronic equipment govern
ing such weapons. As a member of
the Electrical Engineering Depart
ment since 1951, Kincheloe said, "I

know electronics are fallible. I was a
radar officer in World War 11, and I
know radars can have false targets."
Kincheloe said he protested at
Livermore because, "I was trying to
make the strongest statement I
could personally, especially to some
of the people at Livermore."
All 1000 protesters spent 11 days
from the time of their arrest until
their arraignment at the Santa Rita
jail in Alameda County, Kincheloe
said.
Kincheloe faced a maximum of six
months imprisonment if he was
tried and found guilty. But he said
he only expected to receive a sen
tence for the time he had already
served last June before the arraign
ment.
Charges were dropped yesterday
for Kincheloe, his son and seven
other defendants just before jury se
lection procedures were scheduled
to begin.
Kincheloe had joined a separate
21-member group called the
Livermore 21 Defense group which
wanted to be tried separately from
the other protesters arrested
Livermore 21 wanted to have an in
dividual group trial in which each
defendant would be tried sepa
rately.
Jury selection continued yester
day as scheduled for the 11 other
members of the Livermore 21 group
who are still being charged. One
member of the group pleaded guilty
with a sentence of time already
served.
