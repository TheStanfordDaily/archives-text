### TINA MARIE BASKIN 
Condoleezza Rice hasn't
missed a beat. From accom
plished pianist to competitive
figure skater to assistant politi
)l s( ipnce professor, Rice has
proven herself an able per
former behind the keys, on
h' <ce and in the classroom.
V\ hile her current area of
i'<pertise is arms control,
n >!itics have always been a
part of Rice's life. Her child
hood was strongly influenced
by the racial conflict arising
from the civil rights move
ment. She lived in Birming
ham. Ala., up until the age of
13.
When her father was ap
pointed assistant dean of arts
>iid sciences at the University
Denver the family moved to
olorado. Then as a 15-year
■ d, she was admitted to the
university and studied music.
At this time in her life she
thought that music was her
filing. "Actually, I never real
chose it. It was always there
since I was three and my fa
ther told me that when I
learned to play the piano I
could have one."

Little did her father know
that it would take her only one
day to learn how to play.
Her unique name reflects
her musical upbringing. Her
family had been deeply in
volved in music for three
generations, and it was a tradi
tion in her family for the wo
men to be given Italian names.
Her mother, a talented
musician, named her after the
Italian musical term con dolce,
meaning "with sweetness".
As a junior in college she
realized that political science,
rather than music, was her
true calling.
"Political science really in
terested me. I had really lived
and breathed politics. When I
was growing up life was
changing so rapidly. There
was the civil rights struggle,
Viet Nam, U.S.-Soviet rela
tions. I was in the heart of all
of it," she said.
After taking courses in So
viet politics and international
relations, she realized that she
was more interested in foreign
rather than domestic affairs
and entered a Ph.D. program.
Her interest in international

relations was a lasting one.
Rice became an assistant pro
fessor of political science here
in 1981. She also became assis
tant director of what is now
the Center for International
Security and Arms Control,
and is one of the 16 core fac

ulty who make the Center a
leader in its field.
Rice describes present U.S-
Soviet relations as weak. "We
have undergone lots of
shocks: the Korean incident,
the break down of arms talks.
It is going to take more than

patience, it's going to take
some skillful leadership, too,"
she said.
"I don't see our chances of
coming to blows with each
other now as any greater than
two to three years ago. But our
chances of cooperation are

definitely less. So in this sense
we've lost a great deal."
Rice said she sees no imme
diate solutions to the problem
of U.S.-Soviet relations.
"The wild swings in negotia
tions put us in a position of
having to start over and this is
very disturbing. I think that in
order to develop something
secure we need to work
steadily. I don't see much time
to keep starting over."
Rice said the United States
needs a more pragmatic ap
proach. "I agreed with the
president's speech, that we
don't have to like the Soviet
system to cooperate. We
don't have to cnange them it is
true, but one speech is not
going to change our relations.
I see it fit to come up with an
arms control agreement and
stop calling each other
names."
"In international politics
there is something called cor
rect relations — that is we
need to keep below visceral
attacks on each other," Rice
said."lt's the difference be

tween an intellectual argu
ment and name-calling. The
crisis won't get any better un
til we're able to manage with
out name-calling."
Rice pursues her hobbies
with a similar determination.
"I love sports of any kind. I es
pecially love to participate. I
was a competitive ice skater
when I was younger, but I felt
I was too old to compete so I
got involved with tennis."
She laughs, "Since I have no
aspirations about winning
Wimbledon, it's great." Rice
loves football as well. "I went
to every Stanford game. As
you can see sports comprise
most of my free time."
Rice continues to play the
piano and , with friends, par
ticipates in a chamber music
group.
Rice said she has no long
term goals for the future."l
learned never to plan too
much ahead because in 1973 I
was still a music major. I do set
up intermediate goals and
have a long term vision which
I can get to in a number of
ways," she said.
