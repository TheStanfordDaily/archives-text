### SHIRISH DATE Staff writer 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)
yesterday reiterated his stance
that if elected president, he
would immediately and inde
pendently invoke a freeze on all
testing and deployment of nu
clear weapons if the Soviet
Union agreed to do the same.
Speaking to an audience of
about 630 in an overflowing
Kresge Auditorium, Cranston, a
Stanford alumnus and a can
didate for the Democratic
nomination for the presidency,
declared "peace and jobs" to
be the principal objectives of
his campaign. The California
senator spent the majority of his
time expressing his conviction
that a bilateral nuclear freeze
must be of paramount impor
tance on the presidential
agenda.
Cranston expressed confi
dence in his political and fund
raising campaign to date. He
claimed to have enough funds
to not be outspent by either
former Vice President Walter
Mondale or Sen. |ohn Glenn
(D-Ohio) in the lowa caucuses
Feb. 20 or the New Hampshire

and Maine primaries. Cranston
said he hopes to emerge from
the first round of primaries run
ning a strong third.
Cranston, citing the possibili
ty of accidental nuclear war and
the enormous economic costs
of sustaining an arms race,
pledged that his first action
upon inauguration would be to
announce "that the United
States would test and deploy no
more nuclear weapons, as long
as the Soviets refrained from
testing or deploying."
Cranston also promised that
he would "get in touch with the
Soviet leader and urge that we
get together at the earliest pos
sible moment ... to discuss
further steps to halt production,
to achieve an overall freeze,
and then start the task of reduc
ing the stockpiles, reducing the
targeting, reducing the
dangers, reducing the cost."
On the question of the eco
nomy, Cranston proposed a
three-part plan to get the
United States back to "full pro
duction and full employment."
First, Cranston proposed
lowering interest rates by
"overcoming the incredible

deficits that Ronald Reagan has
handed us" and moving
"toward a balanced budget."
He also wants to change Federal
Reserve Board policy "to permit
the slow, steady, predictable
growth of the money supply."
Second, Cranston advocated
investment in American indus
try "through a national devel
opment bank that will provide
low interest rate loans" to ailing
basic industries as well as new
industries that promised new
jobs in economically troubled
localities.
"Third," said Cranston, "we
need to invest in America's
workers through job training,
retraining education," and
"fostering policies that give
workers the incentive to be pro
ductive."
Noting that each one million
people unemployed means,
through a decrease in tax reve
nues as well as an increase in
outlays, a cost of $30 billion,
Cranston said he hopes to attain
full employment within four
years of election. He defined
full employment as a 4 percent
unemployment level.
