# '80s activism : channelled into academics?
## 
### Shirish Date 
The year is not 1965. It is
not 1968, nor is it 1970.
Stanford politics, and
indeed most campus politics,
lack the fire and sense of ur
gency that characterized the
politics of 15 years ago.
Not that interest in political
issues is non-existent. Judging
by the number and variety of
politically related courses of
fered here, political awareness
seems to be a growing student
concern.
Course offerings such as
"Nutritional Problems of Devel
oping Nations," "Theory of
Capitalist Development,"
"Labor and the Classes in the
Novel" and "Social Inequality
and Social Stratification" can be
found in such diverse depart
ments as anthropology, eco
nomics, English and sociology.
But there are some courses
which have a tendency to be
seen, for one reason or an
other, as more one-sided or
missionary in their approach
than the average Stanford class.
These include "Arms Control
and Disarmament" in the Politi
cal Science Department, the In
struments of U.S. Foreign Policy
sophomore seminar and many
of the SWOPSI offerings.
Some students suspect
that "Instruments of
U.S. Foreign Policy" is

slanted right of the political
center because the instructor,
George Marotta, is a senior re
search fellow at the Hoover In
stitution.
The connection between
Hoover and the conservative
wing of the Republican party
has been the subject of various
campus debate and rhetoric.
But closer scrutiny may con
tradict the notion that the class
is a mere conservative in
doctrination.
With experience in Army in
telligence, the State Depart
ment, the Defense Department
and the staff of the National Se
curity Council, Marotta seems
well-qualified to teach a course
that primarily purports a realist
perspective.
J J A rms Control and
/\ Disarmament"
/\ suffers from a
similar, though perhaps in
verted, misconception. The
name alone may give the im
pression that the course is in
some way affiliated with the
newly popular nuclear freeze
movement.
But Political Science Prof.
)ohn Lewis, course instructor
and director of the Center for
International Security and Arms
Control, denies these charges.
The courses examines the his
tory, weapons systems, super
power doctrines and negotia
tions of the arms race, accor

ding to Lewis. Though the
course "concentrates on nu
clear weapons and U.S.-Soviet
relations," Lewis explains that
the class also looks at non
nuclear weapons and the dis
armament efforts of countries
other than the superpowers.

SWOPSI courses, which
are political in nature,
are subject to two dis
tinct misperceptions. One is
that SWOPSI classes are less
rigorous academically than
mainstream University offer
ings. Second, many students
and faculty members feel that
SWOPSI classes, designed and
taught by students, are gener
ally less impartial than standard
departmental fare.
The fallacy of both of the no
tions may become apparent
upon more careful investiga
tion. Of the four randomly cho
sen politically oriented classes
examined, the average reading
load was 1500 pages, with an
average of two required papers
and a final project.
Charles Mehl, a senior major
ing in history, teaches a class
called "Revolutions in Latin
America." "I'm a historian.
I'm not a revolutionary or an
ideologue with a particular
viewpoint to sell," he says.
While Mehl says that he has

taken SWOPSI courses where
the instructor has a particular
political bias, the senior adds
that he at the same time
"questions the objectivity in
some political science and his
tory courses."
"It's difficult to be completely
objective," he says.
One Stanford instruc
tor who admits to not
being "objective" is
Political Science Prof. Richard
Fagen. Fagen teaches a course
called "Socialism in Latin
America" in which he quite
openly sypathizes with Cuban
President Fidel Castro in Cuba,
the Sandinistas in Nicaragua
and Salvador Allende, the
deposed president of Chile.
Fagen defends his admittedly
left-wing sympathy by arguing
that the burden of a balanced
viewpoint falls not on the indi
vidual instructor, but on the
University as a whole. "The
point of view that I have is un
derrepresented, not over
represented," he adds.

"Labor and the Classes in the
Novel" and "Social Inequality
and Social Stratification" can be
found in such diverse depart
ments as anthropology, eco
nomics, English and sociology.
But there are some courses
which have a tendency to be
seen, for one reason or an
other, as more one-sided or
missionary in their approach
than the average Stanford class.
These include "Arms Control
and Disarmament" in the Politi
cal Science Department, the In
struments of U.S. Foreign Policy
sophomore seminar and many
of the SWOPSI offerings.
Some students suspect
that "Instruments of
U.S. Foreign Policy" is

slanted right of the political
center because the instructor,
George Marotta, is a senior re
search fellow at the Hoover In
stitution.
The connection between
Hoover and the conservative
wing of the Republican party
has been the subject of various
campus debate and rhetoric.
But closer scrutiny may con
tradict the notion that the class
is a mere conservative in
doctrination.
With experience in Army in
telligence, the State Depart
ment, the Defense Department
and the staff of the National Se
curity Council, Marotta seems
well-qualified to teach a course
that primarily purports a realist
perspective.
J J A rms Control and
/\ Disarmament"
/\ suffers from a
similar, though perhaps in
verted, misconception. The
name alone may give the im
pression that the course is in
some way affiliated with the
newly popular nuclear freeze
movement.
But Political Science Prof.
)ohn Lewis, course instructor
and director of the Center for
International Security and Arms
Control, denies these charges.
The courses examines the his
tory, weapons systems, super
power doctrines and negotia
tions of the arms race, accor

ding to Lewis. Though the
course "concentrates on nu
clear weapons and U.S.-Soviet
relations," Lewis explains that
the class also looks at non
nuclear weapons and the dis
armament efforts of countries
other than the superpowers.

SWOPSI courses, which
are political in nature,
are subject to two dis
tinct misperceptions. One is
that SWOPSI classes are less
rigorous academically than
mainstream University offer
ings. Second, many students
and faculty members feel that
SWOPSI classes, designed and
taught by students, are gener
ally less impartial than standard
departmental fare.
The fallacy of both of the no
tions may become apparent
upon more careful investiga
tion. Of the four randomly cho
sen politically oriented classes
examined, the average reading
load was 1500 pages, with an
average of two required papers
and a final project.
Charles Mehl, a senior major
ing in history, teaches a class
called "Revolutions in Latin
America." "I'm a historian.
I'm not a revolutionary or an
ideologue with a particular
viewpoint to sell," he says.
While Mehl says that he has

taken SWOPSI courses where
the instructor has a particular
political bias, the senior adds
that he at the same time
"questions the objectivity in
some political science and his
tory courses."
"It's difficult to be completely
objective," he says.
One Stanford instruc
tor who admits to not
being "objective" is
Political Science Prof. Richard
Fagen. Fagen teaches a course
called "Socialism in Latin
America" in which he quite
openly sypathizes with Cuban
President Fidel Castro in Cuba,
the Sandinistas in Nicaragua
and Salvador Allende, the
deposed president of Chile.
Fagen defends his admittedly
left-wing sympathy by arguing
that the burden of a balanced
viewpoint falls not on the indi
vidual instructor, but on the
University as a whole. "The
point of view that I have is un
derrepresented, not over
represented," he adds.
