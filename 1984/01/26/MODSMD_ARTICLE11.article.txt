# Those strong, silent Stanford conservatives
## 
### Steve Trousdale 
The campus con
servatives.
They're under there
somewhere, a substrata of stu
dents and faculty, buried
beneath layers of what some
call the liberal biases of a liberal
arts education.
At least that's what several
conservative leaders here say.
But if they do exist — and of
course they do, and in force —
why do they seem so quiet?
In part, conservative leaders
say, the historical invisibility of
the conservative side stems
from the nature of the philoso
phy — conservatives do not
usually "man the barricades"
and participate in activist
politics.
"Liberals are very vocal —
you can see that on the opinion
and editorial pages of The Dai
ly," says Robert Larkins, a
senior who is active in conser
vative politics here. "I think
things here at Stanford will ride
along smoothly and then every
once in a while the left will
bring up an issue — you rarely
find the right bringing up an
issue."
And in part, this lack of ac
tivism in conservatism also
stems from the current political
landscape in America. Leon
Dayan, a columnist for The Dai
ly and junior majoring in his
tory, comments that
"conservatives are doing fairly
well . . . there's nothing really
to protest against."
Specifically, most con
servatives express satisfaction
with the current administration
and consider President Reagan
the best candidate for the
White House. They approve of
most — although by no means
all — of the Reagan administra
tion's policies.
But closer to home, con
servatives have rallied
around several issues
specific to Stanford.
According to David Eisner,
who edited the conservative
Stanford Review last year, there
is "a liberal bent to student

thought on campus;" through
The Review he tried to counter
this perceived bias.
If you read The Review last
year and are still looking around
campus for more recent edi
tions, your search will probably
continue to be fruitless, at least
for a while. The tabloid is no
longer published, due to time
constraints on Eisner — "it was
either my homework or the
paper," he says — and the lack
of other people to carry on con
servative projects.
So this year, although con
servatives have become in
volved in several issues, ac
tivism has been mostly ad hoc
and the movement as a whole
has remained quiet.
The Review fought against
what its architects consider the
liberal tilt of many of the institu
tions on campus. In case you
missed out last year, one of the
paper's favorite targets was Res
idential Education.
"I was especially upset about
the liberal policies of Res Ed,"
says Eisner, and The Review
projected the views of its
creator. Several stories ap
peared that were critical of Resi
dential Education's activities, al
leging that they emphasized the
liberal-left viewpoint with little
input from the conservative
side.
Eisner was particularly critical
of a Residential Education pro
gram called Fate of the Earth
Week, which he said was over
whelmingly tilted toward the
left. It presented, he said, two
sides, but one was anti-war
while the other position — the
conservative one — was ~ast as
pro-war.
Alice Supton, assistant dean
of Residental Education, denies
these charges and says that Fate
of the Earth Week was designed
"to stimulate discussion about
the nuclear issue" on a "wide
range of viewpoints."
Residential Education itself,
she said, "does not promote a
particular point of view."
But while the debate be
tween Res Ed and The
Review was silenced by

The Review's demise, con
servatives have managed to
channel their energy into other
avenues.
Certainly the most visible of
these has been the controversy
over the Hoover Institution and
the proposed Reagan library
complex. Although Larkins feels
that these issues involve aca
demic freedom and not politics,
others see them as an out
growth of the alleged liberal
bias here.
Eisner in particular is very cri
tical of those who have raised
the issue of Hoover's ap
propriateness on campus, and
is especially outspoken about
The Daily's role in the contro
versy.
He says the issue first gained
attention with a series of Daily
articles last spring on Hoover —
articles that were co-authored
by Michael Calabrese, a joint
ID/MBA degree student here
who, according to Eisner, had
indicated before the articles ap
peared that he was anti-Hoover.
Calabrese had also been a TA in
one of Political Science Prof.
John Manley's classes. Manley
is one of the most outspoken
opponents of Hoover.
Eisner, both in The Review
and during an interview, says
these articles were biased
against Hoover and
reprimanded The Daily for run
ning them, especially since
Calabrese had indicated his
anti-Hoover stance on the
opinions page of The Daily
before the articles appeared.
One example of his bias, Eis
ner contends, was the use of
quotation marks around the
word "scholar" when referring
to Hoover senior research fel
lows — as if Calabrese was at
tacking both their scholarship
and their partisanship.
In a letter published in The
Review, then-Daily editor Karen
Springen and current editor
Kristen Christopher defended
the stories, noting that
reporters often have personal
biases but that the articles in
question were fair and were in
The campus con
servatives.

The Daily's role in the contro
versy.
He says the issue first gained
attention with a series of Daily
articles last spring on Hoover —
articles that were co-authored
by Michael Calabrese, a joint
ID/MBA degree student here
who, according to Eisner, had
indicated before the articles ap
peared that he was anti-Hoover.
Calabrese had also been a TA in
one of Political Science Prof.
John Manley's classes. Manley
is one of the most outspoken
opponents of Hoover.
Eisner, both in The Review
and during an interview, says
these articles were biased
against Hoover and
reprimanded The Daily for run
ning them, especially since
Calabrese had indicated his
anti-Hoover stance on the
opinions page of The Daily
before the articles appeared.
One example of his bias, Eis
ner contends, was the use of
quotation marks around the
word "scholar" when referring
to Hoover senior research fel
lows — as if Calabrese was at
tacking both their scholarship
and their partisanship.
In a letter published in The
Review, then-Daily editor Karen
Springen and current editor
Kristen Christopher defended
the stories, noting that
reporters often have personal
biases but that the articles in
question were fair and were in
The campus con
servatives.
They're under there
somewhere, a substrata of stu
dents and faculty, buried
beneath layers of what some
call the liberal biases of a liberal
arts education.
At least that's what several
conservative leaders here say.
But if they do exist — and of
course they do, and in force —
why do they seem so quiet?
In part, conservative leaders
say, the historical invisibility of
the conservative side stems
from the nature of the philoso
phy — conservatives do not
usually "man the barricades"
and participate in activist
politics.
"Liberals are very vocal —
you can see that on the opinion
and editorial pages of The Dai
ly," says Robert Larkins, a
senior who is active in conser
vative politics here. "I think
things here at Stanford will ride
along smoothly and then every
once in a while the left will
bring up an issue — you rarely
find the right bringing up an
issue."
And in part, this lack of ac
tivism in conservatism also
stems from the current political
landscape in America. Leon
Dayan, a columnist for The Dai
ly and junior majoring in his
tory, comments that
"conservatives are doing fairly
well . . . there's nothing really
to protest against."
Specifically, most con
servatives express satisfaction
with the current administration
and consider President Reagan
the best candidate for the
White House. They approve of
most — although by no means
all — of the Reagan administra
tion's policies.
But closer to home, con
servatives have rallied
around several issues
specific to Stanford.
According to David Eisner,
who edited the conservative
Stanford Review last year, there
is "a liberal bent to student

thought on campus;" through
The Review he tried to counter
this perceived bias.
If you read The Review last
year and are still looking around
campus for more recent edi
tions, your search will probably
continue to be fruitless, at least
for a while. The tabloid is no
longer published, due to time
constraints on Eisner — "it was
either my homework or the
paper," he says — and the lack
of other people to carry on con
servative projects.
So this year, although con
servatives have become in
volved in several issues, ac
tivism has been mostly ad hoc
and the movement as a whole
has remained quiet.
The Review fought against
what its architects consider the
liberal tilt of many of the institu
tions on campus. In case you
missed out last year, one of the
paper's favorite targets was Res
idential Education.
"I was especially upset about
the liberal policies of Res Ed,"
says Eisner, and The Review
projected the views of its
creator. Several stories ap
peared that were critical of Resi
dential Education's activities, al
leging that they emphasized the
liberal-left viewpoint with little
input from the conservative
side.
Eisner was particularly critical
of a Residential Education pro
gram called Fate of the Earth
Week, which he said was over
whelmingly tilted toward the
left. It presented, he said, two
sides, but one was anti-war
while the other position — the
conservative one — was ~ast as
pro-war.
Alice Supton, assistant dean
of Residental Education, denies
these charges and says that Fate
of the Earth Week was designed
"to stimulate discussion about
the nuclear issue" on a "wide
range of viewpoints."
Residential Education itself,
she said, "does not promote a
particular point of view."
But while the debate be
tween Res Ed and The
Review was silenced by

The Review's demise, con
servatives have managed to
channel their energy into other
avenues.
Certainly the most visible of
these has been the controversy
over the Hoover Institution and
the proposed Reagan library
complex. Although Larkins feels
that these issues involve aca
demic freedom and not politics,
others see them as an out
growth of the alleged liberal
bias here.
Eisner in particular is very cri
tical of those who have raised
the issue of Hoover's ap
propriateness on campus, and
is especially outspoken about
The Daily's role in the contro
versy.
