# STANFORD CONSERVATIVE REVIEW

response to events on campus,
and not attempts to make news.
One of the ad hoc groups that
developed at least partly out of
the Hoover controversy is Stu
dents for the Presidential Com
plex (SPC), a group started to
counter SCAReU, or Stanford
Community Against Reagan
University.
SPC has supported the
presidential complex, while
SCAReU opposes some parts of
the proposal — most notably
the close ties of the Hoover In
stitution to the proposed public
policy center.
Conservatives again criticize
The Daily's coverage of the con
troversy, saying that it is often
one-sided. For instance,
Larkins, in comparing the
coverage of SCAReU and SPC,
notes that SPC has never been
featured except in in conjunc
tion with SCAReU. He considers
this another example of the
liberal bias of The Daily.
But besides SPC there
seems to be little con
servative activism on
campus, but many con
servatives would like this to
change. Larkins says he wishes
to resurrect The Stanford Con
servative Forum, which in the
past sponsored debates and
conservative speakers on

campus. Forming such a group,
he said, would be "to try to
have a little balance — the vast
majority of speakers here are
not in any way approaching
conservative."
Eisner says he would like to
revive The Stanford Review as
an eight-to-16 page paper, both
as an alternative to The Daily
and as a participant in the
campus political discussion. He
would also like to reorganize
the Stanford Conservative Poli
tical Association, which was al
most synonymous with The
Review although the two were
actually independent organiza
tions.
Other conservatives are in
volving themselves in the up
coming Reagan-Bush campaign
— most seem to believe Reagan
will run again — and are putting
on hold any plans for a campus
conservative group.
But if the past is any indica
tion, the political right here will
remain an uncohesive move
ment, numerically strong but
usually unorganized, and only
galvanized into action by what
they perceive as threats to their
cause. As Dayan says, "Just in
general, conservatives aren't
active . . . possibly because
they're not trying to change
anything."
