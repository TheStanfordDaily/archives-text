The few. The chosen. The
summer interns.
Every year, right after
Christmas break, college stu
dents begin to hunt for that per
fect political internship.
Thousands jam the mail,
phones and streets — they may
not want to change the world,
but they do want a chance to
spend a summer sweating
through endless softball games,
parties and museums in the 95
percent humidity that is Wash
ington D.C.
How do the chosen few go
about making it into the elite
strata of Capitol Hill interndom?
For some, the process is not
unlike that of any other job:
resumes, cover letters, inter
views.
But at Stanford, there is an or
ganization that assists students
in securing public-sector jobs
like summer internships — the

Stanford-ln-Government (SIG)
program.
Started in 1962, SIG is the na
tion's oldest and most unique
program of its kind, according
to SIG chairperson jim Sher
man.
"Our traditional service,"
Sherman said, "is to provide in
formation for students which
facilitates the process of the
job-search."
Snagging a job from someone
with inside connections might
take more than the information
contained in SlG's files. But SIG
is aware of people with such ad
vantages — like those with easy
access to the Hill via uncles in
similar high places — and pro
vides some of its own extra
help.
Each March, for instance, SIG
sends a task force of three
members to lobby directly with
public interest agencies and
congressional offices in the
hope of clinching positions for
Stanford students. According to
Sherman, the process is both
simple and beneficial.
"The lobbyist interviews the
student before going to Wash
ington to gain some under
standing of what the student is
like," Sherman said, "and then
goes to Washington to try to get
him the job."
Having had contact with the

program for a few years, the
offices have "come to expect
us," said Sherman. He has
found that "the lobbyist can of
ten make a difference in landing
a job."
But Sherman stresses that "it
is pretty much up to the student
to get the job, but we assist in
securing it."
Still worried about your
chances to help change
the world? Well, in or
der to further outdistance the
competition, SIG has instituted
a new fellowship program, to
be initiated this summer.
Arrangements have been
made with four congressional
committees — including the
Senate Commerce Committee
and the House Rules and

judiciary Committee — to con
sider the hiring of one Stanford
student each summer. After a
large, on-campus competition,
the lobbyists will travel to D.C.
and discuss the finalists with
each committee, leaving the
final decision to the employers.
Along with placement in a
choice summer position, the
winners of the fellowships will
receive a $1500 stipend and first
choice of housing.
Sherman said SIG is inter
ested in developing similar set
ups but does not want to create
the same type of concrete ar
rangements that exist at some
other schools, explaining that
"Stanford students are very
motivated and we don't have to
pamper them."

Vet the excitement of secur
ing the job itself may be small
compared to the adventures
many Stanford students have
had during their stays in Wash
ington.
Even though in the beginning
— when he worked with two
other interns — Jim Backer
"had to look for things to do"
in Sen. John Exon's (R-Neb.) of
fice, by the last two weeks of his
term, he was busy doing re
search, especially in response
to a constituent's complaint
that hazardous materials were
being improperly handled.
On the last day of work, he
spoke with the senator — some
thing he hadn't really done
since the first day — for half an
hour "about alcohol and drug

abuse among kids on college
campuses.
"He was very jovial," Backer
said, "and was surprised to hear
about drinking problems. In his
day, he said people took a drink
and it was no big deal."
Yet while an intern might not
make a big impact on his
senator, his presence is almost
always felt by the staff.
According to Bob Wichser,
administrative assistant to Rep.
Ed Zschau (R-Menlo Park), the
Stanford students he has had in
the past have been highly
motivated. "They feel they can
make a very significant contri
bution, they work hard and do
what needs to be done," he
said, adding, "I'd hate to run an
office without them."

In choosing interns, Wichser
said he looks for a variety of
qualities, including students
who are "articulate, write well,
are interested in government
and desire to be a part of the
political process."
But all work and no play
would make for an
unlikely combination in
socially active, summertime
Washington.
"Washington is great for stu
dents," said Diane Stewart, one
of the SIG coordinators in D.C.
and a past intern in Sen. Mark
Mattingly's (R-Ga.) office. "The
social life with the staff, parties
after work, Georgetown, bars,
dancing, clubs — it was won
derful."
Stewart was one of two. SIG
members who worked in Wash
ington to coordinate various so
cial and political activities,
anything from Stanford happy
hours to softball games against
Ivy League schools ("We killed
them," said Backer) to weekly
forums with speakers like Sen.
William Proxmire (DAVis.) and
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.).
In addition to setting up so
cial activities in Washington,
SIG also assists in finding
housing for Stanford interns.
Through its large pool of alumni
support, SIG has been success
ful in housing about 70 percent
of the interested students.
SIG also relies strongly on
graduates for monetary support
in order to help finance interns
working in non-paying posi
tions. About one-third of the
students who go to Washington
with SIG work on a volunteer
basis.
"We try to make it possible
for all students to go to Wash
ington, regardless of their
income standing," Sherman
said.
