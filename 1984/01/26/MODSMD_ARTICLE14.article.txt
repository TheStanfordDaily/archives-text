[ ince the politically tur
bulent years of the late
1960s and early '70s,
things have quieted considerab
ly at Stanford and student inter
est in politics has waned.
But now, more than a decade
later and with the country in the
midst of an election year, a new
[effort to rejuvenate student in
volvement in the affairs of the
nation — and in particular, to
get out the vote — is underway
here.
In a move to catalyze student
interest in the coming election
and encourage voter registra
tion, the ASSU Lobby Office is
undertaking the biggest chal
lenge since its inception one
year ago. The student-run or
ganization is attempting to at
tract presidential candidates,
members of Congress and
other leading political figures to

the University tor a three-day
forum, called "Participation:
Public Policy, Politics, and
Public Service," on April 6-8.
The proposed confer
ence needs approval by
the ASSU Senate and
financial support to fund the
event, whose costs are
projected at nearly $28,000.
John Hoffmire, director of the
Lobby Office, said he hopes the
proposed meeting will broaden
student awareness of public
policy and lead to an increase in
voter registration and turnout at
the polls. He estimates that a
mere 35 percent of all people
between the ages of 18 and 24
are registered voters.
The ramifications of low tur
nout from young people are of
ten reflected in the lack of at
tention candidates give to is
sues such as financial aid, draft
registration, housing concerns
and international relations, is
sues which are often of prime
importance to students, Hoff
mire said.
The conference, Hoffmire
stressed, is not a move to influ
ence people in the direction of
a particular political ideology.
Instead, he hopes the planned
panel sessions on topics such as

the economy and draft will get
"the broadest spectrum of
people involved in voter
registration and the specific af
fairs of our nation."
Council-of-Presidents mem
ber Peter Spivack echoed Hoff
mire's sentiments. "The con
ference should help define the
ideas of students already inter
ested in politics and spark the
interest of those who are not.
It's important to get people in
volved in the political process,"
Spivack said.
Spivack said he considers
Stanford students to be
"interested in national political
developments, but there is not
that feeling that they can have a
direct effect on issues. I would
say that the students are now
more concerned about careers
and business than they were
when I first came here."
Danny Sanchez, chair of the
Chicano student group
MeChA, reiterated Spivack's
thoughts. "Most Stanford stu
dents come in here career
oriented — it's as if they have
blinders on (to political af
fairs)," Sanchez said. "I don't
think they are nearly as politi

cally aware as students at other
campuses."
He said he considers the pro
posed conference to be a step
in the right direction of rekin
dling student involvement.
"Any time you bring the
presidential candidates on
campus and discuss some major
issues, you're going to have
more people paying attention
to the political scene."
Hoffmire attributes student
apathy toward voter registration
and turnout to several causes.
"For some students it's simply a
matter of never having voted
before and never having estab
lished the habit of going to the
polls each election day,"he
said.
For some students who have
registered, the hassle of re
registering turns them away,
while others simply believe
their votes "won't matter,"
Hoffmire added.
Hoffmire also expressed
sentiment that voter registra
tion forms are difficult to under
stand. Too often students will
mail back an incomplete form
or miss the 29-days-before-
Election-Day deadline. "Even
the deadlines discourage stu
dent participation because at

places like Stanford the
deadline for registering for the
general election is just a few
days after students finish regis
tering for classes. Students are
very busy at the time,
sometimes too busy to register
to vote," he said.
Students attempting to vote
by absentee ballot also face
problems. Hoffmire said the
procedure is often more diffi
cult, and "most students who
intend to be absentee voters do
not, in fact, vote at all." Stu
dents who do vote by absentee
ballot often lack proper infor
mation on the candidates and
issues due to the varying dates
of primary elections from state
to state.
"For a student from New
York, the primary election in his
state would actually be held in
April, while the student in Cali
fornia is getting information
about a primary occuring in
|une," Hoffmire said.
To alleviate some of the prob
lems of registering, the Lobby
Office will set up tables at
White Plaza on Feb. 25 to
assist students in completing
the voter forms. The tables will
be manned through the
remainder of the school year.
