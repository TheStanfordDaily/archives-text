# The 						perfect Democrat? Mine, of course

### David Azrin 
He's young. He's intelligent. He has new ideas.
He's a critical thinker. He doesn't run with
the pack. He's the man to watch.
Only He will be able to square off with the Actor
President at high noon and carry our nation into a new
period.
He's every student's dream choice for the Demo
cratic nomination.
And his name? That depends on which student you
ask.
With the California primary still four months away,
students here are busily choosing their sides in the
seven-man Democratic race. Student groups support
ing Sen. Gary Hart, Sen. John Glenn and the Rev. jesse
Jackson have already been formed while groups for
former Vice President Walter Mondale, former Min
nesota Sen. George McGovern and California Sen. Alan
Cranston are expected to appear soon.
Fueled with memories of students' powerful role in
the 1968 and '72 Democratic nominations, most of the
national campaign organizations are keeping a close
watch on national student sentiment. The Hart,
McGovern, Jackson and Cranston campaigns seem to
be making a particularly strong effort to court student
opinion.
The most active group at Stanford so far seems to
be Hart's. Sophomore Jeff Phillips, coordinator
for the Stanford Hart campaign, said his group
has about 25 active members and a mailing list of about
150.
"The main problem we've had is that students like
what he has to say but they are skeptical about his
chances," Phillips said. The group plans to set up a
booth in White Plaza to distribute information and sell
T-shirts to raise funds.
"I think there's a lot of latent support," he said.
Bill Bradley, state co-chair of the Hart campaign, said
Hart is counting on strong student support in the pri
maries.
"The Hart campaign has a tremendous emphasis on
students," Bradley said. "Students are already very in
tegrally involved in the states with early primaries.
"Gary is part of a new generation of leaders. He
doesn't represent the old hack ways in politics," Brad
ley said.
Phillips said his candidate's far-reaching economic
proposals, industrial policy proposals, support for cuts
in military spending, defense of free trade and liberal
foreign policy views make him especially attractive to
students.
"He appeals to students because he is not just saying
the same old stuff," Phillips said."Lots of people have
been impressed that he is willing to say where he
stands. He presents himself as having substantive
answers to a lot of the issues."
Phillips added that Hart "was one of the only
Democrats in the Senate to stand up against Ronald
Reagan."
The Jesse Jackson student campaign here ap
pears to have gotten off to a strong start with
large showings at the first meetings this week.
Keith Archuleta, STARTS program director and lead
er of Jackson's campaign group, the Stanford
Committee for a Rainbow Coalition, said about 40 stu
dents showed up for the first meeting.
"There's a lot of interest, " Archuleta said.
Jackson organizers here and nationwide said they are
placing less emphasis on helping their candidate win
the Democratic nomination than on trying to form a
new coalition of groups that will continue to work after
the campaign.
"We see the Jackson campaign as a way to galvanize
people around issues that we think are important, es
pecially those of economic self-reliance and demo
cratic rights," Archuleta said.
"We'll raise a lot of issues that other candidates are
not," Archuleta said. "We're going to carry on this
campaign as though he will win, because central to this
campaign are the issues."
The Rainbow Coalition here is planning a series of in
formational workshops, information tables in White
Plaza, fund-raising activities and a voter registration
drive next month.
Wilson Riles, the Northern California campaign
director for Jackson, said the national organization is
counting on student support in the campaign.
"Students are going to be key to the success of a
Jackson campaign," Riles said. "There will be a con
scious outreach to students. And we will have direct
student input in policy-making."
Riles admitted that Jackson's chances for the Demo
cratic nomination are "extremely slim," but said the
Jackson campaign has already been successful in inject
ing the issues of civil rights, discrimination, unemploy
ment, Third World relations and human rights into the
national political debate.
Riles said the campaign has been "tremendously suc
cessful" in bringing together diverse groups — includ
ing anti-nuclear, minority, environmentalist, feminist
and labor groups on the local level.
The organization conspicuously missing on
campus is one supporting the current front
runner, Walter Mondale.
Brian McDonald, head of Stanford Democrats, which

is not supporting a candidate, said, "No one is
jumping up and down about Mondale. He may be
going after bigger media."
Steve Westly, head of the Mondale campaign in this
congressional district, said the Mondale campaign has
not had time to start up a Stanford group because it
has spent time garnering support from more tradition
al interest groups. But he said he hopes to help start a
Mondale group here in the next few weeks.
"The other candidates that didn't have support from
the traditional groups found they had little place to go
— except the campuses," Westly said.
"Students are real important in the Mondale cam
paign," he said. "Mondale has a real strong record that
will appeal to students, and he's been really good at
pulling young people into the campaign, which reflects
his commitment to young people."
Westley said Mondale's stands on the draft, student
aid, the environment and nuclear arms, in addition to
his strong campaign organization will make him a favor
ite candidate on college campuses.
"What makes him stand out is that he has an organi
zation that is second to none — and that means he can
beat Ronald Reagan," he said. "It's important to have
strong substantive stands on the issues, but you've also
got to have a good organization."
Also absent on campus is a student group sup
porting Alan Cranston, a Stanford alumnus
and strong advocate of nuclear disarmament.
Pat Osbon, Cranston's California campaign manager,
said his candidate has spent less energy in this state be
cause he is trying to gather support in lowa, New
Hampshire and the South.
"We've put our time, energy and resources in the
states with early primaries," Osbon said.
Osbon added that student support is key to the
Cranston campaign and he hopes to help set up a
Cranston group here soon.
"Student votes are very instrumental to our strat
egy," Osbon said. "It is key. Students are great grass

roots organizers. They are a tremendous resource.
They also vote."
Osbon said Cranston's strong support for the nu
clear freeze and his detailed economic program make
him appealing to students.
"He appeals to students bcause they are growing up
in a world that is teetering on the brink of a nuclear
holocaust. They want a world that is safe, and
Cranston, more than any other candidate, is committed
to that," Osbon said.
"He is the only one with a detailed, well-thought out
economic program to put people back to work," he
said.
The Glenn campaign is putting less emphasis on
gathering student support than the other candi
dates, according to Jermiah Hallisey, California
state chair for the Glenn campaign.
"The conventional wisdom is that for the more
liberal vote, most of them would tend to be more sym
pathetic to Sen. Hart or Sen. Cranston," he said.
Hallisey said the Glenn campaign plans to emphasize
Glenn's achievements as an astronaut, test pilot,
businessman and U.S. senator.
Richard Deck, a graduate student in political science
who is currently organizing a student group for Glenn,
said he has received favorable response from students
about Glenn's campaign.
"The most solid impression among students is that
he is honest and somebody you can trust," Deck said.
"He is a rational, moderate centrist."
"I do not think the mood of the '80s on campuses is
to engage in a quixotic campaign," he said. "He has the
best chance of beating Reagan."
Deck said he was impressed by Glenn's critical think
ing and mastery of detail, particularly on economic is
sues.
Glenn group activities here will include presenta
tions in dorms, telephone campaigning and an in
formational booth in White Plaza, Deck said.
Former Sen. George McGovern's campaign is
"getting some super strong support from
campuses across the country," according to
Mark Stein, California campaign director for
McGovern. McGovern relied heavily on student sup
port to capture the '72 Democratic nomination.
"It's definitely a key aspect of our campaign organi
zation," he said.
Stein said McGovern's stands on defense cuts, anti
interventionism, arms reductions, student aid, civil
rights and low-interest home mortgage loans should
make him a popular candidate among students.
"His progressive stands on the issues appeal to stu
dents and a large spectrum of the people in this
country," Stein said.
Stein said that no Stanford student had yet contacted
the McGovern campaign about forming a group here,
adding that he is hopeful that a student group will be
formed soon.
McGovern is a serious candidate, Stein said, but even
if he does not win the nomination he will have
succeeded in having an impact on the kinds of issues
discussed in the Democratic Party.
As the California primary draws closer, the na
tional organizations for the Democratic candi
dates will begin to focus their efforts more
closely on this state. And students at universities across
the state may play a key role in organizing, campaign
ing and fund raising for the campaign.
As a result, the campaign directors are keeping a
close eye on students, trying to rally them to support
their candidate as the dream choice for students.
"All of the Democratic candidates are concerned
about where the students are at," said the Jackson cam
paign director here, "especially if they get inspired."

er of Jackson's campaign group, the Stanford
Committee for a Rainbow Coalition, said about 40 stu
dents showed up for the first meeting.
"There's a lot of interest, " Archuleta said.
Jackson organizers here and nationwide said they are
placing less emphasis on helping their candidate win
the Democratic nomination than on trying to form a
new coalition of groups that will continue to work after
the campaign.
"We see the Jackson campaign as a way to galvanize
people around issues that we think are important, es
pecially those of economic self-reliance and demo
cratic rights," Archuleta said.
"We'll raise a lot of issues that other candidates are
not," Archuleta said. "We're going to carry on this
campaign as though he will win, because central to this
campaign are the issues."
The Rainbow Coalition here is planning a series of in
formational workshops, information tables in White
Plaza, fund-raising activities and a voter registration
drive next month.
Wilson Riles, the Northern California campaign
director for Jackson, said the national organization is
counting on student support in the campaign.
"Students are going to be key to the success of a
Jackson campaign," Riles said. "There will be a con
scious outreach to students. And we will have direct
student input in policy-making."
Riles admitted that Jackson's chances for the Demo
cratic nomination are "extremely slim," but said the
Jackson campaign has already been successful in inject
ing the issues of civil rights, discrimination, unemploy
ment, Third World relations and human rights into the
national political debate.
Riles said the campaign has been "tremendously suc
cessful" in bringing together diverse groups — includ
ing anti-nuclear, minority, environmentalist, feminist
and labor groups on the local level.
The organization conspicuously missing on
campus is one supporting the current front
runner, Walter Mondale.
Brian McDonald, head of Stanford Democrats, which

is not supporting a candidate, said, "No one is
jumping up and down about Mondale. He may be
going after bigger media."
Steve Westly, head of the Mondale campaign in this
congressional district, said the Mondale campaign has
not had time to start up a Stanford group because it
has spent time garnering support from more tradition
al interest groups. But he said he hopes to help start a
Mondale group here in the next few weeks.
"The other candidates that didn't have support from
the traditional groups found they had little place to go
— except the campuses," Westly said.
"Students are real important in the Mondale cam
paign," he said. "Mondale has a real strong record that
will appeal to students, and he's been really good at
pulling young people into the campaign, which reflects
his commitment to young people."
Westley said Mondale's stands on the draft, student
aid, the environment and nuclear arms, in addition to
his strong campaign organization will make him a favor
ite candidate on college campuses.
"What makes him stand out is that he has an organi
zation that is second to none — and that means he can
beat Ronald Reagan," he said. "It's important to have
strong substantive stands on the issues, but you've also
got to have a good organization."
Also absent on campus is a student group sup
porting Alan Cranston, a Stanford alumnus
and strong advocate of nuclear disarmament.
Pat Osbon, Cranston's California campaign manager,
said his candidate has spent less energy in this state be
cause he is trying to gather support in lowa, New
Hampshire and the South.
"We've put our time, energy and resources in the
states with early primaries," Osbon said.
Osbon added that student support is key to the
Cranston campaign and he hopes to help set up a
Cranston group here soon.
"Student votes are very instrumental to our strat
egy," Osbon said. "It is key. Students are great grass

roots organizers. They are a tremendous resource.
They also vote."
Osbon said Cranston's strong support for the nu
clear freeze and his detailed economic program make
him appealing to students.
"He appeals to students bcause they are growing up
in a world that is teetering on the brink of a nuclear
holocaust. They want a world that is safe, and
Cranston, more than any other candidate, is committed
to that," Osbon said.
"He is the only one with a detailed, well-thought out
economic program to put people back to work," he
said.
The Glenn campaign is putting less emphasis on
gathering student support than the other candi
dates, according to Jermiah Hallisey, California
state chair for the Glenn campaign.
"The conventional wisdom is that for the more
liberal vote, most of them would tend to be more sym
pathetic to Sen. Hart or Sen. Cranston," he said.
Hallisey said the Glenn campaign plans to emphasize
Glenn's achievements as an astronaut, test pilot,
businessman and U.S. senator.
Richard Deck, a graduate student in political science
who is currently organizing a student group for Glenn,
said he has received favorable response from students
about Glenn's campaign.
"The most solid impression among students is that
he is honest and somebody you can trust," Deck said.
"He is a rational, moderate centrist."
"I do not think the mood of the '80s on campuses is
to engage in a quixotic campaign," he said. "He has the
best chance of beating Reagan."
Deck said he was impressed by Glenn's critical think
ing and mastery of detail, particularly on economic is
sues.
Glenn group activities here will include presenta
tions in dorms, telephone campaigning and an in
formational booth in White Plaza, Deck said.
Former Sen. George McGovern's campaign is
"getting some super strong support from
campuses across the country," according to
Mark Stein, California campaign director for
McGovern. McGovern relied heavily on student sup
port to capture the '72 Democratic nomination.
"It's definitely a key aspect of our campaign organi
zation," he said.
Stein said McGovern's stands on defense cuts, anti
interventionism, arms reductions, student aid, civil
rights and low-interest home mortgage loans should
make him a popular candidate among students.
"His progressive stands on the issues appeal to stu
dents and a large spectrum of the people in this
country," Stein said.
Stein said that no Stanford student had yet contacted
the McGovern campaign about forming a group here,
adding that he is hopeful that a student group will be
formed soon.
McGovern is a serious candidate, Stein said, but even
if he does not win the nomination he will have
succeeded in having an impact on the kinds of issues
discussed in the Democratic Party.
As the California primary draws closer, the na
tional organizations for the Democratic candi
dates will begin to focus their efforts more
closely on this state. And students at universities across
the state may play a key role in organizing, campaign
ing and fund raising for the campaign.
As a result, the campaign directors are keeping a
close eye on students, trying to rally them to support
their candidate as the dream choice for students.
"All of the Democratic candidates are concerned
about where the students are at," said the Jackson cam
paign director here, "especially if they get inspired."


He's young. He's intelligent. He has new ideas.
He's a critical thinker. He doesn't run with
the pack. He's the man to watch.
Only He will be able to square off with the Actor
President at high noon and carry our nation into a new
period.
He's every student's dream choice for the Demo
cratic nomination.
And his name? That depends on which student you
ask.
With the California primary still four months away,
students here are busily choosing their sides in the
seven-man Democratic race. Student groups support
ing Sen. Gary Hart, Sen. John Glenn and the Rev. jesse
Jackson have already been formed while groups for
former Vice President Walter Mondale, former Min
nesota Sen. George McGovern and California Sen. Alan
Cranston are expected to appear soon.
Fueled with memories of students' powerful role in
the 1968 and '72 Democratic nominations, most of the
national campaign organizations are keeping a close
watch on national student sentiment. The Hart,
McGovern, Jackson and Cranston campaigns seem to
be making a particularly strong effort to court student
opinion.
The most active group at Stanford so far seems to
be Hart's. Sophomore Jeff Phillips, coordinator
for the Stanford Hart campaign, said his group
has about 25 active members and a mailing list of about
150.
"The main problem we've had is that students like
what he has to say but they are skeptical about his
chances," Phillips said. The group plans to set up a
booth in White Plaza to distribute information and sell
T-shirts to raise funds.
"I think there's a lot of latent support," he said.
Bill Bradley, state co-chair of the Hart campaign, said
Hart is counting on strong student support in the pri
maries.
"The Hart campaign has a tremendous emphasis on
students," Bradley said. "Students are already very in
tegrally involved in the states with early primaries.
"Gary is part of a new generation of leaders. He
doesn't represent the old hack ways in politics," Brad
ley said.
Phillips said his candidate's far-reaching economic
proposals, industrial policy proposals, support for cuts
in military spending, defense of free trade and liberal
foreign policy views make him especially attractive to
students.
"He appeals to students because he is not just saying
the same old stuff," Phillips said."Lots of people have
been impressed that he is willing to say where he
stands. He presents himself as having substantive
answers to a lot of the issues."
Phillips added that Hart "was one of the only
Democrats in the Senate to stand up against Ronald
Reagan."
The Jesse Jackson student campaign here ap
pears to have gotten off to a strong start with

aid, the environment and nuclear arms, in addition to
his strong campaign organization will make him a favor
ite candidate on college campuses.
"What makes him stand out is that he has an organi
zation that is second to none — and that means he can
beat Ronald Reagan," he said. "It's important to have
strong substantive stands on the issues, but you've also
got to have a good organization."
Also absent on campus is a student group sup
porting Alan Cranston, a Stanford alumnus
and strong advocate of nuclear disarmament.
Pat Osbon, Cranston's California campaign manager,
said his candidate has spent less energy in this state be
cause he is trying to gather support in lowa, New
Hampshire and the South.
"We've put our time, energy and resources in the
states with early primaries," Osbon said.
Osbon added that student support is key to the
Cranston campaign and he hopes to help set up a
Cranston group here soon.
"Student votes are very instrumental to our strat
egy," Osbon said. "It is key. Students are great grass

roots organizers. They are a tremendous resource.
They also vote."
Osbon said Cranston's strong support for the nu
clear freeze and his detailed economic program make
him appealing to students.
"He appeals to students bcause they are growing up
in a world that is teetering on the brink of a nuclear
holocaust. They want a world that is safe, and
Cranston, more than any other candidate, is committed
to that," Osbon said.
"He is the only one with a detailed, well-thought out
economic program to put people back to work," he
said.
The Glenn campaign is putting less emphasis on
gathering student support than the other candi
dates, according to Jermiah Hallisey, California
state chair for the Glenn campaign.
"The conventional wisdom is that for the more
liberal vote, most of them would tend to be more sym
pathetic to Sen. Hart or Sen. Cranston," he said.
Hallisey said the Glenn campaign plans to emphasize
Glenn's achievements as an astronaut, test pilot,
businessman and U.S. senator.
Richard Deck, a graduate student in political science
who is currently organizing a student group for Glenn,
said he has received favorable response from students
about Glenn's campaign.
"The most solid impression among students is that
he is honest and somebody you can trust," Deck said.
"He is a rational, moderate centrist."
"I do not think the mood of the '80s on campuses is
to engage in a quixotic campaign," he said. "He has the
best chance of beating Reagan."
Deck said he was impressed by Glenn's critical think
ing and mastery of detail, particularly on economic is
sues.
Glenn group activities here will include presenta
tions in dorms, telephone campaigning and an in
formational booth in White Plaza, Deck said.
Former Sen. George McGovern's campaign is
"getting some super strong support from
campuses across the country," according to
Mark Stein, California campaign director for
McGovern. McGovern relied heavily on student sup
port to capture the '72 Democratic nomination.
"It's definitely a key aspect of our campaign organi
zation," he said.
Stein said McGovern's stands on defense cuts, anti
interventionism, arms reductions, student aid, civil
rights and low-interest home mortgage loans should
make him a popular candidate among students.
"His progressive stands on the issues appeal to stu
dents and a large spectrum of the people in this
country," Stein said.
Stein said that no Stanford student had yet contacted
the McGovern campaign about forming a group here,
adding that he is hopeful that a student group will be
formed soon.
McGovern is a serious candidate, Stein said, but even
if he does not win the nomination he will have
succeeded in having an impact on the kinds of issues
discussed in the Democratic Party.
As the California primary draws closer, the na
tional organizations for the Democratic candi
dates will begin to focus their efforts more
closely on this state. And students at universities across
the state may play a key role in organizing, campaign
ing and fund raising for the campaign.
As a result, the campaign directors are keeping a
close eye on students, trying to rally them to support
their candidate as the dream choice for students.
"All of the Democratic candidates are concerned
about where the students are at," said the Jackson cam
paign director here, "especially if they get inspired."


He's young. He's intelligent. He has new ideas.
He's a critical thinker. He doesn't run with
the pack. He's the man to watch.
Only He will be able to square off with the Actor
President at high noon and carry our nation into a new
period.
He's every student's dream choice for the Demo
cratic nomination.
And his name? That depends on which student you
ask.
With the California primary still four months away,
students here are busily choosing their sides in the
seven-man Democratic race. Student groups support
ing Sen. Gary Hart, Sen. John Glenn and the Rev. jesse
Jackson have already been formed while groups for
former Vice President Walter Mondale, former Min
nesota Sen. George McGovern and California Sen. Alan
Cranston are expected to appear soon.
Fueled with memories of students' powerful role in
the 1968 and '72 Democratic nominations, most of the
national campaign organizations are keeping a close
watch on national student sentiment. The Hart,
McGovern, Jackson and Cranston campaigns seem to
be making a particularly strong effort to court student
opinion.
The most active group at Stanford so far seems to
be Hart's. Sophomore Jeff Phillips, coordinator
for the Stanford Hart campaign, said his group
has about 25 active members and a mailing list of about
150.
"The main problem we've had is that students like
what he has to say but they are skeptical about his
chances," Phillips said. The group plans to set up a
booth in White Plaza to distribute information and sell
T-shirts to raise funds.
"I think there's a lot of latent support," he said.
Bill Bradley, state co-chair of the Hart campaign, said
Hart is counting on strong student support in the pri
maries.
"The Hart campaign has a tremendous emphasis on
students," Bradley said. "Students are already very in
tegrally involved in the states with early primaries.
"Gary is part of a new generation of leaders. He
doesn't represent the old hack ways in politics," Brad
ley said.
Phillips said his candidate's far-reaching economic
proposals, industrial policy proposals, support for cuts
in military spending, defense of free trade and liberal
foreign policy views make him especially attractive to
students.
"He appeals to students because he is not just saying
the same old stuff," Phillips said."Lots of people have
been impressed that he is willing to say where he
stands. He presents himself as having substantive
answers to a lot of the issues."
Phillips added that Hart "was one of the only
Democrats in the Senate to stand up against Ronald
Reagan."
The Jesse Jackson student campaign here ap
pears to have gotten off to a strong start with
large showings at the first meetings this week.
Keith Archuleta, STARTS program director and lead
er of Jackson's campaign group, the Stanford
Committee for a Rainbow Coalition, said about 40 stu
dents showed up for the first meeting.
"There's a lot of interest, " Archuleta said.
Jackson organizers here and nationwide said they are
placing less emphasis on helping their candidate win
the Democratic nomination than on trying to form a
new coalition of groups that will continue to work after
the campaign.
"We see the Jackson campaign as a way to galvanize
people around issues that we think are important, es
pecially those of economic self-reliance and demo
cratic rights," Archuleta said.
"We'll raise a lot of issues that other candidates are
not," Archuleta said. "We're going to carry on this
campaign as though he will win, because central to this
campaign are the issues."
The Rainbow Coalition here is planning a series of in
formational workshops, information tables in White
Plaza, fund-raising activities and a voter registration
drive next month.
Wilson Riles, the Northern California campaign
director for Jackson, said the national organization is
counting on student support in the campaign.
"Students are going to be key to the success of a
Jackson campaign," Riles said. "There will be a con
scious outreach to students. And we will have direct
student input in policy-making."
Riles admitted that Jackson's chances for the Demo
cratic nomination are "extremely slim," but said the
Jackson campaign has already been successful in inject
ing the issues of civil rights, discrimination, unemploy
ment, Third World relations and human rights into the
national political debate.
Riles said the campaign has been "tremendously suc
cessful" in bringing together diverse groups — includ
ing anti-nuclear, minority, environmentalist, feminist
and labor groups on the local level.
The organization conspicuously missing on
campus is one supporting the current front
runner, Walter Mondale.
Brian McDonald, head of Stanford Democrats, which

is not supporting a candidate, said, "No one is
jumping up and down about Mondale. He may be
going after bigger media."
Steve Westly, head of the Mondale campaign in this
congressional district, said the Mondale campaign has
not had time to start up a Stanford group because it
has spent time garnering support from more tradition
al interest groups. But he said he hopes to help start a
Mondale group here in the next few weeks.
"The other candidates that didn't have support from
the traditional groups found they had little place to go
— except the campuses," Westly said.
"Students are real important in the Mondale cam
paign," he said. "Mondale has a real strong record that
will appeal to students, and he's been really good at
pulling young people into the campaign, which reflects
his commitment to young people."
Westley said Mondale's stands on the draft, student
aid, the environment and nuclear arms, in addition to
his strong campaign organization will make him a favor
ite candidate on college campuses.
"What makes him stand out is that he has an organi
zation that is second to none — and that means he can
