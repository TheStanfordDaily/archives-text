# Card faces Harshman's 1st-place Huskies

One of the two teams in
tonight's Stanford-Washington
Pacific-10 Conference basket
ball game at 7:30 in Maples
Pavilion leads the nation in field
goal percentage. And it's not
Washington, which leads the
Pac-10 with a 6-0 record and is
13-3 overall.
Stanford, believe it or not, is
currently the nation's No. 1
field goal shooting team at .563,
despite occupying the confer
ence cellar with an 0-6 record.
Washington, however, is first
in the Pac-10 in another, more
important category — confer
ence victories. The Huskies,
now ranked 19th in United
Press International's coaches
poll, convincingly defeated
both Oregon and Oregon State
last weekend and took a com
manding lead in the league
race. Although the conference
season is still two-thirds of the
way from completion, they
already lead second-place
UCLA (4-1) by one and a half
games and third-place Oregon
(4-2) by a full two.
"It is a very, very good bas
ketball team," said Stanford
Coach Tom Davis of the
Huskies, who have won eight
straight games and 12 of their
last 13. "It may even be the best
team in the conference, espe
cially with the way they've been
playing."
Washington Coach Marv
Harshman, while he admits his
Huskies are good, does not
think they are good enough to
remain undefeated in league
play. In fact, he doesn't think
they'll even come close.
"I think anybody can beat
you," he said. "I ve never seen
the league like this. And in all
honesty, I can't believe Stan
ford hasn't won a game yet."
Neither can Davis and his
Cardinal, which has dropped
the six conference games by a
total of 20 points. Although it

would take a small miracle to
gain a post-season tournament
berth this season, Stanford can
still aim toward its first winning
season in over a decade.
"It's been frustrating (the 0-6
start) for the coach and certainly
for the players," Davis said.
"But it's like the referee-ing.
You can't do much about it
now."
Instead, Davis and his staft
have turned their attention to
the literally large problems
Washington poses. The Huskies
are by far the tallest team in the
conference. They also are the
most international.
Two Washington starters — 7-
foot freshman Christian Welp
and 6-9 junior Detlef Schrempf
— are from West Germany and
7-0 junior reserve Flosi
Sigurdsson is from Iceland.
Washington's other front-line
starter is 6-9 sophomore Paul
Fortier, who attended San Fran
cisco's St. Ignatius College Prep
and then the University of San
Francisco before transferring up
north after USF cancelled its
basketball program two years
ago. The guards are 6-3 Shag
Williams and 5-11 senior
playmaker Alvin Vaughn.
The Huskies, which have
eight players over 6-5 on their 15-
man roster, are not only tall, but
also quick. The 6-9 Schrempf can
and has played both forward
and guard, and leads the team
in scoring and rebounding,
averaging 13 points and 8.4
rebounds per game.
If Stanford is going to hand
Washington its first Pac-10 loss,
it will have to find a way to
choke off the Huskies' inside
game. Davis said he will use his
full-court press and a collapsing
zone defense to equalize the
height difference.
The other thing Davis and
company will try to do is speed
up the tempo and tire the
Fluskies with a running game.
"If we start running with

people, we start to self
destruct," Harshman said.
"We're going to try to get up on
them and slow it down."
Harshman also hopes to cool
the hot-shooting Cardinal. "The
thing that worries us is that
Stanford has so many people
that can shoot the ball."
One of those "people" is
Cardinal center John Revelli,
who leads the nation in individ
ual field goal percentage at an
amazing .703, a full 30
percentage points better than

second-place Bernard
Thompson of Fresno State.
Guard Keith Jones paces the
Card with a 19.9 points per
game average, while Revelli and
Brown are collecting 17.7 and
12.6 points per outing,
respectively. Revelli is rebound
ing at a 7.8 clip to lead the team.
Davis said he will go with the
same starting lineup that
played so well in the losing ef
fort at Oregon State Monday
night — Revelli, Jones, forwards
Earl Koberlein and Steve Brown
and point guard |ohn Paye.

Card notes
Harshman is a member of the
nation's coaching elite that has
won over 600 games. He sports
a 609-434 career record and is
213-132 in his 12-plus years at
Washington.
Saturday's game against
Washington State at Maples
Pavilion has a noon tip-off, not 1
p.m. as printed on some
schedules. The game time was
changed to accomodate
Metrosports, which will broad
cast the game live on Channel
48.
