# Civil rights official attacks racial quotas

### TED LEMPERT 
A Hoover Institution fellow
recently appointed by President
Reagan to the controversial U.S.
Civil Rights Commission
defended the panel and its
stance against affirmative action
last night at a meeting of local •
fair-housing advocates in Palo
Alto.
John Bunzel, one of three
Reagan appointees placed on
the restructured commission
after a six-month battle with
Congress, said preferential
treatment toward minorities is
reverse discrimination and
places group rights above indi
vidual rights.
"There is no such thing as
black justice, brown justice, or
female justice," Bunzel told
around 100 members of Mid
peninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing. "There is only justice
for the individual."
Bunzel, who was president of
San lose State University from
1970 to 1978, when he became a
senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution, strongly attacked ra
cial quotas and used university
faculty hiring as a prime exam
ple. The commissioner said he

opposed quotas that dis
criminated against minorities
when he was a college student
in the 19405, and today he
opposes quotas that dis
criminate against whites.
"We should make sure the
applicant pool is as broad as
possible, but a university
should appoint the most
qualified applicant from the
pool," he said. "I don't think a
university ought to put itself in a
position where it hires some
one on the basis of their race."
Bunzel, one of Reagan's
Democratic appointees to the
bipartisan commission, insisted
he was following the ideals of
former Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey, and other Demo
cratic leaders in stressing equal
opportunity and individual
rights over affirmative action.
Bunzel claimed that people
oppose his appointment be
cause he is a Reagan appointee.
Bunzel was originally appointed
in May, rejected by Congress in
July and then approved in Octo
ber after a compromise be
tween Reagan and Congress.
