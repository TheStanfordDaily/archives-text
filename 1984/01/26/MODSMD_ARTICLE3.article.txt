Reagan says 'America is back'
Washington — President Reagan gave Congress and the na
tion yesterday an economic and foreign policy agenda
showing little change of course in the election year, declaring
"America is back, standing tall" under his leadership.
Reagan's State of the Union address shunned any major
new taxes to close the huge federal deficit, and said that
would only be a "Band-aid solution'' for "an illness that has
been coming on for half a century.''
But he did ask Congress to act on a Constitutional amend
ment that would give him "line item" veto power on ap
propriation bills: He could scuttle particular projects without
killing entire bills.
Speaking of a need to develop "America's
next frontier," Reagan ordered creation of a
"permanent, manned space station" and told
NASA to get the job done within a decade.
He said the nation is "safer, stronger," and
can "move with confidence to seize the oppor
tunities for peace, and we will."
In excerpts of the address, Reagan took note
of rising Republican and Democratic pressure to
close the gap between income and spending.
But "to talk of meeting the present situation
by increasing taxes is a Band-aid solution which
does nothing to cure an illness that has been
coming on for half a century, to say nothing of
the fact that it poses a real threat to economic
recovery," he said.
"There is a renewed energy and optimism
throughout the land," Reagan said. "America is
back, standing tall, looking to the '80s with
courage, confidence and hope.
"The heart of America is strong, good and
true," he said. "The cynics were wrong
America never was a sick society."
He said the nation wants "re-dedication to
bedrock values of faith, family, work, neighbor
hood, peace and freedom."
Reagan spoke from the well of the House of
Representatives before senators, House mem
bers, the Cabinet and diplomats, as well as a na
tional radio and television audience.
His wife, Nancy, was given a seat in the
gallery, along with senior White House staffers
and wives of congressional leaders.
With the political season in full swing, the
speech was seen by the president's aides as a
major political document portraying what
Reagan views as his major accomplishments in
the economy, other domestic policies and
foreign affairs.
Lebanese reconciliation halts
Beirut, Lebanon—The government of
Lebanese President Amin Gemayel appears to
have reached a dead end in attempting to form a
new government, revive reconciliation talks
with its opposition or apply a new security plan
to avert another flare-up in the fighting here.
"Everything has come to a halt," one western
-

diplomat said.
"There are no negotiations taking place about
anything any longer at all."
An air of gloom has settled over the capital in
the past few days, and the relative quiet is being
taken by all sides as the calm before the storm.
The Lebanese press, both Christian and Mos
lem, is acting as if something ominous were at
hand, and Moslem opposition leaders are con
vinced the army is about to launch a surprise at
tack on the Shiite-dominated southern suburbs
or expand its presence by force into the coastal
region south of the capital.
Druze militia leader Walid lumblatt is calling
for the resignation of Gemayel, and he and the
Shiite Amal militia chief, Nabih Berri, say they
will not join a national coalition government un
til there is agreement on political reforms.
"What's the purpose of the government? To
do what? Without reconciliation, without us
agreeing with each other, it's for nothing," Berri
said in an interview Saturday.
Meanwhile the Christian Phalangist leader,
Pierre Gemayel, the president's father, has said
the situation is so bad that "it makes necessary a
total popular mobilization" to defend the
country's unity.
Stock prices drop
New York — Stock prices took a sharp drop
in afternoon trading yesterday as traders
awaited President Reagan's State of the Union
message yesterday.
Analysts said the selling was prompted by
speculation that Reagan might pull a surprise in
the next few days and announce that he had
decided against running for re-election.
They also said there was talk that the presi
dent, in his speech yesterday, might unexpec
tedly propose tax-increase measures.
Brokers said the source of these rumors was a
mystery, and some expressed skepticism that
they had any reliable basis.
Today's weather
Sunny today. Highs in the bOs and 70s.
Light winds. Continued tair and mild tonight
and tomorrow. Lows from the upper iOs to low
50s and highs in the 60s and 70s.

Reagan says 'America is back'
Washington — President Reagan gave Congress and the na
tion yesterday an economic and foreign policy agenda
showing little change of course in the election year, declaring
"America is back, standing tall" under his leadership.
Reagan's State of the Union address shunned any major
new taxes to close the huge federal deficit, and said that
would only be a "Band-aid solution'' for "an illness that has
been coming on for half a century.''
But he did ask Congress to act on a Constitutional amend
ment that would give him "line item" veto power on ap
propriation bills: He could scuttle particular projects without
killing entire bills.
Speaking of a need to develop "America's
next frontier," Reagan ordered creation of a
"permanent, manned space station" and told
NASA to get the job done within a decade.
He said the nation is "safer, stronger," and
can "move with confidence to seize the oppor
tunities for peace, and we will."
In excerpts of the address, Reagan took note
of rising Republican and Democratic pressure to
close the gap between income and spending.
But "to talk of meeting the present situation
by increasing taxes is a Band-aid solution which
does nothing to cure an illness that has been
coming on for half a century, to say nothing of
the fact that it poses a real threat to economic
recovery," he said.
"There is a renewed energy and optimism
throughout the land," Reagan said. "America is
back, standing tall, looking to the '80s with
courage, confidence and hope.
"The heart of America is strong, good and
true," he said. "The cynics were wrong
America never was a sick society."
He said the nation wants "re-dedication to
bedrock values of faith, family, work, neighbor
hood, peace and freedom."
Reagan spoke from the well of the House of
Representatives before senators, House mem
bers, the Cabinet and diplomats, as well as a na
tional radio and television audience.
His wife, Nancy, was given a seat in the
gallery, along with senior White House staffers
and wives of congressional leaders.
With the political season in full swing, the
speech was seen by the president's aides as a
major political document portraying what
Reagan views as his major accomplishments in
the economy, other domestic policies and
foreign affairs.
Lebanese reconciliation halts
Beirut, Lebanon—The government of
Lebanese President Amin Gemayel appears to
have reached a dead end in attempting to form a
new government, revive reconciliation talks
with its opposition or apply a new security plan
to avert another flare-up in the fighting here.
"Everything has come to a halt," one western
-

diplomat said.
"There are no negotiations taking place about
anything any longer at all."
An air of gloom has settled over the capital in
the past few days, and the relative quiet is being
taken by all sides as the calm before the storm.
The Lebanese press, both Christian and Mos
lem, is acting as if something ominous were at
hand, and Moslem opposition leaders are con
vinced the army is about to launch a surprise at
tack on the Shiite-dominated southern suburbs
or expand its presence by force into the coastal
region south of the capital.
Druze militia leader Walid lumblatt is calling
for the resignation of Gemayel, and he and the
Shiite Amal militia chief, Nabih Berri, say they
will not join a national coalition government un
til there is agreement on political reforms.
"What's the purpose of the government? To
do what? Without reconciliation, without us
agreeing with each other, it's for nothing," Berri
said in an interview Saturday.
Meanwhile the Christian Phalangist leader,
Pierre Gemayel, the president's father, has said
the situation is so bad that "it makes necessary a
total popular mobilization" to defend the
country's unity.
Stock prices drop

dent, in his speech yesterday, might unexpec
tedly propose tax-increase measures.
