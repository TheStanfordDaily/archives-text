Reagan says 'America is back'
Washington — President Reagan gave Congress and the na
tion yesterday an economic and foreign policy agenda
showing little change of course in the election year, declaring
"America is back, standing tall" under his leadership.
Reagan's State of the Union address shunned any major
new taxes to close the huge federal deficit, and said that
would only be a "Band-aid solution'' for "an illness that has
been coming on for half a century.''
But he did ask Congress to act on a Constitutional amend
ment that would give him "line item" veto power on ap
propriation bills: He could scuttle particular projects without
killing entire bills.
