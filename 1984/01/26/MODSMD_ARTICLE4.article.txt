# 40 protest at Education School

### MARY SMATHERS 
Some 40 bilingual educa
tion and second language in
struction students picketed in
front of Cubberley yesterday,
protesting what they feel is
the School of Education's lack
of commitment to bilingual
studies and affirmative action.
The picketers carried signs
saying, "My adviser has 60
students" and "Stanford's
commitment to cultural
pluralism and linguistic diver
sity is on the line." One
slogan, "Who gets my
$10,000?" was written in five
languages.
The students fear that the
dean and the faculty of the
school will not adequately
replace two people involved
with the bilingual education
program: Arturo Pacheco, as
sociate dean of the School of
Education, and Robert Polit
zer, a professor in applied lin
guistics.
Pacheco resigned in No
vember because, he says, of
the school's poor affirmative
action record. He will leave
the school in August.
Politzer has been ill since
last summer, and it is not
known if he will return to
Stanford.
The protesters want to see
Pacheco's position filled after
he leaves, and they want two
faculty members to take over
Politzer's position if he does
not return.
Pedro Castenada, an organ
izer of the event and a student
in the Bilingual Education Pro
gram, said the group had tried
to express its concerns with
members of the School of
Education's administration.
"We had meetings and col
lected data but it became ob
vious that the students have
no say with these people, so
we decided to go public,"
Castenada said.

One picketer said of the
turnout at the protest, "When
you see this many people out
here you know something is
wrong." There are 498 stu
dents studying in the School
of Education.
Myron Atkin, dean of the
School of Education, said of

the protest: "I wasn't there
but I understand it was non
confrontational."
The protest went on as
planned despite a meeting
Tuesday in which Atkin pro
posed a compromise plan to
