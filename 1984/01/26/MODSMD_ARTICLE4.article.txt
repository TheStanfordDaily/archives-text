# 40 protest at Education School
## 
### MARY SMATHERS 
Some 40 bilingual educa
tion and second language in
struction students picketed in
front of Cubberley yesterday,
protesting what they feel is
the School of Education's lack
of commitment to bilingual
studies and affirmative action.
The picketers carried signs
saying, "My adviser has 60
students" and "Stanford's
commitment to cultural
pluralism and linguistic diver
sity is on the line." One
slogan, "Who gets my
$10,000?" was written in five
languages.
The students fear that the
dean and the faculty of the
school will not adequately
replace two people involved
with the bilingual education
program: Arturo Pacheco, as
sociate dean of the School of
Education, and Robert Polit
zer, a professor in applied lin
guistics.
Pacheco resigned in No
vember because, he says, of
the school's poor affirmative
action record. He will leave
the school in August.
Politzer has been ill since
last summer, and it is not
known if he will return to
Stanford.
The protesters want to see
Pacheco's position filled after
he leaves, and they want two
faculty members to take over
Politzer's position if he does
not return.
Pedro Castenada, an organ
izer of the event and a student
in the Bilingual Education Pro
gram, said the group had tried
to express its concerns with
members of the School of
Education's administration.
"We had meetings and col
lected data but it became ob
vious that the students have
no say with these people, so
we decided to go public,"
Castenada said.

One picketer said of the
turnout at the protest, "When
you see this many people out
here you know something is
wrong." There are 498 stu
dents studying in the School
of Education.
Myron Atkin, dean of the
School of Education, said of

the protest: "I wasn't there
but I understand it was non
confrontational."
The protest went on as
planned despite a meeting
Tuesday in which Atkin pro
posed a compromise plan to

deal with the problem. The
proposal recommends that
one senior faculty position be
given to a scholar who spe
cializes in the area of educa
tion for language minority
children.
In addition, Atkin proposed
that a temporary non-tenure
track position be given to
someone to teach and advise
in the Second Language Edu
cation Program for at least
two years.
The School of Education
will have only one minority
faculty member after Pacheco
leaves, a figure that has
decreased significantly in the
last 10 years; at one time,
there were four minority pro
fessors in the school.
Kathie Davis, a student in
second language education
who was one of the 1
protesters, said of Atkins'
proposal, "What concerns me
is the two-year temporary po
sition. Normally in a situation
like this a temporary position
will be for five years."
According to Atkin, Polit
zer's advisees have already
been redistributed among
other School of Education
professors who have interests
in the area of language in
struction. The school has
hired Andrea Neves, a visiting
associate professor, to teach
and advise in Politzer's place
during winter and spring
quarters.
Davis said Assistant Provost
Cecilia Burciaga was present
at the meeting to say that if
minority professors are found
for the positions the provost's
office will assist in paying
their salaries.
