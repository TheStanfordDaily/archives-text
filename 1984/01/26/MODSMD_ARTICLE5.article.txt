\ A / e now you're thinking.
\/\f Apathy. No one cares anymore. The '60s are
V Vover, and except for a tew frazzled hippies, the
activists among us have dwindled and faded. There
isn't a chance in creation of finding a political phoenix
fire to stir up the denizens of the 80s.
You're all wrong.
We have it on good authority — in fact, from Stan
ford's Western Culture professors — that man is a poli
tical animal. And as it often seems to work out, the wis
dom of Aristotle is true unto itself: People ignorant of
the power that molds social conduct are as valuable as
people ignorant of the social conduct that molds
power. Together, they are worse than harmless. They
are useless.
But all is not lost. In these pages we offer you an

updated Aristotelian — the political student.
Faced with the choice between trying to change the
world and ordering another Domino's pizza, the politi
cal student does both. In attempting to achieve a bal
ance between DNA and democracy, between Chaucer
and capitalism, he protests, placards, recites, reasons
and even riots to make his politics known.
In these articles we've tried to corral the political stu
dent at Stanford, mainly by letting him describe what
he does. Hopefully it will help some of you feel a
bit more comfortable with the Stanford political zoo.
For those of you who really are apathetic, there's also
a crossword puzzle.
