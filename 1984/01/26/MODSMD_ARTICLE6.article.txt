# The
						student war at Stanford — a brief history
## 
### Lisa Lynch 
Patrick, a conservative
Stanford alumnus from
the 19705, recalled that
during his senior year he was
watching a crowd of protestors
demonstrate outside the Busi
ness School. He realized that
his freshman roommate, whom
he hadn't seen in over a year,
was leading the
crowd.
"Well," he said
to the activist, "it
looks as if we've
really gone our
seperate ways."
"Yes, it sure
does," his
estranged
roommate replied.
"I just hope that
someday I don't
catch you in the
sight of my gun,
Pat."
Apathy
doesn't
stick to
paper very well. It
is the people we
remember— the
draft-resisters, flag
burners, window
smashers, sit
inners and fist
clenchers — who
are the loudest
animals in the
bestiary of the
body politic. Here
and at other col
lege campuses stu
dent activists have
always been out
numbered but
never over
shadowed.

Apathetic beginnings
Stanford certainly didn't
begin as a 'radical' insti
tution. From the begin
nings of the University right
through the '30s and '40s, stu
dent life centered around
academics and sports, rather
than politics. The internal
politics of the University were
of constant concern.
In the 19205, for example, stu
dents battled for almost a de
cade to end proctoring here
and implement the Honor
Code. But concern for national
and international politics ran
low.
Even after World War 11,
when Stanford had gained na
tional recognition, students
were still concerned more with
the workings of the University
than with the workings of the
state.
The history of political ac
tivism here really begins in the
'60s. The Vietnam War could be
considered the first universal
rallying point for student ac
tivists, and as opposition to the
war began to take on organized
form, non-political student is
sues faded into the back
ground.
Draft dodgers
Early autumn 1965
brought the first
prominent draft protes
tors. On the Stanford campus,
David Harris held a draft-card
burning ceremony in White
Plaza and told a crowd of about
250 spectators that he'd rather
go to jail than to war.
Around the same time, the
Draft Board announced its in
tention of giving draft-eligible
men a standardized test to de
termine their eligibility for stu
dent exemption. A group of stu
dents demanded that the Uni
versity not only deny to
administer the standardized

tests, but also refuse to give the
government any information
concerning a student's grades
or rank in class.
An unsuccessful sit-in was
staged when their demands
were refused; then-President
Richard Lyman explained that it
would be inappropriate to
"make everyone subject to the
morals of a few."

During the late '60s, issue
built upon issue. Opposition to
the war led to opposition to the
draft, and finally to the opposi
tion of any figurehead or sym
bol of the military.
When Vice President Hubert
Humphrey came to campus in

estimated that $16,000 worth of
damage had been done in the
period of one month. Psychol
ogy Prof. Phil Zimbardo, English
Prof. Ron Rebholz, History Prof.
David Kennedy and other fac
ulty members placed a full-page
ad in The Daily declaring that
"ROTC has no place on the col
lege campus," but urging that
activists seek a more con-

structiVe solution to the ROTC
problem.
Bye, bye SRI

Vietnam War, about 40 stu
dents and faculty members
wearing white armbands rose at
the same time and left the
auditorium. As Humphrey him
self left, he was surrounded by
an angry, jeering mob. An ob
server at the time noted in a
press release that "the danger
to Humphrey was subsequently
overestimated . . . but this is
still the first incident of its kind
on campus . . .
Offing ROTC
On campus, students
tried to draw ties be
tween Stanford and
the war — and the for-credit
ROTC program fell under fire.
Long a thorn in the administra
tion's side, the ROTC program
became the activists' scapegoat.
The ROTC building became
the subject of repeated arson
attempts and was completely
destroyed in May 1968. Credit
for ROTC courses was discon
tinued in May 1970 — by that
time, student demonstrators
had smashed windows, rallied,
held two sit-ins and even
"trashed" several offices while
protesting the program.
At one point students trashed
the campus so badly that it was

conducted classified military re
search. The adminstration had
in fact been worrying about SRI
since the early '60s, long before
research there became a stu
dent concern. The University
contented that the time had
come to sever ties with SRI, and
free Stanford from the stigma of

An activist group called Stu

(SDS) organized what is now
know as the April Third Move

took two parts — a violent clash

Applied Electronics Lab (AEL),

classified research was con

According to Siegel, the
demonstrators included stu

"outside of the Stanford com-

supporting classified research.
But some students felt differ
ently. Lenny Siegel, a central
figure in the SRI protests, ex
plained that it was control over
SRI that the activist wanted, not
disassociation. "We wanted SRI
to discontinue classified re

the issue. About 700 people par
ticipated at the demonstration
at SRi, which was eventually dis
persed with tear gas, and about
200 people stayed for the dura
tion of the sit-in.
"One of my most vivid

memories of the whole event,"
Siegal said, "was that in the
middlp of the sit-in one
(member of Delta
Tau Delta) came
down to AEL and
said that the Delts
had decided to
support the sit-in.
At that point, we
realized that if
people like the
Delts would sup
port us, then we
pretty much had
universal support
on campus."
Siegel said that
as a student ac
tivist he was al

minority, but that
even apathetic stu
dents would rally
around the truly
important causes.
"Occasionally,
something would
trigger an outburst
of activism," he
explained.

ties with SRI; the

Declaring war on w.ir
A further "outburst of
activism" on campus
occurred the following
spring. The most prominent se
ries of student protests began
on April 24, 1970 when a crowd
of 8000 rallied at dawn in Frost

moratorium on the Vietnam
War.
On April 27, a "class boycott"
was held as a protest move
ment. Instead of attending Uni
versity classes, students were
invited to attend a "liberation
college" which offered such
courses as "The importance of
offing ROTC" and "Bored of

jailed for refusing to either fight in the war or declare conscientious objector exemption from the
draft.
