# So what's going on at other campuses?

College students nationwide don't seem to be
losing sleep over the 1984 elections.
Perhaps University of Michigan sophomore
Neil Chase puts it best. "You can't tell there is a race
going on here right now, it's not real obvious on
campus. There are no buttons or posters or anything
like that."
Mike Hirschorn, editor-in-chief of the Harvard Crim
son, observes that while "all of the candidates have
come through here, and there is quite a bit of aware
ness about the candidates, you don't see people get
ting terribly excited about anything here."
Elizabeth Greene, editorial editor of the Columbia
Spectator at Columbia University, agrees. "In terms of
what's being talked about the race is on top, but there
has been no specific activism or action for any can
didate in particular."
And across the country, the story sounds about the
same.
Of the presidential candidates, Gary Hart and Alan
Cranston seem to foster the most enthusiasm among
students. Every school interviewed by The Daily has a
support group for Hart and Hart posters decorating the
campus.
"Hart and Cranston are the most visible (at Harvard)
— especially Hart. When he was here he hung out with
the students and had a few beers," Hirschhorn says.
According to Joe Cislowski, Harvard student coordin
ator for the Cranston campaign, Cranston has also got
ten a very good response from students.
"A lot of students are enthusiastic about his message
— peace, jobs. He is concerned with ending the nu
clear arms race and a healthy economy. A lot of stu
dents identify with these issues."

Although strong anti-Reagan sentiments
pervade several campuses, students do not
seem to have clear alternative candidates in
mind.
According to Steve Johnson, managing editor of
Brown University's Daily Herald, "There is definite anti-
Reagan sentiment here. As far as any alternatives
though, I'm not really sure."
Hirschorn concurs.
"People are divided over Reaganism at Harvard.The
majority have a strong hatred for him, which does not

necessarily translate into support for Democratic candi
dates. Students are not liking Reagan but there is no
one to take his place."
But Reagan appears to be a favorite candidate at
Dartmouth College. "Reagan is by far the most popular
candidate here. In a poll we conducted he beat every
other candidate,"according to Dan Fagin, editor-in
chief of The Daily Dartmouth.
Reagan also appears to be a favorite at the University
of Chicago.
