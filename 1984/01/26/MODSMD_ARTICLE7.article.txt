# So what's going on at other campuses?

College students nationwide don't seem to be
losing sleep over the 1984 elections.
Perhaps University of Michigan sophomore
Neil Chase puts it best. "You can't tell there is a race
going on here right now, it's not real obvious on
campus. There are no buttons or posters or anything
like that."
Mike Hirschorn, editor-in-chief of the Harvard Crim
son, observes that while "all of the candidates have
come through here, and there is quite a bit of aware
ness about the candidates, you don't see people get
ting terribly excited about anything here."
Elizabeth Greene, editorial editor of the Columbia
Spectator at Columbia University, agrees. "In terms of
what's being talked about the race is on top, but there
has been no specific activism or action for any can
didate in particular."
And across the country, the story sounds about the
same.
Of the presidential candidates, Gary Hart and Alan
Cranston seem to foster the most enthusiasm among
students. Every school interviewed by The Daily has a
support group for Hart and Hart posters decorating the
campus.
"Hart and Cranston are the most visible (at Harvard)
— especially Hart. When he was here he hung out with
the students and had a few beers," Hirschhorn says.
According to Joe Cislowski, Harvard student coordin
ator for the Cranston campaign, Cranston has also got
ten a very good response from students.
"A lot of students are enthusiastic about his message
— peace, jobs. He is concerned with ending the nu
clear arms race and a healthy economy. A lot of stu
dents identify with these issues."

Although strong anti-Reagan sentiments
pervade several campuses, students do not
seem to have clear alternative candidates in
mind.
According to Steve Johnson, managing editor of
Brown University's Daily Herald, "There is definite anti-
Reagan sentiment here. As far as any alternatives
though, I'm not really sure."
Hirschorn concurs.
"People are divided over Reaganism at Harvard.The
majority have a strong hatred for him, which does not

necessarily translate into support for Democratic candi
dates. Students are not liking Reagan but there is no
one to take his place."
But Reagan appears to be a favorite candidate at
Dartmouth College. "Reagan is by far the most popular
candidate here. In a poll we conducted he beat every
other candidate,"according to Dan Fagin, editor-in
chief of The Daily Dartmouth.
Reagan also appears to be a favorite at the University
of Chicago.

"There is a fairly large set of pro-Reagan students on
campus. Generally it comes down to two or three mem
bers in each group who carry the remainder of students
less voracious in their appetite for student activism,"
says Josh Salisbury, president of the University of
Chicago Democrats.
According to Fagin, the upcoming New Hampshire
primary has sparked a great deal of student ac
tivism at Dartmouth.
"Obviously there has been a lot of action because of
the primary — more than I expected, because I think of
Dartmouth as a basically apathetic place," he says.
And other schools in the vicinity of New Hampshire
have been similarly affected by the primary.
"Boston is close to New Hampshire, one of the first
presidential battle grounds," says Harvard's Cislowski.
"Being so close to the battlefield, its almost hard to be

apathetic. We are sending up students every
weekend."
Many students interviewed say they strongly distin
guish between not caring about the presidential race
and not actively campaigning for a candidate.
"Dartmouth students care, but it depends what you
call caring. They are not really willing to pour out their
heart and soul to one candidate, but they vote. There
are lots of things to do, not the least of which is class,"
according to Fagin .
Other students say they feel that it is still too
early in the campaign to expect much stu
dent interest.
"Brown students are not really that excited yet. We
just switched calendars, and people are more worried
about getting finals done.lt will probably pick up as we
get into the semester," says Johnson.
David Kranzler, student financial manager at Oberlin
College, echoes Johnson's sentiments.
" Right now there is not too much going on as far as
the presidential race is concerned," he says. "In Octo
ber we will be holding mock elections. Right now the

popular candidate is Mondale, and Republican support
is nil."
Salisbury concurred: "Many students here at
Chicago have opinions, but not all are engaging in
politically active work.As we move into the primaries
more and more people are getting involved."
And even at Berkeley, the radical outpost of the '60s,
student activism seems relatively tame, at least accor
ding to Ed Weiss, a junior who works to bring as many
candidates to the campus as possible.
"All the candidates have been invited. There is more
activism here than on other campuses, although not as
much as you'd expect," he says.
Chuck Mortell, editor of the University of Wisconsin's
Daily Cardinal, put the present trend of apathy into a
more historical perspective.
"Maybe students are apathetic to some extent, but
some issues like the nuclear arms race come home to
every student," he says. "You don't see thousands of
people milling around in the streets — Vietnam-type ac
tivism is not visible, but given the generally apathetic
climate of the '80 s I'm not inclined to expect it."
