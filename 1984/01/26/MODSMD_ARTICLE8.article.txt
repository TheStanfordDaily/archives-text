# SCAAN: marching and writing for change
## 
### Tarek Hamada 
SCAAN is a group that acts on its beliefs.
When American and Caribbean forces
invaded the Marxist-ruled island of Grenada on
Tuesday, Oct. 25, 1983, the Stanford Central America
Action Network (SCAAN) got to work.
While people across the world were stunned and
groping for details about the invasion, several mem
bers of the group immediately met and planned a
protest march from White Plaza to Secretary of State
George Shultz's campus home. They also started work
on a teach-in about the invasion.
The next day, SCAAN held its weekly meeting at 7:30
p.m. in the El Centro Chicano Lounge at Old Union.
The proposed protest march and teach-in were an
nounced to the rest of the group's active membership.
The group agreed to forge ahead, broke up into com
mittees and put together the events.
Flyers and leaflets were drawn up. Possible speakers
on the invasion were contacted. The meeting ended at
3 a.m.
That Thursday evening, more than 300 people gath
ered at Jordan Hall to listen to three Stanford profes
sors express their concerns about the U.S. invasion of
Grenada.
Another 400 people marched to Shultz's house on
Sunday and presented a letter — signed by 13 Stanford
and Bay Area organizations — opposing the invasion.
Although this is a dramatic example of SCAAN's
commitment to campus activism, it is by far
not the only example. The three-year-old
group has published a 500-page collection of articles on
the crisis in Central America, sponsored numerous
demonstrations and rallies, lobbied Congressmen and
provided assistance to political refugees from El Sal
vador.
In addition, SCAAN has a weekly radio show, and
members gave 15 speeches fall quarter about Central
America.
"SCAAN is not a group of people who sit around
twiddling their thumbs," said Brad Barham, a third-year
graduate student in economics who has been a mem
ber for almost three years. "We want to be active."
Jo Anne Scott, a SCAAN member for three years, said
the group's energy comes from its commitment to one
idea: that the United States should end its military in
volvement in Central America.
"The issue of U.S. intervention in Central America is
something that doesn't take a whole lot of debate,"
Scott said. "It is an issue that generates indignation.
People at SCAAN are relieved to find a group with
whom to ally themselves and take action. People get in
spired by being able to do something about a situation
that can seem kind of hopeless."
"SCAAN is particulary well run," said Julie Fouquet,
a fourth-year doctoral student in applied physics who
joined the group last September. "SCAAN provides a
great educational function."
SCAAN evolved from a group of graduate stu
dents who supported the Sandinista-led
Nicaraguan Revolution of 1979. Several mem
bers argued that the group should also focus on the
problems of Central America. The rest of the group
agreed, and SCAAN was born.
Perhaps nothing better demonstrates the extent of
SCAAN's interest in Central America than the book it
edited, "Revolution in Central America."

About 20 SCAAN members spent three years search
ing for, editing and proofreading articles for the book,
which was published in 1983.
Scott, one of the editors, said SCAAN members dis
covered in 1980 that there was no comprehensive book
on problems in Central America.
"It was a pretty arcane subject," she said. "But when
we found some good stuff we thought maybe other
people would like to use this too."
The book juxtaposes scholarly articles, journalistic
reports and political manifestos. A carefully written
chapter explaining the relationship between U.S.
foreign policy and human rights violations in Latin
America is followed by a harrowing report on
government-sponsored terror in Guatemala.
The book is sympathetic to the Nicaraguan govern-

ment, hostile to the region's right-wing regimes and
critical of U.S. policy.
The book's point of view reflects SCAAN's.
"What we define as human rights in Central America
are the rights to food, health care, education and
jobs," said Majdalena Rosales, a 1983 Stanford graduate
who has worked in SCAAN for two years. "I think those
rights are being violated in El Salvador. In Nicaragua,
people have jobs, educational programs and health
care."
Charles Hale, a second-year graduate student in an
thropology, said he has learned in his two years at
SCAAN that human rights violations in Nicaragua can
not be compared to injustice in El Salvador.
"Sure, there are problems in Nicaragua," Hale said.

"But in El Salvador, you are talking about massacres of
people.
"The most important principle we stand for at
SCAAN is that the people in Central American
countries have the right to determine for themselves
what happens."
Belief in that principle has compelled SCAAN to
mount an organized campaign in the U.S.
Congress against aid to El Salvador.
SCAAN's five-member legislative committee has
used pressure and political favors to lobby congress
men Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) and Ed Zschau (R-
Menlo Park).
Its work seems to have paid off. In February 1983,
the congressmen helped cut aid to El Salvador by $100
million when they voted in the House Foreign Affairs
Committee to reduce aid to El Salvador to $50 million
from $150 million. The committee's vote on the pro
posal was 18-16.
In July 1983, Lantos and Zschau voted to end U.S.
support for covert activities against Nicaragua.
Barham counts Lantos as one politician who changed
his stance on aid to El Salvador because of SCAAN's ef
forts.
SCAAN made Lantos aware of its stance against aid to
El Salvador by refusing to allow him to speak in the
spring quarter of 1982 at a "Hooverville/Reaganville"
demonstration. SCAAN sponsored the demonstration
with other campus groups.
The group told Lantos that he had to support ending
aid to El Salvador before he could speak. Lantos
refused and did not speak at the demonstration.
"When he didn't speak, it started to make him
think," Barham said. "A week before the demonstra
tion, we brought him 1000 letters that said it was impor
tant for the U.S. to stop intervening in El Salvador.
"That summer, we negotiated with him and we said
we would back his campaign and register Stanford
voters if he would come around to SCAAN's position
on El Salvador."
Lantos agreed to the deal. SCAAN registered 3000
Stanford students and campaigned for Lantos on
campus. In the fall 1982 election, Lantos carried Stan
ford by a 2-1 margin.
SCAAN was suddenly a good friend of Lantos.
"It looked like we had just pulled off a major victory
for him," Barham said. "We visited him (after the elec
tion) and he was all sugar and cream. We had set up a
relationship with him."
Zschau has been difficult to convince because as a
Republican he cannot stray far from the Reagan admin
istration, Barham said.
SCAAN regularly sends Lantos and Zschau informa
tion about issues in El Salvador and SCAAN's stance on
them.
"We think of ourselves as ants," he said. "We keep
marching to them."
SCAAN members said they are as determined to
work against U.S. intervention in El Salvador as ants are
when they build an ant hill.
"I was upset about the posibility of a war in Central
America when I joined SCAAN," Fouquet said. "I got in
SCAAN as a way of countering a very bad situation."
Scott views her involvement in personal terms.
"I feel that my psychic well-being has to do with
things that are happening in other parts of the world,"
she said. "I have always had a notion that I want to be a
citizen of the world and not just a North American."
