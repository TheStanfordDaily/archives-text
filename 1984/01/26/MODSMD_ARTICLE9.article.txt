# Progressives: icebergs for the Love Boat?

### Charlie Gofen 
/ / Ik I ow that Presi
dent Reagan has
I dubbed the MX
missile 'the peacekeeper,' can
we expect him to rename the
aircraft carrier Nimitz 'the Love
Boat?"
You may have read this pas
sage before, in the letters to the
editor section of The Progres
sive — the year-old tabloid of
the Stanford Progressive Al
liance (SPA). The Progressive's
architects say they created the
eight-page publication "to
promote awareness, interest
and activity on political, social
and public policy issues."
Love Boat or not — perhaps
some SPA members might
prefer an analogy to the Titanic
— self-styled progressives here
continue their battle against
"discrimination and sexism,"
and for "social justice and, gen
erally, non-intervention in
foreign affairs."
That's how Paul Baer puts it.
Baer is SPA treasurer and one of
four members of the group's
central board, the Steering and
Finance Committee.
But what's a progressive?
"Kind of a catch
phrase for liberal," he
explains. "We defend human
rights and equality. We oppose,
for instance, the gross ine

qualities of wealth in Central
America."
SPA is a consortium of
campus groups; affiliates in
clude Stanford Against Con
scription (SAC, in which Baer is
active), the Stanford African
Student Association (SASA), the
Democratic Socialists of
America (DSA), the Committee
for Justice in the Middle East
(CO|ME), the Black Student
Union (BSU) and the Stanford
Central America Action Net
work (SCAAN).
In the late 1970 s, the existing
liberal student coalition at Stan
ford faded; it was revived about
three years ago. But SPA suf
fered a major setback last spring
when it lost in the annual ASSU
fee assessment election.
In fact, The Progressive only
appears quarterly this year due
to insufficient funding.
Baer cites three reasons for
the loss.
"We don't have wide support
on campus," he says."The pro
gressive sector is not large
here."
His second explanation deals
with last spring's new ASSU
election rules. Only students
who voted in the 1983 election
were eligible for ASSU refunds.
This stipulation caused "a lot of
people who didn't care about
our organization" to vote, and
they mainly voted against

SPA, according to Baer.
And The Daily's editorial
board, which Baer calls "highly
read and reasonably
respected," did not give the
SPA an endorsement.
"I'm sure that The Daily's en
dorsement has a great influence
on students," says Vinnie
Freda, the member of the
Council of Presidents who over
sees ASSU finances.
SPA, which received between
$16,000 and $17,000 last year
from the ASSU, was given only
$600 in "operating funds" by the
ASSU Program Board this year,
according to Baer. This limits
the effectiveness of SPA and
checks many of its plans.
Baer states that SPA will
receive more funds this year for
upcoming programs, but notes
the $4000 limit the Program
Board may give to a single
group.
"We have gotten funding
from many sources in the past,"
adds Baer — from such organi
zations as the Office of Student
Activities, Memorial Church
and individual theme houses.
"We were able to do much
more last year because we had
more money."
The editorial introduc
tion to The Progres
sive's first issue of 1983-
M confined its chief concerns
to "racism, imperialism,

hunger, oppression, sexism,
militarism, and other improve
the-quality-of-life-on-this-
planet issues."
Last year's editions, which
came out about once each three
weeks, included essays on vir
tually every one of these issues.
"The main function of The Pro
gressive is to be informative,"
says Mark Mazur, another
member of the SPA Steering
and Finance Committee, who
works on the publication. "We
print a calendar of upcoming
events of interest to SPA mem
bers as well as essays that
promote discussion."
Mazur describes the purpose
of the SPA. "The coalition
promotes interaction between
groups for education and for
political action . . . Leaders

meet other leaders and the
groups do joint work."
Past events that SPA has
worked on include various
week-long series — for which it
invited guest speakers — on
sexism, militarism and a
bilateral nuclear freeze.
Baer hopes that SPA's events
"educate people and get them
more involved in progressive
political action." He said an up
coming SPA-organized full-day
workshop Saturday will offer
students a chance to learn
about coalitions from assorted
lecturers — including David
Harris, an anti-draft activist.
The workshop, entitled
"Building Coalitions: Past and
Present," will consist of panels
in the morning and small-group
discussions in the afternoon.
"I think that no other groups
do this kind of project, because
they're too concerned with
their own interests," says Scott
Summers, a member of Stan
ford's Democratic Socialist Al
liance chapter who developed
the funding proposal for the
SPA workshop.
Interaction seems crucial to
SPA. Similar ideals brought the
various groups together.
And they're the same groups
that will determine SPA's
future.
