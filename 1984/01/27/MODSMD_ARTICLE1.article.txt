# Killer of prof 'noncommital' on killing again
## 
### 
The murderer of a Stanford math
professor told a local newspaper
yesterday that he is "absolutely non
commital" on whether he will come
back to campus and kill again.
Theodore Streleski, who has
served more than five years of an
eight-year sentence he received for
killing Prof, karel deLeeuw with a
two-pound hammer, expressed <o
remorse over his actions in an rer
view with The Peninsula Times
Tribune yesterday.
The 47-year-old convicted mur
derer is due to be released from
Soledad Prison on March 23. The
terms of his parole bar him from
visiting Stanford.
Streleski has been in custody
since he killed deLeeuw in the pro
fessor's campus office on Aug. 18,
1978.
The police are taking precautions
to ensure that Streleski does not
return to campus, though officials
admit that there is not much that can
be done to keep him away fiom
Stanford.
In his trial, Streleski claimed that
deLeeuw was obstructing his prog
ress towards his Ph.D. degree in
mathematics. Streleski had been a
doctoral candidate in the Math De
partment for 19 years.
Streleski also said he resented
remarks deLeeuw had made about
Streleski's shoes.
In the interview yesterday,
Streleski called Math Prof. David
Cilbarg "a super jerk" and repeated
his assertion that Cilbarg, former
chairman of the department, had

been an alternative victim in his
quest to exact revenge from the Uni
versity.
Members of the math department
have refused to speak to the press,
fearing that anvone making a state
ment about the murder might
become a possible target for
Streleski s revenge.
Streleski, who refused psychiatric
help while in prison, also said in an
interview on KRON-TV yesterday
that he had received a sense of
"constructive achievement" from
the murder of deLeeuw.
In the television interview,
Streleski coolly talked about the
manner in which he had killed
deLeeuw and maintained that the
murder was a "morally correct" ac
tion.
The former graduate student
pleaded diminished capacity and
was convicted of second-degree
murder in May 1979. He was given
an eight-year prison term, the maxi
mum allowed at the time.
A diminished capacity defense,
which has been abolished since
Streliski's arrest, claims that though
the murder may have been commit
ted with malice, the defendant was
mentally impaired and therefore
unable to premeditate the murder.
Streleski was given the standard
reduction in sentence for good be
havior and received credit for the
time he served before his convic
tion.
