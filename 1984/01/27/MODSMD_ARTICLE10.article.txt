# Hoover Institution plans security research program

### DIANE PATTERSON 
A plan to create a national security
research program here has been set
into motion by the Hoover Institu
tion.
The planned program will encour
age greater exchange of information
between experts in the field of na
tional security — an area a Hoover
spokesman said the Institution
regards as foremost among national
priorities in the coming years.
Dennis Bark, the Institution's
director of national security pro
grams and a senior research fellow,
said he believes that previous to
Hoover's new program there had
never been much structure or coor
dination to exchanges of informa
tion between professionals in this
field of research.
The new program will create more
"inter-information," according to
Bark. This will allow researchers to
avoid duplication of efforts, to coor
dinate their efforts in their studies
and to present their ideas for their
colleagues prior to their being

released formally in a journal or
other publication.
In order to achieve these goals,
Hoover is arranging a series of for
mal and informal meetings for parti
cipants. These include publications,
seminars and conferences.
He added that on the informal
side, "There are luncheons every
Tuesday at the Faculty Club," with
different guest speakers every
week. Past topics have included in
ternational economics, world popu
lation and the food supply and the
debate over the role of Soviet troops
in Eastern Europe.
Bark said he hopes to arrange for
speakers on new topics, like the
climactic shifts going on with the
earth's weather and what effect
these changes may have on food
production and other areas of con
cern.
"Anyone who is interested may
attend these lunches," Bark said,
provided that are members or at
tend with a member, according to
the rules of "the faculty Club.

Other meetings, such as coffees,
are by invitation only. "There's
usually somebody there from the
Business School or the Law School,"
Bark said. "We send invitations to
undergraduate departments, such
as History or Political Science."
Students can be admitted to these
meetings by way of a faculty invita
tion, but generally only research fac
ulty are invited.
The exact amount of money that
Hoover plans to spend on its nation
al security affairs program has not
yet been calculated, Bark said. Na
tional security affairs research goes
under th f> title of domestic affairs in
the Hoover budget. The budget for
research in domestic and foreign af
fairs is 47 percent of Hoover's total
expenditures, estimated at $9.3 mil
lion in 1983-1984.
With this new program, the
Hoover Institution has organized
many of its senior fellows involved
in work related to national security.
These include Richard Allen, Milton
Friedman, Philip Habib, Seymour
Lipset and Edward Teller.
