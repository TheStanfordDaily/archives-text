# Libertarian Bill Evers: His candidate will lose and his Fiat won't run
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Bill Evers opens the right door of his dirty
avocado Fiat.
He puts his leather briefcase on the pas
senger seat and reaches across the inside of
the car to unlock the other door.
He walks around the back of the Fiat,
opens the driver's side door and gets in. He
starts the car.
But when Evers finally backs out of his
parking space, the Fiat stalls.
There's a metaphor there somewhere.
As national campaign manager for the
Libertarian Party's presidential candidate,
Stanford graduate Bill Evers will spend the
next eight months campaigning for David
Bergland.
And then Bergland will lose.
The cars stalls. The candidate loses. But
Bill Evers isn't giving up.
"We're not going to sweep the electoral
college," Evers says, "but we're going to try
to get the moral issues across."
There are a lot of those "moral issues" in
question when a Libertarian runs for office.
Libertarians aren't big fans of the American

status quo. And they aren't shy about
saying so.
"We, the members of the Libertarian
Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent
state and defend the rights of the individ
ual," begins the Statement Principles of the
Libertarian Party of California.
"Within the United States, all political
parties other than our own grant the gov
ernment the right to regulate the lives of in
dividuals and seize the fruits of their labor
without their consent. We, on the contrary,
deny the right of any government to do
these things, and hold that, where govern
ments do exist, their sole function is to
protect the rights of any individual."
Not exactly the generic oatmeal that
makes up the Democratic and Republican
platforms every four years. But then, that's
just the point.
"The Libertarian Party was formed
precisely as a response to the policies of the
Republicans and Democrats — policies
which we believe are primarily responsible
for the host of problems Americans face
today."

That's the party line from a party bro
chure. And Bill Evers, a man who says he
started thinking in the Libertarian way
during his high school years in Massachu
setts, will tell you the same thing.
"The Libertarian Party basically continues
the ideas of radical Jeffersonianism," he
says. "Roll back big government, anti-taxes,
a consistent and rigorous bill of rights, civil
liberties, no entangling alliances, no
foreign wars, no subsidies to business, no
welfare state . . .
And that's just the beginning.
But Bill Evers knows that*sort of radical
reform of the American political system will
not happen overnight.
"We have a big job," Evers says."The
current consensus, including President
Reagan, supports a very big — what we
would call oppressive — government."
But Evers has a plan to attack that "big
job." He knows it won't get his candidate
elected. But it might get his party some at
tention.
"We're basically trying to do a different
sort of thing than the other candidates. We

have to go to the smaller towns, where
we're big news," Evers says between swal
lows of a Heineken Dark at the Coffee
House. "When we go to New York City or
Los Angeles, they cover us, but we're not
major news. In Allentown, Pennsylvania,
we're major news. In Auburn, California,
we're big news."
If Evers and Bergland are lucky, they'll
match the success of their party's 1980 con
gressional candidate, Ed Clark. Clark got
just under a million votes — about 1 per
cent of the total votes cast.
For Libertarians, that's a success.
"I would like to do better than we did last
time," Evers says, not too optimistically.
"We spent about $3.5 million in 1980, and I
would be very surprised if we could spend
that much this year. In 1980 we doubled our
contributor list. That's not the sort of thing
that can continue forever, but I think we
can increase it again."
Evers is no stranger to running campaigns
— unsuccessful campaigns.
He ran against Pete McCloskey for the
12th congressional district seat in 1980. He
lost. Last year, Evers headed Cassandra
Moore's campaign for Palo Alto City Coun
cil. She lost.
Evers admits that, for now at least, Liber
tarians are going to have to be happy with
gains less tangible than election victories.
According to the party's own estimates,
only 30 Libertarians won electoral victories
in local cities and counties by 1983.
But the party has had one honest-to
goodness political success story. And if you
read a Libertarian pamphlet or brochure,
you're bound to find out about it. Dick Ran
dolph, as a Libertarian representative in the
1978-82 Alaska legislature, led a successful
fight to repeal the state income tax.
Evers is still optimistic.
"I have long-term optimism," he says,
"but I think I have a realistic short-term per
spective."
Evers may have reason to be optimistic.
The Libertarian Party is growing fast. In
1972, a year after the party began, Liber
tarians numbered themselves at 5000. By
1980, that number had increased to
2,500,000.

"The really hard-core libertarians make
up about one percent ot the electorate
nationwide," I Vers < I,urns. "Many more are
sympathetic to our sidtements but ire still
voting for one of the tiv > pa>'m l out 1 ->
percent. But it you ay 'Are your taxC! too
high?' or 'Should commui'i .is lallowed
to speak in our society? you'll get a
majority."
Libertarianism "i; •er much a cross
sectioned cross-classed viewpoint. Rut
naturally at any ;ne time it's going to
become more attractive' to whatever
group is a target ol government regulation.

However, Evers and the Libertarians say,
everyone eventually suffers at the hands of
the "cult of the omnipotent state."
"My basic long-term optimism is that I
think the political culture is sympathetic to
leffersonian politics. What the vast majority
wants can't be delivered by a more reg
ulated society than we have now. I think
there's reason to be long-term optimistic."
But in the meantime, Evers and the Liber
tarians will have to wait — and keep run
ning.
If this long-run perspective pays off for
Evers, someday the United States will have
a Libertarian president.
And Bill Evers will have a car that won't
stall in the parking lot.

"I have long-term optimism," he says,
"but I think I have a realistic short-term per
spective."
Evers may have reason to be optimistic.
The Libertarian Party is growing fast. In
1972, a year after the party began, Liber
tarians numbered themselves at 5000. By
1980, that number had increased to
2,500,000.

"The really hard-core libertarians make
up about one percent ot the electorate
nationwide," I Vers < I,urns. "Many more are
sympathetic to our sidtements but ire still
voting for one of the tiv > pa>'m l out 1 ->
percent. But it you ay 'Are your taxC! too
high?' or 'Should commui'i .is lallowed
to speak in our society? you'll get a
majority."
Libertarianism "i; •er much a cross
sectioned cross-classed viewpoint. Rut
naturally at any ;ne time it's going to
become more attractive' to whatever
group is a target ol government regulation.

However, Evers and the Libertarians say,
everyone eventually suffers at the hands of
the "cult of the omnipotent state."
"My basic long-term optimism is that I
think the political culture is sympathetic to
leffersonian politics. What the vast majority
wants can't be delivered by a more reg
ulated society than we have now. I think
there's reason to be long-term optimistic."
But in the meantime, Evers and the Liber
tarians will have to wait — and keep run
ning.
If this long-run perspective pays off for
Evers, someday the United States will have
a Libertarian president.
And Bill Evers will have a car that won't
stall in the parking lot.

Bill Evers
Bill Evers opens the right door of his dirty
avocado Fiat.
He puts his leather briefcase on the pas
senger seat and reaches across the inside of
the car to unlock the other door.
He walks around the back of the Fiat,
opens the driver's side door and gets in. He
starts the car.
But when Evers finally backs out of his
parking space, the Fiat stalls.
There's a metaphor there somewhere.
As national campaign manager for the
Libertarian Party's presidential candidate,
Stanford graduate Bill Evers will spend the
next eight months campaigning for David
Bergland.
And then Bergland will lose.
The cars stalls. The candidate loses. But
Bill Evers isn't giving up.
"We're not going to sweep the electoral
college," Evers says, "but we're going to try
to get the moral issues across."
There are a lot of those "moral issues" in
question when a Libertarian runs for office.
Libertarians aren't big fans of the American

status quo. And they aren't shy about
saying so.
"We, the members of the Libertarian
Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent
state and defend the rights of the individ
ual," begins the Statement Principles of the
Libertarian Party of California.
"Within the United States, all political
parties other than our own grant the gov
ernment the right to regulate the lives of in
dividuals and seize the fruits of their labor
without their consent. We, on the contrary,
deny the right of any government to do
these things, and hold that, where govern
ments do exist, their sole function is to
protect the rights of any individual."
Not exactly the generic oatmeal that
makes up the Democratic and Republican
platforms every four years. But then, that's
just the point.
"The Libertarian Party was formed
precisely as a response to the policies of the
Republicans and Democrats — policies
which we believe are primarily responsible
for the host of problems Americans face
today."

That's the party line from a party bro
chure. And Bill Evers, a man who says he
started thinking in the Libertarian way
during his high school years in Massachu
setts, will tell you the same thing.
"The Libertarian Party basically continues
the ideas of radical Jeffersonianism," he
says. "Roll back big government, anti-taxes,
a consistent and rigorous bill of rights, civil
liberties, no entangling alliances, no
foreign wars, no subsidies to business, no
welfare state . . .
And that's just the beginning.
But Bill Evers knows that*sort of radical
reform of the American political system will
not happen overnight.
"We have a big job," Evers says."The
current consensus, including President
Reagan, supports a very big — what we
would call oppressive — government."
But Evers has a plan to attack that "big
job." He knows it won't get his candidate
elected. But it might get his party some at
tention.
"We're basically trying to do a different
sort of thing than the other candidates. We

have to go to the smaller towns, where
we're big news," Evers says between swal
lows of a Heineken Dark at the Coffee
House. "When we go to New York City or
Los Angeles, they cover us, but we're not
major news. In Allentown, Pennsylvania,
we're major news. In Auburn, California,
we're big news."
If Evers and Bergland are lucky, they'll
match the success of their party's 1980 con
gressional candidate, Ed Clark. Clark got
just under a million votes — about 1 per
cent of the total votes cast.
For Libertarians, that's a success.
"I would like to do better than we did last
time," Evers says, not too optimistically.
"We spent about $3.5 million in 1980, and I
would be very surprised if we could spend
that much this year. In 1980 we doubled our
contributor list. That's not the sort of thing
that can continue forever, but I think we
can increase it again."
Evers is no stranger to running campaigns
— unsuccessful campaigns.
He ran against Pete McCloskey for the
12th congressional district seat in 1980. He
lost. Last year, Evers headed Cassandra
Moore's campaign for Palo Alto City Coun
cil. She lost.
Evers admits that, for now at least, Liber
tarians are going to have to be happy with
gains less tangible than election victories.
According to the party's own estimates,
only 30 Libertarians won electoral victories
in local cities and counties by 1983.
But the party has had one honest-to
goodness political success story. And if you
read a Libertarian pamphlet or brochure,
you're bound to find out about it. Dick Ran
dolph, as a Libertarian representative in the
1978-82 Alaska legislature, led a successful
fight to repeal the state income tax.
Evers is still optimistic.
