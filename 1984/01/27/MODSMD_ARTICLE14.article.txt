# The
						Stanford Daily
## editor's farewell 
### 
We'll never know how we've been changed:
what transcendent insight we've gained in
s tmeone meeting, or not, a d< adline, what
■mile ovei a crossword puzzle got us through a
me we otherwise wouldn't have survived, or
what beautiful stranger remains a stranger for
the party passed.
For most of you, the quotation means little.
For Daily staffers, it provokes an inkling of un
derstanding, while for me — and its author, a
former Daily editor— it encompasses and con
trasts the myriad of emotions that have
aressed or slapped us.
You — the members of the Stanford commu
lity — see the paper as a product, as a source
1 information; the emotions it may stir in you
.ire simple ones: a chuckle at a cartoon or a fist
pounded at an incorrect fact.
For the first class of sentiments, I am glad,
or the mistakes — perceived or real — I
apologize. But I thank you for the continued
realization that the paper is the result of stu
dent energies. At Thie Daily we receive a
inique education, and like most in an academ
c community, we battle diligently against error
ind toward perfection.
Mistakes are made, however, but at The Dai
y, no matter how unattractive a grimace they
nay provoke, we are able to push them off
,vith — finally — a smile and a solid
emembrance that may prevent a similar error
rom happening again.
Those smiles, and innumerable others, for
ne, have been elicited or, at times, eked out
ly the people with whom I have worked.
fhe Daily has a cast of characters; two true
haracters, Troy Eid and Tim Grieve, I thank for
nspiring me time and again with their own in
nirations. They are suberb reminders that life

isn't tun without some absurdity.
Bob Cohn, Art Streiber and Greg Webb have
too provided their bits of absurdity, along with
possibly unsurpassed care tor the paper. Art
and Greg's brotherly teasing could not have
been received more happily it it had come
from siblings. And watching Bob tall in love
with The Daily, in a way that reminds me only
of myself in time past, has been a delight.
My successor, Adam Goodman, receives the
credit and abundant thanks tor pushing me, in
spiring me last year to love the paper and the
work that goes along with it, and this year to
think and re-think our actions — both large
and small.
Douglas lehl I thank tor not talking me out of
running for editor, and also for bouts of open
ness that keep a strange friendship alive.
left' Biddulph, Kathy Olmsted and Heather
Millar I thank for their distinct forms of dedica
tion, for giving me confidence that their work
will be thoughttully accomplished.
As for our companions in ASSU Typesetting,
I appreciate their fine art of pretending to en
joy their work even when we make it
miserable, and what I sense is real care for the
paper's quality.
And finally, everyone who has put in time —
department editors, writers, photographers,
artists and the business staff (yes, that includes
Tom Nelson and Diane Johnson) — should
know that I love the paper enough to be thank
ful for any effort that is put into it.
As for myself, it's back to a world of beautiful
strangers but it will be a tough task for their
radiance to surpass what I have left behind.
