Suppose you were entrusted by the public
with $11,000 worth of tax money. You've been
tr\ing to find some way to spend the money,
i hen one day you are approached by someone
in another organization who has a "great" plan
but no money. You decide to go for it — even
though you told the public you would be
spending their money on other projects.
Remember the ASSU lobby office? They had
a fee assessment proposal on the ballot last
spring. The students turned them down by a
whopping 609 vote margin. The Program
Board, however, ignored the student mandate
and voted to give more than $4000 to the Lobby
Office. This was done to phase the program
out slowly.
Now the Lobby Office wants to have a three
day political conference featuring government
officials. Only there's a problem — they don't
have enough money to finance this $27,833 ex
travaganza.
Enter the Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE). Two years ago SCOPE won
a fee assessment election and taxed $11,000

from the student body. The ASSU forgot to col
lect the money for a couple of quarters, but it's
now sitting in a bank account.
The Lobby Office needs the money and
SCOPE has it. So they pull a little switch-a-roo
and presto — the Lobby Office gets SCOPE'S
money.
There's a problem, however: The Office of
Student Activities must determine whether
SCOPE is the real "SCOPE." Apparently, the
organization has only one member, who got
four non-member friends sign a student group
registration form. He did this in order to trans
fer the group's remaining funds to the Lobby
Office.
He's forgetting one thing: The studerits don't
want their money to be spent by the Lobby Of
fice. SCOPE was given the money to fund a
spcit'ic budget with specific goals. It was not
funded to be a money-changer for the Lobby
Office.
Hopefully, the OSA and ASSU Senate will
see this scam for what it really is. We can think
of a lot of better ways to spend the $11,000.
