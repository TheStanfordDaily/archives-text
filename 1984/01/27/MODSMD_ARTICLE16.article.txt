## Foundation threatens neutrality 
### 
Under the guise of a compromise Edwin Meese has
offered Stanford University a proposal which, if
adopted, threatens to subvert the political neutrality
and academic integrity of a great university.
The Meese plan represents a bold move to un
dermine the very principles of political neutrality and
academic governance that University President Donald
Kennedy, in his Jan. 18, 1984 statement, seeks to up
hold. As such, the plan should be rejected by the Uni
versity and the Board of Trustees as unacceptable on its
face: There should be and there must be no compro
mise on the principle of academic governance of the
proposed Reagan center for public affairs.
In its )an. 24 editorial, The Stanford Daily endorsed
Donald Kennedy's stress on preserving "both the fact
and the appearance of political neutrality" and the
paper asked: "Who can guarantee that the President
Reagan foundation would not be composed of — and
administered by — a partisan body? Couldn't this cen
ter become the creation of a Hoover-like entity over
which the University has no control?
We agree and we call upon all those members of the
Stanford community who care about defending the
University against these political threats to make their
views known to President Kennedy and the Board of
trustees before Stanford suffers irreparable harm from
those who would misuse the University for their own
political ends.
Removing the Hoover Institution from direct control
of the Reagan center for public affairs appears on the
surface to be a victory for the University, but the
Hoover issue has now been replaced by an even
greater threat: A Reagan center run by the Ronald
Reagan foundation totally free of control, in Meese's
words by Hoover, or "other elements" of the Univer
sity. These other "elements" of the University include
the faculty and University administration. Any plan that
omits such control opens up the possibility of the
politicization of the University and the expansion of the
partisan political activities already pursued by the
Hoover Institution.
Given the past behavior of the Hoover Institution,
how much confidence can the Stanford community
have in W. Glenn Campbell's assurances that the
"President Reagan foundation will ensure that the
highest scholarly standards are observed. . . ?"
Adding a sister institution — the Ronald Reagan foun
dation — to Stanford may seem to remove Hoover from
direct influence over the Reagan center for Public Af

fairs, but it is not likely to satisfy anyone who is con
cerned about protecting the University from being
used on behalf of particular political causes.
If these proposals are accepted Stanford University
will house and expand the most powerful bastions of
conservative political thought, research, and scholar
ship in the nation. As we have noted repeatedly over
the past several months, the Hoover Institution alone
presents a grave problem to the University's reputation
for objectivity and neutrality. With the addition of a
privately financed and privately run Reagan foundation
and center, the University cannot help but be en
meshed even further in the political causes
represented by Hoover and the Reagan wing of the Re
publican Party.
Many members of the Stanford community have told
us how heartened they were by Donald Kennedy's Jan.
18 statement which seems to rule out precisely the kind
of "compromise'' offered by Meese.
In that statement President Kennedy repeatedly reaf
firmed his commitment to preserving the
"independence" of the University, and he noted that
"a foundation to be created for a presidential center
. . . would be formed for the purpose of maintaining
such a center on behalf of a public figure with a particu
lar political philosophy."
Kennedy noted further that "such a center ... would
inevitably be viewed as connected with the University
— indeed, it is only to the extent that there is some
connection, however informal, that there is any point
at all in its placement at Stanford."
"There can be no convincing assurances," Kennedy
said, "that a center organized independently of the
University and functioning merely as a lessee would be
governed in accord with normal academic stand
ards"— and it is, we believe, precisely for this reason
that the Meese proposal must be rejected.
In his Jan. 18 statement President Kennedy also ex
plicitly rejects the model proposed by Meese in his Jan.
17 letter to the Board of Trustees. The Center for Ad
vanced Studies in Behavioral Sciences, Kennedy said,
"originated from an established charitable foundation
with a history of support for the improvement of higher
education; neither the foundation nor CASBS was asso
ciated with any doctrine or school of thought within the
behavioral sciences . .

surface to be a victory for the University, but the
Hoover issue has now been replaced by an even
greater threat: A Reagan center run by the Ronald
Reagan foundation totally free of control, in Meese's
words by Hoover, or "other elements" of the Univer
sity. These other "elements" of the University include
the faculty and University administration. Any plan that
omits such control opens up the possibility of the
politicization of the University and the expansion of the
partisan political activities already pursued by the
Hoover Institution.
Given the past behavior of the Hoover Institution,
how much confidence can the Stanford community
have in W. Glenn Campbell's assurances that the
"President Reagan foundation will ensure that the
highest scholarly standards are observed. . . ?"
Adding a sister institution — the Ronald Reagan foun
dation — to Stanford may seem to remove Hoover from
direct influence over the Reagan center for Public Af

fairs, but it is not likely to satisfy anyone who is con
cerned about protecting the University from being
used on behalf of particular political causes.
If these proposals are accepted Stanford University
will house and expand the most powerful bastions of
conservative political thought, research, and scholar
ship in the nation. As we have noted repeatedly over
the past several months, the Hoover Institution alone
presents a grave problem to the University's reputation
for objectivity and neutrality. With the addition of a
privately financed and privately run Reagan foundation
and center, the University cannot help but be en
meshed even further in the political causes
represented by Hoover and the Reagan wing of the Re
publican Party.
Many members of the Stanford community have told
us how heartened they were by Donald Kennedy's Jan.
18 statement which seems to rule out precisely the kind
of "compromise'' offered by Meese.
In that statement President Kennedy repeatedly reaf
firmed his commitment to preserving the
"independence" of the University, and he noted that
"a foundation to be created for a presidential center
. . . would be formed for the purpose of maintaining
such a center on behalf of a public figure with a particu
lar political philosophy."
Kennedy noted further that "such a center ... would
inevitably be viewed as connected with the University
— indeed, it is only to the extent that there is some
connection, however informal, that there is any point
at all in its placement at Stanford."
"There can be no convincing assurances," Kennedy
said, "that a center organized independently of the
University and functioning merely as a lessee would be
governed in accord with normal academic stand
ards"— and it is, we believe, precisely for this reason
that the Meese proposal must be rejected.
In his Jan. 18 statement President Kennedy also ex
plicitly rejects the model proposed by Meese in his Jan.
17 letter to the Board of Trustees. The Center for Ad
vanced Studies in Behavioral Sciences, Kennedy said,
"originated from an established charitable foundation
with a history of support for the improvement of higher
education; neither the foundation nor CASBS was asso
ciated with any doctrine or school of thought within the
behavioral sciences . .
