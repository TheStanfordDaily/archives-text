## Accept the center for public affairs compromise 
### 
President Reagan has accepted
the offer of the University's Board of
Trustees to locate the library and
museum at Stanford. Many concur
that this is an eminently wise deci
sion.
Now, the White House has pro
posed a compromise on the Center
for Public Affairs.
What does this entail?
As I understand the White House
proposal, the center for public af
fairs would be a national center
modeled after the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences and National Bureau of
Economic Research, both at Stan
ford.
What better models could there
possibly be? Both centers enjoy na
tional reputations for excellence.
Both have boards of distinguished
individuals. Both cooperate with the
University in many ways. Both are

administered independently of
Stanford.
The center for public affairs, adja
cent to the presidential library and
museum, would not require addi
tional space beyond the approxi
mately 20 acres already planned for
the library and museum. The close
proximity of the center to the library
would enhance the value of both
facilities.
A location on the campus would
benefit Stanford faculty and stu
dents and Stanford's existing public
policy programs for a number of
reasons. It would present to the
University a major conference cen
ter which we do not now have. It
would offer a program for advanced
research which would bring approx
imately two dozen distinguished
scholars annually, and which would
include research support for a num
ber of Stanford scholars. In addi

tion, all the scholars visiting the cen
ter would have the opportunity to
exchange views and work closely
with Stanford faculty and students in
their respective disciplines.
Like the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences,
the center for public affairs would
have an abiding interest in maintain
ing the highest standards of re
search. The presidential library
foundation, which would fund the
center, would be modeled after the
foundations that are associated with
other presidential libraries. These
foundations have a solid record for
supporting non-partisan research
programs of high scholarly value,
which have included grants to Stan
ford students and faculty.
At this juncture it is of fundamen
tal importance to remember that the
center is envisioned by the Presi
dent of the United States as national

in character. It will undoubtedly
have a national group of distin
guished scholars to perform appro
priate peer review function. It is not
designed to be a new University de
partment, which would properly be
integrated into the normal academic
structure.

It would be shameful if
the center were forced
off campus for political
reasons.

The objective search for knowl
edge is absolutely essential in the
conduct of scholarship. The pur
pose of the center for public affairs,
after all, is not to endorse any politi
cal philosophy. Rather, the aim is to
contribute to excellence in the ad
vanced study of domestic and
foreign affairs on the national level

— and the purpose of excellence in
this advanced study is ultimately to
serve our nation and mankind. In
this regard it should particularly be
kept in mind that the library,
museum, and center for public af
fairs will not be built and become
operational at the earliest until Pres
ident Reagan had left office.
What will be the outcome of this
proposed committee?
Since the center for public affairs
first became the object of discus
sion, the majority of us on the
campus have made every effort to
conduct the exchange of ideas on an
impartial and civilized level. It is
thus with regret that one notes the
efforts of a few to put the discussion
of the matter on a political basis.
Certainly, it is to be expected that
the Board of Trustees of this great
University will reject any attempt to
politicize discussion of the compro

mise now before us. It would be
shameful, indeed, if the center for
public affairs were forced off the
campus for political reasons.
Compromise is the essence of a
free society in which different
people hold different views about
the best ways to reach the same
goal. And in the last analysis, when
all is said and done, reason normally
prevails.
Intelligent and thoughtful people
reconcile differing opinions in com
promise because th. / recognize it is
in everyone's interest to do so. If
the strengths of the center for
public affairs are judged on their
merits, it should join the library and
museum at Stanford. It would thus
make a scholarly contribution of tre
mendous value reaching far beyond
the boundries of our University.

administered independently of
Stanford.
The center for public affairs, adja
cent to the presidential library and
museum, would not require addi
tional space beyond the approxi
mately 20 acres already planned for
the library and museum. The close
proximity of the center to the library
would enhance the value of both
facilities.
A location on the campus would
benefit Stanford faculty and stu
dents and Stanford's existing public
policy programs for a number of
reasons. It would present to the
University a major conference cen
ter which we do not now have. It
would offer a program for advanced
research which would bring approx
imately two dozen distinguished
scholars annually, and which would
include research support for a num
ber of Stanford scholars. In addi

tion, all the scholars visiting the cen
ter would have the opportunity to
exchange views and work closely
with Stanford faculty and students in
their respective disciplines.
Like the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences,
the center for public affairs would
have an abiding interest in maintain
ing the highest standards of re
search. The presidential library
foundation, which would fund the
center, would be modeled after the
foundations that are associated with
other presidential libraries. These
foundations have a solid record for
supporting non-partisan research
programs of high scholarly value,
which have included grants to Stan
ford students and faculty.
At this juncture it is of fundamen
tal importance to remember that the
center is envisioned by the Presi
dent of the United States as national

in character. It will undoubtedly
have a national group of distin
guished scholars to perform appro
priate peer review function. It is not
designed to be a new University de
partment, which would properly be
integrated into the normal academic
structure.

It would be shameful if
the center were forced
off campus for political
reasons.

The objective search for knowl
edge is absolutely essential in the
conduct of scholarship. The pur
pose of the center for public affairs,
after all, is not to endorse any politi
cal philosophy. Rather, the aim is to
contribute to excellence in the ad
vanced study of domestic and
foreign affairs on the national level

— and the purpose of excellence in
this advanced study is ultimately to
serve our nation and mankind. In
this regard it should particularly be
kept in mind that the library,
museum, and center for public af
fairs will not be built and become
operational at the earliest until Pres
ident Reagan had left office.
What will be the outcome of this
proposed committee?
Since the center for public affairs
first became the object of discus
sion, the majority of us on the
campus have made every effort to
conduct the exchange of ideas on an
impartial and civilized level. It is
thus with regret that one notes the
efforts of a few to put the discussion
of the matter on a political basis.
Certainly, it is to be expected that
the Board of Trustees of this great
University will reject any attempt to
politicize discussion of the compro

mise now before us. It would be
shameful, indeed, if the center for
public affairs were forced off the
campus for political reasons.
Compromise is the essence of a
free society in which different
people hold different views about
the best ways to reach the same
goal. And in the last analysis, when
all is said and done, reason normally
prevails.
Intelligent and thoughtful people
reconcile differing opinions in com
promise because th. / recognize it is
in everyone's interest to do so. If
the strengths of the center for
public affairs are judged on their
merits, it should join the library and
museum at Stanford. It would thus
make a scholarly contribution of tre
mendous value reaching far beyond
the boundries of our University.
