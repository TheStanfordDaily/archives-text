The article "All eyes on Jesse
Jackson," (Daily, Jan. 23) failed to
show Jackson and his bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination
as they really are. To begin with,
Jackson did not free Lt. Goodman
from Syria. For some reason, per
haps an attempt to make President
Reagan look ineffectual, the Syrian
government chose to let Goodman
go. It is very doubtful that any pleas
on Jackson's part accomplished
this.
While Jackson may be-the most
dynamic and energetic of the po
tential Democractic nominees, the
issue of race is not what will keep
him from winning the nomination.
Although 33 percent of all
Americans would not vote for a
qualified black candidate, Jackson's
biggest weakness is that he is not
qualified.

Jackson may end up as an Indepen
dent with his own small group of
vivacious supporters. But with this
lack of political experience he will
never come close to winning the
nomination, let alone the office of
president

Does anyone else get the feeling
that even if every graduating stu
dent voted to hold Commencement
in Sunken Diamond (or Frost ...) it
would still be held in the Stadium
anyway? The crucial question of the
whole graduation issue is NOT
which site is "best" in some
way—the real question is whether
or not the class of 1984 will be
allowed to graduate at the location
of its choice (whatever that
choice may be). Just how many
relatives is Don inviting anyway?
