# Card tames 1st-place Huskies
## Stanford gets first Pac-10 win 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Finally, a conference vic
tory.
Stanford did everything it
could last night against a
Washington Husky team sit
ting atop the Pacific-10 Con
ference. And this time, unlike
its first six league games, Stan
ford held together long
enough to win, 78-74.
"How could you ask for a
better effort?" Coach Tom
Davis told reporters in the
pandamonium-filled Cardinal
locker room. "It was pure, un
adulterated effort."
Stanford, which improved
to 12-7 overall 1-6 in the Pac
-10, took the lead late in the
first half and stayed in front,
an amazing feat in itself con
sidering the Cardinal had
leads and lost them in its first
six conference games. The
loss broke Washington's
eight-game win streak and
marred its perfect league
record, dropping it to 13-4
overall and 6-1 in the Pac-10.

But for the 5831 fans raising
the Maples Pavilion roof, the
game was not over until, well,
it was over.
"We've been going through
a stretch there when we find
ways to cause ourselves prob
lems late in the game," Davis
said. "This time we tried to
stay calm."
Senior guard Keith Jones,
who led all scorers with 23
points, certainly remained
calm with 0:29 to play when he
sank both ends of a one-and
one to give Stanford a 74-70
lead.
And just seconds later it was
Jones again, taking a half
court pass from forward Steve
Brown after a Husky miss at
the other end and converting
an uncontested lay-in for a 76-
70 Card advantage with 0:17
remaining. A bucket of ice was
out and the game was in it.
"We needed this win five
games ago," Jones said. "This
will really help the confidence
of our players."

While Davis was busy pass
ing out congratulations to his
players, Washington Coach
Marv Harshman spent his time
after the game ripping the offi
cials. The Husky players were
assessed with 31 total fouls
and four of them touted out,
including two starters: 7-foot
center Chris Welp and 6-8 for
ward Paul Fortier.
"There's not much to say,"
began Harshman, who actual
ly said a lot. "You can't win if
you don't keep your team on
the floor. (It's) disappointing
when you have a halfway
decent team and they can't
play.
"We could have had
five (fouled) out," he contin
ued. "It's a crime. They (the
Huskies) didn't have a chance.
They (Stanford) went over our
backs and were grabbing us at
mid-court."
And the livid Harshman
didn't stop there. "The Stan
ford press isn't worth a
damn," he said. "We've
played against a lot tougher
presses than that. If you grab
them and there is no call, it
makes it (the press) effective."
The press that "isn't worth a
damn" caused nine second
half Washington turnovers
and actually was the differ
ence for Stanford against the
taller Huskies, far and away
the tallest team in the Pac-10.
"It was positive to get big
returns from our pressure
without giving them too many
easy baskets," Davis said.
"Once they get inside, they're
unstoppable."
The final Husky turnover
caused by the Card's pressure
came with 32 seconds to go.
After Washington outscored
Stanford 13-4 in a seven
minute period to slice a 68-57
Cardinal lead — its biggest of
the evening — to 72-70, the
Huskies had the ball under
their own basket and a chance
to tie the game.
But a panicked Detlef
Schrempf threw the inbounds
pass too high to Gary Gardner,
who knocked the ball out of
bounds in his attempt to catch
it. Card forward Earl Koberlein.
then inbounded the ball to
Jones, who was immediately
fouled, setting up his last
minute heroics.

Stanford fell behind the
Huskies, unranked by the As
sociated Press but 19th
according to United Press In
ternational midway through
the first half, but Harshman
was forced to bench three
starters and two often-used
reserves due to foul trouble.
The Card took its first lead
since the early going at 37-36
on a dazzling John Revel Ii
three-point play with 1:24 to
go in the half.
Washington point guard Al
vin Vaughn, who led the
losers with 18 points, tied it at
37-all with 0:37 remaining. But
Jones scored off an offensive
rebound and forward Hans
Wichary hit a clutch 18-foot
jumper from the left side with
four seconds left after the the

Card press stole the ball,
giving Stanford a 41-37 lead at
intermission.
Besides Jones and his game
high 23 points, the only other
Card players in double figures
were Revelli with 18 and Steve
Brown with 10. Revelli led
both teams with 11 rebounds,
while 6-5 Earl Koberlein col
lected nine. Revelli also
seemed to shake off his recent
problems at the free throw
line, making all 10 of his at
tempts from the charity stripe.
Although Stanford shot a
poor .479 from the floor
compared to Washington's
.576 figure, it hit 32-of-39 free
throws (82.1 percent), includ
ing 22 of its last 23. The
