# Foreigners play for Washington
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
In some sports, foreign
players are all too common.
Soccer teams recruit
players from South
America, football teams
have their foreign field goal
kicker and the cricket team
just has to have a few
Britons. But basketball has

always been an American
sport.
The University of Wash
ington, however, is starting
to change all that. Three
players on the Husky's
team hail from foreign
countries and two of them
start.
Washington starting cen
ter, freshman Chris Welp
(pronounced "Velp"), and
starting forward, junior
Detlef Schrempf, are from
West Germany while
reserve center Flos

Sigurdsson comes from
Iceland.
One thing all three
players have in common is
that they are sick of ques
tions about what it is like to
be a foreign basketball
player in the United States.

"I'm kind of tired of that
German stuff," the 6-foot-9
Schrempf said after last
night's game. "I'm here to
play basketball."
Welp echoed the senti
ments of his teammate but
did offer to recount the
story of his recruitment to
Washington.
"I came here to play bas
ketball in high school,"
Welp said. "I just wanted to
play one year, but I liked
this country and decided to
stay here for college. I
signed early with Washing
ton because I didn't want a
lot of people to come
around and bother me."
The 7-foot Welp, who is
from Osnabruck, West
Germany, attended Olym
pic High School in Wash
ington for one year before
college and led his team to

Schrempf, who beat
Welp to the Washington
campus by two years, is
from Levekusen, West Ger
many, and also played high
school basketball in the
state of Washington for
one year. Welp is a two
year letterman who started
all of last year, averaging
10.6 points a game and 6.8
rebounds. He didn't start
playing basketball until he
was 14, but Washington
Coach Marv Harshman said
that he has the potential to
be the best player he has
ever coached.
The third player in the
foreign trio, Flosi
Sigurdsson, is from
Iceland. The 7-foot junior
has only seen limited action
with the Huskies in his past
two years as a reserve.
