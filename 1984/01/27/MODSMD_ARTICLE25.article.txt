# No. 6 Card baseball team opens season
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
In case you were thinking
that last Sunday's Super Bowl
game only signaled the end of
the National Football league
season, think again. In fact,
the unseasonable spring wea
ther that has followed a dreary
"Super Sunday" is really a
beacon for the return of col
legiate baseball to Stanford.
That's right. While most of
the country huddles by the
fireplace trying to fight the
cold of winter, the Stanford
Cardinal, sixth-ranked nation
ally in the pre-season polls,
will begin its 19H4 baseball
season this afternoon when
the Card visits the University
of San Francisco Dons.
After three consecutive ap
pearances in the NCAA
playoffs including a trip to
Omaha, Nebraska and the
College World Series in each
of the last two seasons, Head
Coach Mark Marquess is set
ting his sights on even more
success in his eighth season at
Stanford.
Surprisingly, Marquess and
the Cardinal expect big things
this year even aiter losing
three starters to graduation
from the team that finished
fifth in Omaha last year. Gone

are All-Americans Eric
Hardgrave and Mike Aldrete
and Pacific-10 all-star Vince
Sakowski.
Using some simple arith
metic, that adds up to the loss
of the club's top three hitters,
43 home runs and 184 runs
batted in.
But the Cardinal squad that
swept to a Pac-1 (J title one year
ago also used a pack of under
classmen, all of whom return
in 1984. A deep and talented
pitching staff returns. Throw
in a few blue-chip freshman
recruits and one can see why
lanuary is none to soon for
Stanford to take to the dia
mond again.
Marquess must place much
of the load squarely on the
backs of a veteran pitching
corps. Seniors Brian Myers
(10-5, 3.10), Steve Cottrell (9-2,
3.97) and John Radtke (3-3,
3.90), last season's three top
starters, and junior southpaw
reliever Jeff Ballard (8-2, 2.88)
may make many Cardinal fans
torget the big bats and offen
sive firepower of Stanford
teams of the past.
Freshmen Al Osuna and Rob
Wassenaar, a lefty and a
righty, are two of Stanford's
prize catches in the latest

round of the college recruiting
wars.
Elsewhere, Marquess will tie
doing some juggling to try to
fill the voids left by gradua
tion. The big experiment will
be moving catcher Rick
Lundblade to first base to
replace Aldrete.
With Lundblade at first, de
fensive specialist Senior Lyle
Smith should be handling the
pitchers from behind home
plate.
Third base is still up for
grabs after Sakowski's
departure, but Stanford will
boast a sparkling double play
combination in Pete Stanicek
at second base and John Ver
ducci at short.
Clearly, if Stanford really
wants to see the big city lights
of Omaha once again the out
field will have to supplv the of
fense. One year ago, out
fielder Mark Davis was a Pac
-10 honorable mention choice
as a freshman.
Davis will not be alone in
the outfield though. Mike
De√üenon (.308) and Greg
Lorenzetti (.262, 42 RBIs) will
add some punch to the lineup.
Last, but not least, Cardinal
boosters will welcome the
return of Darryl Stephens.

Stanford junior Rick Lundblade will give up his catching mitt to play first base for the Car
dinal this season. Last year Lundblade batted .292 had eight home runs and 39 KBIs.
