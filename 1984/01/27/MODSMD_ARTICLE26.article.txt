After Washington State lost to Virginia in the
second round of the NCAA post-season basket
ball tournament, Cougar fans certainly weren't
saying, "Wait 'til next year." They could wait.
Washington State, which plays Stanford to
morrow at 12 noon in Maples Pavilion, was
about to lose its top four scorers — forwards
Steve Harriel, Guy Williams and Aaron Haskins
and guard Craig Ehlo — and 62 percent of its of
fense.
The departure of the four (Harriel, Williams
and Ehlo are now in the NBA) via graduation
left the Cougars with a 1983-84 squad of one
senior, two juniors, six sophomores and four
freshmen.
But that wasn't the biggest loss. A few
months later, Head Coach George Raveling ex
perienced a graduation of sorts, too, and took
the head coaching job at lowa in the Big 10, a
conference known for its basketball.
So when Assistant Coach Len Stevens moved
into the head spot in Cougarland, it was no
surprise he wasn't too enthused about his
chances of duplicating last season's 23-7
record, second-place finish in the I'aciflc-IO
Conference and trip to the NCAA tournament.
"We've got three of those guys in the NBA,
Raveling in lowa and I'm in trouble," Stevens
says.
Washington State's basketball press guide,
however, viewed the changeover differently.
"We're still in good hands" is the program's
slogan and so far Stevens has his team playing
fairly well. The Cougars are 8-8 overall, but 2-4

in the Pac-10 after a tough 68-62 loss at UC-
Berkeley last night.
"All that winning last season has helped
them this year," said Stanford Coach Tom
Davis. "They expect to win."
That certainly was the case when Stevens and
company took on Oregon State last Thursday
night in Pullman. The Cougars not only beat
the then-No. 11 ranked Oregon State Beavers,
but beat them convincingly, 74-65.
Stanford and Cal won't be the Cougars' only
tests this week, as it is exam week at Washing
ton State, which is on the semester system.
"That's always the scariest week of the
season," Stevens said, "because you don't
know what to expect. The players are thinking
about exams and papers they have to turn in.
Their mentality towards playing isn't so good."
The Cougars are led by 6-foot-8 sophomore
forward Ricky Brown, who is third in the Pac-10
in scoring with a 16.3 points per game average
during conference games. Brown is first in the
league in field goal percentage, hitting a stun
ning 73.2 percent of his shots.
"You can't find a steadier player in the Pac-10
right now,-- sttvens safd of Brown, who is
probably the most muscular player in the
league as well.
The other starters are 6-4 forward Brian Pol
lard, a sophomore with a 42-inch vertical leap,
6-9 sophomore center Otis Jennings, 6-3 soph
omore guard Keith Morrison and 6-2 junior
guard Chris Winkler.
Washington State has won its last five games
against Stanford and 15 of the last 16, including
54-51 and 48-45 decisions last year.
