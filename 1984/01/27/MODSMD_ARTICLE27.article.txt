When Fordham guard
Jerry Hobbie stripped
North Carolina guard Mi
chael Jordan ot the ball and
drove for a layup early in its
73-56 loss to the Tar Heels
at the Stanford Invitational
Tournament on Dec. 2, nei
ther Hobbie nor the Stan
ford fans realized that they
were on the verge of creat
ing a national phenome
non.
In Fordham's next game
against San Jose State,
Hobbie set the Stanford
fans on fire with his unor
thodox, hard-working style
of play. Some Stanford stu
dents came up with a
Hobbie banner and Hobbie
was called back at halftime
to a chorus of "MVP"
chants.
Two weeks later, Hobbie

became Sports lllustrated's
"Cabbage Patch Kid," as
the magazine devoted a
short article to Hobbie and
his reception at Stanford.
It didn't stop there,
however. The Hobbie
Phenomenon spread out
of the Bay Area like fire.
The New York Post and
Newsday, two of the largest
circulation papers in the
United States, ran features
on Hobbie as did several
smaller papers like the
Berger Record in New ler
sey.
Hobbie himself has been
bombarded by letters. The
New Jersey Record re
ported last month that
Hobbie first thought that
the letters came from a
lunatic fringe until he
realized that he was still
getting them.

John Corcoran, a Brook
lyn lawyer and Fordham
alum who visited Stanford
during the Tournament,
sent the Daily a letter in

which he expressed inter
est in financing an award in
Hobbie's honor.
"I suggest for your con
sideration an annual Stan
ford University "jerry
Hobbie Award" to the
cabbage patch player of the
year (by student selec
tion)," Corcoran wrote.
"From our end we could
finance it by forwarding an
amount which would pur
chase a trophy and a
modest replica for the
awardee from the interest
earned."
The Hobbie Watch column
will appear periodically
throughout the rest of the
basketball season and
future columns will update
Hobbie's current statistics,
and his reaction to the
"Hobbie phenomenon. ''
