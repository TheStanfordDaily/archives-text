# University to offer personal computers at reduced price
## 
### CAMERON KALLER 
If you're thinking of purchasing a
microcomputer anytime in the near
future, you may want to wait for just
a little while.
A nearly complete, large-scale
plan will provide the Stanford com
munity with microprocessors for
substantially lower prices than those
of any of the local computer stores.
This project is part of a nationwide
movement among universities to
negotiate student/faculty discounts
with microcomputer companies.
The Stanford effort — called
Micro Disc (Microcomputer Dis
count Plan) — is being handled
through the joint efforts of two de
partments on campus, Academic
Computing and Information Sys
tems (ACIS) and Information Tech
nology Services (ITS).
According to Ed Shaw, head of
ITS, the two departments are pres
ently negotiating with several
"mainline top companies."
"It would be the same thing,"
Shaw said, as going down to your
local Computerland and the like and
purchasing a micro. Our Micro Disc
plan, however, will allow a student
or faculty member to buy a compa
rable personal computer at a signifi
cantly lower price."
The plan is tentatively scheduled
to begin on April 3, at which time
offices will be set up in the Jordan
Quad, where people will be able to
place orders for and receive their
new micros.
More information — such as
brochures, product lists, informa-

tion on maintenance and financing
— will be available soon.
"Transactions are coming along as
fast as possible," Shaw said, "and
one can start looking for more
literature on this special arrange
ment in four to five weeks."
Micro Disc will provide a wide
range of support services to assist
purchasers in the acquisition and ef
fective utilization of personal com
puters. Staff members from both the
ACIS and ITS departments will be
trained in the specific uses of the
various systems that will be
available.
"We'll be sending our staff to
school," Shaw said, "in order to
assure they can efficiently advise
purchasers as to which system will
best suit their needs. In addition,
maintenance will be part of the
package deal."
Various options will be available to
the purchasers, ensuring maximum
effectiveness and ease and minimal
problems in case servicing of their
personal computer is needed.
Members of the ACIS and ITS staff
are hoping that by providing a
mechanism for placing microcom
puter technology within closer
grasp of Stanford individuals, it will
help both the student and faculty
members to take advantage of the
vastly growing microcomputer tech
nology.
Shaw said this plan is an excellent
way to allow people to fully experi
ence and understand the computer
age and all its potentialities without
spending a lot of money.
