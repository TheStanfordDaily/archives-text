# Cardinal women host USC
## Men swimmers face top teams 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
Stanford's swimmers will head south
for the weekend and although they won't
be in the same place they'll encounter
rough waters in both places. The men's
team will head to Dallas, while the wo
men's team will be in Los Angeles.
The men's swim team will be the favor
ite in today's prestigious swim meet the
Dallas Morning News Swim Classic.
Besides the Olympics, no other swim
meet this year can match the talent of the
swimmers competing in today's events.
In fact half the swimmers, including Stan
ford's Jeff kostoff, Pablo Moralas and
John Moffet, will participate in the 1984
Olympics in Los Angles this summer.
Although the Stanford team is talented,
the swimmers will be severely challenged
by such collegiate powers as number 3
UCLA, number 4 Texas, number 5 Ala
bama, number 6 Arizona State and num
ber 7 SMLJ. Texas's Rich Carey holds the
world record in both 100 anid 200 vard

backstroke. SMLJ also has a world record
in the 400 meter IM by Ricardo' Pudo.
Stanford's Dave Bottom will be compet
ing against Carey. "I've been swimming
well all season, I don't think I'll have any
problem (winning) today,'' Carey said.
Stanford has no world record holders,
yet kostoff holds the American record in
the 500, 1000 and 1650 yard freestyle
events. Moralas is also first in the nation
in the 200 butterfly.
With the strength of this individual tal
ent, and barring injuries, Stanford will
have an excellent chance to win the meet.
Already this season, the Cardinal ha>
beaten Texas and Arizona state.
The main reason for Stanford's success
has been the acquisition of freshman kos
toff. Kostoff has improved dramatically
over the last few months.
In his American record time in the long
distant freestyle events, Kostoff prepared
himself by shaving. When a swimmer
shaves his legs and arms, his time goes

down about 10-12 seconds in a long event
such as KMX) yard freestyle.
Atter Stanford's last meet against
Arizona State, kostoff missed his record
time by only six seconds. If he were to
shave, he would easily cut down his
American mark by six seconds.
The swimmers usually wait until the
NCAA Championships to shave in order
to get their best possible times for this im
portant meet.
The Stanford women's team also went
on the road and will compete against
NCAA powers UCLA and USC today and
tomorrow.
The women are lead by Marybeth
I inzmeier who was |ust recently elected
athlete ot the year by the Bay Area Hall of
Fame.
Setting NCAA records in the 200, 500,
and Ibso yard tree, I inzmeier will un
doubtly chalk up most of the Cardinal
points for the No. I ranked Cardinal this
weekend.
