# Women host Trojans
## 
### JOHN LIS 
How do you beat a team that defeated you
just last week by 2G points, is ranked No. 3 in
the nation, and features probably the finest
woman in the game today? It may seem a
tough proposition, but Stanford head wo
men's basketball coach Dotty McCrea has at
least come up with an idea.
"We want to cut our turnovers by 10, "
McCrea said, "and cut their transition bas
kets by 10. We're going to reach into our
bag of tricks. We're going to throw a new
defense at them and match up with a couple
of their players. We've got nothing to lose. "
A reasonable plan it would seem, but the
question remains whether the Cardinal, a 3-
14 team that is winless in the WCAA, can
indeed come home and shut down USC, last
year's national champions with a 15-3 record
this season.
USC's only losses this season have come
at the hands of No. 1 Louisiana Tech, No. 2
Texas, and No. 8 Old Dominion. The Wo
men of Troy are averaging 89.5 points per
game in the WCAA, where they have won all
four of their contests.
Last Saturday in Los Angeles, the Women
of Troy defeated Stanford, 82-56. The Car
dinal led for the first eight minutes of that
ballgame, but USC outscored Stanford 20-3

for the rest of the first half and proceeded to
put the game away in the second half.
Stanford did succeed in holding USC's
All-America forward Cheryl Miller to 16
points last weekend. The 6-2 sophomore is
averaging 23.2 points per game and 11.4
rebounds per game.
One player does not the USC team make,
however. Senior forward Paula McGee
stepped into the starring role last week and
poured in 24 points to pace the Women of
Troy. It was McGee's high game of the
season. She is averaging 13.6 points per
game this season.
McGee's twin sister, Pam, is USC's second
leading scorer this season. Pam McGee is
averaging 19 points and 10.9 rebounds per
game this year, but Stanford held her to only
13 points and six rebounds last Saturday.
The Cardinal, however, could only place
one scorer into double figures against USC.
Sophomore center Sarah Evans, averaging
14.5 points per game, led Stanford with 10.
Freshman guard Erica Mueser and freshman
forward Karen Goodewaagen each had nine,
while sophomore guard Virginia Sourlis had
eight.
Tomorrow night's visit is the only one of
the season to Maples Pavilion for Miller and
Company. Game time is 7:30 p.m.
