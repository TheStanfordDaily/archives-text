# Matmen barely lose to UNLV
## 
### PETER CASTILLO 
Wednesday's match
against the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas was another
setback for the Stanford wres
tling team in a season plagued
by sickness and injury, losing
23-22. This loss drops the Car
dinal record to 4-12.
"It was tough to lose such a
close match, especially when
we could have won," Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel said.
In the first match, Bert
Fukunaga (118 pounds) led 4-3
going into the final period, but
the Rebel wrestler was able to
take control to win 7-4. At 134
pounds Mark Alex was also
unable to maintain his one
point lead going into the final
period, losing 11-6.
Neil Wartnick (126 pounds)
dominated his match in the
opening seconds and coasted
to a 15-3 victory and Scott Wig
gen (142 pounds) toyed with
oppoent for three periods in a
18-6 rout. Stanford's other 12
points came on forfeits in the
150 and 158 weight classes and
gave the Cardinal a 22-6 lead
with only four matches
remaining.
Jeff Hazard (167 pounds)
lost to a quicker and stronger
UNLV opponent by a pin 2:24
into the first period and Bob
Spurlock (177 pounds) lost 11-
5.
In a pivotal match at 190

pounds, Jeff Wilson, returning
from an illness, had a chance
to tie or win the match in the
final 30 seconds, but was
unable to score in a 6-3 defeat.
Thus going into the final
match, Stanford led 22-18.
To win, Flint Pulskamp, in
his first match of the season,
could not lose by more than
seven points. Pulskamp,
defending Pac-10 heavyweight
champion, wrestled 1983 Ail-
American Kahlan O'Hara.
Giving up more than 50
pounds to O'Hara, Pulskamp
stayed close enough for a tie
until a controversial action by
the referee allowed the Rebel
wrestler to score a 19-6 win for
five points and a Rebel victory.
O'Hara kept pushing
Pulskamp off the mat in a stall
ing tactic, but was not called
for stalling and was able to
score as Pulskamp, already
losing a point for stalling,
brought the action to O'Hara
allowing him to score enough
for a Rebel victory.
Stanford tonight faces Long
Beach State, but due to injur
ies to them Stanford will
wrestle challenge matches
with only two matches against
Long Beach. Then tomorrow
the Cardinal travels to San
Francisco for the "All-Cal" In
vitational, where Stanford has
placed fourth the past two
years.
