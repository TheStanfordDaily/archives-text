# Netmen open season today
## Card Sports Roundup 
### 
Tennis
Although Head Coach
Dick Gould will be looking
at his men's tennis team
from a lofty vantage point
in the new varsity tennis
clubhouse this year, the ex
pectations will be as high as
ever as his team begins its
season today against
Hayward State.
Stanford enters the 1984
collegiate as the pre-season
favorite to repeat its 1983
NCAA championship. The
team has been ranked
number one by the Inter
collegiate Tennis Coaches
Association poll â€” a slim
favorite over USC.
"This year will be more
difficult for us than last
year," says Could. "Last
year no one thought we
could win the whole thing,
we had everything to win
and nothing to lose."
But the psychological
barrier may not be the only
obstacle that Gould's net
men will have to volley
over. After last year's cham

pionship season, the Car
dinal's number one singles
player Scott Davis decided
to forego his senior season
to turn professional.
Davis' loss may have
already shown up in Stan
ford's first two tournament
appearances. The team
finished second at the Col
legiate Classic in Palm
Springs and third at the
Adidas/MGM Grand-Reno
Classic. Both events were
won by USC, with Trinity
finishing second in Reno.
Today's match against
Hayward State is another
version of Stanford's tradi
tional season opener.
Track
In its first indoor meet of
the season tomorrow, the
Stanford track team flies
down to Baton Rouge,
Louisiana to face almost 20
teams from across the na
tion. Last year the women's
squad placed second in the
NCAA indoor champion
ships.

Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson plans to bring 13
athletes, including NCAA
indoor Ail-American shot
putter Carol Cady and Pam
Dukes, also competing in
the shotput. Distance run
ners Charles Alexander,
Mark Oleson and Ed Cal
laway will also make the
trip.
Volleyball
Stanford's nationally
ranked men's voleyball
team travels south this
weekend for the LJC-Santa
Barbara Collegiate Tourna
ment. The multi-team tour
ney will be the first test of
the season for the 2-0 Card,
as national powerhouses
UCLA, USC and host UCSB
highlight the field.
Stanford will face
Arizona, UC-San Diego, the
University of Manitoba and
St. Mary's in its pool, with
the championship match
scheduled for tomorrow
night.
