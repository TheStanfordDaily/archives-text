On the day the Kissinger
Commission Report on Central
America became public, 27-year-old
jeffry Schwab, a U.S. army helicop
ter pilot, became the first official
U.S. casualty in the worsening con
flict along the border of Honduras
and Nicaragua. The irony of this
coincidence brings home the possi
bility that the United States could
shift from an ostensibly "covert"
role in the conflict to a direct and
open military intervention into
Nicaragua.
Readers of 'The Nicaragua
Reader," edited by Peter Rosset and
John Vandermeer, will know that
the United States has a long and
questionable history of such inter
vention, and the present administra
tion seems prepared, if not eager, to
play again the old and deadly game
of provocation and polarization.
Polarization is the key word in
U.S.-Central American relations,
and any representative collection oi
essays concerning the U.S. role in
Nicaragua might be expected to
reflect the imbalance between the
ardent supporters of the Sandinistas
and the zealous ideologues who fa
vor the Reagan administration in its
condemnation of Nicaragua's new
revolutionary government. While
Rosset and Vandermeer confess up
front their partiality toward
Nicaragua as a sovereign state under

seige from U.S.-backed forces (as
the title suggests), they have col
lected articles from both sides, thus
offering the reader an array of con
tradictory and widely divergent
claims.
Gleaned trom U.N. speeches, of
ficial documents from Washington
and Managua, the mainstream and
radical press, and conservative and
liberal scholarly studies, the articles
collected here open with a rather
vitriolic debate between Daniel Or
tega Saavedra, coordinator of
Nicaragua's lunta of National
Reconstruction, and Jeanne
Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the
U.N. The debate sets the
framework, but fortunately not the
tone, for the major divisions of the
book: a review of the history of U.S.
policy in Nicaragua, an analysis of
the Nicaraguan Revolution and the
so-called 'Secret War" the U.S.
presently wages against Nicaragua,
and a description of the present so
cial, political and economic condi
tions in Nicaragua. While not taking
the mechanical form of a debate,
the book does include back-to-back
such vindictive opponents as
Saavedra and Kirkpatrick on the U.S.
role in Nicaragua, and the Heritage
Foundation's Di Giovanni and
experts George Black and ludy
Butler on the Marxist versus the CIA
threat to peace.
Any partiality the collection may
reflect comes less from the selection
of essays and more from the inevi
table division most articles on
Nicaragua and U.S. policy in Central
America take as a whole: Those most
thoroughly researched, detailed and

open-minded (Rosset and Vander
meer caution that sheer objectivity
in this matter is impossible) tend to
favor the point of view that the
people of the sovereign state of
Nicaragua have suffered enough
already from U.S. hostilities in the
region.
As the United States moves dan
gerously close to direct military inter
vention in Nicaragua, those of us in
the United States owe it to the
people of Nicaragua and to ourselves
to become well informed enough
about Nicaragua and U.S. involve
ment in Nicaragua's affair to take an
intelligent stand on U.S. policy.
Rosset and Vandermeer have put
together an important collection of
essays that, true to the spirit of their
project, give us a "multi-faceted
book presenting different points of
view." Through this book, a reader
grasps the complexity of the social,
economic and historical forces that
shaped the Nicaraguan Revolution
and the current U.S. policy toward
the Sandinista government.
For anyone who has not yet en
tered the debate over the U.S. role
in Nicaragua and Central America,
this collection provides a compre
hensive introduction; for those who
have, these essays serve as a timely
review, as Congress prepares to
debate the bipartisan commission's
recommendation to increase mili
tary and economic aid to Central
America — ostensibly to restore and
support "democratic institutions in
Central America," but more
ominously, "so that arms would
support diplomacy rather than sup
plant it."

Polarization is the key word in
U.S.-Central American relations,
and any representative collection oi
essays concerning the U.S. role in
Nicaragua might be expected to
reflect the imbalance between the
ardent supporters of the Sandinistas
and the zealous ideologues who fa
vor the Reagan administration in its
condemnation of Nicaragua's new
revolutionary government. While
Rosset and Vandermeer confess up
front their partiality toward
Nicaragua as a sovereign state under

seige from U.S.-backed forces (as
the title suggests), they have col
lected articles from both sides, thus
offering the reader an array of con
tradictory and widely divergent
claims.
Gleaned trom U.N. speeches, of
ficial documents from Washington
and Managua, the mainstream and
radical press, and conservative and
liberal scholarly studies, the articles
collected here open with a rather
vitriolic debate between Daniel Or
tega Saavedra, coordinator of
Nicaragua's lunta of National
Reconstruction, and Jeanne
Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the
U.N. The debate sets the
framework, but fortunately not the
tone, for the major divisions of the
book: a review of the history of U.S.
policy in Nicaragua, an analysis of
the Nicaraguan Revolution and the
so-called 'Secret War" the U.S.
presently wages against Nicaragua,
and a description of the present so
cial, political and economic condi
tions in Nicaragua. While not taking
the mechanical form of a debate,
the book does include back-to-back
such vindictive opponents as
Saavedra and Kirkpatrick on the U.S.
role in Nicaragua, and the Heritage
Foundation's Di Giovanni and
experts George Black and ludy
Butler on the Marxist versus the CIA
threat to peace.
Any partiality the collection may
reflect comes less from the selection
of essays and more from the inevi
table division most articles on
Nicaragua and U.S. policy in Central
America take as a whole: Those most
thoroughly researched, detailed and

open-minded (Rosset and Vander
meer caution that sheer objectivity
in this matter is impossible) tend to
favor the point of view that the
people of the sovereign state of
Nicaragua have suffered enough
already from U.S. hostilities in the
region.
As the United States moves dan
gerously close to direct military inter
vention in Nicaragua, those of us in
the United States owe it to the
people of Nicaragua and to ourselves
to become well informed enough
about Nicaragua and U.S. involve
ment in Nicaragua's affair to take an
intelligent stand on U.S. policy.
Rosset and Vandermeer have put
together an important collection of
essays that, true to the spirit of their
project, give us a "multi-faceted
book presenting different points of
view." Through this book, a reader
grasps the complexity of the social,
economic and historical forces that
shaped the Nicaraguan Revolution
and the current U.S. policy toward
the Sandinista government.
For anyone who has not yet en
tered the debate over the U.S. role
in Nicaragua and Central America,
this collection provides a compre
hensive introduction; for those who
have, these essays serve as a timely
review, as Congress prepares to
debate the bipartisan commission's
recommendation to increase mili
tary and economic aid to Central
America — ostensibly to restore and
support "democratic institutions in
Central America," but more
ominously, "so that arms would
support diplomacy rather than sup
plant it."
