# Wallace Stevens' biography reveals him, but not his poetry

"Parts of a World: Wallace
Stevens Remembered/' by
Peter Brazeau, Random
House, 330 pp., $19.95
My boss at the Prudential In
surance Co., Harvey Wall
banger, handed out the
monthly corporate newsletter.
In it was a quiz section: "What
great American poet of the
first half of this century, win
ner of the prestigious Bollin
gen Prize, two National Book
Awards, and a Pulitzer Prize,
was also a vice president of

the Hartford Insurance Co.?"
No one in the office knew.
Wallace Stevens' part in the
insurance world is matter for
trivia. Unfortunately, the first
third of Peter Brazeau's "oral
biography" concerns itself
with Stevens, the man about
the office: the neatness of his
desk, his sarcastic repartee
with employees, his afternoon
break for tea. The chronicle of
Stevens' office habits is finally
no more interesting, or impor
tant, than that of any colorful
executive — Harvey Wall
banger's for instance.
Trivia in such quantity is the

result of Mr. Brazeau's tech
nique, the "oral biography": A
substantial portion of the
book is verbatim transcript of
taped interviews which
Brazeau conducted with those
who knew Stevens. We are
presented with many off-the
cuff recollections: "We got to
the attorney's office ... He
opened up his bag, put it in
the middle of the table, and
said, 'Let's have a cinnamon
bun.' "
For his part, Brazeau is
rather the editor than the au
thor of this biography. He
limits himself to providing fac

tual background in headnotes
and footnotes. He does not
analyze or draw conclusions
from his data.
The chief virtue of Brazeau's
technique is his juxtaposition
of contradictory accounts of
Stevens. One associate claims,
"We revered him"; he then
breaks down with "affection
for him." In the very next in
terview, another associate
declares, "Here's the great
poet — who was just a bas
tard, a seriously flawed man."
Brazeau allows those who
knew Stevens to speak for
themselves and he forces the

reader to draw his own con
clusions.
The difficulty with the tech
nique is that it fosters repeti
tion. One interviewee will
recount Stevens' taste for
several martinis at lunch, un
aware that we have been in
formed about this on five or
six previous occasions. That
Stevens invited no one into his
home, that he had a sardonic
sense of humor, that he
preferred talk of fruits or gar
dens to talk of poetry — these
are all 45 rpm tunes on a
turntable with an automatic
repeat.
But Brazeau, as he edits
afong, does have a few imp
lied fish to fry. Part of the
Stevens myth was that those
who knew Mr. Stevens the in
surance executive were un
aware of his "secret life" as
one of America's great poets.
But interviews with everyone
from the executives to the
charwomen at Hartford during
Stevens' tenure dispel this
myth. While Stevens did feel
that widespread knowledge of
his poetic aspirations would
damage his reputation as a
cold and reasoned busines
sman, we are surprised to
learn that his immediate
employees knew about his
poetry. Some, out of curiosity,
read his books. We are not
surprised to learn that few of
his business associates under
stood his difficult works.
Stevens repeatedly refused

to discuss, or explain, his
poetry with anyone at the
Hartford. Unfortunately, this
reticence marks all other
spheres of his life; he was a
very private man. As a result,
there is little in Brazeau's
biography which serves to in
form or elucidate Stevens'
poems.

"VVe got to the
attorney's office . . .
He opened up his
bag, put it in the
middle of the table,
and said, 'Let's have
a cinnamon bun/ "
- From "Parts of a
World"

The second part of the biog
raphy addresses Stevens as "A
Private Poet in Public." In one
incident, a literary friend
recalls, Stevens presented his
briefcase and said, "Now you
see everything is neatly sorted
out here. Over in this com
partment is my insurance busi
ness with the farmers, and
over in this compartment, this
is my lecture and some poems
that I want to read. I keep
them completely separate."

There was no cross
fertilization between Stevens'
job, his public life and the
private world of his poetry.
Brazeau's "oral biography,"
which can only present his
public life, necessarily tells us
nothing about his poetry. The
fault rests partly with Stevens
himself. The poet Richard Wil
bur relates that Stevens
"would rather talk about
something else" when asked
about his verse. There is no
public record of Stevens on
the subject of his poetry;
Brazeau's book lacks the one
thing most interesting, and
most important, to Stevens'
readers.
The third part of this oral
biography offers Stevens the
man about the house. But any
record culled from interviews
with neighbors and
housemaids sounds distress
ingly like the worst kind of
gossip. While Stevens' rela
tionship with his disturbed
wife and his rebellious
daughter is enticing to a "life
and times of" reader, this is
perhaps the least important in
formation for anyone inter
ested in the man's poetry.
Brazeau's book is of no real
use to the scholar of Stevens'
poetry; it is too repetitious for
anyone looking for a good
"life" to read. But it is candid
and honest. It provides us
with the most direct acquaint
ance we can have with the
man at this late date.
