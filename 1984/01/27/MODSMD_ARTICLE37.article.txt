# Towers' 'Summoning' rivals O'Connor

### JOE LEW 
"The Summoning/' by Robert Towers,
Harper & Row, 336 pp., $15.95.
Flannery O'Connor is dead and writing
in New York City.
Or so I thought, at times, while reading
Robert Towers' third novel, "The Sum
moning." And to someone who can
practically recite "A Good Man is Hard to
Find" and "Revelation," that was a won
derful feeling. The comparison with
O'Connor imposes itself, as Towers
adopts the conversion theme that
O'Connor made her own. And he
produces an almost successful challenge
to her acknowledged possession of the
subject.
"The Summoning" keenly portrays the
crisis in the life of Lawrence Hux, a
Princeton Ph.D. candidate who
abandoned his thesis and finally ended
up as associate director of educational
projects of the Foundation. (Not the one
described by Asimov in his now
continuing saga, but one with an equally
appropriate, punning name: the Morrow
Foundation.) At the opening of the novel,
Hux is preoccupied by the impotence that
had helped lead to his divorce, which in
its turn contributed to his estrangement
from his young son. This problem is com
pounded when Hux is visited by the
ghostly apparition of his friend Clark, a
white civil rights activist who had been

murdered in Mississippi 10 years before,
in 1964, at the height of the Movement.
With Foundation work as a pretext, Hux
sets out for Mississippi in pursuit of Dr.
Claiborne Heme, the man who stood trial
for Clark's assassination, but who was ac
quitted by an all-white jury. Hux's inten
tions are uncertain, even to himself. Does
he plan merely to confront the man? To
uncover new evidence and force a re
trial? To avenge Clark's death himself? He
hardly knows. Once in Mississippi, Hux
impersonates a Baptist minister in order
to ingratiate himself with the alleged as
sassin's old maid-like sister, Isabelle
Heme. But suddenly, he finds that he is
no longer playing a role. He says one
word, "Jesus," and experiences a strange
influx of power.
Towers is not the master stylist
O'Connor was. Nowhere in "The Sum
moning" does one find a sentence like
that which opens "Good Country
People": "Besides the neutral expression
that she wore when she was alone, Mrs.
Freeman had two others, forward and
reverse, that she used for all her human
dealings." Towers' novel begins with, "A
man named Lawrence Hux sat reading
within a cone of yellow light that fell from
the only decent lamp in the room."
Even before Clark's ghost appears,
however, the relative flatness of the style
no longer matters. Not that brilliant
metaphors and compelling descriptions
don't force themselves into the web of

the text occasionally. Bui the novel's gen
eral "prosiness" and the convincing psy
chological and even moral tawdriness of
Mux provide a wonderful background
against which the workings of — Jesus?
grace? a power-hungry preacher named
Archie B. Thurlow? insanity? — stand out
in breath-taking relief.
As Hux, in his disguise as the Reverend
Ainsley Black, a disciple of Thurlow,
worms his way into Isabelle Heme's con
fidence, the yellow cone of light men
tioned in the novel's first sentence seems
to widen and to intensify. In the fourth
section of the novel, Hux/Black is meta
phorically unhorsed; in the next (and last)
section, he is temporarily blinded. Even
his sanity is imperiled. Towers unmis
takably wishes us to retail another per
secutor with a double identity: Saul/Paul
on the road to Damascus.
Towers comes precious close to
making the theme of conversion (which
had for so long seemed the exclusive
domain of Flannery O'Connor) his own.
But in the fourth part of the novel, the
)esus-talk begins to sound a little
strained. And the final stage of Hux's
"conversion" is related second-hand
and, as a result, far less convincingly.
Throughout "The Summoning," Tow
ers brilliantly uses chapter breaks to jump
across the chasms that separate the con
sciousnesses of his characters. In this
way, even relatively "minor" figures, like

the Reverend Archie B. Thurlow and the
sinister Rooney, leap into rounded lives.
More than two-thirds of Hux's final
"Stage" are conveyed through the eyes
of Hux's new girlfriend Anne Schlamm
(he has regained potency) who happens
to be Clark's former mistress. The im

mediacy — the urgency — which had
characterized by far the greater part of
Towers' vision, evaporates. The vision
narrows, loses radiance, fades back — as
it were — into the "real" world. Sudden
ly, the reader feels as if he himself is left
within that cone of yellow light.
