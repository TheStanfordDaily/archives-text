# Nina Hagen does it her way with piercing tones
## 
### KARL JOHNSEN 
in America, Nina Hagen is
an unknown artist to all but
the hardcore avant-garde fan.
But in her native Germany,
slic is well known on both the
popular and punk scenes.
Showing promising vocal
prowess as a child, she was
given operatic training. As
probably the only opera-punk
ssover singer, she makes
full use of this unique musical
perspective in her perfor
mances.
Her razor sharp songs are
guaranteed to get your
ac enaline flowing, as well as
arouse the wrath of your
roommates, resident fellow or
landlord. So if you want to get
crazv or are looking for some
trouble, try her records — if
you can find them.
lor true entertainment,
h nvever, don't hesitate to at
tend one of her concerts.
"I here she shows her talents to
In st advantage. Production
t chniques fail to accurately
reproduce her voice, and as a
result, on vinyl it sounds more
crass than musical, and a pair
i • tloor-standing speakers
hardK deliver the full effect of
her piercing, pure tones.
This is the main reason she

has not sold more records in
the United States. When she
presents her style live, like her
recent show at the kabuki
nightclub, it is to sold-out
crowds.
Hagen was a swell of some
magnitude in both German
and avant-garde music long
before the current rush of the
"Neue Deutsche Wette" (the
New German Wave). She is
candid in her criticism of this
pop-oriented media blitz, es
pecially in her song 'Was soil
es bedeuten?" ("What is it
supposed to mean?"). She
calls their music
"substanceless fluff without
taste," and prophesies that
"the New German Wave is the
New German Hell."
Her two-hour show dis
played her alternative to new
trash," and included original
material as well as songs from
the repertoires of David
Bowie, Bob Marley, Michael
Jackson and even Frank
Sinatra. The biggest shock of
this unusual mix was how well
Hagen was able to blend the
various styles with her own,
and then successfully bridge
one song to the next.
Her lead-off song, "White
Punks on Dope,' would have

been an inspiration to any
Stanford Band member. The
jerky, stop-and-start begin
ning brought the crowd to its
feet immediately. But a wave
of surprise rolled through the
audience when she belted out
the lyrics in German. A loose
translation of the German
slang in the retrain would be
"This grosses me out!
Then she launched into her
latest release, "New York
City,' quickly followed by Mi
chael Jackson's "Beat It." She
didn t sing the English words
to this one either, but instead
sang it in French.
A few more followed in
rapid-fire succession before
she dived into "1968 (1983) Is
Cher," which contained some
cleverly transposed guitar riffs
from the Beatles'
Revolution." She raced on
through countless others, in
cluding stunning perfor
mances ot "Battle Hymn of the
Republic (yes, I really do
mean "Glory, glory, hal
lelujah"), Africa Unite" (she
yodeled during this one) as
well as two of her best known
songs, "Cosma Shira" and
Born in Xixax."
The standout of this set
seemed written just for her:

Billy Idol's "White Wedding."
The heavy power c hords were
neatly severed by her frantic,
louder-than-lite highs and
gravelly female bass, which
sounds more like growling
than singing. This song had
never really impressed me,
but Hagen made it click.
With "Wenn Ich ein lunge
Waer" ("If I Were A Boy"), a
song about all the things she
could do if she were a male,
Hagen took her first real break
in an hour and a half. Despite
the wild cheering, clapping

and shrieking that clamored
for an encore, it was a long
time before she and her band
took the stage again.
The second halt began with
introduction of the band,
which consisted of a Ras
tafarian bassist, a lead guitarist
who looked like a clean
shaven member of ZZ Top and
a neatly-dressed drummer
who looked so normal as to be
out of place.
Hagen, with her flair for the
theatrical, was dressed in a
rainbow-colored vest and

black leather pants. Her hair
was bleached blond, dyed red
at the sides of the temples,
with a blue ponytail.
She went into an unusual
German rap number, reminis
cent of the closing acts in
small German nightclubs. But
she knew that no one would
settle for this as the last song,
so she moved directly into
Bowie's "Golden Years."
The band left the stage for a
second time — this break even
longer than the first, but for
good reason. When Hagen

returned, she was trans
formed into Snow White —
having donned a fluffy black
wig, with an oversized red and
white polka-dot bow in it ( and
a white dress.
She thanked the audience
and began the most
memorable song of the eve
ning — Frank Sinatra's "My
Way." She really had done it
her way. As she left, she men
tioned that she'll be back in
April.
I'm sure she'll have her way
again.

who looked so normal as to be
out of place.
Hagen, with her flair for the
theatrical, was dressed in a
rainbow-colored vest and

black leather pants. Her hair
was bleached blond, dyed red
at the sides of the temples,
with a blue ponytail.
She went into an unusual
German rap number, reminis
cent of the closing acts in
small German nightclubs. But
she knew that no one would
settle for this as the last song,
so she moved directly into
Bowie's "Golden Years."
The band left the stage for a
second time — this break even
longer than the first, but for
good reason. When Hagen

returned, she was trans
formed into Snow White —
having donned a fluffy black
wig, with an oversized red and
white polka-dot bow in it ( and
a white dress.
She thanked the audience
and began the most
memorable song of the eve
ning — Frank Sinatra's "My
Way." She really had done it
her way. As she left, she men
tioned that she'll be back in
April.
I'm sure she'll have her way
again.
in America, Nina Hagen is
an unknown artist to all but
the hardcore avant-garde fan.
But in her native Germany,
slic is well known on both the
popular and punk scenes.
Showing promising vocal
prowess as a child, she was
given operatic training. As
probably the only opera-punk
ssover singer, she makes
full use of this unique musical
perspective in her perfor
mances.
Her razor sharp songs are
guaranteed to get your
ac enaline flowing, as well as
arouse the wrath of your
roommates, resident fellow or
landlord. So if you want to get
crazv or are looking for some
trouble, try her records — if
you can find them.

This is the main reason she

has not sold more records in
the United States. When she
presents her style live, like her
recent show at the kabuki
nightclub, it is to sold-out
crowds.
Hagen was a swell of some
magnitude in both German
and avant-garde music long
before the current rush of the
"Neue Deutsche Wette" (the
New German Wave). She is
candid in her criticism of this
pop-oriented media blitz, es
pecially in her song 'Was soil
es bedeuten?" ("What is it
supposed to mean?"). She
calls their music
"substanceless fluff without
taste," and prophesies that
"the New German Wave is the
New German Hell."
Her two-hour show dis
played her alternative to new
trash," and included original
material as well as songs from
the repertoires of David
Bowie, Bob Marley, Michael
Jackson and even Frank
Sinatra. The biggest shock of
this unusual mix was how well
Hagen was able to blend the
various styles with her own,
and then successfully bridge
one song to the next.
Her lead-off song, "White
Punks on Dope,' would have

been an inspiration to any
Stanford Band member. The
jerky, stop-and-start begin
ning brought the crowd to its
feet immediately. But a wave
of surprise rolled through the
audience when she belted out
the lyrics in German. A loose
translation of the German
slang in the retrain would be
"This grosses me out!
Then she launched into her
latest release, "New York
City,' quickly followed by Mi
chael Jackson's "Beat It." She
didn t sing the English words
to this one either, but instead
sang it in French.
A few more followed in
rapid-fire succession before
she dived into "1968 (1983) Is
Cher," which contained some
cleverly transposed guitar riffs
from the Beatles'
Revolution." She raced on
through countless others, in
cluding stunning perfor
mances ot "Battle Hymn of the
Republic (yes, I really do
mean "Glory, glory, hal
lelujah"), Africa Unite" (she
yodeled during this one) as
well as two of her best known
songs, "Cosma Shira" and
Born in Xixax."
The standout of this set
seemed written just for her:

Billy Idol's "White Wedding."
The heavy power c hords were
neatly severed by her frantic,
louder-than-lite highs and
gravelly female bass, which
sounds more like growling
than singing. This song had
never really impressed me,
but Hagen made it click.
With "Wenn Ich ein lunge
Waer" ("If I Were A Boy"), a
song about all the things she
could do if she were a male,
Hagen took her first real break
in an hour and a half. Despite
the wild cheering, clapping

and shrieking that clamored
for an encore, it was a long
time before she and her band
took the stage again.
The second halt began with
introduction of the band,
which consisted of a Ras
tafarian bassist, a lead guitarist
who looked like a clean
shaven member of ZZ Top and
a neatly-dressed drummer
