# 'Vertigo' keeps up suspense
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, original
ly released in 1958 and reissued at
Christmas after a decade out of circula
tion, has an eerie, seductive roman
ticism.
A college pal hires "Scottie" Fer
guson (James Stewart), a former police
detective, to trail his wife Madeleine
(Kim Novak), who seems to he pos
sessed by the spirit of her great
grandmother and spends her daytime
hours reliving snatches of that wo
man's tragic life. Alec Coppel and
Samuel Taylor adapted the screenplay
from a novel called "D'entre les Morts"
by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Nar
cejac; the American title alludes to
Scottie's particular ailment — vertigo
occasioned by acrophobia, which in
directly caused the death of another
cop (who fell to his death trying to
help Scottie up a roof during a chase)
and has forced him into early retire
ment — as well as to the dazzling
blond Madeleine's effect on him.
He falls so completely and insanely
in love with her that when he loses
her, he takes to searching for her in
the streets (of San Francisco, where
most of the picture was shot) and fol
lowing women who resemble het.
One day he picks up Judy Barton (also
played by Novak), who might be
Madeleine's brunette twin, and at
tempts to transform her into
Madeleine.
The combination of this richly sug
gestive narrative, Kim Novak's other
worldly beauty in the first halt of the
film, the heady Bernard Herrmann
music, and the hypnotic camerawork
in the most famous sequences is ex
tremely powerful, on a pop level. You
watch the movie with the same fascina
tion and impatience with which vou

might read a sexy murder mystery that
keeps you awake half the night until
you've devoured the last details of the
solution. Our desire for erotic and
emotional satisfaction at the pulp
romantic level retains the images of
Kim Novak's exquisitely distracted face
and lames Stewart's love-ravaged one
in our heads long after we've forgotten
the nondescript dialogue, the holes in
the story and the erratic acting.
The problem is that many critics
seem to take Vertigo absurdly seriously
— as if it were a Manet painting, a
Ravel concerto and a Borges story all
rolled into one. In no other case —
perhaps not even Psycho — has
Hitchcock's teasing, intoxicatingly en
tertaining craftsmanship been
confused so insistently with art. There
is a kind of bald surrealism in the
movie, in the credits sequence
(designed by Saul Bass) and the dream
sequence (John Ferren), but though
other movies of the 1950s parade this

brand of pseudo-Freudian kitsch, too
— like Something Wild, with Carroll
Baker — only in Vertigo is it assumed
to have any value
Moreover, the movie's devotees,
some of whom voted it one of the ten
best films of all time in the 1982 Sight
and Sound survey, see in its flirtation
with perversion (necrophilia, death
wish) a trenchancy the picture simply
doesn't possess. For Vertigo doesn't
say anything about these explosive
topics, any more than Rear Window
really addresses the subject of Peeping
Tomism, or Strangers on a Train the re
lationship ofthe ego and the id, or —
and here I know I'm treading on dan
gerous ground — Psycho the Oedipal
complex. Certainly these movies
would be far less compelling without
this gaudy psychiatric color, but they
have the same relationship to Freud
that Forbidden Planet or West Side
Story has to Shakespeare. Vertigo isn't
Freudian at all, really — it's Freudly.
