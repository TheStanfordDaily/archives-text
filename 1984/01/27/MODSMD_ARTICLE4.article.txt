### SHELLY WENTKER Staff writer 
It is the University's "duty" to warn the public
about next month's scheduled showing ol
Pasolini's Sa/o, an X-rated film banned in Italy
and France, according to an administration
spokesman.
Larry Davidson, associate director of Events
and Services, said his office has recommended
that signs be posted in the lobby on the day of
the Sa/o screening to prepare the public for the
film's screening.
Eric Diesel, a graduate student in statistics and
coordinator of the Great Director's Film Series
— the group sponsoring Sa/o — said tie shares
the University's concern, but he stressed that
the film is "very intellectual."
"It's not a movie about sex and violence,"

Diesel said. "People who are looking for an ac
tion story are going to be disappointed."
A poster advertising Sa/o said the film
portrays "a group of fascist intellectuals who
kidnap young children and subject them to in
tense psychological and physical brutality" and
explains that the movie received its rating due
to "its brutality and bizarre sex."
1 he advertisement further states, "This film
contains graphic scenes which many might find
offensive, so please be warned."
Davidson said the University does not object
to the showing of an X-rated film, noting that
such screenings have been conducted in the
past. Fie said the University wants to take steps
to acquaint would-be viewers with Jhe film's
subject matter.
Diesel concurred. "People will be very upset

if they don't have a strong warning, " he said.
"Definitely don't bring children."
Typically half the audience will leave before
the film's conclusion, even if warnings have
been issued, Diesel said. Without such warn
ings, even more will leave.
Diesel said he feels justified in showing the
film, but he does not recommend the film to
anyone in particular — except filmmakers.
"Artistically, the movie is clearly a great movie
— the sets, soundtrack, editing and structure,"
he said. "Pasolini is universally acknowledged
as a great director and this film is widely
heralded."
Diesel also said he has received "no pressure
whatsoever" from the University and described
the administration's attitude as reflecting an
"open university."
