Citizen Kane (1941)
Location to be announced
Orson Welles was only in his
mid-20s when he came to
Hollywood to make this film,
but he had already established
himself as an enfant terrible on
Broadway and on radio. The
bristling, vibrant feeling of the
picture is due in part to the
youthfulness of most of the
people who collaborated on it
(only the screenwriter, Her
man Mankiewicz, had been
working in movies for long)
and in part to the subject: pub
lisher William Randolph
Hearst, who was still very
much alive. An extraordinary
movie. With a Mercury Theater
cast: Welles as Kane, )oseph
Cotten, Dorothy Comingore,
Ruth Warrick, Agnes
Moorehead, Everett Sloane.
Photographed by Gregg
Toland.
Plays Wednesday evening.
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari
(1919)
Haus Mitteleuropa
Robert Wiene's celebrated
film is a fascinating artifact of
the German Expressionist
epoch, but though it's un
deniably a work of art, dramati
cally it's not a very satisfying
one. Static and self
consciously experimental, it
didn't point movies in a direc
tion other filmmakers cared to
follow. The visual strategy of
the film is that the stylized sets
project the workings of a mad
man's mind. At the center of

this Freudian fantasy are
Werner Kraus as Caligari and
Conrad Veidt as Cesare the
somnambulist.
Plays Thursday evening.
Catch-22 (1970)
Cubberley Auditorium
Mike Nichols, the director,
and Buck Henry, who wrote
the script, clearly understood
that they were adapting one of
the key American novels ot the
mid-20th century — the movie
is very heavy and "important."
What they seemed to forget
was how funny )oseph Heller's
book was. As Yossarian
(Everyman as a World War II
bomber pilot), Alan Arkin tries
hard but perhaps he aims for
the wrong qualities (hysteria
and Mad Magazine frontal
lunacy rather than ironic grace
and perpetual astonishment).
In a much smaller role —
Chaplain Tappman — Anthony
Perkins is far more successful.
The all-star cast includes Or
son Welles, Boh Newhart,
Paula Prentiss, Richard Ben
jamin, Art Carfunkel, Martin
Sheen, Jack Gilford, Dalio,
Charles Grodin, Bob Balaban,
Peter Bonerz, Martin Balsam,
Buck Henry and, in an utterly
wrongheaded performance,
jon Voight as Milo
Minderbinder.
Plays tonight.
Blue Thunder
Memorial Auditorium
The title refers to a super

equipped helicopter being
tested by LAPD aerial cops
Murphy (Roy Scheider) and
Lymangood (Daniel Stern), and
from the moment it is intro
duced against a red sun, like a
huge, other-worldly, metallic
tarantula, and the music soars,
we understand where the
emotional focus of the movie
is. That helicopter upstages all
of the actors except the late
Warren Oates, who plays
Murphy and Lymangood's
chief as the closest human
equivalent of a bulldog, lohn
Badham's film isn't terrible,
but it's terribly mediocre. The
action sequences are as
sembled in an efficient,
workmanlike manner, like vis
ual instruction manuals, but
the plotting (Dan O'Bannon
and Don jakoby wrote the
script) is crimped and confus
ing. With Malcolm McDowell,
giving a certified bad perfor
mance as a huffy British villain
associated with a fascist or
ganization working through
the LAPD.
Plays Sunday evening.
The Return of the Pink Pan
ther (1975)
Memorial Auditorium
So much of this movie
rehashes the earlier Inspector
Clouseau pictures that Blake
Edwards might have brought it
out as an afterthought. Very
little in it is actually funny ex
cept for the way Peter Sellers
looks from scene to scene, and
two-thirds of the way through

the film Edwards runs out of
even second-hand gags and
starts repeating bits we've just
seen. He and frank Waldman
wrote the script, and the bland
supporting cast is headed by a
tired-looking Christopher

Plummer, Catherine
Schell and Herbert
Lorn. 'I
Plays tomorrow
night.

Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington (1939)

Bijou, Palo Alto
Frank Capra's
whimsy contained an insistent
populist message that could be
discomfiting — even creepy —
but in this preposterous politi
cal fantasy about the forces of
good defeating the forces of
evil in the Senate, it isn't both
ersome enough to spoil the
entertainment, limmy Stewart
gives a hugely appealing per%
t'ormance as the small-town
hero, Jean Arthur plays the
cynic he softens, and the large,
impressive cast features
Claude Rains, Thomas
Mitchell, Edward Arnold, Guy
Kibbee, Eugene Pallette,
Beulah Bondi, Harry Carey,
H.B. Warner and Porter Hall.

Sidney Buchman wrote the
screenplay.
Plays Sunday with It's a Won
derful Life and You Can't Take
It with You.

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
(1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Penelope Cilliatt wrote the
screenplay for this memorable
drama about people who try to
accept who they are and try to
work whatever they can get
out of life into some kind of
happiness. It's one of the rare
pieces of film writing in which
every line seems full and
charged; Gilliatf achieves a
screenwriter's equivalent to
poetry. (In the best scene, the
heroine's mother, advising her
on her love life, says, "Darling,
you keep throwing in your
hand because you haven't got
the whole thing. There is no
whole thing. . . . You think it's
nothing, but it's not nothing.")
|ohn Schlesinger directs, in his
usual underscoring manner,
but his talent for responding to
actors shines in the perfor
mances of Peter Finch as a
homosexual doctor, Glenda
Jackson as a divorced employ
ment counselor, Murray Head
as their common lover, and (in
smaller roles) Peggy Ashcrott
and Tony Britton.
Plays Thurday with Betrayal.
Murder, She Said (1962)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
As Agatha Christie's Miss
Marple, Margaret Rutherford
does a very funny impersona
tion of the British spirit —
staunch, obstinate, rugged and
fearless — alive and well in the
person of a spinster addicted
to murder mysteries. In the

first of the Marple movies,
adapted (by David Pursall and
lack Seddon) from 4:50 from
Paddington, she hires herself
out as a domestic in order to
locate the body of a woman
she saw being strangled on a
passing train. George Pollock
directed this pleasant diver
sion, which co-stars Arthur
Kennedy and a number of
other forgettable actors.
Plays Wednesday evening
with Murder Most Foul.
The Horse's Mouth (1958)
Festival, Palo Alto
Alec Guinness plays Gulley
limson, the iconoclastic artist
hero of Joyce Gary's grand, ec
centric comic novel; he did the
adaptation, too, which Ronald
Neame directed. It's a disap
pointment — rather conven
tional, without the real flame
of irreverence Cary planted in
Gulley in his book. But taken
on its own, it's a funny picture
with entertaining contribu
tions from Guinness, Renee
Houston and the delightfully
desiccated Ernest Thesiger as
Jimson's archenemy, the art
dealer Hickson. Kay Walsh
plays Coker, and Robert
Coote, Arthur Macrae and Mi
chael Gough are also in it. The
boring water-color photogra
phy is by Arthur Ibbetson, and
K.V. Jones' transpositions of
Prokofiev are overemphatically
sprightly, but the paintings
(done by John Bratby) suggest
cartoon versions of S i'nine.
Plays through V onesday
with Mori Onc/e.
