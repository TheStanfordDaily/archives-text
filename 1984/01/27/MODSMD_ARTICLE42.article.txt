# Vineberg's 1983 Picks
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
As a movie year, 198 5 might have
made history.
Between January and December
an overwhelming number of major
American directors released new
pictures: Hal Ashby, Martin Scor
sese, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven
Spielberg, Woody Allen, Sidney
Lumet, Martin Ritt, Irvin Kershner,
Carroll Ballard, Philip Kaufman, Sam
Peckinpah, Bob Fosse, Robert
Altman and Brian De Palma. As well,
we saw the latest offerings from
Peter Weir, the Taviani Brothers, Jan
Troell, Wim Wenders, Ingmar
Bergman, Jean-Jacques Beineix, Eric
Rohmer, Andrzej Wajda and Marco
Bellochio (The Eyes, the Mouth, not
yet released in this part of the
country).
Vet of the 90-odd films I saw
during the year, there were fewer
than 20 I'd recommend to anyone,
and even fewer about which I have
only minor reservations.
Most of the most eagerly awaited
films, especially from American
directors, turned out to be inconse
quential (Peckinpah's The Osterman
Weekend and even Irvin Kershner's
entertaining Never Say Never
Again), offensive (Scorsese's The
King of Comedy, Fosse's Star 80),
narcissistic (Coppola's two S.E. Hin
ton adaptations, The Outsiders and
Rumble Fish), or shockingly bad (De
Palma's Scarface); in that company,

a pair of failed efforts — Streamers
(Robert Altman) and the intermit
tently magnificent Never Cry Wolf
(Carroll Ballard) — seemed positive
ly noble.
For once, there were more inter
esting films from abroad, though
only the most dedicated cinephiles
(and masochists) made it all the way
through |ean-|acques Beineix's The
Moon in the Gutter without groan
ing.
Possibly my list of preferred
movies will appear perverse and wil
fully esoteric. I can only say in my
own defense that the most popular
films are not necessarily the best
ones, and my resistance to Terms of
Endearment, Testament, Risky Busi
ness and The Ballad of Gregorio Cor
tez on the grounds that I dislike
being manipulated, or to Tender
Mercies and La Nuit de Varennes
on the grounds that I resent
soporifics that pass themselves off
as thoughtful pieces of filmmaking,
perhaps reflects the number of
times I've had similar experiences at
the movies.
The 10 movies on my list, I would
submit, have an unusual resonance,
a fresh perspective.
There are, as always, a handful of
movies worth mentioning that do

not appear among the top 10. Zelig
is a lovely, though small-scale, com
edy, and the first good film Woody
Allen has made since Annie Hall.
Danton, Wajda's chronicle of the
French Revolution, is rousing fun
(whatever one's doubts about it as
history), and so are the first two
thirds of War Games and the first
two-thirds of Superman 111 — per
haps the most expensive screwball
comedy ever produced. The second
half of The Twilight Zone — the Joe
Dante and George Miller segments
— more than redeems the paltry
first half. My favorite bad movie of
the year is The Man with Two Brains,
in which Steve Martin is even fun
nier than usual and Kathleen Turner
proves her wit by turning in an ex
pert parody on her own perfor
mance as the seductress in Body
Heat.
BEST PICTURE
1. The Night of the Shooting Stars
Vittorio and Paolo Taviani, who
made Padre Padrone, collaborated
on last year's masterwork. During
the last days of the Italian occupa
tion, a group of peasants flee their
town in the hope of meeting up with
the Americans, whom they see as
their liberators. This is a film with
such a special vision — war as
magic, as seen through the eyes of a
child — that it demands comparison

with the greatest films about war
(The Birth of a Nation, Grand Illu
sion, Forbidden Games, Fires on the
Plain).
2. The Eyes, the Mouth
In the latest film by the
prodigiously gifted Italian director
Marco Bellochio, a young actor (Lou
Castel) returns home for the funeral
of ■ tii nymiiiiltt'rf'
suicide. Lou Castel, Bellochio's fa
vorite actor, played a matricide in
Fists in the Pocket, the 1966 film that
established Bellochio's reputation;
here he plays a film star whose per
formance in Fists in the Pocket
represents his past — he is no
longer in demand because his deep
-1960s anger is not marketable in the
'80s. An extraordinary comedy
about survival, with a remarkable,
sensuous performance by Angela
Molina as the dead man's girl friend
and an offbeat, upbeat ending.
3. Under Fire
Roger Spottiswoode, one of the
best editors in the country, made
this intelligent, unsentimental politi
cal movie from a first-rate script by
Ron Shelton and Clayton Frohman.
The setting is Nicaragua in 1979,
during the Sandinista rebellion
against the dictatorship of General
Somoza. Nick Nolte, Joanna Cassidy

and Gene Hackman give beautifully
understated performances as jour
nalists caught in an ethical dilemma;
among the movie's incidental
pleasures is a haunting musical
score by Jerry Goldsmith (featuring
Pat Metheny as guest soloist).
4. Local Hero
It's virtually impossible to
describe how this minor-key Scotch
comedy, written and directed by Bill
Forsyth, works, but almost every
scene in it does. Peter Riegert plays
a young Houston executive sent by
his boss (Burt Lancaster, in a warm,
larger-than-life performance that
dominates the movie) to buy a small
fishing village in Scotland so that an
oil refinery can take its place. But,
like Brigadoon, this unassuming vil
lage casts its own magic spell.
5. Fanny and Alexander
Ingmar Bergman's swan song, a
deeply satisfying novel of a movie
with Strindbergian, Dickensian and
Shakespearean overtones. Unfor
tunately, nothing else in the movie
matches its glorious opening hour,
but few films offer as many
pleasures — not the least of which is
the collection of fine performances.
6. The Right Stuff
A true curio: a three-and-a
quarter-hour, $27 million movie
about the first American astronauts
that obstinately refuses to turn into
a spectacle and actually manages to
juggle six or seven styles and an
equal number of tones without des
cending into chaos. This lunatic
patchwork is the most enormously
entertaining (and impeccably acted)
American movie of the year. Written
and directed by Philip Kaufman.
7. The Flight of the Eagle
The Swedish filmmaker Jan Troell
directed, shot and edited this mag
nificent movie, and he worked on
the script, too. He derived it from
the true story of a trio of Swedes
who embarked on a tragic expedi
tion to the Arctic in 1897. Perhaps
partly because of the austerity of its
subject matter (and it is a ruthless
film), this movie attracted little
notice on its release last spring, and
it vanished without even opening on
the Peninsula. Max von Sydow gives
an immaculate performance as the
leader of the eroup, Salomon
8. The Year of Living Dangerously
Peter Weir's swashbuckler, set in
Indonesia during the last gasps of
Sukarno's regime. It's only perip
herally a political film (compared to
Under Fire, which is really about
something): the poverty of the
Jakartans and the violent disruptions
in the country serve to heighten the
romantic adventure story about
journalists (Mel Gibson, Sigourney
Weaver) in love and in danger. But
it's a stunning piece of filmmaking.
Linda Hunt's portrayal of a (male)
Chinese-Australian photographer
supplies its only genuine depth.
9. Yentl
Barbra Streisand adapts a fine
story by Isaac Bashevis Singer and
gives it the benefit of a feminine
sensibility. She plays a Jewess in Eas
tern Europe in the early days of this
century who disguises herself as a
young man in order to study Tal

mud; when she falls in love with her
study partner (Mandy Patinkin) and
marries his ex-fiancee (Amy Irving),
the movie becomes giddy and
touching — like Twelfth Night told
by a woman.
10. Say Amen, Somebody
A wonderful documentary about
gospel by George Nierenberg,
who directed No Maps on My Taps
for PBS a few years ago. If a docu
mentary can have a star, Thomas A.
Dorsey, "the father of gospel
music," is Nierenberg's star; he's an
irrepressible oldster, still proud and
animated, whose powerful, fixating
presence makes most of the second
and third-generation gospellers in
the movie seem lightweight in com
parison. And because we know that
Nierenberg has caught, in Dorsey,
the last vestiges of early gospel, the
movie is ; .tpably poignant.
