Happy horror
He's mean. He's got a haircut.
And he wears velour.
It's thriller night at The Stanford
Daily, starting Friday at four-thirty. If
you've known and loved The Chief,
now come meet The Boss.
Ask him how he became editor.
He'll tell you he was Born To Run.
And before you Fade Away: If
you're a department editor, set up

an appointment with the bossettes.
Everyone else make a lynch date
with staff editor Richard Lunch.
Out on the streets?
Come by and pick up your W-2
forms. They'll be mailed home on
Tuesday if you don't. If you don't
know what a W-2 form is, it's a large
furry creature with strange carnal
appetites and an odor of abstinthe.
Vou don't want that kind of thing
in your P.O. box. So come by and
get it in person, and give it to Tim
Grieve. He collects them.
