# Response to Reagan budget cuts
## University 'digs' for financial aid funds 
### LYNN MARCUS 
The amount of financial aid
available to U.S. college students
has dropped by $2 billion in the last
two years, forcing Stanford to "dig
into our own pockets" and nearly
doubling the amount taken from
general funds for financial aid, ac
cording to University spokesmen.
A recently released College Board
report said cutbacks by Congress
and the Reagan administration have
triggered a drop in financial aid funds,
from an $18 billion high in 1981-82 to
an estimated $16.1 billion this year.
Stanford cushioned these cuts by
increasing its reliance on general
funds from $5.1 million in 1981-82 to
an estimated $9.9 million this year,
according to Robert Fluff, director
of the Financial Aids Office.
"We dug into our own pockets
because of our commitment to meet
the financial needs of any student

who can demonstrate need," Huff
said.
The situation was different for col
lege students at other institutions,
said Fluff, estimating that only 5 per
cent of the nation's 3000 institutions
of higher education had both the re
sources and commitment to com
pensate for the cutbacks.
In its report, the College Board
reviewed student aid from federal,
state and institutional sources and
found that the real value of student
aid — after adjusting for inflation —
dropped 21 percent in the 1980s.
The report said most of the
decline can be attributed to the
phasing out of Social Security
benefits for college students, which
began in 1981; the restrictions on
eligibility for Guaranteed Student
Loans (GSL), imposed the same year
and a drop in the use of veterans'
benefits by Vietnam-era veterans.
The main effects of the drop in

funding on Stanford, besides "the
major effects for the University,"
were its impact on parents of stu
dents in the middle income bracket,
Fluff said. "Parents and students felt

it was not as easy to get along as
when the CSL credit was there,
families used to have flexibility in
resources."
In 1981, Congress barred families
with incomes above $30,000 from
obtaining the GSLs unless they
could prove need. The loans had
been available to students regard
less of need since 1972.
Stanford has been forced to reach
further into its own coffers to offset
the decline in funds not only be
cause of federal cuts but also be
cause of cuts in the California grant
program and an increase in requests
for financial aid due to the reces
sion, financial aid officials said.
Huff said that increases in gifts
and endowments for student aid
from $6.1 million to approximately
$7.1 million have also helped the
University counter funding cut
backs.
