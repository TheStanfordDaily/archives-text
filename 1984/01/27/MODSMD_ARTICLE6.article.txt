Nestle boycott ends
Washington — A one to two year boycott against
the Nestle Co. that spread from Minnesota to Fin
land ended yesterday after Nestle agreed to comply
in virtually every detail with the World Health Or
ganization's (WHO) infant formula sales code.
Protestors dropped their boycott of the compa
ny's chocolate bars and popular Taster's Choice cof
fee after Nestle agreed to comply with four final
points of a code designed to curb aggressive sales
tactics that boycotters said threatened the health of
babies in the Third World.
In a statement yesteiday, Nestle said it had tried to
comply with the code in 1984, "but it meant differ
ent things to different people." Yesterday's agree-

ment, the company said, is proof that its efforts to
comply "have finally been recognized. I his contro

The baby formula fight, which eventually involved
the State Department, a presidential appointee and
Congress, was characterized by Nestle in 19/8 as a
test of the free enterprise system
American killed in El Salvador
San Salvador, El Salvador — L eftist rebels shot and
killed an American woman who was traveling with
her family yesterday on the Pan American Highway
in eastern El Salvador, a military official said.
He said the woman, linda Cancel, her husband
and two children, ages five and one, were driving
toward Honduras when they ignored an order by

rebels to stop near the town of Jocoro in the north
cast province of Morazan.
The official said Mrs. Cancel's husband, whose
name was not released, was driving a white Chev
rolet minibus with Alabama license plates. He said
the family planned to go to Costa Rica, but the pur
pose of the trip was not disclosed.
A customs official was in the car with the family, as
is the practice when foreign travelers are heading for
the border, said the official, who asked not to be
identified for security reasons.
Cancel, who was driving, did not stop when or
dered to do so by the rebels because the customs
man was in the car. the official said. A bullet hit Mrs.
Cancel in the chest and exited through her back, he
said.
A U.S. Embassy official gave no information, ex
ept to say that an American who was not a member
of the embassy staff was killed.
The first report of Mrs. Cancel's death came from

a Roman Catholic priest who said he administered
the last rites and the shooting occurred El Divisadero
and Santa Rosa de Lima, about 127 miles east of San
Salvador.
The priest, who spoke in a telephone interview
from Santa Rosa de I ima and asked not be named,
said he also saw the body of a Salvadoran, but there
was no further information on that death-
Regan discusses deficits
Washington — Treasury Secretary Donald Regan
said yesterday that when a bipartisan commission
studies ways to slash the record budget deficit,
"nothing is non-negotiable"—except that the ad
ministration sees no need for major tax increases or
big defense budget cuts.
Congressional Denux i its meanwhile were cool
to President Reagan's election-year otter Wednes
day night to enter negotiations with a bipartisan
delegation from Congress aimed at finding ways to
trim the budget deticit b\ $100 billion over three
years.
After an appearance before the congressional
loint Economic Committee, the morning after the
president's State of the Union address Regan told
reporters that "everything is on the table when a
deficit-cutting commission meets
The treasury secretary quickly added that the ad
ministration prefers to start the effort b\ closing tax
"loopholes" reducing domestic spending and elim
inating waste in government.
Reagan himself said Wednesday night that his goal
is "prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit
reduction plan but he was adamant in opposing
any reteat from hi* costly military buildup or a major
tax boost.
Reagan s nr-t target would be to slash about $100
billion from deficits expected to total in the $600 bil
lion range over the next three years starting with a
projected dewit of $184 billion in the current fiscal
years which ends next 30.
Reagan orders weapons research
Washington — President Reagan ordered a
new "low-level research effort to determine it laser
beams and other possible space-based Star Wars
weapons can be used to defend the country against
incoming enemy missiles, White House spokesman
Larry Speakes said yesterday.
The long-expected decision, made formal earlier
this month in National Security Decision Directive
116, will add between $250 million and S3OO million
in fiscal 1985 to research into ballistic missile
defenses, which will cost about $1.2 billion this year,
officials said. Details of the new effort will be dis
closed in the federal budget to be presented next
week.
The Defense Department reportedly sold $600
million in new funds, but that cut back by the
White House, which has shown anxiety about rising
budget deficits in an election year. The administra
tion has also sought to counter criticism that the
"Star Wars" initiative was a precursor to an arms
race in space.
"This is a research program," Speakes empha
sized. "It does not include development or testing
and certainly would not be contrary to U.S. treaty
obligations," he added, alluding to the 1972 anti
ballistic missile treaty with the Soviet Union. That
pact bans development and testing of new missile
defenses as well as deployment ot such defenses
beyond the small systems now permitted each side.

Los Angeles — Fierce winds gusting up to 80 mph
whipped down through Southern California

Power outages were widespread in Los Angeles
and Orange counties, with more than 360,000 cus
tomers affected, utility officials said.
By midafternoon, with winds reported as high as
80 mph, Orange county fire officials said that about
200 acres had burned in Modjeska and Bolero
canyons, but no homes were reported in danger.
In Los Angeles county, a fire erupted during early
afternoon on a steep hillside at the top of the Arroyo
Seco in the foothills above Pasadena. About 100
firefighters from the Pasadena and Los Angeles
County fire departments and the U.S. Forest Service
were trying to battle the blaze in extremely difficult
terrain.

Winds were so strong in the area of the Arroyi
Seco tire that an unidentified man had to In

Candidates criticize Reagan
Washington — Democratic presidential con
tenders agreed vesterday that President Reagan
painted an overly rosy picture of the state ot the
union and tailed to offer concrete solutions for cut
ting federal deficits or improving the prospects for
world peace.
"The biggest indictment of what we heard last
night is that once again the issues that are essential,
the problems that must be solved for our future
were ducked, Walter Mondale said yesterday.
"I think the American people saw through that,"
the former vice president told a satellite news con
ference from Boston.
Sen. Gar\ Hart said the Reagan speech illustrated
a vast gap between what he perceives reality to lie
and what I perceive reality to be."
And Sen. Alan Cranston said, "The fact of the mat
ter is that the state of the union under Ronald
Reagan is unsatisfactory
In his State ot the Union address Wednesday
night, Reagan said, America is much improved, and
there is good reason to believe that improvement
will continue through the days to come."
Reagan also called for bipartisan support to
"advance our agenda for peace," including a more
stable basis for peaceful relations with the Soviet
Union and continuation of diplomatic efforts in the
Middle East.
To reduce the deficit, Reagan called for creation of
a bipartisan working group to develop a "down pay
ment" plan for reducing the red ink.
Glenn replaces campaign manager
Washington — Sen. )ohn Glenn (D-Ohio) whose
presidential campaign has fallen sharply in the polls
and faces crucial decisions in the days just ahead,
vesterday abruptly replaced his longtime aide and
campaign manager, William White.
In a drastic shakeup that came virtually on the eve
of the first primaries and caucuses and appeared to
strengthen the hand of senior political adviser
Robert Keefe, Glenn chose Gerald Vento, his lowa
coordinator, as his new campaign manager. White
will assume the title of campaign chairman and will
concentrate on fund raising and other duties.
The moves were a public acknowledgement of the
problems that have plagued the former astronaut's
candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomina
tion and came just days after Keefe sent Glenn a let
ter of resignation in which he complained about the
way the campaign was being run.
Glenn must decide quickly whether to scale back
his campaign efforts in lowa and divert scarce re
sources to the Southern states that hold primaries
on March 13, where his aides say they believe he has
the best chance of stopping former Vice President
Walter Mondale, now the clear frontrunner for the
nomination.

Yosemite windstorm kills one
YosemiU* National Park — Violent windstorms
11 h recorded gusts up to f>B mph yesterday killed
one man and isolated a small community in the Sier
ra Nevada.
I he same weather pattern that uprooted trees in
the mountains torced NASA to scratch a piggyback
flight ot the space shuttle Columbia to Edwards Air
force Base and caused major power outages in
Central and Southern California.
Its progressed into quite a disaster," said High
way Patrolman Ben Mc Thorn in the Tuolomne
County community ot Pinec rest about HO miles east
ot San Francisco.
lohn Douglas Callaway, died when he was
pinned under a 2 1 J toot diameter pine tree that fell
on Ins canvas-root tent-cabin at Yosemite National
Park, spokesman Lisa Dapprich said. He was
employed by the park concessionaire, Yosemite
Park and Curry Co.
No other injuries were reported.
In Southern California, winds knocked out electri
cal power to more than 40,000 customers in Los An
geles and Orange counties, flipped two trucks and a
private plane and fanned three brush fires.
The National Park Service closed Yosemite to in
coming traffic and advised 700 overnight guests to
sta\ in several buildings that were considered safe
from the winds as a precaution, Ms. Dapprich said.
About residents were isolated in Pinecrest by
downed trees and a power outage, said sheriff's
spokesman Mark Bennett. Falling trees damaged at
least three dwellings and a cross-country ski lodge,
but most of the area's 400 vacation homes were
vacant, officials said.
Union ban provokes uproar
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
\esterday that a controversial decision ordering
employees at Britain's top-secret signal intelligence
agency known as Government Communication
Headquarters to give up their membership in labor
unions was "absolutely vital for the security of this
country."
The decision, announced Wednesday, provoked
an uproar among union leaders and opposition
politicians who claimed that Thatcher had acted un
der pressure from the United States with which Brit
ain closely cooperates on intelligence matters. At
the instigation of the Reagan administration, Britain
agreed last summer to begin using lie-detectors to
improve security at intelligence facilities.
Labor leader Neil Kinnock said the latest
"shameful and shamefaced" move is "just another
pathetic example" of Thatcher's willingness to
"surrender British interests to American pressure."
"There was no American intervention of any kind
in this decision," Thatcher angrily retorted. The or
der against unions, she said, was intended to
protected highly activities against work stoppages,
such as took place in 1981.
An estimated 10,000 people work at the Govern
ment Communications Headquarters compound at
Cheltenham, about 80 miles from London, and in
outposts around the world. They monitor and evalu
ate radio signals and other electronic intelligence in
collaboration with the U.S. National Security
Agency.
About 60 percent of the British employees are
thought to be members of civil service unions. For
about five months in 1981, there was sporadic labor
trouble among GCHQ employees which, according
to a report in Thursday's London Times affected
"routine intelligence gathering."
In 1982, Geoffrey Prime, a long-time Russian lan
guage specialist in the agency was convicted of
spying for the Soviets, which caused serious con
cern among American officials about the level of se
curity there. This led directly to the introduction of a
program to use lie detectors in security checks after
a government commission agreed with U.S. officials

that the polygraph might have deterred Prime.
Union spokesmen yesterday acknowledged that
their objections to the plan may well have led to
Thatcher's decision to ban unions. The government
offered to pay each employee $1400 in return for
leaving the union and ottered to transfer any em
ployee who chose that option instead.
The unions' umbrella organization, the Trades
Union Congress, protested the government action,
saying that the decision had been taken without
prior consultation and threatened the rights of
union membership throughout government.
Progress in Hong Kong talks
Peking — A broad agreement on the future of the
British crown colony of Hong Kong as an autono
mous, capital»sh enclave within China appears to be
emerging from the most recent negotiations be
tween London and Peking.
British and Chinese negotiators, who ended their
eighth formal two-day session yesterday and
pronounced it "usetul and constructive," are
gradually fashioning an agreement that returns
Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997, lays out a se
ries of transitional measures that London will
beforehand and elaborates Peking's promises of
self-government afterward.
A joint Sino-British statement outlining the agree
ment is expected this summer, perhaps as early as
late spring, according to Western diplomats who fol
low the negotiations here closely, and further talks
are then likely on details of the complex transition.
Chinese Communist Party Ceneral Secretary Hu
Yaobang, praising the progress in the negotiations
after a lengthy deadlock, said this week, "it appears
possible to reach an acceptable solution for both
parties, China and Britain, since the negotiations
have been going on smoothly.''
"More time is needed, of course, to take care of
the details ," Hu added, but the agreement now
envisioned will meet the "fundamental interests of
both China and Britain."
Premier Zhao Ziyang, in response to questions in
the United States and Canada during his visits there
this month, also predicted an agreement soon on
Hong Kong's transition from a British colony to
status as a "special administrative region" of China
with self-government, a free-market economy and a
social system that would still have horse racing, dis
cotheques, X-rated films and opposition
newspapers.
' When I say that I am optimistic about a solution
of the Hong Kong question," Zhao said in Canada,
this is not casual talk. There is ground tor me to say
so."
British officials have been more restrained, con
fining themselves publicly to noting that the
negotiations have moved into "a more detailed
phase" in the past three months and that progress is
being made.
Yet they also seem more optimistic than before
that a basic agreement can be concluded this year
and that, with this underpinning, detailed arrange
ments for a smooth transition can be worked out.

Nestle boycott ends
Washington — A one to two year boycott against
the Nestle Co. that spread from Minnesota to Fin
land ended yesterday after Nestle agreed to comply
in virtually every detail with the World Health Or
ganization's (WHO) infant formula sales code.
Protestors dropped their boycott of the compa

fee after Nestle agreed to comply with four final
points of a code designed to curb aggressive sales
tactics that boycotters said threatened the health of
babies in the Third World.
In a statement yesteiday, Nestle said it had tried to
comply with the code in 1984, "but it meant differ

American killed in El Salvador
San Salvador, El Salvador — L eftist rebels shot and
killed an American woman who was traveling with
her family yesterday on the Pan American Highway
in eastern El Salvador, a military official said.
He said the woman, linda Cancel, her husband
and two children, ages five and one, were driving
toward Honduras when they ignored an order by

rebels to stop near the town of Jocoro in the north
cast province of Morazan.
The official said Mrs. Cancel's husband, whose
name was not released, was driving a white Chev
rolet minibus with Alabama license plates. He said
the family planned to go to Costa Rica, but the pur
pose of the trip was not disclosed.
A customs official was in the car with the family, as
is the practice when foreign travelers are heading for
the border, said the official, who asked not to be
identified for security reasons.
Cancel, who was driving, did not stop when or
dered to do so by the rebels because the customs
man was in the car. the official said. A bullet hit Mrs.
Cancel in the chest and exited through her back, he
said.
A U.S. Embassy official gave no information, ex
ept to say that an American who was not a member
of the embassy staff was killed.
The first report of Mrs. Cancel's death came from

a Roman Catholic priest who said he administered
the last rites and the shooting occurred El Divisadero
and Santa Rosa de Lima, about 127 miles east of San
Salvador.
The priest, who spoke in a telephone interview
from Santa Rosa de I ima and asked not be named,
said he also saw the body of a Salvadoran, but there
was no further information on that death-
Regan discusses deficits
Washington — Treasury Secretary Donald Regan
said yesterday that when a bipartisan commission
studies ways to slash the record budget deficit,
"nothing is non-negotiable"—except that the ad
ministration sees no need for major tax increases or
big defense budget cuts.
Congressional Denux i its meanwhile were cool
to President Reagan's election-year otter Wednes
day night to enter negotiations with a bipartisan
delegation from Congress aimed at finding ways to
trim the budget deticit b\ $100 billion over three
years.
After an appearance before the congressional
loint Economic Committee, the morning after the
president's State of the Union address Regan told
reporters that "everything is on the table when a
deficit-cutting commission meets
The treasury secretary quickly added that the ad
ministration prefers to start the effort b\ closing tax
"loopholes" reducing domestic spending and elim
inating waste in government.
Reagan himself said Wednesday night that his goal
is "prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit
reduction plan but he was adamant in opposing
any reteat from hi* costly military buildup or a major
tax boost.
Reagan s nr-t target would be to slash about $100
billion from deficits expected to total in the $600 bil
lion range over the next three years starting with a
projected dewit of $184 billion in the current fiscal
years which ends next 30.
Reagan orders weapons research
Washington — President Reagan ordered a
new "low-level research effort to determine it laser
beams and other possible space-based Star Wars
weapons can be used to defend the country against
incoming enemy missiles, White House spokesman
Larry Speakes said yesterday.
The long-expected decision, made formal earlier
this month in National Security Decision Directive
116, will add between $250 million and S3OO million
in fiscal 1985 to research into ballistic missile
defenses, which will cost about $1.2 billion this year,
officials said. Details of the new effort will be dis
closed in the federal budget to be presented next
week.
The Defense Department reportedly sold $600
million in new funds, but that cut back by the
White House, which has shown anxiety about rising
budget deficits in an election year. The administra
tion has also sought to counter criticism that the
"Star Wars" initiative was a precursor to an arms
race in space.
"This is a research program," Speakes empha
sized. "It does not include development or testing
and certainly would not be contrary to U.S. treaty
obligations," he added, alluding to the 1972 anti
ballistic missile treaty with the Soviet Union. That
pact bans development and testing of new missile
defenses as well as deployment ot such defenses
beyond the small systems now permitted each side.

Candidates criticize Reagan
Washington — Democratic presidential con

world peace.
"The biggest indictment of what we heard last
night is that once again the issues that are essential,
the problems that must be solved for our future
were ducked, Walter Mondale said yesterday.
"I think the American people saw through that,"
the former vice president told a satellite news con

Sen. Gar\ Hart said the Reagan speech illustrated

In his State ot the Union address Wednesday

To reduce the deficit, Reagan called for creation of
a bipartisan working group to develop a "down pay

Glenn replaces campaign manager
Washington — Sen. )ohn Glenn (D-Ohio) whose
presidential campaign has fallen sharply in the polls
and faces crucial decisions in the days just ahead,
vesterday abruptly replaced his longtime aide and
campaign manager, William White.
In a drastic shakeup that came virtually on the eve
of the first primaries and caucuses and appeared to
strengthen the hand of senior political adviser
Robert Keefe, Glenn chose Gerald Vento, his lowa
coordinator, as his new campaign manager. White
will assume the title of campaign chairman and will
concentrate on fund raising and other duties.
The moves were a public acknowledgement of the
problems that have plagued the former astronaut's
candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomina
tion and came just days after Keefe sent Glenn a let
ter of resignation in which he complained about the
way the campaign was being run.
Glenn must decide quickly whether to scale back
his campaign efforts in lowa and divert scarce re
sources to the Southern states that hold primaries
on March 13, where his aides say they believe he has
the best chance of stopping former Vice President
Walter Mondale, now the clear frontrunner for the

Yosemite windstorm kills one

I he same weather pattern that uprooted trees in
the mountains torced NASA to scratch a piggyback
flight ot the space shuttle Columbia to Edwards Air

Central and Southern California.
Its progressed into quite a disaster," said High

No other injuries were reported.
In Southern California, winds knocked out electri
cal power to more than 40,000 customers in Los An
geles and Orange counties, flipped two trucks and a
private plane and fanned three brush fires.
The National Park Service closed Yosemite to in
coming traffic and advised 700 overnight guests to

from the winds as a precaution, Ms. Dapprich said.
About residents were isolated in Pinecrest by

Union ban provokes uproar
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
\esterday that a controversial decision ordering
employees at Britain's top-secret signal intelligence
agency known as Government Communication
Headquarters to give up their membership in labor
unions was "absolutely vital for the security of this
country."
The decision, announced Wednesday, provoked
an uproar among union leaders and opposition
politicians who claimed that Thatcher had acted un
der pressure from the United States with which Brit
ain closely cooperates on intelligence matters. At
the instigation of the Reagan administration, Britain
agreed last summer to begin using lie-detectors to
improve security at intelligence facilities.
Labor leader Neil Kinnock said the latest
"shameful and shamefaced" move is "just another
pathetic example" of Thatcher's willingness to
"surrender British interests to American pressure."
"There was no American intervention of any kind
in this decision," Thatcher angrily retorted. The or
der against unions, she said, was intended to
protected highly activities against work stoppages,
such as took place in 1981.
An estimated 10,000 people work at the Govern
ment Communications Headquarters compound at
Cheltenham, about 80 miles from London, and in
outposts around the world. They monitor and evalu
ate radio signals and other electronic intelligence in
collaboration with the U.S. National Security
Agency.
About 60 percent of the British employees are
thought to be members of civil service unions. For
about five months in 1981, there was sporadic labor
trouble among GCHQ employees which, according
to a report in Thursday's London Times affected
"routine intelligence gathering."
In 1982, Geoffrey Prime, a long-time Russian lan
guage specialist in the agency was convicted of
spying for the Soviets, which caused serious con
cern among American officials about the level of se
curity there. This led directly to the introduction of a
program to use lie detectors in security checks after
a government commission agreed with U.S. officials

that the polygraph might have deterred Prime.
Union spokesmen yesterday acknowledged that
their objections to the plan may well have led to
Thatcher's decision to ban unions. The government
offered to pay each employee $1400 in return for
leaving the union and ottered to transfer any em
ployee who chose that option instead.
The unions' umbrella organization, the Trades
Union Congress, protested the government action,
saying that the decision had been taken without
prior consultation and threatened the rights of
union membership throughout government.
Progress in Hong Kong talks
Peking — A broad agreement on the future of the
British crown colony of Hong Kong as an autono
mous, capital»sh enclave within China appears to be
emerging from the most recent negotiations be
tween London and Peking.
British and Chinese negotiators, who ended their
eighth formal two-day session yesterday and
pronounced it "usetul and constructive," are
gradually fashioning an agreement that returns
Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997, lays out a se
ries of transitional measures that London will
beforehand and elaborates Peking's promises of
self-government afterward.
A joint Sino-British statement outlining the agree
ment is expected this summer, perhaps as early as
late spring, according to Western diplomats who fol
low the negotiations here closely, and further talks
are then likely on details of the complex transition.
Chinese Communist Party Ceneral Secretary Hu
Yaobang, praising the progress in the negotiations
after a lengthy deadlock, said this week, "it appears
possible to reach an acceptable solution for both
parties, China and Britain, since the negotiations
have been going on smoothly.''
"More time is needed, of course, to take care of
the details ," Hu added, but the agreement now
envisioned will meet the "fundamental interests of
both China and Britain."
Premier Zhao Ziyang, in response to questions in
the United States and Canada during his visits there
this month, also predicted an agreement soon on
Hong Kong's transition from a British colony to
status as a "special administrative region" of China
with self-government, a free-market economy and a
social system that would still have horse racing, dis
cotheques, X-rated films and opposition
newspapers.
' When I say that I am optimistic about a solution
of the Hong Kong question," Zhao said in Canada,
this is not casual talk. There is ground tor me to say
so."
British officials have been more restrained, con
fining themselves publicly to noting that the
negotiations have moved into "a more detailed
phase" in the past three months and that progress is
being made.
Yet they also seem more optimistic than before
that a basic agreement can be concluded this year
and that, with this underpinning, detailed arrange
ments for a smooth transition can be worked out.

Nestle boycott ends
Washington — A one to two year boycott against
the Nestle Co. that spread from Minnesota to Fin
land ended yesterday after Nestle agreed to comply
in virtually every detail with the World Health Or
ganization's (WHO) infant formula sales code.
Protestors dropped their boycott of the compa

points of a code designed to curb aggressive sales
tactics that boycotters said threatened the health of
babies in the Third World.
In a statement yesteiday, Nestle said it had tried to
comply with the code in 1984, "but it meant differ

American killed in El Salvador
San Salvador, El Salvador — L eftist rebels shot and
killed an American woman who was traveling with
her family yesterday on the Pan American Highway
in eastern El Salvador, a military official said.
He said the woman, linda Cancel, her husband
and two children, ages five and one, were driving
toward Honduras when they ignored an order by

rebels to stop near the town of Jocoro in the north
cast province of Morazan.
The official said Mrs. Cancel's husband, whose
name was not released, was driving a white Chev
rolet minibus with Alabama license plates. He said
the family planned to go to Costa Rica, but the pur
pose of the trip was not disclosed.
A customs official was in the car with the family, as
is the practice when foreign travelers are heading for
the border, said the official, who asked not to be
identified for security reasons.
Cancel, who was driving, did not stop when or
dered to do so by the rebels because the customs
man was in the car. the official said. A bullet hit Mrs.
Cancel in the chest and exited through her back, he
said.
A U.S. Embassy official gave no information, ex
ept to say that an American who was not a member
of the embassy staff was killed.
The first report of Mrs. Cancel's death came from

a Roman Catholic priest who said he administered
the last rites and the shooting occurred El Divisadero
and Santa Rosa de Lima, about 127 miles east of San
Salvador.
The priest, who spoke in a telephone interview
from Santa Rosa de I ima and asked not be named,
said he also saw the body of a Salvadoran, but there
was no further information on that death-
Regan discusses deficits
Washington — Treasury Secretary Donald Regan
said yesterday that when a bipartisan commission
studies ways to slash the record budget deficit,
"nothing is non-negotiable"—except that the ad
ministration sees no need for major tax increases or
big defense budget cuts.
Congressional Denux i its meanwhile were cool
to President Reagan's election-year otter Wednes
day night to enter negotiations with a bipartisan
delegation from Congress aimed at finding ways to
trim the budget deticit b\ $100 billion over three
years.
After an appearance before the congressional
loint Economic Committee, the morning after the
president's State of the Union address Regan told
reporters that "everything is on the table when a
deficit-cutting commission meets
The treasury secretary quickly added that the ad
ministration prefers to start the effort b\ closing tax
"loopholes" reducing domestic spending and elim
inating waste in government.
Reagan himself said Wednesday night that his goal
is "prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit
reduction plan but he was adamant in opposing
any reteat from hi* costly military buildup or a major
tax boost.
Reagan s nr-t target would be to slash about $100
billion from deficits expected to total in the $600 bil
lion range over the next three years starting with a
projected dewit of $184 billion in the current fiscal
years which ends next 30.
Reagan orders weapons research
Washington — President Reagan ordered a
new "low-level research effort to determine it laser
beams and other possible space-based Star Wars
weapons can be used to defend the country against
incoming enemy missiles, White House spokesman
Larry Speakes said yesterday.
The long-expected decision, made formal earlier
this month in National Security Decision Directive
116, will add between $250 million and S3OO million
in fiscal 1985 to research into ballistic missile
defenses, which will cost about $1.2 billion this year,
officials said. Details of the new effort will be dis
closed in the federal budget to be presented next
week.
The Defense Department reportedly sold $600
million in new funds, but that cut back by the
White House, which has shown anxiety about rising
budget deficits in an election year. The administra
tion has also sought to counter criticism that the
"Star Wars" initiative was a precursor to an arms
race in space.
"This is a research program," Speakes empha
sized. "It does not include development or testing
and certainly would not be contrary to U.S. treaty
obligations," he added, alluding to the 1972 anti
ballistic missile treaty with the Soviet Union. That
pact bans development and testing of new missile
defenses as well as deployment ot such defenses
beyond the small systems now permitted each side.

Candidates criticize Reagan
Washington — Democratic presidential con

painted an overly rosy picture of the state ot the
union and tailed to offer concrete solutions for cut

world peace.
"The biggest indictment of what we heard last
night is that once again the issues that are essential,
the problems that must be solved for our future
were ducked, Walter Mondale said yesterday.
"I think the American people saw through that,"
the former vice president told a satellite news con

Sen. Gar\ Hart said the Reagan speech illustrated
a vast gap between what he perceives reality to lie
and what I perceive reality to be."
And Sen. Alan Cranston said, "The fact of the mat
ter is that the state of the union under Ronald
Reagan is unsatisfactory
In his State ot the Union address Wednesday
night, Reagan said, America is much improved, and
there is good reason to believe that improvement

Reagan also called for bipartisan support to
"advance our agenda for peace," including a more
stable basis for peaceful relations with the Soviet
Union and continuation of diplomatic efforts in the
Middle East.
To reduce the deficit, Reagan called for creation of
a bipartisan working group to develop a "down pay

Glenn replaces campaign manager
Washington — Sen. )ohn Glenn (D-Ohio) whose
presidential campaign has fallen sharply in the polls
and faces crucial decisions in the days just ahead,
vesterday abruptly replaced his longtime aide and
campaign manager, William White.
In a drastic shakeup that came virtually on the eve
of the first primaries and caucuses and appeared to
strengthen the hand of senior political adviser
Robert Keefe, Glenn chose Gerald Vento, his lowa
coordinator, as his new campaign manager. White
will assume the title of campaign chairman and will
concentrate on fund raising and other duties.
The moves were a public acknowledgement of the
problems that have plagued the former astronaut's
candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomina
tion and came just days after Keefe sent Glenn a let
ter of resignation in which he complained about the
way the campaign was being run.
Glenn must decide quickly whether to scale back
his campaign efforts in lowa and divert scarce re
sources to the Southern states that hold primaries
on March 13, where his aides say they believe he has
the best chance of stopping former Vice President
Walter Mondale, now the clear frontrunner for the

Yosemite windstorm kills one
YosemiU* National Park — Violent windstorms

I he same weather pattern that uprooted trees in
the mountains torced NASA to scratch a piggyback
flight ot the space shuttle Columbia to Edwards Air

Central and Southern California.
Its progressed into quite a disaster," said High

ot San Francisco.
lohn Douglas Callaway, died when he was
pinned under a 2 1 J toot diameter pine tree that fell
on Ins canvas-root tent-cabin at Yosemite National
Park, spokesman Lisa Dapprich said. He was
employed by the park concessionaire, Yosemite
Park and Curry Co.
No other injuries were reported.
In Southern California, winds knocked out electri
cal power to more than 40,000 customers in Los An
geles and Orange counties, flipped two trucks and a
private plane and fanned three brush fires.
The National Park Service closed Yosemite to in
coming traffic and advised 700 overnight guests to

from the winds as a precaution, Ms. Dapprich said.
About residents were isolated in Pinecrest by

Union ban provokes uproar
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
\esterday that a controversial decision ordering
employees at Britain's top-secret signal intelligence
agency known as Government Communication
Headquarters to give up their membership in labor
unions was "absolutely vital for the security of this
country."
The decision, announced Wednesday, provoked
an uproar among union leaders and opposition
politicians who claimed that Thatcher had acted un
der pressure from the United States with which Brit
ain closely cooperates on intelligence matters. At
the instigation of the Reagan administration, Britain
agreed last summer to begin using lie-detectors to
improve security at intelligence facilities.
Labor leader Neil Kinnock said the latest
"shameful and shamefaced" move is "just another
pathetic example" of Thatcher's willingness to
"surrender British interests to American pressure."
"There was no American intervention of any kind
in this decision," Thatcher angrily retorted. The or
der against unions, she said, was intended to
protected highly activities against work stoppages,
such as took place in 1981.
An estimated 10,000 people work at the Govern
ment Communications Headquarters compound at
Cheltenham, about 80 miles from London, and in
outposts around the world. They monitor and evalu
ate radio signals and other electronic intelligence in
collaboration with the U.S. National Security
Agency.
About 60 percent of the British employees are
thought to be members of civil service unions. For
about five months in 1981, there was sporadic labor
trouble among GCHQ employees which, according
to a report in Thursday's London Times affected
"routine intelligence gathering."
In 1982, Geoffrey Prime, a long-time Russian lan
guage specialist in the agency was convicted of
spying for the Soviets, which caused serious con
cern among American officials about the level of se
curity there. This led directly to the introduction of a
program to use lie detectors in security checks after
a government commission agreed with U.S. officials

that the polygraph might have deterred Prime.
Union spokesmen yesterday acknowledged that
their objections to the plan may well have led to
Thatcher's decision to ban unions. The government
offered to pay each employee $1400 in return for
leaving the union and ottered to transfer any em
ployee who chose that option instead.
The unions' umbrella organization, the Trades
Union Congress, protested the government action,
saying that the decision had been taken without
prior consultation and threatened the rights of
union membership throughout government.
Progress in Hong Kong talks
Peking — A broad agreement on the future of the
British crown colony of Hong Kong as an autono
mous, capital»sh enclave within China appears to be
emerging from the most recent negotiations be
tween London and Peking.
British and Chinese negotiators, who ended their
eighth formal two-day session yesterday and
pronounced it "usetul and constructive," are
gradually fashioning an agreement that returns
Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997, lays out a se
ries of transitional measures that London will
beforehand and elaborates Peking's promises of
self-government afterward.
A joint Sino-British statement outlining the agree
ment is expected this summer, perhaps as early as
late spring, according to Western diplomats who fol
low the negotiations here closely, and further talks
are then likely on details of the complex transition.
Chinese Communist Party Ceneral Secretary Hu
Yaobang, praising the progress in the negotiations
after a lengthy deadlock, said this week, "it appears
possible to reach an acceptable solution for both
parties, China and Britain, since the negotiations
have been going on smoothly.''
"More time is needed, of course, to take care of
the details ," Hu added, but the agreement now
envisioned will meet the "fundamental interests of
both China and Britain."
Premier Zhao Ziyang, in response to questions in
the United States and Canada during his visits there
this month, also predicted an agreement soon on
Hong Kong's transition from a British colony to
status as a "special administrative region" of China
with self-government, a free-market economy and a
social system that would still have horse racing, dis
cotheques, X-rated films and opposition
newspapers.
' When I say that I am optimistic about a solution
of the Hong Kong question," Zhao said in Canada,
this is not casual talk. There is ground tor me to say
so."
British officials have been more restrained, con
fining themselves publicly to noting that the
negotiations have moved into "a more detailed
phase" in the past three months and that progress is
being made.
Yet they also seem more optimistic than before
that a basic agreement can be concluded this year
and that, with this underpinning, detailed arrange
ments for a smooth transition can be worked out.

Nestle boycott ends
Washington — A one to two year boycott against
the Nestle Co. that spread from Minnesota to Fin
land ended yesterday after Nestle agreed to comply
in virtually every detail with the World Health Or
ganization's (WHO) infant formula sales code.
Protestors dropped their boycott of the compa

points of a code designed to curb aggressive sales
tactics that boycotters said threatened the health of
babies in the Third World.
In a statement yesteiday, Nestle said it had tried to
comply with the code in 1984, "but it meant differ

American killed in El Salvador
San Salvador, El Salvador — L eftist rebels shot and
killed an American woman who was traveling with
her family yesterday on the Pan American Highway
in eastern El Salvador, a military official said.
He said the woman, linda Cancel, her husband
and two children, ages five and one, were driving
toward Honduras when they ignored an order by

rebels to stop near the town of Jocoro in the north
cast province of Morazan.
The official said Mrs. Cancel's husband, whose
name was not released, was driving a white Chev
rolet minibus with Alabama license plates. He said
the family planned to go to Costa Rica, but the pur
pose of the trip was not disclosed.
A customs official was in the car with the family, as
is the practice when foreign travelers are heading for
the border, said the official, who asked not to be
identified for security reasons.
Cancel, who was driving, did not stop when or
dered to do so by the rebels because the customs
man was in the car. the official said. A bullet hit Mrs.
Cancel in the chest and exited through her back, he
said.
A U.S. Embassy official gave no information, ex
ept to say that an American who was not a member
of the embassy staff was killed.
The first report of Mrs. Cancel's death came from

a Roman Catholic priest who said he administered
the last rites and the shooting occurred El Divisadero
and Santa Rosa de Lima, about 127 miles east of San
Salvador.
The priest, who spoke in a telephone interview
from Santa Rosa de I ima and asked not be named,
said he also saw the body of a Salvadoran, but there
was no further information on that death-
Regan discusses deficits
Washington — Treasury Secretary Donald Regan
said yesterday that when a bipartisan commission
studies ways to slash the record budget deficit,
"nothing is non-negotiable"—except that the ad
ministration sees no need for major tax increases or
big defense budget cuts.
Congressional Denux i its meanwhile were cool
to President Reagan's election-year otter Wednes
day night to enter negotiations with a bipartisan
delegation from Congress aimed at finding ways to
trim the budget deticit b\ $100 billion over three
years.
After an appearance before the congressional
loint Economic Committee, the morning after the
president's State of the Union address Regan told
reporters that "everything is on the table when a
deficit-cutting commission meets
The treasury secretary quickly added that the ad
ministration prefers to start the effort b\ closing tax
"loopholes" reducing domestic spending and elim
inating waste in government.
Reagan himself said Wednesday night that his goal
is "prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit
reduction plan but he was adamant in opposing
any reteat from hi* costly military buildup or a major
tax boost.
Reagan s nr-t target would be to slash about $100
billion from deficits expected to total in the $600 bil
lion range over the next three years starting with a
projected dewit of $184 billion in the current fiscal
years which ends next 30.
Reagan orders weapons research
Washington — President Reagan ordered a
new "low-level research effort to determine it laser
beams and other possible space-based Star Wars
weapons can be used to defend the country against
incoming enemy missiles, White House spokesman
Larry Speakes said yesterday.
The long-expected decision, made formal earlier
this month in National Security Decision Directive
116, will add between $250 million and S3OO million
in fiscal 1985 to research into ballistic missile
defenses, which will cost about $1.2 billion this year,
officials said. Details of the new effort will be dis
closed in the federal budget to be presented next
week.
The Defense Department reportedly sold $600
million in new funds, but that cut back by the
White House, which has shown anxiety about rising
budget deficits in an election year. The administra
tion has also sought to counter criticism that the
"Star Wars" initiative was a precursor to an arms
race in space.
"This is a research program," Speakes empha
sized. "It does not include development or testing
and certainly would not be contrary to U.S. treaty
obligations," he added, alluding to the 1972 anti
ballistic missile treaty with the Soviet Union. That
pact bans development and testing of new missile
defenses as well as deployment ot such defenses
beyond the small systems now permitted each side.

Candidates criticize Reagan
Washington — Democratic presidential con

world peace.
"The biggest indictment of what we heard last
night is that once again the issues that are essential,
the problems that must be solved for our future
were ducked, Walter Mondale said yesterday.
"I think the American people saw through that,"
the former vice president told a satellite news con

Sen. Gar\ Hart said the Reagan speech illustrated
a vast gap between what he perceives reality to lie
and what I perceive reality to be."
And Sen. Alan Cranston said, "The fact of the mat

Reagan is unsatisfactory
In his State ot the Union address Wednesday

Reagan also called for bipartisan support to
"advance our agenda for peace," including a more
stable basis for peaceful relations with the Soviet
Union and continuation of diplomatic efforts in the
Middle East.
To reduce the deficit, Reagan called for creation of
a bipartisan working group to develop a "down pay

Glenn replaces campaign manager
Washington — Sen. )ohn Glenn (D-Ohio) whose
presidential campaign has fallen sharply in the polls
and faces crucial decisions in the days just ahead,
vesterday abruptly replaced his longtime aide and
campaign manager, William White.
In a drastic shakeup that came virtually on the eve
of the first primaries and caucuses and appeared to
strengthen the hand of senior political adviser
Robert Keefe, Glenn chose Gerald Vento, his lowa
coordinator, as his new campaign manager. White
will assume the title of campaign chairman and will
concentrate on fund raising and other duties.
The moves were a public acknowledgement of the
problems that have plagued the former astronaut's
candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomina
tion and came just days after Keefe sent Glenn a let
ter of resignation in which he complained about the
way the campaign was being run.
Glenn must decide quickly whether to scale back
his campaign efforts in lowa and divert scarce re
sources to the Southern states that hold primaries
on March 13, where his aides say they believe he has
the best chance of stopping former Vice President
Walter Mondale, now the clear frontrunner for the

Yosemite windstorm kills one

No other injuries were reported.
In Southern California, winds knocked out electri
cal power to more than 40,000 customers in Los An
geles and Orange counties, flipped two trucks and a
private plane and fanned three brush fires.
The National Park Service closed Yosemite to in
coming traffic and advised 700 overnight guests to

from the winds as a precaution, Ms. Dapprich said.
About residents were isolated in Pinecrest by

Union ban provokes uproar
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
\esterday that a controversial decision ordering
employees at Britain's top-secret signal intelligence
agency known as Government Communication
Headquarters to give up their membership in labor
unions was "absolutely vital for the security of this
country."
The decision, announced Wednesday, provoked
an uproar among union leaders and opposition
politicians who claimed that Thatcher had acted un
der pressure from the United States with which Brit
ain closely cooperates on intelligence matters. At
the instigation of the Reagan administration, Britain
agreed last summer to begin using lie-detectors to
improve security at intelligence facilities.
Labor leader Neil Kinnock said the latest
"shameful and shamefaced" move is "just another
pathetic example" of Thatcher's willingness to
"surrender British interests to American pressure."
"There was no American intervention of any kind
in this decision," Thatcher angrily retorted. The or
der against unions, she said, was intended to
protected highly activities against work stoppages,
such as took place in 1981.
An estimated 10,000 people work at the Govern
ment Communications Headquarters compound at
Cheltenham, about 80 miles from London, and in
outposts around the world. They monitor and evalu
ate radio signals and other electronic intelligence in
collaboration with the U.S. National Security
Agency.
About 60 percent of the British employees are
thought to be members of civil service unions. For
about five months in 1981, there was sporadic labor
trouble among GCHQ employees which, according
to a report in Thursday's London Times affected
"routine intelligence gathering."
In 1982, Geoffrey Prime, a long-time Russian lan
guage specialist in the agency was convicted of
spying for the Soviets, which caused serious con
cern among American officials about the level of se
curity there. This led directly to the introduction of a
program to use lie detectors in security checks after
a government commission agreed with U.S. officials

that the polygraph might have deterred Prime.
Union spokesmen yesterday acknowledged that
their objections to the plan may well have led to
Thatcher's decision to ban unions. The government
offered to pay each employee $1400 in return for
leaving the union and ottered to transfer any em
ployee who chose that option instead.
The unions' umbrella organization, the Trades
Union Congress, protested the government action,
saying that the decision had been taken without
prior consultation and threatened the rights of
union membership throughout government.
Progress in Hong Kong talks
Peking — A broad agreement on the future of the
British crown colony of Hong Kong as an autono
mous, capital»sh enclave within China appears to be
emerging from the most recent negotiations be
tween London and Peking.
British and Chinese negotiators, who ended their
eighth formal two-day session yesterday and
pronounced it "usetul and constructive," are
gradually fashioning an agreement that returns
Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997, lays out a se
ries of transitional measures that London will
beforehand and elaborates Peking's promises of
self-government afterward.
A joint Sino-British statement outlining the agree
ment is expected this summer, perhaps as early as
late spring, according to Western diplomats who fol
low the negotiations here closely, and further talks
are then likely on details of the complex transition.
Chinese Communist Party Ceneral Secretary Hu
Yaobang, praising the progress in the negotiations
after a lengthy deadlock, said this week, "it appears
possible to reach an acceptable solution for both
parties, China and Britain, since the negotiations
have been going on smoothly.''
"More time is needed, of course, to take care of
the details ," Hu added, but the agreement now
envisioned will meet the "fundamental interests of
both China and Britain."
Premier Zhao Ziyang, in response to questions in
the United States and Canada during his visits there
this month, also predicted an agreement soon on
Hong Kong's transition from a British colony to
status as a "special administrative region" of China
with self-government, a free-market economy and a
social system that would still have horse racing, dis
cotheques, X-rated films and opposition
newspapers.

have been going on smoothly.''
"More time is needed, of course, to take care of
the details ," Hu added, but the agreement now
envisioned will meet the "fundamental interests of
both China and Britain."
Premier Zhao Ziyang, in response to questions in
the United States and Canada during his visits there
this month, also predicted an agreement soon on
Hong Kong's transition from a British colony to
status as a "special administrative region" of China
with self-government, a free-market economy and a
social system that would still have horse racing, dis
cotheques, X-rated films and opposition
newspapers.
' When I say that I am optimistic about a solution
of the Hong Kong question," Zhao said in Canada,
this is not casual talk. There is ground tor me to say
so."
British officials have been more restrained, con
fining themselves publicly to noting that the
negotiations have moved into "a more detailed
phase" in the past three months and that progress is
being made.
Yet they also seem more optimistic than before
that a basic agreement can be concluded this year
and that, with this underpinning, detailed arrange
ments for a smooth transition can be worked out.
