Rowing for dollars
Women's crew team members Ivy Li (left) and Ginny Eberly take their 20-minute shift in the team's
fund-raising Row-a-thon, which began yesterday in White Plaza. The team hopes to better last year's
1271-mile record and raise more than $5000 in its 24-hour effort. Each member will contribute 80
minutes, broken down into four shifts.
