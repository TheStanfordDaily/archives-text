# ASSU to open temporary job center
## 
### BING TSO 
A temporary student employment center that will
help students locate small-scale, one-time only jobs for
University faculty and staff is schedu dto begin opera
tion next week, according to Council of Presidents
(COP) member Pete Spivack.
The ASSU-run center will cater to the needs of both
the students and University departments alike. Faculty
members and staff will submit job descriptions — work
ranging from filing, typing, moving boxes and other
assorted clerical work to gardening and babysitting for
faculty members — which will then be matched up with
qualified applicants by the employment center's staff.
"I think the center will be a real asset to the Univer
sity," said sophomore Donna Norton, who is co
directing the center with freshman B.C. Porter. " The
departments will have access to high-quality workers
and we will be charging far less than comparable tem
porary employment agencies. It will benefit everyone
involved."
Spivack said one of the advantages of the temporary
employment program is that "there is no commitment
by the applicants — if they don't want to work at a cer
tain time, they don't have to." It provides, in other
words, a convenient and accessible alternative to find
ing a part-time job off-campus or through the Finan
cial Aids Office.

Potential conflict with the University aid programs
has been a major concern of the ASSU organizers. After
meeting with Director of Financial Aids Robert Huff last
quarter, the two groups defined the new employment
program's parameters.
"Any job requiring less than 60 hours of work a quar
ter falls under our jurisdiction," Spivack said.
Norton said that when the ASSU sent letters to
various University departments fall quarter, "we got a
very positive response which designated a very great
need for this sort of program."
Representatives from the center will be in White
Plaza from Feb. 1 through Feb. 3 to provide applications
to interested students.
"The forms will then be filed alphabetically by skill,"
Spivack said. "We will use a rotation system — calling
people on down the list until someone accepts the job.
Hopefully, all of the applicants will receive an offer at
one time or another."
Students receiving work from the center will be paid
according to the University pay scale, which runs from
minimum wage on up, depending on the skill require
ments and the difficulty level of the particular task. The
University departments themselves will pay the stu
dents directly. In addition, departments and faculty
