# Former law student
## Grad wins Marshall award 
### TINA-MARIE BASKIN Staff writer 
The Marshall scholarship presents "a wonderful op
portunity" that "will allow me to spend two years learn
ing about the law — reading, writing and thinking,"
said Michael Klarman, a 1983 Stanford Law School
graduate who recently became the 24th Stanford stu
dent to receive the award.
"Since I want to go into teaching law, this experience
will be very useful for my career," Klarman said. "I can
convert the research that I do into possible courses that
I could offer as a law professor."
Klarman said there is also "the non-academic side"
to the Marshall.
"I will get to meet people from all over the country. I
will be able to travel and learn more about other
cultures and contrast what I learn with things that we
take for granted in our culture."
The scholarships, worth more than $10,000 anually,
were established in 1953 as an expression of gratitude
for the European Recovery Program instituted by
former Secretary of State George Marshall. They are
awarded to U.S. citizens who have graduated from col
lege for at least two years study at a British university.
Klarman said he intends to study legal theory and
jurisprudence at either Oxford or the University of
Kent.
"Oxford is my first choice," Klarman said, "but I
have to submit a proposal to the university like
everybody else. I want to study the historical evolution

of British law and compare it to U.S. law. I'm interested
in the socio-economic forces of law in society."
klarman is currently a law clerk to Ruth Bader
Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit. While participating in the four-year
Bachelor of Arts-Master of Arts program at the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa
during his junior year. He holds a master's degree in
political philosophy.
Klarman attended Stanford Law School from 1980 to
198 *, where he was elected to the Order of the Coif. He
was senior articles and symposium editor of The Stan
ford Law Review and won the Hilmer Oehlmann, )r.
prize for excellence in legal research and writing. He
also received the Urban A. Sontheimer prize for
graduating second in his class.
Klarman said his initial career choice was to teach po
litical philosophy, "but I was influenced by one of my
college professors who told me that there were really
no positions open in my area of interest. You can say
that my attending law school was more for practical
reasons rather than a childhood dream."
Klarman said he feels that he did the right thing.
"Stanford Law School is a great place. The faculty is
outstanding and very interested and supportive of their
students.
"My job puts me in contact with people who have
gone to law schools from all over the United States.
Reflecting back on my experience, I found it as good if
not better than any place else in the country.
