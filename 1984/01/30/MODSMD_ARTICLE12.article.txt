## The 						Stanford Daily Editor's introduction 
### 
The great thing about newspapers is that they
are a reflection of life. From the printed word
one can learn of the world around him — not
just about news events, but about lifestyles,
views and questions that one may never have
known about before. It is a source of informa
tion that one should scour and critique individu
ally and then discuss with others.
The role of the newspaper u surprisingly
similar to that of another institution with
which we are all familiar: the university. Both
seek out knowledge, ask questions and try to ed
ucate. At first, the two may seem to make
strange companions, but as students working on
a college newspaper, we have found them to be
quite complementary.
In the coming months we will do our best to
continue this mission on the pages of The Daily.
We are committed to the pursuit of accurate,
responsible reporting in our stories, thought
provoking editorials and columns, an open forum
of viewpoints and letters, and interesting, wide
ranging coverage in our entertainment and
sports departments.
Most of all we will remain dedicated. We
know mistakes will happen. We know some of
you will become angered at times by what you
read. An event in which you were involved may
not have been covered or maybe we had to cut
some of the letter you wrote in. But always our
goal will be the same as we take into the class

room — to keep striving to do the best we can
as we learn during our time here.
Throughout the coming months we hope to
continue to improve The Daily and keep it as
well respected as it is. We intend to stress
writing quality in all our departments because
training is just as important to us as is the pro
duct we put out each day. This development obvi
ously won't be instantly noticeable to you. but
we hope that it will be by the time the volume
ends in June.
There will be some changes you will notice,
however. The paper has a bit of a new look which
we believe will make it easier to read. Our
Update news briefs have moved to page 2,
where you can expect to find consistent
coverage of national and international news
everyday. And we're adding some new fun to
The Daily — including the Bloom County comic
strip.
As always we are looking for anyone inter
ested in helping us. If you've always wanted to
write or work on a paper, try us out. If some
thing has you all riled up, drop us a letter or a
viewpoint. And please, if you see possible news
stories occurring, give us a call. We're excited
about our job and we hope you will be enthusias
tic readers, too.
