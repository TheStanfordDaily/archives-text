Numerous surveys having
proclaimed Stanford to be the best
university in the world. President
Donald Kennedy decided that his
mission was accomplished and, like
Alexander, looked for other worlds
to conquer. The occasion arose when,
on the insistent advice of his doctors,
Senator Alan Cranston, exhausted
from jogging around the country
endlessly in search of the presidency,
unwillingly withdrew from political

life.
Everyone agreed that Donald Ken
nedy was the best choice to succeed
him. Jogging to an easy victory, our
new senator quickly established him
self as a leading candidate for the
presidency. Vice President Bush was
the Republican choice, but a New
York Times reporter discovered that
one of his secretaries had been using
the government frank for personal
correspondence, and he was forced to
withdraw, covered with ignominy. In
stead of occupying the White House,
he found it difficult even to rent an
apartment.
"Don Kennedy for President!" was
the cry across the nation, and the
Republicans suffered a humiliating
defeat. One unforeseen result was an
exodus of Stanford faculty members
to join the new Washington team.
Political Science was reduced to one
professor, the History Department
was halved and all the staff of
Memorial Church went to give the
new administration its benisons. En
glish and anthropology also suffered
serious losses.
As a result of this emigration, the
Republicans regained control of the
University. The results were soon ap
parent. A fundamentalist preacher
was appointed dean of the Chapel.
His sermons calling on Stanford fac
ulty and students to repent their sins
were viewed as an infringement on

their rights and an unfortunate
departure from denunciations of
President Reagan and his friends.
Attendance dropped off sharply, so a
guru was appointed. Students eager
to learn how to levitate flocked to
hear him. Since Stanford always rises
to the top, they learned quickly, and
they were soon clinging to the roof
like a cave full of bats. It was an ex
traordinary sight which attracted ad
miring crowds.
Meanwhile in Washington Presi
dent Kennedy was, with his renowned
administrative skill, solving problems
which had plagued the government
for generations, such as the relations
between the White House and the
Capitol. Kennedy solved this problem
by jogging to and from the Capitol
every morning, followed by sweating
Stanford ex-faculty members. On
the left sidewalk the Mem Clui team
was lined up, their left hands raised
in blessing.
This was the golden age of Ameri
can politics. Even Republicans were
sorry when Kennedy's second term
was up. He returned to the Stanford
campus with his team. They had for
gotten how to teach, lost touch with
their subject, and, in any case, two
years is the maximum leave of ab
sence. They had indeed more urgent
things to do: to write their memoirs
and to help Kennedy establish the
Kennedy (Stanford) Presidential
Complex. "Stanford" was added be
cause everyone kept confusing the
Stanford center with the Kennedy
complex at the Stanford of the East.
The new complex was the brightest
jewel in the Stanford's crown, and, at
Kennedy's insistence, it was subject
to normal academic governance, com
monly known as NAG. However, now
the University was controlled by
Republicans, who resented the com
plex. Moreover, faculty members suc
cumb easily to the worst of the seven
deadly sins, namely envy, and they
used every possible device afforded

by NAG to block Kennedy's plans.
Since the Republicans regained con
trol of the University, students had
been quietly indoctrinated with con
servative thought, and in any case
they always resent authority on prin
ciple. They began writing nasty let
ters to the Stanford Daily and
holding demonstrations outside the
complex; some even threatened to
attack it and break the windows.
Kennedy's patience was proverbial,
but week after week he was the vic
tim of NAG. Committees blocked
appointments and projects. Depart
ments voted that the complex did
not properly belong in Stanford, and
the Faculty Senate rang with
denunciations of it. It is amazing how
NAG can be used to wreck the most
important projects which are not
within the departmental framework
The wreckers feel a sense of superior
virtue, although they are following
the injunction of Goethe's Mephis
topheles: "Alles was entsteht, is wert,
das es zugrunde geht," i.e., destroy
anything worthwhile.
Finally, Kennedy's cup flowed over.
He summoned the members of his
complex and said, "NAG, NAG,
NAG! I can't take it anymore!" His
colleagues said they were equally in
furiated. So he wrote a letter to the
president of the University (copy to
the chairman of the Board of Trus
tees). It said curtly "We disaf
filiate." Fortunately the three
individuals involved were all basically
reasonable men. so they got together
and worked out a compromise. For $1
a year the University rented the
complex a 100-acre prime site in the
hills. The view was superb, the air
clear, the trees and birds gave the
complexers a welcome which was
renewed every day. Looking down on
the University, the staff members
said, "Good Lord! Are we glad we got
out of that mess!"

him. Jogging to an easy victory, our
new senator quickly established him
self as a leading candidate for the
presidency. Vice President Bush was
the Republican choice, but a New
York Times reporter discovered that
one of his secretaries had been using
the government frank for personal
correspondence, and he was forced to
withdraw, covered with ignominy. In
stead of occupying the White House,
he found it difficult even to rent an
apartment.
"Don Kennedy for President!" was
the cry across the nation, and the
Republicans suffered a humiliating
defeat. One unforeseen result was an
exodus of Stanford faculty members
to join the new Washington team.
Political Science was reduced to one
professor, the History Department
was halved and all the staff of
Memorial Church went to give the
new administration its benisons. En
glish and anthropology also suffered
serious losses.
As a result of this emigration, the
Republicans regained control of the
University. The results were soon ap
parent. A fundamentalist preacher
was appointed dean of the Chapel.
His sermons calling on Stanford fac
ulty and students to repent their sins
were viewed as an infringement on

their rights and an unfortunate
departure from denunciations of
President Reagan and his friends.
Attendance dropped off sharply, so a
guru was appointed. Students eager
to learn how to levitate flocked to
hear him. Since Stanford always rises
to the top, they learned quickly, and
they were soon clinging to the roof
like a cave full of bats. It was an ex
traordinary sight which attracted ad
miring crowds.
Meanwhile in Washington Presi
dent Kennedy was, with his renowned
administrative skill, solving problems
which had plagued the government
for generations, such as the relations
between the White House and the
Capitol. Kennedy solved this problem
by jogging to and from the Capitol
every morning, followed by sweating
Stanford ex-faculty members. On
the left sidewalk the Mem Clui team
was lined up, their left hands raised
in blessing.
This was the golden age of Ameri
can politics. Even Republicans were
sorry when Kennedy's second term
was up. He returned to the Stanford
campus with his team. They had for
gotten how to teach, lost touch with
their subject, and, in any case, two
years is the maximum leave of ab
sence. They had indeed more urgent
things to do: to write their memoirs
and to help Kennedy establish the
Kennedy (Stanford) Presidential
Complex. "Stanford" was added be
cause everyone kept confusing the
Stanford center with the Kennedy
complex at the Stanford of the East.
The new complex was the brightest
jewel in the Stanford's crown, and, at
Kennedy's insistence, it was subject
to normal academic governance, com
monly known as NAG. However, now
the University was controlled by
Republicans, who resented the com
plex. Moreover, faculty members suc
cumb easily to the worst of the seven
deadly sins, namely envy, and they
used every possible device afforded

by NAG to block Kennedy's plans.
Since the Republicans regained con
trol of the University, students had
been quietly indoctrinated with con
servative thought, and in any case
they always resent authority on prin
ciple. They began writing nasty let
ters to the Stanford Daily and
holding demonstrations outside the
complex; some even threatened to
attack it and break the windows.
Kennedy's patience was proverbial,
but week after week he was the vic
tim of NAG. Committees blocked
appointments and projects. Depart
ments voted that the complex did
not properly belong in Stanford, and
the Faculty Senate rang with
denunciations of it. It is amazing how
NAG can be used to wreck the most
important projects which are not
within the departmental framework
The wreckers feel a sense of superior
virtue, although they are following
the injunction of Goethe's Mephis
topheles: "Alles was entsteht, is wert,
das es zugrunde geht," i.e., destroy
anything worthwhile.
Finally, Kennedy's cup flowed over.
He summoned the members of his
complex and said, "NAG, NAG,
NAG! I can't take it anymore!" His
colleagues said they were equally in
furiated. So he wrote a letter to the
president of the University (copy to
the chairman of the Board of Trus
tees). It said curtly "We disaf
filiate." Fortunately the three
individuals involved were all basically
reasonable men. so they got together
and worked out a compromise. For $1
a year the University rented the
complex a 100-acre prime site in the
hills. The view was superb, the air
clear, the trees and birds gave the
complexers a welcome which was
renewed every day. Looking down on
the University, the staff members
said, "Good Lord! Are we glad we got
out of that mess!"

Numerous surveys having
proclaimed Stanford to be the best
university in the world. President
Donald Kennedy decided that his
mission was accomplished and, like
Alexander, looked for other worlds
to conquer. The occasion arose when,
on the insistent advice of his doctors,
Senator Alan Cranston, exhausted
from jogging around the country
endlessly in search of the presidency,
unwillingly withdrew from political
