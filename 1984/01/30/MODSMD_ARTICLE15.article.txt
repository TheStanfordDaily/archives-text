# Court makeup at stake

Question: What vital outcome of
the 1984 presidential election has
the potential to determine how the
American public leads its life for the
next 25 years, yet will not be an issue
during the campaign?
Answer Control of Supreme Court
appointments.
The decisions of the Supreme
Court affect almost every aspect of
American life, and are often the
vehicles of major social reform where
legislative and executive solutions
have failed. In the past three
decades, the court has had a fairly ac-

Supreme Court appointments give a president an
opportunity to shape American life in his image
for years after he has left office, as justices are
appointed for life. With some notable exceptions,
justices are usually appointed who espouse the
same philosophy and ideals as the president who
appointed them, and can thus make the
president's views carry weight many
administrations later.

' tivist philosophy which has led to
decisions to desegregate schools
(Brown v. Board of Education, 1954,
1955), guarantee the right to attor
ney (Miranda v. Arizona, 1966) and of
fer pregnant women the right to an
abortion (Roe v. Wade, 1973). Rulings
such as these set the national agenda
and are often the most progressive
and effective force in mainstream
American policymaking.
Supreme Court appointments give

are appointed for life. With som£
notable exceptions, justices are
usually appointed who espouse the
same philosophy and ideals as the
president who appointed them, and
can thus make the president's views
carry weight many administrations
later. Often justices appointed
become better known or have more
impact than the president who put
them on the bench: The presidency
of John Adams was undistinguished,
yet his appointee, Chief Justice John
Marshall, is considered the father of
the American justice system and
originator of the concept of judicial
review.
The winner of the 1984 presiden-

tial election can reasonably expect to
appoint at least three and maybe
four justices to the court, clearly
pushing the nine-member panel in
one ideological direction. By Novem
ber of 1984, Associate Justice
William Brennan, an Eisenhower ap
pointee and the court's elder states
man, will be 78 years old and unlikely
to stay on the bench for four more
years. Associate Justices Thurgood
Marshall and Lewis Powell are both
over 75 and are barely effective in
their duties now. Chief Justice War
ren Burger, a Nixon man, is also

rumored to be considering retire
ment. and a friendly administration
(such as a second Reagan term) would
probably make up his mind. In fact,
depending on the political climate in
the upcoming months, both Burger
and Powell might retire to allow
Reagan to appoint their successors if
it seems unlikely that he will win the
election.
The ideological makeup of the
court has shifted more to the right
in the past 15 years since the heyday
of the Earl Warren court, and because
its two most liberal members, Mar
shall and Brennan, are also two of its
oldest members, it could shift fur
ther in the future. The two youngest
justices, Sandra Day O'Connor (53)
and William Rehnq'iist (59), are the
most conservative, and will be around
for years to come. A Democratic
president in 1984 would merely
preserve the balance between the
liberal-moderate and conservative
wings of the court; under a second
Reagan term, if the two liberals Mar
shall and Brennan leave, the court
would shift overwhelmingly away
from an activist stance, with a
majority of the conservative justices
being likely to remain on the bench
for some time.

Former President Jimmy Carter
did not have a chance to appoint any
Supreme Court justices. The retire
ment of moderate Potter Stewart
gave Ronald Reagan a chance to
place the first woman, Sandra Day
O'Connor, on the high court, and she
appears to be towing the conserva
tive line as expected. The fragile bal
ance between progressive and
regressive forces on the court has
already been tilted in the wrong di
rection, and could get worse with one
or two Reagan appointments; three
or four justices in the Reagan tradi
tion would give the court the ability
to wipe away years of progress in civil
rights, press freedoms, individual
liberties and Miranda rights, and give
the upper hand to those in society
who favor prayer in school, outlawing
abortion, tax breaks for schools
which discriminate and a tight rein on
the nation's press.
Who is the most likely candidate
for Reagan's next appointment,
should he get one? The leading can
didate is District of Columbia Cir
cuit Judge Robert Bork, a relatively
young, extremely intelligent strict
constructionist. A former Yale Law
School professor, he was a Reagan
appointment to the Appeals Court,
and he could be counted on to be
faithful to the president's ideas and
ideals. In his decisions and writings,
he has consistently taken the reac
tionary, restrictive line; this trait is
made more menacing by his great in
tellect and well-written arguments.
Others in the Bork mold are former
University of Chicago law professors
Aritonin Scalia and Richard Posner.
both appointed to the Federal Court
of Appeals by Reagan.
Thus the 1984 elections assume
even more than usual importance: a
Reagan win would mean not only
four m< r e years of indifference to
the plig.u of the poor, minorities and
homeless, but also decades of reac
tionary Supreme Court decisions
that could erase all the hard-earned
progress of the past 30 years. It is
imperative to realize what is at
stake: An issue which will not even be

dates this fall will determine how you

tial election can reasonably expect to
appoint at least three and maybe
four justices to the court, clearly
pushing the nine-member panel in
one ideological direction. By Novem
ber of 1984, Associate Justice
William Brennan, an Eisenhower ap
pointee and the court's elder states
man, will be 78 years old and unlikely
to stay on the bench for four more
years. Associate Justices Thurgood
Marshall and Lewis Powell are both
over 75 and are barely effective in
their duties now. Chief Justice War
ren Burger, a Nixon man, is also

rumored to be considering retire
ment. and a friendly administration
(such as a second Reagan term) would
probably make up his mind. In fact,
depending on the political climate in
the upcoming months, both Burger
and Powell might retire to allow
Reagan to appoint their successors if
it seems unlikely that he will win the
election.
The ideological makeup of the
court has shifted more to the right
in the past 15 years since the heyday
of the Earl Warren court, and because
its two most liberal members, Mar
shall and Brennan, are also two of its
oldest members, it could shift fur
ther in the future. The two youngest
justices, Sandra Day O'Connor (53)
and William Rehnq'iist (59), are the
most conservative, and will be around
for years to come. A Democratic
president in 1984 would merely
preserve the balance between the
liberal-moderate and conservative
wings of the court; under a second
Reagan term, if the two liberals Mar
shall and Brennan leave, the court
would shift overwhelmingly away
from an activist stance, with a
majority of the conservative justices
being likely to remain on the bench
for some time.

Former President Jimmy Carter
did not have a chance to appoint any
Supreme Court justices. The retire
ment of moderate Potter Stewart
gave Ronald Reagan a chance to
place the first woman, Sandra Day
O'Connor, on the high court, and she
appears to be towing the conserva
tive line as expected. The fragile bal
ance between progressive and
regressive forces on the court has
already been tilted in the wrong di
rection, and could get worse with one
or two Reagan appointments; three
or four justices in the Reagan tradi
tion would give the court the ability
to wipe away years of progress in civil
rights, press freedoms, individual
liberties and Miranda rights, and give
the upper hand to those in society
who favor prayer in school, outlawing
abortion, tax breaks for schools
which discriminate and a tight rein on
the nation's press.
Who is the most likely candidate
for Reagan's next appointment,
should he get one? The leading can
didate is District of Columbia Cir
cuit Judge Robert Bork, a relatively
young, extremely intelligent strict
constructionist. A former Yale Law
School professor, he was a Reagan
appointment to the Appeals Court,
and he could be counted on to be
faithful to the president's ideas and
ideals. In his decisions and writings,
he has consistently taken the reac
tionary, restrictive line; this trait is
made more menacing by his great in
tellect and well-written arguments.
Others in the Bork mold are former
University of Chicago law professors
Aritonin Scalia and Richard Posner.
both appointed to the Federal Court
of Appeals by Reagan.
Thus the 1984 elections assume
even more than usual importance: a
Reagan win would mean not only
four m< r e years of indifference to
the plig.u of the poor, minorities and
homeless, but also decades of reac
tionary Supreme Court decisions
that could erase all the hard-earned
progress of the past 30 years. It is
imperative to realize what is at
stake: An issue which will not even be
mentioned by either of the candi
dates this fall will determine how you
and 1 live for the majority of our
lives.

American life, and are often the

legislative and executive solutions
have failed. In the past three
decades, the court has had a fairly ac-

Supreme Court appointments give a president an
opportunity to shape American life in his image
for years after he has left office, as justices are
appointed for life. With some notable exceptions,
justices are usually appointed who espouse the
same philosophy and ideals as the president who
appointed them, and can thus make the
president's views carry weight many
administrations later.

decisions to desegregate schools
(Brown v. Board of Education, 1954,
1955), guarantee the right to attor

abortion (Roe v. Wade, 1973). Rulings
such as these set the national agenda
and are often the most progressive
and effective force in mainstream
American policymaking.
