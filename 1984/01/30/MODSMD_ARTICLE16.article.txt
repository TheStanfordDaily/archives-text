## Portrayal of liberals both unfair and inaccurate 
### 
I am deeply offended by Michael Henry
Olvera's pompous reactionary meanderings in
"Our liberal institutions" (Daily. Jan. 24). Up
until now, 1 have remained passive each time we
have been subjected to his interesting exercises
in "creative logic," but the complete lack of
empirical support for his arguments evident in
the column inspired me to at least bring some
facts to bear on the issues he wrote about.
He states that great universities are ruled by
liberal factions. Which great universities?
Certainly not Stanford, great as it is. A sam
pling of student and faculty opinions would
make this obvious to Olvera.
He asserts that liberals are anti-intellectual,
and that our predecessors at Stanford believed
that "intellectualism is . . . antithetical to
common sense." 1 find it hard to believe that
anyboi would make such a ridiculous generaliza
tion. 1 s a generalization that belittles the
blood, s.veat and ingenuity spent b\ people like
David Harris in their efforts to rationally
promote social change.
Olvera goes on to declare that the Grenada
story is cleare. now > all of us. Well, it isn't
clearer to those of us from the "moronic school
of thought," and petitions sent to the presi
dent are not "propaganda."
I didn't overlook Olvera's attack on Profes
sors John Manley and Ronald Rebholz. Arguing
that they are trying to prevent conservatives
from reaping "the awards of great scholarship"
is simply not based on any factual support.
Olvera makes false assumptions when he

concludes that liberals are "patriot-baiting" and
that the welfare state is "coercive" and inhibits
the attainment of a more efficient economy
(which he fails to outline).
Finally, I feel compelled to point out that the
"good Christian values" which Olvera argues are
a part of "our heritage" did not originate solely
in what he would classify as "religious" ideals.
No, liberals are not "phobic," but wc do worry
when we think that people like Olvera, who
show no hesitation in using the legitimacy of a
newspaper column to spread their unsupported
prejudices, will someday be in positions of
relative power.

I read with invest and some amusement the
recent commentary on soccer by my colleague.
Prof. Robert Sinclair (Daily, Jan. 23). In the
article Sinclair expressed his views on T he
influence of soccer on the class society of
Britain and on world politics. On these subjects
he is, of course, entitled to his views. I leel it
incumbent upon myself, however, to draw
attention to major (and I believe deliberate)
omissions in his article.
In the introduction it is stated that Liverpool
is regarded by some as the "epicenter of English
Soccer." The only people I have ever met who

Icel this way are those (like Sinclair) who
support Liverpool. The vast majority of the
soccer world reserves such a distinction for the
truly great football team — Manchester
United. Sinclair adds insult to injury at another
point in his article by failing to list Manchester
United as one of a number of key English teams.
This is comparable to ignoring the Ruth
through-Mantlc New York Yankees in a list of
famous baseball teams.
I hose glaring oversights are, sadly, not
uncommon in opinions expressed on soccer by
Liverpudlians (a name by which they apparently
like to be known). This attitude is due to a
deep-seated envy arising from the fact that in
196K Manchester United became the first
English team to win the European Cup — the
super-super bowl of European soccer. This took
place, incidentally, at a time when Liverpool had
a relatively nondescript team. Liverpudlians
have chosen not to face the issue of having had
a second-rate team at a crucial time in English
soccer history. Rather, in a manner resembling
the ostrich that buries its head in the sand, they
pretend that the enemy, in this case Manchester
United, does not exist.
Although the Liverpool team has fared
somewhat better since its undistinguished
period, it is still Manchester United that is
quite correctly regarded by the international
soccer community as the "epicenter" of English
soccer.

truly great football team — Manchester
United. Sinclair adds insult to injury at another
point in his article by failing to list Manchester
United as one of a number of key English teams.
This is comparable to ignoring the Ruth
through-Mantlc New York Yankees in a list of
famous baseball teams.
I hose glaring oversights are, sadly, not
uncommon in opinions expressed on soccer by
Liverpudlians (a name by which they apparently
like to be known). This attitude is due to a
deep-seated envy arising from the fact that in
196K Manchester United became the first
English team to win the European Cup — the
super-super bowl of European soccer. This took
place, incidentally, at a time when Liverpool had
a relatively nondescript team. Liverpudlians
have chosen not to face the issue of having had
a second-rate team at a crucial time in English
soccer history. Rather, in a manner resembling
the ostrich that buries its head in the sand, they
pretend that the enemy, in this case Manchester
United, does not exist.
Although the Liverpool team has fared
somewhat better since its undistinguished
period, it is still Manchester United that is
quite correctly regarded by the international
soccer community as the "epicenter" of English
soccer.
