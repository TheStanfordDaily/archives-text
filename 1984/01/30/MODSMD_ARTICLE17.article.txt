## Big Way paddles into some serious waters 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
The latest corporate
recruiters in White Plaza drove
up in a van, unloaded potted
palm trees and hired all who ap
plied. These recruiters, though,
weren't from Hewlett-
Packard.
It was Club Big Way and its
leaders, Bob Levy and Brian
Mariscal, want to do to tennis,
polo and even charity what
they have already done to the
rubber raft.
Club Big Way began two
years ago as the Big Way Yacht
Club, making Stanford perhaps
the only university to have
both financial aid and a yacht
ing society. Levy and Mariscal
sold memberships which en
titled buyers to parties and
also sold rubber yachts to
serious members. Hundreds of
students took to spending
spring quarter floating on the
lake.
But the club revised its name
this year, and the change is
more than cosmetic.
The most dramatic change
from the old "float on the lake
and drink beer" policy is a new
emphasis on getting large
groups of students involved in
the planning and execution of
the club's ideas. Dorm repre
sentatives have been assigned
and a band of sales representa
tives is forming.
The principal goal of the
group, beyond providing fun,
will be the formation of an en
dowment fund which will be
used to aid local children's
centers. "We wanted to do

something for people other
than just ourselves," explained
Mariscal. "Otherwise it just
looks like a bunch of hedonists
on the lake."
"We'll be raising money here
at Stanford and we hope to
raise somewhere over $5000,"
said Levy. He explained that
the club will attempt to get at
least 20 companies to donate
matching funds which would
bring the endowment up to
around $100,000.
Heather Purcell, who will be
heading up the sales force of
15 to 20 students, said that "in
the past the club was fun but
not something I'd like to
devote a lot of time to. But
now that we are doing it for
something other than our
selves, people are being a lot
more receptive. It seems like
it's going to be pretty easy to
get the companies on our side."
The biggest source of reve
nue at Stanford will likely
come from sales of Big Way's
unique inventory which Levy
explained was amassed "after
long and serious research at
many toy companies through
out the country."
Sporting a small rubber raft
on his head. Levy described his
products. "The Rolls Royce of
the fleet will be a clear vinyl
two-person yacht with a silver
bottom for ultimate suntan
ning." Floating lounge chairs,
beach towels, and jackets will
be sold. According to Levy, the
most innovative new line this
year is the bathtubs, popularly
known as wading pools. "They
will put all bath and tennis

clubs to shame," saÂ»d Levy.
"We want Stanford stu
dents to see things in a differ
ent way," said Mariscal.
As he spoke, Mariscal
searched the room for match
ing socks. Dressed in a pinstripe
suit, he hardly looked the Big
Way type. "I'm going to talk
to some companies in San Fran
cisco about the endowment
fund," he explained as he threw
random socks back in the
closet. "You know pretty soon
most of us will be dressing like
this every day,"he said strug
gling with his tie,"and part of
the purpose of Big Way is to
remind all of us that there was
a different side to people back
here."
The events scheduled to
bring out the less serious side
of students this year include a
polo game, to be played on
tricycles, a mixed doubles ten
nis tournament, to be played in
formal attire and possibly with
Teflon pans, and a Madras
Plaid Open golf tournament,
to be played at a challenging,
local miniature golf course.
As Levy flipped through the
schedule, he occasionally
mumbled, "This stuff is out of
hand. I can't believe I'm doing
all of this."
Gone will be parties where
the main entertainment is beer
and hamburgers. "I never con
sidered those very successful
parties," said Levy. "This year
you can do something besides
getting inebriated and sweat
ing like pigs. Every week is a

new curiosity. Curiosity is a
very intrinsic part of human
nature. How can you get
curious about a hamburger?"
The most ambitious project
in the works is called Farmfest
'84, and according to Levy it
will be Stanford's first
homecoming. The two-day af
fair boasts parades, fireworks,
games, golf tournaments, chili
cookoffs and an alumni foot
ball game. With help from the
Athletic Department, Big Way
hopes to get sporting greats
John Brodie and Jim Plunkett
back for the game.

Yearly memberships will be
available this week for $10 and
part of the fee will also go to
the endowment fund. "We
don't want to inhibit people
financially," explained Maris
cal. "The membership doesn't
cover the expenses of the par
ties, but we'll be doing it
through the sponsors."
The ability of Mariscal and
Levy to obtain sponsorships
has been vital to the club. An
heuser Busch is one company
that has sponsored the club
since its beginning. Levy said he
went to talk with the local dis-

tributor two years ago, raft in
hand, and came out with a
check. "They're great to work
with," he said. '"They're giving
us almost anything we want."
For the endowment fund to
work Levy and Mariscai are
relying on other students to be
as successful as themselves at
cracking corporate sponsors.
Sales representatives for the
club will be trained in the Big
Way sales technique at weekly
seminars. "We want people to
be trained in tactics such as
how to get by secretaries
whose main job is to keep you

from seeing the person in
charge," explained Purcell.
Since the beginning Big Way
has been a non-profit organiza
tion and its entrepreneurial
founders have reaped no finan
cial rewards. However, if the
club does well this year. Levy
said Big Way is "thinking of
going national." Levy envisions
himself and Mariscai cruising
the country in a Partridge
Family-style bus and distribut
ing the "Book of Big Way" to
college campuses everywhere.
"If we could pull that off it
would be great," he said.
