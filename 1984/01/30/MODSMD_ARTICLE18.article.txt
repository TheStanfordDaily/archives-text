"Look! Up in the sky. It's a
bird...no, it's a plane...lt's SU
PERMAN!''
A middle-aged blond leaps
through the air, pointing to
the flying object that made
her scream that sentence.
A man follows her example,
leaping and pointing, yelling
the same words.
Twenty-two more people
go through the same act.
These 24 men and wo
men did not really see a
flying object in the sky. Nei
ther were they auditioning for
the cast of Superman IV.
They were getting over their
fear of public speaking. And
the superman antic was exer
cise to help them overcome
communication inhibitions
during a Saturday workshop
given by Hal Jindrich at Tresid
der Union.
Jindrich, a psychologist
specializing in interpersonal
communications and relation
ships, led the group through
various games and activities as
part of his "synthetic
practice" approach to dissolv
ing the fear of speaking before
groups.
In synthetic practice, an in
dividual exaggerates some
aspect of effective speaking.
When in a real speaking situa
tion, where anxiety is apt to be
higher than in the workshop
environment, the troubled

speaker will, having over
practiced each task, be able to
perform more successfully.
For example, to practice eye
contact with the audience,
each member of the class stares

is too stressful to deal with, he
advised, "don't do it."
However, Jindrich encouraged
them to explain why they felt
the task was threatening.
During a speech drill in which
participants were given a word
to define immediately to the
group, one participant, an
M.D. and host of a radio talk
show, refused the first word
but defined the next.
"Why didn't you define the
first word?" asked Jindrich.
"Because I couldn't,"the
student said.
"Why not?"
"It was too hard."
"Were you worried about
the class' reaction? Or were
you worried about using the
right words in your defini
tion?"
"I was worried that ..."
Thus the root of the
anxieties and inhibitions were
revealed, perhaps for the first
time even to the participants
themselves.
Once a specific problem is
singled out, Jindrich takes the
individual through various ac
tivities to synthetically
practice a task that addresses
that particular difficulty.
An IBM salesman who felt
self-conscious about overusing
his hands while speaking was
told to deliver a short
monologue and to purposely
exaggerate hand motions.
"How many think that was

into another's eyes a foot away
for 30 seconds at a time.
A critical element of these
exercises, Jindrich emphasized
to the class, is that they be
non-threatening. If an activity

too much hand movement?"
the instructor asked the class.
No one moved.
"How many thought that
was just right?"
Twenty-one hands went up.
The point was made.
Not everyone attending the
workshop had such a specific

"anxiety felt before getting up
to speak. If I speak up spon
taneously, I'm okay. It's
knowing I have to get up and
talk in a few minutes that gets
me nervous."
A University facilities
manager expressed an all-too
common worry about audience

'Most people have some question
about self-esteem . . . speaking is the
essence of your self-esteem

difficulty. A contestant for
this year's Miss San Francisco
title wanted to improve her
speaking skills in general.
"They ask you questions on
stage. You have to be organ
ized and articulate in your an
swer. You also have to answer
in the time limit. There's a lot
of pressure," she said.
A Stanford senior said he at
tended the workshop because
he wanted to get rid of the

reaction when he said, "You
don't know if they're going to
throw rocks at you, or what
the heck."
After a few hours of activi
ties aimed at improving general
speaking poise, the class
practiced giving effective argu
ments, introductions and
farewell speeches.
Between games and exercises
which took up most of the
seven-hour workshop, Jindrich
stressed to his students the im

portance of effective commu
nication in everyday life.
"Most people have some
question about self-esteem."
he said. "Talking and speaking
is the essence of your self
esteem . . . When you speak
well, you generalize. That is,
you feel well about yourself in
genera], even in situations
when you don'l communicate
much."
"Did you know it's the
speakers who rule the world?"
Jindrich asked the class.
Speakers can write down
what they say, Jindrich said,
but "not every writer can voice
what he writes."
Though the workshop may
not produce prize-winning
orators, participants felt an
improvement in their speaking
abilities.
"My heart still pounds when
I get up to talk, but I feel a lot
more confident than 1 did
when I first walked in here this
morning," said a Stanford
Business School student.
No miracles, but it's a good
start.

"Look! Up in the sky. It's a
bird...no, it's a plane...lt's SU
PERMAN!''
A middle-aged blond leaps
through the air, pointing to
the flying object that made
her scream that sentence.
A man follows her example,
leaping and pointing, yelling
the same words.
Twenty-two more people
go through the same act.
These 24 men and wo
men did not really see a
flying object in the sky. Nei
ther were they auditioning for
the cast of Superman IV.
They were getting over their
fear of public speaking. And
the superman antic was exer
cise to help them overcome
communication inhibitions
during a Saturday workshop
given by Hal Jindrich at Tresid
der Union.
Jindrich, a psychologist
specializing in interpersonal
communications and relation
ships, led the group through
various games and activities as
part of his "synthetic
practice" approach to dissolv
ing the fear of speaking before
groups.
In synthetic practice, an in
dividual exaggerates some
aspect of effective speaking.
When in a real speaking situa
tion, where anxiety is apt to be
higher than in the workshop
environment, the troubled

speaker will, having over
practiced each task, be able to
perform more successfully.
For example, to practice eye
contact with the audience,
each member of the class stares

is too stressful to deal with, he
advised, "don't do it."
However, Jindrich encouraged
them to explain why they felt
the task was threatening.
During a speech drill in which
participants were given a word
to define immediately to the
group, one participant, an
M.D. and host of a radio talk
show, refused the first word
but defined the next.
"Why didn't you define the
first word?" asked Jindrich.
"Because I couldn't,"the
student said.
"Why not?"
"It was too hard."
"Were you worried about
the class' reaction? Or were
you worried about using the
right words in your defini
tion?"
"I was worried that ..."
Thus the root of the
anxieties and inhibitions were
revealed, perhaps for the first
time even to the participants
themselves.
Once a specific problem is
singled out, Jindrich takes the
individual through various ac
tivities to synthetically
practice a task that addresses
that particular difficulty.
An IBM salesman who felt
self-conscious about overusing
his hands while speaking was
told to deliver a short
monologue and to purposely
exaggerate hand motions.
"How many think that was

into another's eyes a foot away
for 30 seconds at a time.
A critical element of these
exercises, Jindrich emphasized
to the class, is that they be
non-threatening. If an activity

too much hand movement?"
the instructor asked the class.
No one moved.
"How many thought that
was just right?"
Twenty-one hands went up.
The point was made.
Not everyone attending the
workshop had such a specific

"anxiety felt before getting up
to speak. If I speak up spon
taneously, I'm okay. It's
knowing I have to get up and
talk in a few minutes that gets
me nervous."
A University facilities
manager expressed an all-too
common worry about audience

'Most people have some question
about self-esteem . . . speaking is the
essence of your self-esteem

difficulty. A contestant for
this year's Miss San Francisco
title wanted to improve her
speaking skills in general.
"They ask you questions on
stage. You have to be organ
ized and articulate in your an
swer. You also have to answer
in the time limit. There's a lot
of pressure," she said.
A Stanford senior said he at
tended the workshop because
he wanted to get rid of the

reaction when he said, "You
don't know if they're going to
throw rocks at you, or what
the heck."
After a few hours of activi
ties aimed at improving general
speaking poise, the class
practiced giving effective argu
ments, introductions and
farewell speeches.
Between games and exercises
which took up most of the
seven-hour workshop, Jindrich
stressed to his students the im

portance of effective commu
nication in everyday life.
"Most people have some
question about self-esteem."
he said. "Talking and speaking
is the essence of your self
esteem . . . When you speak
well, you generalize. That is,
you feel well about yourself in
genera], even in situations
when you don'l communicate
much."
"Did you know it's the
speakers who rule the world?"
Jindrich asked the class.
Speakers can write down
what they say, Jindrich said,
but "not every writer can voice
what he writes."
Though the workshop may
not produce prize-winning
orators, participants felt an
improvement in their speaking
abilities.
"My heart still pounds when
I get up to talk, but I feel a lot
more confident than 1 did
when I first walked in here this
morning," said a Stanford
Business School student.
No miracles, but it's a good
start.
