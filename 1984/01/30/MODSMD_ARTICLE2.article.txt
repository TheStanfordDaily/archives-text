# ASSU questions SCOPE money transfer
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The .Stanford fommiWee on. Poli
tical Education *fSCOPE) voted
Friday to transfer all of the group's
money — about $11,000 — to a
Lobby Office political conference to
be held in April.
All 12 of the students who voted
in the open Tresidder Union meeting
cast ballots in favor of the transfer.
But some ASSU officials have ques
tioned whether the meeting could be
considered official because most of
the students in attendance were mem
bers of organizations participating in
the Lobby Office conference.
Eric Berg, a member of the ASSU
appropriations committee, said he
has doubts that SCOPE'S decision
will be approved by the ASSU Sen
ate.
"I don't think it is at all assured
that when this (SCOPE's) proposal

comes to the ASSU Senate it will go
through," Berg said. "There might be
.ojfcw ~ . hs i >gs..psk o p'< . ' "v'l! w?r.\ to !eok
at in evaluating Friday's meeting."
But Scott Newar, SCOPE's only
member until Friday, countered that
the meeting was advertised in The
Daily.
"The meeting was open," he said.
"Those who showed up were invited
to vote unrestrictedly."
Berg said he questions the
legitimacy of Friday's meeting.
He noted that John Hoffmire, the
director of the Lobby Office, told
several ASSU officials that he had
asked members of groups involved in
the conference to attend SCOPE's
meeting.
"There was no secret that John
was going to contact people and get
them to come to the meeting," he
said. "John called people from the
Speakers l Bureau and Stanford-in-

Government and other people who
are involved in the conference. John
it cijjr that he was io
contact a number of people from or
ganizations that had been named as
potential aspirants to claims on the
SCOPE money."
But Hoffmire said he also asked
members of groups that are not par
ticipating in the conference to come
to the meeting.
"We had members of basically all
the groups involved in political edu
cation on campus," he said.
Of the 16 students who attended
the meeting, 14 were with organiza
tions that are working on the confer
ence, Hoffmire said.
In Newar's name, Hoffmire bought
space in Friday's Daily for an ad an
nouncing the meeting.
"The ad is being paid for by me,"
Newar said. "SCOPE will reimburse
me once the funds are unfrozen."

"I think the meeting was open and
Newar said. "The people
>>•. v. en, at Lc nkeiing wOdstitUte
the new membership of SCOPE.
Those people are going to participate
in SCOPE and actively participate in
the conference."
SCOPE'S membership had
dwindled to one because the
group had concluded at the end of
spring quarter that SCOPE had a
limited future, Newar said, adding,
"There was an unstated decision that
SCOPE wouldn't exist as it existed in
the 1982-1983 year." SCOPE
decided to donate its money to
groups sponsoring the 11 plenary ses
sions of the conference.
Peter Spivack, a member of the
Council of Presidents, said SCOPE is
going to have to pass scrutiny from
the ASSU and the Office of Student
