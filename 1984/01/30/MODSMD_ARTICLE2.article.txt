# ASSU questions SCOPE money transfer
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The .Stanford fommiWee on. Poli
tical Education *fSCOPE) voted
Friday to transfer all of the group's
money — about $11,000 — to a
Lobby Office political conference to
be held in April.
All 12 of the students who voted
in the open Tresidder Union meeting
cast ballots in favor of the transfer.
But some ASSU officials have ques
tioned whether the meeting could be
considered official because most of
the students in attendance were mem
bers of organizations participating in
the Lobby Office conference.
Eric Berg, a member of the ASSU
appropriations committee, said he
has doubts that SCOPE'S decision
will be approved by the ASSU Sen
ate.
"I don't think it is at all assured
that when this (SCOPE's) proposal

comes to the ASSU Senate it will go
through," Berg said. "There might be
.ojfcw ~ . hs i >gs..psk o p'< . ' "v'l! w?r.\ to !eok
at in evaluating Friday's meeting."
But Scott Newar, SCOPE's only
member until Friday, countered that
the meeting was advertised in The
Daily.
"The meeting was open," he said.
"Those who showed up were invited
to vote unrestrictedly."
Berg said he questions the
legitimacy of Friday's meeting.
He noted that John Hoffmire, the
director of the Lobby Office, told
several ASSU officials that he had
asked members of groups involved in
the conference to attend SCOPE's
meeting.
"There was no secret that John
was going to contact people and get
them to come to the meeting," he
said. "John called people from the
Speakers l Bureau and Stanford-in-

Government and other people who
are involved in the conference. John
it cijjr that he was io
contact a number of people from or
ganizations that had been named as
potential aspirants to claims on the
SCOPE money."
But Hoffmire said he also asked
members of groups that are not par
ticipating in the conference to come
to the meeting.
"We had members of basically all
the groups involved in political edu
cation on campus," he said.
Of the 16 students who attended
the meeting, 14 were with organiza
tions that are working on the confer
ence, Hoffmire said.
In Newar's name, Hoffmire bought
space in Friday's Daily for an ad an
nouncing the meeting.
"The ad is being paid for by me,"
Newar said. "SCOPE will reimburse
me once the funds are unfrozen."

"I think the meeting was open and
Newar said. "The people
>>•. v. en, at Lc nkeiing wOdstitUte
the new membership of SCOPE.
Those people are going to participate
in SCOPE and actively participate in
the conference."
SCOPE'S membership had
dwindled to one because the
group had concluded at the end of
spring quarter that SCOPE had a
limited future, Newar said, adding,
"There was an unstated decision that
SCOPE wouldn't exist as it existed in
the 1982-1983 year." SCOPE
decided to donate its money to
groups sponsoring the 11 plenary ses
sions of the conference.
Peter Spivack, a member of the
Council of Presidents, said SCOPE is
going to have to pass scrutiny from
the ASSU and the Office of Student
Activitit's (OSA) before it can spend its money.
"SCOPE is basically at ground zero," Spivack said.
"SCOPE can't just transfer the money (to the confer
ence) and go out of existence. There have to be people
from the group involved in the event."
Controversy has also centered around SC'OPE's trans-
Icr ol money to the Lobby Office's account since the
transfer was discovered Jan. 1 7.
Eric Diesel, a former chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, said Hoffmire did not tell him about the
transfer until Jan. 16.
"Nowhere was there any mention of the $11,000 in
the Lobby Office account." Diesel said. "He did not tell
me until the day before the second meeting, when I
asked him directly about it."
Hoffmire said he does not remember exactly when he
told Diesel about the transfer, but he is sure he told him
before the account was frozen.
Two lists of potential funding sources for the confer
ence that were presented to the Appropriations Com
mittee were obtained by The Daily. Each list was
included in different versions of a proposal for the con
ference that was written by Hoffmire.
The first list — which was given to members of the
committee sometime around Dec. 15 — mentions 41
groups that were expected to donate money but does
not note the $11,000 that had been transferred from
SCOPE's account.
The second list — which the committee saw on Jan. 17
— has a sentence on the bottom saying $13,500 had been
raised for the conference by Dec. 15. At the Jan. 17
meeting, Hoffmire said $11,000 of the money came
from SCOPE.
In both versions of the report, SCOPE is mentioned as
a participant in the planning of the conference.
Hoffmire said he wrote the first list before SCOPE
donated its money to the Lobby Office. He said he only

updated the list of potential funding sources and not
the list of groups participating in the conference.
"There is nothing dishonest about any of this siutf,
he said.
Members of the Appropriations Committee and
ASSU officials have different explanations for v>hy the
first list did not mention SCOPE'S donation.
Berg said Hoffmire told him the first list was written
before the Lobby Office had received SCOPE'S money.
ASSU student financial manager Melinda Basham said
Hoffmire told her the first list was not meant to include
all the funding sources for the conference. Ihe list —
with the exception of the Speakers Bureau — mentions
groups that are only donating money for the conterence,
she said.
The Speakers Bureau is noted in both lists as intending
to give $500 to the conference. It is also one ot 41
groups that has been invited to participate in the plan
ning of the conference.
Jon Adelstein, a member of the ASSU's Rules Com
mittee. said he does not understand why SCOPE was
included in a list of groups participating in the planning
of the conference when SCOPE was only going to
donate money.
"He (Hoffmire) really didn't give a good answer to
that question when he talked to the Rules Committee
last Monday." Adelstein said. "He fudged on that.
Either he is not clear as to why or he doesn't want to
make it clear."
Basham and Berg said they knew several weeks before
SCOPE's account was frozen that SCOPE had agreed to
donate money to the Lobby Office.
But both added that they did not know the money
had been transferred.
"Not everyone may have known, but I don't think
John was attempting to hide the fact." Berg said. "I
assumed that a transfer hadn't taken place."
Hoffmire said he talked to workers in ASSU's business
office about the transfer before the transfer was made.
"We got all the details about the transfer from
people in the business office," he said.

groups sponsoring the 11 plenary ses
sions of the conference.
Peter Spivack, a member of the
Council of Presidents, said SCOPE is
going to have to pass scrutiny from
the ASSU and the Office of Student
Activitit's (OSA) before it can spend its money.
"SCOPE is basically at ground zero," Spivack said.
"SCOPE can't just transfer the money (to the confer
ence) and go out of existence. There have to be people
from the group involved in the event."
Controversy has also centered around SC'OPE's trans-
Icr ol money to the Lobby Office's account since the
transfer was discovered Jan. 1 7.
Eric Diesel, a former chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, said Hoffmire did not tell him about the
transfer until Jan. 16.
"Nowhere was there any mention of the $11,000 in
the Lobby Office account." Diesel said. "He did not tell
me until the day before the second meeting, when I
asked him directly about it."
Hoffmire said he does not remember exactly when he
told Diesel about the transfer, but he is sure he told him
before the account was frozen.
Two lists of potential funding sources for the confer
ence that were presented to the Appropriations Com
mittee were obtained by The Daily. Each list was
included in different versions of a proposal for the con
ference that was written by Hoffmire.
The first list — which was given to members of the
committee sometime around Dec. 15 — mentions 41
groups that were expected to donate money but does
not note the $11,000 that had been transferred from
SCOPE's account.
The second list — which the committee saw on Jan. 17
— has a sentence on the bottom saying $13,500 had been
raised for the conference by Dec. 15. At the Jan. 17
meeting, Hoffmire said $11,000 of the money came
from SCOPE.
In both versions of the report, SCOPE is mentioned as
a participant in the planning of the conference.
Hoffmire said he wrote the first list before SCOPE
donated its money to the Lobby Office. He said he only

updated the list of potential funding sources and not
the list of groups participating in the conference.
"There is nothing dishonest about any of this siutf,
he said.
Members of the Appropriations Committee and
ASSU officials have different explanations for v>hy the
first list did not mention SCOPE'S donation.
Berg said Hoffmire told him the first list was written
before the Lobby Office had received SCOPE'S money.
ASSU student financial manager Melinda Basham said
Hoffmire told her the first list was not meant to include
all the funding sources for the conference. Ihe list —
with the exception of the Speakers Bureau — mentions
groups that are only donating money for the conterence,
she said.
The Speakers Bureau is noted in both lists as intending
to give $500 to the conference. It is also one ot 41
groups that has been invited to participate in the plan
ning of the conference.
Jon Adelstein, a member of the ASSU's Rules Com
mittee. said he does not understand why SCOPE was
included in a list of groups participating in the planning
of the conference when SCOPE was only going to
donate money.
"He (Hoffmire) really didn't give a good answer to
that question when he talked to the Rules Committee
last Monday." Adelstein said. "He fudged on that.
Either he is not clear as to why or he doesn't want to
make it clear."
Basham and Berg said they knew several weeks before
SCOPE's account was frozen that SCOPE had agreed to
donate money to the Lobby Office.
But both added that they did not know the money
had been transferred.
"Not everyone may have known, but I don't think
John was attempting to hide the fact." Berg said. "I
assumed that a transfer hadn't taken place."
Hoffmire said he talked to workers in ASSU's business
office about the transfer before the transfer was made.
"We got all the details about the transfer from
people in the business office," he said.
The .Stanford fommiWee on. Poli
tical Education *fSCOPE) voted
Friday to transfer all of the group's
money — about $11,000 — to a
Lobby Office political conference to
be held in April.
All 12 of the students who voted
in the open Tresidder Union meeting
cast ballots in favor of the transfer.
But some ASSU officials have ques
tioned whether the meeting could be
considered official because most of
the students in attendance were mem
bers of organizations participating in
the Lobby Office conference.
Eric Berg, a member of the ASSU
appropriations committee, said he
has doubts that SCOPE'S decision
will be approved by the ASSU Sen
ate.
"I don't think it is at all assured
that when this (SCOPE's) proposal

comes to the ASSU Senate it will go
through," Berg said. "There might be
.ojfcw ~ . hs i >gs..psk o p'< . ' "v'l! w?r.\ to !eok
at in evaluating Friday's meeting."
But Scott Newar, SCOPE's only
member until Friday, countered that
the meeting was advertised in The
Daily.
"The meeting was open," he said.
"Those who showed up were invited
to vote unrestrictedly."
Berg said he questions the
legitimacy of Friday's meeting.
He noted that John Hoffmire, the
director of the Lobby Office, told
several ASSU officials that he had
asked members of groups involved in
the conference to attend SCOPE's
meeting.
"There was no secret that John
was going to contact people and get
them to come to the meeting," he
said. "John called people from the
Speakers l Bureau and Stanford-in-

Government and other people who
are involved in the conference. John
it cijjr that he was io
contact a number of people from or
ganizations that had been named as
potential aspirants to claims on the
SCOPE money."
But Hoffmire said he also asked
members of groups that are not par
ticipating in the conference to come
to the meeting.
"We had members of basically all
the groups involved in political edu
cation on campus," he said.
Of the 16 students who attended
the meeting, 14 were with organiza
tions that are working on the confer
ence, Hoffmire said.
In Newar's name, Hoffmire bought
space in Friday's Daily for an ad an
nouncing the meeting.
"The ad is being paid for by me,"
Newar said. "SCOPE will reimburse
me once the funds are unfrozen."

"I think the meeting was open and
Newar said. "The people
>>•. v. en, at Lc nkeiing wOdstitUte
the new membership of SCOPE.
Those people are going to participate
in SCOPE and actively participate in
the conference."
SCOPE'S membership had
dwindled to one because the
group had concluded at the end of
spring quarter that SCOPE had a
limited future, Newar said, adding,
"There was an unstated decision that
SCOPE wouldn't exist as it existed in
the 1982-1983 year." SCOPE
decided to donate its money to
groups sponsoring the 11 plenary ses
sions of the conference.
