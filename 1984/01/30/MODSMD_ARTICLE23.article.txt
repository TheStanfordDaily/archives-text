## Card beats Cougars; tourney bid still in sight 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford basketball team came to a
striking realization Saturday afternoon in
Maples Pavilion: All that Pacific-10 Con
ference losing stuff is for the birds.
Or, in the case of Saturday's game, for
the Cougars.
Proving that Thursday's 78-74 upset vic
tory over league-leading Washington was
no fluke, Stanford won its second straight
conference game — a 68-65 thriller over
the Washington State Cougars — and im
proved to 2-6 in the Pac-10 and 13-7 over
all.
To say the least, the 4658 fans on hand
for the early afternoon game left Maples
with renewed hope that Stanford can
resurrect what began as a Pac-10 season of
disastrous propositions. So did Card Coach
Tom Davis.
With the easiest part of its schedule
ahead, the Cardinal still has an outside
shot at a possible National Invitational
Tournament berth. Its next four Pac-10
games are against teams with sub-.500
conference records.
Davis, however, was quick to point out
that three of those contests — Arizona
State, Arizona and UC-Berkeley — are
away games and none of them are auto
matic wins.
"There are two problems," Davis said of
his I 1 remaining games, seven of which are
on the road. "One is that we're not at
home enough. And the other is that the
league is so darn tough. There are no breath
ers."
Saturday's game against the Cougars,
now 2-5 in the Pac-10 and 8-9 overall, cer
tainly wasn't a "breather." Stanford won
it in similar last-minute fashion to
Thursday's rousing performance against
nationally ranked Washington. The Card
didn't choke.
But this time, unlike Thursday's game,
the Cardinal d dn't have an 11 -point lead
midway through the second halt. In fact,
I with just over a minute to play Saturday,
i Stanford didn't even have the lead.
After blowing an early 14-4 advantage,
.the Card led by four, 47-43, at halftime
and could put no more than five points be
tween itself and the young Cougars in the
second half.
But with 1:03 remaining, the Washing
ton State snuck past the Card, 65-64, on a
BjChris Winkler three-point play. In a similar
112 situation against Washington, Stanford
lei the Pac-10 leader perform its own ver
sion of The Big Choke. Against the
Cougars, though, the Card took the cat by
the tail, so to speak, and made the big
plays itself.

To be more precise, Keith Jones made
the big plays himself. Jones worked free
underneath the basket off an inbounds
play with 0:53 left and, after forward Earl
Koberlein acknowlegded his openness with
a pass, he scored what proved to be the
winning hoop.
"It's a set play," Jones explained later.
"We have our center (John Revelli) set a
back pick and cut through, and hope either
John or I am open in the (free throw) lane.
I happened to be open and Earl made a
great pass."
That play was with 40 seconds to go and
it gave Stanford a 66-65 lead. Jones then
wasted no time making his second big play,
this one on the defensive end. After
moving the ball around the perimeter
against the Cardinal zone, Cougar forward
Brian Pollard pulled up for a 17-foot
jumper from the right side with about 10
seconds left.
Pollard's shot got just inches from his
hand before it met another hand — one
belonging to Jones. Card forward Andy
Fischer rebounded the tipped shot and
held onto the ball until Mike Wurm inten
tionally fouled him with 0:07 on the clock.
Fischer netted both free throws and
Washington State, which lost to UC-
Berkeley Thursday in overtime, left the
Bay Area with nothing to show hut a pair
of agonizing losses and nothing to say but
bad things about the officials.
Pollard, for one, thought Jones fouled
him on his final shot, one which would have
given the Cougars a one-point lead and
probably the game. "He hit me on the arm.
1 felt it,"he said. "1 guess the officials
didn't see it."
Jones saw it, or rather, felt it differ
ently. "1 could have (hit Pollard's arm). 1
don't know for sure. But even if I did, it
wasn't enough contact to make a differ
ence."
Washington State Coach Len Stevens,
although he didn't comment about that
play in particular, had plenty to say about
the officiating. Only one Cougar — start
ing center Otis Jennings — fouled out, but
four others had four fouls at game's end
and the team was whistled for a total of
27.
"It's getting to the point now where it
just gets frustrating because it is so incon
sistent," Stevens griped. "1 looked at the
Cal film of the other day and it was
ridiculous. I can put a tape together of
stuff that's just blatant.
"It's getting out of hand. These guys are
getting $250 apiece to referee basketball
games in the Pac-10. I hate to say anything
about it because I've always made it a rule

that I wouldn't do it. But my kids deserve
more than this."
Stevens, as a coach, deserved more than
his team's clinic on how not to shoot free
throws. Although the Cougars made 4-of
-6 from the line in the second half, they
were an atrocious 3-for-1 1 in the first.
Count the four missed front ends of one
and-ones as two missed shots, and you have
a stellar 3-for-15 effort, or 20 percent.
Stevens, however, even had excuses for
that. "One of the things about this floor,
you don't realize unless you are sitting
right down there, but when you are shoot
ing free throws that floor is moving.
"Not to make any excuses for our kids,
but it is a different experience. That floor
moves. And you have all those kids
(Stanford students) going cra/y in there.
That's a heck of a situation."
Stanford, however hid little trouble
with Stevens' mysterious "moving floor,"
making 26 of its 29 free throws, or 89.7
percent.
Five of those made were by Revelli, who
has apparently cured his free throw shoot
ing ills. Revelli, in fact, hasn't missed from
the charity stripe in two games, going a
perfect 15-for-15.
One thing the Maples floor evidently
didn't affect was the Cougars' shooting
from the field. Washington State hit 55.8
percent (29-of-52) of its shots to Stan
ford's 42.9 percent (21 -of-49).

Sophomore guard U.eith Ramee may not be Stanford's top defensive guard, but his all-around
play helped the Cardinal to its second Pac-10 conference win on Saturday.
The Stanford basketball team came to a
striking realization Saturday afternoon in
Maples Pavilion: All that Pacific-10 Con
ference losing stuff is for the birds.
Or, in the case of Saturday's game, for
the Cougars.
Proving that Thursday's 78-74 upset vic
tory over league-leading Washington was
no fluke, Stanford won its second straight
conference game — a 68-65 thriller over
the Washington State Cougars — and im
proved to 2-6 in the Pac-10 and 13-7 over
all.
To say the least, the 4658 fans on hand
for the early afternoon game left Maples
with renewed hope that Stanford can
resurrect what began as a Pac-10 season of
disastrous propositions. So did Card Coach
Tom Davis.
With the easiest part of its schedule
ahead, the Cardinal still has an outside
shot at a possible National Invitational
Tournament berth. Its next four Pac-10
games are against teams with sub-.500
conference records.
Davis, however, was quick to point out
that three of those contests — Arizona
State, Arizona and UC-Berkeley — are
away games and none of them are auto
matic wins.
"There are two problems," Davis said of
his I 1 remaining games, seven of which are
on the road. "One is that we're not at
home enough. And the other is that the
league is so darn tough. There are no breath
ers."
Saturday's game against the Cougars,
now 2-5 in the Pac-10 and 8-9 overall, cer
tainly wasn't a "breather." Stanford won
it in similar last-minute fashion to
Thursday's rousing performance against
nationally ranked Washington. The Card
didn't choke.
But this time, unlike Thursday's game,
the Cardinal d dn't have an 11 -point lead
midway through the second halt. In fact,
I with just over a minute to play Saturday,
i Stanford didn't even have the lead.
After blowing an early 14-4 advantage,
.the Card led by four, 47-43, at halftime
and could put no more than five points be
tween itself and the young Cougars in the
second half.
But with 1:03 remaining, the Washing
ton State snuck past the Card, 65-64, on a
BjChris Winkler three-point play. In a similar
112 situation against Washington, Stanford
lei the Pac-10 leader perform its own ver
sion of The Big Choke. Against the
Cougars, though, the Card took the cat by
the tail, so to speak, and made the big
plays itself.

To be more precise, Keith Jones made
the big plays himself. Jones worked free
underneath the basket off an inbounds
play with 0:53 left and, after forward Earl
Koberlein acknowlegded his openness with
a pass, he scored what proved to be the
winning hoop.
"It's a set play," Jones explained later.
"We have our center (John Revelli) set a
back pick and cut through, and hope either
John or I am open in the (free throw) lane.
I happened to be open and Earl made a
great pass."
That play was with 40 seconds to go and
it gave Stanford a 66-65 lead. Jones then
wasted no time making his second big play,
this one on the defensive end. After
moving the ball around the perimeter
against the Cardinal zone, Cougar forward
Brian Pollard pulled up for a 17-foot
jumper from the right side with about 10
seconds left.
Pollard's shot got just inches from his
hand before it met another hand — one
belonging to Jones. Card forward Andy
Fischer rebounded the tipped shot and
held onto the ball until Mike Wurm inten
tionally fouled him with 0:07 on the clock.
Fischer netted both free throws and
Washington State, which lost to UC-
Berkeley Thursday in overtime, left the
Bay Area with nothing to show hut a pair
of agonizing losses and nothing to say but
bad things about the officials.
Pollard, for one, thought Jones fouled
him on his final shot, one which would have
given the Cougars a one-point lead and
probably the game. "He hit me on the arm.
1 felt it,"he said. "1 guess the officials
didn't see it."
Jones saw it, or rather, felt it differ
ently. "1 could have (hit Pollard's arm). 1
don't know for sure. But even if I did, it
wasn't enough contact to make a differ
ence."
Washington State Coach Len Stevens,
although he didn't comment about that
play in particular, had plenty to say about
the officiating. Only one Cougar — start
ing center Otis Jennings — fouled out, but
four others had four fouls at game's end
and the team was whistled for a total of
27.
"It's getting to the point now where it
just gets frustrating because it is so incon
sistent," Stevens griped. "1 looked at the
Cal film of the other day and it was
ridiculous. I can put a tape together of
stuff that's just blatant.
"It's getting out of hand. These guys are
getting $250 apiece to referee basketball
games in the Pac-10. I hate to say anything
about it because I've always made it a rule

that I wouldn't do it. But my kids deserve
more than this."
Stevens, as a coach, deserved more than
his team's clinic on how not to shoot free
throws. Although the Cougars made 4-of
-6 from the line in the second half, they
were an atrocious 3-for-1 1 in the first.
Count the four missed front ends of one
and-ones as two missed shots, and you have
a stellar 3-for-15 effort, or 20 percent.
Stevens, however, even had excuses for
that. "One of the things about this floor,
you don't realize unless you are sitting
right down there, but when you are shoot
ing free throws that floor is moving.
"Not to make any excuses for our kids,
but it is a different experience. That floor
moves. And you have all those kids
(Stanford students) going cra/y in there.
That's a heck of a situation."
Stanford, however hid little trouble
with Stevens' mysterious "moving floor,"
making 26 of its 29 free throws, or 89.7
percent.
Five of those made were by Revelli, who
has apparently cured his free throw shoot
ing ills. Revelli, in fact, hasn't missed from
the charity stripe in two games, going a
perfect 15-for-15.
One thing the Maples floor evidently
didn't affect was the Cougars' shooting
from the field. Washington State hit 55.8

ford's 42.9 percent (21 -of-49).

ing center Otis Jennings — fouled out, but
four others had four fouls at game's end
and the team was whistled for a total of
27.
"It's getting to the point now where it
just gets frustrating because it is so incon
sistent," Stevens griped. "1 looked at the
Cal film of the other day and it was
ridiculous. I can put a tape together of
stuff that's just blatant.
"It's getting out of hand. These guys are
getting $250 apiece to referee basketball
games in the Pac-10. I hate to say anything
about it because I've always made it a rule

that I wouldn't do it. But my kids deserve
more than this."
Stevens, as a coach, deserved more than
his team's clinic on how not to shoot free
throws. Although the Cougars made 4-of
-6 from the line in the second half, they
were an atrocious 3-for-1 1 in the first.
Count the four missed front ends of one
and-ones as two missed shots, and you have
a stellar 3-for-15 effort, or 20 percent.
Stevens, however, even had excuses for
that. "One of the things about this floor,
you don't realize unless you are sitting
right down there, but when you are shoot
ing free throws that floor is moving.
"Not to make any excuses for our kids,
but it is a different experience. That floor
moves. And you have all those kids
(Stanford students) going cra/y in there.
That's a heck of a situation."
Stanford, however hid little trouble
with Stevens' mysterious "moving floor,"
making 26 of its 29 free throws, or 89.7
percent.
Five of those made were by Revelli, who
has apparently cured his free throw shoot
ing ills. Revelli, in fact, hasn't missed from
the charity stripe in two games, going a
perfect 15-for-15.
One thing the Maples floor evidently
didn't affect was the Cougars' shooting
from the field. Washington State hit 55.8
percent (29-of-52) of its shots to Stan
ford's 42.9 percent (21 -of-49).

Sophomore guard U.eith Ramee may not be Stanford's top defensive guard, but his all-around
play helped the Cardinal to its second Pac-10 conference win on Saturday.
