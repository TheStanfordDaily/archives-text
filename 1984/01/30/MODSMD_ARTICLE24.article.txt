Dons 12-3 on Friday, the Card
returned home and backed
senior John Radtke s six
shutout innings with four early
hruns before salting away the
kontest with a four-run
Seventh. Radtke hung up the
six goose eggs by battling USF
with a variety of pitches, in
cluding effective otf-speed
'breaking balls.
"Radtke was great,"
Marquess said after the game.
"He's got great location with
everything he throws. And its
very tough to hit that breaking
ball this soon in the season."
It may have been a little bit
early in the year for the Dons,
who also went down meekly
against senior Steve Cottrell in
the nightcap. In 24 innings I)SF
could manage only 15 hits.

Meanwhile, the Stanford of
fense was scoring runs' in
bunches, bur often with the
help of the Dons' pitching
staff.
On Friday, Darryl Stephens
cleared the bases in the top of
the first inning with a three
run triple, his first at bat since
returning from a knee injury
that sidelined him last season.
The Card shelled starter Terry
McManus for five runs in the
inning, thanks mainly to six
walks.
Stanford got two more in
the second with the aid of
three more walks from reliever
Kevin McCarthy, and the Card
blew the game open in a four
run eighth which was high
lighted by sophomore Mark
Davis' inside-the-park home
run.
Senior Brian Myers got his
24th career win, moving him
into a three-way tie for third
on Stanford's all-time list,
with three innings of shutout
relief help from sophomore
Kevin Kunkel.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
parlayed four walks and RBI
singles from Davis and junior
second baseman Pete Stanicek
to build a 4-0 lead for Radtke
after the first two innings.
Stanicek and Davis also dizzied
IJSF catcher Nick Laßocca,
stealing a total of five bases in

those two frames.
With the likes of Stanicek
and shortstop John Verducci
behind them, the Stanford
moundsmen did not need the
rest of the Card's 10 runs. Each
infielder produced defensive
gems on diving stops, Stanicek
on a floating liner to his right
and Verducci with an over-the
shoulder grab of a Texas
league pop-up in shallow cen
terfield.
Marquess was pleased with
his defense. "We played really
well defensively. We made only
one error in three games and
they (Verducci and Stanicek)
are the guys who will give us
the leadership we need. We ex
pect them to play well."
By the end of Saturday's
seven-inning second game,
however, it was clear that the
Cardinal's offense has some
room for improvement. Davis,
who went 3-for-4 with a pair
of RBIs in the 10-1 first-game

win, left in the opening inning
of the second game with a leg
cramp.
It seemed that the Stanford
offense went with him. Two
hits by Stanicek and a 3-for-3
performance by sophomore
Mike Deßenon were the only
Cardinal hits in the second
game. USF's Pat McCelland
might have won the game were
it not for a few Dons' miscues
that led to an unearned run in
the first and second innings.
Asked to evaluate his of
fense. Marquess was hesitant.
"I don't know yet," he said.
"It's still early yet, but we may
not be able to rely on the long
ball like last year."
Marquess will have a chance
to find out more about his club
when seventh-ranked Cal State
Fullerton visits Stanford for a
three- game series this
weekend. The Card will travel
to Stanislaus State tomorrow.

and shortstop John Verducci
behind them, the Stanford
moundsmen did not need the
rest of the Card's 10 runs. Each
infielder produced defensive
gems on diving stops, Stanicek
on a floating liner to his right
and Verducci with an over-the
shoulder grab of a Texas
league pop-up in shallow cen
terfield.
Marquess was pleased with
his defense. "We played really
well defensively. We made only
one error in three games and
they (Verducci and Stanicek)
are the guys who will give us
the leadership we need. We ex
pect them to play well."
By the end of Saturday's
seven-inning second game,
however, it was clear that the
Cardinal's offense has some
room for improvement. Davis,
who went 3-for-4 with a pair
of RBIs in the 10-1 first-game

win, left in the opening inning
of the second game with a leg
cramp.
It seemed that the Stanford
offense went with him. Two
hits by Stanicek and a 3-for-3
performance by sophomore
Mike Deßenon were the only
Cardinal hits in the second
game. USF's Pat McCelland
might have won the game were
it not for a few Dons' miscues
that led to an unearned run in
the first and second innings.
Asked to evaluate his of
fense. Marquess was hesitant.
"I don't know yet," he said.
"It's still early yet, but we may
not be able to rely on the long
ball like last year."
Marquess will have a chance
to find out more about his club
when seventh-ranked Cal State
Fullerton visits Stanford for a
three- game series this
weekend. The Card will travel
to Stanislaus State tomorrow.

■ The No. 6-ranked Stanford
jfcardinal made its 1 984 baseball
debut a successful one, sweep
ing a three-game series from
the University of San Francisco
[Dons 12-3, 10-1, 2-1 and living
up to their pre-season ac
colades in the process.
■ For Coach Mark Marquess
Sand those fans who braved the
|ot sun to watch Saturday's
jdouble-header at Sunken Dia
tnond, that meant solid pitch
ing, sparkling defense and
Sluggish hitting.
I After dumping 11. • host
Dons 12-3 on Friday, the Card
returned home and backed
senior John Radtke s six
shutout innings with four early
hruns before salting away the
kontest with a four-run
Seventh. Radtke hung up the
six goose eggs by battling USF
with a variety of pitches, in
cluding effective otf-speed
'breaking balls.
"Radtke was great,"
Marquess said after the game.
"He's got great location with
everything he throws. And its
very tough to hit that breaking
ball this soon in the season."
It may have been a little bit
early in the year for the Dons,
who also went down meekly
against senior Steve Cottrell in
the nightcap. In 24 innings I)SF
could manage only 15 hits.

Meanwhile, the Stanford of
fense was scoring runs' in
bunches, bur often with the
help of the Dons' pitching
staff.
On Friday, Darryl Stephens
cleared the bases in the top of
the first inning with a three
run triple, his first at bat since
returning from a knee injury
that sidelined him last season.
The Card shelled starter Terry
McManus for five runs in the
inning, thanks mainly to six
walks.
Stanford got two more in
the second with the aid of
three more walks from reliever
Kevin McCarthy, and the Card
blew the game open in a four
run eighth which was high
lighted by sophomore Mark
Davis' inside-the-park home
run.
Senior Brian Myers got his
24th career win, moving him
into a three-way tie for third
on Stanford's all-time list,
with three innings of shutout
relief help from sophomore
Kevin Kunkel.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
parlayed four walks and RBI
singles from Davis and junior
second baseman Pete Stanicek
to build a 4-0 lead for Radtke
after the first two innings.
Stanicek and Davis also dizzied
IJSF catcher Nick Laßocca,
stealing a total of five bases in

those two frames.
With the likes of Stanicek
and shortstop John Verducci
behind them, the Stanford
moundsmen did not need the
rest of the Card's 10 runs. Each
infielder produced defensive
gems on diving stops, Stanicek
on a floating liner to his right
and Verducci with an over-the
shoulder grab of a Texas
league pop-up in shallow cen
terfield.
Marquess was pleased with
his defense. "We played really
