# Trojans overwhelm Lady Card
## 
### JOHN LIS 
Shut down by an overpowering defense and
unable to stop the most potent front line in wo
men's basketball, the Stanford Cardinal dropped
a K6-44 decision to the USC Women of Troy
before a season-high crowd of 3033 in Maples
Pavilion Saturday night.
Stanford's offense, which has struggled all
year, was stopped cold by USC.
The Cardinal came into the game averaging
only 61.1 points per contest, and the intimidat
ing. shot-blocking Trojan defense forced Stan
ford out of its offense.
Stanford had only 17 points at halftime and
did much of its scoring late in the second half
when USC Coach Linda Sharp cleared her bench
after the victory was assured. The Cardinal shot
only 25 percent from the field in the first half,
finishing at 33 percent on the night.
Stanford Coach Dotty McCrca knew her
squad would have a tough time against the No.
3-ranked Trojans, but she was not happy about
the team's performance. "We aren't doing the
fundamentals for 40 minutes," she said. "It's
like an old song. We're not going to get off this
level unless we start doing the little things."
Stanford had hoped to shut down the USC
transition game by slowing the tempo and to
stop the high-powered Trojan offense with a
new defensive set-up.
It didn't work. Sophomore captain Virginia
Sourlis said, "We get into games and don't do
what we do in practice."
In the second half, USC used a 71 percent
shooting performance to turn a 36-17 game into

a blowout. The Trojans were led by senior center
Pam McGee, who shot 9-of-13 from the field
and scored 22 points.
Cheryl Miller, the sophomore All-America
forward many regard as the finest player in the
women's game, dominated the contest. Miller
shot K-of-9 from the field, scored IK points,
pulled down I 5 rebounds and blocked four shots.
Senior forward Paula McGee scored 1 1 points
and grabbed seven rebounds. USC out
rebounded Stanford 46-29.
Stanford's offense, stymied by the USC
defense, was led by little-used reserve guard
Judy Griffith. The 5-foot-10 sophomore came
off the bench for the last nine minutes of the
game and displayed a sharp outside shooting
touch from the wing in scoring a career-high 1 1
points.
Junior forward Mary Bradach, who faced Mil
ler most of the night, was the only other Car
dinal in double figures, with 10 points.
The win puts USC at 16-3 overall and 5-0 in
the West Coast Athletic Association. Stanford
falls to 3-14 on the season, 0-5 in the confer
ence. The Cardinal travels to Arizona State
Thursday and to Arizona Saturday for a pair of
WCAA contests. Stanford does not have an
other home game until Feb. 24, when Cal State
Fullerton visits Maples Favilion.
The Cardinal will travel to New Zealand this
summer for games against local teams, including
the New Zealand National Team. The Cardinal
has begun fund-raising efforts at all home bas
ketball games, both men's and women's, and will
continue these through the end of i ;, e season.
