# Grant resigns; Vikings surprised
## 
### 
Minneapolis (AP) — Bud
Grant, the stone-faced coach
who directed the Minnesota
Vikings to four Super Bowls
during his 17-year National
Football League career, has
retired, the team announced
Saturday.
"I'm not burned out," said
Grant, 56. "I've enjoyed coach
ing so much that I never looked
forward to retirement from
my job. 1 don't have any aspira
tions to take another coaching
job or coach in another
league."
I.es Steckel. who says he's
often called a "perfectionist
and a workaholic," was formal
ly announced vesterday as the

new coach of the Vikings.
Grant flew to Honolulu
Friday with General Manager
Mike Lynn to tell Vikings Pres
ident Max Winter his decision.
Winter lives in Honolulu in the
off-season.
"In my mind, timing is the
most important thing," Grant
told the Minneapolis Star and
Tribune. "I decided this was
the time to quit. There wasn't
any pressure on me. There were
a lot of things I want to do
while I still have my health."
In 27 seasons, including 10
with Winnipeg in the Canadian
Football League, Grant
amassed 283 regular season and
postseason victories, making

him the second most successful
coach in pro football history .
Only the late George Halas,
NFL and Ghicago Bears foun
der. had more victories. Halas
won 326 games and Grant won
161 with Minnesota and 122 at
Winnipeg.
Only two active NFL
coaches, Tom Landry of the
Dallas Cowboys and Don Shula
of the Miami Dolphins, have
won more NFL games than
Grant.
Grant was second only to
Landry among active coaches in
length of service with the same
team. Landry has been head
coach at Dallas since the team

was formed in 1960.
Grant's resignation jolted
team officials and players.
"1 was returning home from
a walk when 1 noticed Bud and
Mike sitting on my porch,"
Winter said. "1 was hoping that
nothing was wrong. And when
he told me his decision, the
tears rolled down my eyes.
' He had never given me any
hint of retiring so I was com
pletely surprised when he told
me he was going to quit," Win
ter said. "I don't know how to
replace him. He was such a win
ner. In my book he is the best
coach who ever lived."
