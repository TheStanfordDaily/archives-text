# USC's Miller draws strong following
## 
### JOHN LIS 
It was listed on the
schedule as just another
basketball game, but Satur
day night's Stanford-USC
contest was more than that
— it was a phenomenon.
The second-largest crowd
ever to see a women's bas
ketball game at Stanford —
3033 people — streamed in
to Maples Pavilion to see
last year's national cham
pions and their All-America
forward, Cheryl Miller.
The number of Stanford
partisans in the stands was
probably about the same as
usual — 100 or 200 loyal
followers. The rest were
fans from all over the Bay
Area who came to see Miller

and the Women ol Iroy put
on a show. That there was a
Stanford team playing on
its home floor seemed an
afterthought to many.
Judging from crowd reac
tion, one might have
thought the game was being
played in Los Angeles. The
Stanford players preferred
playing in front of people
instead of empty seats, but
they probably wished the
fans had been more of a
home crowd. They realized,
however, the reality of their
situation.
"I understand that people
come out to see Cheryl Mil
ler and the McGee's (twin
sisters Pam and Paula),
said Stanford captain Vir

ginia Sourlis, "but it would
he nice it they came to see
Stanford women's basket
ball instead.''
Fans who came for the
show weren't disappointed.
Miller, probably the
finest woman in the game,
gave them their money's
worth with her skying tip
ins, double-pump layups,
and leaping rebounds. She
also had one move that was
absolutely stunning. With
nine minutes gone in the
first half, she jumped up for
a pass from teammate Cyn
thia Cooper. Without com
ing down, she brought the
ball up and tossed it in from
eight feet out as the crowd
"oohed" and "aahed".
Fans also came to see Pam
McGee's powerful tip-ins,
Paula McGee's driving
reverse lay-ups, and
Cooper's twisting drives,
but Miller was without
doubt the main attraction
of this show.
After a quick shower fol
lowing the game. Miller
ventured outside the locker
room to be mobbed by
hundreds of fans. One
might think she would be
bothered by all of this, but
she is still a 20-year-old col
lege sophomore who is flat
tered by all the attention.
"It's a lot of fun, " she
said after signing the last
autograph, "but I'm still
not used to it." Miller
enjoyed the crowd support
USC got at Stanford,
saying, "It's a nice change.
It makes my game a lot
easier."
Women's basketball is en
joying its greatest
popularity, and Miller and
the USC team are a major
reason. They also seem to
realize their role.
After halftime the
Trojans talked and shook
hands with two teams of
fourth-grade girls who had
played during the intermis
sion. After the game Miller
patiently signed autographs
Tor all the fans, mostly
young girls, who had
crowded outside the locker
room.
Parents asked Miller to
pose for photographs with
their daughters, and she
obliged, putting her arm
around each and smiling.
Girls bragged to their
friends about a signature or
snapshot for their scrap
books. !
