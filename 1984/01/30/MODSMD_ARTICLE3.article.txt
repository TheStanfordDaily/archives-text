# President says he'll run again
## Professors see no policy surprises 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Staff writer With wire reports 
President Reagan announced last
night on national television that he
will seek re-election, saying, "Our
work is not finished."
"We are here to lift the weak and
to build the peace," he said, in the
long-anticipated declaration.
Reagan stated that in 1981 he had
faced a nation on "the brink of eco
nomic collapse" with a "dangerously
weak" national defense.
"Well, things have changed," he
concluded. He cited among his ac
complishments reducing inflation, in
creasing industrial production and
sales of housing and automobiles, and
rebuilding the national defense.
"By beginning to rebuild our
defenses, we have restored credible
deterrence and can confidently seek
a secure and lasting peace, as well as a
reduction in arms," Reagan said.
He said that Vice President
George Bush will again be his running
mate.
Although a few political experts in
Washington had predicted that the
72-year-old Reagan would decide not
to run, the announcement came as no
surprise to most observers.
Reagan had dropped hints of his
intentions for almost a year, but he
did not formally declare his candidacy
until yesterday.
"If he had announced in autumn,"
explained Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall, "his campaign
would have had to begin paying for
his travel around the country." Be
cause he waited, the federal treasury
has funded his travel for the
speeches he has delivered in the past
fev months
House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.), one of Reagan's
harshest critics, warned after
Reagan's announcement, "The
American people will reject four
more years of danger, four more
years of pain."
Experts here predicted that
Reagan will probably win the election
unless there is a major economic or
foreign policy crisis.
Marshall said Reagan should win
"if there are no serious foreign policy
mistakes or events" and "provided
the economy continues to perk up."
"Economy is central," according to
History Prof. Barton Bernstein, j
"Inflation is down. Unemployment i
has been cut somewhat. If the eco- <
nomy remains the.way it is . .. and if ■
Reagan can continue avoiding press >

conferences, (victory) is probable."
"Reagan's performance in office
will be the key issue," according to
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody. "Democrats will score the
best they can off it."
Current polls indicate that
Democrats will not score well overall.
Reagan is enjoying his highest
rankings in nearly three years. The
New York Times-CBS News poll
released last week said that 57 per
cent, up from 41 percent a year ago.
approved of the job Reagan is doing
as president.
Democrats hope to score points
criticizing Reagan's hawkish foreign
policy. The president has made clear
his intention to use force where nec
essary, and he has admitted responsi
bility for the deaths of 280
American servicemen in Lebanon and
Grenada.
Reagan has not made any crucial
mistakes in foreign policy yet, but, as
Brody noted, "a lot of things can
happen in 10 months."
Concern about his popularity will
undoubtedly play a part in Reagan's

policies from this point, but experts
doubt that he will make any major
conciliatory gestures.
At most, he will give the
"appearance of Republican centrist
politics" and show "desirability to
negotiate with Russia," said
Bernstein.
Marshall agreed that Reagan plans
no major policy changes. "Almost
more than any recent president.
Reagan knows where he wants to
go," Marshall said. "He's changing his
rhetoric but not any policies. He has
changed his style — the way he talks
— to keep European allies at rest and
American opinions high."
