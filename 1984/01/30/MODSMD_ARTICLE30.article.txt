### LARRY GREEN Staff writer 
What do you do it you're
ranked Inst in the nation in
pre season polls and your first
[match effectively won't count
on your record? II you're the
Stanford men's tennis team,
you beat CJal State Hayward 9-
0 in a match that Coach Dick
Gould referred to as "a
scrimmage."
According to Gould, it was a
practice match because Cal
State llayward's conference
"won't let them have an offi
cial match until Feh.l. I
wanted to play it now because
it gave us a bit of a tuneup."
Stanford unleashed a
seasoned trio of veteran sop

homores m the first three
singles positions.
First singles man Danny
Goldie dominated his match
against llayward's Rolf
Wiedenmeyer 6-1,6-1. Goldie's
precise game showed almost no
weaknesses. He let Weiden
meyer make the mistakes as he
coasted to a straight-set vic
tory.
Jim Grabb, Stanford's
second singles player, defeated
his opponent Brian Memed
basich 6-1, 6-3. The match was
close at 4-3 in the second set
before Grabb ended it two
games later. Third singles Eric
Rosenfeld played the shortest
match of the three, beating
Hayward's Guy Schalin, 6-2,6-
->

Fourth singles Derrick Ros
tagno, a freshman, won his
match over Ted Hill, 7-5, 6-3.
Fifth singles player Mark
McKeen won easily, 6-3, 6-0,
over Rich Wilkinson . Sixth
singles man sophomore Geordie
McKee concluded the singles
sweep with a 6-3, 6-3 victory
over Jay Miller.
Ihe first doubles pair of
Rostagno and McKeen, who
had never played together
before, beat what Gould called
"an established doubles team"
in Hayward's Wiedenmeyer and
Memedbasich 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.
Ibis entertaining match went
to a tight final set in which
Rostagno and McKeen never
led by more than one game un
til winning the set and match.
Two Stanford freshmen,
Mark Jacobson and Scott
Moody, played very well at the
second doubles position, win
ning their match over Schalin
anil Wilkinson 7-5, 6-4. Juniors
Paul Robinson and Jeremy
Semple played what Gould
called, "one of the strongest
doubles matches" he had seen,
winning 6-3, 6-1 in the third
doubles slot.
"We had a good solid ef
fort," Gould said after the
match. "It's the kind of team
where we have good experience
and solid ballplayers. My num
ber six man is as good as my
number one man. The starters
are pretty even." Gould's
singles rotation was without
sophomore John Letts who
played a tourney in Los An
geles. L.etts, according to
Gould, is one of the first six
singles players.
Overall, Gould was pleased
with the win. "This gave the
guys a chance to get first
match jitters out of the way.
We go to a really big tourna
ment next week."
On Wednesday, Gould takes
his team to Los Angeles for
the National Team Champion
ships. "The top ten teams in
the country will all be there,"
he said. Stanford is seeded
first, ahead of other tennis
powers USC, SMU and
Auburn.
