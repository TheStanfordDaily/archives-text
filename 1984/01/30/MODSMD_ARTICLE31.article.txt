# Swimmers win but not easily
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
It was business as usual over the
weekend for the Stanford men's and wo
men's swimming teams, as they continued
to dominate the collegiate circuit.
Neither team did anything to dispel the
notion that it is the top-ranked team in
the nation.
The men's team coasted to the title in
the Dallas Morning News Classic. The Car
dinal finished with 28N points, 20 points
ahead of SMU in second. Arizona State
and UCLA were third and fourth
respectively out of six of the top seven
dual-meet teams.
But Stanford Coach Skip Kenney was
far from satisfied after his team's victory.
"I'm just not happy," Kenney said. "We
should have done better in the 200s than
we did. If we hadn't had that lead going
into the night, we would never have won.
SMU cut the margin by four points and we
just couldn't build."
Indeed, on Friday the Cardinal was
seemingly unstoppable as they won five
finals and three consolation finals to build
a 24-point lead over SMU.

Stanford was paced by freshmen Jeff
Kostoff and Pablo Morales and by sopho
more John Moffet. All three swam NCAA
qualifying times.
Kostoff won the 400 individual medley
with one of the nations best times at
3:55.01. Morales won die 100 fly and Mof
fet set an NCAA standard by taking the
100 breast in 56.30. All of their times
placed among the top five in school history
in each event. Dave Louden won the 200
free and the 400 medley relay team of
Dave Bottom, Moffet, Morales and
Louden also finished first.
But as Kenney explained, Saturday was
different story. Kostoff registered his
second victory of the meet, but the Car
dinal's only one of the day, when he won
the 500 freestyle.
Stanford failed to win any 200 events
on Saturday, including Moffet's defeat at
the hands of SMU's Chris Weismann.
It is exactly this kind of letdown Kenney
is trying to prevent. Kenney explained at
the beginning of the academic year that he
felt that his team had a mental letdown
going into last year's NCAA Champion-

ships that cost it the national title.
The women's team also had a very good
Friday, followed by a tougher Saturday.
On Friday, the team easily disposed of
UCI.A (98-42) and Long Beach State
(124-12).
Stanford was paced by the triple threat
of Marybeth Linzmeier, Kathy Smith anil
Sherri Hanna who all registered victories
with season-best performances.
However, on Saturday the Cardinal took
on number two ranked USC in Los An
geles. Although they won 82-58, the meet
was very close until just the very end.
"We led all the way, but not by much,"
Coach George Haines explained. At one
point the score was 43-36, but freshman
Susan Rapp won what Haines called the
"turning point" race. Rapp won the 100
fly with a national best this year of 53.3.
Soon after that Stanford went out to a
66-49 lead and never looked back. The
meet also featured several very close races
such as the 400 individual medley between
Susan Woodhead of USC and Patty Gavin
of Stanford. Both broke the fastest time
this year, but Woodhead prevailed with a
4:17.30 to Gavin's 4:17.90.
