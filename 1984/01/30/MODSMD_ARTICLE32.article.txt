### 
As a result of its strong per
formance in Saturday's Air
Force Tournament, the Stan
ford women's fencing team ap
pears to be a favorite for the
national championship.
The Cardinal women swept
by their four opponents in
Colorado Springs, Colorado,
losing only six individual
matches, and Coach Buzz
Hurst said his team is improv
ing and has a good chance to
win the NCAA championship.
"The women are getting
stronger and stronger," Hurst
said. "The remainder of our

season is against teams we ve
played and beaten. A national
championship is a very real pos
sibility."
Stanford, which is now 11-0
in match play, defeated St.
Johns of New Mexico 15-1, Aii
Force 12-4, Colorado 16-0 and
Brigham Young 15-1.
Meanwhile, the Stanford
men won three of their four
matches and upped their over
all record to 9-2, defeating Si.
Johns 21-6, Colorado 18-9 and
Brigham Young 22-5. The
Card's only loss was to Air
Force, 16-11.
