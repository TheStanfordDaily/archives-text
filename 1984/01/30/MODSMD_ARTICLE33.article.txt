Bakersfield easily took the
championship at Saturday's
"All-Cal" Invitational in
San Francisco, an improving
Cardinal wrestling team
placed fifth â€” with three
wrestlers taking the top
four spots.
"We could have done a
little better, but everyone
wrestled well. The team is
still improving and hopeful
ly everything will gel to
gether by the Pac-10 and
NCAA championships."
Stanford Coach Chris Hor
pel said. "1 was pleased that

everyone won at least one
match. There is enough
competition left to prepare
the wrestlers for the Pac
-10, and by then I hope most
of our athletes will be 90 to
100 percent."
At 126 pounds, Neil
Wartnick put in a strong
showing and captured
fourth place. Coming off a
recent illness, Jeff Wilson
(177 pounds) took second
and looks like he should do
well again in the conference
championships, where he
took third place last year.
Had Wilson won his match,
Stanford would have

finished fourth ahead of
Humboldt State.
The star of the day for
Stanford was Scott Wiggen
at 142 pounds, who success
fully defended his champi
onship. Wiggen. who lost to
San Francisco State's Jeff
Gonzales earlier in the year
by one point, defeated
Gonzales 13-4.
Stanford split its two
matches against Long Beach
State Friday night.
At 167 pounds, Jody Wil
liams was defeated 13-12,
and at 190 pounds Kurt
Kassulke trounced his op
ponent 10-0.
