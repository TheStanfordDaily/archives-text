# AIDS scare decreases blood donations

An unwarranted fear about the contraction of
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
may have triggered a recent decline in the num
ber of blood donations at the Stanford Medical
School Blood Center, according to Roger
Svoboda, blood center administrative manager.
"Although it's difficult to attribute the
decrease entirely to the fear of getting AIDS,"
Svoboda said, "it is a contributing factor." The
center has experienced a 2 to 4 percent drop in
the number of donations in recent months, he
said.
"We need to clarify to the public that there is
no risk of getting AIDS from a blood donation,"
Svoboda said adding that blood donors have a
" zero percent chance" of contracting the disease.
He said the fear of contracting AIDS has been
propagated by the news media, which reported
that the disease could be contracted from blood
transfusions. "The public hasn't differentiated

between giving blood and receiving blood,"
Svoboda said.
He said the odds of contracting the disease
from a transfusion are also "very low, somewhere
near one in one million or one in half-a-million,
depending on the reports you look at."
More than 1500 cases of AIDS, which destroys
the body's immune system, have been reported
since the condition was identified in 1979. There
is no known cure and about 75 percent of its vic
tims have died within two years.
The blood center has developed a three-step
plan to screen possible donors who may be carry
ing the disease in their blood, Svoboda said.
Each donor candidate is first given an AIDS in
formation sheet, asking the donor to identify
himself if he falls into one of five "high risk"
categories. The groups in which the disease is
most prominent are sexually-active homosexual
men, intravenous drug abusers, Haitian im
migrants, patients such as hemophiliacs who have
received large amounts of blood or blood prod

ucts and sex partners of persons belonging to the
above groups.
Donors are then asked to complete medical
history forms and have their blood pressure and
hemoglobin count checked by a nurse, Svoboda
said. Once the donor clears these hurdles, blood
can be drawn, he said.
The blood is then put through a T-Cell test,
screening for an abnormal ratio of lymphosites.
Although blood polluted with the disease always
shows an abnormal ratio of lymphosites, 1 to 2
percent of all people also show an abnormal ratio
and "obviously the majority of these people do
not have AIDS." Svoboda said.
As a precautionary measure, all blood showing
an abnormal ratio is thrown out, he said.
Svoboda said that a new direct donor program
has been established to "meet the psychological
needs of the patient and the patient's family
who want to do something for that patient and
who fear the patient getting AIDS from blood
transfusions."
