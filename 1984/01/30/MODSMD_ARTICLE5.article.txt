# Assemblyman defends pound animal use
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
California Assembly member
Byron Sher said Friday he supports
using pound animals for research and
will continue to oppose a bill now in
the state Senate that would prohibit
pounds and shelters from releasing
unclaimed animals to researchers.
Speaking before a small bag-lunch
group, Sher characterized the pound
seizure — or "Roberti" — bill
sponsored by Senate President David
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) as a
"sensitive issue," particularly per
tinent to the University because the
Medical Center uses pound animals
to conduct biomedical research.
The Medical Center has lobbied
strongly against the bill, which tailed
to pass in the Assembly during the
past two legislative sessions.

Roberti has re-introduced the bill
for this session. Currently pending in
a Senate committee, the bill, accor
ding to Sher. 'may never reach the
floor." If it does, the Assembly
member said he will vote against the
bill again.
Noting that some organizations
breed animals solely for the purposes
of research. Sher affirmed his opposi
tion to the pound seizure bill. "I find
it difficult to draw the distinction
between an animal that is bred for
the purpose and an abandoned animal
that is going to be destroyed
anyway." he said.
Currently a part-time Stanford
Law School professor and a Demo
cratic legislator of the 21st district
since 1980. Sher spoke in the Meyer
Forum Room at length on the animal
research issue. Although the ASSU

advertised the session as a Town Hall
meeting, lack of publicity trans
formed it into an informal session
comprising a Daily reporter, an ASSU
Lobby Office member and an ASSU
senator.
Sher said he imposes one condition
to his alignment with using animals
— pound or otherwise — for re
search: Researchers must utilize high
standards of treatment to avoid
abusing animals.
Sher said instances of abuse have
occurred in the past and he continues
to feel concern "about the misuse of
animals for medical or psychological
studies." He said research institu
tions must rely on codes of ethics to
regulate their behavior. According to
Sher. the University has an excellent
code of ethics.

Sher described a competing bill
that seeks to insure that animals
have every chance of being claimed
before being designated for research
purposes. He affirmed his support of
the bill but said many of Roberti's
supporters regard the competing bill
as a "cosmetic gesture."
Many of Roberti's supporters in
clude Hollywood film and televison
stars who support the pound seizure
bill. Lorretta Swit, former actress on
the television series M.A.S.H., has
lobbied vigorously for the pound sei
zure bill.
Sher said the dynamics in the
legislature stem not only from the
issue-specific pound seizure bill but
also from the more general relation
ship between the governor and the
legislature.

Although the Democrats have a
majority in both of the houses of the
legislature, Sher said that Deuk
mejian, a Republican, exercises a
good deal of control. Much of this
control originates from the two
third bipartisian vote required for
many measures, including the budget.
Sher said that Deukmejian. a legis
lator for some time before acquiring
the office of governor, understands
the legislature.
"Many people though it would be
easier to work with a governor who
came from that background than
with the previous governor," Sher
said. Yet the governor has proved to
be "one tough hombre."
In a short discussion of the 1984
presidential race, Sher said that he
supports Sen. Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.). He particularly admires
Cranston's stance on the nuclear
weapons issue.

Sher said Cranston's "uphill light"
will be well worth the struggle. "I
believe that Cranston will make it his
number one priority to de-escalate
the nuclear arms race, " he said.
Sher holds the chair of the Assem
bly's Criminal Law Committee . He
also sits on the Assembly Commit
tees of Natural Resources, Utility
and Transportation. Sher has been a
law professor at Stanford since 1957.
