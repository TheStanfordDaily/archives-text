# Assemblyman defends pound animal use
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
California Assembly member
Byron Sher said Friday he supports
using pound animals for research and
will continue to oppose a bill now in
the state Senate that would prohibit
pounds and shelters from releasing
unclaimed animals to researchers.
Speaking before a small bag-lunch
group, Sher characterized the pound
seizure — or "Roberti" — bill
sponsored by Senate President David
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) as a
"sensitive issue," particularly per
tinent to the University because the
Medical Center uses pound animals
to conduct biomedical research.
The Medical Center has lobbied
strongly against the bill, which tailed
to pass in the Assembly during the
past two legislative sessions.

Roberti has re-introduced the bill
for this session. Currently pending in
a Senate committee, the bill, accor
ding to Sher. 'may never reach the
floor." If it does, the Assembly
member said he will vote against the
bill again.
Noting that some organizations
breed animals solely for the purposes
of research. Sher affirmed his opposi
tion to the pound seizure bill. "I find
it difficult to draw the distinction
between an animal that is bred for
the purpose and an abandoned animal
that is going to be destroyed
anyway." he said.
Currently a part-time Stanford
Law School professor and a Demo
cratic legislator of the 21st district
since 1980. Sher spoke in the Meyer
Forum Room at length on the animal
research issue. Although the ASSU

advertised the session as a Town Hall
meeting, lack of publicity trans
formed it into an informal session
comprising a Daily reporter, an ASSU
Lobby Office member and an ASSU
senator.
Sher said he imposes one condition
to his alignment with using animals
— pound or otherwise — for re
search: Researchers must utilize high
standards of treatment to avoid
abusing animals.
Sher said instances of abuse have
occurred in the past and he continues
to feel concern "about the misuse of
animals for medical or psychological
studies." He said research institu
tions must rely on codes of ethics to
regulate their behavior. According to
Sher. the University has an excellent
code of ethics.
