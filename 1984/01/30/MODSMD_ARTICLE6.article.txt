Reagan unlikely to receive
line-item veto authority
Washington — President Reagan's aides warned him
before his State of the Union address that the constitu
tion. il amendment giving him line-item veto authority was
unlikely to be adopted by Congress, would meet ratifica
tion resistance in the states and in any case would not be
approved in time to cut federal spending any time soon.
As a possible alternative to the line-item veto, his aides
suggested a statutory approach — enacting regular legisla
tion to increase his power to "rescind" congressional appro
priations, according to a White House background paper
obtained by The Washington Post.
I hey noted that such a proposal, by Sen. William
Armstrong (R-Colo.) had come within three votes of
passing the Senate in November, even without presidential
support.
Reagan, however, went against his aides' advice and pro
posed the line-item veto because it is a stronger election
year symbol of his resolve to cut the federal budget and a
device he used as governor of California, according to White
House officials.
But White House and congressional budget experts note
that most of the federal budget would be out of reach of
line-item veto because more than 80 percent of it is
composed of entitlement programs such as Social Security,
interest on the national debt and the defense budget,
items that cannot be cut or that Reagan does not want to
cut.
Rising DDT levels found
Washington — DDT has been turning up in increasing con
centrations in California and other Western states, sug
gesting that a pesticide banned by the government 12 years
ago following publication of Rachel Carson's book. Silent
Spring, is creeping back into the United States.
Officials here and in Texas, where elevated levels of the
pesticide are treatening critical wildlife breeding grounds,
say they believe that the fresh contamination is a result of
American farmers using DDT purchased in Mexico, where it
is still legal. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials said
yesterday that they share that belief.
But an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) spokes
man said yesterday that the culprit may be a pesticide
called Dicofol, legally registered in the United States and
sold under the trade name Kelthane. The pesticide, a com
paratively new product widely used to control mites and
other insects on citrus trees, flowers, ornamental shrubs
and vegetables, contains 7 percent or more DDT, which
stands for dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane.
EPA spokesman Al Meier said the DDT apparently is an
unwanted byproduct when Dicofol is manufactured. Meier
said he didn't know if the EPA was aware of the contami
nation when it registered Dicofol, "but we know it now."

1983 Soviet economy improves
M >scow — The Soviet economy improved in 1983 under
Yur Andropov, but Western analysts say that might be
temporary and cite Andropov's prolonged absence from
public view as a factor
l ull 1983 economic figures from the Central Statistical
Board published in Pravda and other papers yesterday
showed a 3.5 percent gain in industrial labor productivity
after Andropov's call for more discipline, compared with
1 percent in 1982.
industrial output rose 4 percent, passing the target of
percent, and commentaries said 88 percent of the in
crease c.ime from improved discipline. Agriculture also re
ported an increase, with labor productivity up by 6 percent

woes

Agriculture estimated last year that the 1983 Soviet har

estimate of 180 million metric tons, but short of the 1983

Reagan unlikely to receive
line-item veto authority
Washington — President Reagan's aides warned him
before his State of the Union address that the constitu
tion. il amendment giving him line-item veto authority was
unlikely to be adopted by Congress, would meet ratifica
tion resistance in the states and in any case would not be
approved in time to cut federal spending any time soon.
As a possible alternative to the line-item veto, his aides
suggested a statutory approach — enacting regular legisla
tion to increase his power to "rescind" congressional appro
priations, according to a White House background paper
obtained by The Washington Post.
I hey noted that such a proposal, by Sen. William
Armstrong (R-Colo.) had come within three votes of
passing the Senate in November, even without presidential
support.
Reagan, however, went against his aides' advice and pro
posed the line-item veto because it is a stronger election
year symbol of his resolve to cut the federal budget and a
device he used as governor of California, according to White
House officials.
But White House and congressional budget experts note
that most of the federal budget would be out of reach of
line-item veto because more than 80 percent of it is
composed of entitlement programs such as Social Security,
interest on the national debt and the defense budget,
items that cannot be cut or that Reagan does not want to
cut.
Rising DDT levels found
Washington — DDT has been turning up in increasing con
centrations in California and other Western states, sug
gesting that a pesticide banned by the government 12 years
ago following publication of Rachel Carson's book. Silent
Spring, is creeping back into the United States.
Officials here and in Texas, where elevated levels of the
pesticide are treatening critical wildlife breeding grounds,
say they believe that the fresh contamination is a result of
American farmers using DDT purchased in Mexico, where it
is still legal. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials said
yesterday that they share that belief.
But an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) spokes
man said yesterday that the culprit may be a pesticide
called Dicofol, legally registered in the United States and
sold under the trade name Kelthane. The pesticide, a com
paratively new product widely used to control mites and
other insects on citrus trees, flowers, ornamental shrubs
and vegetables, contains 7 percent or more DDT, which
stands for dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane.
EPA spokesman Al Meier said the DDT apparently is an
unwanted byproduct when Dicofol is manufactured. Meier
said he didn't know if the EPA was aware of the contami
nation when it registered Dicofol, "but we know it now."
