# Soviets allege U.S. violated SALT 2
## 
### 
Moscow (I.VI) — The Soviet Union
last night charged the United State*
with violating the SAI L 2 agreement
and said it had evidence that Washing
ton had failed to comply with a series
of other arms-control agreements.
The charges were contained in a So
viet diplomatic presentation to the
U.S. Stale Department made "a few
days ago" and made public by the gov -
ernment news agency T ass.
In an extraordinary move, die Soviet
government made public the full text
of its diplomatic note to coincide with
President Reagan's announcement that
he will seek another term. Both the
timing and the content of the Soviet
note appear to symbolize a further
deterioration in Soviet-American rela
tions.
The Soviet document contained alle
gations that the United States has
violated both SALT 1 and SAI T 2
treaties, which place limitations on the
Soviet and American offensive strate
gic arsenals. It also claims that the
United States was circumventing provi
sions of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile

treaty and even violating the 1963 Lim
ited Test Ban Tieaty.
I he document strongly suggested
that these alleged violations, placed in
the context of Reagan's military and
foreign policies, have placed into doubt
the entire process ot arms control.
The document said "such negative ac
tions have snowballed" despite private
Sov iet expressions ol concern to Wash
ington over the years.
Political observers here could not
recall a similar Soviet action when Mos
cow publicized the full contents of a
diplomatic presentation.
Last night's distribution of the So
viet note appears in part designed to
counter recent American charges that
the Soviet Union had violated several
arms control agreements. The docu
ment said the U.S. charges, "are un
tenable and can qualify as being openly
directed at worsening Soviet-American
relations."
The timing of the Lass disclosure was
interpreted by observers here as an ef
fort to press the issue of war and peace
to the forefront of the U.S. election

campaign.
In a television interview Saturday
night the Kremlin's top spokesman.
Leonid Zamyatin, predicted that the
question of war and peace will be one ol
the key issues 111 the presidential elec
tions.
The Soviet note included the follow
ing charges:
• It described as "direct violations" of
the 1979 SALT 2 treaty an alleged U.S.
failure to work out solutions regarding
long-range land and sea-based cruise
missiles as specified in the protocol to
the treaty.
• The deployment in Western Europe
of Pershing 2 and long-range cruise
missiles violated a provision of SALT 2
"prohibiting circumvention of the
treaty through any other state or
states" or in any other manner includ
ing international commitments con
tradicting the treaty.
It said the new American
medium-range missiles "are an obvious
addition to the strategic offensive ar
senal of the United States."
The State Department last week

noted that there is "no basis" for the
charge that the missile deployments in
Europe constitute a violation of eithei
the unratified SALT 2, or its protocol,
since the missiles don't qualify as
••strategic" missiles.
The U.S. comments came in response
to 11 accusation, made by Soviet Lt
Gen. Viktor Starodubov in an interview
with The Washington Post, similar to
one released by Tass Sunday night.
• The Soviet note charged the United
States with violating the 1972 SALT 1
agreement by introducing "the practice
of using shelters over its Minuteman 2
and Titan 2 intercontinental ballistic
missile launchers, in contradiction ot
the treaty's verification provisions.
Moreover, Moscow charged that the
shelters were used "to conceal work to
refit these launchers." It charged that
Minuteman 2 launchers have been
modernized to carry mo'e warheads, or
Mulitiple Independently Targeted Re-
Entry Vehicles (MIRV), and that it
may be that it is "MIRVed Minuteman
3 missiles that are really deployed" in
Minuteman 2 silos.
