# U.S. keeps Nevada nuclear testing secret
## 
### 
Washington (LAI) â€” Lhe federal government is
conducting small underground nuclear explosions in
the Nevada desert in secret, apparently reversing a
practice of announcing all such experiments, officials
said yesterday.
Tests of large nuclear devices, the kind that are
felt as earth tremors in Las Vegas, are still being
publicly disclosed, but smaller explosions are not, they
said.
Officials refused to disclose the reasons for the
policy, which they said has been in effect for at least
two years. But several, asking not to be quoted by
name, said the main reason was to complicate the So
viet Union's efforts to gather intelligence about U.S.
nuclear weapons research.
!'he Department of Energy, which administers the
tests at Yucca Flats, 77 miles northwest of Las
Vegas, announced 14 underground nuclear explosions
in 1983. Officials said there had been announced
tests as well, but said they could not divulge how
many.
"It's my understanding that the United States still
announces all significant underground tests," White

House Chief of Staff James Baker said on NBC's
"Meet The Press."
"I'm not in a position to tell you why minor tests
no longer are publicly announced," he added.
"The decision as to which tests would be an
nounced ... is according to technical criteria," said
David Miller, a Department of Energy spokesman at
Yucca Flats. "It's basically a question of what may or
may not be detected by seismic device."
A Department of Defense official, who asked not
to be quoted by name, said the practice of concealing
low-yield nuclear tests might complicate Soviet ef
forts to gather intelligence about U.S. nuclear pro
grams.
"I can't be specific, because you get into a classified
area," he said. But he said it was not clear whether
the Soviet Union was capable of detecting explosions
smaller than five kilotons, the equivalent of 5000
tons of TNT.
The first nuclear bomb, dropped on the Japanese
city of Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1 945, produced an explo
sion estimated between 12 and 15 kilotons.
The New York Times yesterday quoted an uniden

tified Department tit Energy official as saying the
smaller tests were not being revealed because the an
nouncements required considerable work and the in
formation was considered unimportant to the general
public, but Miller said that was not true.
The government has disclosed 410 underground
tests since above-ground explosions were prohibited
by the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty between the
United States, the Soviet Union and other countries.
During the first years after the treaty, smaller ex
plosions, those which Soviet scientists might be
unable to detect with seismic instruments, were of
ten kept secret, officials said.
Then, for a period of several years, apparently in
the 19705, the government disclosed all explosions.
But after Ronald Reagan became president in
the Department of Energy reverted to the earlier
practice, they said.
The 14 tests announced in 1983 represented a drop
from 18 in 1982 and 16 in 1981. However, the federal
budget for testing has increased from $201 million in
fiscal 1981 to $388 million in fiscal 1984, suggesting
that unannounced explosions may have increased.
