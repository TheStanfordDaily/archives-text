Yuri Andropov, back in print
though not in view, called for
"practical" deeds from Washington to
back up the Reagan administration's
conciliatory talk of "constructive
cooperation" in the past few weeks.
The remarks attributed to
Andropov were published last week
in Pravda, the Communist Party
newspaper. They clearly mean that
Moscow wants some sort of response
to its grievance on the deployment
of U.S. Pershing 2 and cruise missiles
in Western Europe. The interview
said that the deployment has greatly
increased tensions.
Andropov called on the West to
"display readiness" to return to the

status quo before the deployment
began. He, in turn, said that the
Soviets would start bargaining on
medium-range missiles again.
Diplomats aren't sure what would
get the Russians to start talking — a
pause in further deployment or an
actual dismantling of missiles already
constructed .
Andropov also called for a nuclear
weapon freeze at present levels, for
Washington to return Moscow's
pledge not to be first to use nuclear
weapons, and for an agreement be
tween NATO and the Warsaw Pact
against the use of force. Govern
ment officials dismissed all of these
as propaganda moves which wouldn't

have any effect and which might
even hurt the West
The day after the Andropov inter
view was published, Reagan had the
opportunity to answer in the State
of the Union address. However he
had no new proposals for the infor
mal arms dialogue between him and
Andropov

William French Smith resigned his
position as attorney general last week.
Pending Senate confirmation hearings.
Presidential Counselor Ldwin Meese
will replace him.
Smith, who has agreed to stay on
at the Justice Department until
Meese is confirmed by the Senate, is
planning to return to California and
private practice.
Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.)
said that hearings may begin this
week. He called Meese ''very well
qualified" for the job.
Those who have been critical of
Smith's positions, especially in civil
rights and antitrust cases weren't so
happy with Meese's nomination. The
Congressional Black Caucus, made up
of Congress' 21 black members, said
that Meese's position in most areas
is, "diametrically opposed to the at
torney general's responsibility of
protecting the constitutional rights
of all Americans."
If Meese is confirmed by the Sen
ate it is expected that some reshuf
fling will occur within the White
House. It is expected to affect
White House Chief of Staff James
Baker, who has had occasional dis
agreements with Meese. Baker will
most likely move into the predomi
nant role among White House aides.

Lebanese Druse soldiers that left the
ranks in September turned down a
government peace offering to take
them back
Prime Minister Shafik al Wazzan
offered to reinstate, without
retribution, 800 Druse officers and
men that left the army when it went
into position against their Druse
countrymen in the Shut' mountains.
An aide to Walid Jumblat, the Druse
leader, rejected the proposal citing
the need for changes in the command
structure of the army and changes in
policies to prevent army involvement
in internal conflicts.
Just before the announcement
Jumblat called for Lebanon's Presi
dent Amin Gcmayel and his govern
ment to resign. Wazzan decided to
proceed with the offer anyway.

Meanwhile, the Reagan administra
tion resumed trying to get $220 million
from Congress to set up an 8000-man
Jordanian force that would put down
insurrections on request from Arab
governments within 1500-mile radius
of Jordan.
King Hussein of Jordan said that
his country welcomes and needs
American military aid but that it
would not be used at the total dis
cretion of the United States. He said
that the military support will be used
to continue Jordan's policy of being a
part of the Arab world and con
cerned for its stability and security.
Hussein also called for the inclu
sion of the Soviet Union. He warned
that Moscow should be included or,
"it will make its presence felt."
Israel opposed this plan last year
and Congress rejected it. However,
this time around Israeli officials
seemed less adamantly opposed.
Asked about the question of Israel,
Hussein emphasized, "should Israel
attack us, then obviously we would
use everything we have to defend
ourselves, but our hope is that the
whole situation can be saved before
it reaches a point of no return."

Despite much opposition, a perma
nently manned space staion was en
dorsed by President Reagan last week
during his annual State of the Union
Address in which he urged the nation
to "follow our dreams to distant
stars"
Everyone from leading scientists

to the Defense Department to the
Office of Management and Budget
opposed the station on the basis of
its unnecessary expense. Scientists
said that it would be more efficient
to use unmanned satellites or a
modified shuttle
The day after the address NASA
unveiled the outlines of the concept
for the new space station. The work
and living space would be made up of
a central area created by the connec
tion of smaller modules that had
been put into space separately.
Crews of six to eight people could be
accomodated living and working on
the station at one time.
The estimated cost is $8 million
for the facility, which left many
wondering how NASA managed to
get approval, especially in a year of
budgetary belt-tightening. The sta
tion does have the support of a num
ber of White House staffers and of
the Commerce Department because
of the feeling that the project will
encourage more commercialization in
space
According to NASA and White
House officials the most important
reason for the project's approval at
this time is the fact that it won't be
allowed to affect the federal budget
in the near future. For about the
first five years of the project the
space agency's budget will only be
allowed to rise 1 percent above the
inflation rate. The first year's ex
penditure will be only $ 150 million.

President Reagan's State of the
Union address last week asked for a bi
partisan budget accord to reduce the
deficit over a period of three years.
The official proposed budget
which Reagan intends to send
Congress this week has a projected
deficit of $180 billion. During his ad
dress the president invited both par
ties in Congress to work together to
come up with spending cuts and tax
increases to produce a deficit reduc
tion of $100 billion over a three-year
period.
At this point however it is unclear
how far the president will go beyond
the budget proposals he will present
this week. News from the White
House is that the president didn't in
tend for the $100 billion in reduc
tions to be "added" to the spending
cuts and minor tax increases Reagan
has proposed for the 1 985 budget.
Democrats don't really know what
to make of the proposal. Some see it
as a political scheme with which the
president hopes to spread the blame
if the deficit reductions don't
amount to anything.
House speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-
Mass.) tried to get the president to
show his cards by asking him to be
more specific on the budget O'Neill
said that no budget accord could
come to be without cuts in the
growth of military spending.

for the downcast. There was no help for the women. There was no help
for the children."
