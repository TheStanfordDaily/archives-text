When Sen. Alan Cranston stopped here
last week for a little fund raising, he
knocked former Vice President Walter Mondale
because, he says, the presidential candidate is
appealing to too many special-interest groups.
The California Democrat said that Mondale has
promised so much to so many that there's no
way to tell what he's going to do if he is elected.
President Reagan, in a speech in Atlanta
Thursday, also pointed a finger at Mondale,
claiming he was trying to "buy support" by
"making promises to several special interest
groups."
You can't really blame Mondale for doing
what he's doing. It's just a product of the way
things work in America.
Mondale crosses the country, talking to peace
activists in Seattle, Hispanic leaders in Los An
geles, farmers in Georgia. Along the way he tells
them what they want to hear, and they promise
him their support.
And it works. Of the Democratic contenders,
Mondale has the biggest campaign treasure
chest — and, the polls say, the biggest pool of

support.
His proinise-everything-to-everyone method
of campaigning is the kind of campaigning that
gets votes and gets money.
Meanwhile, candidates who are less vague,
who offer concrete proposals and are not so
careful to be the least-offensive denominators,
are penalized.
Cranston is a good example. In his speech here
last week, he offered very clear proposals for
arms control and an improved economy.
Cranston said he will work to prevent nuclear
war. He could have stopped there, and most of
the audience would have agreed that preventing
nuclear war is an admirable goal. But he didn't
stop there. He outlined his plan very specifi
cally, pointing out that it included, among other
things, a freeze on U.S. weapons testing.
A proposal as clear as that one probably lost
Cranston a few supporters. But at least when
the 600 people left Kresge that afternoon, they
knew where Cranston stood.
With the promise-everything-to-everyone
candidates, you can never be sure.
