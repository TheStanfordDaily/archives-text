# It's time to reconsider relations in the Mideast
## 
### 
Lying on the desk before me is a motley
assortment of Middle Eastern currency:
wrinkled Egyptian lira notes, Israeli shekels
now barely worth the weight of the coin and
Lebanese piasters imprinted with the symbol
of that tiny country, the stately cedar.
In a way, the fact that these coins are all
arrayed before me is a good omen: It means
that 1 was able to enter all three countries,
carrying the same passport, on a single trip.
It is a small sign that, despite the current
disastrous state of affairs in that turbulent
region, some progress has been made toward
conflict resolution more amicable than the
plan now in progress, which is a gradual level
ing of the entire Middle East.
To the standard question, '"But can there
be real peace?" the answer is not encourag
ing. In this region, the bullet, not the ballot,
breaks political deadlocks, and peace in the
Middle East is the exception proving the
rule. But that is not the proper question to
ask. Never mind the diploma tie niceties of
"peace" (a chimera) and "stability" (an illu
sion). It is in chasing these golden fleeces
that America has made some of its most
serious foreign policy blunders in the Middle
East.
Instead, it would be productive to query,
"Can some sort of reluctant, de facto ac
commodation be reached?" To this question,
the answer is also less than clear, but with
regard to the Arab-Israeli question, a cau
tious "maybe" is within the realm of possi
bility.
It is not even necessary to dwell on the
political issue as reflected in the national
propaganda (i.e. "the Zionists stole our

land" and"it is our historical right and
therefore not yours to steal"). Rather, I'd
like to introduce some of the background
behind the screaming headlines, which may
lend a new perspective to the Westerner's
study of that infernal mess.
One key consideration is often over
looked: Neither the Arab-Israeli nor any
other Middle Eastern conflict exists in a
vacuum. They must be placed in the context
of the Middle East, where alliances and en
mities disappear as rapidly as water in the
desert sands. Inter-Arab rivalries are rife,
and the Moslem world allows very little room
for any religious or ideological deviance.
Therefore, when I write of the possibili
ties that the warring countries will take a
breather, I am not becoming a saccharine
Pollyanna. I am not an armchair liberal who
wishes that "once they get to know each
other, they'll develop mutual respect and
tolerance (and who knows, maybe even
friendship)." Such wishful thinking does not
wash.
Another worthless panacea espoused by
confused liberals is: "Once the societies
modernize (I think they mean 'Westernize,'
surely the greatest of all possible aspira
tions), they will begin to cool off; they'll
base their actions on enlightened self
interest and never go to war when they
would not gain by doing so." Frankly, I doubt
that oil wells spout Lockean liberals or that
from the desert sands bloom blossoms of
tolerance and brotherhood. After all, it is
Beirut, the "Paris of the Middle East," that
is now the center of much of the turbulence.
Despite this, more than 400 foreign jour

nalists are permanently camped on Israel's
doorstep, bound and determined to make
the Arab-Israeli conflict look like the only
quarrel in the Eastern hemisphere. Were
they to pay Israel the attention granted any
other nation of 4 million people, or even
that accorded South Korea (another
recipient of substantial American aid with
political problems), the spotlight would diiii
and the tension would lessen.
Consider the key triangle in the Arab-
Israeli tangle, Israel and her two most pow
erful neighbors, the "confrontation states."
Egypt lost more soldiers in adventures in the
Sudan and Yemen than it did in all its jihads
against Israel, and Syrian President Hafez
Assad murdered more of his own citizens in a
single massacre (Hama, about 10.000 dead)
than all the Israelis the Syrians have killed in
nearly 40 years of overt and guerrilla
warfare.
Of course, no part of this killing fiesta
would have been possible on such a grand
scale without the active aid of the Soviet
Union. Before 1955, when the first massive
shipments of Soviet arms arrived in Egypt,
fewer people were killed in each war. terror
ist training wasn't nearly as sophisticated as
it is today and every tiff did not fan worries
of a superpower confrontation. For itself,
America must maintain a low profile, but it
also must keep a vigilant eye on Soviet
maneuvers in the region.
Tolerance for religious diversity is not one
of the Middle East's strong points. A
Lebanese friend of mine here once matter
of-factly gave a chilling example of this un
fortunate predilection. "How would you

feel," he asked (rhetorically, 1 hope), "if one
of your best friends was delivered to your
doorstep in 30 pieces just because he was
Christian?"
Placed in this perspective, then, it is not
at all surprising that the Arab world and Is
rael have difficulty getting along.
Nevertheless, for all the hysterical
protestations to the contrary, expedience
has on occasion taken precedence over offi
cial rigidity. To indulge in a bit of hyperbole,
sometimes it seems as if Israel does better
trade with her enemies than she does with
her friends. While exports to Europe and
elsewhere have declined since the late '70s,
and trade with Egypt continues nearly as
sluggishly as it began, Israel is doing a
booming arms trade with sworn enemy Iran.
Israel's Good Fence border with Lebanon
does expedience one better: It has a friendly
tone. Despite the fact that the two have
officially been at war since 1948, in practice
their relations have been quite tolerable.
This is largely attributable to the constant
Christian-Moslem tensions: Two minorities
of the Middle East drew together. Never
theless, Lebanese civilians have in recent
years freely crossed the border to work,
receive medical treatment, or visit families
in Israel; until the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization (PLO) upset the Christian-
Moslem equilibrium in the early 19705,
border "incidents ' were rare.
While Israel and Lebanon may never sign a
peace treaty, they have been able to achieve
something far more important: a good rela
tionship. When Israeli troops went into
Lebanon in spring 1982, the hostility which

greeted them from the PLO was 180 degrees
removed from their reception by the
Lebanese Christians. Israeli student/soldier
friends brought back poignant tales from
Lebanon. "When we entered one village,"
recalled my friend Yoav, "we were showered
with rice and flowers, as had been the case in
every other Christian village. But here, a
little girl — about six — ran up to me, threw
her arms around my leg, and wouldn't let me
go. 1 had to let her follow along with me, and
she just clung to my knee."
The Lebanese, then, had a good, pragmatic
reason to keep the border relatively un
troubled. Good, pragmatic reasons like self
preservation have helped to keep another
"confrontation border" quiet.
Hugs and rapprochements aside. King Hus
sein of Jordan keeps a tight rein on the PLO
in order to prevent a repeat of "Black Sep
tember" 1970, where his troops barely
prevented an outright takeover, or 1952,
when his grandfather. King Abdullah, was as
sassinated.
Well, what of it? Will enlightened self
interest win out and bring peace and
stability, or at least a longer breathing space
between rounds, to Iran and Iraq, Egypt and
Libya. Lebanon and Syria? The likely answer
is yes — a breathing space reminiscent of
Christmas in "All Quiet on the Western
Front." The warriors relax together for a day
in a spirit of camaraderie — but the follow
ing day climb back into their trenches and
resume killing each other.

wrinkled Egyptian lira notes, Israeli shekels
now barely worth the weight of the coin and
Lebanese piasters imprinted with the symbol
of that tiny country, the stately cedar.
In a way, the fact that these coins are all
arrayed before me is a good omen: It means
that 1 was able to enter all three countries,
carrying the same passport, on a single trip.
It is a small sign that, despite the current
disastrous state of affairs in that turbulent
region, some progress has been made toward
conflict resolution more amicable than the
plan now in progress, which is a gradual level
ing of the entire Middle East.
To the standard question, '"But can there
be real peace?" the answer is not encourag
ing. In this region, the bullet, not the ballot,
breaks political deadlocks, and peace in the
Middle East is the exception proving the
rule. But that is not the proper question to
ask. Never mind the diploma tie niceties of
"peace" (a chimera) and "stability" (an illu
sion). It is in chasing these golden fleeces
that America has made some of its most
serious foreign policy blunders in the Middle
East.
Instead, it would be productive to query,
"Can some sort of reluctant, de facto ac
commodation be reached?" To this question,
the answer is also less than clear, but with
regard to the Arab-Israeli question, a cau
tious "maybe" is within the realm of possi
bility.
It is not even necessary to dwell on the
political issue as reflected in the national
propaganda (i.e. "the Zionists stole our

land" and"it is our historical right and
therefore not yours to steal"). Rather, I'd
like to introduce some of the background
behind the screaming headlines, which may
lend a new perspective to the Westerner's
study of that infernal mess.
One key consideration is often over
looked: Neither the Arab-Israeli nor any
other Middle Eastern conflict exists in a
vacuum. They must be placed in the context
of the Middle East, where alliances and en
mities disappear as rapidly as water in the
desert sands. Inter-Arab rivalries are rife,
and the Moslem world allows very little room
for any religious or ideological deviance.
Therefore, when I write of the possibili
ties that the warring countries will take a
breather, I am not becoming a saccharine
Pollyanna. I am not an armchair liberal who
wishes that "once they get to know each
other, they'll develop mutual respect and
tolerance (and who knows, maybe even
friendship)." Such wishful thinking does not
wash.
Another worthless panacea espoused by
confused liberals is: "Once the societies
modernize (I think they mean 'Westernize,'
surely the greatest of all possible aspira
tions), they will begin to cool off; they'll
base their actions on enlightened self
interest and never go to war when they
would not gain by doing so." Frankly, I doubt
that oil wells spout Lockean liberals or that
from the desert sands bloom blossoms of
tolerance and brotherhood. After all, it is
Beirut, the "Paris of the Middle East," that
is now the center of much of the turbulence.
Despite this, more than 400 foreign jour

nalists are permanently camped on Israel's
doorstep, bound and determined to make
the Arab-Israeli conflict look like the only
quarrel in the Eastern hemisphere. Were
they to pay Israel the attention granted any
other nation of 4 million people, or even
that accorded South Korea (another
recipient of substantial American aid with
political problems), the spotlight would diiii
and the tension would lessen.
Consider the key triangle in the Arab-
Israeli tangle, Israel and her two most pow
erful neighbors, the "confrontation states."
Egypt lost more soldiers in adventures in the
Sudan and Yemen than it did in all its jihads
against Israel, and Syrian President Hafez
Assad murdered more of his own citizens in a
single massacre (Hama, about 10.000 dead)
than all the Israelis the Syrians have killed in
nearly 40 years of overt and guerrilla
warfare.
Of course, no part of this killing fiesta
would have been possible on such a grand
scale without the active aid of the Soviet
Union. Before 1955, when the first massive
shipments of Soviet arms arrived in Egypt,
fewer people were killed in each war. terror
ist training wasn't nearly as sophisticated as
it is today and every tiff did not fan worries
of a superpower confrontation. For itself,
America must maintain a low profile, but it
also must keep a vigilant eye on Soviet
maneuvers in the region.
Tolerance for religious diversity is not one
of the Middle East's strong points. A
Lebanese friend of mine here once matter
of-factly gave a chilling example of this un
fortunate predilection. "How would you

feel," he asked (rhetorically, 1 hope), "if one
of your best friends was delivered to your
doorstep in 30 pieces just because he was
Christian?"
Placed in this perspective, then, it is not
at all surprising that the Arab world and Is
rael have difficulty getting along.
Nevertheless, for all the hysterical
protestations to the contrary, expedience
has on occasion taken precedence over offi
cial rigidity. To indulge in a bit of hyperbole,
sometimes it seems as if Israel does better
trade with her enemies than she does with
her friends. While exports to Europe and
elsewhere have declined since the late '70s,
and trade with Egypt continues nearly as
sluggishly as it began, Israel is doing a
booming arms trade with sworn enemy Iran.
Israel's Good Fence border with Lebanon
does expedience one better: It has a friendly
tone. Despite the fact that the two have
officially been at war since 1948, in practice
their relations have been quite tolerable.
This is largely attributable to the constant
Christian-Moslem tensions: Two minorities
of the Middle East drew together. Never
theless, Lebanese civilians have in recent
years freely crossed the border to work,
receive medical treatment, or visit families
in Israel; until the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization (PLO) upset the Christian-
Moslem equilibrium in the early 19705,
border "incidents ' were rare.
While Israel and Lebanon may never sign a
peace treaty, they have been able to achieve
something far more important: a good rela
tionship. When Israeli troops went into
Lebanon in spring 1982, the hostility which

greeted them from the PLO was 180 degrees
removed from their reception by the
Lebanese Christians. Israeli student/soldier
friends brought back poignant tales from
Lebanon. "When we entered one village,"
recalled my friend Yoav, "we were showered
with rice and flowers, as had been the case in
every other Christian village. But here, a
little girl — about six — ran up to me, threw
her arms around my leg, and wouldn't let me
go. 1 had to let her follow along with me, and
she just clung to my knee."
The Lebanese, then, had a good, pragmatic
reason to keep the border relatively un
troubled. Good, pragmatic reasons like self
preservation have helped to keep another
"confrontation border" quiet.
Hugs and rapprochements aside. King Hus
sein of Jordan keeps a tight rein on the PLO
in order to prevent a repeat of "Black Sep
tember" 1970, where his troops barely
prevented an outright takeover, or 1952,
when his grandfather. King Abdullah, was as
sassinated.
Well, what of it? Will enlightened self
interest win out and bring peace and
stability, or at least a longer breathing space
between rounds, to Iran and Iraq, Egypt and
Libya. Lebanon and Syria? The likely answer
is yes — a breathing space reminiscent of
Christmas in "All Quiet on the Western
Front." The warriors relax together for a day
in a spirit of camaraderie — but the follow
ing day climb back into their trenches and
resume killing each other.
