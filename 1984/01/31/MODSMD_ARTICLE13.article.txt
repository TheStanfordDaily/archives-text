# AGAR AND NAGAREDA
## Changing the shade of Harvard's crimson 
### 
The Daily recently reprinted an ar
ticle from The Harvard Crimson in
which Paul Choi and Clark Freshman
expressed their dismay at the results
of the U.S. News and World Report
survey of college presidents. The sur
vey indicated that 47.6 percent of
the college presidents named Har
vard as one of the five best places for
undergraduate education. From this,
the authors correctly concluded that

VIEWPOINT

52.4 percent of the respondents did
not rank Harvard so highly. However,
from this factual premise, the aut
hors proceed to attack everything
from the intellectual abilities of col
lege presidents to the merits of out
door recreation. We certainly do not
believe that all Harvard students
share the authors' academic myopia,
but the fact that there are even a
few cases indicates the need for some
type of response.
The Harvard-centric view of the
universe may be comforting to some,
but it does not accurately reflect the
status of higher education in the
United States. Perhaps as recently as
a generation ago, this position could
have been plausibly forwarded and
indeed was forwarded by many
educators nationwide. But, like the
balance of political power, the bal
ance of education prestige has
changed. Today, a qualified high
school graduate can obtain a first
rate college education at Harvard,
Stanford, Yale, and, yes, even
Berkeley (to name but a few institu
tions.)
In essence, the authors argue that
everything beyond a five-mile radius
around Harvard Square is simply in
valid, inferior and not worthy of
serious discussion. Thus, they must
vainly attack the qualifications of
college presidents who, by the way,

are far more qualified to judge the
merits of the various universities
than are Choi and Freshman. To par
aphrase the authors' words: "Let's
face it: Most college presidents are
comedians, illiterates and (worst of
all) rejects from Harvard."
To resolve this ideological clash,
the authors state: "We need replace
ments for these men (and women)."
Well, at least they acknowledge that
women can be college presidents too.
Choi and Freshman's view may be
"snide" and "arrogant" (they said it,
not us) but it is certainly not the
"Veritas."
Just as President Reagan has diffi
culty understanding that the United
States is no longer the only interna
tional power, the authors cannot ac
cept a "multi-polar system" of
universities. They devote most of
their attack on other colleges to
Stanford, presumably because is was
rated negligibly higher in the college
president's poll. Indeed, more than
half of these presidents did not rank
Stanford among the "top five," but
we certainly didn't throw a tantrum.
The authors' complaints of frisbees
and golf at Stanford sound a bit like
sour grapes. It's hard to hit a five
iron in the snow, you know.
In talking about Princeton, Choi
and Freshman state that its "shuttle
buses don't even run to New York
City, let alone Harvard Square,"
clearly implying that, in terms of
being a cosmopolitan locale. Harvard
Square has it all over the Big Apple.
Well, you can't fool us. We've been
to Harvard Square.
And lest you think we were among
the 12,000 who were summarily
rejected from Harvard's class of
1985, think again. We weren't.
