## Many foreign students stay in United States 
### 
Recent surveys of the origin of
students in our department show
that approximately half are foreign.
This observation can easily be inter
preted to imply that an equal
proportion of our educational ef
fort is transferred to foreign
countries. An analysis of where the
students go after obtaining their
education will show a very different
balance. .
I have never encouraged any of my
students to stay in this country. The
majority of them have, often quite
unexpectedly, decided to work in
this country. The effect of the
aggregate migration of highly
recruited individuals is complex. A
survey of Silicon Valley industry is
sure to show a significant foreign
population and at least an equiva
lent contribution to its productivity
The migration has certainly some
negative global aspects as well. We
arc losing potential ambassadors and
communicators.
In general, easily obtained snap
shots of the situation can make
impressive pictures, but not reveal
true effects.

I wa nappy to read the very com
plete Stanford Daily story about
ESP research in the Jan. 23 issue.
Among other things, it dealt with
our own research into psychic abili
ties and our recent trip to the So
viet Union to discuss this work with
the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
The story also mentioned that I

have written a book on psychic
research with psychologist Keith
Harary and that the book is due to
be released in a month.
So far so good. Unfortunately the
name of the book was given as
"Mind Reach," which is the title of
a book that I co-authored in 1977
with Hal Puthoff. The title of the
new book is "The Mind Race: Un
derstanding and Using Psychic Abili
ties." It is published by
Villard/Random House and deals
with our most recent work as out
lined in the otherwise very accurate
article. Many thanks for your help in
clearing this up.
Russell Targ
Palo Alto resident
Reagan center
In his viewpoint of Jan. 27, Dennis
Bark of the Hoover Institution
expressed his desire to have a Ronald
Reagan center for public affairs at
Stanford. He argued that the center
will be a non-partisan organization
devoted to the "objective search for
knowledge" and thus should not be
discussed in political terms. This
view is deluded for two reasons.
First, public policy by definition
has to do with the pursuit of
defined political ends. The study of
policy cannot be objective; we must
always ask. " Whose ends are being
pursued?"
Second, the ends of the Reagan
center will be those of its funders.
They will withdraw financial support
if they feel they are not getting
their money's worth. Thus we must
ask, "Who will fund the Ronald
Reagan Library Foundation?" I

submit that contributors will be
those who support President Reagan
and his political philosophy.
The proposed Reagan center
would of necessity be a political
entity and must be discussed in
political terms. The question facing

us is "Does the Stanford community
want a second distinguished conser
vative think-tank associated with
the University?"
