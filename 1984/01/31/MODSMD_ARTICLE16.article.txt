## ACT resurrects rare Ibsen classic 
### DUN GIFFORD, JR 
As easy as it may be to deem this unknown Henrik
Ibsen work irrelevant, beware: The aging, 19th
century playwright exposed the curses of industrial
society that still perplex us today.
No one will fail to identify with the central charac
ter who, in his old age, is haunted by his decision when
young to secure a shady business deal rather than
marry the rich beautiful woman who loved him.
The ACT in San Francisco has magnificently
resurrected this difficult Ibsen classic, "John Gabriel
Borkman," and has successfully infused its bulky
metaphors with frightening vitality.
Ibsen wrote this play after many years abroad, a
time that gave him enough distance from his
homeland to produce such a rich tapestry of sym
bolism and realism.
This juxtaposition of the figurative and the real
presents a challenge to both the director and the ac
tors who must not overemphasize the symbolic and
become unemotional, nor the real and become overly
melodramatic.
But the veteran Ibsen director. Allen Fletcher, the
translator and director of five Ibsen plays, has deftly
overcome this difficulty: His players treat the sym
bolic with caustic wit and the genuine with emotional
intimacy.
Perhaps the strongest performance of the play is by
Marrian Walters as Mrs. Borkman, the wife of the

the great industrialist who tries to prevent her twin
sister from taking back the Borkman's son.
Walters has managed to evoke the inner emotional
conflict that she so cold- heartedly supresses and that
typifies the great Ihsen characters.
Getting nowhere with Mrs. Borkman, the twin
sister approaches Borkman himself in the salon of his
self-exile. She discloses her earlier love for him and
unsuccessfully tries to persuade him of his folly in
sacrificing love for success.
Having hit a soft spot, she is on the verge of con
vincing him that Erhardt belongs to her when Mrs.
Borkman, who has been listening, bursts in to give her
side of the story. They are back to square one.
Meanwhile, Borkman has decided to forgive himself
and comes to his wife for understanding. After eight
years of separation she is less than enthusiastic at his
appearance. ' What does he want?" she asks, denying
the exoneration he seeks.
Borkman, though, sees it differently. "The verdict
is that the only person that I have committed a crime
against is myself."
William Patterson plays a classic Borkman, capable
of supreme wit, forceful characterization and emo
tional intensity. Borkman's ultimate fate is to come
to terms with his capitalistic drive, but to be in
capable of altering it. Paterson is able to sustain this
single, powerful persona.

The twin sisters, however, continue their life-and
death struggle for Erhardt until he surprises them
both with his own decision. Nicholas Kaledin should
have been more assertive as Erhardt. who makes a
decision that his father could not — one that the
aging Ibsen saw as basic to a happy life.
The most artful scene in the play takes place be
tween Borkman and his only confidant, Vilhelm Fol
dal (Dakin Matthews). Here, Foldal dares to cut off
his friendship with the haughty Borkman after having
been ridiculed by this long-time friend. Matthews' in
terpretation of Foldal is to be praised for its chilling
poignancy and precision.
Barbara Dirickson's seductive and playful Fanny
Wilton, Erhardt's lover, effectively enlivens the dim
atmosphere of the Borkman household and
epitomizes the frolicsome lifestyle never known to
Borkman and his wife.
This performance abounds with another delight:
Fletcher's translation, which has exchanged the
awkwardness of literal translation for a lucid poetry
of the vernacular that achieves immediacy without
obscuring Ibsen's subtle metaphors.
Ralph Funicello's set designs, vertical rows of blue
lit rope that rise and fall at varying depths on the
stage, perform the double task of removing scenes
and adding a touch of eerie minimalism.
In all, this is a respectable performance of a rare
play whose relevancy surprises and edifies.
