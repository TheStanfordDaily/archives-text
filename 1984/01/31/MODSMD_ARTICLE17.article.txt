# 'Tosca': a more personable production
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
If you're waiting around for
the San Francisco Opera's sum
mer season, try Palo Alto's
West Bay Opera company,
which is now presenting
Giacomo Puccini's "Tosca." Es
tablished in 1955, the company
serves as a showcase for young
American singers who are at
the beginning of their careers
— and wish to study with music
director David Ramadanoff —
or professionals who want to
slow down their careers. None
of the singers are paid, and
with two different casts for
each opera, a greater number
of artists can participate.
Characteristically Puccini,
"Tosca" is an emotionally
charged opera where action
dominates; there are no ex
tended arias, although the
opera still requires expertise
from the tenor and soprano
leads.
Angelotti, a political pris
oner, escapes and hides at the
Attavanti chapel, where artist
Mario Cavaradossi is painting a
portrait of Mary Magdalene.
Angelotti reveals himself to
Mario (who promises to aid
him), but hides again when
Tosca visits Mario, her lover.
Tosca is angry with the artist
for making her wait, and she
immediately becomes jealous
and suspicious of the portrait,
which bears a resemblance to
the Marchesa Attavanti. But

Mario assuages her temper and
the two arrange to meet later.
Still, her parting words are
"but let her eyes be black
ones."
After Tosca leaves, Angelot
ti emerges with a bundle of wo
man's clothing for his disguise,
left by his sister, the same
Marchesa Attavanti. Mario
goes with Angelotti to hide
him.
Soon, Roman police chief
Scarpia strides into the chapel
to search for the escaped pris
oner; he finds a lady's fan, just
as Tosca comes looking for
Mario again. With this he
arouses her jealousy by in
sinuating that Mario had more
to do with the woman in the
portrait. Tosca's anger is fired,
and when she rushes off to
confront Mario, Scarpia orders
her followed.
Angelotti is not found, but
Mario is arrested and brought
in for interrogation. Scarpia
sends for Tosca and informs
her that she can save her lover
great pain if she reveals An
gelotti's hiding place. At
Mario's tortured screams,
Tosca breaks down and reveals
the secret.
Mario denounces Scarpia,
and Scarpia orders him ex
ecuted at dawn. Meanwhile, his
men announce Angelotti's
suicide. Tosca asks the price for
Mario's life, and Scarpia
demands the price of her
honor. She is horrified, but

consents, provided that Mario
is released immediately.
Scarpia insists that a mock
execution must take place.
Tosca agrees, but demands a
pass out of Rome. As Scarpia
writes, she finds and conceals a
knife. As he approaches her,
she kills him, takes the pass,
and flees to find Mario.
She finds him and shows him
the safe conduct, and the two
sing of a lifetime of happiness.
Tosca urges him to fall down
realistically when he hears the
shot, to be a good actor. When
the soldiers leave, freedom will
be theirs.
The firing squad arrives, and
Tosca hides. Mario bravely
refuses the blindfold and does
indeed fall convincingly. Tosca
waits impatiently for the sol
diers to leave, all the while
whispering for Mario not to
get up too soon. She inches
forward to tell him that the
men have left and screams at
the horrible realization that he
is dead, that the bullets were
real.
Just then, Scarpia's murder is
discovered, and his men rush
toward her, "Tosca, you shall
pay most dearly for his life!"
She turns, "With my own!",
and leaps off the parapet. The
curtain descends upon the
shock of Scarpia's men.
A highly dramatic work,
"Tosca" demands the atten
tion and involvement of the
audience; the West Bay per

mance in the small and inti
mate Lucie Stern Theater al
lows everyone to see the facial
expressions and to feel the
force of Ramadanoffs musical
direction.
Although the production is
basically sound, the singing of
the opening night cast was un
even. Michael Taylor was
noteworthy as police chief
Scarpia, combining both strong
singing and acting. His contin
uous menacing presence on
stage never overwhelmed the
scene, but, rather, comple
mented the other characters.
Joan Jaques, playing Tosca,
possesses a powerful though
strident voice; she hits the
notes, but there is an edge to
the tone. She did, however,
sing Tosca's aria. "Vissi d'artc,
vosso d'amore" ("1 lived for
art, I lived for love") with con
trol and heartrending expres
sion as she laments the in
justice of life. Acting is
Jaques' strength in this pro
duction of "Tosca"; she has a
demanding role, and she fills it
well as the flamboyant diva.
The portrayal of Mario
Cavaradossi, also a demanding
role, was unfortunately not a.s
successfully played or sung by
Timothy Driesel. Although he
has a beautiful tenor voice,
Driesel lacked both volume and
consistency. There were parts,
such as his opening lines prais
ing Tosca, where the tones
were clear and fluent. Then

again, in Mario's aria, "E
lucevan le stelle ed olezzuva"
("And the stars shone and the
earth was perfumed"), Driesel
did not sustain the high notes
or the flow of the phrase. This
detracted from the nostalgic
and emotional intensity of the
moment.
What is most impressive
about the West Bay Opera's
production is its emphasis on
acting, something often ne
glected by other companies in
their search for the voice-as
role. West Bay concentrates on
telling the story to the audi
ence, and, thus, small character
parts such as the priest
(Anthony Cuevas) are high
lighted, enhancing the plot.
"Tosca" is fast-paced and
West Bay keeps it moving. This
production treats opera on the
smaller and more personable
scale, not without inadequacies
of cast and, sometimes,
crowded staging. But it still
makes an altogether enjoyable
evening.

ence, and, thus, small character
parts such as the priest
(Anthony Cuevas) are high
lighted, enhancing the plot.
"Tosca" is fast-paced and
West Bay keeps it moving. This
production treats opera on the
smaller and more personable
scale, not without inadequacies
of cast and, sometimes,
crowded staging. But it still
makes an altogether enjoyable
evening.

If you're waiting around for
the San Francisco Opera's sum
mer season, try Palo Alto's
West Bay Opera company,
which is now presenting
Giacomo Puccini's "Tosca." Es
tablished in 1955, the company
serves as a showcase for young
American singers who are at
the beginning of their careers
— and wish to study with music
director David Ramadanoff —
or professionals who want to
slow down their careers. None
of the singers are paid, and
with two different casts for
each opera, a greater number
of artists can participate.
Characteristically Puccini,
"Tosca" is an emotionally
charged opera where action
dominates; there are no ex
tended arias, although the
opera still requires expertise
from the tenor and soprano
leads.
Angelotti, a political pris
oner, escapes and hides at the
Attavanti chapel, where artist
Mario Cavaradossi is painting a
portrait of Mary Magdalene.
Angelotti reveals himself to
Mario (who promises to aid
him), but hides again when
Tosca visits Mario, her lover.
Tosca is angry with the artist
for making her wait, and she
immediately becomes jealous
and suspicious of the portrait,
which bears a resemblance to
the Marchesa Attavanti. But

Mario assuages her temper and
the two arrange to meet later.
Still, her parting words are
"but let her eyes be black
ones."
After Tosca leaves, Angelot
ti emerges with a bundle of wo
man's clothing for his disguise,
left by his sister, the same
Marchesa Attavanti. Mario
goes with Angelotti to hide
him.
Soon, Roman police chief
Scarpia strides into the chapel
to search for the escaped pris
oner; he finds a lady's fan, just
as Tosca comes looking for
Mario again. With this he
arouses her jealousy by in
sinuating that Mario had more
to do with the woman in the
portrait. Tosca's anger is fired,
and when she rushes off to
confront Mario, Scarpia orders
her followed.
Angelotti is not found, but
Mario is arrested and brought
in for interrogation. Scarpia
sends for Tosca and informs
her that she can save her lover
great pain if she reveals An
gelotti's hiding place. At
Mario's tortured screams,
Tosca breaks down and reveals
the secret.
Mario denounces Scarpia,
and Scarpia orders him ex
ecuted at dawn. Meanwhile, his
men announce Angelotti's
suicide. Tosca asks the price for
Mario's life, and Scarpia
demands the price of her
honor. She is horrified, but

consents, provided that Mario
is released immediately.
Scarpia insists that a mock
execution must take place.
Tosca agrees, but demands a
pass out of Rome. As Scarpia
writes, she finds and conceals a
knife. As he approaches her,
she kills him, takes the pass,
and flees to find Mario.
She finds him and shows him
the safe conduct, and the two
sing of a lifetime of happiness.
Tosca urges him to fall down
realistically when he hears the
shot, to be a good actor. When
the soldiers leave, freedom will
be theirs.
The firing squad arrives, and
Tosca hides. Mario bravely
refuses the blindfold and does
indeed fall convincingly. Tosca
waits impatiently for the sol
diers to leave, all the while
whispering for Mario not to
get up too soon. She inches
forward to tell him that the
men have left and screams at
the horrible realization that he
is dead, that the bullets were
real.
Just then, Scarpia's murder is
discovered, and his men rush
toward her, "Tosca, you shall
pay most dearly for his life!"
She turns, "With my own!",
and leaps off the parapet. The
curtain descends upon the
shock of Scarpia's men.
A highly dramatic work,
"Tosca" demands the atten
tion and involvement of the
audience; the West Bay per

mance in the small and inti
mate Lucie Stern Theater al
lows everyone to see the facial
expressions and to feel the
force of Ramadanoffs musical
direction.
Although the production is
basically sound, the singing of
the opening night cast was un
even. Michael Taylor was
noteworthy as police chief
Scarpia, combining both strong
singing and acting. His contin
uous menacing presence on
stage never overwhelmed the
scene, but, rather, comple
mented the other characters.
Joan Jaques, playing Tosca,
possesses a powerful though
strident voice; she hits the
notes, but there is an edge to
the tone. She did, however,
sing Tosca's aria. "Vissi d'artc,
vosso d'amore" ("1 lived for
art, I lived for love") with con
trol and heartrending expres
sion as she laments the in
justice of life. Acting is
Jaques' strength in this pro
duction of "Tosca"; she has a
demanding role, and she fills it
well as the flamboyant diva.
The portrayal of Mario
Cavaradossi, also a demanding
role, was unfortunately not a.s
successfully played or sung by
Timothy Driesel. Although he
has a beautiful tenor voice,
Driesel lacked both volume and
consistency. There were parts,
such as his opening lines prais
ing Tosca, where the tones
were clear and fluent. Then

again, in Mario's aria, "E
lucevan le stelle ed olezzuva"
("And the stars shone and the
earth was perfumed"), Driesel
did not sustain the high notes
or the flow of the phrase. This
detracted from the nostalgic
and emotional intensity of the
moment.
What is most impressive
about the West Bay Opera's
production is its emphasis on
acting, something often ne
glected by other companies in
their search for the voice-as
role. West Bay concentrates on
telling the story to the audi
ence, and, thus, small character
parts such as the priest
(Anthony Cuevas) are high
lighted, enhancing the plot.
