# Berkeley Rep tries too hard
## 
### MIKE HALE 
Berkeley Repertory Theatre
is currently offering a very
competent, often funny, but
finally unmemorable produc
tion of Clifford Odets'
"Awake and Sing." It isn't un
memorable for the reasons you
might expect; the production
fails to stick in your mind be
cause everything is done so
loudly and forcefully that the
pla> itself — which is wonder
fully subtle — gets submerged.
"Awake and Sing" was first
produced at New York's Group
Theater in Odets wrote a
series of "socially significant"
plays for the Group in the '3()s,
which included "Waiting for
Lefty," "Awake and Sing" and
"Golden Boy." He was hailed
as a revolutionary playwright
at the time, but 50 years later
the leftist elements of
"Awake and Sing" appear to be
what they really are: win
dowdressing. Jacob, the play's
Jewish grandfather, talks on
about the workers' paradise
and such, but talk is all it is; all
anyone in "Awake and Sing"
really wants is a c«.w ob .'. v a
secure v*

The play's charm has nothing
to do with politics and every
thing to do with people: Jacob,
his daughter Bessie Berger (the
play's central force) and her
family.
Odets had a gift for depicting
the small triumphs and dis
asters in his characters' lives;
much of what's happening on
stage goes just below the
surface of the dialogue, and
"Awake and Sing" begs for an
understated, measured, quiet
performance. Director Joy
Carlin's production at Berkeley
Rep is just the opposite — too
much of the dialogue is
shouted, too many dramatic
poses are struck, too many sub
tleties of mood and charac
terization are lost in the
attempt to make everything
loud and clear. Carlin has made
the Berger family into a sort
of TV sitcom version of the
"Jewish family." This has a
beneficial side effect,
however: While some of the
best moments are lost, the
worst ones — when Odets
resorted to purple, as in Ralph
Berger's "wrapped in silks and
speech — don't stand

out like they might otherwise.
The wrongheaded direction is
especially unfortunate in this
case, because the cast as
sembled for "Awake and Sing"
is fine, one of the best I've
seen in a local production. With
the exception of Michael Tulin,
who makes for a peculiarly
Aryan, preppy Ralph Berger,
the cast looks and sounds right,
and it seems likely they could
have made much more of the
play. Joe Bellan. playing Morty,
the rich uncle, manages to
capture just the right note
anyway; but everyone else lets
a touch of caricature slide in.
Tony Amendola, a generally
fine actor, has great presence
as Moe Axelrod, Hennie
Berger's lover, but no sense of
humor; despite his impressive
ness on stage, he's a deadening
influence on the production.
And Suzanne Shepherd, in the
central role of Bessie Berger,
seems to be trying too hard to
get right the mannerisms and
the particular version of
"Jewishness" expected of her;
like the production as a whole,
she's plenty loud, but she lacks
force.
