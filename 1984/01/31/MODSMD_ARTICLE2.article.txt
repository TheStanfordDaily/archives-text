## University-backed bill clears state Assembly 
### KATHY OLMSTED Daily staff 
Amid strenuous opposition from
animal rights lobbyists and equally
vehement support from Stanford
and other research institutions, the
state Assembly yesterday passed a
bill that would permit the limited
use of pound animals for biomedical
research.
The measure, sponsored by As
semblyman William Filante (R-
Greenbrae), passed 46-22. It has
been actively supported by the Uni
versity and other research institu
tions as an alternative to Senate
President Pro Tem David Roberti's
(D-Los Angeles) controversial animal
research bill.
Roberti's bill, currently in the As
sembly's Governmental Organization
Committee, would prohibit the use
of pound animals in research and re
quire researchers to obtain specially
bred animals for experiments. Scien
tists argue that this requirement
would drive up the cost of research
and ultimately cause less research to
be done.
The Filante bill now goes to the
Senate, where it faces art "extremely
difficult" fight, according to Larry
Horton, the University's associate
vice president for public affairs.
Horton said he was pleased that
the Filante bill passed the Assembly
despite the "heavy overtone of emo
tion" and vociferous opposition ex
hibited by animal rights groups. But
he said Roberti's "enormous influ

ence" as the presiding officer of the
Senate might hurt the measure's
chances in that body.
The Filante bill "tries to meet the
stated objectives of the people who
proposed the Roberti bill," Horton
said. The Filante measure says that
pounds which choose to supply
animals for research must allow pet
owners who bring in animals to decide
whether or not the animals could be
used for research. It also prohibits
the research use of any animal picked
up by animal control officials if that
animal is wearing a collar, I.D. tag or
any other evidence of ownership.
The Filante bill also calls for a
study of pet identification to help
owners find lost pets. In addition,
the measure requires that research
facilities include a public member on
animal welfare committees.
Finally, the legislation puts into
state law some federal guidelines on
animal welfare.
Opponents of the bill have claimed
that the law is unnecessary and does
not protect lost pets. These animal
rights groups, particularly the Fund
for Animals, support Roberti's bill as
a means to end animal research in
California.
The Roberti bill would require re
searchers to use animals specifically
bred for research — a requirement
that would quadruple the cost of ob
taining research dogs and cats for 12
California universities, according to a
University of California study.
Literature against the Roberti bill

put out by the University's Public
Affairs Office says the measure
"would prohibit medical researchers
from obtaining any dogs and cats
from pounds — even though those
animals would otherwise be
destroyed."

The University has mobilized
patients who benefit from animal re
search to lobby against the Roberti
bill. For example, heart transplant
patient William Boxberger said in a
letter to his assemblyman that "I will
die unless animal research continues."
The Filante bill has to pass two
Senate committees until it comes
before the entire Senate. The
Roberti bill has already been passed
by the Senate and now needs to be
approved by two Assembly commit
tees before reaching the Assembly
floor.
