Mute Records
Vince Clarke, the electro
pop master behind the early
work of Depeche Mode and
later Yaz, has teamed up
with long-time collaborator
and friend, Eric Radcliffe,
to form a project called The
Assembly.
Never Never is The As
sembly's first single. The
singer (Clarke hopes to have
a different singer for every
single) is Fergal Sharkey of
the late, great Undertones
from Derry, Ireland. The
match of Clarke and
Sharkey was made through a
chance coincidence and a
London gossip column.
Clarke is indeed for
tunate to have Sharkey to
add his force and character
to this lucid ballad. Through

gentle instrumentation and
Sharkey's famous, almost
quavering falsetto vocals,
we are told of a lonely man
whose fantasies never
materialize to unlock his
door to love.
The Assembly, because of
its looseness, is a variable,
dependent on the addition
of a singer, so anything
could happen. With Never
Never, something definitely
did happen. Talk about an
auspicious occasion.
