# Lyric Suite for Sextet
## Chick Corea & Gary Burton 
### 
ECM Records
Lyric Suite for Sextet is a
seven-part Chick Corea
composition, performed by
pianist Corea, vibraharp
player Gary Burton and a
string quartet featuring the
viola, the cello and two
violins. The result is indeed
lyrical — the intricate work
combines the formalities of
composition of classical
music with the improvisa
tional freedom found in
modern jazz.
The achievements of
Corea and Burton are far
too numerous to mention in
this space. The vibraharp
and Gary Burton have
become almost synonymous
over the past two decades
— the 40-year-old musician
has been voted best at his
instrument by the
Downbeat Magazine readers
poll for 16 consecutive
years. Over the same time
period, Chick Corea has es
tablished himself as an inno
vative pianist as well as
composer. Both artists have

played with an incredible ar
ray ot jazz legends, from
Miles Davis to Keith Jarrett
to Stephane Grappelli.
The combination of
Corea, Burton and a string
quartet may leave jazz fans
as well as classical fans in a
quandry — the fact that
elements of both styles can
be found in this work may
not satisfy die-hard fans of
either. If you tend to avoid
labels, though. Lyric Suite
for Sextet is just a very fine
piece of music performed by
a group of talented
musicians.
