# Raiders, Davis go back to court

### 
San Diego (AP) — San Diego Chargers
owner Eugene Klein filed a $33 million suit
against Al Davis and his Super Bowl cham
pion Los Angeles Raiders, accusing Davis
of "intentional infliction of emotional
distress an malicious prosecution" in a
1981 suit fo get the Raiders moved from
Oakland.
Noting that he suffered a heart attack
while testifying to defend himself from
Davis' charges of conspiracy, Klein said in
his suit filed in San Diego County Superior
Court,"The residual effects of that heart
attack continue to the present."
Klein and two other individuals, Los An
geles Rams owner Georgia Frontiere and
National Football League Commissioner
Pete Rozelle, were named as defendants in

Davis' 1981 antitrust suit against the
league.
In 1983, U.S. District Judge Harry
Pregerson, in Los Angeles, dismissed the
suits against the three individuals, saying
there wasn't enough evidence to support a
jury verdict against them.
But the Raiders won the suit against
the NFL and were allowed to move to Los
Angeles.
Seeking $3 million in compensatory da
mages and an additional $30 million in
punitive damages, Klein said in his suit
that Davis' "actions were motivated by
Davis' personal animosity toward Klein
and his desire to coerce Klein."
After filing the suit, Klein's attorney,
Joseph Cotchett, said, "We'd like to see
what the evidence was on which Mr. Davis

filed suit in Los Angeles. I hope he has
some more evidence than he had in Los
Angeles or a jury is going to tell him, "Mr.
Davis, you don't go around filing multi
million dollar lawsuits unless you've got
some evidence.' "
Cotchett added, "Somebody has to
stand up and tell Al Davis he can't use the
courts like a football field."
A spokesman for Davis, who asked not
to be identified, told The Associated Press
that the Raiders haven't seen the suit but
"it sounds like trash, really.
"It sounds like another attempt to
destroy the Raiders competitively and
financially and to keep us in the court
room. They just won't let us get started in
Los Angeles," the spokesman said.
