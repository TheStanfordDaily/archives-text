# Spikers take 6th at UCSB

The Stanford men's volley
ball team may only have
finished sixth at the UC-
Santa Barbara tournament
over the weekend, but what it
learned while there may bene
fit it tremendously.
"We really haven't been
challenged this year. We had a
lot of questions about what
our team is like and what the
other teams are like. This
tournament gave us a chance
to answer some of those ques
tions," Assistant Coach Don
Shaw said.
The tournament was divided
into parts. On Friday, the
teams were placed in round
robin divisions of five teams
each. After the teams finished
the round-robin portion, they
were placed into a champion
ship or consolation bracket
depending on how they did.

The Cardinal finished 4-3
overall in the tournament but
could have been 6-1, according
to Shaw. Stanford's first loss
came on Friday against the
University of
Canada's top-ranked team, 12-
15, 15-0 and 8-15.
"They were the first tough
team we've had to face. The
other teams just weren't that
competitive. If we had been
better prepared we probably
would have taken the first
game and won the match,"
Shaw said.
Stanford won the rest of its
Friday matches — against
UC-San Diego, St. Mary's and
the University of Arizona —
with little trouble.
But the loss to Manitoba may
have cost the team a chance to
finish higher.
The Cardinal was placed in
the championship bracket be

cause of its second-place finish,
but had to face the eventual
champions, UCLA, on Satur
day morning.
UCLA easily disposed of the
Card. 15-5 and 15-4. "They've
got five returning starters
from last year. They're just a
lot farther along already than
the rest of the teams," Shaw
said.
The team then defeated San
Diego State, which put it in
the fifth-place game against
USC. Stanford lost 4-15, 15-8
and 15-17 in what Shaw called
a "tough, hard-fought match."
"It was disappointing to
lose, but now we have a better
idea of how we compare with
the other teams. UCLA is way
ahead of everybody else, but
they're already at their peak.
The other top five teams will
improve more rapidly than they
will," Shaw said.
