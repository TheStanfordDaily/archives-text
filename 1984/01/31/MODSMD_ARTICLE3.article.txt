# Committee supports SCOPE fund transfer
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The Stanford Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE) cleared two hurdles yesterday in
its drive to spend its entire $11,000 budget on a
political conference sponsored by the ASSU
Lobby Office.
The ASSU's Appropriations Committee unani
mously supported SCOPE'S request to co
sponsor the 11 plenary sessions of the
conference, which is planned tor April. It the
ASSU Senate approves the transfer at its
meeting tonight, SCOPE plans to spend $1000
to cover the expenses of each session.
SCOPE scored a second victory after it filed
governing papers with the Office of Student Ac
tivities (OSA), which officially recognized
SCOPE as a voluntary student organization.
Scott Newar, who until recently was the only

member of SCOPE, said he is happy with the Ap
propriation Committee's decision.
"It was a victory long in coming," Newar said.
The distribution of SCOPE'S money to the 11
plenary sessions would benefit many of the
groups that would co-sponsor the sessions with
SCOPE, he said.
John Hoffmire, director of the ASSU Lobby
Office and conference coordinator, said the or
ganizations sponsoring the plenary sessions would
include "almost all campus groups dedicated to
political education."
The plenary sessions would focus on the coming
elections, economic productivity, disarmament,
government and economics, voter registration,
community organizing, South Africa, Central
America, the Middle East, minority issues and
women's issues.
"The fact that we are now funding the plenary

sessions instead of the Lobby Office conference
allows for each group on campus working for poli
tical education to financially benefit," Newar
said. "I think the ASSU wanted to see the funds
distributed this way. They might not have been
as willing to fund the groups as a whole."
Hoffmire said he was not surprised that the
committee supported SCOPE'S request.
"I think the process has shown that the proj
ect has broad support," Hoffmire said.
Last week. SCOPE came under scrutiny from
the ASSU and the OSA after it tried to transfer
the $11,000 remaining in its account to the
Lobby Office. On Jan. 17, ASSU student finan
cial manager Melinda Basham returned the
money to SCOPE and froze its account because
the group failed to outline its
governing structure and budget.
Su Uhland, a member of the Coun
cil of Presidents (COP) and an ex
officio member of the
Appropriations Committee, said the

committee liked SCOPE's plan be
cause it would help fund political
education on campus.
A bill supporting SCOPE's plan,
sponsored by Uhland. COP member
Peter Spivack and ASSU senators
Robert Blum and David Porter, is ex
pected to be voted on by the ASSU
Senate tonight.
"SCOPE had $11,000 that was
raised for political education." Uh

land s;',id. "Our major concern was to
make sure that the money was spent
for the political education of stu
dents. The conference is for all the
student body."
The committee also supported the
plan because SCOPE would be giving
its money to sessions that would be
co-sponsored by other voluntary stu
dent groups, she said.
Ellen Oppenheim, acting director

of OSA, said SCOPE met OSA's
criteria for a voluntary student or
ganization.
"They had a public meeting that
was advertised," Oppenheim said.
"They had people come to the
meeting, they drew up a governing
document, they have formed a steer
ing committee and they have more
than five members in the organiza
tion."
