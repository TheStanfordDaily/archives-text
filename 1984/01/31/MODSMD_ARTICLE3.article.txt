### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The Stanford Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE) cleared two hurdles yesterday in
its drive to spend its entire $11,000 budget on a
political conference sponsored by the ASSU
Lobby Office.
The ASSU's Appropriations Committee unani
mously supported SCOPE'S request to co
sponsor the 11 plenary sessions of the
conference, which is planned tor April. It the
ASSU Senate approves the transfer at its
meeting tonight, SCOPE plans to spend $1000
to cover the expenses of each session.
SCOPE scored a second victory after it filed
governing papers with the Office of Student Ac
tivities (OSA), which officially recognized
SCOPE as a voluntary student organization.
Scott Newar, who until recently was the only

"It was a victory long in coming," Newar said.
The distribution of SCOPE'S money to the 11
plenary sessions would benefit many of the
groups that would co-sponsor the sessions with
SCOPE, he said.
John Hoffmire, director of the ASSU Lobby
Office and conference coordinator, said the or
ganizations sponsoring the plenary sessions would
include "almost all campus groups dedicated to
political education."
The plenary sessions would focus on the coming
elections, economic productivity, disarmament,
government and economics, voter registration,
community organizing, South Africa, Central
America, the Middle East, minority issues and
women's issues.
"The fact that we are now funding the plenary

sessions instead of the Lobby Office conference
allows for each group on campus working for poli
tical education to financially benefit," Newar
said. "I think the ASSU wanted to see the funds
distributed this way. They might not have been
as willing to fund the groups as a whole."
Hoffmire said he was not surprised that the
committee supported SCOPE'S request.
"I think the process has shown that the proj

Last week. SCOPE came under scrutiny from
the ASSU and the OSA after it tried to transfer
the $11,000 remaining in its account to the
Lobby Office. On Jan. 17, ASSU student finan

money to SCOPE and froze its account because
