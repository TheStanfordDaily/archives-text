## Duncan Hines recalls mix 
### KAREN BOLLERMANN Staff writer With wire reports 
Procter & Gamble, Co., in
response to the discovery of eth
ylene dibromide (EDB) contami
nation in some of its products,
declared a complete recall of four
batch numbers of Duncan Hines
muffin mix yesterday.
Many of California's large-chain
grocery stores voluntarily
removed the products from their
shelves late last week, but The
Store at Tresidder Union con
tinues to sell the mixes, which are
believed not to have the chemical
in them.
Procter & Gamble made the
decision to recall the mixes be
cause "the state of California
gave us no choice," according to
Marjorie Bradford, a company
spokesperson. "They said they
would embargo the products un
less we did so voluntarily.'
However. Bradford insisted in a
news conference that the recalled
batches "are safe . . • and will
remain in stores in other states.
EDB is a grain fumigant which
leaves a slight residue on the grain
which is used for the muffin
mixes. Most, if not all. of the resi

due is destroyed during baking,
Procter & Gamble claims. Yet,
despite these claims, scientists say
EDB is one of the most potent
carcinogens in use today.
The Tresidder store's manage
ment remained adamant yester
day that it would not pull the
muffin mixes from its shelves.
"It is a fact that 20,000 deaths
per year are caused by cigarette
smoking, but no one takes
cigarettes off the shelves," said
Ben Esposito, manager of The
Store.
In addition, he said, because no
students had protested for their
removal, the mixes remain on the
shelves.
None of the affected lot num
bers — Spicy Apple Muffin Mix

3223W4, Wild Blueberry Muffin
Mix 3277W4 and Bran Muffin
Mix 3180W4 and 3181W4 — were
on the shelves of The Store yes
terday.
One of the first tainted lots of
the mixes was found at the Ail-
American Market in Palo Alto,
and a number of area stores — in
cluding both Palo Alto and Menlo
Park Safeway stores — pulled all
Duncan Hines muffin mixes from
their shelves as a precautionary
measure last week.
The precautionary measures
taken by the Bay Area Safeway
stores were prompted by custom
er concern. An employee of the
Safeway Public Affairs Office for
for the Bay Area said, "We
received an advisory notice to pull
only those batches that were on
the Agriculture Department's
list." But all listed batches were
removed from the shelves Friday,
so as not to "confuse and alarm
customers," he explained.
A spokesperson at Florence
Moore Food Service said last night
that Stanford Food Service uses
pre-made muffins and is
therefore unaffected by the
recall.
