# SUNet plans to expand LOTS network to all residences
## 
### CAMERON KALLER 
The creation of a communications network that would
eventually link all computer terminals on the Stanford
campus for the transmission of digital data and video
images is well underway.
This project, called Stanford University Networking
(SUNet), is scheduled to be completed sometime in the
next three years.
The main objective of the project "is to greatly im
prove the ability for people to communicate with other
people and to make use of resources located anywhere on
the campus from one terminal," according to Bill Yundt,
director of networking systems.
"It would be just like being at LOTS or an informa
tion library when you're not," according to Glenn
Trewitt, a graduate student involved in the design of
SUNet. The queuing system will still be the same, and
the load will not hold a larger capacity, but access to the
system will be available from many different locations.
"The hope is, too, that we can in fact remove some of
the terminals from the Center for Educational Research
at Stanford (CERAS) because the building has become
much too congested," Trewitt said.
"We hope that in the future," Yundt said, "people
will use their computer systems as much as they use their
telephones today â€” as a common instrument in life."
Yundt said SUNet will be used by professors sending
out assignments, students returning them and teaching
assistants grading and publishing grade lists.
All of the newer buildings on campus, such as the
Governor's Corner complex and the Communications
Department in the Ouad, are already wired for a com
puter/video connection that will be made in each dorm
room and office.
Crothers Memorial and L.arkin dormitories are
prototypes for the expansion. Both dorms will have
several public terminals which will be connected to the
campus network computer.
In discussing these prototypes, Yundt said, "We won't
have enough money to incorporate the whole campus un
til the project is given the complete go-ahead; so where
we can make small investments in selected places to test
it out. we will."
LOTS is expected to lease project funds from its cur
rent yearly allocation to support these prototypes, and
it expects, eventually, to capitalize into the overall pro|-

ect. LOTS will be supplying many of the terminals in this
first phase, but planners hope students will be able to
supply their own personal computers with the aid of the
Stanford Micro Disc plan.
Under that plan, expected to be operational by early
spring quarter, members of the Stanford community will
be able to purchase microprocessors for substantially
lower-than-retail prices.
"SUNet will be a real boon to personal computer
users," Trewitt said, "because the person's computer
won't need a modem, which is often very expensive.
Also, the computer will run about 30 times faster than a
modem allows it to normally since it will be on the LOTS
system, which reads at about 1000 characters per second
as compared to the modem which, at low speed, reads
around 30 characters per second.
"Some personal computers, though, will first need an
extra mechanism that allows it to behave like a terminal,
but that will still cost less than the modem, so SllNet is
beneficial in most aspects," he added.
SUNet will cost $3 million to $5 million, according to
Yundt. The funding for the plan depends on the
outcome of another plan that is currently being
reviewed that would completely replace the campus'
telephone system.
"SUNet is completely dependent on the new phone
system happening," said Trewitt, "and the money for
the new system hasn't been approved yet."
The two plans are connected for financial reasons.
"Cable trenching for both the telephone and SUNet
projects will be fairly extensive," Trewitt said, "because
there is not. enough conduit in the ground to handle even
one of the new systems. SUNet is riding piggyback on
the telephone objectives, since it involves huge sums of
money to install computer cables underground normalh
But if it were in tandem with the telephone installation
then it would be much less expensive because they could
put in the conduit for the wiring of both systems with
only one digging."
Once the phone system is approved, then the SUNet
task force can resubmit its project for approval bv the
Board of Trustees. Due to complications in the replace
ment of Stanford's telephone system, however, the
resubmittal date has been moved back to March
As soon as SUNet receives the co-ahead, installation
will begin in phases all across campus.
