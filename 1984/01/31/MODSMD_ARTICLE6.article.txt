Reagan begins campaign with
talk to religious broadcasters
Washington — President Reagan yesterday began his cam
paign for a second term by extolling the Bible, denouncing
the American Civil Liberties Union (ATI U) and issuing an
emotional call for legislation to restrict abortion and per
mit school prayer.
In a political appeal to social conservatives who have com
plained that Reagan has not given enough attention to
issues that matter most to them, the president drew cheers
from 4000 religious broadcasters with a speech containing
24 references to God and comparing the fight against abor
tion with Abraham Lincoln's efforts to end slavery. Reagan
stressed the perils of drugs, pornography and communism
and asserted that within the Bible "are all the answers to
all the problems that face us today — if we'd only read and
believe."
With entertainer Pat Boone sitting nearby smiling,
Reagan quoted him as saying some years ago that he loved
his daughters "more than anything on earth" and adding. "I
would rather that they die now believing in God than live to
grow up under communism and die one day no longer believ
ing in God."
Reagan went on to recall that he had been criticized by
the ACLU for proclaiming "The Year of the Bible" in
1983. "Well, I wear that indictment like a badge of honor,"
he said to loud applause.
Reagan won a standing ovation from the broadcasters
with his denunciation of abortion and his call "for the
mighty power of your prayers" to pass the "Hyde-Jensen
Respect-Life Bill."
"This nation cannot continue turning a blind eye and a
deaf ear to the taking of some 4000 unborn children's lives
every day," Reagan said. More than one-tenth of these
abortions are performed in California under legislation that
Reagan signed into law as California's governor in 1967.
U.S. considers merging
nuclear arms control talks
Washington — The Reagan administration, in a policy
switch aimed at coaxing the Soviet Union back to the nu
clear bargaining table, announced yesterday that the
United States would be willing to consider merging the
stalled negotiations over intercontinental strategic weap
ons and European-based intermediate-range missiles.
"We're willing to listen to any serious proposal the
Soviets might have," Edward Rowny, the chief U.S. arms
negotiator on strategic weapons, emphasized several times
in responding to reporters' questions about possibly mer
ging the separate arms talks.
Rowny read a prepared statement declaring optimistical
ly that, if the Soviets returned to the bargaining table, the
two sides would be "in a position to make a breakthrough
based on trade-offs" between American advantages in
long-range bombers and air-launched cruise missiles and So
viet advantages in intercontinental missiles.
Rowny acknowledged that he was trying to send a signal
to the Soviet Union and spoke with reporters immediately
after conferring for 15 minutes with Reagan.
Until the Soviets broke off bargaining late last year when
the United States began deploying medium-range missiles
in Western Europe, the two superpowers had been holding
separate sets of negotiations in Geneva in their efforts to
control the nuclear arms race.
One set involved strategic arms reduction talks, called
START, and the other involved intermediate-range nuclear
forces and was called INF.
U.S. readies anti-terrorist laws
Washington — A package of proposed new U.S. anti
terrorism laws, including monetary rewards for information
and a crackdown on those helping to recruit or train terror
ists, is being prepared by the Justice Department and will be
sent to Congress soon, administration officials said yester
day.
In his State of the Union address last week, President
Reagan said international attention was needed to combat
"this ugly specter" of global terrorism and that he would
"forward shortly legislative proposals" to Congress and
seek allies' support for "concerted action."
The proposals, in the final clearance stage at the Justice
Department, are said to include legislation that would:
• Make a conspiracy in the United States to commit vio
lence abroad a violation of U.S. criminal statutes.
• Implement existing international conventions, such as the
1979 United Nations resolution on hostage-taking, and
other international agreements against aircraft sabotage
and hijacking.
• Authorize the payment of government rewards for infor
mation on terrorist activities here and abroad.
• Prohibit the training or support of terrorist organizations
from the United States, something officials said could lead
to a crackdown on businesses that recruit in this country
for foreign terrorist groups.
Immigration service seeks
to strengthen border patrol
Washington — To help cope with a surge of illegal aliens
crossing, the U.S.-Mexican border, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) is seeking the largest personnel
increase in its history in the new budget, administration of
ficials said yesterday.
The fiscal year 1985 budget, to be sent to Congress to
morrow, will propose nearly 1000 more enforcement
positions for the INS at a cost of $41.1 million, lifting the
agency's budget to $574.5 million and bringing the number
•of permanent positions to 11,473, the officials said.
Most of the 850 additional Border Patrol officers in
cluded in the proposal would be stationed in the 120-mile
section of the nearly 2000-mile border with Mexico, where
55 percent of apprehensions are made. The heaviest crossing
points are at Chula Vista. Calif., and El Paso, Texas, INS
officials have said.
House awards aid to veterans
Washington — In a significant symbolic victory for
veterans of two different wars, the House yesterday voted
to provide about $5 million a year in benefits to veterans
who suffer ill effects from exposure to the defoliant
Agent Orange or radiation from early nuclear explosions.
The bill, which was approved by a voice vote and sent to
the Senate, is "not the final answer but the first step in
helping those who desperately need our help," Rep. Thomas
Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat who served in Vietnam,
said.
Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) said she was "saddened it
has taken so long to take this small step."
Agent Orange has been the center of an emotional
dispute between Vietnam veterans, who have argued that
they should be compensated for having been exposed to the
chemical during the Vietnam war, and government agencies,
which have contended that more study is needed of Agent
Orange's possible effects.
