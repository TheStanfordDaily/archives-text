# Democrats draft a call for Marine pullout
## 
### 
Washington (LAI) â€” House Demo
cratic leaders, preparing for key
meetings today and tomorrow on their
strategy for ending U.S. troop involve
ment in Lebanon, are drafting a resolu
tion calling for a pullout of U.S.
Marines from Beirut but stopping short
of setting an absolute deadline, it was
learned yesterday.
Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.) the in
fluential chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Middle Fast Subcom
mittee and a key adviser on Lebanon to
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.), has quietly shown other con
gressmen the outline of the proposed
resolution. One source who had seen
the proposal, and asked not to be iden
tified, called it "a conciliatory ap
proach" aimed at drawing a broad base
of congressional support.
Several congressional sources said the
plan would set a number of priorities,
the chief of which would be to remove
U.S. troops from Lebanon without a

specified deadline. It would also call for
bringing U.N. forces into Beirut. The
resolution would require White House
representatives to consult with con
gressional leaders on plans for a pullout
within seven days of the resolution's
adoption and would require the presi
dent to report on progress toward a
pullout within a specified time after
the initial meeting.
"1 get the feeling that this is an in
cremental approach," one congressman
said, adding that it would allow mem
bers of the House of Representatives
to increase the political pressure on the
president gradually, rather than using
"a blunt instrument," such as a fund
cutoff
In grappling with the tricky problem
of finding a way out of the conflict in
Lebanon, House Democrats have been
reluctant to set a deadline for a pullout
because "they don't want to set a trap
for themselves that the president could
spring. . . . Reagan could blame the

Democrats for losing Lebanon," one
congressional foreign policy source said.
The tone of the resolution would
contrast sharply with public statements
by O'Neill, who said at a news confer
ence yesterday. "If I had my way, 1
would bring them out in the morning. I
would get them out soon, right away,
immediately, now."
However, O'Neill said, "I don't know
whether there should be a (deadline), to
be perfectly truthful . . . We ought to
send a clear message to (Reagan) that
we want him to get those boys out of
there or to change his policy, it he has a
policy."
Nicholas Cullather, an aide to Hamil
ton, refused to provide any details of
the document, which he said "is going
to undergo a few revisions and new
drafts before it's released."
Some Democrats were said to have
been dissatisfied with the tone of the
resolution and to have recommended
that it be made harsher and more criti

cal of administration policy.
Hamilton is expected to present the
plan at a meeting today of the
Speaker's Democratic task force on
Lebanon, and it may he discussed at a
Democratic party caucus scheduled for
tomorrow.
Several members have introduced
resolutions that would require a pullout
within a specified time, and they are ex
pected to try to attach similar
deadlines to Hamilton's resolution. But
one member of the Foreign Affairs
Committee said of Hamilton's influ
ence: "The strongest thing going
against such deadlines is that Lee
Hamilton opposes them."
The resolution could take three
forms: It could be drafted as a joint
resolution, which would be legally bin
ding unless the president vetoed it; a
concurrent resolution, expressing a
sense of congressional sentiment, or a
House resolution, which would not have
to be voted on by the Republican
controlled Senate.
