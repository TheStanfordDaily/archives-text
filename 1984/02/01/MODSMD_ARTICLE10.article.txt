## Game buffs in pursuit of trivia 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Staff writer 
Mood rings, pet rocks and Rubik's
Cubes — like a Top-40 rock hit, each
enjoyed its period of popularity and
then faded into obscurity.
Fickle Americans eventually labelled
mood rings fake, accused pet rocks of
providing inadequate security and
abandoned Rubik's Cubes upon learning
that trained seven-year-olds could solve
them in 30 seconds.
But interest in one of America's
most recent fads, a board game called
Trivial Pursuit, is certainly not waning
her*? at Stanford.
Trivial Pursuit, in its original version,
consists of 6000 questions in six
categories: geography, entertainment,
history, art & literature, science & na
ture and sports & leisure.
Trivia fans have purchased editions so
quickly that stores have established
waiting lists, and black markets are al
leged to be dealing the game in Los An
geles.
Students here find the game
particularly challenging.
"It's addictive," says freshman Jeff
Selman. "I tell myself I'm not going to
play — I've got too much work. I go
into my room, lock the door. But within
10 minutes I'm out there in the lounge
with everyone."
"Everyone" means up to 24 players
and, often, as many spectators.
Between two and six teams compete,

answering trivia questions in an at
tempt to reach key positions on the
game board. A team wins by landing on
the six crucial points, responding cor
rectly to questions from the six corres
ponding categories, and then reaching
the center of the board and giving one
last correct answer.
But the game is not as easy as it
sounds.
A sample question in the history cat
egory: "How many Israeli athletes were
killed at the Munich Olympics?"
And in the geography department:
"What country produces the original
Edam cheese?"
The question that many non-players
then ask is "Who cares?"

But hundreds of students here evi
dently love the game.
Trivial Pursuit appeals to students'
competitive instincts. It is not uncom
mon to see fights over how much time
teams have to answer questions, cheers
and high-fives following correct
responses, and sighs of anguish as
players realize they know less than they
thought they knew.
Fanatics claim the 6000 questions
begin to repeat after enough games.
"For a couple of weeks, we played every
day,"says senior Chuck Narikiyo. "We
started hearing the same questions over
and over. We bought the two new edi
tions" (each consisting of 6000 new bits
of trivia, one set exclusively on sports,
the other on movies). "Now we only
play once every few days."
Many students even claim to prefer
playing the game to going out on
weekend nights
"It's an intellectual challenge," says
freshman Jay Alter. "Everyone likes to
think he knows something that other
people don't. (Trivial Pursuit) gives
people a chance to prove that."
Others state their motives more
simply.
"It's fun to flaunt your knowledge,"
says senior Dave Smith.
Perhaps the best thing about the
game is learning new trivia. For exam
ple, 1 1 Israeli athletes were killed at
Munich and Edam cheese is produced in
the Netherlands.
