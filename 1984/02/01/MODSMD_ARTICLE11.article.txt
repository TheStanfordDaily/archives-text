Opus stumbles through Op
eration Antarctic Fury. Milo
practices the yellowest brand
of journalism. Meanwhile,
Oliver sets the world afire
from the personal computer in
his room.
In any one day, it would not
be unusual to find this or more
within the frames of Berke
Breathed's Bloom County.
Appearing in more than 500
newspapers nationally,
Breathed's strip adds one more
paper to his list today with
Bloom County's first appear
ance in The Stanford Daily.
Breathed (rhymes with
method), who talked about his
cartooning in an interview with
The Daily, said he hopes the
strip provides evidence that
"realistic characters and clever
dialogue can exist in a sea of
gug lines and simple charac
ters."
Known for his unique, if not
controversial, treatment of
current events, Breathed ac
knowledged some problems
with readership. Surveys have

shown that most of his audi
ence is primarily limited to
readers from their early- teens
to their early-40s.
His core readership ranges
from the college-aged to people
in their late 20s — the strip
appears in over 100 college
newspapers each day."I am
probably in more college
newspapers than anyone else
right now," Breathed said.
Believing that Bloom
County is an acquired taste.
Breathed asks readers to "have
a little patience. This is not a
one-character strip. I have
made it as complicated as pos
sible. If the readers find that
they don't understand it, give
it a few weeks. It should grow
on them." Bloom County en
tered national syndication in
December 1980, but that was
not the first time several of
the characters had carried
Breathed onto the comic
pages.
While he was a student at
the University of Texas,
Breathed drew and wrote a
strip for The Daily Texan
called The Academia Waltz.

The Bloom County strip ap
peared when The Washington
Post—after seeing Breathed's
Academia Waltz —asked the
cartoonist to prepare a strip
for national syndication. Only

two characters were holdovers
from the original strip, but
Breathed says, "You could call
Bloom County an evolution of
the first strip."
The theme that runs
through both strips and unites
them is Breathed himself.
There is a wide range of charac

ters and situations in Bloom
County, from Miss Limekiller
and Binkley's closet of
anxieties to Senator Bedfellow
and Quiche Lorraine; still
Breathed notes, "All the char
acters are out of my personal
ity somehow."
Breathed never intended to
share his personality in
newsprint. His college back
ground "is in journalism, pho
tography, and filmmaking."
When he graduated from Texas
in 1979, he did not plan to
make a career of cartooning. "I
never intended to be a life-long
cartoonist, or for that matter,
a short-term cartoonist."
Breathed said.
Producing four panels of
animated dialogue and im
aginative situations for each
day is obviously a creative chal
lenge, so Breathed admitted
"there are bound to be up., and
downs in the strip."
Rather than brood over the
strips that are not up to their
potential. Breathed chooses to
look at the long-term consis
tency of the strip. "You pray
individual strips will be decent.

And hope they will be consis
tent enough over the long run
to carry the strip each day."
Breathed works without a
staff. "I don't have a staff be
cause I don't know if I could
find anyone with a creative
genius I could trust and I keep
a highly irregular schedule."
Breathed noted that car
toonists' staffs are a "recent
manifestation of cartooning."
Breathed's drawing style has
often been compared to Garry
Trudeau's. He explains the
similarity by saying "I grew up
with Trudeau just like every
one else."
Just as Trudeau's Doones
bury is very topical, so too is
Breathed's Bloom County.
Breathed cannot even imagine
a non-topical Bloom County.
"Making the strip topical helps
keep me interested in car
toons—its part of the humor."
Although Breathed says he has
received some criticism of the
inclusion of topical issues in
the strip, he says,"I would be
hard pressed to keep it (politics
and current events) out of the
strip."

tent enough over the long run
to carry the strip each day."
Breathed works without a
staff. "I don't have a staff be
cause I don't know if I could
find anyone with a creative
genius I could trust and I keep
a highly irregular schedule."
Breathed noted that car
toonists' staffs are a "recent
manifestation of cartooning."
Breathed's drawing style has
often been compared to Garry
Trudeau's. He explains the
similarity by saying "I grew up
with Trudeau just like every
one else."
Just as Trudeau's Doones
bury is very topical, so too is
Breathed's Bloom County.
Breathed cannot even imagine
a non-topical Bloom County.
"Making the strip topical helps
keep me interested in car
toons—its part of the humor."
Although Breathed says he has
received some criticism of the
inclusion of topical issues in
the strip, he says,"I would be
hard pressed to keep it (politics
and current events) out of the
strip."
