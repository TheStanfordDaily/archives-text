# Student Republicans prepare for campaigns
## 
### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer 
With this fall's election campaigns just
beginning to gear up, student GOP leaders here
have set into motion a mechanism which they
say will provide student support for Republican
candidates — particularly in the race for presi
dent.
The first step has been to combine the
strengths of the two Republican organizations
at Stanford.
The Stanford Republican League (SRL), a
moderate statewide organization which, accor
ding to its architects, seeks to "strengthen and
broaden the base of the Republican Party," was
recently merged into the Stanford College
Republicans (SCR), one of a number of college
based groups which are structurally aligned with
the official state Republican Party.
According to SCR president John Harris, his
group is generally regarded as somewhat more
conservative than SRL, placing more emphasis
on the interests of the entire Republican Party
rather than on a particular segment.
"As of next year there won't be a Stanford
Republican League," Harris said. The remaining
Republican group will be "completely aligned
with the state Republican organization."
Because there was not until recently a fully
developed Republican presidential campaign, the
Stanford College Republicans have been
"mostly concentrating on developing in
frastructure," according to Steve Dauber, an
officer of SCR. In light of President Reagan's

recent announcement of his candidacy, the
group is mainly working on recruiting members
and registering voters. Dauber said.
According to Harris, the organization's activi
ties include sponsoring speakers and seminars at
Stanford, attending statewide Republican con
ventions and finding people who want to work
on campaigns. However, the extent to which the
group can help with campaigning is limited by
the fact that the bulk of campaign work is done
in June, July, August and September.
"We're not in session four out of the live
most important months," Harris said.
Nonetheless, Harris said his group will be
prepared to begin working on the Reagan re
election campaign in the near future. In addi
tion, the group will be supporting the Republi
can challenger to state Assemblyman Bvron
Sher.
SCR is currently considering supporting Becky
Morgan for Sher's office. Dauber said, but will
support whichever Republican candidate wins
the primary. According to Harris, however, un
less Sher has a serious Republican challenger.
SCR will probably not be very involved in the
campaign.
Many prominent political battles in which the
organization would otherwise be involved will
not be fought this year. Governor George Deuk
mejian, Sen. Pete Wilson and Rep. Ed Zschau
won in the most recent elections. And among
the Democrats, Sen. Alan Cranston is not up for
re-election this year.
