## The Stanford Daily Death made easy
### 
We all remember the debate over the death
penalty. The Supreme Court calling it "cruel and
unusual" in 1972, then reinstating it in 1976,
the resulting battles in statehouses and court
houses nationwide, Gary Gilmore. . . . Today,
however, we get the feeling that as far as the
Supreme Court is concerned, the debate is over,
and the only question is how fast do we execute.
Last week's 7-2 decision dropping
"proportionality review" as a requirement for
capital punishment not only will accelerate the
pace of executions, but it signifies that the
court is turning its head to the unfairness of the
death penalty. Wrote the majority: "As we
have acknowledged in the past, there can be no
perfect procedure for imposing death sen
tences."
In the past, however, the court responded to
these inherent imperfections by abolishing capi
tal punishment or by insisting on state statutes
that were as fair as possible. A major factor be
hind the court's acceptance of Georgia's and
Florida's death penalty laws in the 1970s was
proportionality review, which requires appellate
courts to determine whether a prisoner's death
sentence is in line with other sentences imposed
in that state for similar crimes.
In last week's ruling, the court eliminated

proportionality as a mandatorty requirement.
The decision overturned a federal appeals court
in California which said that Robert Harris, con
victed for two 197K murders, could not be ex
ecuted until he received the special review.
Harris' life may yet be spared, but the decision is
expected to result in the death of other
inmates, especially in Texas, where the propor
tionality question is the only barrier left to the
execution of at least a dozen prisoners.
The court's disregard for this important
safeguard is scary. Despite numerous studies, in
cluding one in l 983 from a Stanford Law School
professor, indicating that the death penalty is
discriminatory towards blacks and the poor, the
court seems intent on increasing the number of
executions. There are now 1300 death-row
prisoners, and rather than question whether it is
fair to execute any of them, the court is making
it easier to execute some of them.
The two dissenting justices, William Brennan
and Thurgood Marshall, wrote that the court
was "deluding itself and also the American
public" by insisting that capital punishment is
equitably applied and no longer arbitrary or
capricious. It is small comfort that two of nine
justices recognize that there still is a debate
over whether we should even have a death
penalty.
