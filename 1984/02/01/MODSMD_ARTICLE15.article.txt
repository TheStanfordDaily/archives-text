## Allow Mosher to return as a Zete

mittee ignores long list of incidents
of obnoxious behavior by Zeta Psi
frat boys, and restores recognition to
the fraternity.

bounced from Ph.D. program in an
thropology for mysterious reasons,
makes final appeal for reinstatement
tograd school. Prospect looks bleak.

VIEWPOINT

What are we to presume from all
this? Did Mosher commit such out
rageous crimes against humanity that
stuffing two students (who were
wearing only underwear) face down
into mud pales by comparison?
Would attempting to steal a couch
and then assaulting those who try to
stop him be child's play for ol' Steve?
Did he get a whole bunch of Chinese
peasants royally wasted and then
leave them lying unconscious out in a
rice paddy somewhere? After all.
that's the kind of thing some Zetes
have done, and they're in good graces
these days. No, he must have really

stepped over the line of civilized be
havior. unlike the frat boys. My per
sonal theory is that he must have
mooned the Chinese Premier while
standing up on the Great Wall. I
mean, his actions are so heinous that
nobody will tell us what they were,
not even Mosher.
It seems to me that there's an ob
vious solution here. Let Mosher back
into Stanford under the condition
that he join the Zetes.
Think of it. The frat boys will earn
even more gold stars by rehabilitat
ing the renegade anthropologist back
into polite Stanford society. First,
they can have him show up at foot
ball games, intimidate unassertive
students out of sitting in seats
they're entitled to, and then self
righteously defend the practice to
anyone who complains. If they aren't
sufficiently intimidated, he can
throw ice at them, spray beer on
them, vomit on them or start a
senseless brawl. This is a good first
assignment for Steve because it's
basic — all the frats do this.
(Wouldn't you love to see one of
those sickeningly phony frat boys try

to launch into his "frats are misun
derstood" during pre-game at Stan
ford Stadium?)
After his initiation, he can
practice tossing college women into
cement hot tubs. It takes a little skill,
but Mosher does have all that experi
ence abusing rural Chinese people.
Then some Zetes can show him that
real aggression is best taken out on
inanimate objects like frat houses,
trailers and dorm suites. I'll bet that
after experiencing the thrill of
punching through a trailer wall with
his bare fist, Mosher will be relieved
of the destructive compulsion to do
really objectionable things like of
fending the government of the
People's Republic of China.
So here's your chance. President
Kennedy! Open your heart and let
Steven Mosher join Zeta Psi. It's not
such an outrageous request. After
all. being a knowledgable non-foreign
Stanford grad student, he hasn't
dared ask for a chance to live on
campus. That's more than one can say
for the Zetes.
