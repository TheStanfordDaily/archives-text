# Foreign policy: empathy needed
## 
### 
A quick glance at newspaper headlines tells us
perhaps too much of what is going on in the
world: Most notably, Secretary of State George
Shultz gives us reports that "there is nothing
positive to report" in U.S.-Soviet relations. The
consequences of a misstep here, a bad move
there, an indecision over there, boggle the mind.
What if we don't start talking to the Russians
about those nasty little missiles in Europe? What
if we don't start healing our relationship? What
if one thing leads to another and kablooie?
News stories offer us problems, not solutions.
Too seldom do we read about new approaches
that could give us new perspective; only rarely are
we given fresh concepts to plug into the calcify
ing paradigms and programs that have come to
dominate decision-making. Here's one. This con
cept may not be all that new, but it certainly
seems to have been forgotten in this, the era of
slam-dancing international politics. Empathy.
Empathy is defined as "intellectual or emotional
identification with another" (see Webster's New
World Dictionary).
How many times can we, the United States,
say that we sought to "empathize" with the So
viet Union, with El Salvador, with the panoply of
Middle Eastern nations? Sure, we've tried to un
derstand the dynamics of "x" process, the nature
of "y" situation and (in Al Haig-speak) the
ramifications, manifestations and consequences
of "z" action, but have we ever attempted to
put ourselves in the shoes of our adversary? And
I mean really and truly live his problems and moti
vations, his fears and needs?
Maybe then we could comprehend the
seemingly implacable "evil empire" and its al
legedly hostile actions; maybe then we could stop
indulging ourselves with narrow-minded, alienat
ing rhetoric and aimless treadmill-like negotia
tions. And. perhaps we can yet avoid unrealistic
worst-case military force projections and
procurements on a deliberately inflated assess
ment of the Soviet threat to the United States.
A disclaimer: I'm a realist too. We really can
not stop making these worst-case estimates,
because nuclear deterrence is founded on having
the ability to inflict unacceptable damage on
your opponent should he be fool enough to at
tack you. This ability is a relative one (as against
the Soviet Union) and rests in having enough
destruction weaponry. But what kinds of weap
ons and how many are enough to deter? Nobody
knows. And since national survival depends on
nuclear deterrence, policy-makers hedge their
bets and get lots of stuff that can deter. Assume
the worst and prepare for that. It's safe. It's ex
pensive. It also fuels the arms race. But we're
stuck with it. until we reach some mutual under
standing.

I personally don't trust the Soviets as far as I
can throw an SS-20. 1 think that the Soviet
Union is an opportunistic superpower which poses
a threat to U.S. security. It sees expansion and
coercion as ways to preserve and advance its
global power position. Notwithstanding, I feel
that the United States can better understand
the Soviets and can better tailor its policies to
achieve reciprocal understanding and a less con
tentious coexistence. All we need is a little em
pathy.
Cold warriors from former President Harry
Truman to former Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles to former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger have tried their ways of controll
ing and using the U.S.S.R., as if they were man
agement specialists trying to coax extra
productivity out of some new machine. "Give
the U.S.S.R. the correct input, and we will
receive the desired output," we thought. So we
fed our new machine.

At first, we gave it the cold war cold shoulder
of containment policy. We followed with the
"touch-me-I'll-kill-you" of massive retaliation
doctrine. Next came the carrot and stick of
detente. Now the club of Reaganism. We've
never treated the Soviets as an entity, only as an
object. In all. we've objectified the superpower
conflict and taken all the sense out of it. We
compete, but for what, and for what reasons?
We've become two monolithic machines playing a
computer game of global domination. We need
some sense of what we're both playing for and
why. to place the whole thing in a human con
text. Make 110 mistake, the Soviet Union is no
machine. It acts out of its own fears, wants and
needs. It pursues it own goals.
If we try to understand their wants and tears,
then we can comprehend why they do what they
do. and why they don't do what they don't do.
Maybe we can find out what their national secur
ity needs are. and , in that light, better define
our own. Then each nation can act to respect the
needs of the other, instead of blindly acting to

exacerbate tensions.
I'm going to try to empathize with the
Soviets: First, their economy is in dire straits.
Defense expenditures continue to grow while the
economic growth rate slows, pinching the con
sumer goods industries. People aren't pleased and
the alcoholism rate hovers around 50 percent.
The country itself is huge and divided — the pop
ulation is incredibly diverse in terms of race, reli
gion and language. The Soviets accordingly face a
problem in attempting national integration.
On the international scene, the Soviets are
vulnerable and isolated. From, their point of view,
every nuclear nation in the world points its
bombs and missiles at them. There is dissension
among their eastern European allies, and it
remains unclear on which side some of the Warsaw
Pact nations would fight in the event of a war.
The Soviets fear the Chinese; in addition to pos
sessing terrific numerical dominance in conven
tional forces, the Chinese will soon threaten the
U.S.S.R. with nuclear devastation once they per
fect ballistic missile technology.
The United States on its own makes the
Soviets nervous because we point some 1050
ICBMs, 540 Sl.BMs and 330 bombers at them.
Additionally, 108 Pershing 2s will be just minutes
from downtown Moscow, along with 464 cruise
missiles.
The Soviets are very worried about their stra
tegic nuclear vulnerability because they have
deployed about 70 percent of their entire nuclear
arsenal of deliverable warheads on land. Land
forces are vulnerable to a pre-emptive first
strike; translate this to mean that we threaten
70 percent of their nuclear force. On the other
hand, we have placed only 30 percent of our total
force on land — by straight numbers alone the
Soviets are more vulnerable than we are. Of
course, this doesn't mean all that much because
both sides can easily lay waste to the other no
matter how much one's forces are threatened by
the other, and nobody really thinks about a pre
emptive strike anyway. But. if I were the
Soviets. I'd be kind of concerned.
In all. the U.S.S.R. is riddled with internal
problems and faces a cold, hostile world commu
nity. If we really understood this, we would
forego the MX and B-l. and realize that the
Pershing 2 is provocative and destabilizing. We
would make a concerted effort to normalize rela
tions. and wouldn't engage in our recent round of
conciliatory election-year foreign policy designed
to make Reagan look less dangerous to the
American voter. Why don't we try empathy and
climb inside the Soviet mind and see things from
where it sits? Nothing else seems to work.
