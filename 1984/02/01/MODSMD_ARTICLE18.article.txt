## Pension funds belong to labor 
### 
The issue of union management and eontrol of the
$600 billion in pension fund investments illuminates a
contradiction in the financial structure of this nation.
The entrustment of the deferred wages and benefits of
workers which these funds represent must, for reasons
of legal, ideological and financial imperative, be under
the sole discretion of the worker in his/her capacity as
a citizen.
Pension funds represent the largest single source of
capital for American industry. The irony of the deferred

VIEWPOINT

wages of workers constituting the largest block of capi
tal in the free world is profound. This single circum
stance underlies and precedes the economic, industrial
and structural problems confronting this nation. Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) has said, "without ques
tion, those who manage pension funds are in a position
to play a crucial role in determining the method and di
rection of the nation's economic growth and develop
ment."
Which leads us to ask, how well have pension funds
been managed? Advances in financial theory reveal that
a market rate of return can be realized through a random
selection of publicly traded stocks. Employing no skills
whatsoever, one can expect to realize the market rate of
return. Contrast this with the dismal performance of
professionally managed pension funds, few of which have
been able to outperform the market. In fact, a study by
A.G. Becker's Fund Evaluation Service reported that
over the 10-year period between 1970 and 1979, the
average pension fund return was 4.3 percent, while the
market rate of return, as approximated by the Standard
& Poor 50-0, was 5.9 percent. The efficient market hy
pothesis, as well as common sense and simple arithmetic,
demand that if one investment sector is performing con
sistently below the market, other sectors must be
benefitting correspondingly. It is hard not to conclude
that individual investors and wealthy corporate funds
are systematically extracting a profit at the expense of

the pension beneficiary.
Many of the economic realities to which we have
become desensitized may well be consequences of this
niisallocation of resources. While difficult to delineate,
there are some current distortions that can be identi
fied: The construct of structural unemployment is
created, capital spending is misdirected, the public per
ception of business is skewed, productivity and commit
ment are concepts increasingly alien to the worker.
Management and finance are perceived as impenetrable
activities that invariably demand the expertise of the
business elite. The worker is no longer a participant but
rather a disinterested requisite for the creation of
wealth.
But the question of union control of pension funds
and socially directed investment circumvents the central
issue. No organization—governmental, corporate, union
or otherwise—has the right to expropriate the wealth of
an individual. In the past, an inefficient market and a lack
of an educated populace dictated that trustees manage
that accumulation of the workers' labor that provides
for his old age. Today, in an age of information, financial
efficiency and educational attainment there exists no
rationale for this usurpation of wealth by the corporate
sponsored trustee. We treat the worker as if he is a 12-
year-old child who might spend all of his allowance in one
place, rather than as an educated, rational, independent
participant in the American economic and political sys
tem.
Under the new tax laws, there has been a proliferation
of independent retirement accounts and other financial
services that amass wealth for the later years of a per
son's life. The heritage of America provides an im
perative. John Locke wrote, "The labor of his body and
the work of his hands, we may say are properly his." Pen
sion funds, as a store of deferred wages, must with all
haste he returned to the American worker. It the
worker in his capacity as citizen who must decide in what
manner to entrust his wealth to best provide for the
future.
