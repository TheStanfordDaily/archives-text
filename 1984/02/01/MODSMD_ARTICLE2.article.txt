# Apple's computer to sell at half price
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
Perhaps there is no free lunch, but
come this April Stanford students
and faculty will be offered the next
best thing: half-priced Apples.
Through Apple Computer's Micro
disk Program, Apple plans to otter
Macintosh personal computers to
Stanford community members for
less than $1200 per unit and to
donate specialized computer equip
ment to the University which will
make the Macintosh compatible
with the University system.

The Macintosh computer retails
for approximately $2500 dollars. Ac
cording to Brian Reid. assistant pro
fessor of electrical engineering here,
the recently introduced Macintosh
model has several features which
make it ideal for the Micro-disk Pro
gram.
"The Macintosh is a whole new ball
game in terms of what you feel and
do when you're sitting in front of
it."he said. "It's the first personal
computer ever built in that price
range that is good for more than just
computing. It is good for graphics,
and word-processing with diagrams.
It is very organic."
According to LOTS Director Ralph
Gorin. the Macintosh will be made
available to anyone "appropriately
associated" with the University.
"Some computers may go to fac
ulty—probably not computer science
faculty, because they already have
them—but to other disciplines." he
said. For those who don't want to

huy computers individually, addi
tional computers will he made
available to students in special
cluster arrangements.
According to Michael Carter,
director of Instruction and Research
Information Systems here, there are
few strings attached to the agree
ment. "In order to make the plan a
success, Stanford will provide main
tenance to computers on campus,
and demonstrations when they
come," he said.
"For both Stanford and Apple, the
purpose of the deal is to provide
computers. It is not any sort of black
market deal," he said.
Reid agreed: "By the terms of the
initial agreement. Stanford has to do
nothing in return. There are no re
strictions on Stanford, except that
we cannot resell the machines we buy
at a profit. It's a no-lose situation,
we get the computers cheap, and stu
dents can buy them for 60 percent
off," he said.
Stanford is only one of 24 colleges
involved in the Apple agreement to
circulate computers among college
students. Rice. UC-Berkeley, Cornell
and Carnegie-Mellon universities are
among the participants in the pro
gram, according to Reid.
Why Stanford? According to
Gorin. there are many reasons, in
cluding the existence of a special re
lationship between Apple and
Stanford.
"We're nearby, and prestigious. A
lot of people who work at Apple
went to Stanford, and Apple knows
there are people here who can do in
teresting and innovative things with
computers. I hat is certainly part ot
what really attracts Apple," he said.
According to Carter, Apple's pri
mary motivation is to spur sales.
" They are donating the computers to
give high visibility to a new product.
From Stanford's point of view, com
puting on campus is also a very impor
tant function." he said.
Reid agreed. "It is Apple's hope
that college students will want to
buy the computers after graduation.
II they sell in a major university, they
will sell well in the real world." he
said.
