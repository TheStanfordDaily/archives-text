Harvard before God
Cambridge, Mass. — We always
suspected Harvard puts itself above God.
Now there's proof.
Yadin Kaufmann, president of Har
vard's Jewish Law School Association,
says Harvard went a bit too far when it
scheduled its 19N4 commencement on a
Jewish holiday.
"There are plenty of other days to
choose from, and the University has been
so insensitive as to choose a Jewish
holiday." Kaufmann told the Harvard
Crimson. "I think this is an issue of Har
vard placing itself before God and
country." he said.
More than 100 students and professors
have signed it petition protesting the
date, which is a holiday commemorating
God's gift of the Ten Commandments to
Moses. University officials say, however,
that it is too late to change commence
ment plans.
Texan party fraud
Austin. Texas — A Florida-based com
pany that sent letters to parents of Uni
versity of Texas students concerning
fictitious birthday parties could be
charged with violating Florida's false rep
resentation statute, according to the
Daily Texan.
Officials of L.A. deMontmollin, the
Florida company, have agreed to reim
burse the parents and subsequently go
out of business.
The University released the names, ad
dresses and birthdates of more than
I ().()()() Texas students to the company in
November. The company then sent hand
written letters to the parents, asking
them to buv a gift for a surprise birthday
party being planned for their child.
Enclosed with each personalized letter
was an I A. deMontmollin brochure of
fering balloons, cakes and birthday

The letter writer purported to be a
"close friend" of the parents' child and
asked parents to send money directly to
L.A. deMontmollin in Miami. The "close
friend" stated in the letter that he or she
was writing the letter from Florida — and
not Texas — because of a family emer
gency.
University of Texas officials have yet
to press charges against the company, but
the United States Post Office might.
Meanwhile, the company is working to
refund all the money it collected.
Penn V Gumby
Philadelphia — Gumbymania has hit
the University of Pennsylvania.
Students at Penn celebrated
"Gumbyfest '83" recently to show their
love for Pokey's flat, green, clay sidekick.
At one Gumbyfest event, students
drank green beer, danced to the
rock n' roll version of the Gumby theme
song and competed in a Gumby look-alike
contest.
Engineering senior David Helinik won
the look-alike contest and summed up
the spirit of Gumbyfest best when he
trumpeted. "Gumby's my main man!"
Penn isn't finished with its cartoon
idolatry yet. however. Penn Union Coun
cil representatives say plans are underway
for a "Jetsonfest."
Big 10 in the buff?
Lafayette, Ind. — This one's a little
tough to explain.
It seems Jeff Jackson, a junior at
Purdue University, has been calling and
writing student leaders at other Big Ten
schools to line up potential candidates
for a "Men of the Big Ten" photo spread
in Playgirl magazine.
But Playgirl says it doesn't know

anything about the plan.
A spokesman for the magazine says
Jackson "has fabricated his information."
but Jackson says Playgirl is just keeping
the plan a secret until Jackson can line up
enough candidates for the spread.
Nobody knows for sure what's what
right now. but the student leaders Jack
son contacted are taking sides.
A few Big Ten student body presidents
said they thought Jackson's plan "might
be a fun thing." Others said they thought
the plan was a "prett\ bogus idea from
the start."
Stay tuned as we find out more.
Princeton cheats
Princeton, NJ. — In an attempt to
prove that Princeton's honor code
doesn t work, two sophomores con
spicuously cheated on a midterm exam in
a class in which they weren't enrolled, ac
cording to a story in The Daily Prince
tonian.
The students, Chris Trancredi and
David Judah, say they used crib notes,
consulted a textbook and whispered
messages during a Physics 103 exam to
find out whether other students would
report them according to honor code
rules.
No one did.
Judah and Trancredi. who actually took
the class last year, say their experiment
confirms an often-suspected fact: that
most students would not report an aca
demic honor code violation even though
Princeton's honor code, like Stanford's,
requires a student to report any instance
of cheating he witnesses.
"I half-expected that as I walked out
of the test room someone would follow
me out and say to one of the professors
sitting outside the door. "Look, that guy
cheated.' No one did. though." Judah told
The Daily Princetonian.
Judah added, however, that he heard
someone sitting behind him whisper to
another student. "Hey, be a witness.
Those people are cheating."
Trancredi said that their intentional
cheating was the kind "people couldn't
help but notice. We looked over people's
shoulders and passed the crib sheet. The
best part was when David tapped me and
said, 'Turn the page back.' so I turned it
back and let him look over it for half a
minute or so."
Honor Committee Chairman Chris Bar
rett said that a better, more cheat-proof
system is unnecessary because "the honor
code has served Princeton well for 90
years."

Wiliiamstown, Mass. — When winter

Well, sort of.

depth" and then do a bunch of other
things just for fun.
This year's winter study was no differ
ent.
In addition to the one serious class, stu
dents were able to take tough academic
courses like skiing and knitting.
To take up their extra time this year, a
group of Williams men volunteered to go
unshaven for charity. About a dozen men
collected cash pledges for each day they
would go without shaving. The "Growth
tor Youth" project — the money went to
the Wiliiamstown Children's Center
netted about $500. Participant Kelley
Murphy said the project actually helped
his social life.
"Before Growth for Youth, girls never
used to talk to me." Murphy said. "Now
they come up to me and tell me I'm ugly. I

Harvard before God
Cambridge, Mass. — We always
suspected Harvard puts itself above God.
Now there's proof.
Yadin Kaufmann, president of Har
vard's Jewish Law School Association,
says Harvard went a bit too far when it
scheduled its 19N4 commencement on a
Jewish holiday.
"There are plenty of other days to
choose from, and the University has been
so insensitive as to choose a Jewish
holiday." Kaufmann told the Harvard
Crimson. "I think this is an issue of Har
vard placing itself before God and
country." he said.
More than 100 students and professors
have signed it petition protesting the
date, which is a holiday commemorating
God's gift of the Ten Commandments to
Moses. University officials say, however,
that it is too late to change commence
ment plans.
Texan party fraud
Austin. Texas — A Florida-based com
pany that sent letters to parents of Uni
versity of Texas students concerning
fictitious birthday parties could be
charged with violating Florida's false rep
resentation statute, according to the
Daily Texan.
Officials of L.A. deMontmollin, the
Florida company, have agreed to reim
burse the parents and subsequently go
out of business.
The University released the names, ad
dresses and birthdates of more than
I ().()()() Texas students to the company in
November. The company then sent hand
written letters to the parents, asking
them to buv a gift for a surprise birthday
party being planned for their child.
Enclosed with each personalized letter
was an I A. deMontmollin brochure of
fering balloons, cakes and birthday

The letter writer purported to be a
"close friend" of the parents' child and
asked parents to send money directly to
L.A. deMontmollin in Miami. The "close
friend" stated in the letter that he or she
was writing the letter from Florida — and
not Texas — because of a family emer
gency.
University of Texas officials have yet
to press charges against the company, but
the United States Post Office might.
Meanwhile, the company is working to
refund all the money it collected.
Penn V Gumby
Philadelphia — Gumbymania has hit
the University of Pennsylvania.
Students at Penn celebrated
"Gumbyfest '83" recently to show their

At one Gumbyfest event, students
drank green beer, danced to the
rock n' roll version of the Gumby theme
song and competed in a Gumby look-alike
contest.
Engineering senior David Helinik won
the look-alike contest and summed up
the spirit of Gumbyfest best when he
trumpeted. "Gumby's my main man!"
Penn isn't finished with its cartoon

for a "Men of the Big Ten" photo spread
in Playgirl magazine.
But Playgirl says it doesn't know

anything about the plan.
A spokesman for the magazine says
Jackson "has fabricated his information."

the plan a secret until Jackson can line up
enough candidates for the spread.
Nobody knows for sure what's what
right now. but the student leaders Jack

A few Big Ten student body presidents
said they thought Jackson's plan "might

Princeton cheats
Princeton, NJ. — In an attempt to
prove that Princeton's honor code
doesn t work, two sophomores con
spicuously cheated on a midterm exam in
a class in which they weren't enrolled, ac
cording to a story in The Daily Prince
tonian.
The students, Chris Trancredi and
David Judah, say they used crib notes,
consulted a textbook and whispered
messages during a Physics 103 exam to
find out whether other students would
report them according to honor code
rules.
No one did.
Judah and Trancredi. who actually took
the class last year, say their experiment
confirms an often-suspected fact: that
most students would not report an aca
demic honor code violation even though
Princeton's honor code, like Stanford's,
requires a student to report any instance
of cheating he witnesses.
"I half-expected that as I walked out
of the test room someone would follow
me out and say to one of the professors
sitting outside the door. "Look, that guy
cheated.' No one did. though." Judah told
The Daily Princetonian.
Judah added, however, that he heard
someone sitting behind him whisper to
another student. "Hey, be a witness.
Those people are cheating."
Trancredi said that their intentional
cheating was the kind "people couldn't
help but notice. We looked over people's
shoulders and passed the crib sheet. The
best part was when David tapped me and
said, 'Turn the page back.' so I turned it
back and let him look over it for half a
minute or so."
Honor Committee Chairman Chris Bar
rett said that a better, more cheat-proof
system is unnecessary because "the honor
code has served Princeton well for 90
years."

In addition to the one serious class, stu
dents were able to take tough academic
courses like skiing and knitting.
To take up their extra time this year, a
group of Williams men volunteered to go
unshaven for charity. About a dozen men
collected cash pledges for each day they
would go without shaving. The "Growth

the Wiliiamstown Children's Center
netted about $500. Participant Kelley
