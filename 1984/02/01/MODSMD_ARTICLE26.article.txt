### BETH KLEID Daily staff 
When new Stanford

their roommates last Sep
tember, freshman gymnast

peting in the gymnastics

were hoping to learn their
way around the Farm,
Goldsmith was hoping to
make the 1 Israeli Olym
pic gymnastic team.

Goldsmith got what she
hoped for — but it was no
easy process.
The native of Bloomfield
Hills, Mich., had to
qualify as an Israeli before
she could qualify for the Is
raeli Olympic gymnastics
team. So Goldsmith went
through all the paperwork
and eventually received dual
Israeli-American citizen
ship.
But why alter one's
citizenship just to compete
in the Olympics?
"It was Israel who found
me," said Goldsmith. "They
came to me and asked me to
be on their team — and 1
thought it would be neat to
represent their country."
For Goldsmith, the path

to the Olympics took much
more than just becoming an
Israeli citizen. She started
her career in gymnastics at
age seven. And she was
good.
"I just kept winning. 1
won at state meets, and
when 1 was 1 1 I won the
regionals." she said.
Goldsmith s early success
at gymnastics effected a
major decision in her life.
She decided to totally dedi
cate herself to the sport,
and at age 12 she moved to
Eugene. Ore., where she
worked out with a private
gymnastics club.
The decision to leave her
family and friends in Mich
igan was her own. "My par
ents never pushed me into
gymnastics. They let me do
whatever I wanted to do
they just wanted me to be
happy."
When Goldsmith moved
in with the coaches of the
gymnastics club in Eugene
her life got tougher. And
she got stronger.
"It wasn't fun, it was
work," she said. "We
practiced for six-and-a-half
hours every day except Sun
day. The main idea was to be
the best that you could."
The gymnast's work at
the club paid off. She won a
first place for her perfor
mance on the balance beam
in the 1981 Maccabiah
Games in Israel, and she
boasts a second-place trophy

from the 19S1 United
States Championships.
According to Goldsmith,
the coaches who ran the
gymnastics club were strict.
"Because they wanted us to
be so good they were always
yelling. Luckily. I never real
iv got picked on. but others
did." The coaches also con
trolled their gymnasts' diets
and restricted the amount
of sweets they ate. "But I
would sneak stuff anyway."
admitted Goldsmith.
Despite the rigorous life
style she led in Eugene,
Goldsmith continued to live
and train there for five
years. She said that she kept
in close contact with her
family, and was never ex
tremely homesick.
"1 talked to my mom on
the phone about every
other day. She came to see
my meets, and she spent
summers with me."
In fact, Goldsmith attri
butes her smooth adjust
ment to Stanford —
despite a winter quarter ar
rival — to the fact that she
is used to living away from
home. "Plus my advisers
have been helpful, and so
have the coach and team
members of the gymnastics
team here."
Goldsmith said that she
feels comfortable on the
Stanford gymnastics team.
The regular competition she
will meet as a Cardinal gym
nast will be good practice

tor the Olympics. "The
more competition I am
exposed to, the better 1 will
feel in front of judges," she
said. "Being on the Stan
ford team will give me a lot
of experience."
On the team here.
Goldsmith's practice time
has been cut to three hours
a day. She is not worried
about losing time, though.
She does not compare her
self to other gymnasts who
will be practicing more than
she is for the Olympics.
'"I'm not trying to win the
gold. Just to be there will be
a great experience for me,"
she said. "Right now I have
more things to do than only
gymnastics. I really want to
get on with the rest of my
life."
Goldsmith admits that
she has missed out on a nor
mal social life because of her
dedication to the sport.
"I've always said to myself
that I'll have time for a so
cial life later."
But the freshman has
gained unique skills and ex
periences as a result of gym
nastics. "I have been able to
travel all over and meet
people from all over the
world, " she said. "And
through gymnastics I
learned to discipline myself,
which has helped with things
like schoolwork."
Goldsmith has not
learned how to deal with
pressure as a result of gym

nasties. "My coach will tell
you that I'm the worst in
the gym when it comes to
that — I get really upset at
myself because I expect so
much from myself."
Goldsmith may have a
temper when she does not
meet her own expectations,
but the 4-foot-10, 90-

pounder does not describe
herself as a forceful person.
Even the years in front of
judges have not made her to
tally confident. "I'm a
pretty shy person." she said.
As for the future,
Goldsmith will return to
Eugene this summer to train
intensely before the Olym

pics. But after the Olym
pics, and after her collegiate
gymnastics career has ended.
Goldsmith aims to end the
years of flips and hand
springs. In fact, she plans on
a career in sports medicine.
"But I will always love to
watch gymnastics." she said.

day. The main idea was to be
the best that you could."
The gymnast's work at
the club paid off. She won a
first place for her perfor
mance on the balance beam
in the 1981 Maccabiah
Games in Israel, and she
boasts a second-place trophy

from the 19S1 United
States Championships.
According to Goldsmith,
the coaches who ran the
gymnastics club were strict.
"Because they wanted us to
be so good they were always
yelling. Luckily. I never real
iv got picked on. but others
did." The coaches also con
trolled their gymnasts' diets
and restricted the amount
of sweets they ate. "But I
would sneak stuff anyway."
admitted Goldsmith.
Despite the rigorous life
style she led in Eugene,
Goldsmith continued to live
and train there for five
years. She said that she kept
in close contact with her
family, and was never ex
tremely homesick.
"1 talked to my mom on
the phone about every
other day. She came to see
my meets, and she spent
summers with me."
In fact, Goldsmith attri
butes her smooth adjust
ment to Stanford —
despite a winter quarter ar
rival — to the fact that she
is used to living away from
home. "Plus my advisers
have been helpful, and so
have the coach and team
members of the gymnastics
team here."
Goldsmith said that she
feels comfortable on the
Stanford gymnastics team.
The regular competition she
will meet as a Cardinal gym
nast will be good practice

tor the Olympics. "The
more competition I am
exposed to, the better 1 will
feel in front of judges," she
said. "Being on the Stan
ford team will give me a lot
of experience."
On the team here.
Goldsmith's practice time
has been cut to three hours
a day. She is not worried
about losing time, though.
She does not compare her
self to other gymnasts who
will be practicing more than
she is for the Olympics.
'"I'm not trying to win the
gold. Just to be there will be
a great experience for me,"
she said. "Right now I have
more things to do than only
gymnastics. I really want to
get on with the rest of my
life."
Goldsmith admits that
she has missed out on a nor
mal social life because of her
dedication to the sport.
"I've always said to myself
that I'll have time for a so
cial life later."
But the freshman has
gained unique skills and ex
periences as a result of gym
nastics. "I have been able to
travel all over and meet
people from all over the
world, " she said. "And
through gymnastics I
learned to discipline myself,
which has helped with things
like schoolwork."
Goldsmith has not
learned how to deal with
pressure as a result of gym

nasties. "My coach will tell
you that I'm the worst in
the gym when it comes to
that — I get really upset at
myself because I expect so
much from myself."
Goldsmith may have a
temper when she does not
meet her own expectations,
but the 4-foot-10, 90-

pounder does not describe
herself as a forceful person.
Even the years in front of
judges have not made her to
tally confident. "I'm a
pretty shy person." she said.
As for the future,
Goldsmith will return to
Eugene this summer to train
intensely before the Olym

pics. But after the Olym
pics, and after her collegiate
gymnastics career has ended.
Goldsmith aims to end the
years of flips and hand
springs. In fact, she plans on
a career in sports medicine.
"But I will always love to
watch gymnastics." she said.


Nanci Goldsmith
When new Stanford
freshmen were meeting
their roommates last Sep
tember, freshman gymnast
Nanci Goldsmith was com
peting in the gymnastics
World Championships.
While most freshmen
were hoping to learn their
way around the Farm,
Goldsmith was hoping to
make the 1 Israeli Olym
pic gymnastic team.

Goldsmith got what she
hoped for — but it was no
easy process.
The native of Bloomfield
Hills, Mich., had to
qualify as an Israeli before
she could qualify for the Is
raeli Olympic gymnastics
team. So Goldsmith went
through all the paperwork
and eventually received dual
Israeli-American citizen
ship.
But why alter one's
citizenship just to compete
in the Olympics?
"It was Israel who found
me," said Goldsmith. "They
came to me and asked me to
be on their team — and 1
thought it would be neat to
represent their country."
For Goldsmith, the path

to the Olympics took much
more than just becoming an
Israeli citizen. She started
her career in gymnastics at
age seven. And she was
good.
"I just kept winning. 1
won at state meets, and
when 1 was 1 1 I won the
regionals." she said.
Goldsmith s early success
at gymnastics effected a
major decision in her life.
She decided to totally dedi
cate herself to the sport,
and at age 12 she moved to
Eugene. Ore., where she
worked out with a private
gymnastics club.
The decision to leave her
family and friends in Mich
igan was her own. "My par
ents never pushed me into
gymnastics. They let me do
whatever I wanted to do
they just wanted me to be
happy."
When Goldsmith moved
in with the coaches of the
gymnastics club in Eugene
her life got tougher. And
she got stronger.
"It wasn't fun, it was
work," she said. "We
practiced for six-and-a-half
hours every day except Sun
day. The main idea was to be
the best that you could."
The gymnast's work at
the club paid off. She won a
first place for her perfor
mance on the balance beam
in the 1981 Maccabiah
Games in Israel, and she
boasts a second-place trophy

from the 19S1 United
