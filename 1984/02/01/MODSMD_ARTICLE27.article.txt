## 
### LARRY GREEN Staff writer 
The Cardinal baseball team
travelled to Stanislaus State
yesterday and extended their
season-opening winning streak
to four games as they beat the
Warriors on a combined three
hitter, 5-1.
According to Card Head
Coach Mark Marquess, "We're
playing very well, but we've got
ja long way to go."
Marquess divided the pitch
ing duties between four hur
lers. Righty Kevin Kunkel went
three "programmed" innings to
get the win. Marquess intended
his starter to pitch three in
nings regardless of the
outcome. All sophomore
kunkel did was pitch a trio of
jerfect innings while striking
mt three of the nine batters
ic faced. He left with the
"ard ahead 2-0.
Junior Seth Bland and fresh
nan Rob Wassenaar, both
ighties, also appeared on the
lill. Bland went two and one

third innings while Wassenaar
had the ball one and two-thirds
innings. Stanislaus scored its
only run in the seventh inning
on an unearned run against
Wassenaar.
Virtuoso lefty reliever Jeff
Ballard closed out the game
with two spotless innings. He
struck out four Warriors and
threw two ground-outs.
Marquess said, "We're pitch
ing well and we're getting good
defense." This was made evi
dent by the fact that the Card
committed three errors and
yet gave up only one run.
The Cardinal offense
produced nine hits and jumped
to an early lead. Second
baseman Pete Stanicek led off
the game with a single.
Shortstop John Verducci fol
lowed with a walk. A passed
ball by the Stanislaus catcher
advanced both runners. Out
fielder Mark Davis hit a
sacrifice fly to drive Stanicek
home, putting the Card ahead
1-0 and sending Verducci to

third base. Stanislaus State's
second passed hall of the inning
allowed Verducci to score.
In the fifth inning Stanicek
got aboard on a double. Davis,
the next hatter, drove the run
home with a double of his own.
Clean-up hitter Rick
Lundhlade, the Cardinal first
baseman, drove Davis home to
increase the lead to 4-0.
Second baseman Dave
Esquer, a freshman walk-on,
tallied the last Cardinal run in
the eighth when he scored
from second on catcher John
Ramos' single.
The Cardinal also made
tracks on the basepaths, steal
ing four bases. Mark Davis
stole his team-leading third of
the season, while outfielders
Toi Cook. Darryl Stephens
and Lundblabe also had one
each.
The Card's next game will be
the opener of an important
three-game series against
Fuilerton State on Friday at
the Sunken Diamond.
