# Aerobics profit in free space
## 
### ANGELA GARCIA 
More students now participate in
aerobics courses than in almost any
other campus activity, and some
campus organizations may be trying
to cash in on this student interest by
taking advantage of free Stanford
facilities.
Among the profit-takers are two
jazz exercise programs on campus,
Jazzaerobics and Stanford Aerobics,
both of which charge fees for classes.
Nicole Rosenberg, Jazzaerobics co
ordinator. noted that $700 was in
the group's fund in September, but
"that was eaten up right away by the
costs." The group does not pay for
use of its facilities, which include the
Klliot Program Center at Governor's
Corner and the Clubhouse. However,
Jazzaerobics charges its members $25
to $40 for classes that are held
anywhere from two to five times a

week.
"The money covers the cost of in
structors and goes toward improving
the quality of the class. We have to
keep the music up to date," Rosen
berg said. "So far, we're not making
money, but I'm optimistic. We al
ways hope that there'll be extra
money left over."
Jazzaerobics, which has an enroll
ment of about 100, has had to cancel
one of its scheduled classes already.
Rosenberg attributed this fact to
the new competition with free
aerobics classes on campus. "OSA
(Organization of Student Activities)
should make a policy regarding prof
its." she said. Jazzaerobics profits
would go towards mats or a speaker
system for the school.
Janet VanHouten, director of
Governor's Corner, said she asks that
groups be non-profit but does not

audit books. Any student group au
thorized by OSA or residing in
Governor's Corner is allowed to use
the Program Center facilities free.
"They pay a deposit, and we expect
them to run a break-even opera
tion." she said. Stanford Aerobics,
which also uses the facility, just
breaks even and may be losing money,
according to VanHouten.
She agreed with the policy, saying
that it people want to register in the
classes, they are being provided a ser
vice. Groups are only subject to rules
of spaceâ€”basically, that any damage
must be paid for. "One ongoing prob
lem. however, is lack of space," the
director added. "On a priority list of
about seven, these exercise classes
rank number five. They are often
cancelled or rescheduled because they
meet so often and conflict with
other events."

process.
