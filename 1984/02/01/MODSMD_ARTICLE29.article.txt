# Saturn's rings found thinner

Saturn's rings may be much thinner
than was previously thought, accor
ding to an innovative Stanford doc
toral candidate's interpretation of
data received from Voyager One.
Howard Zebker and Electrical En
gineering Prof. G. Leonard Tyler
have completed surprising new meas
urements of the thickness of the
rings surrounding Saturn.
Evidence from telescopic observa
tions on Earth had previously shown
the rings to be about six-tenths of a
mile thick, according to Tyler.
Instead. Tyler and Zebker found
that some of the rings are as little as
10 yards thick.
Tyler said that it was Zebker's doc
toral work which allowed for the new

measurements to be made.
"It did not occur to us that we
could actually make a measurement
of the thickness of the rings with the
data we received from Voyager One,
but it was Zebker's original work
that showed us a way to use the data
for the measurements." Tyler said.
Voyager One traveled behind the
rings of Saturn and transmitted
radio waves to Earth in November of
1980. However, the data did not
arrive at Stanford in computer
readable form until mid-1981.
I he study of a radio shadow, cast
by the rings onto the planet, led to
the new measurements of the rings.
The diameter of the ring farthest
from Saturn is 170,000 miles which,
according to the new findings, means

that Saturn's rings are 10 million
times wider than they are thick.
The new measurements of the
rings are important in understanding
the Saturn system, the lifetime of a
ring and how the rings evolved, accor
ding to Tyler.
Tyler said the information was also
valuable in helping to examine
theories, "since there is now no rea
son to accept a theory which doesn't
support thin rings."
The same processes which shaped
the rings were probably active in the
formation of the galaxies. Tyler said.
"If we can understand what the
processes were that shaped the rinus'
evolution, we can then get closer to
understanding the formation and
evolution of the galaxies," he said.
