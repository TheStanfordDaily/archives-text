### STEVE TROUSDALE Daily staff 
By a 13-0 vote the ASSU Senate last night ap
proved an $11,000 "budget modification" for
the Stanford Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE), giving the group approval to spend its
entire budget on a political conference planned
for April.
SCOPE, which until recently had only one
member and which before tonight had 110 plans
l»ir its money, plans to fund 1 I seminars 011 poli
tical topics including the Middle Eiast. women s
issues, voter registration and community organiz
ing. The organization is co-sponsoring most ol
these sessions with various campus political
groups.

meeting. University President Donald Kennedy
told the senators that:

control and whether the museum is to be
decoupled trom the proposed center for public
affairs.

"to have 24 blue-ribbon sports." because of its
recent budget problems. These stemmed in part,
he said, trom the departure of "Number 7." who
helped put Stanford on television four times in
Ins senior year, l ast year Stanford made 110 tele
vision appearances and thus lost a large source of
revenue.
• The search for a replacement for Dean <>t Ad
missions Fred Hargadon will "hopefullv" be done
by April.
• Special deals 011 personal computers will be
available "sometime this quarter." (See related

story, this page.)
• I lie Administration will hold graduation wher
ever the students want it.
Kennedy also said he "is encouraged about
most ot the subject matter" to be covered by
the proposed SCOPE policy conference.
Ihe S( OPE proposal had been controversial
because S( OPE had earlier tried to transfer its
entire budget to the ASSU Lobby Office with
out senate approval, which it needed for such a
move. However, the budget change, as it is called
because it represents a change in the way the or
ganization plans to spend its mone\ but not an
increase in its funding, was passed unanimously.
In other business. Melinda Basham. the stu

that all projects except the Lecture Note Service
did extremely well autumn quarter. Saying that
