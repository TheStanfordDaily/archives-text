# Streleski's comments could lengthen term
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Theodore Streleski, the convicted murderer of Stan
ford Mathematics Prof. Karel DeLeeuw, told reporters
last week that he is "indifferent" about whether or not
he'll kill again.
His remarks have not gone unnoticed. The state attor
ney general, the district attorney, and even the Secret
Service have had second thoughts about Streleski's
release next month, and now it appears that Streleski
will undergo a psychiatric evaluation which could result
in further detention.
In the past week, Streleski has granted seven inter
views to California reporters. Ruth Younger, a
spokesperson for Soledad Prison where Streleski is cur
rently imprisoned, said that Streleski had not originally
intended to talk to the press. However, he changed his
mind after a story about his impending release was
printed in The San Jose Mercury-News.
"In light of that article, Streleski felt that he
deserved 'equal time'," Younger said. In his interviews,
Streleski told reporters that he was "absolutely noncom
mittal on whether or not I will go back to Stanford and
kill again," and said that he had refused pyschiatric
treatment because the acceptance of treatment would
he admitting he had "done something wrong in doing the
murder."
"I said on the stand at my trial it was morally and
legally correct to do that (murder DeLeeuw)," he told
reporters.
According to Younger, Streleski did not consider the
remarks he made to the press to be "inflammatory."
Nevertheless, his comments have attracted attention at
both the local and national level.

Assistant Attorney General Steve White said the at
torney general's office only became seriously interested
in the Streleski case after they heard about the press in
terviews. Based on Streleski's comments, White said,
"we have made a recomendation for a psychiatric evalua
tion of Streleski."
Streleski has a "determinant" sentence (a sentence of
a specific number of years) rather than a life term. Ac
cording to White, a life sentence could be renewed, but
unless Streleski can be held by extraordinary means he
will be free in a month.
The deciding factor will be the psychiatric evaluation.
If it is determined that Streleski poses an "imminent
threat" to Stanford and to society. White explained
that he could be kept in custody.
"There is a provision in the California State Welfare
and Custody Code that allows for further confine
ment," White said.
The Code reads: "At the end of a fourteen-day per
iod, a person may be confined for further treatment for
a period not exceeding 180 days." The confinement per
iod is renewable.
White said he "couldn't begin to predict" whether
Streleski would be confined as a result of his evaluation.
"We are concerned that he might pose a threat to soci
ety," White said, "but there are many unusual dimen
sions to this case. We don't know enough about
Streleski's intentions towards Stanford."
Streleski's "intentions" toward Stanford are a Stan
ford concern as well. University Staff Counsel Iris Brest
said that the University was aware of recent develop
ments and was "actively looking at what could be done
to keep Streleski in jail." She added
that she could not comment on the
specific actions the University had
considered.
Another person concerned with
Streleski's comments is Marvin Has
kell. a spokesman for the San Fran
sisco Secret Service office. According
to Haskell, Streleski told a reporter
from The San Jose Mercury-News
that he was noncommital about kil
ling anyone â€” whether it be someone
from Stanford, Streleski himself or
the president of the United States.
It was the last remark that at

tracted the attention of the Secret
Service, Haskell said.
"We're interested in people who
have an unusual, threatening interest
in the president," Haskell said. "So
now we have to discover whether or
not Streleski has this sort of inter
est. How we're going to do that, I'd
rather not say."
Haskell added that a statement
specifically threatening the presi
dent can be considered a federal of
fense, and could be grounds for
prosecution.
Streleski has been incarcerated for
five-and-a-half years. In the early
stages of his imprisonment he told
reporters that he regarded his stay as
"a term of tenure with the state of
California," and said that he would

not leave prison before the end of his
sentence unless he received a "salary"
of $6000 a year, half of the money
the state spends on him at Soledad.
In light of this, it would seem that
his remarks to the press were an at
tempt by Streleski to lenghten his
jail term. However, Younger said
that Streleski had told her on several
occasions that he was ready to leave.
He has refused to work while im
prisoned; Younger said that he
spends his time doing math problems,
not as a continuation of his research,
but rather as a "hobby."
"He also reads research material he
can get his hands on, and reads a lot
of fiction," Younger said.
