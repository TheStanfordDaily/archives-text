# Soviet brass may be kept from Games
## 
### DUN GIFFORD, JR 
Without "advance permission"
from the U.S. government. Soviet
officials from the San Francisco
consulate will be barred from at
tending the Olympic soccer
matches scheduled to be played
here this summer, a State Depart
ment spokesperson told The Daily
yesterday.
Because the University is
"closed" to Soviet officials, con
sulate members "would have to
follow procedures" in order to at
tend the games, according to De
partment spokesperson Joanne
Reams. She declined to elaborate
on these procedures.
The Soviet officials will not be
able to circumvent this restriction
by using International Olympic
Committee (IOC) channels.
Reams said.
The statement comes in the
wake of a Dec. 19 State Depart
ment decision establishing Santa
Clara County and parts of San
Mateo County, as well as other
specified areas in the United
States, off-limits to Soviet offi
cials.
Ihe ruling does not pertain to
"those athletes and other Olym
pic delegation officials that are
properly accredited to the IOC,"
including Soviet journalists,
Reams said.

Soviet consulate officials in San
Francisco were unavailable for
comment.
George Broder, deputy press
secratary for the Los Angeles
Olympic Organizing Committee
(LAOOC), said it cannot be de
termined yet if the Soviets will be

among the teams playing at Stan
ford.
Locations for the first four
seeded teams have already been
assigned, Broder said. He would
not disclose where these teams
would play. The other sites include
Harvard, Annapolis and the Rose

Bowl.
The game locations and match
ups for the other teams will be de
termined in a draw, Broder said.
This draw, along with the
seedings, are overseen by the
Federation Internationale de Foot
ball Association and the LAOOC.
The results of the seeding and
the draw will be announced this
spring, Broder said. He would not
give a precise date.
John Boesch, soccer director for
the Stanford Olympic matches,
said it is inevitable that "one of
the top-seeded teams will be at
Stanford," since six of the 24
first-round matches will be here.
He added that it appears the
Soviets will be "one of the teams
that will make the first 16." The
Soviet soccer team won the
bronze medal in 1976 and 1980.
He said his organization will
provide facilities for a group of 30
people from each team, which in
cludes both team members and
officials.
"We expect no problems with
the officials," Broder said.
But he said he did not know
how the matter would be handled
by the State Department.
"A Soviet sports official is
probably a Soviet government of
ficial," he said.
