The Hoover Institution has been awarded a $1
million grant by the J.N. Pew Jr. Charitable Trust
to continue research in domestic affairs.
Of the $1 million. $900,000 will support
Hoover"s Domestic Studies Program and the
remaining $100,000 will be used by the National,
Peace and Public Affairs Fellows Program.
The Domestic Studies Program focuses on re
search on national and international public policy
issues such as welfare, taxation and education.
The National. Peace and Public Affairs Fellows
Program allows outstanding younger scholars to
spend a year at the Institution to do research and
writing on domestic and foreign issues.

The funds will be used to support fellowships,
grants and research, according to Dennis Bark,
senior fellow and associate director of the
Hoover Institution.
The Institution does not plan to use the funds
to increase the size of the two programs. Bark
said.
The Few grant is the second large grant the
Hoover Institution has received in recent
months. In December, the Institution received a
$900.000 grant from the National Endowment
for the Humanities.
According to Michael Oman, director of foun
dation and corporate relations for the Univer
sity's Office of Development, it is "not at all
unusual" for Hoover to receive such large grants.

The Institution has received annual support from
Pew grants for "the past seven or eight years,"
he said.
However, the present grant is the largest of
the Pew grants awarded to Hoover.
Other Stanford institutions have received sup
port from Pew grants in recent years as well. In
1981 a $500,000 grant was awarded to the
Humanities Center. Last fall 51 million was given
for scientific research at Stanford and $400,000
was awarded to the Program in Values. Technol
ogy, Society and Science. Oman said.
The Philadelphia-based Pew trusts were
founded in 1963 and held a $900 million endow
ment at the end of fiscal year 1979. Grants are
awarded to colleges and universities nationwide.
