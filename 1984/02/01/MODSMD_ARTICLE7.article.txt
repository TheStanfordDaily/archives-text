U.S. military expands
facilities in Honduras
Washington — U.S. military forces have taken advantage
nl si\ months ot maneuvers in Honduras to create a
"substantial, semipermanent military capability" in that
strategically-located Central American country without in
lorming Congress, according to a congressional staff report.
Construction of airstrips, housing, radar facilities, ocean
piers, roads, an 11-mile-long tank trap and other facilities
points to "significant additional U.S. military presence in
Honduras for an indefinite period." according to an un
published report of the House Armed Services military con
struction subcommittee. The facilities, particularly those
near the Nicaraguan border, could also be used by "other en
tities lit the U.S. government." the report states.
Administration officials who asked not to be identified
said Tuesday that they intend to station about 1000 U.S.
military personnel in Honduras when the series of exercises
known as Big Pine 2 ends late this month. A second lengthy
series of ground, air and naval exercises is expected to begin
this summer, although Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger has not formally approved those plans.
Democrats seek Beirut pull-out
Washington — In their most forceful and unified move
yet against the Reagan administration's policy in Lebanon,
House Democratic leaders agreed yesterday on a draft
resolution calling for the "prompt and orderly" withdrawal
of U.S. troops from Beirut but not setting a target date
for the pullout.
"Prompt removal is immediate, right away," House
Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill told reporters after a 14-
member Democratic task force had given its approval to
the dratt resolution. The resolution will be presented to
the House Democratic Caucus today and is expected
to be voted on by the House within a month.
lo attract bipartisan support, the task force opted for a
concurrent resolution, which shows a "sense of Congress"
but is not legally binding. Neither is it subject to a presiden
tial veto.
I he resolution, a somewhat tougher version of one
dratted Monday by Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), calls on
the President to report to Congress on progress of the
withdrawal within 30 days after the resolution is adopted.
South Africa to withdraw
Windhoek. Namibia — South African army and air force
unit based in this southwest African territory will begin to
disengage from conflict with black insurgents in neighbor
ing Angola. South African Prime Minister Pieter Botha an
nounced yesterday in Parliament.
It appeared to be the most significant development in
the past six years of negotiations by the United States and
four other Western countries to end the Namibian civil war
and to prepare the South African-ruled territory for in
dependence and national elections supervised by the United
Nations. A black-majority government is certain to result.
However. Botha warned that, for the cease-fire to
remain in effect, "necessary steps must, and indeed will be,
taken to ensure that our decision is not exploited at the ex
pense of the security ol the inhabitants of South-West
Africa (Namibia)."
Economy shows expansion
Washington — The government's Index of Leading Eco
nomic Indicators rose 0.6 percent in December after a brief
pause in November, reflecting continued moderation in the
nation's economic expansion, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
With the exception of November, when the index actual
ly dropped 0.2 percent, the rate of increase in the indicators
has been moderating since midyear.The index had been
growing at a fast clip during the first half of the year, in
creasing by 5.9 percent during the first quarter and 4.7 per
cent in the second. The third-quarter increase was a
markedly slower 2.8 percent.
The Commerce Department said preliminary estimates
for the fourth quarter show the index rising 2.0 percent.
U.S. will remain neutral in
Salvadoran presidential vote
San Sal\ador. El Salvador — Secretary of State George
Shultz brought encouragement and pressure from the
Reagan administration to El Salvador yesterday, telling of
ficials here to keep up the pace.

and South America, Shultz lunched with Salvadoran leaders
and the presidential candidates of six political parties,
promising that the United States will accept the outcome
of March 25 presidential elections here, no matter who
wins.
"The United States is neutral with regard to who wins
the elections, but we are not neutral, we are very much in
favor, of the democratic process," he told a press confer
ence.
This appeared to be a vow not to repeat the U.S. role in
the 1952 elections, when administration officials all but
openly intervened to block ultraconservative ex-major
Roberto D'Aubuisson, reported to have been linked to
death squad activity here, from being named provisional
president. He is now a leading presidential candidate,
rivaled only by Christian Democratic ex-president Jose
Napoleon Duarte.

Windhoek. Namibia — South African army and air force
unit based in this southwest African territory will begin to
disengage from conflict with black insurgents in neighbor
ing Angola. South African Prime Minister Pieter Botha an

It appeared to be the most significant development in
the past six years of negotiations by the United States and
four other Western countries to end the Namibian civil war
and to prepare the South African-ruled territory for in
dependence and national elections supervised by the United
Nations. A black-majority government is certain to result.

U.S. will remain neutral in
Salvadoran presidential vote
San Sal\ador. El Salvador — Secretary of State George
Shultz brought encouragement and pressure from the
Reagan administration to El Salvador yesterday, telling of
ficials here to keep up the pace.
At the first stop on a nine-day swing through Central
and South America, Shultz lunched with Salvadoran leaders
and the presidential candidates of six political parties,
promising that the United States will accept the outcome
of March 25 presidential elections here, no matter who
wins.
"The United States is neutral with regard to who wins
the elections, but we are not neutral, we are very much in
favor, of the democratic process," he told a press confer
ence.
This appeared to be a vow not to repeat the U.S. role in
the 1952 elections, when administration officials all but
openly intervened to block ultraconservative ex-major
Roberto D'Aubuisson, reported to have been linked to
death squad activity here, from being named provisional
president. He is now a leading presidential candidate,
rivaled only by Christian Democratic ex-president Jose
Napoleon Duarte.

U.S. military expands
facilities in Honduras
Washington — U.S. military forces have taken advantage
nl si\ months ot maneuvers in Honduras to create a
"substantial, semipermanent military capability" in that
strategically-located Central American country without in
lorming Congress, according to a congressional staff report.
Construction of airstrips, housing, radar facilities, ocean
piers, roads, an 11-mile-long tank trap and other facilities
points to "significant additional U.S. military presence in
Honduras for an indefinite period." according to an un
published report of the House Armed Services military con
struction subcommittee. The facilities, particularly those
near the Nicaraguan border, could also be used by "other en
tities lit the U.S. government." the report states.
Administration officials who asked not to be identified
said Tuesday that they intend to station about 1000 U.S.
military personnel in Honduras when the series of exercises
known as Big Pine 2 ends late this month. A second lengthy
series of ground, air and naval exercises is expected to begin
this summer, although Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger has not formally approved those plans.
Democrats seek Beirut pull-out
Washington — In their most forceful and unified move
yet against the Reagan administration's policy in Lebanon,
House Democratic leaders agreed yesterday on a draft
resolution calling for the "prompt and orderly" withdrawal
of U.S. troops from Beirut but not setting a target date
for the pullout.
"Prompt removal is immediate, right away," House
Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill told reporters after a 14-
member Democratic task force had given its approval to
the dratt resolution. The resolution will be presented to
the House Democratic Caucus today and is expected
to be voted on by the House within a month.
lo attract bipartisan support, the task force opted for a
concurrent resolution, which shows a "sense of Congress"
but is not legally binding. Neither is it subject to a presiden
tial veto.
I he resolution, a somewhat tougher version of one
dratted Monday by Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), calls on
the President to report to Congress on progress of the
withdrawal within 30 days after the resolution is adopted.
