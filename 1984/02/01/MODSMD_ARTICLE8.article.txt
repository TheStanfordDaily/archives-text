## Gemayel warns against withdrawal 
### 
From rhe Washington Post
Washington — President Amin Gemayel yes
terday warned the U.S. Congress that a withdrawal
ot the Marines from Lebanon now would mean the
end of Lebanese unity and democracy, and. beyond
that, would endanger Western interests in the Middle
East.
Contending that Washington's stakes in supporting
his government are very high, the Lebanese leader in
an interview challenged U.S. critics of the deplov
ment to consider the alternative.
Gemayel spoke against the backdrop of growing
pressure in Congress to challenge the Reagan admini
stration policy in Lebanon and to put the U.S. ser
vicemen out of Beirut. He said that if the Marines
left now. "there would not be a new president to
replace Amin Gemayel but a revolutionary council un
der Soviet control, or chaos."
Appearing upbeat and relaxed in the upstairs quar
ters of the presidential palace, Gemayel showed little
of the strain his 18-month-old government is under.
One of his young sons popped in for a hug and kiss

from Gemayel as he sat having a drink before the
luncheon interview with this correspondent and Step
hen Rosenfeld. deputy chief of the editorial page of
I he Washington Post. Once during the meal, the
palace shuddered from the explosion of an artillery
shell that landed on a nearby hill, a reminder of the
recurrent and often-deadly gunfire between the
Lebanese army and opposition militias.
"That's nothing," said Gemayel. giving a little
laugh and a dismissive wave of his hand. "That's a
daily event."
Saying the cause of Lebanon's political deadlock
was basically external rather than internal, the
Lebanese leader blamed Syria for blocking a security
plan to disengage warring Lebanese factions and
produce a cease-fire as well as the resumption of
reconciliation talks. He insisted that, without Syrian
interference, Lebanon's sectarian groups could
resolve their differences on the basis of an 1976 eon
stitutional reform proposal.
"Reconciliation among the Lebanese is not a big
problem," he said, differing markedly with opposition

parties who argue it is the dispute s eore.
Gemayel referred to current diplomatic etlorts to
start a political dialogue with Syria, which has been
refusing to negotiate an end to the Lebanese ciisis
unless the Beirut government abrogates an accord
signed May 17 with Israel. He said he had spoken by
telephone Monday with Syrian President Hafez As
sad. although he provided no details about the con
versation. Gemayel also stated an interest in meeting
with the Syrian leader.
Gemayel said intensive efforts by Saudi Arabia, the
United States and other intermediaries to persuade
the Syrians to be flexible on the May 17 accord issue
have not succeeded.
"We have not had a chance to sit down with the
Syrians and discuss the May 17 agreement, he said,
voicing exasperation at what he termed Damascus
ideological opposition to the document.
The accord provided for the withdrawal of Israeli
forces from Southern Lebanon within a short time
after its ratification and gives a basis tor the nor
malization of Lebanese —Israeli relations.
