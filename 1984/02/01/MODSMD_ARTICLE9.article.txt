# Reagan unveils budget to Congress
## 
### 
From The Washington Post
Washington — President Rea
gan yesterday unveiled to congres
sional leaders a $925.5 billion election
year budget with a SI 80.4 billion
deficit as he bowed to pressure for def
icit reductions without spelling out
major new tax increases or program
cuts.
The fiscal 1985 budget that Reagan
will formally present to Congress today
would continue his military buildup by
boosting Pentagon spending authority
to $305 billion, an after-inflation in
crease of 13 percent. Spending for nu
clear programs would push total

defense spending authority to $313 bil
lion.
The proposed budget would cut
domestic spending by $4.6 billion, con
siderably less than Reagan proposed in
his three earlier budgets, although cuts
in programs for the poor and the elderly
are expected to be highly controversial.
The budget would also raise taxes by
less than $8 billion, mostly through
loophole closing and taxation of health
insurance benefits, an idea that went
nowhere in Congress last year.
According to congressional sources,
programs targeted for cuts include
many low-income programs that

Congress slashed at Reagan's behest, in
cluding food stamps and other nutri
tion programs, welfare, housing
assistance. Medicaid and energy aid.
Reagan would save $1 billion from
Medicare by freezing doctors' fees and
increasing some patient costs and $700
million by delaying and limiting cost-of
living increases for federal retirees.
The Medicare savings are only half of
the amount that the administration
proposed only a few weeks ago before it
was forccd to retreat in the face of an
outcry from members of both parties in
Congress, who feared that big cuts in
health care for the elderly would

boomerang in a campaign year.
Of the $7.N billion in revenue in
creases proposed for next year, about
half would come from closing an assort
ment of tax loopholes. The rest would
come from requiring employees to pay
Social Security and income taxes on
employer-paid health insurance
premiums exceeding $175 a month for
families or $70 a month for individuals.
These benefits are currently not
taxable, and a Reagan proposal to tax
them died in Congress last year.
The budget reflects a total spending
increase of $71.8 billion over current
levels, more than half of it for defense.
