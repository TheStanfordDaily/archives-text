BEAUTY
New shaving creams for men
contain natural ingredients
like wheat germ, coconut oil,
aloe, and vitamin E.
* * *
Even out your makeup with a
light all-over dusting of
colorless translucent loose
powder.
* * #
for good health, eat the skins
of apples and other
thin-skinned fruits and
vegetables. That's where
many vitamins are stored.

To relax feet, stand barefoot
on a tennis ball, roll ball
along length of the sole.
# ♦ #
Sensitive skin? Treat it
gently. Avoid scrubbing,
rubbing with towels,
abrasives, and cell-sloughing
treatments.
