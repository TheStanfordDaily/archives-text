# Cranston fund-raiser here violated non-partisan rules

### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
A University investigation is underway to deter
mine whether a fund-raising reception for presiden
tial candidate Sen. Alan Cranston held at the Faculty
Club last Wednesday violated University guidelines.
Federal and state law prohibit the University from
"intervening in any manner on behalf of any can
didate for public office." Yet the California Demo
crat's reception netted about $6000, according to
Robert Moulton, former associate director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and the Faculty
Club member who reserved the club for the event.
"What we have here is a discovery after the fact of
an inappropriate activity," University Registrar Sally

Mahoney said. Mahoney is the administrative officer
responsible for interpretation and application of the
University guidelines on partisan political activities.
The matter is confused by a chain of mix-ups in
volving Mahoney, the Faculty Club manager and
Moulton. This confusion apparently prevented the
University from stopping the fund-raiser, even
though it had prior knowledge of the reception.
Mahoney confirmed that she is in the process of
gathering information about the fund-raiser, which
followed Cranston's speech at Kresge Auditorium.
"I'm doing some fact gathering," Mahoney said.
"When I have all of the facts. I will report them to
the provost and president."
