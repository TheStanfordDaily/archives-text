# Cranston fund-raiser here violated non-partisan rules
## 
### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
A University investigation is underway to deter
mine whether a fund-raising reception for presiden
tial candidate Sen. Alan Cranston held at the Faculty
Club last Wednesday violated University guidelines.
Federal and state law prohibit the University from
"intervening in any manner on behalf of any can
didate for public office." Yet the California Demo
crat's reception netted about $6000, according to
Robert Moulton, former associate director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and the Faculty
Club member who reserved the club for the event.
"What we have here is a discovery after the fact of
an inappropriate activity," University Registrar Sally

Mahoney said. Mahoney is the administrative officer
responsible for interpretation and application of the
University guidelines on partisan political activities.
The matter is confused by a chain of mix-ups in
volving Mahoney, the Faculty Club manager and
Moulton. This confusion apparently prevented the
University from stopping the fund-raiser, even
though it had prior knowledge of the reception.
Mahoney confirmed that she is in the process of
gathering information about the fund-raiser, which
followed Cranston's speech at Kresge Auditorium.
"I'm doing some fact gathering," Mahoney said.
"When I have all of the facts. I will report them to
the provost and president."

University officials are investigating presidential hopeful Alan Cranston's reception at the Faculty Club
last week, which they say violated Stanford's rules against partisan fund raising on campus.
Mahoney said that this event
might "pose a real problem" unless
the Faculty Club Board establishes
procedures to prevent similar events
from happening again.
According to Mahoney. a fund
raiser for a political candidate would
be a violation of University rules. A
memo obtained from the Registrar's
Office outlines the University posi
tion on partisan political activities.
"The University is prohibited bv
law from intervening in any manner
on behalf of any candidate for public
office, including such activities as
solicitation of funds or endorse
ments," the memo states. "No group
or individual supporting candidates
tor public office or engaging in other
political activities may use Univer
sity space or facilities or receive Uni
versity support."
Another campus presidential
campaign group is angry because it
opßlends the University knew about
event beforehand but did noth

ing to stop it. Jell Phillips, a leader
of the Students with (Sen. Gary)
Hart organization, said that he con
tacted Mahoney on the Monday
preceding the fund-raiser.
According to Phillips. Mahoney
said that she would look into it.
After the event had taken place.
Phillips again called Mahoney and
asked. "Win did this event go on?"
Mahoney said she had contacted
the Faculty Club the day of the
speech, hut "the staff with whom I
talked on Wednesday were not aware
that there was any fund-raiser." she
said.
Faculty Club Manager Mario
Scherrer confirmed that he had not
known that there was a fund-raiser.
"To my knowledge, there was no
fund-raiser. Nobody reserved a room
to raise money for a political cam
paign." Scherrer said.
According to Scherrer. all he knew
was that "a (club) member had a
cocktail party and had Alan Cranston
as a guest."
Moulton said that the club knew
that Cranston was coming.
"The Faculty Club knew very well

that we were having a reception." he
said. He added that the club probably
wasn't told that it was going to be a
fund-raising event.
"It was just ignorance of the
rules." Moulton said. "I don't think
that we would have tried to do fund
raising in academic facilities of the
University. Hut we had no reason to
think that the Faculty Club was a
place where this was prohibited."
The employees at the Cranston for
President office in San Francisco also
weren't aware of the University rules
which prohibit political fund raising
on campus. A spokeswoman in
Cranston's office said that her of
fice wasn't informed of the rule until
she was called yesterday by Mahoney.
"Nobody ever said any thing to us."
said the spokeswoman.
Phillips said that lie has filed a for
mal protest with the University om
budsman. "We are requesting that
every other presidential campaign be
able to hold a fund-raiser at the Fac
ulty Club."
When asked about this possibility.
Mahoney said she doubted whether
such activities were appropriate.
