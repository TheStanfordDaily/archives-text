## The 						Stanford Daily Launch weightless lab 
### 
If Congress approves President Reagan's pro
posed space station — and it should — the gains
in scientific research would he substantial. The
facility sounds a little far-out, and the poten
tial for abuse b\ industry and military certainly
exists, but the benefits far outweigh the draw
backs.
While industry should he able to profit from a
weightless factory, the opportunities for re
search in a weightless laboratory are so varied
and numerous that they should be the purpose
of the station. Society's knowledge of biology,
physics and astronomy would grow extensively
and quickly. Also, the technology that would be
developed in constructing the station would be
invaluable, in much the same manner that previ
ous space programs are responsible for today's
computer technology.
Industrial applications are inevitable, and
already, U.S. industries are looking forward to
producing new alloys, perfect ball bearings and
large silicon chips which would significantly in
crease the power of computers.

Unfortunately, the military potential of a
space station is also considerable. Surveillance
equipment and sophisticated "Star Wars"
weaponry are candidates for the military abuse
of the station.
An issue disputed on campus is the question
of manning the station. A group of Stanford
scientists feels that the station should be un
manned to keep costs down and to provide for
slower, more thorough construction of a larger
space complex.
It should be clear by now that man is invalua
ble in space. Throughout all the NASA missions,
he has shown that there are problems which only
man can solve, and observations that only man
can see.
We support the construction of a manned
space station to prov ide basic scientific research
which can only be done in space. Research should
be the focus of the mission, and we hope that
the space station becomes neither a factory for
wealthy industries nor an orbiting battleship for
the Pentagon.
