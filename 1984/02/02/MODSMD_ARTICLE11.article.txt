# Let's shorten and simplify presidential election years

I once attempted to explain to a
Lebanese friend, no stranger to
labyrinthine political systems, how
Americans choose a president. After
lalf an hour of caucuses, primaries,
:onventions and electoral colleges,
lc'd had more than his fill. After a

Americans, and the inevitable "let's

abolish the electoral college" articles
will make their quadrennial appear
ance in the newspapers. So let me be
the first of this election year to
weigh in with some practical
proposals for reform.
First, shorten the whole process.
Many have pointed out that election
campaigns in other industrial
democracies last only a few weeks, so
why not in the United States, too.
The counter-argument usually runs
that size and diversity of the United
States precludes this possibility here.
The force of this argument, however,
is ever weakening as the influence of
television grows. Furthermore, there
are other large and diverse
countries — Canada, Australia and
India — where short campaigns
suffice.
We will gain several things by limit
ing campaigns to a couple of months.
First, this is one way of reducing
campaign costs which set astonishing
new records each time an election
rolls around. Such a reduction will
make elections more equitable; as it
is now only multi-millionaires and
their friends can realistically pursue
the presidency. The burden on third-

party and independent candidates,
who usually receive no federal fun
ding. will be eased. Secondly, the
exaggerated influence exerted by
picayune states like New Hampshire
will diminish if states hold their
caucuses and primaries at roughly the
same time.
M\ next suggestion is for a more

unilbrm method of selecting conven
tion delegates. There is currently so
much variety from state to state,
and from election to election, as to
be whimsical. In some states
caucuses, with varying degrees of par
ticipation. choose all the delegates;
some others hold pi Lories in which
only registered party members may
vote in that party's primary. It is this
last system which accounts for
George Wallace's good showing in the
1976 Michigan Democratic primary,
in which many Republican
"crossover" voters essentially
sabotaged the results.
Then there is the matter of appor
tioning delegates, which has already
aroused the wrath of some of this
year's Democratic hopefuls. A sen
sible way of doing this is to allocate a
state's delegates to candidates in
proportion to the percentage of the
votes they receive. However, some
state parties have written the rules
(they get rewritten for each elec
tion) so that a candidate will receive
no delegates if his or her percentage
of the vote is less than, say, 20 per
cent.
Understandably, dark horse candi

dates like Jesse Jackson are upset by
such rules, which serve effectively to
reduce their chances further. A more
extreme case is the winner-take-all
primary, a slimy device masquerading
as an election. George McGovern and
his partisans had these instituted in
several states under the guise of
"democratizing" delegate selection.
The resulting electoral disaster
should have convinced the
Democrats not to choose delegates
in such a way that they all represent
one candidate on the fringe of the
party, but it hasn't.
One may legitimately ask why a
political party should not have the
sole right to determine how its con
vention delegates will be chosen.
However, when states provide par
ties with the facilities to hold prima
ries and the federal government
finances their presidential nominees,
the parties are no longer just private
organizations, but a public concern.
If the goal of primaries is to give the
average voter a say in choosing the
major parties' candidates, then let's
get rid of crossover and winner-take
all systems which distort this pur
pose.

If the goal of primaries is to give the
average voter a say in choosing the
major parties' candidates, then let's get
rid of crossover and winner-take-all
systems which distort this purpose.

Finally, there's the question of the
electoral college. Nearly everyone
thinks this should go into history's
trash can. but that is unlikely to hap
pen. The problem is that changing to
a system of direct presidential elec
tions requires amending the consti
tution, a slow process with doubtful
prospects of success. But short of

abolishing the electoral college, there
are other reforms for which a con
stitutional amendment wouldn't be
needed. As it stands, if Reagan wins
51 percent of the popular vote in
California next November, he will
receive all 47 of the state's electoral
votes. But there is no reason why
electoral votes could not be allocated
proportionally, so that Reagan would
receive 24 electoral votes and his op
ponents) 23. Alternatively, each
congressional district could be given
one electoral vote, which would go to
the candidate receiving a plurality in
that district. The two remaining
electoral votes that each state is en
titled to could be awarded, as now,
on an at-large basis. This method
would also reflect the popular vote
more closely, since it is unlikely that
one candidate would get a plurality in
every one of a state's congressional
districts.
I've tried to confine myself here to
proposals that seem politically possi
ble. One sometimes sees more radical
suggestions put forth — that the
United States switch to a parliamen
tary system, for instance. Whatever

its merits, this just won't happen.
But shortening and simplifying the
presidential election system would, I
suspect, revive a process that has
turned off too many voters.
