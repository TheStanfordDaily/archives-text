## Stanford: where rich really means rich 
### 
Although there is a difference between being
poor and being a poor Stanford student, there is
none between being rich and a rich Stanford stu
dent. since anyone who is rich at Stanford is
probably rich anywhere in the world.
My parents had told me that I would meet
some very wealthy people at Stanford. When I
first heard how much expenses for one year at

school would be I was aghast. "No one could pay
that." I exclaimed. I was even more aghast when I
discovered that some people could afford it.
comfortably, without scholarship, loan or work
study. Admittedly, I was naive. My parents could
hardly afford it even with all three.
Mother was afraid I'd feel poor and tried to
prevent it by buying clothes that would make me
"look like the rich kids." Unfortunately, 1 dis
covered that rich kids wear jeans with holes in
them, T-shirts and no socks. I had to tell my moth
er that the nice, preppy clothes she had bought
were failing to make me look like my friends
from prep schools. I tried to explain it to one ot
my rich friends who had graduated from St.
Paul's. "But who wants to look rich?" he asked,
in sincere bewilderment. "Poor people do. that's
who," I answered, surprised over the necessity of
such an explanation.
Nice clothes and fancy food, things I actively
desired, were "useless items our material society
has made us depend upon." Ski gear and expensi\ e
electronic equipment did not. however, fall into
this category.
There was more than a touch of irony in mv

rich friends' anti-materialism. In their eyes I was
terribly materialistic, worrying about money,
taking scrupulous care of my belongings so they'd
last. But they could afford to be carefree
spendthrifts, and untied to their possessions.
They were, in fact, ready to renounce their
worldly trappings and demonstrate the strength
of their social consciences. You've got to have
worldly trappings to renounce before you can
renounce them. I hated to tell them, but poor
people want material comfort and worldly trap
pings. and would never listen to these voluntarily
penniless reformers denouncing the kind of life
they were all after.
Of course, the poor probably don't know just
what all the rich way of life involves, as I had not
known before I came to Stanford. In other
cultures, the untouchables live right next door to
the Brahmins, and although this may make the
Brahmins seem terribly callous in our eyes, at
least the untouchables know of everything the
Brahmins do and exactly what they themselves
are missing. In our society, however, the rich are
\erv esoteric about their doings: they refuse to
acknowledge their richness even among them
selves. My friends didn't know how much their
parents made; they'd never been told. "We're
not upper class: we're upper middle-class, I kept
hearing, but what with second homes in Europe
or on Pacific islands, ski vacations twice a year (I
had never been skiing) and prep or private school
educations, they weren't members of the middle
class (upper-middle class before I came to Stan
ford!) ot which I considered myself a part. I.ike
skiing, another rich kids' habit I learned about
was cocaine. I had to ask what "lines were.
Cocaine is more expensive than gold! Doesn't

that amaze anyone besides me?
My rich friends loved my naivete which meant
so much embarrassment to me. Often it seemed 1
was the only one who got frustrated, flew into
rages, suffered broken hearts, missed home like
crazy, cried over sad books and movies, and had
nightmares which made me scream. If and when
my wealthy friends had problems, they dealt with
them quietly and gracefully — not like me. I
could neither repay the food to which they
treated me nor the emotional support they gave;
they required just as little as they required
money. The wealthy way of life contributes to
individualism and self-reliance (perhaps one rea
son why the poor are always told, "We made it, so
can you.") Whereas mine had been a close-knit
family, my friends saw their parents only on vaca
tions home from boarding school and even during
the summer they were off hosteling in Europe or
away at the family's second home.
In my eyes they seemed so carefree and conse
quently. a bit careless. Yet they wanted to care
— about the poor and the environment and the
souls of suffering artists and musicians who sang
working men's blues.
I worried about the next major expense and
how to acquire some desired possession
(typewriter, bicycle, etc.) while my friends
worried whether or not to abandon theirs and
seek a guru. I worried about making a living, while
they worried about their meaning in life. Which
one ol us is better off? Only a year ago I would
never have thought to ask.
