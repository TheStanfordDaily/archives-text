## Landing Reagan center 
### 
Edwin Meese's letter of Jan. 17 to
William Kimball, president of Stan
ford's Board of Trustees, now puts
the issue of the center for public
affairs into a different perspective.
The main issue now is whether the
trustees will make land available for
a private foundation independent of
both Stanford and Hoover.
Legally speaking, it is a decision
for the trustees to make.
Over the years Stanford has made
land available for many purposes,
including commercial development as
well as autonomous research
centcrs such as the Center for Ad
vanced Studies for the Behavioral
Sciences. In the case of the CASBS,
Stanford obtained assurances that it
would be governed in a way that
incorporated the usual standards ol
scholarly review. No doubt the same
guarantees could be obtained for
the proposed center.
The debate over the center's
governance lias been very one-sided.
Some University faculty questioned
whether a center administered by
Hoover might become politically
partisan, thereby jeopardizing Stan
ford's independence. One can also
turn the question around. What
would be the guarantees that a
center under University governance
would not fall under the sway of one
or another group of partisan adv
ocates on campus in the manner of
some other University-administered
activities?
University President Donald Ken
nedy himself suggested last fall that
a public affairs center must be
"harmonized" with other campus
activities. One naturally asks: har
monized with which other activities?
Some Stanford-administered activi
ties are unabashedly political in their
advocacy. Interestingly, nobody has
claimed that these other activities
pose a threat to Stanford's academ
ic independence.
In any case, the University admin
istration could not guarantee that a
public affairs center would remain
non-partisan without potentially
jeopardizing the academic freedom
of the students and faculty choosing
to participate in the center. By

contrast, an independently governed
center could both guarantee the
selection of scholars strictly on the
basis of academic merit and also
promote balanced and non-partisan
policy research. It would not be
credible as a national research center
if it did otherwise. One cannot
imagine the president of the United
States wanting a center that was
disdained by the scholarly communi
ty because of a reputation for par
tisan bias.
It is troubling that Kennedy
should imply (Jan. IS) that an inde
pendent center would necessarily be
linked to President Reagan's politi
cal philosophy, and that he should
assert farther that because of
Reagan's distinctive philosophy, it
"becomes all the more important
for the University to assure both
the fact and the appearance of
political neutrality." In saying this,
the president unfairly prejudges the
sincerity of the center's eventual
trustees in guaranteeing the center's
scholarly and non-partisan pursuit ol
knowledge. What is especially unfor
tunate is that such assertions also
lend credence to the view that par
tisan politics are at the root of the
University's resistance to the cen
ter.
To deny a Stanford location to an
independently governed public af
fairs center is not only very likely to
be perceived by the public as a
politically motivated decision, one
grounded in the animosities some
faculty and students feel towards
the Reagan presidency, but can
only be so interpreted. The idea of
locating a center here has already
been agreed to. Independent trus
teeship for the center not only
guarantees Stanford's independence
for those faculty who are concerned
but will serve to guarantee the
center's own independence from
campus politics as well.
If the center is denied University
land, then it will have become one of
several victims of partisan campus
politics.
