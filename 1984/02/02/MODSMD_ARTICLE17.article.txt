## That Yankee fighting spirit: 'Sudden Impact' and 'Uncommon Valor' 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Neither the superbly
crafted, provocative Under
Fire nor the draggy, vaguely
anti-establishment Silk wood
really conveys the mood of the
times; far more Americans
have gone to see Uncommon
Valor and Sudden Impact, which
are true Reagan era films.
They're so far right that you
may stare at them in disbelief,
or laugh at their naivete, and
possibly Sudden Impact, the
latest "Dirty Harry" Callahan
adventure, satisfies audiences
just because of its clunkiness
and predictability — it's like
watching the newest episode
of a TV cop series that basi
cally repeats itself every week.
In other words, it may be
foolish to take the popularity
of Sudden Impact as a serious
indication of the political ten
dencies of the American audi
ence. However, it's useful to
examine what moviegoers take
into their systems when they
swallow a picture like Sudden
Impact.
By 1984 — more than a
dozen years after Don Siegel
brought out the original Dirty
Harry — we are so familiar
with what Harry Callahan
(Clint Eastwood) stands for
that it has long since ceased to
have any emotional force. Har
ry is a one-man vigilante crew, a
dedicated hater of criminals
("scum," in Harry's jargon), a
modern cowboy of superhuman
skill and strength, and a
renegade because he can't
tolerate the effete milky
liberalism (or political brown
nosing or downright incom
petence) of his superiors in the
San Francisco Police Depart
ment. He pursues those who
break the law: Since the law
seems bent on impeding his
work by protecting the scum,
he serves a higher justice — the
divine justice of Harry Cal
lahan. whose steely gaze
penetrates the heart of the
scum.
The pattern of a Dirty Harry
movie permits the audience to
indulge vicariously in the sadis
tic pleasures of brutality, be
cause there's no sting to the
conscience in the end: Harry
may stomp on the law but the
movie sees to it that he's al
ways right. No one he maims or
tortures or kills ever turns out
to be innocent. In fact, the vil
lains are generally depicted as
such repulsive, squealing
lowlite that Harry's wasting
them practically constitutes
euthanasia as well as exter
mination.
Sudden Impact provides the
Dirty Harry package with a
new bow. The murderess Harry
is trying to track down in the
small town of San Paulo, Jen
nifer Spencer (Sondra Locke),
is exacting a gruesome revenge
on the punks who raped her and
her sister (who became
catatonic as a consequence of
the attack) years ago.
So this time around it's the
victims who are the scum, and
in a sense Jennifer is Harry's
double. She's not even his
darker self, really: the murders

she commits are no more cruel
or painful than some of the
"justice" he's meted out over
the years. And though I
thought Sondra Locke's syph
ilitic pre-Raphaelite looks
were bizarrely incongruous in
this movie, and I hated her per
lormance almost as much as
Eastwood's (they both act
with their faces — she narrows
hers into a vicious schoolgirl's
scowl while he exercises every
muscle in his; he must need a
mudpack at the end of a day's

shooting), I must confess I was
fascinated to find out how the
movie would dispose of her in
the end. Would it attempt to
claim Harry's moral superiority
over her and shift Harry's sym
pathies in order to justify his
turning her in? Would it
become a tragedy, with Harry
arresting her despite the
dictates of his vigilante con
science? Would it evade the
issue completely by using her
obviously precarious mental
state as an excuse for her incar

ce ration?
The conclusion that
Eastwood (who also functions
as director here) and
screenwriter Joseph Stimson
choose is actually consistent
with the point of view of the
picture; it doesn't compromise,
as all of the endings 1 have sug
gested would. But because it
takes Dirty Harrydom to an
extreme, it is also so prepos
terous that you wonder — for
a moment — if there isn't
some colossal joke going on, if

■
you haven't been watching a
parody all along. But one
glance at Clint Eastwood's
face convinces you that the
parody is unconscious.
Eastwood believes in this
borderline neo-fascist vision of
justice, and if the movie is fi
nally inoffensive, it's because
he's too fogheaded to be con
sidered any kind of thinker and
too clumsy to be considered
any sort of manipulator (unlike
Don Siegel, for example). No
one who is as pathetic as
Eastwood is at directing actors
— Sudden Impact contains the
most laughable collection of
supporting performances since
the heyday of Republic
Pictures — and no one who
could let his composer (Lalo
Schifrin) write theme music
that sounds like a rumba with
bubbles in it, could really con
stitute much of a threat.
Uncommon Valor is another
story: It's very well made (by
Ted Kotcheff), and effective
enough to be disturbing. Both
movies resuscitate insidious old
cliches. In Sudden Impact we
are told, once again, that small
towns create morally crippled
half-monsters who derive their
only pleasure from destroying
whatever innocence remains in
their midst. (This notion seems
a little odd in the chic cafes of
downtown Santa Cruz, where

the film was shot. Eastwood
should at least have moved his
crew to Mountain View.)
Uncommon Valor sells us the
antique philosophy — in Amer
ican drama, it dates as far back
as What Price Glory? — that
war is the noblest activity in
which man can participate be
cause it tests his masculine
virtues and brings him closer to
other men. You'd think that
Vietnam would have finished
off this homoerotic fantasy of
war, but — surprise! — Uncom
mon Valor is set in Vietnam, or
rather in Laos, where a retired
flier, Lt. Col. John Rhodes
(Gene Hackman), and a few
Vietnam vets revisit the scene
of their youth in 1978, bent on
rescuing Americans reported
missing in action (including
Rhodes' son) from a POW
compound.
Joe Gayton's script allows
Kotcheff to exercise his tal
ents for both violence and sen

timentality. The movie begins
with Rhodes and his wife
watching the return of the
troops in 1972 on TV; Rhodes
lies awake all night remember
ing his absent son, and he
determines to work for his
recovery until he receives proof
that the boy is no longer alive.
When a military pal
scrounges up an aerial photo
graph confirming the existence
of POWs in Laos, Rhodes
rounds up three of his son's
army buddies, two other vets
with air force training and a
young man whose father — we
learn in the film's most shame
lessly maudlin scene — was re
ported missing in action. (Since
none of the characters ever
refers to this fact again,
Gayton and Kotcheff's sole
purpose in including it must
have been to squeeze our emo
tions.) In a life-size reconstruc
tion of the Laotian compound,
financed by his best friend
(Robert Stack), the father of
another MIA, Rhodes trains
the group for a few weeks — or
rather he encourages them to
train each other by reviving
their knowledge of guerilla
warfare; then he flies them
overseas.

The movie really works you
over: You can't fail to respond
to a loving father's search for
his son (it's an archetypal dra
matic situation) or to the
plight of American boys wast
ing away as prisoners of war
for years after the war has of
ficially ended. But Uncommon
Valor exudes a poisonous odor
distilled from a mixture of love
of comrades, battle horror,
culled from the well known
stories of the hellish trials
American soldiers endured in
Vietnam, and soured
chauvinism.
In a speech to the men he has
assembled to carry out his
lunatic-heroic project, Rhodes
swears that America's shame
at losing the war provoked her
negligence toward the men who
had fought in it. The
filmmakers recycle the post
war trauma of The Best Years
of Our Lives (several scenes are
actually lifted from that film)
and filter it through the macho
admiration that creeps into
even some of the best writing
about Vietnam (like Michael

Herr's Dispatches), where it is,
however, strongly tempered by
the feelings of guilt and
futility that marked this par
ticular war. Uncommon Valor is
a cuckoo revisionist view of
Vietnam, in which the good guy
Yankees resurface and win.
All through the movie, I
wished that someone else had
been playing Rhodes. Not that
Gene Hackman is bad: lie gives
an intelligent, muted perfor
mance in the first half of the
movie. But the chief virtue of
his acting here is in what it
avoids, not what it achieves,
and if you find the film offen
sive (as I did), then Hackman's
acting is not a sufficient im
pediment to . your finding
Rhodes objectionable.
In the second hour I stopped
watching Hackman. because it
seemed to me that in this un
fair contest between the actor
and the material, the material
had to emerge victorious. Even
that phenomenal, tightly
wound scene-stealer, Fred
Ward, doesn't make much of
an impression a-s the claustro-

phobic Wilkes. The only per
former in the movie who shows
any freshness is L.A. comic Tim
Thomerson, whose slightly
lopsided line readings evidence
(as they did in Take This Job
and Shove It) a running inner
monologue that keeps the
character sane.
The credits list John Milius
as co-producer, and Uncommon
Valor has a strong kinship to
the right-wing tables Milius
himself has concocted as
screenwriter and director (The
LTfe and Times of Judge Hoy
Bean. The Wind and the Lion.
etc.).' And it's the second
movie Ted Kotcheff Ikis made
about Vietnam veterans who
continue to fight the war after
they've returned home. (Two
years ago he directed First
Blood. in which Sylvester
Stallone used Green Beret tac
tics to combat a small-town
police force with an unreasona
ble bias against him. It
combined elements of both the
myths Sudden Impact and Un
common Valor buy into.) The
Milius-Kotcheff collaboration
turns this movie into a macho
wish fulfillment fantasy. Un
common Valor bemoans the
fact that we can't return to
the grand old days of the Viet
nam War, when the Yankee
fighting spirit soared and men
were really men.

wound scene-stealer, Fred
Ward, doesn't make much of
an impression a-s the claustro-

phobic Wilkes. The only per
former in the movie who shows
any freshness is L.A. comic Tim
Thomerson, whose slightly
lopsided line readings evidence
(as they did in Take This Job
and Shove It) a running inner
monologue that keeps the
character sane.
The credits list John Milius
as co-producer, and Uncommon
Valor has a strong kinship to
the right-wing tables Milius
himself has concocted as
screenwriter and director (The
LTfe and Times of Judge Hoy
Bean. The Wind and the Lion.
etc.).' And it's the second
movie Ted Kotcheff Ikis made
about Vietnam veterans who
continue to fight the war after
they've returned home. (Two
years ago he directed First
Blood. in which Sylvester
Stallone used Green Beret tac
tics to combat a small-town
police force with an unreasona
ble bias against him. It
combined elements of both the
myths Sudden Impact and Un
common Valor buy into.) The
Milius-Kotcheff collaboration
turns this movie into a macho
wish fulfillment fantasy. Un
common Valor bemoans the
fact that we can't return to
the grand old days of the Viet
nam War, when the Yankee
fighting spirit soared and men
were really men.

Neither the superbly
crafted, provocative Under
Fire nor the draggy, vaguely
anti-establishment Silk wood
really conveys the mood of the
times; far more Americans
have gone to see Uncommon
Valor and Sudden Impact, which
are true Reagan era films.
They're so far right that you
may stare at them in disbelief,
or laugh at their naivete, and
possibly Sudden Impact, the
latest "Dirty Harry" Callahan
adventure, satisfies audiences
just because of its clunkiness
and predictability — it's like
watching the newest episode
of a TV cop series that basi
cally repeats itself every week.
In other words, it may be
foolish to take the popularity
of Sudden Impact as a serious
indication of the political ten
dencies of the American audi
ence. However, it's useful to
examine what moviegoers take
into their systems when they
swallow a picture like Sudden
Impact.
By 1984 — more than a
dozen years after Don Siegel
brought out the original Dirty
Harry — we are so familiar
with what Harry Callahan
(Clint Eastwood) stands for
that it has long since ceased to
have any emotional force. Har
ry is a one-man vigilante crew, a
dedicated hater of criminals
("scum," in Harry's jargon), a
modern cowboy of superhuman
skill and strength, and a
renegade because he can't
tolerate the effete milky
liberalism (or political brown
nosing or downright incom
petence) of his superiors in the
San Francisco Police Depart
ment. He pursues those who
break the law: Since the law
seems bent on impeding his
work by protecting the scum,
he serves a higher justice — the
divine justice of Harry Cal
lahan. whose steely gaze
penetrates the heart of the
scum.
The pattern of a Dirty Harry
movie permits the audience to
indulge vicariously in the sadis
tic pleasures of brutality, be
cause there's no sting to the
conscience in the end: Harry
may stomp on the law but the
movie sees to it that he's al
ways right. No one he maims or
tortures or kills ever turns out
to be innocent. In fact, the vil
lains are generally depicted as
such repulsive, squealing
lowlite that Harry's wasting
them practically constitutes
euthanasia as well as exter
mination.
Sudden Impact provides the
Dirty Harry package with a
new bow. The murderess Harry
is trying to track down in the
small town of San Paulo, Jen
nifer Spencer (Sondra Locke),
is exacting a gruesome revenge
on the punks who raped her and
her sister (who became
catatonic as a consequence of
the attack) years ago.
So this time around it's the
victims who are the scum, and
in a sense Jennifer is Harry's
double. She's not even his
darker self, really: the murders

she commits are no more cruel
or painful than some of the
"justice" he's meted out over
the years. And though I
thought Sondra Locke's syph
ilitic pre-Raphaelite looks
were bizarrely incongruous in
this movie, and I hated her per
lormance almost as much as
Eastwood's (they both act
with their faces — she narrows
hers into a vicious schoolgirl's
scowl while he exercises every
muscle in his; he must need a
mudpack at the end of a day's

shooting), I must confess I was
fascinated to find out how the
movie would dispose of her in
the end. Would it attempt to
claim Harry's moral superiority
over her and shift Harry's sym
pathies in order to justify his
turning her in? Would it
become a tragedy, with Harry
arresting her despite the
dictates of his vigilante con
science? Would it evade the
issue completely by using her
obviously precarious mental
state as an excuse for her incar

ce ration?
The conclusion that
Eastwood (who also functions
as director here) and
screenwriter Joseph Stimson
choose is actually consistent
with the point of view of the
picture; it doesn't compromise,
as all of the endings 1 have sug
gested would. But because it
takes Dirty Harrydom to an
extreme, it is also so prepos
terous that you wonder — for
a moment — if there isn't
some colossal joke going on, if

■
you haven't been watching a
parody all along. But one
glance at Clint Eastwood's
face convinces you that the
parody is unconscious.
Eastwood believes in this
borderline neo-fascist vision of
justice, and if the movie is fi
nally inoffensive, it's because
he's too fogheaded to be con
sidered any kind of thinker and
too clumsy to be considered
any sort of manipulator (unlike
Don Siegel, for example). No
one who is as pathetic as
Eastwood is at directing actors
— Sudden Impact contains the
most laughable collection of
supporting performances since
the heyday of Republic
Pictures — and no one who
could let his composer (Lalo
Schifrin) write theme music
that sounds like a rumba with
bubbles in it, could really con
stitute much of a threat.
Uncommon Valor is another
story: It's very well made (by
Ted Kotcheff), and effective
enough to be disturbing. Both
movies resuscitate insidious old
cliches. In Sudden Impact we
are told, once again, that small
towns create morally crippled
half-monsters who derive their
only pleasure from destroying
whatever innocence remains in
their midst. (This notion seems
a little odd in the chic cafes of
downtown Santa Cruz, where

the film was shot. Eastwood
should at least have moved his
crew to Mountain View.)
Uncommon Valor sells us the
antique philosophy — in Amer
ican drama, it dates as far back
as What Price Glory? — that
war is the noblest activity in
which man can participate be
cause it tests his masculine
virtues and brings him closer to
other men. You'd think that
Vietnam would have finished
off this homoerotic fantasy of
war, but — surprise! — Uncom
mon Valor is set in Vietnam, or
rather in Laos, where a retired
flier, Lt. Col. John Rhodes
(Gene Hackman), and a few
Vietnam vets revisit the scene
of their youth in 1978, bent on
rescuing Americans reported
missing in action (including
Rhodes' son) from a POW
compound.
Joe Gayton's script allows
Kotcheff to exercise his tal
ents for both violence and sen

timentality. The movie begins
with Rhodes and his wife
watching the return of the
troops in 1972 on TV; Rhodes
lies awake all night remember
ing his absent son, and he
determines to work for his
recovery until he receives proof
that the boy is no longer alive.
When a military pal
scrounges up an aerial photo
graph confirming the existence
of POWs in Laos, Rhodes
rounds up three of his son's
army buddies, two other vets
with air force training and a
young man whose father — we
learn in the film's most shame
lessly maudlin scene — was re
ported missing in action. (Since
none of the characters ever
refers to this fact again,
Gayton and Kotcheff's sole
purpose in including it must
have been to squeeze our emo
tions.) In a life-size reconstruc
tion of the Laotian compound,
financed by his best friend
(Robert Stack), the father of
another MIA, Rhodes trains
the group for a few weeks — or
rather he encourages them to
train each other by reviving
their knowledge of guerilla
warfare; then he flies them
overseas.

The movie really works you
over: You can't fail to respond
to a loving father's search for
his son (it's an archetypal dra
matic situation) or to the
plight of American boys wast
ing away as prisoners of war
for years after the war has of
ficially ended. But Uncommon
Valor exudes a poisonous odor
distilled from a mixture of love
of comrades, battle horror,
culled from the well known
stories of the hellish trials
American soldiers endured in
Vietnam, and soured
chauvinism.
In a speech to the men he has
assembled to carry out his
lunatic-heroic project, Rhodes
swears that America's shame
at losing the war provoked her
negligence toward the men who
had fought in it. The
filmmakers recycle the post
war trauma of The Best Years
of Our Lives (several scenes are
actually lifted from that film)
and filter it through the macho
admiration that creeps into
even some of the best writing
about Vietnam (like Michael

Herr's Dispatches), where it is,
however, strongly tempered by
the feelings of guilt and
futility that marked this par
ticular war. Uncommon Valor is
a cuckoo revisionist view of
Vietnam, in which the good guy
Yankees resurface and win.
All through the movie, I
wished that someone else had
been playing Rhodes. Not that
Gene Hackman is bad: lie gives
an intelligent, muted perfor
mance in the first half of the
movie. But the chief virtue of
his acting here is in what it
avoids, not what it achieves,
and if you find the film offen
sive (as I did), then Hackman's
acting is not a sufficient im
pediment to . your finding
Rhodes objectionable.
In the second hour I stopped
watching Hackman. because it
seemed to me that in this un
fair contest between the actor
and the material, the material
had to emerge victorious. Even
that phenomenal, tightly
wound scene-stealer, Fred
Ward, doesn't make much of
an impression a-s the claustro-

phobic Wilkes. The only per

lunatic-heroic project, Rhodes
swears that America's shame
at losing the war provoked her
negligence toward the men who
had fought in it. The
filmmakers recycle the post
war trauma of The Best Years
of Our Lives (several scenes are
actually lifted from that film)
and filter it through the macho
admiration that creeps into
even some of the best writing
about Vietnam (like Michael

Herr's Dispatches), where it is,
however, strongly tempered by
the feelings of guilt and
futility that marked this par
ticular war. Uncommon Valor is
a cuckoo revisionist view of
Vietnam, in which the good guy
Yankees resurface and win.
All through the movie, I
wished that someone else had
been playing Rhodes. Not that
Gene Hackman is bad: lie gives
an intelligent, muted perfor
mance in the first half of the
movie. But the chief virtue of
his acting here is in what it
avoids, not what it achieves,
and if you find the film offen
sive (as I did), then Hackman's
acting is not a sufficient im
pediment to . your finding
Rhodes objectionable.
In the second hour I stopped
watching Hackman. because it
seemed to me that in this un
fair contest between the actor
and the material, the material
had to emerge victorious. Even
that phenomenal, tightly
wound scene-stealer, Fred
Ward, doesn't make much of
an impression a-s the claustro-

phobic Wilkes. The only per
former in the movie who shows
any freshness is L.A. comic Tim
Thomerson, whose slightly
lopsided line readings evidence
(as they did in Take This Job
and Shove It) a running inner
monologue that keeps the
character sane.
The credits list John Milius
as co-producer, and Uncommon
Valor has a strong kinship to
the right-wing tables Milius
himself has concocted as
screenwriter and director (The
LTfe and Times of Judge Hoy
Bean. The Wind and the Lion.
etc.).' And it's the second
movie Ted Kotcheff Ikis made
about Vietnam veterans who
continue to fight the war after
they've returned home. (Two
years ago he directed First
Blood. in which Sylvester
Stallone used Green Beret tac
tics to combat a small-town
police force with an unreasona
ble bias against him. It
combined elements of both the
myths Sudden Impact and Un
common Valor buy into.) The
Milius-Kotcheff collaboration
turns this movie into a macho
wish fulfillment fantasy. Un
common Valor bemoans the
fact that we can't return to
the grand old days of the Viet
nam War, when the Yankee
fighting spirit soared and men
were really men.

Neither the superbly
crafted, provocative Under
Fire nor the draggy, vaguely
anti-establishment Silk wood
really conveys the mood of the
times; far more Americans
have gone to see Uncommon
Valor and Sudden Impact, which
are true Reagan era films.
They're so far right that you
may stare at them in disbelief,
or laugh at their naivete, and
possibly Sudden Impact, the
latest "Dirty Harry" Callahan
adventure, satisfies audiences
just because of its clunkiness
and predictability — it's like
watching the newest episode
of a TV cop series that basi
cally repeats itself every week.
In other words, it may be
foolish to take the popularity
of Sudden Impact as a serious
indication of the political ten
dencies of the American audi
ence. However, it's useful to
examine what moviegoers take
into their systems when they
swallow a picture like Sudden
Impact.
By 1984 — more than a
dozen years after Don Siegel
brought out the original Dirty
Harry — we are so familiar
with what Harry Callahan
(Clint Eastwood) stands for
that it has long since ceased to
have any emotional force. Har
ry is a one-man vigilante crew, a
dedicated hater of criminals
("scum," in Harry's jargon), a
modern cowboy of superhuman
skill and strength, and a
renegade because he can't
tolerate the effete milky
liberalism (or political brown
nosing or downright incom
petence) of his superiors in the
San Francisco Police Depart
ment. He pursues those who
break the law: Since the law
seems bent on impeding his
work by protecting the scum,
he serves a higher justice — the
divine justice of Harry Cal
lahan. whose steely gaze
penetrates the heart of the
scum.
The pattern of a Dirty Harry
movie permits the audience to
indulge vicariously in the sadis
tic pleasures of brutality, be
cause there's no sting to the
conscience in the end: Harry
may stomp on the law but the
movie sees to it that he's al
ways right. No one he maims or
tortures or kills ever turns out
to be innocent. In fact, the vil
lains are generally depicted as
such repulsive, squealing
lowlite that Harry's wasting
them practically constitutes
euthanasia as well as exter
mination.
Sudden Impact provides the
Dirty Harry package with a
new bow. The murderess Harry
is trying to track down in the
small town of San Paulo, Jen
nifer Spencer (Sondra Locke),
is exacting a gruesome revenge
on the punks who raped her and
her sister (who became
catatonic as a consequence of
the attack) years ago.
So this time around it's the
victims who are the scum, and
in a sense Jennifer is Harry's
double. She's not even his
darker self, really: the murders

she commits are no more cruel
or painful than some of the
"justice" he's meted out over
the years. And though I
thought Sondra Locke's syph
ilitic pre-Raphaelite looks
were bizarrely incongruous in
this movie, and I hated her per
lormance almost as much as
Eastwood's (they both act
with their faces — she narrows
hers into a vicious schoolgirl's
scowl while he exercises every
muscle in his; he must need a
mudpack at the end of a day's

shooting), I must confess I was
fascinated to find out how the
movie would dispose of her in
the end. Would it attempt to
claim Harry's moral superiority
over her and shift Harry's sym
pathies in order to justify his
turning her in? Would it
become a tragedy, with Harry
arresting her despite the
dictates of his vigilante con
science? Would it evade the
issue completely by using her
obviously precarious mental
state as an excuse for her incar

ce ration?
The conclusion that
Eastwood (who also functions
as director here) and
screenwriter Joseph Stimson
choose is actually consistent
with the point of view of the
picture; it doesn't compromise,
as all of the endings 1 have sug
gested would. But because it
takes Dirty Harrydom to an
extreme, it is also so prepos
terous that you wonder — for
a moment — if there isn't
some colossal joke going on, if

■
you haven't been watching a
parody all along. But one
glance at Clint Eastwood's
face convinces you that the
parody is unconscious.
Eastwood believes in this
borderline neo-fascist vision of
justice, and if the movie is fi
nally inoffensive, it's because
he's too fogheaded to be con
sidered any kind of thinker and
too clumsy to be considered
any sort of manipulator (unlike
Don Siegel, for example). No
one who is as pathetic as
Eastwood is at directing actors
— Sudden Impact contains the
most laughable collection of
supporting performances since
the heyday of Republic
Pictures — and no one who
could let his composer (Lalo
Schifrin) write theme music
that sounds like a rumba with
bubbles in it, could really con
stitute much of a threat.
Uncommon Valor is another
story: It's very well made (by
Ted Kotcheff), and effective
enough to be disturbing. Both
movies resuscitate insidious old
cliches. In Sudden Impact we
are told, once again, that small
towns create morally crippled
half-monsters who derive their
only pleasure from destroying
whatever innocence remains in
their midst. (This notion seems
a little odd in the chic cafes of
downtown Santa Cruz, where

the film was shot. Eastwood
should at least have moved his
crew to Mountain View.)
Uncommon Valor sells us the
antique philosophy — in Amer
ican drama, it dates as far back
as What Price Glory? — that
war is the noblest activity in
which man can participate be
cause it tests his masculine
virtues and brings him closer to
other men. You'd think that
Vietnam would have finished
off this homoerotic fantasy of
war, but — surprise! — Uncom
mon Valor is set in Vietnam, or
rather in Laos, where a retired
flier, Lt. Col. John Rhodes
(Gene Hackman), and a few
Vietnam vets revisit the scene
of their youth in 1978, bent on
rescuing Americans reported
missing in action (including
Rhodes' son) from a POW
compound.
Joe Gayton's script allows
Kotcheff to exercise his tal
ents for both violence and sen

timentality. The movie begins
with Rhodes and his wife
watching the return of the
troops in 1972 on TV; Rhodes
lies awake all night remember
ing his absent son, and he
determines to work for his
recovery until he receives proof
that the boy is no longer alive.
When a military pal
scrounges up an aerial photo
graph confirming the existence
of POWs in Laos, Rhodes
rounds up three of his son's
army buddies, two other vets
with air force training and a
young man whose father — we
learn in the film's most shame
lessly maudlin scene — was re
ported missing in action. (Since
none of the characters ever
refers to this fact again,
Gayton and Kotcheff's sole
purpose in including it must
have been to squeeze our emo
tions.) In a life-size reconstruc
tion of the Laotian compound,
financed by his best friend
(Robert Stack), the father of
another MIA, Rhodes trains
the group for a few weeks — or
rather he encourages them to
train each other by reviving
their knowledge of guerilla
warfare; then he flies them
overseas.

The movie really works you
over: You can't fail to respond
to a loving father's search for
his son (it's an archetypal dra
matic situation) or to the
plight of American boys wast
ing away as prisoners of war
for years after the war has of
ficially ended. But Uncommon
Valor exudes a poisonous odor
distilled from a mixture of love
of comrades, battle horror,
culled from the well known
stories of the hellish trials
American soldiers endured in
Vietnam, and soured
chauvinism.
In a speech to the men he has
assembled to carry out his
lunatic-heroic project, Rhodes
swears that America's shame
at losing the war provoked her
negligence toward the men who
had fought in it. The
filmmakers recycle the post
