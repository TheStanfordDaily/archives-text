# Olivier's brilliance dominates 'King Lear'
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
I The first time I saw
.a u re nee Olivier act, I was in
igh school. In order to get to
ee classic movies I'd only read
bout, I started a film club,
nd our first showing was
)livier's 194N Hamlet.
Ihakespearean scholars have
aked this llamlct over the
Dais on several occasions, corn
laming (with some justifica
(in) about the wholesale
Lilting of the text, the over-
Ireudianized interpretation
popular in its day — and
voice-over soliloquies, but
gpelen now, though I've seen at
ifast one Hamlet who made
tter sense (Derek Jacobi's),
iifs Olivier's line readings that
| rii g through my head whenever
Ilrcturn to the play. How, 1
| wondered at the time, could an
» actor create so complete a
in a phrase "except my
Be. except my life, except my
■e" to Polonius, or, dying in
I''Horatio's arms, "Oh ' could
tell you," which in Olivier's
I mouth became an elegy on the
jfiiemes of loss and self
discovery?
Iln the late 1960s and early
-*70s, while I was in college,
Olivier, already approaching an
advanced age and suffering
fiom impaired health, did a se
ries of impeccable cameos in
all-star extravaganzas like Oh!
What a Lovely War — the kind
of vignettes that gave these
long, boring pictures momen
tary life and stole them clean
away. He was the Lone Ranger
of those immense British epics,
masked by his elaborate make
up and his chameleon physical
and vocal skills, disappearing
before we could identify him
for certain.
. . Meanwhile I caught up on his
past triumphs at local revival
houses. As Heathcliff in
William Wyler's Winhering
Heights (1939), he had such a
commanding sexual presence
that he could silence a room
without raising his voice above
a whisper when he warned his
adversaries, the Lintons, that
he would return to tumble
their house to the ground. In
his own Henry V (1944) and
Peter Brook's The Beggar's
Opera (1953), lie exhibited an
v insouciant charm. He seemed in
\le\ilish alliance with the
in Richard 111 (1956),
And his line readings were so
supremely witty — his evil
Richard was so obviously more
brilliant than anyone around
him — that his homicidal as
icent to power perverted the
law of survival of
■the fittest.
Repeating his West End tri
lumph in The Entertainer (I960),
lie demonstrated that only a
truly great actor can make an
audience care about a very poor
one: As Archie Rice, he used
the mediocrity of a music hall
comic's talents as a prism
reflecting the complexity of
his personal tragedy.
For Othello (1965). whom he
played so daringly black that
some people called the film
racist, he transformed himself,
lowering his voice and altering
I Ins posture and gait. Far from
I being an insult to blacks.
I Olivier's Othello in fact tran-
I scended all racial cliches by

plunging straight to the heart
ot them: I his Othello was no
assimilated Italian Moor, but
an African prince. It was a per
formance ol such staggering
magnificence that, like Mic
helangelo's David, it shrank the
realm ol what art — and man
— cannot achieve.
What makes Olivier such a
continued inspiration to those
of us who love theater is — as
much as his stature — his
nobility. Even most great ac
tors would have retired under
the pressures of debilitating
illness, but Olivier only began
to slow down a couple of years
ago. (I le is 76.)
Through tiie '70s, he gave a se
ries of wonderful supporting
performances in movies like
Uncle Vanya, Marathon Man.
The Seven I'er Cent Solution and
Dracula, while saving his oc
casional tour de forces —
Shy lock or Doc in Come Hack,
Little Slieha — for the televi
sion cameras. And at 74, he
chose, rather than settling for
the usual fate of old actors
(the odd. non-strenuous com
eback role or a new career in
self-parody), to play King Lear
in a BBC production that fi
nally received an American
airing last Thursday evening.
(The show was originally sched
uled for the previous night, but
Ronald Reagan, perhaps out of
an inferior actor's jealousy,
elected to upstage him by
delivering his State of the
Union speech on Wednesday.)
Because of the moments he
has selected for attacking each
of the great Shakespearean
roles — at least, the ones he
has preserved on film or video
— Olivier always gives the im
pression that he has grown into
them. He did Henry V and
Hamlet while he was still young
enough to play romantic
heroes, Richard 111 as he ap
proached 50. Othello when he
had both the strength and the
maturity for this most physi
cally demanding of the tragic
protagonists, Shylock in his
60s. Very few actors actually
wait until their 70s to attempt
I.ear, because who besides

Olivier could bring it off so
late in life? And so, because it
is normally a part enacted by
strong middle-aged men, Lear
is customarily depicted as pow
erful, tyrannical, a dragon
whose wrath terrifies everyone
around him and whose vicious
curses rend the air and shrivel
their hearers.
But Shakespeare wrote a
play about willful, childish old
men (Lear and Gloucester)
whose far more potent
daughters and sons dominate
and trick and abuse them, who
are reduced to curses when ac
tion is no longer feasible. Con
fronted with a pair of
daughters who refuse to let
him have his way. Lear cries, "I
will do such things — / What
they are, yet I know not," and
Olivier takes that line as the
center of his performance. His
Lear is a feeble old man whose
tragedy is not the fall from
power but the descent into
madness which he struggles in
vain to stave off.
If Olivier's frailty places cer
tain constraints on the inter
pretation — notably in the
heath scene, which in any case
goes awry because the director,
Michael Elliott, practically
drowns out the verse with exci
tation music and sound effects
— the benefits far outweigh
the losses.
Suddenly the opening scene,
a terror to actors and direc
tors, becomes a human drama
rather than the weird, ritualis
tic fxliibition it usually ap
pears. This Lear's insistence on
having his daughters make
public declaration of their filial
affection is a special treat he's
prepared for himself, the way a
child demands to be told a
bedtime story he's heard a
hundred times. He crows merri
ly over the lavish manner in
which his second daughter,
Regan (Diana Rigg). outdoes
the first, Goneril (Dorothy
Tutin), and when it is the turn
of his best-loved Cordelia
(Anna Calder-Marshall) to
speak, he can barely contain his
anticipatory delight. That she,
in an ill-advised display of in

tegrity, refuses to Hatter like
her sisters, startles him. and he
puts his hand to his ear when he
says,•"Nothing will come of
nothing. Speak again" — he's
sure he misheard her.
Olivier's Lear doesn't ex
plode at Cordelia; he pouts and
punishes her for disappointing
him by claiming she is no
daughter of his — and then he
is too obstinate to revoke
words spoken in haste. Played
this way, the first scene of
King Lear draws us in emotion
ally as it has in few produc
tions: Lear no longer seems an
inscrutable monster whose be
havior is dictated by a grand
theatrical whim, but "a very
foolish fond old man" who
makes a childish error the im
plications of which he cannot
guess at.
It also tests the actress cast
as Cordelia severely — when
Lear's longing for the pleasure
of his daughters' protests of
love is so transparent, one may
well ask why she so stubbornly
holds out. As Anna Calder-
Marshall plays her, she is
Goneril and Regan inverted:
tough on the outside, tender
within. To Calder-Marshall's
credit, she allows Cordelia to
grow more comprehensible (and
more sympathetic) as the play
unfolds.
I couldn't fathom Lear's
fondness for Dorothy Tutin's
Goneril (though the actress has
a couple of strong scenes in the
final hour), but Diana Rigg. as
Regan, does some marvelous,
unexpected things with her
scenes with Olivier. This Regan
babies her father, and he loves
every minute, though we may
be disturbed by what we see —
by how carefully she controls
the situation, and by the un
mistakable sexual component
in the kind of controls she
wields. (As Rigg plays her,
Regan is a study in sexual
power and hypocrisy.)
Nowhere is Lear more blind
than in his trusting Regan:
When she becomes a stern nurse
maid, forbidding him a home
with his hundred knights, he
doesn't recognize her — he
doesn't understand that she
has just shown her hand for the
first time. Rigg reads her lines
to Olivier in a put-on sing-song
nursery voice; when she turns
on him ("I pray you, father,
being weak, seem so"), she
simply changes the music.
Olivier plays Lear's shifts in
mood, his contradictions, as
evidence either of an approach
ing second childhood or of a de
termination not to go mad — a
determination that requires all
his physical and emotional
strength, and then of course
gives way because lie can't sum
mon up all the strength he
needs. When Lear feels Goneril
and her servants are mistreat
ing him, he waffles at first,
fearful of learning that the
division of the kingdom and
rejection of Cordelia were
dreadful mistakes.
When he arrives at
Gloucester's castle, where
Regan and her husband
Cornwall are guests, and they
fail to meet him, he thinks up
excuses for them. Olivier iden
tifies Lear's desperate,
weakening grasp on his sanitv

by having him stumble to his
knees to plead, sobbing, "O, let
me not be mad. not mad, sweet
heaven!" And when he cannot
complete his curse on his
daughters and has to be led
away by his Fool (John Hurt),
Olivier's meticulously crafted
through line allows us to recog
nize exactly what has occurred:
An old man, over every effort
to hang on. has fallen into
madness.
The mad scene, in which Lear
decks himself with flowers and
recites doggerel with a curious,
interior punning sense to it.
clearly inspired Olivier to
search for a new style. I've
never seen anything like the
way he plays this scene; it's as
though he dug inside himself
and found a whole new actor.
This Lear's insanity is astonish
ingly serene (it isn't until he
wakes from it that he's "bound
upon a wheel of fire"): He has
cut the pain out of his mind
and holds it away from himself
to examine it. This is a very un
usual kind of emblematic act
ing. because though it has a
radically different texture
from the rest of his perfor
mance. you feel it came from
the same place — the soul of
the world's greatest actor in
his old age. Olivier could no
more have given this perfor
mance 20 years ago than Mic
helangelo could have carved
Moses at 40.
Uneven as Michael Elliott's
direction is. the production
surrounds Olivier with a once
in-a-lifetime cast: There are no

embarrassments in the acting,
though there are disappoint
ments. As Edmund, Robert
Lindsay could use a little more
flamboyance and humor — he
seems too resolute and single
minded, though he actually
manages to make Edmund's
llth-hour repentance work.
Much of the Fool's part has
been cut, but even when John
Hurt is speaking you tend to
tune him out and watch
Olivier. I'm not sure that is as
much a criticism of Hurt,
whose line readings are uner
ringly intelligent, as a comment
on the way the pluy operates —
if you've got a great Lear, the
Fool passes into the back
ground. (In Brook's grotesque
filmed Lear in 1971, Jack Mae-
Gowran's Fool furnished relief
for the audience from the
stolid, frozen Lear of Paul
Scofield.)
Diana Rigg fares best in her
scenes with Olivier: in other
moments she seems to be
playing a cocktail party hypo
crite better suited to a
modern-dress Moliere comedy.
David Threlfall, the
heartbreaking Smike of the
Royal Shakespeare's Nicholas
Nickleby, lends Edgar a sweet,
bumbling quality in the early
scenes, so that we can believe
what his villainous half
brother. Edmund, says of him:
"a brother noble, / Whose na
ture is so far from doing harms
/ That he suspects none." He
offers us an Edgar whose love
for his father, which he can ar
ticulate no more successfullv

than Cordelia can voice hers,
finds expression in theater —
in the roles of Tom o' Bedlam,
the peasant who cares for the
blinded Gloucester, the face
less knight who takes arms
against Edmund. This is a bril
liant metaphor for Edgar. I
think, but Threlfall's acting
contains too much mannerism;
it needs simplifying.
Olivier receives ablest sup
port from Colin Blakely's
earthy, humorous Kent and
Leo McKern's Gloucester.
McKern gives a near-great per
formance — he makes
Gloucester fatuous, dis
tracted. sensual, yet so poig
nant that even poor staging
and camerawork can't destroy
the emotional effect of the
blinding scene. McKern speaks
in blurry, almost drunken tones
that match up well with the
way Olivier pushes his con
sonants, as if he had to work
hard to make himself under
stood distinctly.
Olivier seems to have thrown
away technique this time — his
is a breathtakingly pure Lear.
In his final speech, over Cor
delia's lifeless body, he brings
us so close to [.ear's sorrow
that we can hardly bear to
watch. When we weep for the
fallen Lear, of course we are
weeping, too, because we have
seen the last Shakespearean
hero Laurence Olivier will ever
play. But what a finale! In this
most sublime of plays, our
greatest actor has given an in
delible performance. Perhaps it
would be most appropriate to
express simple gratitude.


Just before he dies, Lear imagines a breath upon Cordelia's
lips.


Howling, Lear laments the death of his loving youngest daughter, Cordelia.

I mouth became an elegy on the
jfiiemes of loss and self
discovery?
Iln the late 1960s and early
-*70s, while I was in college,
Olivier, already approaching an
advanced age and suffering
fiom impaired health, did a se
ries of impeccable cameos in
all-star extravaganzas like Oh!
What a Lovely War — the kind
of vignettes that gave these
long, boring pictures momen
tary life and stole them clean
away. He was the Lone Ranger
of those immense British epics,
masked by his elaborate make
up and his chameleon physical
and vocal skills, disappearing
before we could identify him
for certain.
. . Meanwhile I caught up on his
past triumphs at local revival
houses. As Heathcliff in
William Wyler's Winhering
Heights (1939), he had such a
commanding sexual presence
that he could silence a room
without raising his voice above
a whisper when he warned his
adversaries, the Lintons, that
he would return to tumble
their house to the ground. In
his own Henry V (1944) and
Peter Brook's The Beggar's
Opera (1953), lie exhibited an
v insouciant charm. He seemed in
\le\ilish alliance with the
in Richard 111 (1956),
And his line readings were so
supremely witty — his evil
Richard was so obviously more
brilliant than anyone around
him — that his homicidal as
icent to power perverted the
law of survival of
■the fittest.
Repeating his West End tri
lumph in The Entertainer (I960),
lie demonstrated that only a
truly great actor can make an
audience care about a very poor
one: As Archie Rice, he used
the mediocrity of a music hall
comic's talents as a prism
reflecting the complexity of
his personal tragedy.
For Othello (1965). whom he
played so daringly black that
some people called the film
racist, he transformed himself,
lowering his voice and altering
I Ins posture and gait. Far from
I being an insult to blacks.
I Olivier's Othello in fact tran-
I scended all racial cliches by

plunging straight to the heart
ot them: I his Othello was no
assimilated Italian Moor, but
an African prince. It was a per
formance ol such staggering
magnificence that, like Mic
helangelo's David, it shrank the
realm ol what art — and man
— cannot achieve.
What makes Olivier such a
continued inspiration to those
of us who love theater is — as
much as his stature — his
nobility. Even most great ac
tors would have retired under
the pressures of debilitating
illness, but Olivier only began
to slow down a couple of years
ago. (I le is 76.)
Through tiie '70s, he gave a se
ries of wonderful supporting
performances in movies like
Uncle Vanya, Marathon Man.
The Seven I'er Cent Solution and
Dracula, while saving his oc
casional tour de forces —
Shy lock or Doc in Come Hack,
Little Slieha — for the televi
sion cameras. And at 74, he
chose, rather than settling for
the usual fate of old actors
(the odd. non-strenuous com
eback role or a new career in
self-parody), to play King Lear
in a BBC production that fi
nally received an American
airing last Thursday evening.
(The show was originally sched
uled for the previous night, but
Ronald Reagan, perhaps out of
an inferior actor's jealousy,
elected to upstage him by
delivering his State of the
Union speech on Wednesday.)
Because of the moments he
has selected for attacking each
of the great Shakespearean
roles — at least, the ones he
has preserved on film or video
— Olivier always gives the im
pression that he has grown into
them. He did Henry V and
Hamlet while he was still young
enough to play romantic
heroes, Richard 111 as he ap
proached 50. Othello when he
had both the strength and the
maturity for this most physi
cally demanding of the tragic
protagonists, Shylock in his
60s. Very few actors actually
wait until their 70s to attempt
I.ear, because who besides

Olivier could bring it off so
late in life? And so, because it
is normally a part enacted by
strong middle-aged men, Lear
is customarily depicted as pow
erful, tyrannical, a dragon
whose wrath terrifies everyone
around him and whose vicious
curses rend the air and shrivel
their hearers.
But Shakespeare wrote a
play about willful, childish old
men (Lear and Gloucester)
whose far more potent
daughters and sons dominate
and trick and abuse them, who
are reduced to curses when ac
tion is no longer feasible. Con
fronted with a pair of
daughters who refuse to let
him have his way. Lear cries, "I
will do such things — / What
they are, yet I know not," and
Olivier takes that line as the
center of his performance. His
Lear is a feeble old man whose
tragedy is not the fall from
power but the descent into
madness which he struggles in
vain to stave off.
If Olivier's frailty places cer
tain constraints on the inter
pretation — notably in the
heath scene, which in any case
goes awry because the director,
Michael Elliott, practically
drowns out the verse with exci
tation music and sound effects
— the benefits far outweigh
the losses.
Suddenly the opening scene,
a terror to actors and direc
tors, becomes a human drama
rather than the weird, ritualis
tic fxliibition it usually ap
pears. This Lear's insistence on
having his daughters make
public declaration of their filial
affection is a special treat he's
prepared for himself, the way a
child demands to be told a
bedtime story he's heard a
hundred times. He crows merri
ly over the lavish manner in
which his second daughter,
Regan (Diana Rigg). outdoes
the first, Goneril (Dorothy
Tutin), and when it is the turn
of his best-loved Cordelia
(Anna Calder-Marshall) to
speak, he can barely contain his
anticipatory delight. That she,
in an ill-advised display of in

tegrity, refuses to Hatter like
her sisters, startles him. and he
puts his hand to his ear when he
says,•"Nothing will come of
nothing. Speak again" — he's
sure he misheard her.
Olivier's Lear doesn't ex
plode at Cordelia; he pouts and
punishes her for disappointing
him by claiming she is no
daughter of his — and then he
is too obstinate to revoke
words spoken in haste. Played
this way, the first scene of
King Lear draws us in emotion
ally as it has in few produc
tions: Lear no longer seems an
inscrutable monster whose be
havior is dictated by a grand
theatrical whim, but "a very
foolish fond old man" who
makes a childish error the im
plications of which he cannot
guess at.
It also tests the actress cast
as Cordelia severely — when
Lear's longing for the pleasure
of his daughters' protests of
love is so transparent, one may
well ask why she so stubbornly
holds out. As Anna Calder-
Marshall plays her, she is
Goneril and Regan inverted:
tough on the outside, tender
within. To Calder-Marshall's
credit, she allows Cordelia to
grow more comprehensible (and
more sympathetic) as the play
unfolds.
I couldn't fathom Lear's
fondness for Dorothy Tutin's
Goneril (though the actress has
a couple of strong scenes in the
final hour), but Diana Rigg. as
Regan, does some marvelous,
unexpected things with her
scenes with Olivier. This Regan
babies her father, and he loves
every minute, though we may
be disturbed by what we see —
by how carefully she controls
the situation, and by the un
mistakable sexual component
in the kind of controls she
wields. (As Rigg plays her,
Regan is a study in sexual
power and hypocrisy.)
Nowhere is Lear more blind
than in his trusting Regan:
When she becomes a stern nurse
maid, forbidding him a home
with his hundred knights, he
doesn't recognize her — he
doesn't understand that she
has just shown her hand for the
first time. Rigg reads her lines
to Olivier in a put-on sing-song
nursery voice; when she turns
on him ("I pray you, father,
being weak, seem so"), she
simply changes the music.
Olivier plays Lear's shifts in
mood, his contradictions, as
evidence either of an approach
ing second childhood or of a de
termination not to go mad — a
determination that requires all
his physical and emotional
strength, and then of course
gives way because lie can't sum
mon up all the strength he
needs. When Lear feels Goneril
and her servants are mistreat
ing him, he waffles at first,
fearful of learning that the
division of the kingdom and
rejection of Cordelia were
dreadful mistakes.
When he arrives at
Gloucester's castle, where
Regan and her husband
Cornwall are guests, and they
fail to meet him, he thinks up
excuses for them. Olivier iden
tifies Lear's desperate,
weakening grasp on his sanitv

by having him stumble to his
knees to plead, sobbing, "O, let
me not be mad. not mad, sweet
heaven!" And when he cannot
complete his curse on his
daughters and has to be led
away by his Fool (John Hurt),
Olivier's meticulously crafted
through line allows us to recog
nize exactly what has occurred:
An old man, over every effort
to hang on. has fallen into
madness.
The mad scene, in which Lear
decks himself with flowers and
recites doggerel with a curious,
interior punning sense to it.
clearly inspired Olivier to
search for a new style. I've
never seen anything like the
way he plays this scene; it's as
though he dug inside himself
and found a whole new actor.
This Lear's insanity is astonish
ingly serene (it isn't until he
wakes from it that he's "bound
upon a wheel of fire"): He has
cut the pain out of his mind
and holds it away from himself
to examine it. This is a very un
usual kind of emblematic act
ing. because though it has a
radically different texture
from the rest of his perfor
mance. you feel it came from
the same place — the soul of
the world's greatest actor in
his old age. Olivier could no
more have given this perfor
mance 20 years ago than Mic
helangelo could have carved
Moses at 40.
Uneven as Michael Elliott's
direction is. the production
surrounds Olivier with a once
in-a-lifetime cast: There are no

embarrassments in the acting,
though there are disappoint
ments. As Edmund, Robert
Lindsay could use a little more
flamboyance and humor — he
seems too resolute and single
minded, though he actually
manages to make Edmund's
llth-hour repentance work.
Much of the Fool's part has
been cut, but even when John
Hurt is speaking you tend to
tune him out and watch
Olivier. I'm not sure that is as
much a criticism of Hurt,
whose line readings are uner
ringly intelligent, as a comment
on the way the pluy operates —
if you've got a great Lear, the
Fool passes into the back
ground. (In Brook's grotesque
filmed Lear in 1971, Jack Mae-
Gowran's Fool furnished relief
for the audience from the
stolid, frozen Lear of Paul
Scofield.)
Diana Rigg fares best in her
scenes with Olivier: in other
moments she seems to be
playing a cocktail party hypo
crite better suited to a
modern-dress Moliere comedy.
David Threlfall, the
heartbreaking Smike of the
Royal Shakespeare's Nicholas
Nickleby, lends Edgar a sweet,
bumbling quality in the early
scenes, so that we can believe
what his villainous half
brother. Edmund, says of him:
"a brother noble, / Whose na
ture is so far from doing harms
/ That he suspects none." He
offers us an Edgar whose love
for his father, which he can ar
ticulate no more successfullv

than Cordelia can voice hers,
finds expression in theater —
in the roles of Tom o' Bedlam,
the peasant who cares for the
blinded Gloucester, the face
less knight who takes arms
against Edmund. This is a bril
liant metaphor for Edgar. I
think, but Threlfall's acting
contains too much mannerism;
it needs simplifying.
Olivier receives ablest sup
port from Colin Blakely's
earthy, humorous Kent and
Leo McKern's Gloucester.
McKern gives a near-great per
formance — he makes
Gloucester fatuous, dis
tracted. sensual, yet so poig
nant that even poor staging
and camerawork can't destroy
the emotional effect of the
blinding scene. McKern speaks
in blurry, almost drunken tones
that match up well with the
way Olivier pushes his con
sonants, as if he had to work
hard to make himself under
stood distinctly.
Olivier seems to have thrown
away technique this time — his
is a breathtakingly pure Lear.
In his final speech, over Cor
delia's lifeless body, he brings
us so close to [.ear's sorrow
that we can hardly bear to
watch. When we weep for the
fallen Lear, of course we are
weeping, too, because we have
seen the last Shakespearean
hero Laurence Olivier will ever
play. But what a finale! In this
most sublime of plays, our
greatest actor has given an in
delible performance. Perhaps it
would be most appropriate to
express simple gratitude.


Just before he dies, Lear imagines a breath upon Cordelia's
lips.


Howling, Lear laments the death of his loving youngest daughter, Cordelia.

Heights (1939), he had such a
commanding sexual presence
that he could silence a room
without raising his voice above
a whisper when he warned his
adversaries, the Lintons, that
he would return to tumble
their house to the ground. In
his own Henry V (1944) and
Peter Brook's The Beggar's

And his line readings were so

brilliant than anyone around
him — that his homicidal as

law of survival of
■the fittest.
Repeating his West End tri
lumph in The Entertainer (I960),
lie demonstrated that only a
truly great actor can make an
audience care about a very poor
one: As Archie Rice, he used
the mediocrity of a music hall
comic's talents as a prism
reflecting the complexity of
his personal tragedy.
For Othello (1965). whom he
played so daringly black that
some people called the film
racist, he transformed himself,
lowering his voice and altering
I Ins posture and gait. Far from
I being an insult to blacks.
I Olivier's Othello in fact tran-
I scended all racial cliches by

plunging straight to the heart
ot them: I his Othello was no
assimilated Italian Moor, but
an African prince. It was a per
formance ol such staggering
magnificence that, like Mic
helangelo's David, it shrank the
realm ol what art — and man
— cannot achieve.
What makes Olivier such a
continued inspiration to those
of us who love theater is — as
much as his stature — his
nobility. Even most great ac
tors would have retired under
the pressures of debilitating
illness, but Olivier only began
to slow down a couple of years
ago. (I le is 76.)
Through tiie '70s, he gave a se
ries of wonderful supporting
performances in movies like
Uncle Vanya, Marathon Man.
The Seven I'er Cent Solution and
Dracula, while saving his oc
casional tour de forces —
Shy lock or Doc in Come Hack,
Little Slieha — for the televi
sion cameras. And at 74, he
chose, rather than settling for
the usual fate of old actors
(the odd. non-strenuous com
eback role or a new career in
self-parody), to play King Lear
in a BBC production that fi
nally received an American
airing last Thursday evening.
(The show was originally sched
uled for the previous night, but
Ronald Reagan, perhaps out of
an inferior actor's jealousy,
elected to upstage him by
delivering his State of the
Union speech on Wednesday.)
Because of the moments he
has selected for attacking each
of the great Shakespearean
roles — at least, the ones he
has preserved on film or video
— Olivier always gives the im
pression that he has grown into
them. He did Henry V and
Hamlet while he was still young
enough to play romantic
heroes, Richard 111 as he ap
proached 50. Othello when he
had both the strength and the
maturity for this most physi
cally demanding of the tragic
protagonists, Shylock in his
60s. Very few actors actually
wait until their 70s to attempt
I.ear, because who besides

Olivier could bring it off so
late in life? And so, because it
is normally a part enacted by
strong middle-aged men, Lear
is customarily depicted as pow
erful, tyrannical, a dragon
whose wrath terrifies everyone
around him and whose vicious
curses rend the air and shrivel
their hearers.
But Shakespeare wrote a
play about willful, childish old
men (Lear and Gloucester)
whose far more potent
daughters and sons dominate
and trick and abuse them, who
are reduced to curses when ac
tion is no longer feasible. Con
fronted with a pair of
daughters who refuse to let
him have his way. Lear cries, "I
will do such things — / What
they are, yet I know not," and
Olivier takes that line as the
center of his performance. His
Lear is a feeble old man whose
tragedy is not the fall from
power but the descent into
madness which he struggles in
vain to stave off.
If Olivier's frailty places cer
tain constraints on the inter
pretation — notably in the
heath scene, which in any case
goes awry because the director,
Michael Elliott, practically
drowns out the verse with exci
tation music and sound effects
— the benefits far outweigh
the losses.
Suddenly the opening scene,
a terror to actors and direc
tors, becomes a human drama
rather than the weird, ritualis
tic fxliibition it usually ap
pears. This Lear's insistence on
having his daughters make
public declaration of their filial
affection is a special treat he's
prepared for himself, the way a
child demands to be told a
bedtime story he's heard a
hundred times. He crows merri
ly over the lavish manner in
which his second daughter,
Regan (Diana Rigg). outdoes
the first, Goneril (Dorothy
Tutin), and when it is the turn
of his best-loved Cordelia
(Anna Calder-Marshall) to
speak, he can barely contain his
anticipatory delight. That she,
in an ill-advised display of in

tegrity, refuses to Hatter like
her sisters, startles him. and he
puts his hand to his ear when he
says,•"Nothing will come of
nothing. Speak again" — he's
sure he misheard her.
Olivier's Lear doesn't ex
plode at Cordelia; he pouts and
punishes her for disappointing
him by claiming she is no
daughter of his — and then he
is too obstinate to revoke
words spoken in haste. Played
this way, the first scene of
King Lear draws us in emotion
ally as it has in few produc
tions: Lear no longer seems an
inscrutable monster whose be
havior is dictated by a grand
theatrical whim, but "a very
foolish fond old man" who
makes a childish error the im
plications of which he cannot
guess at.
It also tests the actress cast
as Cordelia severely — when
Lear's longing for the pleasure
of his daughters' protests of
love is so transparent, one may
well ask why she so stubbornly
holds out. As Anna Calder-
Marshall plays her, she is
Goneril and Regan inverted:
tough on the outside, tender
within. To Calder-Marshall's
credit, she allows Cordelia to
grow more comprehensible (and
more sympathetic) as the play
unfolds.
I couldn't fathom Lear's
fondness for Dorothy Tutin's
Goneril (though the actress has
a couple of strong scenes in the
final hour), but Diana Rigg. as
Regan, does some marvelous,
unexpected things with her
scenes with Olivier. This Regan
babies her father, and he loves
every minute, though we may
be disturbed by what we see —
by how carefully she controls
the situation, and by the un
mistakable sexual component
in the kind of controls she
wields. (As Rigg plays her,
Regan is a study in sexual
power and hypocrisy.)
Nowhere is Lear more blind
than in his trusting Regan:
When she becomes a stern nurse
maid, forbidding him a home
with his hundred knights, he
doesn't recognize her — he
doesn't understand that she
has just shown her hand for the
first time. Rigg reads her lines
to Olivier in a put-on sing-song
nursery voice; when she turns
on him ("I pray you, father,
being weak, seem so"), she
simply changes the music.
Olivier plays Lear's shifts in
mood, his contradictions, as
evidence either of an approach
ing second childhood or of a de
termination not to go mad — a
determination that requires all
his physical and emotional
strength, and then of course
gives way because lie can't sum
mon up all the strength he
needs. When Lear feels Goneril
and her servants are mistreat
ing him, he waffles at first,
fearful of learning that the
division of the kingdom and
rejection of Cordelia were
dreadful mistakes.
When he arrives at
Gloucester's castle, where
Regan and her husband
Cornwall are guests, and they
fail to meet him, he thinks up
excuses for them. Olivier iden
tifies Lear's desperate,
weakening grasp on his sanitv

by having him stumble to his
knees to plead, sobbing, "O, let
me not be mad. not mad, sweet
heaven!" And when he cannot
complete his curse on his
daughters and has to be led
away by his Fool (John Hurt),
Olivier's meticulously crafted
through line allows us to recog
nize exactly what has occurred:
An old man, over every effort
to hang on. has fallen into
madness.
The mad scene, in which Lear
decks himself with flowers and
recites doggerel with a curious,
interior punning sense to it.
clearly inspired Olivier to
search for a new style. I've
never seen anything like the
way he plays this scene; it's as
though he dug inside himself
and found a whole new actor.
This Lear's insanity is astonish
ingly serene (it isn't until he
wakes from it that he's "bound
upon a wheel of fire"): He has
cut the pain out of his mind
and holds it away from himself
to examine it. This is a very un
usual kind of emblematic act
ing. because though it has a
radically different texture
from the rest of his perfor
mance. you feel it came from
the same place — the soul of
the world's greatest actor in
his old age. Olivier could no
more have given this perfor
mance 20 years ago than Mic
helangelo could have carved
Moses at 40.
Uneven as Michael Elliott's
direction is. the production
surrounds Olivier with a once
in-a-lifetime cast: There are no

embarrassments in the acting,
though there are disappoint
ments. As Edmund, Robert
Lindsay could use a little more
flamboyance and humor — he
seems too resolute and single
minded, though he actually
manages to make Edmund's
llth-hour repentance work.
Much of the Fool's part has
been cut, but even when John
Hurt is speaking you tend to
tune him out and watch
Olivier. I'm not sure that is as
much a criticism of Hurt,
whose line readings are uner
ringly intelligent, as a comment
on the way the pluy operates —
if you've got a great Lear, the
Fool passes into the back
ground. (In Brook's grotesque
filmed Lear in 1971, Jack Mae-
Gowran's Fool furnished relief
for the audience from the
stolid, frozen Lear of Paul
Scofield.)
Diana Rigg fares best in her
scenes with Olivier: in other
moments she seems to be
playing a cocktail party hypo
crite better suited to a
modern-dress Moliere comedy.
David Threlfall, the
heartbreaking Smike of the
Royal Shakespeare's Nicholas
Nickleby, lends Edgar a sweet,
bumbling quality in the early
scenes, so that we can believe
what his villainous half
brother. Edmund, says of him:
"a brother noble, / Whose na
ture is so far from doing harms
/ That he suspects none." He
offers us an Edgar whose love
for his father, which he can ar
ticulate no more successfullv

than Cordelia can voice hers,
finds expression in theater —
in the roles of Tom o' Bedlam,
the peasant who cares for the
blinded Gloucester, the face
less knight who takes arms
against Edmund. This is a bril
liant metaphor for Edgar. I
think, but Threlfall's acting
contains too much mannerism;
it needs simplifying.
Olivier receives ablest sup
port from Colin Blakely's
earthy, humorous Kent and
Leo McKern's Gloucester.
McKern gives a near-great per
formance — he makes
Gloucester fatuous, dis
tracted. sensual, yet so poig
nant that even poor staging
and camerawork can't destroy
the emotional effect of the
blinding scene. McKern speaks
in blurry, almost drunken tones
that match up well with the
way Olivier pushes his con
sonants, as if he had to work
hard to make himself under
stood distinctly.
Olivier seems to have thrown
away technique this time — his
is a breathtakingly pure Lear.
In his final speech, over Cor
delia's lifeless body, he brings
us so close to [.ear's sorrow
that we can hardly bear to
watch. When we weep for the
fallen Lear, of course we are
weeping, too, because we have
seen the last Shakespearean
hero Laurence Olivier will ever
play. But what a finale! In this
most sublime of plays, our
greatest actor has given an in
delible performance. Perhaps it
would be most appropriate to
express simple gratitude.


Just before he dies, Lear imagines a breath upon Cordelia's
lips.


Howling, Lear laments the death of his loving youngest daughter, Cordelia.
I The first time I saw
.a u re nee Olivier act, I was in
igh school. In order to get to
ee classic movies I'd only read
bout, I started a film club,
nd our first showing was
)livier's 194N Hamlet.
Ihakespearean scholars have
aked this llamlct over the
Dais on several occasions, corn
laming (with some justifica
(in) about the wholesale
Lilting of the text, the over-
Ireudianized interpretation
popular in its day — and
voice-over soliloquies, but
gpelen now, though I've seen at
ifast one Hamlet who made
tter sense (Derek Jacobi's),
iifs Olivier's line readings that

in a phrase "except my
Be. except my life, except my
■e" to Polonius, or, dying in
I''Horatio's arms, "Oh ' could
tell you," which in Olivier's
I mouth became an elegy on the
jfiiemes of loss and self
discovery?
Iln the late 1960s and early
-*70s, while I was in college,
Olivier, already approaching an
advanced age and suffering
fiom impaired health, did a se
ries of impeccable cameos in
all-star extravaganzas like Oh!
What a Lovely War — the kind
of vignettes that gave these
long, boring pictures momen
tary life and stole them clean
away. He was the Lone Ranger
of those immense British epics,
masked by his elaborate make
up and his chameleon physical
and vocal skills, disappearing
before we could identify him
for certain.

comic's talents as a prism
reflecting the complexity of
his personal tragedy.
For Othello (1965). whom he
played so daringly black that
some people called the film
racist, he transformed himself,
lowering his voice and altering
I Ins posture and gait. Far from
I being an insult to blacks.
I Olivier's Othello in fact tran-
I scended all racial cliches by

plunging straight to the heart
ot them: I his Othello was no
assimilated Italian Moor, but
an African prince. It was a per
formance ol such staggering
magnificence that, like Mic
helangelo's David, it shrank the
realm ol what art — and man
— cannot achieve.
What makes Olivier such a
continued inspiration to those
of us who love theater is — as
much as his stature — his
nobility. Even most great ac
tors would have retired under
the pressures of debilitating
illness, but Olivier only began
to slow down a couple of years
ago. (I le is 76.)
Through tiie '70s, he gave a se
ries of wonderful supporting
performances in movies like
Uncle Vanya, Marathon Man.
The Seven I'er Cent Solution and
Dracula, while saving his oc
casional tour de forces —
Shy lock or Doc in Come Hack,
Little Slieha — for the televi
sion cameras. And at 74, he
chose, rather than settling for
the usual fate of old actors
(the odd. non-strenuous com
eback role or a new career in
self-parody), to play King Lear
in a BBC production that fi
nally received an American
airing last Thursday evening.
(The show was originally sched
uled for the previous night, but
Ronald Reagan, perhaps out of
an inferior actor's jealousy,
elected to upstage him by
delivering his State of the
Union speech on Wednesday.)
Because of the moments he
has selected for attacking each
of the great Shakespearean
roles — at least, the ones he
has preserved on film or video
— Olivier always gives the im
pression that he has grown into
them. He did Henry V and
Hamlet while he was still young
enough to play romantic
heroes, Richard 111 as he ap
proached 50. Othello when he
had both the strength and the
maturity for this most physi
cally demanding of the tragic
protagonists, Shylock in his
60s. Very few actors actually
wait until their 70s to attempt
I.ear, because who besides

Olivier could bring it off so
late in life? And so, because it
is normally a part enacted by
strong middle-aged men, Lear
is customarily depicted as pow
erful, tyrannical, a dragon
whose wrath terrifies everyone
around him and whose vicious
curses rend the air and shrivel
their hearers.
But Shakespeare wrote a
play about willful, childish old
men (Lear and Gloucester)
whose far more potent
daughters and sons dominate
and trick and abuse them, who
are reduced to curses when ac
tion is no longer feasible. Con
fronted with a pair of
daughters who refuse to let
him have his way. Lear cries, "I
will do such things — / What
they are, yet I know not," and
Olivier takes that line as the
center of his performance. His
Lear is a feeble old man whose
tragedy is not the fall from
power but the descent into
madness which he struggles in
vain to stave off.
If Olivier's frailty places cer
tain constraints on the inter
pretation — notably in the
heath scene, which in any case
goes awry because the director,
Michael Elliott, practically
drowns out the verse with exci
tation music and sound effects
— the benefits far outweigh
the losses.
Suddenly the opening scene,
a terror to actors and direc
tors, becomes a human drama
rather than the weird, ritualis
tic fxliibition it usually ap
pears. This Lear's insistence on
having his daughters make
public declaration of their filial
affection is a special treat he's
prepared for himself, the way a
child demands to be told a
bedtime story he's heard a
hundred times. He crows merri
ly over the lavish manner in
which his second daughter,
Regan (Diana Rigg). outdoes
the first, Goneril (Dorothy
Tutin), and when it is the turn
of his best-loved Cordelia
(Anna Calder-Marshall) to
speak, he can barely contain his
anticipatory delight. That she,
in an ill-advised display of in

tegrity, refuses to Hatter like
her sisters, startles him. and he
puts his hand to his ear when he
says,•"Nothing will come of
nothing. Speak again" — he's
sure he misheard her.
Olivier's Lear doesn't ex
plode at Cordelia; he pouts and
punishes her for disappointing
him by claiming she is no
daughter of his — and then he
is too obstinate to revoke
words spoken in haste. Played
this way, the first scene of
King Lear draws us in emotion
ally as it has in few produc
tions: Lear no longer seems an
inscrutable monster whose be
havior is dictated by a grand
theatrical whim, but "a very
foolish fond old man" who
makes a childish error the im
plications of which he cannot
guess at.
It also tests the actress cast
as Cordelia severely — when
Lear's longing for the pleasure
of his daughters' protests of
love is so transparent, one may
well ask why she so stubbornly
holds out. As Anna Calder-
Marshall plays her, she is
Goneril and Regan inverted:
tough on the outside, tender
within. To Calder-Marshall's
credit, she allows Cordelia to
grow more comprehensible (and
more sympathetic) as the play
unfolds.
I couldn't fathom Lear's
fondness for Dorothy Tutin's
Goneril (though the actress has
a couple of strong scenes in the
final hour), but Diana Rigg. as
Regan, does some marvelous,
unexpected things with her
scenes with Olivier. This Regan
babies her father, and he loves
every minute, though we may
be disturbed by what we see —
by how carefully she controls
the situation, and by the un
mistakable sexual component
in the kind of controls she
wields. (As Rigg plays her,
Regan is a study in sexual
power and hypocrisy.)
Nowhere is Lear more blind
than in his trusting Regan:
When she becomes a stern nurse
maid, forbidding him a home
with his hundred knights, he
doesn't recognize her — he
doesn't understand that she
has just shown her hand for the
first time. Rigg reads her lines
to Olivier in a put-on sing-song
nursery voice; when she turns
on him ("I pray you, father,
being weak, seem so"), she
simply changes the music.
Olivier plays Lear's shifts in
mood, his contradictions, as
evidence either of an approach
ing second childhood or of a de
termination not to go mad — a
determination that requires all
his physical and emotional
strength, and then of course
gives way because lie can't sum
mon up all the strength he
needs. When Lear feels Goneril
and her servants are mistreat
ing him, he waffles at first,
fearful of learning that the
division of the kingdom and
rejection of Cordelia were
dreadful mistakes.
When he arrives at
Gloucester's castle, where
Regan and her husband
Cornwall are guests, and they
fail to meet him, he thinks up
excuses for them. Olivier iden
tifies Lear's desperate,
weakening grasp on his sanitv

by having him stumble to his
knees to plead, sobbing, "O, let
me not be mad. not mad, sweet
heaven!" And when he cannot
complete his curse on his
daughters and has to be led
away by his Fool (John Hurt),
Olivier's meticulously crafted
through line allows us to recog
nize exactly what has occurred:
An old man, over every effort
to hang on. has fallen into
madness.
The mad scene, in which Lear
decks himself with flowers and
recites doggerel with a curious,
interior punning sense to it.
clearly inspired Olivier to
search for a new style. I've
never seen anything like the
way he plays this scene; it's as
though he dug inside himself
and found a whole new actor.
This Lear's insanity is astonish
ingly serene (it isn't until he
wakes from it that he's "bound
upon a wheel of fire"): He has
cut the pain out of his mind
and holds it away from himself
to examine it. This is a very un
usual kind of emblematic act
ing. because though it has a
radically different texture
from the rest of his perfor
mance. you feel it came from
the same place — the soul of
the world's greatest actor in
his old age. Olivier could no
more have given this perfor
mance 20 years ago than Mic
helangelo could have carved
Moses at 40.
Uneven as Michael Elliott's
direction is. the production
surrounds Olivier with a once
in-a-lifetime cast: There are no

embarrassments in the acting,
though there are disappoint
ments. As Edmund, Robert
Lindsay could use a little more
flamboyance and humor — he
seems too resolute and single
minded, though he actually
manages to make Edmund's
llth-hour repentance work.
Much of the Fool's part has
been cut, but even when John
Hurt is speaking you tend to
tune him out and watch
Olivier. I'm not sure that is as
much a criticism of Hurt,
whose line readings are uner
ringly intelligent, as a comment
on the way the pluy operates —
if you've got a great Lear, the
Fool passes into the back
ground. (In Brook's grotesque
filmed Lear in 1971, Jack Mae-
Gowran's Fool furnished relief
for the audience from the
stolid, frozen Lear of Paul
Scofield.)
Diana Rigg fares best in her
scenes with Olivier: in other
moments she seems to be
playing a cocktail party hypo
crite better suited to a
modern-dress Moliere comedy.
David Threlfall, the
heartbreaking Smike of the
Royal Shakespeare's Nicholas
Nickleby, lends Edgar a sweet,
bumbling quality in the early
scenes, so that we can believe
what his villainous half
brother. Edmund, says of him:
"a brother noble, / Whose na
ture is so far from doing harms
/ That he suspects none." He
offers us an Edgar whose love
for his father, which he can ar
ticulate no more successfullv

than Cordelia can voice hers,
finds expression in theater —
in the roles of Tom o' Bedlam,
the peasant who cares for the
blinded Gloucester, the face
less knight who takes arms
against Edmund. This is a bril
liant metaphor for Edgar. I
think, but Threlfall's acting
contains too much mannerism;
it needs simplifying.
Olivier receives ablest sup
port from Colin Blakely's
earthy, humorous Kent and
Leo McKern's Gloucester.
McKern gives a near-great per
formance — he makes
Gloucester fatuous, dis
tracted. sensual, yet so poig
nant that even poor staging
and camerawork can't destroy
the emotional effect of the
blinding scene. McKern speaks
in blurry, almost drunken tones
that match up well with the
way Olivier pushes his con
sonants, as if he had to work
hard to make himself under
stood distinctly.
Olivier seems to have thrown
away technique this time — his
is a breathtakingly pure Lear.
In his final speech, over Cor
delia's lifeless body, he brings
us so close to [.ear's sorrow
that we can hardly bear to
watch. When we weep for the
fallen Lear, of course we are
weeping, too, because we have
seen the last Shakespearean
hero Laurence Olivier will ever
play. But what a finale! In this
most sublime of plays, our
greatest actor has given an in
delible performance. Perhaps it
would be most appropriate to
express simple gratitude.


Just before he dies, Lear imagines a breath upon Cordelia's
lips.


Howling, Lear laments the death of his loving youngest daughter, Cordelia.
