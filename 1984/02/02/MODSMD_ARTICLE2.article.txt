# It's Sunken Diamond
## Council picks students' favorite for Commencement site 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
Following the recommendation of
the senior class presidents, the Ad
ministrative Council decided yester
day to hold Commencement in the
Sunken Diamond this year.
According to Dean of Students
James Lyons, the council had
originally favored the Stadium as the
replacement for Frost Amphithea
ter. But after urging from the senior
class presidents and examination of a
petition signed by 300 students, the
council unanimously supported the
Sunken Diamond.
"Holding Commencement in the
Sunken Diamond might be a little
more costly, but it seems within the
range of affordability, so we sup
ported the recommendation of the
seniors," Lyons said.
Senior class president Trish Conroy
said that it was significant that the
Administrative Council made the
decision "sheerly on what students
wanted.
"It's something we don't always
think will happen, but it did," she
said.
According to preliminary plans, a
6-foot stage will be constructed
near home plate. The faculty will be
seated in the bleachers behind the
stage and approximately 20,000
chairs will be set up on the field for
graduates and guests.
The added costs at the ball dia
mond will primarily be the additional
purchase or rental of chairs and the
reconstruction of the backdrop so
that it can be removed and replaced
every year.
"I think it will come off with the
pageantry and ceremony that we're
used to," Conroy said.'T have com
plete faith in Events and Services,
who will be planning the ceremony."
According to Lyons, the issue of
whether the Sunken Diamond will be
the permanent site for Commence
ment was not addressed.
"I hope we're not going to a

routine where we choose annually,"
he said, "but hopefully we'll learn
something this year and we may want
to make changes next year."
Events and Services officials will
be meeting this week to discuss the
details. Commencement coordinator
Nan Bentley said no final decision has
been made on the number of chairs
to set up or the number of tickets
that will be available to each stu
dent.

Senior class president Rick
Naimark said that each graduate will
probably receive four or five tickets.
"We want to eliminate the market
for tickets," he said, explaining that
space at the Sunken Diamond should
not be a problem.
Naimark said the next push by the
senior class presidents will be to get
Baccalaureate moved to Frost.
"That should be simple," he said,
"and at least partially appease those
people who wanted to graduate in
Frost."
Baccalaureate has recently been
held in the Quad in front of the

Memorial Church.
Lyons praised the senior class presi
dents' handling of the Commence
ment issue, saying the "work they did
really made a difference."
Though Conroy was pleased with
the decision, she said the senior class
presidents were "disappointed and
upset by the apathy shown by the
class."
After a disappointing 65-person

turnout at a meeting several weeks
ago, the presidents planned a second
meeting, hoping to get additional
student input. The second meeting
only attracted 35 students, though.
Naimark said he was pleased that
several students did feel strongly
enough to circulate a petition.
Conroy admitted she was the only
senior class president who strongly
preferred the Sunken Diamond to
the Stadium.
"However, we realized that our
personal opinions were not impor
tant," she said "We are basically rep
resentative."
