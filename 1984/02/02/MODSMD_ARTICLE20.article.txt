### 
Go ahead. Call it wishful
thinking.
After a promising 1 I-1
start, the Stanford basket
hall team is only 2-6 in the
Pacific-10 Conference and
people are still talking post
season tournament.
And. hell, for many of
teams across the country,
receiving an invitation to a
tournament is not only ex
pected. it's assumed. So
what's the big deal even if
Stanford does get one?
Stop right there.
When you haven't been to
a post-season party for 42
years and you have even the
most outside of outside
chances to go to one 42
years later, it is a big deal.
Excitement, wishful think
ing — whatever you want to
call it — is acceptable and

To turn fantasy into
reality, however, Coach

Tom Davis and his Cardinal
team will have to do one
thing and do it in abun
dance. Win.
But winning in the Pac-10
is easier said than done. Just
ask Davis or any of his
plavers about their 0-6
league start, a stretch in
which they lost the six
games by a total of 20
points. Sure, three of those
losses were to UCLA (once)
and Oregon State (twice).
But rationalize the "L's" to
Oregon, Cal and USC.
Thus, Stanford will
definitely have its work cut
out for it in its remaining 11
games —10 Pac-10 contests
and one non-conference tilt
against Santa Clara. Should
the Cardinal, presently 13-7
ovpnill po 6-5 nr 5-6 thp

rest of the way, the televi
sion will be the best way lor
it to view post-season play.
But if it wins, say, seven
or eight of the 11, then you
could be talking National
Ins itational Tournament
(NIT). Winning at least
seven of its remaining games
would gi\e Stanford a 20-
win season. Although 20 is
just one number higher than
19. having that "2" as the
first digit carries a whole lot
more weight than just one
more victory.
While the NCAA tourna
ment — that's where the
UCLAs and Oregon States
of the Pac-10 go —is out of
the question unless Stan
ford does something crazy
like win the rest of its
games, the NIT would find
it hard to turn down 20
wins, especially when it
routinely invites teams
from the Big 10 and ACC
(Atlantic Coast Confer
ence) with 15 or 16 vic
tories.
In trying to reach that
magical 20-win mark, there
are a few things Stanford
can and can't do.
First, the Card will prob
ably need another big upset
similar to last week's 78-74
triumph over league-leading
Washington. Two, and at
most three, games qualify as
upset material, the most
obvious candidate being the
Feb. IS match-up with na
tionally ranked UCLA at
Maples Pavilion. If the Card
doesn't win that game, it
would be forced to beat
either Washington in
Seattle or Oregon in Eugene
if it wants another big up
set this season.
One "no-no" for Stan
ford will be losing twice to
any of the Pac-10's bottom
five — Cal, USC, Arizona
State, Arizona and Wash
ington State. The Card has
already dropped its first
meetings with USC (away)
and Cal (at home), so the
Cal game next Friday and
the USC contest on Feb. 16
can both be considered
"must" wins.

Another thing Stanford
can't do in its remaining 1 1
games is get blown-out. So
far, the Card has not lost a
conference game by more
than five points and has not
won by more than four. A
blowout — especially to a
team in the aforementioned
"bottom five" — would
stick out like a skyscraper in
a cornfield on the Card's
record.
And of course, a season
ending injury to a starter or
often-used reserve would
spell disaster for Stanford,
a team which relies so heav
ily on players like Keith
Jones and .lohn Revelli.

Finally. Stanford is going
to need some help from its
friends in the Pac-10. I lie
NI T probablv will take, at
the very most, two teams
from the Pac-10. And
should Stanlord continue
its recently found winning
ways and finish, say. tilth in
the league, it still may not
be guaranteed a spot in the
NIT.
In such a situation. Stan
ford's chances would depend
on the numbei of teams the
NCAA invites to its post
season party So the best
situation the Card can hope
tor is that Washington.

Oregon State and UCLA
distance themselves from
the rest of the league and
assure themselves of NCAA
bids.
Then, assuming Oregon
finishes fourth in the con
ference and Stanford fifth,
both the Ducks and the
Card could \er\ possibly
receive NIT bids.
But there are two sides to
every coin. Stanford could
finish the season in top
form, win 20 games and still
go nowhere.
1 urning its nose up at 20
wins is nothing new to the
Nil. And Stanford doesn't

have to go far in distance or
in history to find such a vic
tim. Santa Clara, the closest
school to the Farm with a
Division I basketball pro
gram. went 21-7 last year
and finished second in the
WCAC (West Coast Ath
letic Conference) with a 9-3
league record. They watched
both tournaments on the
tube.
But Stanford has some
things going for it that a
team like Santa Clara
doesn't. While the Nil has
been considered by both
fans and its tournament se
lection committee as an
East Coast affair (only a

luindful dI schools west of
the Rockies were in the 32-
team draw last year). Stan
lord does have some names
that mean something to the
folks that think all Califor
nians live on the beach and
surf daily.
For starters. Tom Davis is
a household name in Boston
and surrounding areas. Davis
turned around a faltering
Boston College program in a
matter of years and brought
the Eagles to within a game
of the NCAA's Final Four
the season before lie made
the cross-country trek to
the Farm.
Stanford Athletic Direc
tor Andv Geiger is also well
known in the East. Geiger
was the AD at Brown Uni
versity and then at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania
before he came to Stanford.
He has been on the NCAA's
basketball tournament se
lection committee in recent
years and is well thought of
by both Eastern athletic
directors and tournament
selection committee types.
From a players stand
point. Stanford's senior
center John Revelli — who
is on track to become the
Card's all-time leading
scorer — hails from
Searsdale. N.Y. The NITs
version of the Final Four an
nually is held in New York
City's Madison Square Gar
den. so it is safe to say that
the Ni l is a New York
based affair.
However, none of these
East Coast connections will
mean a thing unless Stan
ford wins at least seven of
its last 1 I games. And with
the Pac-10 as equal as it's
ever been, seven or eight
wins might be too much to
ask from a team in only its
second year under Dr. Tom.
"I think it is way too early
to even think about the
Ni l." Davis says. " Right
now, we need our third win
in the Pac-10."
Indeed, all the tourna
ment talk is premature. But
just having a chance is what
counts for now.

For starters. Tom Davis is
a household name in Boston
and surrounding areas. Davis
turned around a faltering
Boston College program in a
matter of years and brought
the Eagles to within a game
of the NCAA's Final Four
the season before lie made
the cross-country trek to
the Farm.
Stanford Athletic Direc

was the AD at Brown Uni

He has been on the NCAA's

However, none of these

mean a thing unless Stan

the Pac-10 as equal as it's
ever been, seven or eight
wins might be too much to
ask from a team in only its

"I think it is way too early
to even think about the

Indeed, all the tourna

just having a chance is what

Go ahead. Call it wishful

After a promising 1 I-1
start, the Stanford basket

Pacific-10 Conference and
people are still talking post
season tournament.
And. hell, for many of
teams across the country,
receiving an invitation to a
tournament is not only ex

what's the big deal even if
Stanford does get one?
Stop right there.
When you haven't been to
a post-season party for 42
years and you have even the
most outside of outside
chances to go to one 42

Excitement, wishful think

To turn fantasy into
reality, however, Coach

Tom Davis and his Cardinal
team will have to do one
thing and do it in abun
dance. Win.
But winning in the Pac-10
is easier said than done. Just
ask Davis or any of his
plavers about their 0-6
league start, a stretch in
which they lost the six
games by a total of 20
points. Sure, three of those
losses were to UCLA (once)
and Oregon State (twice).
But rationalize the "L's" to
Oregon, Cal and USC.
Thus, Stanford will
definitely have its work cut
out for it in its remaining 11
games —10 Pac-10 contests
and one non-conference tilt
against Santa Clara. Should
the Cardinal, presently 13-7
ovpnill po 6-5 nr 5-6 thp

rest of the way, the televi
sion will be the best way lor
it to view post-season play.
But if it wins, say, seven
or eight of the 11, then you
could be talking National
Ins itational Tournament
(NIT). Winning at least
seven of its remaining games
would gi\e Stanford a 20-
win season. Although 20 is
just one number higher than
19. having that "2" as the
first digit carries a whole lot
more weight than just one
more victory.
While the NCAA tourna
ment — that's where the
UCLAs and Oregon States
of the Pac-10 go —is out of
the question unless Stan
ford does something crazy
like win the rest of its
games, the NIT would find
it hard to turn down 20
wins, especially when it
routinely invites teams
from the Big 10 and ACC
(Atlantic Coast Confer
ence) with 15 or 16 vic
tories.
In trying to reach that
magical 20-win mark, there
are a few things Stanford
can and can't do.
First, the Card will prob
ably need another big upset
similar to last week's 78-74
triumph over league-leading
Washington. Two, and at
most three, games qualify as
upset material, the most
obvious candidate being the
Feb. IS match-up with na
tionally ranked UCLA at
Maples Pavilion. If the Card
doesn't win that game, it
would be forced to beat
either Washington in
Seattle or Oregon in Eugene
if it wants another big up
set this season.
One "no-no" for Stan
ford will be losing twice to
any of the Pac-10's bottom
five — Cal, USC, Arizona
State, Arizona and Wash
ington State. The Card has
already dropped its first
meetings with USC (away)
and Cal (at home), so the
Cal game next Friday and
the USC contest on Feb. 16
can both be considered
"must" wins.

Another thing Stanford
can't do in its remaining 1 1
games is get blown-out. So
far, the Card has not lost a
conference game by more
than five points and has not
won by more than four. A
blowout — especially to a
team in the aforementioned
"bottom five" — would
stick out like a skyscraper in
a cornfield on the Card's
record.
And of course, a season
ending injury to a starter or
often-used reserve would
spell disaster for Stanford,
a team which relies so heav
ily on players like Keith
Jones and .lohn Revelli.

Finally. Stanford is going
to need some help from its
friends in the Pac-10. I lie
NI T probablv will take, at
the very most, two teams
from the Pac-10. And
should Stanlord continue
its recently found winning
ways and finish, say. tilth in
the league, it still may not
be guaranteed a spot in the
NIT.
In such a situation. Stan
ford's chances would depend
on the numbei of teams the
NCAA invites to its post
season party So the best
situation the Card can hope
tor is that Washington.

Oregon State and UCLA
distance themselves from
the rest of the league and
assure themselves of NCAA
bids.
Then, assuming Oregon
finishes fourth in the con
ference and Stanford fifth,
both the Ducks and the
Card could \er\ possibly
receive NIT bids.
But there are two sides to
every coin. Stanford could
finish the season in top
form, win 20 games and still
go nowhere.
1 urning its nose up at 20
wins is nothing new to the
Nil. And Stanford doesn't

have to go far in distance or
in history to find such a vic
tim. Santa Clara, the closest
school to the Farm with a
Division I basketball pro
gram. went 21-7 last year
and finished second in the
WCAC (West Coast Ath
letic Conference) with a 9-3
league record. They watched
both tournaments on the
tube.
But Stanford has some
things going for it that a
team like Santa Clara
doesn't. While the Nil has
been considered by both
fans and its tournament se
lection committee as an
East Coast affair (only a

luindful dI schools west of
the Rockies were in the 32-
team draw last year). Stan
lord does have some names
that mean something to the
folks that think all Califor
nians live on the beach and
surf daily.
