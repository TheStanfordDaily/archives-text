# Card must continue to rise in Phoenix
## 
### ADAM BERNS senior sportswriter 
Now that the Stanford bas
•tball team has finally got
e ball bouncing, it is going to
ive to start shooting in a dif
rent eourt.
Coming off Pacific-10 Con
rence victories at home over
ashington and Washington
ate last week following six
insecutive conference losses,
e Cardinal travels to Arizona
ate tonight and Arizona on
iturday.
Winning on the road has not
ime easy for Stanford. In the
ur years prior to the 19K3-N4
ason, the Cardinal has won
st six games on the road. This
far Stanford has three road I
ctories, but all came in
awaii against non-conference
|es.
Stanford is now 13-7, 2-6 in
e conference and is again
aiting to generate talk about
c National Invitational
purnament (NIT) chances,
ut Stanford Coach Tom
avis thinks that it is too early
i even consider post-season
pssibilities.
"I think it is too early to
link about it,"he said. "We
jed our third win in the Pac-
El) and we need to win some
imes on the road. We will try
i find out whether we're up
i it,"he said.
h While the Arizona trip is im
portant to any post-season
IttHirnament hopes, Davis em
phasized that it should be kept
in perspective. "We have 11
■times left, seven of them on
tie road," he said. "While
Beating the Arizona schools is
important, we could say that
about any trip."
I Like Stanford, Arizona
/•Suite is a young team, having
lost 75 percent of last year's
foitense. ASU's top scorer last
Season, guard Byron Scott
[21.6 points per game), gave up

his final year of eligibility to
enter the NBA, while forwards
Paul Williams (19.0 ppg) and
Walt Stone (9.1 ppg) were lost
to graduation.
The Sun Devils are 7-10
overall. 2-5 in the Pac-10, and
have lost four straight confer
ence game, three of them on
the road.
"These games are going to be
evenly matched," Davis said
about his upcoming games with
the two Arizona schools. "It
may well come down to foul
trouble, rebounding, or the
pressure defense."
The Sun Devil's top return
ing offensive threat is senior
guard Chris Beasley. who
averaged N. 4 points per game
last season. With the gradua
tion of Scott, Beasley has
taken up the offensive slack,
averaging 17.4 points per game
along with 3.7 rebounds a con
test. Although he has been in a
shooting slump lately, going
just 5-of-23 against Oregon
Saturday, Davis feels that he is
the guy to watch out for. "You
can't let Beasley loose on the
baseline for a jump shot." he
said.
The Stanford victories over
Washington and Washington
State were particularly impor
tant as the Cardinal plays its
next four straight games on
the road. Davis feels that his
team's free throw shooting and
rebounding in the last two
games has been responsible for
the resurgence.
"I don't know how you can
ask these kids to rebound any
better," Davis said. "Of course
(John) Revelli is up there, and
(Earl) Koberlein. But beyond
them, everyone is getting
rebounds: (Keith) Jones,
(Steve) Brown, . . . and (Hans)
Wichary looks like he is start
ing to return to his old form
following his injury.
"We have also begun to start

shooting free throws better.
We were poor by our stardards
but we were still in the top
three or four in the Pac-10. In
the last few games, we have
been shooting much better and
that's something I've always
felt we should be able to do."
Stanford went 32-of-39
from the line aginst Washing
ton for a .S2l percentage and
then followed with a 26-of-29
effort against Washington
State. Most impressive at the
line was Rev el Ii who had been
having problems earlier in the
season. Revelli has made his
last 15 consecutive attempts,
including a 10-for-10 effort
against the Huskies.
Card notes

games against Santa Clara and
UC-Berkeley are presently on

Senior forward Hans Wichary is almost back to full health
now after an early-season ankle injury. His health and
rebounding will be two crucial factors if Stanford wants to
continue its winning ways.

Senior forward Hans Wichary is almost back to full health
now after an early-season ankle injury. His health and
rebounding will be two crucial factors if Stanford wants to
continue its winning ways.
Now that the Stanford bas
•tball team has finally got
e ball bouncing, it is going to
ive to start shooting in a dif
rent eourt.
Coming off Pacific-10 Con
rence victories at home over
ashington and Washington
ate last week following six
insecutive conference losses,
e Cardinal travels to Arizona
ate tonight and Arizona on
iturday.
Winning on the road has not
ime easy for Stanford. In the
ur years prior to the 19K3-N4
ason, the Cardinal has won
st six games on the road. This
far Stanford has three road I
ctories, but all came in
awaii against non-conference
|es.
Stanford is now 13-7, 2-6 in
e conference and is again
aiting to generate talk about
c National Invitational
purnament (NIT) chances,
ut Stanford Coach Tom
avis thinks that it is too early
i even consider post-season
pssibilities.
"I think it is too early to
link about it,"he said. "We
jed our third win in the Pac-
El) and we need to win some
imes on the road. We will try
i find out whether we're up
i it,"he said.
h While the Arizona trip is im
portant to any post-season
IttHirnament hopes, Davis em
phasized that it should be kept
in perspective. "We have 11
■times left, seven of them on
tie road," he said. "While
Beating the Arizona schools is
important, we could say that
about any trip."
I Like Stanford, Arizona
/•Suite is a young team, having
lost 75 percent of last year's
foitense. ASU's top scorer last
Season, guard Byron Scott
[21.6 points per game), gave up

his final year of eligibility to
enter the NBA, while forwards
Paul Williams (19.0 ppg) and
Walt Stone (9.1 ppg) were lost
to graduation.
The Sun Devils are 7-10
overall. 2-5 in the Pac-10, and
have lost four straight confer
ence game, three of them on
the road.
"These games are going to be
evenly matched," Davis said
about his upcoming games with
the two Arizona schools. "It
may well come down to foul
trouble, rebounding, or the
pressure defense."
The Sun Devil's top return
ing offensive threat is senior
guard Chris Beasley. who
averaged N. 4 points per game
last season. With the gradua
tion of Scott, Beasley has
taken up the offensive slack,
averaging 17.4 points per game
along with 3.7 rebounds a con
test. Although he has been in a
shooting slump lately, going
just 5-of-23 against Oregon
Saturday, Davis feels that he is
the guy to watch out for. "You
can't let Beasley loose on the
baseline for a jump shot." he
said.
The Stanford victories over
Washington and Washington
State were particularly impor
tant as the Cardinal plays its
next four straight games on
the road. Davis feels that his
team's free throw shooting and
rebounding in the last two
games has been responsible for
the resurgence.
"I don't know how you can
ask these kids to rebound any
better," Davis said. "Of course
(John) Revelli is up there, and
(Earl) Koberlein. But beyond
them, everyone is getting
rebounds: (Keith) Jones,
(Steve) Brown, . . . and (Hans)
Wichary looks like he is start
ing to return to his old form
following his injury.
"We have also begun to start

shooting free throws better.
We were poor by our stardards
but we were still in the top
three or four in the Pac-10. In
the last few games, we have
been shooting much better and
that's something I've always
felt we should be able to do."
Stanford went 32-of-39
from the line aginst Washing
ton for a .S2l percentage and
then followed with a 26-of-29
effort against Washington
State. Most impressive at the
line was Rev el Ii who had been
having problems earlier in the
season. Revelli has made his
last 15 consecutive attempts,
including a 10-for-10 effort
against the Huskies.
