# Gays blame booklet for donor drop

### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Representatives of the gay
community here say "responsible"
action on the part of homosexual
blood donors — and not a fear of
contracting AIDS on the part of
other donors — is responsible for
a drop in donations at the Stan
ford Medical School Blood Dona
tion Center.
According to administrators at
the center, the drop in blood
donations here and in blood banks
across the country has been linked
to paranoia about Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome:
Potential donors fear they could
contract the disease while giving
blood.
But while spokesmen for Stan
ford's gay community agree that
there is a connection between
AIDS and the donor drop, they

point to the more direct cause for
the decline.
Gerard Koskovich. a graduate
student in Art History and a
member of the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance Steering Committee, said
that the Red Cross has asked po
tential AIDS carriers to stop
donating blood, and gays are com
plying with that request.
A leaflet published in May IMS 3
bv the Red Cross and distributed
to potential donors describes
those with "an increased risk of
developing AIDS" as belonging to
five "risk groups": Haitians,
homosexuals, abusers of in
travenous drugs, persons with
symptoms of AIDS and sex
partners of potential AIDS carri
ers.
Under a section headed "What
should I do?" the leaflet suggests
that potential blood donors in one

of the risk groups either "leave
without providing an explana
tion" or be deferred by a health
history interviewer.
Koskovich said that the gay
community "didn't like being clas
sified as a medical pariah." but
that nevertheless gays understood
the situation.
"We recognize that since there
is no way to screen potential carri
ers of AIDS, it was not an unrea
sonable request." he said.
As a result of the pamphlet,
Koskovich said, gays have stopped
donating blood. He said that he
wishes the heterosexual communi
ty would recognize the gay com
munity's efforts to alleviate the
problem.
"The gay community is respond
ing in a responsible way and not
gettng credit for it,"he ex
plained.
