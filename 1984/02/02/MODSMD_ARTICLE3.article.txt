# Stanford requests clearer library stand
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
University officials, saying they
remain confused about a recent
White House statement on the
Ronald Reagan presidential library
complex, have asked for clarification
on whether the Reagan library has
indeed been "decoupled" from a con
troversial public affairs center.
The request, made in a letter sent
last week from Board of Trustees
President William Kimball to
Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese,
may mean that action by the Board
will have to be postponed until after
its Feb. 14 meeting.
"I'm not going to ask the Board to
do anything nor do anything myselt
until we get clarification trom Mr.
Meese," University President Donald
Kennedy told The Daily yesterday.
In a lengthy interview with the
Stanford News Service, Kennedy
said, "I don't believe we can begin to
invest significant amounts ot in
stitutional time in planning tor the
library until we're absolutely certain
that uncoupling trom the center is
complete."
"We want to be very sure that the
president wishes to go forward with
the library plan without any refer
ence to the outcome ot Board delib
eration 011 any proposal tor a center
for public affairs," he said.
The University has long said that a
Reagan library, which would include

museum space, would be desirable,
and in a unanimous vote in December
invited the president to house his
papers here.
Disagreement between the two
sides has come only over the issue of
a public affairs center, which the
White House until last month said
should be run by the semi
autonomous Hoover Institution and
the University said should come un
der normal academic governance. The
White House also insisted that a
public affairs center be part of any
presidential complex, while the Uni
versity repeatedly asked that the
White House allow the library and
center to be decoupled and consid
ered on their individual merits.
In a letter to Kimball last month,
however, Meese offered a compro
mise proposal for governance of the
center, and also appeared to indicate
that the White House no longer con
sidered the library and the center in
extricably tied.
"We are very pleased that the
Ronald Reagan presidential library
and museuem will be located on the
Stanford campus, and we accept the
offer of the Board of Trustees in
this regard," the letter said. It went
on to urge the Board to consider and
accept the compromise proposal,
which is for a national policy center
to be built on land leased from Stan
