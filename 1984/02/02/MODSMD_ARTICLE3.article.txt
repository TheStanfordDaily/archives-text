# Stanford requests clearer library stand
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
University officials, saying they
remain confused about a recent
White House statement on the
Ronald Reagan presidential library
complex, have asked for clarification
on whether the Reagan library has
indeed been "decoupled" from a con
troversial public affairs center.
The request, made in a letter sent
last week from Board of Trustees
President William Kimball to
Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese,
may mean that action by the Board
will have to be postponed until after
its Feb. 14 meeting.
"I'm not going to ask the Board to
do anything nor do anything myselt
until we get clarification trom Mr.
Meese," University President Donald
Kennedy told The Daily yesterday.
In a lengthy interview with the
Stanford News Service, Kennedy
said, "I don't believe we can begin to
invest significant amounts ot in
stitutional time in planning tor the
library until we're absolutely certain
that uncoupling trom the center is
complete."
"We want to be very sure that the
president wishes to go forward with
the library plan without any refer
ence to the outcome ot Board delib
eration 011 any proposal tor a center
for public affairs," he said.
The University has long said that a
Reagan library, which would include

museum space, would be desirable,
and in a unanimous vote in December
invited the president to house his
papers here.
Disagreement between the two
sides has come only over the issue of
a public affairs center, which the
White House until last month said
should be run by the semi
autonomous Hoover Institution and
the University said should come un
der normal academic governance. The
White House also insisted that a
public affairs center be part of any
presidential complex, while the Uni
versity repeatedly asked that the
White House allow the library and
center to be decoupled and consid
ered on their individual merits.
In a letter to Kimball last month,
however, Meese offered a compro
mise proposal for governance of the
center, and also appeared to indicate
that the White House no longer con
sidered the library and the center in
extricably tied.
"We are very pleased that the
Ronald Reagan presidential library
and museuem will be located on the
Stanford campus, and we accept the
offer of the Board of Trustees in
this regard," the letter said. It went
on to urge the Board to consider and
accept the compromise proposal,
which is for a national policy center
to be built on land leased from Stan

ford and funded and governed by a
private Reagan foundation.
Although Meese never said specifi
cally that the library would come
here even if the Board turned down
the proposal for the national center,
officials at the Hoover Institution
who are close to White House
were adamant in saying that that was
what he meant.
But "several points in the letter
left us confused," Kennedy said in
the interview, which he gave rather
than make the Kimball letter public.
"First of all, in his letter he speci
fied that the Hoover Institution

would be in charge' of the library and
museum. Our understanding is that
the library, with its included museum
space, will be administratively di
rected by the national archivist and
not by any part of Stanford.
"But we do assume, of course, that
the library can be affiliated with the
Hoover Institution archives by name,
coordination of catalogs, or other
ways permitted by law. If that's all
'in charge' means, that's fine."
The most important point needing
clarification, he said, was whether or
not the White House would go for
ward with the library independent of
the Board's decision on the public af
fairs center.
"Bill Kimball and 1 were particu
larly anxious to emphasize to Mr.
Meese that although the Board has

not taken a formal position on the
compromise suggested by the White
House — namely, that there would
be some entity run by an indepen
dent foundation — the (University)
administration's position and the
president of the board's position is
that that kind of arrangement would
not be satisfactory," he said. k v
"We wanted to emphasize to Mr.
Meese that this doesn't have any
thing to do with 'internal political
problems' at Stanford — a phrase he
used — but that it emerges instead
from a very fundamental principle of
academic governance to which we are
thoroughly dedicated at Stanford."
Kennedy said members of ffoe
Board Committee on the Hoover.fn
stitution, who met Tuesday, had also
indicated opposition to the idea of a

national center. But he said he had
also heard from trustees who were
supportive of the idea.
"Everyone should bear in mind
that what we have gotten here is an
agreement in principle only," assum
ing the library and museum are
decoupled, Kennedy said.
"If decoupling is confirmed, we'll
start the process," he said. The
process would include consultation
with the White House about mecha
nisms for the University's oversight
of fund raising, consideration of sites
and review by city and county auth
orities before any construction
commences.
While discussions continue, the
Committee is beginning its task of
investigating the relationship be

tween the University and the Hoover
Institution, Kennedy said. Members
met yesterday with Chancellor and
former University President Wallace

Sterling, and plan to meet in the near
future with former University Presi
dent Richard Lvman and Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell, he said.
