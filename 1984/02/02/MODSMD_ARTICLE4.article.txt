## 
### CAMERON KALLER 
The University is making plans to close its
Commissary and allow each of the food services
on campus to arrange for the delivery of hulk
food in outside vendors, according to William
Massy, \ ice president for business and finance.
According to Massy, "the Commissary will
definitely he closing its doors for good unless
we're greatly surprised by the outside vendor
quotes we receive."
Complete closeout of the Commissary is ex
pected In Aug. 31 at the latest. As a self
sustaining operation, it receives no general funds
from the University and had lost a total of
$135,728 In August 1983.
Hie Commissary has mainly served as a large
distributor that brings in. re-sorts, packages and
delivers a wide range of bulk foods to most of
the large dormitories, independent houses, eating
clubs and various snack bars on campus
Maxine Anderson, manager of University Food
Service, said the closeout will not directly affect
students' food service or quality of food.

"I don't think the students will ever know the
difference," Anderson said.
Massy added that he. too, doesn't foresee any
big changes in the food, but that the move does
"open up the possibility for greater diversity,
which is a good thing."
Food managers of the various dorms and
houses on campus will notice the difference,
however: they will have to make new arrange
ments to procure delivery of their bulk food
needs.
However, the managers might be able to elimi
nate some of the problems with which they ve
been plagued in dealing with the Commissary,
such as frequent reduction in the effectiveness
or timeliness of the buying process, since outside
dealers won't be under budget limits.
"It really won't be any different," emphasized
Paul Chaltry. house cook for the Phi Delta Theta
Fraternity. "I can buy from outside groups just
as easily."
Nina Gee. the food manager of East House,
said that she, too. "will be able to buy trom
outside groups just as conveniently and actually

save a lot of money doing so."
In a preliminary study last fall quarter. Univer
sity Food Service found that it would be more
economical to deal with outside vendors because
"the average markup in the food distribution in
dustry is lower than the markup the Commissary
has to charge to break even," said Jack Albrecht.
associate director of facilities and services.
According to Massy, Anderson and Albrecht,
the food distribution industry has dramatically
improved in the last 10 years, which has left the
Commissary at a competitive disadvantage.
The Commissary has high fixed costs, Albrecht
said, including a mortgage on its building and
maintenance costs for the building's upkeep. It
also pays its own utility bills and interest to the
University on its inventory.
Massy told Stanford News Service that "the
University is sensitive to the needs of the Com
missary's employees and that we will be making
efforts, to the extent possible, to identify al
ternative work" for the 12 University employees
who work there.
