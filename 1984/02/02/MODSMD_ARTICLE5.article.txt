Democrats fault Reagan budget
; on lack of deficit reduction
I Washington — President Reagan's budget, awash with
5150.4 billion in red ink. drew fire yesterday from
Democrats who faulted the plan for proposing nothing to
reduce deficits.
Republicans, though, said the president was straightfor
| ward and realistic.
The $925.5 billion spending plan for the 1985 fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1 is "a stay-the-course
budget . . . certainly not an agenda for action ip reducing
the mounting deficit," said Sen. Law ton Chiles, (D-Fla.),
the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee.
"The budget i k . simply put. an election-year document
which dodges the serious issues which would help ensure a
strong and viable economy for the country's future," Chiles
I said.
Democrats, aware of the upcoming elections, hope to
make budget deficits a key issue.
The president has called for bipartisan talks to settle on
$100 billion that can be trimmed from deficits over the
I next three years.
After seeing Reagan's budget. Democrats decided they
would raise the ante.
"We'll call you (Reagan) and raise you. and we'll be
prepared to make some really big reductions in the
I deficits," said House Majority Leader Jim Wright, (D-
Texas).
$305 billion asked for defense
Washington — The Reagan administration yesterday pro
posed a $305 billion military budget for fiscal 1985, includ
ing a $2 billion down payment on what could become a
costly and controversial space-based defense against nuclear
I missiles,
I lie $305 billion in spending authority is 19 percent more
than the $255.8 billion Congress has approved for fiscal
1984. If supplemental appropriations are approved, and the
I inflation rate in the defense industry is about 5 percent, as
expected, the 1985 budget would represent a "real" in
crease of 13 percent. Pentagon officials said.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the increase
and a $1.9 trillion five-year military spending plan are
needed to respond to "the unprecedented growth of mili
tary power by the Soviet Union in the last few years." The
CIA and NATO recently estimated that Soviet military
spending growth has slowed, but Weinberger said the
Soviets "are widening their advantage."
Weinberger said his request also would help undo damage
I caused by congressional refusal to authorize the full admin
istration program last year. A Pentagon statement warned
that turther cuts would "seriously weaken" national secur
ity without significantly reducing budget deficits.
Democrats solidify support
for withdrawal of Marines
Washington — House Democrats gave overwhelming sup
port yesterday to a non-binding resolution calling for the
"prompt and orderly" withdrawal of U.S. Marines from
Lebanon, hut President Reagan said he will not "pay anv nf-
I tcntion" to the pullout call.
Reagan made his remark as he greeted Yugoslavian Presi
i dent Mika Spiljak at the White House.
At the same time. White House spokesman Larry
Speakes accused the Democrats of pushing action that
"aids and abets" enemies of the peace process in Lebanon.
Pressed to elaborate, he said he was "not questioning their
patriotism" but thought that Democrats should "close
ranks" behind the president.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill Jr., (D~Mass.),
| brushing aside Speakes' criticism, said the House Foreign
; Relations Committee may try to bring the resolution to
I the floor next week.
5 Hours after the House Democrats caucused and backed
the resolution, the Foreign Affairs Committee began dis
cussing the measure and planning for a hearing today and a
I markup tomorrow.
U.S. to stay in Honduras
Washington — The United States intends to conduct
I counterinsurgency military exercises in Honduras near its
border with El Salvador, where leftist Salvadoran guerrillas
have operated in the past, knowledgeable officials said yes
terday.

tentatively dubbed. "Grenadero 1."
Scheduled this summer, the exercises would build on the
I seven-month series of U.S.-Honduran maneuvers known as
"Big Pine 2" and scheduled to end later this month.
Although complete details of Grenadero - 1 have not been
( determined, sources said the plans already concern some of
j ficials who worry that the exercises could embroil U.S.
forces in the Salvadoran civil war.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, without discussing
| details, acknowledged for the first time yesterday that the
United States plans to conduct follow-up exercises after
I Big Pine 2.
He also said 700 to 800 U.S. troops will be kept in Hon
duras even while no exercises are taking place.
