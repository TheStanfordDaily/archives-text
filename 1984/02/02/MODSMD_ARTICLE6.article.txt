## Druse leader calls peace efforts a waste

From The Washington Post
Beirut, Lebanon â€” Lebanese Druse leader Walid
Jumblatt declared yesterday that peace efforts with
the government ol President Amin Gemayel were "a
waste of time" and he said a "decisive battle" is inevi
table.
His remarks came amid the apparent failure so far
of intensive diplomatic efforts this week by Saudi.
American and other intermediaries to win the sup
port of Jumblatt and his main ally. Syria, foi a
Lebanese security plan that could head off the threat
of military action by the Lebanese army to break the
political deadlock.
"The security plan is a waste of time and the
decisive battle is coming and inevitable," Jumblatt
said. "A solution with the Phalangists (Gema\iT's
party) is impossible, impossible."
Jumblatt's comments were broadcast on his Pro
gressive Socialist Party's radio station, which began
regular broadcasts yesterday.
Named the Voice of the Mountain, the station
joined a handful of other nonofficial broadcast
operations sponsored by Lebanese political parties
and free of the state censorship applied to the offi
cial news media.

Since the breakdown in early January of talks about
a security plan to institute a cease-fire and broaden
the presence of the Lebanese army north and south
of Beirut, there has been a hardening of positions by
Jumblatt and the Syrians. This has given rise to
widespread fears here that authorities may try to put
the security plan into effect by force, possibly
launching the army against Moslem militia positions
in the hills east of the capital and in the crowded
southern suburbs.
Although Gemayel yesterday said the "military op
tion" was "only a last resort." Prime Minister Chafik
Wazzan was quoted in the press yesterday as calling
the situation "dangerous." A warning against military
action was also published jointly by Moslem leaders
here who met Tuesday to discuss the rumors about
government preparations for a military offensive.
A senior Western diplomat privately dismissed
these rumors with a wave of his hand, and an in
formed U.S. official said commanders in Lebanon's
U.S.-trained army are themselves divided on what to
do, with those opposed to military action now con
tending that it would cost the government too much
political credibility. A Gemayel aide said: "You don't
do military operations when you are trying to execute

a peace plan." (Uin
Some military anal) Ms regard the 37.000-man
I ebanese army as still too weak to make ii decisive as
sault on well-armed opposition militia units in and
around Beirut. While the army has doubled in size in
the past six months, it has reached only about halt its
projected strength. In view of government plans to
keep it expanding rapidly, some opposition leaders
such as A kef Haider, deputy chairman ot the Amal
Shiite Moslem movement, say they assume auth
orities will play for time while preparing for an of
fensive in the spring.
Meanwhile, a Lebanese army lieutenant and
sergeant were killed in a one-hour clash between army
and Shiite fighters in Beirut's southern suburbs about
500 yards from the U.S. Marine encampment at the
airport. The Marine positions were unaffected by the
exchange. Radio stations said artillery exchanges
resumed after nightfall.
Gemayel's biggest Lebanese stumbling block has
been Jurnblatt. whose party represents less than 10
percent of the population but whose rugged Syrian
supported militia controls the C hout mountains east
of the city.
