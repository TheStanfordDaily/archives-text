# Los Angeles summer Games
## Soviet attendance in question 
### TROY EID Daily staff 
When state Sen. Ken Muddy
pushed his bill through the Rules
Committee on Wednesday, the
halls of the State Capitol didn't
shake. After all, Maddy's bill to
create Senate Joint Resolution

News Analysis

(SJR) 37 has yet to come up for
debate on the floor, let alone
clear the Assembly.
But Maddy, a Republican from
the sweeping 14th District that
includes Fresno and San Luis
Obispo, sent tremors all the way
to Los Angeles. Even political
seismometers in Washington and
Moscow may ultimately pick up
the pulse.
Maddy is leading the fight to
rescind an earlier resolution intro
duced by Sen. John Doolittle, also
a Republican from down south.
Ratified five months ago, as
search parties and political
analysts scrambled to solve the
mystery of Korean Airlines flight
007, Doolittle's resolution, SJR
31, "condemns the government of

the Soviet Union" for "the bar
baric and despicable" downing of
the passenger plane. The initial
draft of SJR 31 was appropriate
and unremarkable, echoed by a
similar Assembly Joint Resolution
and indeed mirrored by proclama
tions in legislatures nationwide.
But just hours later, on the eve
of the legislative interim.
Doolittle added a few more lines
to SJR 31. One of those lines asks
the president and Congress to bar
the Soviets from this summer's
Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
Doolittle's amended resolution
received unanimous Senate ap
proval Sept. 6. Its Assembly coun
terpart was also ratified, but
without the passage about the
Soviet Olympic participation.
Symbolism aside, SJR 31 has
some far-reaching implications.
At the top of the list is the
resolution's inspiration to the Los
Angeles-based Ban the Soviets
coalition, a confederation of 150
organizations "connected via offi
cial, formal endorsements," accor
ding to Tony Mazeika, a member
of the group's national board of
directors.

The attack on Korean Airlines Flight 007 five months ago triggered
anti-Soviet sentiment which prompted a resolution seeking to ban
the Soviets from the summer Olympic Games. This protestor
rallied outside the San Francisco Soviet consulate Sept. 2.
