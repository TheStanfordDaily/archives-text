## Soviet attendance in question 
### TROY EID Daily staff 
When state Sen. Ken Muddy
pushed his bill through the Rules
Committee on Wednesday, the
halls of the State Capitol didn't
shake. After all, Maddy's bill to
create Senate Joint Resolution

News Analysis

(SJR) 37 has yet to come up for
debate on the floor, let alone
clear the Assembly.
But Maddy, a Republican from
the sweeping 14th District that
includes Fresno and San Luis
Obispo, sent tremors all the way
to Los Angeles. Even political
seismometers in Washington and
Moscow may ultimately pick up
the pulse.
Maddy is leading the fight to
rescind an earlier resolution intro
duced by Sen. John Doolittle, also
a Republican from down south.
Ratified five months ago, as
search parties and political
analysts scrambled to solve the
mystery of Korean Airlines flight
007, Doolittle's resolution, SJR
31, "condemns the government of

the Soviet Union" for "the bar
baric and despicable" downing of
the passenger plane. The initial
draft of SJR 31 was appropriate
and unremarkable, echoed by a
similar Assembly Joint Resolution
and indeed mirrored by proclama
tions in legislatures nationwide.
But just hours later, on the eve
of the legislative interim.
Doolittle added a few more lines
to SJR 31. One of those lines asks
the president and Congress to bar
the Soviets from this summer's
Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
Doolittle's amended resolution
received unanimous Senate ap
proval Sept. 6. Its Assembly coun
terpart was also ratified, but
without the passage about the
Soviet Olympic participation.
Symbolism aside, SJR 31 has
some far-reaching implications.
At the top of the list is the
resolution's inspiration to the Los
Angeles-based Ban the Soviets
coalition, a confederation of 150
organizations "connected via offi
cial, formal endorsements," accor
ding to Tony Mazeika, a member
of the group's national board of
directors.

The attack on Korean Airlines Flight 007 five months ago triggered
anti-Soviet sentiment which prompted a resolution seeking to ban
the Soviets from the summer Olympic Games. This protestor
rallied outside the San Francisco Soviet consulate Sept. 2.
In a telephone interview with Ihe
Daily. Mazeika said his group has sup
port "from all kinds of ethnic, religi
ous and political organizations,
from Eastern European emigrants to
the Conservative Caucus.
"We're talking about a member
ship of 50 million Americans, he
said. "There has to be a voice to
speak out for those dead people
who perished aboard KAI 007.
The architects ot Ban the Soviets
want the coalition to become a self
fulfilling prophecy. "Our whole
thrust is to try to convince the In
ternational Olympic Committee
(IOC) that it would be wrong for the
Soviets to come here." Mazeika said.
"We have nothing against the indi
vidual team members. But we want
to deny the Soviet Union a political
victory. Their coming here would
demonstrate the supremacy ot their
ideology. They teed on that stult.
To the coalition, a Soviet visit
means more than moral indignation.
It means 25 Aeroflot jetliners and a
Soviet cruise ship descending on Los
Angeles in a potential orgy of
espionage.
"We feel that Southern California
will be Hooded with Soviet agents,"
Mazeika said. "We're taking about
some phenomenal numbers. Add it all
up and you've got 4000 Soviets run
ning around without restrictions.
That's never happened before."

Ban the Soviets used to circulate
petitions to push its views, but as
Mazeika explained, "petitions by
themselves are totally meaningless
unless they are attached to legisla
tion." Does legislation include SJR
31?
"Sen. Doolittle dues not actively
support Ban the Soviets, but I think
the coalition's views are consistent
with the tack being taken by the
senator's resolution, a Doolittle
aide said Wednesday.
Mazeika carried it further: "Why
sure, we're working with Sen.
Doolittle."
In fact. Ban the Soviets has intro
duced sample resolutions based on
SJR 31 in state legislatures across
the country, according to Mazeika.
And with the help of Rep. Philip
Crane (R-III.). the coalition recently
launched a bill to create House Con
current Resolution 243. which
"reinforces SJR 31 but goes farther.
It asks the president to ask the lOC
to have the Soviet Union withdrawn
from the Games."
Given the pitfalls of intrapartisan
politics, why did Maddy choose to in
troduce SJR 37?
As an aide is quick to point out.
"He's close friends with Peter
Ueberroth, head of the Los Angeles
Olympic Organizing Committee."
Maddy offered more of an intel
lectual framework in a memo he
recently sent to SJR 37 supporters in
both houses:
"It is proper for all Americans, es
pecially legislators, to express
outrage at the Soviet action in

shooting down Korean flight 007. To
the extent that SJR 31 did that, as
it passed the Senate, it deserves sup
port.
•What is improper," the memo
continues, "is to take the Olympics,
which are designed to bring people
together, not withstanding past con
flicts and present relationships, and
to use the event as fodder for a poli
tical campaign or political rhetoric."
The showdown over SJR 31 is likely
to involve maneuvers in both the
Senate and the Assembly. On the
local front. Democratic As
semblyman Byron Sher has endorsed
Maddy's memo, according to a
spokesman in Sher's Mountain View
office. State Sen. Alfred Alquist of
San Jose, who presently serves Stan
ford. was unavailable for comment.
As tor Sen. Doolittle, "He stands
by his earlier resolution." according
to an aide. "We expect a pretty
heated fight on the floor."
It looks like Ban the Soviets will be
there, too. Mazeika said his group is
backing Doolittle and plans to intro
duce an SJR 31-style bill in the As
sembly. He would not identity the
assemblyman sponsoring the bill.
