From the Los Angeles Times
Caracas, Venezuela — Secretary of
State George Shultz. in a sharp attack
on Nicaragua's leftist leaders, said yes
terday that "they have a lot to
apologize for" and that "it's no wonder
they're worried" about a U.S. invasion.
Shultz, who attended the inaugura
tion of Venezuelan President Jaime
Lusinchi earlier in the day, told a new
conference that a charge by Nicaraguan
leader Daniel Ortega that the United

States is planning to invade his country
"must be a figment of his imagina
tion."
But he added: "There's a very impor
tant message there. In order to keep
conjuring up that image, Mr. Ortega
and his colleagues must be worried."
"If I were them," Shultz said, "I'd be
worried too."
Shultz went on to excoriate the
Nicaraguans for building up their armed
forces, harassing the Roman Catholic

Church and censoring the press. His
comments were the toughest that he
has directed at Nicaragua in recent
memory and reflected a gradual shar
pening of the conflict between the
Sandinista rulers of Nicaragua and the
Reagan administration during the past
two months.
As recently as December, Shultz was
cautiously praising the Sandinista
regime for a few, hesitant moves
toward decreasing the number of

Cuban advisers in the country, cutting
hack assistance to El Salvador's leftist
rebels, and easing domestic repression.
All of those measures corresponded
to demands that the United States has
made of Nicaragua, and Shultz urged
the Sandinistas to continue making
such concessions.
Since then, however, U.S. officials
charge that the Nicaraguans have slid
backward on the issues of concern to
the Reagan administration.
