## The
						Stanford Daily Politics and Olympics

The question of whether Soviet officials
from the San Francisco consulate will be allowed
to attend the Olympic soccer matches at Stan
ford Stadium may have jumped the gun. After
all, this assumes that a Soviet team will he per
mitted to participate in the Los Angeles
Games— an issue that remains in some doubt.
This figured to be a safe assumption. It's been
years since the United States and the Interna
tional Olympic Committee (IOC) accepted Los
Angeles offer to host the Games. Those who
choose not to come can stay home — just like
we did in 1980.
Sometimes, however, it takes a California
state senator and 50 million Americans to
remind you not to make assumptions.
State Sen. John Doolittle recently introduced
a bill which asked the president to ban the
Soviets from participating in the Games. The bill
has since passed, but now many legislators are
attempting to rescind the resolution.
But the Southern California Republican,
fueled by strong anti-Soviet rhetoric, is holding
firm.
And if that isn't enough, it appears the Ban
the Soviets coalition — a Los Angeles-based

group which claims to have the backing of 50
million people in 150 organizations — is at
tempting to pass similar resolutions in the U.S.
Congress and in state legislatures across the
country.
Doolittle's politicizing of the Games should
not be surprising—it's been happening ever since
the 1936 Berlin Games, when Hitler refused to
accept Jesse Owens —but it is nevertheless dis
turbing.
Thankfully, it is also disturbing to one of
Doolittle's colleagues. State Sen. Ken Maddy,
another southern Republican, asserts that it is
"our nation's commitment to welcome" Soviet
citizens to the Games.
Perhaps Maddy sees the Olympics as more
than a rusty tool of foreign policy.
In a bipolar world, inviting the other pole in
for a visit is bound to be risky. But we knew
that long ago, long before we extended our first
welcome to the Soviets and most of the rest of
the world. We knew then and know now that
sometimes it's better to take risks than break
promises.
Maddy is right. The Olympics are designed to
bring people together, not tear them apart.
