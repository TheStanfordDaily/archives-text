## Mideast column biased, one-sided 
### 
Sally Newman thinks "It's time to
reconsider relations in the Mideast."
(Daily, Jan. 31). After much heating
about the bush it turns out the new
bottle contains old wine after all.
Certainly, "de facto accommoda
tion" — a euphemism for continued
Israeli militarism — is not all that
novel or inventive a notion.
Since "the screaming headlines'"
are misleading in their purported
emphasis on national rights, dispos
session and homelessness, Newman
wants to go beyond them to the real
issues. It is interesting to note that
in the end these revolve around the
stereotyped, if not bigoted, images
of the popular media.
Newman concludes from all this
that peace is a "chimera" and
stability an "illusion." What then is
to be done? Here she does not
hesitate to hold up Israel's imposi
tion of its will on Lebanon as a
paradigm. The Lebanese, she tells us,
now have "good pragmatic reasons
like self-preservation" not to ir
ritate Israel.
A number of questions come to
mind. Is Newman's visit to Lebanon
via Israel a sign that "progress has
been made towards conflict resolu
tion," or a straightforward violation
of Lebanese sovereignity? If there is
"progress" why the resentment of
the Lebanese and the daily attacks
against the Israeli occupation
forces? And why did the Lebanese
prime minister declare only a few
days ago that Israel is threatening
the only remaining hopes for
Lebanese reconciliation?
Finally, how long will Israel be in a
position to dictate terms and make
offers that can't be refused? The
current balance of forces is obvious
ly not immutable. Might not Israel's
policies of occupation, annexation
and settlement and its refusal to
come to terms with the injustice
perpetuated against the Palestinians
catch up with it one day? Attempt
ing to batter opponents into submis-

sion is no formula for long-term
accommodation.

Blood donations
A recent front page headline (Jan.
30) reads, "AIDS scare decreases
blood donations." In the article,
Roger Svoboda, blood center admin
istrative manager, attributes a
reduction in the number of blood
donations in recent months to an
unfounded fear among donors that
AIDS could be contracted in the act
of giving blood.
To me, the far more likely expla
nation is that gay men, the most
numerous of the "high risk" groups
have stopped giving blood, either
because of the screening procedures,
which require them to identify
themselves as gay, or, more probably
out of a sincere and genuine concern
that by donating they might unwit
tingly taint the nation's blood
supply.
The thesis advanced in the article
is an index of society's current atti
tude toward gay people: It is finally
okay to admit that we exist — but
only as carriers of a fatal disease.
The idea that gay people act as
conscientious citizens, capable of
contributing blood, as well as other
resources and talents, apparently
remains — at least to the Medical
School Blood Center and to headline
writers at The Daily — unthinkable.

Stanford's humor
I really chuckled last week at the
reprint from the Harvard Crimson
(Daily, Jan. 23). It was a brilliant
piece of satire by two Harvard stu
dents about a recent survey by U.S.
News and World Report in which
47.6 percent of college presidents
named Harvard as a ranking under
graduate institution.

In their viewpoint (Daily, Jan. 31),
Stanford undergraduates Agar and
Nagareda surprised me by criticizing
the Crimson reprint as if it were a
serious opinion.
If we Stanford students wish to
be viewed on a par with Harvard
students, we have to be at least as
perceptive and witty as they are, or
else The Daily should continue to
get its editorial copy from the Har
vard Crimson!

Moped crackdown
Over Christmas break a great
injustice was done.
Without warning or concrete
reasoning given to the students, the
Row Office ordered the Stanford
Police to impound any gasoline- > v>,
powered vehicles (i.e., mopeds,
scooters, etc.) parked in or around
University housing. Cited was an
obscure fire safety code that
prohibits gasoline-powered vehicles
from being stored within 50 feet of
University housing or buildings.
By trying to avoid having my
scooter stolen over break. I was
badly ripped off. My scooter wasn't
stolen, it was merely being held for
ransom at a $50 towing charge and
$10 a day storage cost for a total of
$140.
Maybe somebody at the Row
Office is related to the owner of
the towing service. Maybe the staff of
the Row Office was merely trying
to jockey for favor in an effort to
succeed Heloisa. Who knows? What
is clear, however, is that a simple
warning would have sufficed, either
before break or in lieu of impound
ment. This display of University
authority by the Row Office accom
plished nothing, except increased
bitterness between students and the
administration.
