# End televised depravity
## 
### 
In recent years, the intelligence level and moral in
tegrity of television programs have drastically dwindled.
Once tilled with "My Favorite Martian," "Get Smart."
and"I Spy, the airwaves are now saturated with shows
garnished by unneccessary violence and unrestrained
sexual overtones. 1 he mindless decadent exhibits include
"Dallas." "Three's Company," "Matt Houston," and the
filthy horde of social lesions mislabeled as daytime
dramas.
These modern, "hip" television programs cause moral
and intellectual decay. Acts such as adultery,
homosexuality, incest and ghastly violence, which were
once unmentionable in polite society as well as on televi
sion. are now not only propelled at us, but also presented
to us as common and acceptable through the daily
maligned use of television. We are bombarded with soot
and trash which is created, and produced, by executives
at the three major networks.
The irresponsibility of the "big three" has caused the
problem facing our American audience: How can the
airwaves be purged and made usable by viewers who wish
to experience quality programs rather than gaze at
violently sexy garbage.
As the problem increased, of course, solutions were
offered. These solutions callcd tor everything from the
abolition of all television to allowing only the broadcasts
of public television stations. I personally reject all their
solutions including the two previously mentioned. To
erase the invention of the television would be an abso
lute crime against science.
Though improperly used now, we must not lose the
battle to implement its proper role. By destroying all
televisions, we would forfeit a potentially healthy asset
to human society. The watching of only public television
is too unacceptable. There are no sports programs and
this deficiency alone makes it totally ludicrous in the
role of solitary broadcaster.
Because you are now familiar with the problems and
the flaws of some proposed solutions, I feel you can con
sider my proposal with a knowledgeable but open mind. I
propose that the television executives be held personally
responsible for the shows they present. 1 propose that
they come under the thumb of an appointed censor soci
ety for the first offense, and that they be executed
publicly for committing a second crime.
My plan can be easily facilitated due to the fact that
all the necessary items are in good supply. There are
many groups eager to act as judges or censors, and since
the tool for execution will be the television itself, no
shortage exists.
Although the executives may choose to omit their
names from the credits once my plan begins, I believe the
guilty can be identified by past modes of misoperation
and network spies. Once in custody, the executive guilty
of only one offense will be handed over to the country's
censor society.
It is my personal preference to have the Moral
Majority, with the aid of a few government officials, act
as censors of the executives' future actions. I choose this
combination because both are already anxious to curtail
our personal habits. Both groups have already expressed
the desire to regulate the airwaves; and such a combina

tion would pull television back into what it once was, a
realistic and honest world of shows like "Amos and
Andy," and "Superman."
We should embrace the censorship program with
elated hearts. It was our excess of freedoms that
created our problems, and the censor societies would
carefully take our freedoms away. The success records
left by other groups who tried to direct personal tastes
must surely convince the public of my proposal's sound
ness. Blazing victories like the Salem and McCarthy
witch hunts almost assure the acceptance of my plan's
first section.
The second part would be much simpler to implement.
II a criminal already under the censor's eye commits an
other atrocity against mankind, he will be taken to a
public arena, have his eyes glued open and then be forced
to watch his own crimes for 4N hours. When the 4N hours
have expired, the criminal will be soaked in water and
repeatedly thrown headfirst into a 26-inch color televi
sion set, paid for by the incorrigible, until he is either cut
to death by the glass or electrocuted by the water and
wires.
This plan would benefit other criminals and the public.
Television executives would quickly become motivated
to create decent shows, instead of sailing on slime as
they now do. Also, the participants of my plan would
leave an cxcess of media jobs, greatly reducing unemploy
ment in the industry.
Solving the problem quickly and inexpensively is the
greatest feature of my plan. When threatened with
death, the networks would definitely clean up, atidF the
public could enjoy television. Also, the admission price to
see the executions would help the city in which purges
take place. Local towns could raise revenue by destroying
their own muck-sellers. But to the joy of all Americans,
by holding executions, at increased prices, in the Ken
nedy Center for Performing Arts,- the termination of
network criminals would greatly reduce the national
debt.
Only the grace of God kept my other proposals from
public acceptance. I had lirst advocated such eccentric
ideas as having each American turn off his set whenever
worthless programs were on. I thought this would have
echoed the message for quality clearly — hut no one else
thought so. I admit my error in thinking that the loss of
viewers, thus a loss in advertising fees for the networks,
would have made them responsive to our cries.
The logic of my plan is unavoidable and it must begin
immediately. Because constant exposure leads to con
tamination, we will soon reach a point at which filth on
television does not alarm or outrage us. If that point is
reached, cleaning and improving the quality of television
will be unneccessary. We will no longer care. We will have
accepted as fact that we must muddle in and watch
mediocrity and trash, settling for nothing and demand
ing nothing.
American television and American society will be as
two mirrors, each perfectly reflecting the other — both
hard, both cold and both empty.

In recent years, the intelligence level and moral in
tegrity of television programs have drastically dwindled.
Once tilled with "My Favorite Martian," "Get Smart."
and"I Spy, the airwaves are now saturated with shows
garnished by unneccessary violence and unrestrained
sexual overtones. 1 he mindless decadent exhibits include
"Dallas." "Three's Company," "Matt Houston," and the
filthy horde of social lesions mislabeled as daytime
dramas.
These modern, "hip" television programs cause moral
and intellectual decay. Acts such as adultery,
homosexuality, incest and ghastly violence, which were
once unmentionable in polite society as well as on televi
sion. are now not only propelled at us, but also presented
to us as common and acceptable through the daily
maligned use of television. We are bombarded with soot
and trash which is created, and produced, by executives
at the three major networks.
The irresponsibility of the "big three" has caused the
problem facing our American audience: How can the
airwaves be purged and made usable by viewers who wish
to experience quality programs rather than gaze at
violently sexy garbage.
As the problem increased, of course, solutions were
offered. These solutions callcd tor everything from the
abolition of all television to allowing only the broadcasts
of public television stations. I personally reject all their
solutions including the two previously mentioned. To
erase the invention of the television would be an abso
lute crime against science.
Though improperly used now, we must not lose the
battle to implement its proper role. By destroying all
televisions, we would forfeit a potentially healthy asset
to human society. The watching of only public television
is too unacceptable. There are no sports programs and
this deficiency alone makes it totally ludicrous in the
role of solitary broadcaster.
Because you are now familiar with the problems and
the flaws of some proposed solutions, I feel you can con
sider my proposal with a knowledgeable but open mind. I
propose that the television executives be held personally
responsible for the shows they present. 1 propose that
they come under the thumb of an appointed censor soci
ety for the first offense, and that they be executed
publicly for committing a second crime.
My plan can be easily facilitated due to the fact that
all the necessary items are in good supply. There are
many groups eager to act as judges or censors, and since
the tool for execution will be the television itself, no
shortage exists.
Although the executives may choose to omit their
names from the credits once my plan begins, I believe the
guilty can be identified by past modes of misoperation
and network spies. Once in custody, the executive guilty
of only one offense will be handed over to the country's
censor society.
It is my personal preference to have the Moral
Majority, with the aid of a few government officials, act
as censors of the executives' future actions. I choose this
combination because both are already anxious to curtail
our personal habits. Both groups have already expressed
the desire to regulate the airwaves; and such a combina

tion would pull television back into what it once was, a
realistic and honest world of shows like "Amos and
Andy," and "Superman."
We should embrace the censorship program with
elated hearts. It was our excess of freedoms that
created our problems, and the censor societies would
carefully take our freedoms away. The success records
left by other groups who tried to direct personal tastes
must surely convince the public of my proposal's sound
ness. Blazing victories like the Salem and McCarthy
witch hunts almost assure the acceptance of my plan's
first section.
The second part would be much simpler to implement.
II a criminal already under the censor's eye commits an
other atrocity against mankind, he will be taken to a
public arena, have his eyes glued open and then be forced
to watch his own crimes for 4N hours. When the 4N hours
