# Blue Cross to pay for heart-lung transplants
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Physicians here and across the na
tion who have been fighting to get
heart and heart-lung transplants
declared non-experimental surgery
may have just won a major battle.
Blue Shield of California announced
Wednesday that it has decided to pay
for heart and heart-lung transplants
at Stanford.
It is expected that the move will
boost the heart and heart-lung pro
gram in two ways—it will make the
operation more accessible to a wider
variety of patients, and it will en
courage other insurers and govern
ment policymakers to consider heart
and heart-lung transplant "standard"
instead of experimental surgery.
It may also influence the decision
of the federal Health Care Finance
Administration, which is currently
conducting a study to determine the
feasibility of providing cardiac
transplantation under the Medicare
program. Until recently, Medicare
had only paid for transplants used in
the study.
The present cost of heart
transplant surgery— a minimum of
$125,000 at the Medical Center—is
prohibitive to many patients. Before
Blue Shield's decision, transplants

were funded through research grants
or paid for by the transplant patient,
unless insurers made an arbitrary
decision to pay for the operation.
Lois Takota, the administrative
services manager for the heart
transplant program, said that many
insurance companies pay for all or
part of heart transplant surgery
without having an official policy, but
added that this caused "ambiguity
and uncertainty for patients whose
survival depends on a transplant op
eration."
Now, patients with Blue Shield
coverage can have the operation
gratis—but only at Stanford. Medi
cal Center press spokesman Mike
Goodkind said that Blue Shield's
reasons for only insuring Stanford
transplants still remain a mystery,
but speculated that Stanford's ex
cellent reputation had something to
do with its decison.
"We've been doing these opera
tions longer than anyone," Goodkind
said. The Med Center began per
forming heart transplants in 1968;
since then the operation has saved
hundreds of lives and the survival
rate for patients has zoomed from
22 to 80 percent. At present, heart
transplants are performed
nationwide, but heart-lung
transplants are done at only eight
other hospitals.
Another reason that Stanford
alone would be chosen was that Blue
Shield may realize the need to limit
the number of facilities where
transplants are performed. Accor

ding to Goodkind, members of the
Stanford transplant team have ex
pressed concern about an overabun
dance of transplant centers, because
of the already fierce competition for
transplant donors.
In recent months, there have been
several attempts at legislation to in
crease the efficiency of transplant
operations. In October, Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) proposed a na
tional task force for the procure
ment of organ donors. In late
November, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-
Utah) introduced a bill which ex

pands the content of the bill
submitted by Kennedy to include
legislation against the buying and sel
ling of organs.
There is no specific legislation con
cerning upgrading the status of heart
and heart-lung transplants from
"experimental" to "routine" surgery.
Several Stanford physicians have ex
pressed their views on the subject at
hearings sponsored by California
State Sen. Ollie Speraw. A spokes
man at Speraw's office said that he
was considering introducing legisla
tion as a result of those hearings.
