## Public school prayer undermines Constitution 
### 
President Reagan devoted a portion of his
State of the Union address on Jan. 25 to an issue
that is close to the hearts of his far-right fun
damentalist supporters: namely, the introduc
tion of organized prayer into the public schools.
Reagan's call tor school prayer is a none-too
subtle indication of the kind of born-again, un
varnished. right-wing conservatism we can expect

VIEWPOINT

from the president once he is freed from the
need to cater to an image of "moderation" in or
der to get re-elected — if the nation is foolish
enough to re-elect him.
More disturbing than Reagan's inability to
comprehend the ugly threat his proposal poses to
religious freedom and tolerance is the shocking
acceptance, and indeed popularity, of the mis
leading "prayer-in-the-schools" campaign among
the general public. Polls show that the
percentage of Americans of "prayer in the public
schools" is almost as high as the overwhelming
majority which rejects Reagan's anti-abortion
stance and endorses free choice. For this reason,
it is the "school-prayer" campaign that poses the
greatest threat to our Constitution, undermin
ing as it does principles of religious freedom and
separation of church and state dating back to
Thomas Jefferson.
Reagan spoke almost tearfully of "the right of
little children to pray to God every morning at
school," when he knows perfectly well, or should
know, that the right to pray is not at issue.
Public school children are perfectly free to pray

at any time and in any manner they please, so
long as they do not interfere with the right of
other children to get what they came to school
for, and what their parents pay taxes for: an edu
cation. And that proviso is hardly an onerous bur
den. I've spent 13 years in public school; I know.
Counting lunch breaks, class breaks and play
ground time, not to mention the almost un
limited opportunities for "silent prayer," I find
it hard to picture a child religious enough to use
more than a fraction of that time in communi
cating with God (or the deity of his choice).
It this is not enough, if their parents desire
round-the-clock indoctrination and round-the
clock organized prayer sessions, they are per
fectly free to ignore the public schools and go to
the private school of their choice.
Those parents who demand that the public
schools go beyond their present mission of offer
ing a free, basic, objective education to all who
apply, and add to that the mission of supplying
their child's religious needs, are making an imper
tinent, unreasonable and unconstitutional
demand. The principle of our Constitution is
clear, simple and unequivocal: No one should be
forced to pay taxes to support a religion he does
not believe in.
Once one accepts the idea of organized prayers
administered by public school teachers and paid
by compulsory taxes during compulsory
attendance school hours, the door is opened for a
hideous political miasma of violent partisanship
and religious factionalism. What will be the exact
text of the prayer read by the teacher? (As col
umnist George Will has pointed out, a prayer
bland enough to satisfy everyone would be devoid

of any real religious meaning.) Precisely which,
and how many, religions, and in which localities,
will he entitled to partake of this new govern
ment service?
Ihe result will be either to turn religion into
(odder lor the political arena — precisely the evil
the Iramers of the First Amendment sought to
avoid; or, in areas where one religion has an over
whelming majority, the establishment of that re
ligion as the official state doctrine (a nice,
clear-cut solution; just look at the Islamic
Republic of Iran). Ihe latter solution is the one
the New Rightists hope will occur. The Moral
Majority's Jerry Falwell expresses blithe agree
ment with the proposition that the public
schools in each locality should "reflect" the reli
gion of the majority. It is hard to imagine, I sub
mit, a proposition more fundamentally out of
touch with everything this country stands for.
And what is the message that Reagan and Fal
well have lor those taxpayers who don't happen
to belong to the "majority religion," and who
resent being forced to pay taxes to support it?
Tough luck, I guess.
And what is their message for the eight-year
old child who doesn't want to sit through a religi
ous ceremony led by the authority-figure of his
teacher and joined in by the vocal majority of his
peer group, because it just happens to violate his
conscience? Well, he can just be excused from
class to go to the principal's office and con
template his nonconformity.
As Reagan concluded his address, "God Bless
America." Perhaps he should have added: "And
to hell with the Constitution."
