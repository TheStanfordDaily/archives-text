## Tahoe trips: hitting the slots and the slopes 
### 
"Wonderful" is the best way
to describe the Lake Tahoe
area, whether you visit it in
winter or summer, enjoy nature
or city life. With 71 miles of
shoreline, the extensive area
around Lake Tahoe is a
paradise to fishermen, sailors,
hikers, gamblers and most im
portantly right now,
skiiers — both downhill and
cross-country.
After a three-and-a-half to
four-hour drive, you will arrive
in South Lake Tahoe to be
greeted by a sparkling blue lake
and a view of the ski runs at
Heavenly. Heavenly Ski Resort
is one mile from town and is a
vast two-state complex de
signed for skiers of all levels.
About 50 percent of the runs are
for intermediate skiers, with
25 percent designated as novice
and another 25 as advanced.
Heavenly offers excellent
skiing, a variety of runs, and 16
chairlifts and one tram to get
you where you want to go. The
cost, however, is the highest of
any ski resort at $23 for a one
day weekend lift ticket.
While you may consider
Heavenly worth the price, you
can also choose to ski more rea
sonably (in the range of $15-
$20) at some of the other
resorts in the area. Though

smaller, and farther from
South Lake Tahoe City, Sierra
Ski Ranch. Kirkwood, Echo
Summit and others are well
worth skiing.
Wherever you choose to ski,
be sure you are prepared. It is a
good idea to get reservations
for lodging in advance, espe
cially if you plan your trip for
one of the long weekends.
Be sure and bring prop
er clothing. Though Tahoe
is often warm and spring skiing
is possible in February, cold
weather and even snow are pos
sibilities. Most skiiers wear
either sunglasses or ski goggles,
and you may tie a bandana
around your neck in case you
need to use it to protect your
face from biting winds. Water
resistant clothing is especially
useful if you plan to fall alot or
ski in snow flurries.
Even if you don't ski, Tahoe
in winter has a lot to offer. If
you are over 21 years old you
can go dancing or cross the
state line into Nevada where
numerous "asinos await both
the gambler and the spectator.
The various clubs offer special
discount books with cocktail
and game coupons, which you
can request at your motel or
hotel.
When looking for accomoda

tions, a perfect choice tor large
or small groups is Lakeland Vil
lage. An inclusive ski package is
available, along with a ski
shuttle to bring you to
Heavenly and back again. Inside
the lodge are studios and
bedroom suites complete with
kitchens. In winter they can be
rented for one to five people
at a price range between $69
and $111. Two story town
houses starting at $90 are an
other option. After skiing, you
can take a plunge in the spa,
swim in one of the heated
pools, use the sauna or choose
to watch television in your
room.
In addition, in summer you
can rent a townhouse on the
beach, play tennis or go horse
back riding and golf nearby. For
more information call (916)
541-7711 or write Lakeland
Village, PO Box A, South Lake
Tahoe, CA 95705.
Pamphlets on what to do,
where to stay and what to eat
while in South Lake Tahoe are
available and provide some
helpful ideas. 1 went to the
Chart House for dinner. Lo
cated on the Nevada side in
Kingsbury Grade, it was,a short
drive from Main Street. Be
cause it sits on a mountain, it
offers a spectacular view of
the lake and city. Even at
night, when the lake is a black
pool, the glittering snow below
your window-seat and the
lights of the casinos and town
beyond is breathtaking. The
Chart House in Tahoe is one of
a chain of restaurants, all lo
cated in picturesque settings
and serving superb food, in
cluding steak, seafood, chicken
and nightly specials. The salad
bar, which accompanies all
meals or can be purchased on
its own, is extensive, including
vegetables, fruits, potato
salad, and coleslaw and salad
toppings. Opening at 5 p.m.,
meals start at $7.
Even if you don't decide to
go there for dinner, stop for a
drink and 'heir famous mud
pie. The 'waiter told me people
can seldom eat a whole piece
[ after a meal, but it is so tasty
I they choose to split a piece.
1 Complete with mocha ice
I cream, Oreo-cookie crust,
I fudge icing and whipped cream
1 and nuts, it looks and tastes
I delicious. The bar area is cozy

with its dim lighting and
fireplace. Whether you choose
to visit the Chart House for an
excellent dinner or for a drink
and dessert, the magnificent
view combined with its charm
ing atmosphere inside should
not be missed.
Carlos Murphy's is another
not-to-be-missed eating es
tablishment in South Lake
Tahoe, at 3678 Highway 50.
Try one of their 132 dinners or
go for Sunday brunch —you will
enjoy both the food and
unique atmosphere of this
Mexican-Irish restaurant. It
you are Irish (or even if you're
not!), you can order the "7
Course Irish Dinner": one
quart of beer served with
potato skins. Don't let the
name confuse you; its only in
tended to be an appetizer.
Ordering is a complicated
process not only because every
thing sounds delicious, but be
cause there is so much to look
at inside the restaurant. An
tique wall-hangings as well as
modern decorations adorn
every free inch of wall-space.
Everyone working at the res
taurant wears slo-pitch
baseball jerseys. Brunch offers
complimentary champagne and
a basket of fresh rolls and
pastry. Warm and delicious, the
rolls were a real treat. The
menu includes such drinks as .
the Siesta Sangria, a burgundy,
champagne, grapefruit and or
ange juice mixed with fruit gar
nishes, Bloody Murphys and
the Tamale Malone Fizz, a
drink with fluffy egg whites,
gin and citrus. Unless you are
on a liquid diet, the other side
of the menu will be of interest
to you too. You can choose
from steak 'n eggs, eggs ,
benedict, crepes, omelettes,
quiche and huevos rancheros, a
corn tortilla covered with
retried beans, two fried
eggs, ranchero sauce, sour cream
and avocado. Served with fruit
and a choice of hash brown
potatoes or retried beans,
brunch begins at $4.65.
Back in the car, we immedi
ately looked for Pleasant Hill
and Emeryville, the locations
of two Bay <\rea Car\os
Murphy's.

"Wonderful" is the best way
to describe the Lake Tahoe
area, whether you visit it in
winter or summer, enjoy nature
or city life. With 71 miles of
shoreline, the extensive area
around Lake Tahoe is a
paradise to fishermen, sailors,
hikers, gamblers and most im
portantly right now,
skiiers — both downhill and
cross-country.
After a three-and-a-half to
four-hour drive, you will arrive
in South Lake Tahoe to be
greeted by a sparkling blue lake
and a view of the ski runs at
Heavenly. Heavenly Ski Resort
is one mile from town and is a
vast two-state complex de
signed for skiers of all levels.
About 50 percent of the runs are
for intermediate skiers, with
25 percent designated as novice
and another 25 as advanced.
Heavenly offers excellent
skiing, a variety of runs, and 16
chairlifts and one tram to get
you where you want to go. The
cost, however, is the highest of
any ski resort at $23 for a one
day weekend lift ticket.
While you may consider
Heavenly worth the price, you
can also choose to ski more rea
sonably (in the range of $15-
$20) at some of the other
resorts in the area. Though

smaller, and farther from
South Lake Tahoe City, Sierra
Ski Ranch. Kirkwood, Echo
Summit and others are well
worth skiing.
Wherever you choose to ski,
be sure you are prepared. It is a
good idea to get reservations
for lodging in advance, espe
cially if you plan your trip for
one of the long weekends.
Be sure and bring prop
er clothing. Though Tahoe
is often warm and spring skiing
is possible in February, cold
weather and even snow are pos
sibilities. Most skiiers wear
either sunglasses or ski goggles,
and you may tie a bandana
around your neck in case you
need to use it to protect your
face from biting winds. Water
resistant clothing is especially
useful if you plan to fall alot or
ski in snow flurries.
Even if you don't ski, Tahoe
in winter has a lot to offer. If
you are over 21 years old you
can go dancing or cross the
state line into Nevada where
numerous "asinos await both
the gambler and the spectator.
The various clubs offer special
discount books with cocktail
and game coupons, which you
can request at your motel or
hotel.
When looking for accomoda

tions, a perfect choice tor large
or small groups is Lakeland Vil
lage. An inclusive ski package is
available, along with a ski
shuttle to bring you to
Heavenly and back again. Inside
the lodge are studios and
bedroom suites complete with
kitchens. In winter they can be
rented for one to five people
at a price range between $69
and $111. Two story town
houses starting at $90 are an
other option. After skiing, you
can take a plunge in the spa,
swim in one of the heated
pools, use the sauna or choose
to watch television in your
room.
In addition, in summer you
can rent a townhouse on the
beach, play tennis or go horse
back riding and golf nearby. For
more information call (916)
541-7711 or write Lakeland
Village, PO Box A, South Lake
Tahoe, CA 95705.
