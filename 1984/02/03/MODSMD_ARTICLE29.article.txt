## Sun Devils scorched by the Cardinal in Tempe 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
Tempe, Ariz. — The Stanford basketball
team may still be turning Coach Tom
Davis' hair gray, but tor the third con
secutive game Davis came out smiling at
the end.
The Cardinal overcame a 32-27 halftime
deficit and some hot first half shooting by
Arizona State to beat the Sun Devils. 64-
SK. on their home court last night.
The win was Stanford's third straight
Pacific-10 Conference victory following
six consecutive conference losses. Arizona
State fell to 7-11 overall and 2-6 in the
conference, while Stanford improved to
14-7 and 3-6 in the Pac-10.
Davis said after the game that his
team's experience in close games may have
played a major role in the closing minutes.
"Just from the standpoint of being
through so many close situations it really
helped," Davis said following the game.
"But that still does not mean we will al
ways execute. Tonight, we executed well."
The game's turning point came with
10:21 left as Keith Jones was fouled by
ASU guard Steve Beck while attempting a
layup. Beck was called for a technical after
arguing the call. Jones made all three free
throws and Stanford took its first lead of
the contest, 49-48.
"That was the turning point," Jones said
of the three-point play. "When I got
fouled and the technical was called, we
took the lead and the momentum seemed
to shift."
Beck followed with a layup after a fast
break by Sun Devil guard Chris Beasley,
but John Revelli followed with a layup of
his own, giving the lead back to the Car
dinal, 51-50.
Sun Devil guard Bobby Thompson then
hit a 19-footer, but after that it was all
Stanford as the Cardinal scored five
straight points to take the lead.
In the first half Beck, who had been
averaging just K. 2 points per game, had 16
and ended with a game-high 24 points.
Beasley, who had been shooting just .256
in his last four games, hit 7-of-12 from
the field and had 16 points.
Jones had 20 points and Revelli added 16
more to key the Stanford victory.
"The leadership that Revelli and Jones
gave really calmed our young kids down,"
Davis said. "The bench in general also
played well and Wichary and Ramee both
gave us some good spurts.
Revelli, who had just four points in the
first half, piayed a major role in the

second-half surge. Revelli credited his
second-half shooting to his ability to get
open.
"In the second half. I started moving
around more and getting open," Revelli
said. "I was definitely moving to the ball
more in the second half."
The Stanford defense also tightened in
the second half and began forcing ASIJ to
commit turnovers and mistakes.
"I think that they (Stanford) shot the
ball better (in the second half) and we
made a lot of turnovers," Sun Devil Coach
Bob Weinhauer said.
"We had to deal with their pressure for
a full 40 minutes," Weinhauer said. "Not
five minutes or 10 minutes mind you, but
for the whole game. They don't a'low you
to let up at all."

Stanford's presence at the foul line also
played a significant role, according to
Weinhauer.
"Our goal was to keep them (Stanford)
off the foul line." he said. "They were just
5-of-7 in the first half, hut in the second
half we allowed them to get the hall inside
and draw the fouls."
Foul trouble was a problem for ASU as
forward Jim Deines fouled out near the
end of the game and center Phil Mckinney
also had four fouls. Revelli and Jones also
had four fouls apiece.
The Sun Devils shot 53.6 percent from
the floor in the first half, but tallied
just 4N percent in the second. The Cardinal
boosted its field goal percentage from 50
to 52.3 percent from the first to the
second half.
