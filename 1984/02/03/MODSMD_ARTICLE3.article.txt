## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Staff writer 
The United States under the
Reagan administration constitutes
"the government of General Motors,
by Exxon and for Dupont," consumer
activist Ralph Nader told a capacity
Kresge Auditorium crowd yesterday.
Today, "the dominant institution
is the corporate institution," Nader
said.
He cited increasing corporate
power alongside decreasing corporate
accountability as a great danger to
the consumer.
Corporations today have all the
rights consumers have, and yet they
enjoy certain immunities, Nader said.
"It's hard to impose capital punish
ment on GM."
In addition, corporations continue
pushing for limited liabilities and

benefiting from the Reagan adminis
tration's "secrecy policies," which
reduce public pressure on regulation
agencies, he said.
Nader criticized the vastly in
creased number of corporate subsidy
programs that have been established
during the last 40 years, the growing
concentration of corporate power,
an expanding military-industrial com
plex. and new tax laws that encourage
rooagtfs Tlk "burden of taxation is
becoming more and more ... on non
corporate shoulders," he said.
Corporate poWer, though a key
issue in past elections, is not even an
issue in the upcoming presidential
campaign. Nader said. "The most im
portant issues are the most taboo."
For Nader, corporate crime is
among the most important issues.
"All of (the candidates) seem to

have opinions on crime in the streets, ]
but none of them have opinions on
crime in the suites," he said.
Nader said corporate crime is not
studied enough, adding that the
Justice Department collects inade
quate data.
Various types of corporate crime
are hound to becomc institutional
ized, he said, and technology furthers
; this process. For instance, many salet
s are measured by meters which are vir
- tually impossible to verify.
Nader also discussed undergradu
/ ate education. He argued thai
i education was "not empirical
enough." Because students at top
universities tend to have an
"inheritable complacency," it is ben
eficial for students to "get out" and
"see a slice of life."
Nader said law schools underem-

phasize the study of corporate crime,
and medical schools wrongly value
nutrition "below dermatology."
Noting that he had seen no stu
dent analyses of tuition increases at
any lop schools, he remarked, "Is
that being a good consumer?"
One member of the audience told
Nader, "Vd like to see v ou run tor
s president."
:s "I thought you were nvy friend,'
r- he retorted.
Nader offered some advice to the
j- students. "Drop all the corporate
it blinders and just ask questions." hel
I said. "Give yourself a chance to
3 break out of the mold." t
) The free public talk was sponsored
by the ASSU Speakers Bureau, the
Stanford Law Forum and Stanford
in-Government.
