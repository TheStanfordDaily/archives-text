# Wildcats next for hoop crew
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Arizona Basketball Coach
Lute Olsen must love chal
lenges and warm weather. If
not, he was crazy to change
jobs last spring.
Olsen left lowa and its
cold winters last year for
Arizona and its balmy
Decembers and Januarys.
But in a trade-off for snow
less winters, Olsen left a
basketball program of na
tional prominence and got
one of national ridicule.
Arizona, which hosts
Stanford tomorrow in
McKale Center at 7:30 p.m.
(6:30 PST). has kept the
Cardinal company in the
Pacific-10 Conference cellar
for the past few years. But
Stanford's victory over
Arizona State last night,
which improved its confer
ence record to 3-6, left
Arizona in solitary confine
ment where the Wildcats
spent the entire 1982-K3
campaign.
Under first-year Coach
Ben Lindsey, the Wildcats
were a miserable 4-24 over
all and 1-17 in the Pac-10
last year. Lindsey, as you
might imagine, was sent
packing before the season
even ended, creating the va
cancy that Olsen filled.
This year Arizona â€” 5-12
overall and 2-5 in league
play -- may still be the
doormat of the competitive
Pac-10, but the Wildcats
certainly aren't stepped on
in the 14,341-seat McKale
Center.
Just ask UC-Berkeley
Coach Dick Kuchen, whose
Cal Bears lost a 56-50 deci
sion there last night. Or
Bob Weinhaucr, whose

Arizona State Sun Devils
were blown out by the
Wildcats, 71-49, two weeks
ago in McKale Center.
Arizona has also had a
number of close-but-no
cigar losses in Tuscon. The
Wildcats lost to UCLA by
three (61-58), league
leading Washington by two
(55-53) and Washington
State by two (61-59), all at
McKale.

Although the Wildcats
may play better at home,
they don't get any taller in
McKale. Arizona, with the
possible exception of Cal, is
the shortest team in the
Pac-10 with no starter over
6-foot-7 and three under 6-
5.
The Cats, however, are
quick. "Arizona is so quick
inside," said Oregon Coach
Don Monson, whose Ducks
blew open a close game in

the second half to defeat
the Wildcats 69-55 last
week. "We tried to match
up with them inside, but we
couldn't find anybody to
match up with.'"
Olsen is hoping to use
that quickness to beat the
Stanford full-court press
that has given teams fits all
season.
"This will definitely be an
uptempo game," he said of
tomorrow night's contest
with the Card. "The key will
be how we handle their full
court press and use good
judgment. Stanford has
played well all through the
season, but they had trouble
getting over the hump in
league play (with close
losses). The two wins over
the Washington teams last
week have to give them con
fidence."
Junior center Pete Wil
liams leads Arizona in both
scoring and rebounding,
averaging 14.6 points and a
Pac- 10-leading 10.7 boards
per game. Junior forward
Eddie Smith is the only
other Wildcat averaging
double figures, he is scoring
at a 13.6 clip. Junior Brock
Brunkhorst, sophomore
David Haskin and freshman
Michael Tait round out the
starting lineup.
Arizona leads the series
against Stanford, 12-9, and
won the last meeting be
tween the two schools, 74-
73, in Tucson. The Card did
beat the Wildcats, 86-69, at
Maples Pavilion earlier last
season.
The game will be carried
live on radio by KSFO (560
AM) and KZSU (90.1 FM)
beginning at 6:30 p.m. Stan
ford time tomorrow.
