# Hoopsters burned by Sun Devils
## Women lose again... 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
Tempe, Ariz. — It's been a
disappointing season for the
Stanford women's basketball
team and things didn't get any
better against the Arizona
State Sun Devils last night.
ASU used a quick pressure
defense to bother the Cardinal
as the Sun Devils won the
game, 83-71.
The loss dropped the Car
dinal to 3-17, 0-6 in the
WCAA Conference, while
ASU improved its record to
13-6, 2-3 in conference play.
"I think the Arizona press
bothered us," Stanford Coach
Dotty McCrea said after the
game. "We aren't a very quick
team."
Another problem, according
to McCrea was Stanford's free
throw shooting. The Cardinal
missed countless one-and-one
opportunities and only shot 54
percent from the line in the
first half.
"Our free throw shooting
was atrocious," McCrea said.
"We have to make these one
and-ones if we are going to be
competitive."
Sophomore guard Virginia
Sourlis led all Stanford scorers
with 19 points. Center Sarah
Evans followed with 16 points
on the evening while adding a
team-high 10 rebounds.
ASU guard Jodi Rathbun led
the scoring for the Sun Devils
with 19 points, but the real
problem, according to McCrea,
was the way that Stanford
handled ASU center Kim

Hampton, who had 18 points
and a game-high 13 rebounds.
"On the defensive end, we
allowed them to take the

second shot," McCrea said.
"Hampton got a lot of offen
sive rebounds, and that really
hurt us."
