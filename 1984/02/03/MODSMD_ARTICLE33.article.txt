# Matmen grapple at Biola
## 
### PETER CASTILLO 
In preparation for the Pac-10 championships,
the Stanford wrestling team travels to South
ern California to face Northern Arizona Univer
sity and Pac-10 powerhouse Arizona State
tonight in a dual meet.
After the meet, the Cardinal will remain in La
Mirada to compete in the Biola Invitational,
featuring California's best teams plus Notre
Dame and the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.
Stanford Wrestling Coach Chris Horpel
said."Right now the team is entering the home
stretch and we have to switch gears since the
Pac-10 championships is only four weeks away.
This will be a tough tournament, but I hope that
we can finish in the top seven plus I expect us to
beat NAU."
"Unfortunately we will not take a
heavyweight since Ed Katz is still injured and
Flint Pulskamp reaggravated his hip injury last
weekend," he said.

One athlete who is expected to win this
weekend is Jeff Wilson (177 pounds), who has
lost only two dual meet matches and placed
second last week at the "All-Cal" Invitational.
Another wrestler who could surprise some people
is Neil Wartnick (126 pounds). In the past two
weeks Wartnick has looked stronger in each
match and he placed fourth in last week's tourn
ament.
Scott Wiggen has been the best wrestler for
the Cardinal since returning to the line-up at
the beginning of the year and last week won the
150-pound competition. Like Wartnick, Wiggen
has become stronger as the season has progressed
and this can be credited to two daily workouts
that Horpel and his assistants implemented
three weeks ago.
The next weeks for the Cardinal will be cru
cial, for it still needs to show more improvement
if it hopes to do well in the Pac-10 champion
ships and to place wrestlers for the NCAA.
