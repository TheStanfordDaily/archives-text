# Aqua Card fires up for top contenders this weekend
## 
### LARRY GREEN Daily staff 
Both the men's and women's
swim teams head into the first
weekend of February ranked
first in the nation. The men's
team swims in two meets,
against rivals USC today and
UCLA tomorrow. The women
take on the Texas Longhorns
tomorrow at DeGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal men's team is
coming off of a major victory
at the Dallas Morning News
Classic. The Card won the meet
over top powers SMU, Arizona
State, Texas, Alabama and
UCLA.
The Card meets the Trojans
today. "I think we can beat
USC," men's Coach Skip Ken
ney said. There's only one fac
tor going against Stanford:
USC has lost three dual meets
in the last 25 years at home.
The meet will take place at
the new Olympic Pool. "Some
of the guys are real fired up
about that," Kenney said. "I'm
swimming everybody in their
secondary events. I want to
take pressure off for the
UCLA meet the next day." If
USC provides more than the
expected competition Kenney
said he might switch to a
"stronger line-up."

Kenney and his team are
really looking ahead to UCLA.
He said, "UCLA's whole season
has been geared towards

beating us. They're the tough
est competition we'll meet.
This is a conference meet and
there's a rivalry here, even he

tween the coaches."
UCLA's coach, Ron Bal
latore, has never seen his team
lose a dual meet at home since

he took over two years ago.
Kenney sees this as an in
centive for his team. "We want
to break that streak, unless Cal

(UC-Berkeley) beats them on
Friday."
"We measure up pretty well,
event for event," Kenney said.

"1 think UCLA is probably one
of the best dual meet teams in
the country." II" the meet goes
as expected, which is very close,
Kenney said, "One of the keys
may be the diving."
The women's team, whose
only dual meet loss of last
season was to the same Texas
Longhorns, is looking beyond
tomorrow's contest. "This isn't
the most important meet of
the year," Haines said. "We're
looking towards the NCAAs
first of all."
Texas is currently ranked
third in the nation. But Haines
said he doesn't weigh rankings
heavily when evaluating an op
ponent. "This will probably be
the number one dual meet of
the year," he said.
"Every event will be really
competitive," he said. "We
stack up real well, but we may
be better in the 200-back and
the 400 IM."
"We just want to improve
with each meet," Haines said.
The Cardinal swimmers are
coming off major victories
against UCLA, Cal State Long
Beach and a strong USC squad.


Stanford men and women swimmers face top powers this weekend. Pablo
Morales (above) and the rest of the men's team look forward to a big meet on

Mike Saathoff/Daily
tomorrow against UCLA. The women meet up with Texas tomorrow
at DeGuerre Pool.
