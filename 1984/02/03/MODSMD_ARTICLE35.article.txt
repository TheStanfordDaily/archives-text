# Card diamondmen meet No. 7-ranked Cal State Fullerton
## 
### ROBZWEIG 
After cruising to four easy wins over Nor
thern California opponents, Stanford's
sixth-Tanked baseball team will need to shift
into high gear this weekend when two
Southern California powers invade the
Sunken Diamond.
Stanford ran its record to 4-0 by toying
with USF and Stanislaus State, but a three
game weekend set with No. 7 Cal State
Fullerton and a Monday afternoon contest
with Fresno State should be a little more
challenging for the Cardinal. At least Head
Coach Mark Marquess thinks so.
"Both of these teams have always had
good programs," Marquess said yesterday.
"Both teams are real tough and they come
about as close as we can get to the teams in
our league."

Although Fullerton is a member of the
Southern California Baseball Conference
and not the Pacific-10, it has not suffered
from a lack of national success on the ball
diamond. Last year, "a down year for them,"
according to the Stanford skipper, the
Titans landed a berth in the NCAA Western
regional before being eliminated by Arizona
State.
This year Fullerton is back at full
strength, as indicated by their pre-season
ranking. If past Titan clubs are any indica
tion, Cardinal fans will be treated to an old
fashioned, drag-out clash between two
teams that play with intensity.
"They are a very well-coached team."
remarked Marquess,"They try to hit and run
or run and hit. They'll try to steal third or
home on you. They just do a lot of things to

try to shake you up and rattle you. And they
play good defense and have good pitching.
They're a lot like us."
In fact, the Cardinal will counter with the
same type of attack. To begin with that
means good pitching.
A series of right-handers, all 1-0 on the
year, will start for Stanford against both op
ponents. Seniors Brian Myers, John Radtke
and Steve Cottrell will face the Titans.
Sophomore Kevin Kunkel will start against
the Fresno State Bulldogs.
"This will be a good four games for our
pitching staff," said Marquess. "We'll get a
good indication of who will be able to do the
job for us."
While the veteran pitching staff has lived
up to its pre-season billing thus far, the hill
toppers have also been backed by a stingy.

and at times spectacular, defense led by
shortstop John Verducci. The Card's
manager also noted that the return of senior
Darryl Stephens to center field has given the
Card an even stronger defensive outfield and
another potent bat in the lineup.
Ah yes, the offense. When the Cardinal
has reached base it has been very adept at
producing runs. Marquess' greyhounds, led by-
Pete Stanicek and Mark Davis with four and
three steals respectively, have been off and
running. Even ex-catcher Rick Lundblade has
swiped a pair of bases.
But the Card has not exactly pounded the
ball. Stanford collected 20 hits in three
games against a suspect USF pitching staff
and nine safeties against Stanislaus. The
problem is that, besides an inside-the-park
home run by Davis, the longball has been

noticeably absent from the Cardinal attack.
"Even last year at this time we weren't
hitting well," noted a patient Marquess.
"We're going to try to get some more of
fense (this weekend)."
One team who will remember the Car
dinal's past power hitters is Fresno State. A
year ago, a highly touted Bulldog squad made
a one-game stop in Palo Alto and nearly left
shell-shocked before mounting a late rally in
a 9-8 loss to the Cardinal.
This year Fresno has traded its powerful
offense for two of the West's top pitchers,
including John Hoover.
Today's opener against Fullerton begins at;
2 p.m. while each contest tomorrow and
Sunday starts at 1 p.m. Stanford and Fresno
will hook up at 2 p.m. on Monday afternoon.
