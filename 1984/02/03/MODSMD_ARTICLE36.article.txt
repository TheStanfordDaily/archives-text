# Tennis: from shack to chic
## 
### ROBERT KEELEY 
A dilapidated shack.
J That's what the top
caliber varsity tennis pro
gram here used as its
courtside facility.
And it just wouldn't do.
So last year a clubhouse
worthy of Stanford's win
ning tradition was finally
built.
Senior Michelle Weiss, a
member of the women's
tennis team here, summed
up the general attitude of
the team. "I was amazed at
how great it was," she said.
"It is a statement of how
far the program has
progressed."
The story behind the club
is short. In September 19X2,
men's tennis Coach Dick
Gould and women's Coach
Frank Brennan, along with
Associate Athletic Director
Alan Cummings, proposed a
"tennis facility improve
ment."
Within a couple months
the University granted per
mission to build a new
practice court and club
house on one condition: The
tennis teams had to com
plete the project without
University funds.
Brennan was not upset by
the funding stipulation.
"The Athletic Department
has a policy not to give
money for new facilities,"
he said. "Considering the
department's financial
status, it couldn't possiblv
fund a new building."
He continued, " There was
never a question of them
giving us the money, but
simply the problem of them
giving permission to go
ahead with the project."
Gould explained Stan
ford's solution to the dilem
ma. "One family and
another individual close to
the Stanford tennis pro
gram stepped in to help in a
major way and picked up the
cost of the clubhouse and
new court,"he said. "The
tennis program raised
money itself to furnish the
clubhouse. The final bill
totalled over $300,000."
On Sept. 18, 1983 — ex
actly erne year after the ini
tial proposal was made —
the Department of Ath
letics here dedicated the

fin ished clubhouse and
practice court.
Since its opening, a num
ber of organizations and
people have discovered the
clubhouse as a prime loca
tion for various functions.
The lecture hall, with room
for 50, was used for fresh
man orientation, and more
recently as a reception hall
for football recruitment.
The modern lecture
hall/press room on the first
floor is dedicated to success.
Facing the central podium is

an array of 50 seats. On
each side of the podium
stands a display case,
featuring a total of nine
NCAA championship
trophies, and a collection of
second- and third-place
trophies.
"We designed the room
with the intention that it
represent nothing but na
tional championships,"
Gould said.
Behind the podium a
panel slides back to reveal a
large-screen TV. The soon
to-be-released "Stanford
Tennis Movie," directed by
communications major Lisa
Citroen, will appear on
screen for the public after
every match this season. A
mural on the back wall
shows past Stanford tennis
champions.

I he second floor includes
the offices of Gould and
Brennan and a porch over
looking the tournament
courts. The lounge adjoining
the offices doubles as a
players' meeting room and
social area.
Mounted on the walls are
a variety of prominent mag
azine covers picturing Stan
ford tennis players. Recent
tennis publications and
tournament information
are also located in the
lounge.

Gould is delighted with
the new clubhouse. "If we
had to build it again, I
wouldn't change a thing,"
he said.
One cabinet in the second
floor conference room con
tains the team's audio and
visual equipment. The
stereo, which can operate
inside or outside the build
ing, doubles as a public an
nouncer's system for
matches and as a source of
music. The video camera is
used to videotape matches
for further analysis on the
tennis computer.
When Gould came here in
1967 the tennis coach did
not even have an office. He
renovated a tiny storage
building which was to serve
as office space for two
coaches and as a locker room

for the team until 1983.
"The new office situation
is infinitely better." Bren
nan said. "The new club
house is much more
efficient. In the shack we
had ants crawling
everywhere and water under
the floor. The shack was
bitter cold in the winter and
unbearably hot in the sum
mer."
Brennan said that the
new tennis facilities would
help somewhat in the
recruitment of top high

school players.
"With UCLA getting
new facilities for the Olym
pics, and other schools
building similar complexes,
the recruitment of high
school players is growing in
tense," Brennan said. "It is
going to help us continue to
attract the top players to
our program."
Besides helping to con
vince promising high school
tennis players to attend
Stanford, Weiss believes the
new court and clubhouse will
strengthen a winning morale
on future teams. "We feel
kind of like we have our own
stadium to play in," she
said. "The building is a com
ment on how much the Ath
letic Department supports
the team."

recruitment of top high

school players.
"With UCLA getting
new facilities for the Olym
pics, and other schools
building similar complexes,
the recruitment of high
school players is growing in
tense," Brennan said. "It is
going to help us continue to
attract the top players to
our program."
Besides helping to con
vince promising high school
tennis players to attend
Stanford, Weiss believes the
new court and clubhouse will
strengthen a winning morale
on future teams. "We feel
kind of like we have our own
stadium to play in," she
said. "The building is a com
ment on how much the Ath
letic Department supports
the team."

Last September the tennis teams here began to use this new, luxurious tennis shack
It replaced the inadequate facility formerly on the premises.
A dilapidated shack.
J That's what the top
caliber varsity tennis pro
gram here used as its
courtside facility.
And it just wouldn't do.
So last year a clubhouse
worthy of Stanford's win
ning tradition was finally
built.
Senior Michelle Weiss, a
member of the women's
tennis team here, summed
up the general attitude of
the team. "I was amazed at
how great it was," she said.
"It is a statement of how
far the program has
progressed."
The story behind the club
is short. In September 19X2,
men's tennis Coach Dick
Gould and women's Coach
Frank Brennan, along with
Associate Athletic Director
Alan Cummings, proposed a
"tennis facility improve
ment."
Within a couple months
the University granted per
mission to build a new
practice court and club
house on one condition: The
tennis teams had to com
plete the project without
University funds.
Brennan was not upset by
the funding stipulation.
"The Athletic Department
has a policy not to give
money for new facilities,"
he said. "Considering the
department's financial
status, it couldn't possiblv
fund a new building."
He continued, " There was
never a question of them
giving us the money, but
simply the problem of them
giving permission to go
ahead with the project."
Gould explained Stan
ford's solution to the dilem
ma. "One family and
another individual close to
the Stanford tennis pro
gram stepped in to help in a
major way and picked up the
cost of the clubhouse and
new court,"he said. "The
tennis program raised
money itself to furnish the
clubhouse. The final bill
totalled over $300,000."
On Sept. 18, 1983 — ex
actly erne year after the ini
tial proposal was made —
the Department of Ath
letics here dedicated the

fin ished clubhouse and
practice court.
Since its opening, a num
ber of organizations and
people have discovered the
clubhouse as a prime loca
tion for various functions.
The lecture hall, with room
for 50, was used for fresh
man orientation, and more
recently as a reception hall
for football recruitment.
The modern lecture
hall/press room on the first
floor is dedicated to success.
Facing the central podium is

an array of 50 seats. On
each side of the podium
stands a display case,
featuring a total of nine
NCAA championship
trophies, and a collection of
second- and third-place
trophies.
"We designed the room
with the intention that it
represent nothing but na
tional championships,"
Gould said.
Behind the podium a
panel slides back to reveal a
large-screen TV. The soon
to-be-released "Stanford
Tennis Movie," directed by
communications major Lisa
Citroen, will appear on
screen for the public after
every match this season. A
mural on the back wall
shows past Stanford tennis
champions.

I he second floor includes
the offices of Gould and
Brennan and a porch over
looking the tournament
courts. The lounge adjoining
the offices doubles as a
players' meeting room and
social area.
Mounted on the walls are
a variety of prominent mag
azine covers picturing Stan
ford tennis players. Recent
tennis publications and
tournament information
are also located in the
lounge.

Gould is delighted with
the new clubhouse. "If we
had to build it again, I
wouldn't change a thing,"
he said.
One cabinet in the second
floor conference room con
tains the team's audio and
visual equipment. The
stereo, which can operate
inside or outside the build
ing, doubles as a public an
nouncer's system for
matches and as a source of
music. The video camera is
used to videotape matches
for further analysis on the
tennis computer.
When Gould came here in
1967 the tennis coach did
not even have an office. He
renovated a tiny storage
building which was to serve
as office space for two
coaches and as a locker room

for the team until 1983.
"The new office situation
is infinitely better." Bren
nan said. "The new club
house is much more
efficient. In the shack we
had ants crawling
everywhere and water under
the floor. The shack was
bitter cold in the winter and
unbearably hot in the sum
mer."
Brennan said that the
new tennis facilities would
help somewhat in the
recruitment of top high

school players.
"With UCLA getting
new facilities for the Olym
pics, and other schools
building similar complexes,
the recruitment of high
school players is growing in
tense," Brennan said. "It is
going to help us continue to
attract the top players to
our program."
Besides helping to con
vince promising high school
tennis players to attend
Stanford, Weiss believes the
new court and clubhouse will
strengthen a winning morale
on future teams. "We feel
kind of like we have our own
stadium to play in," she
said. "The building is a com
ment on how much the Ath
letic Department supports
the team."
