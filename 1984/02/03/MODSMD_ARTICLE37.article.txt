Team captain senior Cathy
Correa. fencing with a recur
ring wrist injury, still managed
to go undefeated with I I vic
tories, Senior Pam Henck, re
turning to the lineup for the
first time this season, regis
tered a solid 15-1 mark, while
top fencer Jennifer Yu was 13-
1. Freshman Holly Taylor had
her best day so far with 14 vic
tories and one defeat.
"This is a great team," said
head coach Buzz Hurst, "but I
was concerned about fencing
for six hours straight at 7000
feet up. We've been condition
ing for this meet, but 1 had no

way of knowing if it had been
enough until the time came.
All our opponents were ac
customed to that environ
ment. but as it turned out, we
and Air Force were the only
teams still going strong at the
end of the day."
One element in that
strength, according to Hurst, is
the depth of the squad. "Our
starters performed so well, and
our reserves (Gretchen Rohrer
and Megan Levi tan) are so
strong, that we were able to
substitute freely and pace
everyone."
The Card women are well on
their way to setting a season
scoring record, said Hurst.
Thev have now won 15N bouts
and lost only IS for a winning
percentage of K9.7 percent and
a dual meet record of 1 1-0.
The men's team had little
trouble with three of their op
ponents, beating BYU 22-5,
Colorado 18-9 and St. John's
21-6, but they lost to Air
Force 16-11.
"We fought hard," said

Hurst, "but they were a
stronger, more experienced
squad. I feel our men fenced up
to their level and have nothing
to feel disappointed about."
He continued. "Besides, our
epee team defeated them 5-4
and can lay claim to being the
strongest in the nation. Also,
our (No.) 2 foilist Elliott
Cheu, and No. 2 sabreman,
Andy Goorno. both went 3-0
against them." The men's
season record is now 9-2.
Both teams will be at home
for the first time in 19K4 this
Saturday against UC-Santa
Cruz. The meet will begin at I
p.m. in Roble Gymnasium.
Saturday's match will be a
return affair. In their first
encounter, the men defeated
UCSC 15-12 while the Cardinal
women scored a 15-1 decision.
"We're looking forward to a
tough match against Santa
Cruz," said Hurst. "The Santa
Cruz Coach Delmar Calvert
brought with him a tough and,
experienced team last time,
which gave us a surprise."
