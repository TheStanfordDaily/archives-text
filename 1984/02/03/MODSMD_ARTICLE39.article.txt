When I handed the manager my Daily
restaurant review card, thinking "OK, big
guy. dinner's on you." he muttered some
what accusingly, "I waited for you to show
up all night last night."
I guess all the college types who ate
there the night before received the quality
service and delicious food he'd planned just
for me.
Not that Lyon's in Los Altos is a bad
late night restaurant. It's open 24 hours
and has a lot more selection than Dominos.
At 4 in the morning it may be unsurpassed.
It beats Denny's by a long shot.
For midnight ambiance, the multi-tiered
noveau-medieval chandelier add a nice
dense touch to the brown Naugahyde

booths and orange and brown print
waitress uniforms. The decor is familiar to
anyone who has eaten in a Lyon's in
Portland or Bakersfield or anywhere in be
tween.
The colorful brown and orange
laminated menu offers everything from
Lyonburgers to Souped-up Sandwiches (or
Saladed-up if you prefer). We went for
the faddish potato skins, the Mighty Lyon
burger and the French Toast a la Lyon's.
For $3.25, the bacon potato skins were
great. Four potato halves were cleverly ar
ranged around a bowl of sour cream and
chives and covered with melted cheese and
bacon.
Unfortunately, the burger and the
trench toast tasted a lot alike. Take away
the syrup and it's all about the same. The
burger did come on a french roll, but the
cook torgot to spread on any thousand is
land dressing.

Coffee, the crucial late night item, was
made by MJB. At 55 cents, it was steamy
and free-flowing. There was plenty of
Sweet'n' Low. sugar and half-and-half con
veniently placed on each table. Caffeine,
at least, was no problem.
The french fries were fat and sluggish,
the dinner salad was mostly dressing with a
little lettuce for flavor and the onion rings
were the unimpressive, reconstituted
frozen kind.
We didn't get to try the dessert cart or
any of the other "sweat treats' because,
much to our dismay, our waitress finished
her shift and got to leave before we did.
Overall, Lyon's cannot be faulted for
what it is. It remains an ideal setting for a
carbo-loaded study break at 1 a.m. You
can't look tor the quality of Maxim's at a
place that serves a dinner special of liver
and onions.
