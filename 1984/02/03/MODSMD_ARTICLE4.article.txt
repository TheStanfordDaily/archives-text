The chocolate wars may be over, but observers here are
still debating whether the armistice signals victory or
defeat. . , n
Last Wednesday, the International Nestle Boycott
Committee rescinded the six-year-long boycott on
Nestle products which reportedly cost Nestle over $40
million.
The lift on the boycott came about when Nestle
agreed to comply with World Health Organization s In
fant marketing code.
Nestle's boycotters now seem most willing to turn
their candy bar swords into plowshares; boycott leaders
and Nestle officials celebrated the agreement by un
wrapping and tapping together Nestle's Crunch candy
bars, one of the items hit hardest by the boycott.
Six years ago. some churches and civic groups concluded
that Nestle was in the midst of a high-powered market
ing campaign to sell infant formula -in underdeveloped
countries, either not realizing or not really caring that
such a campaign would make third-world mothers aban
don breast-feeding for the less sanitary infant formula
- an often fatal substitution. Outraged, these groups
formed the Infant Formula Action Coalition and the
'acco■ rding"t o Hoover Research Fellow Kingsley Davis,
the infant mortality rate did not rise during the boycott
neriod but the Nestle effect was counteracted some
what bv advances in infant medical care. He said the use
of infant formula in underdeveloped
had some effect" on the infant mortality rate, during

that time about 10 percent of all infants born in third
world nations died within their first year.
As to the exact number of children killed by the for
mula. Davis said he "wouldn't hazard a guess.
"There's a tendency in social movements to
propagandize, and it's hard to get tigures straight,
Davis said. He added that he felt Nestles decision to
comply with the World Health Organization was
"wonderful," but there is still a need to further educate
third-world women about the dangers of infant formula.
At Stanford, there was never an organized faction of
the Nestle boycott, but the dilemma did manage to in
spire a work of art. The Stanford Gallery last year
featured a piece titled "Quick Action" by Alec
MacLeod, which captured the artist's reaction to the
Nestle boycott.
Macleod took seven cans of Nestle's Quick oft the
shelves of grocery stores, consumed the Quick, and tilled
the cans with small baby dolls painted brown. He
replaced the traditional Nestle label with one that
looked almost identical, but instead of the ingredients it
sported anti-Nestle propaganda. Inside the can was a
leaflet about the project containing MacLeod's address
and phone number.
MacLeod said he didn't like to explain the motivation
for a particular piece, because explanations otten seem
too simplistic, but he did say that the project was a way
for MacLeod, who had "boycotted like any good liberal,
to indulge in his favorite Nestle product.
•T guess one of the reasons I did it was to drink
Quick.'" he said, "and to try to balance out my action by
informing the public about the boycott.
