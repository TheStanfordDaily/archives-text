We'd leave earn pus late at
night, starving alter >ct an
otlici had I ood Service meal,
and dt i\ e down I I ('amino.
After a couple trips, we
realized our choices were lim
ited Jack in the Bon closes
at 2 a.m. Ilicn there was
Denm's and I urn's.
Wc alwa\s went to I yon s. I
don't know win I guess its an
OK place I \eept foi slow ser
mcc. high prices and just plain
had food.
So we stopped short ot
lyon's one night recently to
cat .it Dcnn\ v It was a pleas
ant Mil pi ISC.
I)cnn\ s doesn t sutler troni
the pretentions that make
1 \ on's so pathetic. Denny's is a
coffee shop, and Denny's
knows it Where I.von s may
offer Naugahyde chairs and
clunky chandeliers. Denny's has
linoleum floors and bright plas
tic dinettes. And that's the
way a coffee shop should be.
The food is like a coffee

shop's should be. too. A per
iod example is Denny's pattv
melt sandwich. Let's do the old
Jack in the Box comparison
test with Lyon's and Denny's
patty melts going head to
head.
I \oil's patty melt is about
50 cents more expensive than
Denny's. Lyon's serves its ver
sion open-faced on something
like Oroweat rye bread with a
pickle and tomato for garnish.
It comes with a salad, thick
trench fries, and. of course, the
übiquitous piece of fruit that
makes every Lyon's meal some
thing special.
Denny's version is served just
like a patty melt should he
served — closed-face, sliced in
half diagonally, with lots of
onions. It conies with trench
fries — the thin greasy kind
that you expect to get with a
patty melt. You don't get a
salad. You don't get a pickle or
a tomato. And you don't get a
piece of fruit. You get a good
patty melt sandwich, and
that s why you go to a late
night place anyway, isn't it?
Denny's breakfasts are also
better than Lyon's — and a lot
cheaper. You can cash in on
Denny's Grand Slam Breakfast

for A complete break
fast for about two bucks
you can't argue with that.
I he service is another big
plus for Denny's. With a few
very notable exceptions. Lyon's
service is slow and rude.
Denny s is a delight. Our
waitress — and they call them
"waitresses at Denny's, not
"servers' - — apologized all over
herself tor the slowness of the
cook — a speed which would
have been amazingly quick at
Lyon's. And what's more, she
gave us tree refills on hot choc
olate. That's above and beyond
the call ol cot tee shop duty .
But the best thing about
Denny s is the people. Gone are
the Paly High prima donnas and
New Wavers who hang out at
Lyon's, trying to look cooler
and older than they really are.
I he people at Denny's arc
real people. We sat next to a
young couple the other night
there. She wanted hot choco
late. He said "You really want
hot chocolate? With whipped
cream and everything?" She
nodded and smiled. You can't
argue with that.
