We had expected Fresco restau
rant to be a slightly upgraded cof
fee shop, but were surprised to
find a quality restaurant that at
tempts to offer the best of all
worlds and is actually successful.
The "California cafe" is essen
tially an eclectic blend of
European, Mexican and American
features and though some might
call it trendy, others will certainly
enjoy its innovations. Where else
could a couple dine at 10 p.m. and
order breakfast and gin and
tonics?
Walking into the restaurant, we
were struck by the gray and white
motif that is carried throughout
the booths, walls, floors and even
the server's attire. Fresco has
created a clean modern look that,
coupled with the soft jazz music
in the background, gives one a
vivid sense of living in the 1980s.
If you are indecisive, Fresco may
be a difficult place for you to eat.
One has a choice of sitting at the
counter, in the casual cafe section
or in the more formal mirrored
dining room. Or maybe you'd
rather just have a few drinks at
the full bar. No matter where you
sit, the entire menu is available
and also requires serious thought.

We ordered a beverage while we
deeided. The coffee was brought
immediately in a clear glass cup
and was refilled as soon as it was
emptied. If anything one felt hov
ered over, though since we were
there late at night we can't vouch
for the quickness during the lunch
rush. We did manage to order
drinks, appetizer, entrees and des
sert and were finished within an
hour — quite impressive.
We started off with a sliced
green apple and blue brie "crepe
quesadilla." This sophisticated
take-off on the apple and cheese
theme was great if you like brie

cheese since that was the domi
nant ingredient. At $3.75, it was
plenty for two. For true Califor
nians we'd suggest ordering white
wine by the glass to enjoy with
this appetizer.
We sampled two entrees, the
first being jalapeno fettuccine
with tomato, sour cream and
avocado which cost $5.50.
Definitely not for the timid
eater, this rich dish united Mexico
with Italy in California. There was
enough jalapeno to heat your
mouth but not enough to smother
the other flavors.

The second entree was an
avocado stuffed with shrimp, scal
lops and calamari with an olive oil
and mustard dressing. The high
light of the salad was the calamari
and the only criticism we had was
that the "tail" of the scallops was
left attached. This orange part of
the shellfish may he the delight of
some scallop eaters but we ended
up leaving them behind. The scal
lops had been frozen, though they
are reportedly one of the only
frozen items served at this restau
rant. After all, "fresco" means
fresh in Italian.
The portion of seafood was

more generous than usual and it
was arranged with lettuce,
tomatoes and olives so that it did
not look like a little avocado with
a few shrimp lying on the middle
of a plate, like the same dish
might look at some restaurants.
The dressing was delicious and
light enough so that it didn't
smother the other ingredients.
Though stuffed after the meal,
we felt it our duty to sample des
sert. We tried the chocolate
strada pie, which was a layer of
chocolate mousse, whipped cream,
meringue and chocolate shavings.

Perfect for those trying to put on
a little weight, this dessert offers
maximal calories with maximum
enjoyment.
Our entire meal for
two—including beer—came to
about $20 and we felt that we
had a quality meal for the money.
One could easily spend much less
here for a light meal.
We decided that this would be
the perfect place for groups who
can never reach a consensus 011
where to eat. If things get really
bad parties can break up and eat in
different sections.
The biggest handicap Fresco
must overcome is its grungy ex
terior. It moved into what was
formerly Stickney's coffee shop in
November but still has a tempo
rary sign taped to the old one with
the word "Flamingo" glaring on
the bottom. The old canopy and
"Stickney's look" still remain —
though we've been assured that it
is being phased out. For those of
you who appreciate irony, perhaps
the ugly exterior in contrast with
the obvious attention to style
inside will add charm to Fresco. At
the very least this restaurant will
provide conversation.
Fresco is open from 6 a.m. until
1 1 p.m. on weekdays and from 7
a.m. until 11:30 p.m. on weekends.
