## Church of the Sub Genius stages theater of envy 
### SEAN SMITH 
Midway through the Ist Interna
tional Sub Genius World Revival
Crusade, two men with plastic ma
chine guns rushed onstage and
assumed Secret Service-type guard in
the wings. "The Pope of All New
York." the "Reverend" Doctor Doc
tor (Mr. M.D.) David Meyer
strode up to the podium. Dressed in a
cream-colored suit, his hair greased
hack, face inscrutable behind sun
glasses, David Meyer was the
epitome of slick evangelical preach
ing.
"Brothers and Sisters." he an
nounced over the roar of the
audience, "Do not push me. tor I am
close to the edge. Yes. I'm just trying
not to lose my head." Grandmaster
Flash meets Jimmy Lee Swaggart.
The Pope's sermon continued with
a recitation of the rules of the
Church of the Sub Genius, a strange
body of doctrine, to say the least:
"Too Much Is Always Better Than
Not Enough " "Pull the Wool Over
Your Own Eyes" and "II You See
Someone Driving A Porsche, He
Probably Doesn't Deserve It. I he
crowd played the revival meeting
trope to the hilt, an odd assortment
of aging hippies, punks and high
school kids, red-faced and con
stricted in their thrift-shop suits and
dresses. The audience clapped and
whistled energetically, yelling,
"SLACK," ' BOB." and "AMEN" at
the appropriate intervals.
"They liked it. huh?" the "Pope"
asked me hopefully afterward. "I've
done this show in New York and
other places. This audience seemed
very enthusiastic. But I couldn t real
ly tell if they were shouting with me
or at me." At some point in the eve
ning. that distinction became irrele
vant.
Characterized by violent collisions
of genre and imagery like the
"Pope's" rant, the Ist International
Sub Genius World Revival ( rusade
I 984: Night of Slack (Jan. 20 and
21 at the Victoria Theater, San l-ran
cisco), begs accurate description. It is
not enough to call it the roadshow ot
the mysterious Church of the Sub-

Genius, a pseudo-cult (or does it
qualify as a cult? Who can say?) ot
self-described "superior renegades"
based in Dallas. Adjectives such as
"amateurish" and "disorganized' are
also insufficient by themselves.
One searches for metaphors, tools
for understanding. The World
Revival Crusade was a strange syn
thesis of All-star Wrestling, the
Grand Guignol and a high school tal
ent show. Sitting through it. I
thought of a Cub Scout Den meeting
gone horribly awry, or an episode ot
"That Girl" run in rapid reverse. The
analogies are certainly in the nihilis
tic and ultimately futile spirit of the
thing.
The Church of the Sub Genius is a
forum for the stream-of
consciousness inanities ot a group ot
media children, all in their late 20s
and early 30s, raised on Captain
Crunch, Marvel Comics and like ep
hemerae. Not exactly brain food. I
had seen the Church's "bible." the
"Book of the Sub Genius". subtitled
"Lunatic Prophecies tor the Coming
Weird Times." Categorized as humor,
at least in bookshops, it nevertheless
contains the "Divine Wisdom, Guid
ance and Prophecy of JR. Bob
Dobbs," — "Bob" for short.
Briefly stated, the Church's tenets
proclaim the lack of all tenets, a
loose credo ot "Slack, cynicism and
sit-coni humor, in the tace of the so
called "Obstacle." the "Conspiracy
and its Dupes, the Normals," or just
"Them." The Church observes a
science-fiction millenarianism; the
"Book of the Sub Genius" is
"Revelations" as written by H.P.
Lovecraft. outlining the imminent
descent of the X-Men to Earth and
their "frying" of all the "normals
and pinks." By a convenient,
Jehovah's Witness twist of logic, only
the members of the Church of the
Sub Genius, those who have the all
important quality of Slack, will
survive to be carried off into space.
This apocalyptic future is foretold
amid pages of brilliant graphics,
Dada-esque collages of images culled
from 1950s and '60s advertising,
trash comic books, old post cards and

late night horror movie stills, as well
as deft hand drawings. And through
out. the gleaming grin ot Bob and his
pipe, grafted onto women's,
children's and pets' bodies, emerging
from a surreal cloud of images, litter
ing a page at random. His is the om
nipresent tace ot conventionality
gone astray, the '50s American
Dream of a pipe-smoking, crew-cut
father figure subtly twisted into
nightmare. "You'll Pay lo Know
What You Really Think." runs one ot
the church's maxims. Bob is the ul

timate salesman and this Church is
his grift, his l uller Brush bag ot
goods. Take it or leave it.
The humor of the Hook of the Sub-
Genius is absurd and fleeting, the
transient comic ettect derived troni
hyperbole and unusual juxtaposition.
Sent spinning into motion in the
World Revival Crusade: Night of
Slack, the weaknesses of the Sub-
Genius form of humor were bared:
visually intriguing, intellectually it
yields only nonsense. I he production
design was imaginative and well

executed. From the sacreligious
murals (two Bozo the Clown figures
;is the thieves on a surreal Golgotha)
to the plaster dinosaur skull and the
gigantic head of Bob (with pipe)
stitched out of foam rubber, eyes
blinking, pipe coals glowing, the props
and sets restated the visual strengths
of the Church's humor.
Yet. as in the "Book of the Sub-
Genius. the World Revival
Crusade's impressive visual effects
were wielded in support (defense?)
nl less-than-impressive content and,
in this case, acting. The Crusade's
loose approximation of a revival
meeting (an analogy observed in the
"sermons" of "Reverend Ivan
Stang. Pope Sterno Keckhaver, Doug
Smith and St Jaynor Hypercleats;
the singing of the "Left Coast
Zombies for 'Bob' Chorale;" and the
"HALLELUJAHS" and "AMENS"
of the supportive audience) grew
looser as the evening wore on.
One could almost hear a rush of
wind, a grinding of gears, as the
World Revival Crusade slid towards
its nadir, its finale. The giggling and
self-conscious "nurse" at the door
proffering — a la Jonestown — a
Solo cup of black cherry Kool-Aid
from a metal tub; the sophomoric
mugging and on-stage, private-joking
of the "Left Coast Zombies for
Bob' Chorale;" the finu destruction
of all artifice in the orgy of shouting,
gesticulating, singing and frenzied
guitar squeals of the Revival's close:
the World Revival Crusade was
crippled by bad acting and insipid,
repetitious material.
If it accomplished anything, the
High Church of Hype showed its soft
underbelly, its lack of commitment
to the very parody and contempt it
professes. In general, the Revival
Crusade was amateurish and
confused, ill-thought-out and badly
executed. Only the "rant" of David
Meyer and the surrealistic "tirade"
by San Francisco performance artist
Michael Peppi (aka Buba Free Pep In
nocence I) proved exceptions to this
grim rule.
Perhaps it can be argued that the
weaknesses of the World Revival
Crusade: Night of Slack, the failure
of most of the cast to take them
selves seriously, to have the courage
of their comic convictions, is the
final irony of the evening. After all,
what did I expect of the
"Sub Genii"—a polished, consistent
production? Perhaps.
Yet, backed into a corner, I can
only question the ultimate meaning
— let alone value — of a genre
judged by an aesthetic of deteriora

lion, collapse. It's far too con
venient. The failures of ihe evening,
the painful gaps between comic con
ception and flat realization, are not
inspired metaphors for contemporary
culture or the human condition, hut
the product of a lack of constructive
philosophy and talent. In the final
analysis, however, any debate con
cerning bad acting versus the
Church's doctrine of "Bull-Dada,"
noise versus "anti-music" is moot.
Something other than an abandoned
exploration of the limits of humor or
anti-art is operative here. The care
free, culturally synthetic stance of
the Church is belied by the brutal
fact ot its purposefulness. Unfor
tunately. these people are dead
serious.
"No. this is No joke. No parody,"
an unusually earnest section in the
"Book of the Sub Genius" reads:
Only the foulness of your program
ming keeps you from believing that we
have thousands of members, nation
wide revivals, radio shows, and so on.
But we do. . . . Not only are we not
kidding, but we'll even piss you off.
Indeed, that's our JOB - our CALL
ING - our MISSION. We're going to
shock the hell out of every man, wo
man and child on this planet. It's a big
job, and we have only until to do
it. Still, its time enough for the Church
to be infiltrated and made evil, if we
don't watch ourselves.
The object of this fear, this
paranoia? "The Church of the Sub-
Genius becoming POPULAR and
turning into one big CHEAP JOKE."
It is a justifiable concern about a
fate implicit in the very conception
of the Church and made explicit in
the World Revival Crusade.
But I was not shocked or pissed
off. I was bored, and the threat to
the Church is not an anonymous
"evil" but its own circularity of
thought, its railing against the very
qualities of conventionalism and suc
cess to which it aspires. Envy is the
one consistent element of Sub Genius
humor. The members of the Church
of the Sub Genius desperately seek to
propel themselves, via cynicism, into
the comfortable arms of the
"Conspiracy." They want to become
the "Bobs" of the 1980s.
The Church may indeed become
popular. Look at the Cabbage Patch
Doll. But this will be in spite of its
ulterior drive for success, a drive
which cuts the ground out from
beneath its sarcasm and shows it for
what it is: so much sour grapes and
sentiment. It will also be in spite of
debacles like the World Revival
Crusade.

beneath its sarcasm and shows it for
what it is: so much sour grapes and
sentiment. It will also be in spite of
debacles like the World Revival
Crusade.


Midway through the Ist Interna
tional Sub Genius World Revival
Crusade, two men with plastic ma
chine guns rushed onstage and
assumed Secret Service-type guard in
the wings. "The Pope of All New
York." the "Reverend" Doctor Doc
tor (Mr. M.D.) David Meyer
strode up to the podium. Dressed in a
cream-colored suit, his hair greased
hack, face inscrutable behind sun
glasses, David Meyer was the
epitome of slick evangelical preach
ing.
"Brothers and Sisters." he an
nounced over the roar of the
audience, "Do not push me. tor I am
close to the edge. Yes. I'm just trying
not to lose my head." Grandmaster
Flash meets Jimmy Lee Swaggart.
The Pope's sermon continued with
a recitation of the rules of the
Church of the Sub Genius, a strange
body of doctrine, to say the least:
"Too Much Is Always Better Than
Not Enough " "Pull the Wool Over
Your Own Eyes" and "II You See
Someone Driving A Porsche, He
Probably Doesn't Deserve It. I he
crowd played the revival meeting
trope to the hilt, an odd assortment
of aging hippies, punks and high
school kids, red-faced and con
stricted in their thrift-shop suits and
dresses. The audience clapped and
whistled energetically, yelling,
"SLACK," ' BOB." and "AMEN" at
the appropriate intervals.
"They liked it. huh?" the "Pope"
asked me hopefully afterward. "I've
done this show in New York and
other places. This audience seemed
very enthusiastic. But I couldn t real
ly tell if they were shouting with me
or at me." At some point in the eve
ning. that distinction became irrele
vant.
Characterized by violent collisions
of genre and imagery like the
"Pope's" rant, the Ist International
Sub Genius World Revival ( rusade
I 984: Night of Slack (Jan. 20 and
21 at the Victoria Theater, San l-ran
cisco), begs accurate description. It is
not enough to call it the roadshow ot
the mysterious Church of the Sub-

Genius, a pseudo-cult (or does it
qualify as a cult? Who can say?) ot
self-described "superior renegades"
based in Dallas. Adjectives such as
"amateurish" and "disorganized' are
also insufficient by themselves.
One searches for metaphors, tools
for understanding. The World
Revival Crusade was a strange syn
thesis of All-star Wrestling, the
Grand Guignol and a high school tal
ent show. Sitting through it. I
thought of a Cub Scout Den meeting
gone horribly awry, or an episode ot
"That Girl" run in rapid reverse. The
analogies are certainly in the nihilis
tic and ultimately futile spirit of the
thing.
The Church of the Sub Genius is a
forum for the stream-of
consciousness inanities ot a group ot
media children, all in their late 20s
and early 30s, raised on Captain
Crunch, Marvel Comics and like ep
hemerae. Not exactly brain food. I
had seen the Church's "bible." the
"Book of the Sub Genius". subtitled
"Lunatic Prophecies tor the Coming
Weird Times." Categorized as humor,
at least in bookshops, it nevertheless
contains the "Divine Wisdom, Guid
ance and Prophecy of JR. Bob
Dobbs," — "Bob" for short.
Briefly stated, the Church's tenets
proclaim the lack of all tenets, a
loose credo ot "Slack, cynicism and
sit-coni humor, in the tace of the so
called "Obstacle." the "Conspiracy
and its Dupes, the Normals," or just
"Them." The Church observes a
science-fiction millenarianism; the
"Book of the Sub Genius" is
"Revelations" as written by H.P.
Lovecraft. outlining the imminent
descent of the X-Men to Earth and
their "frying" of all the "normals
and pinks." By a convenient,
Jehovah's Witness twist of logic, only
the members of the Church of the
Sub Genius, those who have the all
important quality of Slack, will
survive to be carried off into space.
This apocalyptic future is foretold
amid pages of brilliant graphics,
Dada-esque collages of images culled
from 1950s and '60s advertising,
trash comic books, old post cards and

late night horror movie stills, as well
as deft hand drawings. And through
out. the gleaming grin ot Bob and his
pipe, grafted onto women's,
children's and pets' bodies, emerging
from a surreal cloud of images, litter
ing a page at random. His is the om
nipresent tace ot conventionality
gone astray, the '50s American
Dream of a pipe-smoking, crew-cut
father figure subtly twisted into
nightmare. "You'll Pay lo Know
What You Really Think." runs one ot
the church's maxims. Bob is the ul

timate salesman and this Church is
his grift, his l uller Brush bag ot
goods. Take it or leave it.
The humor of the Hook of the Sub-
Genius is absurd and fleeting, the
transient comic ettect derived troni
hyperbole and unusual juxtaposition.
Sent spinning into motion in the
World Revival Crusade: Night of
Slack, the weaknesses of the Sub-
Genius form of humor were bared:
visually intriguing, intellectually it
yields only nonsense. I he production
design was imaginative and well

executed. From the sacreligious
murals (two Bozo the Clown figures
;is the thieves on a surreal Golgotha)
to the plaster dinosaur skull and the
gigantic head of Bob (with pipe)
stitched out of foam rubber, eyes
blinking, pipe coals glowing, the props
and sets restated the visual strengths
of the Church's humor.
Yet. as in the "Book of the Sub-
Genius. the World Revival
Crusade's impressive visual effects
were wielded in support (defense?)
nl less-than-impressive content and,
in this case, acting. The Crusade's
loose approximation of a revival
meeting (an analogy observed in the
"sermons" of "Reverend Ivan
Stang. Pope Sterno Keckhaver, Doug
Smith and St Jaynor Hypercleats;
the singing of the "Left Coast
Zombies for 'Bob' Chorale;" and the
"HALLELUJAHS" and "AMENS"
of the supportive audience) grew
looser as the evening wore on.
One could almost hear a rush of
wind, a grinding of gears, as the
World Revival Crusade slid towards
its nadir, its finale. The giggling and
self-conscious "nurse" at the door
proffering — a la Jonestown — a
Solo cup of black cherry Kool-Aid
from a metal tub; the sophomoric
mugging and on-stage, private-joking
of the "Left Coast Zombies for
Bob' Chorale;" the finu destruction
of all artifice in the orgy of shouting,
gesticulating, singing and frenzied
guitar squeals of the Revival's close:
the World Revival Crusade was
crippled by bad acting and insipid,
repetitious material.
If it accomplished anything, the
High Church of Hype showed its soft
underbelly, its lack of commitment
to the very parody and contempt it
professes. In general, the Revival
Crusade was amateurish and
confused, ill-thought-out and badly
executed. Only the "rant" of David
Meyer and the surrealistic "tirade"
by San Francisco performance artist
Michael Peppi (aka Buba Free Pep In
nocence I) proved exceptions to this
grim rule.
Perhaps it can be argued that the
weaknesses of the World Revival
Crusade: Night of Slack, the failure
of most of the cast to take them
selves seriously, to have the courage
of their comic convictions, is the
final irony of the evening. After all,
what did I expect of the
"Sub Genii"—a polished, consistent
production? Perhaps.
Yet, backed into a corner, I can
only question the ultimate meaning
— let alone value — of a genre
judged by an aesthetic of deteriora

lion, collapse. It's far too con
venient. The failures of ihe evening,
the painful gaps between comic con
ception and flat realization, are not
inspired metaphors for contemporary
culture or the human condition, hut
the product of a lack of constructive
philosophy and talent. In the final
analysis, however, any debate con
cerning bad acting versus the
Church's doctrine of "Bull-Dada,"
noise versus "anti-music" is moot.
Something other than an abandoned
exploration of the limits of humor or
anti-art is operative here. The care
free, culturally synthetic stance of
the Church is belied by the brutal
fact ot its purposefulness. Unfor
tunately. these people are dead
serious.
"No. this is No joke. No parody,"
an unusually earnest section in the
"Book of the Sub Genius" reads:
Only the foulness of your program
ming keeps you from believing that we
have thousands of members, nation
wide revivals, radio shows, and so on.
But we do. . . . Not only are we not
kidding, but we'll even piss you off.
Indeed, that's our JOB - our CALL
ING - our MISSION. We're going to
shock the hell out of every man, wo
man and child on this planet. It's a big
job, and we have only until to do
it. Still, its time enough for the Church
to be infiltrated and made evil, if we
don't watch ourselves.
The object of this fear, this
paranoia? "The Church of the Sub-
Genius becoming POPULAR and
turning into one big CHEAP JOKE."
It is a justifiable concern about a
fate implicit in the very conception
of the Church and made explicit in
the World Revival Crusade.
But I was not shocked or pissed
off. I was bored, and the threat to
the Church is not an anonymous
"evil" but its own circularity of
thought, its railing against the very
qualities of conventionalism and suc
cess to which it aspires. Envy is the
one consistent element of Sub Genius
humor. The members of the Church
of the Sub Genius desperately seek to
propel themselves, via cynicism, into
the comfortable arms of the
"Conspiracy." They want to become
the "Bobs" of the 1980s.
The Church may indeed become
popular. Look at the Cabbage Patch
Doll. But this will be in spite of its
ulterior drive for success, a drive
which cuts the ground out from
beneath its sarcasm and shows it for
what it is: so much sour grapes and
sentiment. It will also be in spite of
debacles like the World Revival

popular. Look at the Cabbage Patch
Doll. But this will be in spite of its
ulterior drive for success, a drive
which cuts the ground out from
beneath its sarcasm and shows it for
what it is: so much sour grapes and
sentiment. It will also be in spite of
debacles like the World Revival
Crusade.


Midway through the Ist Interna
tional Sub Genius World Revival
Crusade, two men with plastic ma
chine guns rushed onstage and
assumed Secret Service-type guard in
the wings. "The Pope of All New
York." the "Reverend" Doctor Doc
tor (Mr. M.D.) David Meyer
strode up to the podium. Dressed in a
cream-colored suit, his hair greased
hack, face inscrutable behind sun
glasses, David Meyer was the
epitome of slick evangelical preach
ing.
"Brothers and Sisters." he an
nounced over the roar of the
audience, "Do not push me. tor I am
close to the edge. Yes. I'm just trying
not to lose my head." Grandmaster
Flash meets Jimmy Lee Swaggart.
The Pope's sermon continued with
a recitation of the rules of the
Church of the Sub Genius, a strange
body of doctrine, to say the least:
"Too Much Is Always Better Than
Not Enough " "Pull the Wool Over
Your Own Eyes" and "II You See
Someone Driving A Porsche, He
Probably Doesn't Deserve It. I he
crowd played the revival meeting
trope to the hilt, an odd assortment
of aging hippies, punks and high
school kids, red-faced and con
stricted in their thrift-shop suits and
dresses. The audience clapped and
whistled energetically, yelling,
"SLACK," ' BOB." and "AMEN" at
the appropriate intervals.
"They liked it. huh?" the "Pope"
asked me hopefully afterward. "I've
done this show in New York and
other places. This audience seemed
very enthusiastic. But I couldn t real
ly tell if they were shouting with me
or at me." At some point in the eve
ning. that distinction became irrele
vant.
Characterized by violent collisions
of genre and imagery like the
"Pope's" rant, the Ist International
Sub Genius World Revival ( rusade
I 984: Night of Slack (Jan. 20 and
21 at the Victoria Theater, San l-ran
cisco), begs accurate description. It is
not enough to call it the roadshow ot
the mysterious Church of the Sub-

Genius, a pseudo-cult (or does it
qualify as a cult? Who can say?) ot
self-described "superior renegades"
based in Dallas. Adjectives such as
"amateurish" and "disorganized' are
also insufficient by themselves.
One searches for metaphors, tools
for understanding. The World
Revival Crusade was a strange syn
thesis of All-star Wrestling, the
Grand Guignol and a high school tal
ent show. Sitting through it. I
thought of a Cub Scout Den meeting
gone horribly awry, or an episode ot
"That Girl" run in rapid reverse. The
analogies are certainly in the nihilis
tic and ultimately futile spirit of the
thing.
The Church of the Sub Genius is a
forum for the stream-of
consciousness inanities ot a group ot
media children, all in their late 20s
and early 30s, raised on Captain
Crunch, Marvel Comics and like ep
hemerae. Not exactly brain food. I
had seen the Church's "bible." the
"Book of the Sub Genius". subtitled
"Lunatic Prophecies tor the Coming
Weird Times." Categorized as humor,
at least in bookshops, it nevertheless
contains the "Divine Wisdom, Guid
ance and Prophecy of JR. Bob
Dobbs," — "Bob" for short.
Briefly stated, the Church's tenets
proclaim the lack of all tenets, a
loose credo ot "Slack, cynicism and
sit-coni humor, in the tace of the so
called "Obstacle." the "Conspiracy
and its Dupes, the Normals," or just
"Them." The Church observes a
science-fiction millenarianism; the
"Book of the Sub Genius" is
"Revelations" as written by H.P.
Lovecraft. outlining the imminent
descent of the X-Men to Earth and
their "frying" of all the "normals
and pinks." By a convenient,
Jehovah's Witness twist of logic, only
the members of the Church of the
Sub Genius, those who have the all
important quality of Slack, will
survive to be carried off into space.
This apocalyptic future is foretold
amid pages of brilliant graphics,
Dada-esque collages of images culled
from 1950s and '60s advertising,
trash comic books, old post cards and

late night horror movie stills, as well
as deft hand drawings. And through
out. the gleaming grin ot Bob and his
pipe, grafted onto women's,
children's and pets' bodies, emerging
from a surreal cloud of images, litter
ing a page at random. His is the om
nipresent tace ot conventionality
gone astray, the '50s American
Dream of a pipe-smoking, crew-cut
father figure subtly twisted into
nightmare. "You'll Pay lo Know
What You Really Think." runs one ot
the church's maxims. Bob is the ul

timate salesman and this Church is
his grift, his l uller Brush bag ot
goods. Take it or leave it.
The humor of the Hook of the Sub-
Genius is absurd and fleeting, the
transient comic ettect derived troni
hyperbole and unusual juxtaposition.
Sent spinning into motion in the
World Revival Crusade: Night of
Slack, the weaknesses of the Sub-
Genius form of humor were bared:
visually intriguing, intellectually it
yields only nonsense. I he production
design was imaginative and well

executed. From the sacreligious
murals (two Bozo the Clown figures
;is the thieves on a surreal Golgotha)
to the plaster dinosaur skull and the
gigantic head of Bob (with pipe)
stitched out of foam rubber, eyes
blinking, pipe coals glowing, the props
and sets restated the visual strengths
of the Church's humor.
Yet. as in the "Book of the Sub-
Genius. the World Revival
Crusade's impressive visual effects
were wielded in support (defense?)
nl less-than-impressive content and,
in this case, acting. The Crusade's
loose approximation of a revival
meeting (an analogy observed in the
"sermons" of "Reverend Ivan
Stang. Pope Sterno Keckhaver, Doug
Smith and St Jaynor Hypercleats;
the singing of the "Left Coast
Zombies for 'Bob' Chorale;" and the
"HALLELUJAHS" and "AMENS"
of the supportive audience) grew
looser as the evening wore on.
One could almost hear a rush of
wind, a grinding of gears, as the
World Revival Crusade slid towards
its nadir, its finale. The giggling and
self-conscious "nurse" at the door
proffering — a la Jonestown — a
Solo cup of black cherry Kool-Aid
from a metal tub; the sophomoric
mugging and on-stage, private-joking
of the "Left Coast Zombies for
Bob' Chorale;" the finu destruction
of all artifice in the orgy of shouting,
gesticulating, singing and frenzied
guitar squeals of the Revival's close:
the World Revival Crusade was
crippled by bad acting and insipid,
repetitious material.
If it accomplished anything, the
High Church of Hype showed its soft
underbelly, its lack of commitment
to the very parody and contempt it
professes. In general, the Revival
Crusade was amateurish and
confused, ill-thought-out and badly
executed. Only the "rant" of David
Meyer and the surrealistic "tirade"
by San Francisco performance artist
Michael Peppi (aka Buba Free Pep In
nocence I) proved exceptions to this
grim rule.
Perhaps it can be argued that the
weaknesses of the World Revival
Crusade: Night of Slack, the failure
of most of the cast to take them
selves seriously, to have the courage
of their comic convictions, is the
final irony of the evening. After all,
what did I expect of the
"Sub Genii"—a polished, consistent
production? Perhaps.
Yet, backed into a corner, I can
only question the ultimate meaning
— let alone value — of a genre
judged by an aesthetic of deteriora

lion, collapse. It's far too con
venient. The failures of ihe evening,
the painful gaps between comic con
ception and flat realization, are not
inspired metaphors for contemporary
culture or the human condition, hut
the product of a lack of constructive
philosophy and talent. In the final
analysis, however, any debate con
cerning bad acting versus the
Church's doctrine of "Bull-Dada,"
noise versus "anti-music" is moot.
Something other than an abandoned
exploration of the limits of humor or
anti-art is operative here. The care
free, culturally synthetic stance of
the Church is belied by the brutal
fact ot its purposefulness. Unfor
tunately. these people are dead
serious.
"No. this is No joke. No parody,"
an unusually earnest section in the
"Book of the Sub Genius" reads:
Only the foulness of your program
ming keeps you from believing that we
have thousands of members, nation
wide revivals, radio shows, and so on.
But we do. . . . Not only are we not
kidding, but we'll even piss you off.
Indeed, that's our JOB - our CALL
ING - our MISSION. We're going to
shock the hell out of every man, wo
man and child on this planet. It's a big
job, and we have only until to do
it. Still, its time enough for the Church
to be infiltrated and made evil, if we
don't watch ourselves.
The object of this fear, this
paranoia? "The Church of the Sub-
Genius becoming POPULAR and
turning into one big CHEAP JOKE."
It is a justifiable concern about a
fate implicit in the very conception
of the Church and made explicit in
the World Revival Crusade.
But I was not shocked or pissed
off. I was bored, and the threat to
the Church is not an anonymous
"evil" but its own circularity of
thought, its railing against the very
qualities of conventionalism and suc
cess to which it aspires. Envy is the
one consistent element of Sub Genius
humor. The members of the Church
of the Sub Genius desperately seek to
propel themselves, via cynicism, into
the comfortable arms of the
"Conspiracy." They want to become
the "Bobs" of the 1980s.
The Church may indeed become
popular. Look at the Cabbage Patch
Doll. But this will be in spite of its
ulterior drive for success, a drive
which cuts the ground out from
beneath its sarcasm and shows it for
what it is: so much sour grapes and
sentiment. It will also be in spite of
debacles like the World Revival
Crusade.
