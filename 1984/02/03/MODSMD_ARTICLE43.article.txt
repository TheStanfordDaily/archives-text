I Am a Fugitive from a Chain
Gang (1932)
Bijou, Palo Alto
! This was Warner Brothers'
' first social protest picture, and
probably the best; despite Paul
Muni's somewhat overwrought
performance and the sheer
melodramatic value of the con
tent, the tilm, which Mervyn
Le Roy directed from a
screenplay by Sheridan Gibney,
Brown Holmes and Robert E.
Burns, was so powerful that it
actually provoked prison
reform. Muni plays a man un
justly convicted of murder and
subjected to such brutality on a
chain gang that he escapes and
chooses a life on the run.

Glenda Farrell, Helen Vinson,
Preston Foster, Allen Jenkins,
Edward J. Macnamara, Berton
Churchill and F.dward Ellis co-
Star. This movie has one of the
m> >st famous last lines in film
history: Muni, sharing five
tortured minutes with his girl
friend before fleeing once
more, tells her of his life, and
when she asks him how he
manages to eat, he replies, "I
steal."

Carnal Knowledge (1971)
iCubberley Auditorium
This satirical comedy about
■ the emotional hollowness
J. beneath American men's sexual
I, obsessiveness is offensively
|112 broad, snide, and cruel to its
[characters; it's like the worst
[ parts of The Graduate (which
• Mike Nichols also directed)
[ blown up and exhibited as proof
| of the incisiveness of the direc
tor and the screenwriter (Jules
Feiffer in this case). But you
don't respond by thinking how
clever they are — you find
them just as repellently crass as
the characters they're indict
ing. This is a classic case of a
movie that practices exactly
what it preaches against. Jack
Nicholson. Art Garfunkel,
Candice Bergen and Ann-
Margret star; with Rita
Moreno, Carol Kane and Cyn
thia O'Neal.

Sophie's Choice (1982)
Memorial Auditorium
Alan Pakula's movie lumbers
along for more than two and a
half hours without care for
pace or dramatic tension, but
it's certainly faithful to
William Styron's prestigious best
seller (set in Brooklyn in
1947, Warsaw and Auschwitz in
flashbacks) — maddeningly

I faithful, as if Styron were I
Faulkner at the very least. In- I
stead of paring down Styron's I
overzealous narrative, losing I
the rites of passage subplot, ■
merging several of the flash- I
backs, and devising a more I
plausible treatment for
Sophie's lunatic lover Nathan H

(Kevin Kline), Pakula has taken
the other extreme: He actually
overlays blocks of Styron's
prose in the form of voice-over
narration. The only strength in
the movie is Meryl Streep's
portrayal of Sophie: She's
radiant in this movie — majes
tic — with real, rooted warmth.
Peter MacNicol is stuck with
the impossible role of the au-

thor's alter ego.
Plays Sunday evening,
Nosferatu (1922)
Terman Auditorium
One of the great horror films
— perhaps just a notch below
Carl Dreyer's Vampyr. F.W.
Murnau's expressionistic style is
peculiarly suited to Bram
Stoker's "Dracula," of which

Nosferatu is the first, and best,
adaptation, (Only one other,
Werner Herzog's Nosferatu the
Vampyre, a tribute to Murnau,
can even be discussed seriously
alongside it.) The title charac
ter ("Nosferatu" means "the
undead"), played by Max
Schreck, looks like a tall, thin
death's head with a hooked
nose and long, pointed fingers;

when he rises from his coffin,
we sec his fingernails first, lit
by Fritz Arno Wagner as
though they glowed from the
inside. One doesn't forget the
image of the ship drifting to
shore, its whole crew dead, or
the progression of coffins down
an otherwise deserted street, or
the rats surging from Dracula's
shipboard grave. Screenplay by
Henrik Galeen; decors and
costumes by Albin Grau; with

Alexander Granach, Gustav von
Wangenheim, Greta Schroeder,
G.H. Schnell and Ruth
Lansdorf.
Plays Tuesday evening.
The Caine Mutiny (1954)
Kresge Auditorium
Humphrey Bogart squeezes

those ball bearings in one of his
most famous paranoid
portrayals, as Captain Queeg,
whose peculiar behavior
provokes his crew to mutiny.
He gives a terrific performance,
luckily; the rest of the movie is
clumsy and wheezingly
melodramatic. Edward
Dmytryk directs a cast that in
cludes Jose Ferrer and three of
the blandest men who ever
sailed the seas — Van Johnson,
Fred Mac Murray and Robert

Francis — as well as May Wynn,
Tom Tully, E.G. Marshall, L.ee
Marvin and Arthur Franz. Stan
ley Roberts adapted Herman
Wouk's novel and play.
Plays tonight.
The Last Laugh (1925)
Haus Mitteleuropa
The great Emil Jannings plays

a hotel doorman who loses his
job and must take another as a
washroom attendant; the irony
is that both jobs are really
demeaning, but the doorman
retains at least a semblance of
dignity. F.W. Murnau directed
this celebrated German Expres
sionist silent, which employs
only a handful of inter-titles,
and it is visually so exciting and
eloquent that you hardly need
even the few the film supplies.
Plays Thursday evening.

It Happened One Night
(1934)
History Corner, Room 2
To punish Clark Gable and
Claudette Colbert for their
rebellious attitudes, their home
studios (M-G-M and
Paramount, respectively)
loaned them out to Columbia
and stuck them, over their ob
jections, on this modest roman
tic comedy, which Robert
Riskin had adapted from a
Samuel Hopkins Adams story
called "Night Bus." Not only
did thp'picture turn out to be a
hit, but it won all five top Os
cars: best picture, best actor,
best actress, best screenplay
and best director (Frank

Capra). And certainly neither
Gable nor Colbert ever turned
in a better performance. It's an
enchanting movie, beautifully
directed and lit (by Joseph
Walker), and containing at
least three scenes no movie
lover ever forgets: the bus ride,
the hitchhiking routine and the
"Walls of Jericho" sequence.
Plays tonight.
The Big Sleep (1946)
Location to be announced
Raymond Chandler's slick,
fast-paced detective novel
pales beside this film version,
directed by Howard Hawks and
featuring dialogue by William
Faulkner, Jules Furthman and
Leigh Brackett. The plot is tied
in knots no one has ever
succeeded in untangling; the
story goes that when the
screenwriters ran into trouble,
they called Chandler up and he
couldn't figure the damn thing
out either. But the prepos
terous tortuousness of the
story is as much a part of the
fun as the double entendres be
tween Bogart and Lauren
Bacall, and Martha Vickers'
turn as Bacall's infantile, las
civious kid sister. Bogart's im
personation of Chandler's
private eye hero Philip Marlowe
may not have met Chandler's
standards (inexplicably, he
preferred Dick Powell in Mur
der, My Sweet), but no one else
has ever complained.
Plays Wednesday evening
with Open City.
