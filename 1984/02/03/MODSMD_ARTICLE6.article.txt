The Pi Beta Phi sorority, whose bid tor
recognition was finally realized on Jan. 13,
received written confirmation from Assoc. Dean
of Residential Education Norm Robinson last
week. It was one of the last University sororities
to obtain such status.
Recognition by the University is only granted
to groups that are clearly autonomous from their
national organizations. Sorority President
Carolyn Benson said. "Basically we were already
autonomous but we didn't have a letter from the
national organization saying so. The national or
ganization was there in an advisory role only.
The necessary letter was received by the Pi Phis
on Jan. 11 and presented to Row Director Diana
Conklin on Jan. 13. That same day Robinson ver
bally recognized the group but the official Uni

versity letter was only recently received.
Universitv recognition means that the sorority
can now use the Stanford name, can use all
campus facilities and can hold their rush activi
ties on campus.
According to Benson, "1 don t think the na
ture of our group will change except that we'll be
a lot more visible on campus.
With the recognition of the Pi Beta Phi
sorority only one more sorority, the black Delta
Sigma THeta sorority, remains to be recognized
bv the University. The Delta Sigma Ihetas are
currently in the process of achieving University
recognition by demonstrating autonomy trom
their national chapter.
Acocniding to Inter-Sorority Council President
Lynne Biggar the fact that this sorority has not
been recognized no * i n terf erc w '*h the ISC s
plans to hold rush activities on campus because

the black sororities — Delta Sigma I heta and
Alpha Kappa Alpha—have traditionally held
their rush separately from the other groups.
The sororities, which have previously been
denied University housing as groups, are still
hoping that near-universal recognition may
change the situation. "Now that so many
sororities have been recognized we hope we can
eventually get housing," Benson said.
The moratorium on group housing petitions
and group housing policy in general is being
reviewed by a task force appointed by Dean of
Students James Lyons. The task force will make
its report in June, and according to Lyons, "It is
doubtful that there will be an effect on housing
this year."
••We'll have to wait for the task force decision
before considering housing changes but ot course
we would love the opportunity, " Biggar said.
