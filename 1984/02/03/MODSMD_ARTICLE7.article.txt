EDB suspension ordered
Washington — Environmental Protection Agency Admin
istrator William Ruckelshaus will order an emergency
suspension today of the use of ethylene dibromide as a
tumigant on grain and milling machinery, government and
industry sources said yesterday.
But the EPA will continue to permit the use of the
deadly pesticide on citrus fruit, the sources said, while re
search continues on alternate methods of fumigation.
Ruckelshaus, making his long-awaited announcement on
how the government will deal with contamination of the
nation's food supply hy the cancer-causing chemical, also
will announce "tolerance levels" for EDB in certain food
products, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.
The tolerance levels will serve as guidelines for action by
other states to remove contaminated food from grocery
shelves.
But officials said that immediate federal action to en
force the levels is unlikely, because either the EPA or the
Food and Drug Administration first would have to in
stitute a lengthy rule-making process to remove a
regulatory exemption granted to EDB in 1956. That ex
emption was based on a since-discarded scientific belief
that, over time, the deadly pesticide vaporizes without
leaving residues in food.
House includes denial of care
in child abuse definition
Washington — The House yesterday passed by a wide mar
gin legislation that would extend the definition of child
abuse to include the denial of care or treatment to handi
capped newborns.
The legislation would require state child abuse agencies to
set up procedures for reporting and investigating cases in
which medically beneficial treatment, nutrition and other
services are withheld from infants born with life
threatening birth defects or risk losing federal child abuse
funds.
Passage of these controversial "Baby Doe" provisions of
the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act was hailed
as a victory by "right-to-life" and disability groups, which
successfully fought efforts by powerful groups represent
ing doctors and hospitals to delete the Baby Doe provisions
from the major federal statute on child abuse.
House pull-out support erodes
Washington — House Democratic unity over a resolution
that calls for a "prompt and orderly" withdrawal of U.S.
Marines from Beirut eroded yesterday as congressmen from
both parties complained that the proposal was too long on
politics and too short on policy.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) had
hoped to rush the non-binding resolution to the House
floor by the end of next week. However, that appeared
doubtful, after Democratic members of the House Foreign
Relations Committee caucused late yesterday to iron out
their differences over the resolution's wording.
The caucus met after Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.), a
member of the committee, said that he would ask fellow
Democrats to consider a version of the resolution that
would be stripped of "gratuitous, provocative sections that
could be construed as partisan."
The original resolution, drafted earlier in the week by
Reps. Dante Fascell (D-Fla.) and Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.),
describes the Reagan administration's policy in Lebanon as
a failure and demands that the 1800 U.S. servicemen par
ticipating in the four-nation peacekeeping force there be
pulled out. It does not set a deadline for withdrawal,
however.
Sideshow may outshine mission
Kennedy Space Center, Fla. — The space shuttle Chal
lenger is scheduled to dump part of its payload, a communi
cations satellite, soon after it lifts off today, but the
sideshows, the untethered walks in space, are more likely to
capture the public's attention during the 10th shuttle
mission.
The Challenger will deploy a communications satellite for
Western Union eight hours after lifting off from Kennedy
Space Center at 8 a.m. EST. It will be the sixth satellite put
in orbit for Western Union by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
On the second day of the mission the crew will put an
other satellite in orbit for the government of Indonesia, a
major communications boost for that nation. The deploy
ment of those two satellites is listed as the primary purpose
for this mission and will help pay the bills. Western Union
and Indonesia contribute about $18 million to the mission.
Andropov's purge goes on
Moscow — The purge of senior and middle-level Commu
nist Party. officials begun by Soviet President Yuri
Andropov when he took power 15 months ago appears to be
continuing despite his prolonged illness.
Well-informed Soviet sources say that about one-third
of the party's top regional officials, including second and
third secretaries, were replaced during party elections in the
oblasts, or regions, in December and January.
Oblast party chiefs are, in effect, the Kremlin's regional
barons, wielding enormous power over each of the country's
150 administrative districts. Since Andropov took power,
34 of the 150 oblast chiefs have been replaced, 20 of them
during the recent elections.
Also during the past 15 months, more than one-fifth of
the members of the Soviet Cabinet — 19 out of the total
of 84 — have been removed from their posts for various
reasons.
Western analysts here speculated that the purge may
have been slowed down by Andropov's illness. In this view,
the personnel changes could be qualified as a "partial suc
cess" for Andropov, whose economic policies are lacing
resistance within the party hierarchy.
Eastern European diplomats, however, say that the scope
of personnel turnover was significant precisely because of
Andropov's illness and his long absence from public func
tions.
Decline of dollar stirs buying
New York — A late round of buying helped the stock
market post its first clear-cut gain in more than two weeks
yesterday.
Analysts said a recent decline of the dollar in foreign ex
changes stirred buying interest in industries such as phar
maceuticals, which do a large share of their business
overseas.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.57 to
1213.88, for its best daily showing since it gained 3.87
points on Jan. 17. From early last month through Wednes
day's close, the average tumbled 74.33 points.
