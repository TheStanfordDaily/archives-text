# Administration seeks to reduce deficit

From the Los Angeles Times
Washington â€” Administration officials moved
quickly yesterday to distance themselves from Presi
dent Reagan's budget only a day after it was sent to
Capitol Hill and called ior swift action to reduce
deficits through negotiations between the president
and Congress.
"The budget is not what we want to see hap
pen . . . My sense is that these negotiations supercede
completely the budget that has been set up." said
presidential economic adviser Martin Feldstein in ref
erence to the bipartisan negotiations that Reagan
proposed last week in his State of the Union address.
Said Feldstein: "We're going to have to have addi
tional tax revenues; we're going to have to trim back
on the size of the defense authorization; and we're
going to have to have domestic spending cuts."
As Feldstein and other administration were con
ceding that Reagan's $925 billion budget for fiscal
1985 does little to curb deficits, projected at about

$ I SO billion for each of the next three years. Reagan
was blaming Congress for the red ink and pledging
post-election action to put the government "on a
path" toward balanced budgets.
"In 1985 1 will submit a budget that can achieve
this goal." said Reagan in his annual Economic Report
to Congress.
He offered no details but noted that Congress
balked at deficit reduction measures he proposed last
year, which he said would have "put the deficit on a
sharply declining path" toward balanced budgets.
"The unwillingness of the Congress to accept the
proposals that I offered has made it clear to me that
we must wait until after this year's election to enact
spending reductions coupled with tax simplification
that will eventually eliminate our budget deficit."
Reagan said.
While Reagan's report presented a generally upbeat
assessment of the economy, his principal advisers pre

sen ted a dour view of the impact of the steadily rising
national debt on both the government and the eco
nomy.
-We are in the same position of many companies on
the eve of Chapter II." said Office of Management
and Budget Director David Stockman in reference to
bankruptcy law provisions under which companies
reorganize to avoid finanical collapse.
Stockman later told reporters he did not mean to
suggest that the government was on the brink of
bankruptcy but rather that any tax increases or
spending cuts to reduce deficits could be over
whelmed by the snowballing cost of financing a
growing national debt.
Net interest costs could hit $ ISO billion by the late
1980s and"I don't think there's anyone on this com
mittee who can think of enough taxes or enough
spending ... to even offset that explosion of debt
service costs." he told the Senate Finance Commit
tee.
