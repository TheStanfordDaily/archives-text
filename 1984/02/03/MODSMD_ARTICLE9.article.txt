### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Beirut — The Lebanese army un
leashed barrages of heavy artillery fire
on two fronts yesterday, in the south
ern suburbs of Beirut and into the
mountains above the city, as its battle
with rebel militias intensified.
MeaiYwhile, diplomatic efforts to
stop the fighting appeared to be losing
momentum.
A Western military source said the
fighting began yesterday afternoon
after the army discovered a cache of
weapons, belonging to the Shia Moslem
militia Amal, in predominantly Moslem
West Beirut.

He also said that Amal had asked for
artillery fire from Druse militiamen in
the Shouf mountains southeast of the
city. The Druse's targets, he said, were
outlying Christian neighborhoods and
the Defense ministry headquarters lo
cated near the presidential palace in
suburban Brabda. Moslem and Druse
militias here accuse the army of favor
ing Lebanon's Christian factions.
There are widespread fears in the
Lebanese capital that full-scale civil
war is inevitable unless some kind of na
tional reconciliation plan is quickly ac
cepted by all factions here.
However, the military source said he

did not think that yesterday's fighting
would be the flash-point. "I don't think
it's too serious," he said. "I don't think
it's the start of anything big on either
side. I know the Lebanese army is not
planning to do anything, not today
anyway."
A spokesman for Amal, Ghassan
Siblani, blamed the army for the out
break of fighting and claimed that the
militia had done nothing to start the
duel.
Maj. Dennis Brooks, a spokesman for
the U.S. Marine contingent stationed
in Beirut, said the Americans were not

involved in yesterday's lighting.
Earlier in the day.the Druse, mem
bers of an offshoot sect of Islam, ex
changed artillery fire with the army
near the Marine camp at Beirut Inter
national Airport.
The night before, the Druse and the
army traded shots near the key moun
tain village of Souq el Gharb, and Chris
tian sections of East Beirut were
pounded during the night with more ar
tillery fire. At least nine people died
and thousands of others huddled in
their basements, waiting for the fight
ing to subside.
