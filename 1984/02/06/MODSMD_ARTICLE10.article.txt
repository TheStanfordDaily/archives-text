From the Los Angeles Times
Jerusalem â€” Israel has urged.the
Reagan administration to demonstrate
a renewed commitment to Lebanese
President Amin Gemayel with a show
of military force against the anti
government Druse and Shiite Moslem
forces in the Beirut area, senior Israeli
officials said yesterday.
According to the officials, Israel has
conveyed to the administration its con
victions that no progress will be made
toward breaking the stalemate in
Lebanon so long as Syria, which sup
ports the forces arrayed against
Gemayel's increasingly beleagured lead
ership, believes that the United States
is unwilling to use the military power at
its command in Lebanon.
A senior official mentioned specifi
cally the possibility of renewed shellings
of Druse and Shiite positions by the
battleship New Jersey and other ships

of the U.S. Sixth Fleet stationed off
the coast of Beirut.
"We're convinced that if the U.S.
would shell the Druse and Shiite posi
tions, it could change the mood in
Lebanon," Ik said.
"The Syrians have made an assess
ment that you are not willing to use
your power. If you do not, you are not
going to get anywhere."
At the same time the official said it
would "not be as appropriate" for Is
rael to use its military force in the area
to come to the rescue of Gemayel. But
he reaffirmed Israel's resolve to "stand
fast" in the positions it now holds in
southern Lebanon regardless of
Gemayel's fate.
"Strategically, we are in an excellent
position," he said.
The official, who asked not to be
identified, volunteered these observa
tions on the day that Lebanese Prime

Minister Shafik Wazzan and his cabinet
resigned, deepening the Lebanese crisis.
The official's comments appeared to
reflect growing Israeli alarm over the
renewed lighting and the deteriorating
situation in Lebanon and discourage
ment over the lack of progress in U.S.
efforts to negotiate a political arrange
ment in Lebanon with Syria.
This Israeli assessment was ap
parently conveyed to U.S. special envoy
Donald Rumsfeld, who met here Friday
with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and Defense Minister Moshe Arens.
Israeli officials said the U.S. envoy,
who was recently in Damascus, reported
a "hardening of the Syrian position."
While suggesting that Israel was will
ing to compromise on the terms of last
year's Israeli-Lebanese troop
withdrawal agreement in order to reach
an understanding with Syria, the offi
cials said the Syrians would discuss with

Rumsfeld only their demands that the
agreement be renounced and that all Is
raeli troops withdraw unconditionally
from Lebanon.
According to press reports here yes
terday. Shamir was told by Rumsfeld he
was shifting the focus of his mission
away from seeking to arrange a
diplomatic resolution of the overall
Lebanon stalemate to the more imme
diate task of ending the renewed fight
ing that threatens Gemayel's rule.
Despite internal pressures to
withdraw, both Shamir and President
Reagan appear committed to maintain
ing their present positions in Lebanon
for the immediate future.
In reaffirming Israel's resolve to
"stand fast" in the south, officials here
were in effect replying to the or
ganizers of an antiwar march that Sat
urday night wound its way through the
streets of Jerusalem to Shamir's office.
