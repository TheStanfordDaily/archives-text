Deficit trouble
President Reagan formally pre
sented his proposed budget to
Congress Wednesday. The large
amount for the military and the def
icit of $180 billion arc the major con
cerns of the budget's opponents.
Reagan called for a bipartisan
group to design a plan to reduce the
deficit by $100 billion during the
next three years. Democrats, leery of
the proposition of being taken into
this sort of cooperation in an elec
tion year, had a return message. Call
ing Reagan's move a bluff, they
raised him one, proposing plans to
reduce the deficit by twice as much,
or $200 billion.
In his budget Reagan foresees a
long string of gradually decreasing
deficits. However, the Congressional
Budget Office sees a much worse
future with a steady increase coming
over the next five years. These
deficits are expected to put heavy
demands on capital markets especially
as the national employment level in
creases.
The day after the budget was
released administration officials,
most notably Martin Feldstein, the
president's chief economic adviser,
moved to distance themselves from
the proposed budget. Feldstein, in
the report of the Council of Eco
nomic Advisers, said last week that
the effect of the budget would be to
shave a large share of the domestic
savings, and basically to hurt the na
tion's long-term growth.
Although Reagan made the pro
posal of a bipartisan group to make
the small $100 billion of downpay
ment on the deficits, it is clear he
won't take on the full task of reduc
ing the deficit during the election

year. This is not to say that the presi
dent thinks the deficits are suitable.
He describes them as "totally unac
ceptable."
As the discussions over the $180
billion deficit go on, one might re
member that three years ago, the
Reagan administration predicted
that the budget would be balanced
by this year.
Another area of concern over the
budget is Reagan's devotion to the
continued increase in military spend
ing. Budget director David Stockman
in a candid interview with Fortune
magazine said that the possible cuts
in the social areas would have low
yields, yet the president is adamant
about cutting "domestic spending"
further and keeping defense spend
ing in its steady rise.
Lebanon resolution
Last week, amid renewed fighting
between Moslem and Druse militia
and Lebanese government troops,
many U.S. House Democrats
prepared a non-binding resolution ur
ging the president to begin a
"prompt and orderly withdrawal" of
the Marines in Lebanon.
The situation of the peacekeeping
force in Lebanon could turn out to
be one of the major issues of the
presidential campaign this year.
Many see the Marines in Lebanon as
one of the only major liabilities
Reagan is faced with in the cam
paign.
In addition to calling for the
removal of the Marines from
Lebanon, the Democrats, in their
resolution, also ask the president to
seek a United Nations force to take
over the role of the United States in
Lebanon as a peacekeeping force

The White House response to the
resolution was tne feeling that the
Democrats were playing politics.
Reagan said, 'Tm not going to pay
any attention to it."
Lawrence Eagleburger, under
secretary of state for political af
fairs, however, voiced the idea that
the administration has recognized
the possibility of political hot water
from the situation and is also looking
for a way out.
By the end of the week the sup
port that the resolution had gained
earlier in the week had somewhat
waned because of feelings by mem
bers of both parties in the House
that the proposal was too long on
politics and too short on policy.
Meanwhile in and around Beirut
the turmoil intensified. While dissat
isfaction with the government grew
Lebanese President Amin Gemayel
said that a withdrawal of the
Marines from Lebanon would mean
the end of Lebanese unity and
democracy. Druse leader Walid
Jumblatt called for the resignation
of the whole Gemayel government
and also predicted major conflicts in
the future including "decisive
battles" between the two sides.
Jumblatt's prediction of escalating
violence did not prevent him from
adding to the whole confusion by also
calling for a resumption of talks.
EDB regulations
The Environmental Protection
Agency moved Friday to regulate the
pesticide ethylene dibromide, EDB.
Products were removed from food
stores in a number of states because
of concern over the possible cancer
causing effects of EDB in the last
few weeks. The EPA's move barring

the use of the pesticide on grains also
recommended maximum safe limits
for residues in raw processed and
cooked grain prooducts. The EPA is
planning to take action on the use of
EDB for fruit in the future.
The reaction heard to the removal
heard thus far suggests that the
agency's actions won't allay concerns
over EDB and other cancer-causing

chemicals in the food supply.
EPA administrator William Ruck
elshaus said that the action would
produce a "reasonable reduction" in
health risks from EDB, but that he
can't establish EDB at "zero risk"
levels because of laws requiring a bal
ance of consideration for the food
industry's needs to protect the food
supply from insects.

Democratic presidential contender
Walter Mondale, campaigning last
week, recalled that Ruckelshaus had
proposed a complete EDB ban in
September but that the industry had
gotten a review thereby 1 postponing
the decision.
There have been no documented
cases linking EDB exposure with can
cer in humans, however lab tests have
shown the possibility of it being car
cinogenic.
El Salvador aid
President Reagan agreed to make
further aid to El Salvador condi
tional to human rights progress in
that country. However, he made a
qualification that it would only be a
factor if the White House, and nqt
Congress, would be making the judg
ment calls.
This week Reagan is planning to
submit proposals to increase military
aid to El Salvador by $312 million
over the next two years. The presi
dent's commission on Central
America, led by former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, said that this
should be part of a recommended $8
billion in aid for the region over the
next five years. Kissinger is calling
for a tying of further aid to the
government's human rights record.
A major human rights problem is
the Salvadoran government's bad
record in protecting citizens from
rightist death squads. Secretary of
State George Shultz told the Sal
vadoran government that though
"considerable" progress in human
rights has been made, more would be
necessary for Congress to approve
more aid.
