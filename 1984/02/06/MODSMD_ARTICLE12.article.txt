When the Founding Grant of the University
was penned in 1885, it stated that one of the
University's foremost objectives was to
"qualify students for personal success and direct
usefulness in life." Today, many students seem
to have taken those words to heart — perhaps
too much so.
Ralph Nader, speaking here last week,
reminded students that there is more to an edu
cation than its practicality for attaining a well
paying job after graduation. In a sense, what
Nader did was echo the further lines of the
grant which seem to have been lost upon some
students: that an education "should promote
the public welfare by exercising an influence in
behalf of humanity and civilization."
In today's acquisitive society, too many stu
dents neglect the fact that corporate responsi
bility begins with a company's employees. A
company's financial success is often the mark
which lures students for employment, not the
company's accountability for honest and fair
business practices.
Employees can influence a company and they
can also be swept under by a company's profit

at-all-costs attitude, even it some law is vio
lated or somebody is hurt along the way. The
temptation is there for graduates to go with a
financial winner, even if it means compromising
one's integrity for success.
Governmental policies promoting deregula
tion of big business make many large corpora
tions susceptible to white-collar gratt. The
education provided by the University should
foster an awareness that such practices exist
and make students look beyond a company's
monetary assets when seeking employment.
While "the direct usefulness in life" of an
education is essential for success, the skills
learned can be misguided without a broad curric
ulum. The ideals of the true liberal arts educa
tion need to be instilled in students along with
the sense of practicality of that education.
If the knowledge taken from the University is
directed toward a company or any other employ
er with reputable practices, then "humanity and
civilization" will be served. And really, that is
the only way to ensure complete "personal suc
cess" for any student.
