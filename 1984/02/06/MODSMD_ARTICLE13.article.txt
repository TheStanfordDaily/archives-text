I actually know someone who
invaded Grenada. Well, I don't really
know him, but he's from my
hometown, which is a small place, so 1
like to say that I know him.
Everyone from my hometown is
quite proud of this man (I'll call him
Sam). I think their pride stems more
from the fact that he made it back
from Grenada than the knowledge
that he went in the first place. After
all, my town is known for its af
fluence, and traveling to islands in
the Caribbean is almost a hobby for
many families.

I myself hold the distinction of
having once been on an island not 50
miles from Grenada. But few of us
get shot at, let alone shoot back. So
Sam is now a veritable local hero.
The town paper, which doesn't see
much by way of local heroes, praised
our soldier up and down in a nice cov
er story which celebrated his
Christmas homecoming. It seems he
was shot at quite a lot.
I hear that he killed a few people.

hut the paper didn't mention this, so
I guess it isn't true. The paper did
mention that Sam distinguished him
self by arresting three Cubans. I
didr't know being Cuban was a crime,
but I guess it's against the law in
Grenada since the Cubans have their
own island and they should be
satisfied with that. The soldier,
however, assures us that they
deserved to be arrested.
He also assures us that after seeing
what he saw he's positive that
Grenada was a dangerous place for
Americans to be. He was sent to res-

cue and protect American citizens
specifically those at the medical
school. If we had been there, he in
sists. we would agree that Americans
were in danger.
Well, I'm sure that Grenada was
dangerous after a number of
Americans started running around in
fatigues, wielding machine guns and
shooting at people. Sam tells us he
was shot at. That doesn't surprise
me. As for the danger to students in

Grenada and Americans in Califor
nia, I'm not so sure.
The problem is that Sam was there
and I wasn't. I never enjoy talking to
men who shoot people for a living;
it's hard to win. But Sam does have
an advantage besides his imposing
uniform: He saw it all.
The hometown-boy's word was
enough to convince my friends who
weren't sure that invading Grenada
was a good idea, as well as helping
those who already thought so, win
arguments. Sam was there; do I
think he's lying?
No, I don't think Sam is lying. But
then again, I wouldn't expect some
one who used to tell classmates who
wore combat clothes that they were
desecrating the Army to tell the
local paper that his first exploits in
the Army was a farce.
See, Sam didn't take any pictures.
Newspaper reporters are an effective
lot to bring along on invasions be
cause they all carry cameras. They
also have less to lose than Sam or
some general or Reagan by saying
stuff like there was no reason to
invade Grenada. And they're also
easier to argue with when you dis
agree with them. All in all, 1 think it
would have been a really neat idea to
let reporters go to Grenada with
Sam.
But people like Sam don't agree.
After all, the soldiers were kind
enough to guide some reporters to a
big building filled with enemy weap
ons. Isn't that proof enough?
When I suggest that maybe the
soldiers spent all their time in
Gtenada making sure such a weapons
site actually existed, or, perhaps,
making the site themselves before
they allowed reporters in, people like
Sam laugh. And when people like Sam
laugh at you, you laugh with them.
Then you go and write articles so
that everyone else can see how silly
your ideas are and laugh just as hard
as Sam. That's what columnists are
for.
