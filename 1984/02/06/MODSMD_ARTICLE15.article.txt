## Newman's Middle East under fire 
### 
Sally Newman's column (Daily,
Jan. 31), on the Mideast, rather
than introducing "background be
hind the screaming headlines." only
re-introduces the same old mislead
ing and misguided political clap-trap
about Israeli warriors of peace vs. an
intolerant, bloodthirsty Moslem
world.
She wrongly declares that Mos
lems permit almost no religious or
ideological deviance, when for cen
turies, both Jews and Christians
were given "protected peoples"
status under the Ottoman Empire,
allowing them to practice and
preserve their religion and customs
in return for loyalty and payment of
taxes. In fact, both these minorities
enjoyed great economic privileges as
intermediaries between European
traders and the empire.
The modern problems described by
Newman result from relatively
recent political developments such
as minority. Christian Maronite rule
in Lebanon and the creation of the
state of Israel.
Further, when Newman points
fingers at Mideast aggressors, Israel
remains conspicuously absent. One
of the world's most powerful armies,
the Israeli Defense Force, armed
with billions of dollars worth of
sophisticated, American-donated
hardware, is a good example of how
in the Mideast, as Newman explains,
"the bullet, not the ballot" breaks
political deadlocks.
Attempting a serious evaluation
of the Mideast in her column, New
man only achieves an emotional
release, declaring essentially that
something is wrong with this region
without thinking through but an
Israeli-American or Christian per
spective.

More Mideast
Sally Newman's column (Daily.
Jan. 31) addressed the issue of
reconsidering relations in the
Mideast. While I certainly laud the
general concept, I must take excep
tion to some of her particulars.
First, her idea that being able to
travel to Egypt, Israel and Lebanon
on the same passport is indicative of

whatever progress has been made in
the region is ridiculous. More than
anything else this is a testament to
the fact that the holder of an
American passport is normally
allowed entry to countries allied
with the United States.
Second, and more important, her
unbalanced view of Soviet and
American involvement in the region
is representative of the very prob
lems she purports to be addressing.
She states that the "killing
fiesta" has been made larger by
active Soviet involvement; this is
undeniably true. However, she
refuses to recognize the symmetry
of American and Soviet activity in
the region. She writes: "Before
1 955, when the first massive ship
ments of Soviet arms arrived in
Egypt, fewer people were killed in
each war
At no point does she make the
equally true revelation that, before
1948, when massive shipments of
U.S. arms were sent to the new
state of Israel, fewer people were
killed in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
I do not wish to open the can of
worms of whether the U.S. has
strategic interests in the Mideast,
and if so, what these are and how
they might best be pursued.
However, the matter-of-fact tone
of Newman's statement that the
United States "must keep a vigilant
eye on Soviet maneuvers in the
region" belies its informativeness.
Reverse the subject and the object
in the above statement, recalling
that our active involvement in the
region began at least a full seven
years before that of the Soviets.
Note also that, of the two super
powers, only one is involved actively
with its land and sea forces, adding
to the daily death toll in the region.
The time has come for Americans
to reconsider our relations not just
in the Mideast, but throughout the
world. We cannot stick our thumbs
in every pie and hope to guard each
one selfishly for ourselves. There are
other countries in the world with
their own strategic interests.
That the tactics of an "Evil
Empire" in certain respects so
resemble our own should lead us to
pause and think. Perhaps this reflec
tion will lead to genuine accom
modation and coexistence rather

than further exchanges of smugly
accusatory rhetoric.

Cole quips
In a recent column (Daily. Jan.
30). I.uke Cole expressed his concern
that the balance between liberal and
conservative forces on the U.S.
Supreme Court is being tilted in the
"wrong" direction under the Reagan
presidency. In contrast with Justices
William Rehnquist and Sandra
O'Connor, who are generally consid
ered conservative and appear to
favor judicial restraint. Cole sup
ports an "activist philosophy" on
the part of the conducive to
"major social reform where
legislative and executive decisions
have failed."
Presumably, he agrees with the
liberal members of the court and
their sometimes very loose, if not
Jesuitic, interpretations of the
Constitution, fearing that further
Reagan appointees could follow the
"reactionary, restrictive line" in
opposing far-reaching political deci
sions whose constitutional
legitimacy is questionable.
Having certain political ideals is
one thing; believing that these
should be imposed on society by the
judiciary branch of government is
quite another.
I. for one, believe that the Su
preme Court would be wise to
refrain from being a group of par
tisan gurus performing an essentially
legislative function. Unfortunately,
however, there have been occasions
when I was under the impression
that the court has just made some
thing up, ruling on the basis of cur
rently fashionable ideals rather than
the Constitution.
One wonders: Would Cole also
approve of judicial activism if the
courts happened to be dominated by
followers of Jerry Falwell, deter
mined to apply their Moral Majority
standards in order to achieve social
reform?
Isn't it obvious that judicial im
perialism. and not so much the poli
tical composition of the Supreme*
Court, poses a great threat to
freedom and democracy in America?
