## Some late resolutions for the new year 
### 
Every January I make a list of New Year's
resolutions for myself. And every February I find
that I've either broken or forgotten them all. I
suppose most people do the same thing, but evcii
so, it's discouraging.
I've always thought it would be more fun if we
were allowed to make resolutions for other
people instead. If I could make such a list for
1984. it would concern mostly prominent individ
uals, and it would look something like this:

VIEWPOINT

Ronald Reagan. From 1982 to 1984. almost
258 U.S." peacekeepers have been killed in
Lebanon's civil war. Donald Rumsfeld, our
diplomat in Lebanon, has arranged plans for
peace talks in the future. And the Rev. Jesse
Jackson's surprising agreement made with Syrian
President Hafez Assad has also done much to
pave the way home for our Marines in Beirut.
Nonetheless, President Reagan holds the trump
card for the return of any U.S. soldiers.
Recently Reagan wrote Assad, saying that it is
"an opportune moment to put all the issues on
the table." Unfortunately, peace talks are not
yet confirmed and Reagan is reluctant to pull the
Marines out until that time. As a result.
Americans will continue to die in a hopeless at
tempt to keep peace in a nation at war.
A promise to unilaterally withdraw all Ameri
can troops from Lebanon would be a very noble
resolution for Reagan in the new year.
Jesse Jackson. Jackson, one of 1984's most
charismatic Democratic candidates, once
referred to his political machine as "part cam
paign and part crusade." Jackson's tendency to

mix religious jargon with political language
sometimes disturbs me, but basically I like Jack
son. I think he cares about people. That's why I
would offer him this observation on his crusades
and campaigns.
There is no doubt that Jackson's political
crusades have proved successful. Already he has
effected the release of Lt. Robert Goodman
from Syria and rounded up nearly 2()(),()()() new
black voters in this country.
Jackson's problem is not his crusade: It's his
campaign. Jackson has been so dedicated to
the emotional side of his politics that he has for
gotten about the technical side, namely the
maintenance of proper records for campaign con
tributions and the observation of state-ballot
deadlines.
As a result Jackson has not yet been certified
for federal funds, and his name may not appear
on the ballots of three states. If Jackson is
serious about his candidacy in 1984, he should
promise to pay more attention to his campaign
this year than to his crusade.
Ed McMahon. It's a small point, but I think
Johnny Carson's famous co-host is on TV too
much these days. In addition to "The Tonight
Show," McMahon is hosting a small variety show
and endorsing mail-in sweepstakes offers as well.
McMahon should stick to the Carson show and
forget about sweepstakes offers for the new
year. I've never won one of those things and I
don't think he has either. If I were McMahon. I'd
resolve to stop laughing so much too.
Presidential Task Force on Food Assistance. If
it's possible to suggest a New Year's resolution
to an entire organization. I have a thought for
Reagan's task force. Last September this 13-

member panel set out to investigate the problem
of hunger in America. Four months and $320,000
later the task force presented Reagan with only
two things: a muddled definition of the noun
"hunger" and a statement that it is impossible to
determine if anyone is really suffering from
hunger in the United States.
This year I suggest Reagan's task force buy an
inexpensive dictionary and stand in the lines at
St. Vincent de Paul soup kitchens.
Yasser Arafat. It would make my day if the
leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization
would usher in the new year by shaving off his
three-day beard and start dressing neatly. Part
of the reason Arafat has this image of a terrorist
is that, to most of us, he looks like one.
Now I don't really like Arafat, but I do wish he
could relate more reasonably with other world
leaders. And today it is hard for statespeople to
respect any man who is not clean-shaven and
dressed in a pin-stripe suit.
The fact that Arafat looks like Ringo Starr
has always bothered me too. But I guess there's
not much he can do about that.
I know a lot of people would think it might be
cute to also resolve that we should read Orwell's
"19N4" this year. These are probably the same
people who like to read all those editorials
that compare today's society to Orwell's vision.
I'm not going to suggest we do either one.
"19N4" is a good book and. if you are interested,
you'll read it on your own.
I'm not going to end this column by telling a
cute 1984 joke either. I suppose that is as close as
I will come to a New Year's resolution for myself
this year. I'm terrible at telling jokes anyway.
