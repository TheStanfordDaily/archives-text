## Poet Thomas no longer a Boy 
### HEATHER WRIGHT 
I he many who grew up with "The
Waltons" probably have a distinct, al
most indelible, vision of the Great De
pression, small country towns, large,
close-knit families, moonshine traffick
ing and Richard Thomas.
Richard Ihomas, who played the
erudite, never-do-wrong, son John-Boy
on "The Waltons" will always be, in
large part, John-Boy to many of the
millions who watched him every
I hursday night for five years.
But Richard Ihomas has come a long
way since he left "The Waltons," John-
Boy and the CBS set seven years ago.
He has made movies, acted on Broad
way, married, had four children and
devoted more time to one of his first
loves: writing poetry.
I riday afternoon, Richard Thomas
read some of his own poetry and that
of his "mentor" John Ashbery, a New
York poet, to nearly 60 Stanford stu
dents at Adams House in Sterling
Quadrangle.
Afterwards, he informally enter
tained questions over wine and cheese
in the cottage of longtime friend Ar
turo islas, a professor of English who is
resident fellow at Adams. Bespectacled
in gold-rimmed glasses, distinguished by
a large mole on his left cheek and
dressed simply, in an oxford shirt,
maroon button-up sweater and navy
cords, Thomas echoed John-Boy. Even
his smooth and lyrical voice, at once
soft and strong, was reminiscent of
John-Boy. Yet the poetry Thomas read
was quite different from the typically
dry, morality-laced journal entries of
John-Boy Walton.
Instead, Thomas' poetry, sensual and
somewhat sexual, overflows with

images of love, marriage, passion, myt
hology and Hollywood life. Thomas
called it "love poetry."
"I've been writing poetry since I was a
child. At five, 1 gave my parents a book
of my own poems. My dad thinks it's
the best stuff I've written," he said
with a laugh.
Thomas has written three poetry
books: "Poetry" was published in 1974,
"In the Moment" in 1978, and "Glass"
in 1981.
Thomas, born in 195 1, grew up in New
York City, the son of professional bal
let dancers. "I was raised in the
theater," he said. "I had my first role in
a Broadway show about the Roosevelts
when I was seven years old.
"I never had any formal training," he
said, "but the informal training, you
know, from the actors and actresses
around me constantly, was invaluable."
Thomas was in his third year at Co
lumbia University, majoring in Chinese,
when he left to do "The Waltons."
"I was 21 when "The Waltons'
began," Thomas said. "It was a special
show because you could bring so much
of yourself into it. Like when I broke
my leg, and when Ellen (the grand
mother) had a stroke, the writers just
worked it into the script," he contin
ued. "I even got to do some directing."
Although "The Waltons" ran for 10
years (Thomas said he was originally
surprised it lasted more than one),
Thomas left after his five-year con
tract expired.
"That was enough," he said explain
ing that "the longer you wait, the
harder it is to overcome the image of
your first impressive role. I figured it
would take five more years to get rid of
John-Boy and regain Richard Thomas. I

was just about right."
Richard Thomas is now 33 years old.
In the seven years since he left "The
Waltons" he has acted in many televi
sion movies, Broadway shows, and for
the Circle Reperatory Group in New
York City.
But even more important to Thomas
is his family, which has grown, though
somewhat surprisingly, during the last
seven years.
Richard and his wife Alma, who he
married eight years ago, now have Rich
ard, Jr., seven, and identical triplets
Barbara, Gwenyeth and Pilar, two-and
a-half.
"Both Alma and I have histories of
twins but this . . . he trailed off.
"They are great. They have their own
very distinct personalities, but the
other night they had identical
nightmares," he said with a smile. As
a result of these new commitments,
Thomas does, "two to three movies a
year and maybe one Broadway show.
That way I can be with my family."
What is Richard Thomas doing now?
"Resting," he said emphatically. And
writing poetry. "Archipelago," com
pleted only two weeks ago after three
years of writing and revision, was well
received and applauded by students at
the Adams House poetry reading. Dedi
cated to his wife, "Archipelago" is
clearly and musically, "love-poetry".
Although the day may come whan
Thomas will do another series:"lt would
have to be challenging and potentially
successful," he said. "But you never
know," Thomas said with the twinkle
of a true performer, "there is someth
ing very exciting about such a large au
dience. That's when the stakes are
highest and I'm at my best."

millions who watched him every
I hursday night for five years.
But Richard Ihomas has come a long
way since he left "The Waltons," John-
Boy and the CBS set seven years ago.
He has made movies, acted on Broad
way, married, had four children and
devoted more time to one of his first
loves: writing poetry.
I riday afternoon, Richard Thomas
read some of his own poetry and that
of his "mentor" John Ashbery, a New
York poet, to nearly 60 Stanford stu
dents at Adams House in Sterling
Quadrangle.
Afterwards, he informally enter
tained questions over wine and cheese
in the cottage of longtime friend Ar
turo islas, a professor of English who is
resident fellow at Adams. Bespectacled
in gold-rimmed glasses, distinguished by
a large mole on his left cheek and
dressed simply, in an oxford shirt,
maroon button-up sweater and navy
cords, Thomas echoed John-Boy. Even
his smooth and lyrical voice, at once
soft and strong, was reminiscent of
John-Boy. Yet the poetry Thomas read
was quite different from the typically
dry, morality-laced journal entries of
John-Boy Walton.
Instead, Thomas' poetry, sensual and
somewhat sexual, overflows with

images of love, marriage, passion, myt
hology and Hollywood life. Thomas
called it "love poetry."
"I've been writing poetry since I was a
child. At five, 1 gave my parents a book
of my own poems. My dad thinks it's
the best stuff I've written," he said
with a laugh.
Thomas has written three poetry
books: "Poetry" was published in 1974,
"In the Moment" in 1978, and "Glass"
in 1981.
Thomas, born in 195 1, grew up in New
York City, the son of professional bal
let dancers. "I was raised in the
theater," he said. "I had my first role in
a Broadway show about the Roosevelts
when I was seven years old.
"I never had any formal training," he
said, "but the informal training, you
know, from the actors and actresses
around me constantly, was invaluable."
Thomas was in his third year at Co
lumbia University, majoring in Chinese,
when he left to do "The Waltons."
"I was 21 when "The Waltons'
began," Thomas said. "It was a special
show because you could bring so much
of yourself into it. Like when I broke
my leg, and when Ellen (the grand
mother) had a stroke, the writers just
worked it into the script," he contin
ued. "I even got to do some directing."
Although "The Waltons" ran for 10
years (Thomas said he was originally
surprised it lasted more than one),
Thomas left after his five-year con
tract expired.
"That was enough," he said explain
ing that "the longer you wait, the
harder it is to overcome the image of
your first impressive role. I figured it
would take five more years to get rid of
John-Boy and regain Richard Thomas. I

was just about right."
Richard Thomas is now 33 years old.
In the seven years since he left "The
Waltons" he has acted in many televi
sion movies, Broadway shows, and for
the Circle Reperatory Group in New
York City.
But even more important to Thomas
is his family, which has grown, though
somewhat surprisingly, during the last
seven years.
Richard and his wife Alma, who he
married eight years ago, now have Rich
ard, Jr., seven, and identical triplets
Barbara, Gwenyeth and Pilar, two-and
a-half.
"Both Alma and I have histories of
twins but this . . . he trailed off.
"They are great. They have their own
very distinct personalities, but the
other night they had identical
nightmares," he said with a smile. As
a result of these new commitments,
Thomas does, "two to three movies a
year and maybe one Broadway show.
That way I can be with my family."
What is Richard Thomas doing now?
"Resting," he said emphatically. And
writing poetry. "Archipelago," com
pleted only two weeks ago after three
years of writing and revision, was well
received and applauded by students at
the Adams House poetry reading. Dedi
cated to his wife, "Archipelago" is
clearly and musically, "love-poetry".
Although the day may come whan
Thomas will do another series:"lt would
have to be challenging and potentially
successful," he said. "But you never
know," Thomas said with the twinkle
of a true performer, "there is someth
ing very exciting about such a large au
dience. That's when the stakes are
highest and I'm at my best."
