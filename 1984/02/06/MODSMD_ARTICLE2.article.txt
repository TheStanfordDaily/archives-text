# Committee offers new concert plan
## 
### DANNY PEARL 
The Committee on Contemporary
Entertainment (COCE) Evaluation
Committee will present a charter for
a new two-tiered plan for organizing
concerts on campus to Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons this week.
If Lyons and University President
Donald Kennedy approve the plan,
concerts could return to the Stan
ford campus by late summer, ending-a
morato r ium Kennedy imposed on
concerts last fall to allow revalua
tion of the current system after
Lyons encharged the COCE with
constructing a new system.
The charter, approved by commit
tee members on Friday, would replace
the COCE with a Concert Network
staffed predominately by students,
would give the Concert Network a
partial monopoly on organization of
on-campus concerts, would allow stu
dent organizations to invest in the
Network, would plan a minimum of
seven concerts in the first year and
would necessitate a one-time
$49,000 fee assessment to cover pos
sible losses.
Council-of-Presidents member
Vinnie Freda, who has been involved
with the COCE for over three years,
defended the fee assessment as nec
essary. "We can't put on any concert
unless we have the money to cover
it," Freda said. "Without the fee as
sessment, there will be no concerts in
Frost."
The fee assessment money would
be placed in a special reserve, from
which no-interest loans could be
made to the investor's general

reserve. Freda said that several stu
dent groups, including KZSU and the
Band, have already expressed a pre
liminary interest in investing.
The Concert Network would be
made up of a 12-member Concert
Advisory Board and a three-member
Executive Team on the administra
tive level, and a Concert Corps on
the implementation level.

Committee member Ellie Oppen
heim, director of Tresidder Union,
said that student organizations could
approach the Executive Team and
propose a concert, and students could
become involved in the planning and
promotion of shows through the
Concert Corps.
"What we like about the plan."

sarelli. "is it gives students the ad
vantage in bringing groups to the
campus. I! am one wants to bring in
outside artists, we have first shot.
Students will be involved not just in
putting up barricades and moving
trash cans, but also in promotion,
planning and advertising."
In the past, concert planning has
been open to anyone who could tind
an interested outside promoter and
who could get approval from the
COCE. Under this system. Freda
said, there were very few people on
campus who had the experience to
put on a show. "As a result. Bill
Graham was able to do almost every
thing. and students didn't learn
anything."
in addition, there was often com
petition between two or more groups
who wanted to put on the same
show, as when the Stanford Alumni
Network and the Delta Upsilon
Fraternity competed over the Kenny
Loggins fall show.
"Students would go to. say. Bill
Graham and underbid each other for
a concert, until whoever got to put it
011 got a bad deal." said Passarelli.
who nHHfH that students often

didn't know who to go to if they had
a concert idea.
Under the proposed system, the
Concert Network would plan most of
the concerts themselves, but student
organizations could co-sponsor shows
with the Network. Any student
group which wanted to stage a con
temporary concert at Memorial
Auditorium or Frost Auditorium
would have to get approval from the
concert adviser, who would be a rep
resentative of Tresidder Union.
In order to gain approval for a
concert, a student group would have
to ensure student involvement in
production and promotion, promise
not to compete against the Concert
Network and show sufficient finan
cial resources to cover potential
losses. One of the problems with the
system in the past has been the lack
of set criteria for approving con
certs. Freda noted.
Lyons, who approved an early draft
of the charter in December, will
probably receive the final draft
Tuesday. The committee members
said they hope he will recommend to
Kennedy that the moratorium be
lifted, but Freda said he didn't ex
pect specific concert plans to be
made until summer. Freda said that
the fee assessment would be on the
April ballot.
