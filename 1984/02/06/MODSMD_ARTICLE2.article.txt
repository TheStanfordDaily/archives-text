# Committee offers new concert plan
## 
### DANNY PEARL 
The Committee on Contemporary
Entertainment (COCE) Evaluation
Committee will present a charter for
a new two-tiered plan for organizing
concerts on campus to Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons this week.
If Lyons and University President
Donald Kennedy approve the plan,
concerts could return to the Stan
ford campus by late summer, ending-a
morato r ium Kennedy imposed on
concerts last fall to allow revalua
tion of the current system after
Lyons encharged the COCE with
constructing a new system.
The charter, approved by commit
tee members on Friday, would replace
the COCE with a Concert Network
staffed predominately by students,
would give the Concert Network a
partial monopoly on organization of
on-campus concerts, would allow stu
dent organizations to invest in the
Network, would plan a minimum of
seven concerts in the first year and
would necessitate a one-time
$49,000 fee assessment to cover pos
sible losses.
Council-of-Presidents member
Vinnie Freda, who has been involved
with the COCE for over three years,
defended the fee assessment as nec
essary. "We can't put on any concert
unless we have the money to cover
it," Freda said. "Without the fee as
sessment, there will be no concerts in
Frost."
The fee assessment money would
be placed in a special reserve, from
which no-interest loans could be
made to the investor's general

reserve. Freda said that several stu
dent groups, including KZSU and the
Band, have already expressed a pre
liminary interest in investing.
The Concert Network would be
made up of a 12-member Concert
Advisory Board and a three-member
Executive Team on the administra
tive level, and a Concert Corps on
the implementation level.

Committee member Ellie Oppen
heim, director of Tresidder Union,
said that student organizations could
approach the Executive Team and
propose a concert, and students could
become involved in the planning and
promotion of shows through the
Concert Corps.
"What we like about the plan."
