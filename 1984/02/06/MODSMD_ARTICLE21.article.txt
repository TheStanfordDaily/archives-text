# LOTS overcrowding no fun

### DIANE PATTERSON 
For many students enrolled in courses requir
ing the use of the University's computer system,
recent weeks have not been too pleasant.
Enrollment has skyrocketed this quarter in
comparison with last winter, according to data
kept by administrators of the Low Overhead
Time-Sharing (LOTS) facility. In the winter of
1983, 786 students registered for computer sci
ence courses numbered 103 through 108. In the
current winter quarter there are 1 130 — an in
crease of 44 percent.
In order to use the LOTS computer, students
have to get into a queue — an electronic waiting
list — for available terminals. At times there
can be as many as 45 in the queue, meaning a
wait for a terminal of an hour or longer.
According to Ralph Gorin, director of the
LOTS facility, the backlog in available user time
was expected..
"Winter quarter is traditionally the heaviest
quarter for enrollment in computer science
classes," Gorin said. "On registration day for
winter quarter people look at the gray skies and
decide that they had better stay in and get some
work done. In spring no one wants to spend his
time inside, and in fall, students are just coming
back from summer vacation."
Things have calmed down at LOTS since the
long lines of about a week ago, but Gorin ex
pects that by the end of the quarter, when all
the classes' longest projects are due, the queue
will be just as long, if not longer.
"The load will be at 50," Gorin said.
The "load" is a measure of the amount of ac
tual work that the computer is asked to do. A

load of five is considered high with other sys
tems, but considered good at L.OTS. When the
load gets above 20, the computer will not let
anyone to get onto the system regardless of the
availability of a terminal.
Senior Greg Ching, the student coordinator
on the LOTS staff, has noticed the number of"
users on the system increase dramatically, and
notes that "success is smothering the place," as
the problems have increased along with the
usage.
Not everyone who is at a terminal is using the
system for programming or other related com
puter work. "Some students are using the
facilities to do word processing for papers," said
Ching. "Terminal time is taken away from those
who have to complete assignments and run pro-»
grams."
Students who are not in a class and do not
have special allocations — awarded through pev
tition and a note from a professor — are given
"default time," which is essentially spare time
on the system. Soon. Gorin said, due to the high.
winter quarter demand, this default time will go
to zero. i
The administration in charge of LOTS has
some ideas on what to do about overcrowding*
however. Gorin mentioned that he and others,
are currently considering several possibilities.
One is the purchasing of another computer•
mainframe (the central warehousing for the
processing hardware of the computer),
tentatively a Digital Equipment Corporation
model known as a VAX.
Yet another option would be the use of per
sonal computers as an alternative to using i
time-sharing system such as LOTS.
