# Professor's commentary: Richard Fagen
## Nicaragua: arming against the rationality of the Pentagon 
### 
Political Science Prof. Richard Fagen has
been a member of the Stanford faculty for 22
years. His main area of interest is Central
America. On leave autumn quarter, he visited
Nicaragua for the ninth time since the triumph
of the Sandinist Revolution.
I found the letter in my hox at the Inter-
Continental Hotel in Managua. From a
young Nicaragaun historian with whom I had
made an appointment, it read in part: "I'm
very sorry, but I won't he able to meet with
you. I just received mobilization orders and I
have to go to a military zone. As you know,
the emergeney imposed on Nicaragua by
President Reagan's imperial designs obliges
us to set aside ou r work and take up weapons
to defend the sovereignty and independence
of our country."
Since the middle of 1983 — and with ac
celerating velocity after the U.S. invasion of
Grenada — Nicaragua has been a nation pre
paring for war. On July 19, the fourth an
niversary of the Sandinist revolution, the
country blossomed with billboards saying
"All Arms To The People." The slogan was
translated into policy in a matter of months.
By the end of the year, tens of thousands of
AK-47 assault rifles had been distributed to
the populace.
Traveling through the countryside one
sees these weapons everywhere: the 65-year
old grandfather guarding a bridge on the
Pacific Coast . . . the 16-year-old girl on
night patrol in a border town and the
peasant of indeterminate age working in the
fields. AK slung over his shoulder. From all,
one hears the same message, echoing the
battle cry of the Republicans in the Spanish

Civil War: "No pasaran" — "They will not
pass."
Distributing all of these guns, and millions
of rounds of ammunition to go with them,
was an unprecedented act of faith on the
part of the Nicaraguan leadership. At first,
it was said, some military commanders did
not like the idea of so many weapons in the
hands of persons not subjected to direct mil
itary control and command. But now one
senses widespread pride and confidence in
the "people in arms." As one official said to
me. "Can you imagine the rulers in El Sal
vador or Guatemala doing something like
this? If they were crazy enough to try. they
wouldn't last a day."
The newly armed Nicaraguans are organ
ized into militia companies, civilian units
that receive military training, but whose
members continue to work in the fields, fac
tories and at home.
Despite shortcomings in militia training
and organization, the "people in arms" are
the revolution's first line of defense. Regu
lar units cannot possibly patrol hundreds of
miles of frontier, isolated towns and vast
stretches of coastline. Thus, of necessity,
militia men and women must fill the gap. and
to date, the system has worked well. Regular
army units have been used only when readily
available and needed.
The Nicaraguan defense effort is,
however, much more inclusive than what has
so far been deployed against the contras. If a
full-scale attack should come, whether from
neighboring coutries or the U.S. armed
forces, a long-term strategy for resistance
and eventual victory has been developed.

During November and December the final
touches were put on plans and preparations
that would allow the government to
withdraw from Managua, it necessary, and
reestablish itself in the mountainous areas
of the north that have traditionally been
the stronghold of resistance against invaders
and local tv rants.
Today, in these mountains, the basic in
frastructure of a government of "national

resistance" is in place. No hostile military
force has ever been able to penetrate these
mountains permanently, and the Nicaraguan
leadership is prepared to stay there and do
battle for years, if necessary, confident that
with the help of a well-armed and politically
well-prepared citizenry, they will eventually
drive the invaders from the fatherland.
One afternoon, while watching some col
leagues dig a combined trench and bomb
shelter. I asked a number of persons if they

really thought that the United Suites was
going to invade Nicaragua. "Do we really
have any choice but to act as it it were
true." said one. "Do we lessen the possibility
by being unprepared." said another with ob
vious irritation. "What will happen when
Reagan finally realizes that his exiled mer
cenaries can't conquer us. can't do more than
kill some peasants and burn some villages and
crops? Won't he then have to send in the
Marines and do what the contras can't."
added a third.
Nicaraguan officials add vet another argu
ment. With what is perhaps misplaced faith
in the rationality of the Pentagon, they
argue that massive preparations for the
defense ol Niceragua. including the prepara
tion for a prolonged guerrilla war against the
invaders, render such an invasion less
probable. After Vietnam, they hope that
the United States military appreciates the
difficulty, it not the impossibility of subdu
ing a people in arms, who are lighting on
their home terrain, and are willing to
struggle indefinitely, if necessary, to ex
haust and finally vanquish the invaders.
In somewhat ironic fashion, the ease with
which the United States walked over the
resistance in Grenada also supports the hy
pothesis of Pentagon rationality — while at
the same time continuing to fuel the
Nicaraguan defense effort. "If it took a
naval task force, the Marines, the U.S. Army
and a total of 16.000 men to subdue a hand
ful of Grenadians and a few hundred Cuban
workers with rifles, what will it take in
Nicaragua," asked one local official.

What Alberto called the "imperial designs"
of President Reagan thus take their toll at
home. In Grenada we lost our post-Vietnam
virginity. In Nicaragua and Central America
we may lose what is left of our soul as well.
