## Record-breaking victory for Card in Arizona 
### 
By ADAM BKRNS

Tempi', Ariz. — The Stanford basketball
team went record smashing again Saturday
night.
The Cardinal concluded its road sweep
of the Arizona schools by solidly beating
the University of Arizona 74-66. The vic
tory was Stanford's fourth straight con
ference victory after a 0-6 start and
boosted the Cardinal's record to 15-7,
while the Wildcats dropped to 5-13, 2-6 in
conference action.
Besides putting Stanford back into
serious contention for a possible National
Invitational Tournament (NI T) bid, Satur
day's victory against Arizona halted a se
ries of losing skids which had been building
up over decades of mediocrity.
• The victory against Arizona marked
Stanford's first road win against the
Wildcats inl9 years.
• A 19-year skid in which Stanford had not
won back-to-back weekend road games was
brought to an end.
• Saturday's win marked the first time in
10 years that Stanford has won four
straight conference games either at home
or away.
"It was a real good win," Stanford
Coach lorn Davis said after Saturday's
game. "Just all of the records that were
broken here. We did a real good job
tonight."
Stanford swingman Steve Brown scored
six ol Stanford's first 10 points to give
the Cardinal a lead which it never lost.
Brown ended the contest with 17 points
to lead all scorers, and also had four
rebounds, ending a brief shooting slump.

"I hadn't been shooting well lately,"
Brown admitted after the game. "I tried
to substitute myself a little more. When
I'm rested it helps my long shot."
Although the Wildcats did a fairly good
job of breaking Stanford's press, they were
never really able to exploit it for any easy
points.
"You don't get points for breaking the
press," Arizona Coach Lute Olsen said.
"You get it for putting the ball in the bas
ket. We rebounded well and played hard.
The only criticism I can have is putting the
ball in the basket."
Arizona, which closed the gap with Stan
ford to just six points at the end of the
half, pulled to within two points near the
start of the second period as the Wildcats
scored six of the first eight points in the
second half.
"I thought we got a little bit tired,"
Davis said. "We just got a little bit ex
hausted towards the end of the half."
Stanford came back, however, to score
the next eight consecutive points and led
by at least five points the rest of the way.
Center John Revelli said that one of the
problems was that Stanford started to
rush its shots.
"I just figured we had to get going with
our game — running and press," Revelli
said. "We were rushing too many shots and
not playing our game." Arizona started
playing more man-to-man defense near
the end of the game and Olsen was im
pressed by his team's defensive play and
the way that it handled itself. "We got
back in the game," he said. We didn't try
to get it all back at once."
Particularly effective for Arizona was

forward Eddie Smith who led the Wildcats
with 16 points and also hauled in a game
high 12 rebounds. Center Pete Williams
had 10 points and 10 rebound for Arizona.
Stanford had problems early rebounding
against a small but quick Arizona team but
did better on the boards late in the game
as Arizona outrebounded Stanford 42-38.
"We just had to get in our stance and
check somebody out." Revelli explained.
"We weren't doing a great job of it in the
first half."
Davis said after the game that he felt
Stanford has been shooting well and that
both Brown and forward Hans Wichary
have potential to be "great shooters."
Wichary had 10 points Saturday, going
5-for-8 from the field. Revelli, the na
tion's No. 2 field-goal percentage shooter,
also hit 5-for-8 field goals and had 13
points on the evening.
One of the keys against Arizona was
Stanford's success at the free throw line as
the Cardinal hit 26-of-35 free throws for
a .783 percentage while the Wildcats were
only 12-of-22 in their foul shots, a
percentage of only .545.
"I saw how effective that (shooting
free throws) was when I coached at
Lafayette," Davis said. "In my first year
there, my team led the nation in free
throw percentage. Both Revelli and
(Keith) Jones have been shooting well
from the line. John (Revelli) was in a slump
early. Now he has it back and he's about an
80-percent shooter from the line now."
"It's frustrating to us when the other
team shoots it up and makes it," Olsen

I Although talk is now start
ing again about Stanford's NIT
chances, Davis would prefer
not to talk about it yet. He did
mit, however, that an NIT
invitation would not be
caitside the realm of possibili
ties if Stanford continues to
win.

Arizona center Pete Wil
liams entered the contest as
the Pac-Io's leading rebounder
with 10.2 boards a contest. At
6-foot-7, he is the smallest
center in the league, about half
an inch shorter tlv.n Stanford's

John Paye with :25 left.
Stanford Associate Head
Coach Bruce Pearl acknowl
edged yesterday that the Car
dinal's top basketball recruit,
Richard Carr, has quit his high
school team due to personal
differences with his coach.
However, according to Pearl, it
does not affect his status at
Stanford and Carr continues to
practice on his own and in local
men's leagues.
