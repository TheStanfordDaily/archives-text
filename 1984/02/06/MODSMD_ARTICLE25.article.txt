# No luck in Ariz. for Card women
## 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
Tempe, Ariz. â€” For the
Stanford women's basket
ball team, Saturday's SS-49
loss to the Arizona Wildcats
was frustrating. Cardinal
I lead Coach Dotty McCrea
had another word for it.
"It was awful," McCrea
said following the game.
"Our intensity in the second
half was non-existent. I
don't know what I have to
do to give this team the mo
tivation to win."
The loss dropped Stan
ford to 3-IS, 0-7 in the
WC'AA Conference, while
Arizona got its first confer
ence victory.
For the first 10 minutes
of the game it looked like it
was going to be a blowout,
with Stanford doing the
blowing.
Led by the hot shooting
til senior Lee Ann Mar
gerum. the Cardinal jumped
out to a quick lead and
twice led by 12 points in the
first half, ending the period
seven points up on the
Wildcats, 30-23.

Arizona camc right back
in the second half, scoring
nine straight points. The
score was tied 32-32 on a
layin by Tannis Overturf.
She was fouled and con
verted the free throw for a
three-point pi ay.
Stanford came back to
score six straight points, but
then it was all the Wildcats
as Stanford scored just 13
points in the closing 12
minutes.
The loss overshadowed an
excellent performance by
Margeium who ended the
afternoon with 14 points,
10 of which came in the
first half.
"In the second half we
seemed to be playing in a
hurry-up offense," a disap
pointed McCrea said. "It
was one pass and shoot the
ball. 1 guess Arizona wanted
it more than we did."
Sophomore guard Kirsten
Smith and freshman for
ward Yolanda Turner led
the scoring for the Wildcats
with 14 points each. Both
also had five rebounds.
