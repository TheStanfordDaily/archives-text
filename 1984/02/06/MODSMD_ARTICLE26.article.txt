## Sluggers lose 2 of 3 games to Fuller ton

By ROB /WHIG
Cal State Fullerton's left fielder John Fishel
blasted a three-run home run and killed a late
Stanford rally with a spectacular defensive play
to lead the No. 7-ranked Titans to a 7-5 win
over Stanford yesterday at Sunken Diamond.
The victory capped a successful season
opening series for Fullerton, who took two of
three games from the sixth-rated Cardinal, now
5-2.
Stanford had a 5-3 advantage in the seesaw
contest when senior Fishel took control. Con
secutive singles by Fullerton's Jose Mota and
Kirk Bates chased freshman right-hander Rick
Diet? from the Cardinal mound in favor of ace
reliever Jeff Ballard. Ballard promptly got two
baffled batters to strike out on breaking balls.
Fishel was in for the same fate until the Card's
senior left hander tried .to sneak a 1-2 fastball
by him. Fishel had another idea, however, and
sent Ballard's offering over the second fence in
deep left field, just inside the foul pole.
"(Fishel) had a good day," said relaxed Fuller
ton Head Coach Augie Garrido. "He's been a
starter since a freshman and he's had a lot a big
hits for us."
The Titans picked up an unearned run in the
top of the eighth inning to boost their lead to
7-5 before Stanford mounted a comeback in the
bottom half of the inning.
With runners on first and second and only one
out, junior Pete Stanicek hit a line shot into left
field for what looked like a run-scoring single.
But Fishel raced over to make a diving grab of

the sinking liner and then doubled up lead runner
Ruben Amaro who was running on the 3-2 pitch
"lt's a do-or-die play," said Cardinal Head
Coach Mark Marquess afterward in assessing Fis
hers gamble which could have been disastorous.
"If he doesn't make it, we've got a tie game
with a runner on second."
The play seemed fitting in a superbly played
contest that ended a frustrating afternoon for
the Card, which is still having its problems at the
plate.
"We hit into five double plays and didn't get
the big hit when we needed it," lamented
Marquess. Although Stanford collected twelve
hits on the afternoon, it stranded 10 runners on
base.
On the other side of the diamond, Garrido
was happie;. "Yesterday, 1 felt we were beaten
in three categories, offensively, defensively and
character" he said. "1 think our players did a
good job in showing their character today."
He was referring to the 7-1 shellacking his
Titans had received on Saturday afternoon,
when Stanford's John Radtke breezed nine in
nings to chalk up his second straight impressive
victory against no losses.
Surprisingly, Radtke hurled all nine innings in
just his second start of the young season. "I just
throw as hard as I can for as long as I can. For
tunately, today I went nine innings. The key was
that when I got tired I was able to hit the cor
ners," said Radtke.
Radtke and the Cardinal got a big lift from

ting and was 7-for-12 overall in the three-game series played
in Sunken Diamond.
the bat of designated hitter Greg Lorenzetti
who went two for four at the plate and knocked
in four runs. Three of those RBIs came when
Lorenzetti powered right-hander Todd Sim
mons' high slider into the trees beyond the left
field fence to give Stanford a 3-0 lead after two
innings.
F> Marquess was clearly pleased about the Card's
first legitimate home run in 1984 after Stan
ford blasted 81 a year ago. "That was obviously a
big hit," said the Cardinal skipper. "We need
(Lorenzetti) to hit for us. He's got a lot of
power and he's got to supply the home runs we
need."
Mark Davis also chipped in with a three-for
three afternoon for the Card which rapped out
10 hits. Stanford tallied solo runs in four differ
ent innings.
On Friday, Fullerton won a tense 5-4 contest
when Mota, the son of former Los Angeles
Dodger Manny Mota, looped a single to right

field in the seventh inning to score Mike Halasz
from second base.
That run spoiled Stanford's comeback from an
early 4-0 deficit and a stellar relief effort by the
Cardinal's David Harris. The big right-hander
hander, who was 7-0 as a freshman before falling
on hard times last year, hurled five and a third
innings of three-hit ball before yielding to Bal
lard in the fateful seventh. As luck would have
it, Harris (0-1) was charged with the loss because
he allowed the winning run to reach base.
"That's the way it goes," quipped Harris, who
feels he has returned to his frosh form.
Marquess concurred saying, "Harris pitched well
enough to get the win. It was a good outing for
him."
It was not a good outing for starter Brian
Myers though. He was shelled for two home runs
and four runs in just an inning and a third. After
Myers' departure, Stanford inched back to tie
the game with a run in each of the next four in
nings before Mota's winning RBI.
Stanford will host Fresno State at 2 p.m.
today. Kevin Kunkel will start against the Bul
ldogs, 10-2 losers to Long Beach State on Satur
day.

from second base.
That run spoiled Stanford's comeback from an
early 4-0 deficit and a stellar relief effort by the
Cardinal's David Harris. The big right-hander
hander, who was 7-0 as a freshman before falling
on hard times last year, hurled five and a third
innings of three-hit ball before yielding to Bal
lard in the fateful seventh. As luck would have
it, Harris (0-1) was charged with the loss because
he allowed the winning run to reach base.
"That's the way it goes," quipped Harris, who
feels he has returned to his frosh form.
Marquess concurred saying, "Harris pitched well
enough to get the win. It was a good outing for
him."
It was not a good outing for starter Brian
Myers though. He was shelled for two home runs
and four runs in just an inning and a third. After
Myers' departure, Stanford inched back to tie
the game with a run in each of the next four in
nings before Mota's winning RBI.
Stanford will host Fresno State at 2 p.m.
today. Kevin Kunkel will start against the Bul
ldogs, 10-2 losers to Long Beach State on Satur
day.

Cal State Fullerton's left fielder John Fishel
blasted a three-run home run and killed a late
Stanford rally with a spectacular defensive play
to lead the No. 7-ranked Titans to a 7-5 win
over Stanford yesterday at Sunken Diamond.
The victory capped a successful season
opening series for Fullerton, who took two of
three games from the sixth-rated Cardinal, now
5-2.
Stanford had a 5-3 advantage in the seesaw
contest when senior Fishel took control. Con
secutive singles by Fullerton's Jose Mota and
Kirk Bates chased freshman right-hander Rick
Diet? from the Cardinal mound in favor of ace
reliever Jeff Ballard. Ballard promptly got two
baffled batters to strike out on breaking balls.
Fishel was in for the same fate until the Card's
senior left hander tried .to sneak a 1-2 fastball
by him. Fishel had another idea, however, and
sent Ballard's offering over the second fence in
deep left field, just inside the foul pole.
"(Fishel) had a good day," said relaxed Fuller
ton Head Coach Augie Garrido. "He's been a
starter since a freshman and he's had a lot a big
hits for us."
The Titans picked up an unearned run in the
top of the eighth inning to boost their lead to
7-5 before Stanford mounted a comeback in the
bottom half of the inning.
With runners on first and second and only one
out, junior Pete Stanicek hit a line shot into left
field for what looked like a run-scoring single.
But Fishel raced over to make a diving grab of

the sinking liner and then doubled up lead runner
Ruben Amaro who was running on the 3-2 pitch
"lt's a do-or-die play," said Cardinal Head
Coach Mark Marquess afterward in assessing Fis
hers gamble which could have been disastorous.
"If he doesn't make it, we've got a tie game
with a runner on second."
The play seemed fitting in a superbly played
contest that ended a frustrating afternoon for
the Card, which is still having its problems at the
plate.
"We hit into five double plays and didn't get
the big hit when we needed it," lamented
Marquess. Although Stanford collected twelve
hits on the afternoon, it stranded 10 runners on
base.
On the other side of the diamond, Garrido
was happie;. "Yesterday, 1 felt we were beaten
in three categories, offensively, defensively and
character" he said. "1 think our players did a
good job in showing their character today."
He was referring to the 7-1 shellacking his
Titans had received on Saturday afternoon,
when Stanford's John Radtke breezed nine in
nings to chalk up his second straight impressive
victory against no losses.
Surprisingly, Radtke hurled all nine innings in
just his second start of the young season. "I just
throw as hard as I can for as long as I can. For
tunately, today I went nine innings. The key was
that when I got tired I was able to hit the cor
ners," said Radtke.
Radtke and the Cardinal got a big lift from

who went two for four at the plate and knocked
in four runs. Three of those RBIs came when
Lorenzetti powered right-hander Todd Sim
mons' high slider into the trees beyond the left
field fence to give Stanford a 3-0 lead after two
innings.
F> Marquess was clearly pleased about the Card's
first legitimate home run in 1984 after Stan
ford blasted 81 a year ago. "That was obviously a
big hit," said the Cardinal skipper. "We need
(Lorenzetti) to hit for us. He's got a lot of
power and he's got to supply the home runs we
need."
Mark Davis also chipped in with a three-for
three afternoon for the Card which rapped out
10 hits. Stanford tallied solo runs in four differ
ent innings.
On Friday, Fullerton won a tense 5-4 contest
when Mota, the son of former Los Angeles
Dodger Manny Mota, looped a single to right

field in the seventh inning to score Mike Halasz
from second base.
That run spoiled Stanford's comeback from an
early 4-0 deficit and a stellar relief effort by the
