By ROB /WHIG
Cal State Fullerton's left fielder John Fishel
blasted a three-run home run and killed a late
Stanford rally with a spectacular defensive play
to lead the No. 7-ranked Titans to a 7-5 win
over Stanford yesterday at Sunken Diamond.
The victory capped a successful season
opening series for Fullerton, who took two of
three games from the sixth-rated Cardinal, now
5-2.
Stanford had a 5-3 advantage in the seesaw
contest when senior Fishel took control. Con
secutive singles by Fullerton's Jose Mota and
Kirk Bates chased freshman right-hander Rick
Diet? from the Cardinal mound in favor of ace
reliever Jeff Ballard. Ballard promptly got two
baffled batters to strike out on breaking balls.
Fishel was in for the same fate until the Card's
senior left hander tried .to sneak a 1-2 fastball
by him. Fishel had another idea, however, and
sent Ballard's offering over the second fence in
deep left field, just inside the foul pole.
"(Fishel) had a good day," said relaxed Fuller
ton Head Coach Augie Garrido. "He's been a
starter since a freshman and he's had a lot a big
hits for us."
The Titans picked up an unearned run in the
top of the eighth inning to boost their lead to
7-5 before Stanford mounted a comeback in the
bottom half of the inning.
With runners on first and second and only one
out, junior Pete Stanicek hit a line shot into left
field for what looked like a run-scoring single.
But Fishel raced over to make a diving grab of

the sinking liner and then doubled up lead runner
Ruben Amaro who was running on the 3-2 pitch
"lt's a do-or-die play," said Cardinal Head
Coach Mark Marquess afterward in assessing Fis
hers gamble which could have been disastorous.
"If he doesn't make it, we've got a tie game
with a runner on second."
The play seemed fitting in a superbly played
contest that ended a frustrating afternoon for
the Card, which is still having its problems at the
plate.
"We hit into five double plays and didn't get
the big hit when we needed it," lamented
Marquess. Although Stanford collected twelve
hits on the afternoon, it stranded 10 runners on
base.
On the other side of the diamond, Garrido
was happie;. "Yesterday, 1 felt we were beaten
in three categories, offensively, defensively and
character" he said. "1 think our players did a
good job in showing their character today."
He was referring to the 7-1 shellacking his
Titans had received on Saturday afternoon,
when Stanford's John Radtke breezed nine in
nings to chalk up his second straight impressive
victory against no losses.
Surprisingly, Radtke hurled all nine innings in
just his second start of the young season. "I just
throw as hard as I can for as long as I can. For
tunately, today I went nine innings. The key was
that when I got tired I was able to hit the cor
ners," said Radtke.
