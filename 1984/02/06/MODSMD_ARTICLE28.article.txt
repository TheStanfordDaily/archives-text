### MICHAEL LLERANDI 
The Stanford men's swim
team, away at USC and UCLA
this weekend, continued to
show why it holds the country's
No. 1-ranking by defeating
USC, bl-52. and powering past
UCLA, 6S-43.
The USC meet was viewed as
an opportunity for the Car
dinal to swim events other
than its strong ones, "Our
schedule on Friday was a very
awkward one.'" noted Head
Coach Skip Kenney, "mainly
because we had to prepare early
in the morning before catching
our flight. Also, this is the
time of year when we are ex

trcmely broken down physi
cally, and therefore more
susceptible to sickness."
Three of the top swimmers
for Stanford — Sam Worden.
Ricky Bodor and Carter Cast
were unable to make the
trip due to illness, while Dave
Bottom had to miss the USC
contest for the same reason.
While the USC meet was
marked by an unexpectedly
close score, the Cardinal men
made an abrupt turnaround
Saturday at UCLA.
The victory over the Bruins
was a particularly sweet one
for Kenney and his crew be
cause it was the first time

UCLA Head Coach Ron Bal
latore had ever lost a dual at
home.
"The guys knew how exciting
that win would be for the
whole program. Anytime you
can beat one of the best teams
in the country so soundly, espe
cially on the road, it makes
everyone around here feel
good."
"We put together our best
lineup lor Saturday, and all day
long our guys were swimming
well," junior backstroker Bot
tom said. "The meet wasn't as
close as we thought it would
be. mainly because every time
we needed someone to pull

through tor us. they did the
job."
The Card continued to show
their dominance in the distance
freestyle events, and also dis
played their power in the but
terfly . individual medley, and
breaststroke events. Once
again, however, it was Stan
turd's overall balance that was
to make the difference.
Senior Charlie Johnson
didn't think anyone "had an
overall bad meet. With our
kind of balance, we aren't de
pendent upon one or two guys
to pull us along anymore.
That's what you need to w in an
NCAA championship."
