# University rehires Edwards in new Housing Facilities position
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Heloisa Edwards, the Row Facilities
manager who was fired in November, has
been re-hired by the University — but she
will no longer be working with students.
Edwards has been appointed to a newly
created position as manager of special proj
ects at the Housing Facilities Office, a job
she says will entail putting the "finishing
touch" on University facilities.
"What breaks my heart most is being away
from a position where I can work closely
with students," Edwards said, "although I
still have a lot of friends here and a lot of
student support." She added that she plans
to compensate for her distance from stu
dents by becoming involved in several stu

dent groups.
According to Edwards, the appointment
came after a Dec. 15 preliminary grievance
hearing about her termination. In the
hearing, she w;is supported by Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons, but in the end
the hearing officer decided in favor of the
management.
"He decided the management was right in
terminating me, but at the same time he
wrote a letter to the University that said
that during the hearing, the testimony made
by students showed that I was interested in
providing a high level of service to the Uni
versity. The University then told me that
when Jason Mavis (then director of Facilities
and Services) left his position, 1 could have
an interview with his successor."

Lyons said that his role during the griev
ance hearing was to "assure that Edwards
received fair and equitable treatment."
Lyons said he did not know Edwards very
well but had admired her work in the past,
and felt that she had a legitimate reason to
file a grievance.
"The way I see it, it wasn't at all clear why
she was fired," Lyons said. He added that he
was "very pleased with the outcome," and
understood why Edwards could not go back
to her old job.
"When someone's fired and they grieve,
it's often a separation that's very difficult
to put back together," he explained.
Edwards said that Amy Blue, the new
director of Facilities and Services, rehired
Heloisa as her first act in her new position.

"I'm delighted to be working with Amy
Blue," Edwards said, "It's a pleasure to work
with a woman and a competent individual."
Edwards' old position remains empty, and
she was re-hired "as if 1 had never left." with
benefits and vacation pay. One month's
salary was withheld, she explained, "as a
reminder to me that I wasn't totally right in
what I did."
Edwards said what she did — use the Row
Facilities truck and Row funds to staff a
Physicians for Social Resposibility confer
ence in the fall — is a background issue at
this point.
"I see no reason to dwell on the past," she
said. Her grievance charges focused more
around discrimination against sex and race
then around the actual reason given for her

termination. Had she not been reinstated at
this point, Edwards said she planned to go
into outside arbitration.
"The University has a list of five lawyers
experienced in outside labor arbitration.
she said, "and then I'd have to start all over
again."
Edwards said that she had "intentions ot
going all the way to the top," ultimately ap
pealing directly to University President
Donald Kennedy if she needed to go that
far. She added, however, that she did not
feel her reinstatement had anything to do
with her intention to go into arbitration.
"I dor't think the University acted the
way it did out of coercion," Edwards said.
"Rather, they realized they were mistaken in
terminating me."
