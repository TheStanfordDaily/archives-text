The men's tennis team didn't bring
home a gold medal from Los Angeles
this weekend, but it did fly away with a
silver second-place finish in the Nation
al Team Championships.
Fifth-seeded UCLA relied on talent,
home-court advantage and crowd sup
port to post a 6-3 triumph over Stan
ford in yesterday's final. The Card's top
four singles players suffered straight
set losses, paving the way for UCLA's
drive to the tournament crown. Ironi
cally, Stanford won its earlier rounds
due largely to strong, consistent singles
play.
Stanford's first singles man Dan
Goldie started off the morning with a
6-3, 6-4 loss to Jeff Klaparda. Jim
Grabb (No. 2), Eric Rosenfeld (No. 3)
and John Letts (No. 4) followed in
Goldie's footsteps. UCLA's Mike
Kurez defeated Grabb 7-6, 6-2; Mark
Basham downed Rosenfeld 6-2, 6-2 and

Chuck Willenborg stunned Letts 6-0, 6-
3.
The Card saved some face, picking up
singles wins at the fifth and sixth posi
tions. Derrick Rostagno fought back to
edge Craig Venter 7-5, 2-6, 6-2 and
Mark McKeen dominated Dave
Livingston 7-5, 6-2.
Grabb and Letts avenged their earlier
losses and teamed up to defeat Kurez
and Basham 7-5, 7-6 in the doubles
competition. Unfortunately, Stan
ford's momentum quickly shifted as
UCLA returned to winning form in the
remaining two doubles matches. Goldie
and Rosenfeld folded to Jim Pugh and
Livingston 7-6, 6-1; McKeen and Ros
tagno fell victims to the Klaparda-
Venter team 6-2, 6-1.
Head Coach Dick Gould said that his
team did not play up to its potential in
the tournament. "Amongst ourselves
we are further ahead than we were last
year at this time, but we still have a lot
of work to do," he said
Gould continued, "It's a rationaliza

tion to say that since we took a second
place without playing our best against
top competitors, we could do much bet
ter when we do play up to par. But if we
work, we will definitely be a factor."
USC, currently ranked second to
Stanford in the national poll, finished
third after losing to UCLA 5-4 in a
nail-biting semifinal match. Trinity
placed fourth in the tournament.
First-seeded Stanford gained a berth
in the finals after eliminating Harvard
on Friday and Clemson on Saturday.
The Card reddened Harvard's Crimson
with an embarrassing 8-1 rout. The Eas
tern powerhouse was out of its league
in sunny Southern California, and Stan
ford's tough singles lineup swept all six
matches. Harvard's top doubles team.
Dave Beckman and Rob Lowd,
surprised Grabb and Letts 4-6, 6-1, 6-3
to give the Crimson its only win.
Stanford will host San Diego State
Thursday at 1:30 p.m.
