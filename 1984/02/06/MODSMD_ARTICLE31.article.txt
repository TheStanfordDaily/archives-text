### CLINT HIGHFILL Staff writer 
Radiology Prof. Henry Kaplan,
an internationally renowned
radiologist and cancer research
pioneer from the School of
Medicine, died at his home Satur
day after a five-month bout with
cancer.
Kaplan. 65. underwent surgery
for removal of a lung tumor last
October. He was a non-smoker.
Kaplan was "one of the most il
lustrious members of the Stan
ford faculty," according to
Ronald Castellino. director of
diagnostic radiology. He joined
the School of Medicine as a pro
fessor and chairman of the De
partment of Radiology in 1948, a
position he held until 1972.
In recent years Kaplan held the
Maureen L.yles D'Ambrogio
professorship, directed the Mayer
Cancer Biology Laboratory and
examined patients in the Stan
ford clinic.
Kaplan was best known for his
contributions to clinical medicine,
and as the co-inventor of the first
medical linear accelerator in the
Western hemisphere.
Judging correctly that the ef
fectiveness of radiation treat
ment was limited by the crude and
low-powered X-ray machines then
available, Kaplan suggested in the
early 1950s that the linear ac
celerator might be adapted for
cancer therapy.
The linear accelerator shoots
particles down a tube to an
atomic target. When the beam of
particles collides with the target.

controlled bursts of radiation can
be delivered to areas of tumor
growth in the body.
Today, medical linear ac
celerators are the cornerstone of
radiation therapy. The machines
are found in cancer treatment
centers and hospitals worldwide,
and Kaplan's pioneenng work in
radiation therapy led to notable
gains in treating a wide variety of
cancers.
However, his most incredible
gains were in treating Hodgkin's
disease, a cancer of the lymphatic
system. In association with Dr.
Saul Rosenberg and other col
leagues, Kaplan devised an ag
gressive diagnosis and treatment
combining radiation, chemo
therapy and surgery which has
turned Hodgkin's disease from a
hopeless illness to a more than 80-

percent curable disease.
Throughout his career. Kaplan
earned a reputation as an influen
tial critic of the Medical School
and University administration.
Among his many battles was to
get the University to recruit out
standing faculty leaders for the
Medical School after its 1959
relocation from San Francisco.
Among them were Arthur
Kornberg and Joshua Lederberg.
The two received Nobel prizes,
"and because of that," Kaplan
said in rare interview before his
death, "Stanford was catapulted
literally from a second or third
rate medical school into some kind
of mysterious but very exciting
place that students thought of in
the context of Harvard."
Because of greater emphasis on
research. Stanford soon joined the

ranks of a do/en or so medical
schools generally regarded as set
ting the pace in American medical
education.
Many of Kaplan's contributions
to the school were at a more per
sonal level. "He was a mentor to
literally hundreds of people." Cas
tellino said, "really an inspiration
to a number of young doctors and
Ph.D. candidates." lie recognized
the limitations of others less bril
liant than he. but helped them
and encouraged them to do the
best they could. Castellino said.
Last December, recognizing
Kaplan as an "exemplary teacher,
a world-renowned scientist and a
distinguished, caring physician."
the Board of Trustees approved a
resolution creating the Henry
Kaplan Professorship in Cancer
Biology.
He is survived by his wife. Leah,
director of the Stanford Help
Center, and their two grown
children. Ann and Paul.
Memorial services will be held
from 3 to 4 p.m., Sunday at Fair
child Auditorium in the School of
Medicine.
The family would prefer
memorial contributions to be
made to the Henry Seymour
Kaplan Professorship in Cancer
Biology or to the Henry S. Kaplan
Commemorative Sculpture â€” a
tribute to his contributions to sci
ence and medicine. Checks can be
sent to the Development Office
of the School of Medicine. 780
