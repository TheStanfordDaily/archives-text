During The National Conference of Business
and Media held at Tresidder Union here Satur
day, Morley Safer of TV's "60 Minutes" got a
chance to meet with Mobil Oil President William
Tavoulareas in the board room instead of the
battle field.
An impartial observer might wonder if there
would be more understanding between the cor
porate heads and reporters if each could see
how the "other half" operates. According to
Richard Clurman, chairman of the board of
Media and Society Seminars, such was the inspira
tion for the Saturday conference.

"We wanted to put people into a real situation
— where the only way out was to think," Clur
man said. In order to do this, he explained, two
panels of 20 businessmen and journalists were as
sembled and given hypothetical problems to
solve. Each group had a moderator — the first
was led by Harvard Law Prof. Arthur Miller and
the second by Stanford Law Prof. John Kaplan.
Each hypothetical involved a potential news
paper story about a business scandal. Journalists
such as Safer and Rolling Stone Editor David
Rosenthal had to play roles creating the mock
story. Tavoulareas, Seagrams Chairman Edgar
Bronfman and other businessmen gave them
their reaction to the story.

According to Safer, the conference went well,
but nothing surprising or unusual was discussed.
"I've attended six of these so far," he said, "and
after six they get to be about the same."
Observers at the conference voiced two com
plaints — they said that certain panelists
dominated the discussions and that there were
only three women among 40 panelists.
Clurman said that the seminar, which cost
about $350,000 to produce, was the 90th session
of the 10-year-old Media and Society program.
Other sessions have been held at schools including
Columbia University in New York and UCLA,
and the topics have included Media and Foriegn
Policy and Media and the Law.
