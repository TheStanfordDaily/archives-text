# Former ambassador assails 'brutal' Soviets
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
San Francisco — Malcolm Toon,
former U.S. ambassador to the
Soviet Union, said Friday that re
lations between the two super
powers have frayed seriously but
that the United States' share of
the blame is "infinitesimal."
At a talk here entitled
"Superpower Relations." Toon
said the relationship between the
Soviet Union and the United
States is at its "lowest ebb prob
ably since the worst days of the
Cold War."
Toon, who served as ambassador
from 1976-79 under President
Carter, attributed the confronta
tional atmosphere to the So\ iets
expanionist foreign policy and
repressive domestic policy
Describing the Soviet Union as
a "ruthless brutal power, the
former diplomat drew a good deal
of laughter and a sprinkling ot ap
plause from the crowd at the
Sheraton Palace Hotel when he
capped his analysis ot the Soviet
Union on a humorous note.
"Dealing with the Soviet threat
is like making love to a gorilla, he
said. "You can only quit when the
gorilla is tired."
According to Toon, the Soviet
Union will not become more con
ciliatory until the memory ot the
October Revolution has taded. in

about 40 or 50 years. In the
meantime. Toon said, the United
States "must recast its ap
proach."
In his talk the former ambassa
dor outlined a plan which
emphasizes dealing with the

Soviets in a businesslike manner.
He said he had proposed a similar
plan to Carter but the president
chose not to follow the advice.
Toon said Yuri Andropov's rise
to power had led many observers
to liope that U.S.-Soviet relations
would improve. Yet the Korean
Air Lines incident, the nuclear
arms buildup, the Soviet presence
in Afghanistan and Poland, and the
alleged Soviet use of biological
and chemical warfare have instead
caused relations to plummet.
He said until basic Soviet atti

tudes and policies change, the
United States must develop a
"working relationship free of all
emotion." While recognizing the
Soviet Union as a hostile power
ever ready to consolidate — par
ticularly in the Third World — the

United States should refrain from
emulating the Soviet's worst
traits. "Relations should be for
mal and businesslike." he said.
Toon praised President Reagan
for his recent speech which he said
signaled a turnaround in rhetoric.
He said the previous rhetoric of
Reagan, who described the Soviets
as "thieves" and "liars" and who
added to relations the quality of a
"holy war." unquestionably ag
gravated the superpower conflict.
In his "recasted approach."
Toon said the L'nited States

should formulate specifically
worded agreements with the
Soviets, should possess a proper
military defense, should
strengthen NATO and should
pursue a clearly defined program
to contain Soviet expansionism.
"Any policy that we promote
must be made credible by a proper
military defense," Toon said. Yet
the former ambassador qualified
his endorsement of a strong
defense by describing Reagan's
multi-year defense buildup as
"profligate."
Toon said that the United
States must prevent the es
tablishment of Soviet military
strength around the globe, as it
did in Grenada. He cautioned,
however, that most Third World
problems stem not from Soviet
military intervention but rather
from social and indigenous roots.
He also said that because of
Andropov's disappearance from
the Soviet scene, "collective lead
ership is now the modus operandi
in the Politburo."
"But the charade cannot go on
forever." he said. Calling the So
viet leader the "Ling-l.ing of the
Kremlin." because he has
remained sick and absent from
public view like the famous panda.
Toon said he expects Andropov to
surface soon.
