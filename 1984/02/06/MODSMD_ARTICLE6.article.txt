# Demo. convention boosts Jackson bid
## 
### DOUG HOHBACH 
Oakland — Presidential contender
the Rev. Jesse Jackson's campaign
received a strategic boost here this
weekend at the California Demo
cratic Party Convention when state
Party Chairman Peter Kelly decided
to allow a candidate to send
delegates to the national convention
after receiving 10 percent of the
votes in a district. The previous
threshold was 20 percent.
This decision, which must be ap
proved by the national party appara
tus, could help Jackson's campaign by
eliminating some of the power over
delegates front-running candidates
have. In recent nationwide polls Jack
son has received more than 10 but
less than 20 percent support.
California sends about 10 percent
of the total delegates to the conven
tion. which will be held in San Fran
cisco next July, and with backing
from at least some of the state's
delegation Jackson could challenge
party rules he opposes with a
stronger voice.
Although none of the eight
presidential candidates attended the
affair, which was held at the recently
completed Oakland Convention Cen
ter. much of the talk focused on the
national race and President Reagan.
Former Sen. John Tunney (D-
Calif.) called on Reagan, who

recently announced his plans to run
for re-election, to retire instead to
his Santa Barbara ranch, where he
could "punch cows instead of poor
people," while Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-
Md.) said that "any working man who
votes for Ronald Reagan in is
like a chicken voting for Colonel
Sanders."
California issues discussed included
the animal research bill sponsored by
state Sen. David Roberti (D-Los An
geles). Roberti defended his bill,
which would prohibit the use of
pound animals in scientific research,
by saying that "animals shouldn't die
in terror." Roberti's bill is opposed
by Stanford and other research uni
\crsitics in the state. This would in
crease the cost of animal research,
Roberti said, and thus would encour
age scientists to find "alternatives
to animal use" in research.
l.ast Monday the state Assembly
passed a bill supported by Stanford
that would have permitted the lim
ited use of pound animals in research,
but the measure faces an uphill fight
in the Senate because Roberti is its
presiding officer.
The proposed Reagan library com
plex here also received attention.
Tunnev attacked the proposal, saying
that "even great universities like
Stanford make mistakes."
