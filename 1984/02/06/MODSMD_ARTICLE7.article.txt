Feldstein to stay on as adviser
Washington — Martin Feldstein has no intention of
resigning his post as chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers, despite the controversy within the
Reagan administration over Feldstein's views on the presi
dent's new budget, a council spokesman said yesterday.
And Feldstein still plans to testify fours days this week
at budget hearings in Capitol Hill, beginning with an ap
pearance today before the Democratic-controlled House
Budget Committee, the spokesman said.
Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush, seeking to
smooth over the dispute over Feldstein's outspoken warn
ings on the potential dangers of the budget's projected
deficits, said President Reagan retains confidence in his
chief economist and denied that the internal squabbling
signaled disarray in the administration's economic policies.
The president, arriving back at the White House from a
weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.,
was asked by a reporter if he wanted Feldstein to quit.
Reagan replied: "I can't take any questions."
Satellite found in wrong orbit
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — The Westar VI satellite, which
was lost after being launched from the space shuttle Chal
lenger, was found yesterday "completely healthy" but in
the wrong orbit, leading officials to call it "a total loss."
A ground station in California succeeded in changing the
satellite's position so that its batteries could charge from
the sun's energy, said Bill Zeigler, a spokesman for Western
Union, which owns Westar VI.
"As far as we know, we have a spacecraft (satellite)
that's in the wrong orbit that's completely healthy," he
said.
However, there was not hope of raising the satellite to
its planned 22,300-mile-high orbit where it would be sta
tionary above earth, he said. The most that can be hoped
for is that "we might get a few hours twice a day,"he said.
"In the parlance of cars, I think it's a total loss."
The satellite, representing a $75 million investment by
Western Union, was ejected from the shuttle's cargo bay
Friday. The loss was insured, the company said.
"There was no evidence of any damage to the spacecraft"
and the failure apparently was in the rocket that was to
carry it to geosynchronous orbit, he said. The satellite has
separated from the rocket, called a Payload Assist Module,
he said.
Power plant charged with
massive safety violations
San Luis Obispo — The Diablo Canyon atomic power
plant, a major embarrassment to the nuclear industry since
it was discovered on the eve of its scheduled operation that
reversed blueprints were used to calculate its ability to
withstand an earthquake, is under new charges that it was
built in "massive" violation of federal safety regulations.
With the Nuclear Regulatory Commission set to vote
Feb. 17 on restoring Diablo Canyon's operating license,
which was revoked in the wake of the 1981 debacle, Pacific
Gas & Electric Co. insists that the huge twin-reactor proj
ect it launched 17 years ago finally is ready to start produc
ing electricity.
The NRC regional office in Walnut Creek, just outside
San Francisco, has been swamped in recent weeks by a flood
of allegations from more than 20 present and former proj
ect workers charging that a major quality-control break
down occurred during construction of the plant.
. Though Diablo Canyon is only the latest on a growing list
of nuclear projects rocked by employee charges of design
and construction errors, the new allegations here are viewed
as yet another chapter in what many consider a textbook
case of how not to build an atomic power plant.
Grenadian leader ends exile
St. George's, Grenada — Eric Gairy, the flamboyant
Grenadian leader still following what he calls divine guid
ance, has returned to the island in the wake of U.S. invasion
forces and set out to revive his controversial political magic.
Gairy's return, for the first time since young revolution
aries overthrew his despotic rule in March 1979, marks an
acute embarrassment for the United States, according to
diplomats familiar with the problem.
Although Reagan administration officials tried to dis
courage him from coming, it was U.S. military intervention
that dissolved the Marxist leadership here and made Gairy's
reemergence on the Grenadian stage possible, they point
out.
Never one to forget a favor, Gairy has joined the chorus
of those proposing that Grenada's much-discussed new air
port be named after President Reagan when it is com
pleted.
Reagan denounced the airport as a security threat when
Grenada was friendly with Cuba, but U.S. officials now
agree that it should be finished, without ruling out a con
tribution of U.S. funds.
U.S. to continue Honduran
military maneuvers until 1988
Tegucigalpa, Honduras — The U.S. armed forces say they
are planning to hold regular military maneuvers in Honduras
through 1988, a U.S. senator said yesterday after two days
of talks with U.S. military officials here.
In addition to two exercises planned for 1984, the U.S.
military intends to stage one or two sets of exercises in each
of the following four years, aides to the senator quoted the
U.S. military officials as saying. Each of the maneuvers
would last several months, possibly as many as six, they said.
The disclosure by Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) provided the
most specific account so far of the Reagan administration's
plans for an extended military presence in Honduras. Con
gressional critics of the reported U.S. plans are preparing to
propose legislation barring maneuvers following the six
month-long Big Pine 2 exercise scheduled to end formally
Wednesday.
Former Reagan officials work
in his re-election bid
Washington — At least two former high-ranking Reagan
administration officials who left under a cloud are working
to re-elect the president, and a third is helping write the
platform on which Reagan will run.
Jim Lake, spokesman for the Reagan-Bush campaign, said
former Interior Secretary James Watt and the ClA's one
time spy chief, Max Hugel are working as volunteers in the
re-election effort. And Reagan's first national security ad
viser, Richard Allen, is a paid consultant to the Republican
National Committee, where officials said he is helping
draft the foreign policy section of the GOP platform.
Watt, whose 2-and-one-half years of stewardship of the
nation's public lands and natural resources had been swirled
in controversy, is not a regular member of the re-election
committee. Lake said. But he added that campaign director
Ed Rollins "has said he wiil use him in any way he can."

Feldstein to stay on as adviser
Washington — Martin Feldstein has no intention of
resigning his post as chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers, despite the controversy within the
Reagan administration over Feldstein's views on the presi
dent's new budget, a council spokesman said yesterday.
And Feldstein still plans to testify fours days this week
at budget hearings in Capitol Hill, beginning with an ap
pearance today before the Democratic-controlled House
Budget Committee, the spokesman said.
Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush, seeking to
smooth over the dispute over Feldstein's outspoken warn
ings on the potential dangers of the budget's projected
deficits, said President Reagan retains confidence in his
chief economist and denied that the internal squabbling
signaled disarray in the administration's economic policies.
The president, arriving back at the White House from a
weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.,
was asked by a reporter if he wanted Feldstein to quit.
Reagan replied: "I can't take any questions."
Satellite found in wrong orbit
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — The Westar VI satellite, which
was lost after being launched from the space shuttle Chal
lenger, was found yesterday "completely healthy" but in
the wrong orbit, leading officials to call it "a total loss."
A ground station in California succeeded in changing the
satellite's position so that its batteries could charge from
the sun's energy, said Bill Zeigler, a spokesman for Western
Union, which owns Westar VI.
"As far as we know, we have a spacecraft (satellite)
that's in the wrong orbit that's completely healthy," he
said.
However, there was not hope of raising the satellite to
its planned 22,300-mile-high orbit where it would be sta
tionary above earth, he said. The most that can be hoped
for is that "we might get a few hours twice a day,"he said.
"In the parlance of cars, I think it's a total loss."
The satellite, representing a $75 million investment by
Western Union, was ejected from the shuttle's cargo bay
Friday. The loss was insured, the company said.
"There was no evidence of any damage to the spacecraft"
and the failure apparently was in the rocket that was to
carry it to geosynchronous orbit, he said. The satellite has
separated from the rocket, called a Payload Assist Module,
he said.
Power plant charged with
massive safety violations
San Luis Obispo — The Diablo Canyon atomic power
plant, a major embarrassment to the nuclear industry since
it was discovered on the eve of its scheduled operation that
reversed blueprints were used to calculate its ability to
withstand an earthquake, is under new charges that it was
built in "massive" violation of federal safety regulations.
With the Nuclear Regulatory Commission set to vote
Feb. 17 on restoring Diablo Canyon's operating license,
which was revoked in the wake of the 1981 debacle, Pacific
Gas & Electric Co. insists that the huge twin-reactor proj
ect it launched 17 years ago finally is ready to start produc
ing electricity.
The NRC regional office in Walnut Creek, just outside
San Francisco, has been swamped in recent weeks by a flood
of allegations from more than 20 present and former proj
ect workers charging that a major quality-control break
down occurred during construction of the plant.
. Though Diablo Canyon is only the latest on a growing list
of nuclear projects rocked by employee charges of design
and construction errors, the new allegations here are viewed
as yet another chapter in what many consider a textbook
case of how not to build an atomic power plant.
Grenadian leader ends exile
St. George's, Grenada — Eric Gairy, the flamboyant
Grenadian leader still following what he calls divine guid
ance, has returned to the island in the wake of U.S. invasion
forces and set out to revive his controversial political magic.
Gairy's return, for the first time since young revolution
aries overthrew his despotic rule in March 1979, marks an
acute embarrassment for the United States, according to
diplomats familiar with the problem.
Although Reagan administration officials tried to dis
courage him from coming, it was U.S. military intervention
that dissolved the Marxist leadership here and made Gairy's
reemergence on the Grenadian stage possible, they point
out.
Never one to forget a favor, Gairy has joined the chorus
of those proposing that Grenada's much-discussed new air
port be named after President Reagan when it is com
pleted.
Reagan denounced the airport as a security threat when
Grenada was friendly with Cuba, but U.S. officials now
agree that it should be finished, without ruling out a con
tribution of U.S. funds.
U.S. to continue Honduran
military maneuvers until 1988
Tegucigalpa, Honduras — The U.S. armed forces say they
are planning to hold regular military maneuvers in Honduras
through 1988, a U.S. senator said yesterday after two days
of talks with U.S. military officials here.
In addition to two exercises planned for 1984, the U.S.
military intends to stage one or two sets of exercises in each
of the following four years, aides to the senator quoted the
U.S. military officials as saying. Each of the maneuvers
would last several months, possibly as many as six, they said.
The disclosure by Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) provided the
most specific account so far of the Reagan administration's
plans for an extended military presence in Honduras. Con
gressional critics of the reported U.S. plans are preparing to
propose legislation barring maneuvers following the six
month-long Big Pine 2 exercise scheduled to end formally
Wednesday.
Former Reagan officials work
in his re-election bid
Washington — At least two former high-ranking Reagan
administration officials who left under a cloud are working
to re-elect the president, and a third is helping write the
platform on which Reagan will run.
Jim Lake, spokesman for the Reagan-Bush campaign, said
former Interior Secretary James Watt and the ClA's one
time spy chief, Max Hugel are working as volunteers in the
re-election effort. And Reagan's first national security ad
viser, Richard Allen, is a paid consultant to the Republican
National Committee, where officials said he is helping
