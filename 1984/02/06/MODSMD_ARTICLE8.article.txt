### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Beirut, Lebanon — Prime
Minister Shatik Wazzan and his
Cabinet resigned yesterday in
hopes that a new coalition go\-
ernment might have a better
chance of bringing Lebanon's
bitter sectarian conflict to an
end.
The resignations, apparently
in response to the urging of the
country's main Moslem militia
leader, were accepted by Presi
dent Aniin Gemayel. who
asked Wazzan to stay on as
caretaker prime minister until
a new Cabinet can be formed.
"Some efforts should be
made to end these bloody
events where innocent people
are killed and homes are
destroyed while all hope is
lost," Wazzan said in his resig
nation statement.
The resignation of Wazzan,
58, came after four days of
heavy street fighting in

Beirut's southern suburbs be
tween elements of the
Lebanese army and Amal. the
Shia Moslem militia. By last
night, the lighting had left at
least 100 persons dead and 400
wounded, and whole neighbor
hoods had been turned into
battlegrounds.
As Gemayel's government
wrestled with it political woes.
Shia militiamen began setting
checkpoints along the road
linking Beirut to its interna
tional airport, where the U.S.
Marines are stationed.
Maj. Dennis Brooks, a
Marine Corps spokesman, said
that the Marines were not in
volved in any of yesterday's
conflict, although they had
gone on their highest stage of
alert for about half an hour.
The resignations ol Wazzan
and his Cabinet were an
nounced yesterday afternoon.
One day after Nebih Berri.
leader of Amal and the man

who represented the Shias at
last year's Geneva talks among
Lebanon's warring factions,
urged Moslem members ot the
Cabinet to quit in protest to
the fighting in the southern
suburbs. Berri also called on
Shias who serve in the army to
refuse to fight fellow members
of their sect.

Wazzan. seeming both sad
and exhausted bitterly
criticized what had happened in
Lebanon under the Gemayel
administration.
• National reconciliation is
undermined and each time a
plan or a project was brought
up or whenever a rescue opeia
tion was scheduled, there was

alwavs someone who under
mined it.he said.
With Wazzan's resignation,
Gemayel finds himself in a
major quandary, because he
must now find a new prime
minister, who. by law. must be
a Sunnt Moslem under
Lebanon's religion-based con
stitution.
