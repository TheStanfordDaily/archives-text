From the Los Angeles Times
Brasilia, Brazil — Secretary of State George
Sluiltz yesterday accused Syria ol using "violent,
physical threats" against Lebanon s C abinet
members to force them to resign, and said that
Syria's "totally intransigent" attitude has
stymied U.S. diplomatic efforts to resolve the
Lebanese political crisis.
Using uncharacteristically blunt language.
Shultz turned aside questions about possible
U.S. military action against Syria, but he
declared that negotiations have worked only
when the United States "appeared to be more
forceful." He said that U.S. air strikes against

Svrian positions in December "made a serious
impact on Syria s attitude.
• What is clearly going on is the use of
force . . • direct threats against (Cabinet) min
isters. direct threats against potential ministers
by Syria to prevent the formation of a broader
government." Shult/ told reporters on his flight
from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia, where he is to
meet with Brazilian leaders today. "What we see
is an effort by (Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel to broaden the base ol his govern
ment . .. and an effort by Syria to to prevent
that — no doubt wanting to dominate Lebanon
itself.
