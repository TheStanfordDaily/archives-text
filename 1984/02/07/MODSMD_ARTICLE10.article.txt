# Anyone seen Andropov?
## 
### 
Political science groupies have long
awaited two nearly certain events:
President Reagan's announcement
that he is running for re-election and
Yuri Andropov's announcement that
he is dead.
We're still waiting for Yuri,
though it will probably come any day
now. Concerns were first voiced
when, at one Politburo meeting, the
Soviet president was only 30 inches

tall and appeared to be made of
wood. Coupled with the fact that he
spent the entire meeting seated on
the lap of a prominent Moscow
ventriloquist, this raised serious
questions about the state of
Andropov's health.
Andropov has not been seen in
public for more than five months.
Worse, he has not been seen in
private for more than three months.
"We have checked all the closets and
even under ail the beds," said one
Kremlin official. "We just don't

know where he is."
This causes grave complications for
the Soviet elite. At the traditional
October Revolution parade.
Andropo\ s place was taken by a
hand puppet. Recent statements at
tributed to Andropov were actually
transcribed by a medium using a
Ouija board, which perhaps explains
ambiguous remarks such as,
"American missiles in Europe must
be daerfon logu aknl frgueti."

Then again, these could ail be base
less rumors. You will remember that
when Andropov first took office, it
was said that he liked scotch, listened
to jazz and spoke fluent English.
Later, of course, it turned out that
Andropov hated scotch, listened only
to the Sex Pistols and communicated
through a system of buzzes and clicks
similar to the language of dolphins.
So don't take anything you read
about Soviet presidents too
seriously.
American intelligence agencies

have been studying Andropov closely
since his disappearance. Some offi
cials have expressed fear that the
Soviets are hoping to survive a nu
clear war by having leaders who are
already dead. A preemptive strike
against our own president might be
necessary to close the "casket of vul
nerability."
Others have suggested that the
president's projected expiration is
nothing more than an election year
ploy. Reagan recently announced he
would indeed run for a second term
(see above), and he realizes the value
of the "sympathy vote." Considering
the upwelling of support he received
when lie was merely wounded, if he
actually bought the farm he would be
a shoo-in.
Others point out that one of
Reagan's biggest stumbling blocks is
his age. Reagan, if re-elected, would
be 78 when he finishes his second
term — older than any president in
our history, but than many
completely funcTOtal^piiirtarifes.

be 1 1," he boasts. "I.assie was a lot
older than that when they had her
put down."
Still, despite Ed Meese's assertion
that "there are no dead people in
America," aides privately admit that
many voters do wonder what would
happen if Reagan were to die in of
fice. They feel it would be best if
President Reagan could prove now
that he would be able to handle the
job just as well alive as dead.

Koppel on location: "Well, the presi
dent looks pretty good here in the
snows of New Hampshire, but one
can only wait and see how well he'll
hold up under the hot summer sun of
July and August."
Reagan himself seems enthusiastic
about the idea. "Look at all the
great presidents," he remarked.

they're all dead. All this country
needs to get it back on its feet is a
leader who's dead."
