# ROBERT LARKINS
## Speaking in plain English 
### 
Something very curious happened last November in
San Francisco.
San Francisco Supervisor Quentin Kopp went out on a
limh for common sense, sponsoring an initiative against
federally mandated multilingual balloting . . . and he won
big.
His Proposition O was a grass roots movement aimed
at sending a message to the bo/os in Washington: It di
rected the mayor to send a resolution to Congress for
the repeal of a ridiculous amendment to the Voting
Rights Act of 1975 which requires communities across
the country to provide special election materials for
Asians, Hispanics, native Americans and native Alaskans.
In some instances the law provides that members of
these particular "language minorities" need constitute
only "5 percent of the citizens of voting age of such
state or political subdivision." 5 PERCENT!

VIEWPOINT

In an ethnic salad bowl like San Francisco, kopp's
stance seemed like political suicide. Mayor Diane
Feinstein, running virtually unopposed for re-election,
came out strongly against the measure, as did nine of the
city's 1 1 supervisors.
Nevertheless, Kopp, the Lone Ranger of Principle,
hung in there, and Proposition O passed by a two-to-one
margin. Support was substantial in both C hinatown and
the heavily Hispanic Mission district. In a town where
registered Democrats outnumber Republicans on the or
der of three to one, the vote evinced a significant bipar
tisan consensus.
The appeal of Kopp's position was its logic: To vote,
one must be a citizen; to become a citizen, one must
demonstrate a certain proficiency in English.
Additionally. 1 think Kopp struck a popular chord of
discontent among many ethnic groups who, while being

proud of their heritage, are even more proud to he
American. I here are many groups who don't exploit
their "minority" status and resent the special treatment
given to the city's more visible Chinese and Spanish
speaking communities.
Inspired by the November revolution, kopp's allies
(including ex-Senator Sam Hayakawa's Washington
based group which seeks a constitutional amendment
designating English as the official language in the
United States) have already launched the California
Committee for Ballots in English. They hope to qualify a
similar statewide initiative for the November election.
(Interested students should write: U.S. English, P.O.
Box 27144, San Francisco, CA 94127.)
Both Hayakawa, the gutsy former president of S.F.
State and long-time opponent of bilingualism, and kopp
are to be commended for their commitment to principle
in the face of nasty opposition, which all too often
degenerated into unfounded charges of racism.
A nation is more than a geographical entity: one of
the integral unifying factors is language. Fiercely proud
ol my tenuous Italian heritage. 1 am a staunch defender
of immigrants' rights to maintain their native tradi
tions.
Congress shall pass no law denying man his piroshki, or
pasta, without due process, but multilingual ballots are a
whole other kettle of fish. The current federal regula
tions arc merely a prelude to multilingual government,
which inevitably leads to cultural fragmentation and na
tional division a la Canada.
It's high time that the meddlers in Congress acknowl
edge that this is America and that English is the official
language.
Multilingual ballots are a disservice to America's eth
nic minorities. My ancestors struggled hard to learn En
glish, and so did yours. Suffrage and economic prosperity
were the incentives.
