# PRIETO AND STREETER
## Sigma Chis lack manners 
### 
It was a sunny, warm and glorious
Friday afternoon. Walking across
campus toward my home, 1 felt like
skipping and whistling a happy tune.
The mood of the afternoon was
abruptly shattered as I came to
Tresidder parking lot. I heard from
the distance the loud, offensive,
abusive sounds of male voices
projected through an amplification

VIEWPOINT

system. As I came closer I realized
that the voices were coming from
the roof of the Sigma Chi fraternity
house.
I knew that, unless I wanted to
take a long detour, I had to pass by
the Sigma Chi house. I began to feel
fear, dread and anger. My fears were
confirmed when I heard "Hey you in
the purple shirt. (I was wearing a
purple shirt.) Nice breasts!"
1 can hardly begin to describe the
anger, helplessness and frustration I
felt at this moment. I know 1 was

not alone in my feelings. The Sigma
Chi boys were shouting at and harass
ing just about everyone — female
and male — who dared to walk or ride
past their house.
Not only was I angry and
frustrated, but I was also amazed —
for a moment. The behavior was so
incredibly immature that I could
scarcely believe that they were doing
what they were doing. But then I
remembered that these things are
really not very unusual. These boys
have displayed similar behavior in the
past, apparently flaunting their con
viction that it is unlikely that they'll
be made to stop.
I want to talk about damage. Last
Friday afternoon, as I walked in the
parking lot behind the American
Studies House, I heard the men (?) of
Sigma Chi yelling loudly, obnoxiously
and abusively to the people passing
below them.
1 want to talk about the core of
fury that resides in helplessness. How
is one to respond in a situation such

as this? They created the circum
stances.
Wc hesitate to play their repulsive
game - yet how else can we let them
know our anger, our disapproval and
most of all our unwillingness to ac
cept this treatment? When I got
nearer to this fraternity 1 met my
friend Maggie, who had just had a
choice comment directed at her.
I want to talk about impatience. I
do not accept any lame excuses for
this behavior — least of all that
these men (?) were having "fun."
Why then were all of us who were
within earshot that beautiful day
subjected to this harassment? To
this ugliness?
We know that some of you do not
take this type of protest seriously.
Maybe you will put this letter up in
your house and laugh for the rest of
the quarter. We ask you to think
harder than that. Who do you think
you are?
