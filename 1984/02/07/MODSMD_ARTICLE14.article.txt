## Classifying humanism and atheism as religions 
### 
Bryan Wildenthal stated in his
opinion (Daily, Feb. 3) that "No one
should be forced to pay taxes to
support a religion that he does not
believe in." Although I'm tempted
to take on every aspect of his view
point in lengthy debate. 1 shall focus
on this point.
First. Wildenthal fails to recog
nize that there are three types of
religion in the world: One which
recognizes a theocentric nature of
man, where God (or gods) is a su
preme. omniscient being; a second
which states that man is himself the
"exalted one." namely humanism;
and a third which denies the exis
tence of any supreme being, namely
atheism. These categories are not
necessarily mutually exclusive.
Therefore, if the statement made
by Wildenthal is true, then many of
us are having our constitutional
rights violated. It must be
recognized that humanism and ath
eism. which our school systems are
currently propagating, are indeed
religions in themselves.
The problem is that these two
religions have not been properly
defined as religions. It must be
understood that is is just as much of
a religion to deny the existence of
God as it is to believe in God's exis
tence.
A fundamental question has been
raised in his article, which is, "Have

the people of the United States
come to the point where they com
pletely reject the idea of a deity
such that they do not desire commu
nication with God (prayer) to be a
public activity?"
Are we no longer a "nation under
God?" Do we no longer worship and
praise and believe in the same God
that the founders of our Constitu
tion entrusted their lives and our
nation? Are we to he a nation which
chooses to seek progress and
prosperity in the name of mankind
while at the same time denying the
existence of God?
If this is the case, then we shall
surely end up with the same future
that Sodom and Gomorrah faced
when they rejected God in light of
their own desires and knowledge . . .
they met utter and complete
destruction.

Aerobics
I would like to clear up some
misconceptions which may arise from
the article. "Aerobics profit in free
space," (Daily, Feb. 1). The article
suggests that the aerobics programs
on campus are attempting to take
advantage of both student interest
and c: npus facilities. II the
rcpoi i had. however, done a little

more investigative reporting, she
would have learned that comparable
classes off-campus cost an average
of $4 per hour.
Our program, in contrast, not only
offers a greater flexibility of
schedule but costs only $ 1 per ses
sion.
To the objection that campus
aerobics should be free, 1 would like
to point out that, despite the
seeming glamor of the position,
being an aerobics instructor is a job
which requires a commitment of
time, energy and healthy habits
which should be compensated as is
any other job.
Campus aerobics is not oppor
tunism: it is the provision of a
needed servicc. Just as some campus
events such as plays and concerts
have an attendent fee which allows
the event to be of superior quality,
so must our classes have a small cost
in order to assure greater quality of
music and instruction.
Furthermore, because our main
interest is in promoting a program
of health and fitness of value to
both men and women, any profits
would be spent, as I mentioned to
the reporter and which she failed to
include in quotations, on an
aerobics-related donation to the
University.

Middle East
Sally Newman, "a senior majoring
in international relations" has been
to the field: She visited Egypt,
Israel and Lebanon.
By one stroke of the pen (Daily,
Jan. 31) Newman dismisses the dis
placement of a million Palestinians
from their lands, the occupation of
the rest of their country and the
continued dismantling of their soci
ety as the major cause of the con
flict in the Middle East. "It is not
even necessary to dwell on the poli
tical issues as reflected in the na
tional propaganda (i.e., 'the Zionists
stole our land . . Newman
asserts. What is the cause then? One
is hard-pressed to find an answer in
Newman's long and vague discussion.
It is really curious that Newman
can write about Moslem intolerance
of religious deviance while neglecting
the recurrent terrorist attacks on
mosques and churches in the Israeli
occupied territories, the latest ot
which occurred only a few days ago.
"Reconsidering relations in the
Middle East" can neither be accom
plished by dehumanizing one side and
glorifying the other, nor at the
point of a gun.
