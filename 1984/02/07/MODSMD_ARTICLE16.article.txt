# Growing Hispanic population opens new field of research
## 
### REBECCA BUELL 
In New York, researchers are decoding
the intricate dialects spoken in the Puerto
Rican barrios. In Austin, they are planning
a nationwide database in Hispanic-
American literature. In Silicon Valley, they
are studying a Chicano population that has
grown 500 percent since 1950.
The impact of the growing Hispanic
population upon American demograqhy
has opened up a new field in social science
research. Chicanos, Puerto Ricans and
other Hispanics have turned ethnic studies
of the 1970s into a larger trend of Pan-
Hispanic research.
Representatives of four universities
met on the Stanford campus this weekend
to evaluate existing information on
Hispanic populations and to set a course
for research in the future.
"In the 1970s and early '80s there was an
explosion of research and information in
all areas of social science," said History
Prof. Albert Camarillo, director of the
Stanford Center for Chicano Research.
"Our task is to make heads and tails out of
it all."
The weekend conference marked the
first reunion of the Inter-University Pro
gram in Chicano and Puerto Rican Re
search (I UP). The group of four
universities — Stanford, UCLA, Univer
sity of Texas at Austin, and Hunter State
University of New York — was established
in October 1983 with the objective of co
ordinating research efforts across the
country.
"II we can establish a solid foundation
for collaboration and participation,"
Camarillo said, "then we have accom

plished a great deal."
Hie short-term objectives of the con
ference, said Armando Valdez, research
director of the Stanford Center for
Chicano Research, "are to bring research
scholars of each center to discuss and agree
upon specific research agenda and to
develop task forces for these areas."
"The long-term objective," he said, "is
to conduct collaborative research on
Chicano and Puerto Rican issues."

'Whether we like it or
not, it is clear that policy
makers are interested in
Hispanics. They will do
things for and to
Hispanics. We must be
there when the decisions
are made/

lUP's focus on Chicano and Puerto
Rican populations reflects the concentra
tion of research efforts in these areas.
There are no established research in
stitutes which study other Hispanic-
American populations in the United
States.
"There is clearly a need for research on
other groups," Camarillo said. "But we had
to go with where our strength is. Chicanos
currently account for 60 to 70 percent of
the national Hispanic population and
Puerto Ricans account for 15 percent."

Conference discussions focused on
several general concerns: regionalism, labor
market patterns, cultural integration,
data collection, language and political par
ticipation. Each topic discussion consid
ered gender and public policy as
fundamental variables in Hispanic-
American issues.
"Of major importance is bridging the
gap between social science research and
policy analysis and formation," Camarillo
said.
A primary focus of the conference was
to develop a working document for secur
ing funds for future research. Research in
minority studies has suffered greatly in
the past several years due to funding cuts
by the Reagan administration.
"We must get our money from private
foundations because the government has
given us nothing," Valdez said.
The upcoming presidential elections may
give a boost to Hispanic research, confer
ence participants said. Recognition of the
power of the Hispanic vote has made
politicians more aware of Hispanic inter
ests.
"Whether we like it or not," said a dele
gate from UCLA, "it is clear that policy
makers are interested in Hispanics. They
will do things for and to Hispanics. We
must be there when the decisions are
made."
The course of Hispanic research will
depend on funding programs in the future.
Chicano researchers at Stanford in the
past have received support for their activi
ties through the Carnegie Foundation, the
Ford Foundation and the Tinker Founda
tion.
