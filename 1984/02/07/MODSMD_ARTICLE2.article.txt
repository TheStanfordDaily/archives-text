# McCloskey discusses federal energy policy
## 
### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer 
Congress rarely initiates decisions
regarding the nation's energy
policies, former Rep. Paul "Pete"
McCloskey (R-Cal.) and Assistant
Political Science Prof. John Chubb
told an audience of about 50 in the
Geology corner last night.
While Chubb said most energy
decisions are made by the bureau
cracy, McCloskey held that decision
making is divided among seven
groups.
Energy policies are influenced by
the three branches of government —
Congress, the president and the Su
preme Court — as well as by lobbies,
the people, the press and the bureau
cracy. McCloskey said. The bureau
cracy is actually the "smallest of the
energy policy-makers."
"You should never look at
Congress as being a leader," McClos
key said. "We're politicians. We have
to run for office. You will always
find that Congress is led by one of
these other elements. Quite often
the lobbying effort will be what
forces Congress to change policies."
According to Chubb, who is also a
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
the fact that responsibility for ener
gy policy lies in the bureaucracy is
largely the result of decisions made
by Congress itself.
Prior to the 1973 oil price shocks,
(there was virtually no national ener
;,CV policy. Chubb said. Those policies
frhat did exist benefited domestic
producers, largely due to the influ

ence of powerful Congressional com
mittee chairmen who held their
positions due to seniority, and who
were supported hy special interest
groups.
Because of its structure, Congress
was not prepared to deal with the
economic turmoil resulting from the
1973 price shocks, as well as the envi-

ronmental issues posed by the need
to expand domestic oil and gas pro
duction. At the same time, these is
sues mobilized a wide array of special
interest groups.
According to Chubb, this was the
situation in which energy was
debated throughout the 19705.
"The first thing Congress did was
to find itself stalemated. There were
so many interest groups and Congress
was so ill-equipped that it could get
very little done. What Congress did
was to create a bureaucracy and
throw a lot of money at it."
