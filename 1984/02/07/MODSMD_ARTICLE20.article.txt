## Card can't cut the Bull(dogs) 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Coaches, commentators and fans alike
spend endless hours arguing the issue.
Some declare that good offense always
beats a good defense. Others swear that
good defense beats a good offense.
Yesterday, the Stanford baseball team
did little to solve this smoldering contro
versy in its 3-2 loss to Fresno State, but it
did prove one thing beyond a doubt: bad
offense does not beat anyone.
The Cardinal, now 5-3 after dropping its
second consecutive home game, collected a
paltry four hits against two undistin
guished Bulldog hurlers. As if that was not
bad enough, Stanford produced only two
runs despite being the recipient of eight
walks and a hit batsman.
I.ike much of the weekday crowd after
the game, Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess was as silent as his club's bats,
offering only a shrug as an explanation for

what had happened — or, rather, what had
tailed to happen — over the previous two
hours.
Things started innocently enough. The
Card tallied a second inning score when
sophomore Ken Green punched a single to
center field, scoring Mike Deßenon from
third base with the game's first run.
Green, who Marquess says "doesn't have
the best speed or great power, but does
what it takes to win." has apparently won
the third base job from three other candi
dates on the strength of his 4-of-ll hit
ting and gutsy defensive play in the last
four games.
His single was Stanford's second of the
inning off Fresno State starter Tom Tom
linson. The Cardinal didn't nick Tomlinson
or reliever Rich Sorenson, the winning
pitcher and now 1-0, for another hit until
a one-out single in the seventh.
Meanwhile, Stanford starter Kevin

Kunkel was sailing along, throwing three
and one-third perfect innings before the
Bulldogs reached on second baseman Gar
ret Crough's line drive single to left. But
one out and two singles later Crouglv
crossed the plate to tie the score at 1-1.
After the Card wasted base runners in
innings four through six, Kunkel found
himself in trouble when he walked pinch
hitter David Studdert on four pitches to
begin the seventh inning. Carlos Zega fol
lowed with a double into the left field al
ley and Kunkel was finished for the day.
Marquess paged lefty Doug Gwaltncy
from the bullpen to stem Fresno State's
famed " Red Wave."
Just as teammate Doug Ballard had
done against Cal State Fullerton one day
earlier, Gwaltney fooled the first two hit
ters he faced with slow breaking balls. But

hits and two runs, despite having plenty of runners on base and opportunities to score.
also like Ballard, Gwaltney sur
rendered the game-winning hit
when he went to his fastball.
This time it was Fresno
State's Crough who drove in
two runs with a single, giving
the Bulldogs (1-2-1) its first
win and handing Kunkel (1-1)
his first loss.
"(Kunkel) made one mistake
when he walked the leadott

man on four pitches."
Marquess noted. "Normally,
that's a great performance and
he gets a win. but that (the
walk) was the mistake that
cost him."
A last gasp Stanford rally
fizzled in the bottom of the
ninth when the Cardinal again
failed to produce the clutch
hit. Rick Lundblade laced the
first pitch in the ninth to right
field and Deßenon walked,
giving the Card two runners on
with no one out.

Pinch-hitter Chris Brill
then pushed the runners oxer
with a perfect sacrifice bunt.
Stanford cut the lead to 3-2
when Darryl Stephens
grounded to short, scoring
pinch-runner Toi Cook. But
Sorenseon shut the door by
coaxing Greg Lorcnzetti to tly
out to right field for the final
out.
Stanford must now regroup
before its three-game series
with San Jose State beginning
this Friday.
