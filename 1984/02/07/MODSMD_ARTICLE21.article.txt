### PETER CASTILLO 
The Stanford wrestling
team began to show the
fruits of twice-a-day
workouts as it had its best
performance of the season
this weekend in Southern
California.
On Friday, at La Mirada
in Southern California, the
Cardinal led Northern
Arizona University 23-20
going into the heavyweight
match, but had to forfeit
due to injuries to Flint
Pulskamp and Ed Katz. This
gave NAU six points and 26-
23 victory. The perfor
mances of Scott Wiggen and
Jeff Wilson highlighted
Stanford's effort.
The next day in the Biola

Inivitational at La Mirada.
Stanford took sixth place.
The Cardinal's upcoming op
ponent, San Jose State,
captured first.
"NAU was tougher than I
expected and I was pleased
that we kept the match
close. It is a little dishear
tening to lose so many
matches this close, but in
another perspective it is
surprising that we even
came that close and that
reflects on the caliber of
the team." Stanford Coach
Chris I lorpel said.
"In the tournament al
most everyone won a match
and we improved on last
year's seventh place finish

which is great," Horpel said.
Against the NAU Lum
berjacks, Jeff Bradley
dropped to 134 pounds for
the first time this season
and looked tough in a 7-4
victory. Pete Rogers (158
pounds) demolished his op
ponent 19-3 and Kurt Kas
sulke returned to the
lineup and cruised to a 7-1
win.
The two wrestlers that
Horpel believes have the
best chance to go to the
NCAA Championships,
Scott Wiggen and Jeff Wil
son, both had an impressive
weekend.
Wiggen ( 142 pounds) and
Wilson (177 pounds) both

pinned their NAU oppo
nents, in the second and
first period, respectively,
and both captured third
place in the tournament.
Commenting on Wiggen,
Horpel said he has seen im
provement in his condition
ing and small refinements in
his technique. Most impor
tantly, Wiggen has learned
to pick up his opponent's
technique quicker and vary
his attack.
Wilson has improved on
his conditioning since re
turning from an illness two
weeks ago, but Horpel sees
further improvement in this
area and hopes to see him
return to his early season
form.
