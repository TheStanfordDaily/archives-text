# Spikers topple No. 2 Pepperdine

### JASON COLE Daily Staff 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
proved that it really belongs among the
country's top teams, as it defeated No. 2-
ranked Pepperdinc University Friday night
at Maples Pavilion.
Assistant Coach Don Shaw said that
beating Pepperdinc was more than just
getting started oil on the right foot.
"The preseason polls pretty much
assumed that UCI.A and Pepperdinc were
the top two teams and then there was a
drop-off in which there were a bunch of
teams competing for third," Shaw said.
Stanford won the match three games to
two. 15-11, 15-12, 7-15, 12-15 and 15-11.
The match was so close, in fact, that the
total scores were even.
But the kev to the Cardinal's victory

was being able to jump out to a z-U lead.
"We started out really fast and the crowd
was really into it. which helped," Shaw
said.
"About midway through the match, we
went flat. Pepperdinc almost could have
taken the second game, but we stayed
steady, rather than folding up," Shaw said.
."That pyi them down and it's really tough
(or anyone to take three straight games
from a good team."
The win raised Stanford's overall record
to 8-3, but put the Cardinal at 1-0 in the
tough California Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association (OVA). Out of the 10 teams
in the league, seven are in the nation's top
10. "The league is going to be a real dog
fight. It's nice to start with a win," Shaw
said.

The Cardinal was led by a trio of fine
performances. Junior Craig Lauchner had
20 kills and a .274 hitting percentage,
while sophomore Brett Monello had 21
kills to lead the team and junior Dan Parr
had what Shaw termed "a good perfor
mance all-around."
But Stanford will need to maintain an
even keel every week to continue its suc
cess over the entire season. "The teams
that win consistently can't ride an emo
tional rollercoaster every game. You have
to be able to play well each night because
there are so many good teams," Shaw said.
The Card will have to be very careful of
the momentum shift when it takes on No.

day. "They (UCLA) are the best prepared
team at this point. They're not invincible,
but it won't be easy," Shaw said.
