# Santa Clara isn't the Pac-10, but it's no pushover either

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford gets a break from
its Pacific-10 Conference
schedule tonight when it plays
at Santa Clara, but that
doesn't mean the game isn't
important.
In fact, when Stanford takes
its 15-7 record and four-game
win streak into Santa Clara's
Toso Pavilion tonight at 7:30,
winning could very well be more
important to the Cardinal
than in any single Pac-10 game.
Santa Clara is presently 16-6
overall and 4-2 in the WCAC
(West Coast Athletic Confer
ence), a league it is favored to
win. So a Stanford victory over
the tournament-hound
Broncos, especially one on their
home court, would look nice on
the Card's resume at the
season's end when post-season
tournament selection commit
tees earn their pay.
A Stanford win would also
be more important than just
another'W' in another way. A
victory tonight would give the
Card its 16th on the season and
assure Stanford its first win
ning season in 11 years, when
the Howie Dallmar-coached
team went 14-1 I in 1972-73.
However, second-year Coach
Davis said a winning season is
not the top priority of his
players. "We haven't even
mentioned it (going for the
winning season) in practice this
week." he said yesterday. "1
think that the players' goals
are bigger than that."

One of their goals tonight
will he to stop Santa Clara's
tall and talented front line,
which includes 7-foot-2 center
Nick Vanos.
"They hold their own he
cause of their two power for
wards, (6-5) Scott Lamson and
(6-7) Mike Norman." Davis
said. "And then they have
Vanos at 7-2."

Stanford will prohablv
counter the Broncos' height
advantage with the 1-2-2 sag
ging zone defense that has
been successful against its tal
ler Pac-10 opponents. Davis in
dicated that he may use a
man-to-man defense as well,
though.
"We'll have to play some


Andrew Kalman/Dailv-
Sophomore forward Earl Koberlein's tough defense and
rebounding will be especially important tonight against Santa
Clara as Stanford will have to counteract the Bronco's big
front line. Koberlein is the Cardinal's second-leading
rebounder, averaging 5.5 per game.
