## 'A Midsummer Night's Dream': not dreamlike 
### MARC FAJER 
You have to give director
James Edmondson credit for
creativity. His production of
William Shakespeare's "A Mid
summer Night's Dream," which
opened last Tuesday night at
the Geary Theatre in San Fran
cisco, is original and im
aginative in many respects.
This is perhaps especially
laudable because his last at
tempt at the American Con
servatory Theatre two seasons
ago was a creative "Richard
II," which was an unmitigated
disaster. Unfortunately, some
of the imaginative aspects of
this production are not well
thought-out or executed. The
result, while occasionally
hilarious, is uneven, and lacks
the poetic quality that can
make the show enchanting.
The tone set at the outset
of the show is very cold and
formal. The actors move about
the stage in the initial court
scene with a technical precision
that seems entirely un
motivated by any internal com
pulsions. There is some cleverly
designed business here as we see
Hippolyta, queen of the
Amazons (Nancy Carlin), about
to be married to Theseus, Duke
of Athens (John Hertzler),
resisting his advances, and be
coming irate at his treatment
of Hermia (Janice Hutchins) in
a kind of feminist stance. Un
fortunately, the acting here is
not believable enough to make
this scenario more than mildly
amusing, and both queen and
duke arc too cold to really
catch our sympathy. The point
here may well be that the court
world is overly restrictive, hut
if that is true, we ought to feel
strong sympathy for Hermia
and Lynsander (John DcMita),
the young lovers trying to
break out of the rigid rules of
Athens. However, Hutchins
never engages us at all; she is
rigid and her defiant speeches
to Theseus don't ring true.
Similarly, the young men who
are wooing her are not very in
teresting. Both DeMita as
Lysander and Peter Bretz as his
rival Demetrius are intermit
tently funny throughout the
play, but neither is humorous
enough or interesting enough
to make us care very much.
The saving grate ot the
lovers' scenes is Carolyn
McCormick as Helena, who
runs away with every scene she
is m. Her speech at the end ot
the first scene when she
bemoans the fact that

Demetrius is in love with Her
mia is the first hit of humanity
in the play. Her breathless, dis
heveled pursuit of Demetrius is
very funny, and we admire her
pluck when, complaining that
women were made to he
wooed, not to woo, she tromps
off after him again.
The fight scene between the
lovers at the end of the first
half of the show is very well
staged and very funny. When
Hermia gets angry at Helena,
we finally see some believable
moments out of Hutchins, and
the result is very good. When

we return to the court, things
have gotten considerably less
stilted, though Hertzler never
really rises to Theseus' long
speeches. The apparent change
in atmosphere in the court (the
courtiers have changed from
black leathery-looking gar
ments to white satiny-looking
ones) I suppose is to be
credited to the benevolent in
fluence of the fairies and the
forest. This, however, is very
strange because the forest
world in this "Dream" 1 is not
particularly benevolent, and
certainly would not change the
harsh rule of law (and black
leather) for the more compas
sionate scenes at the end of
the play.
The fairy world offers a
director the greatest opportu-

nity to be creative. In this case
the fairies (though fortunately
not of the sugar plum variety)
are somewhat malicious bird
like creatures. Peter Donat,
normally superb, appears to us
silhouetted against the moon,
supposedly like some great dark
bird of prey. His unfortunate
black feather-like costume and
attempts at avian noises and
movement leave him with all
the stature and verisimilitude
of a villain on an episode of
"Star Trek" or "Batman." He
rattles off some of the most
beautiful verse in Shakespeare

("1 know a bank where the wild
thyme grows . . .") without any
appreciation for the music in
the lines, and the result is that
he is nasty without being ap
pealing. We never share his
childlike glee at the mischief he
plans.
Annette Bening as Titania
handles the verse a bit better,
but is cold and distant in her
early scenes. This does make
her later scenes with Bottom
seem funny by contrast, but
the tension in the play that
results from an audience's in
terest in the characters of the
two fairies is lost.
Tom O'Brien's Puck is cute
enough, and funny in places,
hut there ought to have been
more done with the part. In
this production. Puck becomes

very little more than an arm of
Oberon, and the potential for
interesting quirks and business
of his own is foregone. In gen
eral, the problem with the
fairies is that the "bird-like"
idea was not very carefully
developed. If they were in
tended to be graceful free
spirits, they should have done
much more work on bird-like
motion and the costumes
should have been considerably
sleeker. If they were intended
to be fairly animal-like, the at
tempts at bird movement, or
graceful movement of any

kind, should have been
foregone completely. As it
was, the actors trying to float
and glide tended to look like
half-plucked chickens at
tempting Swan Lake.
The saving element of the
entire show, aside from
Helena's performance, was the
presentation of the mechani
cals. The Athenian handymen,
banded together to perform a
play for Theseus, were consis
tently hysterical. Edmondson
carefully crafted well-defined
characters for each of the six.
and they each were tunny. Ray
Reinhardt's Bottom was a
masterpiece of petulant con
ceit: demanding every role in
the play, pouting when his
ideas are discarded, basking in
flattery and insistinsj on having

the last word on every aspect
of the production. One hit of
business where he carefully
shows Snug (Harold Surratt)
how to deliver his prologue, as
Snug tries to imitate his every
move, is especially funny. His
scenes with Titania, when he
has acquired an ass' head, are
also wonderful. Reinhardt's
surprise at the attentions of
the fairy queen, his little hee
haws, and his handling of the
huge mask in general are all ex
cellent. Sydney Walker's Peter
Quince, the head of the
players, is almost as good. His
handling of Bottom's prima
donna behavior is delightful to
watch, and he has a variety of
clever little mannerisms that
flesh out the part. Drew Eshel
man is Starveling, the tailor,
played here as a sort of over
grown mama's boy clutching a
stuffed dog for the entire
length of the play. J. Steven
White as Flute, who is forced
to play the female lover in the
play, is hysterical wandering
around in a tattered white
sheer dress and little else. His
attempt at delivering the verse
in his part, carefully accenting
all the iambs, is very funny.
The actual performance of
"Pyramus and Thisbe" was the
funniest rendition of this won
derful scene I have come across.
From Walker's marvelous man
gling of the prologue to
Thisby's death, there was non
stop laughter. Perhaps the
highlights were Thisby's false
breasts and what happens to
them when s/he tries to com
mit suicide.
The overall vision behind the
show was somewhat lacking.
While the language was clearly
and precisely rendered, it often
lacked the humanity and the
poetry that make the play
wonderful. The problems can
be summed up in what was at
tempted with the very last
scene of the play. As Oberon
and Titania blessed the house
of Theseus and Hippolyta the
fairies wandered through the
audience, "blessing" it. Yet be
cause of the maliciousness of
Oberon and the unpoetic and
unbeautiful nature of the fairy
world. I was not at all sure I
wanted to be blessed by them.
If a production of "A Midsum
mer Night's Dream" is to work,
you have to want to be blessed
by the fairies.

entire show, aside from
Helena's performance, was the
presentation of the mechani

banded together to perform a

carefully crafted well-defined
characters for each of the six.
and they each were tunny. Ray
Reinhardt's Bottom was a
masterpiece of petulant con
ceit: demanding every role in
the play, pouting when his
ideas are discarded, basking in
flattery and insistinsj on having

the last word on every aspect
of the production. One hit of
business where he carefully
shows Snug (Harold Surratt)
how to deliver his prologue, as
Snug tries to imitate his every
move, is especially funny. His
scenes with Titania, when he
has acquired an ass' head, are
also wonderful. Reinhardt's
surprise at the attentions of
the fairy queen, his little hee

huge mask in general are all ex

Quince, the head of the
players, is almost as good. His
handling of Bottom's prima

watch, and he has a variety of
clever little mannerisms that
flesh out the part. Drew Eshel
man is Starveling, the tailor,
played here as a sort of over
grown mama's boy clutching a
stuffed dog for the entire
length of the play. J. Steven
White as Flute, who is forced
to play the female lover in the
play, is hysterical wandering
around in a tattered white

in his part, carefully accenting
all the iambs, is very funny.
The actual performance of
"Pyramus and Thisbe" was the
funniest rendition of this won
derful scene I have come across.
From Walker's marvelous man

Thisby's death, there was non
stop laughter. Perhaps the
highlights were Thisby's false
breasts and what happens to

The overall vision behind the
show was somewhat lacking.
While the language was clearly
and precisely rendered, it often
lacked the humanity and the
poetry that make the play
wonderful. The problems can
be summed up in what was at
tempted with the very last
scene of the play. As Oberon
and Titania blessed the house
of Theseus and Hippolyta the
fairies wandered through the
audience, "blessing" it. Yet be
cause of the maliciousness of
Oberon and the unpoetic and
unbeautiful nature of the fairy
world. I was not at all sure I
wanted to be blessed by them.

Peter Bretz, and Janice Hutchins in ACT's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream.'
You have to give director
James Edmondson credit for
creativity. His production of
William Shakespeare's "A Mid
summer Night's Dream," which
opened last Tuesday night at
the Geary Theatre in San Fran
cisco, is original and im
aginative in many respects.
This is perhaps especially
laudable because his last at
tempt at the American Con
servatory Theatre two seasons
ago was a creative "Richard
II," which was an unmitigated
disaster. Unfortunately, some
of the imaginative aspects of
this production are not well
thought-out or executed. The
result, while occasionally
hilarious, is uneven, and lacks
the poetic quality that can
make the show enchanting.
The tone set at the outset
of the show is very cold and
formal. The actors move about
the stage in the initial court
scene with a technical precision
that seems entirely un
motivated by any internal com
pulsions. There is some cleverly
designed business here as we see
Hippolyta, queen of the
Amazons (Nancy Carlin), about
to be married to Theseus, Duke
of Athens (John Hertzler),
resisting his advances, and be
coming irate at his treatment
of Hermia (Janice Hutchins) in
a kind of feminist stance. Un
fortunately, the acting here is
not believable enough to make
this scenario more than mildly
amusing, and both queen and
duke arc too cold to really
catch our sympathy. The point
here may well be that the court
world is overly restrictive, hut
if that is true, we ought to feel
strong sympathy for Hermia
and Lynsander (John DcMita),
the young lovers trying to
break out of the rigid rules of
Athens. However, Hutchins
never engages us at all; she is
rigid and her defiant speeches
to Theseus don't ring true.
Similarly, the young men who
are wooing her are not very in
teresting. Both DeMita as
Lysander and Peter Bretz as his
rival Demetrius are intermit
tently funny throughout the
play, but neither is humorous
enough or interesting enough
to make us care very much.
The saving grate ot the
lovers' scenes is Carolyn
McCormick as Helena, who
runs away with every scene she
is m. Her speech at the end ot
the first scene when she
bemoans the fact that

Demetrius is in love with Her
mia is the first hit of humanity
in the play. Her breathless, dis
heveled pursuit of Demetrius is
very funny, and we admire her
pluck when, complaining that
women were made to he
wooed, not to woo, she tromps
off after him again.
The fight scene between the
lovers at the end of the first
half of the show is very well
staged and very funny. When
Hermia gets angry at Helena,
we finally see some believable
moments out of Hutchins, and
the result is very good. When

we return to the court, things
have gotten considerably less
stilted, though Hertzler never
really rises to Theseus' long
speeches. The apparent change
in atmosphere in the court (the
courtiers have changed from
black leathery-looking gar
ments to white satiny-looking
ones) I suppose is to be
credited to the benevolent in
fluence of the fairies and the
forest. This, however, is very
strange because the forest
world in this "Dream" 1 is not
particularly benevolent, and
certainly would not change the
harsh rule of law (and black
leather) for the more compas
sionate scenes at the end of
the play.
The fairy world offers a
director the greatest opportu-

nity to be creative. In this case
the fairies (though fortunately
not of the sugar plum variety)
are somewhat malicious bird
like creatures. Peter Donat,
normally superb, appears to us
silhouetted against the moon,
supposedly like some great dark
bird of prey. His unfortunate
black feather-like costume and
attempts at avian noises and
movement leave him with all
the stature and verisimilitude
of a villain on an episode of
"Star Trek" or "Batman." He
rattles off some of the most
beautiful verse in Shakespeare

("1 know a bank where the wild
thyme grows . . .") without any
appreciation for the music in
the lines, and the result is that
he is nasty without being ap
pealing. We never share his
childlike glee at the mischief he
plans.
Annette Bening as Titania
handles the verse a bit better,
but is cold and distant in her
early scenes. This does make
her later scenes with Bottom
seem funny by contrast, but
the tension in the play that
results from an audience's in
terest in the characters of the
two fairies is lost.
Tom O'Brien's Puck is cute
enough, and funny in places,
hut there ought to have been
more done with the part. In
this production. Puck becomes

very little more than an arm of
Oberon, and the potential for
interesting quirks and business
of his own is foregone. In gen
eral, the problem with the
fairies is that the "bird-like"
idea was not very carefully
developed. If they were in
tended to be graceful free
spirits, they should have done
much more work on bird-like
motion and the costumes
should have been considerably
sleeker. If they were intended
to be fairly animal-like, the at
tempts at bird movement, or
graceful movement of any

kind, should have been
foregone completely. As it
was, the actors trying to float
and glide tended to look like
half-plucked chickens at
tempting Swan Lake.
The saving element of the
entire show, aside from
Helena's performance, was the
presentation of the mechani
cals. The Athenian handymen,
banded together to perform a
play for Theseus, were consis
tently hysterical. Edmondson
