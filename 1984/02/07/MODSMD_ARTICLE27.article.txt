## XTC Mummer 
### 
The records that appear here are those thai the music staff at
KZSU feels have exceptional merit. Tracks off these albums
are highlighted during ZOO Preview airing Tuesdays from 5-
6 p.m.

Mummer, the sixth album
from XTC. is perhaps the
group's most inward-looking
and contemplative work to
date. Shunning trends seems
to be XTC's forte; as a
result. Mummer is without a
trace of pretension or self
indulgence. It continues the
acoustic tendencies of En
glish Settlement. XTC's most
recent album, and also
retains the themes found in
English rural life.
("Mummer" refers to a
form of English rural
theater or mime; in a gen
eral sense, it calls forth
images of a simpler time in
history.)
Many of the songs on
Mummer retain the pop sen
sibilities of earlier XTC
works such as White Noise,
Drums and Wires and Black
Sea. but seem more personal
and positive than their
predecessors. "Love on A
Farmboy's Wages,"
"Beating of Hearts," and
"Great Fire," remind us of
Andy Partridge's genius for

combining a wicked pun
with an appealing melody.
Partridge is especially effec
tive with "Funk Pop a
Roll," a damning indictment
of mass-music marketing
where "Everything you eat
is a waste/But swallowing is
easy when it has no taste."
On the other hand, Colin
Moulding's compositions,
"In Loving Memory of a
Name" and "Wonderland."
are typically lighter fare and
lack the acerbic wit evident
in Partridge's work.
Last year, XTC decided
to stop touring — albums
like Mummer make that
decision all the more la
mentable.
