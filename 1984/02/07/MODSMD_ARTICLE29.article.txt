# Playwright David Henry Hwang talks of successful career after Stanford
## 
### NEVA BUYCO 
When David Henry Hwang
was a student at Stanford, he
was not planning to write plays
as a career. In fact, by the time
he was a senior, lie really had no
idea about what lie was going
to do with his life. Yet since his
graduation in 11J79.l l J79. Hwang lias
accomplished a Kit and made a
big impression on the theater
world. He has written four
plays, all of which have been
produced in New York and
other major cities around the
world; he lias won the Best
Play Obie Award and a Drama
Desk nomination; lie lias sold
two iif his screenplays to film
producers and a television pilot
to Norman Lear; and he is cur
rently working on his first mu
sical production.
Hwang wrote his first play.
"FOB," in 1979 when lie was a
Stanford senior. He also co
founded Stanford's Asian
American Theater Project with
another student, Nancy
Takahaslii. and "FOB
premiered as the project's first
production. That same year.
Hwang submitted liis piece to
the National Playwrights Con
ference for consideration.
"FOB" was selected by the
conference and then produced
at the Hugene O'Neill National
Playwrights Conlerencc that
summer. Hie play was directed
by Robert Alan Ackerman.
who was then a resident direc
tor for Joseph Papp's New
York Shakespeare Festival.
Ackerman wanted to do more
work with "FOB" and arranged
a reading of the script tor
Papp. Papp apparently liked
"FOB" and had it produced at
the Public Theater of his New

York Shakespeare Festival
during the summer of 1980.
This achievement enabled
Hwang to get a foot in the
door to the field of play
writing and production. Since
then, he has written three
more plays and has had them all
produced by Papp. These in
clude "The Dance and the Rail
road" (which is currently
running in San Francisco),
"Family Devotions" and
"Sound and Beauty" (a combi
nation of two one-act plays).
Papp is also producing Hwang's
most recent work, "Five Guys
Named Moe," a musical he co
wrote with Lenore Kletter and
Felix Cavalari.
Hwang gets inspiration for
all his plays from problems he
does not understand but finds
intriguing. He figures that it
lie doesn't understand a prob
lem. then it's because the prob
lem is rich and complex enough
that it would make a good
story. When Hwang begins a
play, lie usually does not know
how it is going to end.
Sometimes lie may have an idea
of where the play is going, but
not how lie's going to get
there.
"Part of the adventure of
writing a play is finding out
how it is I'm going to reach
that point that I've set out to
get to." Hwang says. "It's like
if you're a runner or something
and you're trying to run Bay
to-Breakers and you know you
have to get there. The ques
tion is how you're going to do
ii. I think writing a play is sort
of analogous to that."
Of course, much of Hwang's
writing conies from personal
experience as well. For exam

pic, at the time lie wrote "The
Dance and the Railroad" in
1980, Hwang saw play writing
as a possible career and wanted
to explore the relationship be
tween art and work. He
wanted to know what you do if
your art doesn't support you
and you need to work at an
other job and how that has an
effect on you.
"You take personal concerns,
and even if you put it into a
context which is totally
removed from yourself, you
still try to make it relate some
how," he says. This idea is ex
emplified in "The Dance and
the Railroad," which concerns a
former student of Beijing
Opera who must leave his
homeland and his art to go to
the United States and work on
the Transcontinental Railroad
to earn a living.
Personal experience also
prevails in Hwang's works as
the main subject matter deals
with Asian America. "When
you first start out writing, you
write about the things that are
closest to yourself ... 1 had
more questions about what it
was like to be Asian' American
when I was younger," says
Hwang, a Chinese American
who hails from Los Angeles.
"FOB" and "Family Devo
tions" are both about Chinese
Americans, their relationships
with people who are actually
from Asia and what they all
learn as the two different
cultures meet. In these plays.
Hwang makes the Asian char
acters as human as possible.
This idea is an innovation, ac
cording to Hwang, because
most Asian Americans are
portrayed in fiction as one

dimensional characters.
As Asian American subjects
aren't the norm for most plays,
how was it that Hwang's works
were so well received by the
public? Hwang feels that the
popularity of his plays come as
a result of an increased inter
est in Asians right now . He sees
good and bad reasons for this
fascination.
"The good reason is that

there's a percentage of the
population, I think, that's be
coming more interested in the
idea of accepting America as a
pluralistic culture." he says.
"This means, basically, accept
ing the notion that the
country is a patchwork of dif
ferent peoples and different
cultures and trying to find out
about the situations of
cultures other than them
selves."
He said lie thinks that a bad
reason is that there is a certain
amount of fashion in this in
terest. as seen with the
growing amount of Japanese

clothes, technology and music
in the market today. "There's a
Japanese chic that's running
around and that tends to be
applied across the board to
tilings that are Asian. Com
pounded by the fact that since
the U.S. and China opened up
diplomatic relations, there's
been a lot of interest in China.
Asia in general tickles
America's fancy at this partic-

ular moment." He feels that
this interest won't last long,
however, because in history.
Western culture has gone
through Asian phases regularly
and then out of them.
About the direction that
Asian American theater is
going. Hwang feels that he,
Phillip Ootanda and Rich
Shiomi are the three Asian
American playwrights doing
the most work these days, and
all are planning to concentrate
on cross-over work. That is.
work that crosses over from
directing the story at a partic
ular group and audience that

the play is trying to portray, to
directing the story at the
larger society. "We want to
have an impact on American
society as a whole," Hwang
says.
Their dilemma now is trying
to determine how to appeal to
a wider audience and have a
greater impact than they've
had so far. Hwang cited Wayne
Wang, who made the film
Chan Is Missing, as an Asian
American artist who has suc
cessfully crossed over. "We all
seem to want to work more or
less within some sort of system
. . . None of us are real revolu
tionaries per se. 1 mean, we
don't want to overthrow the
system, but we want to im
prove it. So, given that you
have this system that exists
and that you're going to work
within it. how do you maximize
the amount of power you have
within the system in order to
do what you want to do?"
Hwang said he feels that you
can't get the power you want
if you only write for Asians. He
admits that this is not a partic
ularly happy fact, but "it's a
fact of the society we live in
that until you do something
which is related to mainstream
culture, that you're perceived
as being a second-class writer,
second-class artist, whatever.
That's something that's sort
of irritating. But I think that
ii has to be dealt with as we try
and work within the system
and carve out a place tor our
selves."
As far as the future is con
cerned, Hwang plans to
continue writing plays and
screenplays. He says he hopes
to one day have an access to

film just as he now has an
access to the stage. Why this
interest in film? "You come up
with certain ideas as a writer
and you want to put all the
ideas in the best home as possi
ble. Some ideas are better
suited to the stage, some ideas
are better suited to film, some
should be novels."
Hwang plans to buy a con
dominium in Los Angeles to
add to the one he has in New
York. He would like to live
closer to Hollywood in order to
get a feel for the industry. He
also hopes to work and obtain
that access into film. Once he
has that, he'd like to go into
directing film. One thing that
he'd love to be able to do is
direct a major motion picture
that deals primarily with
Asians.
"This would probably be a
culmination of a lot of things
I'm working towards .... A lot
of the projects that I'm doing
which are not Asian are things
that I like very much, but
they're also things that are de
signed to put me in a position
where I can decide to do some
thing which is very unorthodox.
A film really depicting Asians
as true people would be a very
unorthodox thing." Hwang is
aware of films such as Francis
Ford Coppola's The Godfa
ther and Martin Scorsese's
Mean Streets, which depict
Italian Americans, a communi
ty seen through a lot of
stereotypes. "They took the
stereotypes and sort of showed
the whole context of them and
showed how they were really
human. They changed a lot of
perceptions and I'd love to be
able to do that with Asians.''

Hwang wrote his first play.
"FOB," in 1979 when lie was a
Stanford senior. He also co
founded Stanford's Asian
American Theater Project with
another student, Nancy
Takahaslii. and "FOB
premiered as the project's first
production. That same year.
Hwang submitted liis piece to
the National Playwrights Con
ference for consideration.
"FOB" was selected by the
conference and then produced
at the Hugene O'Neill National
Playwrights Conlerencc that
summer. Hie play was directed
by Robert Alan Ackerman.
who was then a resident direc
tor for Joseph Papp's New
York Shakespeare Festival.
Ackerman wanted to do more
work with "FOB" and arranged
a reading of the script tor
Papp. Papp apparently liked
"FOB" and had it produced at
the Public Theater of his New

York Shakespeare Festival
during the summer of 1980.
This achievement enabled
Hwang to get a foot in the
door to the field of play
writing and production. Since
then, he has written three
more plays and has had them all
produced by Papp. These in
clude "The Dance and the Rail
road" (which is currently
running in San Francisco),
"Family Devotions" and
"Sound and Beauty" (a combi
nation of two one-act plays).
Papp is also producing Hwang's
most recent work, "Five Guys
Named Moe," a musical he co
wrote with Lenore Kletter and
Felix Cavalari.
Hwang gets inspiration for
all his plays from problems he
does not understand but finds
intriguing. He figures that it
lie doesn't understand a prob
lem. then it's because the prob
lem is rich and complex enough
that it would make a good
story. When Hwang begins a
play, lie usually does not know
how it is going to end.
Sometimes lie may have an idea
of where the play is going, but
not how lie's going to get
there.
"Part of the adventure of
writing a play is finding out
how it is I'm going to reach
that point that I've set out to
get to." Hwang says. "It's like
if you're a runner or something
and you're trying to run Bay
to-Breakers and you know you
have to get there. The ques
tion is how you're going to do
ii. I think writing a play is sort
of analogous to that."
Of course, much of Hwang's
writing conies from personal
experience as well. For exam

pic, at the time lie wrote "The
Dance and the Railroad" in
1980, Hwang saw play writing
as a possible career and wanted
to explore the relationship be
tween art and work. He
wanted to know what you do if
your art doesn't support you
and you need to work at an
other job and how that has an
effect on you.
"You take personal concerns,
and even if you put it into a
context which is totally
removed from yourself, you
still try to make it relate some
how," he says. This idea is ex
emplified in "The Dance and
the Railroad," which concerns a
former student of Beijing
Opera who must leave his
homeland and his art to go to
the United States and work on
the Transcontinental Railroad
to earn a living.
Personal experience also
prevails in Hwang's works as
the main subject matter deals
with Asian America. "When
you first start out writing, you
write about the things that are
closest to yourself ... 1 had
more questions about what it
was like to be Asian' American
when I was younger," says
Hwang, a Chinese American
who hails from Los Angeles.
"FOB" and "Family Devo
tions" are both about Chinese
Americans, their relationships
with people who are actually
from Asia and what they all
learn as the two different
cultures meet. In these plays.
Hwang makes the Asian char
acters as human as possible.
This idea is an innovation, ac
cording to Hwang, because
most Asian Americans are
portrayed in fiction as one

dimensional characters.
As Asian American subjects
aren't the norm for most plays,
how was it that Hwang's works
were so well received by the
public? Hwang feels that the
popularity of his plays come as
a result of an increased inter
est in Asians right now . He sees
good and bad reasons for this
fascination.
"The good reason is that

there's a percentage of the
population, I think, that's be
coming more interested in the
idea of accepting America as a
pluralistic culture." he says.
"This means, basically, accept
ing the notion that the
country is a patchwork of dif
ferent peoples and different
cultures and trying to find out
about the situations of
cultures other than them
selves."
He said lie thinks that a bad
reason is that there is a certain
amount of fashion in this in
terest. as seen with the
growing amount of Japanese

clothes, technology and music
in the market today. "There's a
Japanese chic that's running
around and that tends to be
applied across the board to
tilings that are Asian. Com
pounded by the fact that since
the U.S. and China opened up
diplomatic relations, there's
been a lot of interest in China.
Asia in general tickles
America's fancy at this partic-

ular moment." He feels that
this interest won't last long,
however, because in history.
Western culture has gone
through Asian phases regularly
and then out of them.
About the direction that
Asian American theater is
going. Hwang feels that he,
Phillip Ootanda and Rich
Shiomi are the three Asian
American playwrights doing
the most work these days, and
all are planning to concentrate
on cross-over work. That is.
work that crosses over from
directing the story at a partic
ular group and audience that

the play is trying to portray, to
directing the story at the
larger society. "We want to
have an impact on American
society as a whole," Hwang
says.
Their dilemma now is trying
to determine how to appeal to
a wider audience and have a
greater impact than they've
had so far. Hwang cited Wayne
Wang, who made the film
Chan Is Missing, as an Asian
American artist who has suc
cessfully crossed over. "We all
seem to want to work more or
less within some sort of system
. . . None of us are real revolu
tionaries per se. 1 mean, we
don't want to overthrow the
system, but we want to im
prove it. So, given that you
have this system that exists
and that you're going to work
within it. how do you maximize
the amount of power you have
within the system in order to
do what you want to do?"
Hwang said he feels that you
can't get the power you want
if you only write for Asians. He
admits that this is not a partic
ularly happy fact, but "it's a
fact of the society we live in
that until you do something
which is related to mainstream
culture, that you're perceived
as being a second-class writer,
second-class artist, whatever.
That's something that's sort
of irritating. But I think that
ii has to be dealt with as we try
and work within the system
and carve out a place tor our
selves."
As far as the future is con
cerned, Hwang plans to
continue writing plays and
screenplays. He says he hopes
to one day have an access to

film just as he now has an
access to the stage. Why this
interest in film? "You come up
with certain ideas as a writer
and you want to put all the
ideas in the best home as possi
ble. Some ideas are better
suited to the stage, some ideas
are better suited to film, some
should be novels."
Hwang plans to buy a con
dominium in Los Angeles to
add to the one he has in New
York. He would like to live
closer to Hollywood in order to
get a feel for the industry. He
also hopes to work and obtain
that access into film. Once he
has that, he'd like to go into
directing film. One thing that
he'd love to be able to do is
direct a major motion picture
that deals primarily with
Asians.
"This would probably be a
culmination of a lot of things
I'm working towards .... A lot
of the projects that I'm doing
which are not Asian are things
that I like very much, but
they're also things that are de
signed to put me in a position
where I can decide to do some
thing which is very unorthodox.
A film really depicting Asians
as true people would be a very
unorthodox thing." Hwang is
aware of films such as Francis
Ford Coppola's The Godfa
ther and Martin Scorsese's
Mean Streets, which depict
Italian Americans, a communi
ty seen through a lot of
stereotypes. "They took the
stereotypes and sort of showed
the whole context of them and
showed how they were really
human. They changed a lot of
perceptions and I'd love to be
able to do that with Asians.''

Papp. Papp apparently liked
"FOB" and had it produced at
the Public Theater of his New

York Shakespeare Festival
during the summer of 1980.
This achievement enabled
Hwang to get a foot in the
door to the field of play
writing and production. Since
then, he has written three
more plays and has had them all
produced by Papp. These in
clude "The Dance and the Rail
road" (which is currently
running in San Francisco),
"Family Devotions" and
"Sound and Beauty" (a combi
nation of two one-act plays).
Papp is also producing Hwang's
most recent work, "Five Guys
Named Moe," a musical he co
wrote with Lenore Kletter and
Felix Cavalari.
Hwang gets inspiration for
all his plays from problems he
does not understand but finds
intriguing. He figures that it
lie doesn't understand a prob
lem. then it's because the prob
lem is rich and complex enough
that it would make a good
story. When Hwang begins a
play, lie usually does not know
how it is going to end.
Sometimes lie may have an idea
of where the play is going, but
not how lie's going to get
there.
"Part of the adventure of
writing a play is finding out
how it is I'm going to reach
that point that I've set out to
get to." Hwang says. "It's like
if you're a runner or something
and you're trying to run Bay
to-Breakers and you know you
have to get there. The ques
tion is how you're going to do
ii. I think writing a play is sort
of analogous to that."
Of course, much of Hwang's
writing conies from personal
experience as well. For exam

pic, at the time lie wrote "The
Dance and the Railroad" in
1980, Hwang saw play writing
as a possible career and wanted
to explore the relationship be
tween art and work. He
wanted to know what you do if
your art doesn't support you
and you need to work at an
other job and how that has an
effect on you.
"You take personal concerns,
and even if you put it into a
context which is totally
removed from yourself, you
still try to make it relate some
how," he says. This idea is ex
emplified in "The Dance and
the Railroad," which concerns a
former student of Beijing
Opera who must leave his
homeland and his art to go to
the United States and work on
the Transcontinental Railroad
to earn a living.
Personal experience also
prevails in Hwang's works as
the main subject matter deals
with Asian America. "When
you first start out writing, you
write about the things that are
closest to yourself ... 1 had
more questions about what it
was like to be Asian' American
when I was younger," says
Hwang, a Chinese American
who hails from Los Angeles.
"FOB" and "Family Devo
tions" are both about Chinese
Americans, their relationships
with people who are actually
from Asia and what they all
learn as the two different
cultures meet. In these plays.
Hwang makes the Asian char
acters as human as possible.
This idea is an innovation, ac
cording to Hwang, because
most Asian Americans are
portrayed in fiction as one

dimensional characters.
As Asian American subjects
aren't the norm for most plays,
how was it that Hwang's works
were so well received by the
public? Hwang feels that the
popularity of his plays come as
a result of an increased inter
est in Asians right now . He sees
good and bad reasons for this
fascination.
"The good reason is that

there's a percentage of the
population, I think, that's be
coming more interested in the
idea of accepting America as a
pluralistic culture." he says.
"This means, basically, accept
ing the notion that the
country is a patchwork of dif
ferent peoples and different
cultures and trying to find out
about the situations of
cultures other than them
selves."
He said lie thinks that a bad
reason is that there is a certain
amount of fashion in this in
terest. as seen with the
growing amount of Japanese

clothes, technology and music
in the market today. "There's a
Japanese chic that's running
around and that tends to be
applied across the board to
tilings that are Asian. Com
pounded by the fact that since
the U.S. and China opened up
diplomatic relations, there's
been a lot of interest in China.
Asia in general tickles
America's fancy at this partic-

ular moment." He feels that
this interest won't last long,
however, because in history.
Western culture has gone
through Asian phases regularly
and then out of them.
About the direction that
Asian American theater is
going. Hwang feels that he,
Phillip Ootanda and Rich
Shiomi are the three Asian
American playwrights doing
the most work these days, and
all are planning to concentrate
on cross-over work. That is.
work that crosses over from
directing the story at a partic
ular group and audience that

the play is trying to portray, to
directing the story at the
larger society. "We want to
have an impact on American
society as a whole," Hwang
says.
Their dilemma now is trying
to determine how to appeal to
a wider audience and have a
greater impact than they've
had so far. Hwang cited Wayne
Wang, who made the film
Chan Is Missing, as an Asian
American artist who has suc
cessfully crossed over. "We all
seem to want to work more or
less within some sort of system
. . . None of us are real revolu
tionaries per se. 1 mean, we
don't want to overthrow the
system, but we want to im
prove it. So, given that you
have this system that exists
and that you're going to work
within it. how do you maximize
the amount of power you have
within the system in order to
do what you want to do?"
Hwang said he feels that you
can't get the power you want
if you only write for Asians. He
admits that this is not a partic
ularly happy fact, but "it's a
fact of the society we live in
that until you do something
which is related to mainstream
culture, that you're perceived
as being a second-class writer,
second-class artist, whatever.
That's something that's sort
of irritating. But I think that
ii has to be dealt with as we try
and work within the system
and carve out a place tor our
selves."
As far as the future is con
cerned, Hwang plans to
continue writing plays and
screenplays. He says he hopes
to one day have an access to

film just as he now has an
access to the stage. Why this
interest in film? "You come up
with certain ideas as a writer
and you want to put all the
ideas in the best home as possi
ble. Some ideas are better
suited to the stage, some ideas
are better suited to film, some
should be novels."
Hwang plans to buy a con
dominium in Los Angeles to
add to the one he has in New
York. He would like to live
closer to Hollywood in order to
get a feel for the industry. He
also hopes to work and obtain
that access into film. Once he
has that, he'd like to go into
directing film. One thing that
he'd love to be able to do is
direct a major motion picture
that deals primarily with
Asians.
"This would probably be a
culmination of a lot of things
I'm working towards .... A lot
of the projects that I'm doing
which are not Asian are things
that I like very much, but
they're also things that are de
signed to put me in a position
where I can decide to do some
thing which is very unorthodox.
A film really depicting Asians
as true people would be a very
unorthodox thing." Hwang is
aware of films such as Francis
Ford Coppola's The Godfa
ther and Martin Scorsese's
Mean Streets, which depict
Italian Americans, a communi
ty seen through a lot of
stereotypes. "They took the
stereotypes and sort of showed
the whole context of them and
showed how they were really
human. They changed a lot of
perceptions and I'd love to be
able to do that with Asians.''
