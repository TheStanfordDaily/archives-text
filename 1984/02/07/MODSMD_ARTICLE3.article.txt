# Hart's campaign may be misusing ASSU postage
## 
### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
The Stanford Students With Hart
campaign may have violated Univer
sity guidelines on partisan political
activities by using University
facilities to send out political
mailings and coordinate events.
A three-page fund-raising mailer
for presidential candidate Sen. Gary
Hart (D-Colo.) was recently sent out
under the ASSU's non-profit organi
zation bulk rate mailing permit. The
return address on the mailer was the
ASSU Office at Tresidder Union.
The Hart campaign did reimburse
the ASSU for postage. The ASSU al
lows any student organization, even
partisan political campaigns, to use
its facilities, including its non-profit
organization bulk rate permit.
But according to Tresidder Union
Director Ellen Oppenheim, "The
University guidelines are quite ex
plicit in stating that no University
address may be used as return address
for a political mailing, and no Univer
sity office may be used to support a
political campaign."
Oppenheim is the acting director
of the Oftice of Student Activities,
which is responsible for recognizing
and overseeing voluntary student or
ganizations on campus. She said she
would be looking into the matter be
cause "it raises a number of issues
that are quite significant."
Addressed to "Local Hart Sup
porters," the letter tells would-be
benefactors that they can "send a
check for Americans With Hart to us
and we will forward it to the national
campaign."
The letter also invites the
recipient to a Valentine's Day party
for Hart. In order to attend the
party, the recipient must make a
minimum cont
University telephones may also
have been used by the campaign.
When The Daily called a University
number in the Mechanical Engineer

ing Department and asked for the
"Students for Hart campaign," cam
paign coordinator Rick Roby an
swered "Can 1 help you?" Roby is a
graduate student in Mechanical Engi
neering.
A memo obtained from the
Registrar's Office outlines the Uni
versity position on partisan political
activities. According to the memo,
"The University is prohibited by law
from intervening in any manner on
behalf of any candidate for public
office, including such activities as
solicitation of funds or endorse
ments. No group or individual sup
porting candidates for public office
or engaging in other political activi
ties may use University space or
facilities or receive University sup
port."
The memo specifically prohibits
the use of the University's name, ad
d*er>s :or telephones. University
office or student, faculty or staff
member's office may be used as a
return mailing address for political
mailings. University telephone num

hers may not be used as a source of
information about such matters."
Office of Student Affairs Office
Manager Gloria Johnston said the
Students for Hart campaign "is not
really considered a partisan political
organization."
"Politically based student organi
zations are here to educate students
regarding political activities,"
Johnston said. She noted, however,
that these organizations should not
do fund raising if the purpose of the
campaign is strictly to provide candi
dates with money.
After examining the mailing.
Johnston said, "This is an off-campus
activity, so we have no control over
it."
But other University officials saw
the matter differently.
"1 would not expect that such ar
organization would be able to use an)
University permit,, including thi
ASSU permit, for fund raising," Uni
versity Registrar Sally Mahoney said.
