# Reagan library issue complex, frustrating

When University President Donald Ken
nedy last week pointed out that Stanford
could not make final plans for a Ronald
Reagan presidential library until after the No
vember election, a number of reporters and
other observers seemed taken aback.

Reporter's Notebook

Newspapers and wire services ran stories em
phasizing that if the president is re-elected, it
could be years before a site and design are cho
sen for the Reagan library. The stories ne
glected to mention that the library's future
here is still in considerable doubt.
That final arrangements for a library can't
be made until it is known how much material
the library must house — as Kennedy put it,
"the knowledge of whether we had four years'

It has been three years since officials at the
Hoover Institution first began to talk of
housing a Reagan library at Stanford, but not

for the arguments seemed clear and simple,

was in a hurry to resolve the matter before
the campaign season began.

simplistic days — were officials from the
Hoover Institution and the White House, who

proposal to bring a Reagan library, museum
and public affairs center to Stanford.
On the other was the University, which was
being urged by some vocal students, faculty
members and powerful alumni to reject a
Reagan complex at all costs and by others to
embrace the complex with open arms.
It was Hoover, whose role on campus was
already being questioned, against Stanford,
which from the start was skeptical about
Hoover's plan to administer the public affairs
center. It was Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell against Kennedy — two strong
willed administrators who had never been
close — pitted in opposition in a controversy
sure to draw national attention.

December, and the Board of Trustees
meeting that came with it, has come and gone,
