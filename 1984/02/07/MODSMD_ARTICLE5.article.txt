# Despite Super Bowl, Stadium tax-exempt
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Staff writer 
Hosting the 1985 National Foot
ball League Super Bowl game will
"hopefully not change the tax
exempt status" of the Stanford
Stadium, according to Lee
Thompson, associate staff counsel.
The stadium lies on a parcel of land
that includes the University Hospital
buildings, some of which are taxed.
The stadium, however, remains tax
exempt because of an understanding
that athletics are part of the educa
tion received by students.
"All money retained (profit) goes
straight into the Athletic Depart
ment. and the additional income sup
ports other inter-collegiate sports,"
said Raymond Bacchetti, director of
university budgets.
However, concern has surfaced
that the Super Bowl may alter the
purpose of the facility, because the
Super Bowl is a solely profit-making
venture and because the athletes in
volved are not students but profes
sionals.
Although the University and the
tax authorities "haven't settled
down on anything yet." Thompson
said he foresees several answers to
those problems.
The game will be only a one-day
event, he noted, and the use of the
stadium will actually benefit the rest
of the Bay Area as much or more
than the University. In addition, the
game can be viewed as an educational
endeavor because it will be a recruit

ing tool for academics and athletics.
In addition, the Super Bowl will he.
financially, "a break-even arrange
ment tor Stanford." Thompson said.
The University will have nothing to
do with Super Bowl tickets, and the
only duty of the University will he to
"supply a stadium ready for the

game." he said.
The University will provide a field
and seats, hut it the NFL wants a
logo on the grass, extra security, or
anything else, the league will pay for
the extra measures on its own.
"One of the principal reasons we're

hosting is to be a good neighbor,"
Bacchetti said.
The sole benefit to the University
will be physieal improvements made
on the stadium by the NFL.. Bac
chetti said. These improvements will
include new locker rooms and renova
tions of the press box and rest rooms.
