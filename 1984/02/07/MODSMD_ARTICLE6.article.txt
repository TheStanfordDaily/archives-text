Reagan asks Syria to halt
supply of terrorist weapons
Dixon, 111. — President Reagan yesterday reaffirmed the
U.S. commitment to the government of Lebanese Presi
dent Amin Ciemayel and called on Syria, which he said
"facilitates and supplies instruments for terroristic at
tacks." to stop the Moslem-initiated lighting in Beirut.
In a prepared statement released while he was visiting his
hometown, Reagan also called on all sides in the Lebanese
conflict to form a new. broader government of national
reconciliation under Gemayel. a Maronite Christian.
Reagan's statement did not mention the U.S. Marines
who are hunkered down at Beirut International Airport as
part o! a four-nation peacekeeping force. And it was not
clear from comments by administration officials that the
American force would remain if Gemayel is ousted, as the
Moslem factions have demanded. »
Presidential spokesman Larry Speakes said Reagan did
not intend to signal any change in the administration's de
termination to keep the Marines in Beirut.
Similarly, a White House official in Washington said the
president was "not backing away from his commitment to
full U.S. participation in the multinational force and sup
port for the legitimate Gemayel government of Lebanon."
Shuttle loses second satellite
Cape Canaveral, l la. — The shuttle astronauts launched
an Indonesian satellite yesterday, but the manufacturer
declared it lost in space when it disappeared from view of
radar trackers just like its twin three days ago.
Giant radar screens were trying to find the communica
tions satellite, called Palapa 82. The North American
Defense Command was called in. just as it had been when
Westar VI disappeared Friday.
"Hughes tracking personnel have confirmed the satellite
cannot be found in its expected orbit," said a one-sentence
NASA announcement by mission control's Brian Welch six
hours after the satellite was ejected from the shuttle.
It was the third setback for the Challenger flight. Wes
tar VI, launched for Western Union, is in a useless orbit
after the failure of a rocket; on Sunday, a balloon exploded
ruining a rendezvous exercise.
Today, the astronauts plan the most daring part ot their
mission — making the first walk into space without a
lifeline.
The astronauts apparently were told about the latest
satellite failure in a teleprinter message. There was no com
ment from space.
Democrats delay consideration
of Marine withdrawal proposal
Washington — House Democrats, fearful that they will
be blamed for upsetting Lebanon's delicate political bal
ance. postponed further action yesterday on their resolu
tion calling for a "prompt and orderly" withdrawal of U.S.
Marines from Beirut.
Bringing the controversial hut non-binding resolution to
a \ote amid the renewed fighting in Beirut would "give
(President Reagan) an excuse to pin the blame on the
Democrats for bringing about the collapse in Lebanon, even
it we had nothing to do with it," said Rep. Stephen Solarz
(D-N.Y.). a member of the House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee.
The committee's Democrats, meeting in closed session,
decided to postpone a drafting session that had been sched
uled for the full committee today. Republicans on the
panel had also asked for the delay.
"We did not want to add to the danger the Marines are
already in," Chairman Dante Fascell (D-Fla.), said. He
added that the committee was not likely to finish its work
on the proposal until after Congress returned from its
weeklong Lincoln's birthday recess, scheduled to begin
Friday. But he predicted that the resolution would eventu
ally pass the House with "the same resolve."
Reserve to limit money supply
Washington — The Federal Reserve Board, worried about
"temptations" for the economy to return to rapid infla
tion. announced yesterday that it would tighten restric
tions on the money supply this year, a policy likely to keep
interest rates high both for consumers and businesses.
The economy will keep expanding despite the stringent
policy, although growth will he slower than in 19N3, the
Federal Reserve predicted in its semi-annual report to
Congress.
But housing and business investment, both dependent on
borrowed money, will "operate well below their underlying
potential," the report said.
Only a major cut of $50 billion a year in the deficit, far
more than the "down payment" suggested by the Reagan
administration, could reassure the financial markets and
help lower interest rates. Federal Reserve officials said. A
substantial reduction is essential "if you want to have an
impact" on the rates, said a high-ranking Fed official who
asked not to be identified.
Glenn plans teen jobs funding
Durham, N.H. — Democratic presidential contender
John Glenn proposed a New Deal-style $652 million plan
yesterday to combat teenage unemployment and finance
college educations for students willing to serve in the mili
tary.
"If our youth will invest in America, then America will in
vest in them and both will benefit." the Ohio Democrat
said in a speech at the University of New Hampshire, where
he unveiled his three-part "Volunteers for America" plan.
One program under the plan calls for students to work in
community service jobs at libraries, parks, day-care centers
and other public institutions. Glenn calls that program Stu
dent Aid for Volunteer Earnings.
Glenn's second program, the American Conservation
Corps, would be aimed at cleaning up the environment and
providing jobs such as replanting trees and restocking
streams, "the kind of work that young volunteers could do
and would enjoy doing." he said.
Stocks show year's worst loss
New York — The stock market suffered its worst beating
in more than a year yesterday reflecting Wall Street's tear
that interest rates will remain stubbornly high and its dis
appointment with corporate profit reports.
I'he closely watched Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip
stocks fell 22.72 points to 1174.31. its lowest level since
Aug. V last year, as money managers at pension funds, bank
trust departments and mutual funds cashed in stock hol
dings.
