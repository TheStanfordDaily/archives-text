Beirut, Lebanon — Moslem and Druse militiamen
seized much of Lebanon's capital ci t> in heavy light
ing yesterday and demanded the resignation of Presi
dent Amin Gemayel. whose authority and arm\ face
their most serious crisis since he came to power 16
months ago.
Iwo carrier-based I S. warplanes bombed what
American officials said were insurgent artillery sites
in the mountains east of Beirut last night and a U.S.
Navy vessel shelled targets in the same area after the
U.S. Marine headquarters at the Beirut International
Airport came under attack.
At least 17 Lebanese and one French soldier of the
multinational peacekeeping force were reported
killed yesterday, two French and eight Italian soldiers
were wounded, and one U.S. Marine received a minor
wound, military officials said.
Gemayel. whose presidential palace in suburban
Brabda also came under shelling, continued efforts to
form a new Cabinet to replace the one that was dis
solved Sunday after Moslem members resigned.
Druse leader Walid Jumblatt and Shiite Moslem
leader Nabih Berri called yesterday for Gemayel's res
ignation. but there was no indication that he would
quit.
The Lebanese army clamped a shoot-to-kill curfew
at 1:30 yesterday afternoon as street battles flared
in the heart of the capital between army units and
marauding bands of opposition militias.
By late last night, fires burned out of control in
several Beirut neighborhoods. Shells continued to
land in west Beirut, as well as in the eastern and
southern sections of the city, as the Shiite and Druse
militias attempted to wrest complete control of key

areas from the tottering Lebanese army.
The swift push into the capital by the anti
government forces came a day after Prime Minister
Shafik Wa//an. a Sunni Moslem, resigned from the
Cabinet in what he said was an effort to bring recon
ciliation in a country torn by hostilities between
Gemayel's Christian faction and Syrian-backed Shiite
and Druse forces.
Berri and Jumblatt. leaders of the country's two
most powerful opposition militia forces, yesterday
rejected an appeal Gemayel made on television Sun
day night for a resumption of national reconciliation
talks. Berri. head of Amal. the mainstream Shiite
Moslem movement, and Jumblatt declared they
would continue fighting until Gemayel resigned.
Gemayel's ability to re-establish security in the be
sieged capital was put in doubt by the defection of an
undetermined number of Moslems in the army to the
side of the militias and the refusal of others to par
ticipate in the fighting.
This, together with deepened Moslem disaffection
and resentment toward Gemayel. suggested that the
army may have more difficulty this time asserting its
authority over Beirut than it did during its move in
Moslem-populated west Beirut last August.
Panic gripped the city yesterday in the face of a
breakdown of what was left of law and order. The
curfew announcement broadcast on state-run Beirut
radio sent protective metal shutters 011 stores in the
capital's commercial center thudding closed and
people scurrying home for cover.
"Curfew is hereby imposed from this hour. 1:30
p.m., until further notice," the army order said as
gunfire crackled through business and residential dis
tricts in west Beirut that up to now had largely been
spared the heavy shelling dealt the southern sections

Nt the city. "Violators will be shot without warning."
the army said.
Determined to end Gemayel's presidency. Druse
and Sunni Murabitoun fighters teamed with ir
regulars of Amal in mounting attacks on army check
points and patrols in the city's western sections
Gun battles were reported around the state television
station in west Beirut and the nearby home of Wa/-
zan.
Several shells hit near the U.S. and British em
bassies in northwest Beirut, and a l-rench soldier was
killed and two wounded when a rocket hit the
headquarters of the French multinational force con
tingent. Eight Italian troops were wounded in shelling
near their headquarters at the Sabra and Shatilla
refugee camps in southern Beirut.
"We are at the end now. believe me." said a furious
Berri. when asked if an all-out war was coming.
Standing in a hallway of his home, the normally
reserved Shiite chief bitterly denounced Gemayel for
allowing the army to commit what he termed a
• massacre" in the heavily Shiite-populated southern
neighborhoods of Beirut in recent days.
Dismissing Gemayel's invitation to join in another
round of national reconciliation talks. Berri declared
that he would not call off his Amal fighters until
Gemayel quits.
Opposition leaders on the Christian as well as the
Moslem side of Lebanon's religious divide have
accused Gemayel. a Maronite Catholic, of appearing
to favor too much the interests of the right-wing
Christian Phalangist Party headed by his father, the
aging Pierre Gemayel. He in turn has repeatedly
voiced a readiness to consider political reforms and a
different power-sharing arrangement with his politi
cal opponents.
