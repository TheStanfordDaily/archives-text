A Europe-bound college stu

teacher and a Danish actor.
Sound like four unrelated
people? They are diverse in all
ways except one. They all see,
and are seen by, many Stanford
students each day.
Who are they? One final

"Thank you." Click.
Of course! They are identifi

This job takes up four hours
of their time each day. With
the rest of their time, all of
the portal people pursue a vari
ety of diversions.
"I fish under the Golden
Gate Bridge, watch a lot of
movies, work on my truck,"
said Chris Farris, now in the
middle of his college career
"Every weekend I try to do
something, if it's just going to
San Francisco and eating all
day," Farris said.
Farris is interrupting his
studies to earn money for a
trip to Europe with his wife in
May.
"The trip will push back my
graduation date by six or seven
months, but it'll be worth it,"
Farris said.
Before entering college, Far
ris was a Marine. "I loved the
Marine Corps. I loved the
people. I loved my job ...
There's nothing like driving a
10-ton truck over sand
dunes."

Dressed in a sweat jacket,
jeans, and sneakers, the small
framed Farris shows no hint of
his earlier military role. Rather,
he looks and speaks like a typi
cal college student.
I've been reading a lot of
magazines and newspapers
lately, hut no hooks. I've been
in school for the past two or
three years. I don't want to

read books now," he said.
Velma Rockwell, however, a
fellow worker and former
Stanford student, reads heav
ily to satisfy her curiosity in so
cial and cultural history. "I'm
most interested in oral his
tories," she said. "They're told
to the children, but adults of
ten put in their own feelings
... You learn of the traditions
that way."

Rockwell recently visited a
retirement home to collect the
residents' personal stories. She
hopes to use the material one
day for her own writing.
Fingering a turquoise pen
dant on a heavy silver chain
that compliments her gray hair,
Rockwell named arts and
crafts as a hobby. "Boyd calls
me 'artsy craftsy,' " she said.
"Boyd" is her co-worker

Boyd Murphy, who is often
seen in a dark coat and tie,
swinging a cane next to his
stocky body.
Like Rockwell. Murphy is a
history fan, but his main inter
est is in the development of in
tellectual thought in history.
He studied philosophy as an
undergraduate at Bowdoin
College in Maine, went to

graduate school and later
taught high school history and
English. Now he takes advan
tage of his library privileges to
read up on intellectual history,
as well as other topics.
Because of his broad inter
ests, Murphy claims no hobbies
— unless talking can be consid
ered a hobby. "I think I have a
fairly well-rounded education
. . . I'm interested in talking to
anyone. I love good conversa
tion."
He diverted his attention
briefly to direct a student to
the privili s window of the li
brary. Continuing, he said with
a roaring laugh, "I'm just an old
bachelor who spent his life
reading. What the hell, I
oughta know something."
It's the end of his shift
Getting up, he gives his seat to
Fritz Brun. a Stanford
graduate drama student from
Denmark.
Brun was a professional ac
tor in his home country for 25
years before coming to Stan
ford. Dissatisfied with drama
in Denmark, Brun is deter
mined to stay in America after
his studies if he has some way
of supporting himself.
"You know the story of Rac
hel and Leah in the Blfile?" he
asks in his Danish accent.
"Jacob spent seven years
working for Rachel's father to
win her hand. At the end of
the seven years the father gave
him his other daughter, Leah,
instead. The man worked seven
more years. At the end of
those seven years the father fi

nally gave him Rachel. I've been
in America close to seven years
to become an American Ph.D.
I'll stay here another seven
years to gain a foothold, and
I'll not quit before then."
In Denmark, the interpreta
tion of all drama is one-sided:
Marxist, according to Brun. "If
they performed Hamlet in
Denmark, the grave-diggers
would be the heros."
Another reason for leaving
Denmark, Brun adds, is that
"it's a personal liberation to
get away from home. ... A lot
of American writers went to
Paris; I came here."
Recalling how he first
became interested in drama,
Brun said, "1 grew up during
World War II and naively
thought that art was the only
part of human endeavors that
could not be used for evil. God
seemed meaningless when there
was war and evil ... I was a
born outsider, seeing things
with a critical tendency."
Today, Brun seems to see no
clear distinction between
drama and life. To him, drama
is a way of actors and audience
"confirming a bit of life to
gether."
While playing the part of a
bum in Los Angeles recently,
Brun was mistaken for a real
bum. "1 think I was convincing
because I study bums. I study
bums because I'm interested.
Who knows? I might be a bum
myself one day."

in school for the past two or
three years. I don't want to

read books now," he said.
Velma Rockwell, however, a
fellow worker and former
Stanford student, reads heav
ily to satisfy her curiosity in so
cial and cultural history. "I'm
most interested in oral his
tories," she said. "They're told
to the children, but adults of
ten put in their own feelings
... You learn of the traditions
that way."

Rockwell recently visited a
retirement home to collect the
residents' personal stories. She
hopes to use the material one
day for her own writing.
Fingering a turquoise pen
dant on a heavy silver chain
that compliments her gray hair,
Rockwell named arts and
crafts as a hobby. "Boyd calls
me 'artsy craftsy,' " she said.
"Boyd" is her co-worker

Boyd Murphy, who is often
seen in a dark coat and tie,
swinging a cane next to his
stocky body.
Like Rockwell. Murphy is a
history fan, but his main inter
est is in the development of in
tellectual thought in history.
He studied philosophy as an
undergraduate at Bowdoin
College in Maine, went to

graduate school and later
taught high school history and
English. Now he takes advan
tage of his library privileges to
read up on intellectual history,
as well as other topics.
Because of his broad inter
ests, Murphy claims no hobbies
— unless talking can be consid
ered a hobby. "I think I have a
fairly well-rounded education
. . . I'm interested in talking to
anyone. I love good conversa
tion."
He diverted his attention
briefly to direct a student to
the privili s window of the li
brary. Continuing, he said with
a roaring laugh, "I'm just an old
bachelor who spent his life
reading. What the hell, I
oughta know something."
It's the end of his shift
Getting up, he gives his seat to
Fritz Brun. a Stanford
graduate drama student from
Denmark.
Brun was a professional ac
tor in his home country for 25
years before coming to Stan
ford. Dissatisfied with drama
in Denmark, Brun is deter
mined to stay in America after
his studies if he has some way
of supporting himself.
"You know the story of Rac
hel and Leah in the Blfile?" he
asks in his Danish accent.
"Jacob spent seven years
working for Rachel's father to
win her hand. At the end of
the seven years the father gave
him his other daughter, Leah,
instead. The man worked seven
more years. At the end of
those seven years the father fi

nally gave him Rachel. I've been
in America close to seven years
to become an American Ph.D.
I'll stay here another seven
years to gain a foothold, and
I'll not quit before then."
In Denmark, the interpreta
tion of all drama is one-sided:
Marxist, according to Brun. "If
they performed Hamlet in
Denmark, the grave-diggers
would be the heros."
Another reason for leaving
Denmark, Brun adds, is that
"it's a personal liberation to
get away from home. ... A lot
of American writers went to
Paris; I came here."
Recalling how he first
became interested in drama,
Brun said, "1 grew up during
World War II and naively
thought that art was the only
part of human endeavors that
could not be used for evil. God
seemed meaningless when there
was war and evil ... I was a
born outsider, seeing things
with a critical tendency."
Today, Brun seems to see no
clear distinction between
drama and life. To him, drama
is a way of actors and audience
"confirming a bit of life to
gether."
While playing the part of a
bum in Los Angeles recently,
Brun was mistaken for a real
bum. "1 think I was convincing
because I study bums. I study
bums because I'm interested.
Who knows? I might be a bum
myself one day."

Fritz Brun, actor and Drama Department graduate student, checks students' I.D.s on their way into Green Library.
A Europe-bound college stu
dent, an oral history en
thusiast, a former high school
teacher and a Danish actor.
Sound like four unrelated
people? They are diverse in all
ways except one. They all see,
and are seen by, many Stanford
students each day.
Who are they? One final
clue: "Thank you." Click.
"Thank you." Click.
Of course! They are identifi
cation and backpack checkers
at Green Library.
This job takes up four hours
of their time each day. With
the rest of their time, all of
the portal people pursue a vari
ety of diversions.
"I fish under the Golden
Gate Bridge, watch a lot of
movies, work on my truck,"
said Chris Farris, now in the
middle of his college career
"Every weekend I try to do
something, if it's just going to
San Francisco and eating all
day," Farris said.
Farris is interrupting his
studies to earn money for a
trip to Europe with his wife in
May.
"The trip will push back my
graduation date by six or seven
months, but it'll be worth it,"
Farris said.
Before entering college, Far
ris was a Marine. "I loved the
Marine Corps. I loved the
people. I loved my job ...
There's nothing like driving a
10-ton truck over sand
dunes."

Dressed in a sweat jacket,
jeans, and sneakers, the small
framed Farris shows no hint of
his earlier military role. Rather,
he looks and speaks like a typi
cal college student.
I've been reading a lot of
magazines and newspapers
lately, hut no hooks. I've been
in school for the past two or
three years. I don't want to

read books now," he said.
