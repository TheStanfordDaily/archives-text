## The 						Stanford Daily Mixing muffins and EDB 
### 
Procter & Gamble Co. declared a recall on
some of its Duncan Hines muffin mixes last
week, in response to the discovery that some ot
the mixes were contaminated by the pesticide
ethylene dibromide (EDB), one of the most
potent carcinogens in use today.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
barred the use of EDB in the wake of the furor
over the contamination.
Many grocery store chains in California pulled
the Duncan Hines mixes off of their shelves .i a
precautionary measure. A worker for Safeway
said the company removed the product from its
shelves so as not to "confuse and alarm custom
ers.'"
At The Store in Tresidder Union, however,
workers had a different attitude. "It is a fact
that 20,000 deaths per year are caused by ciga
rette smoking, but no one takes cigarettes off
the shelves," said Ben Esposito, store manager.
The Store's management remained adamant last
week that it wouldn't pull the mixes off the
shelves.

The Store's obstinancy is somewhat under
standable. Scientists do not agree on the
noxiousness of the pesticide. This week, scien
tists were alternately pooh-poohing the pes
ticide's harmfulness and decrying lax restrictions
on its use.
Dr. William Havender, a biochemist, deplored
what he called the "public hysteria" that has
developed over the mixes' contamination. "It's
an outrage," Havender said. "The whole thing is
a total disgrace, in the sense that the risk is so
small."
Other scientists maintain, however, that the
EPA's guidelines for dealing with EDB-con
taminated products should be 30 times as strin
gent.
Grocery stores in the area are taking
precautions, despite the disagreement over
harmfulness, because they are responsive to
their customers' concern over the contamina
tion. It is evident from the attitude of the
manager of The Store that the campus market
docs not share this concern for its patrons.
