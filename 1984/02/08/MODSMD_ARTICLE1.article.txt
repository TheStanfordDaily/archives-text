# Kaplan files libel suit over Newsweek article
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Daily staff 
Law School Prof. John Kaplan, teacher of
the popular undergraduate course "Criminal
Law and the Criminal System," has filed a $1
million libel suit against Newsweek magazine.
Kaplan is claiming that a flashy article
called "A Giggle of Guts" in the October
1983 issue of Newsweek On Campus, which
was distributed here and at other colleges,
printed false information with reckless dis
regard of the truth and with intent to injure
and disgrace Kaplan.
Kaplan's course was just one of 1 1 courses
the article mentioned as "micks," or easy
courses that "have one thing in common:
'being able to study about an hour for a test
and get a 98.' "
Kaplan charged, in a complaint mailed Mon
day to the U.S. District Court in San Jose,
that the article was false on 10 counts.
The article said, among other things, that
Kaplan's course is "recognized as the easiest
five credits a Stanford student can earn."
"It's not unusual to find students listening
to the lectures on portable radios while sun
ning themselves on the grassy slope above
DeGuerre Pool," Newsweek's article said. The
article said the only requirements in the
course are a take-home midterm and a
multiple-choice final and that a Stanford stu
dent named Eric Dawnson got an A on the
final after taking it out on the grass and
finishing in 50 minutes.
"Also taking the exam," the article says,
"were two students in top hats and three
piece suits, calmly checking off answers be
tween sips of champagne."
Other courses mentioned in Newsweek's
article included a class at Michigan State Uni
versity on billiards and a course at UC-
Berkeley on chocolate.
Kaplan sent a letter, dated Oct. 31, 1983, to
Newsweek demanding a correction and retrac
tion because, the letter states, Kaplan has
never given a take-home midterm in the class.
Ihe letter also said that it is unlikely

that students had listened to the course
while sunning themselves at DeGuerre be
cause radio broadcasts of the course took
place at night.
Claire McNulty, who recorded "Criminal
Law" last spring for KZSU, told The Daily
that the campus station never aired class
lectures during the day.
Kaplan's letter also says that "by no stand
ards" is it true that the course is the easiest
taught here and denies that the course is a
"mick." The letter also challenged Newsweek
editors to "study for an hour for a test and
get a 98" in the class.
Newsweek On Campus printed excerpts
from the letter and admitted, in an editor's
note, that the reference to the take-home
midterm in the course was an error. The maga
zine also said it "did not intend to suggest
that just because a course is popular and fairly
painless it is without worth or intellectual
merit."
The magazine made no other corrections
and did not print a retraction.
Newsweek On Campus then sent a letter to
Kaplan thanking him for his letter and telling
him that the magazine "found it so interest
ing that we have quoted you in our Letters
column. We're very grateful to you for your
contribution to Newsweek On Campus, and
we hope you enjoy this complimentary copy of
the issue in which your comments appear."
Kaplan says in the complaint that the arti
cle has exposed him to "contempt, ridicule and
obloquy and has . . . injured the plaintiff in
the estimation of his colleagues, students and
friends, and caused the plaintiff and his fam
ily embarrassment and humiliation. In addi
tion, it has made plaintiff very angry, indeed."
Kaplan also charges in the complaint that
Newsweek "had a duty" to retract other false
elements of the article. He claims Newsweek's
follow-up letter was mailed "with intent to
inflict emotional injury on plaintiff."
Kaplan said in an interview with The Daily
that he will attempt to prove during the trial
that Newsweek published the article with
