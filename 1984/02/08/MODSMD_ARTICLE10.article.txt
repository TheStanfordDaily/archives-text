## New Braun Center finally ready for campus music 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
The Braun Music Center is now open and after a
35-year wait the Music Department is happy to he lo
cated in a building built specifically for its needs.
Faculty and staff of the Music Department moved
into the almost completed center Jag. 2, though con
struction continued around them.
"When we moved, the building wasn't really ready
for us," said Julia Sommer, department publicity
director. "We were surrounded by workers and ce
ment trucks. It's only last week and this week that
it's livable."
Planning of the music center began with the
Robert Marquis and Associate architect firm in
February' 1980 and construction crews broke ground
in February 1982. "It took two years to design, two
years to build, and it's not finished yet," said Som
mers.
Music Department Chairman Albert Cohen said,
"People seem to be extremely positive, joyous and

happy to be in the new facility." Sommer added that
"It's such a change from the Knoll you can't believe
it."
Music classes have been held in Braun all winter
quarter and according to Cohen, "entry level classes
seem quite a bit larger. It's much easier for students
to come to us. People didn't have time to come up to
the Knoll between their other classes."
According to Sommer the Music Department has
been waiting for a suitable building since the depart
ment's creation in 1947. "It got almost to the point
that if the Music Department was to continue it had
to have a new building or burst."
The $10.2 million complex consists of classrooms,
the music library, staff and faculty offices, teaching
studios, practice modules, and two recital halls.
Two parts of the center are still under construc
tion. The orchestra rehearsal hall is scheduled to open
next month and the recital hall will be finished this
summer. Originally, the center was to open this
fall but due to the heavy rains last winter and other

difficulties completion was delayed, Cohen said.
"I think there will be growth in the Music Depart
ment," said Cohen, "and over the next few years we'll
monitor all this very closely. We do not want to react
too quickly to a burst of large numbers at the begin
ning."
The funding for the center has come primarily from
private donors. "We're very close to completing fund
ing," said Cohen, "We only have $700,000 left to
raise." The largest donor was the Carl F. Braun Foun
dation. The James Irvine Foundation and the William
and Flora Hewlett Foundation were also major con
tributors. Funds for the Campbell Recital Hall were
raised separately and were given primarily from the
estate of Samuel and lleen Campbell.
A formal opening ceremony is scheduled for May.
According to Cohen the official opening was
postponed because of the health problems of prin
cipal, donor John Braun. "He and his family should he
there," Cohen said, "so we postponed the opening
ceremony until he can come."



The new Braun Music Center features a ride-through
pathway (left) which runs beneath glass-walled hallways. The
pathway will allow bicyclists and pedestrians to travel
directly from Mayfield Avenue to White Plaza. Traditional
Stanford architectural styles are preserved with bright glass
arches (above), and red-tiled columns (right).
