## The
						Stanford Daily Secrecy is destabilizing 
### 
Ihe U.S. Department of Energy officially
conducted 14 underground nuclear explosions in
1983. Officially conducted. Unofficially it con
ducted. in addition, an indeterminate number of
smaller, relatively undectable explosions.
It may be said that nuclear weapons tests are
very much in the domain of sensitive informa
tion. Perhaps. Yet we feel that this piece of
government secrecy is both unnecessary and det
[ rimental.
Since 1963, as a result of the Partial Test Ban
I reaty that prohibited atmospheric nuclear
tests, underground testing has been used exclu
sively in our nuclear weapons program. During
the early years of the treaty, the United States
only announced those tests it felt would be
easily detected by the Soviet Union, hoping
that the smaller explosions would go unnoticed.
I hen, in the 19705, perhaps as an expression of
detente, our government announced all under
ground tests.
Department ot Energy officials revealed last
week that the policy had reverted to the earlier
one with Reagan's presidency in 1981. A De
partment ot Defense official confirmed

suspicions that the purpose of the "new" policy
was to complicate Soviet intelligence-gathering
efforts regarding our nuclear program.
This is clearly a step in the wrong direction.
Deterrence theory rests on the premise of nei
ther side developing the ability of launching an
unanswerable first strike. One requirement of
deterrence, then, is adequate intelligence: We
must know what they're up to, and they have to
know what we're up to. Secret weapons testing
decreases confidence in intelligence gathering,
destabilizes the nuclear balance and increases
the chance of holocaust.
Secrecy in weapons tests, as in so many areas
since Reagan took office, is dangerous for an
other reason. The liberal-democratic conception
of participatory government rests on the as
sumption of an informed citizenry. If the num
ber and nature of weapons tests are kept secret,
an educated decision regarding the costs and
benefits of more nuclear arms is rendered
impossible.
Perhaps that is the intention. In either case,
we feel the secret tests are wrong. We, as
citizens, have a right, if not a dutv, to know.
