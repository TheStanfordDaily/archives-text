## Aerobics article unfair 
### 
In response to The Daily's
expose" of aerobic programs (Daily,
Feb. 1), we. of Stanford Aerobics,
wopld like to assure the Stanford
corpmunity that our goal is to pro
vide a valuable service and not to
"c;Â»sh in on this student interest by
taking advantage of free Stanford
facilities."
In order to use University
rimes, groups must register with
thefOffice of Student Activities
met deposit all funds with the
ASSU. All financial operations are
thus monitored by the financial
manager, and records are available to
the; Stanford community. Once
. nt organizations arc
anyone with energy and ideas can be
an entrepreneur.
Stanford Aerobics has proven
successful; however, our success is in
program quality. We have doubled
our stall, and now provide more
than lb classes per week. This allows
is to limit class size and offer more
personalized instruction. Any excess
revenue is reinvested in the program
to benefit our patrons. For example,
we provide a bimonthly newsletter
which explores some of the myths
and questions about aerobic exercise.
In addition to offering a rigorous
workout, we are committed to
ilucating ourselves and our patrons
in body efficiency and injury preven
tion.
We encourage The Daily and the
Stanford community to take a
closer, more accurate look at our
financial position. But more impor
tantly. we hope that the benefits of
our program and the service we
provide are not similarly overlooked
in the process.
