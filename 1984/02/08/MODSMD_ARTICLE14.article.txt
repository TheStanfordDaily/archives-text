# Stanford police: working for the clampdown
## 
### 
Young Billy is attending a Community Awareness class at his
kindergarten. The children are watching a film designed to make
them good citizens by teaching them to respect and obey the auth
orities, without instilling fear. That comes later.
Up on the screen, a policeman is helping two toddlers cross the
street. The policeman, young and trim, is resplendent in his uni
form. The image shifts to a cartoon image of an officer, smiling
benignly down upon his young audience with the serene beatitude
of an American Buddha. As he begins to recite safety rules, Billy
starts going into hysterics.
The film has not had the right effect on Billy, but there kw no
flaw in the presentation. The day before, the police had taken away
Billy's father for a too-vigorous protest of French involvement in
Indochina. Billy's dad had attempted to burn a French flag at high
noon in front of City Hall, and he had brought Billy there to watch
and start becoming his dad's idea of a "good citizen." The police
who took Billy's father were a trifle rough (which accounts for
Billy's reaction) because before trying to burn the flag, dad had
wrapped it around the town's mayor.

Stanford, ever in the forefront, arrived in 1984 earlier than
the rest of the world. We didn't notice it, of course, being as
tSffipd as people are to the inexorable destruction of liberties and
freedoms. First it was the painted bike lanes. "Ha," we
lAighed". u What a ridiculous idea! Not only are they dangerous,
but nobody is going to pay attention to them anyway!"
So we thought. Sure, they may have been hazardous, cramping
dozens of obsessed bikers into tiny lanes, and the idea of en
forcing them on such a notoriously contemptuous group as the Stan
lord student body may have seemed a pipe dream, but once
they started handing out the tickets like so much anti-
Khomeini literature everyone soon fell into place.
Next comes the new cops. Normally seen waiting, engines run
ning, around the side of Dink Aud. these new motorcycle police
are the most frightening thing on the Stanford campus since
that alien spaceship crash-landed out by the Law School.
Not only are the motorcycles ugly-looking things that look
ready to chase malefactors up the sides of buildings if need be,
but the cops look ready to land at Normandy at a moment's
notice. Helmeted, jacketed, with sturdy boots and tough
gauntlets, these peace officers are, frankly, frightening. I can
imagine some group of foreign tourists coming on campus after
seeing Star Wars and then running into these cops. Result:
Pierre, Li-Pan and Takihichi go to Berkeley.
Finally, on top of everything else, comes The Crack-Down.
• • •
Billy, older now, has a more acceptable picture of his society. His
father, calmed by the sedatives, has bought him a puppy. Billy, ever
eager to live out fantasies, has put it in a tree, and called the fire de
partment, the police and the merchant marine. (The lad added the
last on his own. A bright boy.)
The police arrive first, and are not pleased by what they see.
Spot, having been only three feet off the ground, has jumped down,
and Billy has nothing to offer the police. When the fire trucks
arrive, the police recognize Billy's dad as "that nut from City
Hall" and take him in for questioning.

"At least," Billy's dad will say much later, "the merchant marine
never showed up."
• • •
It is a tragic event in everyone's life when he gets his first
driving license, as it is the ultimate end of innocence. Before
then, the sight of a police car would be reassuring. "If anything
happens we'll be okay. There are cops around here." If you get
lost, they'll tell you the way home. If you get mugged, they'll
arrest the criminal. If you hurt yourself, they'll get you to a
hospital.
Once you get a driver's license, everything changes. If you get
lost, they'll stop you and ask you what you're doing there. If
you act oddly, they'll arrest you. If you try to get away, they'll
hurt you.
Going through the rite of passage, usually in high school,
makes the world a fearsome place. The world is no longer a place

where there's someone on your side, hut now a place where you
try to figure out what you've done and what would be the best
way to beg your way out of punishment.
There had been a way around all that, however. Go to a col
lege, pay $13,000 a year to support campus cops, friendly folks
whose raison d'etre is to watch out for you, make sure you get
to class on time reasonably safely and help you out with a ride
home it you've overindulged. The cops here, you say, are trying
to help me.
At least until The Crack-Down.
Suddenly, Res Ed goes on a confiscation spree, grabbing
everything within reach of its buildings. Suddenly, motorcycle
cops from the War Planet Zygon infest White Plaza. Suddenly,
everything you do becomes cause not for a talking to, not for a
warning, but an honest-to-God-mail-in-this-money-or-we'll
have-a-warrant-out-on-you Mister Butchko ticket. What is
going on?
Has 1984 arrived? Of course it has; but did it have to arrive
here?

Billy, attending a prestigious western university, is driving a
friend's car when he rolls through a meaningless stop sign in a

deserted part of campus. Nonetheless, he has been caught. Sirens
wail and a police officer parachutes from the cop helicopter circling
overhead. Brandishing a machine gun, the peace officer walks for
ward, and Billy can glimpse glints of sunlight off the rifle barrels of
hidden police snipers. He notices, as well, that iron claws have risen
out of the surface of the road and are firmly gripping his tires.
"Well," says the cop, absently tapping the stock of his gun
against his armor, "do you have a driver's license I could see?"
• • •
Some speak in a hushed voice about quotas. Don't go out
riding near the end of the month, they advise, that's when the
cops are really pushing to make their quotas. Come now! That
cannot be. Why would police officers, of all things, have
quotas? They aren't salesmen — it would hardly be their duty
to go out and stir up crime. It would be hard to imagine some
sergeant saying to his cadre, "Let's go out there and make them
want to violate the law! Keep yourselves well hidden, lads, and
let's make this the best month for citations there's ever been!"
Even granting that there are quotas, or that the quotas have
been raised (saints preserve us!), one still has to wonder why our
little oasis of lawlessness has been taken away. Who profits
from all these nasty pieces of yellow paper flying around? The
money doesn't come back on campus. 1 believe, as all the paper
work takes place elsewhere Why then such zeal?
Could there be some sort of kickback, a commission on tick
ets that flows directly into the University endowment?
Unlikely. Are the cops merely in a toul mood, perhaps angry at
career-oriented college students who will someday make more
money than campus police? No. many of the ticketed students
are liberal arts majors, who, as we all know, will never make
more money than anybody. Coircl this be some form of residen
tial education. like dorm sherry hours or films in the dining hall,
designed to bring the reality of living in a police state — such as
Argentina. Turkey or New Jersey — home to the student body?
That too is impossible, as long experience with residential edu
cation programs has taught me that no one ever goes to them.
Obviously then, these people handing out tickets are frauds
or vigilantes, harassing the student body and making obscene
profits through the device of forged traffic citations. The real
campus police are earnestly working to keep Theodore (Oh my
God I've said his name, I hope I'm not next) Streleski off
campus. Something has to be done about these false police, and
the sooner the better.
• • •
Billy is putting his license back in his wallet. He is discouraged,
as being meekly obedient, contrite, palsy-walsy this-is-just
between-us-two and indignant have all in their turn failed to
prevent his getting a ticket. As he stuffs his wallet into his jacket
pocket the policeman tears off his ticket and hands it to Billy.
"You'll be getting something in the mail about this," the cop
says. "Probably in two weeks . . . Oh, and here - I think you
should have this." He hands something to Billy, then walks away
into the sunset.
It is a silver bullet.

Some speak in a hushed voice about quotas. Don't go out
riding near the end of the month, they advise, that's when the
cops are really pushing to make their quotas. Come now! That
cannot be. Why would police officers, of all things, have
quotas? They aren't salesmen — it would hardly be their duty
to go out and stir up crime. It would be hard to imagine some
sergeant saying to his cadre, "Let's go out there and make them
want to violate the law! Keep yourselves well hidden, lads, and
let's make this the best month for citations there's ever been!"
Even granting that there are quotas, or that the quotas have
been raised (saints preserve us!), one still has to wonder why our
little oasis of lawlessness has been taken away. Who profits
from all these nasty pieces of yellow paper flying around? The
money doesn't come back on campus. 1 believe, as all the paper
work takes place elsewhere Why then such zeal?
Could there be some sort of kickback, a commission on tick
ets that flows directly into the University endowment?
Unlikely. Are the cops merely in a toul mood, perhaps angry at
career-oriented college students who will someday make more
money than campus police? No. many of the ticketed students
are liberal arts majors, who, as we all know, will never make
more money than anybody. Coircl this be some form of residen
tial education. like dorm sherry hours or films in the dining hall,
designed to bring the reality of living in a police state — such as
Argentina. Turkey or New Jersey — home to the student body?
That too is impossible, as long experience with residential edu
cation programs has taught me that no one ever goes to them.
Obviously then, these people handing out tickets are frauds
or vigilantes, harassing the student body and making obscene
profits through the device of forged traffic citations. The real
campus police are earnestly working to keep Theodore (Oh my
God I've said his name, I hope I'm not next) Streleski off
campus. Something has to be done about these false police, and
the sooner the better.

Young Billy is attending a Community Awareness class at his
kindergarten. The children are watching a film designed to make
them good citizens by teaching them to respect and obey the auth
orities, without instilling fear. That comes later.
Up on the screen, a policeman is helping two toddlers cross the
street. The policeman, young and trim, is resplendent in his uni
form. The image shifts to a cartoon image of an officer, smiling
benignly down upon his young audience with the serene beatitude
of an American Buddha. As he begins to recite safety rules, Billy
starts going into hysterics.
The film has not had the right effect on Billy, but there kw no
flaw in the presentation. The day before, the police had taken away
Billy's father for a too-vigorous protest of French involvement in
Indochina. Billy's dad had attempted to burn a French flag at high
noon in front of City Hall, and he had brought Billy there to watch
and start becoming his dad's idea of a "good citizen." The police
who took Billy's father were a trifle rough (which accounts for
Billy's reaction) because before trying to burn the flag, dad had
wrapped it around the town's mayor.
• • •
Stanford, ever in the forefront, arrived in 1984 earlier than
the rest of the world. We didn't notice it, of course, being as
tSffipd as people are to the inexorable destruction of liberties and
freedoms. First it was the painted bike lanes. "Ha," we
lAighed". u What a ridiculous idea! Not only are they dangerous,
but nobody is going to pay attention to them anyway!"
So we thought. Sure, they may have been hazardous, cramping
dozens of obsessed bikers into tiny lanes, and the idea of en
forcing them on such a notoriously contemptuous group as the Stan
lord student body may have seemed a pipe dream, but once
they started handing out the tickets like so much anti-
Khomeini literature everyone soon fell into place.
Next comes the new cops. Normally seen waiting, engines run
ning, around the side of Dink Aud. these new motorcycle police
are the most frightening thing on the Stanford campus since
that alien spaceship crash-landed out by the Law School.
Not only are the motorcycles ugly-looking things that look
ready to chase malefactors up the sides of buildings if need be,
but the cops look ready to land at Normandy at a moment's
notice. Helmeted, jacketed, with sturdy boots and tough
gauntlets, these peace officers are, frankly, frightening. I can
imagine some group of foreign tourists coming on campus after
seeing Star Wars and then running into these cops. Result:
Pierre, Li-Pan and Takihichi go to Berkeley.
Finally, on top of everything else, comes The Crack-Down.
• • •
Billy, older now, has a more acceptable picture of his society. His
father, calmed by the sedatives, has bought him a puppy. Billy, ever
eager to live out fantasies, has put it in a tree, and called the fire de
partment, the police and the merchant marine. (The lad added the
last on his own. A bright boy.)
The police arrive first, and are not pleased by what they see.
Spot, having been only three feet off the ground, has jumped down,
and Billy has nothing to offer the police. When the fire trucks
arrive, the police recognize Billy's dad as "that nut from City
Hall" and take him in for questioning.

"At least," Billy's dad will say much later, "the merchant marine
never showed up."

It is a tragic event in everyone's life when he gets his first
driving license, as it is the ultimate end of innocence. Before
then, the sight of a police car would be reassuring. "If anything
happens we'll be okay. There are cops around here." If you get
lost, they'll tell you the way home. If you get mugged, they'll
arrest the criminal. If you hurt yourself, they'll get you to a
hospital.
Once you get a driver's license, everything changes. If you get
lost, they'll stop you and ask you what you're doing there. If
you act oddly, they'll arrest you. If you try to get away, they'll
hurt you.
Going through the rite of passage, usually in high school,
makes the world a fearsome place. The world is no longer a place

where there's someone on your side, hut now a place where you
try to figure out what you've done and what would be the best
way to beg your way out of punishment.
There had been a way around all that, however. Go to a col
lege, pay $13,000 a year to support campus cops, friendly folks
whose raison d'etre is to watch out for you, make sure you get
to class on time reasonably safely and help you out with a ride
home it you've overindulged. The cops here, you say, are trying
to help me.
At least until The Crack-Down.
Suddenly, Res Ed goes on a confiscation spree, grabbing
everything within reach of its buildings. Suddenly, motorcycle
cops from the War Planet Zygon infest White Plaza. Suddenly,
everything you do becomes cause not for a talking to, not for a
warning, but an honest-to-God-mail-in-this-money-or-we'll
have-a-warrant-out-on-you Mister Butchko ticket. What is
going on?
Has 1984 arrived? Of course it has; but did it have to arrive

Billy, attending a prestigious western university, is driving a
friend's car when he rolls through a meaningless stop sign in a

deserted part of campus. Nonetheless, he has been caught. Sirens
wail and a police officer parachutes from the cop helicopter circling
overhead. Brandishing a machine gun, the peace officer walks for
ward, and Billy can glimpse glints of sunlight off the rifle barrels of
hidden police snipers. He notices, as well, that iron claws have risen
out of the surface of the road and are firmly gripping his tires.
"Well," says the cop, absently tapping the stock of his gun
against his armor, "do you have a driver's license I could see?"
