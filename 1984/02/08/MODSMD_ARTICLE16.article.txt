## A 						little consideration isn't too much to ask for

"You know what really bugs me, Ralph?"
"No, but I think I'm about to find out."
"Its seeing lom Lantos' face paving the
ground around the post office."
"Yeah, I hate that too. The guy's such a
dweeb."
"Its not that. It's the thoughtlessness in
volved in littering that gets me. Every time
Lantos or Zschau sends us those admittedly silly

VIEWPOINT

little 'Washington Reports," they end up an inch
thick on the pavement. People just don't seem to
mind polluting their own environment, not to
mention mine, or giving someone else a lot of un
necessary work. What do you think?"
"I think you're anal-retentive."
"You always were a supportive fellow. But lis
ten to me. You don't see me going around tossing
my undesired mail into somebody's dorm room,
do you? Just like I don't throw cigarette hutts
into people's cars. Whatever happened to using
trash cans and ashtrays?"
"Oh yeah . . . trash cans and ashtrays! Where
has my head heen lately?"
"Please. Mayhe you don't appreciate the
gravity of those examples, hut I'll het you can re
member the frustration of having a critical bike
ramp blocked by some inconsiderate motorist, or
the aggravation you felt upon discovering a
couple ol pre-meds discussing their research op
portunities right in the middle of ihe narrow
breezeway in which your P.O. box is strategically
located. I'm sure you're equally annoyed by the
guy who reads his six-page letter right in front
of his P.O. box — which is directly above yours —
during the 10:50 a.m. rush. And just think if you

were in a wheelchair. How many times do you go
to Green and see the wheelchair access inacces
sible?"
'i don't go to Green, I don't ride a wheelchair
and my box isn't in a breezeway. I really don't un
derstand what is so upsetting."
"My good man, consideration and thoughtful
ness were once consistently practiced virtues.
The absence of these, unlike the demise of other
traditional values, like temperance and chastity,
provides us no benefits, no happiness and no
means of differentiating us from New Yorkers.
Just today I was with someone who evidently
confused the elevator we were in with a giant
recycling bin and dropped his Pepsi can on the
floor. I said to him, 'Hey listen, pal, you think
this is your personal dumpster here? How do you
derive any sense of self-worth from dropping
your Pepsi can on the floor?' "
"Did you really say that?"
"Well, no. 1 wanted to, but he probably
would've hit me. Anyway, something else hit me:
He wasn't really the one at fault. It was the
Stanford mindset, the California mentality, the
American consciousness. It was . . . society!
Yes, that dreaded curse had defiled yet another
aspect of our existence. You see, no one really
'wants' to be thoughtless and rude; they just
don't realize that they are."
"Did you say something?"
"Why aren't you listening? I just revealed the
focus of evil in the modern world."
"Somebody's already done that."
"This is serious. I think we're dealing with a
civilization that has lost touch with the ideals
that helped it grow. The drive to succeed at all
costs, the tendency toward uninvolvement, the
emphasis placed on rugged individualism, and the

inability to sec past your own nose to notice that
three bicyclists just collided because you blindly
strolled into the bike path. We place a greater
value on success, achievement and competition
than such mundane practices as thoughtfulness,
consideration, and common courtesy.
"In many situations, in fact, the only way to
uphold these modern-day values is to ignore the
more traditional ones. Furthermore, many of our
institutions are responsible for propagating
these values. The educational system prizes indi
viduals who have climbed to the top of their
class, even il they used their classmates as step
ping stones. Corporations motivate the aspiring
individual to concentrate on nothing more than
selling products and increasing profits. Even na
tions are forever in a state of tension because of
a game best characterized as one-upmanship."
"Would you mind not getting philosophical
when I'm on an empty stomach?"
"Sorry. I'll give you an example of what I'm
talking about that's closer to home. There's a
certain phenomenon that every student here ex
periences quite frequently. I once heard it
referred to as 'I he Pack. Whenever a lecture
starts to run past its allotted time, you begin to
hear backpack zippers opening and closing, fol
ding desks slamming down, and feet shuffling
past other feet. What kind ot values do you
think such behavior reflects?"
"Yeah, its really too bad. Someone ought to
do something about that. Listen, I gotta run.
Got some reserve reading to do. It's been real
good talking to you. II you ever want to run some
more ideas up the flagpole, I'd be glad to discuss
them with you. See you later."
"... bye, Ralph."

my undesired mail into somebody's dorm room,
do you? Just like I don't throw cigarette hutts
into people's cars. Whatever happened to using
trash cans and ashtrays?"
"Oh yeah . . . trash cans and ashtrays! Where
has my head heen lately?"
"Please. Mayhe you don't appreciate the
gravity of those examples, hut I'll het you can re
member the frustration of having a critical bike
ramp blocked by some inconsiderate motorist, or
the aggravation you felt upon discovering a
couple ol pre-meds discussing their research op
portunities right in the middle of ihe narrow
breezeway in which your P.O. box is strategically
located. I'm sure you're equally annoyed by the
guy who reads his six-page letter right in front
of his P.O. box — which is directly above yours —
during the 10:50 a.m. rush. And just think if you

were in a wheelchair. How many times do you go
to Green and see the wheelchair access inacces
sible?"
'i don't go to Green, I don't ride a wheelchair
and my box isn't in a breezeway. I really don't un
derstand what is so upsetting."
"My good man, consideration and thoughtful
ness were once consistently practiced virtues.
The absence of these, unlike the demise of other
traditional values, like temperance and chastity,
provides us no benefits, no happiness and no
means of differentiating us from New Yorkers.
Just today I was with someone who evidently
confused the elevator we were in with a giant
recycling bin and dropped his Pepsi can on the
floor. I said to him, 'Hey listen, pal, you think
this is your personal dumpster here? How do you
derive any sense of self-worth from dropping
your Pepsi can on the floor?' "
"Did you really say that?"
"Well, no. 1 wanted to, but he probably
would've hit me. Anyway, something else hit me:
He wasn't really the one at fault. It was the
Stanford mindset, the California mentality, the
American consciousness. It was . . . society!
Yes, that dreaded curse had defiled yet another
aspect of our existence. You see, no one really
'wants' to be thoughtless and rude; they just
don't realize that they are."
"Did you say something?"
"Why aren't you listening? I just revealed the
focus of evil in the modern world."
"Somebody's already done that."
"This is serious. I think we're dealing with a
civilization that has lost touch with the ideals
that helped it grow. The drive to succeed at all
costs, the tendency toward uninvolvement, the
emphasis placed on rugged individualism, and the

inability to sec past your own nose to notice that
three bicyclists just collided because you blindly
strolled into the bike path. We place a greater
value on success, achievement and competition
than such mundane practices as thoughtfulness,
consideration, and common courtesy.
"In many situations, in fact, the only way to
uphold these modern-day values is to ignore the
more traditional ones. Furthermore, many of our
institutions are responsible for propagating
these values. The educational system prizes indi
viduals who have climbed to the top of their
class, even il they used their classmates as step
ping stones. Corporations motivate the aspiring
individual to concentrate on nothing more than
selling products and increasing profits. Even na
tions are forever in a state of tension because of
a game best characterized as one-upmanship."
"Would you mind not getting philosophical
when I'm on an empty stomach?"
"Sorry. I'll give you an example of what I'm
talking about that's closer to home. There's a
certain phenomenon that every student here ex
periences quite frequently. I once heard it
referred to as 'I he Pack. Whenever a lecture
starts to run past its allotted time, you begin to
hear backpack zippers opening and closing, fol
ding desks slamming down, and feet shuffling
past other feet. What kind ot values do you
think such behavior reflects?"
"Yeah, its really too bad. Someone ought to
do something about that. Listen, I gotta run.
Got some reserve reading to do. It's been real
good talking to you. II you ever want to run some
more ideas up the flagpole, I'd be glad to discuss
them with you. See you later."
"... bye, Ralph."
