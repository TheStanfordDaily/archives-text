# Hoover 'liberal' enjoys research
## 
### NANETTE ARCHER 
At some time, everyone has experienced
the feeling of standing out in a crowd. For
Joseph Pechman, a visiting scholar at the
Hoover Institution, that time is now — as
he is one of the few liberals on the Hoover
staff.
As an economic expert on tax policy,
Pechman served for the last 21 years as the
director of economic studies at the Brook
ings Institution in Washington, D.C., and
is here for one year to conduct research
related to income distribution in the
United States.
Because his work is mainly computer
oriented, the facilities available at
Hoover, he said, are extememely helpful.
But Pechman notes that his liberal views
are often in disagreement with those put
forth by the majority of Hoover's body.
However, Pechman stresses that Hoover
is "a place for research," and feels that
"colleagues have been quite congenial,
even if we disagree." He claims he hasn't
experienced any uneasiness within the in
stitution, and has, in fact, enjoyed various
exchanges with others of differing
opinions.
"One ought to be tolerant of conflict
ing viewpoints," he said.
Pechman feels that his ideas have been

met with open-mindedness — if not com
plete endorsement — and has found that
"people are generally willing to talk dispas
sionately." He said he has had no trouble
discussing his concepts and said he has
found quite a few who hold similar
opinions.
When asked if he has been influenced by
those around him, he replied, "One doesn't
become a conservative overnight," but he
does admit to being interested in the work
of other renowned economists.
Pechman refrains from considering him
self a "token" liberal, and said that
Hoover has extended an increasing number
of invitations to liberal scholars in recent
years.
Though he concedes it is difficult to be
completely sure of Hoover's ultimate mo
tivation in inviting him, he says, regardless
of the circumstances, that he's "extremely
pleased to be here."
Approached on the topic of whether or
not he perceives the Hoover Institution as
a bipartisan organization, he replied, "I
honestly don't know; among economists —
definitely," but, he said, due to lack of in
teraction, "I can't judge the staff in other
areas."
Tom Moore, head of Domestic Studies
at Hoover, expressed a somewhat similar

opinion, saying that he doesn't view Pech
man's liberal attitude as exceptional.
"We've always had among our visitors a
tnixture of ideologies," Moore said, "at
least, that's been the case for the past
nine years that I've been here."
In response to questions regarding his
feeling toward President Reagan's tax
plans, Pechman states only, "He (Reagan)
has no plans." Pechman believes it is essen
tial for the United States to do something
immediately to decrease the national
debt, which he describes as "irresponsible."
His own views on taxation', which appear
in his book, "Federal Tax Policy," deal
mainly with reform suggestions for exist
ing tax laws. He feels that taxes should be
increased, but not through the establish
ment of higher rates.
Instead, he believes the tax base should
be broadened and rates actually decreased
slightly, thus providing additional revenue
and reducing the number of "those getting
away with murder." Distribution would
remain essentially the same, but the
amount of overall available deductions
would go down.
Although he questions whether this sys
tem would be acceptable to the public in
general, Pechman stresses that
"concessions must be made" in order for
the nation to reduce its deficit.
