# New computer encoding means increased security

### DOUG HOHBACH 
If you've been worried about
someone walking off with your
computer, or at least with the
information inside, you will
soon be able to rest easy.
Within 10 years, you and
every other computer-wielding
adult may be the proud owner
of two secret, 100-digit num
bers with which you may send
confidential electronic
messages while keeping your
own files top-secret.
Encryption, or the protect
ing of sensitive files and oper
ating systems of a computer, is
now being done by the govern
ment and some companies with
conventional cryptography.
But "public key cryptography,"
as explained by inventor and
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Martin Hellman has some im
portant advantages over the
conventional systems.
Hellman's method of public
key cryptosystem is based on
the difficulty of factoring a
publically known, 200-digit
number which is the product of
two, secret 100-digit numbers.
It would take the most pow
erful modern computer ap
proximately one billion years to
complete this task, making
decoding a very unlikely possi
bility.
As Hellman explains, com
puter security today is in a
state similar to automobile se
curity at the turn of the cen
tury. It was assumed then that
since so few people knew how

to operate automobiles, keys
were unnecessary.
As the number of car owners
increased, the need for security
grew. Now that computers are
becoming household items,
owners are also finding a need
for greater protection, as
evidenced by the recent rash of
computer thefts and pranks,
Hellman said.
The uniqueness of this new
system lies in the twofold na
ture of the numerical key. A
message is encrypted using the
public, or unclassified, 200-
digit number and may then be
sent to this number's owner.
Using the two 100-digit

numbers, the owner can then
decipher the message if the
product of the coded numbers
is the 200-digit number.
This factoring method,
derived by a Stanford Ph.D.
recipient and Massachusetts
Insititute of Technology Prof.
Ron Rivest, may be applied
more extensively in the future.
Although the ideas behind
public key cryptography are
now more than five years old,
the concept is still virtually un
utilized. But Hellman and most
others in the field believe it is
only a short time until use of
the system sees widespread ap
plication.
