ology 109: The Criminal Law and the
Criminal System. Prof. John Kaplan.
Stanford
Criminal Law is recognized as the easi
est five credits a Stanford student can
earn. Attendance: unnecessary. Lectures
are broadcast over campus radio station
KZSU, and it's not unusual I o find students
listening to the Icctures on poriablc radios
while sunning themselves on the grassy
slope above DeGuerre Pool. Requirements:
few. To be exact, a take-home midterm and
a multiple-choice final. Grading: "scientif
ic/' in Kaplan's words. He finds out the
exact percentage of A's, B's and C's being
given out all over the university and fits his
students' scores to that curve. Junior Eric
Dawnson got an A on the final a couple of
years back after taking it out on the grass
and finishing in 50 minutes. Also taking the
exam were two students in top hats and
three-piece suits, calmly checking off an
swers between sips of champagne.
Law Prof. John Kaplan claims this
Newsweek On Campus article libeled him.
reckless disregard of the truth and with
malice, knowing that the information was
false. Kaplan is asking for compensatory da
mages of $500,000 and punitive and exemp
lary damages of $500,000.
Kaplan said he will prosecute the case
himself. He said he is waiting for a response
from the magazine and said he expects that
Newsweek ,will not settle the case out of
court.
Kaplan also suggested in an interview with
The Daily that the magazine libeled the pro
fessors of some of the other courses men
tioned in the article. He claimed that
Newsweek On Campus was not concerned
with accuracy in describing the courses because
the professors could not afford to defend
themselves.
