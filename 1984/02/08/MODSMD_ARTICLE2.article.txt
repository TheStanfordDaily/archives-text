ology 109: The Criminal Law and the
Criminal System. Prof. John Kaplan.
Stanford
Criminal Law is recognized as the easi
est five credits a Stanford student can
earn. Attendance: unnecessary. Lectures
are broadcast over campus radio station
KZSU, and it's not unusual I o find students
listening to the Icctures on poriablc radios
while sunning themselves on the grassy
slope above DeGuerre Pool. Requirements:
few. To be exact, a take-home midterm and
a multiple-choice final. Grading: "scientif
ic/' in Kaplan's words. He finds out the
exact percentage of A's, B's and C's being
given out all over the university and fits his
students' scores to that curve. Junior Eric
Dawnson got an A on the final a couple of
years back after taking it out on the grass
and finishing in 50 minutes. Also taking the
exam were two students in top hats and
three-piece suits, calmly checking off an
swers between sips of champagne.

reckless disregard of the truth and with
malice, knowing that the information was
false. Kaplan is asking for compensatory da
mages of $500,000 and punitive and exemp
lary damages of $500,000.
Kaplan said he will prosecute the case
himself. He said he is waiting for a response
from the magazine and said he expects that
Newsweek ,will not settle the case out of
court.
Kaplan also suggested in an interview with
The Daily that the magazine libeled the pro
fessors of some of the other courses men
tioned in the article. He claimed that
Newsweek On Campus was not concerned
with accuracy in describing the courses because
the professors could not afford to defend
themselves.
"They didn't know who they were
dealing with here," Kaplan said.
Jerrold Footlick, the managing
editor of Newsweek On Campus, said
when contacted yesterday by The
Daily that Newsweek was unaware of
the suit. He refused to make further
comments on the case.
Trey Ellis, a senior majoring in En
glish and a campus stringer for
Newsweek, said in October that the
magazine asked him for a list of five

or six classes that are well-known for
being easy A's.
"Everyone's got a favorite mick,"
Ellis said. "I gave them four from
about 20 friends that I talked to.
It's just for fun."
Ellis has stopped out and could not
be reached for comment.
Last spring's issue of the ASSU
Course Guide said "Criminal Law and
the Criminal System'' received "high
marks" from the students who
responded to the survey. Students
surveyed suggested, however, that
Kaplan replace the multiple-choice
midterm and final with another
grading system.
