## Santa Clara puts an end to Cardinal winning streak 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
I Santa Clara — Take away the
irst 12 minutes of Stanford's
ame with Santa Clara last
light and the Cardinal won,
i3-51. Put them back in and
Itanford lost, 73-69.
Although it ended as a four
oint game, it wasn't that
lose. In fact, minus a furious
Lit futile Stanford rally in the
losing seconds, it was the most
pnvincing defeat the Cardinal
lis suffered all season.
|The non-conference loss
topped Stanford to 15-8
lerall and forces it to beat
|( -Berkeley Friday night if it
Ipes to get its 16th win, one
Lit will clinch Stanford's Inst
■ mimg season in 11 years.
■T he Broncos, playing before
■Vocal sellout crowd of 5000 in
wso Pavilion, leaped to early
lea>ls of 10-2, 18-4 and 22-6 in
the first 11:58 of the contest
anil then cruised the rest of
the way to their 17th win
against six losses.
■'1 don't think we came
prepared and ready to play,"
center John Revelli said after
the game in a Stanford locker
room filled with dejection.
"Thoy just jumped on top of us
early and we were struggling
the rest of the way."
' And every time Stanford
tried to come back, it fell back
three steps for every two it
took.
The Card was not able to
sha\e the Broncos' lead to
single digits in the first half.
After scoring the first basket
of the second half, Stanford
cut the lead to nine at 34-25,
but Santa Clara scored 10 of
the next 12 points to take a
commanding 44-27 lead.
Stanford narrowed it to nine
again with 2:53 remaining, but
Bronco players hit all five ot
their free throws in the next
1:13 to preserve the victory.
Stanford made one last run
in the final 34 seconds, but all
the Card's eight straight
points did was turn a 12-point
loss into a four-point one. For
ward Earl Koberlein made a
lay-in, followed by a John Paye
steal and lay-in. After a Bronco
turnover, Paye hit a 16-foot
jumper and then added a lay-in
at the buzzer.
I Card Coach Tom Davis of
fered no excuses for his team's
k poor showing. "There is no
»M.|iiestion we weren't on top of

our game," he said.
One player who was literally
on top of his game (and every
one else's for that matter) was
Bronco center Nick Vanos,
listed as 7-foot-1 but at least
7-2 according to Davis. Vanos
scored a team-high 18 points,
pulled down 1 1 rebounds,
blocked six shots and forced
Card players to alter a dozen or
so more.
"He changed a lot of shots
inside and was very disruptive,"
Davis said of Vanos. "We just
got out of our flow."
The player Vanos
"disrupted" the most was Card
center John Revelli, who en
tered the game averaging 17.3
points per game. Revelli was
held scoreless in the first half
and to just seven points total
(on a 2-for-9 shooting perfor
mance) by Vanos anil his front
court teammates — 6-7 Mike
Norman and 6-5 Scott Lamson.
Vanos also played a key role
in Santa Clara's ability to
break Stanford's full-court
press time and again. Bronco
Coach Carroll Williams had
Vanos inbound the ball against
the press and the center's
height advantage enabled him
to find streaking teammates
downcourt for easy baskets.
"They did a very nice job
against our pressure," Davis ex
plained. "We were just a step
late. We weren't as quick and
aggressive as we had to be to
stop them."
The loss overshadowed a bril
liant performance by Stanford
guard Keith Jones and his
game-high 26 points, 16 of
which he scored in the second
half. In fact, Jones was the
only Card player who did not
sleepwalk at the beginning of
each half, scoring Stanford's
first eight points of each per
iod.
Statisically speaking, the
game was a disaster. Stanford
shot a miserable 43.9 percent
(29-of-66) from the floor, in
cluding a 37 percent perfor
mance (10-for-27) in the first
half. Although the Card made
8-of-9 second-half free
throws, it was 3-for-8 in the
first period (37.5 percent) with
two missed front ends of one
and-ones. Santa Clara, mean
while, shot h2.2 percent
(28-of-45) from the floor and
73.9 percent (17-of-23) from
the line.
The assists and steals

categories in the box score
were just as lopsided. The
Broncos assisted 23 of their 28
baskets while the Card was
credited with only seven for
their 29. Santa Clara also had
11 steals. Stanford had one.
To no one's surprise, the tal
ler Broncos outrebounded the
Card as well. Although Revelli
(who led Stanford with 1 1
hoards) and company held a 17-
13 rebounding margin at
halftime, Vanos and his crew
outboarded Stanford 20-13 in
the second half and 33-30 on

the game.
Davis did say playing in Toso
Pavilion against a team from a
different league affected his
team.
"I think you saw a pretty big
home-court advantage," he
said. "You get into a (game
against a team from another)
league where they do things
differently . . . Those are
things that don't disrupt vet
eran ballclubs.
"I think you saw the differ
ence between a veteran
ball club and one that's trying

to become one."
Card notes
Although Santa Clara is the
closest school to Stanford with
a Division I basketball pro
gram. the two schools are not
big rivals. You'd never know it,
however, judging by the over
flow crowd in Toso last night.
At one point in the game, a
few members of the Stantord
Band wandered into the Santa
Clara student section and were
promptly pummeled by cups,
wads of paper and other debris.
An usher finally ordered the

Band members back to their
section located on the other
side of the arena.
Bronco forward Mike Nor
man electrified the partisan
crowd with a pair of heart
stopping two-handed dunks.
The first slam came off a lob
pass from Harold Keeling and
the second was over Card back
up center Grady Johnson, who
unsuccessfully tried to block
the powerful jam.
