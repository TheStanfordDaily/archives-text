# Dupree: too cool for school?
## 
### 
Last week, another chap
ter in the continuing saga ol
Marcus Dupree unfolded
But the chaptei wasn't very
original: Dupree had only
decided to leave school.
Dupree had decided U
drop out of the University
of Southern Mississippi
making that the second
school he hud left this aca
demic year. Earlier this year
Dupree left the University
of Oklahoma lor several
reasons. Most important
among those reasons was
Du| ree's inability to get
along with Sonnets' Coach
Barry Switzer.
Dupree hasn't yet given a
reason for leaving USM.
A relative of his told the
press that Marcus was disap
pointed with the NCAA's
ruling that he would have to
sit out a year of college
football and wouldn't be el
igible until 1985
Because Dupree hasn't
said anything himself, his
departure from the college
ranks has not yet stirred any
major controversy. But

when Dupree does finally
confess to the public his
motivation, or lack there
of. nobody is going to be
too surprised.
Dupree is going to turn
professional and when he
docs sign a mega-dollar con
tract with some USFL
team, the furor will begin.
Some writers and fans will
lament the "tragedy of

On
second
thought
Jason Cole

Marcus Dupree." They will
claim that he has slighted
Ins team and college foot
ball as a whole. Coaches will
claim that he has been
taken advantage of by the
pro ranks, whose only con
cern is to win and put people
in the stands.
Worst of all. they will all
claim, is that Dupree is

being deprived of his right
to a college education â€” that
the big money of profes
sional sports lured him from
the classroom and that he
wasn't mature enough to
handle the offers.
Other critics may point
out that Dupree's younger
brother is very ill and needs
expensive medical treat
ment. Since Dupree's family
is not able to afford these
treatments right now. he
will evidently sign a pro of
fer to try and help out his
family.
But the biggest tragedy
of Marcus Dupree is none of
the above. What I mean to
say is that all of those in
stances are too bad, but the
real tragedy is the circum
stance that Dupree is now
in.
The NFL has already said
that it will not allow any of
its teams to sign or talk to
Dupree until his entering
class is supposed to
graduate. That's 1986. In
fact, after Dupree was told
by the NCAA that he would

have to sit out a year after
transferring from Okla
homa to USM, the NFL said
that it would not even
touch him until he was
supposed to graduate.
That's 1987.
Then there's the USFL.
Last year, after signing
Herschel Walker, it received
so much criticism that the
league's president said that
it would stay away from sign
ing underclassmen again.
But, unlike the NFL, the
USFL has yet to put that
sentiment in writing.
So, with the USFL,
Dupree has an interested
party that's fearful of
repercussions and another
party, the NFL, that
refuses to even look at him.
The reason that these
two leagues are, and always
have been, shying away from
Dupree, and underclassmen
in general, is that they are
trying to protect the inter
ests of college football and
its players. Flayers should be
