# Trainers here help to prevent, aid and rehabilitate injuries
## 
### TRASK LEONARD 
A player goes up for a layup and
comes tumbling to the floor, twisting
an ankle. Immediately, a trainer appears
on the scene to assist the player.
Most people just notice the trainer
when an injury occurs. Yet this is only a
fraction of his important role in a
sports program.
According to Stan Scott, head
trainer for the Athletic Department,
the trainer, as the most immediate
medical authority for a team, holds
quite a hit of responsibility for the
squad's physical well-being.
"The trainer must always be around
to watch at every practice and at every
game in case an injury occurs," said
Scott. "And we've had some real life
threatening situations over the years
which have been successfully attended
to by our staff."
He continued, "Just last November,
we had a very serious injury on our
hands at the Big Game when Darryl
Grissum injured his spinal cord. We had
to hold our breath on that one, but for
tunately, everything was okay. But
more often, we are called upon to fix a
cut eyebrow or tape an ankle."

There is much more to a trainer's job
than being just a first-aid attendant,
however. He must concern himself with
preventive medicine in order to prevent
injuries.
For Jim Liukkonen, trainer for the
Cardinal basketball team, this means
advising Head Coach Tom Davis on the
exercises and conditioning that will be
most effective in preventing major in
juries.
For example, proper stretches and
warm-up drills are discussed and imple
mented. And so far, this strategy has
paid off, as no season-ending injuries
have been sustained.
But no matter how many preventive
measures are utilized, injuries will occur,
as seen by those to John Revelli and
Andy Fischer earlier this season.
"No matter what you do, there still
will be injuries to our basketball
players," explained Scott. "When a
player goes up to the basket or makes a
flying leap through the air for a loose
ball, there's no telling what will happen.
Yet we believe that if nothing strange
happens, our players will have been con
ditioned enough to remain injury-free."
If a major injury occurs, however.

rehabilitation after the fact is neces
sary. And that's where the trainers en
ter the picture again.
The trainers design a rehabilitation
program specifically for the injured
player and see to it that the program is
carried out. For many athletes, this can
mean months and months of hard work
in order to get back into shape.
Lance Shebelut, a varsity baseball
player who injured his knee and is out
for the season, is just beginning his
rehabilitation under Scott.
"I'm just starting, but they've got
me on a program already which I hope
will get me going again. They seem to
know a lot about my problem," said
Shebelut.
Such medical knowledge is an abso
lute prerequisite for the job. Many
trainers have been emergency medical
technicians or nurses. And all trainers
have to be accredited by a national
trainers' association in order to be
hired.
Scott received a physical education
degree here with an emphasis in physical
therapy.
"It took a lot of hard work and pa
tience to become a trainer."
