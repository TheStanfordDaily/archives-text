# Kennedy criticizes animal research foes

### 
University President Donald
Kennedy spoke out harshly yester
day against animal rights activists
who he said resort to "deceptive
argument" and "terrorist tactics"
to stop scientific research on live
animals.
In remarks prepared for a
speech at the Comstock Club in
Sacramento yesterday, Kennedy
said that while abuses do occur in
animal experiments, "legitimate
concern over such excesses . . . has
turned into a political movement
that seeks to present all research
on animals, no matter how care
fully and ethically it is conducted,
no matter how serious the disease
it is aimed at ameliorating."
Kennedy lashed out at a bill
sponsored by Sen. David Roberti
(D-Los Angeles) which would
prohibit the use of pound animals
for scientific research.
"This legislation would have the
effect of doubling the number of
animals to be killed or experi

merited upon and, at the same
time, increasing the cost of
health-related research in the
state's institutions by at least $3
million and as much as $10 mil
lion," Kennedy said. "It is hard to
imagine a more self-defeating
proposition."
Kennedy criticized specifically
the tactics on the part of animal
rights activists attempting to dis
rupt medical research.
"On Christmas Day, intruders
into a biomedical research labora
tory at UCI.A stole a dozen dogs
that were being used in experi
ments directed at human heart
disease," he said. "In San Fran
cisco, such intense personal at
tacks were directed against a
member of the UC faculty who is
performing extremely valuable ex
periments on vision and balance in
monkeys that the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors was per
suaded to hold hearings on the
matter."
