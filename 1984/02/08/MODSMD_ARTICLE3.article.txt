# Testing begins for murderer
## Streleski moved for evaluation 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Staff writer 
Theodore Streleski, the convicted
murderer of Mathematics Prof.
Karel deLeeuw, has been transferred
from Soledad Prison to the Vacaville
State Medical Facility to undergo an
in-house psychiatric evaluation or
dered by California Department of
Corrections officials.
The move was requested by the
state attorney general's office after
Streleski told reporters he was
"absolutely noncommittal on whe
ther (he) will go back to Stanford
and kill again."
The evaluation will probably last
from two weeks to a month, accor
ding to Phil Guthrie, corrections de
partment spokesman. If doctors at
Vacaville determine that Streleski is
dangerous, he could be kept in cus
tody for an additional period not ex
ceeding 180 days. The period is
renewable. But if doctors decide
Streleski is not dangerous, "he goes
out (March 23) and becomes a
parolee," Guthrie said.
Streleski has refused psychiatric
treatment, claiming that the accep
tance of treatment would be an ad
mission that he had "done something
wrong in doing the murder." Should
Streleski continue to refuse to
cooperate, his mental state will be
judged using a "review from the
file," Guthrie said.
Lt. Bill Hartwell, spokesman for
the Vacaville facility, said yesterday
Streleski had "not (agreed) to my
knowledge" to undergo any psychia
tric evaluation. "Streleski (refused)
at Soledad. 1 anticipate he'll probably
do the same here."

The evaluation process at Vacaville
began the moment Streleski arrived
Friday night, Hartwell said. No
deadline has been set for its comple
tion.
If doctors find Streleski sane and
not dangerous, he will be released in
San Francisco on March 23 and as
signed to Parole Officer Dick Ban
dettini. Streleski will then be banned
from the Stanford campus, forbid
den from contacting University
employees and obligated to attend a
parole out-patient psychiatric clinic,
Bandettini said.
Bandettini said he is optimistic
about Streleski's release. "I do not
consider him a danger at the mo
ment," Bandettini said. He said he
plans to meet often with Streleski if
he is released, but added, "if I feel
comfortable ... I will slack off."
University employees may not feel
so comfortable should Streleski be
released in San Francisco. Many fac
ulty members and officials ques
tioned by reporters have remained
silent, fearing that Streleski will
return to campus. University spokes
men refuse to comment on what ac
tion — if any — Stanford will take
to keep Streleski away from the
campus.
At present. University police say
they are doing all they can to offer
protection, according to Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. Police have advised
the Mathematics Department fac
ulty to check that their homes are
secure and have attempted to pro
vide as much information on
Streleski as possible, Niemeyer said.
"The media (have) done a good
job" informing people about this
case, he said. Niemeyer has received
calls from "as far as Chicago" con
cerning Streleski's planned release.

University of Chicago professors who
taught at Stanford while Streleski
studied here expressed fear that
Streleski might travel to Chicago
while on parole, Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer said his department will
reassess its precautionary measures if
Streleski is released.
