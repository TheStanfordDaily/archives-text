# DoD role questioned
## Panel debates research funding 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
A panel of professors and Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) researchers debated the role
of military funding for research here
last night.
Earl Cilley, director of the Univer
sity's Sponsored Projects Office,
headed the forum by giving a sense of

the relative magnitude of Depart
ment of Defense-sponsored projects
at Stanford.
Cilley said the Department of
Defense pays for approximately 20
percent of the non-SLAC-sponsored
research here, which transfers into
roughly $155 million.
Stanford as an institition is

neutral, and imposes no judgments
on the nature ot reseaicli done, ex
cept that the work done here cannot
be illegal or classified, Cilley said.
Computer Science Prof. Terry
Winograd, who refuses to accept any
military funding for his research, said
he opposes the "overall militariza
tion of our society. There aren't
paramilitary forces marching in the

streets, hut an overall tendency to
look to military solutions for
preservation of our society. That has
to turn around.
"1 don't have the view that there
are bad guys on campus, hut a con
flict of interests," Winograd said. "I
believe that putting money into
areas whose primary objective is mili

tary is a distortion."
According to Winograd, the only
solution is collective effort."lf we
were all burning garbage, and
everybody stopped, then we could
breathe. If it becomes a collective ac
tivity it will clear the air. No one per
son will stop societal trends," he said.
Von Eshleman, an electrical
engineering professor who has
received Department of Defense
support for his work, said funding
agencies do determine the nature of
research they are funding.
"No matter how good we are we
can't spend a lot of taxpayers' money
just based on what we think we
should be doing. There is a certain
overall involvement with society," he
said.
According to Prof. Robert
Mozley, a physicist at SLAC who
has brought up concerns about
military-funded research in the Fac
ulty Senate, many researchers
originally came to SLAC to avoid in
volvement with the military.
"The percentage of research
funded by the Department of
Defense is small, but in individual de
partments it can be quite large. Mili
tary funding reduces the choice
students have," Mozley said. "If
they wish to avoid military funding
they will have great difficulty.
"I don't think military research is
bad,'" he added, "but it changes the
atmosphere of the University and
the ways students react. It just
doesn't help the University very
much."
Mozley said he does not want to
see SLAC become a "sort of trade
school for Silicon Valley. In a non
military atmosphere, to have military

research thrust down researchers'
throats is something that's improper
tor a University," he said.
According to John Harris, deputy
director of Stanford Positron
Electron Accelerator Ring at SLAC
and an outspoken opponent of
weapons-related research at Stan
lord, the University has special re
sponsibilities in the nuclear weapons
research arena.
"In the nation as a whole, military
funding has doubled in the past five
years. 1 see that as an indicator of
the increasing militarization of our
society," he said.
"Weapons of course end up killing
people, and in a world in a time of
desperate trouble, 1 take the posi

tion that somebody has to take re
sponsibility. We're very close to the
top of the hierarchy of responsibility
at this institution."
However, Computer Science Prof.
John McCarthy strongly supports
military - 112 un d e d re se arc h.
â€¢"I think that the charge of in
creasing militarism is phony. It's not
true. None of the other speakers has
mentioned the Soviet Union and
communism. If the other major su
perpower were Canada, everything
the peace movement says would be
correct. Russia is a dangerous power
with the potential to become a nu
clear Napoleon," McCarthy said.
Last night's forum was sponsored
by a SWOPSI course entitled
"Military Funding for Research at
Stanford" and Residential Educa
tion. About 40 people attended the
forum, held at Schiff House.
