Spacewalking 101: 3 units, MWF 10
Stanford in Space becomes reality once again as Stanford graduate Bruce McCandless uses a manned
maneuvering unit to take a different sort of walk outside the space shuttle Challenger. While totally in
dependent from the shuttle, McCandless soared at 17,500 miles per hour above the Stanford home
campus — and the rest of the Earth, which is shown in the bottom of the picture. McCandless received
his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford in 1965 and was a candidate for a Ph.D.
here in 1966 when he was accepted into the astronaut program. McCandless is Stanford's third
astronaut: Prof. Owen Garriott and graduate Sally Ride preceded him in space. Please see story in
Digest, page 2.
