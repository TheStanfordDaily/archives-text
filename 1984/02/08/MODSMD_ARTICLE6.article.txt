# Experts split on U.S. actions in Nicaragua
## 
### DUN GIFFORD, JR 
Nicaragua has become an "evil empire with
"totalitarian potential," Hoover Fellow Robert
Wesson said in a debate here yesterday.
Wesson differed sharply with Political Science
p rof. Richard Fagen, who attributed Nicaraguan
instability to U.S. military pressure. Both men
have recently traveled in Nicaragua.
Wesson said the Sandinista government has an
"inferiority complex" that has resulted in "anti-
Yankeeism. They aren't anti-United States be
cause they are Marxist. They are Marxist because
they are anti-United States."
Wesson, on leave from a political science post
al UC-Santa Barbara, painted a bleak economic
â– '"d political picture of Nicaragua.
Wesson said Nicaragua is a country with
'empty shelves" and "shortages ot almost every
bing Ironi toothpaste and toilet papei o ai e

quate public transportation and means of
agricultural distribution.
"Pick-up trucks have been converted to public
buses and are bulging with people." He said the
overall situation is "bad. very bad."
According to Wesson, one reason for this con
dition is "the exodus of the upper and middle
classes that have taken capital and skill with
them."
Wesson described the present politics of the
Sandinista government as "nationalism mixed
with Marxism-Leninism that provides a
framework for Nicaraguan history" and "gives
the Nicaraguan revolution an international
flavor."
Wesson said Nicaragua has been "mobilized
beyond the needs of a border conflict and as
thoroughly as an underdeveloped nation can be."
Afterward, Wesson said "the United States

probably doesn't have the means to overthrow
the Sandinista government; they arc probably
there to stay."
The goal of the Reagan administration's policy
in the region, he said, "is to bring the Sandinistas
to moderation," and "requires no Soviet engage
ment" in the Nicaraguan government.
Fagen, however, maintained that a "solution
that does not go to the heart of the economic
and social problems is mistaken."
Fagen focused on what he called misguided
Reagan administration policy in Central
America."It is not in the national interests of
the United States to deepen involvement in or
der to roll back the Nicaraguan revolution and
defeat insurgency," he said.
