Astronauts use jetpacks to fly
Houston — Two American astronauts flew free through
space yesterday driven by nothing more thun the jet power
of the backpacks they wore over their spacesuits.
Looking like descendants of fictional hero Buck Rogers,
astronauts Bruce McCandless and Robert Stewart became
the tirst people to leave the safety of their mother space
ship without lifelines. Soaring more than 300 feet down
from the confines of the space shuttle Challenger,
McC andless and Stewart took turns taking flying space
walks while astronauts Vance Brand, Robert Gibson and
Ronald McNair watched from inside Challenger's cabin.
"It may have been one small step for Neil," McCandless
said, referring to Neil Armstrong's words as he stepped on
the moon, "but it was one heck of a big leap for me."
McCandless' tongue-in-cheek reference to Armstrong s
famous phrase, "That's once small step for man. one giant
leap for mankind," was also directed at himself. He waited
IN years for his first spaceflight and 16 years to be the first
person to fly through space with the backpack he helped to
develop.
Yesterday's Hying space walk was a remarkably trouble
free test of a new machine and a tremendous relief to the
astronauts and their flight directors. Until now, the 10th
shuttle mission has been plagued by one failure after an
other: the loss of two communications satellites and the
explosion of a balloon that astronauts were to use to test
new rendezvous procedures in space.
Israel would back U.S. if asked
to help support Gemayel
Jerusalem — U.S. Ambassador Samuel Lewis met here
yesterday with senior Israeli officials and the United States
and Israel considered whether the two countries should
take military steps in support of the beleaguered govern
ment of Lebanese President Amin Gemayel.
Lewis met with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
Defense Minister Moshe Arens for 90 minutes against the
backdrop of the deteriorating situation in Beirut. Israeli
sources said the U.S. ambassador had asked for the meeting.
Israel radio said last night Shamir had reiterated to Lewis
that Israel is not directly involved and therefore could do
little to help the situation.
Senior government officials here ruled out any large-scale
Israeli operation such as the movement of ground troops or
any unilateral Israeli action in support of Gemayel. But for
the first time, the officials suggested a willingness to take
limited military steps in conjunction with the United
States if the Reagan administration decided to try to res
cue the Gemayel government.
The clear impression from their comments was that the
decision on further steps in support of Gemayel rests with
the Reagan administration. But Israel would probably
cooperate if asked to as part of the "strategic coopera
tion" accord between the two countries that was reached
by Shamir and President Reagan in November.
House passes Salvadoran aid
Washington —The House of Representatives passed a bill
yesterday that once again would link U.S. aid to El Salvador
to formal certification by the Reagan administration that
the Salvadoran government continues to make serious ef
forts to extend human rights to all of its citizens.
The action, by a voice vote, was a rebuff to President
Reagan, who pocket-vetoed an identical measure late last
year, and renewed a debate that has been a focal point of
differences between Congress and the administration on
Central American policy.
A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate and is
scheduled to be taken up by the Foreign Relations Commit
tee when it considers the administration's foreign-aid pack
age next month.
But in the wave of the House action, an aide to Sen.
Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), chief sponsor of the Senate
bill, said an effort might be made today to persuade Sen.
Charles Percy (R-Ill.), the committee chairman, to consider
the measure immediately.
Soviets massacre Afghans
Islamabad. Pakistan — Soviet occupation troops killed
hundreds of Afghan civilians in a massive punitive operation
against rural populations in the Shomali region of Afghanis
tan last week, western diplomatic sources reported in the
Pakistani and Indian capitals yesterday.
Istalef, a historic town that was half-destroyed in a
similar reprisal last October, was the worst hit among the
six places subjected to heavy ground and air attacks north
of the Afghan capital of Kabul between Feb. 2 through
Feb. 4, the sources said.
Soviet ground troops reportedly raided Istalef several
hours before dawn Thursday and captured or killed 10
Mujahedeen resistance fighters and set fire to their houses
and vehicles.
Those captured were taken out of the town, some of
them "with their wives and children," and were killed by
their throats being slit. Their bodies were stuffed in wells,
the sources said quoting survivors reaching Kabul.
House committee approves
national drinking age of 21
Washington — The House Energy and Commerce Com
mittee yesterday approved a bill that would effectively es
tablish a nationwide drinking age of 21, a move supporters
said would save thousands of lives by decreasing alcohol
related teenage traffic deaths.
The measure now goes to the full House.
Critics of the bill contend that a higher drinking age
would not stop young people from driving when intoxicated
and that the bill might unconstitutionally infringe on
states' regulatory powers.
The Presidential Commission on Drunk Driving recom
mended Dec. 13 that Congress deny federal highway funds
to states with minimum drinking ages lower than 21. Presi
dent Reagan endorsed the uniform drinking age but disap
proved of the withholding of highway funds to achieve the
purpose.
States now establish minimum drinking ages, which range
from 18 to 21. Nineteen states have set the age at 21.
Many states lowered the drinking age when 18-year-olds
were given the right to vote in 1971.
Late rally halts selling spree
New — A cease-fire settled in on an embattled
stock market yesterday as a late rally halted a selling spree
that one analyst dubbed the " 1984 Winter Massacre."
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, down
22.72 points Monday in its biggest slide in more than a year,
started the trading day by falling another eight points
before rebounding in the final 90 minutes of trading.
The stock market's best-known indicator wound up the
session with a gain of 6.18 points at 1180.49, its biggest
gain since Jan. 5.
