From the Los Angeles Times
Santa Barbara — President Reagan yesterday or
dered the phased withdrawal of U.S. Marines from
Beirut Airport to Navy ships offshore and authorized
naval and air bombardment in retaliation for any fire
from Syrian-held territory into Beirut.
The president's orders — withdrawing the Marines
from acute danger while escalating U.S. militarv ac
tion in Lebanon — appeared to have a twofold aim:
to try to save the government of Amin Gemayel
from overthrow by opposition militias and to resolve
a major domestic political problem by withdrawing
the Marines from their "sitting •duck" airport
bunkers.
Reagan announced his decision as he arrived here
for a five-day vacation at his ranch.
Reagan said the Marines, beginning "shortly," will
be withdrawn from their positions at the airport in
phases. One White House senior official, who
declined to be identified, said that 500 of the esti
mated 1200 to 1500 Marines now at the airport will
be withdrawn within a month.

But a Senate aide said that administration officials
told Republican leaders that an initial contingent of
500 Marines would be pulled out of Beirut "shortly"
and that the whole contingent would be out "within
a month."
Ot the president s order to use naval gunfire and
air support against torces tiring on Beirut from
Syrian-held positions, the aide said, "We look at it as
protecting our people coming out."
In related actions, the administration:
• Gave U.S. Marine commanders in Beirut a freer
hand to respond to attacks.
• Dispatched a U.S. diplomat to France, Britain and
Italy to review the mission of the four-nation
peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
• Announced that 41 U.S. Embassy personnel and
dependents in Beirut had been evacuated to Ameri
can ships ottshore. though others remained ashore.
In his statement, Reagan said that the moves were
taken at Gemayel's request. He also said that he had
made the decision "after consultation" with French.
British and Italian leaders.

The Capitol Hill aide said that the other nations in
the multinational torce were notified an hour before
the president's announcement.
In all. 263 U.S. troops have died in Lebanon since
Reagan sent American forces there on a controversial
peacekeeping mission in September 1452. Of the
total. 241 American Marines and sailors were killed in
a suicide truck-bomb attack on the airport
headquarters last Oct. 23.
In his statement. Reagan said that some U.S. mili
tary personnel would remain on shore in Lebanon tor
training and equipping the Lebanese army and
protecting the remaining personnel."
But he said that "to enhance the safety" of the
American and multinational forces, he had
"authorized U.S. naval forces ... to provide naval
gunfire and air support against any units tiring into
greater Beirut from parts of Lebanon controlled by
Syria, as well as against any units directly attacking
American or MF personnel and facilities.
