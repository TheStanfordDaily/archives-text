# President seeks to avoid political liability

From The Washington Post
Washington â€” President Reagan's
decision to pull U.S. Marines out of
Lebanon and threaten increased mili
tary pressure against Syria represents
an etiort to salvage one of the adminis
tration's riskiest political positions in a
presidential election year.
Administration officials said that
the decision, which one called a
"recognition of reality," was prompted
by concern for the safety of the
Marines deployed in Beirut as part of
the multinational force there. The kil
ling of a Marine there last Tuesday had
increased the number of U.S. ser
vicemen killed in Lebanon to 263.

However, the president's statement
yesterday emphasized support for the
embattled government of Lebanese
President Amin Gemayel and a commit
ment to back it with potentially in
creased naval gunfire and air support,
leaving open the possibility that the
United States could still be engaged in
military action against Syrian and
Syrian-backed Moslem militia forces in
Lebanon for a long time.
Democrats and Republicans in
Congress praised Reagan's decision to
move the Marines offshore, agreeing
that it could defuse what appeared to
be a tough political issue for both par
ties. But concern also was stated about

the prospect of continued military in
volvement after the Marines leave
Beirut and about how quickly they will
be evacuated.
The decision to remove the Marines
from Beirut to ships offshore, long ad
vocated by Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger and the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, comes at a time when Reagan
has been under increasing pressure from
his advisers and his political opponents
to withdraw them.
The political risks to Reagan became
especially apparent during the last two
days while the president made political
speeches in Illinois and Nevada before
taking what is planned as a five-day

vacation at his ranch near Santa Bar
bara. In Las Vegas yesterday, as the sit
uation worsened in Beirut, Reagan
dropped all references to Lebanon from
his speeches, which focused intead on
his domestic policy record.
Public opinion surveys taken by
White House pollster Richard Wirthlin
have pointed up the unpopularity of
continued deployment of the Marines
in Lebanon. Such prominent
Republicans as Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-
Nev.), Reagan's campaign chairman, and
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.) have warned that it could
harm Republican candidates and
Rpapan's own chances of re-election.
