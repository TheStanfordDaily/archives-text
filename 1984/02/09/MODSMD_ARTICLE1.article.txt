# Experts laud Beirut pullout, fear more bombing
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily Staff 
Foreign policy experts here applauded
President Reagan's decision to move the
Marines out of Beirut, but said they fear
Reagan's threat to use increased firepower
against Syria and Syrian-backed Moslems in
Lebanon may signal an even greater U.S. mil
itary role in the region.
"This is an escalation of the military in
volvement," said Political Science Prof.
Alexander George. "It amounts to un
declared war and I think it is a very danger
ous move by the United States."
"If this type of military action is carried
out it increases the danger of further escala
tion." George said.
U.S. Navy ships fired more than 350 shells
at Druse militia positions yesterday after
Druse artillerymen targeted U.S. Embassy
offices in West Beirut in their first action
since Reagan warned Tuesday that U.S.
naval and airpower would be used against any
units firing from Syrian-held territory.
Reagan announced Tuesday that most of
the Marines currently stationed in Beirut
will be withdrawn to Navy ships offshore
during the next few months.
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy
also said he feared the decision to intensify

the use of airpower may lead to increased in
volvement.
"One possibility is that with the troops
out we will become more involved as an ac
tive participant which I think would be dis
astrous," Abernethy said.
"If we get involved in a strategic alliance
with Israel against Syria then we may have
the potential for something bigger," he said.
Seymour Martin Upset, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution and a political sci
ence professor here, said Reagan's harsh
warnings to use American firepower may
only be a political cover for what could be
perceived as an embarrassing retreat.
"I think all this rhetoric is just a cover for
getting out so it doesn't look so bad, so we
can say that we're not evacuating and run
ning," I.ipsct said.
Experts here agreed that the U.S.
withdrawal is long overdue and said that U.S.
troops should never have been deployed in
Beirut.
"It was a mess that we were stupid to have
gotten in in the first place," Upset said.
Asst. History Prof. Joel Beinen, an expert
in Mideast affairs, said the withdrawl
represented an "admission that the Marines
shouldn't have been sent there" while Aber
nethy called it "a long overdue move."

Political Science Prof. Jan Iriska said, "We
should never have gone in in the first place.
We went in on a rash decision on the part of
the administration."

U.S. military support of Lebanese Presi
dent Amin Gemayel's government has
reduced the incentive for Ciemayel to make

important political concessions to Druse and
Shiite factions in Lebanon and has helped
worsen the political situation, experts said.
"The incentive to make the necessary con-

cessions has been reduced by our involve
ment," George said. "Our backing has led to
the recent developments."

Ahernethy agreed that "the presence of
our troops reduced Gemayel's willingess to
make concessions."
Triska noted that Gemayel has completely
failed to unite the various factions in
Lebanon under a reconciliation government.
"There is a general agreement among the
factions that he (Gemayel) has not
proceeded along the path he promised. " he
said.
Experts here also said that if the young
Lebanese leader is to survive it is essential
that he make sweeping changes in the gov
ernment by giving Moslems greater represen
tation and that he abandon the May 17
Lebanese- Israeli withdrawal agreement.
That agreement, which Secretary of State
George Shultz helped to negotiate and dog
gedly defended in recent months, has been a
stumbling block in the Lebanese reconcilia
tion conferences because Syrian-backed op
position groups have demanded the
agreement be abrogated.
George said that if Gemayel quickly aban
dons the agreement, "the possiblity of suc
cess in the effort to find some compromise
internally will be greatly improved."
Experts here disagreed on whether the
pullout will hurt U.S. credibility in its other
militarv commitments abroad.
