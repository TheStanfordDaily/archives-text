## The
						Stanford Daily Farm fund-raisers 
### 
With the presidential election year upon us,
we can think of no better way to celebrate than
having Stanford host the appearance of every
major candidate. Thanks to one candidate, Cali
fornia's Democratic senator, Alan Cranston, we
now have a compelling and irresistible reason for
the rest of the pack to visit the Farm â€” free
and unadulterated use of the Stanford Faculty
Club!
Cranston did his part last month, speaking to
a full house at kresge Auditorium and then
moving to a fund-raiser at the Faculty Club.
Wait a second. A fund-raiser at non-partisan
Stanford's non-partisan Faculty Club? Non
partisan, it appears, means no political tund
raising. So somebody goofed, and Cranston got
away with some non-partisan money.
In addition to the Cranston snafu, a group of
University students seems to have made a poli
tical blunder of its own. Students With Hart
may have violated University guidelines on par
tisan political practices when they sent out
mailers under the return address of the ASSU
offices.
But who knows? Perhaps this will bring Hart
to the University to defend the action of his
loyal supporters. As some students have
asserted, if Harvard University can attract the

eight Democratic candidates to its campus,
then Stanford is surely justified in doing its part
to persuade them to come to the Farm.
We wholeheartedly agree. We urge the Uni
versity to immediately invite Mssrs. Reagan,
Mondale, Glenn, Hart, Jackson, Hollings, Askew
and McGovern to Stanford and offer them full
run of the Faculty Club for a fund-raiser after
they speak at Kresge.
Never mind the fact that of the approxi
mately 100 people who showed up at the
Cranston fund-raiser, a large portion were non
paying students, campaign staffers and jour
nalists. The Cranston campaign may have been
revived with this massive influx of funds, and
the political tremors may soon be felt through
out the nation. Cranston was given an unfair ad
vantage in Campaign 'S4 by Stanford, and the
University now has a moral duty to right this
heinous wrong.
Of course, the other candidates may not take
advantage of the Faculty Club's prime fund
raising appeal and the chance to close the gap
with Alan Cranston. If any of the other candi
dates do show up, however, we hope everyone
will be able to forget this tragic blunder. And
maybe, just maybe, we'll be able to concentrate
on what the candidates have to say.
