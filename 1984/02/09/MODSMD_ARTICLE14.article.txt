## A 						choice we shouldn't make 
### 
In "Stanford: Where rich really
means rich" (Daily, Feb. 2). Sushma
Govindarajulu begins an analysis of
the relationship between our emo
tional lives and our class back
grounds. Though her account may be
simplistic and reductivist. a critique
of her article based solely on these
grounds falls far short of any con
structive dialogue. Govindarajulu's
column is an important investiga
tion; her honest and personal style is
to be admired, especially among
articles written by a staff enthralled
by professionalism and obsessed with
a detached "objectivity." But
beyond offering personal reflections
on undergraduate experiences,
Govindarajulu begins to formulate a
critical account of the role human
emotion plays in perpetuating the
consumerist society.
The inadequacies of her analysis
do not prevent us from drawing
meaningful insights from it: I under
stand her account to be
symptomatic of the larger cultural
fragmentation. This malady
manifests itself particularly clearly
in the structure of The Stanford
Daily.
Govindarajulu's article outlines
two positions: By her account an
individual is either materially
wealthy and emotionally crippled or
materially impoverished and emo
tionally rich. She describes two
categories, but, rather than criticize
the social order which inserts us into
these categories, simply suggests
that the poor are "better off" than
the emotionally paralyzed rich.
What begins as an indictment of
society ends up an apology for it.
A critique of the lack of real
choice between these two alterna
tives is not undertaken. Our society,
which truncates and mutilates all
human beings — rich and poor —
thus finds its legitimation in Govin
darajulu's analysis. Failure to look
beyond the immediate results is a
pathetic resignation to the status
quo. An analysis of the relationship
between students' class and enio-

tional life is necessary, hut any
analysis which fails to take into
account the origin of the "given
choices" can only perpetuate the
human distortion inherent in either
of the "choices."
Like Govindarajulu's rich friends.
The Daily and the Stanford
"community" love the passionate
naivete of her article. It and other
personal essays on the Opinions page
function to remind us of the passion
buried in all our souls.
1 he rest of The Daily, aside from
the Opinions page (except for the
advertisements), outlines a void
from which this sentiment has been
extinguished in the name of respon
sible journalism: A positivistic scien
tificity characterized by "innocent"
fact-gathering which results in a
sterile, deadened depiction of the
"real."
The bankruptcy of the rest of the
newspaper will continue as The
Daily, like the naive article, fails to
integrate passion and objectivity,
fails to synthesize emotional health
and material well-being.
As both stand, they merely offer
"choices" — the "emotion" of the
Opinions page or the "real facts" of
the news stories; poverty and human
feeling or wealth and emotional
vacuity — which in reality are not
choices at all. but alternatives based
upon a false division of human
beings and our world. "Choices,"
which, if accepted as adequate or
realistic, impoverish us all.

Vietnam Ball
The caption under the Viennese
Bail photo (Daily. Feb. 6) ended on
shocking note: "Across campus,
students donned battle fatigues to
attend Toyon's alternative party:
The Vietnamese Ball."
That Stanford students — or
anyone — should make a tasteless
joke about one of this century's

greatest international tragedies is a
sad commentary on short memories
and disregards the enduring conse
quences of a war that no one needed
and no one won.

School prayer
My compliments to Bryan Wilden
thal on his incisive criticism of
Reagan's stand on school prayer
(Daily, Feb. 2). It's had enough that
millions of children in their forma
tive years are force-fed nonsensical
dogma in the mental confines of
myth-hound churches and parochial
schools. That we could consider
allowing this organized blindness to
foist itself upon the minds of youth
through the authoritarian vehicle of
the secular voice is a travesty of
ethnicalitv.
The fact that our society is in
creasingly paranoid about self
destruction is no justification for
indoctrinating kids with the drug of
godly guidance. Schools already dish
out a pre-packaged curriculum of
"knowledge" to students who are
tracked, ranked, graded, tested,
grouped and scheduled into con
formity. failure or escape.
If — out of accumulated knowl
edge and experience, and through a
healthily fostered capacity of reason
and feeling — an adult come to
know a God who speaks to the mys
tery and wonder of it all, it is a fine
thing. However, adding another
brick to the walls of closed
mindedness by leading children
through a vacuous daily ritual of
prayer serves only to weaken the
mental vibrancy that makes a true
democracy possible at all.
The way to greater wisdom in the
generations of the future lies not in
blanketing young minds with the
security of false certainty, but in
nurturing the potentials of imagina
tion. critical thinking and caring.
