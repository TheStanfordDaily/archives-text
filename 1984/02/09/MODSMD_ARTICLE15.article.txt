## Amendment a step forward for ASSU 
### 
About a year ago, I was deciding on
issues that I wanted to bring up
during the ASSU elections. I. like a
majority of others, wanted to see a
dramatic improvement in communi
cation between the senate and the
student body.
While the publication of meeting
minutes and the circulation of an of
ficial newsletter (ASSU News) were
suggested as methods of improving

VIEWPOINT

communication, most undergraduate
senators and candidates said the dis
trict representation system is the
prime medium of correspondence.
The "system" essentially assigned un
dergraduate senators to various
dorms for the purpose of attending
house meetings on a regular hasis.
Last fall, the 14th senate re
established a districting system. Each
undergraduate senator and alternate
was asked to attend one or two spe
cific dorm meetings on a bi-weekly
basis. Communication was going to
improve; senate exposure was going
to increase. Many senators were en
thusiastic about the system — and
committed to it. Unfortunately, for
the senate and the students, many
were not.
An important and controversial
by-law amendment concerning the
districting system came before the
senate Jan. 31. The document was ii

tended to require all undergraduate
senators to attend and report at
dorm meetings twice a month each
quarter. The document also stated
that a failure to attend and report
at a district would be treated like an
absence from a full senate or stand
ing committee meeting — and thus
"punished" accordingly. The amend

ment passed, and the senate reason
ing behind the amendment is
important.
Being an idealistic and somewhat
naive young man, I was disappointed
by the necessity of sponsoring the
above amendment. Corny as it
sounds, after I was elected I wanted
to listen to and act upon students'

needs and opinions. 1 assumed every
one felt as 1 did. Why else would
anyone want to be in a student sen
ate?
The senators who did not take
time for their districts surprised me
more than disappointed me. Despite
the new awareness, the Student Af
fairs Committee still felt it essential
that senators be required to attend
district meetings. Hence, the pro
posed amendment came to be.
After the vote (a 9 to 1 majority
on the undergraduate side), I felt
much better, not because the under
graduate senators were now "forced"
to attend dorm meetings, but be
cause the undergraduate senators
had reevaluated their priorities.
Now, at least nine senators and the
ASSU Constitution agree that com
munication and interaction with the
students is the primary responsibility
of a senator — along with atten
dence at senate meetings. That's
good to know.
And whether this change immedi
ately improves communication (and
thus student representation) or not,
is not initially important. At least
for once, the senate deserves some
credit. The amendment stands out as
a large and positive step. The Associ
ated Students of Stanford Univer
sity will be better for it.
