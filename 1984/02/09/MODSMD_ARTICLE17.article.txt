# Reversing discrimination
## 
### 
ine Kignts commission has tinally reversed its
quite uncivil position on quotas that had stigmatized its
activities in recent years. Commission members on Jan. 7
voted 6 to 2 to reject the traditional stand of the body
that supported the use of discriminatory racial quotas
to promote the hiring of minorities.
According to the commission. "Such racial preferences
(quotas) merely constitute another form of unjustified
discrimination, create a new class of victims and. when
used in public employment, offend the constitutional
principle of equal protection of the law for all citizens."
Says commission member Morris Abram. "Equal means
equal. Equal does not mean you have separate lists of
blacks and whites for promotion (as is the case today in
the Detroit Police Department), any more than you
have separate accommodations for blacks and whites for
eating. Nothing will ultimately divide a society more
than this kind of preference and this kind of reverse dis
crimination." Bravo.
At last the commission has acknowledged what the
Civil Rights Act told us 20 years ago and what the Con
stitution said in 1787 — that is. all men are considered
equal before the law.
The quota nonsense began soon after Congress passed
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. President Johnson con
cluded that a simple overnight change from outright ra
cial discrimination to blind, merit-based hiring wasn't
going to instantly rectify the existing racial imbalances
in employment. He prescribed the antidote of
"affirmative action" when he signed Executive Order
1 1246 in 1965. This new program called for job training
to help make minorities attractive job candidates and
began the use of goals and timetables to measure
employers' "progress" in minority hiring.
The use of such goals and timetables expanded greatly
under the Nixon administration.
Universities were forced to demonstrate "advances"
toward a "more acceptable" racial balance or else face
the loss of federal funding. These required "good faith"
efforts were made much simpler by the decisions of
many to implement numerical requirements for minority
hiring and admission. The quota system was born.
What are the results of these measures? Before the
Civil Rights Act a minority job or college applicant
might have been told, "Sorry, we're not interested in
minority applicants." But today, a majority applicant
might be told, "Sorry, you can't have the job. We've got
to fill our minority quota." Is this an advance in civil
rights? Civil rights denotes rights for all. not rights for
the minority.
Yet government condones preferential treatment of
minority job applicants in direct conflict with the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. Title VII of the Act specifically
prohibits an employer "to . . . classify his employees in
any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any indi
vidual of employment opportunities . . . because of such
individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."
The use of goals, timetables, quotas and preferential
hiring directly contradicts both the spirit and the letter
of the Civil Rights Act, yet these practices are encour
aged by the federal government.
How are these blatantly illegal and unconstitutional
actions justified by quota proponents? The typical argu
ment is articulated well in this excerpt from an early "70s
Human Rights Commission training paper: "The special

treatment of minorities is not a preference, hut a
remedial measure designed to rectify the present im
balance that has resulted from past discrimination."
The goal is quite respectable and is shared hv most, but
what of the means — quotas? When critics complain
that quotas foster minority favoritism, and that they
simply reverse the object of discrimination, the pro
quota argument typically responds, in the words of the
HRCs training manual: "The majority has too long
enjoyed an advantage of its own, based on the dis
criminatory exclusion ol another group. (The majority
loses) not a right, but an expectation of benefits
flowing from illegal practices and systems, to which the
majority class was never entitled in the first place."
In other words, since discrimination operated in the
past in favor of the majority, it can operate today in fa-

Undeniably, the concept of retribution against the
majority makes a mockery of ex post facto, a sacred tenet

to the majority for past discrimination any more than
Americans over a hundred years ago could have jailed
former slaveholders.

ol merit-based consideration, making evident the
hypocrisy of preferential treatment.

accomplished by a rejuvenation of American public edu

Exccllence in Education last April, with special atten
tion to the inadequacies of many city schools.
All ot these solutions promote a permanent, real im
provement in the quality of job candidates, providing a
solid cure. Quotas simply perpetuate discrimination and
provide only symptomatic and unconstitutional relief to
our ailing system.

ine Kignts commission has tinally reversed its
quite uncivil position on quotas that had stigmatized its
activities in recent years. Commission members on Jan. 7
voted 6 to 2 to reject the traditional stand of the body
that supported the use of discriminatory racial quotas
to promote the hiring of minorities.
According to the commission. "Such racial preferences
(quotas) merely constitute another form of unjustified
discrimination, create a new class of victims and. when
used in public employment, offend the constitutional
principle of equal protection of the law for all citizens."
Says commission member Morris Abram. "Equal means
equal. Equal does not mean you have separate lists of
blacks and whites for promotion (as is the case today in
the Detroit Police Department), any more than you
have separate accommodations for blacks and whites for
eating. Nothing will ultimately divide a society more
than this kind of preference and this kind of reverse dis
crimination." Bravo.
At last the commission has acknowledged what the
Civil Rights Act told us 20 years ago and what the Con
stitution said in 1787 — that is. all men are considered
equal before the law.
The quota nonsense began soon after Congress passed
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. President Johnson con
cluded that a simple overnight change from outright ra
cial discrimination to blind, merit-based hiring wasn't
going to instantly rectify the existing racial imbalances
in employment. He prescribed the antidote of
"affirmative action" when he signed Executive Order
1 1246 in 1965. This new program called for job training
to help make minorities attractive job candidates and
began the use of goals and timetables to measure
employers' "progress" in minority hiring.
The use of such goals and timetables expanded greatly
under the Nixon administration.
Universities were forced to demonstrate "advances"
toward a "more acceptable" racial balance or else face
the loss of federal funding. These required "good faith"
efforts were made much simpler by the decisions of
many to implement numerical requirements for minority
hiring and admission. The quota system was born.
What are the results of these measures? Before the
Civil Rights Act a minority job or college applicant
might have been told, "Sorry, we're not interested in
minority applicants." But today, a majority applicant
might be told, "Sorry, you can't have the job. We've got
to fill our minority quota." Is this an advance in civil
rights? Civil rights denotes rights for all. not rights for
the minority.
Yet government condones preferential treatment of
minority job applicants in direct conflict with the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. Title VII of the Act specifically
prohibits an employer "to . . . classify his employees in
any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any indi
vidual of employment opportunities . . . because of such
individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."
The use of goals, timetables, quotas and preferential
hiring directly contradicts both the spirit and the letter
of the Civil Rights Act, yet these practices are encour
aged by the federal government.
How are these blatantly illegal and unconstitutional
actions justified by quota proponents? The typical argu
ment is articulated well in this excerpt from an early "70s
Human Rights Commission training paper: "The special

treatment of minorities is not a preference, hut a
remedial measure designed to rectify the present im
balance that has resulted from past discrimination."
The goal is quite respectable and is shared hv most, but
what of the means — quotas? When critics complain
that quotas foster minority favoritism, and that they
simply reverse the object of discrimination, the pro
quota argument typically responds, in the words of the
HRCs training manual: "The majority has too long
enjoyed an advantage of its own, based on the dis
criminatory exclusion ol another group. (The majority
loses) not a right, but an expectation of benefits
flowing from illegal practices and systems, to which the
majority class was never entitled in the first place."
In other words, since discrimination operated in the
past in favor of the majority, it can operate today in fa-
