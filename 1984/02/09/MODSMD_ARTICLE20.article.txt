# 'Lesser God' deeply engaging
## 
### MELINDA ISRAEL 
Mark Medoffs "Children of
a Lesser God" is about the
struggling marriage of James
and Sarah Leeds, an idealistic
speech therapist and his wife, a
deaf woman who refuses to
"adapt" to the world of
hearing.
The play, which won a Tony
Award in 19X0, is an incredible
challenge to any company that
takes it on. The first of many
hurdles is the fact that the
starring actress must be deaf
or at least be fluent in Ameri
can sign langauge (ASL).
There's also the need to
develop unconventional block
ing, to have interpreters at
rehearsals, and in some cases,
to give cast members crash
courses in ASL. To master the
logistics alone of this play is a
victory.
The current Theatre Works
production of "Children of a
Lesser God," playing at the
Burgess Theater in Menlo Park
through March 3, successfully
delivers the powerful message
that the two worlds — silent
and hearing — must somehow
communicate.
For the actors involved in
"Lesser God," it seems this
message has reverberated
through their personal lives as
well.
"It's the hardest thing I've
ever done in my life," said Tom
Woosnam, who plays James.
For Woosnam, this role has
meant cramming ASL for
weeks until his hands were sore
from signing. To satisfy the
deaf audiences in attendance,
he has to have a convincing
command of the language. And
for his co-star Cathy Ransom,
he has to have his signed lines
perfect to cue her in. He des
cribed Ransom as "very, very
patient" with his learning.
Ransom has been deaf since
she was two years old, and like
the character she portrays, has
concentrated her communica
tion skills on sign language, not
lip-reading. She has been an ASL
instructor at Stanford's lin
guistic department for the
past seven years. Recently,
Ransom expressed through an
interpreter some of the real
life experiences the play paral
lels for her. She has been
married to a hearing-impaired
husband for 13 years, but while
in high school in Berkeley, she

did have a hearing boyfriend.
The similarities to Sarah's
predicament are enough to
make her memories vivid again.
"I remember the anger I had
with my old boyfriend when he
tried to push me to speak and
to use my hearing aid," she
said, Her frustration finally
drove her to throw her hearing
aid out.
When comparing her ap
proach to deafness to Sarah's,
however, Ransom sees crucial
differences. "She (Sarah) is a
harder person than I am," said
Ransom. She explains that

Sarah has a hearing husband,
but will no more adapt to the
situation than he will. "I seem
to have gotten along (better
than Sarah) in the hearing
world — I have more connec
tions," she concluded.
Woosnam, too, has some
true identification with his
role. James Leeds is the quin
tessential well-meaning liberal,
who even spent time with
CARE "saving Ecuador"
before teaching at the deaf in
stitution where Sarah grew up.
Woosnam has travelled in
South America and taught in
Chile, where he was "mildly in
volved" in a coup. Also,
Woosmnam's mother in his
native England is deaf, al
though he says his feeling
toward deafness until working
with Cathy was an overwhelm
ing "sense of pity." He
describes "choking" with emo
tion at auditions. Now he says
his co-star in some ways "leads
a fuller life than I do."

Director Anthoney Haney
says "Lesser God" has made
him search for a "different ap
proach to energy, a different
liveliness," to adapt to the
new. more physical language of
the play. To block the produc
tion for deaf audiences, Haney
had to insure that the sightline
between interpreter and
actress is never impeded. Other
challenges included the lack of
formal scenes and set, and. be
cause Haney himself didn't
know ASL, the need for inter
preters to translate his direct
ing to Ransom.

Watching the smooth
opening-night performance,
however, one never would have
guessed the difficulties the
cast had overcome. The actors
were energetic and engaged,
and the tempo never lagged.
The one problem in the play
itself is the use of James to
"interpret" all of Sarah's lines
for us. This convention — a
mandatory one if the audience
is to understand the action —
puts an unfortunate imbalance
in the dialogue. James actually
speaks for Sarah: He signs to
her while saying his words, then
repeats out loud what she signs
back to him. James' voice
makes up the bulk of the play.
This shortcoming is apparent
in Theatre Works' production,
especially since Woosnam is
trying too hard. He really has
his signs down, but in the
excitement of his newly
learned gestures he tends to
over-enunciate his words. In
this case, his English accent is a
disadvantage. While the char

acter James is always joking his
way out of tough situations,
Woosnam tenses up instead.
His James isn't relaxed enough
to be truly convincing. The
sweat he's worked up half an
hour into the production only
confirms that he's muscling his
way through the part.
Ransom captures Sarah's
early cynicism perfectly — her
sour smirks won laughs from
the audience — but in the later
love scenes her emotions are
harder to gauge. Part of the
problem is the overshadowing
by Woosnam. but also Ransom
has to go even further in her
physical (especially facial) act
ing since the audience is
deprived of tones of voice and
isn't accustomed to reading ex
pressions from hands.
Despite the establishment
of a relationship somewhat
different from the one in the
script, the drama is compelling.
Superbly written. "Lesser
God" is not a simple love story
— the play delves deeper, into
questions of language, con
formity to society's norms and
deaf and handicapped rights. It
is in this last area that
Theatre Works' production is
strongest, partly owing to the
excellent and consistent sup
porting roles by Elise Appleby
(Sarah's mother), Rudolf Vest
(Mr. Franklin), Celeste Caden
martori (Lydia) and Mervyn
Greene (Orin).
The high point of the play,
however, belongs to Sarah
alone, as she tries out her
speech for the hearing on dis
crimination in the deaf in
stitution. James has his back to
us, and he interprets as Sarah
signs. For the first time in the
show, we are given the chance
to see the full beauty of the
language, and to "hear" from
Sarah herself. She appeals to
and shuns the hearing world at
once; the ultimate frustration
of her marriage finally surfaces
— that she doesn't know how
to resolve her world with her
husband's.
And after the ensuing con
frontation, one gesture stays
with us — that particular sign
which Sarah says she can't ex
plain, a symbol of the silent
life she yearns to communi
cate. In the air, she pushes one
hand's closed fingers up
through the other's, like new
plants breaking the soil.
