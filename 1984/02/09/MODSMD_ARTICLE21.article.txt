# 'Tuna' funny, if slightly sick
## 
### MARC FAJER 
Tuna, Texas is the sort of little backwater
place that has, as the first commercial on its
radio station in the morning, an ad for a used
weapons store ("guaranteed to kill or we'll
give you one that will"). The Smut Snatchers
Committee, in charge of cleaning up the
school library shelves wants to ban Huck
leberry Finn, in part, because it has boys
dressing up as women. The end-of-the-day
news doesn't go on the air because the
broadcasters lose it. Such is life in Texas'
third-smallest town, according to "Greater
Tuna" which opened last week at the Marines
Memorial Theatre in San Francisco.
The play in many respects is just a careful
collection of all the negative stereotypes
about small towns, conservatives,
Southerners and Texans. Much is predictable,
and a good deal of the humor is a bit sick.
What holds the production together is two
outstanding performances by Joe Sears and
Jaston Williams (who also co-authored the
play with Ed Howard) who, between them,
play all the inhabitants of the town.
We arc introduced to Tuna through its
radio station, OKKK, and the radio broad
casts throughout the day in question tie the
show together. The first news broadcast is
only intermittently funny, but the play picks
up steam and becomes increasingly hysterical.
We are introduced to Petey Fisk (Williams),
head of the Greater Tuna Human Society,
who makes the first of his many radio ap
peals, this time on behalf of displaced ducks.
The second scene is breakfast at the Bumil
ler household. Sears gives an amazing
rendition of Mrs. Bertha Bumiller, the con
summate beehived housewife, frying to deal

with her difficult children, all played by Wil
liams. Little Jody likes to hring dogs home (he
has eight); Charlene is despondent because
she didn't make cheerleader; Stanley has been
to reform school and is disrespectful. As the
day progresses, we see Mrs. Bumiller inter
viewed about her role on the censorship com
mittee, hear about the mysterious death of
the judge found dead wearing a women's bath
ing suit, etc. Though the routines and char
acters are not particularly original, they
manage to be funny in the hands of Williams
and Sears. A few moments stand out particu
larly. Sears does a wonderful characterization
of Aunt Pearl Burras, who keeps chickens and
poisons dogs. Her delight at what she does
("Ah'm gonna kill me a poodle") is hysterical,
as is her carrying out her promise to sing over
the judge's grave. Other notable bits include
the proper acceptable Spanish phrases for use
in bilingual education ("That's not what I or
dered," etc.); the eulogy for the judge as
pronounced by the Reverend Spikes, which
contained more cliches than Polonius' speech
to Laertes ("He kept the home fires burning,
but when he couldn't stand the heat, he got
out of the kitchen . . ."); and Petey Fisk on
protecting fish ("Fish feel pain, they're just
very, very subtle about expressing it").
Overall, "Greater Tuna" is a lot of fun,
and the performances by the stars are com
pelling in their range and depth of charac
terization in many parts. It is a bit
disconcerting to walk away from a show and
think about how sick some of those people
whom you laughed at were, but if that sort
of thing doesn't bother you too much,
"Greater Tuna" is an enjoyable evening of
theater.
