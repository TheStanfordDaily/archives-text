# 'Spell #7' provocative, intriguing
## 
### MARC FAJER 
Perhaps the most powerful memory I have of any
theatrical performance I have attended is of "For
Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When
the Rainbow is Enuf' hy Ntozake Shange on Broad
way several years ago. The combination of poetry,
beautifully stylized movement and an intriguing look
into a world I had never imagined left a profound im
pression. Shange's "Spell #7," which opened last
Wednesday at the Nitery on campus, has most of the
elements which made "For Colored Girls . . so pow -
erful, and though the actors are often not up to the
technically demanding nature of the poetry, the show
is a provocative and occasionally moving experience.
The framework for the series of poems, a group of
black actors and actresses talking in a bar, is prefaced
by a dance number by the entire company in which
they perform stereotypical "black" music in minstrel
masks. The effect, representative of the way whites
view black entertainment, is disconcerting, at least to
a white audience member. We then are introduced to
the bar and its inhabitants who relate a scries of
stories and talk about their li\ es and the way they
view the world.
There were continual problems with the recitation
of the stories, especially early in the play. The articu-

lation was often poor, and in some segments the
poetry sounded very unnatural on the lips of a partic
ular player. However, director James Cadena is to be
commended for creating a total mood that rose
above the technical problems. The staging, the use of
movement, the carefully thought-out interaction be
tween the actors (aided tremendously by Wendell
Cole's set and Michael Ramsaur's subtle lighting) pre
sented a very strong and sustained set of feelings
that gave at least a glimpse to a white audience of
what "blackness" is about. Although I realize I am
giving only a white reaction to the show. I feel a bit
constrained by circumstance. And because so much of
the show defines "blackness" in its reaction to
whites, it is hard to think of the play in any other
terms. There are quite a few moments in the play
which are more universal and deal with pains and
pleasures that are common to all. but the overriding
messages of "Spell #7" are about what it means to be
black. This is not to say that this is a self-pitying cry
for help for the oppressed; the power and life
affirming value of the culture presented are of a dif
ferent nature entirely.
Several performances in the production stand out.
Pat Saidi does two brilliant turns, the first as a wo
man obsessed with having a child, the second a bitter

and funny meditation on what it would be like to be a
white girl. There is a very funny segment about a
married woman looking for a night on the town
(Audrey Renee Taylor) told in part by the cabbie
who picks her up (Cory Williams). Upendano k.azi
does a lovely poem about the magic she finds in brush
ing her hair. An especially poignant segment about
the difficulties of growing up black and the series of
disillusionments that take place is movingly carried
off by Rachel Bagby. To get back at her race for not
living up to her expectations, every time a black per
son does something unworthy, she buys gold, knowing
it was probably mined in South Africa.
Though these few moments stand out, it is the
overall impression which is most memorable. The cast,
which also included Keith Archuletta, Lewis An
thony. Nancy Elizabeth Branch and Daniel Coles,
is excellent, and all contributed to the sense of
the whole by their distinctive presences. "Spell #7" is
well worth seeing: The poetry and movement are
lovely and. at least for white theater-goers, it may
make you think about things in new wavs.
(The Drama Dept./Black Performing Arts produc
tion of "Spell # 7" will be at the Nitery Thursday.
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.)
