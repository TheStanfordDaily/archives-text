KISS: Metamorphosized for
the' Bos?
Being a fan of somewhat
frowned-upon bands has never
been easy and being a KISS fan
has certainly been no excep
tion. Hints of disapproval and
disdain appear as soon as a

friend flips through your
record collection and stares in
disbelief: "KISS ... do you
really like them??" Subsequent
visits to your room become in
frequent. and when they do oc
cur. it is not uncommon to find
your friend carrying a cross or
garlic cloves strung around his

or her neck lest too much of
Gene Simmons' vampire per
sona had rubbed off on you.
Well, last Wednesday KISS
broke most chains with the
past and again proved to its
fans what we knew all along:
KISS is one of the best hard
rock bands in the world.
Unfortunately, the evening
was not to be without its weak
points, namely the two opening
bands. KISS has spawned some
fine groups, including Sammy
Hagar and Cheap Trick, but
they blew it when they chose
Riot and Vandenberg as
openers.
Introduced as a "New York
City Gangster Rock" band,
Riot secured its position as a
third-rate heavy metal group
with a dull set of trudging rip
off rock. What can one do with
two competent but lackluster
guitarists (which unfortunate
ly meant two lackluster solos)
and a ridiculous lead singer
whose idea of showmanship was
to get on all fours and shake his
head up and down?
The second band, Vanden
berg, promised to be more in
teresting. Hailing from

Holland, its set began with the
lowering of a fancy mural, an
operatic track and spacey light
ing. Regrettably, the band
should have left it at that.
An excruciatingly boring
group on stage, its saving grace
was only the hilarity of the
lead singer. The diminutive
singer's conception of getting
the crowd going was to leave
his microphone by the drum
kit, run to the front of the
stage, extend his arms, retract
them, and then scurr\ back to
the safety of the pounding
drums.
After a short break, the
house lights dimmed, ice fog
flooded the stage and evil
ululations filled the air. But
suddenly, what is this? Enter
the local fire marshal!. No
bombs, no fireworks and less
stage set, says he. Well, so be
it, and so it was. KISS with no
makeup and now without a
show. Their work was cut out
for them.
As it turned out, proving
that it could stand alongside
any band in the rock hierarchy
with or without a show was to
be the least of KISS' worries

that night.
Plagued by a muddy sound
mix for much of the show, a lot
of the singing was to be buried
under Gene Simmon's thunder
ing bass. In fact during his solo.
Gene threatened the sound
man twice with his axe-shaped
instrument, until finally the
sound level was not unlike put
ting your head inside a jet
engine at full throttle.
With subtlety cast by the
wayside, KISS thundered
through material from its 11-
year, 19-album career and
showed the audience what real
unadulterated rock and roll
with a vengeance was all about.
Opening with "Creatures of
the Night" and sliding right
into "Detroit Rock City,"
KISS performed like a band
possessed.
The band's shedding of the
elaborate costumes and make
up seemed to have released
previously untapped sources of
bedlam. Paul Stanley's com
mand of the audience was ab
solute. From his 'playing' of
the audience to his risque raps
before songs, his stamina
seemed unlimited.

Not to be outdone bv Stan
ley, relatively new bandmcm
bers Erie Carr (drums) and
Vinnie Vincent (lead guitar),
though lacking the supreme
showmanship of the two
founding members, were both
quite impressive. With Carr
pounding the skins atop his
Sherman tank turret and Vin
cent thrashing at his guitar
during one of the best (if not
longest) solos I've ever heard,
they firmly established their
place in the KISS lineup.
The setting of the Berkeley
Community Theatre was inti
mate compared to the venues
KISS is accustomed to playing.
During a recent tour of Bra/il.
the band played stadiums ot
140,000. Obviously, the
popularity that KISS now en
joys abroad is not one that it
retains in the United States.
What used to easily sell out the
Cow Palace now barely fills a
3000 seat theatre. Perhaps the
attention span of U.S. consu
mers to novelty bands is lim
ited.
This is a shame because KISS
is and always has been an un
compromising rock band.

Despite hits like "Rock and
Roll all Nite," "Beth." "New
York Groove," "1 was made for
Lovin' You. " and now "Lick it
Up." its song-writing abilities
have always been eclipsed by its
live show.
Wednesday night gave KISS
an opportunity (albeit some
what unplanned) to show its
true colors. Drawing on each
phase of its career, KISS played
only its best material: from
"Cold Gin" and " Fire house" to
the recent "Fits Like a Glove"
and "All Hell's Breakin' Loose"
(now apparently in video
form). Continually communi
cating with the audience, (at
one point an audience vote was
taken to determine the next
song), KISS was obviously en
joying itself.
Transforming its image from
a show band to serious rockers
has not been easy, and KISS has
fallen on its face several times,
but with its uncompromising
attitude and devotion to its
fans it will undoubtedly
succeed.
If the United States doesn't
"Lick it Up," then the rest of
the world will.

flooded the stage and evil
ululations filled the air. But
suddenly, what is this? Enter
the local fire marshal!. No
bombs, no fireworks and less
stage set, says he. Well, so be
it, and so it was. KISS with no
makeup and now without a
show. Their work was cut out
for them.
As it turned out, proving
that it could stand alongside
any band in the rock hierarchy
with or without a show was to
be the least of KISS' worries

that night.
Plagued by a muddy sound
mix for much of the show, a lot
of the singing was to be buried
under Gene Simmon's thunder
ing bass. In fact during his solo.
Gene threatened the sound
man twice with his axe-shaped
instrument, until finally the
sound level was not unlike put
ting your head inside a jet
engine at full throttle.
With subtlety cast by the
wayside, KISS thundered
through material from its 11-
year, 19-album career and
showed the audience what real
unadulterated rock and roll
with a vengeance was all about.
Opening with "Creatures of
the Night" and sliding right
into "Detroit Rock City,"
KISS performed like a band
possessed.
The band's shedding of the
elaborate costumes and make
up seemed to have released
previously untapped sources of
bedlam. Paul Stanley's com
mand of the audience was ab
solute. From his 'playing' of
the audience to his risque raps
before songs, his stamina
seemed unlimited.

Not to be outdone bv Stan
ley, relatively new bandmcm
bers Erie Carr (drums) and
Vinnie Vincent (lead guitar),
though lacking the supreme
showmanship of the two
founding members, were both
quite impressive. With Carr
pounding the skins atop his
Sherman tank turret and Vin
cent thrashing at his guitar
during one of the best (if not
longest) solos I've ever heard,
they firmly established their
place in the KISS lineup.
The setting of the Berkeley
Community Theatre was inti
mate compared to the venues
KISS is accustomed to playing.
During a recent tour of Bra/il.
the band played stadiums ot
140,000. Obviously, the
popularity that KISS now en
joys abroad is not one that it
retains in the United States.
What used to easily sell out the
Cow Palace now barely fills a
3000 seat theatre. Perhaps the
attention span of U.S. consu
mers to novelty bands is lim
ited.
This is a shame because KISS
is and always has been an un
compromising rock band.

Despite hits like "Rock and
Roll all Nite," "Beth." "New
York Groove," "1 was made for
Lovin' You. " and now "Lick it
Up." its song-writing abilities
have always been eclipsed by its
live show.
Wednesday night gave KISS
an opportunity (albeit some
what unplanned) to show its
true colors. Drawing on each
phase of its career, KISS played
only its best material: from
"Cold Gin" and " Fire house" to
the recent "Fits Like a Glove"
and "All Hell's Breakin' Loose"
(now apparently in video
form). Continually communi
cating with the audience, (at
one point an audience vote was
taken to determine the next
song), KISS was obviously en
joying itself.
Transforming its image from
a show band to serious rockers
has not been easy, and KISS has
fallen on its face several times,
but with its uncompromising
attitude and devotion to its
fans it will undoubtedly
succeed.
If the United States doesn't
"Lick it Up," then the rest of
the world will.

KISS: Metamorphosized for
the' Bos?
Being a fan of somewhat
frowned-upon bands has never
been easy and being a KISS fan
has certainly been no excep
tion. Hints of disapproval and
disdain appear as soon as a

friend flips through your
record collection and stares in
disbelief: "KISS ... do you
really like them??" Subsequent
visits to your room become in
frequent. and when they do oc
cur. it is not uncommon to find
your friend carrying a cross or
garlic cloves strung around his

or her neck lest too much of
Gene Simmons' vampire per
sona had rubbed off on you.
Well, last Wednesday KISS
broke most chains with the
past and again proved to its
fans what we knew all along:
KISS is one of the best hard
rock bands in the world.
Unfortunately, the evening
was not to be without its weak
points, namely the two opening
bands. KISS has spawned some
fine groups, including Sammy
Hagar and Cheap Trick, but
they blew it when they chose
Riot and Vandenberg as
openers.
Introduced as a "New York
City Gangster Rock" band,
Riot secured its position as a
third-rate heavy metal group
with a dull set of trudging rip
off rock. What can one do with
two competent but lackluster
guitarists (which unfortunate
ly meant two lackluster solos)
and a ridiculous lead singer
whose idea of showmanship was
to get on all fours and shake his
head up and down?
The second band, Vanden
berg, promised to be more in
teresting. Hailing from

Holland, its set began with the
lowering of a fancy mural, an
operatic track and spacey light
ing. Regrettably, the band
should have left it at that.
An excruciatingly boring
group on stage, its saving grace
was only the hilarity of the
lead singer. The diminutive
singer's conception of getting
the crowd going was to leave
his microphone by the drum
kit, run to the front of the
stage, extend his arms, retract
them, and then scurr\ back to
the safety of the pounding
drums.
After a short break, the
house lights dimmed, ice fog
flooded the stage and evil
ululations filled the air. But
suddenly, what is this? Enter
the local fire marshal!. No
bombs, no fireworks and less
stage set, says he. Well, so be
it, and so it was. KISS with no
