# The 						tale of Hale: Pebble Beach miracle was well-deserved
## 
### 
Pebble Beach — The moral of the story
at this weekend's 43rd Annual Bing Crosby
National Pro-Am Golf Tournament is
short and sweet. Honesty pays.
And for Hale Irwin, who won the 72-hole
event in a sudden-death playoff over Jim
Nelford. it paid $72,000 — nearly $30,000
more than the second-place prize money.
Irwin was given a second life in the
tournament thanks to a little bit of luck.
Just months earlier. Irwin lost a tourna
ment alter he called himself for a penalty
stroke. Honest Irwin was long overdue and
the gods of golf knew it.
Once the celestial lords of the links had
bailed Hale out, Irwin let skill take over
and proceeded to win the Crosby. "Freak
shot ties it, great one wins it," screamed a
San Francisco Chronicle headline the next
da\. The "great shot" was a 2-iron out of
the sand of the second hole of sudden
death, a story in itself. But it was the
"freak shot" that made waves at Pebble
Beach.
Irwin, plaung in the final foursome of
J.iv, sf<ii'd on the ffndJ fee of the
final hole of the tournament — Pebble
Beach's famed ISth. the picturesque hole
that uses the Pacific Ocean as out-of
bounds left.
Nearh 600 \ards away in the clubhouse
stood Nelford. a Canadian who is a righty

when he swings a club and a lefty when he
putts with one. Nelford had just com
pleted a near-perfect round on Pebble, a
sterling 4-under-par 6N to give him a four
round total of 275. 10-under par.
Irwin, meanwhile, had dropped a stroke
on the da\ and was at 9-under when he
stood alone at the INth tee. the ocean
breeze blowing his brown hair and the ocean
spra\ fogging his wire-rimmed glasses. Irwin
needed a hirdie to tie. A routine par-5 on

On the Mark
Mark Zeigler

the hole would do him no good.
Known more for his consistent play than
his shot-making ability, Irwin was forced
into a sticky, and possibly wet. situation.
To go for a birdie, he needed a big tee shot.
On Pebble's 18th, a golfer can cut corners
b\ sending his tee shot over the Pacific
Ocean to the fairway on the dogleg left
hole. If the shot is not hit well, what hap
pens next is no mystery. Golf balls don't
float.
"I normally aim my tee shot on 18 to the
right of the tree (in the middle of the fair
way)," Irwin explained later, "but I knew I

had to birdie to tie so I aimed at the tree
with a low hook.
"All golfers know what can happen at a
time like that. I tried to hit it too hard and
sent the ball hooking to the left. It was
cooking. I won't tell you what I said as I
watched it heading for the rocks," Irwin
said.
I he ball hooked and cooked to the left
all right. In tact, it momentarily disappeared
below the level of the fairway. Irwin
dropped his driver onto the ground and
then his head into his hands.
"I've seen 300 — well, maybe 30 — balls
go in where mine did," Irwin said later,
"and I never saw one come out."
I his time he saw one come out.
The miracle complete, Irwin took advan
tage ot his excellent position on the fair
way and hit a 3-wood to within 81 yards of
the pin. But Irwin wasn't through hitting
things yet.
His next shot, with a sand wedge,
bounced on the green once, glanced off the
llagstick and stopped five feet from the
hole. One five-foot putt later and Irwin
had his birdie and the overflow gallery at
Pebble its sudden-death playoff.
"The entire tournament revolved around
the break 1 got at 18," Irwin explained.
"Very obviously it turned the entire
outcome around. Instead of finishing

maybe fourth or fifth (had his ball gone
swimming), it gave me another chance to
win."
Two holes later at 16, the second
sudden-death hole. Irwin did just that, lie
won. But this time Lady Luck wasn't by his
side.
After hitting what he called "the worst
tee shot of my life" into a fariway trap
200-plus yards from the pin. Irwin "hit the
best 2-iron of my life" nine feet from the
hole. Nelford missed a 16-foot birdie putt,
setting up Irwin's Crosby-winning nine
footer just seconds later.
"I don't think there were a lot of breaks
on my part," a disappointed Nelford said.
"But give credit to Hale. I'm sure things
like that have gone against him in the
past."
Indeed, things like that had gone against
him before last Sunday. Actually, Irwin has
been a victim of more than his share of
things like that, which made the end and
especially the means in his Crosby win even
sweeter.
For starters, Irwin lost tTieiCrosby three
years ago to John Cook in a playoff. And in
1979, at the Memorial Tournament, he lost
by a stroke to Roger Maltbie in a similar
fashion to the way he won Sunday.
Ahead by a shot on the final hole,
Maltbie sent his approach shot over the

green. But the ball hit a gallery stake and
bounced back onto the green. Maltbie
saved par and took home the first-place
purse.
However, it was the way he finished
second at last summer's British Open that
topped them all.
In the third round of the tournament,
Irwin knocked a long putt just inches from
the hole. When he went to routinely back
hand the ball into the cup with his putter,
Irwin whiffed. In golf that is a stroke, con
tact or no contact with the ball.
Few noticed Hale's mishap and after he
tapped in the ball, he could have easily
hushed up and played innocent. But being
the honest man and true competitor lie is.
Irwin called himself on the whiff and ac
cepted the penalty stroke. Irwin, who has
won two U.S. Opens, lost the British Open
by a single stroke.
As agonizing a loss it was, Irwin took it in
stride. The gods of golf were watching,
waiting for the next time Irwin was in
trouble and needed their help.
It was like he was given a "get out of jail
free" card. Or, in the case of the Crosby, a
"get out of the rocks on the 18th free"
card.
And on Sunday, Irwin cashed in.
Honestly.

things like that, which made the end and
especially the means in his Crosby win even
sweeter.
For starters, Irwin lost tTieiCrosby three
years ago to John Cook in a playoff. And in
1979, at the Memorial Tournament, he lost
by a stroke to Roger Maltbie in a similar
fashion to the way he won Sunday.
Ahead by a shot on the final hole,
Maltbie sent his approach shot over the

green. But the ball hit a gallery stake and
bounced back onto the green. Maltbie
saved par and took home the first-place
purse.
However, it was the way he finished
second at last summer's British Open that
topped them all.
In the third round of the tournament,
Irwin knocked a long putt just inches from
the hole. When he went to routinely back
hand the ball into the cup with his putter,
Irwin whiffed. In golf that is a stroke, con
tact or no contact with the ball.
Few noticed Hale's mishap and after he
tapped in the ball, he could have easily
hushed up and played innocent. But being
the honest man and true competitor lie is.
Irwin called himself on the whiff and ac
cepted the penalty stroke. Irwin, who has
won two U.S. Opens, lost the British Open
by a single stroke.
As agonizing a loss it was, Irwin took it in
stride. The gods of golf were watching,
waiting for the next time Irwin was in
trouble and needed their help.
It was like he was given a "get out of jail
free" card. Or, in the case of the Crosby, a
"get out of the rocks on the 18th free"
card.
And on Sunday, Irwin cashed in.
Honestly.
Pebble Beach — The moral of the story
at this weekend's 43rd Annual Bing Crosby
National Pro-Am Golf Tournament is
short and sweet. Honesty pays.
And for Hale Irwin, who won the 72-hole
event in a sudden-death playoff over Jim
Nelford. it paid $72,000 — nearly $30,000
more than the second-place prize money.
Irwin was given a second life in the
tournament thanks to a little bit of luck.
Just months earlier. Irwin lost a tourna
ment alter he called himself for a penalty
stroke. Honest Irwin was long overdue and
the gods of golf knew it.
Once the celestial lords of the links had
bailed Hale out, Irwin let skill take over
and proceeded to win the Crosby. "Freak
shot ties it, great one wins it," screamed a
San Francisco Chronicle headline the next
da\. The "great shot" was a 2-iron out of
the sand of the second hole of sudden
death, a story in itself. But it was the
"freak shot" that made waves at Pebble
Beach.
Irwin, plaung in the final foursome of
J.iv, sf<ii'd on the ffndJ fee of the
final hole of the tournament — Pebble
Beach's famed ISth. the picturesque hole
that uses the Pacific Ocean as out-of
bounds left.
Nearh 600 \ards away in the clubhouse
stood Nelford. a Canadian who is a righty

when he swings a club and a lefty when he
putts with one. Nelford had just com
pleted a near-perfect round on Pebble, a
sterling 4-under-par 6N to give him a four
round total of 275. 10-under par.
Irwin, meanwhile, had dropped a stroke
on the da\ and was at 9-under when he
stood alone at the INth tee. the ocean
breeze blowing his brown hair and the ocean
spra\ fogging his wire-rimmed glasses. Irwin
needed a hirdie to tie. A routine par-5 on

Mark Zeigler

the hole would do him no good.
Known more for his consistent play than
his shot-making ability, Irwin was forced
into a sticky, and possibly wet. situation.
To go for a birdie, he needed a big tee shot.
On Pebble's 18th, a golfer can cut corners
b\ sending his tee shot over the Pacific
Ocean to the fairway on the dogleg left
hole. If the shot is not hit well, what hap
pens next is no mystery. Golf balls don't
float.
"I normally aim my tee shot on 18 to the
right of the tree (in the middle of the fair
way)," Irwin explained later, "but I knew I

had to birdie to tie so I aimed at the tree
with a low hook.
"All golfers know what can happen at a
time like that. I tried to hit it too hard and
sent the ball hooking to the left. It was
cooking. I won't tell you what I said as I
watched it heading for the rocks," Irwin
said.
I he ball hooked and cooked to the left
all right. In tact, it momentarily disappeared
below the level of the fairway. Irwin
dropped his driver onto the ground and
then his head into his hands.
"I've seen 300 — well, maybe 30 — balls
go in where mine did," Irwin said later,
"and I never saw one come out."
I his time he saw one come out.
The miracle complete, Irwin took advan
tage ot his excellent position on the fair
way and hit a 3-wood to within 81 yards of
the pin. But Irwin wasn't through hitting
things yet.
His next shot, with a sand wedge,
bounced on the green once, glanced off the
llagstick and stopped five feet from the
hole. One five-foot putt later and Irwin
had his birdie and the overflow gallery at
Pebble its sudden-death playoff.
"The entire tournament revolved around
the break 1 got at 18," Irwin explained.
"Very obviously it turned the entire
outcome around. Instead of finishing

maybe fourth or fifth (had his ball gone
swimming), it gave me another chance to
win."
Two holes later at 16, the second
sudden-death hole. Irwin did just that, lie
won. But this time Lady Luck wasn't by his
side.
After hitting what he called "the worst
tee shot of my life" into a fariway trap
200-plus yards from the pin. Irwin "hit the
best 2-iron of my life" nine feet from the
hole. Nelford missed a 16-foot birdie putt,
setting up Irwin's Crosby-winning nine
footer just seconds later.
"I don't think there were a lot of breaks
on my part," a disappointed Nelford said.
"But give credit to Hale. I'm sure things
like that have gone against him in the
past."
Indeed, things like that had gone against
him before last Sunday. Actually, Irwin has
been a victim of more than his share of
