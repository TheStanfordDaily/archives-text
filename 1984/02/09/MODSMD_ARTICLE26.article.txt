### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
wllircc All-Americans head a
list dI high school athletes who
yesterday signed letters of in
tent to play football at Stan
ford
HMDespite working with an
incomplete coaching staff and
limited time because of his late
hiring, Stanford Football
Coach Jack Elway appears to
have recruited one of the best
group of players to attend
Stanford in recent years.
BXmong the top recruits arc
All-America offensive lineman
Andrew Sinclair, tight end Eric
Snelson and wide receiver Ken
Richardson.
■'It's a great class," Elway
said yesterday morning. "1
could go over each one of these
players one by one. It's a great
flplented group of people who
Save competed in the class
room and on the football
field."
fy.This year's football recruits
include nine offensive linemen
and six defensive backs. Elway
is excited about the
potential for the offensive
line, "I feel that in two to
three years it could be the best
offensive line in the nation,"
Elway said.
Sinclair, a 6-foot-4, 240-
pound offensive lineman from
Edison High School in Hunting
ton Beach, appears to be the
prize plumb of an impressive
group of line prospects. He was
chosen for the USA Today and
Parade All-America teams and

was also a Best of the West se
lection.
Other top linemen include
Jeffery Marchin, a 6-4, 230-
pounder from San Pedro who
was a first team All-Los An
geles Times and first team All-
CIF selection and offensive
tackle Robbie Coffin, a 6-5,
235-pounder from Mint Mesa
high school in San Diego who
was the CIF player of the year.
Coffin runs the 40-yard dash in
4.9 seconds and was the Na
tional Leadership Foundation
scholar of the year. Blue Chip
Magazine said Coffin could be
"perhaps the best lineman in
the state — very quick and
very mobile."
Stanford's other two All -
Americans will be on the re
ceiving end of the football and,
according to Flway, could make
immediate contributions.
Snelson, a 6-foot-3, 240-
pound tight end from Antioch,
made the Parade and Bally's
All-America teams as well as
the USA Today All-State
team. "Snelson is equal to or
the best tight end in the
country," Elway said. "He was
on his team's 440 relay team in
high school."
At San Jose State, Elway
had an All-PCAA wide receiver
named Eric Richardson and he
seems to still like that name.
Receiver Ken Richardson, who
is among three Richardson's
signed by Stanford, was a USA
Today All-American and made
the AP Super Team. The 3-1 1,

158-pound receiver hails from
Central High School in Little
Rock, Ark. A Street and Smith
preseason All-American, Rich
ardson made the Elite 1 I
chosen from among the top
players in the Southwest Con
ference — and also was his class
president.
Stanford will also be getting
some help in the defensive
backfield with the signing of
Bradley Humphreys, a 6-3,
190-pound defensive back
from Saratoga High School

who was an All-State selection
and preseason All-American,
and Carl Morris, a 5-9, 170-
pound receiver and defensive
back from Lebanon Union
High School in Oregon, who
was an All-State selection
both on offense and defense.
Punter Doug Robison, from
Putnam City High School in
Oklahoma, also signed with
Stanford and, according to El
way, he is the nation's top
punter. Robison averaged 45
yards a punt in high school.
