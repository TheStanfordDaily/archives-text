What consists of roughly
I; 50 members, drives about
nine hours every weekend
and puts a collective effort
into racing to the bottom
of a white, powder-covered
mountain while trying to
beat nine other schools out
of first place? Hint: It
belongs to the Northern
California Division of the
National Collegiate Ski As
sociation. Answer: You
guessed it, the Stanford ski
team.
| "Although the ski team is
J classified as a club sport and
it is student-run, the team's
attitude is the same as if it
were a varsity sport," said
Todd Watson, the team's
captain.
The team goes up to
Tahoe every weekend to
compete in an invitational
race with nine other schools
in the Northern California
Division. Berkeley, San Jose
t State, UC-Davis and Sierra
| College are just a few of the
j team's division rivals.
"Sure we have a lot of fun
skiini> together every

weekend, but there is a lot
of hard work involved and
we take it very seriously,"
Watson said. He stressed,
too. that "the members of
the team are trying hard to
change their image from
being just a "group of skiers'
to what they are: a serious
team competing in a very

serious league".
The men's team is
"approximately in fourth
place" in the league, accor
ding to Watson, but the wo
men's team is currently in
second place with an outside
chance of qualifying for the
National Championships.
Cal is presently holding the

number one spot.
The first place team,
which will be determined
only two weeks from now,
will go to Steamboat
Springs, Colorado to com
pete in the National Cham
pionships March 19-21.
"We want it (first place)
more than Cal does, or
anyone else for that mat
ter," said Linda Waldcn, a
junior in one of the top five
positions on the women's
squad.
Liz Atkinson, a freshman
from Colorado, races the
number one position on the
women's team.
Originally, Atkinson was
not going to ski for Stan
ford, "but the people are so
great," she said, "that I
changed my mind. I also
realized that I couldn't get
racing out of my system.
It's too addicting, and fur
thermore, it's a great
escape. You spend your
whole week trying to catch
up in your studies just too
fall totally behind again
each weekend, but it's
worth it."
