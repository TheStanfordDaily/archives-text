# Columnist predicts Reagan win

### KAREN BOLLERMANN Staff writer 
San Francisco — President Reagan
will probably be re-elected in 19N4
because of his personal charisma,
even though many Americans do not
agree with his policies, predicted poli
tical columnist Tom Wicker in a
speech for the Commonwealth Club
at the Sheraton Palace Hotel yester
day.
"The American people want a
strong president who has an image of
direction, whether or not they agree
with the direction," said Wicker, who
said Reagan fulfills those needs.
Wicker, an associate editor and
columnist for The New York Times,
projected that Reagan will face
former Vice President Walter
Mondale in the November election.
"Reagan is a master of TV. Should
there be a debate between Reagan
and Mondale. Reagan will be the first
incumbent to win a televised
debate." Wicker told the audience of
approximately 250.
Wicker also compared the year
1 9<S4 with George Orwell's novel,
"1984," saying that the novel
"should be read as a warning."
"There are certain trends we need
to think more seriously about," he
said. Three major similarities that
Wicker sees between calendar 19N4
and Orwellian 19X4 lie in the areas of
technical advances, "newspeak," or
language distortion, and the grow ing
"national security mystique."
Technical advances and the depen
dencies they create are a pervasive

torce 111 our society, he said. Wicker
noted that computers, which are the
common denominator of technology,
control all of America's deployed nu
clear missiles. Informing Americans
about the danger of over
dependency on machines is one of
Wicker's goals.
Another Orwellian aspect of soci
ety that adds to the public's confu
sion is "newspeak." he said.
"Newspeak makes people believe
repression is security. Newspeak is
when President Reagan refers to the
MX missile as a 'peacekeeper,' or
when the invasion of Grenada is
referred to as a 'rescue mission," " ac
cording to Wicker. Lie detectors,
which measure stress, are another
form of newspeak. Wicker said.
Yet, the most insidious and uncon
trollable Orwellian feature prevalent
today is the national security mys
tique, he said.
The national security mystique
"occurs when issues of national se
curity supersede one's personal
liberties," he said. An instance of
this occurred when press members
were forbidden from covering the in
vasion of Grenada. Another example
is the Reagan administration pro
posal requiring mandatory lifetime
censorship for all government offi
cials.
"The most threatening element of
the national security mystique," said
Wicker, "is when our leaders know
much more about issues than the
people do." He cited U.S.-Soviet re
lations, U.S. involvement in Lebanon

and Central America and U.S.
federal budget deficits as examples
of such issues.
With U.S.-Soviet relations at then
most hostile since the Cuban
missile crisis and the United States
considering extending the arms race
into space, Wicker said he feels th.it
it is necessary that the American
people fully understand the possible
consequences of current U.S. foreign
policy.
Wicker classified current foreign
policy as "highly militaristic."
"In Nicaragua, we are supporting ;i
10,000-man army to overthrow the
government and in El Salvador we are
helping to prevent an insurgency
against the government in order to
insure democracy in the Western
Hemisphere," Wicker said.
These actions should. Wicker feels,
raise questions that the American
people haven't thought about, such
as, "Is it true that any Marxist state
in the Western Hemisphere, except
ing Cuba, is a threat to the United
States? And if such a state can't be
tolerated, does it follow that we
must use force to prevent the devel
opment of such a state?"
Wicker answered. "No, the ul
timate power of the U.S. should lie
in its reputation as protector of
smaller countries and respecter ol
the law."
Concerning the federal budget
deficit. Wicker said. "The American
people have not focused on this
problem. It's much like having a cred
it card — you think it's no problem
until the bill is due."
