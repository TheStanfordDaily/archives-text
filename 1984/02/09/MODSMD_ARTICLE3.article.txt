# Students vie for lecture note buck

In another case of private enterprise infiltrating gov
ernment services, two Stanford undergraduates have
founded a private lecture note service which may com
pote with ASSU Lecture Notes.
"We saw a note service as something we could turn our
talents to," said Peter Dumanian, a junior majoring in
English and co-founder of the Superior Lecture Note Ser
vice.
Dumanian and his partner, junior Eric Gilbert, an eco
nomics major, began the service mainly as a business
venture to gain some practical experience. "Profit is not
the primary motive." Gilbert said. "We're really after
the experience."
Still. Gilbert stressed that they "have managed to
beat the ASSU by a buck." meaning that the subscrip
tion rate for their service is a dollar less than that of the
ASSU's for all classes except one. in which case it is a
$1.50 less.
However, the only class in which the services actually
compete against one another is Economics 150. and nei
ther Dumanian, Gilbert, nor current ASSU l ecture
Note Service Manager Hubert Cheng said he knows
which service has more subscribers.
"I really don't want to make this a competition-type
thing." said Cheng. The services cover mostly different

classes, but, he added, the new note service has "given
the ASSU a lot to think about."
One thing the ASSU has to think about is exclusive
contracts used by Superior to ensure exclusive rights to
the lecture material. Superior was able to obtain exclu
sive contract rights to five of the six classes that the
service covers, something that the ASSU did not know
until the professors told it.
Cheng said the exclusive contracts have caused a prob
lem lor the ASSU and that, because the lecture note
service is "a major source of funding for the ASSU, if
there's a potentiality of it (Superior Lecture Note Ser
vice) continuing next quarter or next year, we will have
to resort to contracts."
Gilbert said he and Dumanian felt the need for exclu
sive contracts because they "weren't sure how the
ASSU would respond to a new lecture service." He said
the ASSU could retaliate by reducing the price of its
subscription rates or by covering the same classes as Su
perior.
Dumanian also said the exclusive contracts make more
business sense. "If you don't have any competition, it's a
lot easier." he said.
One thing that the students did not have an easy time
doing was getting started. l ast quarter they were in-

The Superior Lecture Note Service is giving the ASSU a run for its money — literally. Students gather in
White Plaza to see just what the competition's like.
