# Bell Labs to boost research ties here
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Staff writer 
Bell Labs has announced that it
hopes to strengthen its ties with top
research universities, an effort that
would benefit both Stanford and
Bell, according to Prof. Robert
White, chairman of the University's
Department of Electrical Engineer
ing.
The University has received about
$3.7 million from Bell in the past
five years.
Grants from Bell have helped
greatly to fund the department's
computer system, most notably com
puter maintenance, an area 'the Uni
versity funds insufficiently. White
said. The University has also used the
money to purchase computers and
computer peripheral terminals, he
said.
Bell funding has also paid a part of
faculty salaries. White said. "We run
a deficit each year."
White said Bell and Stanford con
duct research in many of the same
areas, including telecommunications,
speech processing, optic fibers and
optic fiber lasers.
White said Bell benefits from its
ties with the University because
"they thrive on educated, trained
people. Stanford is in the business of
producing educated, trained people."
Bell and IBM are currently the
leading employers of Stanford's elec
trical engineering graduates. The
University has the largest advanced

electrical engineering degree program
nationally, with 677 graduate stu
dents in the field.
Bell has already taken steps
toward solidifying its relationship
with Stanford, according to Kumar
Patel, executive director for research
in Bell's physics division.
Patel told the Stanford University
News Service that Bell has targeted
support for four Ph.D. students at
Stanford, who will each receive
nearly $20,000 annually for four
years. Individual executives at Bell
have been assigned to serve as liaisons
with selected campuses, including
Stanford, and Bell is encouraging
professors here to spend sabbaticals
at the company, Patel said.
White added that "visiting
scholars (from Bell) are invited by
specific faculty members to spend
(sabbaticals) here . . . We've had
about one a year."
Although the University
cooperates closely with industry.
White said he does not fear that the
doctoral program is a service station
for graduate students' short-term
needs.
The time schedule of the Ph.D.
program is long enough — normally
four years — that students will not
use it in this manner. White said. He
said applicants with industrial finan
cial support are given no special
privileges when considered by the ad
missions board.
