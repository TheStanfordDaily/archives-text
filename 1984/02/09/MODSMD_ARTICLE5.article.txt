# Author Kesey returns to the Stanford nest
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Old pranksters never fade; they
just become deified.
Author Ken Kesey. certainly an old
prankster, read last night in Kresge
Auditorium to an over-capacity
crowd of worshipping old friends and
young groupies.
Some ot the audience probably
only knew Kesey as the award
winning author of "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest." But judging
from the reactions of the audience,
most knew him in his more infamous
capacity — ringleader of The Merry
Pranksters, a band of acid heads that
traveled from east to west and back

again in a psychedelic school bus and
were immortalized in Tom Wolfe's
novel. "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid
Test."
Kesey hardly looked like a 60s relic
— dressed in a white suit, white tie
and Panama hat. he seemed more like
a portly Irishman at a resort hotel.
Hut his manner ot speaking was
definitely Keseyan: "I'd like to take
oil this hat and pass it around." he
told the audience, sweeping his hat
olt of his head.
"You see. it's made of hemp . . .
My suit is made of hemp too. I'm
trying to convince people to legalize
hemp. You have to realize that the
lirst state to legalize hemp will get

its budget turned around real quick,"
Kesey said.
Kesey was at Stanford from 1959
until 1964 — for two years as a
Wallace Stegner Fellow and for two
years, as he put it, "just hanging
around." While enrolled as a Stegner
Fellow, lie joined other students in
participating in medical research that
was being performed at Menlo Park
Hospital — experimentation with
drugs such as psylocybin and LSD.
"I was paid $20 a day like all the
other students," he said. "These
were some big-funded experiments;
we were tested completely before
and after we took each drug, blood

and urine aests and EEGs and brain
scans.
"One thing you have to realize."
Kesev said, "is that the results of all
those tests must be sitting around
somewhere. If they think this stuff
damages the brain, they should call us
all back and find out."
Kesey said he was an active, though
not especially prominent, figure
while at Stanford. He said he remem
bers participating in Gaieties and
doing other acting.
"I wasn't too well known here," he
said. "Wallace Stegner once called me
an anti-intellectual — I told him I
was just an ignoramus." At the time
lie was here. Kesey said. Stanford was
the center of both the drug move
ment and the writing movement in
America. "Stegner was able to at
tract really crack teachers here." he
said. "It wouldn't be amiss to com
pare our training with that of a pro
football team."
Kesey and his cronies lived on Perry
I.ane, a graduate student housing
complex dismantled during the early
(ids. Soon after Perry Lane was torn
down, Kesey's association with Stan
ford ended and his affiliation with
the Merry Pranksters began.
However, Kesey did return to
Stanford several times during the
'60s. After Stanford took a position
formally disapproving of the public
use of LSI) a symposium on the drug
was held in Tresidder Union, with
notable speakers including Timothy
l.eary. According to a News and
Publications memorandum dating
from that time, Kesey and his fol

lowers staged a "happening" at the
symposium.
"As 1 remember, we just sort of
hung out there." Kesey saici. "We
parked the Ims out in front of
Dink."

Kesey's prankster days are over.
I he psychedelic school bus became a
plaything for his sons, and they even
tually abandoned it in a field on his

Oregon farm. But the pranksters
remain close — according to Kesey,
many of them, including Mountain
Girl, now live on neighboring farms.
And Kesey remembers the old days
fondly: he gl;ull> signed copy after
copy of Wolfe's book — admitting
he was signing with Wolfe's name in
stead of his own — and spoke
glowingly of the author.
"I must admit I haven't read the
book since the galleys, he said, "but
Tom Wolfe is a helluva writer."
During his reading. Kesey gave the
audience what it asked tor
reminiscences about his past and par
ticularly about Neal Cassady. a Beat
generation hero who was immor
talized as Dean Moriarty in Jack
Kerouac's "On The Road."
The first story Kesey read last
night. "The Day Superman Died,'
was an autobiographical account of
his feelings about Cassady's death in
1969.
In addition to relating memories
of his Merry Pranskter years, Kesey
delved even farther back and read an
adaptation of a story told to him by
his grandmother. "Little Tricky
Squirrel and Big Double Bear.''

until 1964 — for two years as a
Wallace Stegner Fellow and for two
years, as he put it, "just hanging
around." While enrolled as a Stegner
Fellow, lie joined other students in
participating in medical research that
was being performed at Menlo Park
Hospital — experimentation with
drugs such as psylocybin and LSD.
"I was paid $20 a day like all the
other students," he said. "These
were some big-funded experiments;
we were tested completely before
and after we took each drug, blood

and urine aests and EEGs and brain
scans.
"One thing you have to realize."
Kesev said, "is that the results of all
those tests must be sitting around
somewhere. If they think this stuff
damages the brain, they should call us
all back and find out."
Kesey said he was an active, though
not especially prominent, figure
while at Stanford. He said he remem
bers participating in Gaieties and
doing other acting.
"I wasn't too well known here," he
said. "Wallace Stegner once called me
an anti-intellectual — I told him I
was just an ignoramus." At the time
lie was here. Kesey said. Stanford was
the center of both the drug move
ment and the writing movement in
America. "Stegner was able to at
tract really crack teachers here." he
said. "It wouldn't be amiss to com
pare our training with that of a pro
football team."
Kesey and his cronies lived on Perry
I.ane, a graduate student housing
complex dismantled during the early
(ids. Soon after Perry Lane was torn
down, Kesey's association with Stan
ford ended and his affiliation with
the Merry Pranksters began.
However, Kesey did return to
Stanford several times during the
'60s. After Stanford took a position
formally disapproving of the public
use of LSI) a symposium on the drug
was held in Tresidder Union, with
notable speakers including Timothy
l.eary. According to a News and
Publications memorandum dating
from that time, Kesey and his fol

lowers staged a "happening" at the
symposium.
"As 1 remember, we just sort of
hung out there." Kesey saici. "We
parked the Ims out in front of
Dink."

Kesey's prankster days are over.
I he psychedelic school bus became a
plaything for his sons, and they even
tually abandoned it in a field on his

Oregon farm. But the pranksters
remain close — according to Kesey,
many of them, including Mountain
Girl, now live on neighboring farms.
And Kesey remembers the old days
fondly: he gl;ull> signed copy after
copy of Wolfe's book — admitting
he was signing with Wolfe's name in
stead of his own — and spoke
glowingly of the author.
"I must admit I haven't read the
book since the galleys, he said, "but
Tom Wolfe is a helluva writer."
During his reading. Kesey gave the
audience what it asked tor
reminiscences about his past and par
ticularly about Neal Cassady. a Beat
generation hero who was immor
talized as Dean Moriarty in Jack
Kerouac's "On The Road."
The first story Kesey read last
night. "The Day Superman Died,'
was an autobiographical account of
his feelings about Cassady's death in
1969.
In addition to relating memories
of his Merry Pranskter years, Kesey
delved even farther back and read an
adaptation of a story told to him by
his grandmother. "Little Tricky
Squirrel and Big Double Bear.''
