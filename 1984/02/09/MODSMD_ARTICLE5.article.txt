Old pranksters never fade; they
just become deified.
Author Ken Kesey. certainly an old
prankster, read last night in Kresge
Auditorium to an over-capacity
crowd of worshipping old friends and
young groupies.
Some ot the audience probably
only knew Kesey as the award
winning author of "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest." But judging
from the reactions of the audience,
most knew him in his more infamous
capacity — ringleader of The Merry
Pranksters, a band of acid heads that
traveled from east to west and back

again in a psychedelic school bus and
were immortalized in Tom Wolfe's
novel. "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid
Test."
Kesey hardly looked like a 60s relic
— dressed in a white suit, white tie
and Panama hat. he seemed more like
a portly Irishman at a resort hotel.
Hut his manner ot speaking was
definitely Keseyan: "I'd like to take
oil this hat and pass it around." he
told the audience, sweeping his hat
olt of his head.
"You see. it's made of hemp . . .
My suit is made of hemp too. I'm
trying to convince people to legalize

Kesey said.
Kesey was at Stanford from 1959
until 1964 — for two years as a
Wallace Stegner Fellow and for two
years, as he put it, "just hanging
around." While enrolled as a Stegner
Fellow, lie joined other students in
participating in medical research that
was being performed at Menlo Park
Hospital — experimentation with
drugs such as psylocybin and LSD.
"I was paid $20 a day like all the
other students," he said. "These
were some big-funded experiments;
we were tested completely before
and after we took each drug, blood

and urine aests and EEGs and brain
scans.
"One thing you have to realize."
Kesev said, "is that the results of all
those tests must be sitting around
somewhere. If they think this stuff
damages the brain, they should call us
all back and find out."
Kesey said he was an active, though
not especially prominent, figure
while at Stanford. He said he remem
bers participating in Gaieties and
doing other acting.
"I wasn't too well known here," he
said. "Wallace Stegner once called me
an anti-intellectual — I told him I
