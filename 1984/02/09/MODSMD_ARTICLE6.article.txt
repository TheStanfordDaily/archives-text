British withdraw from Beirut
I>ondon — Britain withdrew its small peacekeeping con
tingent from Beirut yesterday and Italy indicated that it
would follow suit soon. In France, officials said the French
force in Lebanon will be kept there until it can be replaced
by United Nations troops.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced
that the 115 British troops had been evacuated and flown
to a British ship off the coast. "I am very relieved they are
out of Beirut," Thatcher said.
At about the same time, Italian Defense Minister
Giovanni Spadolini told the Senate in Rome that his gov
ernment intends to withdraw its contingent but only after
ensuring the safety of the Palestinians who live in the Ital
ian sector.
In Paris, after a regular meeting of the French Cabinet
with President Francois Mitterrand, government spokesman
Max Gallo said France hoped that the U.N. Security Coun
cil will meet soon to arrange to send in troops to replace the
multinational peacekeeping force. He said Foreign Minister
Claude Cheysson. in contacts with both the Soviet Union
and the United States, has been trying for several months
to arrange such a meeting.
I he announcements in London. Paris and Rome came
after President Reagan's surprise announcement Tuesday
that the United States would initiate a "staged
withdrawal" of the 1450 Marines at the international air
port just south of Beirut.
Andropov's illness may affect
speech and appearance
Moscow — Reports circulating within the Communist
Party bureaucracy here suggest that Soviet President Yuri
Andropov may suffer from an ailment that affects his ap
pearance and ability to talk.
These reports, officially unconfirmed like much else
about the 69-year-old Soviet leader's long illness, would
help explain why he has now been out of public view for 173
days, an extraordinary length of time for a society that has
a long tradition of strong personal leadership.
Soviet officials, while finally conceding that Andropov
has been seriously ill, now say for the public record that he is
recovering successfully and will reappear soon.
Yet, behind these optimistic official accounts, other
reports persist. According to one, Andropov's health has
deteriorated, temporarily affecting his ability to speak.
Another claims that Andropov has an illness known as pro
gressive spinal muscular atrophy, a mild variant of Lou Geh
rig's disease that can be crippling, although sometimes not
fatal for 25 years.
Israel: Lebanon is a lost cause
Jerusalem — Israel virtually abandoned its hope of turn
ing Lebanon into a strong and friendly neighbor yesterday,
conceding that it could do nothing to save the crumbling
regime of Lebanese President Amin Gemayel.
In a day of crisis meetings, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir presided over an emergency session of his Cabinet
and Foreign Ministry officials conferred with U.S. ambassa
dor Samuel Lewis. No action was announced.
Israeli officials said they now expect Gemayel to make
the best deal he can with the Syrians, almost surely scrap
ping the troop withdrawal and security pact that Lebanon
and Israel signed last May 17 following the personal media
tion of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
Such an outcome would cancel all of the political gains
that Israel had hoped to obtain as a result of its military
victories over the Syrian army and the Palestinian Libera
tion Organization in the summer of 1982.
Israel's state-owned radio network reported that mem
bers of the Cabinet said following the meeting that Israel
probably would have to go it alone in defending the security
of its northern border, meaning that Israeli troops would be
kept in southern Lebanon for the foreseeable future. Ear
lier, the Jerusalem government had hoped to turn over to a
strengthened Lebanese army the security situation in
southern Lebanon.
Shuttle readies for space walk
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — Two Challenger astronauts
refueled their backpacks yesterday for an encore venture
into open space, while officials on the ground worried that
rain and clouds might prevent the first Florida shuttle lan
ding on Saturday.
Mission control told the crew that "you're the talk of
the world" after the spectacular excursion that Bruce
McCandless and Robert Stewart made into space Tuesday
with no rope to anchor them to the shuttle.
McCandless and Steward are scheduled for a second walk
beginning at 6 a.m. EST today, but their three fellow
astronauts joked they might fight for the change "to share
all the good deals."
President Reagan will telephone the astronauts at 10:25
a.m. today from his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif., dep
uty White House press secretary Larry Speakes said.
Speakes said McCandless and Stewart "will be outside their
spacecraft" when they receive their call.
Commander Vance Brand reported that everyone on the
shuttle "is feeling on top of the world."
U.S. to run Honduran missions
Washington — The Pentagon yesterday announced that it
will conduct air "reconnaissance missions" from Honduras
during the next few months, although the major military
exercise known as Big Pine II officially ended yesterday.
The reconnaissance flights with small OV-1 observation
planes and possibly other aircraft, along with other military
missions, will place as many as 1700 U.S. troops in Honduras
before another set of military maneuvers, Granadero 1,
begins next summer. Last week Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger testified before Congress that about 700 to
800 troops would remain in Honduras after Big Pine 11.
Several members of Congress have accused the Defense
Department of establishing a semi-permanent military
presence in the strategically located Central American
country without the approval of Congress, which normally
must vote on military construction and the establishment
of foreign bases. p
Weinberger said there is no intention of establishing a
permanent presence. He also said the air strips, housing,
radar sites and other facilities constructed during the past
seven months were only for the exercises.
Dow Jones shows steep slide
New York — Wall Street rolled up a $27 billion loss yes
terday as warnings of recession in Washington and Mideast
strife combined to touch off the steepest slide in the Dow
Jones industrials in more than 15 months.
The decline erased early gains and worsened late in the
session, but trading volume on the New York Stock Ex
change slipped below 100 million shares for the first time in
12 days. The Dow Jones dropped 24.19, closing at 1156.3.

Andropov's illness may affect
speech and appearance
Moscow — Reports circulating within the Communist
Party bureaucracy here suggest that Soviet President Yuri
Andropov may suffer from an ailment that affects his ap
pearance and ability to talk.
These reports, officially unconfirmed like much else
about the 69-year-old Soviet leader's long illness, would
help explain why he has now been out of public view for 173
days, an extraordinary length of time for a society that has
a long tradition of strong personal leadership.
Soviet officials, while finally conceding that Andropov
has been seriously ill, now say for the public record that he is
recovering successfully and will reappear soon.
Yet, behind these optimistic official accounts, other
reports persist. According to one, Andropov's health has
deteriorated, temporarily affecting his ability to speak.
Another claims that Andropov has an illness known as pro
gressive spinal muscular atrophy, a mild variant of Lou Geh
rig's disease that can be crippling, although sometimes not
fatal for 25 years.
Israel: Lebanon is a lost cause
Jerusalem — Israel virtually abandoned its hope of turn
ing Lebanon into a strong and friendly neighbor yesterday,
conceding that it could do nothing to save the crumbling
regime of Lebanese President Amin Gemayel.
In a day of crisis meetings, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir presided over an emergency session of his Cabinet
and Foreign Ministry officials conferred with U.S. ambassa
dor Samuel Lewis. No action was announced.
Israeli officials said they now expect Gemayel to make
the best deal he can with the Syrians, almost surely scrap
ping the troop withdrawal and security pact that Lebanon
and Israel signed last May 17 following the personal media
tion of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
Such an outcome would cancel all of the political gains
that Israel had hoped to obtain as a result of its military
victories over the Syrian army and the Palestinian Libera
tion Organization in the summer of 1982.
Israel's state-owned radio network reported that mem
bers of the Cabinet said following the meeting that Israel
probably would have to go it alone in defending the security
of its northern border, meaning that Israeli troops would be
kept in southern Lebanon for the foreseeable future. Ear
lier, the Jerusalem government had hoped to turn over to a
strengthened Lebanese army the security situation in
southern Lebanon.
Shuttle readies for space walk
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — Two Challenger astronauts
refueled their backpacks yesterday for an encore venture
into open space, while officials on the ground worried that
rain and clouds might prevent the first Florida shuttle lan
ding on Saturday.
Mission control told the crew that "you're the talk of
the world" after the spectacular excursion that Bruce
McCandless and Robert Stewart made into space Tuesday
with no rope to anchor them to the shuttle.
McCandless and Steward are scheduled for a second walk
beginning at 6 a.m. EST today, but their three fellow
astronauts joked they might fight for the change "to share
all the good deals."
President Reagan will telephone the astronauts at 10:25
a.m. today from his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif., dep
uty White House press secretary Larry Speakes said.
Speakes said McCandless and Stewart "will be outside their
spacecraft" when they receive their call.
Commander Vance Brand reported that everyone on the
shuttle "is feeling on top of the world."
U.S. to run Honduran missions
Washington — The Pentagon yesterday announced that it
will conduct air "reconnaissance missions" from Honduras
during the next few months, although the major military
exercise known as Big Pine II officially ended yesterday.
The reconnaissance flights with small OV-1 observation
planes and possibly other aircraft, along with other military
missions, will place as many as 1700 U.S. troops in Honduras
before another set of military maneuvers, Granadero 1,
begins next summer. Last week Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger testified before Congress that about 700 to
800 troops would remain in Honduras after Big Pine 11.
Several members of Congress have accused the Defense
Department of establishing a semi-permanent military
presence in the strategically located Central American
country without the approval of Congress, which normally
must vote on military construction and the establishment
of foreign bases. p
Weinberger said there is no intention of establishing a
permanent presence. He also said the air strips, housing,
radar sites and other facilities constructed during the past
seven months were only for the exercises.

by United Nations troops.

ian sector.

and the United States, has been trying for several months
to arrange such a meeting.
