From the Los Angeles Times
Beirut, Lebanon â€” The 16-
inch guns of the U.S. battle
ship New Jersey pounded
artillery positions in the moun
tains beyond Beirut yesterday,
their first action since Presi
dent Reagan warned the day
before that U.S. Navy guns and
airpower would be used against
any units firing into greater
Beirut from Syrian-held terri
tory.
The New Jersey was joined in
the bombardment by the U.S.
destroyer Caron and, together,
the ships were reported to have
fired more than 350 shells at
Druse militia positions after
Druse artillerymen targeted
U.S. Embassy offices in West
Beirut and later the residence
of the American ambassador.
No casualties were reported as
a result of the Druse attacks.
It was only the second time
since the New Jersey arrived
off the coast of Lebanon last
Sept. 25 that it has fired its
16-inch guns, which can hurl
shells weighing more than a ton
about 23 miles.
The shelling from the sea
continued into the night, with
the shells thundering over
Beirut and causing some panic

among residents who thought
at first that they were being
attacked. A military source
here said in the early evening
that at least eight militia ar
tillery bases had been
destroyed by the shelling.
A statement issued in
Damascus, the Syrian capital,
said that the shelling had killed
"dozens of civilian women,
children and old men."
Early in the day, the 115-
man British peacekeeping con
tingent abandoned its
positions here and was flown to
a British ship offshore. At the
same time, the 1450 U.S.
Marines, who will soon begin a
phased withdrawal, began
moving some support units and
supplies to the ships of the
U.S. 6th Fleet.
The U.S. naval bombardment
and the British withdrawal mo
mentarily overshadowed events
in West Beirut, which was
captured from the Lebanese
army Monday by Moslem and
Druse militiamen. Shellfire hit
both sides of the city yester
day and militiamen and govern
ment troops exchanged fire
along the so-called Green Line

that divides Christian Fast
Beirut and the mostly Moslem
western sector.
Army units in West Beirut,
greatly weakened by detec
tions of Moslem soldiers, tell
apart Monday and Tuesday and
there were only scattered inci
dents of shooting in that part

of the city yesterday Ap
parently there are effective
army units remaining in the
eastern sector, however.
At the U.S. Marine com
pound at the airport just south
of Beirut, trucks and forklifts
loaded with supplies moved
toward the Marine landing

zone on the Mediterranean
coast. Brig. Cien. James Jo\.
commander of the Marines
here, said 25?> support troops
were being redeployed to Nav\
ships yesterday and that the
nunc had been in the works for
some time as part of an experi
ment m sea-bused operations.
