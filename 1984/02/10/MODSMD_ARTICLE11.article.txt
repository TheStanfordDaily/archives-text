# Popular surgery eases snorers' nightmares

### TINA-MARIE BASKIN Staff writer 
Are you having a problem
finding a roommate or lover or
even a neighbor because you
snore too loudly? Dr. F. Blair
Simmons of the Stanford
Medical Center notes that so
cial sleeping problems are a real
nightmare to hundreds of
people.
"It's a real problem. People
come into the office complain
ing that their husband or wife
snores so loudly that they have
to sleep in separate rooms. I
have people come in who have
to rent two motel rooms, who
get calls in the middle of the
night from neighbors because
of this problem. And of course
there are single young ladies
who like to sleep around and
can't find anyone for more
than a night due to their
snoring problems," he said.
In fact, social snoring is such
a problem that doctors in the
Ear, Nose and Throat Depart
ment at the Stanford Medical
School are now performing a

surgery that is 95 percent suc
cessful in curing chronic
snoring.
The process, according to
Simmons, has been around for
quite some time. Invented by
the Japanese and first per
formed in the mid-19505, the
surgery is similar to a tonsilec
tomy but was "never a big sel
ler," said Simmons.
In fact, as recently as 1980,
the surgery was being per
formed for a malady called
obstructive sleep apnea rather
than snoring.
Obstructive sleep apnea oc
curs during the deep stage of
sleep when the muscles in the
throat become paralyzed and
the airway becomes
obstructed. The heart waves
slow down and, as a result,
people snore heavily, l
"What we do is get rid of the
extra tissue at the back of the
throat," Simmons explained.
"It's a streamlining operation
to tighten the throat because,
after all, what tissue you don't
have won't collapse. Our

process cured about 50 percent
of the people and, strangely
enough, it cured all of the
snoring.
"So a little over a year ago
we put out a press release and
the world went bananas. It's
become a huge business and
we've found that about two
thirds of the people who com
plain of social snoring turn out
to have abstructive sleep abnia
as well."
The process is not too diffi
cult, according to Simmons. It
takes about an hour and 15
minutes and leaves the patient
with "one hell of a very sore
throat," he said.
Including hospital costs and
surgeon fees, the surgery runs
about $5000. The success has
been so overwhelming that,
Simmons said, "one doctor
can'l .keep up with the
demand."
