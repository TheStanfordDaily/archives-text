The animal rights issue came to a head last
week when Assemblyman William Filante's bill,
calling for limited use of pound animals for
biomedical research, passed the state Assembly.
The 46 legislators who voted "yes" realized the
merits of the measure: It carefully weighs both
sides of the controversy, recognizing the need
tor animal research as well as its potential
abuses.
Opponents — most notably Senate President
Pro Tem David Roberti, who himself sponsored
a measure which cleared the state Senate last
summer — charge that Filante's bill will subject
pets to dangerous or cruel research. He and
other animal rights lobbyists claim that pets
which inadverdently find their way to the pound
may end up in the laboratory.
But Filante has taken extensive steps to com
bat such occurrences. His bill calls for protection
of pets by prohibiting researchers to take pound
animals that are wearing a collar, I D. tag or
other evidence of ownership. It also stipulates
that animals remain in pounds for a specified
term before they become eligible for scientific

research, in order to give owners enough time to
recover lost pets, as well as a number of other
As one of the finest research institutions in
the world, the University has adopted an unmis
takable stance on the issue. President Kennedy
assailed animal rights activists for resorting to
"terrorist tactics" in a Sacramento speech on
Tuesday. At least one administrator has
embraced the issue as a "pet" project, devoting
a majority of his time and energy to ushering
the bill through the legislature.
Whereas Roberti professes to be protecting
poor pets, his hill only mandates unnecessary red
tape and restricts research possibilities — and in
the end still allows researchers to use out-of
state, specially-bred animals, but at four times
the cost.
Hopefully, Filante's pro-pet precautionary
safeguards will steer the bill through the state
Senate and pave the way for safe and valuable
animal research in the future. Filante and
friends — including the University — must
remain steadfast, and not concede to the cat
calls and dogma of the animal rights lobbyists.
