## Students with Hart article clarified 
### 
I want to clarify several points
that were brought up in the article
(Daily, Feb. 7) about the Students
with Hart mailing:
1) No ASSU funds were used. We
paid for the copying which was done
off-campus. We paid for the
postage.
2) Our use of the permit was
approved by an ASSU official, Janet
Tanguay.
3) The ASSU return address was
used because the ASSU instructed
us to do so.
4) No University phone numbers
were included in the mailing. The
only reason The Daily had my office
phone number was I gave it to them
when they earlier asked for a way to
reach me during the day regarding an
unrelated matter.
There was no intent on our part
to misuse the ASSU permit. I
believed we had gone through all the
right channels by first checking with
Registrar Sally Mahoney and second
by getting ASSU approval. This
story was embarrassing to me as I
feel it casts a bad light on the Hart
campaign in general and me in par
ticular. We have made a concerted
effort to work within University
guidelines and have consulted with
Mahoney several times in the past.
As a result of Tuesday's article,
she, at our request, met again with
us, and it is now clear to me that
the ASSU should not have given us
approval to use their bulk mailing
permit. We are now working with
the ASSU to make sure this problem
does not arise again and to mitigate
any problems the mailing may have
caused.
