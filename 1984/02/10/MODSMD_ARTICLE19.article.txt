# Military-funded research: two views

The British-born physicist Freeman Dyson wrote: "At
the beginning of (World War II) ... I believed fiercely in
the brotherhood of man, called myself a follower of
Gandhi and was morally opposed to all violence." He was,
nevertheless, called into service in the operations re
search section of the British bomber command. As the
war progressed he had to cross a series of moral boun
daries, until he was accepting of the fact that British
strategic doctrine called for the intense area bombing of
German cities. There was a deliberate attempt to create
a firestorm which would incinerate everything within it.
The first to suffer this fate was Hamburg. During the
night of July 27, 1943, the British dropped 2326 tons of
bombs on an area of about three square miles. In the
concrete air-raid bunkers in the workers district of
Hamm the temperatures rose, turning them into ovens
which cooked the inhabitants. The report of the chief of
police narrated that "children were torn from the hands
of their parents by the force of the hurricanes and
whirled back into the fire."
Dyson was aware from his work that the military ef
fect of the bombings was minimal: they were not helping
to win the war. He wrote: "In the last spring of the war I
could no longer find any excuses ... I had surrendered
one moral principle after another, and in the end it was
all for nothing." Based on this experience he com
mented: "Technology has made evil anonymous. Through
science and technology evil is organized bureaucratically
so that no individual is responsible for what happens."
In the 40 years since then things have only moved fur
ther in the same direction. Technological leadership, mil
itary power and geopolitical dominance are now almost
synonymous. And the system of power has reached far
into our inner life: Almost every field of intellectual en
deavor has its role to play. The study of anthropology is
brought to bear on problems of counterinsurgency, poli
tical scientists apply their expertise to problems of
"pacification" of rural cultures, and medical experi
ments are performed on terminally ill cancer patients to
help understand the functional capacity of military per
sonnel who may receive a fatal radiation dose.
And all of this happens in a time of peace. The great
institutions of higher learning have, slowly and inex
orably, become instruments of militarism. The fraction
of Stanford's research funding which comes from the
military steadily increases through the years. Some de
partments, such as Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science, are predominantly funded by military programs.
Nationwide the military share of federal research funds
has doubled in the last five years.
All of this must pose serious difficulties for the aware
individual who has chosen work in a field which is poten
tially funded by the government.

On the one hand there are those who say that the citi
zen has a duty to support a national defense. But this
suggests that anything and everything that the govern
ment proposes is both morally and legally correct and
that it is consonant with real security needs.
To follow this position puts one in the position of the
"good soldier" who never questions his orders. Walter
Rauff was a colonel in the Waffen SS who supervised the
construction and use of special killing vans which recir
culated the exhaust gases to asphyxiate the passengers;
200,000 people were killed in this manner in Eastern

FORUM

Europe. Testifying at a court hearing in Chile, Rauff
said: "In this mattef, I did not operate on my own au
thority but on superior orders."
There are others who say that the application of tech
nology is a political matter, beyond the responsibility of
the scientist. One Stanford scientist was quoted in this
regard: "1 never look down the road. 1 just do what's in
teresting to me. Raulf also spoke to this point:
"Although the technical office under my orders had to
do with the special trucks used to produce deaths by as
phyxia, the mission of this office was only related to the
technical aspects and had nothing to do with the execu
tion of people."
It may seem harsh to speak of good, kindly, tweedy
Stanford professors in the same context as depraved
mass murderers, but the world is full of death these
days. We are spending $600 billion per year on arms,
more than the annual income of the poorest two billion
people. These expenditures are rising exponentially with
a doubling time of about five years. These expenditures
result in dea(h in two ways: by pre-empting the opportu
nity for equivalent expenditures on food and health, and
by the fact that weapons end up killing people. There
have been 16 million deaths in war in the last 40 years,
more than half of them civilian. This in a time when nu
clear deterrence has kept the peace.
Are we responsible for this? Surely the responsibility
must go with the power. Those of us who are close to
the top of the power hierarchy in the most powerful na
tion on earth should perhaps look around us. If we are
not responsible, then who is?
A hundred years ago, Benjamin Disraeli said that "a
university should be a place of light, of liberty and learn
ing." The unquestioning acceptance of militarism as a
permanent fact of life is hardly consonant with any of
those.
