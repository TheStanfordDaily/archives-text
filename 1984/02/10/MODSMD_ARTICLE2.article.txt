l-rom wire and staff reports
Soviet President Yuri Andropov is
dead.
The announcement this morning
from the Soviet news agency TASS
that Andropov died yesterday ended
nearly six months of speculation over
the health of the 69-year-old former
KGB leader.
The announcement, read simulta
neously over Soviet radio and televi
sion stations, said, "The Central
Committee of the Communist Party
of the Soviet Union (CPSU), the
Presidium of the U.S.S.R. and the
U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers with
deep sorrow inform the party and
the entire Soviet people that Yuri
Vladimirovich Andropov, general sec
retary of the CPSU Central Com
mittee, president of the Presidium
of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, died
after a long illness at 16 hours 50
minutes on Feb. 9, 1984."
The announcement called
Andropov an "outstanding leader of

the Communist Party and of the So
viet state, a staunch fighter for the
ideals of communism and for peace."
Andropov had not been seen in
public since Aug. 18, when he met
with a group of U.S. senators.
U.S. State Department spokesmen
told The Daily they could not con
firm reports of Andropov's death
until official weird came from the So
viet government. "We have no con
firmation at this point." said Sondra
McCarty, a State Department
spokesperson. "TASS made the an
nouncement," she said.
"We don't have anything one way
or the other," said Bryan Carlson, an
other State Department spokesper
son. "We have to wait for the Soviet
government to confirm the reports."
Moments before the TASS an
nouncement, French Foreign Mini
ster Claude Cheysson told a
ministerial meeting in Brussels, Bel
gium that Andropov had died, accor
ding to officials attending the

meeting. The officials said Cheysson,
chairman of the gathering, inter
rupted the meeting and made the


Yuri Andropov
following announcement:
"1 have to interrupt this meeting
for an important announcement.
Yuri Andropov is dead. The partv
leader td one of the greatest
countries of the world has passed
awav."
President Reagan was awakened at
his mountaintop ranch in Santa Bar
bara early this morning and told of
the news. White House Spokesman
Larry Speakes said.
Speakes said Reagan was awakened
at 6:20 a.m. EST. the same time
Andropov's death was announced in
Moscow on the English language wire
of TASS. The spokesman said Mi
chael Heaver, the deputy chief of
staff, called Reagan to inform the
president of the death.
"We have no formal reaction, but
we do anticipate a formal statement
by the United States government
later today." Speakes said.
With Andropov's death. Western
diplomatic analysts believe Soviet
leadership will face a difficult and
perhaps prolonged internal succession
struggle as none ot the 12 other
Politburo members presents so clear
cut a choice or holds the political
power Andropov held 14 months ago
when former Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev died.
Among those mentioned as likely
successors to Andropov are Grigorv
Romanov. 60, the former head ol
the Leningrad party organization
who moved into the position ot a
powerful party secretary last year,
and Mikhail Gorbachev, 53, also a
party secretary and the youngest
man on the Politburo.
Romanov's tough economic man
agement in Leningrad and his hard
line political views are likely to
appeal to the army and the KGB.
which are likely to exercise the
decisive vote in the succession.
When Brezhnev died. Andropov
provided his Politburo colleagues
with a clear-cut choice over
Brezhnev's unimpressive heir appar
ent, Konstantin Chernenko. Cher
nenko is still an influential Politburo

member.
Western diplomats have cau
tioned. however, that any new suc
cession also might move a less
dynamic man in the Politburo for
ward as a compromise among differ
ing factions.
Serious speculation that Andropov
had died began early yesterday eve
ning. when Western news agencies re
ported that the Soviet president's
son Icor Andropov, a member of the
Soviet delegation at the Stockholm
disarmament conference. had
abruptly left for Moscow.
There had been reports within the
Communist Party establishment in
the past two days that the 69-year
old Soviet leader's health had again
deteriorated and that his ability to
speak had been temporarily affected.
Andropov had been rumored to be
suffering from a degenerative kidney
ailment, but Soviet officials had in
sisted that his illness was no more
than a cold and had predicted his im
minent return to public activity.
CBS News reported early last night
that Andropov had undergone a kid
ney transplant and was in feeble con
dition. Soviet television
unexpectedly changed its scheduled
program to classical music shortly
after 8 p.m. and the state radio fol
lowed with similar shifts later in the
evening. The unusual change ap
peared to experts to be an indication
that the country was being placed on
an emergency footing.
In the past, such programming
changes have been made prior to the
announcement of the death of a
senior political figure. The situation
was similar to that of Nov. 9, 1982,
just prior to the formal announce
ment the next day that Brezhnev
had died.
Without any explanation last
night, a scheduled concert of jazz
music was replaced by a classical con
cert on Soviet television at 8:15 p.m.
The state radio dropped a program of
jazz music scheduled for 11:35 p.m.
Moscow time and replaced it with
classical music.
However, both television and radio
transmitted hockey competition
from the Sarajevo Olympic Games.
