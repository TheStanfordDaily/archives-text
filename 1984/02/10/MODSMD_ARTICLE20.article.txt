## In defense of defense 
### 
It is now 38 years since the end of
World War 11, the last time the
United States had to devote its main
effort to defense. In the meantime,
there have been numerous alarms and
lesser wars.
I he public, including Congress and
the academic community, has become
bored and increasingly disinclined to
the expense and sacrifices required to
maintain a military establishment.
We have grown captious, and minor
annoyances with defense require
ments and minor mistakes on the
part of the defense establishment
have been exaggerated into major is
sues, at least in some quarters.
All this is inevitable and has hap
pened repeatedly in the past. The
solution that is always adopted is to
professionalise defense. Some people
are paid to make it their career, and
the rest of us grumblingly pay our
taxes.
Unfortunately, the problem is
worse than it has been in the past for
two reasons. The first is the exis
tence of nuclear weapons. I can be
brief, because everyone is familiar
with the fact that our country can
be damaged within hours worse than
any country has suffered over years
of war.
The second problem is the exis
tence of the Soviet Union and com
munism. Were it not for this, I
believe the problem of nuclear weap
ons would be solved by international
agreement along the lines advocated
by the various peace movements. The
interaction of communist ideology,
Russian nationalism, and a per
vasively quasi-feudal empire has
produced a dangerous power whose
behavior is unpredictable in the long
run, even with the best intelligence.
Every succession crisis in the Soviet
Union carries with it the danger of a
nuclear Napoleon.
In view of this, the United States

and its allies require a policy of
preparedness that can he maintained
indefinitely. We must pursue such
agreements as are possible with the
Soviet Union, but fundamentally we
must rely on ourselves. Unfortunate
ly, because after World War II the
United States was so dominant in
dustrially and militarily, the so-called
alliance developed a dangerous de
pendence on the United States that
probably cannot be sustained.
The academic and scientific com
munities have many things to think
about, and defense is only one of
them. This causes inevitable strains
in our relation with the Defense De
partment, whose job it is to think
about defense all the time. Never
theless, we are the ones being
defended, and we should cooperate
with them.
This view would be more readily ac
cepted but for another problem.
There is a substantial body of opinion
in the world and at Stanford that
regards the United States as the vil
lain in world affairs. This opinion
tends to convert strains in the rela
tions between the academic and
defense communities into arguments
for complete non-cooperation. They
have achieved important successes at
Stanford, (e.g., the abolition of
ROTC.)
Finally, ordinary politics enters
into it. This is an election year, and
the outs tend to exaggerate the dif
ferences with the ins and claim that
government policies, even policies
with which they have substantially
agreed in Congress, are leading the
nation to an immediate disaster that
can only be averted by electing them.
All these phenomena need to be
overcome in order that Stanford
scientists and engineers can do their
part in keeping the country safe, and,
incidentally, can pursue their scien
tific goals with help from the
Defense Department.
