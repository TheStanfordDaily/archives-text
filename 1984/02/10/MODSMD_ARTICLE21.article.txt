# Individuality: Let's not compromise
## 
### 
Every year, Stanford congratulates itself on
the diversity of students which it attracts, and
the breadth of talent which its entering class em
bodies. However, a strange thing seems to hap
pen to each year's rich, multifaceted group:
Within little time, each confident class seems to
become an insulated, narrow collection, eager to
conform to certain common standards, to seek
the safety and security of adherence to an ac
cepted group ethic, and to become part of some
established union or organization, which slowly
drains the individuality and personality which had
made its members unique and special in the first
place.
In an environment of detachment and isola
tion, the pressures to associate and conform are
intimidating. At college, where many students
experience their first prolonged periods of facing
problems by themselves, the temptation to join a
group, or simply to fit a mold, are great. Individ
uals naturally seek support, friendship, a feeling
of community and family, and social acceptance,
and a multitude of organizations are eager to
meet these needs.
These needs are real and necessary and they are
met not only by the community in general, but by
particular groups, such as fraternities and
sororities, dormitories, religious organizations
and support groups of all kinds. Individuals find
support and other benefits in these groups, but a
dependence on them, and on the university envi
ronment as a whole, serves to stifle and suppress
personality to the extent where one's in
dividuality endures, but one's actions do not
reflect one's personality, conforming, rather, to
exterior standards and norms of behavior which

are often opposed to one's true inclination.
An organization such as a university reaches
great heights by provoking unity and a sense of
common purpose. However, the concept of com
mon purpose is a tricky one, and an unwavering
commitment to it is dangerous and threatening.

Conformity to a group, or
simply to a community, even if
the organization returns
benefits and comforts, is a
dangerous and tragic thing
because it establishes a pattern
of dependence and obedience
to our institutions.

A university which is narrow and demanding of
conformity produces narrow, fixated people, in
tolerant to the awesome diversity of thought
and action which exists beyond the edges of
campus. A community which is closed and stan
dardized produces individuals ready to step un
flinchingly into the conformist, closed corporate
world, prepared to swallow their ideas and follow
the dictum of a monolith.
Campus groups and organizations reinforce
this problem. Some individuals use the group to
further themselves and achieve things they could
not ordinarily have accomplished. Others, though,
become subservient and dependent, failing to use
the group and instead arc abused by it.
Fraternities and sororities, for instance, at
tract some confident, successful individuals who

drive the group and produce results which are
made possible by the unity and size of such organ
izations. However, many insecure individuals are
also attracted to such groups and their security,
and are subsequently used for all kinds of ends.
They often act in an unnatural and harmful way,
destructive not only to others, but mainly to
themselves.
Campus religious groups, often providing the
support and community formerly provided by
close family, attract many students who are ex
periencing the uncertainty and insecurity follow
ing arrival on campus. While these groups provide
support, they also demand commitment and ad
herence to self-righteously proclaimed concep
tions of correct behavior. The dependence on the
community and the group produces conformity
to its direction, and an adjustment to narrow, in
flexible behavior.
I he period of college is a crucial transition
phase to the professional world. The attitudes
and values developed now form the basis for our
actions and behavior in the near future. Con
formity to a group, or simply to a community,
even if the organization returns benefits and
comforts, is a dangerous and tragic thing because
it establishes a pattern of dependence and
obedience to our institutions. Such an attitude
blunts the possibilities of social change and pro
gress which are manifestations of human poten
tial. The conforming person, adhering to a norm,
is tomorrow's cog, not its engine. A personality is
a terrible thing to waste, and individuality is a big
thing to compromise.

drive the group and produce results which are
made possible by the unity and size of such organ
izations. However, many insecure individuals are
also attracted to such groups and their security,
and are subsequently used for all kinds of ends.
They often act in an unnatural and harmful way,
destructive not only to others, but mainly to
themselves.
Campus religious groups, often providing the
support and community formerly provided by
close family, attract many students who are ex
periencing the uncertainty and insecurity follow
ing arrival on campus. While these groups provide
support, they also demand commitment and ad
herence to self-righteously proclaimed concep
tions of correct behavior. The dependence on the
community and the group produces conformity
to its direction, and an adjustment to narrow, in
flexible behavior.
I he period of college is a crucial transition
phase to the professional world. The attitudes
and values developed now form the basis for our
actions and behavior in the near future. Con
formity to a group, or simply to a community,
even if the organization returns benefits and
comforts, is a dangerous and tragic thing because
it establishes a pattern of dependence and
obedience to our institutions. Such an attitude
blunts the possibilities of social change and pro
gress which are manifestations of human poten
tial. The conforming person, adhering to a norm,
is tomorrow's cog, not its engine. A personality is
a terrible thing to waste, and individuality is a big
thing to compromise.
