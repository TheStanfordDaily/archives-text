## Groups work together 
### NANETTE ARCHER 
I he University's Mental
Health Week wraps up today
alter five days of speeches,
seminars and discussions focus
ing on the dilemma of students
discovering their personal iden
tity.
An annual event sponsored
collectively by Residential
Education, the Bridge and
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), the groups'
combined effort attempts to
heighten awareness of mental
health issues and promote an
atmosphere in which people are
comfortable discussing mental
health concerns, according to
Alice Supton, assistant dean of
Res Ed.
Supton, who has been in
volved in the planning and im
plementation of many of the
week's activities, was also in
strumental in developing this
year's general theme:
"Becoming Who We Are: Iden
tity Formation in the '80s."
With personal identity cur
rently a major issue, "especially
when it is becoming more ac
knowledged that women can
succeed in the public sphere
and men can be capable of nur
turing," Supton said that this
theme emerged as a fairly
unanimous suggestion.
Bridge counselor Mary Yuh,
who has also helped to coor
dinate this week's plans,
stressed the need for on
campus discussion of various
topics affecting the lives of
students.
Some of the subjects for the
dorm-based discussions in
cluded identity crisis, sexual
concerns of college students,
eating disorders, ethnic iden
tity and stress, stopping out

and suicide understanding and
prevention. Vuh hopes that by
raising these issues, people
would become better informed
and able to deal with such
problems.
All of the scheduled speakers
were from University depart
ments and organizations; Psy
chology, CAPS and the Career
Planning and Placement Cen
ter, for instance, all offered
their services. In addition, this
year's program incorporated
some participatory events, ex
panding the format established
in previous years. Included were
the KPFA presentation en
titled, "Music From the Hearts
of Space," Stanford creative
writing students' "Poetry of
the Self' readings, and, one of
the most popular events, the
nightly "Imaginarium" pro
grams.
"Imaginarium" was originally
put together by Stanford's En
gineering Design Department
about 10 years ago. It features
a geodesic dome with a trap
door that leads participants to
a floating platform. From
there, a central lens projects
various images onto the dome's
interior and, combined with "a
special presentation of relaxa
tion and imagination tech
niques," transports the
audience to a creative, stress
less mood, according to Bridge
counselor Mike Resnick.
Supton summarized the
group's common concern and
the overall goal of all activities
as helping people understand
how to lead "a healthy, full,
developed, self-conscious life."
The program, which has been
in the planning stages since fall
quarter, cost between $1000
and $ 1 500 to produce.
