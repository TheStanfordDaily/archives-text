## Jones won't start, Fischer won't play Wanted: get well Cards for Big Game in Berkeley 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It you're Novian Whitsitt,
you've got a few butterflies in
your stomach. If you're Keith
Jones or Andy Fischer, you're
sick to your stomach. And if
you're Stanford Basketball
Coach Tom Davis, you're more
than a little worried.
It seems the recent Califor
nia rains have brought with
them the flu bug. Jones — and
his 19.S Pacific-10 Conference
leading scoring average — and
Fischer both have it.
Jones probably will dress for
tonight's game against UC-
Berkeley in Harmon Gym at 8
p.m., but he will not start.
Whitsitt, a freshman, will start
for the first time as a collegian
in his place. Fischer, who
started 10 games for the Card
earlier this season and recently
has been the first player off
the bench, probably won't even
suit up at all.
Although Davis was un
available for comment con
cerning the two late illnesses,
you can just as easily put the
words in his mouth. It's going
to hurt.
And no worse time for the
llu to hit than right before a
game that is not only big to
the Cardinal in the sense of
rivalry, but also from the
standpoint of gaining a post
season tournament bid.
Following a more-lopsided
than-the-score-indicates 73-69
loss to non-conference foe
Santa Clara Tuesday night, the
Cardinal — 15-8 overall and 4-
6 in the Pac-10 — can suffer
two and at most three set
backs in its final eight games if
it hopes to attend its first
post-season party since 1942.
With games still to come
against Washington, UCLA
and Oregon — three of the top
four teams in the Pac-10 — it
goes without saying that a loss
now would severely dim those
chances.
A Stanford victory tonight
would also assure the Card its
first winning season in 11 years,
as it would be the 16th win on
a 31 -game schedule.

Cal has struggled lately, win
ning just one of six games after
defeating Stanford 66-64 at
Maples Pavilion last month.
The Bears are 8-11 overall and
3-6 in the Pac-10, including
three straight conference
losses.
Stanford, meanwhile, has
been on the upswing. The Card
fell to 0-4 in the Pac-10 after
the loss to Cal and then
dropped two more games
before finally finding the win
ning formula in its next four.
But as is the case in the
football version of the Big
Game, the contest is always a
toss-up, no matter how well or
poorly the two teams have

been playing in the weeks prior
to it.
While winning streaks and
such can be forgotten tonight,
the illnesses to Jones and Fis
cher can't.
"KJ (Jones) is basically one
of the main cogs in our offense
along with John Revelli,"
Whitsitt said when told he
would be replacing Jones, who
has scored in double figures in
his last 40 games. "It's going to
be hard without him starting. 1
don't even want to think
about him not playing at all."
Whitsitt, who has averaged
just 5.8 minutes and 1.8 points
per game this season, admitted
the butterflies will be there

tonight, but not in tull force.
"It's going to basically be the
same role as coming off the
bench." he said ot starting his
first collegiate game. "I don't
think I'll be that nervous.
Coach Davis worked me pretty
hard all week so I know I won't
get tired."
Stanford, which will start
freshmen Whitsitt and John
Pave at guards, won't be alone
with its all-frosh backeourt.
Cal Coach Dick Kuchen also
starts a pair of freshman
guards — Chris Washington
and Kevin Washington.
Besides Whitsitt and Paye,
Davis will go with Steve Brown
and Earl Koberlein at the for
wards and Revelli at center, as
suming no one else comes down
with the llu between now and
game time. With the possibility
that both Jones and Fischer
won't be able to come off the
bench, Davis' method of sub
stituting often will be af
fected.
"When we've struggled at
other times (this season), it's
been because of the disruption
of our flow of players (coming
off the bench)," Davis ex
plained. "And this is a tough
time of the (school) year for
the students because midterms
are going on and they are really
pushing academically."
For Cal. Kuchen will prob
ably start another guard —
senior Butch Hays — at the
forward spot along with Jeff
Thilgen and sophomore Dave
Butler at center. Hays is 11th
in the Pac-10 in scoring with his
14.6 average in conference con
tests.
Because of the depleted
ranks, many Card players will
spend a lot of time on the
floor tired. And tired players
have a tendency to foul, some
thing Stanford can't afford to
do tonight. Cal is the top free
throw shooting team in the
conference, making 75.2 per
cent of their attempts from
the charity stripe.
Card notes
Tonight's game will be
broadcast live by Metrosports
on Channel 48 at 8 p.m.
Jones leads the Pac-10 in

scoring in exclusively confer
ence games (17.S ppg) and in all
games (19.5). Revelii is ninth in
conference games (15.8) and
second in all games (17.3).

Brown is 15th in all games
(12.2)
Cal has defeated Stanford
the last five times the two
teams have met. Harmon Gym,

although its capacity is only
6500, can he one of the loudest
arell as in the country, espe
cially with both the Stanford
and Cal hands on hand.

Coach Tom Davis may be praying for a miracle flu cure as his
team faces UC-Berkeley without forward Andy Fischer, and
possibly without leading scorer Keith Jones.

Freshman Novian Whitsitt gets his first starting call as a collegian tonight against UC-
Berkeley as he replaces flu-stricken Keith jones at the shooting guard spot.
It you're Novian Whitsitt,
you've got a few butterflies in
your stomach. If you're Keith
Jones or Andy Fischer, you're
sick to your stomach. And if
you're Stanford Basketball
Coach Tom Davis, you're more
than a little worried.
It seems the recent Califor
nia rains have brought with
them the flu bug. Jones — and
his 19.S Pacific-10 Conference
leading scoring average — and
Fischer both have it.
Jones probably will dress for
tonight's game against UC-
Berkeley in Harmon Gym at 8
p.m., but he will not start.
Whitsitt, a freshman, will start
for the first time as a collegian
in his place. Fischer, who
started 10 games for the Card
earlier this season and recently
has been the first player off
the bench, probably won't even
suit up at all.
Although Davis was un
available for comment con
cerning the two late illnesses,
you can just as easily put the
words in his mouth. It's going
to hurt.
And no worse time for the
llu to hit than right before a
game that is not only big to
the Cardinal in the sense of
rivalry, but also from the
standpoint of gaining a post
season tournament bid.
Following a more-lopsided
than-the-score-indicates 73-69
loss to non-conference foe
Santa Clara Tuesday night, the
Cardinal — 15-8 overall and 4-
6 in the Pac-10 — can suffer
two and at most three set
backs in its final eight games if
it hopes to attend its first
post-season party since 1942.
With games still to come
against Washington, UCLA
and Oregon — three of the top
four teams in the Pac-10 — it
goes without saying that a loss
now would severely dim those
chances.
A Stanford victory tonight
would also assure the Card its
first winning season in 11 years,
as it would be the 16th win on
a 31 -game schedule.

Cal has struggled lately, win
ning just one of six games after
defeating Stanford 66-64 at
Maples Pavilion last month.
The Bears are 8-11 overall and
3-6 in the Pac-10, including
three straight conference
losses.
Stanford, meanwhile, has
been on the upswing. The Card
fell to 0-4 in the Pac-10 after
the loss to Cal and then
dropped two more games
before finally finding the win
ning formula in its next four.
But as is the case in the
football version of the Big
Game, the contest is always a
toss-up, no matter how well or
poorly the two teams have

been playing in the weeks prior
to it.
While winning streaks and
such can be forgotten tonight,
the illnesses to Jones and Fis
cher can't.
"KJ (Jones) is basically one
of the main cogs in our offense
along with John Revelli,"
Whitsitt said when told he
would be replacing Jones, who
has scored in double figures in
his last 40 games. "It's going to
be hard without him starting. 1
don't even want to think
about him not playing at all."
Whitsitt, who has averaged
just 5.8 minutes and 1.8 points
per game this season, admitted
the butterflies will be there

tonight, but not in tull force.
"It's going to basically be the
same role as coming off the
bench." he said ot starting his
first collegiate game. "I don't
think I'll be that nervous.
Coach Davis worked me pretty
hard all week so I know I won't
get tired."
Stanford, which will start
freshmen Whitsitt and John
Pave at guards, won't be alone
with its all-frosh backeourt.
Cal Coach Dick Kuchen also
starts a pair of freshman
guards — Chris Washington
and Kevin Washington.
Besides Whitsitt and Paye,
Davis will go with Steve Brown
and Earl Koberlein at the for
wards and Revelli at center, as
suming no one else comes down
with the llu between now and
game time. With the possibility
that both Jones and Fischer
won't be able to come off the
bench, Davis' method of sub
stituting often will be af
fected.
"When we've struggled at
other times (this season), it's
been because of the disruption
of our flow of players (coming
off the bench)," Davis ex
plained. "And this is a tough
time of the (school) year for
the students because midterms
are going on and they are really
pushing academically."
For Cal. Kuchen will prob
ably start another guard —
senior Butch Hays — at the
forward spot along with Jeff
Thilgen and sophomore Dave
Butler at center. Hays is 11th
in the Pac-10 in scoring with his
14.6 average in conference con
tests.
Because of the depleted
ranks, many Card players will
spend a lot of time on the
floor tired. And tired players
have a tendency to foul, some
thing Stanford can't afford to
do tonight. Cal is the top free
throw shooting team in the
conference, making 75.2 per
cent of their attempts from
the charity stripe.

Tonight's game will be
broadcast live by Metrosports
on Channel 48 at 8 p.m.
