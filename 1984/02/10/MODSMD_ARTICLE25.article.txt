# San Jose State next for Card
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Though the Stanford
baseball team has lost three of
its last four games, Coach
Mark Marquess knows it's too
early to push the panic button.
Still, the Cardinal wouldn't
mind getting back on the win
ning track today and tomorrow
against San Jose State (1-3).
Today's game will be at Sunken
Diamond at 2:30, and the
teams will square off twice at
San Jose State tomorrow begin
ning at noon.
Stanford's offense stumbled
against nationally ranked Cal
State Fullerton and Fresno
State, which will cause the Car
dinal (5-3) to fall from its
preseason No. 6 spot.
Marquess isn't concerned
about the Stanford offense —
yet.
"The hitting is normally he
hind the pitching at this point
in the season," Marquess said
earlier this week. "It'll take an
other couple of weeks to see
what type of offense we have.
Six to eight games is too early
to tell."
Outfielder Mike Deßenon
and third baseman Ken Green,
both sophomores, are among
the few who have avoided the
Cardinal's offensive troubles.
Deßenon started the season
fast and has been steady, while
Green was an unexpected dis
covery on both offense and
defense.
Stanford is looking to regain
the offensive potency it had
when it scored 24 runs in its
season-opening series sweep of
the University of San Fran
cisco. Today the Cardinal will
face Spartan junior Ron
Rooker (0-1), who was one of
three Spartan pitchers to lose
to UC-Berkeley. San Jose
State's lone win was over UC-
Davis.
Rooker's counterpart will be
Stanford senior Brian Myers.
Myers, an All-America can
didate and 1953 NCAA all
tourney selection, will be
trying to offset last Friday's
performance where he was
tapped for four runs, including
two home runs, by Fullerton in
a 5-4 Cardinal loss.
Senior John Radtke, who had
a complete-game win over
Fullerton Saturday, faces San
Jose State in tomorrow's
opener. Steve Cottrell will

start the nightcap.
The Spartans, who also are
experiencing a slow start of
fensively, are paced by out
fielders Scott Rettig and Paul
Mason. "They didn't hit well in
their first games out of the
chute," Marquess said, adding
that while San Jose State does
not boast the national creden
tials of Fresno State and
Fullerton, the Spartans hold
their own.

"They're a good team. They
feel they have one of their
best teams," Marquess said.
"Their position players are very
good and they have a lot of
returners."
The Cardinal also will be on
the road Sunday, facing Santa
Clara. Stanford returns home
Tuesday to take on University
of Pacific.
Marquess said Stanford's
preseason ranking probably will

prove correct in the long run,
but he also regards Stanford's
early nonconference games as
important. Marquess said,
"We're concerned with playing
well now and getting ready for
the Pac-10 season.
"We could conceivably be in
the top 10 — and still be
fourth in the league," he
quipped, referring to the
strength of the Pac-10 South
ern Division (Six-Pac).
