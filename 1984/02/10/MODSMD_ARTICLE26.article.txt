# Women netters travel to Arizona for weekend
## 
### JOHN LIS 
This weekend the Stanford women's tennis
team takes its No. 1 ranking down to the
state of Arizona for a pair of matches. The
Cardinal will travel to Tucson to face Arizona
on Saturday and will then head up to Tempe
to face Arizona State.
The Sun Devils are 1-2 this season. They
have beaten Grand Canyon, hut lost to San
Diego State and Cal State Fullerton.
Stanford Head Coach Frank Brennan is un
certain as to his line-up. The major question
mark is sophomore Kate Gompert, who
twisted her ankle in a professional tourna
ment last weekend.
Brennan said that her injury is only a strain,
hut he doesn't know whether she will make
the trip. "We'll have her hit a few balls in the
morning and see if she'll be able to go for us,
" he said.
Brennan will have the services of either
junior Linda Gates or freshman Patty Fen
dick this weekend, however. Both are com
peting in the National Indoor Individual
Championships in Provo, Utah, but because
they are seeded into the same bracket, at
least one will be eliminated by this weekend.

Both won their first-round matches in
Provo yesterday. Fendick defeated Karen
Davis of UCLA, while Gates topped Kim
Clingan of Florida.
Also making the trip will be the six players
who played in Wednesday's 7-2 victory over
the University of the Pacific — freshmen
Leigh Anne Eldredge and Stephanie Savides.
sophomores Alyce Werdel and Susan Ross,
junior Barbara Baughman and senior Michelle
Weiss.
Eldredge, playing in her first match this
season, registered a 7-6, 6-3 victory Wednes
day. The next three Card singles players won
as well — Savides took a 6-2, 6-0 decision,
Weiss won 6-3, 6-3, and Werdel captured a 6-
0, 3-6, 6-3 victory.
Baughman and Ross dropped the only two
matches of that contest. Baughman fell 6-4,
6-0, while Ross lost 6-2, 6-1.
Stanford swept the doubles, though.
Eldredge and Savides won 6-7, 6-4, 6-1, Weiss
and Werdel recored a 6-4, 6-1 victory, and
Baughman and Ross redeemed themselves
with a 7-5, 6-1 triumph.
After this weekend the netters, 2-0, will
return home for a match against Santa Clara
Thursday.
