Stanford Head Women's
Basketball Coach Dotty
McCrea made it clear that the
Cardinal has not thrown in the
towel on this season despite a
3-17 record. The cagers travel
to Pepperdine tonight and San
Diego State tomorrow, and
McCrea insists that the Card
will be ready.
"We've defined our goals for
the rest of the season, " she
said, "and the next eight games
are important to us. We've
decided to play the role of
spoiler and see if we can influ
ence the conference race. "
Tonight the Card will take a
break from that conference
schedule against Pepperdine, an
independent. Pepperdine is 11-
12 this season. Last weekend
they came in third in the
UCLA Tournament, defeating
Loyola in the consolation
game, 97-70, after losing to
UC-Berkeley, 80-63, in the
opener.
Pepperdine's leading scorer is
forward Maureen Formico. The
6-foot freshman is averaging
18.4 points and 10.4 rebounds
per game. Last weekend she
was named to the all
tournament team with 44
points and 29 rebounds in the
two contests, including a 27-
point, 21-rebound effort
against Loyola.
Also in double figures for
Pepperdine are 6-0 junior for
ward Anita Rodgers (14.5 ppg.
8.1 rpg), 5-6 senior guard Step
hanie Turman (13.8 ppg, 7 as

sists) and 5-6 senior guard
Renee Edwards (10.3 ppg. 4.5
assists).
As a team. Pepperdine is
averaging 74.S points an out
ing, despite shooting only 41.6
percent from the field. Pep
perdine usually goes with its
starters tor the entire game,
which means foul trouble could
force them to go to a rather
inexperienced bench.
San Diego State is 17-3 over
all this year. 3-3 in the WCAA.
The Aztecs' impressive record
is due in part to an admittedly
weak non-conference schedule.
I he Aztecs are led by fresh
man Tina Hutchinson, last
season's National High School
Player of the Year. The 6-3
forward is averaging 29.3
points and 10 rebounds per
game this season.
Other starters for San Diego
State are 5-5 junior guard
Maria Stack (12.2 ppg), 6-4
freshman center Toni Wallace
(11.8 ppg, 8.1 rpg) and 6-1
freshman forward Shelda Arae
neaux (11.3 ppg, 8.2 rpg).
The Aztecs are one of the
top offensive teams in the na
tion. averaging 92.5 points per
contest. They are shooting
5 1.3 percent from the field.
Asked about this weekend,
McCrea said, "We're not going
to vary our game plan because
we want to perfect what we
do. We are going to be chal
lenged physically in both
games. "
Against Hutchinson and San

Diego State McCrea hopes to
"keep it slow and control the
defensive boards. We don't
want them to get more than
one shot."' She realizes shut
ting down Hutchinson would
be difficult, but said. "We
don't care it she scores all their

points and gets 60. just as long
as we score 61."
The Cardinal is in the midst
of a five-game losing streak,
has lost 16 of its last 17. and
has dropped its first seven con
ference games. Said McCrea.
"We're due."
