# Faculty Senate renews IR
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer 
The recommendation of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies to renew the International Relations
(IR) Program for another five years was unanimously
passed by the Faculty Senate yesterday afternoon. The
Committee did, however, express concern over the
future of the program.
The program's future existence was questioned be
cause so many of the courses considered part of the In
ternational Relations Program are cross-referenced in
other departments, particularly the Political Science De
partment. The other concern expressed in the report was
that Political Science 35 is the only specific course which
is considered a core course for all IR majors.
Students are also required to take a class in U.S.
foreign relations, but no specific course is offered. The
Internatonal Relations Program also strongly recom
mends that students take at least one course in interna
tional economics. The committee suggested that a
>pecifie economics course_Ut.made part of the IR core.
'' Science Prof. David Aberncthy said that the•
IR program requires that students complete two years
of a foreign language and study overseas.

"If we add an economics requirement, does that mean
we have to add Economics 1 and 52. . . to what is already
a substantial course load?" Abernethy asked.
The committee proposed that some agreement be
made within the School of Humanities and Sciences to
make sure that courses needed by 1R majors are offered
on a regular basis through the several departments in
volved in the program.
The establishment of endowed chairs was recommend
ed to assure continued financial support of the program.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Norman Wessells ex
pressed concern about following the precedent set by
the Human Biology Program, another inter
departmental program, of creating endowed chairs to
fund departments. "1 don't think that is a model the
University should be following to fund department pro
grams," Wessells said.
Donors provide funds for an endowed chair within a
specific department which therefore places some respon
sibility on the University to maintain that particular de
partment. Provost Albert Hastorf, also concerned about
the University's responsibility to donors, said. "We hope
we won't be pushed into being terrib-
Iv specific about what those endowed
chairs will be. . . I like endowed chairs
in the social sciences rather than a
chair in American Historv IN6O-70."
The annual report of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies for
1982-83. which was also presented
yesterday to the Facultv Senate, rec
ommended to the provost that a
committee similar to that of the
Western Culture Program's be
formed for the Overseas Studies
Program.
Two years ago the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies organized an
ad hoc committee, chaired by Sociol
ogy Prof. Alex Inkclcs. to recom
mend administrative and
programmatic changes for the Over
seas Studies Program. The commit
tee's report to the provost did not
follow the recommendations of the
84-page ad hoc committee's program
report. The ad hoc committee recom
mended that the Faculty Senate es
tablish a standing Academic Council
Committee on Overseas Studies con
sisting of no more than five members
of the Academic Council, at least
one of them from the School of En
gineering and at least three from the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
as well as no more than two students
who have spent time at one of Stan
ford's overseas campuses or centers.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, last
year's chairman of the Committe on
Undergraduate Education, presented
his committee's differing view that,
rather than further breaking up the
administration of the Overseas Pro
gram by instituting several new
panels, the provost should organize a
program committee similar to that
now overseeing the Western Culture

Program. This committee would
report to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies, which would then
report to the Faculty Senate. The
Committe on Undergraduate Studies
did concur with the ad hoc commit
tee in endorsing the dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
rather than the provost — as the ad
ministrator responsible tor overseas
studies programs.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz ex
pressed the concern of several fac
ulty members that with the proposed
changes the Faculty Senate would be
losing some of its control over the
Overseas Studies Program. "The con
stitutional issue is important here
. . .the Senate has the right to ap
point a committee. ... II we concur
in this we abdicate that responsibil
ity," Rebholz said.
Assoc. Prof, of Philosophy Michael
Bratman responded. "No matter
what happens today tin Senate has
the light to establish a committee to
oversee the Overseas Studies Pro
gram. There's no abdication."
The programmatic changes the ad
hoc committee proposed will be con
sidered later this year by the present
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
Hastorf, reporting for University
President Donald Kennedy, who was
in Sacramento presenting Stanford
Noble Laureate Henry Taube to the
legislature, said at present the situa
tion of the Reagan library and policy
center is "in limbo."
"There is very little to report. . . .
Campus Report last week carried a
story which describes the content of
the letter the Board of Trustees
President Kimball sent to
(Presidential Adviser Edwin) Meese.
. . . As of noon we had no reply from
Meese. . .therefore it is exceedingly
doubtful the Board of Trustees will
have anything to discuss at their
meeting on Monday." Hastorf said.

The recommendation of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies to renew the International Relations
(IR) Program for another five years was unanimously
passed by the Faculty Senate yesterday afternoon. The
Committee did, however, express concern over the
future of the program.
The program's future existence was questioned be
cause so many of the courses considered part of the In
ternational Relations Program are cross-referenced in
other departments, particularly the Political Science De
partment. The other concern expressed in the report was
that Political Science 35 is the only specific course which
is considered a core course for all IR majors.
Students are also required to take a class in U.S.
foreign relations, but no specific course is offered. The
Internatonal Relations Program also strongly recom
mends that students take at least one course in interna
tional economics. The committee suggested that a
>pecifie economics course_Ut.made part of the IR core.
'' Science Prof. David Aberncthy said that the•
IR program requires that students complete two years
of a foreign language and study overseas.

"If we add an economics requirement, does that mean
we have to add Economics 1 and 52. . . to what is already
a substantial course load?" Abernethy asked.
The committee proposed that some agreement be
made within the School of Humanities and Sciences to
make sure that courses needed by 1R majors are offered
on a regular basis through the several departments in
volved in the program.
The establishment of endowed chairs was recommend
ed to assure continued financial support of the program.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Norman Wessells ex
pressed concern about following the precedent set by
the Human Biology Program, another inter
departmental program, of creating endowed chairs to
fund departments. "1 don't think that is a model the
University should be following to fund department pro
grams," Wessells said.
Donors provide funds for an endowed chair within a
specific department which therefore places some respon
sibility on the University to maintain that particular de
partment. Provost Albert Hastorf, also concerned about
the University's responsibility to donors, said. "We hope
we won't be pushed into being terrib-
Iv specific about what those endowed
chairs will be. . . I like endowed chairs
in the social sciences rather than a
chair in American Historv IN6O-70."
The annual report of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies for
1982-83. which was also presented
yesterday to the Facultv Senate, rec
ommended to the provost that a
committee similar to that of the
Western Culture Program's be
formed for the Overseas Studies
Program.
Two years ago the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies organized an
ad hoc committee, chaired by Sociol
ogy Prof. Alex Inkclcs. to recom
mend administrative and
programmatic changes for the Over
seas Studies Program. The commit
tee's report to the provost did not
follow the recommendations of the
84-page ad hoc committee's program
report. The ad hoc committee recom
mended that the Faculty Senate es
tablish a standing Academic Council
Committee on Overseas Studies con
sisting of no more than five members
of the Academic Council, at least
one of them from the School of En
gineering and at least three from the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
as well as no more than two students
who have spent time at one of Stan
ford's overseas campuses or centers.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, last
year's chairman of the Committe on
Undergraduate Education, presented
his committee's differing view that,
rather than further breaking up the
administration of the Overseas Pro
gram by instituting several new
panels, the provost should organize a
program committee similar to that
now overseeing the Western Culture

Program. This committee would
report to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies, which would then
report to the Faculty Senate. The
Committe on Undergraduate Studies
did concur with the ad hoc commit
tee in endorsing the dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
rather than the provost — as the ad
ministrator responsible tor overseas
studies programs.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz ex
pressed the concern of several fac
ulty members that with the proposed
changes the Faculty Senate would be
losing some of its control over the
Overseas Studies Program. "The con
stitutional issue is important here
. . .the Senate has the right to ap
point a committee. ... II we concur
in this we abdicate that responsibil
ity," Rebholz said.
Assoc. Prof, of Philosophy Michael
Bratman responded. "No matter
what happens today tin Senate has
the light to establish a committee to
oversee the Overseas Studies Pro
gram. There's no abdication."
The programmatic changes the ad
hoc committee proposed will be con
sidered later this year by the present
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
Hastorf, reporting for University
President Donald Kennedy, who was
in Sacramento presenting Stanford
Noble Laureate Henry Taube to the
legislature, said at present the situa
tion of the Reagan library and policy
center is "in limbo."
"There is very little to report. . . .
Campus Report last week carried a
story which describes the content of
the letter the Board of Trustees
President Kimball sent to
(Presidential Adviser Edwin) Meese.
. . . As of noon we had no reply from
Meese. . .therefore it is exceedingly
doubtful the Board of Trustees will
have anything to discuss at their
meeting on Monday." Hastorf said.
