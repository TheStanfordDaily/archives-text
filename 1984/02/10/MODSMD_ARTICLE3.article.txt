The recommendation of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies to renew the International Relations
(IR) Program for another five years was unanimously
passed by the Faculty Senate yesterday afternoon. The
Committee did, however, express concern over the
future of the program.
The program's future existence was questioned be

made within the School of Humanities and Sciences to
make sure that courses needed by 1R majors are offered
on a regular basis through the several departments in
volved in the program.
The establishment of endowed chairs was recommend
ed to assure continued financial support of the program.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Norman Wessells ex
pressed concern about following the precedent set by
the Human Biology Program, another inter
departmental program, of creating endowed chairs to
fund departments. "1 don't think that is a model the
University should be following to fund department pro
grams," Wessells said.
Donors provide funds for an endowed chair within a
specific department which therefore places some respon
sibility on the University to maintain that particular de
partment. Provost Albert Hastorf, also concerned about
the University's responsibility to donors, said. "We hope
