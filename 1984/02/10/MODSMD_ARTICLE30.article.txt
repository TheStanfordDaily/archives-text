Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (AP) — Bonnie
Warner, the Cardinal in Sarajevo, took
eighth place in the luge at the Winter
Olympics yesterday.
Warner came out of Southern Cali
fornia to carry a flag at the last Winter
Olympics. Thousands of gut-wrenching
rides later she now spends her time
gliding a sled through the treacherous
curves of the luge course in a daredevil
race against time, and her success yes
terday shows that her persistence has
paid off.
"Maybe one in a thousand Califor
nians knows anything about the luge,"

Warner said. "1 was one of the 999 who
didn't."
In 19K0, Warner went to Lake Placid
as a torch bearer representing her home
state. "They needed us only for the
opening and closing ceremonies. In be
tween. I went to the events."
And in between the 19N0 and the
1984 Winter Olympics she found her
self learning the right way to lie on her
back on a sled tearing through a twisted
course down the side of a mountain.
She's gotten so good at it that yester
day in the first of the four required
runs in the Winter Olympics luge com
petition she finished eighth, the only

American in the top 10.
Warner, of Mount Baldy, Calif.,
doesn't expect to win a medal here, hut
is already looking ahead to the Calgary
Games of 19NN.
In 1980 she was a spectator, watching
the excitement of the hockey and
Heiden Olympics without ever getting
near the luge track.
When the Games were over. Warner
had a two-week gap before she had to
get hack to classes at Stanford. A
friend suggested that they investigate
the U.S. Luge Association camp, which
was scheduled immediately after the
Games at Lake Placid.
