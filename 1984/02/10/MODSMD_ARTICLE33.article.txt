# Burlingame hideaway: getting away from it all
## 
### Cathy Janus 
There has been an upsurge in
concern over stress and stress
causing situations lately, ex
pressed primarily on TV, in
magazines and in newspapers.
Last week one of my profes
sors even lectured on the sub
ject, saying there has been a
boom in stress since I^SO.
Here at Stanford, sheltered
from the harsher realities of
the outside world, students
can't get mentally worn from
too many worries tugging at
their mind. The solution is
simple: break out of the
routine. You don't have to
travel far to experience the
beauty and serenity of the
area, to free yourself from the

pressures of student life. In
fact, I think I discovered just
the place for weary students
and faculty to escape.
With the help of Jean
Brown, founder of Bed and
Breakfast International, I
found a quiet, scenic place not
too far from campus. She sug
gested a couple in Burlingame,
who have an arrangement for
guests which includes a
bedroom with twin beds, a sit
ting room with television, fold
out double bed, and most im
portantly, a splendid view of
the sprawling Bay Area which
lay before us.
Accomodations include a
private bath, refrigerator, cof

fee and tea, washer/drier
facilities, a private entrance
and breakfast as well.
While Burlingame itself is
not a thriving metropolis, it is
just IS miles from San Fran
cisco, and BART is con
veniently nearby for persons
who find it "stressful" to look
for parking in San Francisco.
And if you prefer to explore
the outdoors, the natural
beauty of the Crystal Springs
Reservoir area is just for you.
Arriving in Burlingame on
Friday evening, the residential
neighborhood was very peace
ful and picturesque with the
lights of the Bay Area illumi
nating the evening. My friend

and I wondered if our hosts,
the de Harts, would show us to
our room and then simply dis
appear. Mrs. de Hart came
outside to greet us and led us
through the atrium into their
living room. Alter a few
minutes of talking with Mrs.
de Hart and her husband, I
knew we could expect lively
tonversation from this delight
ful couple. Though we had
every opportunity to take our
leave and seclude ourselves in
our charming quarters, my
friend and I enjoyed their
dynamic personalities, and we
talked late into the night.
Whatever your interests:
politics, travel (the de Harts
immigrated from the Nether
lands), video tapes or art, you
can be sure the de Harts have
something to say. He is an avid
collector of video tapes, ran
ging from comedians Eddie
Murphy and Robin Williams to
documentaries and films. Their
artwork is extraordinary, in
cluding pictures of Dutch
flowers, Indonesian puppets
and tribal gifts collected
during de Hart's military ser
vice among the Naga Indians on
the borders of Burma and
Tibet.
The license plate on one of
their cars says "TO LIFE" and
it is an appropriate commen
tary on this couple, for they
truly love life and America,
despite some of the latter's
shortcomings, which they are
also quite willing to talk at
length about. The husband
claimed that one finds the
most spiritually aware people
in the Bay Area.
"Here as nowhere else,
people know who they are . . .
or let me say are attempting to
know themselves," he said. We
had been sitting on the patio
outside, enjoying the spring
like weather, and returned
inside to watch one of their
150 video tapes.
We had agreed to breakfast
at 10 a.m. the next morning.
After a good night's sleep, I
walked into the main part of

the house where I could smell
freshly squeezed orange juice. In
the kitchen, our hosts were
slicing ingredients for an
omelette; croissants were war
ming in the oven.
We couldn't have been more
content as we sat outside on
the patio again, this time bas
king in the morning sunshine
and eating breakfast. Con
versation flowed as naturally as
the evening before, and we
were soon engrossed in a con
versation about the beauty of
San Francisco and the Bay
Area.
Our weekend retreat, in
tended to reinvigorate, had
been wonderful and the icing

on the cake was the walk along
the Sawyer Camp Trail,
minutes away from the de
Hart's home.
Driving south on Highway
280, we exited at the Black
Mountain/Hayne Road turnoff
and parked in the already
crowded parking lot. The trail
is banned to motorized
vehicles; access is restricted to
bicyclists and persons on foot.
Couples jogged past, pushing a
stroller in front of them;
young and old alike negotiated
the seven-mile trail which over
looks Crystal Springs Reser
voir.
The de Hart's home is
convenient to all Peninsula

points, including Stanford.
Driving the short distance back
to campus, we felt refreshed
and happy, as if we'd been far
away.
Surprise a friend and treat
yourself to a weekend retreat.

people know who they are . . .
or let me say are attempting to
know themselves," he said. We
had been sitting on the patio
outside, enjoying the spring
like weather, and returned
inside to watch one of their
150 video tapes.
We had agreed to breakfast
at 10 a.m. the next morning.
After a good night's sleep, I
walked into the main part of

the house where I could smell
freshly squeezed orange juice. In
the kitchen, our hosts were
slicing ingredients for an
omelette; croissants were war
ming in the oven.
We couldn't have been more
content as we sat outside on
the patio again, this time bas
king in the morning sunshine
and eating breakfast. Con
versation flowed as naturally as
the evening before, and we
were soon engrossed in a con
versation about the beauty of
San Francisco and the Bay
Area.
Our weekend retreat, in
tended to reinvigorate, had
been wonderful and the icing

on the cake was the walk along
the Sawyer Camp Trail,
minutes away from the de
Hart's home.
Driving south on Highway
280, we exited at the Black
Mountain/Hayne Road turnoff
and parked in the already
crowded parking lot. The trail
is banned to motorized
vehicles; access is restricted to
bicyclists and persons on foot.
Couples jogged past, pushing a
stroller in front of them;
young and old alike negotiated
the seven-mile trail which over
looks Crystal Springs Reser
voir.
The de Hart's home is
convenient to all Peninsula

points, including Stanford.
Driving the short distance back
to campus, we felt refreshed
and happy, as if we'd been far
away.
Surprise a friend and treat
yourself to a weekend retreat.

Overlooking Crystal Springs Reservoir, joggers run on Sawyer Camp Trail.
There has been an upsurge in
concern over stress and stress
causing situations lately, ex
pressed primarily on TV, in
magazines and in newspapers.
Last week one of my profes
sors even lectured on the sub
ject, saying there has been a
boom in stress since I^SO.
Here at Stanford, sheltered
from the harsher realities of
the outside world, students
can't get mentally worn from
too many worries tugging at
their mind. The solution is
simple: break out of the
routine. You don't have to
travel far to experience the
beauty and serenity of the
area, to free yourself from the

pressures of student life. In
fact, I think I discovered just
the place for weary students
and faculty to escape.
With the help of Jean
Brown, founder of Bed and
Breakfast International, I
found a quiet, scenic place not
too far from campus. She sug
gested a couple in Burlingame,
who have an arrangement for
guests which includes a
bedroom with twin beds, a sit
ting room with television, fold
out double bed, and most im
portantly, a splendid view of
the sprawling Bay Area which
lay before us.
Accomodations include a
private bath, refrigerator, cof

fee and tea, washer/drier
facilities, a private entrance
and breakfast as well.
While Burlingame itself is
not a thriving metropolis, it is
just IS miles from San Fran
cisco, and BART is con
veniently nearby for persons
who find it "stressful" to look
for parking in San Francisco.
And if you prefer to explore
the outdoors, the natural
beauty of the Crystal Springs
Reservoir area is just for you.
Arriving in Burlingame on
Friday evening, the residential
neighborhood was very peace
ful and picturesque with the
lights of the Bay Area illumi
nating the evening. My friend

and I wondered if our hosts,
the de Harts, would show us to
our room and then simply dis
appear. Mrs. de Hart came
outside to greet us and led us
through the atrium into their
living room. Alter a few
minutes of talking with Mrs.
de Hart and her husband, I
knew we could expect lively
tonversation from this delight
ful couple. Though we had
every opportunity to take our
leave and seclude ourselves in
our charming quarters, my
friend and I enjoyed their
dynamic personalities, and we
talked late into the night.
Whatever your interests:
politics, travel (the de Harts
immigrated from the Nether
lands), video tapes or art, you
can be sure the de Harts have
something to say. He is an avid
collector of video tapes, ran
ging from comedians Eddie
Murphy and Robin Williams to
documentaries and films. Their
artwork is extraordinary, in
cluding pictures of Dutch
flowers, Indonesian puppets
and tribal gifts collected
during de Hart's military ser
vice among the Naga Indians on
the borders of Burma and
Tibet.
The license plate on one of
their cars says "TO LIFE" and
it is an appropriate commen
tary on this couple, for they
truly love life and America,
despite some of the latter's
shortcomings, which they are
also quite willing to talk at
length about. The husband
claimed that one finds the
most spiritually aware people
in the Bay Area.
"Here as nowhere else,
people know who they are . . .
or let me say are attempting to
know themselves," he said. We
