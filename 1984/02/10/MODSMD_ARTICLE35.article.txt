## 'Cathedral' built on new foundations Raymond Carver's new collection of stories is more conventional 
### ROBERT BASIL 
"Cathedral," bv Robert Carver,
Knopf, 228 pp.', $13.95.
Raymond Carver, this country's
host short story writer, has writ
ten recently that the late John
Gardner was his mentor — and
that stunned me.
Gardner, whose biography of
Chaucer was nailed with charges
of plagiarism, and whose book
"On Moral Fiction" was laughed
at, said that writing should teach
people how to be "good." He was
fond of attacking his peers —
people like Philip Roth and
Donald Barthelme — for being
"creepy," for their getting sicko
pleasure out of depicting the per
verse.
In essays. Carver agrees with his
former teacher: The writer, he
says, should bring readers "the
news." The writer should be a
friendly guy. The writer should
avoid "brutal experimentation."
But Carver's greatness — and I
do think his value is great and per
manent — depends on his ignoring
his own essays when he is writing
his stories. For his early books
show that Carver wrote from aes
thetic instinct, not from
Gardnerian ideas. While Gardner's
work invariably makes an end-run
straight to some hokey and dis
honest "salvation," Carver has
been truer to his materials.
And his best stories are the
creepy ones.
There's one in "Will You Please
Be Quiet Please": A waitress is
waiting on this very fat man and
takes wicked pleasure in refilling
his bread basket as often as possi
ble. even when he is so stuffed he
can hardly breathe. It is a Pen
tecostal moment for her. The
story's last sentence is, "My life is
going to change. I feel it."
And in "What We Talk About
When We Talk About Love,"
there is a story called "Popular
Mechanics," in which a husband is
leaving his wife. He wants to take
their baby with him. In a gruesome
allusion to the Solomon parable,
the couple plays tug-of-war with
the baby. The last two
paragraphs:
"But he would not let go. He
felt the baby slipping out of his
hands and he pulled back very
hard.
"//i this manner, the issue was

Carver's first collections were
widely lauded. But they were
lauded for narrow reasons: Carver
supposedly depicted desperate
lives of inarticulate people. His
tone was insistently somber and
his language had the clipped
rhythm of Hemingway.
But this view is only partly cor
rect. Indeed. Carver did not write
success stories. And his characters
wouldn't wax as supersubtle or in
tellectual as those created by the
New York School of Fictioneers
do. And his language was inherited
from Hemingway.
But most critics have failed to
notice what appears to me to be
the stories' chief effect: They are
riotously funny, in the same way
the relentless hopelessness ot a
Buster Keaton movie is. Also,
once we put academic biases where
they belong — in a dumpster
somewhere — we must also admit
that what comes out ot the
mouths of Carver's characters is
more expressive than what comes
out the mouths of Bellow's. Fur
thermore. once we acknowledge
Carver's debt to Hemingway, we
also see that the arena of Carver's
imagination is much wider than
Hemingway's bullring, and that
Carver has a far finer ear for
American dialogue.
When 1 saw, however, that Car
ver named his new collection
"Cathedral," I got suspicious —
and even confronted the lurid
possibility that perhaps Carver
has elected to carry Gardner's
mantle into his actual stories. In
some ways, I found out. Carver
lias. One story particularly il
lustrates this: "A Small Good
Thing," a revision of a story which
appeared in an earlier collection
under another title. In both
stories, a mother goes to a baker
and orders a special birthday cake
for her son. and in both stories her
son gets hit by a car a few
paragraphs later.
The first story ends with the
mother going home to take a
bath, while her son is in the hospi
tal in a coma. The phone rings and
it is the baker.
It is a wonderful effect: Carver
doesn't let you know what the
baker (who is no doubt angry that
his cake hasn't been picked up)
says, or what the mother says back
to him — or even if the little boy
survives. Carver has sped through

this story like a dart and left the
reader to fly over the narrative
precipice himself. That is, the rest
of the story the reader quite
simply must tell himself — he
must make himself create, and
hence implicate himself in, the
horrible awkwardness that must

inexorably follow what he has just
read.
But in the revision, all of this
fruitful empty space is printed
over, and you are told about their
conversation; Cprver lets the
baker eventually be confronted by
the couple, and the baker

apologizes, gives them free muf
fins, coffee and so forth.
These are ambitious rather than
compelling changes. For Carver is
bravely altering a form of writing
that has been for him a gold mine,,
but one which had threatened to
become incessant and finally a

self-parodv. In this revision, and in
the whole book, he is asking more
dI himselt. llis stories are longer
and often veer off from his
famouslv choppy rhythm to ex
plore more languid and self
conscious meditations.
But most of these changes end
up making Carver's stories more
conventional, unfortunately. As
the tempo of his prose has slowed.
Carver's plots take fewer sudden,
jarring flips. Replacing much ol
the surprise are those old standbys
foreshadowing and "get it?"
symbolism.
In the first version of "A Small
Good Thing," for example, the
mother gives the baker the order,
and that's it. In the revision. Car
ver has added a long paragraph in
which we read about mother's un
comfortable feelings toward him.
So when the baker makes the ugly
mistake of harrassing her later, his
ineptitude has already been intro
duced. and the reader's anxiety
and shock — the first version's
chief effects — have been extin
guished.
Even more disturbing to me is
the sentimentality which found
its way into "Cathedral." An ex
ample from the story I've been
focusing on: When the little hoy
gets hit by the car in the first ver
sion, his pal wonders whether or
not he should finish eating from
his bag of potato chips: in the
revision, the pal cries. Thus a plot
which, in the first telling, mag
nifies, in an absolutely deadpan
way, a hot flash of ineluctable
confusion, becomes in the revision
merely an uplifting moral lesson:
All of us, with our nice hearts, can
shake off those small humiliations
to make of them occasions for
new love and comunication be
cause, as John Gardner has told us,
we're all in this together.
But despite the misgivings I
have for "Cathedral" — which I
have perhaps unduly stressed here
— it is still a fine book, and many
of the stories are top-shelf. I ex
pect that the problems I've des
cribed are merely the slowing
down required to steer through
the aesthetic turn that Carver is
making. And of course I'd take
Carver's worst leavings over the
healthiest helpings of an Ozick,
Updike or Bellow anyday.

Carver's first collections were
widely lauded. But they were
lauded for narrow reasons: Carver
supposedly depicted desperate
lives of inarticulate people. His
tone was insistently somber and
his language had the clipped
rhythm of Hemingway.
But this view is only partly cor
rect. Indeed. Carver did not write
success stories. And his characters
wouldn't wax as supersubtle or in
tellectual as those created by the
New York School of Fictioneers
do. And his language was inherited
from Hemingway.
But most critics have failed to
notice what appears to me to be
the stories' chief effect: They are
riotously funny, in the same way
the relentless hopelessness ot a
Buster Keaton movie is. Also,
once we put academic biases where
they belong — in a dumpster
somewhere — we must also admit
that what comes out ot the
mouths of Carver's characters is
more expressive than what comes
out the mouths of Bellow's. Fur
thermore. once we acknowledge
Carver's debt to Hemingway, we
also see that the arena of Carver's
imagination is much wider than
Hemingway's bullring, and that
Carver has a far finer ear for
American dialogue.
When 1 saw, however, that Car
ver named his new collection
"Cathedral," I got suspicious —
and even confronted the lurid
possibility that perhaps Carver
has elected to carry Gardner's
mantle into his actual stories. In
some ways, I found out. Carver
lias. One story particularly il
lustrates this: "A Small Good
Thing," a revision of a story which
appeared in an earlier collection
under another title. In both
stories, a mother goes to a baker
and orders a special birthday cake
for her son. and in both stories her
son gets hit by a car a few
paragraphs later.
The first story ends with the
mother going home to take a
bath, while her son is in the hospi
tal in a coma. The phone rings and
it is the baker.
It is a wonderful effect: Carver
doesn't let you know what the
baker (who is no doubt angry that
his cake hasn't been picked up)
says, or what the mother says back
to him — or even if the little boy
survives. Carver has sped through

this story like a dart and left the
reader to fly over the narrative
precipice himself. That is, the rest
of the story the reader quite
simply must tell himself — he
must make himself create, and
hence implicate himself in, the
horrible awkwardness that must

inexorably follow what he has just
read.
But in the revision, all of this
fruitful empty space is printed
over, and you are told about their
conversation; Cprver lets the
baker eventually be confronted by
the couple, and the baker

apologizes, gives them free muf
fins, coffee and so forth.
These are ambitious rather than
compelling changes. For Carver is
bravely altering a form of writing
that has been for him a gold mine,,
but one which had threatened to
become incessant and finally a

self-parodv. In this revision, and in
the whole book, he is asking more
dI himselt. llis stories are longer
and often veer off from his
famouslv choppy rhythm to ex
plore more languid and self
conscious meditations.
But most of these changes end
up making Carver's stories more
conventional, unfortunately. As
the tempo of his prose has slowed.
Carver's plots take fewer sudden,
jarring flips. Replacing much ol
the surprise are those old standbys
foreshadowing and "get it?"
symbolism.
In the first version of "A Small
Good Thing," for example, the
mother gives the baker the order,
and that's it. In the revision. Car
ver has added a long paragraph in
which we read about mother's un
comfortable feelings toward him.
So when the baker makes the ugly
mistake of harrassing her later, his
ineptitude has already been intro
duced. and the reader's anxiety
and shock — the first version's
chief effects — have been extin
guished.
Even more disturbing to me is
the sentimentality which found
its way into "Cathedral." An ex
ample from the story I've been
focusing on: When the little hoy
gets hit by the car in the first ver
sion, his pal wonders whether or
not he should finish eating from
his bag of potato chips: in the
revision, the pal cries. Thus a plot
which, in the first telling, mag
nifies, in an absolutely deadpan
way, a hot flash of ineluctable
confusion, becomes in the revision
merely an uplifting moral lesson:
All of us, with our nice hearts, can
shake off those small humiliations
to make of them occasions for
new love and comunication be
cause, as John Gardner has told us,
we're all in this together.
But despite the misgivings I
have for "Cathedral" — which I
have perhaps unduly stressed here
— it is still a fine book, and many
of the stories are top-shelf. I ex
pect that the problems I've des
cribed are merely the slowing
down required to steer through
the aesthetic turn that Carver is
making. And of course I'd take
Carver's worst leavings over the
healthiest helpings of an Ozick,
Updike or Bellow anyday.

Raymond Carver, this country's
host short story writer, has writ
ten recently that the late John
Gardner was his mentor — and
that stunned me.
Gardner, whose biography of
Chaucer was nailed with charges
of plagiarism, and whose book
"On Moral Fiction" was laughed
at, said that writing should teach
people how to be "good." He was
fond of attacking his peers —
people like Philip Roth and
Donald Barthelme — for being
"creepy," for their getting sicko
pleasure out of depicting the per
verse.
In essays. Carver agrees with his
former teacher: The writer, he
says, should bring readers "the
news." The writer should be a
friendly guy. The writer should
avoid "brutal experimentation."
But Carver's greatness — and I
do think his value is great and per
manent — depends on his ignoring
his own essays when he is writing
his stories. For his early books
show that Carver wrote from aes
thetic instinct, not from
Gardnerian ideas. While Gardner's
work invariably makes an end-run
straight to some hokey and dis
honest "salvation," Carver has
been truer to his materials.
And his best stories are the
creepy ones.
There's one in "Will You Please
Be Quiet Please": A waitress is
waiting on this very fat man and
takes wicked pleasure in refilling
his bread basket as often as possi
ble. even when he is so stuffed he
can hardly breathe. It is a Pen
tecostal moment for her. The
story's last sentence is, "My life is
going to change. I feel it."
