"Never in all the years did he
play anybody's game hut his
own — he never lied, he never
faked, he never stooped," said
Lillian Hellman at her friend
Dashiell Hammett's funeral.
And yet, during the time the
author of "The Maltese Falcon"
and "The Thin Man" was unable
to write — the last 2H years of
his life — he was never without
a lie, a fanciful tale of the
work he was supposedly strug
gling through.
Not that Hellman was in any
way wrong. The whole fabric of
Hammett's life was woven of
contradiction and secrecy,
making the biographer's task
admit only of limited success.
Hammett will never stand
revealed before us, a fact that
biographer Diane Johnson
seems well aware of, and
resigned to.
Her solution seems to be to
make no pretense of revela
tion, to take as few stands as
possible, and to let the facts
and witnesses speak for them
selves. As she says in the ack
nowledgements, "I should ex
plain that passages which refer
to Hammett's thoughts or

feelings are based throughout
on (his) letters; I have not
ventured to imagine or invent
anything." If she had
succeeded in giving us a biog
raphy without invention or im
agination. she would surely be
the first, and I doubt that we
should thank her for it.
Instead, she has given us an
odd mixture. At times her nar
rative is so lacking in analysis as
to be morally offensive. "Elise

(De Viane) was, as events
proved, a real old-fashioned
girl," we are told. But what
were these events?
"One night after dinner at
his place, he knocked her
around a little. Sober, later,
this scared him. And now she
was charging him with assault
and asking for damages."
But later in the book, when
Hammett comes up against the

Great Red Scare and is
repeatedly brought to trial and
once jailed for six months,
Johnson is suddenly impas
sioned. "However pessimistic
his temperament," she tells us,
"he respected America too
much to see to what depths it
would yet sink."
It is here that she begins to
really care about her subject,
which, given Hammett, is not
altogether surprising.
If at the very height of his
career and his artistic produc
tion Johnson distances herself
from her subject, we can guess
that it is because Hammett
here is just not likable.
Readers of Lillian Hellman's
"An Unfinished Woman" will
expect to see a difficult man,
but the biography is, after all,
not being written by someone
who loved Hammett, and the
view presented here is definite
ly harsher.
Hammett drank and drank
and drank, and we are past the
days of glamorizing alcoholism.
He went through money at
such an amazing rate that the
writer's later destitution is less
pitiable that it might be, but
almost none of this money
seems to have gone to his wife
and children. He slept around
to a rather offensive degree.

not only expecting Hellman to
accept his affairs in theory,
hut to put up with the many
starlets and prostitutes lolling
about his hotel suites. Had I
stopped reading at this point, I
would certainly have disliked
Hammett.
I did keep reading and by the
end, almost against my will,
found myself liking him. The
change was brought about not
by his poverty and sickness, not
by his long struggle with
writer's block, not by his going
on the wagon, and not by his
persecution in the rabid anti
communism of the 19505. This
persecution of writers and ac
tors does arouse absolute in
dignation, but, since Hammett
was not writing, blacklisting
had far less effect on him than
it did on others. True, he was
sent to prison for six months,
but his stand in this case seems
so muddled and wrong-headed
that it is hard to sympathize
fully. (I suspect that this con
fusion may be Johnson's fault:
Hammett's position must have
had some merit, since Judge
[.earned Hand expressed agree
ment with it.)
In the end it was not
Johnson but Hammett himself

who changed my mind about
him. In the latter half of the
hook increasing numbers of his
letters, mostly to Hellmun and
to his daughter Jo, are offered.
Johnson and many others have
earlier described Hammett as
"charming," but the word
never seemed to fit. Now,
seeing him directly, the ad
jective gradually appears too
weak. These letters were his
only writing for many years,
and they are never empty of
thought and wit. In several he
is acting as informal editor of
his friend's work, the con
summate editor, in fact — Al
ways sensitive to the work, al
ways supportive on the larger
issues, but ruthless on points
of technique and organization.
My hope is that Lillian Hell
man, who is Hammett's
literary executor (and thus, by
the way, had virtual approval
over the book), will someday
grant us a look at his collected
letters.
