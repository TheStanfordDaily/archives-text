## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
On the eve of Asst. Prof. Diana Paul's hearings for
tenure with the School of Humanities and Sciences, a
student initiative has posed a new dimension to the ten
ure process.
Peter Simonson. a senior majoring in religious studies,
heads a small band of students seeking to galvanize sup
port for Paul's tight tor tenure. The group questions the
current level of student involvement in tenure cases.
"I understand that the tenure process requires con
fidentiality," Simonson said. "At the same time, 1 think
it only fair that the undergraduate population be
notified of upcoming tenure decisions and be given a
chance to voice its opinions."
Simonson, who has tacked up llyers all over campus
and petitions in the Center for Research on Women and
Soto House in Wilbur, timed his efforts to coincide with
an important period in Paul's struggle tor tenure. Paul
officially began the current level of appeals on Jan. 23
when she filed a formal grievance with NormanWessells,
dean of Humanities and Sciences. I he hearings should
begin in a lew weeks, under the leadership ot the
recently named grievance officer. Emeritus History
Prof. Gordon Craig.
The Religious Studies Department denied Paul tenure
a year ago. Paul, who has been with the department tor
eight years, appealed the department's decision, but the
five-member panel rejected her appeal. The panel did
not award Paul an "excellent" in either research or
teaching, although it assigned her a "very good" ranking
in the second category.
A candidate for tenure needs a ranking of "excellent
in at least one of the categories to receive a recommen
dation. ,
Simonson said the primary impetus 111 Ins gathering
support for Paul was his assessment of her dedication to
teaching.
"Diana Paul is a professor committed to undergradu

ate education," he said. "That's the kind ot person I
value at Stanford." Simonson said he served on the Reli
gious Studies Curriculum Committee with Paul, al
though he never took a class from her.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, who serves as Paul's
chief adviser, described student involvement as an im
portant aspect ot the case. He said the Religious Studies
Department, when reviewing Paul s case for tenure,
failed to contact three graduate students who worked
closely with the assistant professor in East Asian
Studies. Rebholz called the action a "mistake in proce
dure."
"The department should have been especially
scrupulous in ensuring that the procedures in her case
were absolutely correct," he added, given Paul s status as
a woman and as a member of a minority group. Paul is
partly Japanese.
Rebholz said the "appropriate level" of student in
volvement in a tenure case consists of letters of recom
mendation from students who had been taught by the
candidate.
In the instance of Paul. Rebholz advocated further
student involvement. Ihe students ot Soto House in
Wilbur, where Paul has served as a resident fellow for the
past five years, are lobbying for Paul's tenure by signing a
petition.
"It is entirely appropriate that residents in Soto
should testify to her qualities as a resident fellow," Reb
holz said. "One who is a resident fellow is also a teacher."
The flyer distributed by Simonson focuses on three is
sues. It describes Paul as an "outstanding teacher" who is
"interested in more than research.'" It also describes Paul
as a "woman in a male-dominated profession." The flyer
concludes by supporting more student involvement and
influence in the initial tenure decision.
Paul's main area of expertise is Chinese Buddhism. She
has written three books, the latest entitled. "Philosophy
of the Mind in Sixth Century China." It should arrive in
bookstores in about three months.
