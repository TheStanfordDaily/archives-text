### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
"Low Tech; fast furniture
for next to nothing," by
Rick Ball, illustrated by
Paul Cox, Dial Press,
$14.95, 219 pp.
This guide to building in
expensive furniture from
scavenged materials pro
vides the reader with expo
sure to a wide variety of
ideas that will incite him to
develop his own plans,
rather than giving him a set
of detailed formulas for
furniture that may not suit
his materials or needs.
"Low Tech" contains an
optimistic, enthusiastic
text that is accompanied by
numerous sketches showing
how castoff materials that
can be bought cheaply or
just picked up can be turned
into workable furnishings.
The book is divided into sec
tions on storage, lighting,
beds, seating, kitchens and
more, and there is a particu

larly helpful section at the
end on techniques and ma
terials.
The cheery tone of the
text is maintained in the
clear sketches of furniture
in the completed form or
under construction. The jol
lity does seem a little
strained occasionally,
though, especially when you
trv to imagine an entire

apartment decorated with
debris and flotsam. Though
the authors strive to make
their pieces attractive,
some of them just end up
seeming low budget or the
product of very odd tastes.
One wonders what kind of
Robinson Crusoe would
build a headboard for his
bed like the one illustrated
on page 144.

Aficionados of Monty
Python and other fans of
the humorous non sequitur

fanciful collection of brief
captions, frequently accom

Glen Baxter follows the

North of England, from

But as Baxter ages, so
