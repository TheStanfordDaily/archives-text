An American in Paris (1951)
Tresidder Union, Room 270
In a year that yielded A
Streetcar Named Desire, A Place
in the Sun and The African
Queen, the Academy Award for
Best Picture went to this sunny
M-G-M musical, written by
Alan Jay Lerner and directed by
Vincente Minnelli. The film was
built around the music of
George Gershwin (lyrics, of
course, by Ira), and though its
planned highlight, a 17-minute
ballet to the "American in
Paris" suite designed in the
styles of half a dozen Impres
sionist painters, is overloaded
and pretentious, the rest of it
is truly in the Gershwin spirit.
(The songs include " 'S Wonder
ful," "Tra-La-La," "I Got
Rhythm" and "By Strauss.")
Gene Kelly got the quintessen
tial Gene Kelly role as the
American painter in Paris; he
dances a memorable pas de deux
with Leslie Caron to "Love Is
Here to Stay." With Oscar
Levant, Nina Foch and Georges
Guetary, whose performance of
"I'll Build a Stairway to
Paradise" defines, as much as
Chevalier did in the 19305,
American audiences' notion of
French urbanity.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9.
West Side Story (1961)
Kresge Auditorium
Shakespeare's "Romeo and
Juliet" was the source for the fa
mous Arthur Laurents-Leonard
Bernstein-Stephen Sondhcim
play, here (almost literally)
transcribed by Ernest Lehman,
but it can't be said that he was
the inspiration: Popular as the
musical was (and still is), it's
really rather flat and i//iin
spired. If only Laurents and
Sondheim had looked at Shake
speare's language as well as his
plot! The dialogue and lyrics
(with the exception of
"America"and "Gee, Officer
Krupke") make Oscar Ham
merstein sound like Tennessee
Williams. As for the music —
where would Leonard Bernstein
be if it weren't for Aaron
Copland? Natalie Wood and
Richard Beymergive embarrass
ingly inept performances as the
lovers who represent rival New
York street gangs; the cast also
includes Russ Tamblyn. George
Chakiris and Rita Moreno.
Jerome Robbins' choreography
is impressive but slightly ab
surd, and Robert Wise's direc
tion matches it — its scale
seems to have been dictated by
Cecil B. DeMille. If you decided
you hated musicals after
watching this one. don't give up
on the genre — you may simply
hate had musicals.
Plays tonight at 9.

Breathless (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
A pointless, embarrassing
bomb. Jim Mcßride and his co
screenwriter, L.M. Kit Carson,
have retained much of Godard's
great 1960 film, one of the
first masterpieces of the
French New Wave, but in a new
pop cultural context that
diminishes it beyond recogni
tion. McBride is known for his
experimental films, but his first
feature looks like a perfume
commercial. Richard Gere and
Valerie Kaprisky pretend
they're standing in for Jean-
Paul Belmondo and Jean
Seberg.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.
A Man for All Seasons (1966)
Lagunita Dining Room; Madera
Lounge
Director Fred Zinnemann,
screenwriter Robert Bolt
(adapting his own play) and
Paul Scofield, in the role of Sir
Thomas More, in a sterling ex
ample of the tastefully boring.
With Wendy Hiller, Susannah
York, Orson Welles, Leo
McKern, Nigel Davenport, John
Hurt, Corin Redgrave, Robert
Shaw as Henry VIII, and
Vanessa Redgrave in a delec
table cameo as Anne Boleyn.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) at
7:30 and Tuesday (Madera) at
6:30.
Cria! (1977)
Cubberley Auditorium
Carlos Saura's film about a
disturbed childhood — beauti
fully made, with a textured
sensuousness, but finally not
terribly interesting. (A great
deal is hinted at and very little
actually said on the subject.)
Saura uses two amazing faces
for the camera — Geraldine
Chaplin's and young Ana Tor
rent's. (She plays the child
Chaplin once was.)
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Pumpkin Eater (1964)
History Corner 200-203
Harold Pinter adapted a
novel by Penelope Mortimer,
lending the screenplay all his in
telligence and little of his char
acteristic shrivelled wit.
(Pinterism emerges in only one
scene, in a beauty salon where a
perfect stranger approaching
the heroine moves from adula
tion to hostility in a couple of
minutes.) It's a beautiful, too
little-seen film, delicately di
rected (by Jack Clayton) and
impeccably acted. Anne
Bancroft and Peter Finch play

the couple whose marriage has
begun to curdle, and the excel
lent supporting cast includes
James Mason, Maggie Smith,
Cedric Hardwicke, Richard
Johnson and Eric Porter.
Plays Wednesday evening at
7.
Jules and Jim (1962)
Bishop Auditorium
Francois Truffaut's film
about the evanescence of love,
of dreams, of innocence; often
the tone is playful, as in
Godard's later Hai'l of Out
siders., which also spins around
the games shared by two men
and a woman, but this is a much
richer movie — it has the sub
stance of a long novel, and its
lyricism and esprit mask a
tragedy. Truffaut and Jean
Gruault based the picture on an
autobiographical novel by
Henri-Pierre Roche, a minor
figure from the Paris of the
'20s. Jeanne Moreau gives a leg
endary performance as Cath
erine, who tyrannizes her two
cavaliers (Oskar Werner and
Henri Serre) while bringing a
vividness to their lives without
which they seem a little dull.
Truffaut said of Moreau: "She
has all the attributes of a wo
man, together with all the
qualities one expects in a man,
with none of the incon
veniences of either." The film is
a masterpiece — and likely the
best movie released in the '60s
(with the possible exception of
L'Avventura).
Plays Wednesday evening at
7:30.
Practice Makes Perfect
(1980)
Cubberley Theatre (4000
Middlefield Road.), Palo Alto
Jean Rochefort gives a tri
umphant performance as a fa
mous pianist who is attempting
to balance a wife, an ex-wife, a
lover, several children, a concert
calendar and a social calendar in
this wonderful little film di
rected by Philippe De Broca
(who collaborated on the script
with Michel Audiard). The film
begins madly, like a Preston
Sturges comedy, but it is actu
ally bittersweet: It is the story
of a man who thinks of every
thing, but too late. The excel
lent cast includes Annie
Girardot, Nicole Garcia, Lila
Kedrova and. in an exquisite
small performance, the cele
brated French actress Danielle
Darrieux.
Plays Wednesday evening at
8.
The Black Stallion (1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Carroll Ballard has turned

Walter Farley's entertaining
children's book about a boy and
a horse into a work of poetry.
In the first half of the movie,
in which these two central fig
ures survive a shipwreck and live
and play on an island of which
they are the sole inhabitants,
their relationship has an inten
sity that is almost mystical; the
second half is structured like a
conventional horse race story —
say. National Velvet — but Bal
lard continues to see the events
through the boy's wide eyes,
and so the imagery is perhaps
more vivid than in almost any
other recent American movie.
The indescribably sumptuous
photography is by Caleb Des
chanel, and Carmine Coppola
wrote a lovely score. Kelly Reno
plays the boy, and in a come
back performance of astonish
ing depth and charm, Mickey
Rooney plays the one-time
jockey who teaches him how to
race. With Teri Garr and folk
singer Hoyt Axton as the par
ents, Michael Higgins and the
mysteriously gentle black actor
Clarence Muse, in his farewell
appearance. (His credits include
the early talkie Hearts in Dixie.)
Melissa Matheson, Jeanne
Rosenberg and William Witliff
wrote the screenplay.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
mornings.
Days of Heaven (1978)
Festival, Palo Alto
It looks like a masterpiece
(Nestor Almendros and Haskell
Wexler shot it. Jack Fisk super
vised the art direction) and it
sounds like a masterpiece
(experimental sound recording
makes the dialogue echo haunt
ingly) — but in Terrence
Malick's movie, set in the Mid
west in the 1910s, the charac
ters and plot take second place
to the compositions. As a
result, we're never sure exactly

what is happening or why, or
why we're supposed to care. It's
a movie about what gorgeous
effects talented people can
manage with camera and light
ing, but it's so static that you
don't retain much of it after
wards. With Richard Gere,
Brooke Adams, Sam Shepard
and Linda Manz (who must be
an acquired taste).
Plays through Wednesday
with Why Shoot the Teacher?
Another Thin Man (1939)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Frances Goodrich and Albert
Hackett were still writing the
"Thin Man" pictures by the
time this one was made; it was
the third in the series, and is
still quite entertaining, with
some witty dialogue. The script
sets up big shouting crisis scenes
and then wryly undercuts tnem.
The plot involves C. Aubrey
Smith, the trustee of Nora
Charles' (Myrna Loy's) father's 4
estate, who is being threatened
by a one-time employee, played
by a very young Sheldon
Leonard. The cast also includes
Otto Kruger as a dumb D.A.,
Nat Pendleton as a dumb cop,
Virginia Grey as Smith's pretty
daughter, Ruth Hussey as a
mysterious governess. Marjorie
Main as a landlady and. in a
cameo, Shep Howard. The
film's highlight is certainly the I
scene in which a group of ex- J
cons sing "Happy Boit'day tol
Youse" to William Powell and!
Myrna Loy's young son. W.S.
Van Dyke directed.
Plays Wednesday evening
with Song of the Thin Man.

Smith, the trustee of Nora
Charles' (Myrna Loy's) father's 4
estate, who is being threatened
by a one-time employee, played
by a very young Sheldon
Leonard. The cast also includes
Otto Kruger as a dumb D.A.,
Nat Pendleton as a dumb cop,
Virginia Grey as Smith's pretty
daughter, Ruth Hussey as a
mysterious governess. Marjorie
Main as a landlady and. in a
cameo, Shep Howard. The
film's highlight is certainly the I
scene in which a group of ex- J
cons sing "Happy Boit'day tol
Youse" to William Powell and!
Myrna Loy's young son. W.S.
Van Dyke directed.
Plays Wednesday evening
with Song of the Thin Man.

An American in Paris (1951)
Tresidder Union, Room 270
In a year that yielded A
Streetcar Named Desire, A Place
in the Sun and The African
Queen, the Academy Award for
Best Picture went to this sunny
M-G-M musical, written by
Alan Jay Lerner and directed by
Vincente Minnelli. The film was
built around the music of
George Gershwin (lyrics, of
course, by Ira), and though its
planned highlight, a 17-minute
ballet to the "American in
Paris" suite designed in the
styles of half a dozen Impres
sionist painters, is overloaded
and pretentious, the rest of it
is truly in the Gershwin spirit.
(The songs include " 'S Wonder
ful," "Tra-La-La," "I Got
Rhythm" and "By Strauss.")
Gene Kelly got the quintessen
tial Gene Kelly role as the
American painter in Paris; he
dances a memorable pas de deux
with Leslie Caron to "Love Is
Here to Stay." With Oscar
Levant, Nina Foch and Georges
Guetary, whose performance of
"I'll Build a Stairway to
Paradise" defines, as much as
Chevalier did in the 19305,
American audiences' notion of
French urbanity.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9.
West Side Story (1961)
Kresge Auditorium
Shakespeare's "Romeo and
Juliet" was the source for the fa
mous Arthur Laurents-Leonard
Bernstein-Stephen Sondhcim
play, here (almost literally)
transcribed by Ernest Lehman,
but it can't be said that he was
the inspiration: Popular as the
musical was (and still is), it's
really rather flat and i//iin
spired. If only Laurents and
Sondheim had looked at Shake
speare's language as well as his
plot! The dialogue and lyrics
(with the exception of
"America"and "Gee, Officer
Krupke") make Oscar Ham
merstein sound like Tennessee
Williams. As for the music —
where would Leonard Bernstein
be if it weren't for Aaron
Copland? Natalie Wood and
Richard Beymergive embarrass
ingly inept performances as the
lovers who represent rival New
York street gangs; the cast also
includes Russ Tamblyn. George
Chakiris and Rita Moreno.
Jerome Robbins' choreography
is impressive but slightly ab
surd, and Robert Wise's direc
tion matches it — its scale
seems to have been dictated by
Cecil B. DeMille. If you decided
you hated musicals after
watching this one. don't give up
on the genre — you may simply
hate had musicals.
Plays tonight at 9.

Breathless (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
A pointless, embarrassing
bomb. Jim Mcßride and his co
screenwriter, L.M. Kit Carson,
have retained much of Godard's
great 1960 film, one of the
first masterpieces of the
French New Wave, but in a new
pop cultural context that
diminishes it beyond recogni
tion. McBride is known for his
experimental films, but his first
feature looks like a perfume
commercial. Richard Gere and
Valerie Kaprisky pretend
they're standing in for Jean-
Paul Belmondo and Jean
Seberg.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.
A Man for All Seasons (1966)
Lagunita Dining Room; Madera
Lounge
Director Fred Zinnemann,
screenwriter Robert Bolt
(adapting his own play) and

ample of the tastefully boring.
With Wendy Hiller, Susannah
York, Orson Welles, Leo
McKern, Nigel Davenport, John
Hurt, Corin Redgrave, Robert
Shaw as Henry VIII, and
Vanessa Redgrave in a delec
table cameo as Anne Boleyn.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) at
7:30 and Tuesday (Madera) at
6:30.
Cria! (1977)
Cubberley Auditorium
Carlos Saura's film about a
disturbed childhood — beauti
fully made, with a textured
sensuousness, but finally not
terribly interesting. (A great
deal is hinted at and very little
actually said on the subject.)
Saura uses two amazing faces
for the camera — Geraldine
Chaplin's and young Ana Tor
rent's. (She plays the child
Chaplin once was.)
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Pumpkin Eater (1964)
History Corner 200-203
Harold Pinter adapted a
novel by Penelope Mortimer,
lending the screenplay all his in
telligence and little of his char
acteristic shrivelled wit.
(Pinterism emerges in only one
scene, in a beauty salon where a
perfect stranger approaching
the heroine moves from adula
tion to hostility in a couple of
minutes.) It's a beautiful, too
little-seen film, delicately di
rected (by Jack Clayton) and
impeccably acted. Anne
Bancroft and Peter Finch play

the couple whose marriage has
begun to curdle, and the excel
lent supporting cast includes
James Mason, Maggie Smith,
Cedric Hardwicke, Richard
Johnson and Eric Porter.
Plays Wednesday evening at
7.
Jules and Jim (1962)
Bishop Auditorium
Francois Truffaut's film
about the evanescence of love,
of dreams, of innocence; often
the tone is playful, as in
Godard's later Hai'l of Out
siders., which also spins around
the games shared by two men
and a woman, but this is a much
richer movie — it has the sub
stance of a long novel, and its
lyricism and esprit mask a
tragedy. Truffaut and Jean
Gruault based the picture on an
autobiographical novel by
Henri-Pierre Roche, a minor
figure from the Paris of the
'20s. Jeanne Moreau gives a leg
endary performance as Cath
erine, who tyrannizes her two
cavaliers (Oskar Werner and
Henri Serre) while bringing a
vividness to their lives without
which they seem a little dull.
Truffaut said of Moreau: "She
has all the attributes of a wo
man, together with all the
qualities one expects in a man,
with none of the incon
veniences of either." The film is
a masterpiece — and likely the
best movie released in the '60s
(with the possible exception of
L'Avventura).
Plays Wednesday evening at
7:30.
Practice Makes Perfect
(1980)
Cubberley Theatre (4000
Middlefield Road.), Palo Alto
Jean Rochefort gives a tri
umphant performance as a fa
mous pianist who is attempting
to balance a wife, an ex-wife, a
lover, several children, a concert
calendar and a social calendar in
this wonderful little film di
rected by Philippe De Broca
(who collaborated on the script
with Michel Audiard). The film
begins madly, like a Preston
Sturges comedy, but it is actu
ally bittersweet: It is the story
of a man who thinks of every
thing, but too late. The excel
lent cast includes Annie
Girardot, Nicole Garcia, Lila
Kedrova and. in an exquisite
small performance, the cele
brated French actress Danielle
Darrieux.
Plays Wednesday evening at
8.
The Black Stallion (1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Carroll Ballard has turned

Walter Farley's entertaining
children's book about a boy and
a horse into a work of poetry.
In the first half of the movie,
in which these two central fig
ures survive a shipwreck and live
and play on an island of which
they are the sole inhabitants,
their relationship has an inten
sity that is almost mystical; the
second half is structured like a
conventional horse race story —
say. National Velvet — but Bal
lard continues to see the events
through the boy's wide eyes,
and so the imagery is perhaps
more vivid than in almost any
other recent American movie.
The indescribably sumptuous
photography is by Caleb Des
chanel, and Carmine Coppola
wrote a lovely score. Kelly Reno
plays the boy, and in a come
back performance of astonish
ing depth and charm, Mickey
Rooney plays the one-time
jockey who teaches him how to
race. With Teri Garr and folk
singer Hoyt Axton as the par
ents, Michael Higgins and the
mysteriously gentle black actor
Clarence Muse, in his farewell
appearance. (His credits include
the early talkie Hearts in Dixie.)
Melissa Matheson, Jeanne
Rosenberg and William Witliff
wrote the screenplay.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
mornings.
Days of Heaven (1978)
Festival, Palo Alto
It looks like a masterpiece
(Nestor Almendros and Haskell
Wexler shot it. Jack Fisk super
vised the art direction) and it
sounds like a masterpiece
(experimental sound recording
makes the dialogue echo haunt
ingly) — but in Terrence
Malick's movie, set in the Mid
west in the 1910s, the charac
ters and plot take second place
to the compositions. As a
result, we're never sure exactly

what is happening or why, or
why we're supposed to care. It's
a movie about what gorgeous
effects talented people can
manage with camera and light
ing, but it's so static that you
don't retain much of it after
wards. With Richard Gere,
Brooke Adams, Sam Shepard
and Linda Manz (who must be
an acquired taste).
Plays through Wednesday
with Why Shoot the Teacher?
Another Thin Man (1939)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Frances Goodrich and Albert
Hackett were still writing the
"Thin Man" pictures by the
time this one was made; it was
the third in the series, and is
still quite entertaining, with
some witty dialogue. The script
sets up big shouting crisis scenes
and then wryly undercuts tnem.
The plot involves C. Aubrey
Smith, the trustee of Nora

what is happening or why, or
why we're supposed to care. It's
a movie about what gorgeous
effects talented people can
manage with camera and light
ing, but it's so static that you
don't retain much of it after
wards. With Richard Gere,
Brooke Adams, Sam Shepard
and Linda Manz (who must be
an acquired taste).
Plays through Wednesday
with Why Shoot the Teacher?
Another Thin Man (1939)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Frances Goodrich and Albert
Hackett were still writing the
"Thin Man" pictures by the
time this one was made; it was
the third in the series, and is
still quite entertaining, with
some witty dialogue. The script
sets up big shouting crisis scenes
and then wryly undercuts tnem.
The plot involves C. Aubrey
Smith, the trustee of Nora
Charles' (Myrna Loy's) father's 4
estate, who is being threatened
by a one-time employee, played
by a very young Sheldon
Leonard. The cast also includes
Otto Kruger as a dumb D.A.,
Nat Pendleton as a dumb cop,
Virginia Grey as Smith's pretty
daughter, Ruth Hussey as a
mysterious governess. Marjorie
Main as a landlady and. in a
cameo, Shep Howard. The
film's highlight is certainly the I
scene in which a group of ex- J
cons sing "Happy Boit'day tol
Youse" to William Powell and!
Myrna Loy's young son. W.S.
Van Dyke directed.
Plays Wednesday evening
with Song of the Thin Man.

An American in Paris (1951)
Tresidder Union, Room 270
In a year that yielded A
Streetcar Named Desire, A Place
in the Sun and The African
Queen, the Academy Award for
Best Picture went to this sunny
M-G-M musical, written by
Alan Jay Lerner and directed by
Vincente Minnelli. The film was
built around the music of
George Gershwin (lyrics, of
course, by Ira), and though its
planned highlight, a 17-minute
ballet to the "American in
Paris" suite designed in the
styles of half a dozen Impres
sionist painters, is overloaded
and pretentious, the rest of it
is truly in the Gershwin spirit.
(The songs include " 'S Wonder
ful," "Tra-La-La," "I Got
Rhythm" and "By Strauss.")
Gene Kelly got the quintessen
tial Gene Kelly role as the
American painter in Paris; he
dances a memorable pas de deux
with Leslie Caron to "Love Is
Here to Stay." With Oscar
Levant, Nina Foch and Georges
Guetary, whose performance of
"I'll Build a Stairway to
Paradise" defines, as much as
Chevalier did in the 19305,
American audiences' notion of
French urbanity.
Plays tonight at 7 & 9.
West Side Story (1961)
Kresge Auditorium
Shakespeare's "Romeo and
Juliet" was the source for the fa
mous Arthur Laurents-Leonard
Bernstein-Stephen Sondhcim
play, here (almost literally)
transcribed by Ernest Lehman,
but it can't be said that he was
the inspiration: Popular as the
musical was (and still is), it's
really rather flat and i//iin
spired. If only Laurents and
Sondheim had looked at Shake
speare's language as well as his
plot! The dialogue and lyrics
(with the exception of
"America"and "Gee, Officer
Krupke") make Oscar Ham
merstein sound like Tennessee
Williams. As for the music —
where would Leonard Bernstein
be if it weren't for Aaron
Copland? Natalie Wood and
Richard Beymergive embarrass
ingly inept performances as the
lovers who represent rival New
York street gangs; the cast also
includes Russ Tamblyn. George
Chakiris and Rita Moreno.
Jerome Robbins' choreography
is impressive but slightly ab
surd, and Robert Wise's direc
tion matches it — its scale
seems to have been dictated by
Cecil B. DeMille. If you decided
you hated musicals after
watching this one. don't give up
on the genre — you may simply
hate had musicals.
Plays tonight at 9.

Breathless (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
A pointless, embarrassing
bomb. Jim Mcßride and his co
screenwriter, L.M. Kit Carson,
have retained much of Godard's
great 1960 film, one of the
first masterpieces of the
French New Wave, but in a new
pop cultural context that
diminishes it beyond recogni
tion. McBride is known for his
experimental films, but his first
feature looks like a perfume
commercial. Richard Gere and
Valerie Kaprisky pretend
they're standing in for Jean-
Paul Belmondo and Jean
Seberg.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.
A Man for All Seasons (1966)
Lagunita Dining Room; Madera
Lounge
Director Fred Zinnemann,
screenwriter Robert Bolt
(adapting his own play) and
Paul Scofield, in the role of Sir
Thomas More, in a sterling ex
ample of the tastefully boring.
With Wendy Hiller, Susannah
York, Orson Welles, Leo
McKern, Nigel Davenport, John
Hurt, Corin Redgrave, Robert
Shaw as Henry VIII, and
Vanessa Redgrave in a delec
table cameo as Anne Boleyn.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) at
7:30 and Tuesday (Madera) at
6:30.
Cria! (1977)
Cubberley Auditorium
Carlos Saura's film about a
disturbed childhood — beauti
fully made, with a textured
sensuousness, but finally not
terribly interesting. (A great
deal is hinted at and very little
actually said on the subject.)
Saura uses two amazing faces
for the camera — Geraldine
Chaplin's and young Ana Tor
rent's. (She plays the child
Chaplin once was.)
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The Pumpkin Eater (1964)
History Corner 200-203
Harold Pinter adapted a
novel by Penelope Mortimer,
lending the screenplay all his in
telligence and little of his char
acteristic shrivelled wit.
(Pinterism emerges in only one
scene, in a beauty salon where a
perfect stranger approaching
the heroine moves from adula
tion to hostility in a couple of
minutes.) It's a beautiful, too
little-seen film, delicately di
rected (by Jack Clayton) and
impeccably acted. Anne
Bancroft and Peter Finch play

the couple whose marriage has
begun to curdle, and the excel
lent supporting cast includes
James Mason, Maggie Smith,
Cedric Hardwicke, Richard
Johnson and Eric Porter.
Plays Wednesday evening at
7.
Jules and Jim (1962)
Bishop Auditorium
Francois Truffaut's film
about the evanescence of love,
of dreams, of innocence; often
the tone is playful, as in
Godard's later Hai'l of Out
siders., which also spins around
the games shared by two men
and a woman, but this is a much
richer movie — it has the sub
stance of a long novel, and its
lyricism and esprit mask a
tragedy. Truffaut and Jean
Gruault based the picture on an
autobiographical novel by
Henri-Pierre Roche, a minor
figure from the Paris of the
'20s. Jeanne Moreau gives a leg
endary performance as Cath
erine, who tyrannizes her two
cavaliers (Oskar Werner and
Henri Serre) while bringing a
vividness to their lives without
which they seem a little dull.
Truffaut said of Moreau: "She
has all the attributes of a wo
man, together with all the
qualities one expects in a man,
with none of the incon
veniences of either." The film is
a masterpiece — and likely the
best movie released in the '60s
(with the possible exception of
L'Avventura).
Plays Wednesday evening at
7:30.
Practice Makes Perfect
(1980)
Cubberley Theatre (4000
Middlefield Road.), Palo Alto
Jean Rochefort gives a tri
umphant performance as a fa
mous pianist who is attempting
to balance a wife, an ex-wife, a
lover, several children, a concert
calendar and a social calendar in
this wonderful little film di
rected by Philippe De Broca
(who collaborated on the script
with Michel Audiard). The film
begins madly, like a Preston
Sturges comedy, but it is actu
ally bittersweet: It is the story
of a man who thinks of every
thing, but too late. The excel
lent cast includes Annie
Girardot, Nicole Garcia, Lila
Kedrova and. in an exquisite
small performance, the cele
brated French actress Danielle
Darrieux.
Plays Wednesday evening at
8.
The Black Stallion (1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Carroll Ballard has turned

Walter Farley's entertaining
children's book about a boy and
a horse into a work of poetry.
In the first half of the movie,
in which these two central fig
ures survive a shipwreck and live
and play on an island of which
they are the sole inhabitants,
their relationship has an inten
sity that is almost mystical; the
second half is structured like a
conventional horse race story —
say. National Velvet — but Bal
lard continues to see the events
through the boy's wide eyes,
and so the imagery is perhaps
more vivid than in almost any
other recent American movie.
The indescribably sumptuous
photography is by Caleb Des
chanel, and Carmine Coppola
wrote a lovely score. Kelly Reno
plays the boy, and in a come
back performance of astonish
ing depth and charm, Mickey
Rooney plays the one-time
jockey who teaches him how to
race. With Teri Garr and folk
singer Hoyt Axton as the par
ents, Michael Higgins and the
mysteriously gentle black actor
Clarence Muse, in his farewell
appearance. (His credits include
the early talkie Hearts in Dixie.)
Melissa Matheson, Jeanne
Rosenberg and William Witliff
wrote the screenplay.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
mornings.
Days of Heaven (1978)
Festival, Palo Alto
It looks like a masterpiece
(Nestor Almendros and Haskell
Wexler shot it. Jack Fisk super
vised the art direction) and it
sounds like a masterpiece
(experimental sound recording
makes the dialogue echo haunt
ingly) — but in Terrence
Malick's movie, set in the Mid
west in the 1910s, the charac
ters and plot take second place
to the compositions. As a
result, we're never sure exactly

what is happening or why, or
why we're supposed to care. It's
a movie about what gorgeous
effects talented people can
manage with camera and light
ing, but it's so static that you
