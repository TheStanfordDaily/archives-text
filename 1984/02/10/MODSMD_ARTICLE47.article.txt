# Beermeister Coors trumpets capitalism, raps public ignorance

### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
William Coors, chairman and
chief executive officer of the
Adolph Coors Co.. said yesterday
that most Americans do not un
derstand the free enterprise sys
tem.
"Money doesn't grow on trees,"
Coors said, "It is incumbent on
any society to create a system
that provides for the greatest
possible productivity. There isn't
one person in a hundred that has
any conception of that."
The 67-year-old brewer told an
audience of 400 at the Graduate
School of Business that increased
productivity is the key to raising
living standards.
"The greater the gross national
product, the greater the purchas
ing power," Coors said. "It is a
very difficult thing to get across
to people that there is no such
thing as a free lunch. There is a
gross intellectual vacuum in our
society.
"People don't understand fun
damental. rudimentary economics.
High school students and some
college students aren't learning
it,"he said.
A Gallup Poll taken in 1976
found that most Americans think
large corporations make annual
profits of 33 percent, he said.
Corporations are lucky to earn a
5 percent profit rate in a year.
Coors said.
"The perception of corporate
profits is almost seven times
greater than reality,'" he said.
"Therefore. American business is

perceived as the greatest rip-off
ever. A survey showed that 6N
percent of people polled would
vote the tree market system out
of existence if they had the
chance."
As Americans learn more about
free enterprise they will realize
that it is the best economic sys
tem. Coors said.
"The free market has got all
kinds of faults," he said. "But
when you consider the alterna
tives, we are stuck with it. What
can we point to as a successful al
ternative ? It doesn't exist."
Socialism is impractical because
it stifles competition, Coors said.
Polish workers are frustrated
with the inability of their
country's socialistic system to
meet their needs, he said. "There
isn't a successful example of
socialism."
Coors defended James Watt,
the controversial former secretary
of the interior and a friend of the
Coors family.
"I think Watt's policies were
not that far off course." he said.
"James was just a victim of very
poor press. He had all kinds of
people who were looking for a way
to embarrass him —and he cer
tainly obliged them any way he
possibly could."
Coors got a hearty round of ap
plause when he extolled beer, the
product that his company sells in
the free market.
"People who drink two or three
cans of beer a day actually enjoy a
better state of health than
people who don't drink at all," he
said.
