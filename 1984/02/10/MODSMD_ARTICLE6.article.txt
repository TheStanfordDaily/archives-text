### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
"In the news business, profits are
everything: all else stems from the
profit margin." So says Bob
Hodierne. the associate news direc
tor for coverage for San Francisco's
K RON-TV.
Hodierne was one of three guests
who spoke last night in Rinconada
House on "The Corporate Media:
Financial Forces Behind the Media.
Also speaking were Janice Shaffer, a
business writer for the Philadelphia
Inquirer and Stanford Economics
Prof. James Rosse. About a dozen
students attended the discussion.
The major topic of conversation
was the rising number ol newspaper
chains, and how the chains' concern
for profits affects the news covered
b\ their local affiliates.
"Successful chains find \va\s ot
leaving decision-making at the local
level and therebv keeping a close con

nection with the community," said
Shaffer. "While in the smaller chains
owners often demand one editorial
policy, the major chains have limited
control over the editorial product.
Chains such as Knight-Kidder do not
dictate the policy of their papers di
rectly. The decisions are made on the
local level."
While Shaffer's comments indicate
little restriction on news coverage by
chains. Hodierne would disagree.
"The chains have a severe screening
process for their employees which
results in interchangeable editors and
a unanimity ot thought that runs
throughout all of their papers."
Hodierne said.
"The chains are very careful who
they put in charge. As a result, they
do not need to send directives to
their papers concerning policy be
cause the\ have already picked the
players involved.' Hodierne said.
"The major concern tor chain

newspapers is 'cost justified, whe
ther or not a decision will pay for it
self. Moral obligation is the last
thinu considered. I hus. the papers all
become highly profitable clones
where profits overshadow news
reporting, he added.
All three guests agreed that the

greatest economic pressure on big
city papers is the diversity of the
suburban papers vying for the same
subscribers. This pressure has resulted
in a new approach for many papers.
"The papers are building a mass au
dience by adding bits and pieces to
their coverage: more features, enter
tainment. and food sections and less
hard news." Rosse said.
The most obvious example of this
is Gannett*s USA Today, a national
paper presenting a new format in
reporting. ""USA Today is rattling
some editors because it is presenting
news in an appealing way. with color
ful graphs and illustrations that
make the articles easier to read."
Shaffer said.
"USA Today is good for the indus
try it it means better-looking papers.
The jury is still out on its ultimate
success or failure, but its impact is
already felt in the industry," she
added.'
