No withdrawal time set
Santa Barbara, Calif. — President Reagan has not decided
when to withdraw most of the remaining U.S. Marines at
the Beirut Airport, his spokesman said yesterday, heighten
ing speculation they could remain there for several months.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes, here with the
vacationing president, also altered the official rationale for
American shelling of Moslem militia positions in Syrian-held
territory, declaring that the bombardments are meant
solely to protect American troops and other units of the
multinational peacekeeping force and not to help the splin
tered Lebanese army, as administration officials previously
had stated.
1 he distinction is important politically, because the ad
ministration has concluded that the congressional resolu
tion authorizing deployment of U.S. forces in Lebanon
probably does not permit their use on the Lebanese army's
behalf.
France disavows protection,
introduces U.N. resolution
Paris — A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said yes
terday that f-ranee had not asked any other country for as
sistance in protecting its multinational force contingent in
Beirut, and privately French officials sharply criticized
Wednesday's massive U.S. shelling of targets in Syrian
controlled territory.
President Reagan's statements Tuesday that U.S. naval
ships and warplanes could continue to serve as a shield for
what is left of the multinational force in Beirut even after
the Marines are moved offshore have been greeted with
embarrassment here.
French officials say they fear that such promises of
"protection" can only undermine efforts to draw a distinc
tion between their own Middle East policies and those
pursued by Washington.
Syria may support Gemayel
Damascus, Syria — President Hafez Assad conferred yes
terday with Lebanese opposition leaders amid hints that
Syria tnav find it useful to preserve a Lebanese government
under the greatly weakened presidency of Amin Gemayel.
Buoyed by the sudden collapse of the Lebanese army and
the abrupt U.S. decision to remove the Marines from
Beirut, Syria appears to believe that Gemayel now has little
choice but to accept its conditions, including the abroga
tion of the controversial 1983 accord between Israel and
Lebanon.
For the time being, it is unclear exactly what Assad
wants, although diplomats here speculate he is more inter
ested in ensuring that Lebanon is run by men friendly to
Damascus than in reforming its institutions as Lebanese
Moslems have been demanding for years.
State Senate reverses itself,
welcomes Soviet athletes
Sacramento — The state Senate changed its mind yester
day and welcomed the Russians to the summer Olympic
games in Los Angeles.
Sen. Ken Maddy, the Republican from Fresno, said the
senators hadn't known what iTiey were doing when they
voted for a resolution last September that condemned the
Soviet attack on a South Korean airliner and called for ex
pulsion of Russia from the Olympics.
Maddy said that resolution had been approved in the end
of-session crush, and nobody had pointed out that the
anti-Russian language had been inserted in the Assembly.
Maddy's SJR37 says ' Resolved . . . that the Legislature
of the State of California welcomes all nations to partici
pate m the 1984 Summer Olvmpic Games." It was approved
30-1.
Sen. John Doolittle, the Republican from Sacramento
and author of the earlier resolution cast the no vote.
Astronauts repeat spacewalk
Kennedy Space Center, Ha. — Despite problems with
some of the equipment they were to test, two free-flying
astronauts from the space shuttle Challenger ventured ou6
again yesterday and, amid jet-powered somersaults and
rolls, paved the way for the satellite repair that is to high
light the next shuttle flight.
In a mission that has been plagued by failures, the two
days of untethered spacewalks by Bruce McCandless and
Robert Stewart stood out as important successes.
As on Tuesday, when they first tried out their gas
powered backpacks, the astronauts sent back breathtaking
television pictures on their activities as human satellites
1 72 miles above the earth.
Guerillas attack in El Salvador
Atiocoyo, El Salvador — Leftist guerrillas reopened a
western war front with unexpected strength and dealt a
new blow to the Salvadoran army here Wednesday by over
running an army post and killing 29 soldiers and civil defense
guards, military officials said.
In the first major attack in El Salvador's western prov
ince in several months, a force estimated by Salvadoran
army officials at between 500 and 600 guerrillas over
whelmed government troops guarding this farm cooperative
community some 40 miles northwest of San Salvador in a
nine-hour battle.
Armed with heavy machineguns and mortars, the guerril
las of the Popular Liberation Forces killed 23 soldiers and
six local civil defense guards dug into trenches around the
community church and an adjacent crossroads, military of
ficials said. One soldier and 26 guards were taken prisoner
by the insurgents, according to two wounded guards
released here yesterday.
Military analysts said the attack reinforced a recent
trend of large-scale operations by guerrillas operating in
battalion-sized units and seeking to inflict maximum
damage and casualties in single blows. In recent months
leftist forces have avoided small-scale skirmishing and
launched major attacks on two army barracks and a strate
gic suspension bridge on the Pan-American Highway.
According to accounts here, army forces reacted slowly
to the latest guerrilla assault. Although the fighting began
at about midnight Tuesday, U.S.-supplied helicopters
bearing reinforcements did not arrive here until around
noon Wednesday, some two hours after the government
forces had surrendered and the guerrillas had left town, sol
diers and residents said.
Stocks continue selloff
New York — The stock market limped lower in heavy
trading yesterday, extending its steep selloff, despite a cal
ming message to Wall Street from the chairman of the
Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones average ol 30 industrial stocks, which
plunged 24.19 points Wednesday in its biggest drop in more
than 15 months, slipped another 3.56 points to wind up yes
terday's seesaw session at 1 152.74.
