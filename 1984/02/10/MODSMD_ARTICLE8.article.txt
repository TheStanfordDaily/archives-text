### 
From The Daily wire services
U.S. warships that shelled the hills east of Beirut
on Wednesday went beyond President Reagan's an
nounced aim and attacked some rebel gun replace
ments that had not fired. Pentagon officials
confirmed yesterday.
The action, which sources said amounted to pre
emptive strikes, indicated an even greater commit
ment of U.S. military force than was previousl\
stated.
The disclosure could add fresh fuel to the contro
versy surrounding Reagan's new policy to provide
naval gunfire and air support "against any units firing
into greater Beirut from parts of Lebanon controlled
by Syria" as well as against those directly attacking
the multinational peacekeeping force.
In fact. U.S. bombardments, consisting of more
than 550 shells, many of them 16-inch shells fired b\
the battleship USS New Jersey, was not directly
"responsive" hut was intended to destroy military in
frastructure as well as gun batteries.
Military officials said that many of the 15 Druse
and Syrian targets had been pre-selected on previous
reconnaissance. Among them were artillery emplaee

ments. ammunition dumps, a barracks area, fuel
depots, a motorpool area and a command-and-control
bunker possibly manned by Syrians and used to coor
dinate artillery strikes.
Ol the gun emplacements targeted, "some were
not actually firing." a Pentagon spokesman said. He
said that these were in the vicinity of those that had
been firing. According to unconfirmed reports, one
target hit and destroyed was a Syrian artillery brigade
headquarters.
There were no reports that U.S. Marines serving
with the multinational peacekeeping force had come
under fire at their positions at the Beirut Airport.
Meanwhile, another 150 Marines were withdrawn
to ships of the U.S. 6th fleet offshore, sources said,
joining 253 Marine support troops who had been
ferried to the ships on Wednesday. Slightly more than
1000 Marines remain at the airport.
U.S. officials have announced no plans for evacua
tion of the estimated 1350 private American citizens
here, although some nonessential U.S. embassy per
sonnel and their dependents have been withdrawn.
While there were no signs of panic in the capital
vesterdav. there was an air of tension in the lareelv

Moslem western sector, which was seized by Shia and
Druse militiamen on Monday. There was lighting be
tween the Moslem militia and the Lebanese army
along the so-called Cireen Line that separates West
and East Beirut, but downtown West Beirut was
shaken only b\ the uncertainty of militia control.
Nabih Berri. leader ol the Shia Moslems' Amal
militia, vowed to clear gunmen from the streets of
the city within the next 24 hours.
Machine-gun-toting militiamen broke into homes
and shops in the aftermath of the fighting, during
which control of West Beirut was wrested from the
Lebanese army on Monday. Berri said he would not
tolerate incidents such as those Wednesday in which
fundamentalist Moslem gunmen shot up bars and
stores that sell liquor.
â€¢ Berri knows that he has to immediately restore
some kind of stability or the whole thing will fall
apart." said a Lebanese political analyst.
So far. however, there has been no move by the
army to try to retake the Moslem sector, nor any
move by the Shia and Druse militias to extend their
control.
