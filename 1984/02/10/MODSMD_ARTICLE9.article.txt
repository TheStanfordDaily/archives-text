# Congressmen question Lebanon decision

### 
From The Washington Post
Damascus â€” Though applauded for
its decision to remove U.S. Marines
from Beirut and put them aboard ships
offshore, the Reagan administration
yesterday encountered sharp question
ing on the continuing U.S. role in
Lebanon, its heavy shelling of targets
around the city and its candor with
Congress in the days before the
withdrawal was announced.
Republicans joined Democrats in ex
pressing their unhappiness as the ad
ministration sent Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger, Secretary of State
George Shultz and Deputy Secretary of

State Kenneth Dam to Capitol Hill to
discuss the withdrawal plans and the
fleet's shelling of targets onshore.
Sen I any Pressler (R-S.D.) a mem
ber of the Senate Foreign Relation
Committee called the heavy shelling
Wednesday a violation of the War
Powers Act and said that he would sup
port a congressional move to force a
speedup of the withdrawal.
Rep. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), the
House Republican whip, said he had
told Dam that the administration was
"not in touch with reality" in its
withdrawal plan, which has no fixed
date for the Marines to move to ships

offshore.
And Rep. William Broomfield, (R-
Mich.), the ranking member of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee,
told Weinberger and Shultz, "Many of
us are deeply concerned about the
amount of shelling that went on yes
terday,"and he said that if it continues
he fears that the United States could
wind up in even deeper difficulty.
Meanwhile, the administration pre
sented conflicting accounts that did
not clarify to the satisfaction of law
makers the events leading up to the or
der Tuesday to withdraw the Marines or
the justification for the heavy naval

shelling of targets around Beirut.
House Democrats assailed the admin
istration tor what they considered a
lack of candor.
They were most irked hy a comment
by the president last week that House
Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill. (D-
Mass.). who had been calling for the
removal of the Marines from Lebanon,
"may be ready to surrender."
According to accounts since given by
White House spokesman Larry Speakes
and other administration officials, the
decision to move the troops offshore
had been under serious consideration
since Jan. 2 1.
