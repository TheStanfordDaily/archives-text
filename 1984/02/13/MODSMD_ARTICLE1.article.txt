# No major policy changes foreseen
## Experts say Chernenko likely to succeed Andropov 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
Experts here said they do not forsee any
major changes in Soviet policies as a result of
President Yuri Andropov's death Thursday,
and they generally agreed that second
ranking party secretary Konstantin Cher
nenko is most likely to succeed the Soviet
leader.
"Whoever is selected, I would not expect
any important changes either at home or
abroad in the forseeable future," said Politi
cal Science Prof. Jan Triska.
An announcement is expected today after
a meeting of the 300-member Central Com
mittee.
Hoover Institution Senior Research Fel
low Robert Conquest said that a new leader
may bring a more constructive political style
than the "inflexible" Andropov.
"It is possible that there might be a slight
improvement (in Soviet-American rela
tions)," Conquest said. "Andropov was the
sort of guy who thought he could solve all
the problems by confrontation."
None of the potential leaders appears to
have the political base to push through
major policy changes, Conquest said.
Experts said it appears unlikely that a
younger lower-ranking member of the Polit
buro such as Grigory Romanov, 61, or Mik
hail Gorbachev, 52, would be able to grab the
top post. They said an older member of the

12-man committee such as Chernenko, 72, or
Viktor Grishin, 69, would probably take
power at least as a transition leader who
would pursue policies similar to Andropov's.
Conquest said that neither Romanov nor
Gorbachev, the two younger Politburo mem
bers considered most likely to get the top
post, "would have the power to do anything
at this time," if they were selected as gen
eral secretary.
If Chernenko is selected, he will probably
only act a "caretaker" of previous Soviet
policies, said Asst. Political Science Prof.
Condoleezza Rice.
"The Politburo would continue cautious
policies," she said.
Chernenko has recently been honored by
being chosen as funeral chairman for the
ceremonies tomorrow and by having his
lifetime pronouncements published in
Pravda last week, the experts noted.
"He has ( received special treatment, ' said
Hoover Institution Senior Research Fellow
Robert Wesson.
Younger Politburo members might also be
lobbying for an older leader, hoping that his
tenure will not last very long so they can
have time to increase their own power during
the next few years, the experts said.
"If you are a Romanov or a (60-year old
Geidar) Aliyev, you might not want a Gor
bachev," Rice said. "This would give yourself

time to build a coalition so that you can take
power."
Wesson said that it was unlikely that
younger leaders such as Romanov and Gor
bachev would have been kept in their current
lower-ranking Politburo positions during
Andropov's illness if they were in line to
take power.
Wesson also said that the older leaders
probably want to keep the leadership post in
their hands because "as the older generation
gets older, they probably feel more inse
cure."
"But this can't go on for more than five
to seven years," he said.
At that time, the Soviets will probably
have to choose one of the younger leaders
who might bring important changes to So
viet policy, the experts said.
Conquest said the apparent delay in the
announcement of a new leader, which was
originally expected yesterday, may indicate
continued difficulties in the power struggle.
"It's odd that they haven't chosen some
body yet," he said.
But Triska said that the leadership post
has probably already been handed out be
cause Politburo members had some time to
make deals while Andropov was ill.
"There must have been some realization
on the part of the leadership that he was
dying, so I would assume that all those kinds

of deals have already taken place," Triska
said.
Experts emphasized that it is difficult to
make any predictions about leadership
changes in the Soviet Union because so little
information is available.

"Nobody has a very great power of predic
tion because we don't even know how they
make their decisions," said Hoover Institu

tion Visiting Scholar Arnold Beichman.
During the past few months when
Andropov was ill, "we didn't even know who
was at the other end of the hot line," Beich
man said.
Experts singled out Gorbachev and
Romanov as the two younger Politburo
members with the best shot at the top post
in the next few years.
Gorbachev, reportedly Anropov's closest
ally with responsibility for agriculture,
recently became involved in the job of re
shuffling regional leaders while Romanov, an
agricultural specialist and Leningrad leader
for 12 years, joined the Secretariat only last
summer and is thought to have strong ties to
the military.
Rice said that Gorbachev is probably in a
better position than Romanov to take
power because he has had responsibility over
promotions within the party.
"Gorbachev is in the best position with
the party apparatus," Rice said. Conquest
described Romanov as "a corrupt hard-liner,
harder in principle, an administrator" while
he said Gorbachev is "brighter and more
flexible."
"At least he (Gorbachev) realizes the
need for agricultural reform," Conquest
said.
Triska said that neither Romanov nor
Gorbachev has substantive experience in
foreign affairs.
