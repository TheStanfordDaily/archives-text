President Reagan may he earning a reputation
for missing funerals.
His decision to pass up a major ceremony in
the Soviet Union tomorrow reflects not oniy a
refusal to grant the Soviets proper respect, hut
the continuation of an antagonistic policy.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes tells
us that upon learning of the death of Soviet
President Yuri Andropov, Reagan sent a per
sonal message to Moscow expressing hope for
' genuine cooperation with the Soviet Union to
help make the world better."
Sending the message sounded like a good way
"to help make the world better" via superpower
stability.
But Reagan didn't follow through. He stayed
at his Santa Barbara vacation ranch, talking to
most of the nation and the world through Larry
Speakes and other press secretaries and dis
patching Vice President George Bush to be his
"personal representative" at Andropov's fu
neral.
That Reagan opted to miss an unprecedented
second chance to attend the funeral of a Soviet
president probably didn't surprise anyone. The
fact that it isn't surprising makes it that much
more disturbing.
Not that there's anything wrong with sending
George Bush. After all, when Bush attended
Leonid Brezhnev's funeral in Moscow 15 months
ago, it worked wonders.
On that occasion. Bush told the Soviet people
that opportunities "now exist to seek a world
of greater harmony, not only between the two
great superpowers, but for all nations."
Secretary of State George Shultz was also on
the scene, telling reporters, "The president feels
that particularly right now is a chance" for the
superpowers to work "for a more constructive
relationship than we have had up to now."

Reagan stayed home.
That was No\. 14. 1952. U.S.-Soviet relations
have only deteriorated since then, and the presi
dent offers no indication that he hopes to im
prove things. On Friday, Shultz asked the
remaining Soviet leadership to participate in "a
constructive and realistic dialogue." Bush will
probably say something similar at the funeral
tommorow.
And the president?
Speakes says Reagan will he conducting
meetings at the White House with Jordan's
King Hussein and Egyptian President Mubarak.
They will undoubtedly be important meetings.
They can also be rescheduled.
So why not reschedule? Given the precarious
presence of nuclear weapons in a bipolar world,
Hussein, Mubarak and everyone else can certain
ly bear the inconvenience.
Instead, Reagan will miss an opportunity not
to instantly transform superpower relations,
but to impress upon the Soviet Union and the
rest of the world his desire to really "help make
the world better" by openly acknowledging
Andropov's leadership of the world's other poli
tical monolith.
But then Reagan doesn't seem to understand
what Presidents Nixon and Carter realized in
U.S.-Soviet summit meetings — superpower
parity. He can't come to grips with today's
world: The Soviets are, at the very least
militarily, our equals. They should be treated ac
cordingly.
With the shake-up in Soviet leadership and
the impending presidential elections here, now is
a fine time to toss rhetoric by the wayside and
recognize the gravity of U.S.-Soviet tensions.
Both sides must make real efforts to improve
relations — both for themselves and the rest of
the world. Unfortunately, Reagan has gotten
off to a bad start — again.
