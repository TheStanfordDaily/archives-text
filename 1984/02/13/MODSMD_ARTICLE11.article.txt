## Israeli security means Arab displacement in West Bank 
### 
Following Middle East issues, I'm
duly impressed by the range of slip
pery arguments passed off as
legitimate. Israeli journalist Amos
Levuv. who spoke in Flo Mo lust
Thursday about his country's settle
ments on the West Bank, provided
some excellent examples of this phe
nomenon.
For example, trying to explain the
potential difficulty of removing the
Arabs from the West Bank, Levav
described the Arab's "characteristic"

VIEWPOINT

of always wanting to remain in his
own house. Levav suggested that an
Israeli plan to expel the Arabs would
thus he '"insane" due to heavy Arab
resistance.
First, as though diagnosing some
strange deficiency among West Bank
Arabs, Levav implies that human
beings do not normally feel strong
endearment for their homes. One is
led to believe that if some other race
inhabited the West Bank, its people
would be happy to pull up stakes and
move into the limbo now faced by
thousands of Palestinian refugees.
In fact, the avowal of Jewish Gush
Emunim settlers never to surrender
their new homes on the West Bank,
even if ordered to do so by the Israeli
government, provides simple proof

that Arabs are not alone in displaying
this odd "characteristic" of disliking
deportation.
Further, Levav is suggesting that
the reason for not expelling the
Arabs is the potential difficulty of
their removal, not that the idea of
doing it in the first place is somehow
twisted.
Turning to the subject of relations
between Jewish settlers and West
Bank Arabs, Levav described in se
quence first how well they coexist,
and second, how Arabs stone Jewish
school buses. Clearly, the latter ex
cludes the former, and like the Arab
demonstrations, reinforces the no
tion that Arabs are not cheerful
about Israeli settlement policy and
military rule on the West Bank.
Discussing the long range outlook
for Israel, Levav listed as one
"danger" the growing influence of
Arab nations in the United States.
He explained that Americans are
being realistic, that they want Arab
oil to keep themselves warm in the
winter.
In this case, Levav seems to be im
plying that beyond the billions of
dollars in U.S. economic and military
aid to Israel, Americans now ought
to halt imports of Arab oil and/or be
cold in winter to demonstrate a com
mitment to Israel.
And though Israeli influence in the

United States doesn't appear to be
waning, given the most recent stra
tegic agreements between Israeli
Prime Minister Vit7haV Shamir ana
President Reagan, improved Arab re
lations with the United States could
hardly be considered undesireable for
Americans.
In fact, it would make good sense.
Oil or no oil, the Arab nations add up
to over 100 million people on two
continents; Israel is some two mil
lion.
Yet just as Taiwan was for so many
years our China, we appear to believe
the fiction that Israel is our Middle
East.
This is not to say we should turn
our backs on the national aspirations
of Taiwan or Israel, but that we
should tune into reality when deter
mining the relative importance of
other nations. There exists no in
herent contradiction in this, as there
would be no contradiction between
the State of Israel and a Palestinian
state on the West Bank.
And if the United States gave ap
propriate respect to Arabs and their
nations, perhaps Israelis like Levav
would feel inclined to follow suit,
beginning with a fair settlement
(instead of more settlements) on the
West Bank.
