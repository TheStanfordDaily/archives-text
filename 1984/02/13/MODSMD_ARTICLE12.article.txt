# Civil rights have a long way to go
## 
### 
In 1963, there was an issue that aroused such
passion in the United States that 300,000 people
marched to Washington, D.C., to make their
voices heard — at that time the largest march in
the nation's history. Their issue? That of
equality — of civil rights. Some 20 years later,
after a commemorative march this past summer,
it is appropriate to ask: Where are we now in
terms of civil rights?
While the past 20 years have seen many suc
cesses in civil rights, there have also been too
many failures and there is plenty of room for im
provement. It is important to survey these suc
cesses. become aware of the failures and chart a
course to guarantee progress in the future.
What has been accomplished? It is clear that
131 uck America is far from the top of the nation
al agenda, a place it enjoyed in the mid-19605.
But since the days of the Civil Rights and Voting
Rights Acts, great progress has been made in the
struggle for equality.
Unfair, discriminatory and unconstitutional
laws have been systematically removed from the
books, in an attempt to offer equality before
the law. The standard of living of minorities in
general and blacks in particular has risen dramati
cally in the past two decades, and affirmative ac
tion programs have attempted to redress past
discriminatory practices. Through nationwide
awareness and voter registration drives, blacks
have unprecedented political and economic power
today: 227 cities are run by black mayors, up
from just 48 in 1973. Cities such as Los Angeles,
Detroit, New Orleans. Chicago and Philadelphia
;ill boast black mayors.
These gains are laudable, but let us look at

where we have tallen short of the mark: While
the black standard of living has risen, it has merely
paralleled similar rises in the standard of living of
all Americans.
The disparity is graphically demonstrated by
black unemployment figures, which have consis
tently been above those of the rest of the work
force, stabilizing at levels that average twice that
of whites. Black teen-age unemployment has
reached epidemic proportions in recent years, ap
proaching 50 percent, while white teen-age un
employment has never touched 30 percent in any
year over the past two decades.
In 1980. the average black family had only 57
cents for every dollar enjoyed by the average
white family — this figure is tragic in itself, but
more so when compared to 1969, when black
families had 61 cents for each white dollar.
In the political realm, there also exist in
equalities: In Congress, blacks comprise only 21 of
435 members of the House of Representatives,
and not one of our 100 senators. These figures
are mirrored on the state and local level, espe
cially in the South — Mississippi, which is almost
one-third black, has only 7 percent black elected
officials: Georgia, one-quarter black, is
represented by only 4 percent black officials;
North Carolina, 20 percent black, has a mere 4
percent black elected officials.
This disparity has been exacerbated by the fact
that since 1981, civil rights proponents have had
a de facto opponent in the White House. Under
the leadership of President Ronald Reagan, the
Justice Department has cut back affirmative ac
tion programs, intervened in federal court cases
in favor ol segregation and proposed tax-exempt

status for schools which discriminate.
In other actions, the executive branch has tried
to eliminate the Legal Services Corporation
which aids poor and minority defendents (an ac
tion that Reagan attempted on a state level in
1970 when, as governor of California, he vetoed
all funds to California Rural Legal Assistance —
a move orchestrated by Attorney General
designate Edwin Meese III), and cut federal aid
to cities (where 57 percent of all blacks live, as
opposed to 25 percent of whites). As Margaret
Burnham of the National Conference of Black
Lawyers states, "The Justice Department has
become the leading light and the spokesperson in
the campaign against civil rights."
What can be done? The issues now facing the
civil rights movement are often reduced to basic
survival — with black unemployment above 20
percent nationally, jobs are an urgent need.
Policies designed to improve the relative position
of minorities in the economic strata are justified
by the continuing evidence of racial inequality in
American life — much of the progress in the past
20 years has been influenced by affirmative ac
tion programs, and now more than ever there is a
need for a strong commitment to these reme
dies.
We need to shore up the progress made
already, .md set an agenda for the 1980s which
includes initiating specific programs to combat
inequality, refocusing national attention to
eliminate discrimination and electing a president
who is willing to contribute more than mere
words to the cause of civil rights.

cially in the South — Mississippi, which is almost
one-third black, has only 7 percent black elected
officials: Georgia, one-quarter black, is
represented by only 4 percent black officials;
North Carolina, 20 percent black, has a mere 4
percent black elected officials.
This disparity has been exacerbated by the fact
that since 1981, civil rights proponents have had
a de facto opponent in the White House. Under
the leadership of President Ronald Reagan, the
Justice Department has cut back affirmative ac
tion programs, intervened in federal court cases
in favor ol segregation and proposed tax-exempt

status for schools which discriminate.
In other actions, the executive branch has tried
to eliminate the Legal Services Corporation
which aids poor and minority defendents (an ac
tion that Reagan attempted on a state level in
1970 when, as governor of California, he vetoed
all funds to California Rural Legal Assistance —
a move orchestrated by Attorney General
designate Edwin Meese III), and cut federal aid
to cities (where 57 percent of all blacks live, as
opposed to 25 percent of whites). As Margaret
Burnham of the National Conference of Black
Lawyers states, "The Justice Department has
become the leading light and the spokesperson in
the campaign against civil rights."
What can be done? The issues now facing the
civil rights movement are often reduced to basic
survival — with black unemployment above 20
percent nationally, jobs are an urgent need.
Policies designed to improve the relative position
of minorities in the economic strata are justified
by the continuing evidence of racial inequality in
American life — much of the progress in the past
20 years has been influenced by affirmative ac
tion programs, and now more than ever there is a
need for a strong commitment to these reme
dies.
We need to shore up the progress made
already, .md set an agenda for the 1980s which
includes initiating specific programs to combat
inequality, refocusing national attention to
eliminate discrimination and electing a president
who is willing to contribute more than mere
words to the cause of civil rights.
