## Guatemala: repression and murder 
### 
Recently, I heard on the radio a
grisly account of acts of terror by
the government of Guatemala
against the indigenous people who
li\e near the northern border of that
country. The dictator, Oscar Meija
Victores, has intensified the repres
sion undertaken by his predecessor.
General Rios Montt. With military
training and plentiful supplies of

VIEWPOINT

arms provided by Israel, as well as the
United States, Victores has initiated
a campaign of unprecedented terror
and cruelty in order to force the In
dian peasants off their oil-rich land
and into concentration camps (called
"model villages").
The young woman on the radio
broadcast, who has recently returned
from Guatemala, described the ac
tivities of the Guatemalan army.
Recruits, found among the
peasantry, are usually kidnapped and,
on their entry into the armed forces,
horribly beaten. The beatings are
routine; the new soldiers are thus
conditioned to participate in the

torture of prisoners. If the soldier
refuses to torture and to rape, he
risks being himself tortured or killed.
The Israelis help with this training
and have been giving military assis
tance to the Guatemalan regime
since 1977. Israel has built a weapons
factory in Guatemala.
The young woman's stories of
recent atrocities seemed incredible.
A village was surrounded by govern
ment troops and the men summoned
to an outlying area. The men. fearing
for the safety of their wives,
brought the women with them.
Children came. too. As soon as the
peasants were assembled, the soldiers
opened fire with their machine guns.
A 17-year-old boy escaped from the
scene of torture in which male
prisoners were hacked in two at the
waist. The skin of the torso was then
ripped off and the ribs broken.
The woman's voice over the radio
was spellbinding. Her tragic narration
was delivered with great force and
solemnity and, at times, she broke
off to urge her American listeners to
bring pressure on Congress to end all

aid. economic or military, from the
United States to the ferocious and
barbarous rulers of Guatemala.
Prof. Richard Fagen's account in
The Daily (Feb. 6) of his trip to
Nicaragua is illuminating. The gov
ernment of Nicaragua has armed all
its citizens with AK-47 assault rifles
in the expectation of an invasion by
United States marines. No govern
ment would dare arm its people un
less it could rely on their loyalty. Rios
Montt and Victores naturally prefer
to massacre an unarmed peasantry.
As Fagen points out: Why do we
bully these small and impoverished
countries? Do we really imagine, in
our paranoid hysteria, that the
Nicaraguans or the Guatemalans
threaten us? They are only trying, in
the face of great difficulties and
hardship, to survive. It would be
more dignified if we helped them —
if we helped the educational and
medical programs in Nicaragua, for
instance. I fear that we are earning
their long-lived animosity and
hatred. One can hardly blame them.
