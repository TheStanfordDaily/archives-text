## Hoover critics are hypocritical 
### 
Last spring, without a shred of evidence of wrongdo
ing, the University acquiesced to Profs. John Manley and
Ron Rebholz in their crusade to banish the Hoover Insti
tution from Stanford. Eighty-four of the approximate
ly 1500 members of the faculty signed an initially
anonymous petition calling for a committee "to explore
and reassess the relations between the Hoover Institu
tion and the University."
The argument advanced on behalf of the investigation
seems so guileless: Surely, you would agree, there's no

VIEWPOINT

harm done in just looking into things. If there's nothing
to hide, then why would anyone oppose a review? . .. And
so McCarthy proceeded on his witch hunt 30 years ago
because the principle of sufficient evidence was dis
missed without a second thought.
I his past fall when the idea of a Ronald Reagan
presidential complex was floated the University ex
ploded with indignation. More than 200 members of the
faculty wrote to the Campus Report to defend the in
tegrity of the University. Some were fanatically anti-
Reagan, while others were more careful to adorn their
antipathy in the ornamental rhetoric of "academic
freedom." The Faculty Senate agreed that accepting a
Reagan complex as originally proposed would politicize
the University and ruin our academic reputation. The
Daily editorials toed the same line.
Last week this University — the same "non-partisan,
value neutral" university which apologized for a speech
by Nobel laureate William Shockley and censored Pete
McCloskey's reading list, while sponsoring Angela Davis
(vice-presidential candidate of the American Commu
nist Party) and Gary Hart — allowed presidential can

didute Alan Cranston to use the faculty cluh for a
fund-raiser. Thus was born Cranstongate.
Surely, someone in the administration or the faculty
knew this was going on. Out in the real world, whenever
the lowest-level clerk in a president's administration
commits a no-no, the recriminations are aimed directly
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue because the president is
considered to be responsible for everything which
transpires within his administration. Should not this
same principle apply to Stanford?
The question which comes to mind with respect to the
Cranston incident and the alleged politicizing of Stan
ford by the leasing of land to an independent Ronald
Reagan center for public affairs is the following: Did
this activity fall within Stanford's "normal academic and
administrative structure" — the phrase so piously
pronounced by those who oppose a Reagan center inde
pendent of both Hoover and Stanford?
Where are Manley and Rebholz and the other prin
cipled 84 who fought so'valiantly last spring for the
chastity of Stanford? Their absence is conspicous. Where
are those members of SCAReU who challenged the pro
priety of Hoover's presence at Stanford and the
prospect of a Reagan complex with the question, "Is this
political operation compatible with the non-partisan aca
demic purposes of a great university?" Won't they hire
public advocates to investigate? And where are the let
ters from the members of the faculty who were so in
censed by the mere proposal of a Reagan center? Their
silence in the face of this blatant violation of University
policy reveals the inconsistency of their commitment to
the integrity ot this University and exposes the myth of
academic freedom at Stanford.
Principles invoked when convenient soon ce&se to
guide.
