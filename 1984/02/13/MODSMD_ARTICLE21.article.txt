# Professor's commentary: Martin Hellman
## A 						world Beyond War: the new manner of thinking 
### 
Martin Hellman is a professor of electrical
engineering at Stanford. His teaching and re
search are concerned with communications
and information processing, particularly cryp
tography. Hellman is currently on a partial
leave of absence so that he can devote more
time to the Beyond War educational project.
The Beyond War movement is dedicated
to averting nuclear catastrophe hy educating
people and building agreement on the need
to end all war.
It is helpful to start with what Beyond
War is and is not: Beyond War is not uni
lateral disarmament; rather, it is unilateral
initiative. Beyond War is not beyond con
flict; rather, it is resolution of conflict in
creative ways without resorting to violence.
Beyond War is not unrealistic; rather, it is
the fundamental, pragmatic solution re
quired for our survival. Beyond War is not a
specific program of political or military ac
tions; it is a new mode of thinking which will
profoundly enlighten all our actions.
Einstein saw the situation clearly in 1945,
after the first atomic explosions at
Alamogordo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when
he said, "The unleashed power of the atom
has changed everything, save our modes of
thinking, and we thus drift toward unparal
leled catastrophe."
To stop this "drift" we must choose be
tween an old mode of thinking that will lead
to "unparalleled catastrophe" and a new one
that will allow humanity to survive. The real
crisis is that we do not perceive this to be a
choice between life and death, "and we thus
drift."

To avert the drift, we need to perceive our
environment more clearly. First, we must
recognize that all war is obsolete. It is not
extinct — there are over 40 wars raging right
now, but it is obsolete.
Full-scale nuclear war is obsolete. It would
destroy civilization and threaten the very
existence of life.
Limited nuclear war is obsolete. Detona
tion of even a small percentage of the
world's nuclear arsenals could trigger a
"nuclear winter" and cause the extinction of
humanity. It is also highly probable that a
limited nuclear war would escalate into a
full-scale nuclear war.
Conventional war among the superpowers,
as well as "small" wars among the non
superpowers, are obsolete. Conventional
wars among the non-superpowers cannot be
fought without potentially involving the su
perpowers. The growing interdependence of
nations has produced a network of "vital in
terests" which the superpowers have pledged
to defend. We are calling for an end to all
war because our survival demands it.
Technology has given us the ability to
destroy the planet. But it has also given us a
powerful symbol — the view of Earth from
space — of the new mode of thinking that
Einstein saw was needed to avert
catastrophe: We are one.
When we look at the Earth from the per
spective of space we can see it as it really is:
shining, fragile and beautiful; one whole, in
terdependent globe, with one life-support
system. We live on one planet, and the sur
vival of all humanity — indeed, all life — is

totally interdependent. The view of Earth
from space is a symbol of hope, of our unity,
toward which we can move it we so choose,
and where we must move it we are to survive.
To adopt this new mode of thinking, we
must expand our "world". So long as we ex
clude some people from our sphere of identi
fication, our insecurity will always conjure up
some enemy, just as our Soviet allies became

The goal of the Beyond War
movement is to build
agreement, to change our
inner attitudes and outer
actions and find creative
alternatives for resolving
conflicts.

our enemies once the Nazis were defeated.
And, by posing an enemy, we are guaranteed
of being seen as an enemy — ill will is self
perpetuating.
To survive in the nuclear age, we must ex
pand our identification — the "size" of our
world — to encompass the whole Earth and
all of life. We are caretakers not just of our
property or our nation's territory, but of
the whole Earth; we revere not just our ideas
or ideology, but truth.
Knowing that war is obsolete is one thing.

Deciding to reject war forever as an option is
quite another.
I here is a natural tendency to postpone
making a decision, to drift. We avoid facing
the issue squarely, subconsciously hoping
that a "Great Leader" or some kind of
magic will solve the problem for us. A clear
cut decision is needed to stop this drift.
Decision means to cut ("cision") away
from ("de") — to enter into the unknown
by rejecting and forever closing the door to
an existing option. We cannot see the possi
bility of a new approach until the comfort
and illusory safety of the old are no longer
available as an option.
The decision before us is between the old
mode of thinking and the new. The old mode
represents the idea that has dominated
human thinking for the past I ().()()() years:
that war is acceptable. Horrible, yes; to be
avoided, certainly; but legitimate and moral
when used so good can triumph over evil.
The new mode is symbolized by the view of
Earth from space; the new knowledge that
war is obsolete and that we are part of a
single interdependent life-support system.
The decision to adopt this new mode of
thinking requires moving from blame to re
sponsibility and a commitment to find crea
tive alternatives instead of killing those we
call our enemies. When adopted, it will lead
to a quantum leap forward in the evolution
of civilization. To survive, we must see that
this is a choice not just between two modes
of thinking, but between life and death.
The goal of the Beyond War movement is
to build agreement that the world is bevond

war. But is that action? Absolutely. Any
successful action involving more than one
person requires prior agreement. For a family
to have a successful vacation, they must
first agree on where to go. Anyone who has
been on a vacation where there was not
agreement knows it is hardly a vacation.
Prohibition exemplifies this same phenom
enon at a societal level. Implementation
even as a constitutional amendment — with
out first obtaining agreement, always fails.
If we work for agreement among individ
uals first, the laws will follow naturally. If
we work for laws first, they will fail just as
Prohibition did. That is why Beyond War is
an educational movement.
In all societal changes — abolishing slavery,
instituting women's suffrage, advancing civil
rights — it has been individuals who have
made all the difference. Without individual
change, societal change cannot occur.
Because the Beyond War movement will
be carried by individuals, we must be living
proof of the possibility of a world beyond
war — we must live our lives beyond war.
This is a change of unprecedented magnitude
not only in our outer actions, but also in our
inner attitude. For it is out of our inner at
titude that our actions proceed.
The message and the messenger must be
consistent. We must find creative ways to
deal with conflict, for we obviously cannot
wage peace in a warlike manner.
The Beyond War movement is a gathering
together of individuals who will adopt the
new mode of thinking and work with others
to build a world beyond war.

of being seen as an enemy — ill will is self
perpetuating.
To survive in the nuclear age, we must ex
pand our identification — the "size" of our
world — to encompass the whole Earth and
all of life. We are caretakers not just of our
property or our nation's territory, but of
the whole Earth; we revere not just our ideas
or ideology, but truth.
Knowing that war is obsolete is one thing.

Deciding to reject war forever as an option is
quite another.
I here is a natural tendency to postpone
making a decision, to drift. We avoid facing
the issue squarely, subconsciously hoping
that a "Great Leader" or some kind of
magic will solve the problem for us. A clear
cut decision is needed to stop this drift.
Decision means to cut ("cision") away
from ("de") — to enter into the unknown
by rejecting and forever closing the door to
an existing option. We cannot see the possi
bility of a new approach until the comfort
and illusory safety of the old are no longer
available as an option.
The decision before us is between the old
mode of thinking and the new. The old mode
represents the idea that has dominated
human thinking for the past I ().()()() years:
that war is acceptable. Horrible, yes; to be
avoided, certainly; but legitimate and moral
when used so good can triumph over evil.
The new mode is symbolized by the view of
Earth from space; the new knowledge that
war is obsolete and that we are part of a
single interdependent life-support system.
The decision to adopt this new mode of
thinking requires moving from blame to re
sponsibility and a commitment to find crea
tive alternatives instead of killing those we
call our enemies. When adopted, it will lead
to a quantum leap forward in the evolution
of civilization. To survive, we must see that
this is a choice not just between two modes
of thinking, but between life and death.
The goal of the Beyond War movement is
to build agreement that the world is bevond

war. But is that action? Absolutely. Any
successful action involving more than one
person requires prior agreement. For a family
to have a successful vacation, they must
first agree on where to go. Anyone who has
been on a vacation where there was not
agreement knows it is hardly a vacation.
Prohibition exemplifies this same phenom
enon at a societal level. Implementation
even as a constitutional amendment — with
out first obtaining agreement, always fails.
If we work for agreement among individ
uals first, the laws will follow naturally. If
we work for laws first, they will fail just as
Prohibition did. That is why Beyond War is
an educational movement.
In all societal changes — abolishing slavery,
instituting women's suffrage, advancing civil
rights — it has been individuals who have
made all the difference. Without individual
change, societal change cannot occur.
Because the Beyond War movement will
be carried by individuals, we must be living
proof of the possibility of a world beyond
war — we must live our lives beyond war.
This is a change of unprecedented magnitude
not only in our outer actions, but also in our
inner attitude. For it is out of our inner at
titude that our actions proceed.
The message and the messenger must be
consistent. We must find creative ways to
deal with conflict, for we obviously cannot
wage peace in a warlike manner.
The Beyond War movement is a gathering
together of individuals who will adopt the
new mode of thinking and work with others
to build a world beyond war.

The Beyond War movement is dedicated
to averting nuclear catastrophe hy educating
people and building agreement on the need
to end all war.
It is helpful to start with what Beyond
War is and is not: Beyond War is not uni
lateral disarmament; rather, it is unilateral
initiative. Beyond War is not beyond con
flict; rather, it is resolution of conflict in
creative ways without resorting to violence.
Beyond War is not unrealistic; rather, it is
the fundamental, pragmatic solution re
quired for our survival. Beyond War is not a
specific program of political or military ac
tions; it is a new mode of thinking which will
profoundly enlighten all our actions.
Einstein saw the situation clearly in 1945,
after the first atomic explosions at
Alamogordo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when
he said, "The unleashed power of the atom
has changed everything, save our modes of
thinking, and we thus drift toward unparal
leled catastrophe."
To stop this "drift" we must choose be
tween an old mode of thinking that will lead
to "unparalleled catastrophe" and a new one
that will allow humanity to survive. The real
crisis is that we do not perceive this to be a
choice between life and death, "and we thus
drift."

To avert the drift, we need to perceive our
environment more clearly. First, we must
recognize that all war is obsolete. It is not
extinct — there are over 40 wars raging right
now, but it is obsolete.
Full-scale nuclear war is obsolete. It would
destroy civilization and threaten the very
existence of life.
Limited nuclear war is obsolete. Detona
tion of even a small percentage of the
world's nuclear arsenals could trigger a
"nuclear winter" and cause the extinction of
humanity. It is also highly probable that a
limited nuclear war would escalate into a
full-scale nuclear war.
Conventional war among the superpowers,
as well as "small" wars among the non
superpowers, are obsolete. Conventional
wars among the non-superpowers cannot be
fought without potentially involving the su
perpowers. The growing interdependence of
nations has produced a network of "vital in
terests" which the superpowers have pledged
to defend. We are calling for an end to all
war because our survival demands it.
Technology has given us the ability to
destroy the planet. But it has also given us a
powerful symbol — the view of Earth from
space — of the new mode of thinking that
Einstein saw was needed to avert
catastrophe: We are one.
When we look at the Earth from the per
spective of space we can see it as it really is:
shining, fragile and beautiful; one whole, in
terdependent globe, with one life-support
system. We live on one planet, and the sur
vival of all humanity — indeed, all life — is

totally interdependent. The view of Earth
from space is a symbol of hope, of our unity,
toward which we can move it we so choose,
and where we must move it we are to survive.
To adopt this new mode of thinking, we
must expand our "world". So long as we ex
clude some people from our sphere of identi
fication, our insecurity will always conjure up
some enemy, just as our Soviet allies became
