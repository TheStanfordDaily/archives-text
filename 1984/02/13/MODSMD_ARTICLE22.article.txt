## The
						night the Card 'flu' by the Bears in Harmon Gym 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Berkeley — Stanford Basketball Coach
Tom Davis didn't find a miracle flu cure in
time for Friday night's game against UC-
Berkeley. He did, however, find a way to
beat the Bears for the first time in his two
years at Stanford.
The Cardinal, using two flu-stricken
players, broke a five-game losing streak
against Cal with a 62-51 victory before
6656 partisan fans in a sold-out Harmon
Gym and avenged a 66-64 loss to the Bears
earlier this season in Maples Pavilion.
But Davis didn't do it with his usual
stars — Keith Jones, John Revelli and
Steve Brown, who are Stanford's top
three leading scorers. Instead, Davis relied
on the play of the "others" on his team to
get a 48-45 lead with 4:53 remaining and
then let second-string point guard Keith
Ramee do the rest on his own.
Ramee, in Davis' words, "literally took
that game over" in the closing minutes,
scoring a clutch basket with 2:47 to play,
dishing off a key assist at the 2:04 mark
and netting 10 straight free throws in the
final 1:34 to seal the win.
Ramee finished with a team and career
high 16 points, 14 of which he scored in the
last 5:05 of the contest. Cal, meanwhile,
finished with a loss.
The victory upped Stanford's overall
record to 16-8, assuring the Card its first
winning season in 1 I years. Davis has yet to
suffer a losing season in 13 years as a head
coach.
The Cardinal also took over sole posses
sion of fifth place in the Pacific-10 Con
ference with its 5-6 league mark. Just
three weeks ago, Stanford was in dead last
after a 0-6 start and should it continue its
winning ways, it will complete one of the
most stunning in-season turnarounds in
Pac-10 basketball history.
"To win five in a row in this league, you
have to be playing pretty well," Davis said
Friday night in a jubilant Card locker
room. "I felt it was just a matter of time
. . . even though we lost those (six) games
in a row."
Stanford stands a good chance of
gaining an invitation to a post-season
tournament if it wins 20 games this year.
With seven games remaining on the
schedule — four of them at home — the
Card onlv needs to win four of them to

reach the magical 20-win figure.
"We're not that faraway from being,
heating the top teams in the league,"
Davis said. "We're just a few players
away."
Before Friday's game, however, it ap
peared Davis was a few players away from
even heating Cal, which dropped to 3-7 in
the Pac-lOand 10-10 overall.
Jones — the Pac-10's leading scorer —
had the flu and although he played 29
minutes, he was unable to tally double fig
ures for the first time in his last 41 games.
Revelli didn't have the flu, but at times
played like he did. The 6-7 senior center
scored only 10 points on a 4-for-9 field
goal shooting performance; however, he
did grab a season-high 13 rebounds.
The trio of Jones, Revelli and Brown —
which entered the game averaging 48.5 of
the Card's 76.7 total points — scored just
21 between them. But nine Card players
scored to pick up the slack on offense.
"I've been feeling for a long time that
we've got more dimensions on this team
than Jones and Revelli," Davis said.
"We've got some guys that can play well."
And "well" was exactly the way Stan
ford — and Cal — played in the first half
Friday night. The game was tied eight
times in the first nine minutes and a total
of 11 in the half. Stanford turned the ball
over just once in the period and Cal twice.
So it was not until with eight seconds to
play in the half that the Card went ahead
to stay. Jones hit a three-foot shot from
the left baseline to give Stanford a 30-29
halftime lead, one it never relinquished.
"I thought we (Cal) played well in the
first half," said Bear Coach Dick Kuchen.
"The game was decided in the first five
minutes of the second half."
That it was. Both teams came out of
the locker room ice cold, but Cal's ther
mometer stayed in the blue longer.
The Bears went into hibernation for the
first 9:34 of the period, scoring one free
throw and one basket for a total of three
points. In the meantime, Stanford had
scored 12 points — five of them by Revelli
— to take a commanding 42-32 edge with
10:39 left.
Cal slowly whittled away the Card lead
behind the play of freshman guard Chris
Washington, who led all scorers with 23
points. The Bears cut it to 48-45 with 4:53
to go and Davis called time-out.

"We were having trouble getting our of
fense going," Davis explained later, "so we
thought why not go into the delay game.
We actually scored more points off our
delay than our regular offense."
Kuchen countered with a man-to-man
defense and almost forced a Card turnover
in a few instances. But after two-plus
minutes of running the delay offense
called "The Roll," Ramee drove past his
defender for a lay-in, making it 50-45.
Cal came down the court and senior
guard Butch Hays proved once again why
he is one of the most overrated players in
the Pac-10. Hays missed a jumper, nothing
new to him Friday night. The pre-season
All-Pac-10 pick was a horrendous 4-for-19
from the floor and 0-for-2 from the line
on the game.
Stanford took advantage of Hays' miss
seconds later when Ramee found Earl
Koberlem open underneath the hoop for
an easy two and a 52-45 lead. Ramee then
finished the Bears off with 10 straight
free throws.
Stanford shot an even 50 percent (22-
for-44) from the floor while Cal shot a
miserable 40.7 percent (24-for-59). Take
away Hays' 4-for-19 performance, though,
and the Bears shot 50 percent in the game
as well. Stanford also outrebounded Cal,
34-27.

Hans Wichary makes a saving leap as the Cardinal managed to save face against Cal on
Friday. Stanford's victory was its first over the Bears in basketball in two years.
