# Ramee: fine from line
## 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
Berkeley — It UC-
Berkeley Coach Dick
Kutchen didn't know that
Stanford guard Keith
Ramee can shoot free
throws, he does now.
The Cardinal sophomore
went 12-for-12 from the
line Saturday night, setting
a Stanford record for the
most consecutive free
throws in a game. Ramee

had a Stanford-high 16
points on the night, com
pleting his pertect evening
by going 2-tor-2 from the
field and adding three as
sists and one rebound. His
16 points was also a career
high.
Ramee really took it to
Cal in the last five minutes
of the game, scoring 14
points in that period as he
was consistently called up to
the free-throw line. In the
last 1:34, Ramee was 10-
for-10 from the line, tally
ing five straight one
and-ones.

"You can't say enough
about what Ramee did,"
Stanford Coach Tom Davis
said afterward the game.
"He literally took the game
over at the end. That's the
mark of a really fine
player."
The Cardinal went into
its stall early, putting a lot
of pressure on the point
guard, in this case, Ramee.
Unable to do anything
about the Stanford roll (a

version of the four corners
stall), the Bears were forced
into a situation where they
had to foul. Time and time
again Ramee was the victim
of Cal aggression. But like a
programmed computer.
Ramee never faltered, hit
ting free throw after free
throw after free throw .
" When Davis recruited
me. he said that point
guards would have to be able
to make free throws."
Ramee said. "Thev
(Stanford) got the ball to
me so much in the final
minutes."

What makes Ramee's
free-throw shooting feat
even more remarkable is
tbm, U Uicl. ru.>* wunie aipong
the familiar surroundings of
Maples Pavilion, but in the
dreaded Harmon Gym,
considered by many the
most difficult place to play
in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. The place is small,
noisy and overcrowded,
looking suspiciously like an
oversized high school gym
nasium.
"I think the yelling helps
me concentrate," Ramee
said. "I played on a great
high school team (Bernard
High, which was No. 1 in
California for much of
1981-82) and I'm used to
the yelling. I'd rather lose a
game myself than have it in
somebody else's hands."
This isn't the first time
that Ramee has taken over
a game. Last year against
Arizona State, Ramee had a
similar kind of performance
as the point guard had 13
points, including an 11-of
-14 performance, from the
free-throw liner'.
"He's done this before,"
Davis said. "He's taken over
games down the stretch. He
has a lot of confidence in
himself and I'm happy to see
him handle the ball and run
the offense so well."
Ramee showed an exam
ple of his confidence with
2:47 left in the game and
Stanford leading 48-45.
Running the delay game,
Ramee suddenly broke for
the basket to make an easy
layup. Just over half a min
ute later, Ramee threw a
perfect pass to sophomore
forward Earl Koberlein
beneath the basket. Kober
lein made the easy basket,
giving Stanford a more com
fortable seven point lead.
Although Ramee lost his
starting job to freshman
John Paye prior to the USC
game earlier this season, he
has been seeing virtually the
same amount of playing
time and has no hard
feelings about his new role.
"I still get a lot of
minutes." Ramee said. "As
long as we both contribute,
that's all that really mat
ters. We complement one
another a lot. He (Paye)
does some things I don't do.
and I do some things he
doesn't."
"He's been doing a great
job coming off the bench
and Pave s been doing a
good job starting." Davis
said. "They both have been
complementing each other."
