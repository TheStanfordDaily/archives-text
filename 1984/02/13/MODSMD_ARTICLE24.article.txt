### DAVE DUTCHER 
The Stanford baseball team
resembled a roller coaster this
weekend.
The Cardinal (7-5) lost its
third consecutive game Friday
and broke the streak with a
doubleheader sweep Saturday
— onJy to lose again yesterday.
For Stanford, the difference
between winning and losing
isn't hard to determine.
When Stanford defeated
San Jose State 11-5 and 3-2
Saturday, it played good
defense and had timely hitting.
When the Cardinal lost to San
Jose State 6-3 Friday and to
Santa Clara 4-3 yesterday,
those factors were noticeably
absent.
"We've been average —
about like our record shows,"
Cardinal Coach Mark Marquess
summed up last night. "We
played well at times yesterday
(Saturday) and at times today
(yesterday). We're just not
consistent enough."
Stanford's defensive prob
lems were primarily at two pos
itions — third base and pitcher.
Against San Jose State
Friday, freshman third
baseman Mark Machtolf
booted a ground ball and hit a
Spartan baserunner with a
throw to home, enabling San
Jose State to take a 3-1 lead.
Later in that game, fresh
man third baseman Dave
Esquer's throwing error
resulted in two San Jose State
runs and a 6-2 Cardinal deficit.
That deficit was too much
for Stanford to close with only
eight hits, seven of which were
singles. Spartan pitcher Ron
Rooker walked two Cardinals
— both after the seventh in
ning — and was the recipient
of consistent and sometimes
sparkling defense.
Saturday, however, the San
Jose State pitching staff could
not contain Stanford in the
first game of a doubleheader.
Junior first baseman Rick
Lundblade led the assault.
Lundblade homered, tripled,
doubled and drove in six runs as
Stanford scored all its runs in
three innings. Senior outfielder
Greg Lorenzetti had two
singles and an RBI, and
shortstop John Verducci con
tributed two singles to Stan
ford's 11 - hit attack.
Senior righthander John
Radtke improved his record to
3-0. Radtke lasted six innings,
and relievers David Harris and
Rob Wassenaar pitched the
final three.
Radtke's eight-hit. four
strikeout performance was
overshadowed by Steve Cot
trell's pitching in the second
game.
Cottrell (2-0) held the Spar

tans hitless before yielding a
bunt single in the sixth inning.
Two fifth-inning, errors,
though, resulted in a San Jose
State run.
Spartan Lou Holt got to
second base after Harris
dropped Holt's flyball. Cot
trell hit Dwayne Graybill. and
Rudy Escalante followed with
a grounder which Cottrell
threw over first base, allowing
Holt to score.
Cottrell faced another jam
in the sixth inning. After Tom
Krause got the Spartans' first
hit, a bunt moved him to
second base. Marquess then
called in junior reliever Jeff
Ballard.
Ballard enticed an inning
ending double play to escape
the jam. Marquess said Ballard
will be Stanford's bullpen ace.
"Our feeling is that when we
get into the eighth or ninth in
ning, if we're going to lose it,
we're going to lose it with him
(Ballard) in the game,"
Marquess said.
Ballard gave up a walk and a

double with none out in the
seventh, but got two
strikeouts and a groundout to
escape with only one run
scored.
While it appeared that the
Cardinal had rid itself of its
early-season cobwebs Saturday,
Stanford encountered more of
its old foes: lack of clutch hit
ting and errors.
Losing pitcher Kevin Kunkel
(1-2) gave up three runs in the
third inning and had two
throwing errors. Verducci also
had an error.
With the score tied 3-3 in
the eighth, the Cardinal had
the bases loaded with one out.
The threat, though, was
stymied by a strikeout and a
flyout. Stanford also failed to
ignite an uprising in the sixth
with runners on first and third
and one out.
Marquess has found positive
aspects in Stanford's inconsis
tent play.
"We've played awful of
fensively, yet we would have
had a chance to win each of the

games we lost with any kind of
timely hitting," he said.
mediocre as we've been, we've
been in every game."
Sophomore Ken Green and
freshman Ruben Amaro, Jr.
have given Marquess reason to
remain optimistic.
Green, who had an eighth
inning home run yesterday, has
continued to hit well and pro
vide good defense at third
base. Marquess said Green and
Machtolf, who had two hits
Friday, will compete for the
starting job at third.
Amaro, the son of Chicago
Cub Coach Ruben Amaro, had a
hit in his first collegiate at-bat
Saturday. He didn't stop there,
adding another in the second
game against San Jose State
and two yesterday.
Stanford will face University
of Pacific in the first game of a
six-game home stand tomorrow
at 2:30 at Sunken Diamond.
Marquess said "three or four"
pitchers, including junior Seth
Bland and Wassenaar, probably
will see action against UOP.

been in every game."
Sophomore Ken Green and
freshman Ruben Amaro, Jr.
have given Marquess reason to
remain optimistic.
Green, who had an eighth
inning home run yesterday, has
continued to hit well and pro
vide good defense at third
base. Marquess said Green and
Machtolf, who had two hits
Friday, will compete for the
starting job at third.
Amaro, the son of Chicago
Cub Coach Ruben Amaro, had a
hit in his first collegiate at-bat
Saturday. He didn't stop there,
adding another in the second
game against San Jose State
and two yesterday.
Stanford will face University
of Pacific in the first game of a
six-game home stand tomorrow
at 2:30 at Sunken Diamond.
Marquess said "three or four"
pitchers, including junior Seth
Bland and Wassenaar, probably
will see action against UOP.

The Stanford baseball team
resembled a roller coaster this
weekend.
The Cardinal (7-5) lost its
third consecutive game Friday
and broke the streak with a
doubleheader sweep Saturday
— onJy to lose again yesterday.
For Stanford, the difference
between winning and losing
isn't hard to determine.
When Stanford defeated
San Jose State 11-5 and 3-2
Saturday, it played good
defense and had timely hitting.
When the Cardinal lost to San
Jose State 6-3 Friday and to
Santa Clara 4-3 yesterday,
those factors were noticeably
absent.
"We've been average —
about like our record shows,"
Cardinal Coach Mark Marquess
summed up last night. "We
played well at times yesterday
(Saturday) and at times today
(yesterday). We're just not
consistent enough."
Stanford's defensive prob
lems were primarily at two pos
itions — third base and pitcher.
Against San Jose State
Friday, freshman third
baseman Mark Machtolf
booted a ground ball and hit a
Spartan baserunner with a
throw to home, enabling San
Jose State to take a 3-1 lead.
Later in that game, fresh
man third baseman Dave
Esquer's throwing error
resulted in two San Jose State
runs and a 6-2 Cardinal deficit.
That deficit was too much
for Stanford to close with only
eight hits, seven of which were
singles. Spartan pitcher Ron
Rooker walked two Cardinals
— both after the seventh in
ning — and was the recipient
of consistent and sometimes
sparkling defense.
Saturday, however, the San
Jose State pitching staff could
not contain Stanford in the
first game of a doubleheader.
Junior first baseman Rick
Lundblade led the assault.
Lundblade homered, tripled,
doubled and drove in six runs as
Stanford scored all its runs in
three innings. Senior outfielder
Greg Lorenzetti had two
singles and an RBI, and
shortstop John Verducci con
tributed two singles to Stan
ford's 11 - hit attack.
Senior righthander John
Radtke improved his record to
3-0. Radtke lasted six innings,
and relievers David Harris and
Rob Wassenaar pitched the
final three.
Radtke's eight-hit. four
strikeout performance was
overshadowed by Steve Cot
trell's pitching in the second
game.
Cottrell (2-0) held the Spar

tans hitless before yielding a
bunt single in the sixth inning.
Two fifth-inning, errors,
though, resulted in a San Jose
State run.
Spartan Lou Holt got to
second base after Harris
dropped Holt's flyball. Cot
trell hit Dwayne Graybill. and
Rudy Escalante followed with
a grounder which Cottrell
threw over first base, allowing
Holt to score.
Cottrell faced another jam
in the sixth inning. After Tom
Krause got the Spartans' first
hit, a bunt moved him to
second base. Marquess then
called in junior reliever Jeff
Ballard.
Ballard enticed an inning
ending double play to escape
the jam. Marquess said Ballard
will be Stanford's bullpen ace.
"Our feeling is that when we
get into the eighth or ninth in
ning, if we're going to lose it,
we're going to lose it with him
(Ballard) in the game,"
Marquess said.
Ballard gave up a walk and a

double with none out in the
seventh, but got two
strikeouts and a groundout to
escape with only one run
scored.
While it appeared that the
Cardinal had rid itself of its
early-season cobwebs Saturday,
Stanford encountered more of
its old foes: lack of clutch hit
ting and errors.
Losing pitcher Kevin Kunkel
(1-2) gave up three runs in the
third inning and had two
throwing errors. Verducci also
had an error.
With the score tied 3-3 in
the eighth, the Cardinal had
the bases loaded with one out.
The threat, though, was
stymied by a strikeout and a
flyout. Stanford also failed to
ignite an uprising in the sixth
with runners on first and third
and one out.
Marquess has found positive
