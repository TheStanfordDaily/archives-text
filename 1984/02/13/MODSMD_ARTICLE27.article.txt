" We've crossed the edge
â€” we've broken through the
wall. " That's how Stanford
Assistant Women's Basket
ball Coach Michael kehoe
summed up his feeling fol
lowing the Cardinal's 73-64
non-conference victory over
Pepperdine.
Stanford came back from
an eight-point deficit with
under five minutes to play
to register only its fourth
victory of the season. The
Card had dropped five in a
row before Friday night and
had not beaten an NCAA
Division I team since Nov.
25.
The cagers had seen
several opportunities to
break that drought come
and go. but they put it all
together Friday.
Down by eight, Stanford
pulled within two on a
bizarre six-point play. Soph
omore center Sarah Evans
scored and was fouled on
the play. The player
whistled for the foul
protested and was called for
a technical foul as well.
Evans converted both the
personal and technical foul
shots to cut it to four, and
the Cardinal, with the ball
after the technical, scored
again to make it a two
point game.
Senior Lee Ann Mar
gerum then hit a jumper to
tie it on Stanford's next
time down, and the Cardinal
was in command from that
point.
Kehoe said, "The 'T was

definitely the turning
point. We continued to play
well, outhustled them, and
took the game away from
them. We also made our
free throws. " Indeed the
Card, who came in shooting
67 percent from the line,
hit 1 3 - of-1 7 from the
charity stripe to lock it up.
Four Stanford players
finished in double figures.
Leading the charge was
sophomore guard Virginia
Sourlis. who scored IS
points. Evans had 15, junior
forward Mary Bradach had
13 and freshman forward
Kim Mercer had 10. Bradach
led the Cardinal with nine
rebounds as Stanford out
rebounded Pepperdine, 28-
20.
The celebration was brief.

however, as the Cardinal
traveled to San Diego State
Saturday night and dropped
an SI-67 WCAA decision to
the A/tees, now IN-3.
San Diego State's high
scoring freshman forward
Tina Hutchinson tallied 35
points as the A/tecs kept
the Cardinal at hay. Stan
ford trailed 4l -3 I at
halftime. hut made a second
hall run at the A/tecs to
cut the lead to 66-62. San
Diego State, however, out
scored Stanford 15-5 down
the stretch to win it.
The cagers now stand at
4-IS on the season, but are
still winless in the WCAA
at 0-8. The Cardinal has
only one game this week,
traveling to Los Angeles to
face UCLA Friday nieht.
