The women's gymnastics
team here scored an all-time
team record in Saturday's Car
dinal Classic held in Maples
Pavilion. The team tallied
150.95 points, good for second
place in the meet.
Featured in the Classic were
No. 10-rated USC, No. 3-rated
Cal State Fullerton and San
Diego State.
"Our goal was to take a
second-place team finish," said
Head Coach Homer Sardina,
"and we did."
Stanford defeated LISC hy
more than three points, al
though USC was missing one of
its top competitors, who was
out with the flu. But Sardina
said, "I don't think she would
have made that much of a dif
ference; not four points
anyway."
Fullerton captured first
place with 186.15 points, USC
came in third with 177.10 and

San Diego took a fourth place
overall with 176.60.
"So far this season we have
managed to bump off four or
five teams ranked ahead of
us," said Sardina. "My guess is
that we are now approaching
the top 10. I think we are
surprising a lot of people."
Along with the team's suc
cess, there were outstanding
individual accomplishments.
Senior Merilyn Chapman tied
for first in the all-around with
a 37.30 total, and freshman
Nanci Goldsmith tied for third
with a 37.20.
"Our overall team energy is
what got me through," said
Chapman. "We really pulled
together. The enthusiasm kept
building every time we hit."
"A home meet really helps a
lot because you feel the crowd
behind you," said Goldsmith.
"This was the best meet I've
had in a couple years."
Chapman and Goldsmith also
placed in the individual events.

tying for second on bars and
beam with 9.55 and 9.45
respectively. Chapman placed
third on the floor with a 9.35.
"Both Merilyn and Nanci did
such a fantastic job," said Sar
dina, "but I feel Angie Barnes
deserves equal recognition."
Barnes was sick throughout the
competition, but still managed
to score her highest total of
the season. "In a way she did
the most outstanding job.

She's tough. She's such a solid
and consistent performer who
is always there for the team,
even when she's feeling
miserable."
The next competition will be
a critical one for the Cardinal.
The team faces No. 2-rated
Arizona State and No. 6 Uni
versity of Arizona, in Arizona.
"We're looking for another
team total in the IKOs," said
Sardina.
