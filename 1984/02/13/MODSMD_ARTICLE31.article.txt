# Lebanon's woes politically based
## 
### LOUISE SOLOMON 
I he causes of political conflict in
Lebanon are essentially political, not
religious, a former member of the Is
raeli Knesset said in the keynote
speech at the fifth annual israel
Education Day in Cuhberley
Auditoriuni yesterday.
/eidan Atashi. chairman of the Is
raeli Druse National Council Task
Lorce on the Lebanese Druse, told an
audience of approximately 400 that
the violence in Lebanon has been
misperceived as stemming from a re
ligious conflict between the Druse
and Maronite Christians.
"I have found a great deal of
misunderstanding and misconcep
tions in the U.S. about Lebanon and
about Israel." Atashi said.
I he Druse and the Christians had
been living together peacefully for
hundreds of years, he said.
"The fighting in Lebanon is a con
flict between Phalange militia and
anything that is not Phalange."
Atashi said.
Since the founding of the Phalange
party in the party has been
trying to reach power, to reach the
presidency, Atashi said. The Roman
Catholics, the Orthodox, the Protes
tants and even many of the
Maronites have consistently worked
to prevent this, he said.
"The Druse were excluded in the

1970s from the defense ministry, yet
the Druse. Moslem, and Christian
communities have said that any
Maronite Christian president would
be acceptable to the Lebanese, hut
not a Phalangist. certainly not a
Ciemayalen." he said. According to
Atashi. the Phalange party is per
ceived by the Lebanese as a private
corporation of the Ciemayalen fam
ily.
"The Phalange Maronite party and
militia contested and challenged the
other (parties') right to survive with
dignity in Lebanon." Atashi said.
"Out of concern for Druse contin
ued existence in Lebanon, we formed
a task force with the Israeli govern
ment to ease and to stop harassing
the Druse community through the
Phalange. And we found out that
such harassment was not the policy
of the Israeli government, but of the
defense minister. (Ariel) Sharon."
Atashi said. "After Sharon's resigna
tion from the Israeli government, we
reached certain rapprochements be
tween the Israelis and the Druse
community in Lebanon.
"The Druse and the Moslems and
the rest of the Christian minorities
are very deprived — financially and
politically," Atashi said. "1 did not
come here to give you any message
for a last solution in Lebanon. But I
would sav this: The Druse community

is not prepared to lay down their
arms until the present government in
Lebanon will make certain conces
sions."
The program for the day consisted
of four blocks of 10 seminars focus
ing on Israel and the Middle East.
Topics of discussion included "The
Palestinian Question," "Life under
Stress: Coping in Israel." "Women in
Israel" and "Modern Israel and the
Bible." Throughout the day. films on
Israel and Israeli life were show n.
More than 600 people, ranging
from teen-agers to the elderly, par
ticipated in the education day. a
project which was organized by stu
dents and faculty from the Stanford
community and by Jewish groups
from the Peninsula.
In the closing speech. Benjamin
Netanyahu from the Israeli Embassy
in Washington, D C,, addressed the
question of a Palestinian homeland.
According to Netanyahu, the as
sumption that justice and peace
could be returned to the Middle East
by "giving the Palestinians a piece of
land" is a faulty way of thinking.
"I think we tend to focus almost
exclusively on the Arab-Israeli con
flict," Netanyahu said. "We need to
look at the tendency for violence be
tween and within Arab states to un
derstand the conflict in the region."
