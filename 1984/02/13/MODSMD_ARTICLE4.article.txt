# Kennedy to receive ROTC petitions
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Daily staff 
In an attempt to prompt dialogue
between the University and the
armed forces, Stanford members of
the Reserve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) will present signed petitions
and a letter explaining their goals to
University President Donald Ken
nedy early next week.
The aim of ROTC members here is
to bring military science instruction
back to the Stanford campus, and
they have collected more than 500
I student signatures supporting their
cause.
But the leaders of the lobbying
students. Air Force ROTC
(AFROTC) members Erik Engebreth
and Bill Hook, are not optimistic
about a quick return of Stanford's
ROTC program, which was discon
tinued in 1973 as a result of student
and faculty opposition.
"I don't foresee us having a
detachment here in the next couple
of years," junior Engebreth said.
Hook, a senior, concurred with En
gebreth, but added, "We've got more
momentum than we really an
ticipated."
Engebreth and Hook are part of a
group of 41 who travel to San Jose
State University once or twice per
week for Air Force instruction. Stan
ford's approximately 20 Navy ROTC
students and six Army members are
cross-enrolled at UC-Berkeley and
the University of Santa Clara,
respectively.
While Faculty Senate approval of
academic credit for ROTC courses
would be necessary to reinstate a
program here, there are other obsta
cles facing the vocal AFROTC mem
bers who are lobbying for its return.
Most notable is the Air Force's
rejection of a University offer of
Stanford classroom space for ROTC
instruction.
"The problem lies not so much
with the University, but also with
the Air Force," Engebreth said.
"We're just kind of stuck in the
middle."
The Air Force is opposed to sen
ding instructors to Stanford under
the offered arrangement because the
classes would not be documented on
a transcript, according to Lt. Col.
Richard Barton, a professor of aero
space studies at San Jose State and

the AFROTC commander there.
For the Air Force to agree to in
struction here, the University must
be willing to list the military science
courses on transcripts. Another ac
ceptable solution. Barton said, would
be if Stanford and San Jose State ad
minstrators agreed to record the
classes on SJS transcripts, thereby
creating a "San Jose State at Stan
ford University."
The need to open communication
channels between the University and
the Air Force sparked meetings of a
volunteer student organization,
Stanford Students in ROTC.
Through the petitions — which say
that Stanford students who are en
rolled in ROTC "should be entitled
to ROTC instruction on the Stan
ford campus" — and a series of let
ters to Kennedy, the students hope
to persuade University administra
tors to contact armed forces offi
cials and discuss possible on-campus
ROTC programs.
Barton said that the initiative
must come from Stanford because
"we as the Air Force are not in a po
sition" to ask a university to allow
ROTC on its campus. "The exact op
posite is how it's supposed to work,"
he said.
An additional problem. Barton ex
plained, is that a statutory limit on
ROTC campuses has been reached,
meaning that even if the University
and the armed forces reached an
agreement to allow the program back
on campus, Stanford would be placed
at the bottom of a waiting list.
Engebreth said he is aware that
the limit has been reached, but the
efforts of ROTC students "would
get us on the (waiting) list maybe."
During autumn quarter, En
gebreth. Hook and seniors Bill Ashby
and Steve Widtfeldt substituted
recruiting activities at local high
schools and on campus for a
"leadership lab" which consists of
films or guest speakers so that they
would not have to spend extra time
in San Jose each week.
Hook called that situation a "one
time special circumstance deal," and
said he would have been just as in
volved in efforts to get ROTC back
on campus if the substitution had
not taken place.
