### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
Ever dreamed of being a secret agent?
Working for the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) may be closer than you think.
In the late I demonstrators here
protested and held sit-ins over CIA student
recruitment. But today students seem to be
relatively supportive of on-campus recruiting.
"I was at Stanford on Career Day in Octo
ber and had no problems." said Bill Cooley.
the CIAs northwest regional recruiter.
"There is interest and a certain amount of
curiosity. My table was one ol the busiest
ones out there."

and information concerning the agency.
"Wo want to hire the best, which is one rea
son we're coming to Stanford," said CIA Per
sonnel Recruiter Morgan Jones. "The effort
that (University President Donald) Kennedy's
been making to interest students in public ser
vice is kind of what spawned the forum.
"There used to be a story out that we were
restricted to the Ivy League. Maybe in the
days right after World War II there were more
Ivy types, but that's not true today," Jones
said.
Cooley said the agency recruits for many
different types of jobs.


The CIA will be back on campus later this
month, in a forum at Tresidder Memorial
Union on Feb. that will provide interviews
"We recruit from a wide variey of
disciplines for administrative-type
work." he said. "There are a number
of jobs for engineers in economic, po
litical and military research analysis.
We look for electrical engineers more
than others, but also for mechanical,
civil and aeronautical engineers," he
said.

Jones said mainly upperclassmen
will be interviewed for careers as
agents.
"We will talk to underclassmen,
but our main effort will be on senior
and graduate-level students to work
on a full-time basis," he said.
The agency looks for high grades,
activities and "all the normal things"
employers look for in future
employees, Morgan said.
"We are looking for good, out
standing citizens. We come down
very hard on drug usage," Cooley

said.
John Harris, a senior majoring in
political science, has already been in
terviewed by CIA recruiters.
"I thought being a poli sci major.
I'd have access to better information
and the most chance to actually in
fluence U S. policy it I became a spe
cialist in a certain area." he said.
Hut Harris lias decided not to work
for the CIA. because he said he was
not qualified for the overt opera

tions he wanted to perform and did
not wish to try any of the "other
avenues available."
"It you have athletic abilities or
are otherwise qualified, they have no
qualms about trying to funnel you in
the covert direction. I had no inten
tion of doing that,"he said.
Harris also said his political ac
tivism would conflict with a CIA job.
"I had been heavily politically active,
and if you're working for the CIA
you really have to tone down your
partisan activities,"he said.
