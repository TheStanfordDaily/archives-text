Soviets may name chief today
Moscow — The Communist Party Central Committee is
expected to convene a plenum today that could name a new
party chief to succeed Yuri Andropov, whose body lay in
state yesterday near the Kremlin as Soviets lined up for
miles in l()-degree weather to pay respects.
There was no announcement by last night who the new
general secretary would be. Attention focused on Konstan
tin Chernenko. 72, the Politburo member with the most
visible role during the period of mourning, as well as some of
the younger members of the ruling body.
These included Grigori Romanov, 61, head of the party
disciplinary body, and Mikhail Gorbachev, 52, a technocrat
whose power is said to have increased significantly under
Andropov.
Soviet TV did not say when the plenum would sit.
Andropov is to be buried tomorrow, with dozens of
foreign leaders attending, and, as it has been before, it
seemed unlikely the party would delay proclaiming a new
leader until after the funeral.
There were unconfirmed reports among Western cor
respondents in the Soviet capital that the plenum would be
convened this morning in time for the expected after
noon arrival of most foreign dignitaries.
Japan's Kyodo News Service quoted the Soviet ambassa
dor to Japan. Vladimir Pavlov, as saying the meeting would
be today.
Gemayel sees accord soon
Beit Mery, Lebanon — President Amin Gemayel said here
last night that his government stood ready to strike a
"historical compromise" with its Syrian-backed opposition
Druse and Shiite Moslem factions and expressed confidence
that an agreement would be reached with them "in the near
future."
Making a surprise appearance before a group of American
correspondents at the home of Ghassan Tueni, former
Lebanese ambassador to the United Nations, the
beleaguered president seemed eager to reassure the U.S.
public that the present crisis could be overcome and was no
worse than many others Lebanon has gone through in the
past.
"The Lebanese, when they are alone and (act) in good
faith, they are able to reach a compromise," he said. "Now
also we are able. I assure you we are capable to reach a fair
compromise. Everybody is ready for the compromise."
Gemayel's appearance, the first before the foreign press
since Syrian-backed Druse and Shiite militias took over
West Beirut early last week, appeared to be aimed partly at
reassuring both Lebanese and Americans that he was still
politically alive and far from despairing about the crisis.
Since last Sunday Gemayel had said nothing publicly
about the situation, and there have been growing doubts
about his ability to survive it.
He turned aside questions regarding opposition demands
for his resignation, saving that the issue at stake was "not
the person but the institutions" and democratic system of
Lebanon.
Bush declares Reagan wants
improved U.SJSoviet relations
London — Vice President George Bush declared here yes
terday that the Reagan administration wanted to improve
relations with the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the
death of Soviet leader Yuri Andropov.
The vice president, after meeting with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher yesterday morning, said that
he would "convey from the president his desires in that
regard."
Thus, Bush seemed to be following Thatcher's lead in ex
pressing Western intentions to reopen a dialogue with the
new leaders of the Soviet Union.
Bush and Thatcher both called for a "constructive and
realistic dialogue" with the new Soviet leader who will be
chosen to succeed Andropov.
Bush left London later yesterday for Luxembourg, from
where he will fly to Moscow to attend the funeral of
Andropov tomorrow.
Thatcher will also be going to Moscow for the funeral and
her visit was seen by diplomatic sources in London as an
other example of her new determination to reopen talks
with the Soviet leadership.
During her recent visit to Budapest, Hungary, the British
prime minister seemed eager to improve ties between the
West and the Communist East bloc countries.
Damage plagues shuttle brakes
Kennedy Space Center, Fla. — Two of the space shuttle
Challenger s four brakes were heavily damaged on landing
Saturday and cannot be reused, a mysterious problem that
has plagued all 10 shuttle flights, officials of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration said yesterday.
Despite the brake damage. Challenger was brought to a
stop in 10,500 feet, well within safe limits. But the possi
bility remains that unless the problem is solved and cor
rected, a full brake failure could occur on some future lan
ding, endangering the shuttle and its crew.
"It's an area of concern," said Kenneth Colley, chief of
the orbiter structures and handling section at the Kennedy
Space Center, where the shuttle landed for the first time
Saturday.
As in the past, the shuttle's two right-hand brakes suf
fered damage, and the two left-hand brakes did not, Colley
said. No one knows why.
"At this point, we really don't know why it's happening,"
said David McClure. a spokesman for the aerospace and
defense division of the B.F. Goodrich Co. in Troy, Ohio,
which designed and manufactures the shuttle brakes.
Burger attacks legal system
Las Vegas, Nev. — Calling the U.S. legal system "too
costly, too painful, too destructive and too inefficient for
a truly civilized people." U.S. Chief Justice Warren Burger
yesterday urged lawyers to "move away from total reliance
on the adversary contest for resolving all disputes."
In a wide-ranging State of the Judiciary speech here at
the winter meeting of the American Bar Association,
Burger also decried the plethora of "unseemly" advertise
ments by lawyers on television and the frivolous lawsuits
and dilatory tactics that are clogging the courts. And he
called for a "comprehensive re-examination" of the current
methods used to discipline unethical or dishonest lawyers,
noting that the profession's image was near the "bottom
of the barrel."
Burger urged federal judges to liberally exercise their
recently broadened powers to impose fines against lawyers
as a way to curb "widespread abuses," such as delaying tac
tics before trial.
"A few, carefully considered, well-placed penalties of
$5000, $10,000 or $15,000 will help focus attention on the
subject of abuses by lawyers," Burger said.
