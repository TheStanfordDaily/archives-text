From The Washington Post
Beirut, Ix'hanon â€” French soldiers opened a crossing
point on the embattled Green Line dividing mainly
Moslem West Beirut and the Christian eastern sector
yesterday, easing the virtual siege of the western side.
An International Red Cross convoy of eight trucks
brought medicine, blankets, flour, soybeans and
cooking oil into West Beirut, where those items had
become scarce since the resurgence of the civil war 11
days ago.
Civilians from both sides of the confrontation line
took advantage of the opening of the long boulevard
running past the Beirut Racetrack and National
Museum to rejoin families or get back to work after
having been stranded during the last 1 1 days of fight
ing between the Lebanese Army in the east and Mos
lem militiamen now in control of the west.
Many walked the six-block stretch where French
troops of the multinational force had interposed
themselves between the two sides after negotiations.
A few Lebanese army soldiers were permitted to

cross unarmed into West Beirut to visit their
families. When the soldiers reached the Moslem side,
they moved hurriedly past Shiite Moslem militiamen.
Sniping and shelling continued along the Green Line
both north and south of the neutralized museum
crossing. Police said one Lebanese soldier was killed
and nine civilians were wounded in the exchanges, the
lowest one-day casualty toll since the latest fighting
began.
In the Moslem sector large crowds strolled the
seafront and Hamra Street, the main commercial
strip, as Moslem leaders continued efforts largely suc
cessful in the past few days to restore an atmosphere
of normalcy by attempting to rein in some of their
unruly young gunmen.
But there were many unpleasant reminders of the
still unsettled situation here.
Two 16-year-old Kuwaiti students, twin brothers,
were kidnapped by gunmen Saturday but released un
harmed last night according to Beirut radio, after

Shiite militiamen tracked them and theii abductors
down.
Speculation here was that the kidnapping was
linked to the beginning of the trial in Kuwait of 25
defendents charged with involvement in the Dec. 12
bomb attacks on the U.S. embassy and five other tar
gets there.
There was still no word here, however, on Frank
Regier. a professor at the American University of
Beirut who was kidnapped from his home on the
campus Friday. The university appealed yesterday to
his kidnappers to provide the necessary medicine tor
Regier's heart ailment.
The deep pessimism here about the future after
the troubles ot last week was reflected in the contin
ued plunge in the value ol the Lebanese pound, now
selling at 6.15 to the dollar, nearly half the value it
had a year ago. when optimism was high that Lebanon
would be able to resolve its chronic problems.
