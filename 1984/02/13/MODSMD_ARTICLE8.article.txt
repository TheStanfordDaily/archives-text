From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — U.S. Marines now pre
paring to leave Beirut for ships off the
Lebanese coast could be sent ashore
once more if an agreement were
reached in which Syrian troops would
take part in a withdrawal of all foreign
forces from the country, Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger said yester
day.
Although details of the
"redeployment" ordered by President
Reagan last week are still sketchy,
Weinberger said the 1600 Marines
aboard ship would again be available for
shore duty as part of a multinational
force if the situation in Lebanon

returned to the condition that existed
when the contingent arrived 16 months
ago.
"If we get an agreement with Syria
— and many people are working on that
right now — to withdraw," Weinberger
said, "and the Israelis continue to ad
here to their agreement . . . there will
at that time again be a necessity for in
terposition of a neutral peacekeeping
force."
"If the conclusion is that the multi
national force should be used again for
that purpose, then the Marines will be
available for that."
Weinberger was interviewed on the
NBC program "Meet The Press" as

President Reagan flew back to Wash
ington. His statements also came as the
United States coordinated plans with
Britain. France and Italy for withdraw
ing its Marines to ships offshore, and as
officials examined hints from Syria
that it might be now willing to accept a
new Beirut peacekeeping force under
auspices of the United Nations.
There have been conflicting signals
from the administration on how
rapidly, or how slowly, the Marines will
leave their bunkers near Beirut Interna
tional Airport, but Weinberger indi
cated yesterday that he would prefer
that the redeployment be carried out
with dispatch.

He had earlier indicated that only
about 500 of the troops would be out
by the end of this month, and other ad
ministration officials had told Congress
the redeployment might not be com
pleted until spring or early summer.
Weinberger told interviewers Sunday,
however, that it would he "perfectly
feasible" to complete the operation in
less than 30 days.
He denied that there has been a state
of confusion surrounding the revised
administration policy on Lebanon,
saying there was uncertainty about the
pace of withdrawal because of the
necessity to coordinate with the other
countries in the peacekeeping force.
