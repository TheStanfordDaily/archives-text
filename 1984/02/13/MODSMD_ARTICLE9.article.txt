Andropov dies
Soviet President Yuri Andropov
died Thursday at 4:50 p.m. Moscow
time. He had not been seen in public
since Aug. 18 when he spoke with a
group of U.S. senators.
During the past months rumors
have run rampant over the reason for
Andropov's shying from the public
eye. Officials reported that he was
suffering from a series of colds but
that he was getting better and would
soon return to work. On Wednesday,
however, sources in Moscow began
speculating that Andropov was suf
fering from an ailment that affected
his speech or disfigured a part of his
body, thereby explaining his public
absence.
CBS News reported early Thursday
that the Soviet president had un
dergone a kidney transplant and was
in feeble condition. This was later
confirmed by further reports from
Moscow.
There were other indications that
something was happening in the up
per echelons of the Soviet govern
ment Thursday. Black limousines
shuttled important party members
back and forth to the Kremlin.
Andropov's son, Igor, a Soviet dele
gate at a Stockholm disarmament
conference, returned to Moscow
abruptly and apparently without rea
son the night before his father died.
Thursday afternoon Soviet radio
and television stations replaced jazz
music programming and other shows
with solemn classical music. Similar
changes in programming occurred
before the announcement of Presi
dent Leonid Brezhnev's death last
year. The change in programming did
not, however, preempt the showing
of ice hockey competition from the
Sarajevo Olympic Games.
It is not readily apparent who will
emerge to succeed Andropov. No one
figure is clearly in line to be the next
president. Many feel that Konstan
tin Chernenko, a one-time political
rival of Andropov, will fill the posi
tion. Much of this speculation stems
from his selection as coordinator of
Andropov's funeral commission, the
job which Andropov held for
Brezhnev's funeral.
Soviet experts offer Mikhail Gor
bachev, Geidar Aliyev and Grigory
Romanov as other possible succes
sors. The selection of a new party
general secretary probably will not be
made before today.
The ability of the government to
function without a strong visible
leader has become evident in the past
few years as the heads of state have
often played the role of absentee
leaders. This ability remained strong
even through such tense situations as
the shooting down of the Korean

jetliner and the deployment of U.S.
medium range missiles in Europe.
Brezhnev's last years in office were
described as ones during which he was
too senile to act as anything more
than a ceremonial chief. Andropov,
due to illness, moved out of public
view so soon after taking office that
his policies were for the most part
left in the hands of other politicians.
U.S. reaction
Just as the Soviet news agency
TASS reported the death of
Andropov, Reagan aides were waking
the president to inform him of the
news. The president at first had no
comment except for initial con
dolences. Later, however, the admin
istration seemed to recognize more
fully the chance for conciliatory
statements. The administration
called for "a constructive and realis
tic dialogue" and asserted that
cooperation would be important.
Reagan also called for a joint search
for ways to ease "the mistrust and ill
will that cloud our relations."
There was discussion within the
White House Friday as to whether
Reagan should attend Andropov's
funeral. Officials announced that
Vice President George Bush will
make the trip as the president's rep
resentative. The White House said
that the situation in Lebanon was
too critical for Reagan to leave the
country. Analysts speculated that
politics also played a part in the deci
sion.
Though there is no doubt that the
president would receive a large
amount of valuable political atten
tion by attending the funeral, some
said Reagan did not want to appear
to be bending to calls from Demo
cratic nominee hopefuls and influen
tial members of Congress, who urged
him to make the trip.
Diplomats and Soviet experts
agree that the new Soviet leader,
whoever it is, is unlikely to change
the continuing policies of that
country. The change in Soviet leader
ship will probably not change the So
viet's bitter suspicion of the Reagan
administration's attitude and ac
tions or the Soviet's stance on not
returning to arms negotiations until
the United States halts its deploy
ment of new missiles in Europe.
Lebanon review
President Raagan. in rhe wake of a
Democratic resolution calling for
withdrawal of the Marines from
Lebanon, announced Tuesday that
the United States would pull its
forces back to ships off the shore of
Beirut. Defense Secretary Caspar

Weinberger said of the decision, "We
are not leaving Lebanon (but rather
just moving troops) two to three
miles to the west."
U.S. military involvement in
Lebanon reached its heaviest levels in
16 months last week. On Wednesday
the battleship New Jersey fired its
16-inch guns for over nine hours into
the hills around Beirut, in an effort
to silence Druse and Syrian batteries
that were shelling Christian-held
East Beirut. U.S. involvement con
tinued Thursday with the destroyer
Moosbrugger and F-14 Tomcats
joining the American counterof
fensive.
Shiite Moslem and Druse
militiamen took control of much of
West Beirut and again called for the
resignation of President Amin
Gemayel Monday. Gemayel's previ
ously tenuous position was sharpened
by the resignation of Lebanese Prime
Minister Shafik al-Wazzan and his
nine-member cabinet the day before.
U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz said at the end of the week
that Gemayel's chances of surviving
his country's crisis was small.
Meanwhile a number of countries
began removing both military and
non-military personnel from the es
calating violence in Lebanon. The
British pulled out their token force
of 115 men Wednesday and the
Italians made plans to start a gradual
pull back of its 1600-man force. The
United States did not release a spe
cific schedule for its pull-back, which
was announced Tuesday, but non
essential embassy personnel and mili
tary support workers were evacuated
early in the week.
Before Thursday the United
States had maintained that there
was not sufficient risk in Beirut for
an evacuation of Americans; the
growing U.S. bombardment of the
opposition, however, prompted a
large evacuation movement out of
fear of Druse and Moslem force
retaliation. On Friday 1000 foreign
civilians were evacuated by American
and British helicopters and ships. The
evacuation continued the next day
and through the weekend under op
position fire.
With the U.S. puilback this week,
America's hopes of restoring
Lebanon's sovereignty and building
up its military can be virtually given
up. Now that the U.S. presence is
being reduced Syria has once again
captured basic control ,oi Uvfe
country, and Syrian leaders are rim!-'
ling over their options in regard to
Gemayel. Large numbers of deser
tions among Druse and Moslem
militia have dashed hopes for
strengthening Lebanon's military.
Gemayel, however, doesn't seem

ready to give up. He still has the
Maronite Christians rallying around
him and apparently hopes to convince
his opponents to reconvene the
Geneva reconciliation talks. This
would necessitate the abandoning of
the May 17 Israel/Lebanon
withdrawal agreement — which many
feel has little chance of being imple
mented anyway. Israel warned
Gemayel over the weekend that the
disregarding of this agreement would
mean the end of Lebanon's indepen
dence and would force Israel to oc
cupy south Lebanon indefinitely.
Reagan appears to be wavering
over the Marine pullout. In the ini
tial decision'to go into Beirut
Reagan was adamant about staying
to help prop up the Gemayel govern
ment; later he entered into secret
talks with Gemayel to try to get him
to, agree to the pullout plan.
GemayeJ' had often refcted to the
Marines as the symbol of American
commitment to Lebanon.
Reagan termed the Democratic
resolution calling for the Marine pul
lout a political move and vowed to
ignore it. However, in his final deci

sion to pull out, Reagan abandoned
his original promise never to "cut and
run."
Many congressmen felt that the
president's move to pull back the
Marines was purposefully half-done;
no specific schedule for the pullout
has been given. The question many
are trying to answer is whether the
Marines are really on a road away
from involvement or if they are
simply staying under different terms.
Shuttle comes home
The eight-day mission of the space
shuttle Challenger, which ended Sat
urday, included both dazzling
achievements and disappointing fail
ures.
One of the mission's major ac
complishments came at the finale-. It
was the first shuttle to take off and
land at the same site, which was in
this case Cape Canaveral, F/a. Using
the same site for takeoff and landing
can save the shuttle program quite a
bit of time, effort and money.
The two untethered excursions
into space by astronauts Capt. Bruce

McCandless and Lt. Col. Robert
Stewart were the biggest triumphs
of the mission, opening up a huge
area of possibilities for future work
and experimentation in space. These
were marred, however, by the failure
to set in place two expensive commu
nication satellites and the loss of a
target balloon with which the
astronauts were to have practiced
repairing malfunctioning space
equipment.
Of the 25 problems identified
with the shuttle itself, the only
major one was identified as the fail
ure of the robotic arm to respond to
electronic signals. The astronauts
were forced to cancel an exercise in
volving the maneuvering of a rotat
ing satellite suspended at the end of
the 50-foot-long arm. Officials in
Cape Canaveral said that 25 is a low
number in comparison ty the recent
missions. They said that the Chal
lenger was not affected by any of
the major problems which plagued
the last mission upon entering the
atmosphere.
