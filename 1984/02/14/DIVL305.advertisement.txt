Please, if we made
a mistake in your
Valentine ad on
pages 6 and 7,
don't call us. We
tried as well as we
could to decipher
the handwriting on
all of them. But try
as we might, some
mistakes surely
snuck by us in all
those wonderful
love notes. For
those that did we
apologize. Please
don't get upset â€”
just smile and have
a happy Valentine's
Day instead.
