## Stanford's first test tube baby born 
### KAREN BOLLERMANN Staff writer 
Linda Applegarth made Stanford
University Hospital history yester
day when she gave birth to the lirst
in-vitro — or "test-tube" — baby
delivered there.
The birth of Applegarth's 8-
pound. 5-ounce daughter Caroline
yesterday at 8:47 a.m. marked the
end of a five-year battle against in
fertility for Applegarth and her hus
band Paul.
All of the Applegarths' waiting,
hoping and wishing culminated yes
terday morning when Dr. Joel Klein
delivered the baby by Caesarian sec
tion. He described the delivery as
"very normal and a complete suc
cess."
The Caesarian delivery was neces
sary because the baby was fairly large
and was a breech — turned around in
the uterus.
Applegarth described the arrival of
her "beautiful baby" as "completely
euphoric, a dream come true."
Three years after the birth of her
first daughter, Applegarth learned
that she had secondary infertility —
infertility occurring after previous
successful pregnancies. In Ap
plegarth's case the problem resulted
from blocked Fallopian tubes.
The Applegarths turned to micro
surgery in hopes of countering the in
fertility. "I had one of my damaged
Fallopian tubes removed and the
other repaired," the mother said.
Applegarth became pregnant but

the pregnancy was tubal and unsuc
cessful. "After (the) tubal preg
nancy, normal pregnancy became
impossible," she said.
The Hillsborough couple's resumed
search led them to the Vital Initia
tion of Pregnancy program in Nor
folk, Virginia, where Applegarth
became a candidate for the in-vitro
program. "At the time, this program
was the only one doing anything in
the field," she said.
In the in-vitro process, upon ovula
tion the ova are retrieved from the
uterus via a tube inserted through
the navel. The ova are then combined
with sperm, typically, as in the Ap
plegarths' case, the husband's, in a
petri dish — and not a test tube, as
the name of the procedure incor
rectly implies. Once the ova are fer
tilized, they are transferred into the
prospective mother's uterus for im
plantation in the uterine wall.
"In-vitro pregnancies are more
tenuous early on and the mothers are
usually given hormonal support," ac
cording to Klein, Applegarth's
gynecologist. Once pregnancy is es
tablished, though, in-vitro mothers
like Applegarth become, in every
respect, "normal pregnant women."
Klein said.
Some drawbacks of the in-vitro
process, Applegarth explained, are
time and expense. The process can
cost anywhere from $3500 to $6000.
"It's time-consuming," Ap-

to be born at Stanford University Hospital. The mother says the birth
was "completely euphoric, a dream come true."

Linda, Paul and Katharine Applegarth celebrate the birth of 8-pound, 5-
ounce Caroline yesterday morning. Caroline is the first test tube baby
plegarth said. "Each time I went. I
had to spend 10 days at the clinic.
Some people don't have that much
time. It's also very expensive, and
that deters people too," she said.
In addition, women participating
in the program are subject to large
amounts of emotional and psycho
logical stress. "There's a lot of
waiting, hoping, wishing. It's very
stressful. My husband was a tremen
dous support, though," she said.
She said she and her husband are
looking forward to taking care of
their new daughter but "have no
future plans to try the in-vitro pro
gram again."
