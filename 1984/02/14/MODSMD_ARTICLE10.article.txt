# Police: Walk your bikes
## 
### 
Lunchtime Friday. White Plaza is terribly
crowded thanks to two student demonstra
tions. Pedestrians jostle each other and
bicyclists walk their bikes. But in the crowd,
some guy insists on riding his motorcycle. He
revs his engine and nudges his way through the
masses. When this action becomes too incon
venient, he swerves to the left and rides across
the grass island in front of Tresidder, his knobby
tires embedding deeply into the turf. Where are
the police when you need them? Wait a minute
that guv is a cop. No mistaking that gold helmet
and bulging jacket which tits close to his waist
to reveal a Batman-like utility belt.
The law says that motorized vehicles are
prohibited from operating within the inner
campus. This is a good law, it protects slower,
less mobile walkers and cyclists from speeding
cars and mopcds.

But it seems that police here mistakenly
believe that the only way to catch a moped is to
have a faster, better moped. Or that the only
method of catching lightless bikes in White
Plaza at night is chasing them in a cruiser.
However, these actions just create a larger
public danger. Combined with stiffer penalties,
foot and bicycle patrols could be just as effec
tive as motorized patrols.
We aren't asking that police ignore the safety
problem. Quite the contrary. We just feel there
must be better ways to enforce the law within
its own limits and not through some of the
show-off-type stunts we've seen around lately
— like riding up the Tresidder patio steps on a
police cycle.
The issue here is safety for bikers and walkers.
And neither we nor the police should forget it.
