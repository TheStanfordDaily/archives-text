## Making space for Reagan library 
### 
It has been argued that a site for
the Reagan library cannot be selec
ted until we know whether there will
be one or two terms of presidential
papers. This argument should be
reexamined.
The amount of building space
needed to store 20,000 square feet
of records (the volume estimated by
the U.S. Archivist for one four-year

VIEWPOINT

term) is 10.000 square teet of floor
space. No other part of the library
(reading room, administrative and
staff offices, exhibit space, etc.) is
greatly affected by the length of the
presidency. Thus, the size of the
building will not be significantly
larger if President Reagan wins the
November election.
Moreover, in its preliminary

feasibility study Stanford has
already made plans to set aside from
4.5 to 16.5 acres of land for a
presidential library site. Ten acres are
equivalent to 435,600 square feet of
space. It should not be difficult to
find an additional 10.000 square feet
on such a site, in the event of a two
term Reagan presidency.
From the archivist's point of view,
it is extremely desirable to have in
place a library building into which the
president's papers can be immedi
ately put at the end of his term.
Such a favorable circumstance will
avoid the confusion that occurred in
January of 1981 when Jimmy
Carter's papers were shipped from
Washington D.C. to warehouses
scattered all over Atlanta and un
suited for preserving and securing ar
chival material.
Planning for most of the other

libraries was well underway before
the presidents left office. The chair
man of the Board of Regents of the
University of Texas publicly an
nounced both the site and the final
building design for the Lyndon B.
Johnson Library on Dec. 1, 1966, two
years before Johnson left office.
11 Stanford accepts the Reagan li
brary in principle, it seems to me that
Stanford ought to assume the re
sponsibility of creating the condi
tions that will ensure the proper
preservation of the presidential
papers, which after all represent a
public trust. Careful but expeditious
progress in developing the program,
including site selection, fund raising,
and building design among other
steps, is required to meet that re
sponsibility.
