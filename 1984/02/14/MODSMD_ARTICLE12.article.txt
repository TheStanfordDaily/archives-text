# Looking behind the Russian bear
## 
### 
Misha, the affable Soviet bear who
"represented" the Soviet Union during the 1980
Moscow Olympics, is a truer symbol of his
country than his promoters at first realized. Un
known to tourists who snapped up the cuddly
souvenirs by the thousands, Mishas are produced
by political prisoners at forced labor camps scat
tered across the world's largest police state.
In assessing the threat posed to "our" super
power by "their" superpower, many take the
analogy of the Russian bear one step further.
When lie feels secure, they insist, he keeps to
himself: only if he is threatened or wounded docs
he become a menace to those around him.
Placed in the context of actual Soviet actions,
this line of thinking becomes a real paradox. If
the Soviets feel secure, why do they need to
court the forces of instability all over the world,
and if they feel threatened, why do they
jeopardize what little global security exists? And
how indulgent should those under siege be in thd
face of constant growls and sideswipes?
The answer to the latter question probably
depends on the gravity of the threat, which by
any definition is indeed substantial. Soviet
shenanigans are not limited to shooting down ci
vilian airplanes, and they are not confined to
overt acts of violence. Nor can the danger to the
free world be measured solely bv yearly tank and
missile production.
For these are the known threats, far less dan
gerous than the unknown. In its covert opera
tions, the Soviet Union excels, and these are
more insidious than any overt deed directly
traceable to the Politburo. Yet panic over

weaponry eclipses and obscures the scope of what
should rightly be the topic of profound concern.
Just as the United States uses the CIA as a
shield behind which to carry out some of its less
savory plans, the KGB executes all sorts ot in
vidious behind-the-scenes Soviet policy. I here
are several striking differences between the two
organizations, though, not the least ot which are
the systems they are committed to defend.
Another difference, which angers me as an
American and revolts me as a believer in the ideal
of democracy is this: I he KGB and affiliated
terror organizations, no matter what their suave
propagandists mouth about "peace and justice."
operate with the aim of dismantling existing
democracies. Our track record, to be sure, is not
excellent with regard to countries already under a
dictator's thumb, but this is more a function of
confusion than of malicious design.
Not so with the Soviet Union. Aside from
maneuvers in its own sphere ot influence — sup
pressing 130 nationalities within its huge borders
(at least some of whom would go it alone if
"voluntary secession" meant anything), making
the joke "our aircraft carrier" an apt description
of Cuba, inducing Bulgaria to recruit a hit man
for the Pontiff — much else has fallen within its
purview.
Throughout the 1970s and beyond, the Soviets
have forged links with almost every form of ter
rorist organization extant: the Palestine Libera
tion Organization, which aims to destroy a
sovereign country; the Spanish Basques, who aim
to destroy a country's sovereignty; the Baader-
Meinhot gang. Red Brigades and Japanese Red

Army, who aim to destroy a nation's democracy.
Lest Americans try to disassociate themselves
from the commotion across the Atlantic, the
Soviets thoughtfully supply us evidence that we
are not immune: The 1979 murder of U.S. Am
bassador Adolph Dubs provided a prelude to the
invasion of Afghanistan, and the seizure of the
U.S. Embassy in Iran by "students" 1 with discer
nible ties to Moscow are clear indicators that we,
too, are \ ulnerable.
Whether it's the KGB, groups which receive
organizational aid from it or even ad hoc terror
ist groups, underground organizations are by def
inition elusive and difficult to combat.
In an\ case, American intelligence does not
seem to be meeting the challenge of the gauntlet
thrown down by terror around the globe. While
the strategy for dealing with the Committee for
State Security of a massive power obviously dif
fers from that practicable in discouraging groups
of formerly idealistic leftists (or rightists), some
of the tactics must surely coincide. Hopefully
they will include a minimum of firepower and a
maximum of brainpower.
Whatever the tactics' grand strategy, the es
sence of the issue is clear. That shrinking area op
timistically called the free world must devote at
least the proverbial ounce of prevention — intel
ligence operations — to prevent having to use
the often ineffective pound of cure — military
action. At best, we can expect a stalemate.
Otherwise, the illness may well be fatal.

Whatever the tactics' grand strategy, the es
sence of the issue is clear. That shrinking area op
timistically called the free world must devote at

ligence operations — to prevent having to use
the often ineffective pound of cure — military
action. At best, we can expect a stalemate.
Otherwise, the illness may well be fatal.
