## History calls for civil rights reform 
### 
Jason Matherly's column (Daily,
Feb. 9) is a perfect example of the
kind of selective reasoning that is
currently very much in fashion in
Washington D.C. When the same
administration that brought us the
statement that there is no hunger in
America oversees a commission
which purports to be enhancing civil
rights by discontinuing support of
racial quotas, people rightly should
be suspicious.
I do not wish to quibble with the
basic points of Matherly's argument:
Two wrongs don't make a right:
Quotas represent a form of discrimi
nation; discrimination on the basis
of personal characteristics which do
not correlate with merit, i.e., is
pernicious no matter what its form
or purpose. In all these matters, I
am in full agreement with him.
However, 1 disagree completely
with his capsule history of civil
rights legislation and its purpose.
First of all, he fails to consider
the possibility that the compelling
reasons for the civil rights legislation
of the past 20 years had little to do
with the goal of equality under the
law: It was the response of a social
system under pressure.
Americans, mostly black, but also
others, were making it clear that the
pseudo-apartheid policies that had
prevailed since the abolition of
slavery would be tolerated no longer
Convincing those in power that
change was not necessary was not
easy: It took much effort in various
forms, from the non-violence of the
Montgomery bus strike to the fiery
urban riots of the mid-19605. Un
fortunately, the inertia of the
system and the urgency of taking
action combined in such a way that
the better outcomes of a "pure"
integration were not possible.
As is frequent with political
bodies, some efficiency had to be
sacrificed in the name of compro
mise. Instead of tax incentives to
encourage businesses to hire the
unemployed or the underprivileged,
to cite one example, we ended up
with a system of quotas. While it
may not have been what opponents

of the status quo would have
wanted ideally, at least it was some
thing.
It is a mistake to equate the
administrative rhetoric designed to
legitimize such programs in the eyes
of the public with their real pur
pose: the statements which Mathe
rly cites are post-hoc
rationalizations by administrators
designed to explain actions already
taken in hopes of increasing public
support for the programs.
Once the administrative rhetoric
is separated from the political
reality of the situation, the ques
tion of what quotas were intended
to accomplish is clearer. They were
intended not as some sort of mecha
nism for minority revenge in the
market place, but rather as an im
perfect means of meeting the in
creasingly compelling political
demands of a group who refused to
tolerate prevailing conditions. Pork
barrel politics have dominated our
political system since Andrew Jack
son first coined the phrase "To the
victor belongs the spoils." Operating
within these constraints, quotas are
about the best that proponents of
social change could have hoped for in
the short run.
Unfortunately, the long run has
not produced any feasible alterna
tives to the distasteful system of
quotas. Progress, both economic and
social, has been slow for the in
tended beneficiaries of these
policies. So slow, in fact, that I
believe Matherly's lack of innocence
in his one-sidedness is exposed: he
states: "But today, a majority appli
cant might be told, 'Sorry, you can't
have the job. We've got to fill our
minority quota.' "
The composition of unemploy
ment lines gives a better indicator
of the truth of the situation, any
statistically accurate assessment of
social conditions will show the
reality of the situation of minority
members in the United States.
My own opinion is that any of
these measures could be interpreted
to cast dispersions in the state of
social justice and civil rights in our

country. For this reason. 1 support
the continuation of any politically
feasible programs to improve the lot
of underprivileged Americans.

Maggie Prietoand Caroline Streeter
take a strong stance on the opinion
that "Sigma Chis have no manners."
We tend to disagree.
Obviously, a few members of the
organization made a mistake. Friday
afternoon a few members
(approximately four) were on the
third floor fire escape yelling at
passers-by. As witnesses to this
event, we can assure Streeter and
Prieto that this was not a violent
verbal attack on females by frater
nity boys. They were harassing males
and femafes.
However, as it was not all the
members of the fraternity taking
part, nor was it a house-sponsored
event, we feel that the authors are
unjustified in classifying all Sigma
Chis as lacking manners. As members
of the Band, we are often blamed,
by association, for the inappropriate
actions of a few. This is a gross
injustice.
Also, we question the reasoning
behind this article being put on The
Daily's opinion page. If Prieto and
Streeter sincerely want the offend
ing actions to be dealt with, a con
fidential letters to the Sigma Chi
fraternity would have produced
self-censure.
Exposing them through The Daily,
as the authors point out, might not
be taken seriously. Was this letter
meant to ask the Sigma Chis not to
yell at people — or was this another
unjustified attack on the fraternity
system because of the actions of a
few?

Maggie Prietoand Caroline Streeter
take a strong stance on the opinion
that "Sigma Chis have no manners."
We tend to disagree.
Obviously, a few members of the
organization made a mistake. Friday
afternoon a few members
(approximately four) were on the
third floor fire escape yelling at
passers-by. As witnesses to this
event, we can assure Streeter and
Prieto that this was not a violent
verbal attack on females by frater
nity boys. They were harassing males
and femafes.
However, as it was not all the
members of the fraternity taking
part, nor was it a house-sponsored
event, we feel that the authors are
unjustified in classifying all Sigma
Chis as lacking manners. As members
of the Band, we are often blamed,
by association, for the inappropriate
actions of a few. This is a gross
injustice.
Also, we question the reasoning
behind this article being put on The
Daily's opinion page. If Prieto and
Streeter sincerely want the offend
ing actions to be dealt with, a con
fidential letters to the Sigma Chi
fraternity would have produced
self-censure.
Exposing them through The Daily,
as the authors point out, might not
be taken seriously. Was this letter
meant to ask the Sigma Chis not to
yell at people — or was this another
unjustified attack on the fraternity
system because of the actions of a
few?

Jason Matherly's column (Daily,
Feb. 9) is a perfect example of the
kind of selective reasoning that is
currently very much in fashion in
Washington D.C. When the same
administration that brought us the
statement that there is no hunger in
America oversees a commission
which purports to be enhancing civil
rights by discontinuing support of
racial quotas, people rightly should
be suspicious.
I do not wish to quibble with the
basic points of Matherly's argument:
Two wrongs don't make a right:
Quotas represent a form of discrimi
nation; discrimination on the basis
of personal characteristics which do
not correlate with merit, i.e., is
pernicious no matter what its form
or purpose. In all these matters, I
am in full agreement with him.
However, 1 disagree completely
with his capsule history of civil
rights legislation and its purpose.
First of all, he fails to consider
the possibility that the compelling
reasons for the civil rights legislation
of the past 20 years had little to do
with the goal of equality under the
law: It was the response of a social
system under pressure.
Americans, mostly black, but also
others, were making it clear that the
pseudo-apartheid policies that had
prevailed since the abolition of
slavery would be tolerated no longer
Convincing those in power that
change was not necessary was not
easy: It took much effort in various
forms, from the non-violence of the
Montgomery bus strike to the fiery
urban riots of the mid-19605. Un
fortunately, the inertia of the
system and the urgency of taking
action combined in such a way that
the better outcomes of a "pure"
integration were not possible.
As is frequent with political
bodies, some efficiency had to be
sacrificed in the name of compro
mise. Instead of tax incentives to
encourage businesses to hire the
unemployed or the underprivileged,
to cite one example, we ended up
with a system of quotas. While it
may not have been what opponents

of the status quo would have
wanted ideally, at least it was some
thing.
It is a mistake to equate the
administrative rhetoric designed to
legitimize such programs in the eyes
of the public with their real pur
pose: the statements which Mathe
rly cites are post-hoc
rationalizations by administrators
designed to explain actions already
taken in hopes of increasing public
support for the programs.
Once the administrative rhetoric
is separated from the political
reality of the situation, the ques
tion of what quotas were intended
to accomplish is clearer. They were
intended not as some sort of mecha
nism for minority revenge in the
market place, but rather as an im
perfect means of meeting the in
creasingly compelling political
demands of a group who refused to
tolerate prevailing conditions. Pork
barrel politics have dominated our
political system since Andrew Jack
son first coined the phrase "To the
victor belongs the spoils." Operating
within these constraints, quotas are
about the best that proponents of
social change could have hoped for in
the short run.
Unfortunately, the long run has
not produced any feasible alterna
tives to the distasteful system of
quotas. Progress, both economic and
social, has been slow for the in
tended beneficiaries of these
policies. So slow, in fact, that I
believe Matherly's lack of innocence
in his one-sidedness is exposed: he
states: "But today, a majority appli
cant might be told, 'Sorry, you can't
have the job. We've got to fill our
minority quota.' "
The composition of unemploy
ment lines gives a better indicator
of the truth of the situation, any
statistically accurate assessment of
social conditions will show the
reality of the situation of minority
members in the United States.
My own opinion is that any of
these measures could be interpreted
to cast dispersions in the state of
social justice and civil rights in our

country. For this reason. 1 support
the continuation of any politically
feasible programs to improve the lot
of underprivileged Americans.
