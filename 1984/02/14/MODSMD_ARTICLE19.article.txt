# HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY

Al,
Here's a romantic elucidation.
With a tasty disposition.
Don't let midterms make this day
cloudy,
Remember it's a fact that I'm your
buddy.
And that means no more Aunt Jamima
l or my all time top banana.
So I hope this ditty's been witty,
Now how about that sushi in the City.

Kelly,
There've been so many times when I
just wanted to say hi, but could force
little more than a timid smile or a quick
glance. You have that effect on me.

you to end up dancing with yourselves.
One way or another hang onto
yourselves and remember that I'm the

say is that you're just what I needed,

don't cry the tears of a clown, just
because you're gunned down by the
blues. Thinking overtime will only cause
you to end up dancing with yourselves.
One way or another hang onto
yourselves and remember that I'm the
man (so to speak—. What I'm trying to
say is that you're just what I needed,

girls like me prefer to spend the night
together at least once before we

because you're gunned down by the
blues. Thinking overtime will only cause
you to end up dancing with yourselves.
One way or another hang onto
yourselves and remember that I'm the

say is that you're just what I needed,

blues. Thinking overtime will only cause
you to end up dancing with yourselves.
One way or another hang onto
yourselves and remember that I'm the
man (so to speak—. What I'm trying to
say is that you're just what I needed,

because you're gunned down by the
blues. Thinking overtime will only cause
you to end up dancing with yourselves.
One way or another hang onto
yourselves and remember that I'm the

say is that you're just what I needed,

Oh Sue!
I failed to observe just out my window
a discolored maroon bump on a branch
become a cherry blossom. A pink, clean,
durable metaphor of you.

Cheryl bright spirit illuminating life's
dark passages know always you are
surrounded by a network of love &
concern reaching from Stanford to the
stars!!
To 4 precious palookas:
I talk to you darlings with a message of
love: When the truth hits everybody,
you'll know that you all have somebody
to love. If ever I'm not next to you,
don't cry the tears of a clown, just
because you're gunned down by the
blues. Thinking overtime will only cause
you to end up dancing with yourselves.
One way or another hang onto
yourselves and remember that I'm the
man (so to speak—. What I'm trying to
say is that you're just what I needed,
p.s. I'd ask you all to live with me but
girls like me prefer to spend the night
together at least once before we
clampdown.
HOP —
You're the poet, so I won't try.
Besides, you know what I'd say — I love
you!! You make me so happy. "Every
Breath" — Love, your goofy
sleepyhead,
