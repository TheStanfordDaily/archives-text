# Lyman to speak at graduation
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Richard Lyman, Stanford's presi
dent throughout the 19705, will
deliver the 93rd Commencement ad
dress here this June, Universityâ€¢
cials announced yesterday.
Lyman, now president of the
Rockefeller Foundation, was among
four prospective speakers nominated
by a selection committee made up of
senior class presidents and University
administrators. He accepted an invi
tation extended by his successor.
University President Donald Ken
nedy.
Others recommended by the com
mittee, according to Susan Rasinski,
a senior class president, included
Robert Penn Warren, the Pulitzer
prize winning poet and novelist;
Robert McNamara, the former Sec
retary of Defense and president of
the World Bank; and Douglas Fraser,
president of the United Auto
Workers.
Rasinski said last month that War
ren, 78, was the committee's first
choice, but noted that his age and his
wife's ill health would make his
speaking here difficult.

Lyman's career at Stanford
spanned over 21 years, during which
he served as a history professor,

provost and president. During his 10-
year presidency, Stanford increased
its private support at the highest
rate of any major private University

and ranked third nationally in faculty
appraisals of graduate programs.
He left Stanford in the summer of
1980 after his election to the
presidency of the Rockefeller Foun.-
dation, the prestigious philanthrope,
organization.
Lyman will be the first Stanford
commencement speaker in four years
who is not a government official.
Biologist and author Lewis Thomas
spoke in 1981, but since then the
speakers have been former Deputy
Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher, Supreme Court Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor and Secretary of
State George Shultz.
Lyman, a former American corre
spondent for the British news maga
zine The Economist, writes his own
speeches. He is expected to address a
record-setting crowd of about
20,000 in Sunken Diamond, which
was chosen Feb. 1 as the Commence
ment site after University officials
decided Frost Amphitheater was too
small to accomodate parents and
friends of graduates.
Commencement will be held Sun
day, June 17, and ceremonies are
scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m.
