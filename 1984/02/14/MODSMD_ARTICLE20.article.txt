### LARRY GREEN Daily staff 
The fencing teams, both
men's and women's, heat a
strong club in San Jose State
Saturday at Roble Gym. The
victory closed out the regular
season for the women, while
the men have one regular
season match remaining
Stanford Fencing Coach
Buzz Hurst was "extremely
pleased with the win." Hurst
had the added satisfaction of
seeing his women's team finish
the season undefeated for the
first time ever. The team com
pleted its unblemished 13-0
campaign with a 10-6 win over
the Spartans.
According to Hurst, "It's a
major victory for the women.
San Jose is probably the tough
est team in the region."
The Cardinal received top
performances in the foil from
sophomore Jennifer Yu and
senior Pam Henck. Both Yu
and Henck topped their Spar
tan opponents by scores of 3-1.
Hurst said, "We had to stick it
to them (San. Jose). We led

from the start and stayed
there."
Hurst also said, "San Jose has
been a psychological barrier to
us for years. They're defending
NCAA champs. It's a major vic
tory for us."
The men improved their
record to 11-2 by beating the
Spartans 16-11. If Hurst was
pleased with the women's play
he was impressed "especially
with the men."
Top performances were
turned in by Larry Murk and
Nik Blevins in the epee and by
sabre Andy Goorno. Murk, a
freshman, won his bout 3-0.
Blevins, a senior, and sopho
more Goorno also turned in
spotless 3-0 victories.
"The men have improved
steadily over the year," Hurst
said. One of the Cardinal's two
losses this season was in
December to the same San Jose
State team. According to
Hurst, " Two of their (San
Jose's) best fencers were on
suspension (in December). The
team we faced on Saturday was
stronger than the team we lost
to in December."
