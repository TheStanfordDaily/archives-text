Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (AP) â€”
Debbie Armstrong paced the
United States to a 1-2-4
domination of the women's
giant slalom yesterday, out
duelling veteran American
Christin Cooper, who won the
silver medal.
Armstrong's gold medal was
the first for an American wo
man in 32 years in the giafrt
slalom and the first in any
Alpine event at the Winter
Games since 1972. She led a 1-
2-4 placing that was the best
ever for the United States in
any Olympic Alpine event.
After days of poor hockey,
weather delays for events in
which the American team was
expected to do well and poorer
than expected performances by
some team members,
Armstrong and the other
members of the giant slalom
team came through in record
smashing fashion.
Armstrong, 20, of Seattle,
Wash., was an unlikely hero. A
relative newcomer to interna
tional competition, her best
finish in World Cup competi
tion was a third earlier this
season. Cindy Nelson, the ac
knowledged leader of the U.S.

women's team, has predicted
that Armstrong would be the
star of the U.S. team within a
year or two, but Armstrong is
now ahead of that schedule.
"I just had fun, that was the
difference, I think," said the 5-
foot-5, 137-pound Armstrong.
"From the minute I got up
this morning I felt good. I
knew if I kept my head to
gether I had a chance to win a
medal"
Armstrong's combined time
for two runs was 2:21.38.
Cooper finished at 2:21.38.
American Tamara McKinney,
one of the pre-race favorites,
took forth place with a
combined time of 2:21.83.
It was the United States'
first gold medal in Olympic
Alpine skiing since Barbara
Cochran won the slalom in
1972. It was the first gold for
an American in the giant
slalom since 1952, when
Andrea Mead-Lawrence won at
Oslo, Norway.
Because of the repeated
postponements, the giant
slalom was rescheduled for one
day, instead of being spread
over two days as originally
planned.
