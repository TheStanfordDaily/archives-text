## 'Danny' well-framed, not funny 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Watching Zelig and the new Broadway
Danny Rose, you realize that somewhere
along the way Woody Allen turned from a
comedian into a comic actor.
Possibly that metamorphosis began in
his "serious" autobiographical phase, when
he worked on Manhattan and Stardust
Memories, but the self-pitying egotism of
those pictures, as well as our inevitable
identification of the characters he played
with Allen's own persona, hampered an ob
jective viewing of his acting. (In a sense, he
upstaged himself.) Zelig marked the first
time he carved out a genuine, original
screen personality whom one could observe
in isolation from Woody Allen.
When Allen utilizes his emotional re
sources to define a character rather than
draw attention to his own capacity for
feeling, he can really affect us. because we
don't feel he's bidding for our time. So
even those of us who had begun to sour on
his unrelieved championing of the inade
quate are pulled back in — we care about
Zelig, whose appallingly desperate need for
acceptance causes him to take on a variety
of appearances, and we care about Danny
Rose, the fourth-rate theatrical manager
who changes his opinions in mid-sentence
to curry favor with those around him. His
face leaner and tighter than ever before —
he looks like the entertainment industry is
literally starving him out — Allen talks
frantically, peppering his speech with worn
show biz endearments and thrusting his
hands forward like berserk marionettes for
emphasis.
Danny Rose tries so hard that he both
touches and embarrasses us; with every
move he makes, he can't help showing us
how miserable he is. When his most promis
ing client announces his decision to hire a
new manager, Danny is so profoundly
wounded that he can't even quip or change
gears in that hyped-up style he relies on —
his reflexes stop working.
Broadway Danny Rose is about the lure

of celebrity for performers struggling
around the periphery of show business.
Danny's psychological survival kit includes
an eternally optimistic facade, a tendency
to address his acts — water glass musicians
and balloon folders — as though he were
coaching first-rate talents, and a tireless
striving to uet his clients seen by famous

entertainers. His coup is getting Milton
Berle to watch a hotel gig by Lou Canova
(Nick Apollo Forte), a chubby Italian
crooner of the Tony Bennett-Vic Damone
school; in Danny's system, rubbing
shoulders with a celebrity is practically the
same thing as being one yourself.
Woody Allen found a marvelously ap
propriate framing device for Danny's
story: It's told as a series of anecdotes by a

group of comedians gathered in a restau
rant. and the men who exchange them are
legitimate stand-up comics — Sandy
Baron, Corbett Monica. Jackie Gayle.
Morty Gunty. Will Jordan. Howard Storm.
Jack Rollins.
The first few Danny Rose tales have an
ingratiating revue sketch spontaneity, and
we respond to the milieu, which Allen and
his crew of wizards (photographer Gordon
Willis, production designer Mel Bourne,
costumer Jeffrey Kurland. editor Susan E.
Morse and music supervisor Dick 11\ man
most, if not all. of whom collaborated
with him on /.elig) rendei with dazzling
authenticity.
But except for Allen's acting, the best
thing about the movie is the setup. The
main focus of the narrative shifts to
Danny's involvement with Lou Canova's
girl friend Tina (Mia Farrow, in a blond
wig. curtain ring earrings, smoked sun
glasses and a strident, br.issv Bronx ac
cent); through a series ot complications,
the mafioso family of another suitor iden
tifies Danny as the man who's stolen her
away and pledge a vendetta against him.
The pursuit scenes have \er\ little comic
energy or invention, and though Mia Far
row, playing a part way outside her usual
range, gives a skillful performance, she
doesn't make Tina especially sympathetic,
and her scenes with Allen lack the offbeat
down-played chemistry the\ had in /.elig.
After a while, it becomes obvious that
we're not intended to see Broadway
Danny Rose as a comedy: It's insistently
unfunny in patches, and sometimes scenes
that could be funny (like Danny and Tina's
attempt to get free of the rope that the
mafiosi have used to bind them together)
are shot so close in that the humor gets —
perhaps deliberately — short-circuited.
The movie gets emotionally scrambled, and
at the end we're left with less than we
started with. It's a very odd, evanescent
film — when it's over, you can't remember
what the point of" it was supposed to be.
