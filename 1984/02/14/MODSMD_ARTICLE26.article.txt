# The 						Dickies Stukas Over Disneyland
## 
### 
PI C' Dickies Records
Alter more than a two
year period of silence the
I.os Angeles-based Dickies
have released a new. inde
pendent LP that promises
to reestablish the band as
world leaders in contempo
rary power thrash pop. The
lirst side ot the album was
recorded late in 1980, prior
to the suicide of keyboar
dist/drummer Chuck Wagon
and the subsequent silence.
Included is a typical, high
speed remake of the ancient
Led Zep song
"Communication Break
down," featuring the ultra
high-speed guitar work of
Stan Lee.

I he second side, recorded
in January of 1983 is
definitely The Dickies at
their best. Exhibited best
on this side is the Dickies'
unusual and somewhat per
verse sense of humor. Both
the title track and the
rather obscene "If Stuart
Could Talk" sum up the
Dickies basic \ iew on music
— i! its loud, fast and non
sensical then, it sure as hell
is going to be an awful lot
ot lun. While many bands
have tried to mimick the
Dickies style especially
after their incredible suc
cess in the United Kingdom
just a tew years ago. no one
has ever come close to lead
singer Leonard Graves' in

describable (really) voice.
After all. it is what makes
the Dickies so special.
Stukas Over Disneyland will
definitely prove to skeptic
that not only have the
Dickies returned, but they
are better than ever.
