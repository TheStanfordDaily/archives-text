# 'The Dresser': dashes of humor, but distorted emotions
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Director Peter Yates
demonstrates so much affec
tion for the frustrations of
the ragtaggle Shakespearean
troupe travelling through the
provinces beyond war-torn
London in The Dresser that for
long stretches of the movie we
forget what it's really about —
the efforts of Norman (Tom
Courtenay), personal dresser to
an aging, shell-shocked knight
(Albert Finney), to keep his
charge functioning throughout
one particularly trying perfor
mance of King Lear.
Ronald Harwood's script
(out of his own play) tells us,
with unattractive emphasis,
that Norman is both enslaved
and defined by his relationship
to "Sir" — he operates as a
sort of nanny to the grand old
man — and that underneath
his devoted attentions Norman
is resentful of Sir's shoddy

drama, full of pregnant mo
ments and grandiloquent
revelations — and in Tom
Courtenay's atrociously maso
chistic performance — it's hard
to tell which of Norman's emo
tions is meant to occupy center
stage. Courtenay, who played
this part on stage and has dis
torted whatever life it may
ever have possessed into man
nerism, makes everything
about Norman glaringly ob
vious except the reason why
Harwood chose to write about
him in the first place.
In most film versions of
small-cast plays (like Educating
Rita), the process of opening
the text up for the screen vi
olates what presumably made
them worth watching in the
theater, but in The Dresser the
backstage and onstage chaos
that Harwood has added pro
vides the only reason for seeing
the picture — aside from Al-

Bert Finney's blustery hammi
ness in the role of Sir. (This
isn't one of Finney's great per
formances, and Yates makes
too much out of the pain in his
eyes, but most of what he does
is highly enjoyable.)
Filmgoers familiar with
theatrical tradition will appre
ciate the jokes about actors'
superstitions and the physical
difficulties of performing King
Lear, and everyone can respond
to Michael Gough's Sad Sack
expression as the overweight,
superannuated understudy im
personating the Fool, to Ed
ward Fox's mock-Shake
spearean improvisation when
Sir fails to enter on cue, and to
the moment when the tiny
stage crew creates the sound
effects for the heath scene.
The merry humor of these se
quences nearly offsets the
desiccated bitterness of Nor
man's tirades.
