### HEATHER WRIGHT 
The excitement over cable television may not quite be
what it used to be, but the pay TV industry still has
quite a bright future, the president of Home Box Office
(HBO) said here yesterday.
"The cable boom is over, the excitement is reduced,
and it's not as much fun or as easy to sell cable as it used
to be. But cable is still growing," HBO President Frank
Biondi said in yesterday's speech.
In the off-the-cuff speech delivered to a mostly
student crowd of 150 in Bishop Auditorium yesterday,
Biondi. 39. discussed cable technology and the develop
ment of HBO.
Biondi said more than 55 million homes can now
receive cable signals."Of those 55 million. 34 million
homes do subscribe to some form ot cable service. Ihe
other 20 million don't — either because it doesn't inter
est them or they've had a bad experience with local cable
service," he said.
But during the next tour to live years. Biondi expects
the total number of homes with television to reach
nearly 95 million, which will mean at least 20 million
more cable subscribers.

Today, the two leading pay television services are
HBO and Showtime. Both specialize in uncut feature
length movies hut are beginning to produce thcr own
movies and specials.
"We (HBO) can now outbid the networks tor any
boxing match we want," Biondi said.
A handful of "minor" pay services — Disney, Playboy
and a few regional sports channels — compete with HBO
and Showtime in the pay TV market. Biondi explained.
But in 1979, HBO controlled 98 percent of the pay
TV market.
" HBO was essentially the sole pay TV option," Biondi
said. " When Showtime cropped up, we thought they'd
never make it. We were very wrong." Biondi explained
that until the birth of Showtime, HBO had been
primarily a sports channel with only a few feature
movies.
In response to the Showtime threat, HBO added the
Cinemax, a full length feature film channel, to its collec
tion of services. "We gave the customer more choice,
lots of uncut movies that could be seen at different
times." said Biondi.
