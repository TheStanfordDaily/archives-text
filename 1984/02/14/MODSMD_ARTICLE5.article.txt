# Consulate visitors mourn Andropov
## 
### TROY EID Daily staff 
The Soviet Consulate in San
Franeisco opened its doors to the
public yesterday, so that people
could pay them respects to
Soviet President Yuri Andropov.
Ihe consulate doesn't usuallv
welcome visitors, so it was time to
drive through the rain and check
things out.
The downpour diminished into
mist as the car neared the consul
ate at 2790 Green St.. near the
Presidio on the hill above the
Palace of Fine Arts.
At the consulate, things looked

pretty quiet.
On the roof of the seven-story
orange brick building, the Soviet
Hag seemed particularly limp and

soggv at half-mast. A police car
was parked across the street from
the main entrance, and it was easy
to imagine FBI and CIA agents
peering from the windows of the
surrounding buildings. About a

dozen people had gathered at the
main entrance, clustered around a
reporter.
"You just missed being on TV."
the reporter told the group.
"They had a crew out here taking
shots just a couple minutes ago."
The reporter seemed pleased
that he knew something the
others didn't, but the thought of
missing a chance to be on TV
nearly made a child in the audience
cry. the reporter stopped smiling,
and the child sprinted down the
street, parents in tow.
Through the wrought-iron gate
and up the steps into the foyer.

the mood changed.
Two black-suited Soviet offi
cials, each with a red band around
the left bicep, stood at the top of
a short flight of steps beyond the
dark entrywav. Between them,
behind a glass pane, stood a Soviet
Soviet soldier. The soldier ap
peared to be made of wax, but
then his fixed eyes shifted to the
foyer below, in the direction of
his countrymen's glances.
One of the officials finally
snapped "This way" in a clipped
accent. His eyes pointed to the
right, toward the only room not
roped off.
Ii was much lighter in that room.
A rim of windows faced the north,
and it was probably possible to see
the Golden Gate through at least
one of them. It wasn't possible today
because Andropov's portrait was
standing near the wall, and you
wouldn't dare get too close to that.
The three-foot-high portrait, in
black-and-white tinged with a little
color, rested on a short metal stand
obscured by red and white carnations.
A brass plaque at the base of the
wooden frame said "Andropov" in
Cyrillic letters. It might have said

more, but at the risk of being dis
repectful, it wasn't worth kneeling
down in the flowers and checking.
About a dozen feet from the
portrait, along the same wall, stood
another Soviet official. He looked
about the same as the others and
wore the same black suit, the same
red armband. There was a small table
in front of him, on which rested a
book and a felt tip pen. The book
looked not unlike guestbooks in
museums, churches and restaurants
across the country.
About seven people stood in line in
front of the table, waiting to enter
signatures and addresses. Each person
passed the pen to the next after sign
ing. then paused to examine the
only other piece of furniture in the
room, a large china cabinet filled
with rather colorless trophies and ar

tifacts.
The impatience of the officials
seemed natural, given the behavior
of some visitors who appeared to be
more concerned with being in a real
Soviet building than with paying any
respect to the deceased. And when
an official appeared with several
reprints of the Soviet news agency
Tass' official announcement of
Andropov's death, the little crowd
scooped them up in not-so-polite
fashion.
Back outside the consulate, the
rain had stopped. The police car was
still parked across the street. The
reporter had gone, but in his place
stood a new reporter, questioning
people as they came in and out of the
building at a rate of about 25 per
hour.
"My wife and 1 just wanted to get

a look at the inside of the place." a
young man told the reporter.
His spouse nodded. "We'll probably
never get this chance again."
An older man offered his opinion.
"It's more than a chance to get
in." he said. "I'm very upset that
President Reagan has decided not to
go (to the funeral). We've got to do
something about this gap between
us."
Moments later, a black limousine
with consular corps license plates
pulled up outside the building. Four
men and one woman shuffled out and
hurried up the steps into the build
ing.
Within five minutes the visit was
over. The delegation was whisked
away in the limo, and protocol
seemed to be in order.
So the reporter went back to as

king the same questions of the same
sort of people, and got just about
the same answers.
Until he talked to an old woman,
who looked like a grandmother, ex
cept that her black mourning clothes
made her seem just a little bit
spooky.
"You should be ashamed of your
self." she snapped, raising a clenched
fist clad in a black glove.
"This whole thing is the fault of
you journalists. You just don't un
derstand that the Soviets are people.
You and the higher-ups in Washing
ton are just a bunch of jack asses.
Why can't we just leave the Soviets
alone?"
The rain had resumed. This time it
was the reporter who looked away as
the teary-eyed woman turned and
walked down the street.
