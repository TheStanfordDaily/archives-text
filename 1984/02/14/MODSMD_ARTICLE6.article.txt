Shelling concerns Weinberger
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was
upset when the battleship USS New Jersey tired almost 3(H)
one-ton shells into Lebanon last Wednesday, and he ordered
that future shelling be more restrained, administration
sources said yesterday.
Weinberger had agreed to the naval bombardment in a
compromise with Secretary of State George Shultz and na
tional security affairs adviser Robert McFarlane. who had
opposed the announced withdrawal ot U.S. Marines from
Beirut International Airport to ships offshore.
The New Jersey's use of its 16-inch guns to shell Druse
positions 20 miles east of Beirut was intended to show con
tinued administration support for Lebanese armed forces
and embattled Lebanese President Arnin Gemayel even as
plans to withdraw the Marines were drawn up.
Administration officials reported that Weinberger was
surprised and "depressed" by the scale of the shelling, which
lai exceeded any such U.S. action in Lebanon, and that he
sent word Wednesday not to repeat the barrage.
Weinberger said Sunday that withdrawal could be accom
plished "within less than 30 days." hut he had argued that
the 30-day clock should not begin until consultations with
other members of the four-nation Lebanon peacekeeping
torce had been completed. The White House overruled him
and decided that all but a residual Marine force should be
offshore by March 1 1, one month from last Saturday.
U.S. renews signals to Soviets
Washngton — The Reagan administration, renewing its
signals of eagerness to talk with the Soviet Union, called on
newly appointed Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko on
I yesterday to work toward "greater mutual understanding
and constructive cooperation."
In statements issued by the White House and the State
Department in response to Chernenko's selection as general
i secretary ot the Soviet Communist Party, the administra
[ tion struck a cautiously positive tone. It welcomed those
! passages in the Russian leader's inaugural speech that
seemed most conciliatory.
I S. officials also reaffirmed their interest in discussing
! the possibility of a summit meeting between Chernenko
and President Reagan but said that the chances for such a
I meeting depend on whether the Soviets are equally inter
ested.
They said that Vice President George Bush was expected
to touch on the issue w hen he meets with Chernenko today
and presents a letter from President Reagan calling for new
talks.
"It depends on the results of Bush's meeting — what the
exchange is. what the atmosphere is. what the response is to
the message (from Reagan)," one senior State Department
official said.
He said that the Reagan administration was not inter-
I ested in a summit that would be merely a "get-acquainted"
| meeting with little specific content, which some adminis
tration officials had suggested.
"It they just got together and chatted . . . that would be
a big negative." the official said. "But ... if there's a good
reason to have a meeting, there w ill be a meeting."
Bush "has a mandate to indicate to the Soviets (that) we
would welcome discussions with the Soviets on a wide range

Gemayel publishes 28-point
Lebanon reform proposal
Beirut, Lebanon — On a day of relative quiet in the
lighting, the attention of this battered capital turned to
politics yesterday with the publication of the main ele
ments of a 28-point reform plan that President Amin
Gemayel would like to discuss at a resumed conference in
Geneva on national reconciliation.
As published by the Beirut newspaper An Nahar, the
main elements of Gemayel's plan include:
• Establishment of a senate, in addition to the present uni
cameral Parliament, in which all Lebanese communities
would be equally represented.
• Require a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament on vital
issues and 55 percent majority for Parliament's election of
the president after the first ballot.
• Reorganization of security forces, with the army being re
sponsible for state security and the protection of Lebanese
borders and with internal security forces responsible for
"security of the people."
• Abolition of "all forms of armed manifestations,"
leading to the disbanding of military groups and militias.
A call for resumption of the reconciliation talks in
Geneva has been voiced several times by Gemayel, and a wil
lingness to resume them has been expressed by the National
Salvation Front, led by three of Gemayel's main factional
foes: former President Suleiman Franjieh, former Premier
Rashid Karami and Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt.
Hussein urges shift in focus
Washington — Jordan's King Hussein urged President
Reagan yesterday to shift the focus of U.S. policy in the
Middle East away from Lebanon and back to what he
termed the fundamental issues: the future of the Pales
tinians and the question of a territorial settlement be
tween Israel and its Arab neighbors.
Administration officials said they agreed, in meetings
with the visiting Jordanian leader, that Lebanon was a
"diversion" from larger regional issues but spoke ruefully of
a "national obsession" with the safety of U.S. Marines in
Beirut.
President Reagan, in a cordial formal statement after a
middav session with Hussein, said cooperation with such
friendly Arab nations as Jordan was "increasingly vital in
the face of the tragic violence in Lebanon, a growing terror
ist threat and the ominous cloud of war that hovers over
much of the Middle East.'"
Hussein's visit coincides with one by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, whose formal visit at the White House
today will be followed by a Reagan-sponsored trilateral
meeting that will include Hussein as well.
I he administration sees this week's visits as an important
chance to rebuild U.S. relations with two key moderate
Arab quasi-allies in the wake of the American diplomatic
setback in Lebanon.

Beirut International Airport to ships offshore.
The New Jersey's use of its 16-inch guns to shell Druse
positions 20 miles east of Beirut was intended to show con
tinued administration support for Lebanese armed forces
and embattled Lebanese President Arnin Gemayel even as
plans to withdraw the Marines were drawn up.
Administration officials reported that Weinberger was
surprised and "depressed" by the scale of the shelling, which
lai exceeded any such U.S. action in Lebanon, and that he
sent word Wednesday not to repeat the barrage.
Weinberger said Sunday that withdrawal could be accom
plished "within less than 30 days." hut he had argued that
the 30-day clock should not begin until consultations with
other members of the four-nation Lebanon peacekeeping
torce had been completed. The White House overruled him
and decided that all but a residual Marine force should be
offshore by March 1 1, one month from last Saturday.
U.S. renews signals to Soviets
Washngton — The Reagan administration, renewing its
signals of eagerness to talk with the Soviet Union, called on
newly appointed Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko on
I yesterday to work toward "greater mutual understanding
and constructive cooperation."
In statements issued by the White House and the State
Department in response to Chernenko's selection as general
i secretary ot the Soviet Communist Party, the administra
[ tion struck a cautiously positive tone. It welcomed those
! passages in the Russian leader's inaugural speech that
seemed most conciliatory.
I S. officials also reaffirmed their interest in discussing
! the possibility of a summit meeting between Chernenko
and President Reagan but said that the chances for such a
I meeting depend on whether the Soviets are equally inter
ested.
They said that Vice President George Bush was expected
to touch on the issue w hen he meets with Chernenko today
and presents a letter from President Reagan calling for new
talks.
"It depends on the results of Bush's meeting — what the
exchange is. what the atmosphere is. what the response is to
the message (from Reagan)," one senior State Department
official said.
He said that the Reagan administration was not inter-
I ested in a summit that would be merely a "get-acquainted"
| meeting with little specific content, which some adminis
tration officials had suggested.
"It they just got together and chatted . . . that would be
a big negative." the official said. "But ... if there's a good
reason to have a meeting, there w ill be a meeting."
Bush "has a mandate to indicate to the Soviets (that) we
would welcome discussions with the Soviets on a wide range
mil many levels."' White House spokesman Larry Speakes

Gemayel publishes 28-point
Lebanon reform proposal
Beirut, Lebanon — On a day of relative quiet in the
lighting, the attention of this battered capital turned to
politics yesterday with the publication of the main ele
ments of a 28-point reform plan that President Amin
Gemayel would like to discuss at a resumed conference in
Geneva on national reconciliation.
As published by the Beirut newspaper An Nahar, the
main elements of Gemayel's plan include:
• Establishment of a senate, in addition to the present uni
cameral Parliament, in which all Lebanese communities
would be equally represented.
• Require a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament on vital
issues and 55 percent majority for Parliament's election of
the president after the first ballot.
• Reorganization of security forces, with the army being re
sponsible for state security and the protection of Lebanese
borders and with internal security forces responsible for
"security of the people."
• Abolition of "all forms of armed manifestations,"
leading to the disbanding of military groups and militias.
A call for resumption of the reconciliation talks in
Geneva has been voiced several times by Gemayel, and a wil
lingness to resume them has been expressed by the National
Salvation Front, led by three of Gemayel's main factional
foes: former President Suleiman Franjieh, former Premier
Rashid Karami and Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt.
Hussein urges shift in focus
Washington — Jordan's King Hussein urged President
Reagan yesterday to shift the focus of U.S. policy in the
Middle East away from Lebanon and back to what he
termed the fundamental issues: the future of the Pales
tinians and the question of a territorial settlement be
tween Israel and its Arab neighbors.
Administration officials said they agreed, in meetings
with the visiting Jordanian leader, that Lebanon was a
"diversion" from larger regional issues but spoke ruefully of
a "national obsession" with the safety of U.S. Marines in
Beirut.
President Reagan, in a cordial formal statement after a
middav session with Hussein, said cooperation with such
friendly Arab nations as Jordan was "increasingly vital in
the face of the tragic violence in Lebanon, a growing terror
ist threat and the ominous cloud of war that hovers over
much of the Middle East.'"
Hussein's visit coincides with one by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, whose formal visit at the White House
today will be followed by a Reagan-sponsored trilateral
meeting that will include Hussein as well.
I he administration sees this week's visits as an important
chance to rebuild U.S. relations with two key moderate
Arab quasi-allies in the wake of the American diplomatic
setback in Lebanon.

Shelling concerns Weinberger
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was
upset when the battleship USS New Jersey tired almost 3(H)
one-ton shells into Lebanon last Wednesday, and he ordered
that future shelling be more restrained, administration
sources said yesterday.
Weinberger had agreed to the naval bombardment in a
compromise with Secretary of State George Shultz and na
tional security affairs adviser Robert McFarlane. who had
opposed the announced withdrawal ot U.S. Marines from
Beirut International Airport to ships offshore.
