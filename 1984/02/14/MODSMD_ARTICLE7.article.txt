### 
From The Washington Post
Moscow â€” Konstantin Chernenko was named
leader of the Soviet Communist Party yesterday to
succeed the late Yuri Andropov as the most powerful
political figure in the Kremlin.
The selection was made at a special meeting of the
Communist Party Central Committee yesterday mor
ning. It marked an unusual comeback for the 72-year
old party bureaucrat who owed his prominence to Ins
long personal association with Andropov's predeces
sor, Leonid Brezhnev, but who was passed over after
Brezhnev's death in November I^B2.
In what must be a moment of singular personal tri
umph, Chernenko reached the peak of Communist
authority on his own. rather than on the strength of
backing by his former mentor. He is the oldest man to
take charge in the Kremlin.
In making the announcement at 2 p.m. local time.
Moscow television said Chernenko was elected
"unanimously" as general secretary of the party by
the 300-member Central Committee.
It quoted the new leader as pledging to "exert
every effort, use all my knowledge and experience, to
live up to this trust" and to carry out the foreign and

domestic policies ol his predecessor, who died four
days ago at age M.
Chernenko's acceptance speech appeared to con
tain no departures from foreign or domestic policies.
A brief section on foreign relations was conciliatory
and included no direct attacks on the United States.
He pledged to continue the policy* of peaceful
coexistence and asserted that "we need no military
superiority. We do not intend to dictate our will to
others."
Chernenko coupled this with an assessment that
the threat to world peace is posed "by the reckless,
adventurist actions of imperialism's aggressive
forces."
Alluding to President Reagan's rearmament pro
gram, Chernenko asserted that the Soviet Union
"will not allow the existing military balance to be up
set."
"We will further see to it that our country's
defense capacity be strengthened, that we should
have enough means to cool the hot heads of militant
adventurists." he said.
Speaking about domestic issues. Chernenko ap
peared to embrace all Andropov's initiatives, includ

ine the need for "a serious restructuring ot the
entire economy. It is premature to conclude, however,
that he intends to push tor basic reforms as
vigorously as Andropov did.
While it was appropriate under the circumstances
tor Chernenko to pay a warm tribute to his predeces
sor he was not obligated to adopt specific aspects ot
his programs. Yet Chernenko appeared to have done
so. with some qualifications, presumably because
Andropov's supporters are in key positions, and they
are expected to keep up the pressure for economic
reforms.
Chernenko's rise to the top position seems to rest
on a combination ot his own talent tor political
maneuvering and the fact that none of the younger
members of the Politburo has yet had a chance to
solidify claims to leadership.
As Andropov's health deteriorated because of his
chronic kidnev ailment and other problems during the
past six months. Chernenko patiently rebuilt his con
stituency within the ruling group. According to
usually well-informed sources. Chernenko's claim to
leadership was never questioned following Andropov s
death.
