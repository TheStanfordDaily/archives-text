## Energetic Faye Knox advises black student groups 
### KEN CHAVEZ 
Tall and energetic, Faye Knox enters the
Office of Student Activities (OSA) with a
businesslike composure, perhaps a disguise to
the personal flair with which she carries out
her duties as the director of Stanford's
Black Community Services Center (BCSC),
assistant dean of student affairs, and acting
coordinator of the Office of Student Activ
ities (OSA).
This month is an especially busy one for
Knox, a 1972 Stanford alumna, who is heav
ily involved in coordinating activities for
Black Liberation Month. "Black Liberation
Month is essentially a nationally recognized
and celebrated occasion at least among black
Americans . . . which is designed to call at
tention to the contributions of blacks or
people of African descent," Knox said.
Although there are several activities
planned in celebration of Black Liberation
Month, Knox is especially excited about a
symposium of political figures addressing the
topic of a black presidential candidate.
"We thought we wanted to discuss the is
sues involved with the presidential election
and what is the significance of a black
presidential candidate in 1984... and cer
tainly that is something of interest to the
black community.
Panelists include state Assemblyman
Willie Brown and state Senator Diane Wat
son. "The two members of the state govern
ment each have their own candidate, but
they are not coming to push their candidate
per se; they're going to talk about issues
that I guess would lead them to a choice of a
candidate without doing a personal campaign
for the candidate."
BCSC's symposium will take place on Feb.
24 at 7 p.m. in Annenberg Auditorium.
Strides toward liberation
t
On the subject of black liberation, Knox
said, "my opinion is that I think the concept
of liberation is an important concept when
you talk about celebrating Black History
Month, because while slavery was abolished
in the 1800s, there are still remnants of
slavery in contemporary forms such as un
employment, broken families and poor edu
cational achievement, and there are a lot
more."
"So when you talk about liberation it is
important if one is really going to have
access to civil rights, human rights and parity
in the sense of this nation, that one has to
talk about liberation of black people."
Knox continued in saying that in her
view, "the concept is figurative rather than
literal as far as the U.S. is concerned, but if
you look at the international scene you find
that there are still African nations striving
for their liberations, and there is a link be
tween the black community in the United
States and our African brothers and sisters.
So the concept of liberation is one that en
compasses us all."

Confronting unique problems

As director of the BCSC, Knox, sees the
role of black student organizations as similar
to that of all student organizations —
"providing another means of enhancing the
academic resources of the University."
Yet, there are other issues that Knox
feels are unique to black students. "For ex
ample," Knox said, "black student organizing
and organizations on campus are seen as pri
mary vehicles for advocating certain needs
that black students have that may not be
being addressed by existing University mech
anisms."
These needs include "things like feeling in
fluential in an environment where one is not
racially in the majority.
"There are other needs that pertain to
differences in lifestyles, differences in cul
tural backgrounds that students want to see
evidenced in different aspects of their
campus life; there are needs that deal with
curriculum; there are social needs where
there are definite differences of interest in
terms of what one wants to do on a cultural
level that black students, and 1 think all stu
dents of color, feel."
Through her interaction with students
from many backgrounds, Knox finds several
similarities among different groups. "There
are feelings of isolation; there are feelings
of discrimination; there are feelings of being
associated with being in the minority in the
sense of numbers; and then feelings that
mirror conditions in the larger society. I
think Stanford is a microcosm."
However, Knox adds that being in an in
tellectual environment such as Stanford,
there are not blatant examples of prejudice
that may exist in the usual social setting.
Praise for theme houses
Knox's responsibilities include working
with ethnic theme houses which she sees as a
positive force for Stanford's minority
groups. "1 think they provide an opportunity
for students to have a space wherein a spe
cific culture can be celebrated," she said.
Whether the theme house should be com
pletely concerned with the designated
culture of the house is something "students
need to work out for themselves," she said.
Knox continued in saying that "as an admin
istrator, 1 always try to listen when that
question comes up, because I want to hear
what students have to say."
"There's nothing more exciting for a profes
sor to drop by the Black House . .. and then
suddenly someone asks a question of the
latest issue and the whole house sort of
erupts in discussion of it." she said.
Advising student groups
Although she transferred to Stanford
after two years at UCLA, Knox said that
she is grateful for her undergraduate Stan

ford experience because in dealing with Uni
versity departments to secure her own
academic pursuits, she learned things she can
pass on to the groups she advises.
"I find that the personal touch around
here is very helpful. If you get your personal
act together with the people you need to
help you with your programs, you can get
things done a whole lot easier. And students
don't understand that sometimes." she said.
Knox's goals for these organizations is for
them to become as "efficient, and sys
tematic" as possible. "An office that looks
at you and your organization as a serious, or
ganized, high quality, productive group —

the cooperation you get from a department
that views you in that way — is just so much
more than one that sees you as a
troublemaker," she also added.
Pursuing a doctorate
Currently living in East Palo Alto, where
she was raised, Knox said that there has been
a bond between that city and Stanford
which has been "made a little bit more spe
cial" for her because she did go to school
here.
Now, as a single head of household, parent
of three, working on a Ph.D. dissertation,

Knox has found that her educational pur
suits have run into road blocks. "Trying to go
through this system with those conditions is
probably why it's taken until 1984 to rev up
my engine and finish my doctorate," she
said.
Knox explained that at different times
she has had to devote her life to family and
work, but "this year I want to do something
for me."
Knox's doctoral program is in the sub
component of foreign language education of
the curriculum and teaching education divi
sion of the school of education. Her dis
sertation addresses the effects of foreign
language study on reading ability in black
children.
"My specialization was African languages
within that component," said Knox, who is
fluent in Swahili, Hausa and French.
She is especially concerned with second
language learning as it applies to black
children. "I happen to be one of those per
sons," she said,"who espouse the philosophy
that there is a significant enough difference
between the (English) language, as it is
spoken by large numbers of black people in
this country, and standard English that
these children have to attempt to learn that
warrant some approaches that may come
close to foreign language teaching tech
niques or mirror them exactly."
Importance of culture and religion
Knox's own children, Halili, 13; Rashida, 9;
and Muisikongo 3, (the names mean
"beloved," "one who is lead lightly," and
"the one from Kongo," respectively), receive
a mixture of formal and cultural education.
"All my children have gone through one or
another type of independent black institu
tion. I think the cultural foundation is ex
tremely important. A child must go to the
school system with a good feeling about him
or herself and that heritage that he or she
was born for," she said.
"My children sing in my youth choir,"
added Knox, who leads three gospel
choirs. "We combine family, culture, extra
curricular activities with things that will
reinforce self-esteem and provide awareness
of their Africanness."
As one may guess by her involvement with
the choirs, Knox's religion is a major aspect
of her life. "It's so central," she ex
plains, "my belief in a universal force greater
than man is a basis for how I conduct my
life."
"Trying to be a good human being, trying
to live a good life, doing to other people as I
would have them do to me," she said, and
continued in saying that "my experience
with that has been that it generally does
help in the way other people treat me. I
usually get back what I give in."
If this is the case, Knox is probably getting
more than one could ask for.
