## The
						Stanford Daily Reagan's ambiguity 
### 
There he goes again.
By promising to remove the Marines from
Lebanon while simultaneously shelling the em
battled country from ships offshore, President
Reagan has once again demonstrated that he is a
master politician. He also showed that he is a
poor world leader.
Amid all of last week's news from Moscow
and Sarajevo it was difficult to concentrate on
exactly what was going on in Lebanon, hut the
news that reached most people was simple:
Reagan pulls out Marines. That piece of news
removed the most contentious issue of the 1984
elections, much to the pleasure of Reagan's re
election strategists.
To his credit. Reagan had said all along that
the Marines would leave if Amin Gemayel's gov
ernment proved too unstable. Last week's suc
cessful attack against the government army by
Druse and Shiite militia and substantial Moslem
defections from the army left only Gemayel's
own Christian faction behind the crumbling gov
ernment. Reagan's condition of instability was
clearly met. The president quickly seized the op
portunity to rid himself of one of his only lin
gering political liabilities.
However. Reagan realized that the
"knee-jerk" withdrawal may not play well
among supporters of a strong U.S. presence in
Lebanon and some hawkish voters. He also could
foresee justified attacks for his hypocrisy —
one week after he blasted Democratic leaders
for being "unpatriotic" for wanting to

"surrender," Reagan surrendered.
So the shrewd politician struck again —
literally. While silencing opposition to the
Marines' presence, Reagan pleased his
"patriotic" supporters by ordering the battle
ship New Jersey to shell Druse militia positions in
the mountains beyond Beirut. Statements by
Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger and
presidential spokesman Larry Speakes were con
tradictory as to the rationale for the shelling.
But putting aside questions about the War
Powers Act and the possible killing of civilians,
the pounding of Druse positions let Reagan off
the hook politically. Now he can point to the
Marine withdrawal and say he is no warmonger,
and then point to the continued military attack
and say he does not abandon America's allies.
Unfortunately, Reagan's Lebanon policy gets
lost in this political double talk. America is
there, says Reagan, to back Gemayel's Christian
government. Yet given Lebanon's history of
warring political and religious factions, it was
clear that only a broad-based government would
survive. Nevertheless, Reagan continued with
the one-sided military assistance, under the
guise of a peace-keeping mission. Now the
Marines are pulled back, but Reagan's stubborn,
militaristic policy remains.
The questionable policy is not likely to lead to
a more stable Lebanese government or help
create peace in the Middle East, but the presi
dent's latest decisions seem to have been made
with another coal in mind — his re-election.
