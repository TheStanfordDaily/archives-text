# White House decouples policy center
## Board of Trustees approves Reagan library 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
After months of negotiations, the White House and
the University have reached an agreement to locate the
Ronald Reagan presidential library and museum at Stan
ford, University officials announced yesterday.
"We're pleased the president's papers will come to our
campus," University President Donald Kennedy said in
announcing the agreement at a news conference, which
followed a regular meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Board President William Kimball said. "We're all very
positive about this. We want to go forward and so have
instructed Don to set the wheels in motion for both the
library and the museum."
The announcement came after Presidential Counselor
Edwin Meese confirmed in a letter received by Univer
sity officials over the weekend that President Reagan's
acceptance of the library and museum was
"independent" of a University decision concerning a pro
posed public affairs center, previously linked to the com
plex.
Because Reagan's gubernatorial, campaign and
transition papers are already at the Hoover Institution,
the agreement on the presidential library means that all
of Reagan's political archives will eventually be housed
at Stanford.
Stanford and the White House had long been in agree
ment on the library and museum but at loggerheads over
the governance of the proposed public affairs center,
which Stanford insisted should come under normal Uni
versity governance and the White House insisted should
be run by the Hoover Institution.

An apparent breakthrough came last month when
Meese, in a Jan. 17 letter, offered a compromise pro
posal for governance of the center and suggested that
the White House would accept Stanford's offer of a li
brary and museum whether or not agreement could be
reached.
But University officials, saying that Meese's language
was unclear, remained skeptical and requested the
clarification that came in Meese's reply.
Meese, in his reply, reiterated his hope that the Board
of Trustees would consider "at its earliest possible con
venience" the White House's compromise proposal for
the policy center, which is that it be an independent na
tional center governed by a private foundation and built
on land leased from the University.
But the Board did not discuss it, Kennedy said, be
cause the Meese letter arrived too late "to serve as a
basis for informed discussion."
Kimball said the proposal will be given "due considera
tion," but that a decision will not come before the
Board meets again in March.
Both he and Kennedy have said in the past that such a
national center would not be acceptable, and Kennedy
said yesterday he suspects most of the trustees also "see
problems in it." Kennedy also said, however, that he
believes some trustees probably support it.

and getting approval to begin con
struction from city and county offi
cials.
"So we're heading down the road,
but it's not a short road." Kennedy
said.
Both sites being considered for the
library complex are in the foothills
and thus would be likely to draw op
position from local authorities and
residents who traditionally have been
critical of Stanford construction
projects there.
The most likely site appears to be
the one favored by the White House:

a 2()-acre plot adjacent to the Cen
ter for Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences. Another possible
location would be on Stanford land
adjacent to Page Mill Road and In
terstate 2NO.
Kennedy, clarifying statements he
made last week, said the outcome of
Reagan's re-election campaign is im
portant not to Stanford's accep
tance of the library but to planning
efforts because the volume of the
archives — and thus the size of the li
brary — depends on whether there is
one presidential term or two.
Meese. in the letter, said, "I have
been assured that, in terms of the
physical size of the building, the
volume of papers, most of which will
be stored underground, will have

little effect on the exterior dimen
sions of the library and museum."
Responding to the announcement.
Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell,
who with others at Hoover has for
more than three years been active in
efforts to bring the Reagan
presidential complex here, said in a
statement he was "delighted" that
the library and museum will come
here.
"Under this agreement this out
standing library and museum will be a
priceless academic resource for
scholars, students and others en
gaged in the study of American gov
ernment and history. . . .
"Stanford can take pride in being
selected as the site for a presidential
library that will be a significant con

tribution to our national heritage."
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley. one of the leading faculty critics
of the Hoover Institution and oppo
nents of the proposal to bring a
presidential complex here, expressed
disappointment that agreement had
been reached.
"From our perspective the problem
of the Reagan library has always been
the problem of the Hoover Institu
tion and its political activities, and
unless and until something has been
done about that, further identifica
tion of the University with this ad
ministration is ill-advised, and for
me, and perhaps for others on this
campus, represents a sad day in the
history of the University," Manley
said in a statement.

followed a regular meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Board President William Kimball said. "We're all very
positive about this. We want to go forward and so have
instructed Don to set the wheels in motion for both the
library and the museum."
The announcement came after Presidential Counselor
Edwin Meese confirmed in a letter received by Univer
sity officials over the weekend that President Reagan's
acceptance of the library and museum was
"independent" of a University decision concerning a pro
posed public affairs center, previously linked to the com
plex.
Because Reagan's gubernatorial, campaign and
transition papers are already at the Hoover Institution,
the agreement on the presidential library means that all
of Reagan's political archives will eventually be housed
at Stanford.
Stanford and the White House had long been in agree
ment on the library and museum but at loggerheads over
the governance of the proposed public affairs center,
which Stanford insisted should come under normal Uni
versity governance and the White House insisted should
be run by the Hoover Institution.

An apparent breakthrough came last month when
Meese, in a Jan. 17 letter, offered a compromise pro
posal for governance of the center and suggested that
the White House would accept Stanford's offer of a li
brary and museum whether or not agreement could be
reached.
But University officials, saying that Meese's language
was unclear, remained skeptical and requested the
clarification that came in Meese's reply.
Meese, in his reply, reiterated his hope that the Board
of Trustees would consider "at its earliest possible con
venience" the White House's compromise proposal for
the policy center, which is that it be an independent na
tional center governed by a private foundation and built
on land leased from the University.
But the Board did not discuss it, Kennedy said, be
cause the Meese letter arrived too late "to serve as a
basis for informed discussion."
Kimball said the proposal will be given "due considera
tion," but that a decision will not come before the
Board meets again in March.
Both he and Kennedy have said in the past that such a
national center would not be acceptable, and Kennedy
said yesterday he suspects most of the trustees also "see
problems in it." Kennedy also said, however, that he
believes some trustees probably support it.

University President Donald Kennedy and Board of Trustees President William Kimball announce that the
difficulties concerning approval of the Reagan library have been settled.
and getting approval to begin con
struction from city and county offi
cials.
"So we're heading down the road,
but it's not a short road." Kennedy
said.
Both sites being considered for the
library complex are in the foothills
and thus would be likely to draw op
position from local authorities and
residents who traditionally have been
critical of Stanford construction
projects there.
The most likely site appears to be
the one favored by the White House:

a 2()-acre plot adjacent to the Cen
ter for Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences. Another possible
location would be on Stanford land
adjacent to Page Mill Road and In
terstate 2NO.
Kennedy, clarifying statements he
made last week, said the outcome of
Reagan's re-election campaign is im
portant not to Stanford's accep
tance of the library but to planning
efforts because the volume of the
archives — and thus the size of the li
brary — depends on whether there is
one presidential term or two.
Meese. in the letter, said, "I have
been assured that, in terms of the
physical size of the building, the
volume of papers, most of which will
be stored underground, will have

little effect on the exterior dimen
sions of the library and museum."
Responding to the announcement.
Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell,
who with others at Hoover has for
more than three years been active in
efforts to bring the Reagan
presidential complex here, said in a
statement he was "delighted" that
the library and museum will come
here.
"Under this agreement this out
standing library and museum will be a
priceless academic resource for
scholars, students and others en
gaged in the study of American gov
ernment and history. . . .
"Stanford can take pride in being
selected as the site for a presidential
library that will be a significant con

tribution to our national heritage."
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley. one of the leading faculty critics
of the Hoover Institution and oppo
nents of the proposal to bring a
presidential complex here, expressed
disappointment that agreement had
been reached.
"From our perspective the problem
of the Reagan library has always been
the problem of the Hoover Institu
tion and its political activities, and
unless and until something has been
done about that, further identifica
tion of the University with this ad
ministration is ill-advised, and for
me, and perhaps for others on this
campus, represents a sad day in the
history of the University," Manley
said in a statement.
