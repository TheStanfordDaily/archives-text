# White House decouples policy center
## Board of Trustees approves Reagan library 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
After months of negotiations, the White House and
the University have reached an agreement to locate the
Ronald Reagan presidential library and museum at Stan
ford, University officials announced yesterday.
"We're pleased the president's papers will come to our
campus," University President Donald Kennedy said in
announcing the agreement at a news conference, which
followed a regular meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Board President William Kimball said. "We're all very
positive about this. We want to go forward and so have
instructed Don to set the wheels in motion for both the
library and the museum."
The announcement came after Presidential Counselor
Edwin Meese confirmed in a letter received by Univer
sity officials over the weekend that President Reagan's
acceptance of the library and museum was
"independent" of a University decision concerning a pro
posed public affairs center, previously linked to the com
plex.
Because Reagan's gubernatorial, campaign and
transition papers are already at the Hoover Institution,
the agreement on the presidential library means that all
of Reagan's political archives will eventually be housed
at Stanford.
Stanford and the White House had long been in agree
ment on the library and museum but at loggerheads over
the governance of the proposed public affairs center,
which Stanford insisted should come under normal Uni
versity governance and the White House insisted should
be run by the Hoover Institution.

An apparent breakthrough came last month when
Meese, in a Jan. 17 letter, offered a compromise pro
posal for governance of the center and suggested that
the White House would accept Stanford's offer of a li
brary and museum whether or not agreement could be
reached.
But University officials, saying that Meese's language
was unclear, remained skeptical and requested the
clarification that came in Meese's reply.
Meese, in his reply, reiterated his hope that the Board
of Trustees would consider "at its earliest possible con
venience" the White House's compromise proposal for
the policy center, which is that it be an independent na
tional center governed by a private foundation and built
on land leased from the University.
But the Board did not discuss it, Kennedy said, be
cause the Meese letter arrived too late "to serve as a
basis for informed discussion."
Kimball said the proposal will be given "due considera
tion," but that a decision will not come before the
Board meets again in March.
Both he and Kennedy have said in the past that such a
national center would not be acceptable, and Kennedy
said yesterday he suspects most of the trustees also "see
problems in it." Kennedy also said, however, that he
believes some trustees probably support it.
