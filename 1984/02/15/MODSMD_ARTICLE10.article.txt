## The 						Stanford Daily Remembering Dr. Kaplan 
### 
I his past Sunday, a compelling event brought
together hundreds of people at the Stanford
Medical School. Much of the crowd was
composed of top University officials and
prominent medical scientists. This meeting of
impressive character was not an announcement
ot a new building or the naming of a new dean,
though. Rather, 800 people gathered to mourn
the death and celebrate the life of Dr. Henry S.
Kaplan.
I he number of people attending the Kaplan
memorial testifies to the respect, admiration
and friendships which he had established during
his 36-year tenure at Stanford. Kaplan is chiefly
known tor his leadership in developing a medical
linear accelerator for cancer treatment. Today,
the accelerator treats thousands for many types
of cancer.
I he six speakers who eulogized Kaplan urged

us to remember him for his significant human
qualities. He was a demanding researcher who
was never afraid to fight whenever he believed
he was right â€” and he was right most of the
time. Despite his toughness, Kaplan was ex
tremely popular both among his patients, who
found him calming and optimistic, and among
his students, who were inspired by his enthusi
asm.
Kaplan's son Paul related a touching
anecdote. His dying father, while listening to a
Mozart concerto, said to his son through pain
and tears, "They never gave Mozart an endowed
chair while he was alive." The doctor's love and
appreciation for his friends and colleagues was
unsurpassed.
We'd like to thank Dr. Kaplan for dedicating
his life to preserving life.
