## Kissinger report spells doom for Nicaraguans 
### 
Managua, Nicaragua — The release of the
Kissinger Commission Report has stirred
renewed controversy over what is here per
ceived to have become an unreciprocated ef
lort to find a diplomatic solution to
political conflict in Central America. Both
Nicaraguans and U.S. citizens living here
have criticized the report's basic assump
tions. which they say undermine the Con
ladora process to seek a negotiated

VIEWPOINT

settlement. At the same time, they con
lend. the report leaves open the option for
administration hard-liners to use it to jus
tify U.S. military intervention in Nicaragua
and El Salvador.
The Committee of U.S. Citizens Living in
Nicaragua represents the community of up
to 5000 U.S. nationals thought to reside
here. A recent committee press release
deplores the Kissinger report's characteriza
tion of the U.S.-backed "contra" war
against Nicaragua as an incentive for
negotiated settlement. The committee calls
that logic "not only grotesque but utterly
insensitive to the suffering and material
damage it causes."
In 1983, contra attacks left 9*'4
Nicaraguans dead. As a percentage of the
population, more Nicaraguans were killed in
>ne year ol U.S. "covert" war than the
percentage of U.S. fatalities for the entire
Vietnam period. Countless other
Nicaraguans continue to be kidnapped,

tortured or impressed into the contra
forces, or left homeless and without work in
the wake of attacks.
Direct war-related material losses in
Nicaragua were $110 million in 1983. while
reallocations and economic development cut
into many vital health, education and eco
nomic development programs. Reagan's
characterization of Nicaragua as an
"economic basket case" can better be under
stood as an expression of the objectives of
not-so-covert war than as a statement of
objective reality.
Nicaragua was in fact the only Central
American nation to log a positive economic
growth rate in 1983. according to a prelimi
nary report released by the Economic Com
mission for Latin America (CEPAL), a
United Nations agency based in Mexico City.
This was achieved in the face of extensive
damage to important production facilities in
Nicaragua, and with the benefit of U.S. eco
nomic assistance extended to bolster the
floundering economies of Costa Rica. Hon
duras and El Salvador.
While noting that the Kissinger report
does recognize the social and economic roots
of the Central American crisis, critics here
fault the report for interpreting the con
flict in terms of the East-West confronta
tion. For Nicaraguans, who have endured a
aeries of U^.milha ry interventions in the
20th century. Jhertf is only one pre-eminent
force in the Western Hemisphere. Poverty
and oppression, while the legacy of Spanish
colonialism, are viewed throughout Latin

America as too often a relic sustained by
U.S. foreign policy. Chile, Mexico, Grenada,
the Dominican Republic and Cuba have all
paid a price for attempting to pursue na
tional sovereignity out from under the U.S.
umbrella. In Latin American eyes, the
Monroe Doctrine, not "Das Kapital," has been
the definitive mandate for economic and
military domination in the Americas.
While the administration has consistently

rejected the Vietnam analogy as relevant to
the Cerjtr.nl American■ -situation, we must
still consider that Kissinger shaped foreign
policy during much of that era. Neither does
his role in the overthrow of the democra
tically elected government of Chile inspire

confidence in Latin America.
Critics here say the Kissinger report
negates the rights of autonomy and sell
determination tor the Contadora nations,
marginalizing them as arbitrators of their
own problems. Most appalling . they say, is
the reports calling the Contadora process
"no substitute" for Washington's own
policies. The clear implication is that the so
lution to Central America's problems must

come from Washington.

popular revolution in a small nation might
throw off a U.S.-supported military dic
tatorship and embark upon a program of
pluralistic national reconstruction could
have serious repercussions for U.S. pre
eminence throughout the world.
Still, Nicaragua is not a country without
problems. Yet the standard of comparison
must not be a U.S.-style democracy with its
200-year history, but Guatemalan-,

Managua, Nicaragua — The release of the
Kissinger Commission Report has stirred
renewed controversy over what is here per
ceived to have become an unreciprocated ef
lort to find a diplomatic solution to
political conflict in Central America. Both
Nicaraguans and U.S. citizens living here
have criticized the report's basic assump
tions. which they say undermine the Con
ladora process to seek a negotiated

VIEWPOINT

settlement. At the same time, they con
lend. the report leaves open the option for
administration hard-liners to use it to jus
tify U.S. military intervention in Nicaragua
and El Salvador.
The Committee of U.S. Citizens Living in
Nicaragua represents the community of up
to 5000 U.S. nationals thought to reside
here. A recent committee press release
deplores the Kissinger report's characteriza
tion of the U.S.-backed "contra" war
against Nicaragua as an incentive for
negotiated settlement. The committee calls
that logic "not only grotesque but utterly
insensitive to the suffering and material
damage it causes."
In 1983, contra attacks left 9*'4
Nicaraguans dead. As a percentage of the
population, more Nicaraguans were killed in
>ne year ol U.S. "covert" war than the
percentage of U.S. fatalities for the entire
Vietnam period. Countless other
Nicaraguans continue to be kidnapped,

tortured or impressed into the contra
forces, or left homeless and without work in
the wake of attacks.
Direct war-related material losses in
Nicaragua were $110 million in 1983. while
reallocations and economic development cut
into many vital health, education and eco
nomic development programs. Reagan's
characterization of Nicaragua as an
"economic basket case" can better be under
stood as an expression of the objectives of
not-so-covert war than as a statement of
objective reality.
Nicaragua was in fact the only Central
American nation to log a positive economic
growth rate in 1983. according to a prelimi
nary report released by the Economic Com
mission for Latin America (CEPAL), a
United Nations agency based in Mexico City.
This was achieved in the face of extensive
damage to important production facilities in
Nicaragua, and with the benefit of U.S. eco
nomic assistance extended to bolster the
floundering economies of Costa Rica. Hon
duras and El Salvador.
While noting that the Kissinger report
does recognize the social and economic roots
of the Central American crisis, critics here
fault the report for interpreting the con
flict in terms of the East-West confronta
tion. For Nicaraguans, who have endured a
aeries of U^.milha ry interventions in the
20th century. Jhertf is only one pre-eminent
force in the Western Hemisphere. Poverty
and oppression, while the legacy of Spanish
colonialism, are viewed throughout Latin

America as too often a relic sustained by
U.S. foreign policy. Chile, Mexico, Grenada,
the Dominican Republic and Cuba have all
paid a price for attempting to pursue na
tional sovereignity out from under the U.S.
umbrella. In Latin American eyes, the
Monroe Doctrine, not "Das Kapital," has been
the definitive mandate for economic and
military domination in the Americas.
While the administration has consistently

rejected the Vietnam analogy as relevant to
the Cerjtr.nl American■ -situation, we must
still consider that Kissinger shaped foreign
policy during much of that era. Neither does
his role in the overthrow of the democra
tically elected government of Chile inspire

confidence in Latin America.
Critics here say the Kissinger report
negates the rights of autonomy and sell
determination tor the Contadora nations,
marginalizing them as arbitrators of their
own problems. Most appalling . they say, is
the reports calling the Contadora process
"no substitute" for Washington's own
policies. The clear implication is that the so
lution to Central America's problems must

come from Washington.
