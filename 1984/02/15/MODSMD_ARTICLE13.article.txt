## Discrimination is cultural, not legal 
### 
I read Jason Matherly's column on
"reverse discrimination" (Daily, Feb
9) with great interest. As a member
of a minority community, discussion
of such issues interests me. I was
impressed with Matherly's well
documented and logical argument.
He certainly does seem to have a
point. It would appear that any
intelligent person could plainly see
that discrimination of any kind is
forbidden by a precedent of laws
that goes all the way back to the
Constitution.
Who can argue with lines so clear
as "all men are created equal?"
Unfortunately, by the time I had
finished Matherly's article. 1 could
not help hut wonder whv it is that

this country, from its humble begin
nings to the present day, has allowed
such disgraceful discrimination
against minorities to exist in
total violation of and in opposition
to the very same laws that Matherly
uses so eloquently to support his
stance on "reverse discrimination."
Why weren't these soul-stirring
arguments about civil rights heard
by black Americans during the days
of slavery, by Japanese Americans
during the Internment Period during
World War 11, or by native
Americans as they were forced from
their homeland?
In my mind, the answer to this
question, if a rational one exists,
would be an equally "shameful

blemish" on this country's record on
civil rights.

So this is art
The spectacle in White Plaza last
Friday, a "happening" for the per
formance arts show, "Sold Out,"
was another instance of the sen
sationalist self-aggrandizement we
have come to expect from those
artsy-fartsy types who substitute
vacuous "expressive free
association" for real thought.
Flaunting a glamorous sense of
mindless license and irresponsible
excess, sustained by an obsessive
connoisseurship of expensive tech
nological gadgetry, these "artists"
are an insult to humanity. Their
happening was a pompous display of
creativity's absence. It was an ad
vertisement for a self-indulgent
show on advertising.
If Robert Greenberg (the student
director of this misdirection) thinks
that advertising is bad. then why
does he do it? And if he thinks it's
good, what's the point of his show?
This behavior, "legitimized" by its
claim for "thought provocation," is
typical of children with too much
leisure and too little discipline. I'm
not against art. in fact 1 think art is
good, but Friday's happening is
certainly not art. It was a hollow
gimmick to dupe the public.
Greenberg. himself, couldn't tell a
TV interviewer what the show or
happening meant. He just kept
asking: "What do you think? Why?"
Artists who don't know what they
are doing insist that their works are
"whatever you want them to be."
They do this so they can feel smug
and certain about themselves as
they try to make fools of the audi
ence. And what's really sick is some
of those in the audience pretending
to like the stuff, pretending they
know what it means.
It's high time we in the audience
stopped putting up with these
"artists." They should leave White
Plaza free for legitimate activities
â€” even Thursday's eccentric evan
gelist. At least he had something to
say.
