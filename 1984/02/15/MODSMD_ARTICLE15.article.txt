# Lebanon: Foreigners go home

### 
At the gut level, the current crisis in Lebanon appears
to be a tragic, bloody mess. Beirut is a violent bat
tleground; too many innocent people have lost their lives
and sadly it looks like the situation will get worse before
it ever gets better.
Lebanese President Amin Gemayel has suffered the
defection of his prime minister and cabinet and his
teetering hold on power may have already disintegrated
by the time this column goes to press. On a higher level.
Lebanon is a stage for Syrian and Israeli political ambi

Lebanon to the detriment of Lebanon and its people.

competition. All of these nations are

people.

Syrian support and advice, but only so far as it furthers
their aim of ousting Gemayel and the Maronites. Syria
will have a hard time making the Druse or Shiites do
something the latter don't want to do, arms shipments
notwithstanding. Syria is using the Druse and Shiites,
and vice versa. A similar relationship exists between the
Israelis and the Christians. Each takes the support of
the other only to advance selfish interests.
Enter the United States and the Soviet Union. We
support the Israelis, and they support the Christians.
The Soviets support Syria, who supports the Druse and
Shiites. What are the superpowers doing in Lebanon?
The U.S. and U.S.S.R. have even less claim to get in
volved than do the Syrians and Israelis.
It's too much to expect Israel and Syria to withdraw,
but maybe we can de-escalate matters by leaving and
getting the Soviets to do the same (they have some 5000
personnel in Syria.) Without U.S. support the Lebanese
government may be forced to accommodate the Muslims
and thus bring some stability to the country. Stability
would remove any pretense Syria or Israel had for inter
vening further into Lebanon's internal affairs, and this
would effectively detach the superpowers.
Both Syrian and Israel are involved in Lebanon for raw
political ambitions. Syrian President Hafez Assad is no
doubt pressing for partitioning and dismembering of
Lebanon. Syria has ancient territorial claims there: some
60 years ago, the French created modern Lebanon by
hacking off land from Syria. Assad can be counted on to
take back what he can.
Assad is also bidding for major-power status in the
Middle East. By involving Syria militarily in Lebanon

(there are 40,000 Syrian troops in Northern Lebanon),
Assad has involved Syria politically and integrally in the
wider scope of regional affairs.
Israel does not have bloodless hands either. The Israeli
invasion of Lebanon, ostensibly to clean out the Pales
tine Liberation Organization, carried all the
way to Beirut and helped trigger this, the latest and
most intense round of the civil war. Israeli complicity in
the massacres at the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila
left hundreds of civilians dead, while thousands died in
the invasion and the indiscriminate shelling of Beirut.
In terms of general Middle East affairs, Israel is very
stubborn. Israeli leaders want more land, believing it to
be theirs either by biblical decree or because they feel it
serves as a security buffer. Accordingly, Israel has ac
celerated Jewish settlement of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Israel undoubtedly hopes to achieve de facto con
trol of these regions, despite the fact that by doing so it
violates parts of the Camp David accords. Former Presi
dents Carter and Ford both believed that Israeli occupa
tion of these areas was a "major obstacle" to ultimate
peace in the Middle East.
Both Syria and Israel now have too much at stake in
Lebanon for either one to just pack up and let the
Lebanese determine their own fate. Neither wants the
other to have more influence or territory in the region,
and will stay to make sure that doesn't happen. But
what about the United States — why are we there?
First off, there's oil in them thar hills of the Middle
East, and the United States would like independent mil
itary bases so that U.S. military force could be applied
anywhere in the region. We don't want to lose another
Iran and helplessly endure oil shock. An American
supported Lebanese leader would welcome U.S. military
strength in his country, and the United States would
welcome the chance to build some airfields.
Secondly, we fear Soviet encroachment in the region.
We see Syria supplied by the Soviets and automatically
our commie-plot detectors go off. Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger once referred to Syria as "just an
other outpost of the Soviet empire." This administra
tion forgets that the Soviets have no real influence in
the area despite their childlike appeals: "Be my best
friend and I'll give you AK.-47 assault rifles
They've been kicked out of Egypt, have earned the en
mity of Iran and have never been consulted by anybody
about any major initiative. Most importantly, the
Soviets officially have no God, their Communist atheism
runs against the grain of Arab, Muslim and Christan
alike.
So what are we doing there, risking so much for so
little.' We ve got to realize that we have no control over
what happens over there, even if we were to land 10,000
troops tomorrow. We would only find ourselves in an
other Vietnam, only this time with Soviet soldiers to
contend with as well. We should encourage the Israelis,
Syrians and Soviets to show restraint and let the civil
war play itself out. And just to make sure, why doesn't
someone ask the Lebanese civilians? They are the ones
everybody seems to have forgotten.

Middle East. By involving Syria militarily in Lebanon

(there are 40,000 Syrian troops in Northern Lebanon),
Assad has involved Syria politically and integrally in the
wider scope of regional affairs.
Israel does not have bloodless hands either. The Israeli
invasion of Lebanon, ostensibly to clean out the Pales
tine Liberation Organization, carried all the
way to Beirut and helped trigger this, the latest and
most intense round of the civil war. Israeli complicity in
the massacres at the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila
left hundreds of civilians dead, while thousands died in
the invasion and the indiscriminate shelling of Beirut.
In terms of general Middle East affairs, Israel is very
stubborn. Israeli leaders want more land, believing it to
be theirs either by biblical decree or because they feel it
serves as a security buffer. Accordingly, Israel has ac
celerated Jewish settlement of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Israel undoubtedly hopes to achieve de facto con
trol of these regions, despite the fact that by doing so it
violates parts of the Camp David accords. Former Presi
dents Carter and Ford both believed that Israeli occupa
tion of these areas was a "major obstacle" to ultimate
peace in the Middle East.
Both Syria and Israel now have too much at stake in
Lebanon for either one to just pack up and let the
Lebanese determine their own fate. Neither wants the
other to have more influence or territory in the region,
and will stay to make sure that doesn't happen. But
what about the United States — why are we there?
First off, there's oil in them thar hills of the Middle
East, and the United States would like independent mil
itary bases so that U.S. military force could be applied
anywhere in the region. We don't want to lose another
Iran and helplessly endure oil shock. An American
supported Lebanese leader would welcome U.S. military
strength in his country, and the United States would
welcome the chance to build some airfields.
Secondly, we fear Soviet encroachment in the region.
We see Syria supplied by the Soviets and automatically
our commie-plot detectors go off. Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger once referred to Syria as "just an
other outpost of the Soviet empire." This administra
tion forgets that the Soviets have no real influence in
the area despite their childlike appeals: "Be my best
friend and I'll give you AK.-47 assault rifles
They've been kicked out of Egypt, have earned the en
mity of Iran and have never been consulted by anybody
about any major initiative. Most importantly, the
Soviets officially have no God, their Communist atheism
runs against the grain of Arab, Muslim and Christan
alike.
So what are we doing there, risking so much for so
little.' We ve got to realize that we have no control over
what happens over there, even if we were to land 10,000
troops tomorrow. We would only find ourselves in an
other Vietnam, only this time with Soviet soldiers to
contend with as well. We should encourage the Israelis,
Syrians and Soviets to show restraint and let the civil
war play itself out. And just to make sure, why doesn't
someone ask the Lebanese civilians? They are the ones
everybody seems to have forgotten.

At the gut level, the current crisis in Lebanon appears
to be a tragic, bloody mess. Beirut is a violent bat
tleground; too many innocent people have lost their lives
and sadly it looks like the situation will get worse before
it ever gets better.
Lebanese President Amin Gemayel has suffered the
defection of his prime minister and cabinet and his
teetering hold on power may have already disintegrated
by the time this column goes to press. On a higher level.
Lebanon is a stage for Syrian and Israeli political ambi
tions and a showcase for U.S.-Soviet superpower compe
tition. All of these nations are unjustly intervening in
Lebanon to the detriment of Lebanon and its people.
The intervention of these nations also lends dangerous
escalatory trends to the conflict.
Israel and Syria have both stuck their heads in this
beehive under the pretense of protecting "national in
terests" but with the effect of intensifying and
militarizing the conflict. Both Israel and Syria supply
weapons to their allies. The Druse and Shiites accept

Syrian support and advice, but only so far as it furthers
their aim of ousting Gemayel and the Maronites. Syria
will have a hard time making the Druse or Shiites do
something the latter don't want to do, arms shipments
notwithstanding. Syria is using the Druse and Shiites,
and vice versa. A similar relationship exists between the
Israelis and the Christians. Each takes the support of
the other only to advance selfish interests.
Enter the United States and the Soviet Union. We
support the Israelis, and they support the Christians.
The Soviets support Syria, who supports the Druse and
Shiites. What are the superpowers doing in Lebanon?
The U.S. and U.S.S.R. have even less claim to get in
volved than do the Syrians and Israelis.
It's too much to expect Israel and Syria to withdraw,
but maybe we can de-escalate matters by leaving and
getting the Soviets to do the same (they have some 5000
personnel in Syria.) Without U.S. support the Lebanese
government may be forced to accommodate the Muslims
and thus bring some stability to the country. Stability
would remove any pretense Syria or Israel had for inter
vening further into Lebanon's internal affairs, and this
would effectively detach the superpowers.
Both Syrian and Israel are involved in Lebanon for raw
political ambitions. Syrian President Hafez Assad is no
doubt pressing for partitioning and dismembering of
Lebanon. Syria has ancient territorial claims there: some
60 years ago, the French created modern Lebanon by
hacking off land from Syria. Assad can be counted on to
take back what he can.
