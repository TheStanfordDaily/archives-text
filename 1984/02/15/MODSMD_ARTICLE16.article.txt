# Student sees Sandinista government working well
## 
### HEATHER WRIGHT 
Last January, a contingent
of 25 Americans, including a
Stanford senior, journeyed to
Central America in search of
answers to some pressing ques
tions, not the least of which
was the role of the United
States in its support of various
political factions.
From January 7-22, Kriss
Baxter, a Zapata residence as
sistant, participated in what
was to he a "comparative
study" of Honduras and
Nicaragua. She returned ex
pressing frustration with U.S.
policy in Nicaragua and Central
America as a whole. Baxter said
the trip was supposed to be an
exercise in understanding dif
ferent types of governments.
"The idea was to take two
countries in similar stages of
development, but with differ
ent forms of government, and
to analyze their successes and
failures," she explained.
But the "comparative" ele
ment of the study was foregone
when most of the Americans
were unable to obtain Hon
duran visas.
Instead, Baxter and the
others , sponsored by OXFAM,
a non-profit, humanitarian
fund emphasizing self-help to
35 Latin, Asian and African
nations, spent the entire two
weeks of their trip in
Nicaragua.

Baxter, who is majoring in
human biology with an empha
sis on Third World health, is
the third Stanford student in
three years to participate in
the OXFAM study program.
She and fellow traveller Dennis
Godby, 27, a full-time volun
teer for several non-profit or
ganizations, said they saw
evidence that the Sandinista
government is "working."
"The Sandinistas have made
great strides in social services."
Godby said. "Since 1979 when
the Sandinistas came to power,
illiteracy has dropped from 50
to 12 percent. And infant mor
tality has decreased from 1 20
to only 88 deaths per 1000
births," he added.
Baxter and Godby said they
also witnessed religious
freedom, land reform, in
creased production, higher
standards of living and political
pluralism.
"We saw billboards along the
highways advertising non-
Sandinista candidates," Baxter
said. "Yet the U.S. govern
ment claims there is no free
electoral process in Nicaragua."
While Baxter and Godby
praised Sandinista reform ef
forts, they said they were
"appalled by the $43 million in
U.S. aid going to the Contras."
The Contras are anti-
Sandinista guerillas receiving

military training, advice and
equipment in neighboring Hon
duras and Costa Rica.
But Godby said the Contras
are democratic "freedom
fighters" in name alone. "The
Contras are made up of the
remains of Somoza's National
Guard," he said.
"They are beasts who rape,
pillage and murder throughout
the Nicaraguan countryside,"
Godby said.
But, Baxter pointed out,
"From what we saw, the
Nicaraguan people are united
against the Contras. They
haven't been able to hold a
single village for more than 24
hours," she said.
Baxter and Godby contend
that the Reagan administra
tion supports the Contras be
cause it feels threatened by
the Sandinista reform suc
cesses.
"They are afraid of quasi
socialism in their own back
yard," Baxter added.
"After witnessing Nicaragua
for ourselves," he said, "we ab
hor the fact that the U.S. gov
ernment continues to support
the Contras and are outraged
that more effort isn't made to
work with the Sandinistas. We
saw the way Nicaragua has been
united. The United States is
violating international law by
trying to undermine the Sandi
nistas in Nicaragua."
