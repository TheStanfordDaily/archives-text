# Renovations may take a decade
## Tresidder officials seek financing 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
The expiration of Wells Fargo
Bank's lease in Tresidder Union
this summer may trigger a series
of structural changes within the
Szczesiul, assistant director ot the
union board.
Wells Fargo is currently
negotiating with the board in
hopes of consolidating the bank's
operations. If an accord is
reached, the bank's consolidation
would be the first step in a long
range development plan for the
building, Szczesiul said.
A feasibility study completed in
October of last year divides the
building into five clusters. Each
cluster can be developed indepen
dently.
The individual clusters will also
be financed through separate
means. Wells Fargo is part of
Cluster D, which is comprised of
the personal services at Tresidder
— the hair salon, travel service,
bank and ticket office.
The board will be looking at
restructuring the current space in
Cluster D to fulfill the bank's
needs without involving major
financial commitment in the near
future. Should that attempt fail,
a portion of the funding for the
changes is expected to be picked
up by the tenants involved.
Long-range plans begin with
Cluster C. which includes both
The Coffee House and The Store.
The proposals call for The Coffee
House to be moved into the
bowling alley's space and for The
Store to replace The Coffee
House. The remodeling of the
areas involved is expected to begin
in the summmer of 1 and to be
completed that fall.
The board is looking at an ag
gressive financial package tor this
cluster, tabulated to cost $2 to $3
million. The financial package will
be composed ot heavy borrowing,
either from the University or on
the open market. With its retail
space. Cluster C otters the most
financial options to the board.
Remodeling plans tor Cluster B
include a remodeled lobby
enclosure, information booth and

office space. This will facilitate
more service-oriented lounge
space and possibly include the ad
dition of a fireplace. Another
feature could be the enclosure of
the circular stairwell with a glass
pearance while adding more
enclosed space.
"This cluster does not lend it
self to easy financing" because
there will be no direct dollar
return on the investment, so the
board is looking at alternative
financing, according to Szczesiul.
Some of the office area and fur
nishings expenses may be picked
up by reserve money from the
Tresidder Fund. The fund is a
result of careful saving specifi
cally for the development plans,
and could pick up whatever costs
can't be financed through borrow
ing or tenant financing.
A second area that the fund
will partially support is Cluster A,
the areas outside the building.
Some of the landscaping for this
cluster has already begun, but it
will not be completed until the
entire project is done. A sum of
$50,000 has been set aside for this
cluster from the fund, half of
which has already been used.
The final cluster, to be com
pleted last, is the building addi
tion. Designated as Cluster E, the
addition will be built on the back
patio and will include student
offices and meeting rooms. The
Board hopes that a portion of the
financing for this cluster will
come from donations, as hap
pened when Tresidder was built 22
years ago. Financing for the stu
dent offices can only come
through a one-time ASSU fee as
sessment.
If it occurs, the assessment
would not be levied for at least
five years, Szczesiul said.
The first hurdle the board must
clear in its long-range develop
ment plans is the immediate
structural changes to accommo
date Wells Fargo Bank. Once this
step is resolved the remaining
changes, including the addition,
may take ten years to complete.
