A technical institute near Bologna, a
northern Italian city, is offering sex educa
tion courses from one of the most in
formed persons in the field — a prostitute,
The Michigan Daily reports.
"It is a correct initiative from both the
scientific and cultural points of view," ex
plained Prof. Paolo De Donato, principal
of the Technical Institute of Castelmag
giore.
The use of a prostitute to teach the class
"Males and Females" will "offer an inter
esting perspective," De Donato said.
While attendance will not be mandatory
for the course, De Donato said she hopes
the lectures will be taken seriously."
She declined to say whether a lab would
he offered with the course.
It's what you make it
The Student Activities Committee at
Oregon State University has denied a
fraternity the right to sell a t-shirt which
has created a good deal of controversy in
Corvalis, the Daily Barometer reported.
The shirt bears the likenesses of OSU's
beaver and UCLA's bruin and the letters
" F-UCLA!"
No one seemed to mind the t-shirt
design until Pacific-10 officials complained
to OSU President Robert Mac Vicar, who
in turn talked with the fraternity members
behind the promotion.

"Mac Vicar didn't give us any legal
grounds as to why this shouldn't be of
fered." griped Gary Ritcher, a member of
the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. "An 'F
by itself does not stand for a single word."
"What is 'fucla?' " fraternity member
Tom Richman asked. "It doesn't say any
thing dirty. You can insinuate it if you
want to."
Uh-huh.
Party with the police
Usually, bad music and a shortage of cold
beer is enough to break up a college party.
At USC, it takes a lot more.
University security, 15 Los Angeles
police officers and a helicopter were called
in on a recent Friday night to disperse a
crowd of "unruly" students at an all-Row
party, USOs Daily Trojan reported.
I he trouble started when the house
manager ol the USC chapter of the Sigma
Chi fraternity asked a student from Or
ange Coast College to leave the bash.
Police were called in to remove the Orange
Coast student ( we can assume that being
an Orange Coast student at USC is illegal).
But as police drove away with the offend
ing student, USC partiers threw rocks at
the patrol cars.
Los Angeles Police Department Captain
Stan McGarry said he expects better be
havior from USC students.
"We as police officers have to respond

when called and not be met with a barrage
of missiles." he said. "When we have ma
ture young adults and young students in an
august body of learning. I just think it's
out of character for them to behave that
way. We're not out there playing games."
A cold day in ... Penn
It would never happen here.
A blizzard forced the University of
Pennsylvania to close its doors for a day
early last month. The Daily Pennsylvania!!
reported.
The closing was onlv the fifth such oc
currence in the University's history.
Students planning to buy their
textbooks at the University bookstore
were hardest hit by the closure, which
occured during the first week of the semes
ter.
"I wanted to buy mv books because I
wanted to study tonight." complained
sophomore Tom Millon. "And 1 would have
gone to the library and worked, but now I
can't."
"I'm going to cry because I can't get my
books," freshman Elizabeth Roberts
whined. "I was really looking forward to
studying tonight."
Right.
Just (old) desserts
It would never happen here, part 2. Or
would it?
University of Kansas students were en
joying — as much as anyone enjoys
cafeteria food — their Thursday night din
ners a couple of weeks ago when somebody
noticed the expiration date on the lime
sherbet he was eating had passed months
ago.
Students started dumping the sherbet en
masse when they found expiration dates
more than a year old on their desserts.
Food service workers found 18 containers
of nearly antique sherbet in the freezers
and quickly tossed them out, even though
their boss maintained that there "really
isn't anything wrong" with the dated
desserts.
A big change at Cal
Here's a switch.
The Daily Californian reports a new sur
vey reveals that the average UC-Berkeley
freshman is a white apolitical male.
The average Berkeley frosh earned a 3.6
high school grade point average, intends to

pursue engineering as a career and is
middle-of-the-road" politically, the sur
vey showed.
I he tirst-year students selected Cal
overwhelmingly because of its "good aca
demic reputation. Other reasons cited
were that "graduates go to top graduate
schools and "graduates get good jobs."
Only nine percent of the entering stu
dents said they were "likely to participate
in student protests" while at Berkeley.
Just 30 percent of the students respond
ing to the survey said that marijuana
should be legalized, compared to a 65 per
cent figure ten years ago.
On specific political issues, the Cal frosh
came down on the conservative side.
Majorities agreed that criminals have too
many rights, that the government should
not give preferential treatment to the dis
advantaged. that busing to achieve racial
integration is a mistake and that the
United States should maintain or increase
present levels of defense spending.
Yes, indeed, the times they are a chan
gin'.
An evangelist attack
Every once in a while he appears. The
strange man in White Plaza who chases stu
dents down to preach his morals and
criticize theirs.
Stanford isn't alone in this phenomenon.
The San Jose Spartan Daily reported
that a confrontation broke out between a
bible-thumping evangelist and students in
front of San Jose State's student union.
"Look at that girl," the evangelist, who
identified himself as Brother Coplin, said,
"She has jeans on. That doesn't look good."
Coplin then turned to another female stu
dent and said, "Look at this girl, she looks
nice, she has a nice long skirt." The evan
gelist abruptly turned back to the first girl
and said, "Look at this girl, she looks like a
boy."
Coplin's last remark drew anger from the
woman's male companion, who charged
toward the evangelist. But Coplin was able
to fend off the punches and kept preach
ing.
"You, young ladies, better judge well,"
Coplin shouted. "These horny little devils
will do anything to get into your pants."
One student screamed back, "Who are
you to judge?"
Coplin answered that God loves judges.
"He hates sinners and wrongdoers."
By this time, the original crowd of 50
had grown to about 150. After one stu
dent accused Coplin of fascism, the evan
gelist asked the student if he was a
socialist. When the student answered af

firmatively, Coplin said it the student was
a socialist, then he was a fascist as well.
"Hitler was a socialist and he was a tas
eist." Coplin explained.
Finally, a vendor entered the argument.
"Who are you to judge?" the vendor asked.
"Are you perfect?"
Coplin assured the vendor that he was
indeed perfect and a "moral creature.'
"You're not perfect with that tie on,
the vendor replied. The crowd laughed as
the vendor walked away.
"You're just a long-haired hippie,
burned-out from the '605." Coplin shouted
at the vendor's hack.
And from the hack of the crowd, some
one yelled. "God had long hair."
A bunch of sour grapes
The Daily Princetonian. that bastion of
pseudo-serious Ivy League journalism,
reports that "even a Californian admits
that Princeton is a better university than
Stanford."
A study undertaken by Jack Gourman, a
political science professor at Cal State
Northridge, ranked Princeton first in the
country for undergraduate education.
The ranking came on the heels of a U.S.
News and World Report survey of college
presidents which ranked Stanford first and
Princeton fourth.
Princeton administrators, however, are
wary of the reliability of the latest survey,
which has ranked Princeton first in each of
its five reports since 1967. "We have no
idea how he arrived at these conclusions,"
Princeton's vice-president for public af
fairs said. "We just don't know how
reliable they are."
A perfect match?
Housing office staffers at Northwestern
University have a little fun when they
match roommates.
Without much information on
prospective roomies, the housing office
staffers have decided to let their senses of
humor take over.
The housing office recently filled a quad
with four "Johns," put students with the
last names "Frankenstein" and "Munster"
on the same floor, and musically matched
roommates named John Lennon and Van
Morrison.
"It breaks up the monotony of matching
2000 people," one staffer explained. "And
I think it works out OK."
