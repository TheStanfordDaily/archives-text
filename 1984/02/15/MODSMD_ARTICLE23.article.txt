## Stanford meets Gauchos next Card diamondmen beat UOP 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
The Stanford diamondmen
have been playing exciting
baseball lately — probably
more exciting than Coach Mark
Marquess would like.
The Cardinal defeated Uni
versity of the Pacific 7-5 yes
terday, and the victory marked
the third of Stanford's last
four games which have been
decided by two runs or less.
As was the case against San
Jose State Saturday and Santa
Clara Sunday, Stanford and its
opponent battled until the
game's end before the winning
team emerged breathing sighs
of relief.
Junior reliever Jeff Ballard
locked up the win for the Car
dinal (S-5). Ballard pitched the
final three innings, getting five
strikeouts and squelching two
UOP rallies.
The first Tiger threat was in
the seventh inning. Freshman
righthander Rob Wassenaar,

who had relieved starter Seth
Bland in the sixth inning, gave
up two walks and a bloop single
to load the bases, threatening
Stanford's 7-4 lead.
Marquess called Ballard in,
and the Billings, Mont., prod
uct escaped the inning with
minimal damage. One UOP run
scored on a sacrifice fly, but
Ballard, effectively using a
sharp-breaking curveball which
set up an exploding fastball,
got two strikeouts to end the
inning.
"I was using mostly a curve
and a fastball," said Ballard,
whose arsenal includes a change
up and a slider. Ballard, who
leads the Cardinal pitchers in
strikeouts, gave up four
singles. UOP out-hit Stanford,
9-6.

out situation in the eighth and
got a groundout and a
strikeout to escape. The Tigers
kept the pressure on in the

ninth, thanks mainly to an er
ror by leftfielder Mike
Deßenon, who entered the
game in the eighth inning.
Pete Pappas led off the
UOP ninth with a line drive
which Deßenon dropped.
After a strikeout, Bruce An
derson singled Pappas to
second, and Vincent Brigman
then loaded the bases with a
bloop single to right. But Bal
lard threw his fifth strikeout
and got Hobie Schultz to
groundout to end the game.
"That's my job," Ballard said
of his late-inning short relief
role. "It was my job last year
and it will be unless I prove
otherwise."
Ballard had a game to save in
the first place because the Car
dinal bats erupted for three
runs in the third and fourth in
nings. r + Sf*'
Shortstop John Verducci
started the third with a double
and Mark Machtolf's single

moved Verducci to third base.
A walk to John Ramos loaded
the bases, and a sacrifice tly by
Pete Stanicek brought Ver
ducci home and tied the score
at 1-1.
Singles by Ruben Amaro Jr.
and Mark Davis scored Mach
tolf and Ramos before Rick
Lundblade grounded into a
double play, ending the inning.
Amaro, a freshman, is hitting
.500, primarily from the desig
nated hitter spot.
Contrary to the third inning,
Stanford's runs came all at
once in the fourth. Verducci,
Machtolf and Ramos, the last
three hitters in the lineup,
drew walks to load the base.
Stanicek plated the runs with a
long triple to left center.
Marquess was pleased with
Stanicek's clutch hitting,
something the Cardinal has
received little of this season.
"We're hitting the ball bet
ter," Marquess said. "Stanicek
hit the ball well (and) it was
nice to get the big hit."
Another key for the Car
dinal was its defense. The
Tigers hit the ball hard, but
Stanford blocked, stopped and
caught the ball, not always
looking spectacular. Verducci
and Davis, though, provided
the sparkle.
With a runner on third and
two out in the first inning,
Brigman hit a deep shot to cen
ter which Davis caught against
the wall after making a long
run. In the sixth, Verducci
ended the inning with a diving
stop of a hard shot up the
middle which could have put
Tigers on first and third.
Stanford starter Seth Bland
(1-0) was hit hard in the first
inning and UOP took a 1-0
lead, but Bland gave up only a
walk through the fourth. He
barely survived the fifth, sur
rendering a walk, two singles, a
double and three runs.
"It was an average outing for
him," said Marquess, who indi
cated that Bland was scheduled
to pitch "as far as he could go."
The Cardinal entertains UC-
Santa Barbara in a three-game
series Friday and Saturday. The
Gaifchos were ranked 13th na
tionully in a preseason pull.
Friday's game begins at 2:30
p.m. and the doubleheader Sat
urday starts at noon.

to load the bases, threatening
Stanford's 7-4 lead.
Marquess called Ballard in,
and the Billings, Mont., prod
uct escaped the inning with
minimal damage. One UOP run
scored on a sacrifice fly, but
Ballard, effectively using a
sharp-breaking curveball which
set up an exploding fastball,
got two strikeouts to end the
inning.
"I was using mostly a curve
and a fastball," said Ballard,
whose arsenal includes a change
up and a slider. Ballard, who
leads the Cardinal pitchers in
strikeouts, gave up four
singles. UOP out-hit Stanford,

strikeout to escape. The Tigers
kept the pressure on in the

ninth, thanks mainly to an er
ror by leftfielder Mike
Deßenon, who entered the
game in the eighth inning.
Pete Pappas led off the
UOP ninth with a line drive
which Deßenon dropped.
After a strikeout, Bruce An
derson singled Pappas to
second, and Vincent Brigman
then loaded the bases with a
bloop single to right. But Bal

"That's my job," Ballard said
of his late-inning short relief
role. "It was my job last year
and it will be unless I prove
otherwise."
Ballard had a game to save in
the first place because the Car

runs in the third and fourth in

Shortstop John Verducci
started the third with a double
and Mark Machtolf's single

moved Verducci to third base.
A walk to John Ramos loaded
the bases, and a sacrifice tly by
Pete Stanicek brought Ver
ducci home and tied the score
at 1-1.
Singles by Ruben Amaro Jr.
and Mark Davis scored Mach
tolf and Ramos before Rick
Lundblade grounded into a
double play, ending the inning.
Amaro, a freshman, is hitting
.500, primarily from the desig
nated hitter spot.
Contrary to the third inning,
Stanford's runs came all at
once in the fourth. Verducci,
Machtolf and Ramos, the last
three hitters in the lineup,
drew walks to load the base.
Stanicek plated the runs with a
long triple to left center.
Marquess was pleased with
Stanicek's clutch hitting,
something the Cardinal has
received little of this season.
"We're hitting the ball bet
ter," Marquess said. "Stanicek
hit the ball well (and) it was
nice to get the big hit."
Another key for the Car
dinal was its defense. The
Tigers hit the ball hard, but
Stanford blocked, stopped and
caught the ball, not always
looking spectacular. Verducci
and Davis, though, provided
the sparkle.
With a runner on third and
two out in the first inning,
Brigman hit a deep shot to cen
ter which Davis caught against
the wall after making a long
run. In the sixth, Verducci
ended the inning with a diving
stop of a hard shot up the
middle which could have put
Tigers on first and third.
Stanford starter Seth Bland
(1-0) was hit hard in the first
inning and UOP took a 1-0
lead, but Bland gave up only a
walk through the fourth. He
barely survived the fifth, sur
rendering a walk, two singles, a
double and three runs.
"It was an average outing for
him," said Marquess, who indi
cated that Bland was scheduled
to pitch "as far as he could go."
The Cardinal entertains UC-
Santa Barbara in a three-game
series Friday and Saturday. The
Gaifchos were ranked 13th na
tionully in a preseason pull.
Friday's game begins at 2:30
