# Men smash Georgia Tech
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
The men's tennis team didn't spare many
hearts on Valentine's Day, as it broke visiting
Georgia Tech 8-1. It looked like it was going
to be a "love" match, but Georgia Tech
sneaked in a win in the third doubles contest.
Stanford's underclassmen lineup sealed the
win in less than two hours, after five of the
six singles matches finished in straight sets.
"In a match like this. 1 just hope my guys
won't get careless," said Coach Dick Gould.
"I like to see them play solid tennis but get
off the courts quickly," Gould added.
No. 1 singles man Dan Goldie played a
sharp game, shaving only 50 minutes off the
clock to cut apart Georgia Tech's Uli Wilms
6-3, 6-0. Although Goldie played at the No. 3
spot for most of last year, he has stepped up
his game, moved up the ladder and lived up to
his coach's expectations.
"Frankly, I'm very impressed with Danny,"
said Gould. "He's had four or five really solid
wins." Three of those victories were against
players ranked in the nation's top 10, said
Gould.
At the second singles spot, lanky 6-foot-3
Jim Grabb took Georgia's Rubin Cruz for a 6-
3, 6-2 ride. Third singles Eric Rosenfeld held
tight for a 6-4, 6-4 win over Richey Gilbert.
Rosenfeld lost his serve in the second set and
trailed 2-4. However, he quickly retaliated,
breaking Gilbert in the seventh and ninth
games.
No. 4 John Letts defeated Dave Treadway
7-5, 6-0. Following a sluggish start. Letts
found himself behind 4-5 in the opening set.
Then the speedy Californian shifted into high
gear and won the next nine games.
Freshman Card Derrick Rostagno bounced

back from a one-set deficit to edge John
Mahorney 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 in the fifth singles
position. After the match, Gould said that
Rostagno was not playing up to his ability.
"Derrick has tremendous talent, but he has
to see what college tennis is like and settle
into it," commented Gould. Rostagno en
tered Stanford in September following a
nine-month stint on (he professional circuit.
Geordie McK.ee, substituting for Mark
McKeen at the No. 6 spot, ripped Stan
Carpenter 6-1, 6-2 to finish the Card's singles
sweep.
In doubles competition, Grabb and Letts
downed Wilms and Gilbert 7-6, 6-4. Accor
ding to Gould's forecast, the Grabb/Letts
duo "is looking like a good doubles team that
can beat anybody." Wilms and Gilbert
recently upset UCLA's top doubles team.
Georgia Tech Coach Gery Groslimond ad
mitted that he felt a little uneasy about
playing against Gould's group at Stanford.
Eleven years ago, Groslimond was playing for
Gould on the Farm during the reign of
Roscoe Tanner.
Although Groslimond's team was badly
defeated on his alma mater's courts, he was
not too disappointed with its showing. "We
are a very young team," Groslimond ex
plained. "I thought we played pretty com
petitively today. You have to consider we
haven't been able to play much on our six-day
road trip," he added. Due to the recent rain,
Groslimond's team has completed in only one
of its four scheduled California matches.
Stanford will be back in action Friday when
it hosts Canada College at 1:30 p.m.
