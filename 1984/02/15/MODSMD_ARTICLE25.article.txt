# Frustrated injured athletes want to get up and play
## 
### KEITH KAPLAN 
For many, playing on a major
sports team is a dream come
true; a disabling injury,
however, is often a nightmare.
Most varsity sports require
year-round dedication and
practice, and athletes may plan
their lives around their sport.
An injury can thus drastically
change that life.
Along with the end of their
season comes an end to all the
pleasure that playing the sport
brings, as well as to the hope of
heroic moments and individual
records.
An injury to anyone is pain
ful, but to an athlete it can be
even more so. It is both a men
tal and physical dilemma. The
athlete must patiently wait
tor the injury to heal before
any personal improvement can
be achieved.
Sophomore I.ibby Kinchaid, a
member of the women's swim
team, is an injured athlete
here on the Farm. Kinchaid has
an impressive list of swimming
accomplishments — she was a
member of the I9NO Olympic
team and is a national
recordholder in the 100 and
200 backstroke.
But since 19S1 she has been
plagued by a nagging shoulder
injury. This autumn, she had a
ligament removed from the
shoulder in hopes of restoring
it to its original strength. Al
though she has continued
swimming with the team, she
feels that she is not swimming

anywhere near her potential.
Kinchaid also said that al
though there is physical pain,
the mental anguish is more an
noying. "It's frustrating to
work out by yourself when the
rest of the team is going
through its daily routine." she
said.
The sophomore is also both
ered by the care that she has
received from the numerous
doctors that she has seen. " It's
upsetting when they treat you
like an object, rather than like
a person."
There are two important
reasons according to Kinchaid.
why she has endured the pain
and not given up swimming.
One is simply that she still has
a love for the sport. She is not
just swimming to gain recogni
tion. hut rather for the enjoy
ment she derives from the
activity.
The other reason is the con
stant encouragement that she
receives from her fellow swim
mers and Coach George Haines.
" George and everyone have
been great to me." she said.
Not only does Kinchaid at
tend regular practice, she fre
quently visits the training
room to work on her shoulder.
It is her hope that soon she can
participate in the sport that
she loves, to the best of her
ability, and free of pain.
Freshman Lance Shebelet is
another injured athlete here.
As a first basemen on the
baseball team, he was an out

standing prospect and played
- well during the autumn season.
However, a ski mishap over
winter break, in which he tore a
) ligament in his knee, put him
out of action.
> Shebelet's doctor said that
: skiing did not cause his injury;
it |ust triggered it. The
baseball player is expected to
be sidelined anywhere from six
- months to a year. During this
< time, the baseball team will
i have to do without a strong
1 hitter they were counting on.
Shebelet also expressed
t frustration at his injury. "It's
hard to watch the team play
while you have to sit on the
bench," he said. "I'd rather be
on the team and not playing
than not be able to play," he
added.
He also said that he is get
ting bored not playing baseball.
He hopes to be back in form in
time for next year's season.
Until that time, however, he
can only sit and watch.
Senior Doug Villeret, a
sprinter on the track team
here, tore a muscle in his foot
last week during a meet. Since
then, he's been in the training
room every day, trying various
remedies to help heal his injury.
Villeret doesn't think it is
likely that he can return for
the remainder of the indoor
season. He hopes to be able to
rejoin the team for its outdoor
season beginning next month.

like the other injured ath
letes. ViHeret expressed some
anger and frustration about
not being able to practice his
specialty — something he was
accustomed to doing ever)' day.
Villeret is especially upset he
cause he was excited about
some of the changes in the
track program, and felt that he
may have a good season.
this year, Villeret's last at
Stanford, the track team hired
a new sprint coach. Remi Kor
chemny. Korchemny brought
with him a new philosophy on
running, one that Villeret has
been putting to use rather suc
cessful ly.
"I really feel like I was im
proving with this new
method." said Villeret. Unfor
tunately, his injury has shor
tened his season and limited his
chances for improvement.
Nevertheless, Villeret is still
looking forward to putting his
best foot forward — as soon as
it recovers.
Although Kinchaid, Shebelat
and Villeret participate in dif
ferent sports, they are all in
the same boat. All three must
overcome frustrating injuries
before returning to their
respective teams. They must
also spend extra time in the
training room rehabilitating
their injuries, until they return
to their original strength. Un
til that time, however, they
must live with their disap
pointment and think of the
things that might have been.

Senior Doug Villeret injured himself in a track meet just last week. Villeret hopes that his
foot will race to a recovery so he can sprint for the Cardinal later this year.
For many, playing on a major
sports team is a dream come
true; a disabling injury,
however, is often a nightmare.
Most varsity sports require
year-round dedication and
practice, and athletes may plan
their lives around their sport.
An injury can thus drastically
change that life.
Along with the end of their
season comes an end to all the
pleasure that playing the sport
brings, as well as to the hope of
heroic moments and individual
records.
An injury to anyone is pain
ful, but to an athlete it can be
even more so. It is both a men
tal and physical dilemma. The
athlete must patiently wait
tor the injury to heal before
any personal improvement can
be achieved.
Sophomore I.ibby Kinchaid, a
member of the women's swim
team, is an injured athlete
here on the Farm. Kinchaid has
an impressive list of swimming
accomplishments — she was a
member of the I9NO Olympic
team and is a national
recordholder in the 100 and
200 backstroke.
But since 19S1 she has been
plagued by a nagging shoulder
injury. This autumn, she had a
ligament removed from the
shoulder in hopes of restoring
it to its original strength. Al
though she has continued
swimming with the team, she
feels that she is not swimming

anywhere near her potential.
Kinchaid also said that al
though there is physical pain,
the mental anguish is more an
noying. "It's frustrating to
work out by yourself when the
rest of the team is going
through its daily routine." she
said.
The sophomore is also both
ered by the care that she has
received from the numerous
doctors that she has seen. " It's
upsetting when they treat you
like an object, rather than like
a person."
There are two important
reasons according to Kinchaid.
why she has endured the pain
and not given up swimming.
One is simply that she still has
a love for the sport. She is not
just swimming to gain recogni
tion. hut rather for the enjoy
ment she derives from the
activity.
The other reason is the con
stant encouragement that she
receives from her fellow swim
mers and Coach George Haines.
" George and everyone have
been great to me." she said.
Not only does Kinchaid at
tend regular practice, she fre
quently visits the training
room to work on her shoulder.
It is her hope that soon she can
participate in the sport that
she loves, to the best of her
ability, and free of pain.
Freshman Lance Shebelet is
another injured athlete here.
As a first basemen on the
baseball team, he was an out

standing prospect and played
- well during the autumn season.
However, a ski mishap over
winter break, in which he tore a
) ligament in his knee, put him
out of action.
