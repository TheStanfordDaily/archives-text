# Allow professionals to compete in the Olympics
## 
### 
Americans will turn their
television sets to the Olympics
tonight in the hopes of a great
medal-winning effort by one
of their countrymen. Maybe
the viewers will get their wish.
But the American people
may have lost a greater oppor
tunity before the Winter
Games even started. This op
portunity could have changed
the Games as a whole, and
probably improved them as a
result.
Prior to the beginning of the
Olympics, the Canadian hockey
team announced that it would
use some National Hockey
League (NHL.) players on its
team. The United States im
mediately became outraged
with the idea and protested
the attempt.
The Olympics are, as almost
everyone knows, an event for
amateur athletes. The
Canadians were attempting to

circumvent the eligibility rules
and use some professionals who
had played only a small number
of pro games.
Small number of games or
not, the International Olympic

On
second
/
thought
Jason Cole

Committee (IOC) would have
none of this, and the U.S.
protest was upheld. The Games
are meant for the best amateur
athletes in the world, the lOC
reiterated.
The word "amateur,"
however, has been one of the

most over-debated ones of all
time. What is an amateur ath
lete? How should that term ul
timately be defined? There are
a myriad of these questions,
none of which get to the basic
point.
The basic point is that the
term amateur should be
thrown out. The debates
should end and the Olympics
should be open to the best ath
letes in the world, regardless of
their status.
That's where the United
States made its big mistake
this year. Canada was on the
path to change, a change that
would have improved the
Games and possibly allowed the
United States to dominate in
the short run.
If the United States had
come out in favor of Canada's
attempt, the Olympics would
have been one step closer to al
lowing professional athletes to

compete. The advantages of
using professional athletes are
abundant.
First, the level of competi
tion in the Olympic sports
would be raised. Sports like
hockey and basketball are the
first to come to mind, but all
sports would improve.
Someone like Carl Lewis
could cash in on his talents
without having to give up the
chance to compete in the
Olympics. Athletes like
Renaldo Nehemiah and Willie
Gault, who are now profes
sional football players, would
no longer have to make such
difficult choices over what to
do with their lives.
The United States would, of
course, dominate sports like
basketball and baseball (still an
experimental Olympic sport),
but over time this domination
would balance out, just as it is
now.

But the important effect is
that by allowing the best ath
letes to compete, the general
nature of athletics will im
prove from the heightened
competition.
Second, throwing out the
amateur standard would end
the long list of debates over
what constitutes an amateur
athlete. Most of these debates
concern countries which give
their athletes preferential
treatment.
Other countries maintain
that such treatment is equal to
professionalism. So what? The
point of the Olympics should
be to have athletes who can
perform to the best of their
abilities and government sup
port may be the only way to
achieve that.
But, of course, the United
States didn't quite see the
issue that way when it
protested Canada's attempt

to use NHL players. Unfortun
ately, it was a knee-jerk reac
tion rather than a logical
calculation of the benefits.
The way the Olympic hockey
matches were scheduled, the
United States was supposed to
face Canada in the first round.
Since Canada is one of the top
teams in the world without the

professionals, the Unite
States didn't want to allow
any more advantage than
already had.
It's unfortunate that tl
United States could not st
beyond its own circumstance
The Olympics should be a plai
for the best, not ju
amateurs.
