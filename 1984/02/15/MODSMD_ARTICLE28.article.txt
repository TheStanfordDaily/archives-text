# Hamilton nears gold; Swiss wins slalom

### 
Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (AP) — U.S.
figure skater Scott Hamilton added
a second place in short forms yester
day to his earlier top scores, putting
him in prime contention for a Win
ter Olympics gold medal.
Canadian Brian Orser bested him
by a narrow margin in the short
forms, but Hamilton still held onto
first place overall.
Hours after Hamilton left the ice
in his short program, the rink
belonged to the ice dancing event,
where Britain's Jayne Torvill and
Christopher Dean appeared headed
for the gold after reaping perfection
in their preliminaries.
After the short program, which
accounts for 20 percent of the final
marks in the medal competition,
Hamilton led Jean-Christophe
Simond of France, followed by West
German Rudi Cerne.
Hamilton finished second in the
short program after leading in the
compulsory round. Orser moved into
fifth place overall after his short

program.
Brian Boitano, 19, of Sunnyvale,
Calif., finished third in the short
program and moved into sixth place
overall. The other U.S. entry, Mark
Cockerell of Los Angeles, was 17th
overall.
Hamilton, 25, skated cautiously in
completing the short program's re
quired jumps, but was off on a camel
spin and didn't have his usual spark.
His coach, Don Laws, said Hamil
ton would have to finish fifth or
lower in the free skate Thursday
night to lose the gold medal.
Torvill and Dean, whose interpre
tation of Ravel's "Bolero" won 11
perfect 6.0 scores of a possible 18
marks at the recent European Figure
Skating Championships, were ex
pected to win Britain's first gold
medal at the XIV Olympic Winter
Games tonight at Zetra Arena. The
only remaining question is whether
their scores will be perfect.
Americans Judy Blumberg and Mi
chael Seibert, third entering the

final event, could give the United
States its second figure skating
medal if the nine-judge panel likes
their exotic dance to
"Scheherezade." Kitty and Peter
Carruthers of Wilmington, Del., won
the silver in pairs Sunday.
In second place is a Soviet couple,
Natalia Bestemianova and Andrei
Bukin.
The two other U.S. ice-dancing
teams, Carol Fox and Richard Dalley
and Elisa Spitz and Scott Gregory,
were sixth and 10th, respectively.

Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (AP) — Swit
zerland's Max Julen, often a runner
up in World Cup races, held off
crowd favorite Jure Franko of
Yugoslavia to win the gold medal
yesterday in the men's giant slalom
at the XIV Olympic Winter Games.
Julen, 22, prevailed on a treach
erous course that claimed two of
the favorites on the first run.
Franko settled for the silver medal
— the first medal ever won by

Yugoslavia in Winter Olympics —
and Andreas Wenzel of Liech
tenstein took the bronze.
Phil Mahre of Yakima, Wash., the
three-time World Cup overall cham
pion who has struggled all season,
wound up eighth. His brother Steve
was 17th. Tiger Shaw of Stowe, Vt.,
the other American in the competi
tion, fell early in his first run.
The giant slalom was marked by
the absence of two of the event's
strongest competitors, Sweden's In
gemar Stenmark and Luxembourg's
Marc Girardelli. Stenmark has been
barred from competing because he
accepted endorsement money di
rectly, and Girardelli, an Austrian,
doesn't have citizenship in Luxem
bourg.
Of his victory, Julen said, "I can't
believe it. It will take time to get
used to it."
The giant slalom was held over a
Mount Bjelasnica course of roughly
1,222 yards with a vertical drop of
roughly 417 yards over the course.
