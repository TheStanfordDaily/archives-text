# Medical Center to test interferon

### LYNN MARCUS 
I he Medical Center announced
plans yesterday to study possible
cancer-retarding applications for in
terferon. the drug once hailed as a
"miracle cure" for ailments ranging
from cancer to the common cold.
"We're hoping that using inter
feron after chemotherapy will main
tain remissions (in cancer patients)
lor longer periods of time," accor
ding to Medical School Asst. Prof.
Sandra Horning.
The study, to be headed by Hor
ning, will involve patients afflicted
with a type of lymph cancer that ac
counts for an estimated 1 (),()()() new
cancer cases in the United States
each year.

Interferon, a protein produced
both in the body and in the labora
tory, received considerable public at
tention in the late 1 7()s after
studies began to test its efficacy in
treating cancer, hepatitis and certain
infectious diseases. Time magazine
featured the drug in a cover story in
the spring of 1
"Unfortunately, it was made out
to be a magic bullet by the press, par
ticularly by Time." Horning said, add
ing that the drug has more of an
anti-growth than a "killer" effect,
slowing growth in the tissues where
cells are div iding.
The Stanford stud\ will probe in
terferon's role as a "watchdog" in
the body's immune s\stem, testing

the drug's ability to zero in on and
halt growth in small pockets of can
cer cells at an early stage of relapse.
Horning said.
The form of lymph cancer to be in
volved in the study, low-grade
Hodgkin's lymphoma, can be initially
controlled but not cured by conven
tional chemotherapy in 75 to SO per
cent of patients, according to
Horning.
She added that about one-half of
these patients experience a relapse
within three to four years after
chemotherapy. Traditional anti
cancer drugs are more effective than
interferon in treating lymphoma, but
they kill non-cancerous cells as well as
malignant ones and are thus consid-

ered too potent for long-term use.
Horning emphasized that the
study will test interferon's ability to
slow the cancer process, not to stop
it. "Any impact on long-term sur
\i\al and cure is very speculative."
she said.
I he study, expected to last several
years, will involve about 50 new
patients per year. Half the patients
will be chosen at random to receive
daily injections of interferon follow
ing chemotherapy. These patients
will t;ike the drug tor one month,
receive no interferon for three
months, and then repeat this on-off
cycle three times. Control patients
will undergo chemotherapy but will
not take interferon.
