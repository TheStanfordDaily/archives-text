# Board hikes tuition, backs Quad plan
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR Daily staff 
In the wake of yesterday's Board of Trustees
meeting, students will face a 7.5 percent tuition
hike this fall, coupled with a room and board rate
increase of 8.75 percent.
In light of the increases. University officials
emphasized that the "need-blind" admissions
policy will be continued, meeting the financial
needs of all those admitted to the Universtiy
through a combination of scholarships, jobs and
loans. More than 60 percent of those admitted
need financial aid, according to Associate Direc
>«.r w»«_im v;»..11
The increase from $9027 to $9705 is substan
tial, but still just below the forecasted increase
of 8 percent and far below the 10 and 15 percent
increases of recent years.
In the professional schools, the increases were
slightly larger: Medicine is up 8.5 percent, to
$11,424; Law up 9 percent to $10,006; and Busi
ness up 9.6 percent to $ 10,056.
In the past decade, Stanford's tuition in
creases have been more than the national average

of personal disposable income, the money people
have left over after meeting their living ex
penses. This became an area of concern to admi
nistrators setting next year's tuition figure.
"What we hope to accomplish with this
increase is to narrow the gap between tuition and
personal disposable income," said Associate
Provost Timothy Warner of the moderate in
crease. "But the issue of personal disposable
income is not the driving force. There is no
driving force. There are many factors."
Warner said that in addition to the income
issue, the University takes quality maintenance,
/'u»ic/« /or fjcw project?* unci financial aid into aC
count when determining the tuition rate.
It is the inflation rate, utility bills and salaries
which keep pushing up the price tag here, accor
ding to administrators. The debt financing of the
Governor's Corner housing project is the major
reason for the increase of the room and board
rate to $4146.
"We've worked very hard to hold down tuition
or at least keep it half a point below the recom
mended increase. And we've accomplished that,"

said Provost Albert Hastorf. "But we're a labor
intensive, high-technology organization. There's
no way you're going to make those facts go
away."
Vice Provost Raymond Bachetti, director of
University budgets, said, "It's a fact of
budgetary life — our costs are higher than infla
tion."
Salaries are the biggest factor in the tuition
equation. Last year, two-thirds of the Univer
sity's operating budget went to cover faculty and
staff salaries, and the size of this group has been
increasing at the rate of 1 percent a year.
'Thus the rate of tuition increases tends to fol
low the upward curve of inflation plus productiv
ity, a real increase of 2 percent, according to
Bachetti.
Of the outlook for the next five years, Bac
hetl, said, "J wouldn't be surprised to see tuition
bouncing anywhere between 6 and 8 percent a
year, if inflation stays at 5 percent."
In a tuition-rate comparison with 1U compar-
able institutions. Stanford ranked
sixth behind Harvard, MIT. Prince
ton, Dartmouth and Yale.
In other action, the Board ap
proved the new Quad renovation
plan designed by Landscape Archi
tect Anthony Guzzardo. The final
approval of a previous plan was

delayed and finally modified due to
protest from University groups, es
pecially faculty and students in the
Art History Department.
The newly proposed plan retains
eight circular planters set in a rectan
gular field of decorative pavement.
The existing concrete paths will be
eliminated. Other improvements will
include repair of four memorial
drinking fountains, the reconstruc
tion of the central rosette pavement
ornament and new floodlights.

The $1 million project, funded en
tirely by gifts, is scheduled to be
completed by mid-October.
The 1983 Annual Financial Report
which was presented to the trustees
characterized the University's finan
cial position as strong.
The endowment, for 1983 ap
proached the $1 billion mark. Only
Harvard, the University of Texas,
Princeton and Yale rival that figure,
according to William Massy, vice
president for business and finance.
