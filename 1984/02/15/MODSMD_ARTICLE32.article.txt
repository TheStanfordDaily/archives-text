greater than for the deadest

my love is deep wherever we go.

This verse will show that I'm no
bard,
butl'm crazy for one love
Card.
*
She's sweet, she's cute, she's fun,
she's bright;
her only known fault is a lack
of height.
*
She caught my glance while
backwards skating;
for three long months my
heart was waiting.
*
But she's so special she was
worth the wait;
the times we've had have been
more than great.
*
This poem must end, for the cost
is mounting
(did I mention yet that she's a
whiz at accounting?).
*
Let's just say she's made lots of
things magic - even 29;
if you see her, tell her a thank
ful fan said
"Valentine, be mine"
