2)Should the Lobby Office advocate a position
in favor of having local planning commissions ad
dress the shortage of low and moderate cost
housing in the Stanford area?
The questions were intended to clarify the
purpose of the Lobby Office and to give it clout
in its lobbying efforts.

The Senate defeated a bill to publish ASSU

student group. However, the senators decided
that their function as elected officials did not
entitle them to tell students for whom they
should vote and that Senate recommendations
were too difficult to agree on and too inef
fective to be worthwhile.
Proposed, but only discussed at the meeting,
was the institution of a bus service to run be
tween Stanford and San Francisco. The intent of
the service, labelled the ASSU Culture Connec
tion. would be to provide cultural opportunities
