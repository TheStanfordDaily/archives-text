Gemayel set to act on treaty
Beirut, Lebanon — President Amin Gemayel held a three
hour meeting with former President Suleiman Franjieh. a
leader of the Christian opposition, yesterday amid intense
speculation that he has reached a decision to abrogate the
1983 Lebanese-Israeli withdrawal agreement.
I lie meeting, in the village of Smar Jbail, 25 miles north
ot Beirut, was Gemayel's first with any major factional
leader since the current crisis began almost two weeks ago.
Last night, state television said the two had discussed "a
number ot practical ideas and quick solutions to save the
country." It said there had been "positive results" and that
Gemayel soon would announce a "big decision."
After returning to Beirut, Gemayel met with U.S. Am
bassador Reginald Bartholomew, presumably to inform him
ot his plans. He also met with his father. Phalangist Party
leader Pierre Gemayel, and another former Christian presi
dent. Camille Chamoun.
Late last night, an aide to Chamoun said Gemayel had
told him he would take another 24 to 48 hours before
making public his decision but had given no indication what
it might be.
Pierre Gemayel and Chamoun have been adamant that
the president should implement the accord with Israel,
which Syria and the Lebanese anti-government militias have
strongly opposed.
Five Panama ministers quit
Panama City, Panama — Five Panamanian government
ministers quit yesterday on the heels of the surprise resig
nation Monday of President Ricardo de la Espriella.
Meanwhile, opposition politicans said that the presi
dent's departure was, in essence, a coup d'etat.
De la Espriella has been out of public view since he left
office, and the government press office has declined to say
where he is. Rumors in this seaside capital have placed him
simultaneously at his home, in the United States and in
Europe. Relatives of De la Espriella said only that he is well.
Government sources said yesterday that the president
was forced out by military leaders over a dispute over
changes in the Cabinet.
I he Panama Defense Forces, formerly called the Nation
al Guard and the power behind the government, reportedly
demanded that De la Espriella fire at least four Cabinet
ministers. De la Espriella resisted, but, with his resignation,
the Cabinet's makeup is changing anyway.
The shake-up coincides with a heated campaign for a
presidential election scheduled for May 6.
Opposition politicians fear that a new Cabinet will hand
out favors and encourage public employees to support the
campaign of military-backed Nicolas Ardito Barletta, can
didate of the official Democratic Revolutionary Party in a
coalition called the National Democratic Union.
Carlos Clement, the resigned public works minister, said
yesterday afternoon that he traveled with De la Espriella
on a provincial tour over the weekend and "had no idea that
anything out of the ordinary was going to take place."
White House repudiates
Navy official on shelling
Washington — The White House, conscious of the legal
justification imposed bv Congress for using military force in
Lebanon, yesterday adamantly repudiated a statement by
Secretary of the Navy John Lehman that U.S. naval bom
bardments are aimed at helping the shattered Lebanese
government.
Presidential spokesman Larry Speakes insisted (as he had
last Thursday in Santa Barbara, after initially proclaiming
Lehman's view) that ''whatever we do" militarily in
Lebanon "is in support of the Marines and Americans" still
in Beirut.
It marked the latest in a continuing series of contradic
tions and inconsistencies by administration officials in their
attempts to publicly explain President Reagan's week-old
new policy on troop deployment and military rules of en
gagement in Lebanon.
"Look," declared Speakes. when asked by reporters whom
the public should believe, "the administration policy is set
in the Oval Office, and I'm speaking for the Oval Office
and the man in it."
At the heart of the dispute over the rationale for the
naval bombardments is the White House's effort to keep
the military in legal compliance with the compromise legis
lation authorizing deployment of U.S. forces in Lebanon.
Iraq announces cease-fire
Baghdad, Iraq — This country declared a unilateral,
seven-day cease-fire yesterday in its air and missile attacks
on Iranian cities and said it would avoid civilian targets in
the future if Iran does likewise.
The announcement, made on state radio by a spokesman
for the ministry of foreign affairs, came after a third
straight night of heavy attacks by Iraq and Iran on each
other's border towns and cities along a 300-mile front.
Military officials here said 22 Iraqis were killed and 60
wounded Monday night and yesterday morning in Iranian ar
tillery barrages on Basra. Mandali and Khanaqin. They said
Iraqi warplanes responded by hitting six towns inside Iran.
Soviet Union buries Andropov
Moscow — Once again, the mournful strains of a Chopin
dirge and the thunder of artillery salutes rolled across Red
Square yesterday as the Soviet Union buried President Yuri
Andropov in a place of honor by the Kremlin wall.
The state funeral for Andropov, who died last Thursday
at the age of 69, was the fifth for a member of the Soviet
Politburo in 38 months, as the Soviet Union moves through
a generational change in leadership at a pace seemingly set
more by nature than by politics.
Two officers bearing a black-framed portrait of the So
viet leader led the procession. They were followed by offi
cers carrying his many medals pinned to red cushions and by
still others bearing dozens of large floral wreaths from
foreign countries and government ministries, among them
the KGB security and intelligence agency that Andropov
served as chairman for 15 years.
Behind them came members of the Soviet leader's family.
They included his son Igor, a diplomat, and his daughter
Irina. an editor of a musical journal. Irina's striking fox fur
coat contrasted with the dark proletarian cloth of
Konstantin Chernenko, Andropov's successor as party
leader, and other senior Soviet officials who followed the
family.
