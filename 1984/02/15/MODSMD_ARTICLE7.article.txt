## Lebanese army suffers major defeat 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Beirut, Lebanon — The Lebanese
army, apparently routed in an 18-hour
battle with advancing rebel forces, was
forced to retreat yesterday from key
hillside positions southeast of Beirut,
suffering a major defeat that can only
further weaken the crippled govern
ment of President Amin Gemayel.
The battered army, according to
state-run Beirut radio, withdrew to the
coastal area of Khalde, where it could
be vulnerable to still more attacks.
The army said the rebels "advanced
behind direct Syrian fire" and that "the
army fought an unequal battle and
redeployed to new positions." Despite
the army's accusation of Syrian partici
pation in the fight, there was little
evidence of American military support
in response during the Lebanese army's
day-long hour of crisis.
A U.S. Marine spokesman said that
the U.S. guided-missile destroyer Rick
etts fired 1 1 rounds from its 5-inch
guns at Syrian artillery positions east of
Beirut at the request of the Lebanese
army. That request came early in the

battle, and there was no further
response from American warships lying
just offshore.
The fighting was the heaviest since
the • "mountain war" of September.
Meanwhile, the crisis atmosphere sur
rounding the government deepened and
Gemayel traveled to northern Lebanon
to talk to aging Christian opposition
figure Sulieman Franjieh. a former pres
ident and one of the leaders of the Na
tional Salvation Front that is at odds
with the government.
A crushing blow to the army could
leave Gemayel with virtually no tan
gible support in the country. His prime
minister and Cabinet resigned 10 days
ago.
The attacking rebel forces. led by
Druse militiamen reportedly backed by
Palestinians, overran the mountain
villages, of Ein Kasour. Binnay and Ab
bey in the Shahr area, basically a
ridgeline running south of the moun
taintop town of Souk el-Gharb, still
held by the Lebanese army.
In an effort to stem the rebel tide.

the Lebanese army sent up two of its
aging. British-made Hawker Hunter jet
fighter planes, which bombed Druse
positions in the mountains at midmorn
ing and again in the afternoon.
The battle began about midnight
Monday as Hashes of artillery, clearly
visible from East Beirut, lit up the
ridgeline of the mountains.
Other than the salvo from the Rick
etts. U.S. forces were drawn into the
fight only briefly. The airport area,
near the Marines' base, was hit by
several rockets about two hours after
the fight in the hills began. And about
dawn, the Marines answered a brief
rocket and mortar attack with their
own mortars.
But it was clear that this flurry of
fire was inconsequential compared with
the pounding that the Lebanese army
was taking in the hills, and an air of
crisis prevailed at the Lebanese ministry
of defense in the hillside area of Yarze.
Several rebel artillery shells fell around
the grounds of the ministry building
during the day.

The loss of the Lebanese army in this
area is significant because it widens the
heretofore narrow gap through which
supplies and arms have moved through
Syrian- and Druse-held territory in the
mountains and into the southern sub
urbs of Beirut, which are held by the
Shia Moslem militia. Amal.
The victory gives the rebels almost
undisputed control of southern routes
into the city from the Chouf Moun
tains. Only the coastal route, now held
by elements of the pro-government
Christian Falangist militia, remains out
of rebel hands.
What is left of the Lebanese army
4th Brigade, which was reported early
Wednesday to be regrouping south of
the airport and along the coast, could
be cut off now and pinned down by
Druse artillery positioned in the hills
and by the Amal militia in the southern
suburbs just to the north. The brigade's
total strength was about 2500 men
before the fight began. It could not be
learned how many casualties it had suf
fered.
