From the Los Angeles Times
Moscow — Vice President George Bush met briefly
yesterday with Konstantin Chernenko and reported
later that the new Soviet leader agrees that U.S.-
Soviet relations should take "a more constructive
path."
Bush spent about 30 minutes with Chernenko, who
also met with leaders of Britain. France, West Ger
many, India and Eastern European countries follow
ing the funeral for President Yuri Andropov.
"I will report to the president that he agrees about
the need to place our relationship upon a more con
structive path, in the interest of peace," Bush told
reporters after the meeting, which Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromvko also attended.

Bush said he handed Chernenko a letter from Presi
dent Reagan. But he declined to say whether it con
tained any specific proposals for improving
U.S.-Soviet relations, currently at their coolest level
since the Cold War.
"It conveyed the president's determination to
move on all areas of our relationship with the Soviets,
and our readiness for concrete, productive discussions
in every one of them," Bush said in a statement to
reporters.
The meeting was the highest personal contact the
Reagan administration has had with the Soviet lead
ership since Bush met with Andropov on the day of
Leonid Brezhnev's funeral in November 1982.
Andropov's last public appearance, however, was with

a delegation of U.S. senators in August, six months
before his death.
They nevertheless recognized. Bush added, that
major disagreements separate the United States and
the Soviet Union, and he said both sides "were quite
frank about that."
There was no indication that any substantive un
derstandings were reached in the brief meeting, which
Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) and U.S. Ambassador
Arthur Hartman also attended. As translations from
Russian to English and back again usually take up half
the available time, each side would have had just over
seven minutes to convey its views.
