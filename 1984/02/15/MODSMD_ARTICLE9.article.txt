## Elephant seals get together at Ano Nuevo Beach 
### NANCY RAFF 
A few weeks ago it was Salo
— a very adult selection at the
Tuesday night flicks — and
now this. About two hours
from here, at a state beach
called Ano Nuevo Reserve, a
small stretch of coastline has
become the rendezvous point
for a bizarre orgy.
Strangely enough, there have
been no arrests. In fact, those
involved are protected by the
state forest service. But the
really weird part is this: They
are giving tours.
The cost is $3, a small price
for live entertainment, and re
quires one to walk about a mile
and a half through sand dunes
and across streams. Upon
reaching the destination point,
it's easy to understand why
this area of coastline is
protected. It serves as a
seasonal home for mating ele
phant seals — animals which
were thought to be extinct
about 100 years ago.
A trip to Ano Nuevo State
Reserve is more then a study of
the mating habits of the seals;
it is a fascinating glimpse into
the social structure of an
animal community. Scientists
there are studying the complex
social behavior of the mam
mals.
The community is dominated
by male seals. The bulls es
tablish harems, which can range
up to 200 females, but usually
contain around 40. The most
powerful bulls have the largest
harems — they must be able to
fight off all other males.
As a result, the community is
made up of a hierarchy headed
by the alpha bulls, males in
their prime of nine to 11 years.
During the mating season
the males have to fast, as they
are constantly protecting their
females. This period of fasting
can last up to 90 days, during
which the head bulls are chal
lenged by other bulls attempt
ing to mate within the harem.
Usually, the loud cry issued by
the alpha bull is enough to
frighten off the invading
weaker male, but combat does
occur.

As these animals weigh
nearly two tons, a combat chal
lenge is a powerful and
frightening sight. The males
are distinctive due to their
great bulk — three times that
of the female — and their
greatly enlarged noses. One
brave and clever younger male
attempted to sneak into a
harem by covering his very large
nose with sand and trying to
appear female. Since it is so
difficult for a 2-ton mammal
to be unobtrusive, this tech
nique is rarely successful, espe
cially under the watchful eyes
of the alpha bull.
The females give birth five
days after arriving on the
beach. The pups increase in
weight from 50 to 400 pounds
in 30 days. If the pup loses its
mother the chances for survival
are not good and it is very rare
that a female will nurse an or
phan pup even if hers has died.
This, combined with the fact
that the males will run over a
pup during a mating challenge,
make the elephant seal infancy
period a dangerous and poten
tially painful experience.
The mortality rate for the
seals is quite high. Only two
out of every 10 of these males
ever reach maturity.
These giant mammals were
thought to be extinct by 1869
— they were hunted ex
tensively for their oil — but a
small colony was discovered in
1892 on an island off the coast
of Baja California.
A trip to Ano Nuevo pro
vides a day at the beach and a
rare chance to observe these
beautiful animals that were
nearly lost a century ago.
The seals have only been
mating since 1961 at Ano
Nuevo — the only mainland
elephant seal colony in the
world.
The Ano Nuevo State
Reserve is located on Highway
1, about 15 miles north of
Santa Cruz, and can only be
visited with a guided tour. The
guides are funny, helpful and
knowledgeable. Since the tour
size is limited, advance tickets
are required.
