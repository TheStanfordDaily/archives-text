## 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
A new sculpture by artist George Segal entitled
"Gay Liberation" will be installed on campus next
week.
The white, patinated bronze sculpture consists of
two life-size couples — two men standing next to
each other near two women seated on a park bench.
The sculpture will be installed on the lawn at the
northern end of Lomita Mall, west of the Mathema
tics Department.
The work will be on indefinite loan from the owner,
the Mildred Andrews Fund, until it is approved for in
stallation in the Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco.
"Gay Liberation" reeei\ed a unanimous recommen
dation from the University's Panel on Outdoor Art
and the University Committee on Land and Building
Development. It was then approved by University
President Donald Kennedy.
"The sculpture is one of the most beautiful Segal
works I've ever seen," said Law Prof. John Merryman,
chairman of the outdoor art panel. "I think we're ex
tremely fortunate to get something of this quality."
According to Merryman, the sculpture is "very
restrained and dignified."
"It basically portrays people in a very human situa

tion and is typical of Segal." he said.
According to Art Prof. Albert Elsen. George Segal
is one of the most important sculptors of our time.
"I think the sculpture should he shown on the Stan
ford campus because of the excellence of the artist,"
Elsen said.
Elsen also stressed the importance of the theme. "I
think it is a subject which deals with social and politi
cal justice," he said.
Segal wants to portray "essences," or what makes
us human, in his figural compositions, according to
Merryman. Accordingly, he chose models who were
gay and developed a composition that, in the
sculptor's words, "stresses our common humanity."
Gerard Koskovich. a menibei of the steering com
mittee of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS), said he supports having the sculpture here.
"I think it's a splendid sculpture," Koskovich said,
"and I think Stanford is a particularly appropriate
place for display of this monument because of the
long and vital tradition of lesbian and gay activism
here."
According to Koskovich, "Gay Liberation" was
originally intended for installation in Sheridan Square


George Segal's sculpture "Gay Liberation" will be displayed near the Mathematics Department on
campus. The sculpture is on loan to the university from the Mildred Andrews Fund until it is approved
for installation in the Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco.
in New York City, the site of the 1969 Stonewall
Riots that launched the modern gay liberation move
ment.
Merrvman said it is difficult to predict the commu
nity's reaction to the sculpture. "1 very much hope
the reception on campus will he positive," 1 he said.

"hut people will make up their own minds about whe
ther they like it or not."
Koskovich said he expects "considerable public dis
cussion" about the work.
"Previous works this size or this explicit have
produced a tremendous amount of discussion," he
said, "because some people feel the University is forc
ing works of art down the throats of people who
don't necessarily want to see them."
According to Koskovich, "GI.AS will be sensitizing
people to the fact that this piece of work means
something."
