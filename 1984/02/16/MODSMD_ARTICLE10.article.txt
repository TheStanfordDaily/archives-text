From the Los Angeles Times
Moscow — Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau
said yesterday that the new Soviet Communist Party
chief, Konstantin Chernenko, appears to be inter
ested in reviving "the spirit of detente" in relations
with the West.
The prime minister told reporters after the 35-
minute conversation that the two leaders avoided
specific issues such as the breakdown of the Geneva
talks on medium-range missiles in Europe and on stra
tegic arms reductions. But he said Chernenko empha
sized a need for dialogue and detente with the West.
"There was no sense of stalemate, as if, you have

to wait. There was none of that," Trudeau said. "It
was, 'Now is the time to move, to have a dialogue, to
make progress.' "
Chernenko also met Wednesday with Cuban Presi
dent Fidel Castro and Nicaraguan leader Daniel Or
tega for conversations that indicated no change in
Soviet views on Latin American issues.
After Chernenko's meeting with Castro, Tass said
the Soviet Union restated its full support for Cuba,
which was said to "courageously oppose the aggressive
intrigues of U.S. imperialism." a standard Soviet
phrase.
Despite the upbeat reports by Trudeau and Vice

President George Bush, the extent to which Cher
nenko will actually guide Soviet foreign policy remains
unclear. Concerned with ideological questions for
most of his adult life, Chernenko has had little direct
experience in foreign affairs or domestic economic
management.
Chernenko's health and stamina may also lead him
to restrict his activities, some analysts believe.
His labored breathing, evident as he eulogized
Andropov at Tuesday's funeral, is the result of em
physema, according to former British Foreign Secre
tary David Owen, who is a physician.
