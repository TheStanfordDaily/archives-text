## Dance Week'84: a meeting of the arts and sciences 
### ROBERT BARCKLAY Daily staff 
Seeing may imply believing, hut the con
verse of this statement — believing
implies seeing — may seem enigmatic, if
not ridiculous.
According to Heinz Von Foerster, a pro
lessor from the University of Illinois,
there is more truth to the latter state
ment than one might expect. In fact, it is
important enough to be the focus of a
lecture he gave Tuesday entitled "Seeing
With the Ihird Eye" — one of a series of
lectures which are being held as part of
Dance Week'B4.
Foerster contends that "one sees only
what one is looking for" and that the mind
must be trained to see and appreciate cer
tain things. His talk centered on the
cognitive processes and how the mind and
body influence perception.
Like the other lectures that are being
held throughout the week, Foerster's talk
was conspicuously general enough to be ap
plied to other interests besides dance.
Although there are workshops planned

that deal with dance specifically, such as a
lecture today on choreography, much of
the agenda includes discussions on topics
that would be of interest to anyone who
uses his or her "body as an instrument."
The director of Dance Week'B4, Linda
Johnson, explained that the goal of this
week's series of talks and lectures is "to
provide movers of all kinds with the basic
tools to think about the body in their own
way."
The topic of the week is entitled, "How
Can We Know the Dancer from the
Dance?" and was inspired by a poem by
William Butler Yeats. The message or
ganizers hope to get across is the impor
tance of "a working knowledge of the
body and its range of dynamics in order to
realize one's potential as a performer."
Based on the premise that all dancers,
athletes or movers have, in common, their
body as a medium, Dance Week is address
ing issues of concern to all of them. Al
though she doesn't expect the football
player to shed his pads for tights, Johnson

said she hopes that those who attend the
lectures will come away with "a real sense
of the body for the sake of movement."
The group of professors who are speak
ing throughout the week are as diverse as
the group which Johnson hopes to attract.
While Foerster is a professor of electrical
engineering and biophysics and physiology,
there are others whose specialties lie in the
field of dance itself. Dr. James Garrick,
one speaker, is An orthopedic specialist.
Each year, Dance Week focuses on dif
ferent topics pertaining to the dancer.
This year Johnson said she wanted to incor
porate the physiological aspect of move
ment with the artistic side of dance
because "dancers know less about the body
than anyone else involved in an athletic or
movement endeavor."
She added that it is not just the body
which must be developed but the mind as
well. Foerster's lecture on cognition is one
example of what Johnson sees as a
"development of the creative side of the
brain."
