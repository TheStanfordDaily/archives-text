## The
						Stanford Daily Reagan's magic show 
### 
When Newsweek magazine's cover story refers
to the "Reagan magic," it's talking about the
president's ability to extricate himself from
potentially dangerous political situations with
out losing points with American voters. We'd
like to focus on just one area where the presi
dent's sleight of hand seems especially effec
tive: the budget for fiscal year 1985.
The Great Necromancer is at his deceptive
best when working on budgets. But watch out.
There's always something up his sleeve. Here are
some of his most effective tricks.
The disappearing deficit. What's the best way
to deal with a record-breaking deficit, which is
projected to top $180 billion under the Reagan
budget? Don't talk about it. It's really not that
big of a deal, and even if it is, it's all Congress'
fault anyway.
Pick a defense project, any defense project. This
trick's rather predictable. All 52 cards in the
Reagan deck add up to massive increases in the
defense budget. The result: Reagan wants to
spend $305 billion on defense, 13 percent more

— beyond inflation — than the Pentagon spent
in the last budget.
Saw the poor in half Because spending on the
needy is one-third of that spent on defense it
seems natural that the president should aim his
saw at the smaller target. Reagan's proposing
$9.2 billion in cuts in social programs that aid
the poor.
Pull a reform out of his hat. Oops, there's
nothing there. The Reagan budget ignores
needed reforms of the Social Security and edu
cational systems. In the former case, he is, once
again, ignoring the problem because, hey, it's an
election year. In the latter, he is proposing a
$600 million cut in aid to higher education.
Reagan's budget offers more of the same to
the American people, but his perennial
necromancy portends increasingly serious prob
lems for the economy. Most economists agree
the invisible deficit will come back to haunt the
American economy in the form of higher inter
est rates and inflation. But for now?
The hand is quicker than the eye.
