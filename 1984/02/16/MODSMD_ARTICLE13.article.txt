"Some call them 'micks,' some call them
'blowoffs
Law School Prof. John Kaplan calls it libel.
Kaplan filed a $1 million libel suit against
Newsweek last week to protest the "contempt,
ridicule and obloquy" he has suffered as a result
of the magazine's inclusion of his undergraduate
class "Criminal Law and the Criminal System" in
a list of 11 mick college courses.
The professor claims the magazine made more
than a few factual errors in the story. It re
ported that students sun themselves next to
DeGuerre Pool while listening to the lectures on
KZSU. But KZSU never broadcasted the
lectures during the day. It reported that Kaplan
offered a take-home midterm. He didn't.
In October, shortly after the "Giggle of
Guts" feature appeared, Kaplan said of the ar
ticle, "If you think it's true you might be upset.
I'm not upset."
When asked about the poolside lectures,
Kaplan said, "I'm not worried about the
details."
Kaplan joked then that, if the class is so easy,
it should be a surprise that "Criminal Law" isn't
more popular: "There are at least two or three
students out there who haven't taken it."
But by last week, Kaplan had changed his
tunc. The article has "injured the plaintiff in

the estimation of his colleagues, students and
friends, and caused the plaintiff and his family
embarrassment and humiliation," Kaplan's suit
says. "In addition, it has made plaintiff very
angry, indeed."
This abrupt change is disturbing, and the fact
that a law professor, who must be aware of the
overburdened legal system, would take this
giant joke to the courts is even more distressing.
The whole situation is so ridiculously funny —
the idea of the article in the first place, the
not-even-close-to-accurate reporting, the form
letter Kaplan received from Newsweek thanking
him for his "interesting" comments after he
wrote demanding a retraction — that Kaplan
really should have laughed off the article.
But he isn't laughing. We can't condone
Newsweek's sloppy reporting, but we can't
condone Kaplan's zealousness for litigation,
either.
If Kaplan's class really is a mick, his colleagues
and students probably know it. And if it isn't,
they know that, too.
But maybe since October, Kaplan has gotten
tired of ribbing and teasing about the article
from his colleagues and students. Maybe that's
what's made Kaplan so mad. But is that really a
reason to take this matter to to the courts?
Probably not. And it's nothing a little sense
of humor wouldn't solve.
