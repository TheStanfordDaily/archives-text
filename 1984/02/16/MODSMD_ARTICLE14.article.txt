# STUDENTS FOR FUENZALIDA'S TENURE
## Fuenzalida vital to University 
### 
This letter and petition express
our deep concern regarding the deci
sion to deny tenure to Prof. Ed
mundo Fuenzalida.

VIEWPOINT

Because this decision vitally
affects the interests of the student
body as a whole, we feel compelled to
take an active stand on this issue. We
believe this decision will diminish the
academic standard of the entire
School of Education, especially in
regard to the following:
1) Fuenzalida is the only represen
tative of the Third World in a pro
gram which is dedicated to
international development. Specifi
cally, he is one of the most outstand
ing researchers within a school of

thought that originated in the Third
World, thus offering a unique and ir
replaceable perspective in the fields
of education and the sociology of
development. Moreover, his scholar
ship provides the only direct link to
Latin American intellectual en
deavors.
2) Student support for Fuenzalida
is overwhelming. As a teacher, he is
rigorous, challenging and inspiring.
As an adviser, he commits himself
fully to the intellectual advance
ment of his students by sharing with
them his own creative research.
3) Based on 1 and 2 above, we
strongly believe Fuenzalida excels in
fulfilling every criteria for a tenured
professor.
4) The Review Committee recom
mended that he be granted tenure.

We firmly support this recommenda
tion.
The denial of tenure to Fuenzalida
reflects a dangerous trend in the
School of Education against Third
World and minority scholarship. This,
following the resignation of Prof.
Arturo Pacheco in protest of the
school's lack of commitment on
these issues, threatens the diversity
of our education.
We the undersigned students of
the School of Education and others
who have benefitted from Fuen
zalida's presence at Stanford firmly
express our disapproval of this ac
tion. We demand both reconsidera
tion of the decision to deny tenure
and a response to our concerns.
(Lee Anderson, a graduate student in
the School of Education, and 12 others
