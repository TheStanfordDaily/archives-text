## Sigma Chis'behavior part of our culture 
### 
After reading "Sigma Chis lack manners"
(Daily, Feb. 7), I couldn't help feeling disap
pointed. The letter was intended as a protest to
a series of acts committed by members of the
local Sigma Chi chapter. Apparently, on a "sunny,
warm and glorious" afternoon of recent past,
some Sigma Chi "brothers" found it fit to sit on
the roof of their house and rain physically
evaluative remarks down upon passing women. As
rain usually dampens a sunny day, two women
who were objects of these comments decided to
write The Daily and complain.

VIEWPOINT

The letter they wrote was good insofar as it
was written. I'm sure countless women have
passed Sigma Chis' gauntlet under similar circum
stances without taking the time to voice their
objections, or, worse yet, without knowing that
anything objectionable had transpired. The let
ter was disappointing precisely because it failed
to adduce the reasons why what the Sigma Chis
did was offensive. The authors did mention that
they wanted to talk about (but didn't) "the core
of fury that resides in helplessness." Why didn't
they? That would have been perfect. So at the
end of the letter, when the authors say (to the
Sigma Chis. presumably) "maybe you will put this
letter up in your house and laugh for the rest of
the quarter." 1 imagine that's exactly what
they're doing. Aside from deeming the fraternity
to be a bunch of immature boys, their behavior
went unchallenged.
()l course, perhaps the authors felt, as I do.
that there's a genuine sense of futility in trying
to speak sensibly to those males who participate

in these ritualistic acts. I can only conject that
males who do this sort of thing defend them
selves with any number of spurious excuses. Per
haps they wish to reverse the situation so that
they can claim "if women told me I had a nice
ass/chest, I wouldn't mind. In fact. I would be
flattered." So the problem, according to this
view, is that men are just better "sports" about
dealing with these matters than are women. That
attitude wouldn't surprise me. Nor would it
surprise me if the fraternity rushed to its own
defense by claiming that, on occasion, a group of
women might behave similarly, jeering at passing
men.
To use this kind of logic to exculpate the
fraternity falls short of the real point, because it
ignores the cultural context in which the abusive
remarks are couched. Now my doubts about the
potential effect of this letter on the guys of
Sigma Chi are really grave. If they can't appreci
ate the significance of their cultural context,
what is one to do? Define sexism? Maybe its
time to tell the guys of Sigma Chi a story, start
ing from the beginning. Okay . . . here goes.
Billions and billions of years ago, patriarchy
started.
On second thought, that would take too long.
Perhaps its best to adumbrate a few central
points. Men sitting high upon their rooftops
gauging the value of women's anatomies without
knowing who they are. and casting down opinions,
calls to mind one paradigm: The paradigm of a
judge. Obviously, not all judgments are so in
vidious. What makes this kind of judgment par
ticularly noxious is that, in our culture, men and
women don't objectify their bodies in the same
way.
There's a general asymmetry between the

viewer and the viewed, which, in most cases,
places men in a position of power. The power and
authority inherent in the Sigma Chis' rooftop
command post and the corresponding powerless
ness of the females walking below in representa
tive of the fear and helplessness which makes
women painfully aware of their vulnerability in
our world. Sexual assault stems from the same
sort of abuse of power. Of course, no one is sug
gesting that the men on the Sigma Chi rooftop
have actually threatened to jump down and as
sault women, but the taunting, snide, and con
temptuous remarks are effectively symbolic of
just that.
I hope (but also doubt) that the fraternity can
appreciate the substantive qualitative differ
ence between their behavior and the physical ad
miration a lover affords his/her partner, or the
quiet, passive admiration that we all offer to at
tractive passersby. Both of these latter situa
tions are natural, and I think, desirable. There's
nothing intrinsically wrong with taking favorable
note of someone's aesthetic qualities.
Perhaps the women passing Sigma Chi are, in
fact, attractive (by whatever criteria the frater
nity employs in making these judgments). No one
is, (or, at least, should be) questioning the ac
curacy of the Sigma Chis' perceptions; instead,
my criticisms are focused on the manner in which
these perceptions are expressed.
So perhaps The Daily will print this. Perhaps
the men at Sigma Chi will even read it. No mat
ter. The truth is that letters like this one aren't
really written to be read by people like those at
Sigma Chi; rather, the letters are written because
of people like those who live at Sigma Chi.
