# No need for men in space
## 
### 
Do we really need a manned space
station? It's a glamorous project, all
right, and at $8 billion for a basic
model, it ought to be. 1 wonder,
though, about the effects of such an
enormous undertaking on the health
of the rest of the space program.
No one doubts the feasibility of a
space station. Skylab and Salyut were
orbiting years ago, and last year one
shuttle flight took the European
built Spacelab along for the ride. As
now conceived, a permanent space
station would be constructed of
modules not so different from these.
One module would serve as living
quarters, another as an exercise
room, a third might be dedicated to
manufacturing, and so on.
What I question in this proposal is
the necessity of continuous human
habitation. Proponents are quick to
say that humans are the most
flexible computers around. They are
also the most costly. They require
years of training, redundant life sup
port systems, a large amount of
space to breathe, eat, excrete and ex
ercise. Every 150-pound astronaut
we place in orbit keeps far more than
150 pounds of equipment on the
ground, and every ounce matters.
Currently, NASA charges several
thousand dollars for its "getaway
specials" — small packages the
shuttle carries when space is
available.
As for human flexibility in space,
it is more limited than some seem to
imagine. The astronauts on the
latest shuttle mission watched help
lessly as two communications
satellites were launched into useless
orbits. A space station in near-earth
orbit can't do much for a communi
cations satellite 22,000 miles further
out. As for satellites in near-earth
orbit, the shuttle will have the capa
bility to maintain them. This capabil
ity will be demonstrated on the next
shuttle flight, when a solar obser
vatory satellite will be put in working
order again. So fixing many equip
ment breakdowns doesn't demand a
continuous human presence.
Consider also the lukewarm reac
tion of the scientific community to
President Reagan's proposal. A Na
tional Academy of Sciences report
found "no scientific need for this

space station during the next 20
years." Suspicion within the scien
tific community may be well
founded, for just as the shuttle
program was beset by delays and vast
cost overruns, NASA's planetary sci
ence program deteriorated signifi
cantly.
During the past 12 years there has
been real excitement as half a dozen
new worlds were revealed through
projects such as the Viking soft
landings on Mars. The excitement
spilled well beyond the astronomical
community; when NASA ran out of
funds to continue Viking operations,
thousands responded with contribu
tions to keep them going.
In recent years the prospects for
further planetary exploration have

diminished in proportion to NASA's
budget.) The Jupiter orbiter and the
Haley's comet probe have been axed,
and the Venus orbiter and space
telescope have been scaled down
Missions to the asteroids and to
bring back samples from Mars are out
of the picture for now.
If NASA's principal efforts in the
coming years go toward a manned
space station, support for scientific
programs will continue to be dismal.
What about military uses of a
space station? The space station has
always had a military side, so we
shouldn't be too surprised at this
next logical extension of man's role
in space.
Visions of Imperial Stormtroopers
with lasers in hand spring to mind.
The Department of Defense (DoD)
must be drooling in anticipation,
right? Well, according to NASA ad
ministrator James Beggs, the DoD
has "so far . .. shown very little in
terest." Given the Pentagon's
propensity toward spending a lot of
money on crazy projects, I, for one,
found this mildly surprising. My
hunch, though, is that if a space sta
tion is ever built, the military can
dream up some way to use this new

toy.
Why, then, did President Reagan
come out in favor of a space station?
As neither the scientific nor the mili
tary establishments seem very enthu
siastic. we must look elsewhere for
answers.
Two things come to mind, and it's
plausible that both were important
in Reagan's decision. First, as I've
mentioned, is the high visibility and
prestige of such a project, and second
is that it provides a place to make
those incredibly perfect ball bearings
and giant silicon crystals we've been
hearing about.
Both objectives seem innocuous
enough, but I would prefer to
sacrifice some of the prestige in or
der to reduce the cost of the ball

bearings and crystals. Products made
in space are going to be extraor
dinarily expensive anyway, because
quantities will be limited and trans
portation costs high. Automating
manufacturers as much as possible is
a sensible way to keep costs
manageable.
It a manned space station turns
out to be truly necessary, then
maybe the interested companies
should take an active role in financ
ing it, just as private companies now
pay lor communications satellites.
In itself, a space station won't be
detrimental to the U.S. space pro
gram. In the context of limited
budgets, however, its appropriate
ness must be questioned. NASA's
main goal has always been the devel
opment of space science and technol
ogy. and many companies, as well as
the public, have benefitted from its
endeavors. There is no call for tax
payers to finance a facility whose
principal use appears to be commer
cial, not scientific or even military.
NASA's proper role is to cooperate
with commercial users, not to sub
sidize them.

Do we really need a manned space
station? It's a glamorous project, all
right, and at $8 billion for a basic
model, it ought to be. 1 wonder,
though, about the effects of such an
enormous undertaking on the health
of the rest of the space program.
No one doubts the feasibility of a
space station. Skylab and Salyut were
orbiting years ago, and last year one
shuttle flight took the European
built Spacelab along for the ride. As
now conceived, a permanent space
station would be constructed of
modules not so different from these.
One module would serve as living
quarters, another as an exercise
room, a third might be dedicated to
manufacturing, and so on.
What I question in this proposal is
the necessity of continuous human
habitation. Proponents are quick to
say that humans are the most
flexible computers around. They are
also the most costly. They require
years of training, redundant life sup
port systems, a large amount of
space to breathe, eat, excrete and ex
ercise. Every 150-pound astronaut
we place in orbit keeps far more than
150 pounds of equipment on the
ground, and every ounce matters.
Currently, NASA charges several
thousand dollars for its "getaway
specials" — small packages the
shuttle carries when space is
available.
As for human flexibility in space,
it is more limited than some seem to
imagine. The astronauts on the
latest shuttle mission watched help
lessly as two communications
satellites were launched into useless
orbits. A space station in near-earth
orbit can't do much for a communi
cations satellite 22,000 miles further
out. As for satellites in near-earth
orbit, the shuttle will have the capa
bility to maintain them. This capabil
ity will be demonstrated on the next
shuttle flight, when a solar obser
vatory satellite will be put in working
order again. So fixing many equip
ment breakdowns doesn't demand a
continuous human presence.
Consider also the lukewarm reac
tion of the scientific community to
President Reagan's proposal. A Na
tional Academy of Sciences report
found "no scientific need for this

space station during the next 20
years." Suspicion within the scien
tific community may be well
founded, for just as the shuttle
program was beset by delays and vast
cost overruns, NASA's planetary sci
ence program deteriorated signifi
cantly.
During the past 12 years there has
been real excitement as half a dozen
new worlds were revealed through
projects such as the Viking soft
landings on Mars. The excitement
spilled well beyond the astronomical
community; when NASA ran out of
funds to continue Viking operations,
thousands responded with contribu
tions to keep them going.

further planetary exploration have
