# Panel considers changes at Meyer
## 
### BETH KNEELAND 
When one loud student on the
third floor of Meyer Undergraduate
Library was asked to be quiet one
night this week, he replied, "C'mon,
this is Meyer."
This traditional irreverence
towards Meyer — the campus library
widely regarded as more of a social
gathering place than as a location tor
serious studying — is drawing fire
from some members of the Stanford
community who wish to change
Meyer's casual image.
A recent ASSU survey on Meyer
indicates that undergraduates do not
like to study at Meyer because of its
noise level, its uncomfortable
furniture and its reputation — stu
dents don't like the tact that it is
known as the "undergraduate li
brary.
The results of this survey are part
of the evidence being studied by a
new panel that has been convened to
evaluate Meyer's functions and pro
pose areas for improvement.
According to History Prot. Peter
Pa ret. chairman of the panel, the
purpose of the panel is "to torm
ulate a concept and define an educa
tional program model tor Meyer
that will enable it to meet the needs
of Stanford undergraduates.
ASSU senator Mark Fleischauer.
one of the student members ot the

panel, said Meyer's reputation is hurt
by the fact that it's the
"undergraduate" library. Many stu
dents prefer the idea of working in a
"graduate" library such as Green.
Fleischauer said.
Fleischauer added that "the com
mittee has decided that the
furniture has to be changed." and
that the new furniture should be
"more conducive to studying."
Paret indicated that even more
changes are being considered. The
lobbv will definitely be changed:
Much more electronic equipment and
a strictly social facility might be
added, he said.
Paret also said an architect will be
present at the panel's next meeting
to discuss practical and financial con
siderations for major changes in the
design of the library.
According to Paret. the panel has
been convened jointly by Carolyn
Lougee, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences, and David
Weber, director of University libra
ries.
When contacted by The Daily,
stall members at Meyer said they
had never heard of the ASSU survey
and indicated that they have no plans
to change the furniture or the atmo
sphere in the near future. Elizabeth
Salzer. head of Meyer Library, said,
"other things have a higher priority."
