## Hobbled Trojans face ill Card 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The USC basketball team, or
what's left of it, travels north
to face Stanford tonight at
7:30 in Maples Pavilion.
As if a 9-15 overall record
and 4-7 Pacific-10 Conference
mark (including dropping four
of the last five) aren't bad
enough, five players on the
Trojan roster probably won't
suit up for tonight's game.
Center Clayton Olivier has

bone spurs in his left foot and
will undergo surgery today.
He'll stay in Los Angeles.
Back-up center Derrick Dowell
will be attending funeral
services for his father. He'll be
in Indiana.
And the list doesn't stop
there. Forward Cedric Bailey,
the only senior on the
freshman- and sophomore
dominated team, is being
tested for pneumonia after
repeated asthma attacks. Ivan

Harris, a freshman gaurd, has a
hematoma and is doubtful, as
is 6-foot-7 sophomore Troy
LaMar with another injury.
"Other than that, things are
going great," USC Coach Stan
Morrison joked over the phone
to reporters gathered yester
day. "It's interesting (coaching
the past few games) because
you have different players
playing each night. We're really
playing musical chairs at some
positions."
But Stanford Coach Tom
Davis, whose Cardinal is now
16-8 overall and 5-6 in the Pac
-10, isn't one to take any team
lightly, especially not one
coached by Morrison.
"He is pretty deep in that
he's been playing eight or nine
people all season," Davis said
yesterday. "So he can lose a
Dowell or an Olivier and not be
as affected (as other teams
might be). They are a good,
talented team in terms of run
ning and jumping and hitting
the boards."
The most talented of the
Trojans is Wayne Carlander, by
far the most underrated player
in the Pac-10. The 6-8 junior
forward is averaging 15.4
points and 6.1 rebounds this
season. In just Pac-10 contests,
he is tied for sixth with
Oregon's Blair Rasmussen in
scoring at 16.5.
"He doesn't talk much.
That's definitely true," said
Cardinal guard Keith Jones,
who played with Carlander last
summer on a Pac-10 all-star
team. "But he is a really solid
player fundamentally. He has a
good jump shot and goes to the
boards well."
Jones and his teammates
should know, too. Carlander
had one of his best games of
the season in USC's 51-49
overtime victory over Stanford
last month in Los Angeles.
Carlander scored a game-high
22 points and made 11 -of-15
shots from the floor, including
his first eight straight.
"Wayne Carlander is a very
good basketball player that
doesn't get the attention he
deserves because he is an un
spectacular player," Morrison

said. "But he gets the job
done."
Besides the junior Carlander,
Morrison will prohably start 6-
5 junior Ron Holmes at the
other forward, 6-8 freshman
Rod Keller at center and sop
homores Kevin Seward and
Larry Friend at the guards.
Davis and company remem
bers Friend well from the last
meeting with the Trojans. The
5-11 Friend hit what Morrison
later called a "semi-Hail Mary"
— a twisting, double-clutch
10-foot bank shot — with six
seconds left in overtime that
proved to be the game winner.
But Carlander's 22-point
game and Friend's "semi-Hail
Mary" came during a stretch of
six straight Cardinal losses.
Things are different now, less
than a month later, as Stan
ford has won five consecutive
Pac-10 games.
The last time Stanford won
six straight conference games
was in the 1941-42 season,
when the Everett Dean
coached team went on to win
the NCAA title. That also was
the last time a Cardinal bas
ketball team went to a post
season tournament, something
it has an good chance of
repeating this year should it
win 20 games.
To reach the psychologically
advantageous 20-win mark,
Stanford will have to win four
its seven remaining games.
Davis plans to start Jones,
John Revelli, Steve Brown, Earl
Koberlein and John Paye. Point
guard Keith Ramee will remain
in his back-up position at point
guard, despite a career-high 16-
point performance against UC-
Berkeley Friday night. After
going 12-for-12 from the free
throw line in the game, Ramee
has moved into first place in
the Pac-10 in that depart
ment.
Card notes
The Stanford basketball of
fice has declared Saturday's
game against UCLA as "Red
T-shirt Day" for the
nationally-televised affair. All
fans, especially those sitting at
courtside, are urged to wear
red T-shirts for the cameras.

Stanford sophomore Andy Fischer may still be on his back
come game time. Fischer saw limited action against Cal on
Friday and is still sick with the flu.
