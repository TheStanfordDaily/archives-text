# Netwomen must fight illness and Santa Clara
## 
### JOHN LIS 
There seems to be a flu hug hitting Stan
ford athletic teams this time of year, and the
women's tennis team is currently feeling the
effects. Four players are fighting the virus,
and this, coupled with some serious injuries,
has left Head Coach Frank Brennan some
what shorthanded for this afternoon's match
here against Santa Clara.
Topping the serious injury list is senior Elise
Burgin. The Baltimore native was ranked No.
2 in the nation to begin the year, but she is
currently in a hospital back home in traction
for a back injury.
Doctors believe her injury is a disc problem
which began at last summer's U.S. Open and
grew progressively worse. Brennan said he
does not know when she will be able to return
to action.
Freshman Patty Fendick has also had her
problems. Fendick was forced to default in
the finals of last weekend's National Indoor
Individual Championships because of severe
leg cramps. Fendick is currently out with a
serious case of the flu and has returned home
to Sacramento to recover.
Sophomore Kate Gompert may return to
action today. Gompert sprained her ankle in a

tournament prior to the start of the season
and missed the Cardinal's first four matches
of the year.
Brennan will probably be without the
services of sophomore Alyce Werdel and
senior Michelle Weiss, both of whom caught
the flu during the Card's successful road trip
to Arizona last weekend. Both had started
the first four matches this season, Weiss
going 3-1 while Werdel was 4-0.
Brennan said freshman Leigh Anne
Eldredge (3-0), who is also battling the flu,
should play today.
Also able to go for the Cardinal today will
be freshman Stephanie Savides (3-1), juniors
Linda Gates (1-1) and Barbara Baughman (1-
3), and sophomore Susan Ross (0-2).
Brennan was thankful that the injuries
have come now, however. "It probably
couldn't come at a better time for us, " he
said. "Santa Clara is not really a powerhouse,
and we don't have another match until March
2." The netters' scheduled match against San
Diego next Wednesday has been cancelled,
and the UC-Berkeley match slated for Feb.
24 will be played March 2.
Today's match begins at 1:30 p.m. on the
Varsity Tennis Courts.
