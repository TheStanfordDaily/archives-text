Stanford freshman Kathy
McCarthy led the Car
dinal to a third place
finish at the Arizona Inter
collegiate this week while
placing third individually.
The Cardinal finished with
a three-day total of 934,
only two strokes out of
second. McCarthy's 227
placed her securely in
third and moved her into
the 16th overall ranking
among collegiate women,
tops on the Stanford team.
