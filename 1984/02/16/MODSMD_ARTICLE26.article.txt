Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (AP) —
The U.S. hockey team's disap
pointment has set the tone for
the Americans in this year's
Olympic Games, brightened
Wednesday only by pace
setting performances by figure
skater Rosalynn Sumners and
downhill skier Bill Johnson.
Instead of equaling or bet
tering the record-tying 12 U.S.
medals won in Lake Placid, the
U.S. team now faces its worst
performance since it won only
six at the 1964 Games at Inns
bruck, Austria.
So far, it has only three, and
longshot chances for two more
were lost Wednesday when fig
ure skaters Elaine Zavak and

Tiffany Chin fell back in com
pulsory competition.
The difference between
Lake Placid and Sarajevo was
never more apparent than it
was in the U.S.-Finland hockey
game.
Four years ago. the two
teams met and it meant some
thing. Enraptured Americans
were riveted to their television
sets on a Sunday morning,
watching a miracle on ice
develop before their eyes. A 4-
2 victory gave the U.S. team a
gold medal. Goalie Jim Craig,
flag over his shoulder, peered
into the crowd of thousands,
looking for his father. America
had won.

The only drama Wednesday
lasted all of 37 seconds, when
the U.S. team took the lead on
a late short-handed goal, then
lost it with 15 seconds left
when Finland tied. The United
States can now finish no better
than seventh in the 12-team
field. The worst previous finish
for an American hockey team
was sixth in 1968 at Grenoble,
France.
There was drama in the
men's downhill, and of a
brighter shade for Americans.
Johnson, of Van Nuys, Calif.,
clocked the fastest time in the
fifth training run on Mount
Bjelnasica and remains a favor
ite in the men's downhill event.
