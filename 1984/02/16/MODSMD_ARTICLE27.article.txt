# It's time for a Pac-10 tourney
## 
### 
The time has come for the Pacific-10
Conference to grow up.
While other conferences have
adopted the post-season tournament
format, filling their bins with cash, pro
viding excitement to players and fans,
and giving their teams an added chance
at post-season tournament play, the
Pac-10 has turned its back on the idea
of a conference tournament.
At a vote taken earlier this year,
Stanford basketball Coach Tom Davis
was one of the few supporting the
post-season tournament idea. At Bos
ton College, Davis saw the many advan
tages of a conference tournament. Yet
the old guard of the Pac-10 — mainly
UCLA — and other neanderthal minds
still remain opposed.
Some players, like senior Stanford
guard Keith Jones, think that the Pac
-10 is not only ready for a tournament,
but that it is long overdue.
"It's about three years too late,"
Jones said. "It would be something real
ly exciting to have at the end of the
season."
Just think, without a post-season
conference tournament, last year's
NCAA champion North Carolina State
may never have been invited to the
NCAAs at all. That was a team that
had problems early on, but came on
strong at the end of the year. Winning
the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)
Tournament was the deciding factor
that gave NC State an NCAA berth.
Isn't that the kind of team that should
be playing in the NCAA Tournament?
Or take Fresno State, last year's Na
tional Invitation Tournament (NIT)
champion. If it hadn't won its confer
ence tournament at the end of the
year, it probably would not have
received an invitation.
The Pac-10 is certainly not experienc
ing the problem of over-recognition,
and with only one team currently in the
top 20, a post-season tournament
would only increase exposure for every
one in the conference.
"Only two teams from the Pac-10
went to the NCAA Tournament last
year," Davis said. "How many went
from the ACC, the Big East and the
Big-10? Four or five."
In addition, Davis said that a confer
ence tournament would give teams a
chance to get an extra two or three
wins which look good to the post
season tournament committees, like
the NCAA and especially the NIT,
which seems to have an unofficial
cutoff that a team win, in most cases,
approximately 20 games.
Of the many reasons for a Pac-10
tournament, - the"''excitement' 1 that
would be generated is one of the most

compelling. As it stands now, teams
which start out poorly, even if they are
playing well and keeping games close,
are out of it before the season really
begins. By early February, teams in the
bottom half of the conference stand
ings slowly lose support as fans and
players alike see no way of salvaging the
season.
By contrast, an end of the year
tournament would provide teams with
something to look forward to. A school

in the bottom half of the conference
standings could still generate excite
ment in its last few games, both to get
a better tournament seeding and to
look good to the NCAA or NIT in the
event that it plays well and possibly
wins the conference tournament.
Davis, a strong proponent of the
tournament idea, feels that both fans
and players would benefit from the
excitement.
"You'd get tremendous enthusiasm
in late February with a Pac-10 tourna
ment," Davis said. "Even teams that
are seventh or eighth in the standings
would be vying for seeding positions.
"The tournament is an exciting way
to end the year, for the fans and espe
cially for the players — crowds, ban
quets and just the excitement of a
tournament."
Along with excitement, a post
season conference tournament jus
tifiably rewards those teams which are
playing well at the end of the year.
While it may be argued that Davis is
just being self-serving in his support for
a tournament, since a peaking team like
Stanford would have a lot to gain, it
should be noted that Davis' support for
the idea came prior to this season,
before he knew which direction Car
dinal basketball would be heading. Fur
thermore, isn't a peaking team the kind
that should be playing in post-season
tournament like the NCAA and the
NIT?
"It's not just Stanford that would
benefit from the tournament," Davis
said yesterday, "but teams like South
ern Cal and Arizona. Both of those
teams have been playing really good
basketball recently and have lost
several close games. I think almost
every team in the conference would
have a chance."
1 • conference tournament would also
negate the effects of long layoffs

which often plague teams who enter
the NCAA Tournament after a two
week layoff. This is especially
noticeable for teams which get byes in
the first round. Is it any wonder in
recent years that Pac-10, Big-10 and
Independent schools have not fared
particularly well?
The clinching argument tor a Pac-10
tournament is financial. Quite simply,
it would be a financial boon to the
schools in the conterence. Here at
Stanford, the dollars-and-sense aspect
of sports has been made only too clear
in the wake of the Athletic Depart
ment's recent financial difficulties,
which have threatened the very lite ot
several smaller sports on the Farm.
Davis, who coached at Boston C ol
lege. was not well acquainted with the
precise figures, but told an anecdote
from his experience at B.C. to describe
how big the financial gains could be.
"It would be a big moneymaker,"
Davis said. "When I first coached at
8.C., I had to convince the athletic
director there to come up with $25,000
to enter the league (the Big East). He
came up with the money primarily be
cause of the benefits he saw in the
future from a Big East tournament.
"Three years later, prior to the
season, each team received $1 million
(Davis noted the figure was an approxi
mation). We would never have received
that kind of money without a post
season tournament. By the third year,
Madison Square Garden paid $1 million
a year for the tournament, with no
television rights."
The arguments against the tourna
ment pale in comparison to the advan
tages.
One argument used by those against
the idea is that players would lose too
much classtime. The argument,
however, is nothing more than cover. If
scheduled properly, players might miss
an extra day or two of class. Coming
from schools which serve as training
grounds for the professional ranks, the
argument is quite humorous.
Seeing through the smokescreen,
Stanford guard Keith Ramee gave his
view on the subject. "I thought we were
the only students (in the Pac-10) that
went to class anyway," he said yester
day.
The real reason that there is no
tournament was explained only too well
by a surprisingly open UCLA Coach
Larry Farmer. "UCLA has always been
against a tournament," he said yester
day. "It's never been to our advantage
to have it.
The time has come for the Pac-10 to
accept the inevitable. Progress can not
be locked up forever.

begins. By early February, teams in the
bottom half of the conference stand
ings slowly lose support as fans and
players alike see no way of salvaging the
season.

in the bottom half of the conference
standings could still generate excite
ment in its last few games, both to get
a better tournament seeding and to
look good to the NCAA or NIT in the
event that it plays well and possibly
wins the conference tournament.
Davis, a strong proponent of the
tournament idea, feels that both fans
and players would benefit from the
excitement.
"You'd get tremendous enthusiasm
in late February with a Pac-10 tourna
ment," Davis said. "Even teams that
are seventh or eighth in the standings
would be vying for seeding positions.
"The tournament is an exciting way
to end the year, for the fans and espe
cially for the players — crowds, ban
quets and just the excitement of a
tournament."
Along with excitement, a post
season conference tournament jus
tifiably rewards those teams which are
playing well at the end of the year.
While it may be argued that Davis is
just being self-serving in his support for
a tournament, since a peaking team like
Stanford would have a lot to gain, it
should be noted that Davis' support for
the idea came prior to this season,
before he knew which direction Car
dinal basketball would be heading. Fur
thermore, isn't a peaking team the kind
that should be playing in post-season
tournament like the NCAA and the
NIT?
"It's not just Stanford that would
benefit from the tournament," Davis
said yesterday, "but teams like South
ern Cal and Arizona. Both of those
teams have been playing really good
basketball recently and have lost
several close games. I think almost
every team in the conference would
have a chance."
1 • conference tournament would also
negate the effects of long layoffs

which often plague teams who enter
the NCAA Tournament after a two
week layoff. This is especially
noticeable for teams which get byes in
the first round. Is it any wonder in
recent years that Pac-10, Big-10 and
Independent schools have not fared
particularly well?
The clinching argument tor a Pac-10
tournament is financial. Quite simply,
it would be a financial boon to the
schools in the conterence. Here at
Stanford, the dollars-and-sense aspect
of sports has been made only too clear
in the wake of the Athletic Depart
ment's recent financial difficulties,
which have threatened the very lite ot
several smaller sports on the Farm.
Davis, who coached at Boston C ol
lege. was not well acquainted with the
precise figures, but told an anecdote
from his experience at B.C. to describe
how big the financial gains could be.
"It would be a big moneymaker,"
Davis said. "When I first coached at
8.C., I had to convince the athletic
director there to come up with $25,000
to enter the league (the Big East). He
came up with the money primarily be
cause of the benefits he saw in the
future from a Big East tournament.
"Three years later, prior to the
season, each team received $1 million
(Davis noted the figure was an approxi
mation). We would never have received
that kind of money without a post
season tournament. By the third year,
Madison Square Garden paid $1 million
a year for the tournament, with no
television rights."
The arguments against the tourna
ment pale in comparison to the advan
tages.
One argument used by those against
the idea is that players would lose too
much classtime. The argument,
however, is nothing more than cover. If
scheduled properly, players might miss
an extra day or two of class. Coming
from schools which serve as training
grounds for the professional ranks, the
argument is quite humorous.
Seeing through the smokescreen,
Stanford guard Keith Ramee gave his
view on the subject. "I thought we were
the only students (in the Pac-10) that
went to class anyway," he said yester
day.
The real reason that there is no
tournament was explained only too well
by a surprisingly open UCLA Coach
Larry Farmer. "UCLA has always been
against a tournament," he said yester
day. "It's never been to our advantage
to have it.
The time has come for the Pac-10 to
accept the inevitable. Progress can not
be locked up forever.
The time has come for the Pacific-10
Conference to grow up.
While other conferences have
adopted the post-season tournament
format, filling their bins with cash, pro
viding excitement to players and fans,
and giving their teams an added chance
at post-season tournament play, the
Pac-10 has turned its back on the idea
of a conference tournament.
At a vote taken earlier this year,
Stanford basketball Coach Tom Davis
was one of the few supporting the
post-season tournament idea. At Bos
ton College, Davis saw the many advan
tages of a conference tournament. Yet
the old guard of the Pac-10 — mainly
UCLA — and other neanderthal minds
still remain opposed.
Some players, like senior Stanford
guard Keith Jones, think that the Pac
-10 is not only ready for a tournament,
but that it is long overdue.
"It's about three years too late,"
Jones said. "It would be something real
ly exciting to have at the end of the
season."
Just think, without a post-season
conference tournament, last year's
NCAA champion North Carolina State
may never have been invited to the
NCAAs at all. That was a team that
had problems early on, but came on
strong at the end of the year. Winning
the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)
Tournament was the deciding factor
that gave NC State an NCAA berth.
Isn't that the kind of team that should
be playing in the NCAA Tournament?
Or take Fresno State, last year's Na
tional Invitation Tournament (NIT)
champion. If it hadn't won its confer
ence tournament at the end of the
year, it probably would not have
received an invitation.
The Pac-10 is certainly not experienc
ing the problem of over-recognition,
and with only one team currently in the
top 20, a post-season tournament
would only increase exposure for every
one in the conference.
"Only two teams from the Pac-10
went to the NCAA Tournament last
year," Davis said. "How many went
from the ACC, the Big East and the
Big-10? Four or five."
In addition, Davis said that a confer
ence tournament would give teams a
chance to get an extra two or three
wins which look good to the post
season tournament committees, like
the NCAA and especially the NIT,
which seems to have an unofficial
cutoff that a team win, in most cases,
approximately 20 games.
Of the many reasons for a Pac-10
tournament, - the"''excitement' 1 that
would be generated is one of the most

compelling. As it stands now, teams
which start out poorly, even if they are
playing well and keeping games close,
are out of it before the season really
begins. By early February, teams in the
bottom half of the conference stand
ings slowly lose support as fans and
players alike see no way of salvaging the
