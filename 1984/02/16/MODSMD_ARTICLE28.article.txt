Senior Connie Conley is a
downhill ski raeer, and just
like any other competitive
downhill skier Conley races
down steep courses at over
50 miles per hour.
But when Conley is at the
top of a course, she cannot

see the finish line.
Conley is legally blind. She
can see nothing out of her
left eye, and her right eye
has 20/200 vision. The 21-
year-old has been partially
sighted since birth, but she
has not let the handicap
stand in her way.
In fact, seeing a blurry
world has caused Conley to
have a clearer vision about
her goals and how she can
attain them. When Conley
decided to focus on being a
competitive skier there was
no stopping her.
At the age of nine, Con
ley learned to ski in the
Sierra Mountains near her
hometown of Reno,
Nevada. When she was a
sophomore in high school
she began racing in a pro
gram for the handicapped.
In her first year as a com
petitor she won a national
competition for partially
sighted skiers in Colorado.
Conley set a record there
that has not been broken in
six years.
After Conley began win

ning races and setting
records in the United
States, her skiing career
took a turn uphill.
"When I was a freshman
at Stanford, I heard about
the Winter Games for the
Disabled that were going to
be held in Switzerland the
next year," she said. "And I
started to train intensely."
Her training paid off, be
cause the next year in Swit
zerland Conley took a fifth
place overall in the games.
This past January she
traveled to Innsbruck,
Austria to compete in the
games again. The second

time was a charm for Con
ley. She eame home with a
third place overall, and a sil
ver medal in the giant
slalom.
"This time I wanted to
come home with something
better," she said. "I got the
best feeling deep down
from winning those
medals."
Conley is quick to note
that because of the nature
of partially blind racing her
medals are shared.
"I race with a guide
named Lacy Wells. Ideally,
in partially blind skiing the
guide stays 10 feet ahead of

the racer. When I ski I just
concentrate on Lacy in
front of me, and block
everything else out."
Conley continued, "It
really is a team effort. So
when I receive a medal I al
ways say, for example, 'We
took a third.' Both ends are
very important."
Although Conley has mas
tered her sport, it can still
be a little scary to be a par
tially blind skier. She experi
enced what she calls her
"war story" in the games in
Innsbruck.
"Lacy got a pine bough
caught in her ski break
during the race. " she said.
"It slowed her down so
much that I passed her. I
couldn't see the course so
well, and I just followed the
pine boughs that marked
it."
A rule in partially blind
skiing is that the guide must
finish before the racer. For
tunately, Wells caught up
with Conley and then passed
her. The team managed to
capture third place in the
race.
"It was pretty amazing,"
said Conley.
Participating in interna
tional competition has en
hanced Conley's life. "I
meet the most wonderful
people," she said. "It really
is a big thing — even politi
cal figures come to the
games. In this year's games
the queen of Sweden pre
sented me with the third
place."
The Disabled Games are
run by the International
Olympic Committee, and,
according to Conley, they
are set up just like the real

Olympics. "It's so exciting
to be a part of it all. There
is a real international
feeling at the games — this
year we traded pins with
people from different
countries."
Conley has been able to
meet many people through
the competition that share
her problem, and she has
learned from them. "I
learned that being partially
blind is not just a strict cat
egory. There are tons of dif
ferent conditions, and you
have to ask each person how
much they can see."
The senior does note a
problem with the program
for disabled blind skiers. She
said that other disabled
athletes — such as am
putees — get more funding
and respect.
"The public seems to be
more aware of the physically

handicapped because their
handicap is more obvious.
Blind skiers look normal on
the slopes except for their
blind bibs."
Conley hopes that as time
goes on the blind skiers will
get the recognition that
they deserve. But she does
not want to fight to change
the status quo.
"I'm confident that
things will improve without
my help; I'm ready to get on
with other things in mv
life."
Academics have always
been important to her, and
the discipline she learned as
a student helped her to regi
ment herself in athletic
training.
Conley was the first par
tially blind student to hit
the Farm. "Stanford was
very helpful — my profes
sors were understanding.

I've had no huge stumbling
blocks in my education
here."
Just as she did not allow
her handicap to hinder her
from becoming an award
winning skier, she did not let
it affect her life as a normal
Stanford student. But why
didn't Conley join the ski
team here?
"I probably could join the
team. I'm sure that my
times are quite comparable
to theirs, and I have done
dry-land training with
them," she said. "But the
rules are just really differ
ent from what I'm used to."
Conley plans to end her
racing career while it is on a
'high,' but her skis are not
going into the closet for
good. "I'll always want to
ski — and I'll always want to
be a resource for other dis
abled athletes.
