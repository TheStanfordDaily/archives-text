## Chilean pianist Claudio Arrau: from the 'golden age' 
### RICHARD NAGAREDA WILLIAM FEREIRA 
Chilean pianist Claudio Ar
rau gave ample proof of his
stature as one of the most dis
tinguished keyboard artists of
the present day in his recital on
Sunda\ evening in Davies Sym
phony Hall. For the second
consecutive season, Arrau dem
onstrated that the world has
not yet lost touch with the
great musical traditions of the
last century, yet the pianist si
multaneously reminded me of
how precarious and fleeting
that familiarity may become in
the future.
The evening did not begin
auspiciously, however. The
muffled, bass-deficient acous
tics of my seat, located on the
extreme left of the orchestra
level underneath the first tier,
did not add to my enjoyment
ot the first half of the pro
gram. Arrau opened with the
Beethoven Sonata Seven in D,
op. 10, number three, a work
which combines the hope of
youth with elements which an
ticipate the unearthly stark
ness of the last four sonatas.
Arrau played with the cul
tivated tone and restraint that
has characterized his Beetho

ven performances in recent
years. The first movement was
perhaps too restrained, though
Arrau did succeed in accenting
the inner voices in the bass
that other artists so often
overlook. The program notes
written by the pianist speak of
the ability of Beethoven to
"catch at the throat with a
sudden twist of the minor key"
in this movement; Arrau's per
formance effectively carried
through this remark.
Bluntly stated, the second
movement, an extended largo
that prefigures the Romantic
movement, was a major disap
pointment. As is so often the
case in the late works of
Schubert, this movement sug
gests a sense of despair and loss
that is beyond tears, a bitter
declaration of smoldering
anger and a feeling of com
plete spiritual emptiness. Ar
rau's reading lacked the drama
and forward momentum neces
sary to give the score its full
emotional weight. As such, it
left me curiously earthbound
and unmoved.
The third movement,
marked Menuetto: Allegro,
was a welcome relief to the
lack of direction that preceded

it. Here. Arrau made effective
use of rhythm to bring to mind
the jaunty homeward journey
that concludes the Les Adieux
sonata. The fourth movement,
a rondo, came across as
subdued, quiet and subtle.
Arrau had originally in
tended to perform the Bee
thoven Sonata Number 32 in C
minor, op. 111, before the in
termission but at the last min
ute substituted a collection of
shorter works. His interpretive
difficulties with the earlier
sonata made me thankful that
he did not tackle the sprawling
architecture of op. 111, Bee
thoven's ultimate statement
for the keyboard.
The works of Schubert have
crept into Arrau's recorded
repertoire in recent years after
a long absence. On Sunday eve
ning. the pianist performed
Schubert's Klavierstucke Num
ber One. D. 946, a work which
follows the form of the more
famous Impromptus. Having
heard Maurizio Pollini play the
same work in the his last San
Francisco recital, 1 was struck
by the tonal richness in which
Arrau bathed the piece. The
earthiness and humanity that
Arrau brought forth from the
mid-range of his instrument
provided a definite contrast to
the cultured linearity of Pol
lini. On the whole, however,
Arrau's performance did lack
the degree of tempo inflection
and wit which the piece
demands.
Arrau proceeded to perform
a work undoubtedly close to his
heart, the Sonnet Number 104
of Petrarch by Franz Liszt.
Indeed, the pianist is among
the few living artists who can
rescue Liszt from the banality
of the Hungarian Rhapsody
Number Two. (The others are
Alfred Brendel. Sviatoslav
Richter and Vladimir
Horowitz.) Arrau's familiarity
with the Lisztian idiom un
doubtedly stems from the

background of his only teacher.
Martin Krause. who was him
self a pupil of the composer.
I he Petrarch Sonnet, perhaps
more than the famous Sonata
in B minor, reveals a deep spiri
tual composer and musical
technician who. in many
respects, anticipated the Im-

pressionist movement. To use
the pianist's own words, this is
"orgiastic" music; the textures
remind one of Wagner while
the emotional content of the
score suggests the act of love
itself. Arrau lavished the Son
net with a rapturous tone and
carefully built the Freudian
elements of the piece to a
shattering climax. D.H.
Lawrence would certainly have
approved. In sum, an awe
inspiring performance.
The program continued with
the Chopin Ballad Number
Three in A-flat. op. 47. 1 see
Chopin as the weakest element

of Arrau's repertoire. Given
the conviction that pervades
his readings of I is/t and
Schumann, one would expect
some ravishing Chopin playing
from Arrau yet. on record and
on Sunday evening, he per
formed the composer with a
distinct lack of direction. Ab-

sent was the sensuality implicit
in the Liszt sonnet and the
keen sense of structure that
appeared sporadically in the
Beethoven work. The chords
that appear at the beginning
of the work were curiously
subdued and the volcanic flurry
of octaves near the end seemed
little more than an errant
spark.
The first half of the concert
concluded with Lisle Joy ease
by Debussy. Like the quintes
sential Debussy pianist, Walter
Gieseking, Arrau emphasized
the underwater imagery of the
music. Indeed, the brilliant
hand coordination and tonal

control exhibited by Arrau in
the climax of the work brought
to mind the chromatic inten
sity of Monet's paintings from
Giverny.
The first portion of Arrau's
recital, technically and in
terpretively uneven at best,
did not prepare me for what
was to follow. The elderly
pianist walked cautiously
onstage after the intermission
to perform the Brahms Sonata
Number Three in F minor, op.
5. The acoustic veil that I
thought would remain through
the entire evening disappeared.
The emotional intensity only
hinted at earlier came through
with all the drive and im
petuousness of an artist half
the pianist's age. Arrau had hit
his stride and. believe me, the
effect was overwhelming.
In the program notes, the
pianist speaks of the piece as
"truly gigantic in spirit and
substance;" I can only add that
the sheer technical complexity
of the work struck me as the
product of a sophisticated mu
sical mind. Brahms composed
the Sonata, op. 5, at the ripe
age of 19. If anything, the
piece underscores the stylistic
changes that were to come in
Brahms' music. The Third
Sonata unexpectedly resembles
its great contemporary, the
Liszt Sonata in B minor. As
such, it draws upon all the tools
of a Romantic pianist: Blazing
power in the first and third
movements, digital dexterity
in the finale, the gradation of
pianissimo tone and control of
extended harmonic lines in the
second movement and the cal
culated use of rubato through
out. Although the work seems
particularly suited to the style
of a Horowitz or a Richter, it
has been comparatively ne
glected in the Romantic reper
toire.
The extended second
movement, marked Andante
espressivo, surely represented

the high point of the evening.
This section bears a poetic in
scription: "The evening
darkens in the moonlight
shines,/ There two hearts love
entwined/ Are in ecstasy bound
together." However, the
movement is not "romantic" in
the common sense of the word.
The unearthly, floating quality
of this movement brought to
mind that other l.iebesnacht,
Act II of Tristan unci Isolde.
The emotional climax of the
piece does not consist of sen
sual consummation but of un
quenchable yearning. At its
height, the sonata does not
speak of love or. for that mat
ter, of sexuality; like the dying
Tristan in Act 111 of Wagner's
opera, it screams to the night;
"Why? Why? Why?" This is the
essence of Romanticism and
the art of Claudio Arrau in
their most intense and compel
ling form.
Throughout the Brahms
Sonata. I found myself marvel
ing at the sheer physical phe
nomenon of Arrau performing
a work beyond the reach of
many professional pianists. On
a deeper level though, I felt a
profound sense of loss. Claudio
Arrau represents one of the
few remaining links to what
has been called the "golden
age" of pianists. In his oral
biography "Conversations with
Arrau." the pianist recalls his
experiences in Weimar Berlin
where he encountered such
pianistic legends as Paderewski,
Hofmann, Rachmaninoff and a
certain 20-year-old Russian vir
tuoso named Horowitz. Today,
the international piano com
petitions churn out homo
geneous performers who
merely play black notes on a
page and who see the 19th cen
tury as little more than a his
torical fact. Vladimir Horowitz
wil celebrate his 80th birthday
in October of this year.
Claudio Arrau turned SI earlier
this month.

the degree of tempo inflection
and wit which the piece
demands.
Arrau proceeded to perform
a work undoubtedly close to his
heart, the Sonnet Number 104
of Petrarch by Franz Liszt.
Indeed, the pianist is among
the few living artists who can
rescue Liszt from the banality
of the Hungarian Rhapsody
Number Two. (The others are
Alfred Brendel. Sviatoslav
Richter and Vladimir
Horowitz.) Arrau's familiarity
with the Lisztian idiom un
doubtedly stems from the

background of his only teacher.
Martin Krause. who was him
self a pupil of the composer.
I he Petrarch Sonnet, perhaps
more than the famous Sonata
in B minor, reveals a deep spiri
tual composer and musical
technician who. in many
respects, anticipated the Im-

pressionist movement. To use
the pianist's own words, this is
"orgiastic" music; the textures
remind one of Wagner while
the emotional content of the
score suggests the act of love
itself. Arrau lavished the Son
net with a rapturous tone and
carefully built the Freudian
elements of the piece to a
shattering climax. D.H.
Lawrence would certainly have
approved. In sum, an awe
inspiring performance.
The program continued with
the Chopin Ballad Number
Three in A-flat. op. 47. 1 see
Chopin as the weakest element

of Arrau's repertoire. Given
the conviction that pervades
his readings of I is/t and
Schumann, one would expect
some ravishing Chopin playing
from Arrau yet. on record and
on Sunday evening, he per
formed the composer with a
distinct lack of direction. Ab-

sent was the sensuality implicit
in the Liszt sonnet and the
keen sense of structure that
appeared sporadically in the
Beethoven work. The chords
that appear at the beginning
of the work were curiously
subdued and the volcanic flurry
of octaves near the end seemed
little more than an errant
spark.
The first half of the concert
concluded with Lisle Joy ease
by Debussy. Like the quintes
sential Debussy pianist, Walter
Gieseking, Arrau emphasized
the underwater imagery of the
music. Indeed, the brilliant
hand coordination and tonal

control exhibited by Arrau in
the climax of the work brought
to mind the chromatic inten
sity of Monet's paintings from
Giverny.
The first portion of Arrau's
recital, technically and in
terpretively uneven at best,
did not prepare me for what
was to follow. The elderly
pianist walked cautiously
onstage after the intermission
to perform the Brahms Sonata
Number Three in F minor, op.
5. The acoustic veil that I
thought would remain through
the entire evening disappeared.
The emotional intensity only
hinted at earlier came through
with all the drive and im
petuousness of an artist half
the pianist's age. Arrau had hit
his stride and. believe me, the
effect was overwhelming.
In the program notes, the
pianist speaks of the piece as
"truly gigantic in spirit and
substance;" I can only add that
the sheer technical complexity
of the work struck me as the
product of a sophisticated mu
sical mind. Brahms composed
the Sonata, op. 5, at the ripe
age of 19. If anything, the
piece underscores the stylistic
changes that were to come in
Brahms' music. The Third
Sonata unexpectedly resembles
its great contemporary, the
Liszt Sonata in B minor. As
such, it draws upon all the tools
of a Romantic pianist: Blazing
power in the first and third
movements, digital dexterity
in the finale, the gradation of
pianissimo tone and control of
extended harmonic lines in the
second movement and the cal
culated use of rubato through
out. Although the work seems
particularly suited to the style
of a Horowitz or a Richter, it
has been comparatively ne
glected in the Romantic reper
toire.
The extended second
movement, marked Andante
espressivo, surely represented

the high point of the evening.
This section bears a poetic in
scription: "The evening
darkens in the moonlight
shines,/ There two hearts love
entwined/ Are in ecstasy bound
together." However, the
movement is not "romantic" in
the common sense of the word.
The unearthly, floating quality
of this movement brought to
mind that other l.iebesnacht,
Act II of Tristan unci Isolde.
The emotional climax of the
piece does not consist of sen
sual consummation but of un
quenchable yearning. At its
height, the sonata does not
speak of love or. for that mat
ter, of sexuality; like the dying
Tristan in Act 111 of Wagner's
opera, it screams to the night;
"Why? Why? Why?" This is the
essence of Romanticism and
the art of Claudio Arrau in
their most intense and compel
ling form.
Throughout the Brahms
Sonata. I found myself marvel
ing at the sheer physical phe
nomenon of Arrau performing
a work beyond the reach of
many professional pianists. On
a deeper level though, I felt a
profound sense of loss. Claudio
Arrau represents one of the
few remaining links to what
has been called the "golden
age" of pianists. In his oral
biography "Conversations with
Arrau." the pianist recalls his
experiences in Weimar Berlin
where he encountered such
pianistic legends as Paderewski,
Hofmann, Rachmaninoff and a
certain 20-year-old Russian vir
tuoso named Horowitz. Today,
the international piano com
petitions churn out homo
geneous performers who
merely play black notes on a
page and who see the 19th cen
tury as little more than a his
torical fact. Vladimir Horowitz
wil celebrate his 80th birthday
in October of this year.
Claudio Arrau turned SI earlier
this month.



Claudio Arrau
Chilean pianist Claudio Ar
rau gave ample proof of his
stature as one of the most dis
tinguished keyboard artists of
the present day in his recital on
Sunda\ evening in Davies Sym
phony Hall. For the second
consecutive season, Arrau dem
onstrated that the world has
not yet lost touch with the
great musical traditions of the
last century, yet the pianist si
multaneously reminded me of
how precarious and fleeting
that familiarity may become in
the future.
The evening did not begin
auspiciously, however. The
muffled, bass-deficient acous
tics of my seat, located on the
extreme left of the orchestra
level underneath the first tier,
did not add to my enjoyment
ot the first half of the pro
gram. Arrau opened with the
Beethoven Sonata Seven in D,
op. 10, number three, a work
which combines the hope of
youth with elements which an
ticipate the unearthly stark
ness of the last four sonatas.
Arrau played with the cul
tivated tone and restraint that
has characterized his Beetho

ven performances in recent
years. The first movement was
perhaps too restrained, though
Arrau did succeed in accenting
the inner voices in the bass
that other artists so often
overlook. The program notes
written by the pianist speak of
the ability of Beethoven to
"catch at the throat with a
sudden twist of the minor key"
in this movement; Arrau's per
formance effectively carried
through this remark.
Bluntly stated, the second
movement, an extended largo
that prefigures the Romantic
movement, was a major disap
pointment. As is so often the
case in the late works of
Schubert, this movement sug
gests a sense of despair and loss
that is beyond tears, a bitter
declaration of smoldering
anger and a feeling of com
plete spiritual emptiness. Ar
rau's reading lacked the drama
and forward momentum neces
sary to give the score its full
emotional weight. As such, it
left me curiously earthbound
and unmoved.
The third movement,
marked Menuetto: Allegro,
was a welcome relief to the
lack of direction that preceded

it. Here. Arrau made effective
use of rhythm to bring to mind
the jaunty homeward journey
that concludes the Les Adieux
sonata. The fourth movement,
a rondo, came across as
subdued, quiet and subtle.
Arrau had originally in
tended to perform the Bee
thoven Sonata Number 32 in C
minor, op. 111, before the in
termission but at the last min
ute substituted a collection of
shorter works. His interpretive
difficulties with the earlier
sonata made me thankful that
he did not tackle the sprawling
architecture of op. 111, Bee
thoven's ultimate statement
for the keyboard.
The works of Schubert have
crept into Arrau's recorded
repertoire in recent years after
a long absence. On Sunday eve
ning. the pianist performed
Schubert's Klavierstucke Num
ber One. D. 946, a work which
follows the form of the more
famous Impromptus. Having
heard Maurizio Pollini play the
same work in the his last San
Francisco recital, 1 was struck
by the tonal richness in which
Arrau bathed the piece. The
earthiness and humanity that
Arrau brought forth from the
mid-range of his instrument
provided a definite contrast to
the cultured linearity of Pol
lini. On the whole, however,
Arrau's performance did lack
the degree of tempo inflection
and wit which the piece
demands.
Arrau proceeded to perform
a work undoubtedly close to his
heart, the Sonnet Number 104
of Petrarch by Franz Liszt.
Indeed, the pianist is among
the few living artists who can

power in the first and third
movements, digital dexterity
in the finale, the gradation of
pianissimo tone and control of
extended harmonic lines in the
second movement and the cal
culated use of rubato through
out. Although the work seems
particularly suited to the style
of a Horowitz or a Richter, it
has been comparatively ne
glected in the Romantic reper
toire.
The extended second
movement, marked Andante
espressivo, surely represented

the high point of the evening.
This section bears a poetic in
scription: "The evening
darkens in the moonlight
shines,/ There two hearts love
entwined/ Are in ecstasy bound
together." However, the
movement is not "romantic" in
the common sense of the word.
The unearthly, floating quality
of this movement brought to
mind that other l.iebesnacht,
Act II of Tristan unci Isolde.
The emotional climax of the
piece does not consist of sen
sual consummation but of un
quenchable yearning. At its
height, the sonata does not
speak of love or. for that mat
ter, of sexuality; like the dying
Tristan in Act 111 of Wagner's
opera, it screams to the night;
"Why? Why? Why?" This is the
essence of Romanticism and
the art of Claudio Arrau in
their most intense and compel
ling form.
Throughout the Brahms
Sonata. I found myself marvel
ing at the sheer physical phe
nomenon of Arrau performing
a work beyond the reach of
many professional pianists. On
a deeper level though, I felt a
profound sense of loss. Claudio
Arrau represents one of the
few remaining links to what
has been called the "golden
age" of pianists. In his oral
biography "Conversations with
Arrau." the pianist recalls his
experiences in Weimar Berlin
where he encountered such
pianistic legends as Paderewski,
Hofmann, Rachmaninoff and a
certain 20-year-old Russian vir
tuoso named Horowitz. Today,
the international piano com
petitions churn out homo
geneous performers who
merely play black notes on a
page and who see the 19th cen
tury as little more than a his
torical fact. Vladimir Horowitz
wil celebrate his 80th birthday
in October of this year.
Claudio Arrau turned SI earlier
this month.
