# 1 out of 2 imbibe once a week
## Survey reveals drinking levels 
### PATRICK McCRYSTLE 
One out of every two Stanford students drinks alco
hol at least once a week, and an additional one out of
10 students drinks even more often, according to the
recently released results of a campus-wide survey.
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, head of Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS), last spring surveyed the
drinking habits of 600 students. The survey sample was
adjusted for present University percentages of class
status, race and sex.
The bulk of the questions of the survey asked how of
ten students drank and how much they drank at each oc
casion.
The survey determined that graduate students usually
drink three to seven times a week. In addition, the
average undergraduate will down three to five — and
possibly even more — drinks per occasion, according to
the survey.
Students said they drank for the taste, to relieve
stress, to lose inhibitions and to obtain the physical ef
fect caused by a great deal of alcohol.
D'Andrea said an environment in which alcohol is the
only major social activity is physically and mentally un
healthy. He added that he thinks Stanford has such an
environment.
"People who are feeling the stress of school do not
have sufficient alternatives for letting off steam,"
D'Andrea said.
According to D'Andrea, this dependence on alcohol
could cause long-term problems.
"Ten percent of everyone who drinks regularly will
become alcoholics, and those with a family history of
problems have a 20 percent chance," he said. "Students
who are drinking mainly to relieve stress or to be social
are in an unhealthy position that will cause drinking
problems."
Nevertheless, D'Andrea said the drinking problem

here hasn't reached "epidemic proportions."
"There is an alarmist atmosphere in some circles that
says drinking among students has reached epidemic pro
portions, but that is not true," he said. "Yet, when the
only major activities are alcohol-related, drinking
becomes a problem."
According to the survey, the average undergraduate
goes to one or two parties a week and drinks a great deal.
Even the 24 percent who drink only once or twice a
month say they drink three to five drinks per occasion.
Robin Hensley, assistant program director for Resi
dential Education, said that Res Ed is not alarmed by
the survey. Instead, Hensley said there is a a major in
crease in alcohol awareness this year, due in large part to
the work of the resident assistants (RAs).
The RAs have attempted to educate students about
alcohol policy and to make them responsible drinkers.
Hensley said she thinks that Residential Education's de
emphasis on alcohol has improved the student drinking
situation.
"Our alcohol policy is that there must be equally at
tractive non-alcoholic alternatives in equal numbers at
all parties, and no parties can have alcohol be the focus,"
she said.
"This year there is an increased awareness that we
hope over time will educate everyone," Hensley contin
ued. "What we want is responsible, educated students
who can make decisions without being stigmatized."
Although alcohol policy is often berated and non
alcoholic alternatives are the source of many jokes,
Hensley said Res Ed remains undaunted.
The department will still continue its firm insistence
on non-alcoholic alternatives for campus parties, even
though the survey showed that 100 percent of those
who drink more than five drinks per occasion and 80 per
cent of those who drink from three to five are not af
fected by non-alcoholic alternatives.
