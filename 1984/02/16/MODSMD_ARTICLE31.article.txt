Ihe United States' "grand
design" for its future focuses on
technology, whereas Austria's
design concentrates on society, an
Austrian official said in a speech
in Cubberley Auditorium yester
day.
Austrian State Secretary
Ernest Eugen Veselsky stressed
the need for active innovation in
the social field.
"You can't affect the past and
can only moderately influence the
present," he said, "so the future is
really the only place where change
can be induced."
For this reason, his Social Dem
ocratic Party has been dedicated
to a future-oriented perspective
since the early 19605, Veselsky
said.
According to Veselsky, party
members have tried to come up
with consensus decisions based
mainly on the technique of
qualitatively and quantitatively
forecasting problematic national

issues.
This system of combining short
and long-term forecasting, ex
trapolation. model-building and
population sampling has helped
Austria to emerge as a growing
welfare state, Veselsky said.
"But the difference is that
we're a welfare state using con
sensus policies," he said. "We
decided that confrontation
should not be allowed to take
place any more, so therefore we
must find a consensus."
Veselsky, a lawyer and econo
mist by education, has also served
as a politician, parliamentarian,
planner and theoretician. A self
described "left-wing man," he
made the transition from being a
judge several years ago in order
"to do something for the people."
Veselsky is now president of the
Austrian Association for Future
Policies and the official spokes
man in Parliament for the Social
Democratic Party, in addition to
his role as state secretary.

The Austrian Association for
Future Policies, founded in 1974,
specializes in long-term forecast
ing. According to Veselsky. the as
sociation believes that in order
for Austria to survive,
"tremendous changes must take
place."
In 1976. the association pub
lished Austria IVH5, a bestseller
that forecast many economic and
political trends, both national and
international, with extreme ac
curacy.
Through precise forecasting,
the group's aim is to develop ben
eficial national policies.
"The social policies of govern
ment shouldn't try to answer
questions of yesterday," Veselsky
said, "but should try to survive in
the future."
Veselsky's speech was sponsored
by the Stanford International
Development Education Commit
tee. He is visiting Stanford on a
honeymoon trip with his wife of
three weeks. Barbara.
