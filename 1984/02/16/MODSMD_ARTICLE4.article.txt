# Draft law forces hard choices
## 
### DUN GIFFORD, JR 
In recent months a number of stu
dents here have been faced with a
tough dilemma: Is their opposition
to registering for the draft worth
more than their federal student aid?
These students have found two
ways of tackling the problem: not
registering and receiving University
money instead of government funds
or registering and seeking federal as
sistance.
The choice has been generated by
the Solomon Amendment, a law
tacked on the 1982 Selective Service
Act stipulating that students receiv
ing federal student aid must declare
that they have registered with the
Selective Service.
The amendment was ruled uncon
stitutional last March by a federal

court in Minnesota and the case is
expected to be heard this spring in
the U.S. Supreme Court. In the
meantime, the Justice Department
has had the ruling blocked on the
grounds that it interferes with na
tional security.
According to Roberta Johnson, as
sistant director of financial aids
here, between 10 and 20 financial aid
recipients have not registered for the
draft and given up their federal aid.
The University, in keeping with its
"need blind" admissions policy, has
provided compensation for those
students who decide not to register
by offering student loans, but at in
terest rates higher than the govern
ment's.
Lawrence Hughes, an undeclared
sophomore, had been receiving a

Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL)
from the federal government that
covered 30 percent of his tuition.
But he refused to sign the agreement
saying that he had registered, and
therefore made himself ineligible for
government aid.
"If the University had not com
pensated this I'd have to reconsider."
he said, "ft would have been a threat
if J had known that the aid was going
to have been cut off."
According to John Althoff, finan
cial aid assistant, the University
loans are to be paid back at a 5 per
cent interest rate while the student
is in school and a 9 percent rate after
graduation. GSLs, in contrast, charge
no interest while the student is in
school and 7 percent after gradua
tion.
For sophomore Andrew Shields;
who also did not register, this differ
ence in interest pay-hacks was
enough to forego the University loan
he might have received after giving
up his federal aid.
"I could not afford to pay a Uni
versity loan," he said. "And it would
have been difficult to sign the
amendment." He said his parents
have absorbed the difference.
Shields' aid package had been
prepared with the federal money,
but he elected not to sign the agree
ment and not receive the money.
Shields considers the amendment

"classist because it does not effect
those who are not getting aid."
A student who wished to remain
anonymous said he has actually
received the federal money without
signing the agreement. He has since
signed the agreement but has not
registered. He calls the amendment
"a farce."
"I think that you should sign the
amendment without registering," he
said. He said he was aware of a "large
number of people who have perjured
themselves."
He said the law is a "totally uncon
stitutional amendment" that
practices "punishment before trial
and self-incrimination."
If apprehended, he said, "It's going
to mess things up in a real important
part of my life."

Andrew Palmer, a junior who has
been stopped out of school since the
amendment became implemented,
did not agree. "I won't sign it unless
I've registered," he said. "It's a crimi
nal offense."
Palmer, whose federal grants were
paying for a third of his tuition, will
have to decide whether to sign the
agreement this month. "I don't know
if I'll sign it," he said. "I would not
register if it were not for the
Solomon Amendment."
A sophomore who wished to
remain anonymous said the Univer
sity made it "very easy" for him to
get a University loan to replace the
federal funds he lost by not register
ing. "It's an expensive loan," he said,
"but I'm having trouble paying for
school these days."
