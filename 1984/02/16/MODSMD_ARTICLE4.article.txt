# Draft law forces hard choices
## 
### DUN GIFFORD, JR 
In recent months a number of stu
dents here have been faced with a
tough dilemma: Is their opposition
to registering for the draft worth
more than their federal student aid?
These students have found two
ways of tackling the problem: not
registering and receiving University
money instead of government funds
or registering and seeking federal as
sistance.
The choice has been generated by
the Solomon Amendment, a law
tacked on the 1982 Selective Service
Act stipulating that students receiv
ing federal student aid must declare
that they have registered with the
Selective Service.
The amendment was ruled uncon
stitutional last March by a federal

court in Minnesota and the case is
expected to be heard this spring in
the U.S. Supreme Court. In the
meantime, the Justice Department
has had the ruling blocked on the
grounds that it interferes with na
tional security.
According to Roberta Johnson, as
sistant director of financial aids
here, between 10 and 20 financial aid
recipients have not registered for the
draft and given up their federal aid.
The University, in keeping with its
"need blind" admissions policy, has
provided compensation for those
students who decide not to register
by offering student loans, but at in
terest rates higher than the govern
ment's.
Lawrence Hughes, an undeclared
sophomore, had been receiving a

Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL)
from the federal government that
covered 30 percent of his tuition.
But he refused to sign the agreement
saying that he had registered, and
therefore made himself ineligible for
government aid.
"If the University had not com
pensated this I'd have to reconsider."
he said, "ft would have been a threat
if J had known that the aid was going
to have been cut off."
According to John Althoff, finan
cial aid assistant, the University
loans are to be paid back at a 5 per
cent interest rate while the student
is in school and a 9 percent rate after
graduation. GSLs, in contrast, charge
no interest while the student is in
