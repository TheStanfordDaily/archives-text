# Faculty split on U.S. UNESCO withdrawal
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
Stanford faculty and students arc divided on
the Reagan administration's planned withdrawl of
the United States from the United Nations Edu
cational. Social and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO).
Education Prof. Hans Weiler said UNESCO has
been a valuable organization for communication
and exchange between the major powers and devel
oping nations.
From 1974 to 1 77. Weiler was director of the
UNESCO-affiliated International Institute for
Educational Planning in Paris.
"We don't need UNESCO to collaborate with
Great Britian." Weiler said. "It is particularly

along North-South lines that UNESCO has proved
to be a very valuable instrument of communica
tion and collaboration. And it you are as rich and
as endowed with professional talent as this
country is. then it is immoral to keep it to your
self.'" '
However, Arnold Beichman, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution, said the United States'
withdrawl is long overdue.
"UNESCO has been the most political of organ
izations." said Beichman. a former United Nations
correspondent. "You have a very serious problem
with such international organizations as the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the Interna
tional Labor Organization (ll.O). They have
become politicized."

Last month, the Reagan administration
declared its intention to withdraw the United
States from UNESCO by the end of the year. Ad
ministration officials said UNESCO is hostile to
the United States, the free market and freedom
of the press.
Weiler said the Reagan administration's charges
are distortions.
"One could argue that quite a few of the politi
cal problems the United States has in UNESCO
are of its own making," he said. "When we talk
about the anti-Western bias of UNESCO there is
a bit of a specious element because we are talking
about an anti-Western bias in the rest of the
world. We are focusing on UNESCO
because that is the easiest one to
hit,"
Press organizations in America and
Western Europe have criticized
UNESCO's call for a New World
information Order as an attempt
by UNESCO to control interna
tional journalism.
The concept, formulated in the
late 19705, calls for greater control
over the flow of information by
Third World countries.
UNESCO's calls for a New World
Information Order have been misun
derstood. Weiler said.
"Nobody denies that there is a tre
mendous monopoly in the collection
and dissemination of news in the
world," he said. "About 85 percent
of all the news on the wires belongs
to the five major Western news or
ganizations: United Press Interna
tional, the Associated Press,
Reuters, Agence France Presse and
the German organization. That is a
pretty heavy monopoly."
Weiler acknowledged that some of

UNESCO's rhetoric about the free
press has not been constructive.
"The rhetoric that has surrounded
the New World Information Order
has been unnecessarily belligerent,"
he said. "The rhetoric has failed to
emphasize the real issues."
Despite some excesses. UNESCO
provides important educational and
cultural services. Weiler said.
UNESCO has conducted literacy
campaigns and helped to restore im
portant monuments around the
world, he said.
Beichman said the United States'
intention to leave UNESCO could
force the organization to return to
its mission and avoid political tirades.
In the mid-19705, the AFL-CIO
was able to force the 11.0 to return
to its mission of supporting indepen
dent trade unions after the labor
union said it planned to leave the or
ganization. he said.
"The planned withdrawl of the
United States from UNESCO is in
no way a blow to UNESCO's
future," Beichman said. ' It may en
courage UNESCO to go back to its
charter."
UNESCO has tried to meddle in
the political systems of democratic
countries by calling for a New World

Information Order, he said.
"This idea will prevent people from
learning about the affairs of their
own country." Beichman said. "It
says that only if the government ap
proves can you publish. It would in
terfere with the freedom to buy a
news service."
UNESCO and many other interna
tional organizations will continue to
have political problems because they
are made up of countries with funda
mentally different political
philosophies, he said.
"An organization like UNESCO
must concern itself with moral prob
lems." Beichman said. "It is very dif
ficult to establish agreement among
countries whose reigning political
philosophies are so opposed to each
other."
But if the countries in UNESCO
agree to stop trying to interfere
with the United States' internal af
fairs. UNESCO could function as a
forum for discussion, he said.
Communication Prof. Elie Abel, a
former U.S. delegate to UNESCO,
said the United States should stay in
UNESCO.
"Some of the criticism of UN
ESCO is misplaced and overdrawn."
Abel said.

Weiler acknowledged that some of

UNESCO's rhetoric about the free
press has not been constructive.
"The rhetoric that has surrounded
the New World Information Order
has been unnecessarily belligerent,"
he said. "The rhetoric has failed to
emphasize the real issues."
Despite some excesses. UNESCO
provides important educational and
cultural services. Weiler said.
UNESCO has conducted literacy
campaigns and helped to restore im
portant monuments around the
world, he said.
Beichman said the United States'
intention to leave UNESCO could
force the organization to return to
its mission and avoid political tirades.
In the mid-19705, the AFL-CIO
was able to force the 11.0 to return
to its mission of supporting indepen
dent trade unions after the labor
union said it planned to leave the or
ganization. he said.
"The planned withdrawl of the
United States from UNESCO is in
no way a blow to UNESCO's
future," Beichman said. ' It may en
courage UNESCO to go back to its
charter."
UNESCO has tried to meddle in
the political systems of democratic
countries by calling for a New World

Information Order, he said.
"This idea will prevent people from
learning about the affairs of their
own country." Beichman said. "It
says that only if the government ap
proves can you publish. It would in
terfere with the freedom to buy a
news service."
UNESCO and many other interna
tional organizations will continue to
have political problems because they
are made up of countries with funda
mentally different political
philosophies, he said.
"An organization like UNESCO
must concern itself with moral prob
lems." Beichman said. "It is very dif
ficult to establish agreement among
countries whose reigning political
philosophies are so opposed to each
other."
But if the countries in UNESCO
agree to stop trying to interfere
with the United States' internal af
fairs. UNESCO could function as a
forum for discussion, he said.
Communication Prof. Elie Abel, a
former U.S. delegate to UNESCO,
said the United States should stay in
UNESCO.
"Some of the criticism of UN
ESCO is misplaced and overdrawn."
Abel said.
