Marines will stay on ships
Washington — President Reagan said yesterday that he is
prepared to keep Marines stationed on ships off Beirut for
another 14 months — the time they had been authorized by
Congress to remain on shore — as long as their presence pro
vides a psychological boost for the Lebanese government.
"The length of stay will be determined by what happens
and whether we succeed or not. And it will be no different
in length than it would be if they stayed in their positions
on shore," said Reagan, who announced Feb. 7 that the ap
proximately 1,200 U.S. Marines based at Beirut airport
would be withdrawn in stages to Navy ships.
"As long as there is a chance for peace, we're going to
stay there. That's what our original mission was," Reagan
said.
"I don't know what we could have done differently," he
said. "Our search was for peace, and 1 think we were right in
doing that. If that is to be denied, if they cannot bring
about that peace there. 1 don't have any regret about our
having tried. It was a legitimate effort.
"It was all we could do. What would be the alternative?
Going to war with a country like Syria? No, I don't think
that's an answer, either," the president said.
Gunmen kill U.S. director
of multinational Sinai force
Rome — Leamon "Ray" Hunt, the American director
general of the multinational force in the Sinai Peninsula
that separates Egypt and Israel, was shot to death last
night by two gunmen outside his home in suburban Rome.
The 56-year-old Hunt, a retired senior American
diplomat, was ambushed as he sat in the back seat of his
armor-plated Alfa Romeo car when his Italian driver pulled
up outside his residence.
Dr. Franco Sirleo, chief of the Italian anti-terrorist
police, said two men opened up with automatic weapons on
the car's bullet-resistant rear window as it halted at Hunt's
house. Sirleo said there were few witnesses and no clear des
criptions of the gunmen.
He said Hunt's driver, who was not hurt, rushed the
severely wounded American to nearby Sant Eugenio Hospi
tal. Hunt was transferred almost immediately to a larger
hospital, San Giovanni, where he died about an hour later.
A doctor there said Hunt had been shot in the head.
An organization that identified itself as the Partito
Communista Combattente (Fighting Communist Party)
claimed responsibility for the shooting in a telephone call to
a private radio station in Milan.
Bush interested in U.N. force
Paris — After meeting with French and Italian leaders.
Vice President George Bush yesterday said the United
States was "very interested" in a French proposal to replace
the multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut with U.N.
troops but left it unclear whether Washington would be
prepared to meet Kremlin demands for a pullback of the
6th Fleet.
At a news conference here before flying back to Wash
ington at the end of a five-nation European tour that took
him to Moscow for the funeral of Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov. Bush said the role of the multinational force
hud been"the principal concern" in his talks in Komc and
Paris. Significant differences of approach have emerged
among the three countries following President Reagan's an
nouncement last week of the "redeployment" of the U.S.
Marines to ships offshore and the unilateral withdrawal of
the small British contingent.
After a meeting between Bush and Italian Prime Mini
ster Bettino Craxi, Italy yesterday announced that the
"greater part" of the 1,400-man Italian contingent would
be withdrawn from Beirut in two weeks.
Reagan downplays deficit
Washington — President Reagan said yesterday that he
does not regard the federal budget deficit as a serious
threat to the economic recovery or as a cause of today's
high interest rates.
"But that doesn't mean that I don't take the debt
seriously." Reagan said during a breakfast meeting with
reporters. He pledged to work for lower deficits, although
he ruled out defense spending cuts and increases in tax
rates.
Reagan's remarks did not sit well with congressional
Democrats, who have held the first of a series of meetings
with Reagan administration officials aimed at negotiating
a deficit-reduction package. The Democrats have insisted
that defense spending cuts form the agenda of the next,
still-unscheduled negotiating session.
"Reducing the deficit is painful." said Christopher Mat
thews, press assistant to House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) "The American people are not going to
accept the pain without the president's telling them that it
is necessary."
Mondale may have it locked
Washington — Last June 11, Walter Mondale experienced
his worst moment as a contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination, when he was upset by Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) in the Wisconsin Democratic conven
tion straw vote.
Mondale's defeat in the htairt of his liberal Midwestern
base encouraged hopes among all his challengers that his
support might be fragile.
Last Tuesday, Mondale returned to Milwaukee to be
greeted by the news that nine of the often-feuding top
leaders of the state Democratic Party, including the sitting
governor and his two Democratic predecessors, had joined in
endorsing him. One of the endorsers, former Gov. Martin
Schreiber, pulled aside a reporter and told him something
that is heard with increasing frequency on the Democratic
presidential trail these days.
"It's all over but the shouting," Schreiber said.
Not a vote has been cast in the Democratic contest, but
the opinion polls and the patter of Democratic politicians
are increasingly portraying the Minnesotan as the all-but
inevitable nominee.
Remembering Wisconsin, Mondale's camp nervously
rejects that notion. They discount polls like Tuesday's New
Hampshire survey showing him 21 points ahead of Sen. John
Glenn (D-Ohio), or yesterday's Chicago Sun-Times poll,
showing him 35 points up on Glenn and Jesse Jackson in Illi
nois.
Stock Market finishes mixed
New York — The stock market finished mixed yesterday,
yielding to some late selling amid forecasts of higher inter

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 5
points in early trading, was down 5.13 at 1,158.71 by the
close.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange reached 94.87
million shares, up from 91.80 million Tuesday.

on shore," said Reagan, who announced Feb. 7 that the ap
proximately 1,200 U.S. Marines based at Beirut airport
would be withdrawn in stages to Navy ships.
"As long as there is a chance for peace, we're going to
stay there. That's what our original mission was," Reagan
said.
"I don't know what we could have done differently," he
said. "Our search was for peace, and 1 think we were right in
doing that. If that is to be denied, if they cannot bring
about that peace there. 1 don't have any regret about our
having tried. It was a legitimate effort.
"It was all we could do. What would be the alternative?
Going to war with a country like Syria? No, I don't think
that's an answer, either," the president said.
Gunmen kill U.S. director
of multinational Sinai force
Rome — Leamon "Ray" Hunt, the American director
general of the multinational force in the Sinai Peninsula
that separates Egypt and Israel, was shot to death last
night by two gunmen outside his home in suburban Rome.
The 56-year-old Hunt, a retired senior American
diplomat, was ambushed as he sat in the back seat of his
armor-plated Alfa Romeo car when his Italian driver pulled
up outside his residence.
Dr. Franco Sirleo, chief of the Italian anti-terrorist
police, said two men opened up with automatic weapons on
the car's bullet-resistant rear window as it halted at Hunt's
house. Sirleo said there were few witnesses and no clear des
criptions of the gunmen.
He said Hunt's driver, who was not hurt, rushed the
severely wounded American to nearby Sant Eugenio Hospi
tal. Hunt was transferred almost immediately to a larger
hospital, San Giovanni, where he died about an hour later.
A doctor there said Hunt had been shot in the head.
An organization that identified itself as the Partito
Communista Combattente (Fighting Communist Party)
claimed responsibility for the shooting in a telephone call to
a private radio station in Milan.
Bush interested in U.N. force
Paris — After meeting with French and Italian leaders.
Vice President George Bush yesterday said the United
States was "very interested" in a French proposal to replace
the multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut with U.N.
troops but left it unclear whether Washington would be
prepared to meet Kremlin demands for a pullback of the
6th Fleet.
At a news conference here before flying back to Wash
ington at the end of a five-nation European tour that took
him to Moscow for the funeral of Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov. Bush said the role of the multinational force
hud been"the principal concern" in his talks in Komc and
Paris. Significant differences of approach have emerged
among the three countries following President Reagan's an
nouncement last week of the "redeployment" of the U.S.
Marines to ships offshore and the unilateral withdrawal of
the small British contingent.
After a meeting between Bush and Italian Prime Mini
ster Bettino Craxi, Italy yesterday announced that the
"greater part" of the 1,400-man Italian contingent would
be withdrawn from Beirut in two weeks.
Reagan downplays deficit
Washington — President Reagan said yesterday that he
does not regard the federal budget deficit as a serious
threat to the economic recovery or as a cause of today's
high interest rates.
"But that doesn't mean that I don't take the debt
seriously." Reagan said during a breakfast meeting with
reporters. He pledged to work for lower deficits, although
he ruled out defense spending cuts and increases in tax
rates.
Reagan's remarks did not sit well with congressional
Democrats, who have held the first of a series of meetings
with Reagan administration officials aimed at negotiating
a deficit-reduction package. The Democrats have insisted
that defense spending cuts form the agenda of the next,
still-unscheduled negotiating session.
"Reducing the deficit is painful." said Christopher Mat
thews, press assistant to House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) "The American people are not going to
accept the pain without the president's telling them that it
is necessary."
Mondale may have it locked
Washington — Last June 11, Walter Mondale experienced
his worst moment as a contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination, when he was upset by Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) in the Wisconsin Democratic conven
tion straw vote.
Mondale's defeat in the htairt of his liberal Midwestern
base encouraged hopes among all his challengers that his
support might be fragile.
Last Tuesday, Mondale returned to Milwaukee to be
greeted by the news that nine of the often-feuding top
leaders of the state Democratic Party, including the sitting
governor and his two Democratic predecessors, had joined in
endorsing him. One of the endorsers, former Gov. Martin
Schreiber, pulled aside a reporter and told him something
that is heard with increasing frequency on the Democratic
presidential trail these days.
"It's all over but the shouting," Schreiber said.
Not a vote has been cast in the Democratic contest, but
the opinion polls and the patter of Democratic politicians
are increasingly portraying the Minnesotan as the all-but
inevitable nominee.
Remembering Wisconsin, Mondale's camp nervously
rejects that notion. They discount polls like Tuesday's New
Hampshire survey showing him 21 points ahead of Sen. John
Glenn (D-Ohio), or yesterday's Chicago Sun-Times poll,
showing him 35 points up on Glenn and Jesse Jackson in Illi
nois.

Marines will stay on ships
Washington — President Reagan said yesterday that he is
prepared to keep Marines stationed on ships off Beirut for
another 14 months — the time they had been authorized by
Congress to remain on shore — as long as their presence pro
vides a psychological boost for the Lebanese government.
"The length of stay will be determined by what happens
and whether we succeed or not. And it will be no different
in length than it would be if they stayed in their positions
on shore," said Reagan, who announced Feb. 7 that the ap
proximately 1,200 U.S. Marines based at Beirut airport
would be withdrawn in stages to Navy ships.
"As long as there is a chance for peace, we're going to
