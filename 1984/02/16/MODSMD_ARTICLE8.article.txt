From the Los Angeles Times
khalde, Lebanon — Jubilant Druse militiamen yes
terday consolidated their control ot the coastal area
they captured Tuesday from the shattered Lebanese
army, and there was widespread speculation in Beirut
that President Amin Gemayel was on the verge ot
canceling Lebanon's troop-withdrawal agreement
with Israel.
Druse fighters here fired their machine guns into
the air to celebrate after dealing the army its second
major defeat in little more than a week by driving the
government's 4th Brigade out of the nearby moun
tains and taking this key crossroads on the main coas
tal highway. The Beirut airport, where U.S. Marines
are stationed, is less than 200 yards from Khalde.
The capture of the Khalde junction gave the
militiamen control not only of the coast road leading
to southern Lebanon but also of routes into the
mountains important to the rebels as supply lines.
The militiamen manning the checkpoint at Khalde

said no government troops were there when they
arrived, having tied before the Druse advance.
As a result of Tuesday's Druse sweep from the
mountains to the sea. the U.S. Marines stationed at
the airport are surrounded hy rebel militiamen. I he
Marines were on alert yesterday but they carried on
with their preparations to leave Lebanon, possibly
within the next month. Helicopters and landing eral l
were used throughout the day to shuttle equipment
to ships of the 6th Fleet just offshore.
Militiamen of the Shia Moslem militia had set up
checkpoints on the coast road just to the west ot the
Marines' position, but no difficulty was reported as
the Marines passed back and forth to the shore
loading the landing craft.
U.S. Army Col. Ed McDonald, a spokesman tor the
American peacekeeping contingent, said that while
the militia victory had "raised some concern and is
being watched closely" by the Marines, there was no
shooting at the American compound during the bat

tie between the Lebanese army and the rebels.
There was no indication yesterday that the
militiamen plan any attack on the Marines, even
thouuh U.S. na\al gunfire has been used repeatedly
against artillerv positions in the nearby mountains in
support of the Lebanese army. The mountains are the
traditional territory of the Syrian-supported Druse,
who have been battling the army there.
The armv's defeat by the Druse, who were aided by
Ama I militiamen in the last stages of Tuesday's fight,
ing. deepens the difficulties ot the beleaguered
Gemayel government at a time when the president is
desperately, and belatedly, trying to initiate political
reforms that might allow him to hang on to the
presidency •
Reports in the Lebanese press said yesterday that
Gemavel was about to abrogate the troop
withdrawal agreement, signed with Israel last May 17.
