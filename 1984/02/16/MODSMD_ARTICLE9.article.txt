From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — Lebanese President
Amin Gemayel yesterday accepted an
eight-point plan that includes his agree
ment to abrogate the Lebanese-Israeli
peace accord of last May 17 in exchange
for his opponents permitting him to
stay in office. U.S. officials and
diplomatic sources said last night.
According to the sources, Gemayel,
whose hold on power has been endan
gered by the crumbling of the Lebanese
army, yesterday informed Reginald
Bartholomew, the U.S. ambassador in
Beirut, of his decision to go ahead even
though Israel has threatened to con
tinue indefinitely its occupation of
southern Lebanon if the peace accord is
scrapped.

President Reagan and Secretary of
State George Shultz said yesterday
that the United States will continue
supporting Gemayel if he abrogates the
U.S.-mediated agreement. But they ap
peared to contradict each other about
whether the administration approves
of Gemayel's move.
Shult/. who worked out the peace ac
cord m intensive shuttle diplomacy last
spring, said the United States con
tinues to support it and warned:
"Those who would dispense with this
agreement must bear the responsibility
to find alternative formulas for Israeli
withdrawal."
However, when Reagan was asked
what he thought of Lebanon abrogat

ing the agreement, he replied. "We re
not a party to it. so there's no way we
should have a position one way or the
other on whether it is abrogated or
not."
U.S. officials were especially skepti
cal of the success of the Saudi
sponsored plan it its acceptance
depends on the idea that Israel will
withdraw. However, the diplomatic
sources said they believed that the
"package deal" acceptance called for by
Gemayel and Saudi Arabia applies only
to Syria and the dissident Druse. Sunni
and Shiite Moslems and Christian fac
tions within Lebanon.
The sources said the plan calls for a
succession of steps beginning with a

cease-fire among the Lebanese factions
and institution of security arrange
ments to prevent further fighting
That would be followed by a reconven
ing of the Geneva negotiations to
create a broadened new government in
which Gemayel would have to share
power with the other factions.
The new government would abrogate
the May agreement and offer new talks
with Israel to "•guarantee" the Jewish
state's northern border against attack
from Lebanon. However, the sources
said, any security arrangement must
satisfy Syria's demand that it not imply
Lebanese recognition of Israel or give
the Jewish state political or economic
advantages in Lebanon.
