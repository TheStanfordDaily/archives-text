Mesquite. It isn't an insect It isn't
\a consciousness-raising dmg. It's a
special kind of charcoal that gives our
ribs a very special flavor. And what works on
our ribs works on other things: Gulf Shrimp,
Marinated Game Hen, and Dry-Aged Steaks.
Come to Mac Arthur Park. Try a dish
from our mesquite charcoal broiler, and
taste the flavor that sticks MACARTHUR
to our ribs. PARK
