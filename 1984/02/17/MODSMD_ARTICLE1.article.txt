# Commoner endorses Jackson
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
Environmentalist Barry Com
moner said yesterday that only
Democratic presidential can
didate Jesse Jackson offers an al
ternative to the "moral beliefs"
that underlie the policies of the
Reagan administration.
"Jesse Jackson is in the ring
with Reagan and nobody else is,"
Commoner told 50 people at
Kresge Auditorium. "Jackson's
campaign is explicitly based on a
moral assumption that the inter
ests of this country are best
served if we attend to the needs
of the poor, the powerless and the
disenfranchised."
Commoner, who was the Citi
zen's Party candidate for presi
dent in 1980, has been
campaigning for Jackson in New
Hampshire. Chapters of the Citi
zen's Party, which Commoner
founded, have endorsed Jackson's
candidacy.
Citing recent polls which
showed Jackson as the second

most popular Democratic can
didate, Commoner said Jackson
has developed a growing following.
"Jackson is showing that people
are ready to listen to this kind of
direct moral confrontation with
Reagan," he said.
Commoner added that Jackson

could greatly help the Democratic
Party even if he does not win the
nomination.
"For the last couple of years
Jackson has spent an awful lot of
time registering blacks for the

presidential nomination.
vote." he said. '"In 1980 Reagan was
elected by only 27 percent of the
population. A small increase in the
number of registered voters would be
enough to defeat Reagan in the next
election."
Jackson is unalterably opposed to
the principles that shape Reagan's
policies. Commoner said.
"Reagan has two fundamental
beliefs. .. which are that the interest
of this country is best served by
having the rich get richer and that in
dealing with countries we disagree
with we should use force and the
threat of force." he said.
These beliefs have led Reagan to
gut federal programs that help the
poor and protect the environment,
according to Commoner.
"I think there is one issue in this
election and that is to repudiate and
defeat Ronald Reagan." he said.

Reagan's foreign policy is danger
ous because it has led to unprece
dented uses of military might.
Commoner added.
"He has brought us to the point
where the battleship U.S.S. New Jer
sey last week dropped bombs in
Lebanon that are larger than the ex
plosive tonnage dropped on Hiros
hima," he commented.
Commoner claimed that Jackson's
campaign strategy counters Reagan's
conservative policies by unifying the
philosophies of the civil rights, wo
men's liberation, environmentalist
and peace movements.
"The other Democratic candidates
simply aren't capable of opposing
Reagan." he said. "The leading candi
dates share some of Reagan's basic
positions."
Commoner. a 66-year-old
biologist, has been a liberal political
activist for more than 30 years. He is
director of the Center for the Biol
ogy of Natural Systems at Queens
College in New York.
