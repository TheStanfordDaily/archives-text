# Inside
## Carmel: everything you ever wanted...and more 
### CAMERON KALLER 
You have a three-day
weekend staring you in the
face and are not yet sure what
to do about it. It's raining in
Tahoe, you don't have very
much money, or maybe you just
haven't thought of anything
that sounds really appealing.
Well, don't despair, for not too
far away is Carmel.
With a little care, Carmel
need not turn out to be an
overly expensive weekend. You
can run your feet in the sand
tree of charge, or run on the
greens where the Crosby Golf

Tournament took place not
more than a month ago.
You can truly "get away
from it all" and still have a lot
to see and do in Carmel-by
the-Sea.
Whatever you want to do,
Carmel most likely has the
facilities for you to do it: The
beach in Carmel is world
famous, sailing is popular and

of course, one can golf. Some
of the world's best courses
overlooking the sea are in Car
mel and Pebble Beach. Your
other options include opportu
nities to go whale watching or
to art galleries or a variety of
shops, and for those of you
"few" who might happen to
enjoy fine food, Carmel also
has more than its share of ex
cellent restaurants.
And to think that this
charming little escape is only an
hour and a half away from
Stanford. Sound intriguing?

First things first: where to
stay. Since sleeping is probably
not high on your list of reasons
for going to Carmel, it would
make sense to find the most
reasonably priced accommoda
tions possible.
My suggestions are to either
stay with a lucky person that
lives there or to drive back
north a few miles (no more

than 10 minutes or so) to Mon
terey or Seaside. Prices there
would be about two-thirds less
than if you were to stay in
downtown Carmel. The
cheapest type of hotels or
motels are of the average
Motel-6 style ($l6-30). Not
glamourous or romantic, just
the inexpensive kind that you
could never find in Carmel
proper, where lodging begins at
$35 per night.
All right, you have dumped
your luggage off, and want to
go out and do something. If
you have already taken a morn-

ing swim (Brrrrr, chilly but
refreshing) on Carmel Beach,
you might hear that the area
just south of Carmel has one
of the best diving and snorkel
ing spots on the California
coast. You can rent equipment
for such activities in the
Aquarius Dive Shop in Monter
ey.
If this sounds like too much

physical exertion, a milder ac
tivity such as a nature walk
through beautiful Point l.obos
is a not-to-be-missed experi
ence. There are groups that
meet in downtown Carmel
which provide transport to the
Big Sur/Ventana wilderness
area for Sierra Club walks at a
minimal rate.
If you have a car, I would en
courage going to Ventana fnn
to simply relax and enjoy the
sweeping oceanside atmo
sphere. The Inn is about 45
minutes south on Highway 1,
and the drive is quite scenic.
Once you are at the inn, you
will discover that it has a won
derful restaurant. Reserva
tions are a good idea, but if you
have to wait for a table, you
can't ask for more than to
lounge on the wooden terrace
overlooking the pounding
ocean below and sip away at an
exotic drink. It is generally
warm and sunny in the Ventana
area.
You say you like shopping?
Carmel has every form and kind
of shopping you could ever
hope to encounter. There is a
rustic style shopping center
called The Barnyard, the well
known Carmel Plaza, The
Crossroads, as well as many
little alley-ways you might find
yourself walking into in the
heart of the town. Simply wan
dering up and down Ocean Av
enue will keep anyone occupied
for several timeless hours.
Another nice aspect of "the
streets of Carmel" is that you
can find an art gallery on vir
tually every corner, from local
artist shops such as The Village
Artistry to galleries which
carry major 19th century works
as does The Galerie de Tours.
For those of you looking for
a little more adventure, con
vince someone to let you crew
for them around Stillwater

Cove or at Fisherman's Wharf.
Also at the Wharf are
several places to set out for
whale watching, fishing and
glass-bottomed boat trips. All
recommend reservations.
Now for the truly vital in
formation: where to eat. The
hands-down best breakfast
cafe in the area is called Katie's
Place. It's definitely one of the
local "digs," and it would be a
shame to miss. It is simple and
inexpensive, but scrumptious.
An exceptionally good lunch
place is inside of a huge, ranch
style bookstore called The
Thunderbird in The Barnyard.
The restaurant is also reason
ably priced and the meals have
a delightfully fresh quality.
One last eatery is Clint
Eastwood's famed Hog's
Breath restaurant. A great
venture for lunch and evening

drinks, but not as palatable for
dinner, I'm afraid. And it is
doubtful that you will see
Clint himself.
For the more expensive
palates. The Marquis, in the
middle of town, produces an
exquisite French lunch , and a
favorite of Carmelites for din
ner is Casanova's. Another fun
place is Robata's Sake Grill
which serves very tasteful
Japanese food and drink, and it
has a teriffic atmosphere.
Last but not least, after you
have washed the sand out of
your hair, pounded your feet
on the sidewalks,
photographed the Big Sur
coastline and eaten like never
before, it's time to party. This
category, I'm afraid, does not
encompass an overly-large se
lection. The Olde Monterey
Music Hall frequently has jazz

performances and sometimes a
rock show or two with provi
sions for dancing. More dancing
can be found at The Club in
Monterey. An I.D. is required.
Latitude 36 at the mouth of
Carmel Valley also has music
and dancing on weekends.
There is certainly more than
enough to keep you busy in
Carmel and within the entire
peninsula. The hardest part of
a weekend will be having to
choose between what to do and
what you will have to skip by
virtue of the time factor. Not
everyone who goes to Carmel
cares, though, whether he
gets to do everything he in
tended to or not. When recall
ing his Carmel excursion, the
most vivid memory might simp
ly be a breezy, moonlit stroll in
the invitingly cool and soft
sand. Enjoy!

enue will keep anyone occupied
for several timeless hours.
Another nice aspect of "the
streets of Carmel" is that you
can find an art gallery on vir
tually every corner, from local
artist shops such as The Village
Artistry to galleries which
carry major 19th century works
as does The Galerie de Tours.
For those of you looking for
a little more adventure, con
vince someone to let you crew
for them around Stillwater

Cove or at Fisherman's Wharf.
Also at the Wharf are
several places to set out for
whale watching, fishing and
glass-bottomed boat trips. All
recommend reservations.
Now for the truly vital in
formation: where to eat. The
hands-down best breakfast
cafe in the area is called Katie's
Place. It's definitely one of the
local "digs," and it would be a
shame to miss. It is simple and
inexpensive, but scrumptious.
An exceptionally good lunch
place is inside of a huge, ranch
style bookstore called The
Thunderbird in The Barnyard.
The restaurant is also reason
ably priced and the meals have
a delightfully fresh quality.
One last eatery is Clint
Eastwood's famed Hog's
Breath restaurant. A great
venture for lunch and evening

drinks, but not as palatable for
dinner, I'm afraid. And it is
doubtful that you will see
Clint himself.
For the more expensive
palates. The Marquis, in the
middle of town, produces an
exquisite French lunch , and a
favorite of Carmelites for din
ner is Casanova's. Another fun
place is Robata's Sake Grill
which serves very tasteful
Japanese food and drink, and it
has a teriffic atmosphere.
Last but not least, after you
have washed the sand out of
your hair, pounded your feet
on the sidewalks,
photographed the Big Sur
coastline and eaten like never
before, it's time to party. This
category, I'm afraid, does not
encompass an overly-large se
lection. The Olde Monterey
Music Hall frequently has jazz

performances and sometimes a
rock show or two with provi
sions for dancing. More dancing
can be found at The Club in
Monterey. An I.D. is required.
Latitude 36 at the mouth of
Carmel Valley also has music
and dancing on weekends.
There is certainly more than
enough to keep you busy in
Carmel and within the entire
peninsula. The hardest part of
a weekend will be having to
choose between what to do and
what you will have to skip by
virtue of the time factor. Not
everyone who goes to Carmel
cares, though, whether he
gets to do everything he in
tended to or not. When recall
ing his Carmel excursion, the
most vivid memory might simp
ly be a breezy, moonlit stroll in
the invitingly cool and soft
sand. Enjoy!

Carmel's beaches, surrounded by tall pines, are world-famous.

You have a three-day
weekend staring you in the
face and are not yet sure what
to do about it. It's raining in
Tahoe, you don't have very
much money, or maybe you just
haven't thought of anything
that sounds really appealing.
Well, don't despair, for not too
far away is Carmel.
With a little care, Carmel
need not turn out to be an
overly expensive weekend. You
can run your feet in the sand
tree of charge, or run on the
greens where the Crosby Golf

Tournament took place not
more than a month ago.
You can truly "get away
from it all" and still have a lot
to see and do in Carmel-by
the-Sea.
Whatever you want to do,
Carmel most likely has the
facilities for you to do it: The
beach in Carmel is world
famous, sailing is popular and

of course, one can golf. Some
of the world's best courses
overlooking the sea are in Car
mel and Pebble Beach. Your
other options include opportu
nities to go whale watching or
to art galleries or a variety of
shops, and for those of you
"few" who might happen to
enjoy fine food, Carmel also
has more than its share of ex
cellent restaurants.
And to think that this
charming little escape is only an
hour and a half away from
Stanford. Sound intriguing?

First things first: where to
stay. Since sleeping is probably
not high on your list of reasons
for going to Carmel, it would
make sense to find the most
reasonably priced accommoda
tions possible.
My suggestions are to either
stay with a lucky person that
lives there or to drive back
north a few miles (no more

than 10 minutes or so) to Mon
terey or Seaside. Prices there
would be about two-thirds less
than if you were to stay in
downtown Carmel. The
cheapest type of hotels or
motels are of the average
Motel-6 style ($l6-30). Not
glamourous or romantic, just
the inexpensive kind that you
could never find in Carmel
proper, where lodging begins at
$35 per night.
All right, you have dumped
your luggage off, and want to
go out and do something. If
you have already taken a morn-

ing swim (Brrrrr, chilly but
refreshing) on Carmel Beach,
you might hear that the area
just south of Carmel has one
of the best diving and snorkel
ing spots on the California
coast. You can rent equipment
for such activities in the
Aquarius Dive Shop in Monter
ey.
If this sounds like too much

physical exertion, a milder ac
tivity such as a nature walk
through beautiful Point l.obos
is a not-to-be-missed experi
ence. There are groups that
meet in downtown Carmel
which provide transport to the
Big Sur/Ventana wilderness
area for Sierra Club walks at a
minimal rate.
If you have a car, I would en
courage going to Ventana fnn
to simply relax and enjoy the
sweeping oceanside atmo
sphere. The Inn is about 45
minutes south on Highway 1,
and the drive is quite scenic.
Once you are at the inn, you
will discover that it has a won
derful restaurant. Reserva
tions are a good idea, but if you
have to wait for a table, you
can't ask for more than to
lounge on the wooden terrace
overlooking the pounding
ocean below and sip away at an
exotic drink. It is generally
warm and sunny in the Ventana
area.
You say you like shopping?
Carmel has every form and kind
of shopping you could ever
hope to encounter. There is a
rustic style shopping center
called The Barnyard, the well
known Carmel Plaza, The
Crossroads, as well as many
little alley-ways you might find
yourself walking into in the
heart of the town. Simply wan
dering up and down Ocean Av
enue will keep anyone occupied
for several timeless hours.
