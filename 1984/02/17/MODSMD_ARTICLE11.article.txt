## The 						Stanford Daily Drinking law a bad idea 
### 
Last week the House Energy and Commerce
Committee members decided it was high time
to do something about the great number of
young drivers killed in alcohol-related highway
accidents. They decided by voice vote to ap
prove a national drinking age of 21 to supersede
any state laws.
Currently California and 18 other states have
a drinking age of 21, and others range from 18
to 20.
There is no doubt that drunk driving and the
needless deaths it causes are inexcusable. Half
of all highway deaths are a result of drunk
driving, and a substantial share of those deaths
do involve teenage drivers.
But the point is that the legislation, which
passed the committee stage and now must go
before the full House, is not the best way to
deal with the situation. Drunk driving is the
problem here — not necessarily the drinking
habits of only those under 21.
Groups like Mothers Against Drunk Drivers
(MADD) have rallied support among legislators,
including the bill's sponsor. Democratic Rep.
James Florio of New Jersey. Local Democratic

Rep. Tom Lantos has also been leading the way
for a national 21 drinking age as part of his com
prehensive Highway Safety bill which has yet to
come out of the Energy and Commerce Com
mittee. As Lantos says,"The slaughter on the
highway must stop."
But if Florio, Lantos or MADD really wants
to do something about the drunk driver, then
they should urge legislators to stiffen drunk
driving laws. And many states have been doing
so already. That's good.
What's not good is when a House committee
decides that interfering with state laws and re
stricting the actions of only one certain seg
ment of legal adults is the answer to a much
more widespread problem.
The concern here should be with drinking and
driving, not just with drinking, and certainly not
just with the drinking habits of 18-, 19- and 20-
year-olds. Legislators should only create laws
which are necessary to achieving the aims they
seek. In that regard, a national drinking age of
21 is ill-advised. A $5000 fine for selling alcohol
to anyone under 21 will not stop drunk driving.
Stiffer drunk driving fines might.
