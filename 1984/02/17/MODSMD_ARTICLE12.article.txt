## Midterm remedy unacceptable 
### 
I have just lived through what will
go down as the worst test experi
ence of my life. At this moment, I
hold this university in very low es
teem. For those of you who do not
know. 50 students, including myself,
were forced to take a test we never
saw. The History Department failed
to run off a sufficient number of
History 2 midterms.
This oversight in and of itself is
reproachable enough, but the
"solution" was unfair and annoying.
The midterm was then read aloud,
consuming 10 minutes of the test
time. During this period, those who
had been in the majority were
allowed to work on the questions
they had received. In order to com
pensate for the time we spent un
derstanding the question, the exam
period was extended for five
minutes for all students.
Hie time disparity between the
"haves" and "have nots" was not
the only handicap in this exam. The
students without copies of the test
had the added anxiety of having to
finish more quickly, the worry of
not knowing the specifics of the
questions, and the inability to care
fully consider their choice of essay.
1 realize that this problem is in
the past and cannot be corrected. 1
also see the difficulty in finding an
equitable solution. Setting perfor
mance of these 50 students aside, I

hope to see some action taken on
this matter so that a mistake of
such inexcusable stupidity doesn't
happen again.
The students, their parents and
the government pay an incredible
sum of money for a Stanford educa
tion. It is reprehensible that in cases
such as this we are cheated of the
quality we deserve. 1 am certain that
the History Department regrets this
error, and I realize that "people
make mistakes." This, to a point, is
forgivable. Yet, the unbroken string
of errors that occurred is not for
givable.
I hope that appropriate steps are
taken on this matter.

DoD funding
1 was pleased to see the opinions
of John Harris and Prof. John
McCarthy regarding military-funded
research published in the Feb. 10
issue of The Daily. In view of the
proposed increase in the military
research budget and the expressed
interest of the Department of
Defense (DoD) in expanding its
support of scientific and engineering
research at U.S. universities, I feel
that members of the Stanford
research community cannot afford
to ignore this issue.
The channeling of the major share

of the research funds of some de
partments at Stanford (Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science)
through the DoD should be of spe
cial concern to the engineering
graduate student. I am, like many
other graduate students who strive
to develop innovative ways of utiliz
ing science and technology to bene
fit society, ashamed of my
profession's strong support of a
wasteful military establishment.
Nonmilitary-related employment
opportunities for engineering
graduates have already become
scarce commodities, and now it
seems that military exploitation of
basic research in this area will rise
rapidly in the near future after
nearly a decade of steady increase.
I urge every Stanford student to
examine the role of the military in
his/her research. Are you satisfied
with the long-term goals of the
agency which support* ytmr worfc?
Are these goals consistent with a
more peaceful, humane world? If
not, what can be done to remedy
the situation? Perhaps by answering
these questions, we can begin to
recognize the personal and moral
responsibility for promoting con
structive applications of the tech
nological advances which result from
our work.
