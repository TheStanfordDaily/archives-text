# Racial oppression still among us
## 
### 
Sunday, the National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People (NAACP) began
its 75th year. For many, the NAACP means
little, and its anniversary means less. However,
whether one chooses to celebrate or mourn its
longevity, the NAACP has already altered Amer
ican domestic policy and will continue in the bat
tic for equality as long as the race war lasts.
The 1954 decision which made segregation
illegal, the ensuing Civil Rights Act, the Voting
Rights Act. affirmative action and quotas were
major contests and eventual victories for the
NAACP. These victories created and defined the
now traditional use of court decisions and
legislative pressure as major weapons against ra
cial discrimination. But two catastrophic events
have occurred since those victories: The racial war
is no longer conventional and it is now an appar
ent fact that racial malevolence cannot be
legislated away.
Racism is now covert. No longer is it fash
ionable to board up restaurants after the style
of Lester Maddox. Nor is it prudent to physically
block campus doorways as George Wallace did.
Little signs shouting "White Only" have long ago
been removed.
But now. instead of signs or barriers, subtle
forms of racism slap minorities across the face
daily. For example, in classes in which I am the
sole minority, the seat next to me is usually the
last seat taken; even though 1 am not especially
repulsive. Also, when Afro-Americans or
Mexican-Americans approach bus stops, even
Marguerite stops, some white patrons find it
necessary to move as far away from the stop as

possible, until the bus comes. The everyday at
tacks are insulting and piercing. No one knows
when an attack approaches.
The great court victories for racial justice can
not kill the beast. During the civil rights move
ment, the belief spread that once minorities ac
quired their just rights, life would be free of
extra hassles simply because one had dark skin.
Somehow, we thought prejudice and hatred could
be regulated and brought before a judge just as
fervently as discrimination. The mistake of this
belief lies in the fact that racial prejudice and ra
cial discrimination are neither inseparable nor
synonomous. The former is a feeling, intangible,
while discrimination feeds on hatred.
Discrimination in employment faces every
minority when he or she searches for a job. Af
firmative action and quota guidelines could not
force every employer to hire qualified minorities.
And now that the quota system is being
abandoned, the people who only hired qualified
minorities because of fear of legal action will
find no need to maintain their "fairness." Before
affirmative action and quotas, highly qualified
minorities could not find employment commen
surate to their skills. Without the quotas, many
skilled minorities may not have a hope in this un
liberated land.
But creating jobs and owning businesses is the
key for minorities and all of America. As the
NAACP has stated, "the answer is an educated
electorate." People voting and choosing officials
with conscience can and will be the salvation of
this nation, if indeed this nation is to be saved.
The fate of minorities and that of the majority

form a volatile bond. If that fusion is ever com
pletely broken, revolution will follow, not an
other civil rights "movement." Revolution is
bloody, destructive and unstoppable until one
side wins or until both sides lose.
The fight that created this country had
minority as well as white soldiers. So why do so
many Americans believe black and white destinies
are so opposite? The first blacks in Jamestown
were a mixture of free men and indentured ser
vants, just as the white settlers were. We must
wake up and work for the common good.
1 do not favor revolution. But I also refuse to
live under oppression or amid discrimination. Too
many injustices are still heaped upon the heads of
minorities and the poor. Nothing is "equal' in
this country. Minorities are still twice as likely to
receive capital punishment tor killing a white
man than a white man is for killing someone
black. I can still walk into a zoo in many northern
cities and grab more attention than all the
animals in cages. I can still walk through neigh
borhoods in St. Louis and have people throw
trash at me. Little 12-year-old black boys still
have the opportunity to be harassed and fired on
by police because they may have stolen a bike. We
Americans, all Americans, had better wake up.
Stop pretending that we have no problem.
Revolution approaches quickly if we refuse to
pull together. Sit back and relax if you wish. But
just as undetected cancer spreads as latally as
cancer under the doctor's eye; denied racism will
bring us all down, whether we believe it or not.
