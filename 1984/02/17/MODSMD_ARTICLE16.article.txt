## Hiring quotas: revenge not an issue 
### 
Oh, how the majority wails when
its domination is threatened. Jason
Matherly, in his column (Daily, Feb.
9). asserts that racial quotas were
not only designed to help minorities,
but to retaliate against the majority
for its historic actions. This seems
to be another case of the unthinking
conservative only looking at one side
of the issue — his — the majority's.
Matherly says that by using a large
application pool and training, the ra-

cial inequities in our society can he
eliminated. This is, in his own words,
"baloney."
He says that a large application
pool would help by giving minorities a
chance to apply for jobs, thus in
creasing the hiring of minorities.
Well, there is a big difference in
being able to apply and having a real
"chance" at the job. Sure more
minorities can apply, but what is
their chance against the majority ap
plicants? Not very good. They have
not been trained for the upper level

jobs and thus cannot compete with
the majority applicants, who have
been programmed and trained from
birth that those jobs belong.to the
majority.
Matherly would now just say,
"Well, train them then." 1 wonder
just how loudly he would yell that
this too, training minorities and not
majorities, was discrimination.
While Matherly may be right in his
assessment that majorities may
encounter more of a hindrance under
quotas, he is dead wrong in feeling
that these quotas are simply
retributive. He seems to have a great
fear that someone is out to get the
majorities and trample them. This
idea of retribution is, again,
"baloney."
Quotas were designed to provide
minorities with job opportunities.
Thus, if minorities could get a foot
hold in a job market other than the
lower-class job market, they could
establish a more equitable balance in
the business world, and this balance
would be self-sustaining. It is clear
that quotas were not meant as an

"end" in themselves. They were only
a means to the end of an egalitarian
society.
Obviously the Civil Rights Act of
1964, and our Constitution, do
declare that "all men are created
equal." However, just because the
law says two groups are equal does
not make it so. Of course, the
majority would like nothing better
than to believe it does. This would
preserve their status quo of domina
tion, just as Jim Crow laws did
decades ago. One cannot ignore the
years of oppression and say, with a
stroke of the pen, that all are equal.
If one group has been socialized for
generations into a subordinate class
and nothing is provided to change
that process, the class will inevitably
remain subordinate. Matherly seems
as bent on keeping his majority
dominations as did the pigs in Or
well's "Animal Farm": "All animals
are created equal, but some animals
are more equal than others."
