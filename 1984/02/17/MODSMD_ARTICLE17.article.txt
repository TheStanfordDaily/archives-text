## Give Reagan complex to Madera 
### 
In response to the continuing controversy over the
Reagan library, one new and refreshingly rational pro
posal has come to light. The residents of Madera House,
""Vi '■frekftman dnrmftory in Wilbur Hall, have offered their
foyer and lounge as a site for the future Reagan library
(and possibly, museum).
The proposal, possibly endorsed by the Reagan admin
istration, was given "some heavy thought" according to
house president Steve Singleton, before unanimous ap
proval by the enthusiastic Maderans.

VIEWPOINT

Singleton has already formed a special ad hoc task
force to consider the logistics of the proposal. "I think
we'll need to widen the existing doorway between the
foyer and the lounge to enable crowds to flow smoothly
between the two rooms," one task force member ob
served.
The Reagan administration has been especially
receptive to the Madera site. Presidential counselor Ed
Meese is reported to have remarked, "Such a scenario
would be expedient to the present library objectives
with respect to our position considering the phaseout of
positive, popular support for the linkage with the
Hoover Institution."
Although Mr. Meese's comments have not yet been
translated, anonymous administration sources report
that "he likes the idea." Further sources admit that the
recent proposal "is the only, the best alternative."
Signals from the Stanford leadership are also favor
able. When asked for the official University position on
the "Madera" proposal. University President Donald
Kennedy unofficially replied, "Oh, I don't care where
they put it as long as I get to run it." Most University

officials, however, had never heard of the "Madera" pro
posal and refused to comment.
The major contention concerning the Madera/Reagan
library has comc from within Madcni House itsolf There
is some uneasiness that a Reagan library in the lounge
might result in a loss of privacy lor, and a general
squelching of, the Madera residents. Says one Maderan,
"I like President Reagan and all, but I don't know if I
want all of his stuff cluttering up the lounge. Where
would we play ping-pong?" Another resident stated,
"We already have like six libraries don't we? Why do we
need another one?"
An integral part of the dorm, the resident assistants,
are generally excited about the prospect. Stated one
RA, "What could be better than to say on my resume
that I baby-sat a bunch of freshmen and the Reagan li
brary."
Some Maderans, citing the main activity of Stanford
students in libraries, objected to the inevitability ot
total strangers sleeping in their lounge. "It would be
really gross to have all those frat guys sacking out in our
dorm," exclaimed a perturbed Maderan.
Furthermore, many Maderans express some fear that
Madera might become a theme house for librarians. "A
bunch of book fanatics reciting the Dewey decimal sys
tem is not how we want people to think of our dorm. It's
just kind of, uh . . . well, y'know ..." said one Madera
social committee member.
In all, the "Madera" proposal has been greeted with
surprising popularity among the top-ranking officials in
both the White House and Stanford. But Singleton has
announced that a final decision cannot be feasibly
reached until after the congressional elections for fear
of "adverse political implications."

men living in Madera.)
