# Advertising at core of Apple plan

### BEN PAGE 
When it comes to advertising in
today's market, it's the "big event"
that does the job best, says the presi
dent and chief executive officer of
the Silicon Valley success story â€”
Apple Computer.
, "Big events can be more effective
than any sort of conventional ad
campaign" in marketing a product,
according to Apple's John Sculley.
Sculley, former president of Pepsico,
spoke to a full house at Bishop
/\uili(orium yesterdiiy.
As an example of such an "event"
Scully screened Apple's "19X4" com
mercial for the new Macintosh per
sonal computer. The advertisement
features rows of Orwellian zombies
staring glassy-eyed at a projected Big
Brother figure until a lone woman
with a hammer destroys the screen.
"It cost $400,000 for us to air
that commercial during the Super
Bowl," Sculley explained, "but that
night on the evening news we got
free advertisements from ABC,
NBC and CBS," and numerous local
stations also ran stories on the com
mercial. Partially as a result of such
publicity, Sculley said, there are long
lines of people waiting to see the
Macintosh in many stores, even
though the product is only 30 days
old.
In a tongue-in-cheek manner Scul
ley denied the advertisement had any
connection with Apple's giant com
petitor IBM. "We simply were res
ponding to the idea that computers
can be used to control people's lives,
as in "1984," and pointing out that
computers can help individuals. Any
other possible interpretations are
purely unintentional," he claimed.
Despite this recent marketing
splash, Sculley said his main priority
at Apple has been product line strat
egy. "Although Apple has a history
of being very innovative, it hasn't
had a real product success since the
Apple II," he explained.
Sculley explained changing product
strategy. "I've learned that you
shouldn't try to take on No. 1.
You should target for growth areas,
for emerging markets." he explained.
One growth area Apple has tried to
take advantage of is the college mar
ket. It has offered package deals on
the Macintosh with up to 60 percent
discounts to a group of 24 univer
sities, including Stanford. "As a
result, we already had $60 million in
orders for the Macintosh when it was
introduced," Sculley said.
Sculley cited the Lisa computer as
an example of a technological tri
umph that was a business disaster.
The Macintosh and a new line ot Ap
ple II accessories are part ot an el
fort by Apple to recoup the losses
that Lisa incurred. Sculley said that
he has told investors that Apple will
be "back on track" by 1985.
Apple's general advertising strat
egy is to "try to make sure we don't
get lost in the herd." Sculley ex
plained. "No. 1 and No. 2
are what people remember, like
Coke and Pepsi or Hertz and Avis.
People tend to think of the comput
er industry as IBM and the other
traditional companies on one side,
and Apple on the other, and we want
to exploit that," he added.
Sculley stressed Apple s non
traditional aspects to the largely
