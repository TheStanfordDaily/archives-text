## Card plays giveaway, but wins 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
And the beat goes on.
"Beat," as in Stanford
beating USC. 64-56, last night
in Maples Pavilion. "Beat," as in
Stanford beating its last six
straight Pacific-10 Conference
opponents. And "beat," as in
Stanford beating the odds and
probably going to its first
post-season tournament in 42
years.
"We're getting close (to a
post-season tournament bid),"

said Stanford Coach Tom
Davis, whose Cardinal team im
proved its record to 17-8 over
all and 6-6 in the Pac-10.
"Seventeen wins is getting
there. There have been teams
in the NIT (National Invita
tional Tournament) with 15
wins. So every game past that
gets us that much closer."
Last night's game, however,
was much closer than it could
have been,
Stanford gave a textbook
demonstration on how to lose a

l()-point halftime lead in the
early moments of the second
half. Minutes later, however, it
showed 5034 fans in Maples
Pavilion exactly how to get it
back.
Or rather, seniors Keith
Jones and John Revelli showed
them how. The pair of All-
America candidates took mat
ters into their own hands with
10:48 to play after a 33-23
halftime lead had evaporated
to 38-36.
Jones — who led all scorers
with 20 points — and Revelli
— who grabbed a game-high
nine rebounds — scored Stan
ford's next 12 points between
them in a span of 4:10, while
USC countered with only two.
The Cardinal had its biggest
lead of the evening at 50-38
with 6:38 remaining and the
Trojans were history.
"That's the sign of really
fine ballplayers," Davis said of
Jones' and Revelli's 12-point
run. "Keith Jones and John
Revelli have been doing that all
year."
USC did pull to within four
on three occasions in the
closing minutes, cutting Stan
lord leads to 54-50, 58-54 and
finally 60-56 with 0:20 to go.
But the Card hit the free
throws it had to down the
stretch and Jones added a lay
in at the buzzer to give it the
final eight-point margin.
"I was proud of the way we
got back into it," said USC
Coach Stan Morrison of his
team, which dropped to 9-16
overall and 4-8 in the Pac-10.
"But I thought we made
several 'young' kind of errors."
Ten players on the 15-man
Trojan roster are either fresh
men or sophomores.
USC got back into it by
scoring nine of the first 1 1
points in the second half and

cutting Stanford's lead to 35-
34. Cardinal guard Keith
Ramee was then called for an
offensive foul and the Trojans
had a chance to take their first
lead since they held a 2-0 ad
vantage.
Stanford, however, got the
ball back and seconds later tor
ward Andy Fischer was fouled
and made one of two free
throws. Trojan point guard
Larry Friend hit a short jumper
to tie it at 36-all with 12:24 to
play. Fischer then scored off an
offensive rebound to put the
Card ahead 38-36. After that,
it was all Jones and Revelli.
"Tom Davis is doing a great
job of getting his team
prepared." Morrison contin
ued. "I said last week that
Stanford could very well be 9-2
in the conference. Stanford
should be proud of fellows like
Keith Jones and John Revelli.
They are class guys and they do
a super job."
Statistically, the game was
virtually even. The Card shot
46.7 percent (21-for-45) from
the floor and the Trojans a
slightly worse 43.1 percent (22-
for-51). Stanford had 30
rebounds and USC 24. Stan
ford had 16 turnovers and USC
14.
But it was the Card's
second-half free-throw shoot
ing that made the difference,
especially in the late going.
USC, the No. 1 free throw
shooting team in the Pac-10,
netted 1 2-of-14 attempts
from the line. Stanford,
though, proved that in this
case quantity is more impor
tant than quality and hit 22-
of-28 (78.9 percent).
One Card player who didn't
make his free throws was
Ramee, the late-game hero in


Greg Webb/Daily
Senior center John Revelli scores two of his 15 points against
the Trojans. Revelli's total gave him 1503 for his career as he
continues his chase of Stanford all-time leaders Claude Terry
(1566) and Kimberly Belton (1615).
last Friday's 62-51 victory over
UC-Berkeley when he went 12-
for-12 from the line, l ast
night he was 4-for-7, missing
three front ends of one-and
ones in the final 2:4 ( J of the
game.
"I think Keith had such a
good game up at Cal," Davis
explained, "that you tend to
relax a little bit and think
you've got everything solved."
Besides free throwing, an
other key to the victory was
Stanford's ability to shut down
Trojan forward Wayne
Carlander, who finished with
10 points — well below his
team-leadiny average of 16.5.

" We had trouble getting the
hall to Carlander," Morrison
said. "Stanford did a good joh
of zeroing in on Wayne in the
final 10 minutes. We just
couldn't get the hall to him
enough."
Two of those Trojan players
Stanford sagged off were
Glenn Smith and Ron Holmes,
who led USC with 15 points
apiece. Most of their scoring
came in the second half, when
Smith tallied 10 and Holmes 13
of their final point totals.
USC was playing without
five players, including two
centers. Starting center
Clayton Olivier underwent sur
gery for bone spurs in his left
foot yesterday and back-up
center Derrick Dowell was in
Indiana attending funeral

services for his father.
But Morrison's biggest loss
was 6-foot-7 senior forward
Cedric Bailey, who was tested
for pneumonia yesterday in Los
Angeles. "It's obvious they
aren't at full strength without
Bailey," he .said. "He's the only
senior on the team and he pro
vides them with needed leader
ship."
C ard notes
Revelli eclipsed the 1500-
point mark last night, as his 15
points gave him a total of 1503
career points. He is presently
third on the all-time scoring
list behind Kimberly Belton
(1615) and Claude Terry
(1566) and needs to average
1K.67 points in Stanford's last
six games to move into first
place.

" We had trouble getting the
hall to Carlander," Morrison
said. "Stanford did a good joh
of zeroing in on Wayne in the
final 10 minutes. We just
couldn't get the hall to him
enough."
Two of those Trojan players
Stanford sagged off were
Glenn Smith and Ron Holmes,
who led USC with 15 points
apiece. Most of their scoring
came in the second half, when
Smith tallied 10 and Holmes 13
of their final point totals.
USC was playing without
five players, including two
centers. Starting center
Clayton Olivier underwent sur
gery for bone spurs in his left
foot yesterday and back-up
center Derrick Dowell was in
Indiana attending funeral

services for his father.
But Morrison's biggest loss
was 6-foot-7 senior forward
Cedric Bailey, who was tested
for pneumonia yesterday in Los
Angeles. "It's obvious they
aren't at full strength without
Bailey," he .said. "He's the only
senior on the team and he pro
vides them with needed leader
ship."
C ard notes
Revelli eclipsed the 1500-
point mark last night, as his 15
points gave him a total of 1503
career points. He is presently
third on the all-time scoring
list behind Kimberly Belton
(1615) and Claude Terry
(1566) and needs to average
1K.67 points in Stanford's last
six games to move into first
place.

And the beat goes on.
"Beat," as in Stanford
beating USC. 64-56, last night
in Maples Pavilion. "Beat," as in
Stanford beating its last six
straight Pacific-10 Conference
opponents. And "beat," as in
Stanford beating the odds and
probably going to its first
post-season tournament in 42
years.
"We're getting close (to a
post-season tournament bid),"

said Stanford Coach Tom
Davis, whose Cardinal team im
proved its record to 17-8 over
all and 6-6 in the Pac-10.
"Seventeen wins is getting
there. There have been teams
in the NIT (National Invita
tional Tournament) with 15
wins. So every game past that
gets us that much closer."
Last night's game, however,
was much closer than it could
have been,
Stanford gave a textbook
demonstration on how to lose a

l()-point halftime lead in the
early moments of the second
half. Minutes later, however, it
showed 5034 fans in Maples
Pavilion exactly how to get it
back.
Or rather, seniors Keith
Jones and John Revelli showed
them how. The pair of All-
America candidates took mat
ters into their own hands with
10:48 to play after a 33-23
halftime lead had evaporated
to 38-36.
Jones — who led all scorers
with 20 points — and Revelli
— who grabbed a game-high
nine rebounds — scored Stan
ford's next 12 points between
them in a span of 4:10, while
USC countered with only two.
The Cardinal had its biggest
lead of the evening at 50-38
with 6:38 remaining and the
Trojans were history.
"That's the sign of really
fine ballplayers," Davis said of
Jones' and Revelli's 12-point
run. "Keith Jones and John
Revelli have been doing that all
year."
USC did pull to within four
on three occasions in the
closing minutes, cutting Stan
lord leads to 54-50, 58-54 and
finally 60-56 with 0:20 to go.
But the Card hit the free
throws it had to down the
stretch and Jones added a lay
in at the buzzer to give it the
final eight-point margin.
"I was proud of the way we
got back into it," said USC
Coach Stan Morrison of his
team, which dropped to 9-16
overall and 4-8 in the Pac-10.
"But I thought we made
several 'young' kind of errors."
Ten players on the 15-man
Trojan roster are either fresh
men or sophomores.
USC got back into it by
scoring nine of the first 1 1
points in the second half and

cutting Stanford's lead to 35-
34. Cardinal guard Keith
Ramee was then called for an
offensive foul and the Trojans
had a chance to take their first
lead since they held a 2-0 ad
vantage.
Stanford, however, got the
ball back and seconds later tor
ward Andy Fischer was fouled
and made one of two free
throws. Trojan point guard
Larry Friend hit a short jumper
to tie it at 36-all with 12:24 to
play. Fischer then scored off an
offensive rebound to put the
Card ahead 38-36. After that,
it was all Jones and Revelli.
"Tom Davis is doing a great
job of getting his team
prepared." Morrison contin
ued. "I said last week that
Stanford could very well be 9-2
in the conference. Stanford
should be proud of fellows like
Keith Jones and John Revelli.
They are class guys and they do
a super job."
Statistically, the game was
virtually even. The Card shot
46.7 percent (21-for-45) from
the floor and the Trojans a
slightly worse 43.1 percent (22-
for-51). Stanford had 30
rebounds and USC 24. Stan
ford had 16 turnovers and USC
14.
But it was the Card's
second-half free-throw shoot
ing that made the difference,
especially in the late going.
USC, the No. 1 free throw
shooting team in the Pac-10,
netted 1 2-of-14 attempts
from the line. Stanford,
though, proved that in this
case quantity is more impor
tant than quality and hit 22-

UC-Berkeley when he went 12-

night he was 4-for-7, missing
three front ends of one-and
