# Harvest not that good for Bruin Coach Farmer
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Win or lose tomorrow afternoon against
Stanford. UCLA Coach Larry Farmer will be
seeing red.
The Stanford Basketball Office has
proclaimed tomorrow's game, scheduled to
start at 3 p.m., as "Red T-shirt Day"and is
urging all fans to wear red for the C BS
regionally-televised contest in sold-out
Maples Pavilion.
Seeing red. however, is nothing new to
Farmer lately. UCLA, which has won the
Pacific-10 Conference IS of the last 2 2
years, has been losing. Not losing as in a game
here or a game there, but losing as in three ot
the last four, four of the last six. five of the
last eight and six of the last 10. The Bruins
are presently 14-7 overall and in fourth place
in the Pac-10 at 7-4.
And for those even vaguely familiar with
Bruin basketball, losing that often is as un
characteristic as it is intolerable. Los Angeles
fans, spoiled by 10 NCAA titles in the last 20
years, want Farmer's job, let alone his head.
"It feels awfully tough," Farmer said over
the phone to Bay Area reporters Wednesday.
"Emotionally, it has been a rocky road for
us."
But playing on the road will certainly not
be rocky as far as Farmer and his Bruins are
concerned. In fact, playing away from Pauley
Pavilion, believe it or not, is probably to their
advantage. Before the season began, UCLA
had averaged less than one loss a year in
Pauley. The 1983-84 season is still seven
games from completion and the Bruins have
dropped four there, including the last three
in a row.
Playing on weekend afternoons, however,
has been their biggest bugaboo. UCLA is 1-6
in afternoon games this season (those begin
ning before 5 p.m.) and 13-1 in night con
tests. Gametime tomorrow is 3 p.m.
Although the Bruins' rich basketball
tradition makes them shoe-ins for a post
season tournament. Farmer isn't looking
ahead. "Right now, we're not looking at the
post-season," he said. "We're looking at our
last (seven) games and not to come out with

mud on our faces."
While the Bruins literally "own" UC-
Berkeley in basketball (last night's 70-62
overtime win made it 50 straight over the
Bears), the same cannot be said lor UCLA in
Maples Pavilion.
And 19N4. it recent trends hold true, is the
year of the Cardinal upset over the Bruins.
Stanford is currently defeating UCLA once
every three years, with upset wins in 1975,
197N and. most recently, in I9SI.
So it comes as no surprise that Farmer is
more concerned about Stanford than Cal. "I
think their (Stanford's) press can rattle
teams if you don't handle it properly and
their zone defense is tough if you're not pa
tient."
The Card, meanwhile, will concentrate on
handling the Bruins' decided height advan
tage. something it did rather well in a losing
effort to UCLA earlier this season.
Cardinal guard Keith Jones also noted that
UCLA looks forward to playing Stanford
more so than maybe any other Pac-10 school.
"They really get excited when they play us
because they get to play an up-tempo game,"
he said. "Most other teams try to keep them
out of it (a running game)."
