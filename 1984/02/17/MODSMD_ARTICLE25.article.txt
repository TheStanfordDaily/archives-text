# Card swims for perfect mark
## 
### MIKE LLERANDI 
The Stanford men's swim
team will host UC-Berkeley
tomorrow, but the meet will
have more than the usual
school rivalry as an added in
centive: It will mark the end of
the fifth regular dual meet
season for Head Coach Skip
Kenney.
It will also be a special event
for the Card's seven seniors.
"The Cal meet will be the
last home meet for the senior
class," Kenney said, "and they
mean a lot to me because they
were the first class I recruited.
1 want to dedicate (the meet)
to them."
Saturday's meet will also
feature a different format
than the other meets, because
it will follow a different order
of events. Rather than a 400
medley relay, each relay team

member will swim his leg indi
vidually, and the cumulative
times will determine the event
winner. Also, the 1000
freestyle will he replaced by
the 1650 freestyle, and the
400 individual medley — an
event not usually included in
dual meets — will be included.
The reason for the switch in
the events is that it will ac
commodate those swimmers
from both schools who are
trying to make NCAA Cham
pionship qualifying times. Such
a move should help make the
competition even more fierce
between the two schools.
A victory tomorrow will give
the Card its second consecutive
perfect dual meet season.
Stanford's winning ways are a
relatively recent phenomenon,
because they accompanied the
arrival of Kenney.

"When 1 was a senior (in high
school), I wasn't even consider
ing Stanford as a possibility,"
team captain and 1980 Olym
pic team member Dave Sims
recalled, "but after talking to
Skip and visiting the campus, I
decided that Stanford would
indeed fulfill both my academ
ic and my swimming needs."
Sims was not alone in his
decision four years ago. Among
the nation's top recruits, Todd
Lincoln, Mark Michael, Charlie
Johnson, Jim Anderson and
Ricky Bodor each decided sepa
rately to give the improving
Stanford swim program a try.
When the letters of intent
were all signed and the accep
tance letters sent out, Kenney
had compiled the best fresh

man class in the country.
Four years later, that compi
lation of talent has proved its
worth. The six mentioned
above, combined with fifth
year senior John Simons (who
was forced to sit out a year
with a knee operation) have
started a winning tradition at
Stanford.
"The guys have really made
these past four years super for
me and the program in gen
eral," Kenney said. "I'm very
proud of the way they have
performed both in the pool and
in the classroom — it certainly
has made my job easier. If
there's anything negative
about being (head coach) here,
it's seeing the seniors take off
at the end of the year."
