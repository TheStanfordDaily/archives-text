### PETER CASTILLO 
The Stanford wrestling team is hoping that
its youthful enthusiam and late season
peaking will be enough to topple perennial
powerhouse Cal Poly San Luis Obispo tonight
at Maples Pavilion.
"We have a good chance to take four
matches and with some upsets we could pull
off the match. Cal Poly has had its ups and
downs with injuries this season, but their
line-up now looks strong," Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel said. "Right now I feel good
about our chances because the workouts have
been productive and our healthy wrestlers are
peaking. We will have to see how strong their
line-up really is."
Scott Wiggen (142 pounds) will return
after recovering from a pulled rib muscle and
is mentally prepared and tough, according to

Horpel. At l 77 pounds Jeff Wilson has been
improving his conditioning and is a slight fa
vorite.
The surprise of last week's meet against
San Jose State was Pete Rogers (150 pounds)
who scored a 3-1 upset. Rogers has been
strong in his body positioning technique in
countering stronger opponents, and Horpel
said he believes his experience will be a factor.
Wrestlers who could pull off upsets are
Jeff Bradley (134 pounds), who has per
formed well under pressure, and Kurt Kas
sulke (190 pounds), who Horpel describes as
"fanatical." as well as in great condition men
tally and physically.
The weak spots in the Cardinal line-up are
at lIS pounds where Bert Fukunaga is ques
tionable and at heavyweight with reserve
Scott DuFault starting.
