# Gauchos could corral Card
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
With two weeks remaining
before the opening of its
Pacific-10 conference season,
the Stanford baseball team is
looking to reverse a recent
slump. The Cardinal entertains
the UC-Santa Barbara
Gauchos for a three-game se
ries at Sunken Diamond today
and tommorrow.
It the Gauchos' first ten
games are any indication, the
Card will have its hands full.
UC-Santa Barbara, ranked No.
13 in the same pre-season poll
that rated Stanford No. 6, is
oft to the best start in the
school's history with a spotless
10-0 record, while the Cardinal
is 8-5,
Although UCSB has preyed
on some easy pickings so far,
Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess warns that, "This
team is a quality team. You
have to be a pretty good ball
club to be 10-0, no matter
who you play."
The Gauchos will be hungry
too, as the memory of a season
ending 11-5 loss to Stanford in
last year's NCAA West
Regional must still be fresh in
their minds. UCSB competes in
the Southern California
Baseball Conference, the same
league that sent Cal State
Fullerton north to dump the
Cardinal in two out of three
games at Sunken Diamond ear
lier this year.
"They're a lot like Fuller
ton." Marquess said. "They like
to run a lot and put the pres
sure on you."
The Gauchos also possess a

potent offense, headed by in
fielder Bill Geivett and Kent
Mcßride, hitting .433 and .429,
respectively. And they're
backed by a strong pitching
staff.
UCSB's Rob Meyer is 2-0
with a stingy 0.82 ERA, while
George Bonilla is 2-0 and has a
2.25 ERA.
Stanford will counter with a
few mound aces of its own, all
right-handers. Senior Brian
Meyers (1-1, 4.50 ERA) will
climb the hill in today's series
opener. Sophomore Kevin
Kunkel, who is an unlucky 1-2
on the year despite a 1.80
ERA, is the expected starter in
the first contest of tomor
row's doubleheader and Senior
Steve Cottrell (2-0, 2.45 ERA)
follows in the nightcap.
The Cardinal, however, does
not have any .400 hitters in its
regular lineup. In fact, Stan
ford is hitting only .277 as a
team thus far and that is one
reason why its 8-5 record, 4-5
in the last nine games, might be
cause for concern as the Pac-10
season approaches.
"I'm disappointed because
we feel that we could've been
12-1 or 13-0 with one hit here
or one pitch there," Marquess
said. "Yet, at the same time,
to swing the bat as poorly as we
have and still be 8-5 is not bad.
I really think we'll get better
offensively as the year goes
on."
Marquess' theory should
receive a stiff test when the
two clubs square off at 2:30
p.m. today. Tommorrow's
doubleheader begins at noon.

Freshman pitcher Rick Dietz may need a trick or two up his
sleeve if the Cardinal expects to cool off hot-hitting UC-
Santa Barbara. The Gauchos' lineup features two .400 hit
ters, another item the Stanford offense sorely lacks.
