The Stanford women gym
nasts had a tough break in
Arizona last night against
Arizona State University.
ASU, currently ranked
second in the nation, is in a
class of its own and totaled an
amazing team score of 185.95.
The Cardinal only managed a
176.90, nearly three and a half
points less than its last meet
record-breaking total of
180.15.
"1 felt certain that ASU
would beat us," Head Coach
Homer Sardina said. "But I
thought we would put up a
better fight than that. We
were hoping for a team score in
the 180.00s."
"Traveling all day and then
competing in the same evening
probably didn't help us any. No

one on the team really hit."
said Sardina.
Senior Merilyn Chapman
placed fourth in the all-around
with a 36.55 and junior Angie
Barnes placed fifth with a
36.05. Chapman also took a
fourth on bars and Barnes
placed fourth in floor with a
9.30.
"When a score of 9.30 takes
a fourth-place finish on an
event, that tells you something
about the high caliber of this
meet," said Sardina. The ASU
gymnasts took the top three
places on each of the four
events.
The Cardinal biggest
downfall was on bars, where
everyone seemed to have
misses. Floor was the high
point for the team, but it
wasn't enough to make up for

the points lost on bars.
"Both bars and beam are
touchy events." said Sardina.
"They can make or break the
team score."
The Cardinal will rest today
before it meets Montana
State and sixth-ranked Univer
sity of Arizona tomorrow in
Tucson. Sardina felt hopeful
for Saturdays' competition.
"We need a score in the
ISO.OOs to have any sort of a
chance at Nationals." said Sar
dina.
The men's team will be com
peting tonight against
Fullerton State and lowa
State, at Fullerton. It should
be a tough competition with
top 10-ranked lowa State
leading the teams. Head Coach
Sadeo Hamada said Stanford
should look strong after res
ting last weekend.
