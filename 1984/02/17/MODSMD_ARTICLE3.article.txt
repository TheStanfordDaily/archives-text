# Losses may total $1.7 million
## Athletics to trim deficit 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Staff writer 
Stanford's Athletic Department is in the process of
implementing a new intercollegiate sports program de
signed to cut $700,000 of a deficit that may total $1.7
million, according to Athletic Director Andy Geiger.
Roughly $500,000 of this year's $750,000 deficit may
be attributed to low football revenues resulting from
the University's inability to obtain television coverage
for football games as well as the team's 1-10 record and
consequent drastically reduced gate receipts.
"We want to bring our program into financial equilib
rium," said Alan Cummings, associate athletic director.
The department hopes to achieve this goal by combin
ing the new program with a more aggressive fund-raising
plan, Geiger said. In fact, the new system will work as
hoped only if the department can raise $500,000, he
said.
In the new system, Stanford's 48 intercollegiate
teams will each be placed at one of three levels. Varsity I
teams will continue to receive full funding, but Varsity
II and 111 teams will have to raise much of their own
funds for travel and various other expenses.
Though optimistic that the program will succeed,
Geiger is not happy about having to cut funding to these
teams. "We're trying to make the changes as little as
possible," he said.

Teams that will have Varsity I status include, for men:
baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, swim
ming, tennis, track and water polo; and for women: bas
ketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, swimming,
tennis, track and volleyball.
Teams that will have Varsity II status include, to
name a few. men's and women's crew and soccer, men's
volleyball and women's field hockey.
Coaches of the teams that will lose funding
"understand the financial realities and can hope for
reinstatement to the Varsity I level," Cummings said.
"There will be initial disappointment, but ... I see the
energy of the coaches being spent on how to implement
the program and raise money," he said.
The reaction of Varsity II coaches seems to reflect
Cummings' predictions.
"Hopefully it won't affect us a whole lot." said Don
Shaw, assistant volleyball coach. "We're not real happy,
but we understand the situation. We're going to do
everything we can to keep the program we have." The
men's volleyball team is currently ranked fifth in the na
tion.
Varsity II team coaches have been much more enthusi
astic about the new set-up after learning that their
scholarship money will not be revoked. Anne Killefer,
The ASSU has announced the ap
pointment of a new student finan
cial manager for 1984-85.
Chris O'Brien, a junior majoring in
political science, will serve as associ
ate student financial manager until
assuming the higher post June 14. He
will serve a one-year term.
He said the associate position will
enable him to intern with Mindy Bas
ham, the present student financial
manager, thus ensuring a smooth
transition.

"It's going to be a great chal
lenge." O'Brien said, adding that his
tenure as chair of the ASSU Senate
Budget and Finance Committee this
year has allowed him to work closely
with the ASSU financial office.
O'Brien was appointed by a com
mittee consisting of Council-of-
Presidents members Vinnie Freda and
Su Uhland and ASSU senators Eric
Berg and David Porter. He is slated
to earn $10,500 per year, the same
salary Basham now receives.

varsity field hockey coach, was par
ticularly pleased to hear that she will
not lose those funds.
"I'm excited about the prospect of
keeping the program alive, and I want
to do everything possible to help the
department." she said. "We can have
a quality program with the scholar
ships." The women's field hockey
team finished the season ranked
14th nationally.
With insufficient funding from
the University, Varsity II teams face
a difficult problem in finding an al
ternate financial source. Shaw, who
coaches both the women's and men's
volleyball teams with Frederick
Sturm, said that the men's team will
have to find ways to save and raise
money so that it can continue to
travel to the Southern Californian
schools that provide its best compe
tition." Not only do Fred and I coach
two teams, but we also have to
become fund-raisers," Shaw said.
Killefer said the field hockey team
would be actively fund raising so that

it could continue to travel to the
schools most competitive in the
sport. Because those schools are
mainly on the East Coast, the team
will undoubtedly have to raise much
money, but KiMeter seems ready to
meet the challenge.
"We already have a team fund
raising committee." she said. She
plans to raise the necessary funds bv
sponsoring events and from using
existing field hockey booster club
grants.
With the scholarship worry allevi
ated and the fund-raising problem
well in hand. Killefer said she has to
deal with only one other major
change under the new system. Var
sity II coaching will count as 33 per
cent of a full-time job next year, she
said. She and the other Varsity II
coaches will thus have to seek job op
portunities in other parts of the
University, such as in publicity or
teaching physical activity classes, she
said.
Geiger said he will be cutting funds
at all levels. "We will try to retain
most of the coaches," he said.
