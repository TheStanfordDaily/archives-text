# Losses may total $1.7 million
## Athletics to trim deficit 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Staff writer 
Stanford's Athletic Department is in the process of
implementing a new intercollegiate sports program de
signed to cut $700,000 of a deficit that may total $1.7
million, according to Athletic Director Andy Geiger.
Roughly $500,000 of this year's $750,000 deficit may
be attributed to low football revenues resulting from
the University's inability to obtain television coverage
for football games as well as the team's 1-10 record and
consequent drastically reduced gate receipts.
"We want to bring our program into financial equilib
rium," said Alan Cummings, associate athletic director.
The department hopes to achieve this goal by combin
ing the new program with a more aggressive fund-raising
plan, Geiger said. In fact, the new system will work as
hoped only if the department can raise $500,000, he
said.
In the new system, Stanford's 48 intercollegiate
teams will each be placed at one of three levels. Varsity I
teams will continue to receive full funding, but Varsity
II and 111 teams will have to raise much of their own
funds for travel and various other expenses.
Though optimistic that the program will succeed,
Geiger is not happy about having to cut funding to these
teams. "We're trying to make the changes as little as
possible," he said.

Teams that will have Varsity I status include, for men:
baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, swim
ming, tennis, track and water polo; and for women: bas
ketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, swimming,
tennis, track and volleyball.
Teams that will have Varsity II status include, to
name a few. men's and women's crew and soccer, men's
volleyball and women's field hockey.
Coaches of the teams that will lose funding
"understand the financial realities and can hope for
reinstatement to the Varsity I level," Cummings said.
"There will be initial disappointment, but ... I see the
energy of the coaches being spent on how to implement
the program and raise money," he said.
The reaction of Varsity II coaches seems to reflect
Cummings' predictions.
"Hopefully it won't affect us a whole lot." said Don
Shaw, assistant volleyball coach. "We're not real happy,
but we understand the situation. We're going to do
everything we can to keep the program we have." The
men's volleyball team is currently ranked fifth in the na
tion.
Varsity II team coaches have been much more enthusi
astic about the new set-up after learning that their
scholarship money will not be revoked. Anne Killefer,
