The Stanford men's tennis team will continue
its series of pre-season 'scrimmages" when it
faces Canada College today at the Varsity Ten
nis Courts.
Canada "is usually one of the two top junior
colleges in the country," Cardinal Head Coach
Dick Gould said. However, Gould is the first to
admit that against a major university and tennis
giant like Stanford, Canada is out of its league.
Thus, the lower rungs of Stanford's 12-man
ladder can expect to see action today. "I*ll prob
ably go mostly with the second six (players),"
Gould said. "Everyone on the team should play
somewhere — either in singles or doubles."
Stanford will be without the services of soph
omore starters John Letts and Jim Grabb. The

Card's No. 1 doubles team is playing in
the prestigious All-America Indoor Champion
ships in Indiana. Letts is also competing for the
singles crown.
Although Stanford's defending NCAA Cham
pionship team was ranked No. 1 in the nation's
pre-season poll, Gould says that could change
next week, "My guess is we might be as low as
two or three, after losing to UCLA." The
Bruins setback Stanford 6-3 in the National
Team Championships two weeks ago.
Stanford is the site of next week's Northern
California Intercollegiate Championships. "It
already looks to be a good draw," Gould said.
UC-Berkeley, San Jose State, University of
Pacific, Sonoma State and UC-Davis are among
the entrants.
