# Subtlety has no place at the Plum

Your childhood dream of a fancy restau
rant was probably not too different from
what you'll find at Maxwell's Plum in
Ghirardelli Square. It's opulent, expensive
and a bit beyond reality. Though the food
may not be a gourmet's dream, the Max
well's experience may be worth at least
one visit.
The word "subtle" apparently had no
meaning for the designers of the restau
rant. Huge chandeliers, stained glass, mir
rors and brass are laid on so thick it looks
like something designed by a flamboyant
king. The all-out opulence does create a
fun atmosphere and makes you forget
that you are living in the sleek modern age.
Although we were 45 minutes late for
our reservation on a crowded night, the
maitre d' escorted us to our table without
even a chastising glance. Huge windows
overlook the bay, and an equally huge glass
mural of a tiger overlooked our table. The
tables are beautifully set and our waiter
frequently adjusted the centerpiece or a
fork if he found them unaesthetically ar
ranged.
Everyone else was in a hurry at Maxwell's
Plum. The service is quick but don't expect
to get to know the waiter. The maitre d'
seated us; someone else took our drink or
der. followed by a waiter who took our
tood order and several others who did the
serving. Although they were all polite, it
gave us the impression of being part of an
assembly line. Eventually the number of
servers shuttling by our table had an al
most comic affect.

To start off the meal we had the duck
ling pate with cognac ($4.75) and the
seafood pate florentine ($4.95). Both
were excellent. The seafood pate consist
ing of scallops, salmon and sole with
spinach and puree of fresh tomatoes was
unique and surprisingly good. The ap
petizer list is extensive offering choices
from artichokes ($4) to smoked salmon
and shrimp ($N.95).
Our luck with the main courses was not
quite as good. After examining a very ex
tensive menu which offers seafood, beef
and pasta, we chose the two chefs sugges
tions. The Sea Shell of Fresh Seafood

Eventually the number of
servers shuffling by our
table had an almost comic
effect.

Parisienne ($17.95) was touted as scallops,
shrimp, crabs and mushrooms in champagne
sauce, but the sauce was disappointingly
bland and the seafood was not exception
al. The second entree was a lamb dish that
was delicious. Tender pieces of lamb were
garnished with artichoke bottoms,
potatoes and tomato. Other menu
choices include broiled tournedos of beef
stuffed with crab ($18.95), fettuccine
($8.95) and Maxwell's beef chili ($5.50).
If you want your vegetables you'll have
to pay extra and we were shocked to sec
that Maxwell's even charges an extra 50
cents for sour cream on your baked
potato. Only the asparagus, which was per
fectly cooked, helped make up for this.

I he wine list includes 450 choices with
the prices averaging about $20 per bottle.
Ie sensible carafe of house wine (SN.SO)
was fine, though next time the 1
Chateau Latour ($220) might be a nice ad
dition to the meal.
Poor communication between the ser
ving team did cause one mix-up. The waiter
forgot to bring our salads and then
brought them after the main course. Mix
ups like this are probably not infrequent
at a restaurant that does such a volume of
business each night. Because they deal
with large numbers the small touches you
would expect at other restaurants of this
price were often forgotten.
Throughout the meal the restaurant it
self offers entertainment for people
watchers. Many large groups were seated
around us and a woman occasionally
delivered Maxwell's Plum balloons to
people seated throughout the restaurant.
Masses of people also entered a banquet
room and emerged later wearing hats.
Maxwell's is unusually loud for a restau
rant and is ideally suited for large groups.
If you would like to try the chocolate
souffle for dessert, order it in advance. We
were not informed until after our meal
that you should order it before the meal
to avoid a half hour wait, so we had to set
tle for the black bottom pie. It was a cus
tard pie that was not especially good.
Maxwell's Plum would be a good place to
go for a drink or a snack just to see the
dining rooms and bar. all with different
decor. Many consider it gaudy, but it is
hard to compare to anything else because
Maxwell's Plum certainly attempts to set
its own standard.
