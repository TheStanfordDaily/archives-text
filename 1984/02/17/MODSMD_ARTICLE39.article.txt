It is said that the three most
important factors for a suc
cessful restaurant are location,
location and location. An
thony's Pier 9 clearly satisfies
these three requirements. Al
though it is not exceptional in
many ways, it is exceptionally
easy find. Simply take the
Saratoga Sunnyvale exit after
driving 20 minutes south tin
Highway 2NO and it's on the
right.
I he parking lot offered clear
evidence that our idea of a
Valentine's Day dinner was not
an original. I had a 9:30 p.m.
reservation but still had a short
wait before a courteous waiter
led us to our table.
Anthony's Pier 9 specializes
in seafood and the decor
reflects this emphasis. The ex
otic fish tank centered in the
dining room and the stuffed
fowl are great conversation
pieces. The only problem is
that these centerpieces were
all that we could see. The res
taurant was dark enough to
make menu reading a fiasco.
After our eyes had adjusted
a bit, we decided to start our
meal with a seafood combina
tion appetizer ($6.50) and a
cup of clam chowder ($1.95).
The quality of clam chowder
often reflects the quality of a
seafood restaurant in general.
Though not exceptional, the
chowder was tasty. The
seafood combination with raw
oysters and raw clams is a culi
nary experience, though not
suited for the squeamish eater.
We ordered a bottle of 1952
Robert Mondavi Chenin Blanc
for $16. In any restaurant, wine
is more expensive than else
where, but this price for an
average bottle of wine seemed

unusually expensive. Overall,
the wine list was complete hut
overpriced. One way to out
maneuver an expensive bottle
of wine is to order drinks trom
the har.
For the main course. I or
dered Ahalone Steak, a
specialty of the house. At
$23.95 it is one of the most ex
pensive dishes Anthony's ot
ters. I have often heard of the
mad rush of scuha divers to col
lect these delicacies during
ahalone season. However, un
less you are a fanatic, this Cali
fornia feast may not he the
wisest choice at Anthony's Pier
9. Although the dish itself was
good. I did not think it was
worth the price. The side or
ders tit bland vegetables and
rice did not add to an experi
ence that should have been su
perb. My date faired better.
His Scampi, sau teed with
mushrooms, was delicious, and
at $14.95 much more
reasonable.
In general, dinners start at
$10 and the average price is
around $15. As expected, all
the seafood is fresh. Even if
your group contains a meat and
potato lover, there are many
good dishes, such as Veal Oscar
and Tournedos Rossini, to
choose from. One can order
dinner a la carte or complete
with soup or salad and an ap
petizer.
After we finished, the
waiter returned to remind us
of dessert. Chris ordered
cheesecake and I ordered
Amaretto Mousse. My mousse
was too light and the
cheesecake was not special. So
much for dessert.
While Anthony's Pier 9
would not be my top choice for
an intimate dining experience, 1
feel it would be good for large
groups.
