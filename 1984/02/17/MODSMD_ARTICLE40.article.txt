# Los Altos restaurant drips with French authenticity

Los Altos

Although Los Altos is only a
hort drive from campus, it
iay seem worlds away.
Dining at An C'hamhertin is
n experience that seems
forlds away. The place is drip
ing with French authenticity;
lajestic chateaus and the Arc
e Triomphe seem like they
ould be just around the cor
er.
The greeting is a quaint
oyer, accented by a stone,
ion-flowing fountain. The
irst words one hears are
Monsieur, Madame," and they
ire accompanied by the
eserved smile that is so typical
>112 Parisians.
The ambiance is unqucs
ionably European — some of
t seems forced, but for the
nost part, the restauranteurs
iave done well. The weak spot
s the tacky white Christmas
tyle lights that line the at
ractive wood-framed
windows. The spotted glass
:andle covers on the tables are
llso somewhat distracting.
The candlelight and

Christmas lights combined
with not-subtle-enough bulb
lighting make the customers
feel as though they are dining
at a hotel coffee shop rather
than a petite je ne suis quoi.
The largest of the four
dining rooms at Au C'hamher
tin was by no means spacious —

The greeting is a quaint foyer,
accented by a stone, non-flowing
fountain. The first words one
hears are ''Monsieur, Madame,'
and they are accompanied by the
reserved smile that is so typical
of Parisians.

the table tucked in the corner
was surrounded by six to eight
large parties. And what a party
they were having. It was
tempting to lean over a few
feet and tell the fivesome next
to us that a triathlon does not
consist of 36 miles of running

and a bicycle ride around the
block.
But then again, they prob
ably would not have been able
to hear us over the guffaws of
the elderly imbibers across the
room.
Regardless, the setting is
charming. The colonial decor.

highlighted by hanging prints
and attractive table settings, is
comfortable and inviting. A
homey but open atmosphere is
created by the small rooms bor
dered by windows that look
out into the foyer.
The overall attractiveness

was tempered only by the baby
blue polyester curtains and
drooping carnation in the ar
rangement decorating the
table.
The service at Au Chamber
tin is superb: The exuberant
busboy never let the bread
plates sit lonely, and drinks,
food and wine were served
promptly and appropriately.
The warm french bread was
the perfect complement to
smooth gin and tonics ($3
each), though it wasn't quite
hot enough to melt the hard —
but delicious — sweet butter
that was served in a fancy swirl.
Water glasses came garnished
with a slice of lemon — always
a nice, if unnecessary, touch.
Then menus were presented in
a heavy, hard-bound casing, and
at three feet high they were
somewhat cumbersome at a
small table.
The Salade Chambertin
($4.75), a mixture of bibb
lettuce, artichoke bottoms,
hearts of palm and Bay shrimp,
is the right starter for her
bivores who crave the taste of
a traditional vinaigrette.
The Crevettes Sauce Bor
dealis Blanche ($6.95), four
large cooked shrimp topped by
a warm white wine sauce, were
succulent, but seemed a bit
overpriced.
Au Chambertin features
several other hot hors
d'oeuvres — including snails
and sweetbreads, and oysters in
champagne with curry — along
with a variety of warm and
chilled soups and salads.
The entree choice is large but
not overwhelming. The three
"pour deux" items,
Chateaubriand ($32.95), rack
of lamb ($36.95), and roasted
duckling ($29.95), sound su
perb as they are described on
the menu. The veal chop
topped with a baked avocado
souffle ($16.75), and minute
steak flamed in cognac
($15.25) are also enticing.
The Grenadine de Boeuf
Flambee Toulousain — thin
slices of beef, flamed in brandy

and finished in a sauce with
sweetbreads — was tender and
tasty. The only drawback to
the dish was the fact that the
flaming ceremony took place
not at the table, but across the
way at the entrance to the
room.

The 'piece de resistance' was
unquestionably the chocolate
cheesecake - not too chocolaty
or rich, but sweet enough to
make one feel guilty.

One of two fish specials of
the evening, salmon in an herb
and garlic sauce, is also best
described as tender and was
perfectly accented by the light
sauce covering.
Fresh broccoli, carrots, green
beans and yellow squash, ar
ranged colorfully in rows on the
plates, were a top-notch ac

companiment to the entrees
though the carrots were under
cooked.
Au Chambertin boasts an
impressive (and somewhat con
fusing) 11-page wine list
(complete with index) featur
ing a $350 bottle. The more af-

fordable $11 Mondavi
Johannesburg Reisling is good
if one enjoys fruity wines.
The piece de resistance was

cheesecake — not too

that deter you.

Like the chocolate
cheesecake, the yummy white
cake with boysenberries was
served with a dallop of freshly
whipped cream. The special
house dessert — Grand Mar
nier Souffle — looked good at
the table next to us (the
would-be triathletes), but
must be ordered 45 minutes
ahead of time, somewhere in
between the salad and entree.
Au Chambertin's owner, Dan
Stein, is also the restaurant's
chef. Stein (admittedly) is not
exactly cast out of the mold
the rest of the establishment:
The bearded young man looked
out of place emerging from the
kitchen in his white chefs out
fit.
After all the "Monsieurs,
Madames" and proper eti
quette, Stein actually seemed
foreign, but was welcome at
the table. His easygoing man
ner and concern for our meal
were appreciated.
In Stein's own words, the
evening was "right on."

must be ordered 45 minutes
ahead of time, somewhere in
between the salad and entree.
Au Chambertin's owner, Dan
Stein, is also the restaurant's
chef. Stein (admittedly) is not
exactly cast out of the mold
the rest of the establishment:
The bearded young man looked
out of place emerging from the
kitchen in his white chefs out
fit.
After all the "Monsieurs,
Madames" and proper eti
quette, Stein actually seemed
foreign, but was welcome at
the table. His easygoing man
ner and concern for our meal
were appreciated.
In Stein's own words, the
evening was "right on."

hi Chambertin
70 State Street
Los Altos
48-8721
Although Los Altos is only a
hort drive from campus, it
iay seem worlds away.
Dining at An C'hamhertin is
n experience that seems
forlds away. The place is drip
ing with French authenticity;
lajestic chateaus and the Arc
e Triomphe seem like they
ould be just around the cor
er.
The greeting is a quaint
oyer, accented by a stone,
ion-flowing fountain. The
irst words one hears are
Monsieur, Madame," and they
ire accompanied by the
eserved smile that is so typical
>112 Parisians.
The ambiance is unqucs
ionably European — some of
t seems forced, but for the
nost part, the restauranteurs
iave done well. The weak spot
s the tacky white Christmas
tyle lights that line the at
ractive wood-framed
windows. The spotted glass
:andle covers on the tables are
llso somewhat distracting.
The candlelight and

Christmas lights combined
with not-subtle-enough bulb
lighting make the customers
feel as though they are dining
at a hotel coffee shop rather
than a petite je ne suis quoi.
The largest of the four
dining rooms at Au C'hamher
tin was by no means spacious —

The greeting is a quaint foyer,
accented by a stone, non-flowing
fountain. The first words one
hears are ''Monsieur, Madame,'
and they are accompanied by the
reserved smile that is so typical
of Parisians.

the table tucked in the corner
was surrounded by six to eight
large parties. And what a party
they were having. It was
tempting to lean over a few
feet and tell the fivesome next
to us that a triathlon does not
consist of 36 miles of running

and a bicycle ride around the
block.
But then again, they prob
ably would not have been able
to hear us over the guffaws of
the elderly imbibers across the
room.
Regardless, the setting is
charming. The colonial decor.

highlighted by hanging prints
and attractive table settings, is
comfortable and inviting. A
homey but open atmosphere is
created by the small rooms bor
dered by windows that look
out into the foyer.
The overall attractiveness

was tempered only by the baby
blue polyester curtains and
drooping carnation in the ar
rangement decorating the
table.
The service at Au Chamber
tin is superb: The exuberant
busboy never let the bread
plates sit lonely, and drinks,
food and wine were served
promptly and appropriately.
The warm french bread was
the perfect complement to
smooth gin and tonics ($3
each), though it wasn't quite
hot enough to melt the hard —
but delicious — sweet butter
that was served in a fancy swirl.
Water glasses came garnished
with a slice of lemon — always
a nice, if unnecessary, touch.
Then menus were presented in
a heavy, hard-bound casing, and
at three feet high they were
somewhat cumbersome at a
small table.
The Salade Chambertin
($4.75), a mixture of bibb
lettuce, artichoke bottoms,
hearts of palm and Bay shrimp,
is the right starter for her
bivores who crave the taste of
a traditional vinaigrette.
The Crevettes Sauce Bor
dealis Blanche ($6.95), four
large cooked shrimp topped by
a warm white wine sauce, were
succulent, but seemed a bit
overpriced.
Au Chambertin features
several other hot hors
d'oeuvres — including snails
and sweetbreads, and oysters in
champagne with curry — along
with a variety of warm and
chilled soups and salads.
The entree choice is large but
not overwhelming. The three
"pour deux" items,
Chateaubriand ($32.95), rack
of lamb ($36.95), and roasted
duckling ($29.95), sound su
perb as they are described on
the menu. The veal chop
topped with a baked avocado
souffle ($16.75), and minute
steak flamed in cognac
($15.25) are also enticing.
The Grenadine de Boeuf
Flambee Toulousain — thin
slices of beef, flamed in brandy

and finished in a sauce with
sweetbreads — was tender and
tasty. The only drawback to
the dish was the fact that the
flaming ceremony took place
not at the table, but across the
way at the entrance to the
room.

The 'piece de resistance' was
unquestionably the chocolate
cheesecake - not too chocolaty
or rich, but sweet enough to
make one feel guilty.

One of two fish specials of
the evening, salmon in an herb
and garlic sauce, is also best
described as tender and was
perfectly accented by the light
sauce covering.
Fresh broccoli, carrots, green
beans and yellow squash, ar
ranged colorfully in rows on the
plates, were a top-notch ac

companiment to the entrees
though the carrots were under
cooked.
Au Chambertin boasts an
impressive (and somewhat con
fusing) 11-page wine list
(complete with index) featur
ing a $350 bottle. The more af-

fordable $11 Mondavi
Johannesburg Reisling is good
if one enjoys fruity wines.

cheesecake — not too
chocolaty or rich, but sweet

that deter you.

Like the chocolate
cheesecake, the yummy white
cake with boysenberries was
served with a dallop of freshly
whipped cream. The special
house dessert — Grand Mar
nier Souffle — looked good at
the table next to us (the
would-be triathletes), but
must be ordered 45 minutes
ahead of time, somewhere in
