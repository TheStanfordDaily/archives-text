- Hollx Near

For those acquainted with
Holly Near's repertoire it was a
time for renewal. For those
new to her music and her work,
it was a time for enchantment
and enlightenment as three
captivating women artists, led
by Near, delivered a myriad of
messages in music and dance to
the audience in Memorial
Auditorium last Friday eve
ning.
Transcending the expecta
tions and limitations of the
mainstream of modern music.
Near, accompanied by pianist
Nina Goldin and sign language
artist Susan Freundlich, put
her cards on the table — face
up — with a moving collection
of anti-war, anti-nuclear, so
cially and politically responsible
songs.
No. this was not a flashback
to the 19605. or a confronta
tion of '70s cynicism, but an
encouragement to alter the
way we treat one another and
challenge the obstacles that
make survival difficult in the
'80s. Near offers the listener a
passionate and well-crafted fu
sion of poetry and politics in
musical form.
After sharing her plan to
embark on a 10-day mission to

Nicaragua next week for
several free "friendship con
certs" and to meet with cul
tural workers and women's
groups, Near broke down any
barriers with a pure and dra
matic rendition of Carole
King's classic, "You've Got a
Friend." and the audience
joined in.
During the two-hour, two
encore performance. Near's
clear soprano voice danced atop
the higher ranges and
plunged into more gruff and
gutsy tones for songs like
"Back Off." This is her warn
ing to insensitive lovers off the
album Speed of Light, which
made Billboard's Pick of The
Week List and has been played
by both AM and FM stations
across the country.
Near performed a well
chosen collection of songs. In
cluded were two classic
anti-war songs off her debut
album Hang In There titled
"No More Genocide" and"It
Could Have Been Me." These
were balanced gently with en
ergizing pieces like "Unity,"
"Imagine My Surprise" and
"Fire In The Rain." On a
humorous note. Near shared
how Kermit the frog doused
her with a bucket of water on
Sesame Street during her song
"Water Come Down," which
she sang flawlessly for Friday
night's enthusiastic crowd.
Recognizing that American
Sign Language is the third

most popular form of commu
nication in this country. Near
explained the presence of
talented sign artist Susan
Freundlich and stressed the im
portance of making the arts

accessible to everyone. The
overall impression of in
terpretive music and dance was
exciting.
The choreography for each
piece showed a well-rehearsed
balance of both lyrics and
movement. Freundlich exhib
ited sensitive expression in her
translation and added a special
dimension to the concert. The
contrast between soft and

direct spotlighting accented
the mood of Nears songs. It
was refreshing to see "Dancing
Bird" and "Wrap The Sun
Around You" presented in
both music and motion.
Pianist Nina Goldin is an ex
ceptional artist. She had the
ability to remain completely in
synch with Near throughout
the evening. Goldin demon
strated her diversity by ranging

from classical and reggae to
soul and rhythm and blues.
Near midshow. Holly turned
the stage over to Goldin for a
solo piece.
In anticipation of Saturday
night's performance at UC-
Santa Cruz. Goldin's alma
mater, she reminisced about
her early composing days and
chose a selection she had writ
ten during college entitled
"Zucchini," which was rich and
playful. She appeared to be
having as much fun playing it as
we had listening to her play.
Goldin was as impressive alone
as she was throughout the
show.
Off the stage Near con
tinues to break through the
virtually unpenetrable harrier
that separates "alternative"
from mainstream musical
styles. Not only did she start
her own record label. Redwood
Records, to release her 1973 al
bum Hang In There, comprised
primarily of anti-war protest
songs, but she just released her
eighth album and is approach
ing the half million mark in
record sales. That is no easy
task when one is relying on a
grassroots collective network.
Ordinarily, "movement"
music gains and loses momen
tum relative to enthusiasm for
the issue, but Near's music is an
exception. Her interest in per
forming dates back to broad
way stardom at age seven, and
has been growing ever since.
She majored in theater at
UCLA with a minor in political
science, which she says was "just
in case I didn't become a broad
way star." Near has appeared in
many theatre and film produc

tions including Hair on broad
way: "Room 222,"' "All In The
Family," "The Mod Squad . and
"The Partridge Family" (she
called this the "final straw").
She also has appeared in several
talk shows and had minor roles
in motion pictures. During her
training as a singer/actress she
spent nine years in sessions
with Johnny Mathis' vocal
coach. Connie Cox.
Shortly after "The Partridge
Family" and during the heat of
the Vietnam War. Near
became politically active and
quickly accepted Jane Fonda
and Donald Sutherland's invi
tation to join them in enter
taining American Gls in the
Far East. Since then she has
traveled the world sharing her
views on social justice,
feminism, lesbian and gay
rights, safe energy, nuclear dis
armament, responsible love and
international peace and
solidarity. Near believes in the
power of cultural work in uni
fying and inspiring change.
Wherever she performs, whe
ther in small intimate clubs, at
colleges and universities, on the
stages of major concert halls or
at huge outdoor rallies her ex
traordinary voice and the
graceful intensity of her stage
presence leave audiences
feeling renewed and energized.
A Holly Near concert is always
an event to be remembered.
When you get the chance to
see one of her concerts or pick
up one of her albums in the
local record store — don't
hesitate.
Someone you know may
want to hear her music or may
need to hear her message.
