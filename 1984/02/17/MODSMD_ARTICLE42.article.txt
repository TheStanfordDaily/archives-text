From Here to Eternity (1953)
Tresidder Union, Room 270
One of the two or three best
American movies of the early
19505. Daniel Taradash adapted
James Jones' bestseller about
soldiers stationed at Pearl Har
bor just before the Japanese
attack in 1941, and Fred Xin
nemann directed, beautifully.
The extraordinary cast includes
Montgomery Clift (giving his

greatest performance) as the
sensitive bugler Prewitt; Burt
I.ancaster as the sergeant in
love with his captain's wife,
played by Deborah Kerr; Frank
Sinatra as mouthy, appealing
Maggio; Donna Reed as the
nightclub "hostess" (a Hays
Code euphemism) in love with
Prewitt; and Ernest Borgnine
as the evil bully in charge of the
stockade. Among the sequences
movie lovers have cherished for
years are Lancaster's first ad
vance to Kerr; the love scene on
the beach (memorably spoofed
by Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca
on TV); the communal drunk
scene that climaxes in Maggio's
death; and — most moving of
all — Pruitt's bugle tribute to
his dead buddy.,The haunting
melody sung in the drunk scene
is "Re-enlistment Blues."
Plays tonight at 7 & 9.

The Best Years of Our Lives
(1946)
Kresge Auditorium
William Wyler's film about
three World War II veterans
coming home is one of the tri
umphs of studio filmmaking.
Screenwriter Robert E. Sher
wood's vision of small-town life
in America and the problems
facing returning soldiers is
overly optimistic and has a
merely peripheral connection to
several vital issues of the time
(class distinctions, the eco
nomy, even the horrors of war),
but his script is deft and well
structured, the acting is impec
cable, and overall the film is
beautifully crafted by Wyler
and the photographer, Gregg
Toland. The movie has unusual
passages that no one who has
seen it is likely to forget:
Fredric March's presentation of
a Japanese weapon, a war
souvenir, to his son, who
doesn't know how to react to »

it; the scene in which Myrna
Loy (as March's wife) describes
the vicissitudes of marriage to
their daughter (Teresa Wright);
Dana Andrews' memory of a
plane bombing; and the scene in
which a man who has lost his
hands (Harold Russell, who was
in fact wounded in the war) is
undressed by his fiancee (Cathy
O'Donnell) and put to bed.
Plays tonight at 9.
The Twilight Zone (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
The two episodes that are
really closest in spirit to the TV
show — the infamous one by
John Landis, with Vic Morrow
as a bigot, and Steven Spiel
berg's adaptation of "Kick the
Can," with Scatman Crothers
as a sort of shaman in an old
folks' home — are much less
successful than the third and
fourth segments, each of which
has its own distinctive style.
(The Landis and Spielberg parts
tend to be overemphatic,
clunky and pedantic.) In Joe
Dante's portion, based on "It's
a Good Life," a little boy (the
deft young actor Jeremy Licht)
brings a schoolteacher
(Kathleen Quinlan) home to
supper; the kid. who can turn
his thoughts into realities,
thinks in cartoons, and so the
house looks like it might have
been designed by Tex Avery or
Chuck Jones. George Miller di
rected the last part, out of
Richard Matheson's
"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"; it
is built around a virtuoso per
formance by John Lithgow as a
terrified airplane passenger who
sees a gremlin on the wing of his
plane. Miller's craftsmanship is
seamless — this sequence and
Dante's are small gems of hor
ror.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 &
9:30.
Luther(l974)
Madera Lounge
John Osborne's play takes
Erikson's famous psychological
study of Martin Luther (Young
Man Luther) to an absurd
degree: Luther's constipation is
seen as the force behind all his
actions. Guy Green filmed this
grim, prolix stage piece pretty
much from third row center,
i and that vigorous, hollow actor

Stacy Keach plays the title role.
It's hard to know which is the
greater irritant: the dialogue or
Reach's performance. With
Patrick Magce (acting with his
eyes in the manner of a bad
silent screen villain), Hugh
Griffith, Robert Stephens,
Alan Badel and Judi Dench.
Plays Tuesday evening at
6:30. '
Betrayal (1983)
Building 200-203
Typically, this Harold Pinter
play (first produced in 1978)
fails in adaptation: The acid ex
changes between the characters
have a hollow sound on film,
and the ambiguities suddenly
seem bald and obvious. The
director, David Jones, seeks to
solve the problems inherent in
the bare-bones theatrical
structure (the play traces the
intimate relationship of three
people by moving backwards
through time) by bringing the
play as close as possible to
naturalism, which turns Pinter
into bad Ibsen. Jeremy Irons'
and Patricia Hodge's naturalis
tic performances point up all
the wrong things about the ma
terial, but Ben Kingsley gives a
stunningly complex demonstra
tion of Pinter's message in all
his plays — that human beings
are capable of feeling and in
flicting more injury than words
can chart. Within the limits of
the style Pinter demands, it's a
near-great performance.
Plays Wednesday evening at
7.
Cries and Whispers (1972)
Bishop Auditorium
At the very beginning of In
gmar Bergman's film, the face
of the suffering Harriet An
dersson seems to have been
transformed into a metaphor
for the pain of death; later, the
maternal servant (Kari Sylwan)
holds the dying Andersson to
her breast, in a poignant Pieta.
Cries and Whispers may be im
perfectly acted, schematic, ob
vious on an emblematic level
and elusive on a narrative one,
but it shows Bergman at his
painterly finest — as one of the
greatest of all image makers.
Stunningly shot by Sven Nyk
vist, this is one of the most ex
quisite and most powerful of

his movies. (It is also the one
most clearly inspired by
Strindbcrg, particularly by A
Dream Play.) Andersson, Syl
wan, Liv Ullmann and Ingrid
Thulin play four parts of the
Universal Woman: the sufferer,
the earth mother, the coquette
and the bitch-destroyer.
Plays Wednesday night at
7:30. '
Metropolis (1926)
Haus Mitteleuropa
Utterly lunatic, and amazing.
Fritz Lang set this science
fiction fantasy in the 21st cen
tury, where the working class is
compelled to live out their lives
underground in the service of
the artistocracy. The direction
and production design are
among the most extraordinary
examples known of German Im
pressionism: Karl Freund and
Gunther Rittau shot the
picture. Watching Fang's film is
an overwhelming experience,
because it is ridiculous, assault
ing and brilliant by turns, and
because of the discrepancy be
tween its visual qualities and
the florid, Delsartean acting
(by Brigitte Helm, Gustav
Frohlich, Alfred Abel and
others).
Plays Thursday evening at
7:30.
My Uncle Antoine (1972)
Cubberley Theatre (4000 Mid
dlefield Road), Palo Alto
Canadian director Claude
Jutra offers a series of vig
nettes of Quebec village life,
but they are told with a crisp,
humorous naturalism that
vivifies these sketches and
fuses them into a sort of
chronicle. A marvelous young
actor named Jacques Gagnon
who has the sad, amused eyes of
a juvenile Gabin, plays Benoit, a
quiet, playful boy living with his
aunt and uncle. They run the
general store and the undertak
ing business in town; his uncle
Antoine's profession brings
Benoit face to face with death
at a early age. Jutra has a genius
for casting (and he himself
plays Antoine's assistant, Fer
nand) and he and the photog
rapher, Michel Brault. tell us so
much about these people that
we move into their lives. This is
a great film that might have
been made by Renoir or the
Louis Malle of Murmur of the
Heart. In the most beautiful
and harrowing passage, Benoit
and Antoine take a midnight
sleigh ride with a child's corpse
hitched up to the back of the
vehicle; the drunken under
taker falls asleep and the coffin
slips off the sleigh into the
snow.
Plays Wednesday evening at
8.
