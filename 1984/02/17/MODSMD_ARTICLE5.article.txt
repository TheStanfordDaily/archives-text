# Students protest minority prof's tenure denial
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
More than 100 students rallied
outside of the School of Education
yesterday to protest the recent ten
ure denial of Edmundo Fuenzalida,
professor in the International Devel
opment and Education Program.
The rally was the second held in a
month to protest the School of Edu
cation's actions concerning minority
hiring. At the end of January, 40 stu
dents gathered outside the Educa
tion building to protest what they
believed to be the school's lack of
commitment to bilingual studies
and affirmative action.
Yesterday's rally was slightly dif
ferent than the January protest. Sue
Grant Lewis, chairman of the stu
dent committee of Stanford Inter
national Developmental Education

Committee (SIDEC) and a partici
pant in the rally, said that students
yesterday gathered mainly out of
concern over what they felt to be a
growing lack of diversity in the fac
ulty of the School of Education.
According to Lewis, speakers at
the rally, which was billed as a "Stop
the Trend" rally, discussed three
main issues. "We are concerned that
the students have such a small role in
the tenure decision-making process,"
Lewis said, explaining that students
should be able to provide more infor
mation about a professor's teaching
and advising ablities, which are crucial
factors in considering a professor for
tenure.
Lewis said the rally also focused
on the seeming loss of diversity in
University faculty. The resignation
of Arturo Pacheco. associate dean of

the School of Education and the ten
ure denials of Diana Paul, professor
of religious studies and Fuenzalida
represent a significant loss in
minority faculty.
Lewis stressed that the rally was
"not just a SIDEC rally," because al
though his courses were officially
SIDEC courses, they appealed to all
students in the School of Education.
She also said that the rally was not a
"students against professors"
protest, because most professors in
the Education Department agreed
with the students on the Fuenzalida
issue.
Fuenzalida declined to com
ment on the rally and about whe
ther or not he intends to appeal his
tenure denial, but said that he
"appreciated the attitude of stu
dents verv much."
