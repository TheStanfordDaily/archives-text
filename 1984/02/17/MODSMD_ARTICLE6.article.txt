Campaign consultant Hal Evry. speaking at a panel
discussion last night at Rinconada Lounge on the ef
fects of the media on political elections, said it is easy
for him to manipulate journalists.
Evry. author of "The Selling of a Candidate." told
approximately 40 people that journalists are "•usually
not very smart." and thus he could manipulate them
easily for his own ends. He also said the media served
as an obstacle to his goals because his clients, not
bright enough to know what to say to the press, could
only hurt themselves by saying anything.
As founder and director of the Los Angeles-based
Public Relations Center. Inc.. Evry claims a per
cent success rate in getting his clients elected to
public office.

Evry said money is the decisive factor in campaigns.
"All our candidates are millionaires or we don't
(work with) them.'' he said. "We want them to win."
When asked whether he considered the integrity as
well as the financial status of candidates seeking his
aid. Evry said. • I'm not involved with morality."
Also on the three-man panel were Bob Ryan, na
tional editor of the San Jose Mercury News, and
Sheizai Rafeli. a Ph.D. student in communication.
Ryan concurred with Evry on the growing importance
of money to campaigns, but said he feared politics
will become simply a showdown between millionaires.
He also said the influence of print journalism is
waning as television replaces it.
Rateli said that although the media does affect
public "apathy and alienation." the consumer takes a
more active role today because of new technologies.
