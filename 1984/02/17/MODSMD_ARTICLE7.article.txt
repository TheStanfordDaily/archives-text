Gemayel signs Saudi plan
Washington — Lebanese President Amin Gemayel has
signed a letter agreeing in principle to a Saudi Arabian
sponsored "package" solution to the Lebanon crisis that in
cludes renunciation of Lebanon's May 17 agreement with
Israel on withdrawal of foreign forces, Reagan administra
tion officials said yesterday .
The letter was signed in Lebanon Wednesday and was for
warded to Damascus yesterday for consideration by Syrian
President Hafez Assad and leaders of the Lebanese opposi
tion forces supported by Syria, but it was far from clear
that the formula would be accepted.
Administration officials insisted there had been no direct
American role in negotiating the Saudi proposal, and they
were markedly cool toward it, even though it appears to in
clude many of the objectives U.S. diplomacy has been striv
ing for in Lebanon for more than a year: a cease-fire, a
broadened Lebanese government, withdrawal of Israeli and
Syrian forces and a security guarantee for Israel's northern
border.
At the White House, official spokesmen sought to keep
the Saudi plan at arms length, portraying the Reagan ad
ministration as a bystander in the negotiations. While ac
knowledging that the U.S. government has had "discussions"
with Middle-East countries concerning the proposal, they
said the diplomatic effort was being led by Saudi Arabia.
U.S. supports U.N. force
I nited Nations — Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick told
the Security Council yesterday that the United States sup
ports a U.N. peacekeeping operation throughout Lebanon.
But the "single obstacle" to such an undertaking, she later
told reporters, is Soviet and Syrian opposition.
Kirkpatrick addressed the Security Council on the second
day of debate on the situation in Lebanon. The council then
adjourned, probably until Tuesday, without taking any ac
tion.
Soviet Ambassador Richard Ovinnikov did not address
the council, but when he was asked later about his govern
ment s position on the peacekeeping question, he replied:
"We haven't got anything to chew on yet."
France circulated a working paper on the matter earlier
this week, but there was still no resolution before the coun
cil yesterday. French Ambassador Luc de la Barre de Nan
teuil opened the debate Wednesday with an urgent appeal
for a U.N. peacekeeping force to replace the multinational
lorce of U.S., French. British and Italian troops that has
been in Lebanon since 1982.
British Ambassador John Margetson, apparently
acknowledging that a political struggle is going on behind
the scenes and that there is some fear of a Soviet or U.S.
veto that could block Security Council, proposed that the
United Nations take what action it can immediately, with
out waiting for the Security Council.
U.S. joins Namibia commission
Lusaka. Zambia — Angola, South Africa and the United
States formed a joint commission here yesterday to moni
tor a cease-fire in the guerrilla war along the Angola-
Namibia border.
Formation Of the 'group was announced after a dav-long
meeting of rt'pft.'s'<? nM'five's <>/ the three eauntries a.s [tail
of ;; long-range effort to end the war and arrange indepen
dence for Namibia, a former German colony that has been
governed by South Africa since the end of World War I.
Primarily involved in the fighting are South African
troops opposed to black nationalist fighters intent on
gaining control of Namibia. The insurgents, representing
the South-West Africa People's Organization, known as
SWAPO. are based in southern Angola and are supported by
Angolan and Cuban troops.
The guerrillas were not directly represented at the
Lusaka talks. However, the Angolan and South African
governments had top-level diplomats and military men
present, and U.S. representative Chester Crocker, assistant
secretary of state for Africa, acted as mediator.
Crocker is intent on achieving the Reagan administra
tion's objectives of independence and black rule for
Namibia and the removal of Cuban troops from Angola. He
seeks to extend the present de facto armistice, which began
Jan. 31 and so far has been unmonitored.
In the two-page statement released after the meeting, it
was made clear that the United States had been invited to
participate in the cease-fire monitoring group and that
both South Africa and Angola deemed an American pres
ence necessary. The extent of the U.S. participation was
not disclosed. But it was reported from Washington that
about six U.S. military officers would be involved.
Reagan may retain military aid
through little-known clause
Washington — The Reagan administration is moving
toward use of a little-known section of the Arms Export
Control Act to keep U.S. military aid flowing to El Sal
vador for at least four mote months even if Congress fails
to vote for the assistance.
The basic purpose of the control act is to limit arms sales
abroad. But it also has special provisions for expedited sales
and deferrals of payment in certain circumstances, including
where the president finds that national security is involved.
Officials said the administration is turning toward these
special sections for fear the Salvadoran army may otherwise
run short of supplies, including ammunition, before an un
enthusiastic Congress votes further aid.
The White House is scheduled to send Congress today its
plan for transforming most of the recommendations of the
Kissinger Commission on Central America into law. One of
these recommendations was greatly increased military aid.
Under section 21-D of the control act the administra
tion could "sell" the Salvadorans ammunition and other
supplies now, then give them whatever funds Congress
votes and let them "buy" the arms later. Officials could
not say what would happen if Congress surprised them and
voted no funds at all.
Although foreign aid bills have been notoriously slow of
passage in recent years, administration officials also say
Congress in 120 days will probably have passed foreign aid
legislation that would give El Salvador money with which to
pay for the arms already shipped, as well as for additional
equipment. The administration is asking for $176 million in
military aid for El Salvador for the remainder of fiscal
1984. '
Market shows moderate losses
New York — The stock market recorded some modest
losses yesterday, weighed down again by interest-rate
worries.
Trading was fairly quiet in an erratic session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off more than
10 points after a brief afternoon outburst of selling,
recovered to close at 1154.94. down 3.77 on the day.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slowed to
81.75 million shares from 94.87 million Wednesday.

tion forces supported by Syria, but it was far from clear
that the formula would be accepted.
Administration officials insisted there had been no direct
American role in negotiating the Saudi proposal, and they
were markedly cool toward it, even though it appears to in
clude many of the objectives U.S. diplomacy has been striv
ing for in Lebanon for more than a year: a cease-fire, a
broadened Lebanese government, withdrawal of Israeli and
Syrian forces and a security guarantee for Israel's northern
border.
At the White House, official spokesmen sought to keep
the Saudi plan at arms length, portraying the Reagan ad
ministration as a bystander in the negotiations. While ac
knowledging that the U.S. government has had "discussions"
with Middle-East countries concerning the proposal, they
said the diplomatic effort was being led by Saudi Arabia.
U.S. supports U.N. force
I nited Nations — Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick told
the Security Council yesterday that the United States sup
ports a U.N. peacekeeping operation throughout Lebanon.
But the "single obstacle" to such an undertaking, she later
told reporters, is Soviet and Syrian opposition.
Kirkpatrick addressed the Security Council on the second
day of debate on the situation in Lebanon. The council then
adjourned, probably until Tuesday, without taking any ac
tion.
Soviet Ambassador Richard Ovinnikov did not address
the council, but when he was asked later about his govern
ment s position on the peacekeeping question, he replied:
"We haven't got anything to chew on yet."
France circulated a working paper on the matter earlier
this week, but there was still no resolution before the coun
cil yesterday. French Ambassador Luc de la Barre de Nan
teuil opened the debate Wednesday with an urgent appeal
for a U.N. peacekeeping force to replace the multinational
lorce of U.S., French. British and Italian troops that has
been in Lebanon since 1982.
British Ambassador John Margetson, apparently
acknowledging that a political struggle is going on behind
the scenes and that there is some fear of a Soviet or U.S.
veto that could block Security Council, proposed that the
United Nations take what action it can immediately, with
out waiting for the Security Council.
U.S. joins Namibia commission
Lusaka. Zambia — Angola, South Africa and the United
States formed a joint commission here yesterday to moni
tor a cease-fire in the guerrilla war along the Angola-
Namibia border.
Formation Of the 'group was announced after a dav-long
meeting of rt'pft.'s'<? nM'five's <>/ the three eauntries a.s [tail
of ;; long-range effort to end the war and arrange indepen
dence for Namibia, a former German colony that has been
governed by South Africa since the end of World War I.
Primarily involved in the fighting are South African
troops opposed to black nationalist fighters intent on
gaining control of Namibia. The insurgents, representing
the South-West Africa People's Organization, known as
SWAPO. are based in southern Angola and are supported by
Angolan and Cuban troops.
The guerrillas were not directly represented at the
Lusaka talks. However, the Angolan and South African
governments had top-level diplomats and military men
present, and U.S. representative Chester Crocker, assistant
secretary of state for Africa, acted as mediator.
Crocker is intent on achieving the Reagan administra
tion's objectives of independence and black rule for
Namibia and the removal of Cuban troops from Angola. He
seeks to extend the present de facto armistice, which began
Jan. 31 and so far has been unmonitored.
In the two-page statement released after the meeting, it
was made clear that the United States had been invited to
participate in the cease-fire monitoring group and that
both South Africa and Angola deemed an American pres
ence necessary. The extent of the U.S. participation was
not disclosed. But it was reported from Washington that
about six U.S. military officers would be involved.
Reagan may retain military aid
through little-known clause
Washington — The Reagan administration is moving
toward use of a little-known section of the Arms Export
Control Act to keep U.S. military aid flowing to El Sal
vador for at least four mote months even if Congress fails
to vote for the assistance.
The basic purpose of the control act is to limit arms sales
abroad. But it also has special provisions for expedited sales
and deferrals of payment in certain circumstances, including
where the president finds that national security is involved.
Officials said the administration is turning toward these
special sections for fear the Salvadoran army may otherwise
run short of supplies, including ammunition, before an un
enthusiastic Congress votes further aid.
The White House is scheduled to send Congress today its
plan for transforming most of the recommendations of the
Kissinger Commission on Central America into law. One of
these recommendations was greatly increased military aid.
Under section 21-D of the control act the administra
tion could "sell" the Salvadorans ammunition and other
supplies now, then give them whatever funds Congress
votes and let them "buy" the arms later. Officials could
not say what would happen if Congress surprised them and
voted no funds at all.
Although foreign aid bills have been notoriously slow of
passage in recent years, administration officials also say
Congress in 120 days will probably have passed foreign aid
legislation that would give El Salvador money with which to
pay for the arms already shipped, as well as for additional
equipment. The administration is asking for $176 million in
military aid for El Salvador for the remainder of fiscal
1984. '

Gemayel signs Saudi plan
Washington — Lebanese President Amin Gemayel has
signed a letter agreeing in principle to a Saudi Arabian
sponsored "package" solution to the Lebanon crisis that in
cludes renunciation of Lebanon's May 17 agreement with
Israel on withdrawal of foreign forces, Reagan administra
