Washington — The evacuation of U.S.
Marines from Beirut to ships offshore
will begin "in the next two or three
days" and be completed within 30 days
under a detailed plan President Reagan
intends to approve today, a senior
White House official said yesterday.
About 500 U.S. servicemen will be
left behind to guard the U.S. Embassy
in Beirut and to train what remains of
the Lebanese army, the official said.
The plan was drafted by Defense Sec
retary Caspar Weinberger after five

days of consultations with the em
battled government of Lebanese Presi
dent Amin Gemayel and U.S. allies in
the multinational peace-keeping force
in Lebanon.
The White House official told
reporters that the Marines are not in
danger, although they are surrounded
by Moslem Lebanese rebels. The
Marines' position at Beirut Interna
tional Airport is "not. after all, strate
gic for a taction's influence or future
power," he said, adding that each of the
rebellious Moslem factions "sees value

in avoiding violence over something
that is not essential to their future."
The Pentagon does not consider the
Marines to be surrounded because
"nobody has denied us access to the
beach," Burch said. The militia forces
and the Marines have an "informal ar
rangement" allowing the Americans to
pass through the encircling lines, the
White House official added.
Reports from Beirut yesterday indi
cated that the Marines already are
working around the clock to move their
equipment to the ships offshore. They

"will take everything they own" to the
Sixth Fleet, the White House official
said.
Although the official declined to of
fer an exact timetable tor movement
of the Marines, he said the 30-day
evacuation period would begin today.
Even after being redeployed to the 20-
ship task force oil the Lebanese coast,
the Marines will still be considered part
of the multinational force, the official
said. There are currently about 1200
American servicemen in Beirut, accor
ding to the Pentagon's latest count.
