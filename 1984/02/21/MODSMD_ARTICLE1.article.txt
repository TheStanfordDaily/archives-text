# Maples goes Card-crazy as Stanford stomps UCLA
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The 7550 delirious fans in a sold-out
Maples Pavilion Saturday afternoon know it.
The CBS regional television audience knows
it. And the UCLA Bruins know it.
The Stanford basketball team is for real.
Its 18-8 overall record and seven straight
Pacific-10 Conference wins are no fluke.
Stanford removed the "sur" from surreal
in a single game Saturday afternoon, a 75-64
gem over the once mighty — but now falter
ing — UCLA Bruins, winners of 10 NCAA
titles and 16 Pac-10 crowns in the last 20
years.

When it was over, UCLA headed to the
locker room with a 14-8 overall record, a 7-5
conference mark and its fourth loss in five
games. Meanwhile, the thousands of Stan
ford students on hand for the afternoon
game headed for the Maples Pavilion floor
and turned it into bouncing pandemonium,
complete with "high fives" and the Stanford
Band's "All Right Now."
Technically, the Stanford triumph was not
an upset — the Cardinal was a one-point fa
vorite according to the Las Vegas line on
game day. But the victory was much bigger
than an upset — as big a victory as a Stan
ford basketball team has had since it

defeated Dartmouth, 53-38, in 1942 to win
the NCAA title.
"It was big because it was our 18th win, (it
was) on television, (and it was) against
UCLA," senior center John Revelli said.
Revelli and Keith Jones — the only two
seniors on the young Cardinal team — have
beaten UCLA once before (in 1981), but as
Jones said, the comparison is "no compari
son."
"This one's bigger," Jones replied when
asked which one tasted better. "It means a
lot more. It's going to help us more as far as
recruiting and a possible post-season tourna
ment."

That "possible" can be changed to
"probable." With five games remaining in
the regular season. Stanford is just two vic
tories shy of the magical 20-win mark, an of
fer the National Invitational Tournament
(NIT) would find hard to refuse when it
gives bids to 32 teams next month.
"I know we've got a few wins they can't
take away from us," said Stanford Coach
Tom Davis in reference to his team's post
season tournament chances. "It's just a
question of winning a few more games."
Davis and company travel north to play
last-place Washington State Thursday and
then to first-place Washington Saturday

before returning home for a two-game set
against the Arizona schools. They close out
the regular season March 8 against Oregon in
Eugene.
Although a berth in the NIT seems a good
bet, an invitation to the more prestigious
NCAA tournament is still within reach, al
beit a long shot. Should Stanford win ils
remaining five games — no easy task at all
and third-place Oregon lose one more, it
would finish the league season tied for third
with the Ducks and in an excellent position
to receive a bid from the NCAA if it decides


The Band and the crowd go wild as the Card goes on. Saturday's 75-64 win over UCLA in Maples Pavilion moves the Card one step closer to a post-season tournament bid
to invite three Pac-10 teams.
For now, though. Davis and
his players are content with
beating the Bruins.
"I think we're just con
centrating on winning games,"
Revel Ii said. "Just as long as we
go somewhere (in the post
season)."
How Stanford beat the
Bruins is no mystery. It simply
outplayed them.
The Cardinal was forced to
come from behind in both
halves and it did, creating many
of its own opportunities and
capitalizing on UCLA mistakes
to take the lead for good at
47-45 with 14:39 to play.

UCLA led 43-38 just
minutes earlier, padding a 37-
36 halftime lead with a three
quick baskets. But in a little
over four minutes, Stanford
outscored the Bruins 14-2 and
grabbed a 52-45 lead at the
13:23 mark. Revclli grabbed
control of the game during the
stretch, scoring eight of the
Card's 14 points, including two
three-point plays.
Stanford held its lead for
the next seven minutes, mostly
on the strength of Revclli, who
scored 15 of his 21 points in
the second half. Then UCLA
made its move with 6:53 left
and Stanford ahead 62-57.
UCLA guard Nigel Miguel

hit a driving lay-in to cut it to
three, hut was called for an of
fensive foul. Card forward Earl
Koberlein went to the free
throw line and missed the
front end of the ensuing one
and-one. The Bruins had the
ball back and the chance to
narrow the gap to one.
They got that chance when
Koberlein picked up his fifth
and final foul with 6:39 to go.
However, backup center Brad
Wright duplicated Koberlein's
earlier feat and missed his first
free throw. Two Revelli free
throws and a Bruin basket
later, and it was back to a
three-point Stanford lead at
64-61 with 5:05 on the clock.
Davis had seen enough of the
Bruin comeback efforts and
called a time-out. When the
Card inbounded the ball a min
ute later, it went into Davis'
"The Roll" delay game and iso
lated Jones — who led all
scorers with 23 points — on
the right side of the court.
Jones drove left, then spun
around right and took off for
the basket with Bruin guard
Montel Hatcher in hot pursuit.
Jones scored the lay-in, was
fouled and hit the free throw
to complete the three-point
play and give Stanford a 67-62
advantage with 4:12 to play.
UCLA got desperate at this
point and in effect tried too
hard, taking wild shots and
throwing the ball away in the
closing minutes.
The Bruins got back to
within four at 6S-64 and called
a time-out at the 1:25 mark,
but did not score the rest of
the way. Urged on by the
crowd's chants of "NIT, NIT."
Jones scored an uncontested
lay-in off the UCLA full-court
press and then an assortment
of Card players hit 5-of-6 free
throws to finish off the
Bruins.
"We were unable to get the
breaks we needed to get the
momentum going in our direc
tion," said UCLA Coach Larry
Farmer. "Stanford took advan
tage of its breaks and made
their free throws."
Part of the problem for tal
ler UCLA was its second-half
shooting. After netting 16-of
-2N (57.1 percent 1 ) shots in the
/iist liiif/'. it dou/d only hit ll
of-27 (40.7 percent) in the
second, with most of those

misses coming from the
outside.
"If they would have hit a
couple of more (shots), we
would have (come out of our
zone defense)," said forward
Steve Brown. "But we'd rather
have them beat us from the
outside than from the inside."
Davis attributed the victory
to everyone playing well.
"We've been getting so much
good play from eight guys," he
said. "And I thought Kent
Seymour was an especially big
factor today."
A composed Farmer agreed.
"They play extremely hard,
make their own breaks and give
themselves up for the team.
That's sometimes its important
as running and jumping."
It was on Saturday.

remaining five games — no easy task at all
and third-place Oregon lose one more, it
would finish the league season tied for third
with the Ducks and in an excellent position
to receive a bid from the NCAA if it decides


The Band and the crowd go wild as the Card goes on. Saturday's 75-64 win over UCLA in Maples Pavilion moves the Card one step closer to a post-season tournament bid
to invite three Pac-10 teams.
For now, though. Davis and
his players are content with
beating the Bruins.
"I think we're just con
centrating on winning games,"
Revel Ii said. "Just as long as we
go somewhere (in the post
season)."
How Stanford beat the
Bruins is no mystery. It simply
outplayed them.
The Cardinal was forced to
come from behind in both
halves and it did, creating many
of its own opportunities and
capitalizing on UCLA mistakes
to take the lead for good at
47-45 with 14:39 to play.

UCLA led 43-38 just
minutes earlier, padding a 37-
36 halftime lead with a three
quick baskets. But in a little
over four minutes, Stanford
outscored the Bruins 14-2 and
grabbed a 52-45 lead at the
13:23 mark. Revclli grabbed
control of the game during the
stretch, scoring eight of the
Card's 14 points, including two
three-point plays.
Stanford held its lead for
the next seven minutes, mostly
on the strength of Revclli, who
scored 15 of his 21 points in
the second half. Then UCLA
made its move with 6:53 left
and Stanford ahead 62-57.
UCLA guard Nigel Miguel

hit a driving lay-in to cut it to
three, hut was called for an of
fensive foul. Card forward Earl
Koberlein went to the free
throw line and missed the
front end of the ensuing one
and-one. The Bruins had the
ball back and the chance to
narrow the gap to one.
They got that chance when
Koberlein picked up his fifth
and final foul with 6:39 to go.
However, backup center Brad
Wright duplicated Koberlein's
earlier feat and missed his first
free throw. Two Revelli free
throws and a Bruin basket
later, and it was back to a
three-point Stanford lead at
64-61 with 5:05 on the clock.
Davis had seen enough of the
Bruin comeback efforts and
called a time-out. When the
Card inbounded the ball a min
ute later, it went into Davis'
"The Roll" delay game and iso
lated Jones — who led all
scorers with 23 points — on
the right side of the court.
Jones drove left, then spun
around right and took off for
the basket with Bruin guard
Montel Hatcher in hot pursuit.
Jones scored the lay-in, was
fouled and hit the free throw
to complete the three-point
play and give Stanford a 67-62
advantage with 4:12 to play.
UCLA got desperate at this
point and in effect tried too
hard, taking wild shots and
throwing the ball away in the
closing minutes.
The Bruins got back to
within four at 6S-64 and called
a time-out at the 1:25 mark,
but did not score the rest of
the way. Urged on by the
crowd's chants of "NIT, NIT."
Jones scored an uncontested
lay-in off the UCLA full-court
press and then an assortment
of Card players hit 5-of-6 free
throws to finish off the
Bruins.
"We were unable to get the
breaks we needed to get the
momentum going in our direc
tion," said UCLA Coach Larry
Farmer. "Stanford took advan
tage of its breaks and made
their free throws."
Part of the problem for tal
ler UCLA was its second-half
shooting. After netting 16-of
-2N (57.1 percent 1 ) shots in the
/iist liiif/'. it dou/d only hit ll
of-27 (40.7 percent) in the
second, with most of those

misses coming from the
outside.
"If they would have hit a
couple of more (shots), we
would have (come out of our
zone defense)," said forward
Steve Brown. "But we'd rather
have them beat us from the
outside than from the inside."
Davis attributed the victory
to everyone playing well.
"We've been getting so much
good play from eight guys," he
said. "And I thought Kent
Seymour was an especially big
factor today."
A composed Farmer agreed.
"They play extremely hard,
make their own breaks and give
themselves up for the team.
That's sometimes its important
as running and jumping."
It was on Saturday.

the rest of the Cardinal made all the right moves even when
things were a little up in the air.


Art Streiber/Daily
Not even a basketball-sized sedative could help UCLA's
Kenny Fields who came up with 17 points, but came down
with a losing belly-ache.
The 7550 delirious fans in a sold-out
Maples Pavilion Saturday afternoon know it.
The CBS regional television audience knows
it. And the UCLA Bruins know it.
The Stanford basketball team is for real.
Its 18-8 overall record and seven straight
Pacific-10 Conference wins are no fluke.
Stanford removed the "sur" from surreal
in a single game Saturday afternoon, a 75-64
gem over the once mighty — but now falter
ing — UCLA Bruins, winners of 10 NCAA
titles and 16 Pac-10 crowns in the last 20
years.

When it was over, UCLA headed to the
locker room with a 14-8 overall record, a 7-5
conference mark and its fourth loss in five
games. Meanwhile, the thousands of Stan
ford students on hand for the afternoon
game headed for the Maples Pavilion floor
and turned it into bouncing pandemonium,
complete with "high fives" and the Stanford
Band's "All Right Now."
Technically, the Stanford triumph was not
an upset — the Cardinal was a one-point fa
vorite according to the Las Vegas line on
game day. But the victory was much bigger
than an upset — as big a victory as a Stan
ford basketball team has had since it

defeated Dartmouth, 53-38, in 1942 to win
the NCAA title.
"It was big because it was our 18th win, (it
was) on television, (and it was) against
UCLA," senior center John Revelli said.
Revelli and Keith Jones — the only two
seniors on the young Cardinal team — have
beaten UCLA once before (in 1981), but as
Jones said, the comparison is "no compari
son."
"This one's bigger," Jones replied when
asked which one tasted better. "It means a
lot more. It's going to help us more as far as
recruiting and a possible post-season tourna
ment."

That "possible" can be changed to
"probable." With five games remaining in
the regular season. Stanford is just two vic
tories shy of the magical 20-win mark, an of
fer the National Invitational Tournament
(NIT) would find hard to refuse when it
gives bids to 32 teams next month.
"I know we've got a few wins they can't
take away from us," said Stanford Coach
Tom Davis in reference to his team's post
season tournament chances. "It's just a
question of winning a few more games."
Davis and company travel north to play
last-place Washington State Thursday and
then to first-place Washington Saturday

before returning home for a two-game set
against the Arizona schools. They close out
the regular season March 8 against Oregon in
Eugene.
Although a berth in the NIT seems a good
bet, an invitation to the more prestigious
NCAA tournament is still within reach, al
beit a long shot. Should Stanford win ils
remaining five games — no easy task at all
and third-place Oregon lose one more, it
would finish the league season tied for third

Montel Hatcher in hot pursuit.
Jones scored the lay-in, was
fouled and hit the free throw
to complete the three-point
play and give Stanford a 67-62
advantage with 4:12 to play.
UCLA got desperate at this
point and in effect tried too
hard, taking wild shots and
throwing the ball away in the
closing minutes.
The Bruins got back to
within four at 6S-64 and called
a time-out at the 1:25 mark,
but did not score the rest of
the way. Urged on by the
crowd's chants of "NIT, NIT."
Jones scored an uncontested
lay-in off the UCLA full-court
press and then an assortment
of Card players hit 5-of-6 free
throws to finish off the
Bruins.
"We were unable to get the
breaks we needed to get the
momentum going in our direc
tion," said UCLA Coach Larry
Farmer. "Stanford took advan
tage of its breaks and made
their free throws."
Part of the problem for tal
ler UCLA was its second-half
shooting. After netting 16-of
-2N (57.1 percent 1 ) shots in the
/iist liiif/'. it dou/d only hit ll
of-27 (40.7 percent) in the
second, with most of those

misses coming from the
outside.
"If they would have hit a
couple of more (shots), we
would have (come out of our
zone defense)," said forward
Steve Brown. "But we'd rather
have them beat us from the
outside than from the inside."
Davis attributed the victory
to everyone playing well.
"We've been getting so much
good play from eight guys," he
said. "And I thought Kent
Seymour was an especially big
factor today."
A composed Farmer agreed.
"They play extremely hard,
make their own breaks and give
themselves up for the team.
That's sometimes its important
as running and jumping."
It was on Saturday.

Not even a basketball-sized sedative could help UCLA's
Kenny Fields who came up with 17 points, but came down
with a losing belly-ache.
