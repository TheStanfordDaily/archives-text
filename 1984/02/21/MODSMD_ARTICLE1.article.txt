# Maples goes Card-crazy as Stanford stomps UCLA
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The 7550 delirious fans in a sold-out
Maples Pavilion Saturday afternoon know it.
The CBS regional television audience knows
it. And the UCLA Bruins know it.
The Stanford basketball team is for real.
Its 18-8 overall record and seven straight
Pacific-10 Conference wins are no fluke.
Stanford removed the "sur" from surreal
in a single game Saturday afternoon, a 75-64
gem over the once mighty — but now falter
ing — UCLA Bruins, winners of 10 NCAA
titles and 16 Pac-10 crowns in the last 20
years.

When it was over, UCLA headed to the
locker room with a 14-8 overall record, a 7-5
conference mark and its fourth loss in five
games. Meanwhile, the thousands of Stan
ford students on hand for the afternoon
game headed for the Maples Pavilion floor
and turned it into bouncing pandemonium,
complete with "high fives" and the Stanford
Band's "All Right Now."
Technically, the Stanford triumph was not
an upset — the Cardinal was a one-point fa
vorite according to the Las Vegas line on
game day. But the victory was much bigger
than an upset — as big a victory as a Stan
ford basketball team has had since it

defeated Dartmouth, 53-38, in 1942 to win
the NCAA title.
"It was big because it was our 18th win, (it
was) on television, (and it was) against
UCLA," senior center John Revelli said.
Revelli and Keith Jones — the only two
seniors on the young Cardinal team — have
beaten UCLA once before (in 1981), but as
Jones said, the comparison is "no compari
son."
"This one's bigger," Jones replied when
asked which one tasted better. "It means a
lot more. It's going to help us more as far as
recruiting and a possible post-season tourna
ment."

That "possible" can be changed to
"probable." With five games remaining in
the regular season. Stanford is just two vic
tories shy of the magical 20-win mark, an of
fer the National Invitational Tournament
(NIT) would find hard to refuse when it
gives bids to 32 teams next month.
"I know we've got a few wins they can't
take away from us," said Stanford Coach
Tom Davis in reference to his team's post
season tournament chances. "It's just a
question of winning a few more games."
Davis and company travel north to play
last-place Washington State Thursday and
then to first-place Washington Saturday

before returning home for a two-game set
against the Arizona schools. They close out
the regular season March 8 against Oregon in
Eugene.
Although a berth in the NIT seems a good
bet, an invitation to the more prestigious
NCAA tournament is still within reach, al
beit a long shot. Should Stanford win ils
remaining five games — no easy task at all
and third-place Oregon lose one more, it
would finish the league season tied for third
with the Ducks and in an excellent position
to receive a bid from the NCAA if it decides


The Band and the crowd go wild as the Card goes on. Saturday's 75-64 win over UCLA in Maples Pavilion moves the Card one step closer to a post-season tournament bid
