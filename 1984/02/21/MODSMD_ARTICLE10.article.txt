## Levav: a legitimate authority 
### 
In his viewpoint (Daily, Feb. 13),
Philip Chritton completely distorts
remarks made by Amos Ixnav, pro
viding a prime example of naivete
and misunderstanding of the Israeli
political situation. In his speech,
Levav constructed an "objective
analysis" based on his past six years
of experience as the West Bank cor-

respondent for the leading Israeli
newspaper Maariv. Chritton chooses
to deny Levav's legitimacy as an au
thority on the issue and instead,
gives a set of non-sequitur, absurd in
terpretations of Levav's statements.
Chritton's statement that Levav
is "diagnosing some strange
deficiency among West Bank Arabs"
is ridiculous. By including reference

contention which I dare say no Pales
tinian would deny. Levav is showing a
level ol empathy and understanding
which can only help to ease West
Bank tension.
And while Jewish settlers insist on
their right to establish homes in the
area. Chritton neglects to mention
the case given by in which the
established West Bank settlement

of Alon Moreh was found in viola
tion of an Arab occupant's land
rights and was disassembled and
moved by order of the Israeli Su
preme Court.
In another of his points of
criticism, Chritton appears to have
simply misconstrued Levav's state
ments. While Levav mentions both
Arab-Jewish coexistence and the
Arab stone-throwing incidents, he
never pretends that the two are
compatible. Unfortunately, dem
onstrations and stone-throwing
incidents are frequent events in the
area, which is, as Ixwav reminded his
audience, "an occupied military terri
tory." However, these occurrences
have not prevented numerous cases
in which coexistence has become the
accepted reality, such as the shared
use of electric power lines, another
of IjevaV's exitmples which Chritton
ci>/i\ c /i/'c-zitly cn cr/ooAs. histmicvs of
coexistence such as this provide the
glimmer of hope which so often is ab
sent in analyses of the West Bank
situation.
Chritton saves his most flagrant
distortion for the end of his view
point when he maintains that
seems to be implying
that . . . Americans now ought to
halt imports of Arab oil and/or be

cold in winter to demonstrate a com
mitment to Israel." Instead of such
irrational and sacrificial gestures, Is
rael has sought American assistance
only through the normal, established
governmental channels which all na
tions observe.
Chritton simply refuses to ac
knowledge the reality of the present
Middle East political situation. In an
area of extreme strategic interests,
Israel represents the United States'
most stable, most reliable and only
true ally. Furthermore, Israel is the
sole democracy in the region.
As Levav stated, the situation in
the West Bank is quite unfortunate.
No Arab or Palestinian leader has
ever matched Israel's efforts to
meet at the negotiating table to de
termine the territories' status.
Ixwav's remarks represented a real
istic appraisal of the situation in the
West Bank. Because of his distor
tions of Levav's remarks, Chritton
fails to grasp the main point of the
lecture. Only through empathy and
increased efforts at understanding
on the part of both Israelis and
Arabs can a solution to this distress
ing situation ever be reached.
