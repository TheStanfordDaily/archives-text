# LETTERS
## 'Sold Out' belongs in White Plaza 
### 
1 resent l)a\id Pagel's letter titled
"So this is art" (Daily, Feb. 15). I
resent his labeling ot the 50 Stan
lord artists working on the show as
â€¢"artsy-tartsy types." I resent the
simplistic and reductivist tendencies
of his prose, especially when he goes
as far as to call my group an "insult
to humanity."
SOI .D OUT is a serious attempt
to illuminate the cultural relation
ship between advertising and Ameri
can stK'iety. It is both an attack and
a glorification of an art form that

has served as a catalyst for distribu
tion in our economy.
In my opinion, the make-your
own-nuclear-warhead happening Feb
10 in White Plaza was a far cry from
a "display of creativity's absence."
Rather it was a responsible event
which endeavored to combine art
and life.
By giving people a chance to make
nukes, have their pictures taken
with their nukes and take part in a
multi-media event, we added a di
mension of spontaneity and

"happening" that rarely comes to
life on this campus. More than 1500
people, four TV stations, three
newspapers and three radio stations
witnessed our actions, and I am
proud of that.
I resent Pagel's asking us to "leave
White Plaza free for legitimate
activities." We are a legitimate
organization and will continue to
confront the community.
