# Draft registration is decision time
## 
### 
I got a letter from the Selective Service the
other day.
I know what you're thinking. "He didn't regis
ter. He's a vegetarian and he was probably happy
when John Wayne died. Glad they caught him.
I lope they throw him in the darkest dungeon and
slag the key, pacifist swine."
Well, wrong. I registered. Out of patriotism?
Out of a sense of duty to God. country and my
mother? To be all I could be? Because, it's not
just a job. it's an adventure?
No. it was fear, 112 ive years or $10,000, they
said. Or both.
I thought about that a lot. Five years might
not seem like a long time, but five years ago, I
thought "Gilligan's Island" was a major artistic
achievement, l ive years is almost as long as you
get for killing math professors or San Francisco
mayors. No. live years of banging a tin cup and
doing bad Jimmy Cagney impersonations was not
for me.
Or S 10.000. I could just see myself g«ing up to
my parents and saying. "Can I have $10,000? I've
committed a felony." No. I would have to raise
the money myself. I would probably have to get a
job as a hasher, and that for sure would be bad.
Or both. I always hated the "or both" part.
It's like playing Truth and Dare. One or the other
I could take, maybe, but not both.
But I never forgot that I was doing the less
noble thing. I admired those young men who were
standing up to the S.S.. risking harrassment, pro
secution and talk show appearances. I'm sorry,
but I just can't risk a prison sentence — where
would I keep my record collection? So exactly 30

days after my I Nth birthday, I went down to the
Stanford Post Office and told President Reagan
where I would he in case he wanted to hold
maneuvers in Managua.
That was more than a year ago. The letter I got
was very polite. In fact, it referred to me as Mr.
Naureckas. Perhaps they think that I'm deaf.
The meaning of the letter was clear, however.
They wanted to know if any of the information I
had given them was "incomplete or wrong." I had
always assumed that a healthy ruler-subject rela
tionship was based on trust. But I have to admit
that if I forced people to divulge personal infor
mation by threatening them with fines and im
prisonments. 1 would worry about their honesty,
too. If they ask us twice they might not get the
truth out of us. but they can at least see if we
are lying consistently.
So what,did they want to know? My name:
Was it wrong or imcomplete? Well, they had it as
JAMES KEARNEY NAURECKAS. i thought,
no. only the first letters are capitalized, and I
generally write all three names closer together.
But then again, when they announce who they're
Ogoing to draft, they'll probably say it like that, in
ominous tones, with a long pause before the last
name to build suspense. So I guess that's right.
Selective Service number: 64-1445452-/.
That's 10 digits — enough for 10 billion people.
Just what kind of dratt are they planning
anyway?
Look, guys, if you don't know what my
Selective Service number is. I certainly don't. II
you don't like this one. make up another one.
Sex: M. Do you suppose if I had an operation
tliev wouldn't make me register anymore? F's

don't have to register for the draft but M's
don't have to wear painful shoes or dance hack
wards. It evens out.
My telephone number: I was kind of worried
about gi\ing this out: I didn't want Cap
Weinberger calling me up in the middle of the
night and asking if my refrigerator is running. Or
whatever. I just don't like the idea of the De
partment of Defense actually being able to talk
to me. I was thinking of giving them the number
of Walgreen"s so they can ask for Prince Albert in
a can. I'll bet Cap would like that.
Date ol birth: Actually, I did have this offi
cially changed to Feb. 29. 1964. This makes my
birthday a week from tomorrow. I'm going to be
five. Not only do I not have to worry about the
draft until 2036, but I figured it was my last
chance to be a child prodigy.
Social Security number: This is not important,
as with ni\ new birthdate. I won't be able to col
lect Social Security until 2224.
Current mailing address. This is silly. II this
isn't my mailing address, how could I get their
letter? And these are the same guys that are in
charge of blow ing up Russia.
Permanent address: Uh-oh! So that's what this
is all about. They don't care when my birthday is.
or whether I'm an M or an F — they just want to
know whether I've tried to skip out on them or
not. I"hat's the bottom line: When they come to
take you away, they have to know where to find
you. Well, they can find me at the address they
ha\e listed — i'll be in the basement, underneath
the pool table.

ence. I lis column appears even oilier Tuesday.}
