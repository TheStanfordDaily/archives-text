## Bikers: Proceed with caution 
### 
I almost killed someone on campus
last week. It was a near thing, hut I
was able to avoid it at the last mo
ment. This was not the first time
this sort of thing has happened to me
at Stanford, but I hope it will be the
hist. Somehow. I doubt it will be.
The incident took place at the in
tersection of Campus and Palm
Drives. I was driving on Campus, and
after stopping at Palm and waiting
for the intersection to clear. I
proceeded through the busy corner.

VIEWPOINT

At that moment, a bicyclist shot out
into the intersection directly in
front of me at about 20 miles per
hour, seeming oblivious to the world,
and especially to the heavy morning
traffic all around him. Only by jam
ming on my brakes and swerving be
hind him was I able to avoid hitting
him. He gave me an ugly look and
Hipped me off as he continued down
Palm Drive, as if I had just infringed
his rights.
1 wish I could say this was the first
time I have seen some microcephalic
idiot on a bicycle blatantly ignoring
traffic signals, cars or both. It is not.
On the contrary. I have seen such
demonstrations of utter stupidity
everv sincle dav I have been on this

campus in the almost two years I
have been here.
People on bicycles tly through stop
signs, hands jammed in their pockets
and Walkmans blaring, hardly a
glance cast in any direction to see il
the way is clear, as if they were on a
mission from God. And it is more
than just stop signs. It is every kiixl
of traffic sign and signal in existence,
as I am sure anyone who spends any
amount of time on campus with their
eyes open can attest.
The facts of the matter are vci"y
simple. Bicycles are subject to ex
actly the same rules and regulations
as are automobiles — in the eyes of
California law. they are the same. It

is ;i damn shame that the police. hotli
campus and tow n, do not enlorce the
laws on hic>elists with the same zeal
that they do on automobile drivers.
As ii final note to the bicyclists
out there (aixl I am one myself). you
stand to lose ;i lot more if you are in
volved in a collision with a car than
does the driver of the car. In all prob
ability. the driver of the car would he
uninjured. Bicyclists, on the other
hand, could very well wind up dead,
no matter who was at fault. It is in
the bicyclist's own interest to he \cr\
careful when riding. And ride legalK
— you may live longer.
