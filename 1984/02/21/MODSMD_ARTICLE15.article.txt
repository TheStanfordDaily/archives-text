## Stanford not the same with library 
### 
The Board of Trustees decision to accept the Reagan
library and museum is a great disappointment to me and
as a result I have changed my outlook on Stanford. 1 was
hoping that the University, being such a great place of
learning, would not disregard its impartiality for the
sake of receiving President Reagan's papers.
There are many educational advantages in getting
Reagan's papers but they should not be so blown out ol
proportion as to take precedence over the integrity ol
Stanford. Stanford is already a great university,

VIEWPOINT

however, and acquiring the papers will not make it
greater. The advantages to the local scholars of having
the papers here do not justify the glorification of any
particular ideology. And I mean glorification — for I feel
that Reagan's insistence on having a museum and library
here results from his desire to have his name associated
with the University. Would Reagan still want his papers
at Stanford if there were to be no museum and the
papers were to lie placed in an extension of Cireen Li
brary? It is my belief that such an arrangement would be
unacceptable to the president.
For the sake of the impartiality of any university, and
for the integrity of those who belong to it, a university's

name should never he associated with that of any politi
cal leader.
Presidential papers belong in Washington, D.C., where
they cannot affect the reputation of an institution, and
where historians can consult with them without having
to travel all across the country to different campuses.
In response to my argument, proponents of the
presidential complex might say that I am blinded by my
narrow definition of what a university should represent.
According to them, the Reagan library and museum,
being great educational assets, actually enhance the
reputation of the University. To this I would reply that
the University needs no enhancing of its reputation, and
that an exhibit of Reagan's favorite pen and other
memorabilia is not what I consider an educational experi
ence. I agree that having the presidential papers at Stan
lord would be an educational asset, but at the risk ol
repeating myself, the negative effects of having a build
ing under Stanford's regulation associated with a partic
ular ideology are too important to he ignored.
Since I had no part in the decision, I want no part in its
implications. Although I still greatly value the quality ol
education I am getting here, I am no longer proud of
belonging to the University. I am no longer a Stanford
student, but simply a student at Stanford.
