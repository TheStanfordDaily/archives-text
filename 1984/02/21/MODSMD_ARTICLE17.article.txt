## Stanford professors judge the Beatles 
### THERESA ELLIS 
Twenty years ago, the boys from Liver
pool, England, landed in America at New
York's Kennedy Airport. Greeted by 4000
screaming, teenage fans, they were rushed
through customs to begin a record
breaking tour of the United States.
In 1964, John Lennon, Paul McCartney,
George Harrison and Ringo Starr were tas
ting American life for the first time. To
the Beatles, America was the land of their
idols — Elvis and Chuck Berry — and fol
lowing in their idols' footsteps, they ap
peared on "The Ed Sullivan Show," Feb. 9,
1964. On Feb. 12, the Beatles were the
first rock 'n' roll group to appear at Car
negie Hall, a place previously denied to
both of their idols.

While these firsts marked only the
beginning of the Beatle invasion, the pro
fessors of the Stanford Music Department
were, at the time, not at all amazed by the
Beatle's suaden success.
Professor Albert Cohen, the head of the
Music Department, remembers the arrival
of the Beatles well. "We felt a great deal
of interest," he said. Although he did
not follow the Beatles closely, he was
aware of their popularity. "They were al
ways in the news because they were impor
tant symbols of a certain thrust of
creative interest," said Cohen. "We had to
be receptive."
Yet to others, reception came much
easier. "The Beatles were a social phenome
non," according to Music Prof. Arthur
Barnes, composer for the Stanford Band.

To Barnes, who attended the Beatles'
last concert, Aug. 29, 1966, in San Fran
cisco's Candlestick Park, it was the group's
"original melody and lyrics" which helped
the Beatles to stand out.
"The Beatles' music was up-to-date," he
said. "Their words tended to suggest
music."
But to Barnes, it was not only the music
which boosted the group to the top. "It
was a yeasty time of the "605," he said,
"and it (popularity) was going to happen to
the group with the best advertisement. It
could have been Jefferson Airplane." He
added, though, that "the Beatles were a
lead influence for other groups."
To those outside of the music field,
however, the Beatles influence was not a

stimulus for change but rather a result of
the time.
"It was a period of rapid, extensible
change," according to History Prof. Barton
Bernstein. "They were a young person's
phenomenon," he said, "a continuum of
Elvis."
Historically, he said the 1960s carried
themes of "nihilism" and "social respon
siblity."
"Merchandising is the essence of popular
culture," he added.
While Bernstein was quick to point out
that the Beatles "were not the centerpiece
of the decade," he conceded "in popular
music they were most important."
John Lennon, in his 1980 Playboy inter
view, echoed Bernstein's thoughts. "1 don't
think they (the Beatles) were more impor

tant than Glenn Miller, Woody Herman or
Bessie Smith. It was our generation, that's
all. It was the '605."
Yet to the rest of the world, the Beatles
were much more than Bessie Smith. Until
1967, for instance, the Beatles saw every
one of their singles become a No. 1 hit on
the musical pop charts in both the United
States and England.
"The Beatles," according to Cohen,
"gave a relationship between music and
life."
But Paul McCartney ended this relation
ship between music and life on April 9,
1970. when he announced he was leaving the
Beatles, and the group split up. The Beatle
era was over — only to be remembered in
thoughts and recordings.
