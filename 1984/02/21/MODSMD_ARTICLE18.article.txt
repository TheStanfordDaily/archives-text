# Humanities scholars discuss conception of self

### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
What has happened to the individ
ual in society? Modern pyschology
and philosophy have so dissected and
dissolved the conception of the self
that it has become harder and harder
to define exactly what individuality
means â€” in art. philosophy and
literature.

I Jus weekend, a group of profes
sors from America and Europe met
here to discuss the individual at a
three-day symposium entitled
"Reconstructing Individualism." More
than 20 professors read papers and
more than 200 people attended.
According to planning committee
member David Wellbery, associate

professor of German, many more
came to the symposium than were
expected. "We advertised the con
ference all over the Bay Area," he
said, "and we seem to have drawn
quite a few non-academics as a
result."
The speakers were chosen over a
year ago, Wellbery said, and were
asked to prepare papers on topics

chosen by the planning committee.
"There was no one problem the
speakers were asked to address,
Wellbery said. "Rather, the subject
of individualism addresses several
problems and many different ques
tions."
Topics ranged from "Auto
biography and Allegory" to
"Changing Conceptions of the Self

in Psychoanalysis," and speakers in
cluded Christine Brooke-Rose, a
literature professor at the Sorbonne
in France, and Carol Gilligan, Har
vard education professor and Ms.
Woman of the Year
Wellbery said that the speakers
were chosen on the basis of excel
lence in their disciplines. "Each of
these people are leaders in their

fields," he explained, "and they had
all done work which reflected their
interest in the individual."
Wellberry said that the symposium
had been in the planning stages for
two years. It was orginally the idea of
Anthropology Prof. Michele
Rosaldo. who died in 1981. Wellbery
and others began developing the sym
posium in her memory.
