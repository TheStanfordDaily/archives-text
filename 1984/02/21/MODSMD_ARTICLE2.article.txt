# Res Ed stays firm on alcohol
## 
### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer 
Freshman orientation this year
may have seemed unusual to up
perelassmen who remembered their
orientation parties as being so
replete with alcohol that one fresh
man dubbed his a "summer camp with
beer."
This year, residence staffs made a
highly publicized effort to de
emphasize alcohol during orientation.
Some freshman dormitories held
completely non-alcoholic parties,
most dorms served alcohol in more
moderate quantities than usual and a
prize was given to the resident assis
tants (RAs) who designed the best
theme party which de-emphasized al
cohol.
These efforts were all results of
Residential Education's request that
RAs de-emphasize drinking alcohol
at orientation parties and at all par
ties during the year. Residence st;it!s
were encouraged to center parties
around some activity other than
drinking, including dancing, costume
contests or other themes.
••Students' first campus party
should he a really good time, where
alcohol, if it's present at all. should
not be featured." explained Alice
Supton. assistant dean of Residen
tial Education.
According to Supton. Res Ed is
still promoting policy o! de
emphasizing alcohol.
"We continue to remind people of
the polic\. and to encourage that
people be creative in planning social
events in the houses and that people
do not rely on alcohol to have a good
time," she said.
Res Ed policy requires that equally
attractive non-alcoholic beverages be
served at residence functions
alongside alcohol and that food be
available as well. The policy also re
quires that each residence staff
adopt regulations concerning the use
of alcohol in its own residence.
"We have not had a blanket policy
which says there's to be no alcohol,"
Supton said. "We trust each
residence staff to find an approach
which will work in their circum
stances."
In addition to promoting these
policies, Res Ed has sponsored a num
ber of information sessions through
out the year designed to help RAs
with questions concerning alcohol,
such as their legal liability when pro
viding alcohol to minors and the
problems in approaching excessive
drinkers.
Supton said Res Ed's alcohol policy
is nothing new. "In the last several
years we have been sounding the
same theme," she said.
However, the policy has attracted
more attention this year than in the
past. Perhaps for this reason, some

people feel that this year has seen an
increase in alcohol awareness at Stan
ford.
Andrew Fisher, an RA at Branner
Hall, said that this year "there's a
real emphasis on not making alcohol a
part of people's lives."

Fisher said that Branner's
residence stuff is huving /ess alcohol
this year than in the past. As a
result, damages occurring during par
ties have decreased, he said.

"We haven't had much damage due
to drunkenness. Our damage bills are
down this year," Fisher said.
Supton said that "there is more
awareness of non-alcoholic alterna
tives. When they're not there it's
noticed." She added, however, that
"we have not had as much impact in
fraternities, although they are part
of the residence system."
According to a recent survey of
Stanford students' drinking habits,
one out of every two students drinks
alcohol at least once a week, and one
out of 10 students drinks even more
often.
Despite these statistics, Robin
Hensley, assistant program director
for Residential Education, told The
Daily Thursday that "there is a major
increase in alcohol awareness this
year," and that "Residential Educa
tion's de-emphasis on alcohol has im
proved the student drinking
situation."
However, Mark Mancall. Florence
Moore resident fellow, does not
think the increased alcohol awareness
is due to Res Ed's alcohol policy. In
stead. he said it reflects a change in
the public mood, and that Res Ed's
policy stems from this fchange.
"J think it (drinking) is out of
style," Mancall said. "Hopefully it
will stay out of style. I think it's the
function of Res Ed to convey that."
