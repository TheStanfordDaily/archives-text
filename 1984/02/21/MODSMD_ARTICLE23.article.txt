## AGENT ORANGE — a band & its own brand of pop 
### FRANK BIRD NICOLE FREEMAN 
Over three decades ago it all
began with Hill Haley, to be
followed by Jimi Hendrix, then
the Sex Pistols, and even Duran
Duran. But it's time to put
these trends in the past where
they belong because the time
for Agent Orange has arrived.
Organized about five years
ago, Agent Orange is a trio
consisting of Mike on guitar
and vocals, James on bass and
Scott behind the drum kit.
Their first release was the
single "Bloodstains." Two days
later the song appeared as a cut
on the Rodney on the Roq com
pilation album, which helped it

become an underground an
them. I he next step for Agent
Orange was to record their
debut L.PLiving in Darkness.
on the independent Posh Boy
label. However, their contract
expired, with Posh Hoy releas
ing the Bilchin' Summer E.P. in
an attempt to make as much
money off the band as possible.
So much tor discography.
Once you've gotten down
the basics, though, an inter
view with Agent Orange very
much resembles a three-ring
circus. I hey claim they're from
Pedestria, Calit., located some
where in Orange County; a
town with no streets, no
stoplights and no cars. While
one member may be trying to

describe their music as
"polished pop — hut played
very fast," drummer Scott
would explain to you the things
that really upset him. tor ex
ample, "When you reach for
the last piece of Kleenex in the
box and then the box gets
stuck on your wrist; that
makes me mad." As crazy as
they may seem, these guys
definitely know where they
want to stand in today's music
world. They've just released
what they call their "Whitman
Sampler of Agent Orange."
According to Mike, it was re
corded to show just what
Agent Orange was capable of
doing. They have many more
tunes waiting in the wings that
they hope to record sometime
in February for a new album to
be released sometime in early
summer.
I he new E. P. is entitled
When You Least Expect It . . ~
and is on the tiny
What?/Enigma record label. It
could just as easily have been
called Just When You Needed It

.... The band's blend of a
"polished pop" sound with a
distorted surf guitar effect is
unique in today's world of con
temporary music. As Scott
once said, "Someday they'll
look at this kind of music and
say, "Hey, remember Agent Or
ange? They started all that.' "
Though often associated with
a hardcore punk following, the
band does not see itself as a
leader in this style of music.
However, as a heavily guitar
oriented band, they obviously
cannot be included with
today's synth/pop chart
busters. They believe that
much of the recent success of
heavy metal can be attributed
to the re-emergence of the
guitar as the main musical in
strument.
Scott: Hey Frank. Guess
what?
Frank: What?
Scott: That's what.
Sorry for the typical inter
ruption. If heavy metal can
have a place at the top of the
charts, then it seems that

there should he a place in the
world of success for Agent Or
ange.
But the key to Agent Or
ange's unique blend of pop is
the fact that they are not in it
for success. According to
James, the only reason they're
in the business is because they
love it; they're doing it for the
memories and cannot see a
time in the future when they
will not be playing their special
brand of pop. It is just this at
titude and climate that have
provided Agent Orange with
the opportunity to create the
next wave of contemporary
music.
Oh, and for you groupies in
the audience, Scott wants us
to let you know that his favor
ite color is fluorescent black;
"If you mix all the normal
colors together you get black,
so if you mix all the fluores
cent colors together, you get
fluorescent black. Right?"
Sure, Scott, we follow you
perfectly.
