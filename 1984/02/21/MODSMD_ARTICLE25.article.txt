# 'Milk and Honey' rough, but emotional
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
When John l.ennon and
Yoko Ono were recording
tracks lor the Double Fantasy
album in late I9SO. they ac
cumulated enough rough ma
terial for close to two albums.
In deciding the contents for
their first release in over five
years. l.ennon and Ono decided
to play it "safe" and choose
the softer, simpler and more
straightforward tunes. They
reasoned that they needed an
"easier" album for re
introduction into the public
and held oft from experiment
ing too far from the main
stream. The album, which was
released as Double Fantasy in
November of 19N0, was just to
be a warm, friendly and pleas
ant "starting over" (as the al
bum's preview single was
entitled), and it was. However,
the extra material left over
from the sessions was sup
posedly more experimental
along with being harder, har
sher and wittier. This material,
therefore, was intended to be
included on a follow-up album
to be entitled Milk and Honey,
which after various re
recordings, overdubbings and
remixings, was to be released
next summer. This. then, would
be ideal for the second step of
their reintroduction as they
didn't have to play it "safe"
(as the initial release. Doable
Fantasy, had to), and so could
take more chance in introduc
ing the brasher and complexer
forms of music they intended
to pursue in the future.
However, tragically, this plan
was never accomplished. With
John Lennon's murder on Dec.
N. Double Fantasy
became Lennon's epitaph. It
was ironic that for a man who
fought so hard to come to
terms with his own anger, con
tusion. hypocrisy, sexism and
fame, he should be killed at a
time when he had finally as
sembled a collection of songs
that truly showed him to be in
the midst of love, happiness
and inner peace. It was ironic
that Lennon, who now was
"starting over" with a new
vitality and honesty, was to be
denied this new musical vision.
This all. of course, made a
great impression on the public
as was observed in the massive
oh //irtffi iriy"■ V) T firii'l' nrici
respect. However, presently,
on musical terms, it leads to
one of the main problems in
trying to critically analyze the
follow-up album. Milk and
Honey, which after three and a
half years has finally been
released. As this is the first
posthumous Lennon release, it
is especially hard to evaluate
because one doesn't know ex
actly if these tracks were to be
left in the forms in Which they
have been released. For the
most part, the six "new" Len
non songs on Milk and Honey
(the other six are Yoko's con
tributions. which like Double
Fantasy, is equally divided be
tween the two) are quite rough
and loose. The songs contain
numerous witty asides, dirty
ad-libs, countdowns and jumps
into his falsetto, many of

which, undoubtedly. would
have been cut out and re
recorded. Other potential
problems in dealing with these
songs are that it is possible
that L.ennon was displeased
with these tracks and would
have completely rearranged
them, or maybe. these songs
were only the " weak leftovers"
from the early sessions and
that he had far-better materi
al stored away just waiting to
be recorded.
However, these questions
are unanswerable. and.
therefore, one must accept the
album as it is. Thankfully,

Yoko has not "cleaned up" or
re-recorded any of the materi
al. It is left in its initial state
so what one has is pure and
true Lennon (a statement that
sadly cannot be applied to Jimi
Hendrix's posthumously
released material which has;
been disrespectfully and unap-
/ >rapri.l }y rf-rccordcd and
edited). But what about the
material? How does Milk and
Honey rate?
Personally. I feel that Milk
and Honey is better than
Double Fantasy because it is
more adventurous and sounds
more emotionally intense.
Double Fantasy lacked a gritti
ness that Lennon has always
tried to convey, and therefore,
except for "I'm Losing You"
and "Clean-up Time," Double
Fantasy was just slightly too
nice. Milk and Honey, on the
other hand, is full of grit,
sweat and dirt. Furthermore,
whereas on Double Fantasy it
was Yoko's music which was ex
perimental and up-tempo (and
quite good if one took the
time to objectively listen to
it), on Milk and Honey Yoko
takes far less chances, while

l.ennon emerges as the musical
wi/ard. In fact. Yoko's songs
lack much of the hard
rock disco potency that they
displayed on Double Fantasy
(i.e.. "Kiss Kiss Kiss" and "Give
Me Something"). and
therefore, they are not as good
couterpieces to l.ennon's songs
as they were on Double Fan
tasy .
Therefore, it is Lennon's
contributions that must be the
crux of this review. His si\
songs are all excellent and are
all hard-edged. His playing
(along with that of the fine
group of musicians who also

played on Double Fantasy) is
exciting, while his vocals are
brilliant. Above all. the songs
are, lyrically, some of the
strongest he has done, rating
with those from the John Len
non /Plastic Ono Band and Im
agine albums.
The album's opening side
features the harder rockers <>/
his new material. The album
leads off with a funky,
propulsive rocker called "I'm
Steppin' Out" on which Len
non hysterically ad-libs at the
beginning, "This is the story of
a house-husband who just had
to get out of the house ... He
was watching Sesame Street
. . . and was going crazy." The
song, besides being one of his
wittiest, sounds surprisingly
like Jackson Browne's recent
hit, "Lawyers In Love"
(although Lennon recorded
this song about three years
before Browne recorded his —
now you figure that one out!).
This tune is followed by an
electrifying Chuck Berry-style
blazer called "I Don't Wanna
Face It." Sporting a drum beat
and rhythm that is close to the
Beatle's "Get Back" along

with .1 burning guitar solo. "I
Don't Wanna I ace It" crashes
along 111 classic roller coaster
fashion. It is. in fact. Lennon's
most straightforward rocker
since "New York |l > (from
erratic .Sometime in
N.Y.C. album). In addition,
this song's straightforwardness
is not just limited to its musi
cal content alone. 1 yrieally. it
is one ot Lennon's most honest
and direct statements as well
— "Say you're look in' for a
world of truth. tr\ing to find a
better way I he time lias finally
come to see yourself: you al
ways look the other way ."

Lennon's last cut on side one
is the single, "Nobody Told
Me," which is similar to "(Just
Like) Starting Over" in terms
of mood and pop-energy. As
such, it is a perfect single,
which is not hurt at all by the
wickedly humorous lines
throughout the song
("Everybody's smoking and no
one's getting high"). Musically,
it is fascinating sincc it reminds
the listener of the Beatles
(circa 1965). especially in the
guitars that strum during the
choruses (1 swear I hear
"You're Gonna Lose That
Girl" in there!).
Side two, although softer in
raucousness, is still just as en
ticing and enlivening. The first
two songs by Lennon,
"Borrowed Time" and
"(Forgive Me) My L.ittle
Flower Princess," both display
interesting syncopations and
percussive effects. "Borrowed
Time" is a reggae-powered
soulful number that features
one of Lennon's greatest vo
cals ever (yes, I said "ever,"
meaning "ever, including the
Beatles"). In this song, Lennon
poignantly professes opposite

feelings to whiit lie once voiced
in the Beatles' "Help. In
"Help." I.ennon longed tor Ins
younger days when lie "nexer
needed anybody's help in any
wax." However. 011 "Borrowed
lime." he lias aged gracefully
and thoughtfully. and thus. 111
reflecting upon his youth. lie
realizes he was "living confu
sion and deep despair. . . . lull
of ideals and broken dreams."
He. therefore, can only now. in
his older age. appreciate his
finding ol true loxe and peace.
"(Forgive Me) Nix Little
flower Princess." which could
he directed at Yoko or Paul
McCartney. for that matter, is
a poetic sequel to "Woman"
from the Double fantasy al
bum. Ilowexer. unlike
"Woman." "flower Princess" is
full of weird syncopations,
cross-rhythms and Hastern ef
fects. Interestingly. it
resembles Dux id Bowie's
"China Girl." which is ex en
made more ex i dent with the
Eastern nuances thrown in
(just so 1 don't get anx "You're
Wrong, Mr. Jones" mail. Bowie
wrote "China Girl" with and
for Iggy Pop in the late iy7()s,
so it was easily available for
Lennon to "tribute" if he so
desired). To further its experi
mental nature, it features a
cool jazz guitar solo as it fades
out as well.
For his final contribution,
though, we are presented with
a cassette recording of a song
that Lennon had planned to
turn into a "standard" with
horns and symphony. However,
he never was allowed the
chance, so this cassette version
is all that remains of "Grow
Old With Me." Like
"Imagine," "Grow Old With
Me" is a gorgeous ballad which
pits Lennon's aching voice
against a lone piano and steady
beat (supplied by a "rhythm
box," as Yoko calls it). It is also
similar to "Imagine" in theme,
as well, as it is a song of hope
which, in this case, extols the
virtues of a loving relationship
as it ripens and grows over the
years. "Grow old along with
me, the best is yet to be/When
our time has come, we w ill be as
one. God bless our love," he
sings, and so ironically tragic is
the song, that the sen
timentality it evokes may bo
quite unbearable at first to
the listener.
As for Yoko's music, as I've
previously mentioned, I feel
that her work on Milk and
Honey lacks the power and ten
sion that her Double Fantasy
contributions contained.
Therefore. Milk and Honey is
all that it was meant to be in
regard to John Lennon. It is
one of his finest collections of
songs, one that is beautiful, ex
citing, emotional, laughable
and loving, all in one. It's a pity
that lie can never share his mu
sical visions with us anymore
because, if Milk ami Honey was
just the beginning stage, who
knows where he would have
lead us. I, too, would have
loved to grow old with him and
his music. I still miss him.
