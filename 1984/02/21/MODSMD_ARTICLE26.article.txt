I lie 11 \c Bay Area musicians that make lip Alive! would
have had a difficult time choosing a more appropriate name
for their group — one gets the immediate impression from
their music that they are definitely Alive! I'hey've heen to
gether for seven years as a ja// ensemble. and during that
time they've proven their competency with the mam styles
that *'ja//" encompasses. City Life, their third album as a
group and the lirst on their recentlv established label.
Alive! Records, is a good example of this flexibility.
City Life is an effective mix of original compositions and
cover versions of ja// standards. Vocalist Rhiannon sparkles
on the title track, her frantic four-minute tribute to the
morning routines, traffic travails and non-stop pace of lite
in the big city. Pianist Janet Small and percussionist Carolyn
Brandy create an ethereal world in "Diamonds Are Where
Vou Find Them" and Small's optimism come through on
"What is Life" and "Happy Ending." Alive! does very well
with Miles Davis* "Four" and Cedar Walton's "Afreaka."
Alive! will probably receive more and more attention in
the male-dominated world of ja// simply because they are
an all-female ensemble — hopefully, people won't overlook
the fact that they are very talented musicians.

The Ethiopian Dread is 25-year-old Henok Assefa, ;i
native Ethiopian who left the country at an early age — he
found reggae music during his travels through the Middle
East ;ind Europe. Rasta Liberty is the first album released bv
this young man and. as one might expect from a debut
work, it pays homage to the major themes ol ras
tafarianism and reggae. "Give Thanks to Bob" is a tribute
to the contributions of the late Bob Marley; •"Ethiopia" is
a recognition of the Ethiopian Dread's native land. "We
Don't Need the System" is an attack on institutionalized
oppression and an appeal for all to take control of their
own lives — "We don't need no leaders/we don't need no
judge/ftll wo is j:ih j:ih love."
The role ot the bass guitar in reggae is well known, and
Iraka Reid is more than competent at providing the
backbone for Rasta Liberty. Horns are prominent on the al
bum as well; the horn section features alto saxophone,
trumpet and trombone. The Ethiopian Dread produced, ar
ranged and wrote the material for Rasta Liberty — his
debut album is hopefully just a taste of things to come
from a young new artist in the reggae world.
