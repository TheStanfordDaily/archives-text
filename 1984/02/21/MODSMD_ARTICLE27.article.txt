## Bruins can't keep up with this Jones 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
It's hard to keep up with
the Joneses, especially when
it's senior Stanford guard
Keith Jones.
Jones, who had been
averaging 19.3 points a
game coming into Satur
day's game against UCLA,
had another fine afternoon,
scoring 23 points to lead all
scorers in the Stanford vic
tory.
Jones performed so well
that he was named the
Pacific-10 Co-Player of the
Week, along with Oregon
State's Charlie Sitton. In
the combined two games
against USC (Thursday) and
UCLA, Jones had 43 points,
four rebounds, three assists
and five steals.
Leading Stanford to vic
tory over UCLA is not a
new experience for Jones.

As a freshman, Jones mas
terminded a Stanford vic
tory over the Bruins but
nrrordi no to lone* the two
victories don't have much in
common.
"It's just not much of a
comparison." Jones said
about the two victories over
the Bruins. "It's bigger. It
means a lot more (than
freshman year). It's our
seventh conference win in a
row and our 18th victory
this season. Freshman year
we were going nowhere."
The last time the Car
dinal beat the Bruins
(19K1), Stanford finished
the season at just 9-1S in
another one of its go
nowhere seasons. This time,
the Cardinal entered the
contest at 17-8, 6-6 in the
Pac-10. posting six straight
conference victories after a

UCLA's Ralph Jackson (No. 3) had his hands full with
Stanford's Keith Jones as Jones zeroed in on the hoop
, for 23 points and led the Cardinal, to its second win
over the Bruins during his tenure.
rocky start. UCLA, on
other hand, was 14-7, 7-4 in
the Pac-10, and was coming
off three straight losses at
Pauley Pavilion.
Something else was dif
ferent about the victory. It
was not an upset. Jones said
before the game that if
UCLA won. it would be an
upset.
Jones was nothing short
of sensational. He easily
split the UCL.A zone and
according to Bruin Coach
Larry Farmer was one of the
primary reasons why UCLA
switched back to its man
to-man defense after
playing some zone in the
first half.
But Jones' point total
does not tell the whole
story. Jones, along with
senior center John Re veil i.
not only provided more than
half of Stanford's scoring,
but also provided leadership
for the Cardinal in the
closing minutes â€” and the
point was not lost on Bruin
Coach Farmer.
"Stanford has two guys

(Jones and Revelli) who are
among the best players in
the conference," Farmer
said. "They are both classy
guys both on and off the
court."
Stanford Coach Tom
Davis was impressed Satur
day by Jones' passing, espe
cially the way he dished off
when he was closed off in
the lane.
"Instead of trying to
force the ball. Keith passed
the ball off." Davis said.
"I've been concentrating
on that (not forcing the
ball)," Jones said. "I try to
drive in there, but if I'm off
balance, rather than shoot
ing, 1 tried to pass the ball
off."
Jones has a history of
playing well against the best
competition. Since fresh
man year when Jones
thoroughly frustrated
UCLA All-America guard
Rod Foster. Jones has been
at his best in the tough
games.
"That (getting up for the
big games) is a sign of a
great player." Davis said
after the game. "1 don't
think that Keith has even
started to reach his peak
yet."
Jones, however, disagreed

with the big game theory.
"That would imply that I
only get up for the big
games," he said. "It's prob
ably that the other guys on
the team expect more from
me in the big games. They
look to the seniors."
Jones, who looks to have a
lock on All-Conference
honors and has a chance to
be an All-American, is also
closing in on several Stan
ford records. He has 506
points already this year and
with five games left to play
needs just 47 more to break
the single-season scoring
record of 553 that he set
last year. Jones also has
1403 career points, placing
him eighth on the all-time
list in that category. Rich
Kellv is in seventh place
with'l4 12.
Following the season,
Jones will be one of the few
Stanford players in recent
history who can look ahead
to the NBA with any realis
tic chance of success.
Yet one thing is for cer
tain. Jones has impressed a
lot of people at Stanford
and has earned more than a
little respect at UCLA.
Any UCLA player will at
test to that.
