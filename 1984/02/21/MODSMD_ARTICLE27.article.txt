## Bruins can't keep up with this Jones 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
It's hard to keep up with
the Joneses, especially when
it's senior Stanford guard
Keith Jones.
Jones, who had been
averaging 19.3 points a
game coming into Satur
day's game against UCLA,
had another fine afternoon,
scoring 23 points to lead all
scorers in the Stanford vic
tory.
Jones performed so well
that he was named the
Pacific-10 Co-Player of the
Week, along with Oregon
State's Charlie Sitton. In
the combined two games
against USC (Thursday) and
UCLA, Jones had 43 points,
four rebounds, three assists
and five steals.
Leading Stanford to vic
tory over UCLA is not a
new experience for Jones.

As a freshman, Jones mas
terminded a Stanford vic
tory over the Bruins but
nrrordi no to lone* the two
victories don't have much in
common.
"It's just not much of a
comparison." Jones said
about the two victories over
the Bruins. "It's bigger. It
means a lot more (than
freshman year). It's our
seventh conference win in a
row and our 18th victory
this season. Freshman year
we were going nowhere."
The last time the Car
dinal beat the Bruins
(19K1), Stanford finished
the season at just 9-1S in
another one of its go
nowhere seasons. This time,
the Cardinal entered the
contest at 17-8, 6-6 in the
Pac-10. posting six straight
conference victories after a

UCLA's Ralph Jackson (No. 3) had his hands full with
Stanford's Keith Jones as Jones zeroed in on the hoop
, for 23 points and led the Cardinal, to its second win
over the Bruins during his tenure.
