# Cardinal drops 3 of 4: Reno a bad gamble, Gauchos no siesta
## 
### ROB ZWEIG DAVE DUTCHER 
The University of Nevada at
Reno had a successful season
debut at the Cardinal baseball
team's expense, defeating
Stanford 5-1 and capping a
mixed weekend for the Card.
I he Cardinal (9-N) could not
muster an attack off Reno's
Pat Dougherty. who held Stan
lord to five hits in seven in
nings. When it got on base, the
Card could not advance run
ners. hitting into two double
plays and raising its season
total to 24 in 17 games.
The loss overshadowed a
good offensive performance by
Pete Stanicek. who drove in
Mark Machtoll for Stanford's
lone run and had four of the
Card's six hits in four at-bats
and improved his average to
.333. Stanicek has had six hits
in his last two games.
Pour Stanford pitchers tried
to shut down Nevada-Reno,
but were hindered by the Car
dinal's three errors, one of
which led to a run. Seth Bland
took the loss.
On Saturday, after being
outscored 13-3 and losing the
first two games of a three
game series against unbeaten
1 C-Santa Barbara, the Stan
lord baseball team was again
staring into the face of defeat.
As has been the case all too of
ten in the young 1984 season,
the Cardinal offense was stuck
in neutral and begging for help.
The help came from a most
unlikely source, senior catcher
I \ le Smith. Smith, only 2 for
22 at the plate before the

I ( SB series, cracked a leadott
double to ignite a four-run ex
plosion m the third inning and
followed with a fourth inning
single that began another tour
run outburst to lead Stanford
to an (S-5 victory in the series
finale.
Normally known tor his de
fensive prowess. Smith had his
finest offensive series as a col
legian with a startling 5 for ft
performance during the three
games.
"Pyle Smith sparked us
today." observed teammate
Mark Davis, whose four RBIs
in Saturday's second game
didn't hurt either. "The way
we were going we didn't care
who got us going."
Davis capped the third
inning rally with a three-run
home run off losing pitcher
Brad Kenney (2-1) to put the
Cardinal ahead to stay at 4-2.
The blast over the center-field
wall was Davis' second ot the
year and only the club's fifth,
something Davis attributes in
part to players trying too hard
to fill the void left by the
graduation of power hitters
Eric Hardgrave and Mike
Aldrete.
"That's just a little flash of
what we're capable of doing,"
said the sophomore outfielder.
"We noticed that all of our
power was gone and that might
have been part of our problem.
We can't worry about home
runs, it's been putting me in a
slump."
All of a sudden, it seemed
that the line drives were finally
falling as base hits instead of

into opponents gloves, and the
Card jumped at the opportu
nity while it lasted. Smith.
Pete Stanicek and Mike
Dcßcnon all stroked two-out
singles to load the bases in the
fourth. Dairy I Stephens
coaxed a walk from reliever
Barry Dacus to force in one
run. Rick Pundblade then
added a two-run single to make
it 7-2 and Davis completed the
rally with a run-scoring single
of his own.
Junior left handcr Jeff Bal
lard. who bailed out starter
Steve Cottrell in the third,
chalked up Ins Inst win ol the
vear against one loss. Ballard
weathered two Gaucho come
back bids before the contest
was called after live and one
half innings due to darkness.
The win lifted Stanford to
9-7 before yesterday's loss to
Nevada-Reno and snapped a
school-record string of vic
tories for UCSB. now 12-1.
Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess was. in the least,
relieved by his offense's resur
gence. "I was really happy the
way we came back in the second
game," he said. "The kids
showed a lot of character.
Everything has been going
against us lately. They could've
just thrown in the towel, but
they didn't and I'm really
proud of them."
Everything sure went against
the Card in the first game of
the double-header as its nor
mally solid pitching staff
crumbled. Starter Kevin

kunkcl (1-3) had Ins first bad
outing ol the season as the
(jauclios raked him lor seven
runs in just three innings ol
VV Oik.
I CSB was ahead 3-d after
three innings and virtually
ended the contest hv collecting
eight hits and seven runs in the

In contrast, the series opener
on I riday was a pitcher's duel in
which the Gauchos and south
paw George Bonilla (3-0)
prevailed 2-0. Bonilla threw
smoke for nine innings, hurling
a six-hitter and striking out
live. The shutout was the first
time Stanford had not scored
in 3 I games, dating back to a 2-

0 loss :>t Arizona State last
April 22. In fact, the Cardinal
failed to advance a runner
beyond second base against
Bonilla.
In defeat. Brian Myers (1-2)
looked more like the Myers ot
old. giving up two runs while
pitching live strong innings.

"Thiit's prohabl) the hest lie s
pitched tli i > \ ear." said
Marquess. "It >ou hold the
team to two runs. usiuilln
that's enough. But we've got
to put some runs on the
hoard."

out of a season-long slump, but the Cardinal still sputtered,
losing two out of three to the Gauchos and another one to
the University of Nevada at Reno.
The University of Nevada at
Reno had a successful season
debut at the Cardinal baseball
team's expense, defeating
Stanford 5-1 and capping a
mixed weekend for the Card.
I he Cardinal (9-N) could not
muster an attack off Reno's
Pat Dougherty. who held Stan
lord to five hits in seven in
nings. When it got on base, the
Card could not advance run
ners. hitting into two double
plays and raising its season
total to 24 in 17 games.
The loss overshadowed a
good offensive performance by
Pete Stanicek. who drove in
Mark Machtoll for Stanford's
lone run and had four of the
Card's six hits in four at-bats
and improved his average to
.333. Stanicek has had six hits
in his last two games.
Pour Stanford pitchers tried
to shut down Nevada-Reno,
but were hindered by the Car
dinal's three errors, one of
which led to a run. Seth Bland
took the loss.
On Saturday, after being
outscored 13-3 and losing the
first two games of a three
game series against unbeaten
1 C-Santa Barbara, the Stan
lord baseball team was again
staring into the face of defeat.
As has been the case all too of
ten in the young 1984 season,
the Cardinal offense was stuck
in neutral and begging for help.
The help came from a most
unlikely source, senior catcher
I \ le Smith. Smith, only 2 for
22 at the plate before the

I ( SB series, cracked a leadott
double to ignite a four-run ex
plosion m the third inning and
followed with a fourth inning
single that began another tour
run outburst to lead Stanford
to an (S-5 victory in the series
finale.
Normally known tor his de
fensive prowess. Smith had his
finest offensive series as a col
legian with a startling 5 for ft
performance during the three
games.
"Pyle Smith sparked us
today." observed teammate
Mark Davis, whose four RBIs
in Saturday's second game
didn't hurt either. "The way
we were going we didn't care
who got us going."
Davis capped the third
inning rally with a three-run
home run off losing pitcher
Brad Kenney (2-1) to put the
Cardinal ahead to stay at 4-2.
The blast over the center-field
wall was Davis' second ot the
year and only the club's fifth,
something Davis attributes in
part to players trying too hard
to fill the void left by the
graduation of power hitters
Eric Hardgrave and Mike
Aldrete.
"That's just a little flash of
what we're capable of doing,"
said the sophomore outfielder.
"We noticed that all of our
power was gone and that might
have been part of our problem.
We can't worry about home
runs, it's been putting me in a
slump."
All of a sudden, it seemed
that the line drives were finally
falling as base hits instead of

into opponents gloves, and the
Card jumped at the opportu
nity while it lasted. Smith.
Pete Stanicek and Mike
Dcßcnon all stroked two-out
singles to load the bases in the
fourth. Dairy I Stephens
coaxed a walk from reliever
Barry Dacus to force in one
run. Rick Pundblade then
added a two-run single to make
it 7-2 and Davis completed the
rally with a run-scoring single
of his own.
Junior left handcr Jeff Bal
lard. who bailed out starter
Steve Cottrell in the third,
chalked up Ins Inst win ol the
vear against one loss. Ballard
weathered two Gaucho come
back bids before the contest
was called after live and one
half innings due to darkness.
The win lifted Stanford to
9-7 before yesterday's loss to
Nevada-Reno and snapped a
school-record string of vic
tories for UCSB. now 12-1.
Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess was. in the least,
relieved by his offense's resur
gence. "I was really happy the
way we came back in the second
game," he said. "The kids
showed a lot of character.
Everything has been going
against us lately. They could've
just thrown in the towel, but
they didn't and I'm really
proud of them."
Everything sure went against
the Card in the first game of
the double-header as its nor
mally solid pitching staff
crumbled. Starter Kevin

kunkcl (1-3) had Ins first bad
outing ol the season as the
(jauclios raked him lor seven
runs in just three innings ol
VV Oik.
I CSB was ahead 3-d after
three innings and virtually
ended the contest hv collecting
eight hits and seven runs in the

In contrast, the series opener
on I riday was a pitcher's duel in
which the Gauchos and south
paw George Bonilla (3-0)
prevailed 2-0. Bonilla threw
smoke for nine innings, hurling
a six-hitter and striking out
live. The shutout was the first
time Stanford had not scored
in 3 I games, dating back to a 2-

0 loss :>t Arizona State last
April 22. In fact, the Cardinal
failed to advance a runner
beyond second base against
Bonilla.
In defeat. Brian Myers (1-2)
looked more like the Myers ot
old. giving up two runs while
pitching live strong innings.

"Thiit's prohabl) the hest lie s
pitched tli i > \ ear." said
Marquess. "It >ou hold the
team to two runs. usiuilln
that's enough. But we've got
to put some runs on the
hoard."
Stanford will pla\ UC-Da\is
tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.


Stanford's Lyle Smith proved that you can't keep a good man
down, but also proved that one man does not make a team.
