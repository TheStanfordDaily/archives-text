Moonshine photography
Daily photographer Art Streiber climbed atop Durand building Friday night to take a time-exposure
photo of Hoover Tower and the full moon, but he ended up with more. The picture includes an
airplane — the trail of lights left of the tower — and another moon — actually a reflection in the
camera's lens — right of the tower. The next full-moon opportunity for artsy photographs and roman
tic midnights in the Quad comes Saturday, March 17.
