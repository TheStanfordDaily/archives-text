# Bruin women fluster Card again

### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Stanford women's basketball Assistant
Coach Michael Kehoe tried to analyze the
maturing process of the young Cardinal
team after a 6S-4S loss to UCLA in Pauley
Pavilion Friday night. "It can be madden
ing sometimes," he said. "Once again we
didn't play a full 40 minutes. That's part
of what you run into with a young team."
Certainly with a nucleus of seven fresh
men and sophomores the future looks
good, but in the meantime Kehoe and the
rest of the Stanford staff have to wonder
when the Card is going to keep its inten
sity for a full game and knock off a
WCAA team like I'CI A. The loss was
Stanford's ninth straight in the confer
ence and dropped its record to 4-19 on the
vear.

Stanford opened the contest by holding
UCLA scoreless for nearly five minutes,
but in that time the Card could only
manage one basket of its own and led the
Bruins 2-0. Kehoe said. "We played great
defense, but on offense we couldn't put
the ball in the Pacific Ocean."
UCLA finally did get on track. Stanford
stopped the Bruins' transition game, hut
UCLA then set up its half-court offense
and got some hot outside shooting to lead
29-IS at halftime. "Our transition was
good, " Kehoe said, "but they shot the
eyes out of the basket."
In the second half, Stanford managed to
cut the Bruin lead to seven on several oc
casions. hut tlie Card could mil mumhrin
the intensity needed to pull even. Stan
ford was in foul trouble for much of the
half and sophomore center Sarah Evans

and freshman forward Karon
Goodewaagen both fouled out.
UCI.A was led by its Dutch connection
of freshman center Annette Kent and
senior forward Marja Van Helvoort. Both
finished with IIJl l J points, and keui pulled
down a game-high 13 rebounds.
On the Stanford side, junior forward
Mary Bradach, who had had only three
points the first time the teams met,
scored 16 points to lead the Cardinal and
pulled down six rebounds.
Stanford sophomore guard Virginia
Sourlis and Evans both had sub-par perfor
mances, however. "Virginia and Sarah both
had a difficult night," Kehoe said. Both
harl come into contort :<vÂ«sr:iuinn ou-er
13 points a game to lead the Cardinal, but
Evans had only five points, while Sourlis
was held to four.
