# Matmen lose to San Luis Obispo
## 
### PETER CASTILLO 
In its final wrestling dual meet of the
season Friday, Stanford was crushed by a
better-manned Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
team, 33-8.
The Cardinal finished the season with a
disappointing 5-15 record, but has a chance
to redeem itself at the Pacific-10 Cham
pionships on Sunday.
"1 feel great on how well our
lightweights wrestled, but not so good
about the heavyweight performances,"
Stanford Coach Chris llorpel said. "It has
been tough to lose eight matches by three
or less points, but a real sign of the team's

progress is it we can take third at the Pac
-10 Championships."
Jeff Bradley (134 pounds) turned in an
other great performance as he won easily
14-1. In the past month Bradley has im
proved his technique and has shown con
stant improvement. Bradley is peaking at
the critical time before the champion
ships.
The Cardinal had one sweet victory for
Horpel when Pete Rogers (150 pounds)
defeated the Mustangs' Eric Osborne 9-6.
Osborne was highly recruited by Horpel
last year and was planning to attend Stan
lord before changing his mind at the end

of the summer. With only 40 seconds
remaining in the match Rogers scored a
two-point takedown to break a fi-fi tie.
Scott Wiggen (142 pounds) wrestled
well, but made critical mistakes that
allowed his Mustang opponent to win 10-
N. Jeff Wilson (177 pounds) and Wiggen
had been the Cardinal's best wrestlers, but
Wilson also had an off evening. Wilson was
pinned 29 seconds into the second period.
Although Jeff Hazard (1 5S pounds) lost
13-2, Horpel said Hazard was wrestling
with more confidence, but still not up to
his full potential.
