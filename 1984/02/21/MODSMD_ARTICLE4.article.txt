### CHARLIE GOFEN Staff writer With wire reports 
As predicted, former Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale handily won
lowa's Democratic Caucuses last
night, but Colorado Sen. Gary Hart
was a surprise runner-up, receiving
15 percent of the vote, with 74 per
cent of the precincts reporting.
The caucuses were the first step in
the selection of 50 lowa delegates to
the Democratic National Conven
tion.and Mondale's showing indi
cated a near-sweep of those
nominating votes.
Mondale had a commanding 45 per
cent of the total vote in the nation's
first caucus. "A great victory,"
Mondale exclaimed. "This is the
beginning of the end of the Reagan
administration."
Hart was no less enthusiastic
about his own total. "Hopefully it
does turn this into a Hart-Mondale
race," he said.
Former South Dakota Sen. George
McGovern finished third with 13
percent of the vote. California Sen.
Alan Cranston ended in fourth with
9 percent, and Ohio Sen. John Glenn
gained only 5 percent for an unexpec
tedly weak fifth-place finish.
Former Florida Gov. Reuben As
kew and the Rev. Jesse Jackson each
received about 3 percent of the total
vote. South Carolina Sen. Ernest
Hollings finished with less than 1
percent of the total vote.
Hart's strong showing was "an un
expected pleasure." according to Jeff
Phillips, a leader of Stanford's Stu
dents for Hart.
"People are finally able to hear
what he (Hart) has to say. To beat
Reagan, people have to offer some
thing different than what Mondale

is offering," he said.
Hart offers expertise in military
reform. Phillips said. "Instead of as
king how much we should spend on
defense, he asks where we should
spend it,"he said. Phillips said the
Democratic primary could become a
two-man race between Mondale and
Hart, but "it will be very difficult to
knock Mondale out until (the June 5
primaries in) California."

Four members of the Stanford
Hart group celebrated in Council
Bluffs. lowa, after attending
caucuses and witnessing lowa's grass
roots politics in action.
"The room is aglow here," said
Walt Coughlin. a senior on the lowa
trip who co-teaches a course on
campus called "The Making of the
