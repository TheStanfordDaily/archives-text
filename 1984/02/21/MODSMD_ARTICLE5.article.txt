# Abzug challenges Kissinger conclusions

### TAREK HAMADA Stall writer 
Former New York Democratic Rep. Bella Abzug
called Fridav for the United States to end its
military involvement in Central America and
negotiate for peace.
"I believe (President) Reagan s policies in
Central America ha\e failed." Alvug said. "To
suggest a military solution when the problem is
poverty is a bankrupt policy The I nited States
can't overthrow the Nicaraguan government bv
covert aid to the contras. In El Salvador, the mil
itary and the government are corrupt
At a panel discussion here on I S. policy in
Central America. Abzug discussed an I 1-day tour
ot Central America she took from Dec. to
Jan. 5.

She spoke before 300 people at Annenberg
Auditorium along with Stanford professors
Richard Fagen and Edmundo I uen/alida.
Ab/ug and 10 other prominent women spent
live davs in Nicaragua and three davs each in El
Salvador and Honduras.
Ab/ug said the fact-finding tour was con
ducted because no women served on the National
Bipartisan Commission on Central America, ap
pointed bv Reagan and headed bv former Secre
tary of State Hcnrv Kissinger.
• \Vc have sought to present a women's
perspective." she said. " It was with great anger
and outrage that I noted the Kissinger Commis
sion was appointed without one woman on it. Al
though we have alwavs been trained to speak
sottlv and cans a big lipstick. I felt this was not

that time."
In El Salvador, the women talked with govern
ment officials, human rights activists, female
prisoners and common people.
"We were shocked with what we found in F.l
Salvador. - ' she said. "Violence by the government
there is endemic. For the United States to con
tinue the violence by increasing military aid is a
crime against any kind of international standard
of decency and justice.
"We found many, many people whose lives
were twisted by U.S. military aid to the Sal
vadoran government." Ab/ug said. "We spoke
with a 42-year-old woman whose five brothers
were killed (by government-sponsored death
squads). She was raped and one of her
breasts was cut off."
But leading government officials
are insensitive to the people's suffer
ing. she said.
Ah/ug quoted a member of El Sal
vador's General Assembly as saying,
"there really is no social conflict
here. If there was real social conflict
there would be a revolution like
there was in Nicaragua."
The United States must start
negotiations between the guerrillas
and the government because the
guerrillas are quickly gaining control
of El Salvador, she said.
"The best solution would be for
the United States to encourage dis
cussion among all parties," Abzug
said. "The guerrillas are obviously
gaining more and more military
strength."
Although the Nicaraguan govern
ment has made some mistakes, it is
supported by the Nicaraguan people,
she said.
"In Nicaragua, we found a deep
sense of hope and determination,"
Abzug said. "There was a wide range
of support for the Nicaraguan gov
ernment. Nicaragua is a pluralistic so

ciet\ that has a mixed economy."
The women spoke with supporters
and opponents ol the Sandinista go\-
ernment during their stay.
Nicaraguans are generally pleased
with the government's agrarian
reform program and its efforts to

improve education and health condi
tions, she said.
"We were impressed with some of
the important reforms in education
and health," Abzug said.
She criticized the government's
partial censorship of the press and
said Nicaraguan women suffer dis
crimination.
"Women feel that they have to

conduct a second revolution tor their
own equalitv." Alvug said. "Women
are not in the places of major politi
cal power (in Nicaragua). But the\
are not at the top ot the power
structure in am nation."
The Sandinistas are willing to

negotiate their differences with the
Reagan administration, she said.
"Officials in the Nicaraguan gov
ernment that we talked to expressed
a strong willingness to negotiate a
peaceful solution to the conflict."
Abzug said. "They made it clear they
were willing to negotiate such points
as the elimination of foreign forces
in the region. We came away with the

sense that the> feared verv deepb a
potential I S. imasion."
I S. troops have ossentiallv taken
over Honduras and turned the
country into an armed camp, she said.
"It was quite evident to lis that
U.S. militarv forces appear to he in
Honduras for the purpose ol repress
ing anv opposition to the existing
government, which is dominated hv
the army and the country's business
council. Ah/ug said.
fagen. a political science professor,
presented an alternative to the Kis

ternative plan was drawn lip wiih a
group ol scholars and former govern
ment officials.
I he Kissinger Commission con
cluded that U.S. security interests
"are import an 11 \ engaged" hv a
Soviet-Cuban threat in the region
and recommended increasing militarv
aid to El Salvador and providing $S
billion to Central America over the
next five years.
Fagen's alternative report. Policy
Alternatives for the Caribbean and
Central America (PACCA). calls for
an end to U.S. military aid to El Sal
vador. a cutoff of support for anti-
Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua and
normalization of relations with

Fagen said the Kissinger Commis
sion's report contains four fallacies:

It erroneously blames the Soviet
I nion. Cuba and Nicaragua for
Central Ameriea's turmoil: it mis
takenly describes revolutions in the
region as threats to America's secur
ity: it loolishi) thinks large amount
ol American aid can end the region's

conflicts: and it unwisely calls lor a
military solution it other options
tail.
I he United States must define its
national security interests in Central
America and then begin negotiations
with all ot the region's political
groups, lie said.
"We are talking about a long and
arduous process involving mam par

negotiate for peace.

Ab/ug and 10 other prominent women spent
live davs in Nicaragua and three davs each in El

and outrage that I noted the Kissinger Commis

though we have alwavs been trained to speak

In El Salvador, the women talked with govern
ment officials, human rights activists, female
prisoners and common people.
"We were shocked with what we found in F.l
Salvador. - ' she said. "Violence by the government
there is endemic. For the United States to con
tinue the violence by increasing military aid is a
crime against any kind of international standard
of decency and justice.
"We found many, many people whose lives
were twisted by U.S. military aid to the Sal
vadoran government." Ab/ug said. "We spoke
with a 42-year-old woman whose five brothers
were killed (by government-sponsored death
squads). She was raped and one of her
breasts was cut off."
But leading government officials
are insensitive to the people's suffer
ing. she said.
Ah/ug quoted a member of El Sal
vador's General Assembly as saying,
"there really is no social conflict
here. If there was real social conflict
there would be a revolution like
there was in Nicaragua."
The United States must start
negotiations between the guerrillas
and the government because the
guerrillas are quickly gaining control
of El Salvador, she said.
"The best solution would be for
the United States to encourage dis
cussion among all parties," Abzug
said. "The guerrillas are obviously
gaining more and more military
strength."
Although the Nicaraguan govern
ment has made some mistakes, it is
supported by the Nicaraguan people,
she said.
"In Nicaragua, we found a deep
sense of hope and determination,"
Abzug said. "There was a wide range
