French to stay in Lebanon
Paris — As the situation deteriorates in Beirut, the
French government is holding to its decision to keep French
soldiers there while trying to persuade the United Nations
Security Council to replace them with a U.N. force.
I his French refusal to follow the lead of the United
States. Britain and Italy in withdrawing their troops from
the multinational peacekeeping force seems to be based on
a desire to distance I rench policy from that of the Reagan
administration and to reassert French responsibility in a
troubled land that once was administered by France.
In private. French officials have made obvious their irri
tation with the Reagan administration for failing to con
sult the French government before announcing the
withdrawal of the Marines. On the day of the U.S. an
nouncement. a French official was almost contemptuous as
he asked how the Marines could hope to protect Lebanese
civilians by watching from ships offshore like spectators on
a balcony.
At the same time. French officials have emphasized that
they, unlike the Americans, have maintained contact with
the Moslem and Druse leaders in Lebanon and thus are in a
strong position to help stabilize a new government should
President Amin Gemayel fall.
Reagan goes on attack in lowa
Des Moines. lowa — President Reagan, attempting to
steal the show from the Democrats, tossed darts in the di
rection of front-runner Walter Mondale as he campaigned
across lowa yesterday, but political storm clouds loomed on
the horizon of his first major re-election foray of the year.
In a speech to a cheering audience of 7600 in Waterloo
just hours before the lowa precinct caucuses began. Reagan
assailed the Democrats as "captives of an anti-growth,
dinosaur mentality that offers nothing for the future but
repeating their failed past."
'If the big spenders get their way. they'll charge every
thing on your 'Taxpayers' Express Card.' And believe me,
they never leave home without it." Reagan said. "Let them
promise the moon, they'll deliver green cheese." he added,
referring to charges that Mondale has made excessive prom
ises to special interest groups.
But, while Reagan hammered away on domestic issues
from taxes to education and crime, he skirted any mention
ol the withdrawal of U.S. Marines from Lebanon and
touched only briefly on his administration's foreign-policy
record. He renewed his campaign declaration that "America
is back." but missing from his speeches was the refrain that
the nation is also "standing tall" under his leadership.
The lowa poll published yesterday in the Des Moines Reg
ister showed that Reagan's public-approval rating in this
state has plummeted 12 points since the first of the year.
He received a favorable job rating of 40 percent, his lowest
mark ever in the state, compared with 43 percent disap
proving.
The poll, based on interviews last week with 1003 adults,
showed that the economy, which has been slow to recover
here, and Lebanon remain troubling political issues for
Reagan. The survey also showed that if the election were
held yesterday, Democrats Mondale and Sen. John Glenn
would defeat Reagan in lowa, hy 53 to 39 percent and 50 to
39 percent, respectively.
Gemayel's options running out
Beirut. Lebanon — Lebanese President Amin Gemayel, to
all appearances, is trapped in an impossible position among
three outside powers, none of whose support he can count
on. and is. nearing the end of his political tether.
In this light, his ill-fated gambit of offering Syria a set of
"concessions" that Moslems and Christians alike here im
mediately saw as unacceptable to Damascus has done little
more than earn him another few days' lease on his political
life while negotiations continue with the Syrians.
Moslem-domipated West Beirut no longer accepts
Gemayel as president and his realm, which never extended
much beyond the city limits of Beirut, has been reduced to
the presidential palace grounds in Baabda and Christian
East Beirut.
He can no longer count on his full U.S.-trained army,
shattered by defections, defeat and religious strife. The
army numbered at latest count only about 6000 combat
ready troops out of a total force of 12,000 to 13,000 men
still believed loyal to his government.
Syrian-backed Druse militia forces are poised for an as
sault on the army's last stronghold in the mountains south
east of the capital at Suk al Gharb. whose fall would open
the way to their march on the presidential palace at
Baabda, three miles below.
Critics say Sandinista shifts
are only superficial efforts
Managua, Nicaragua — Despite the official pronounce

been made, and that they are meant to impress people
outside the country .
Much more will have to be done, the opponents say.
before the opposition will agree to take part in the pro
posed presidential election, the date of which was expected
to be announced yesterday.
Thus as the dry. hot winter drags on, the opposition is
playing a waiting game.
"I would like to see just one consistent symptom of
democracy," Pedro Chamorro said the other day. He is the
editor of I.a Prensa, Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper,
and a consistent critic of the government.
"There was a brief easing to permit news about the elec
tion law." Chamorro said, but added that it "proved too
costly for the government, so they increased censorship

French threaten trade war
if U.S. restricts wine imports
Paris, France — French officials and wine producers are
predicting a trans-Atlantic trade war if the California wine
industry succeeds in restricting imports of European wines
into the United States.
I'he implied threats reflect a growing concern here that,
despite the Reagan administration's opposition. Congress
may approve a controversial Wine Equity Act and that, in
addition, the U.S. government may impose retaliatory
measures against French and Italian wine.
I rench officials are understood to have informed the
I S. government that they regard the matter as the most
explosive issue in U.S.-French commercial relations.
In a recent public statement, the French Foreign Trade
Ministry warned that passage of the wine measure would
provoke "reprisal measures" against American exports that
have nothing to do with wine or any other agricultural prod
uct.

Reagan goes on attack in lowa
Des Moines. lowa — President Reagan, attempting to
steal the show from the Democrats, tossed darts in the di
rection of front-runner Walter Mondale as he campaigned
across lowa yesterday, but political storm clouds loomed on
the horizon of his first major re-election foray of the year.
In a speech to a cheering audience of 7600 in Waterloo
just hours before the lowa precinct caucuses began. Reagan
assailed the Democrats as "captives of an anti-growth,
dinosaur mentality that offers nothing for the future but
repeating their failed past."
'If the big spenders get their way. they'll charge every
thing on your 'Taxpayers' Express Card.' And believe me,
they never leave home without it." Reagan said. "Let them
promise the moon, they'll deliver green cheese." he added,
referring to charges that Mondale has made excessive prom
ises to special interest groups.
But, while Reagan hammered away on domestic issues
from taxes to education and crime, he skirted any mention
ol the withdrawal of U.S. Marines from Lebanon and
touched only briefly on his administration's foreign-policy
record. He renewed his campaign declaration that "America
is back." but missing from his speeches was the refrain that
the nation is also "standing tall" under his leadership.
The lowa poll published yesterday in the Des Moines Reg
ister showed that Reagan's public-approval rating in this
state has plummeted 12 points since the first of the year.
He received a favorable job rating of 40 percent, his lowest
mark ever in the state, compared with 43 percent disap
proving.
The poll, based on interviews last week with 1003 adults,
showed that the economy, which has been slow to recover
here, and Lebanon remain troubling political issues for
Reagan. The survey also showed that if the election were
held yesterday, Democrats Mondale and Sen. John Glenn
would defeat Reagan in lowa, hy 53 to 39 percent and 50 to
39 percent, respectively.
Gemayel's options running out
Beirut. Lebanon — Lebanese President Amin Gemayel, to
all appearances, is trapped in an impossible position among
three outside powers, none of whose support he can count
on. and is. nearing the end of his political tether.
In this light, his ill-fated gambit of offering Syria a set of
"concessions" that Moslems and Christians alike here im
mediately saw as unacceptable to Damascus has done little
more than earn him another few days' lease on his political
life while negotiations continue with the Syrians.
Moslem-domipated West Beirut no longer accepts
Gemayel as president and his realm, which never extended
much beyond the city limits of Beirut, has been reduced to
the presidential palace grounds in Baabda and Christian
East Beirut.
He can no longer count on his full U.S.-trained army,
shattered by defections, defeat and religious strife. The
army numbered at latest count only about 6000 combat
ready troops out of a total force of 12,000 to 13,000 men
still believed loyal to his government.
Syrian-backed Druse militia forces are poised for an as
sault on the army's last stronghold in the mountains south
east of the capital at Suk al Gharb. whose fall would open
the way to their march on the presidential palace at
Baabda, three miles below.
Critics say Sandinista shifts
are only superficial efforts
Managua, Nicaragua — Despite the official pronounce
ments on elections and pledges to free the press and end
abuses of power, opponents of Nicaragua's Sandinista gov
ernment complain that so far only superficial changes have
been made, and that they are meant to impress people
outside the country .
Much more will have to be done, the opponents say.
before the opposition will agree to take part in the pro
posed presidential election, the date of which was expected
to be announced yesterday.
Thus as the dry. hot winter drags on, the opposition is
playing a waiting game.
"I would like to see just one consistent symptom of
democracy," Pedro Chamorro said the other day. He is the
editor of I.a Prensa, Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper,
and a consistent critic of the government.
"There was a brief easing to permit news about the elec
tion law." Chamorro said, but added that it "proved too
costly for the government, so they increased censorship
again."
French threaten trade war
if U.S. restricts wine imports
Paris, France — French officials and wine producers are
predicting a trans-Atlantic trade war if the California wine
industry succeeds in restricting imports of European wines
into the United States.
I'he implied threats reflect a growing concern here that,
despite the Reagan administration's opposition. Congress
may approve a controversial Wine Equity Act and that, in
addition, the U.S. government may impose retaliatory
measures against French and Italian wine.
I rench officials are understood to have informed the
I S. government that they regard the matter as the most
explosive issue in U.S.-French commercial relations.
In a recent public statement, the French Foreign Trade
Ministry warned that passage of the wine measure would
provoke "reprisal measures" against American exports that
have nothing to do with wine or any other agricultural prod
uct.

French to stay in Lebanon
Paris — As the situation deteriorates in Beirut, the
French government is holding to its decision to keep French
soldiers there while trying to persuade the United Nations
Security Council to replace them with a U.N. force.
I his French refusal to follow the lead of the United
States. Britain and Italy in withdrawing their troops from
the multinational peacekeeping force seems to be based on
a desire to distance I rench policy from that of the Reagan
administration and to reassert French responsibility in a
troubled land that once was administered by France.
In private. French officials have made obvious their irri
tation with the Reagan administration for failing to con
sult the French government before announcing the
withdrawal of the Marines. On the day of the U.S. an
nouncement. a French official was almost contemptuous as
he asked how the Marines could hope to protect Lebanese
civilians by watching from ships offshore like spectators on
