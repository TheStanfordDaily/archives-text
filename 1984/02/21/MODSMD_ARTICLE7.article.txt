that evacuation of U.S. positions around the Beirut
International Airport was being delayed while Ameri
can officials decided who would take them over.
When the pullout from Beirut was announced h\
President Reagan two weeks ago. the plan was to
hand them over to the Lebanese army. But last week
Druse militiamen pushed the army out of positions
around the airport, and while the airport has been
closed for nearly two weeks from the latest fighting,
it remains an important national symbol in this
fractured country.

Damascus yesterday to find a way to end the fighting
between the shrinking army of Lebanese President

Amin Gemayel and the opposition militia forces of
the Druse and Shiite Moslems.

Damascus yesterday in an apparent effort to secure a
last-minute compromise on a peace plan for I ebanon.

in his efforts to win the Syrians over to an eight
point package plan espoused Friday by (iemayel. Saud

specify, had emerged in his talks with Syrian leaders.
