Druse offensive
Druse ant! Shiite militiamen
regained mountain and coastal strong
holds in Lebanon last week. The
seizing of the towns of Khaldc and
Damur created an uninterrupted
supply line for the opposition from
the sea to the Damascus-Beirut
highway and the Syrian forces in
the Bekaa Valley.
By the end of the week the
militiamen controlled all land ap
proaches to Beirut International
Airport where American Marines are
presently stationed. U.S. administra
tion officials insisted, however, that
the American forces are in no danger

and that most of the Marines will be
transferred to ships offshore within
30 days.
According to the Christian Phalan
gist radio station, fighting continued
through Saturday around the village
of Suk al-Gharb where much of what
is left of the Lebanese army is
defending the presidential palace of
current Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel. Western military sources
said that the militias are ready for an
offensive any time they choose in
the near future.
"We are just waiting for the
Americans to go and then we will
take Suk al-Gharb," a Shiite

guardsman at the Khalde intersec
tion told The New York Times.
During the latter part of the week
there was also quite a bit of machine
gun and rocket exchange over the
green line dividing Christian Hast
Beirut and Moslem West Beirut. The
Marine compound at the airport was
hit by some of the machine-gunning
but a spokesman for the military said
that no one had been hurt and des
cribed the tiring as only "spillover"
from the green line battles.
The 1300 Marines left on the
Lebanese shore moved nonessential
and support supplies to their ships in
preparation for the final evacuation
expected to begin in the next few
days. Unable to use the showers be
cause they have been dismantled and
able to eat only c-rations because of
the lack of supplies on land, the
Marines aiv roughing it during their
last days on Lebanese soil.
Italian forces evacuated their
supplies Sunday and intended to
move out their first ground troops
yesterday.
Gemayel's plan
With the multinational force pul
ling back, the Lebanese army severely
crippled from defeats and desertions
of past weeks, and the opposition
militias' offensives succeeding, the
fate of the present Lebanese govern
ment under/Gemayel is basically at
the mercy of Syrian wishes.
In the hope that he could con
solidate what little power remained,
Gemayel quickly formed an eight
point plan for the reconciliation of
all nations involved in Lebanon. The
plan was delivered to Syria Friday by
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al
Faisal.
In the plan, Lebanon offered to
abrogate the 1983 U.S.-sponsored
troop-withdrawal agreement with Is
rael. The new plan's conditions in
cluded that Israel be granted other
security guarantees in southern
Lebanon and that Syria agree to
withdraw its troops at the same time
as an Israeli pullback.
However, Saturday, Syria con
tacted Gemayel with a response that
it wasn't prepared to even think
about a reconciliation until the Is
raeli treaty had been completely

abrogated. Syrian officials said that
a Syrian withdrawal couldn't be tied
to an Israeli pullout because the Is
raelis invaded the country, while the
Syrians were invited.
Gemayel also made overtures to
the opposition within the country it
self. He said that he had no intention
ol resigning and called for an immedi
ate and comprehensive cease-fire,
saying "nothing is worth having this
country destroyed."
New Soviet leader
Last week the first pronounce
ments of the newly named leader of
the Soviet Communist Party
Konstantin Chernenko had a slightly
reassuring ring for the West. The
choosing of Leonid Brezhnev's
protege to lead the party created an
optimistic air for the bettering of
relations between the Soviet Union
and the West. This new opening is es
pecially welcome to the present
American administration in light of
recent criticism of President
Reagan's harsh atacks on the Soviet
Union. The administration has been
under quite a bit of pressure concern
ing the inflexibility of U.S.
diplomacy.
Immediately upon being named the

successor to Yuri Andropov. Cher
nenko supported peaceful coexis
tence. "We need no military
superiority," he asserted.
Vice President George Bush came
out of a meeting Tuesday with Cher
nenko saying that the two had
agreed on the need "to place our re
lationship on a more constructive
path." Bush said. "The mood was
good, the spirit was excellent. Tass,
the Soviet news agency, however,
described the meeting as having a
more temperate air.
During the week Chernenko met
with a number of other world leaders
including Fidel Castro of Cuba and
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. During
these meetings the Soviet leader in
dicated no change in the Soviet view
on Latin American issues. After the
meeting with Castro, Tass reported
that the Soviet Union restated its
full support for that country, which
was said to "courageously oppose the
aggressive intrigues of U.S. im
perialism."
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau, who also met with the new
leader, said the the new Soviet Com
munist Party chief appears to be in
terested in reviving "the spirit of
detente" after his meeting with

Chernenko on Wednesday.
Reagan, who did not make the trip
to Moscow for Andropov's funeral
because of the pressing Lebanon
problem, also praised Chernenko s
"effort to downplay rhetoric and ex
plore ways to promote a more useful
dialogue." And. although he rejected
the possibility of a "get-acquainted
summit," Reagan said he saw possibil
ities for future talks in Chernenko's
comments on the two superpowers.
Chernenko called for both powers to
see that "regional conflicts did not
get out of control (and) that there
should be safeguards against any in
advertent use of nuclear weapons."
Both experienced specialists and
White House officials, however, were
more pessimistic, predicting no sig
nificant warming in relation
Iran/Iraq war escalates
The war between Iran and Iraq
took a turn for the worse last week
as the two sides tried to create pres
sure on each other to come to terms
with the situation by attacking civil
ian populations for the first time.
The increased tempo of the conflict
created renewed fears in the West
about a blockage of Persian Gulf oil

Key Lebanon developments last week:
(1) Druse and Shiite militiamen regain mountain strongpoints above
Beirut despite sporadic shelling by American ships.

south of Awali river.

tial palace
(4) Right-wing Christian militiamen take positions on the green line
dividing Beirut.

port. President Reagan orders most American Marines at the airport to
be transferred to ships offshore within 30 days.
