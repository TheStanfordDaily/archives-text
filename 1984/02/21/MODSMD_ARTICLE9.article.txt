## The 						Stanford Daily Red Wave rocks Maples 
### 
II you weren't in Maples Pavilion or watching
CBS on Saturday afternoon, you missed Stan
ford's most emotion-packed basketball game in
recent memory. But don't feel too bad. With
Coach Tom Davis at the helm, the excitement
has barely begun.
Of course, if you were among the throng of
students who formed the mass of vibrating red
on the court at game's end, you don't need to be
told about the potential of Stanford basket
ball. Saturday's resounding 75-64 victory over
UCLA said it all.
For one, the game showed what enthusiastic
basketball fans can do for a team. The Bruins
got their first sign of trouble when their bus
rolled into the Maples parking lot one and a half
hours before game time â€” and already the
student-section line stretched around a quarter
of the pavilion. During the game, the noise was
beautifully deafening. The crowd exploded at
every Cardinal basket and steal, every UCLA
foul and turnover. After screaming their team
to victory, the fans mounted a spontaneous
celebration that redefined the term "school
spirit."
Saturday's game also showed what devoted
and tireless college basketball players can do.

Whether it was Keith Jones slicing through the
lane for a layup. John Revelli skillfull) drawing
fouls with his drives to the basket or Andy Fis
cher diving for a steal, the Card demonstrated
that hustle, smartness and the desire to win can
prevail over the physically superior Bruins.
Most of all, the game showed what a great
coach can do. Before Davis took over last
season, Stanford basketball was something to
pass the time until the next football season.
Under Davis this year, the IS-S Cardinal is on
the verge of post-season tournament play tor
the first time since 1942. Stanford has a gcxxJ
shot at a berth in the National Invitational
Tournament and an outside chance for the
NCAA tournament.
Davis deserves the bulk of the credit for
turning around the program in so short a time
and bringing out the most in his players. He also
has generated unforgettable excitement among
campus basketball fans.
Those who surrounded the team and bounced
to the beat of "All Right Now" after the game
will long remember that Saturday afternoon in
February. But it will be the first of many
memories. A new era of Stanford basketball has
begun.
