lowa Results
l)es Moines, lowa — While
Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio)
crash-landed in the lowa Dem
ocratic presidential precinct
caucuses Monday night, Walter
Mondale soared off into the
wild blue yonder with a showing
that was every hit as strong as
he realistically had hoped.

Mondale won as many
popular votes in the first test
of the 19N4 presidential season
as his seven Democratic oppo
nents combined. Political ob
servers projected that he may
wind up getting 50 of lowa's 58
delegates to the Democratic
National Convention next July,

with Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.)
getting 2, with 1 uncommitted
and 5 ex-officio slots to he se
lected.
Near complete results from
the lowa Democratic presiden
tial precinct caucuses Monday
night showed that Mondale
was the choice of 4K.9 percent
of those participating. Hart

had 16.5 percent, former Sen.
George McGovern (D-S.D.)
10.3 percent. Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) 7.4 per
cent, Glenn 3.5 percent,
former Florida Gov. Reubin
Askew 2.5 percent, Jesse Jack
son 1.5 percent. Sen. Ernest
Hollings (D-S.C.) 1.4 percent

with 9.4 percent uncommitted.
Neither Jackson nor Hollings
contested the caucuses.
(ilenn's Disappointment
Des Moines, lowa — The dis
appointing showing of Glenn in
lowa's precinct caucuses will
make it more difficult than
ever for Mondale's rivals to
deny him the Democratic
presidential nomination.
With Hart emerging to chal
lenge Mondale in next week's
New Hampshire primary,
Glenn's challenge now is to
revitalize his long-sagging can
didacy in time to confront
Mondale in the hrace of prima
ries in Southern states that
will he held on March 13.
The former astronaut's cam
paign has heen sliding downhill
for months, and his perfor
mance here in lowa — a state
long regarded by his advisers as
difficult territory — provided
a blow to his candidacy that he

never expected. Twenty-two
years to the day after the
space flight that made him a
national hero. Glenn fell on his
face in the caucuses here.
Glenn long assumed that he
would finish second in lowa, if
a distant second. Hut by falling
to a remote fifth among the

eight candidates, he has com
pounded his problems in New
Hampshire and perhaps
weakened himself fatally in
the South, which had been con
sidered the crucial bat
tleground for his challenge to
Mondale.
Hart plans future
Washington — Hart plans to
exploit his second place finish
in the lowa caucuses by
working hard in New
Hampshire and then waging a
"guerrilla campaign" to nibble
away at Mondale's big lead and
well-financed organization.
"We are not going to play by
Mondale's rules," Oliver
Henkel, Hart's campaign
manager, said in an interview
yesterday. "We are going to go
our own way."
Meanwhile, in New
Hampshire, the Colorado
senator predicted that after

that state's primary election
next Tuesday, he will replace
Glenn as the principal rival to
Mondale.
"I think this will be a two
person race and I'll win it," said
Hart, who attracted 16.5 per
cent of lowa Democrats
compared with Mondale's 48.9
percent. Glenn had 3.5 percent
for a fifth-place finish.
New Hampshire Poll
Meanwhile, in New
Hampshire . . .
Mondale holds a large lead a
week before 1984's first Dem
ocratic presidential primary,
with Ohio's Glenn running
second and Colorado's Hart
third, according to Washington
Fost-ABC News polling in
recent days.
With voters sharply divided
over whether Mondale is
making too many promises to
special interest groups, the

front-runner is supported hy
37 percent of the Democrats
and Independents who say they
are certain to vote.
The poll, in which 526 people
were interviewed from Feb. 13
through Feb. 20, shows Glenn
the choice of 20 percent of
those who say they are certain
to vote. He draws most of his
support from people who think
of themselves as Independents
rather than Democrats.
Hart is backed by 13 percent
of those who say they are cer
tain to vote, placing him
slightly ahead of Jackson, who
was chosen by 10 percent.
McGovern is the choice of 6
percent while South Carolina's
Hollings and California's
Cranston get 4 percent each
and Askew gets less than 1 per
cent.
What effect Monday's lowa
caucuses may have on next
week's primary is uncertain.
