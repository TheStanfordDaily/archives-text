## The 						Stanford Daily The 						library shoot-out 
### 
It was a western scenario the president him
self would have liked.
Wild Bill Kimball and Cool Hand Don Ken
nedy stared across the nation at Big Ed Meese in
the showdown over the proposed Reagan library
here.
Big Ed said the University was making the
president an offer he could not accept by de
manding the decoupling of the proposed
presidential library and museum from the polic\
center. But University President Donald Ken
nedy stood by his guns, saying he had to get
"what is right for Stanford."
After months of negotiations and letter ex
hanges, the word came down last week. Big Ed
had backed down.
The standoff is over. No shots were fired.
Both sides can walk away from the showdown
and into the sunset, comfortable that they got
what they wanted.
The president gets to have his library and

museum here - where he always wanted them
and the University adds the presidential
papers — an invaluable academic asset, regard
less of political leanings — to Reagan's guber
natorial. campaign and transition papers which
are already housed in the Hoover Institution.
In addition, both sides save the embarrass
ment which would have resulted had Stanford
been forced to refuse the president's offer.
Stanford would have looked bad if it had blown
the chance to have a presidential library here,
and Reagan would have looked bad if a
respected academic institution had rebuffed his
offer.
Now Kennedy will take charge of planning the
specifics of the Reagan complex here. "So we're
heading down the road," Kennedy told reporters
last week, "but it's not a short road."
It will be a long road before the details of the
site and the si/e of the complex can be ironed
out. But it's a road worth traveling now that
die lone showdown is over.
