# The
						Journal's crusade

### 
The Wall Street Journal is on a crusade. The
newspaper with the largest daily circulation in
the United States continues to vent its right
wing wrath on this university through its edito
rial page.
The Reagan library controversy has provided
the Journal with a special opportunity to la
ment Stanford's "partisanship." It's also given
the Journal, and other newspapers, a chance to
simplify and distort the discussion on the library
complex. *
The Journal's Feb. 8 editorial states that the
University's "goal, far from keeping Stanford
tree ol politics, seems to be to ensure the right
kind of politics, which is to say the liberal kind,
remain dominant." It claims the University let a
Stanford official use a Stanford room to raise
$6000 for Alan Cranston's Democratic
presidential campaign. The editorial also says
the University "funds" such political groups as
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford and
what the Journal deprecatinglv calls a "feminist
studies" department.
The Journal seems to ignore the fact that
University President Donald Kennedy has been
saying all along that the Reagan library contro
versy has nothing to do with partisanship: Ken
nedy has said, and we agree, that the issue is

simply one of who controls what happens on
Stanford land. We think it is not too much to
ask that the University — and not any other en
tity, such as the Hoover Institution or an exter
nal, "independent," agency — be able to control
such things.
The Journal also conveniently ignores the fact
that the University did not condone the use of
a Stanford room for a Cranston fund-raiser, and
is. in fact, investigating the incident. And it re
quires incredible narrow-mindedness to call an
organization dedicated to serving the gay com
munity, such as GLAS, "political," and it is
naive to foist that title on a respected depart
ment like Feminist Studies.
I lie controversy over the Reagan library has
been a Icing and complicated one. Simplifications
exacerbate divisions in the issue, and the Wall
Street Journal seems to be dedicated to divisive
simplifications. We certainly don't object to
anyone criticizing Stanford — so long as such
criticism is leveled in an accurate and responsible
manner.
We have only one thing to say to the members
of the Journal's editorial board: If the Univer
sity's demands were politically motivated and
unreasonable, why did the White House back
down and accept them?
