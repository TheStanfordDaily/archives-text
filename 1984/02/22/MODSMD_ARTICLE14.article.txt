## CIA, KGB actions equally heinous 
### 
Sally Newman's recent column,
"Looking behind the Russian Bear"
(Daily. Feb 14.). is a shining example
of the attitudes and perceptions
that many Americans cling to that
prevent them from finding faults in
the policies of the United States,

VIEWPOINT

continually lead them to point out
the faults in the policies of other
countries and ultimately militate
against more amicable relations with
the Soviet Union and much of the
rest of the world.
In reference to her comparison of
the international activities of the
CIA and the KGB, she conveniently
omitted several heinous actions of
the CIA. For starters there was the
little matter of the overthrow of
Allende in Chile, which included af

filiations with hired assassins and
terrorist organizations. If we delve
into Iranian history just the slightest
bit we discover that the CIA played a
significant role in the rise to power
of the most recent Shah of Iran, and
that perhaps the anti-Americanism
in the revolution there had an ele
ment of justification considering the
methods, fashion and consequences
of his reign. The "discernible ties to
Moscow" of the students were not
the crucial issue in Iran at that time.
There are also the issues of the Bay
of Pigs and plotting to assassinate
Fidel Castro . . . well. OK. Newman is
right.
They were not interventions
meant to "destroy a country's
sovereignty," a value she seems to
believe is so precious and worthy of
our respect, but were in fact neces
sary for the defense of the "ideal of

democracy." To excuse these and
other actions of the United States
and the CIA as "more a function of
confusion than of malicious design"
is feeble and naive.
Judging from the past actions of
the CIA. I consider advocating in
creased use of the CIA and its eu
phemistic "intelligence operations" as
a way to keep peace, or at least New
man's version of a stalemate, an ex
ceedingly dangerous and irresponsible
position to take. Too frequently
its operations are illegal, perni
cious. show a definite lack of intelli
gence and are manifestations of the
most paranoid and reactionary ele
ments of United States policy.
We would do well to clean up our
own house before we go about fin
ding dirt in others.
