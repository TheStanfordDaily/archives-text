# Olympics are ridiculous
## 
### 
Now that the Winter Olympics are finally over, it's
time to reflect and marvel at what a nation of whiners
we are. Four years ago we were obsessed with the Olym
pics, transfixed hv speed skating, and damn near psy
chotic about hockey. We saw great omens for the United
States in those games — but this year we're doing our
best to sweep the whole thing under the rug. Not that
that's a bad thing, as the Olympic games are a foolish
spectacle administered in a ridiculous manner, hut it's
slightly embarrassing to be forced to recognize that the
U.S.A. is the world's foremost crybaby.
The Olympics, the legends say, bring together the
world's youth for participation in the games in a spirit of
cooperation. That's foolish: If you want cooperation you
shouldn't have Russians and Americans play hockey, of
all things. Send them out to build a bridge, instead.
Anyway, such spiritualism was evident when we gloated
about how well we'd participated at Lake Placid.
This year, when the medal count was East Germany -
umpteen, Russia - lots, and U.S.A. - present, what do
we say? Not "it was fun," not "good show, commies!"
but "wait until the summer games!" I was waiting for
President Reagan to issue some statement along the
lines of "Norway's got great skiers, but let 'em try to
land on the beaches of Guam and we'll show them what
for!" Some sportsmen, we.
There are three schools of thought on how to win
medals at the inconsequential sports that make up the
Olympics. 1) Be a huge country with enormous man
power reserves, and use sheer numbers to get the gold. If
you test 3()(),()()() people, odds are that one of them'll
have the stuff to set a world record in s/iilom. Sec Russia
for details. 2) A smaller country can mobilize its entire
economy toward the production of world class speed
skaters, composed of various concentrations of bioactive
chemicals. This works for East Germany.
The third way is difficult, but, for some, the best. Set
yourself up as the nominal leader of the free world, and
win medals through superior ethical merit. (Of course, it
helps to play on home ice at Lake Placid.) The main dis
advantage is that your athletes have to be true
amateurs, meaning (someone else's line) that they take
cash, not checks. Such is the set-up for team U.S.A.
It's too bad that Americans have such an aversion to
army service, or we could underwrite our athletes as do
other nations, by making them a battalion. Of course,
the bureaucracy here would in short order put them on
the field in Nicaragua, so it's likely all for the best.
The tie between Olympic athletes and the armed
forces is odd, but it works, so I can't knock it. If it came
to blows I'd rather have Fatty Arbuckle with a machine
gun on my side than Bruce Jenner with a relay baton, but
I may be an exception. The way things look, the upcom
ing war in Western Europe won't be fought with cruise
missiles and MiGs, but with javelins and hockey sticks.
Still, this ignores the real reason why it's foolish to be
concerned with the Olympics — and this has nothing to
do with the sporting merit of poor old luge racing —
which is that it's senseless to hold a two-week event
every four years to name the best athletes in any sport.
Seriously, are we to believe that some dazed ex-con
from California who was probably more interested in
hubcaps than skis four years ago is the best downhill
racer in the world by the evidence of two runs? Should

America believe that Rosalynn Simmers isn't the best
spoiled adolescent prima donna figure skating head-case
on the basis of one flawed triple axel? Honestly, folks,
it's all a fluke.
Instead of ever\ four years, the Olympics should be
held. say. every 15 minutes — then we'd see who has the
best athletes. Then, around the 42nd week we'd be com
ing home with some luge medals. Hell. I'd even give it a
try, and isn't that what the Olympics are about,
anyway? Participation?
That's the real attraction, what interests us in these
spurious sports. Everyone believes that with an early
enough start he or she would have been the best ski
jumper, or figure skater, or whatever. Ninety-five per
cent of the people watching the games on TV harbor a
secret wish to apply for citizenship in sunny Sidereal

Bogswania, then captain r.s Olympic team and compete
in some glamour sport. Many have run in their heads a
tape ot ABC's "Up Close 11 Personal" interview with
the plucky Bogswanian team.
Its litting that such dreams fuel the interest in a
likewise phantasmal spectacle. Sometimes I wonder,
though, how much politics lias infiltrated the game, in a
much subtler way than the boycott ol 19S0. 112 think the
United States is trying to •nd a message to the Third
World. We keep throwing the Winter Games, letting the
Russians sweep the medals and plod through the slush to
the awards ceremony, while we concentrate on the Sum
mer Games, on claiming our gold in the sun.
After Russia invades dreary Afghanistan, we turn
around and quash an insurgency in equatorial Grenada. I
think there is a definite connection to our Olympic per
formance a decided intention ol making the Third
World regard the United States as the Bahamas of the
superpowers.
Of course, not every nation cares to be so frivolous
and waste time on what are, after all, just games. I
wonder if anyone noticed, amid all the luging and the
flailing hockey sticks, the ( hinese troops massing in
Chicago and Leningrad.
