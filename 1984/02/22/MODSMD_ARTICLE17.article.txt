## Student library use requires re-evaluation 
### 
Recently I have had the chance to partake in
some important discussions about the University
libraries, and the thrust of those discussions
should be made known to all students: There
exists a real problem with library facilities for un
dergraduates and student needs are not being
met.
Meyer Library is now billed as the
"undergraduate library," but it doesn't ade
quately serve that constituency. To begin, the

VIEWPOINT

study space is impractical in design — it is too
"open." and there is no feeling of privacy which
many students consider important for produc
tive work. The decor appears "cheap," especially
in comparison with that of Green Library, and
the furniture is awkward and uncomfortable.
The building is full of noise from clanking
change machines. Xerox copiers and the loan desk
stamp machines. The lights buzz and the ventila
tion is loud. Further, the open "well" on the
second floor, and the high ceilings in general, lend
to the feeling of overwhelming space that seems
to encourage talking.
That, of course, brings up another problem.
Meyer is notorious for what is referred to as
"social studying." Studying can be a lonely en
deavor. no doubt about it.and many students
have found Meyer to be the answer to that di
lemma. Lots of talking and some horseplay occur
in the building almost all of the time. Students
know this and know there has been a trend in
recent years to make the library a very social
place, so the problem seems to be feeding upon
itself.

1 he issue here is one of cultural behavior. Ap
parently part of Meyer's constituency has
decided so much noise is acceptable. Changing the
physical atmosphere of the library won't elimi
nate this behavior, but may create a mood more
suggestive ol serious work and an atmosphere
more suitable to the same. Suggestions for
changes in the physical structure and appearance
ol the library are many: new furniture, removal
of extraneous noises from machines from the
second to the first floor, better lighting at indi
vidual desks and more intelligent use of the
wasted space on the ground floor.
These are all long-term goals. In the meantime,
other solutions to the overall University library
problem are possible. The Committee on Under
graduate and Residential Education has already
submitted a proposal to the Academic Council
Committee on Libraries to extend the building
hours of Green from I I p.m. to midnight on
Sunday-Thursday.
The cost of adding that extra hour of service is
not insignificant, but the key is that Green of
fers the serious yet comfortable atmosphere
many students need. It can be argued most learn
ing occurs in the library for those students, and
since it is the primary objective of a University
to provide lor the education ol its student body,
the library should be kept open at any cost, if the
demand is present.
Here it is pertinent to correct an article that
appeared on the front page ol The Daily ("Pane!
considers changes at Meyer." I eh. 16). The arti
cle incorrectly states that an ASSU survey con
ducted List quartet focused on the problems at
Meyer. Actually the survey asked six questions
that focused on Green I ibrary. Of students

questioned in dorms across campus, 48.5 percent
said they conducted most of their academic work
in a library, and of those, 73.4 percent listed
Green as the library preferred.
The question therefore becomes, "Why Green
over Meyer?", and the answer is twofold: better
research facilities and better study space. Hence
the proposal to keep the building open until mid
night; at least that would make study space more
accessible, even if the loan desk still closed ear
lier. Other reasons for the suggestion are
numerous.
The Committee on Libraries has already
received several letters from graduate students
deploring the "rowdy undergraduates" in Green
and urging the committee not to accept our pro
posal. In response to the concerns of those stu
dents. I assert that keeping the building open
longer simply will benefit the students already
patronizing Green, both undergraduates and
graduates, and will not necessarily attract more
"rowdy" students. What's more, grad students
are not exempt from the ranks of disorderly stu
dents — more than once I've been disturbed by
grad students in Green.
Clearly this problem is complex, but there are
solutions. Mure alternative study spaces in
residences or other buildings should be developed
to accommodate students who thrive on group or
"social" studying. Meyer needs to be revamped
to suit the needs of its current patrons who ac
tually seek a quiet library in which to conduct
academic research and study. In the meantime
the University ought to make increased use of
facilities already well developed by extending the
building hours at Green.
