# Professors Manley, Rebholz circulate new Hoover petition

### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
A petition calling for the appointment of "a
distinguished and independent visiting commit
tee" to look into the relationship between the
Hoover Institution and the University has been
circulated here.
According to the petition's authors, Political
Science Prof. John Manley and English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz, the current "problem of the
Hoover Institution" is "far worse" than it was
last spring, when they circulated a similar peti
tion signed by 84 faculty members and over 1500
students calling for an independent inquiry into
the University's relations with Hoover.
"Nothing has happened since the spring," said
Manley. "The problem is that the initial issue
that we raised, political activity and the prob
lems that it causes, has never been addressed."
The petition, prefaced by what its authors call
"attacks on Stanford" by The Wall Street Jour
nal and other publications, calls for a solution to
"the Hoover problem," either by restructuring
the institution or separating it from the Univer
sity.
"We have refrained from an outright call for
W. Glenn Cambell's resignation because we
believe that the problem of the Hoover Institu
tion transcends one individual," the petition
said.
According to Manley, the controversy over the
Reagan library here has overshadowed the initial
partisan issue.
"Now that the library issue has been settled,
we have to turn ourselves to Hoover," he said.
Manley said he felt that the committee ap
pointed by the Board of Trustees last spring to
look into Hoover's partisan activities has been
largely ineffectual. He said the committee was

heavily weighted in Hoover's favor and kept the
issue in the closet.
"The Trustee committee was nothing like
what we expected. It is not representative of the
broader Stanford community, and has not held
open meetings to voice concern," Manley said.
"Our petition seeks to get the issue of Hoover
out of the confrontational mode of Hoover

versus Stanford and into a place where peopK
who have opinions can objectively express them,
he said.
French and Italian Prof. Alphonse Juilland. an
opponent of the petition, said the Hoover
Stanford relationship is completely independent


Professors John Manley and Ronald Rebholz have been outspoken critics of the Hoover Institu
tion. They are currently circulating a petition calling for a review of the relationship between
the University and Hoover.
