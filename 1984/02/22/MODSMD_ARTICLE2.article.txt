# Professors Manley, Rebholz circulate new Hoover petition
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
A petition calling for the appointment of "a
distinguished and independent visiting commit
tee" to look into the relationship between the
Hoover Institution and the University has been
circulated here.
According to the petition's authors, Political
Science Prof. John Manley and English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz, the current "problem of the
Hoover Institution" is "far worse" than it was
last spring, when they circulated a similar peti
tion signed by 84 faculty members and over 1500
students calling for an independent inquiry into
the University's relations with Hoover.
"Nothing has happened since the spring," said
Manley. "The problem is that the initial issue
that we raised, political activity and the prob
lems that it causes, has never been addressed."
The petition, prefaced by what its authors call
"attacks on Stanford" by The Wall Street Jour
nal and other publications, calls for a solution to
"the Hoover problem," either by restructuring
the institution or separating it from the Univer
sity.
"We have refrained from an outright call for
W. Glenn Cambell's resignation because we
believe that the problem of the Hoover Institu
tion transcends one individual," the petition
said.
According to Manley, the controversy over the
Reagan library here has overshadowed the initial
partisan issue.
"Now that the library issue has been settled,
we have to turn ourselves to Hoover," he said.
Manley said he felt that the committee ap
pointed by the Board of Trustees last spring to
look into Hoover's partisan activities has been
largely ineffectual. He said the committee was

heavily weighted in Hoover's favor and kept the
issue in the closet.
"The Trustee committee was nothing like
what we expected. It is not representative of the
broader Stanford community, and has not held
open meetings to voice concern," Manley said.
"Our petition seeks to get the issue of Hoover
out of the confrontational mode of Hoover

versus Stanford and into a place where peopK
who have opinions can objectively express them,
he said.
French and Italian Prof. Alphonse Juilland. an
opponent of the petition, said the Hoover
Stanford relationship is completely independent


Professors John Manley and Ronald Rebholz have been outspoken critics of the Hoover Institu
tion. They are currently circulating a petition calling for a review of the relationship between
the University and Hoover.
of faculty concern.
"The relationship is established by
a protocol dependent on certain con
tractual agreements between Hoover
and the University, not the faculty,"
Juilland said.
Stanford is basically a liberal insti
tution, and therefore many liberals
will sign the petition, he said.
"It is an unwise signature. If you
know any conservatives at Stanford,
point them out to me and I'll eat
them with salt and pepper. We are
about a half a dozen lonely souls."
"People at Hoover ought to enjoy
as much academic freedom as people
in the Quad. Everyone wants to in
vestigate the political orientation of
Campbell. Why not investigate the
political orientation of John Man

ley?" he asked.
Manley said he does not know how
many people will sign the petition. "I
haven't the foggiest," he said. "If
it's a good idea and anyone's listen

ing, you get a response. We'll know in
the next few weeks what members of
the community are willing to say and
do. Even if they're not willing, we'll
have done our job by expressing our
views."
Rebholz was unavailable for com
ment.
Political Science Prof. Charles
Drekmeier, a signer of the original
petition, said he supports the second
petition.
"1 have signed it and it seems to
me to be a very well-considered
move. It is amazing to me that it has
taken so long to make this issue felt.
An outside, objective committee
seems to me like a move that no one
should take objection to," he said.
Stanford is not a particularly
liberal school, Drekmeier said.
"You'd be hard-pressed to find
liberals here," he said. "We have
'conservative' liberals at Hoover and
at the University."
