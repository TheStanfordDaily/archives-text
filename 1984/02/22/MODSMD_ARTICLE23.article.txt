## Peace Corps volunteers offer worldwide assistance 
### MARY YUH 
Peace Corps volunteers are
often thought of as people
who are acutely aware of social
conditions and inequalities, are
idealistic, and, perhaps, are out
to "save the world."
Charles Fortmann. a
graduate student in material
sciences and a Peace Corps
volunteer in Fiji from 1975-77,
described the Corps as an or
ganization "wanting to help
people" with members who are
"putting energy into some
thing they believe in."
Often, as in the case of
Mickey Levitan, a graduate
student in business, personal
feeling about the "worsening
conditions in the Third World
and the need for people to give
and help" are predominant fac
tors in the decision to join. The
Peace Corps also offers a
chance for first-hand experi
ence in everything from health
services to teaching.
But the Peace Corps is more
than gaining work experience
and helping others; it's also a
"personal challenge" — a
chance to stretch one's abili
ties and inner strengths to
their limits.
"You have to he able to get
a lot of personal growth from
difficulty," said Levitan. But
you develop "inner confidence,
peace, self-sufficiency — the
kind of thing that forever
after you carry with you."
Joining the Corps can he a
long and involved process, re
quiring many interviews and
letters of recommendation.
Every year, about 15 Stanford
students sign up for the Corps.
Once accepted into the pro
gram, each person receives
training in the language and
culture of his host country as
well as specialized training, for
instance in agriculture or
teaching.
Bob Strauss, currently a
graduate student in business,
spent two years in Liberia
where he operated a clinic in an
isolated rural community. He

was a liberal arts major in col
lege and received training in in
fant. maternal and health care
at a Peace Corp training center
near the Liberian capital.
Levitan underwent agricul
tural training in South Carolina
and in Senegal, where he was
stationed in the rural village of
Malem Thierigme.
Some volunteers, like
Fortmann. choose to teach.
Before he taught math and
physics to high school students
in liji. he received three
months ot training, including
teaching at a summer school
set up by the Peace Corps.
Business student Tom
Leonard also served in Fiji,
drawing on his undergraduate
degree in finance to teach col
lege students economics, finan
cial management, marketing
and math.
Each volunteer has a direct
impact on the community he
enters, and often becomes a
rather celebrated and much ap
preciated member. Particularly

in rural communities, where he
ma> be the sole literate person,
the Corps member becomes a
liaison with government offi
cials and vital to the comple
tion of community projects.
The small village of Yourpea.
Liberia had run out of funds
for the high school they were
building when Strauss arrived.
Local artisans finished the
school with a grant he obtained
from the government, and the
then-president of Liberia.
William Tolbert. came to its
dedication. The completion of
the school was accomplished in
addition to nearly eradicating
measles and lowering infant
and maternal mortality. As a
health education and nutrition
worker. Strauss w as responsible
for both educating the people
in preventive medicine and
treating the sick.
Like Strauss. Levitan was
also stationed in a small village
without electricity or running
water. In Malem Thierigme, he

was responsible tor rural devel
opment. and together with the
people he developed collective
vegetable gardens and fields of
millet and peanuts. From their
profits came a health post,
medicines. and start-up costs
tor the following year. Levitan
also worked on an animal trac
tion irrigation system that
saved the people much labor.
Even though teaching busi
ness or physics may seen im
practical when people in
less-developed areas lack basic
necessities such as adequate
food, it is just as vital to the
continuing development of a
nation as is the cultivation of
food crops. Thus the Peace
Corps sends volunteers to
teach wherever there is a
shortage of native teachers.
"Peace Corps is the most
grass-roots organization
around." says Levitan. Its goal
is to understand the communi
ty, its problems, and its needs
in order to give help where help
is wanted. The most important

thing is that "the motivation
should come from the people."
that comnuinitv projects are
"selt-generated" and not
imposed b\ outside aid. mem
bers say.
Peace Corps volunteers are
there not onlv to help, but also
to serve as ambassadors.
Ihrough their actions and their
communication with the
people, thev promote better
cross-cultural understanding.
and the ultimate goal, as the
organization's name suggests, is
to promote world peace.
I he immersion into a differ
ent culture gives a new per
spective on our society, and an
appreciation for the good
points and an awareness of the
faults of both societies. Such
consciousness is not only per
sonally enriching, but also an
other link in the "bridging of
nations." explained Levitan.
Becoming a member of the
community can be vital to ac
hieving these goals, and fluency

in the language can he essen
tial. particularly in isolated
areas.
"It was the hardest thing I
ever did." said Levitan. "I was
the only English-speaking per
son. and I had to totally
depend on Wolof (the native
language) to communicate.
"People were so good, kind
and warm." he added, "that I
had a great incentive to really
master the language so that I
could work with them and help
them. After si\ months I felt
like I was really starting to be
comfortable."
Total fluency, though, isn't
always necessary. In some
countries. English is a second
language for many people. But
volunteers say basic com
petence in the native language
is vital to establishing a bond
between the volunteer and the
people of the community.
Being a part of the Peace
Corps often influences one's

direction in life, both directly
and indirectly. The perspective
and awareness that one conies
away with, as well as the confi
dence of having met a chal
lenge. is carried within for the
rest of one's life and can af
fect one's actions. Being a
volunteer aided in Leonard's
decision to work in interna
tional development, particu
larly in finance and economics.
Levitan also plans 011 a career
in international development,
but more in the area of rural
development.
"My dream is to go back and
work 011 international develop
ment projects in west Africa,"
Levitan said. "I'd like to
combine the best of the Peace
Corps, the direct working with
the people and the promotion
of cross-cultural understand
ing. with the financial re
sources and contacts of the
large organizations."
F or some, the Peace Corps is
a part of their training, espe
cially in civil engineering,
health services and teaching.
For Fortmann. it influenced his
career in a more unique man
ner. A science project 011 solar
energy water heaters that he
developed with his students in
Fiji sparked his interest, and
he's now working 011 solar ener
gy, particularly photovoltaic
cells, here at Stanford.
Whether or not the Peace
Corps becomes influential in
volunteer's careers, it seems to
be influential in their lives.
"You learn a lot about the
world and about yourself," said
Strauss.
"You become much more
aware of directing your energy
toward socially constructive
things," said Fortmann.
"You realize how fascinating
people are, and how people are
different, but also the same,"
agreed Leonard.
Perhaps Levitan summed it
up best: It's "a very rich experi
ence. The best thing I could
have done."
