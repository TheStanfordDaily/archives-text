## NorCal tourney starts here 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Opening rounds of the 38th
annual Northern California In
tercollegiate Championship
begin today on Stanford's Var
sity Tennis Courts.
Thirteen schools are lielding
full singles and doubles teams,
which makes this the largest
turnout in the tournament s
history.
According to Head Coach
Dick Gould, "Stanford's
fortunes rose at this point last
year." An impressive perfor
mance by Cardinal John Letts
paved the way for Stanford's
first-place finish in the 1983
tournament. Letts won the
singles title and paired up with
teammate Scott Davis to claim
the doubles crown. Davis is
gone (he turned professional in
July), but Letts and the rest of
Stanford's championship team
is back to defend its title.
Gould expects that "Cal will
probably give us the toughest
competition." Other possible
contenders include University
of the Pacific, University of
Santa Clara, University of San
Francisco, San Jose State, UC-
Davis and St. Mary's.
The singles draw features

some of California's best
players. Stanford's Dan Goldie
is seeded first. Steve DeVries
of UC-Berkeley is second, fol
lowed by San Jose State's John
Saviano. Card netters Jim
Grabb, Eric Rosenfeld and
Letts are seeded fifth, sixth
and seventh, respectively.
If matches go as expected, it
will be an all-Stanford doubles
final. Letts and Grabb are
seeded first. On the opposite
side of the draw is the Card's
second-seeded team consisting
of senior Mark McKeen and
freshman Derrick Rostagno.
Although Stanford has
already played three pre-season
matches and appeared in three
tournaments, Gould has not
yet established a permanent
line-up. "The NorCal Champi
onship could have an influence
on that,'" Gould noted.
"So far, I've basically been
following the fall ladder, but
that's three months old,"
Gould continued. "I'll be
watching these matches to see
what is relevant."
Play begins at 1 I a.m. today.
Matches, however, are sched
uled at noon tomorrow
through Saturday.
