## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Anyone looking for a weak
ness on the Stanford women's
tennis team would have been
hard-pressed to lind one fol
lowing yesterday's 9-0 victory
over Santa Clara on the Var
sity Courts.
Head Coach Frank Brennan
was certainly pleased with the
performance. "I like to keep it
perfect." he said. "Alter all.

that's what we strive for."
The dominance of the No. 1-
ranked Cardinal was evident as
the netters took all six singles
matches in straight sets and
lost only one set in doubles.
At first singles, freshman
Patty Fendick defeated Susan
Molitor, 6-2, 6-1. Fendick
started off shakily, losing the
first two games, but then
proceeded to win 11 straight

games before closing out the
match.
Sophomore Kate Gompert
scored a convincing 6-0, 6-2
decision over Kelly Tero at No.
2. Judging by her on-court com
ments, one would have thought
Gompert was having serious
difficulty, but she easily out
classed Tero.
Freshman Stephanie Savides,
playing at No. 3, posted a 6-1,
6-4 triumph over Carol Bower.

Savides seemed to have some
difficulty with Bower in the
second set. but she said after
ward that she hadn't been
worried.
Senior Michelle Weiss had
the easiest match of the day,
winning the first nine games
before cruising to a 6-0, 6-2
victory over Shellvn Sarni at
No. 4."
Junior Barbara Baughman
handily disposed of Jill Lucas,
6-2, 6-3, at No. 5, while No. 6
sophomore Susan Ross, who has
had her problems this season,
had no difficulty with Patty
Sue Lynch, winning 6-0, 6-2.
In doubles, the No. 1 team
of Weiss and Gompert regis
tered a 6-1, 6-3 win over Ar
lene Daniel and Tebo, and the
No. 3 team of Savides and Ross
recorded a solid 6-3, 6-3 vic
tory.
The only match Santa Clara
came close to winning was at
No. 2 doubles. The Broncos'
duo of Molitor and Bower
started out strong and took
the first set from Werdel and
Baughman. 6-3. The Stanford
pair came back, though, and
swept the second set, 6-0.
The third set was a back
and-forth battle, with Werdel
and Baughman unable to open
up more than a one-game lead
as Santa Clara forged a 4-4 tie.
Finally, with the sun setting
behind Hoover Tower in the
backround, the Cardinal pair
won two successive games to
close out the set, 6-4. and com
plete the team shutout.
With the win, Stanford kept
its record unblemished at 5-0,
while Santa Clara fell to 1-4.
The netters are idle until next
Friday, when UC-Berkeley
visits the Farm.
