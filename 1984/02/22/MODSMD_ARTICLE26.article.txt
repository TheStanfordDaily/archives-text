# Maybe smog has gotten to the UCLA Bruins

### 
Ihe newest, and probably most popular,
acronym around the Stanford campus these
days is NIT. This scaled-down version of Na
tional Invitational Tournament can be heard
at any mealtime conversation, late-night bull
session or even in the depths of Green Li
brary.
The murmurs began some time ago as the
Stanford Cardinal men's basketball team
started its winning ways, but the whispers
broke into shouts when the Cardinal disposed
of the mystical powerhouse UCLA Bruins.
The explosion caused by that victory rever
berated all the way to the Reno casino I was
gambling in. But the victory has a rather
curious note to it: It was not Stanford's big
gest win of the year.
But wait a second, these were the UCLA
Bruins. The most dominant team in NCAA
basketball history. The perennial Pacific-10
champions. A team with so much talent that
it could field two teams and finish first and
second in the country.
Well, those images aren't quite so accurate.
UCLA may have the greatest tradition in
college basketball history and is always con
sidered one of the top teams in the country
— the banners that blanket the rafters of
Pauley Pavilion will attest to that. But the
1984 Bruins are a team of controversy.
The Bruins were 14-7 and fourth in the
Pac-10 coming into the Saturday's contest.
They are also in the midst of one of their
worst seasonal performances in their history.
The loss gave them eight for the season, a
total they have eclipsed only once in the last
19 years.

But beating the Bruins, although I don't
think it measures up to beating first-place
Washington, was a major event. The Bruins
are a great team, with enough talent to beat
almost anybody and a tradition of dominance
that should be carried out this year.
But shoulds and coulds aren't being carried
out this year as the Bruins are failing to live
up to expectations. With that failure has
come criticism and controversy.
Writers and fans have called for Head
Coach Larry Farmer's job. Others have even
claimed that the Bruins just don't have the
talent to compete with the rest of the
country or the conference the way they used
to.
The major problem for UCLA is that it no
longer plays the game the way legendary
coach John Wooden meant it to be played.
Not because Wooden is no longer there, but
because the Bruins are lazy.
Although 1 didn't see the game on Satur
day, I've seen UCLA enough to know how it
can play and how it doesn't play. I also grew

up as a Bruin tan and saw them win a hundred
games without even breaking a sweat.
Under Wooden, the Bruins beat other
teams into submission. Not on sheer talent
alone, but by playing the basics. Running the
fastbreak. rebounding and playing sound bas
ketball.
Even when Wooden left, Gene Bartow and
Gary Cunningham carried on these traditions
with players like Marques Johnson, Ray

Townsend, Roy Hamilton and Brad Holland.
The Bruins were simply a joy to watch.
But now that has changed. UCLA has the
talent to beat teams, but instead of doing
that, the Bruins expect their opponents to
roll over and play dead.
Kenny Fields is the prime example. Fields
leads the team in scoring and is probably the
most talented player on the Bruins, or even in
the entire Pac-10. However, unlike predeces
sors Johnson or David Greenwood, he does
not play hard, rebound well or even go to the
basket.
Fields would rather stand at the free
throw line and shoot a jump shot, score his 15
or 20 points a game and wait to get drafted
by some NBA team.
Stuart Gray is another case. This 7-foot
goliath was touted as the next Bill Walton
but has turned into an oversized wimp. He

plays aggressively once in a blue moon and al
lows undersized opponents — like those on
the Stanford team — to outplay him.
Lastly, the once-devastating UCLA
fastbreak has slowed to a crawl in favor of an
offense in which the players stand around
waiting for somebody to take a 20-foot jump
shot.
Farmer has taken much of the blame for
this and much of it is deserved. But Farmer is
only in his third year as head coach and should
be given more of a chance. He had never been
a head coach before and still has a lot of
learning to do.
As far as talent goes, anyone who thinks
that the Bruins don't have as much raw tal
ent as anyone else is stupid. If the statistics
don't prove it, just watching them once
should provide proof.
Stanford did not pull an upset in the true
sense of the word. The Cardinal outplayed
UCLA in every part of the game and is the
better team. But the Bruins are a disappoint
ment and wastes of talent.

Senior forward Kenny Fields bowed to Stanford in Saturday's game. After losing four
out of their last five games, the Bruins just can't seem to get back onto their feet.
