The women gymnasts
chalked up another loss in
Arizona Saturday in competi
tion against the Wildcats.
While the Cardinal did not an
ticipate beating the University
of Arizona, the team did hope
to score a team total in the
18()s. Stanford finished less
than one point short of this
goal with a 179.15. Arizona
totaled 183.30.
"The entire team performed
especially well on beam, but it
was our misses on bars that
kept us out of the 180 range,"
Sardina said. Freshman Nanci
Goldsmith did manage to hit
her set with an impressive per
formance; she took second
place with a 9.50.
Olympic-bound Goldsmith
also took a first place on the
beam with a 9.50 and placed
first all-around with an out
standing total of 37.05.
Senior Merilyn Chapman
placed fourth in the all-around
competition with a 36.70 and
second on vault and floor with
9.20 and 9.45 respectively.
Freshman Cindy Boyde placed
third on beam with a 9.30.
The Cardinal will somewhat
temper its rigorous competi
tive pace this week in order to
pick apart routines and work
on specifics. "I think this is a

crucial thing to do at this point
in the season," said Sardina.
The women's next competition
will be March 2, against
Berkeley.
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team totaled its highest
team score of the season
Friday night at Cal State
Fullerton. Stanford finished
second with a 268.00 to na
tionally ranked lowa's 273.00.
Fullerton finished third with a
264.00.
"We were especially out
standing as a team on floor and
rings," Head Coach Sadeo
Hamada said." We totaled our
highest team score on both of
these events."
Hamada said that pommel
horse and parallel bars are the
team's weak points.
Sophomore Jon Levy was the
strongest competitor for the
Card. He finished in second
place all-around with a 55.75,
tallying an average score of
9.30 per event. Levy is a strong
all-arounder who will be a defi
nite contender in the upcoming
Pac-10 Championships.
Also performing well for the
Cardinal was Junior Shaun
Hoffmeyer. He averaged an
8.80 per individual event.
The men will be competing in
Berkeley Friday against the
Bears and No. 1 -ranked UCLA.
