# Faculty committee proposes salary guarantee for emeriti
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
The Faculty Senate will consider a recom
mendation tomorrow by the Committee on
the Status of Emeriti to guarantee emeritus
professors over age K0 a minimum lifetime
income of $20,000 per year.
Currently, about 56 of the 280 emeriti are
experiencing "some economic difficulty," ac
cording to Cecilia Bureiaga, assistant
provost and staff member to the commit
tee.
A survey taken three years ago showed
that about 20 emeriti, half of whom were
over age SO, had an income of $15,000 or

less, the committee report said.
The cost of the plan would be about $1.3
million, the report said. This would pay for
the cost of setting up annuities for 20
emeriti and 25 spouses that would pay them
fixed amounts each year adjusted for infla
tion.
"There is a small proportion of emeriti
who don't really have as much as they should
have to live on," said Geology Emeritus
Prof. Konrad Krauskopf, the committee's
chairman.
Faculty and administrators said they ex
pected a heated discussion of the proposal
tomorrow because faculty members will have

to weigh the plan's cost with the potential
benefits they may themselves receive.
Krauskopf said most emeriti have large
incomes 112 10m outside,sources, such us invest
ments or book royalties. He said it is
impossible to tell exactly how many emeriti
have incomes below $20,000 because the
University does not keep track of this infor
mation.
Currently, a number of emeriti receive
only $500 to $600 per month from Social Se
curity and only $180 per month from the
University-sponsored pension plan Teachers
Insurance and Annuity Association/College
Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA/CREF),

Burciaga said.
Social Security payments are adjusted for
inflation, while the TIAA/CREF payments
are fixed, based on a percentage of the per
son's income upon retirement.
The committee report said, "The meager
ness of pensions from TIAA/CREF for those
who retired before 1 968 needs no emphasis,
and the steady erosion of purchasing power
of fixed incomes ... is apparent to every
one."
Burciaga said she believes the current sys
tem, in which individual emeriti may request
financial aid from the University, is ade
quate.

"In most cases, if they were really in eco
nomic straits we really did help them, and wi
will continue to do so, but it's not an en
litlcmcnt program," sTic snfcf
Burciaga said she has received about one or
two requests each year from emeriti asking
for aid. Money provided came from th
Provost's office or academic department
budgets, she said.
Krauskopf said the current system is in
adequate because many emeriti are unwilling
to request aid from the University.
"We are worried about those who just
don't report that they're having
trouble," he said.
Krauskopf said that it the plan is
not approved, "those who don't
make any complaint will probably
have to get along on very meager
means."
Jeannie Thomas, personnel
manager of benefits and records, said
the University could "not absorb
lightly or easily" the plan's $1.3 mil
lion cost. That figure would make a 2
percent dent in the University's cur

rent $65 million benefits budget for
all facult) and staff.
"It is not a dollar sum to be taken
lightly," she said.
Krauskopf said he recogni/ed that
it was a "considerable sum" and said
he hoped a donor could be found to
help defray the cost.
The committee was divided on
whether emeriti should be required
to submit income statements
proving need.
Members of the committee also
include Engineering Prof. William
Kays, English Prof. George Sen
sabaugh. Graduate School of Busi
ness Prof. Oscar Serbein and
Mathematics Prof. Marv Sunseri.
