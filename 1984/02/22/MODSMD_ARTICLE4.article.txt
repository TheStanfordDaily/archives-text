# Medical Center to lease space to Hughes Institute
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
The University has entered into
negotiations aimed at leasing part of
a planned Center for Molecular and
Genetic Medicine (CMCiM) to the
Howard Hughes Medical Research In
stitute, according to Medical School
Dean Dominick Purpura.
According to a recommendation by
the Committee on Academic Affairs
and Development, the leased space
of up to 30.000 net square feet will
be part of the $45 million CMCiM
facility currently being planned.
The CMCiM center will be located
on land adjacent to the Medical
School with construction expected
to begin some time this year.
Purpura said researchers at the
center will be selected Irom the
Stanford faculty by an advisory com
mittee working in conjunction with
the CMCiM directorate and the
Hughes Institute.
"We don't know yet who they will
be." he said. "There will be eight
members of the Hughes Institute
program. Three will he current fac
ulty, and five will be new faculty.
"The researchers will all be lull
bonafide members of the Stanford
faculty, whose salaries will be paid by
the Hughes Institute." Purpura said.

All researchers are to be named
within a year and will be employed by
the institute.
Although employed by the in
stitute. the faculty status of the re
searchers will be determined by
Stanford Medical School criteria.
Only individuals meeting the stand
ards of both institutions will be
hired.
"Under the arrangement the
prerogative of the faculty will
remain intact, and under University
rules," according to Spyros
Andreopoulos. Medical School direc
tor of communications. "Researchers
will be members of the institute, but
the University rules will prevail."
The CMGM lease arrangement will
provide advance rent payments from
the Hughes Medical Institute to ex
pedite the construction process while
other fund-raising efforts are being
pursued.
"We are receiving pre-paid rent.
We can complete the first floor, shell
it.and then complete the rest as
funds become available. This is a nor
mal procedure, the same thing was
done with the Fairchild building
(another Medical School structure),"
Andreopoulos said.
"In this respect, arrangements will
be similiar to those in place between
Stanford and its affiliated Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Medical
Center in which faculty have employ
ment status," Purpura said.
He added that the agreement is a
long-term lease arrangement.
"The lease will probably extend for
quite a few years. Now we're talking
40 years with an escape clause after a
nine-year period," Purpura said.
Recently the Hughes Medical In
stitute has begun to establish long
term relationships with several
universities.
"The University of California at

San Francisco, Duke and Harvard
have had such arrangements. The in
stitute has no particular bias for par
ticular research. The projects are not
picked up by the institute, but by
the researchers themselves,"
Andreopoulos said.
According to Andreopoulos, the
agreement will allow a new major
academic program to be investigated.
"Up to now the work has concen
trated on bacterial cells," he said.
"The new program will concentrate
on molecular cloning, or genetic engi
neering. Such research has applica
tions in clinical medicine, and as a
result we need more space."
