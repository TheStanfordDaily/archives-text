"Economic sanctions are the last resort tor
semi-peaceful change in South Africa." said Theo
kotze in a panel discussion last night in CERAS
auditorium.
Kot/e. a South African exile and anti
apartheid activist currently lecturing at Birming
ham. England, was one of three panel speakers
advocating U.S. economic involvement against
the practices of the South African government.
The program began with a 25-minute tilm. en
titled "A Cry tor Freedom." which provided
background information on Namibia, a country

located on the southwestern coast of Africa. Ac
cording to the film, of the 29 million people who
live in Namibia, a minority of Ift percent are
white, and yet the whites possess all power — po
litical and otherwise. Under the current South
African government established in 1471. blacks
enjoy literally no freedom, equality or human
rights.
Constraints are imposed through identifica
tion cards, constant patrols and roadblocks.
Many militants have been forced to flee the
country, some to neighboring Zambia. In all. over
cSO.()()() refugees have left Namibia, though many

have been pursued and subsequently tortured and
killed.
"Violence is a daily experience for the whole of
every black person's life — and it's done by law.
Kotze said. However, he added that there is no
"true law." Instead, he said, "South Africa has
instituted a legal system contrary to rule of law
and it conflicts with the rule of civilization as
we've come to know it more systematically and
consistently than any other country."
He added thai this is the type of society in
