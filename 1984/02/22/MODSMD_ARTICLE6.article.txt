# Panel urges sanctions to combat apartheid
## 
### NANETTE ARCHER 
"Economic sanctions are the last resort tor
semi-peaceful change in South Africa." said Theo
kotze in a panel discussion last night in CERAS
auditorium.
Kot/e. a South African exile and anti
apartheid activist currently lecturing at Birming
ham. England, was one of three panel speakers
advocating U.S. economic involvement against
the practices of the South African government.
The program began with a 25-minute tilm. en
titled "A Cry tor Freedom." which provided
background information on Namibia, a country

located on the southwestern coast of Africa. Ac
cording to the film, of the 29 million people who
live in Namibia, a minority of Ift percent are
white, and yet the whites possess all power — po
litical and otherwise. Under the current South
African government established in 1471. blacks
enjoy literally no freedom, equality or human
rights.
Constraints are imposed through identifica
tion cards, constant patrols and roadblocks.
Many militants have been forced to flee the
country, some to neighboring Zambia. In all. over
cSO.()()() refugees have left Namibia, though many

have been pursued and subsequently tortured and
killed.
"Violence is a daily experience for the whole of
every black person's life — and it's done by law.
Kotze said. However, he added that there is no
"true law." Instead, he said, "South Africa has
instituted a legal system contrary to rule of law
and it conflicts with the rule of civilization as
we've come to know it more systematically and
consistently than any other country."
He added thai this is the type of society in
which the West is investing. While he
asserted that "business and financial
firms are not missionary," he said he
also believes that they should not be
used to support a system in which the
majority is denied the right to a full
life.
Associate History Prof. Kennel I
Jackson discussed the distortion of
public information in the United
States, which he said suggests
prosperity of blacks and contributes
to a generally false picture of South
African life. He blamed this
primarily on "the nature of Ameri
can political culture" and the U.S.
society's "resource paranoia."
This "pro-South African cate
chism" is presented in a highly
selective way depicting the nation as

anti-Communist, "pioneering" and
allied with the United States, Jack
son said. Since these descriptons keep
recurring, "we need to think about
combative arguments," although the
U.S. public is still a long way from
economic sanctions.
Associate Education Prof. Joel
Samoff summarized some of the
points of the first two panelists, em
phasizing the impact that American
business could have on the policies of
South Africa. He cited examples
where major U.S. corporations
promote contributing investment in
black education, which is beginning
to be somewhat effective, and yet at
the same time claim to be incapable
of influencing South African govern
ment policy.
According to Samoff, it is im
perative for businesses, universities
and government alike to take a stand
against the immorality and in
humanity of the South African
regime.
