U.S. and Britain increase
forces in Strait of Hormuz
London — Western diplomats said Monday that both
Britain and the United States were expanding naval forces
near the Strait of Hormuz after intelligence reports indi
cated that Iran was considering military moves to close the
waterway used by tankers carrying a sixth of the Free
World's oil supply.
Alarm increased in Western intelligence circles after a
bloody weekend in the war between Iran and Iraq, during
which both sides claimed to have inflicted large casualties.
The government of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has
repeatedly threatened to close the strait between the Per
sian Gulf and the Indian Ocean during its two-and-a-half
year war with Iraq.
"It has moved from the threat stage to a real
possibility," a senior Western diplomat said. Western offi
cials said if Iran does move against the shipping, Khomeini's
goal would be to increase world pressure on Iraq to halt the
war Baghdad launched in September 1981. (Khomeini
stepped up the pressure, dispatching fresh volunteers to
the front after an emergency Cabinet meeting Monday.)
In response to the increasing alarm, British Prime Mini
ster Margaret Thatcher has ordered the aircraft carrier In
vincible to enter the area in the next few days, diplomats
said. The carrier, with its Harrier jump jets, will join Royal
Na\\ ships that were conducting convoy escort maneuvers
through the strait — against the possibility of an attempt
to close the waterway.
Democrats ask for defense cuts
Washington — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger,
in what could be a preview of this week's resumption of bi
partisan talks on reducing the federal deficit, faced a
barrage of criticism yesterday from Democrats on the
House Budget Committee but refused to single out which
defense budget items could be cut.
"Give us some guidance as to where we can go and make
these cuts, because we all know they are coming," Rep.
William Hefner, (D-N.C.), told Weinberger and Gen. John
Vessey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both of
whom testified before the committee.
But the two Reagan administration officials insisted
that the $305 billion in new spending authority they are
seeking for next year, which amounts to a 13 percent in
crease after inflation, is critically needed as part of a con
tinuing U.S. defense buildup aimed at staving off a Soviet
threat.
"This nation should not slack off. This a key year for the
United States," Vessey said. "While we're making progress,
the Soviets certainly aren't standing still."
Republicans support pullback
Washington — Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.) said yesterday that President Reagan "acted
wisely" in "facing the fact that because of factors beyond
our control" it was time to withdraw the Marines from
Lebanon rather than commit additional U.S. forces there.
After a White House meeting with the president, Baker ,
told reporters that "absent (a) willingness to commit an
othai di\ ision. a whole division, maybe 50,000 American
troops to that region, there's no way we can force the
Syrians out. That was not our objective to begin with."
Baker, who was joined in the session by the rest of the
GOP congressional leadership, said that Reagan "certainly
was wise in deciding now that rather than increase our troop
commitments it was time to withdraw." The administra
tion had never said it was considering a major additional
commitment of troops to the peace-keeping force in
Lebanon, however.
The majority leader's remarks dovetail with the new line
of GOP strategists who believe that political fallout from
Lebanon can be limited if Republicans emphasize the
Marine departure rather than the policy failures that led up
to it.
Nicaragua plans early election
Managua, Nicaragua — The Sandinista leadership, ac
celerating its election timetable by several months, an
nounced yesterday Nicaraguans will vote for a president,
vice president and National Assembly Nov. 4.
Commander Daniel Ortega, the chief of state, said in
making the announcement that the new government will
assume power Jan. 10 next year, meaning the Nicaraguan
elections will take place two days before the U.S. presiden
tial election and the Nicaraguan inauguration will be held
here about two weeks before the next U.S. president is in
augurated in Washington.
Ortega, widely reported to be the Sandinistas' likely
presidential candidate, coupled the speeded-up election
schedule with a decision by the revolutionary command
lowering the voting age from 18 to 16. The shift, respond
ing to a campaign by Sandinista youth groups, has the result
of increasing the Sandinista electoral base by enfranchising
more teen-agers, who have been among the revolution's
most ardent supporters.
Court says citizens can
sue cities for discrimination
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday issued a
novel constitutional ruling that may limit the ability of
some major American cities to reserve special benefits, such
as job preferences, for persons who live within their bor
ders.
By an 8-1 vote, the justices concluded that cities may be
sued in the same way that state governments can on charges
of discriminating against out-of-state residents.
The ruling was based upon the "privileges and im
munities" clause of the U.S. Constitution, which grants
American citizens who do not live within a particular state
the same general legal rights as citizens of that state.
The decision cleared the way for trial of a lawsuit in
which the building and construction trades in Camden. N.J.,
are challenging a city ordinance guaranteeing to Camden
residents 40 percent of all jobs on construction projects
financed with city funds.
The justices reversed a ruling by the New Jersey Supreme
Court, which had held that there was no reason to hold a
trial because the privileges and immunities clause applies
only to states, not to cities.
