From the Los Angeles Times
Beirut — The U.S. Marines official!} began their
withdrawal from Lebanon vesterda}. marking the
final phase tit a pullout that actuallv started davs
ago.
Earl} yesterday morning, the Americans received
written orders to pull out. spokesmen said. But there
was little evidence of movement at the U.S. base at
the international airport south ol Beirut. That is the
way the Marines planned it.
For days, the Marines have been moving non
essential men and supplies to the ships of the 6th
Fleet just offshore. That job was completed yester
day morning and the combat troops, who could leave
\er} quickly if necessar\. were all that were left.
"We're down to the meat of the operation." said
U.S. Army Maj. Don McClar\. a spokesman for the
Marines. But neither he nor am one else involved in
the operation would sa\ how man}, if anv. Marines
were moved to the ships }esterday. The} said they did
not want to risk trouble by prematurely disclosing the
troop strength on the ground.
"When we woke up this morning there were 1300
men on the ground." Maj. Dennis Brooks, another
Marine spokesman, said. "When we awake tomorrow

morning. I'll have to give }ou the number at that
time.
"It will take approximate!} a week, maybe two (to
move all the men to the ships), depending on the
schedule and the smoothness with which ever} thing
transpires."
However, other military sources have said that the
withdrawal could take as little as 24 hours, should the
Marines decide to act that quickly.
As the Marines were packing. Israeli jets swooped
over the mountains to the east, bombing and strafing
what the Israeli militar} command described as ter
rorist positions for the second time in three days. The
Israelis also announced that they had moved an
armored column across their lines at the Awali River
in search of Palestinians the} believed were trying to
infiltrate further south into Lebanon.
The Marines clearly had mixed feelings about their
departure. Some said the} were glad to be leaving,
while others bemoaned the prospect of being back
aboard ship. But most regretted that they had not
been able to bring peace to Lebanon.
Even as they spoke, artillery roared in the hills
above them and machine-gun fire echoed through the

adjacent southern suburbs ol „ r
I a nee Cpl. Robert Cook of Charleston. SC.. sa.d
he believed thai the Marine* had been given a raw
deal, that the\ had been made to look bad by being
draw n into the fighting in Lebanon.
• I think we were put in that position by other tac
tions that wanted us to look that way. he said. "You
have to bear in mind that there are so many tactions
trying to get us out. As soon as they do. they re going
to start fighting each other.
Capt Kevin Baesler. 26. ol Chattanooga. Tenn.
seemed bitter about the Marine experience in
Lebanon, in which more than 260 were killed.
-If these people work out their differences in the
next vear I will be really surprised, he said. "We
thought enough of what the> were trying to do to
put some of our guys here and share the risk.
As the fighting went on in Lebanon. Syria was re
ported vesterdav to have put forward a new four
point proposal to the government of Lebanese
President Amin Ciemavel. Local lieiiut piess reports
said that the proposals were Syria s response to the
eight-point Saudi Arabian plan endorsed by Gemayel
but rejected by the Damascus regime.
