From The Washington Post
Beirut, Lebanon — The commander of
the Christian Phalangist militia, Fadi
Frem, said yesterday that his forces
would not accept the unilateral abroga
tion of the 1983 Lebanese-Israeli
troop-withdrawal agreement and would
actively oppose President Amin
Gemayel if he accedes to Syrian pres
sure to do so.
"If the president sees that the solu
tion is in Damascus and he wants to
come under Syrian control just to calm
down the situation, you can be sure as
Lebanese Forces that we will not go
along with that," Frem said, referring to
the Phalangist-led militia, the main po
litical and military power of East
Beirut.
(In Damascus, Saudi efforts to secure
agreement on a peace plan for Lebanon
appeared to be gaining ground as Prince
Bandar Bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassa
dor to Washington, expressed renewed
optimism after talks with Syrian offi
cials. His visit, together with Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah, followed a
Syrian rebuff last week of an eight

point package plan that had been en
dorsed b> Gemayel and relayed to
Damascus by the Saudi foreign mini
ster.)
Asked what the Lebanese Forces
would do if Gemayel yields, Frem
replied that it would form "a political
opposition" and seek to block the can
cellation of the accord in parliament,
which overwhelmingly approved it last
May.
Frem's comments were the clearest
indication yet of a rift developing be
tween the Gemayel family and the
Lebanese forces over the issue of the
May 17 agreement, despite the family's
dominant role in the organization
through the Phalangist Party, which
Pierre Gemayel, the president's father,
founded and leads.
Frem is related to the Gemayel fam
ily through his wife, but most of the
top Phalangist commanders within the
Lebanese Forces still regard themselves
as followers of Bashir Gemayel. the
president's slain brother and one-time
leader of the forces, and have no special
loyalty to Amin Gemayel.

The president, in fact, has run into
mounting criticism both within and
outside the Lebanese Forces for his in
decisiveness and for getting the Chris
tian community into its present
difficulties.
"The president has the official power
to abrogate (the 19N3 accord) by going
to the parliament. We can put pressure
on the president first of all and then, it
it (the accord) is abrogated, don't for
get that this area here, we are still very
much in control of it." Frem remarked.
"Then you would be having here a poli
tical opposition."
Asked whether the Lebanese Forces
would oppose Gemayel by force, Frem
replied, "I don't think there is a need
for that."
His comments, made in an interview
with a group of American correspon
dents at his office in the militia's
headquarters here, underlined the
seemingly impossible predicament in
which Gemayel finds himself today —
torn not only between Syria and Israel
hut also between the Christian and
Moslem communities within Lebanon.

Until now. he luis counted heavily on
the support of the Lebanese Forces to
get him through the present crisis.
{rem has now put him on public notice
that he can no longer count on the
Christian militia if he gives in to Syrian
pressure, leaving him with little politi
cal support among his own Christian
people it he cancels the accord.
The first indications of the split be
tween the Gemayel family and the
Lebanese Forces came last week when
Pierre Gemayel. speaking as head of the
Phalangist Party, the dominant faction
of the four-party coalition making up
the Lebanese Forces, said he backed the
eight-point plan that provided in part
for the abrogation of the 19X3 treaty,
conditioned on Syria's agreement with
all of the plan's provisions. The same
day the Lebanese Forces issued a state
ment reaffirming the militia's whole
hearted support for the May 17 accord
with Israel.
Frem said yesterday he had "no writ
ten guarantees whatsoever" of Israeli
support for Gemayel if he agrees to
sign the accord.
