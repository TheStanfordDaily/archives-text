## Streleski evaluation ends 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
A psychiatric evaluation for convicted killer Theodore
Streleski ended yesterday, according to Lt. Bill Hartwell,
a spokesman for the Vacaville State Medical Facility,
where doctors conducted the test.
Neither Hartwell nor Phil Guthrie, spokesman for the
California Department of Corrections, would release
any results of Streleski's testing. Guthrie said the cor
rections department will "make the information public
in about a week, after we evaluate the report."
But KRON-TV reported last night that the test
results would be released tomorrow.
In 1978, Streleski murdered Stanford Mathematics
Prof. Karel deLeeuw and received an eight-year sen
tence, with a possible parole after serving two-thirds of
the term.
Streleski, who is due to be paroled to San Francisco
March 23, alarmed the public last month by claiming in
interviews that he was "absolutely noncommittal"
about whether he would murder again, prompting the
corrections department to order the psychiatric review.
On Feb. 3, Streleski was transferred from Soledad Prison
to Vacaville for the evaluation.
A spokeswoman for San Francisco Mayor Dianne
Feinstein said yesterday that the mayor has written the
corrections department requesting that Streleski be
released elsewhere.

"I cannot in good conscience," she wrote, "allow a per
son of such demonstrated instability to take up
residence here without my opposition. In short, I do not
believe San Francisco is the place for this dangerous and
remorseless parolee."
Streleski had not agreed to undergo mental tests
before moving to Vacaville, but "he talked freely with
the psychiatrists" once there, Guthrie said, indicating
that he does in fact want to leave prison despite his ear
lier refusal to cooperate and his stoic comments to
reporters.
If the doctors at Vacaville determine that Streleski is
dangerous, he may be kept in custody for a period not
exceeding ISO days. The period is renewable. But if he
has not been found dangerous, he will be paroled as
scheduled.
In a letter responding to Feinstein, the corrections de
partment said the parole date is "fixed by law" and thus
not subject to change. The letter did not say the loca
tion of parole was unalterable, however.
Guthrie called the decision to release Streleski to San
Francisco a "fairly routine" one. based on where the con
vict most recently lived. "But we may want to re
evaluate (that decision)," Guthrie said.
Feinstein and others may take legal action to ensure
that Streleski is not paroled to San Francisco. University
spokesmen refuse to comment on what measures, if any,
Stanford is taking to keep Streleski away from campus.
