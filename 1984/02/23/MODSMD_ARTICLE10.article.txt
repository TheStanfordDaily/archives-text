# Key leader threatens to withdraw support

From the Los Angeles Times
Beirut, Lebanon â€” Former Lebanese
President Camille Chamoun announced
yesterday that he would withdraw his
support from President Amin Gemayel
and would not attend any negotiations
aimed at national reconciliation if
Gemayel cancels Lebanon's troop
withdrawal and security agreement
with Israel.
Chamoun heads a Lebanese Christian
bloc known as the National Liberal
Party and his threat indicated growing
opposition to Gemayel from within his
own Maronite Christian sect. Earlier,

Fadi Frem, commander of the Christian
Phalangist militia, had said that he,
too, would become a political opponent
of Gemayel's if the pact is rescinded.
"Gemayel's main problem is going to
be his own people," said one long-time
Lebanese analyst. "They want the
(troop-withdrawal) agreement ratified
and they also want to establish stronger
ties with Israel."
"It has caused a split in the Phalange
Party," he said. The party was founded
by the president's father, Pierre, who
has already agreed that the pact may
have to be thrown out if the younger

Gemayel is to remain in office.
The agreement, which was signed by
Israel and Lebanon last May 17 but
which has never been officially ratified
by Lebanon, is at the core ot Lebanon s
current problems. Syria, which supports
Lebanon's powerful Druse and Shia
Moslem factions, is adamantly opposed
to the agreement and insists that
Gemayel must abrogate it before any
other steps can be taken toward
Lebanese national reconciliation.
As Gemayel's problems became more
complex, there were signs yesterday
that negotiators were getting closer to

agreement on a formula for ending the
fighting in Lebanon. The battles pit
Druse and Shia militiamen against the
army, both along the so-called Green
Line that divides Beirut and in the
mountains southeast of the city. There
was sporadic fighting on both fronts
yesterday.
Reports from Damascus said Syria
had agreed to a formula for a settle
ment. including the scuttling of the Is
raeli withdrawal accord. It would also
include the appointment of a new
Lebanese premier and the formation of
a "national union."
