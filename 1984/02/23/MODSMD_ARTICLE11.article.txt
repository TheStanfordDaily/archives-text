## Auditors are never too old or enthusiastic

"Oh, oh, it's so exciting,"
said Florence Sund, one of
the grey-haired ladies who
has been doing it for four
years now. "All the way
along it's been such a
growing experience."
For Sylvia Cohen, an unas
suming, ex-housewife orig
inally from Chicago, her
experience has been more
sedate, but no less reward
ing. "I was 16 the last time I
had this," she said. "It has
given me a sense of
maturity and understand
ing."
Falling in love at Stan
ford, they say, can happen
to anyone.
But Mr. Sund and Mr.
Cohen need not fear compe
tition from other men. On
the contrary, their wives,
like many other women,
have fallen in love with
learning as auditors.
Present in almost any
class from art history to cal
culus, auditors are people
from the community who
are interested in learning.
They attend classes, often
without charge, and are free
to participate in any class,
subject to the professor's
approval.
"It's a fantastic thing to
be able to do," said Cohen.
"It's wonderful and should
be taken advantage of."
While many students
grudgingly take distribution
requirements like the

Humanities 62 class which
Cohen attends, none of the
educational value or sheer
enjoyment for learning is
lost on her.
"Humanities was an area
that was deficient in my
background," she said. "A
friend got me involved, and
I am utterly engrossed with
the class and enthralled
with the instructor."
"Enthralled" doesn't
quite describe Florence
Sund's love of auditing and
learning. For her, the feeling
is nothing short of euphoria.
"I guess what I take away
from my classes is an absorb
ing interest to go on," said

Sund. "I usually park by
DeGuerre Pool so that
after class I have time to
come back to earth. It's so
exciting."
Yet, like most of the
auditors, she restrains her
boundless enthusiasm in
class and carefully avoids all
sections.
"1 try very hard not to
participate at all," she said.
"I'm just bursting
sometimes to say something
but I'm afraid I might say
something before the stu
dent. In section, I don't
think I could possibly keep
my mouth shut."
Like Cohen, Sund tends
to take classes outside her

previous areas of knowl
edge, concentrating on
literature and, more
recently, science.
"I'm in a history of cos
mology class now that's
leading into physics," she
said while waving her hands
in the air, expressing a com
bination of enthusiasm and
anticipation which made her
seem as if she were trying to
launch into orbit. "I have
never known anything about
physics before, but I'm so
excited about it now that I
could just burst."
Women, however, are not
the only people auditing
classes. Harry Druker, a
lawyer from lowa, visits

Stanford each winter with
his wife and enrolls in two or
three classes, usually in the
social sciences.
But the Drukers, while in
terested in the educational
aspects of the classes they
attend, find interaction
with students to be particu
larly exciting.
"One of the principle
benefits," Druker said, "is
rubbing elbows with young
people who are distinctly su
perior."
He said the professors
provide "an extremely high
level of teaching." Al
though he, too, is wary of
participating in class,
Druker pointed out that he

often "engages the profes
sors in discussion after class
or during office hours."
While none of the
auditors actively participate
in taking tests or writing
papers, the Drukers do like
to get copies of the exam
questions and go over them
at home.
"We're gleaners," he said.
"We learn an awful lot."
Although many auditors,
due to some affiliation with
the University, are eligible
to audit classes for free,
there is a fee — $730 per
quarter — for people with
no ties to Stanford.
Associate Registrar
Robert Houghton said he
would like to see the num
ber of auditors "con
trolled," however.
Many auditors do not
receive an official okay to
attend a class and therefore
cannot be accurately moni
tored. Instead, they ask the
professor directly and ne
glect to inform the
registrar's office.
While Houghton said that
"we don't really do a lot of
policing," he did express dis
approval for those who
audit "illegally."
"It's like going to the
movies and you know the
fellow who collects the tick
ets and he lets you in for
free," Houghton said.
Houghton admitted,
however, that he "can't re
member any complaints
from professors."
