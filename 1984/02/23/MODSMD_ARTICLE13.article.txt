## The
						Stanford Daily Nuclear power obsolete 
### 
In the 19705, as the costs of oil and natural
gas doubled and tripled and cars waited in
around-the-block gasoline lines, nuclear power
was touted as the elixir to our nation's energy
woes. The supply-and-demand problem would be
solved by harnessing the atom. Nuclear power
plants were proposed and approved ad infinitem
— they would produce electricity "too cheap to
meter."
More than a decade later, the price tag on
these high tech fortresses has gotten, well, too
expensive to tabulate. The Shoreham plant on
New York's Long Island will cost at least $4 bil
lion, 15 times the initial projection. New
Hampshire's Seabrook facility is pegged at al
most $6 billion and Marble Hill, in Indiana, will
cost $7 billion, much of it taxpayer money, it
it's ever completed. The Department of Energy
reports that three-quarters of the nuclear
plants surveyed cost at least twice as much as
originally estimated, and one-quarter were four
times higher.
In addition. Washington's "Whoops" power
system defaulted on more than $2 billion in
bonds last July, sending shockwaves throughout
financial sectors.
Besides cost overruns, a great majority of
America's 82 nuclear power plants have been
delayed, abandoned or canceled. Shoreham is
already a decade behind schedule. More than 100
plants have been canceled, many of them mid
way through construction, thereby throwing bil
lions of dollars away. Experts and laymen alike

are questioning — and rightfully so — the eco
nomic sense of nuclear power.
From a safety standpoint, nuclear power has
never stood on solid ground. One of the chief
by-products of a nuclear power reaction is
plutonium — that same plutonium scientists
use to build nuclear bombs. Transporting
plutonium — a necessary, but undesirable
process when using nuclear power — be it by
truck, rail, ship or air. makes the deadk metal
vulnerable to terrorists seeking this ke\ bomb
ingredient.
Other hazards do exist in the nuclear power
industry. Finding a safe and popular wa\ to
store nuclear waste has baffled scientists for
years. The prospect of meltdowns and other
Three Mile lsland/O/wa Syndrome-type situa
tions persist.
Nuclear power does contribute 13 percent of
our nation's total energy use. While this figure
may appear impressive, it hardly justifies the
billions of dollars that this administration has
sunk into what is basically private business. If
matching funds were earmarked for alternative
energies — solar, photovoltaic cells and conser
vation technologies, to name a few — America
could continue in its effort to phase out costly
and unreliable fossil fuels/nuclear power and
produce its own energy in a safer and more eco
nomic manner.
Nuclear power was a bold experiment, but we
would all be better off if scientists, politicians
and taxpayers invested their resources in altern
ative energy in the future.
