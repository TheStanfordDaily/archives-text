# The 						speech glut
## 
### 
A Hoover Institution fellow arrived at Bran
ner Hall recently to give a lecture sponsored by
the Inter-Fraternity Council on U.S.-Soviet re
lations, only to be greeted by an audience of one
— a Daily reporter.
State Assemblyman Byron Shcr (D-Palo
Alto) had a "town meeting" several weeks ago
that was attended by two of the meeting's or
ganizers and, again, a Daily reporter.
These incidents point to a problem: a glut of
disorganized lectures on campus.
Lectures are, potentially, one of the most en
riching extracurricular activities on campus. The
thought they provoke and the diversity of
perspectives they provide are two of the factors
which distinguish a noted university from a cor
respondence course.
Yet it now appears that some of the opportu
nity outside speakers afford is going to waste.
Several unsettling things occur when a lecture
suffers a bare-bones turn out. Primarily, the
community fails to profit from the insight the
speaker has to offer. But also, in the long run,
the University is likely to lose access to a
valuable resource — the speaker.
There are an untold number of lecture series
and individual lectures on campus, sponsored by

a wide array of organizations, interest groups
and living groups. Such a large number of
lectures makes it impossible to derive full bene
fit from each lecture. The lecture market has
simply reached a point of diminishing returns.
The solution to this problem lies in fewer, but
more coordinated, lectures. The logical place to
cut back is in the dorms. It is essential for the
purposes of many organizations to sponsor
lectures, but the link between dorms and
lectures does not seem as vital.
Many of the dorms sponsor lectures to fulfill
the important commitment to residential edu
cation. We suggest that these dorms instead
channel their energies into other activities.
In light of University President Donald Ken
nedy's current emphasis on public service, it
seems particularly appropriate for dorms to
turn their attention to helping the community.
Examples include tutoring area children, visiting
shut-ins and working for the Red Cross. These
are all areas in which the dorms are more capable
of having a direct impact on many people, thus
serving the community and residential educa
tion more effectively than through lectures.
Such a redirection will also alleviate the lecture
glut, which Stanford currently seems either un
willing or unable to support.
