## Suggestions for Food Service 
### 
One of the most important issues
directly affecting student life on
campus this year is the outcome of
the Sterling Quad Food Service ex
periment. The success or failure of
this program will determine if an a la
carte program may eventually he in
stituted throughout the campus.
Having been actively involved with
the ASSU Food Service Task Force
for three years now, we would like to

VIEWPOINT

indicate our feelings regarding the
administration's responses to our
proposals.
Let us begin by stating that we are
generally pleased with the responses
we have received from the adminis
tration.
Our first recommendation was
that the University run an experi
ment in one dorm to test the merits
of an a la carte system. We will
return to this recommendation after
we have covered the others.
Our second recommendation was
for the University to investigate the
potential advantages and dis
advantages of hiring a private con
tractor. This recommendation was
based on the belief that private con
tractors have greater economies of
scale and a more effective incentive
scheme to keep labor costs lower,
thereby satisfying students' need at
a lower cost (because its contract
could be renewed annually, customer
dissatisfaction could cause a private
contractor to lose his contract).
The University examined the
private contracting alternative and
determined that cost benefits of
such a degree were not feasible and
that Residential Education would
suffer by a switch to private con
tracting. As we will explain, we still
believe substantial savings can he at
tained by another method: an a la
carte system.
Our third recommendation was
that the University consider employ
ing magnetic cards for Food Service
and other campus needs. Sally
Mahoney, the registrar, is in charge

of investigating the uses and possible
implementation of machine readable
identification cards. Although she
says the University will eventually
adopt some type of machine
readable card (with its emphasis on li
brary usage), it is a system that has
not yet been chosen and the
timetable for implementation is un
certain. On the other hand, the
future use of magnetic Food Service
cards appears to be much more cer
tain. The use of magnetic cards at
Sterling Ouad has been a big success
and there is a good chance that the
card will be used throughout the
campus in the near future.
Our fourth recommendation was
that the University-operated Row
houses be converted to self-operated
houses. The University-operated
Row houses lost more than $130,000
last year and have a history of being
subsidized by the economies of scale
of the larger dorms. If the Row
houses were all self-operated, the
University would not incur these
losses. At the same time, students
would be able to receive generally the
same quality of food and have an
open kitchen available throughout
the day and night, at approximately
the same cost.
We will now try to bring the reader
• up to date on the Sterling Ouad ex
periment from the viewpoint of the
Food Service Task Force. The mem
bers of the Task Force recommended
experimentation with an a la carte
program because we believed that a
system in which students pay for
each individual item would reduce
waste, prevent light eaters from sub
sidizing heavy eaters and provide the
kitchen management with a better
idea of what students like, dislike
and are prepared to pay for items by
charting the quantities of food pur
chased at various prices.
We are extremely pleased that the
administration has decided to try an
a la carte experiment, but there are
still a few bugs in the system.
The major problem is the
high cost of the Food Service plan.
We concur with the administration

that students in the a la carte experi
ment should pay a certain minimum
each quarter to ensure the opportu
nity for nutritional balance and suc
cessful Residential Education
program.
We strongly question, however,
the fact that even the lightest eater
can only achieve a $47 fall quarter
rebate which really becomes a credit
in his/her Food Service account until
the end of the year. Light eaters
should have the opportunity to save
more than this $47 they are currently
allowed. At the end of each quarter,
when these people realize that they
are about to "lose" money if they are
over the $47 limit, they will begin to
hoard food (and re-create the waste
we are trying to prevent) and a
point-exchange program between
light and heavy eaters could result.
Sterling Quad Food Service statis
tics for December 1983 appear to
substantiate these predicted results.
Only eight of more than 300 stu
dents needed to purchase extra food
points from Food Service, and the
average student had a carry-over of
$34.61. This carry-over is significant,
considering the spending binges of
the last two weeks of the quarter.
Why is the cost of Food Service so
high? One of the reasons is that the
minimum cost is determined by
totalling all "fixed" cost. Because of
the nature of the experiment, labor
costs have been considered to be a
fixed cost. It seems apparent that
labor costs should not be considered a
fixed cost, but a variable cost. This
alternative would give students more
points to buy food with, accordingly.
The Food Service Task Force sup
ports the administration in its con
tinuing efforts to enhance the Food
Service programs. We hope to see the
bugs in the Sterling Quad experiment
resolved and eventually have an a la
carte program extended across
campus.

more than this $47 they are currently
allowed. At the end of each quarter,
when these people realize that they
are about to "lose" money if they are
over the $47 limit, they will begin to
hoard food (and re-create the waste
we are trying to prevent) and a
point-exchange program between
light and heavy eaters could result.
Sterling Quad Food Service statis
tics for December 1983 appear to
substantiate these predicted results.
Only eight of more than 300 stu
dents needed to purchase extra food
points from Food Service, and the
average student had a carry-over of
$34.61. This carry-over is significant,
considering the spending binges of
the last two weeks of the quarter.
Why is the cost of Food Service so
high? One of the reasons is that the
minimum cost is determined by
totalling all "fixed" cost. Because of
the nature of the experiment, labor
costs have been considered to be a
fixed cost. It seems apparent that
labor costs should not be considered a
fixed cost, but a variable cost. This
alternative would give students more
points to buy food with, accordingly.
The Food Service Task Force sup
ports the administration in its con
tinuing efforts to enhance the Food
Service programs. We hope to see the
bugs in the Sterling Quad experiment
resolved and eventually have an a la
carte program extended across
campus.

One of the most important issues
directly affecting student life on
campus this year is the outcome of
the Sterling Quad Food Service ex
periment. The success or failure of
this program will determine if an a la
carte program may eventually he in
stituted throughout the campus.
Having been actively involved with
the ASSU Food Service Task Force
for three years now, we would like to

VIEWPOINT

indicate our feelings regarding the
administration's responses to our
proposals.
Let us begin by stating that we are
generally pleased with the responses
we have received from the adminis
tration.
Our first recommendation was
that the University run an experi
ment in one dorm to test the merits
of an a la carte system. We will
return to this recommendation after
we have covered the others.
Our second recommendation was
for the University to investigate the
potential advantages and dis
advantages of hiring a private con
tractor. This recommendation was
based on the belief that private con
tractors have greater economies of
scale and a more effective incentive
scheme to keep labor costs lower,
thereby satisfying students' need at
a lower cost (because its contract
could be renewed annually, customer
dissatisfaction could cause a private
contractor to lose his contract).
The University examined the
private contracting alternative and
determined that cost benefits of
such a degree were not feasible and
that Residential Education would
suffer by a switch to private con
tracting. As we will explain, we still
believe substantial savings can he at
tained by another method: an a la
carte system.
Our third recommendation was
that the University consider employ
ing magnetic cards for Food Service
and other campus needs. Sally
Mahoney, the registrar, is in charge

of investigating the uses and possible
implementation of machine readable
identification cards. Although she
says the University will eventually
adopt some type of machine
readable card (with its emphasis on li
brary usage), it is a system that has
not yet been chosen and the
timetable for implementation is un
certain. On the other hand, the
future use of magnetic Food Service
cards appears to be much more cer
tain. The use of magnetic cards at
Sterling Ouad has been a big success
and there is a good chance that the
card will be used throughout the
campus in the near future.
Our fourth recommendation was
that the University-operated Row
houses be converted to self-operated
houses. The University-operated
Row houses lost more than $130,000
last year and have a history of being
subsidized by the economies of scale
of the larger dorms. If the Row
houses were all self-operated, the
University would not incur these
losses. At the same time, students
would be able to receive generally the
same quality of food and have an
open kitchen available throughout
the day and night, at approximately
the same cost.
We will now try to bring the reader
• up to date on the Sterling Ouad ex
periment from the viewpoint of the
Food Service Task Force. The mem
bers of the Task Force recommended
experimentation with an a la carte
program because we believed that a
system in which students pay for
each individual item would reduce
waste, prevent light eaters from sub
sidizing heavy eaters and provide the
kitchen management with a better
idea of what students like, dislike
and are prepared to pay for items by
charting the quantities of food pur
chased at various prices.
We are extremely pleased that the
administration has decided to try an
a la carte experiment, but there are
still a few bugs in the system.
The major problem is the
high cost of the Food Service plan.
We concur with the administration

that students in the a la carte experi
ment should pay a certain minimum
each quarter to ensure the opportu
nity for nutritional balance and suc
cessful Residential Education
program.
We strongly question, however,
the fact that even the lightest eater
can only achieve a $47 fall quarter
rebate which really becomes a credit
in his/her Food Service account until
the end of the year. Light eaters
should have the opportunity to save
more than this $47 they are currently
allowed. At the end of each quarter,
when these people realize that they
are about to "lose" money if they are
over the $47 limit, they will begin to
hoard food (and re-create the waste
we are trying to prevent) and a
point-exchange program between
light and heavy eaters could result.
Sterling Quad Food Service statis
tics for December 1983 appear to
substantiate these predicted results.
Only eight of more than 300 stu
dents needed to purchase extra food
points from Food Service, and the
average student had a carry-over of
$34.61. This carry-over is significant,
considering the spending binges of

tinuing efforts to enhance the Food
Service programs. We hope to see the
bugs in the Sterling Quad experiment
resolved and eventually have an a la
carte program extended across
campus.
