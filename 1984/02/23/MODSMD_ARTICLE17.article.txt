# UNESCO pull out overdue
## 
### 
At the end of this year the embarrassing number of
U.S.-supported anti-West international organizations
will drop by one. On December 31, 1984, the United
States will withdraw from the United Nations Educa
tional. Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
No longer will the United States' presence and funding
legitimize the repugnant activities of UNESCO — the
perfect example of a well-intended international body
infected by the self-serving propaganda of totalitarian
regimes.
After a six-month study of U.S. involvement in
UNESCO, the U.S. Bureau of International Organization
Affairs cited UNESCO's extraneously politicizing
"virtually every subject it deals with ... a hostility
toward the basic institutions of a free society . . . (and)
unrestrained budgetary expansion" as grounds for the
planned U.S. withdrawal.
UNESCO began operations in 1946. Not surprisingly,
the Soviet Union and its Eastern-bloc allies declined to
join initially; UNESCO's constitutional commitment to
the "universal respect for justice, for the rule of the
law, and fundamental freedoms . . . for the people of
the world" were unquestionably distasteful to Stalin
and his totalitarian cohorts.
The United Nations' 1948 Universal Declaration on
Human Rights (which UNESCO is obliged to support)
must have been equally revolting to the Soviets. It
states that "everyone has the right to freedom of
opinion and expression ... to hold opinions without in
terference. and to seek, receive and impart information
and ideas through any media ..." Soviet membership in
UNESCO would have been as appalling as the Grand
Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan's holding a board position on
the NAACP.
But after 10 years of beneficial intellectual exchange
between Western Europe and the United States in
UNESCO, the Soviets decided they too might profit from
membership in UNESCO, despite the organization's
commitment to ideals offensive to Soviet idealogues.
They joined that organization in 1957 with the Eastern
bloc countries following suit faster than the critics could
ask, "What about the work camps, the executions, the
state-controlled media?"
East-West skirmishes pervaded UNESCO conferences
through the mid-1960s until the newly independent
African and Asian countries of the Third World entered
international politics and joined UNESCO.
The Soviets wasted no time in exploiting the predica
ments of the emerging Third World nations. Skilled So
viet propagandists manipulated Third World opinion
under the noses of lazy Western UNESCO bureaucrats
and forged a strong anti-Western majority alliance that
penetrated all levels of the UNESCO bureaucracy. The
Western corporations and press were targeted by
totalitarian ideologues and attacked for alleged eco
nomic exploitation of developing nations and negative
media representation.
The new anti-West Soviet bloc/Third World majority
tainted resolutions of the UNESCO general conference,
as propagandists channelled attacks on Western institu
tions towards assaults on Western values. The out-voted
Western countries and Third World democracies were
forced to adopt a strategy of damage-limitation that
has colored the West's attitude toward UNESCO
resolutions in the last decade. Since the West could not
rally enough support to directly confront increasingly
irksome propositions, Western representatives sought
compromises in which the West lost as little as possible

ideologically and politically.
The West's undeclared adoption of the policy of
damage-limitation in the face ot an insurmountable So
viet bloc/Third World majority effectively made
UNESCO the tool of anti-Western propagandists. It has
become evident that the majority attaches twisted
meanings to UNESCO's fundamental principles of indi
vidual rights and freedoms of the press, and to its goals
of universal education and respect for cultural identity.
Since the mid-7()s, especially after the election of
Director General Amadou Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal,
the UNESCO Secretariat, with the support of the So
viet bloc/Third World alliance, has endeavored to
redefine the basic tenets of UNESCO's constitution.
The sacred principles of "individual rights" are being sup
planted by notions of "collective rights" and "rights of
peoples," insidious code phrases cleverly introduced by
totalitarian ideologues to justify the oppression of indi
viduals for the good of the state.
The last six years have seen a strong push in UNESCO
for the establishment of a "New World Information Or
der" contrived to promote "a more balanced dissemina
tion of information." It takes little imagination to see
through this clever contrivance of totalitarian
propagandists attempting to legitimize a state
controlled media.
UNESCO has also exhibited deplorable cultural
narrow-mindedness and racial hostility in its repeated
unfounded censures of Israel. In 1974 UNESCO went so
far as to expel Israel from participation. In a rare display
of decisiveness, the United States promptly suspended
payment of its hefty contribution to UNESCO's opera
tional funding until Israel was reinstated two years later.
UNESCO's attitude toward education, too, has
become regrettably perverted. Thanks to the Soviet
bloc/Third World majority's ideological subvevsvon,
UNESCO's mission of universal education is tending increas
ingly toward indoctrination. Proposals call for "the
correct reflection ... of the history . . . of the peoples
of the world." Recommendations pivot on motions to
"improve textbook content to foster particular atti
tudes and values."
At a recent conference on education, the West
grimaced at the absurd claims by the Ukranian S.S.R. of
teaching students "respect for human rights and funda
mental freedoms." The sort of education by indoctrina
tion embodied in the Soviet education system and
similar institutions of other totalitarian regimes clearly
reflect the educational ideals of UNESCO's totalitarian
majority.
Under the ideological dominance of the Soviet
bloc/Third World majority, UNESCO has ceased to be an
organization committed to individual freedom and the
free exchange of ideas. Its fundamental constitutional
ideals have been buried under resolutions with
totalitarian code words attempting to legally justily the
oppression of individual freedom.
Though UNESCO has made valuable contributions to
world literacy and has brought helpful scientific knowl
edge to developing nations, its grossly anti-West politics
force the United States to divert its resources to other
means of international cooperation which are devoted
to UNESCO's original goals. No longer will the United
States endorse with its presence and funding the
ideological crucifixion of the West by enemies ol
freedom in UNESCO.

UNESCO, the Soviets decided they too might profit from
membership in UNESCO, despite the organization's
commitment to ideals offensive to Soviet idealogues.
They joined that organization in 1957 with the Eastern
bloc countries following suit faster than the critics could
ask, "What about the work camps, the executions, the
state-controlled media?"
East-West skirmishes pervaded UNESCO conferences
through the mid-1960s until the newly independent
African and Asian countries of the Third World entered
international politics and joined UNESCO.
The Soviets wasted no time in exploiting the predica
ments of the emerging Third World nations. Skilled So
viet propagandists manipulated Third World opinion
under the noses of lazy Western UNESCO bureaucrats
and forged a strong anti-Western majority alliance that
penetrated all levels of the UNESCO bureaucracy. The
Western corporations and press were targeted by
totalitarian ideologues and attacked for alleged eco
nomic exploitation of developing nations and negative
media representation.
The new anti-West Soviet bloc/Third World majority
tainted resolutions of the UNESCO general conference,
as propagandists channelled attacks on Western institu
tions towards assaults on Western values. The out-voted
Western countries and Third World democracies were
forced to adopt a strategy of damage-limitation that
has colored the West's attitude toward UNESCO
resolutions in the last decade. Since the West could not
rally enough support to directly confront increasingly
irksome propositions, Western representatives sought
compromises in which the West lost as little as possible

ideologically and politically.
The West's undeclared adoption of the policy of
damage-limitation in the face ot an insurmountable So
viet bloc/Third World majority effectively made
UNESCO the tool of anti-Western propagandists. It has
become evident that the majority attaches twisted
meanings to UNESCO's fundamental principles of indi
vidual rights and freedoms of the press, and to its goals
of universal education and respect for cultural identity.
Since the mid-7()s, especially after the election of
Director General Amadou Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal,
the UNESCO Secretariat, with the support of the So
viet bloc/Third World alliance, has endeavored to
redefine the basic tenets of UNESCO's constitution.
The sacred principles of "individual rights" are being sup
planted by notions of "collective rights" and "rights of
peoples," insidious code phrases cleverly introduced by
totalitarian ideologues to justify the oppression of indi
viduals for the good of the state.
The last six years have seen a strong push in UNESCO
for the establishment of a "New World Information Or
der" contrived to promote "a more balanced dissemina
tion of information." It takes little imagination to see
through this clever contrivance of totalitarian
propagandists attempting to legitimize a state
controlled media.
UNESCO has also exhibited deplorable cultural
narrow-mindedness and racial hostility in its repeated
unfounded censures of Israel. In 1974 UNESCO went so
far as to expel Israel from participation. In a rare display
of decisiveness, the United States promptly suspended
payment of its hefty contribution to UNESCO's opera
tional funding until Israel was reinstated two years later.
UNESCO's attitude toward education, too, has
become regrettably perverted. Thanks to the Soviet
bloc/Third World majority's ideological subvevsvon,
UNESCO's mission of universal education is tending increas
ingly toward indoctrination. Proposals call for "the
correct reflection ... of the history . . . of the peoples
of the world." Recommendations pivot on motions to
"improve textbook content to foster particular atti
tudes and values."
At a recent conference on education, the West
grimaced at the absurd claims by the Ukranian S.S.R. of
teaching students "respect for human rights and funda
mental freedoms." The sort of education by indoctrina
tion embodied in the Soviet education system and
similar institutions of other totalitarian regimes clearly
reflect the educational ideals of UNESCO's totalitarian
majority.
Under the ideological dominance of the Soviet
bloc/Third World majority, UNESCO has ceased to be an
organization committed to individual freedom and the
free exchange of ideas. Its fundamental constitutional
ideals have been buried under resolutions with
totalitarian code words attempting to legally justily the
oppression of individual freedom.
Though UNESCO has made valuable contributions to
world literacy and has brought helpful scientific knowl
edge to developing nations, its grossly anti-West politics
force the United States to divert its resources to other
means of international cooperation which are devoted
to UNESCO's original goals. No longer will the United
States endorse with its presence and funding the
ideological crucifixion of the West by enemies ol
freedom in UNESCO.

At the end of this year the embarrassing number of
U.S.-supported anti-West international organizations
will drop by one. On December 31, 1984, the United
States will withdraw from the United Nations Educa
tional. Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
No longer will the United States' presence and funding
legitimize the repugnant activities of UNESCO — the
perfect example of a well-intended international body
infected by the self-serving propaganda of totalitarian
regimes.
After a six-month study of U.S. involvement in
UNESCO, the U.S. Bureau of International Organization
Affairs cited UNESCO's extraneously politicizing
"virtually every subject it deals with ... a hostility
toward the basic institutions of a free society . . . (and)
unrestrained budgetary expansion" as grounds for the
planned U.S. withdrawal.
UNESCO began operations in 1946. Not surprisingly,
the Soviet Union and its Eastern-bloc allies declined to
join initially; UNESCO's constitutional commitment to
the "universal respect for justice, for the rule of the
law, and fundamental freedoms . . . for the people of
the world" were unquestionably distasteful to Stalin
and his totalitarian cohorts.
The United Nations' 1948 Universal Declaration on
Human Rights (which UNESCO is obliged to support)
must have been equally revolting to the Soviets. It
states that "everyone has the right to freedom of
opinion and expression ... to hold opinions without in
terference. and to seek, receive and impart information
and ideas through any media ..." Soviet membership in
UNESCO would have been as appalling as the Grand
Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan's holding a board position on
the NAACP.
But after 10 years of beneficial intellectual exchange
between Western Europe and the United States in
UNESCO, the Soviets decided they too might profit from
membership in UNESCO, despite the organization's
commitment to ideals offensive to Soviet idealogues.
