# University kept decision quiet
## Nurse finds water unflouridated 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
It took the initiative of a pediatrics nurse from
Cowell Student Health Center to publicize the Univer
sity's decision to discontinue flouridation of drinking
water â€” a decision the University kept quiet for almost
a year.
Kathy Thurston, the Cowell nurse, catalyzed the
public announcement last week that the University has
not been tlouridating its drinking water.
"I really don't understand why they didn't make an ef
fort to publicize it earlier," she said. "They were well
aware of the problem."
Martin Pearson, the assistant director of Utilities
Systems, admitted that a one-year lapse before the
public learned of the flouridation system's failure was
not "properly explainable."
"We probably should have notifed the residents earlier
that the equipment was not in fact functioning," he
said.
Thurston first found out about the lack of flourida
tion in December from a patient who had heard a rumor
about the University's decision. Thurston said when she

contacted the University's Department of Health and
Safety, administrators there "confirmed that flourida
tion had not been going on for some time" but advised
her against putting an explanatory notice in the Escon
dido Voice, a newspaper distributed to Escondido resi
dents.
Thurston then took her findings to Paul Walters, the
director of Cowell, who in turn worked with the Office
of Housing Programs to produce a memo to campus resi
dents cautioning them about the lack of flouridation in
their water and advising them to find alternative sources
of flouride for their children.
The memo was hand-delivered to Escondido Village
residents last week and is destined to arrive in the
mailboxes of faculty campus residents tomorrow.
According to Walters, not all communities put
flouride in their drinking water, so it is important to let
residents know whether their drinking water contains
the chemical.
"People are used to a controversy surrounding whether
