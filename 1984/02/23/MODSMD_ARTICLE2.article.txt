# University kept decision quiet
## Nurse finds water unflouridated 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
It took the initiative of a pediatrics nurse from
Cowell Student Health Center to publicize the Univer
sity's decision to discontinue flouridation of drinking
water â€” a decision the University kept quiet for almost
a year.
Kathy Thurston, the Cowell nurse, catalyzed the
public announcement last week that the University has
not been tlouridating its drinking water.
"I really don't understand why they didn't make an ef
fort to publicize it earlier," she said. "They were well
aware of the problem."
Martin Pearson, the assistant director of Utilities
Systems, admitted that a one-year lapse before the
public learned of the flouridation system's failure was
not "properly explainable."
"We probably should have notifed the residents earlier
that the equipment was not in fact functioning," he
said.
Thurston first found out about the lack of flourida
tion in December from a patient who had heard a rumor
about the University's decision. Thurston said when she

contacted the University's Department of Health and
Safety, administrators there "confirmed that flourida
tion had not been going on for some time" but advised
her against putting an explanatory notice in the Escon
dido Voice, a newspaper distributed to Escondido resi
dents.
Thurston then took her findings to Paul Walters, the
director of Cowell, who in turn worked with the Office
of Housing Programs to produce a memo to campus resi
dents cautioning them about the lack of flouridation in
their water and advising them to find alternative sources
of flouride for their children.
The memo was hand-delivered to Escondido Village
residents last week and is destined to arrive in the
mailboxes of faculty campus residents tomorrow.
According to Walters, not all communities put
flouride in their drinking water, so it is important to let
residents know whether their drinking water contains
the chemical.
"People are used to a controversy surrounding whether

or not to flouridate the water," he
said. "The crucial question is: Are
they or aren't they putting flouride
in the water?"
Walters said flouride protects
children until the age of 15 against
tooth decay while they accumulate
their permanent teeth. Children who
do not receive flouride in their drink
ing water should compensate with al
ternatives such as flouride pills or
drops, Walters said.

Cheryl Jensen, manager of
Utilities Systems, said for the past
three years the University's flouride
treatment stations have been a
"major maintenance headache."
Flouride in the drinking water, while
protecting young children's teeth
from cavities, also erodes its own dis
pensing equipment.
When the last of the three sta
tions became defunct in February
1983, Utilities Systems made no ef
fort to notify University residents
of the system's failure.
Jensen described repairing the sys
tems as "robbing Peter to pay Paul."
Utilities Systems could not afford to

replace the deteriorated parts be
cause the equipment for the Stan
ford system was no longer in stock
and required a high price to be spe
cially manufactured. Jensen said.
"We reached a point where we had
to replace mechanical parts such as
pumps and meters," she said. At that
point, in February, the systems
ceased to operate.
According to Pearson, much of the
delay in notifying campus residents
stemmed not from an intentional
cover-up but from administrative
deliberations over the feasibility ot
repairing the deteriorated system.
He said Utilities Systems did not de

termine until August that it could
continue to flouridate drinking
water only by purchasing a new
$300,000 system.
The discussions in Utilities Sys
tems then began to focus on the
tradeoff between foregoing an ex
pensive new system and the public's
wishes for flouridated water.
According to Jensen. Utilities in
tended to gauge this tradeoff with a
public opinion survey, but the survey
was superceded by the Feb. 15 memo.
Jensen said Utilities will now forego
the survey because the Office of
Housing Programs' memo should
spark the necessary public input.
