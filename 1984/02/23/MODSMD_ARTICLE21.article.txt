## Hoop crew hopes to tame WSU, but beating Cougars not easy 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
For the first time this
season, vengeance won't be a
motive for the Stanford bas
ketball team.
When Coach Tom Davis and
his Cardinal face Washington

State tonight at 7:30 p.m. on
Friel Court. they will
encounter the new experience
of playing against a team they
have already defeated this
season.
Stanford beat the Cougars.
78-74. last month in Maples

Pavilion, the second of what is
now seven straight Pacific-10
Conference victories. Washing
ton State, meanwhile, has hit
hard times and has dropped
eight straight. It is in dead last
in the Pac-10 with a 2-10
league record and an N-14 over
all mark.
But Davis remembers well
the last time two teams with
long winning and losing streaks
met in the Pac-10 this season.
What was supposed to happen
didn't.
In that instance, Stanford
was the benefactor, as it upset
Washington and ended its own
six-game losing streak as well as
the Huskies' six-game win
skein.
Now, coining off an emo
tional home win over UCLA
Saturday, Davis is hoping —
and praying — his team won't
enter Friel Court playing a step
behind and thinking a step
ahead. You see, Stanford plays
co-Pat-10 leader Washington
Saturday night in Seattle, a
definite distraction when you
played the last place team just
two nights earler.
"Washington State is capa
ble of beating any team in this
league." Davis said, "and if you
don't realize that, they'll
knock you off."
Granted, the Cougars
haven't done their share of
knocking off lately (losing the
last eight straight and 12 of
the last 14), but Stanford
hasn't exactly dominated
Washington State in recent
years, especially on Friel Court.
In fact, after Oregon State,
Washington State is the team
that the Cardinal has fared the
worst against in the Pac-10
since 1975. And its gets worse
when you confine the statistics
to only Friel Court games.
There, Stanford is 0-8 since
1975.

Although much of the
Cougars' decided home-court
advantage can be attributed to
the tartan floor which has
since been replaced with nor
mal hardwood, a lot of it has to
do with vocal crowds in the
12,058-seat facility. There's
not much to do in Pullman
besides look at wheat fields
and go to basketball games.
Should Stanford get into a
sticky situation on unfamilar
Friel Court, it will look to
seniors John Revelli and Keith
Jones, who both played well
last against the Los Angeles
schools. Jones leads the team
with a 19.5 points per game
average while Revelli is collect
ing 16.7 points and 8.0
rebounds each outing. Earl
Koberlein and Steve Brown at
forward and freshman John
Paye at point guard are ex
pected to round out Davis'
starting line-up.
For the young Cougars —
who lost over 60 percent ot
their offense to graduation
last year — one freshman,
three sophomores and a junior
are expected to take the court.
First-year Coach Len
Stevens, who replaced the
heralded George Raveling,
plans to start 6-foot-2 junior
Chris Winkler and 6-3 sopho
more Keith Morrison at the
guards, 6-5 freshman Joe
Wallace and 6-8 sophomore
Ricky Brown at the forwards
and 6-9 sophomore Otis Jen
nings at center.
Brian Pollard, the 6-4 junior
forward with a 42-inch vertical
leap, has left the team in
definitely for personal reasons.
Pollard is second on the team in
both scoring (12.0 ppg) and
rebounding (5.0 rpg). Brown
leads the Cougars in scoring
(13.7 ppg) and rebounding (6.4
rpg), while Winkler is the only
other player averaging double
figures scoring (10.7 ppg).

Stanford's Steve Brown will try to rise above the Washington
State Cougars at raucous Friel Court tonight. Though WSU is
2-10 in the Pac-10 this year, the Card has not beaten the
Cougars at Friel in its last eight tries.
