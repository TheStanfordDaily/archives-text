# Stanford Golf Course up to par
## 
### PETER HAVEN 
Well-groomed fairways and
carefully cut greens arc just a
short par five from the center
of Stanford's campus.
The Stanford Golf Course is,
by all accounts, not only one of
the best courses in the area,
but in the country as well.
Just about anyone who has
ever had a first-hand experi
ence with the lush 146-acre
facility can understand why.
Bob Stevens, a 67-year-old gol
fing professional, said, "As far
as I'm concerned, there's not a
golf course in the world as
great as this one. I never get
tired of playing it."
That is a pretty powerful
statement when you consider
that Stevens has played more
than a few rounds of golf on
this course — as well as other
top courses — since he first
saw it 47 years ago.

Stevens is not the only one
who thinks so highly of the
Farm's golfing facility. In
recent years. Golf Digest has
ranked the Stanford course as
one of the 10 best in northern
California and one of the top
50 in the nation. On the col
legiate level. Stanford's course
ranks third, trailing only the
University of New Mexico and
Yale.
By all indications, the
grounds here are superb, but
like all success stories, there arc
a few secrets behind its success.
One of the keys has been main
tenance.
That responsibility falls on
the shoulders of a man whose
experience and devotion indi
cate that he is well-suited for
the task of caring for a golf
course's delicate landscape.
Tom Thatcher, the superin
tendent of the golf course, has

been tending to the needs of
the IS holes for 21 years. It is a
job that keeps Thatcher and
his 11 -man crew busy from 6
a.m. until 3 p.m., seven days a
week. *
"It is basically a 24-hour job
that you try to cut down to 40
hours a week," Thatcher said.
"You can call this job an entity
in itself. It starts at mainte
nance and ends there. It's not
unusual for for a person to put
in 55-56 hours a week, espe
cially during the summer."
Thatcher and his crew are re
sponsible for the course's
irrigation, disease control, fer
tilization. drainage line repair,
tree planting and asphalt lining
for the cart paths, to name but
a few. Of course, they also
have to cut the grass.
" We have to mow 80 acres of
fairways two to three times a
week," he said. "We try to

mow the banks once or twice a
week and the roughs twice a
week. I'd hate to guess at all
the machines we have. There
are a lot of sophisticated types
of equipment."
In addition to a number of
fairway mowers, bank units and
breeze mowers, there is one
fairway unit that costs nearly
$45,000.
Thatcher said the large
amount of work requires great
organization. "We have to del
egate different jobs to each
person," said Thatcher. "At
the end of each day, we try to
organize what we did and what
we are going to do the follow
ing day."
"I'm very proud of the golf
course," he added. "You have
to take a personal love for this
sort of work, otherwise you've
got the wrong job. I get a lot
of satisfaction from this job."
Although the annual main
tenance costs are around
$500,000, the course actually
turns a profit for the Athletic
Department because it is so
pflpulAr. adccirdihg' to"'Philtchc'r.
Unfortunately, this has led to
problems for the University's
golf teams.
"The course is extraor
dinarily heavily played. There
;jre many competing interests
out there," said Tim Schaaf,
head coach of the men's golf
team. "We're (the golf team)
not in a vacuum. There are a
lot of other people who want
to play on the course, and it's
tough to maintain it under
those circumstances."
In order to try to better

meet the golf team's demands
for a well-maintained and
highly competetive course,
Thatcher meets regularly with
Schaaf and Tim Baldwin, the
women's coach. "I'd just like to
see the course keep pace with
the top-notch golfers in the
years ahead." said Baldwin.
"We are trying to get a plan to
improve something fairly major
each year to make it tougher
on the low handicapper with
out hurting the high handicap
per."
"Considering the amount of
play it gets, especially by a lot
of beginners. I personally feel
the course is maintained very
well," Baldwin said.
As might be expected, golf
team members have responded
differently as to how well the
course has held up under the
excessive use.
"1 enjoy playing the course,"
said Cardinal golfer Scott

Erickson, "but I'm pretty dis
satisfied with the upkeep of
the course. 1 know there's a lot
of play, but 1 still feel the up
keep between tournaments
could be better, especially on
the greens. Compared to other
courses in the area. 1 don't feel
they are as well-maintained,"
the junior said.
Senior Kathy Nino, a mem
ber of the women's team, sees
it differently.
"The course is green year
round. It is just as lush
throughout the year as it is in
the summer. We've had some
problem with the greens, but
for the amount of play, the
greenskeepers do an excellent
job. Some public courses in the
area aren't nearly as well
kept," she said.
Still, there is one thing that
few people fail to agree upon
about the course. It has a natu
ral beauty untouched bv what

Baldwin calls, "the con
dominium look."
Larry Oneill, who has
managed the Stanford pro
shop since 1969, cites the
course's natural beauty as its
strongest point.
"The initial layout of the
golf course was good," said
Oneill. "There are no houses or
condos nearby. Everything
around has a natural look, like
the horse barns, corrals, trees
and the creek running through
it. It is very beautiful and pic
turesque, as well as a fine test
of golf."
No doubt Bill Bell, Sr., the
designer of the Stanford Golf
Course back in 1929. would still
be moved by its beauty today.
"Bill Bell, Sr., would still rec
ognize the course today," savs
Thatcher. "It hasn't changed
an awful lot since it was built."
Hopefully it never will.
