# Stanford Golf Course up to par
## 
### PETER HAVEN 
Well-groomed fairways and
carefully cut greens arc just a
short par five from the center
of Stanford's campus.
The Stanford Golf Course is,
by all accounts, not only one of
the best courses in the area,
but in the country as well.
Just about anyone who has
ever had a first-hand experi
ence with the lush 146-acre
facility can understand why.
Bob Stevens, a 67-year-old gol
fing professional, said, "As far
as I'm concerned, there's not a
golf course in the world as
great as this one. I never get
tired of playing it."
That is a pretty powerful
statement when you consider
that Stevens has played more
than a few rounds of golf on
this course — as well as other
top courses — since he first
saw it 47 years ago.

Stevens is not the only one
who thinks so highly of the
Farm's golfing facility. In
recent years. Golf Digest has
ranked the Stanford course as
one of the 10 best in northern
California and one of the top
50 in the nation. On the col
legiate level. Stanford's course
ranks third, trailing only the
University of New Mexico and
Yale.
By all indications, the
grounds here are superb, but
like all success stories, there arc
a few secrets behind its success.
One of the keys has been main
tenance.
That responsibility falls on
the shoulders of a man whose
experience and devotion indi
cate that he is well-suited for
the task of caring for a golf
course's delicate landscape.
Tom Thatcher, the superin
tendent of the golf course, has

been tending to the needs of
the IS holes for 21 years. It is a
job that keeps Thatcher and
his 11 -man crew busy from 6
a.m. until 3 p.m., seven days a
week. *
"It is basically a 24-hour job
that you try to cut down to 40
hours a week," Thatcher said.
"You can call this job an entity
in itself. It starts at mainte
nance and ends there. It's not
unusual for for a person to put
in 55-56 hours a week, espe
cially during the summer."
Thatcher and his crew are re
sponsible for the course's
irrigation, disease control, fer
tilization. drainage line repair,
tree planting and asphalt lining
for the cart paths, to name but
a few. Of course, they also
have to cut the grass.
" We have to mow 80 acres of
fairways two to three times a
week," he said. "We try to

mow the banks once or twice a
week and the roughs twice a
week. I'd hate to guess at all
the machines we have. There
are a lot of sophisticated types
of equipment."
In addition to a number of
fairway mowers, bank units and
breeze mowers, there is one
fairway unit that costs nearly
$45,000.
Thatcher said the large
amount of work requires great
organization. "We have to del
egate different jobs to each
person," said Thatcher. "At
the end of each day, we try to
organize what we did and what
we are going to do the follow
ing day."
"I'm very proud of the golf
course," he added. "You have
to take a personal love for this
sort of work, otherwise you've
