# Card shreds UC-Davis with hitting explosion
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
UC-Davis gave the Stan
ford baseball team a warm
"Aloha" at Sunken Dia
mond yesterday.
The Cardinal took advan
tage of five Davis errors
four in Stanford's six-run
sixth inning — and coasted
to a 10-1 victory over the
Aggies.
Stanford's win, only its
second in the last five
games, improves its record
to 10-8. The Cardinal left
this morning for the Uni
versity of Hawaii, where it
will play four games against
the Rainbows (8-4), who
were ranked in the nation's
top 20 in the preseason.
Single games on Saturday
and Sunday will follow a
Friday doubleheader.
Though stymied in its 5-1
loss to Nevada-Reno Mon
day, Stanford's offense was
relentless yesterday, scoring
two runs in the third and
fifth innings after squan
dering a chance at a big in
ning in the first.
The Card's sixth inning,
though, locked up the win.
With one out, John Ver
ducci, Lyle Smith, Pete
Stanicek, Ruben Amaro,
Darryl Stephens, Mark
Davis and Jeff Ballard
reached base consecutively
after an assortment of
singles, fielders' choices and
errors. Of the seven players
who keyed the rally, Ballard
was the only one not to
score as a batter inter
ference call and a strikeout
ended the inning.

••We hit the ball better
than we have lately. Stan
ford Head C oach Mark
Marquess said. "Hopelully
we'll continue to improve
our hitting.'*
Ballard, who leads the
Stanford pitching stall in
saves (3) and has a 2.60
earned run average, played
first base yesterday. Ballard
was no slouch on ottense
either. collecting two
singles. In the tilth, he
drove home Amaro and
Stephens with a single to
left.
"Ballard's a good hitter.
Marquess said. "He II be
swinging the bat more than
he has been without taking
away from his pitching
(time)."
During Stanford's tall
workouts, Ballard hit the
ball well. prompting
Marquess to suggest that
Ballard could occasionally
serve as the designated hit
ter. "He is also one ol the
team's better defensive
first basemen." Marquess
said.
Ballard's contribution to
the sixth-inning uprising, in
which 12 Card batters took
part, was a single to right
which plated Stephens and
Davis when Aggie Gary
Conn let the ball get by him.
Ballard's hit greeted reliever
Ted Eldridge, who replaced
loser Ron Fritsch.
Stanford's mound corps
kept pace with the of
fense's performance, hold
ing the Aggies (5-12) to six
hits.
Freshman A 1 Osuna (1-0)

had a memorable first vic
tory. going five innings and
giving up four hits, walking
two and picking off two
Davis runners.
Osuna surrendered the
Aggies' unearned run after a
pickoff throw got aw;iy
from Ballard at first, en
abling Doug Franklin to go
to third after a single.
Franklin had reached first
with a ground ball single to
left which third baseman
Amaro missed (he was not
charged with an error) after
Stanicek, Ballard and Greg
l.orenzetti missed a pop
foul. Franklin then scored
on a single.
Another freshman. Rick
Diet/, took the mound in
the sixth inning. Though he
gave up a double and a
single, Davis could not rally
against him. The trio of
Stanford freshman pitchers
was completed when tirst
year man Sean Scheller
breezed through the eighth.
Senior Gregg l.omnicky
pitched an uneventful
ninth.
"Osuna"s going to be good
— and that's true with all
our freshman pitchers,"
Marquess said. "It's just a
matter of time."
"The game was good for
him (Osuna), it gives him
confidence," Marquess con
tinued. "The situations
we've put him in have been
tough and starting took a
lot of pressure off him."
Alter the Hawaii series,
Stanford will return home
before opening the Pacific
-10 season at Arizona.
