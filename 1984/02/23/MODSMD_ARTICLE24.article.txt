# Women's crew: rowing to top
## 
### TRASK LEONARD Guts 
I hat's what it takes to compete in crew. And
for a few women, it's all in a day's work.
While most students are warm and com
tortable in their beds, some dozen women on
varsity crew arise and begin a rigorous workout
at 6:00 a.m. every day. When they arrive at their
training site in Redwood City, they are greeted
hy frigid air and icy water.
"It can get pretty tough and cold at times,''
said Coach John Davis. "But I'm constantly
amazed at their energy and their overall enthusi
asm for the sport, especially this year's group of
rowers."
The conditions are hardly taken too seriously,
however, as most everything is lightheartcd. For
instance, one day when several rowers noticed
the especially choppy waters that make for
tough rowing, the subject was almost immedi
ately forgotten, and the pre-practice chit-chat
returned.
Adding to the bright outlook of the team is
Davis, who believes in hard rowing and less
strenuous conditioning.
"We don't run stadiums like other crews be
cause I feel it's not as valuable as the actual
rowing." commented Davis. "When races arc
won, it's a result of hours and hours of time
spent on the water in the boats."
However, Davis still believes in the necessity
of conditioning his athletes, which is accom
plished by distance running and individual weight
training. Sometimes, the rowers jog with Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy to the Dish.
When the rowers do hit the water, the
coxswain is one of the most important members
of a successful team. The coxswain, who rides at
the rear of the boat does much more than yell,
"Stroke, stroke, stroke!" She is the quarterback
of the team, and as such is responsible for its
leadership and motivation.
Mary Courtney, who coxswains for the team,
fits the hill perfectly, according to Davis.
"Mary is a super coxswain," he explained. "She
has wonderful command of her rowers. She also
steers the boat well, which is very important in
order to maximize the distance covered over a
given time period.
"Mary also has to keep them going even when
they are tired. She has to squeeze the most out
of her boat. And that is what is so vital about
her role."
Davis, explained that other important posi
tions on the eight-woman boats are the fifth
and sixth rowers, who are usually the strongest.

"It's important for these rowers to maintain
a constantly strong surge, so if the front rowers
begin to weaken during the course of the race,
the thrust from the stern will encourage the
others on."
To achieve the maximum performance, the
rowers are put through various drills to increase
strength and technique. More time, however, is
put into the perfection of form, for this is
where the key to victory lies.
"Crew is much more a finesse sport than many
people realize," said Hilda Emslander, a rower on
the varsity squad. "At this level of competi
tions, it is much more important to possess su
perior form than just brute strength. You have
to be a good athlete to begin with."
Spectators of the sport can also get a feel for
its graceful nature.
"The continuity and rhythm of a finely tuned
boat is beyond comparison. The machine-like
moves of each rower in a boat can be almost ar
tistic," commented Davis.
In order to have an opportunity to compete,
the rowers must raise their own funds, since at
this time, crew remains a club sport and thus
receives little or no funding from the Athletic
Department. And crew can be an expensive
sport, with the cost for a single boat nearing
$10,000.
"We manage to find enough money to
survive," said Courtney. "What we have to do is
to ask for donations from alumni and parents as
well. We have fund raisers also, such as cleaning
up the Stadium in the fall. But it is definitely all
worth it."
Kathryn Mills, who was a coxswain two years
ago, found the fund raising not all that diffi
cult.
"A few years ago, we entered a few thousand
dollars in the red but ended the year a few
thousand in the black," said Mills.
Somehow, the fund raising and the hard work
have paid off for the Cardinal, as it has climbed
into national prominence in 1984 after only nine
years of existence.
"We definitely have a shot at beating the top
teams in the country. In fact, we might even do
so this year. But it can be difficult to knock off
the perennial superpowers, like Washington, who
has won the Pac-10 Championships three years
ii. a row," said Davis.
"We're also looking forward to a trip to Ten
nessee and the East Coast this summer to see
how we stack up against national competition.
And I think we'll do pretty well," he continued.
