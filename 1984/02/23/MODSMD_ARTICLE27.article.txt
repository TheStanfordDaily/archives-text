## Pretenders' new awareness more vital, subtle than before 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Recently, I found myself
dancing in a packed San Fran
cisco video/rock club. Through
out the night, many diverse
dance tunes were spun with ac
companying videos, including
those by David Bowie, Kurds
Blow, James Brown and, of
course, Michael Jackson.
However, the high point of the
evening for the crowd, as a
whole, was not the reception
given to Jackson's acclaimed
"Beat It" video. Instead, that
honor was bestowed upon the
Pretenders' recently released
hit single, "Middle Of the
Road." An ecstatic response

erupted from the crowd and in
the space of a couple of
seconds after the start of that
record, the dance floor was
doubly-packed.
That instant at the dance
club was a triumph of musical
transcendence over life's nine
to-five existence. However,
the fact that the song,
"Middle Of the Road" was
even recorded and eventually
heard by the public was an even
greater triumph. This triumph
involved the victorious struggle
of life and love over death and
decay. For if one would have
posed the question of the
Pretenders' future one year

ago, the answer would have a
been a sorrowful and dismal
one. A year ago, the Pretenders
were on the verge of musical
and mental collapse.
Following three years of ac
claimed fame and the critical
and commercial success of two
albums (and one EP), the
Pretenders found themselves
victims to the rock and roll
heritage to which they
belonged. Decadence and its
rotting decay set upon the
band as both its bassist and
guitarist died from the
cumulative effects of drug and
drink. Therefore, the remain
ing two survivors of the band

were left for the "jealous
dogs" (to quote an earlier
released Pretenders' tune), and
it was doubtful that they
would continue at all. To cope
with this loss and to not suc
cumb to drink and/or drug, as
well, would have taken an al
most impossible amount of
love and determination.
However, one of the two
survivors was the group's
leader, singer and writer.
Chrissie Hynde. Thankfully,
she has persevered from the
collapse of life around her to
reform her band and record a
startling and wonderful album
entitled Learning To Crawl.

This new album is the result of
the death and sadness thrust
upon her (and her faithful
bandmate, drummer Martin
Chambers,) but it also is the
result of the new love and
happiness that has simultane
ously presented itself to her.
For in the midst of the death
of half her band, she has found
someone to sing her "Message
Of Love" to. And that some
one was not just your average
person. It was none other than
her one-time idol, Ray Davies,
the leader of the Kinks. With
him, she achieved new peaceful
paradise, one that was even
more enhanced by her recently
giving birth to a daughter. This
contrast of death with birth,
of love with hate and decay,
has not only make Hynde more
perceptive and insightful, but
it has made her a far greater
musical force than was
originally thought.
Learning To Crawl reflects
this newly acquired awareness
of the contrasts in Hynde's
life. As she astutely sings in
one of the songs, "It's a thin
line between love and hate,"
and as she has lived through
both, she is more vital and in
tense than before. The cut
ting, yet absolutely accurate
wisdom which she displays in
the nine self-written songs on
this album is aimed at all of its
listeners, and it is provoking.
Take for instance such vitriolic
lines as "I hurt you 'cause you
hurt me," "What's important
in this life? Ask the man who
lost his wife" and "When you
own a big chunk of the bloody
Third World, the babies just
come with the scenery," and
then counter them with such
sweet, life-giving verses like
"All the love in the world for
you/Take my hand and we'll
make it through" and "Show
me the meaning of the word
'cause I've heard so much about
it/1 don't want to live without
it/Oh, I want love," and you'll
realize that life and love are al
ways opposed with death and
hate. Yet, it is the continuing
presence of these latter
realities and the ever-present
struggle to overcome them
that Hynde realizes can lead to
the ultimate joys in this world.
Chrissie Hynde, therefore,
lias learned the hard wuv to
cr'stwY. BasTc&fiy, she na? fucn
knocked down, beaten, blinded,
and thrown out, yet she has

returned. By crawling on all
fours through all this mess, she
finally stands tall on this al
bum, as she proclaims, "I'm
standing in the middle of life
with my past behind me."
On a more musical note, the
songs that comprise this album
are astonishing. It ranks with
the Pretenders' self-entitled
debut album in terms of musi-

cal force and power, yet it is
far more advanced and subtle.
Ultimately, this will be the al
bum against which all of their
future albums will be mea
sured. The album itself encom
passes all the influences of the
Pretenders' music.
"Thumbelina" is a chugging
Buddy Holly-cum-Creedence
Clearwater country rave-up,
"Time The Avenger" is a ga
rage band work-out, and "Show
Me" and "Back On The Chain
Gang" (which was previously
unavailable on any Pretenders
album) are both lilting, ex
quisite Byrds-derived songs of
faith.
Instrumentally, although the
sound of the band is slightly
modified, it is just as dynamic.
With Martin Chamber's ever
powerful drumming and new
comer Robbie Mcintosh's
guitar picking, the band really
sets a potent groove especially
on such rockers as "My City
Was Gone," '"Watching The
Clothes" (which contain the al
bum's funniest li/ie, "I've been
Kissing ass, trying to keep it
clean") and "Middle Of The
Road."

To end the album though,
the group returns home to
basics on "2000 Miles." Vo
cally, Hynde is never better.
Her quavering, sensual vocals
are hope-inspiring and lovingly
touching as she longs for her
lover at Christmas time.
However, although this song
was meant to be a Christmas
sonc, it becomes a beautiful,

timeless song of love and as
surance for any time of the
year (ranking with John Len
non and Yoko Ono's "Happy
Xmas War Is Over" for sheer
timelessness). It is a truly warm
ending to an endlessly
pleasurable and thought
provoking album, one that
refuses to be complacent in
regard to the issues of life and
death. In that it is unafraid to
enter this dangerous territory,
win or lose, it triumphs over
whelmingly. Chrissie Hynde,
therefore, may emerge cut and
bruised, but ultimately, she
demonstrates that she is the
most insightful and musically
exciting songwriter in rock
music at the present time. It's
funny, though; I've heard some
guys degrade her talents be
cause she is a woman. I guess
that shows you the hell of a
long way we have to go before
we even obtain a glimpse of
what Hynde has realized and
revealed to us. Remember,
"it's a thin line between love
and hate." and it .seems to me.
tnat, sad/y. most people still
have their feet on the wrong
side of that line.
