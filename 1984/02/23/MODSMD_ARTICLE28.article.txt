# Dinosaurs: in it for the kicks

Dinosaurs. According to Webster's
Dictionary dinosaurs are large, extinct
and primitive. For the most part, that
describes a Marin County-based group
that has toured the Bay Area over the
last few years. Brought together by a
series of coincidences and good fortune,
the Dinosaurs are comprised of a rare
mixture of raw talent and experience
that calls back memories of mid-'6os
"jam" concerts that are becoming ex
tinct by modern "professional" stand
ards.
The band's members, culled from
various groups now changed or long
gone, run the full range of the leaders
of the psychedelic movement. Drum
mer Spencer Dryden was a member of
the old Jefferson Airplane. The
guitarists, who form the backbone of
the group, are Barry "Fish" Melton, of
Country Joe and the Fish. Peter Albin
of Big Brother and the Holding Compa-

Ny, a band which backed Janis Joplin
regularly, and John Cipollina, who hails
from Quicksilver Messenger Service.
Last but not least is Robert Hunter,
former songwriter for the Grateful
Dead.
The power and energy of this collec
tion of "old rockers" is amazing. Their
concerts, which last anywhere from two
to four hours and are never rehearsed,
come alive with a sound that only truly
professional musicians can create.
Playing off one another, a feat few
bands can get comfortable enough to
do spontaneously, happens easily and
regularly throughout their shows.
The Dinosaurs began in 1983 with
only Albin, Melton and a drummer who
one evening became sick and was
replaced at the last moment by Dryden.
Cipollina joined in, and after opening
for the Grateful Dead on New Year's
Eve in 1983, Robert Hunter has become
a regular feature, playing harmonica

and singing in his Leo Kottke-style
voice.
The band is into having a good time.
There is no push whatsoever to hack
through a tired play list, and tunes can
range from 30 seconds to 20 minutes
long, each riveting in its power and
precise, if not planned, sound. The
band's selections run from Flatt and
Scruggs oldies like "Worried Man's
Blues" to old Hunter standards like
"New Speedway Boogie."
When the Dinosaurs get down and
dirty, no one walks away clean. Their
jams come slow and fast, high and low,
every minute wrapping you up in the in
tensity that the group is obviously
feeling and throwing out to the audi
ence. These guys are in it for kicks.
Intricate light shows are a staple of
Dinosaur shows, although they don't
use lasers and flashpots. The group has a
computerized show similar to the psyc
hedelic imaging of the '60s, presenting
slide images, oil-fluid projections,
16mm movies and even "Banibi" car
toons.
Since they are all established artists,
the Dinosaurs feel no urge to drive the
crowd into a frenzy to rush to the
nearest record store to buy the latest
album. In fact, no record by the
Dinosaurs has ever been cut and none
probably ever will be. Their sound is a
"live" one, played by people who get
off playing it just as much as we get off
hearing it. Steven Keyser, the band's
manager, expects to put an album to
gether "before the '80s are out." Don't
hold your breath.
But do go "Dinosaur hunting" and
when you find them (Wolfgang's in San
Francisco or the Keystone group are
good bets), sit back and get ready for
the rea-l thtiig: Y<ni ftot arci a 6
chance to see a band like this again.
