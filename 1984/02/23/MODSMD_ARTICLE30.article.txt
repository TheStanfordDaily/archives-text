# Fellini's 'Ship' does not sail
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
II Federico Fellini had
released the first 10 minutes
of And the Ship Soils On as a
short subject, he wouldn't have
omitted anything basic to the
film's conception. At the side
of a docked ship in 1904. a
group of nattily dressed men,
women and children gather for
a ceremony of some kind; a
cameraman and an interviewer,
Orlando (Freddie Jones, the
evil Bytes of The Elephant
Man), film the gathering.
Meanwhile, the real director,
Fellini, and his photographer,
the prodigious • Giuseppe
Rotunno, play their own nifty
tricks, transforming the
picture from a rose-tinted
black and white silent to color
and sound (in several distinct
stages). Suddenly the aris
tocrats, the crowd of on
lookers, the sailors aboard the
ship burst into song: We're
watching an opera. When the
principals remove themselves
to the ship, we learn that they
are actually the members of an
opera troupe — singers, teach
ers, administrators — cruising
to an island where the ashes of
a great coloratura (played by
Janet Suzman in snatches of
footage seen later) will, accor
ding to her last wishes, be scat
tered over the open sea. We
learn as well that the pas
sengers on this luxury liner also
include royalty — the Grand
Duke of a tinv European na
tion, his sister and their en
tourage.
By the time we have seen
Fellini's contrast of the
frenetic ship's kitchen (played
as opera bouffe) and the mea
sured, stately dining room
(court ballet), and have heard
Orlando's banalities about how
the vessel is a microcosm of the
world, we understand every
thing we need to for the dura
tion of the voyage: that the
ship is the world and the
world's a stage (movie set,
opera house). Of course,
anyone who's seen other Fellini
movies of the past 10 years can
guess the theme of this one
just by reading the title. It's
not a grotesque cacophany, like
some of his "late" pictures
have been, and it's not insuf
ferably ponderous (I walked
out on Orchestra Rehearsal, in
which he presented the modern
state as a symphony or
chestra): some of it is fairly
pleasant, most of it is visually
stupendous, and though much
of it is boring, it's boring in a
lulling, inoffensive way. But
you don't learn anything from
it that you didn't already know
— Fellini had no reason to
make it, except as yet another
demonstration of his

craftsmanship (which has never
been in question) and the
profundity of his vision (which
has always been — at least,
since he made La Dolce Vita in
1961).
I usually avoid reviewing Fel
lini's movies because I don't
really care for anything he's
done in the last 23 years — no,
not even H-H2 or Amarcord —
and confessing my impatience
with him always makes me feel
like a blasphemer. But really,
even if you could afford to
construct a make-believe ocean
that looks like a beaded cloak
and assemble an immense inter
national cast to sail on it, why
would you want to direct a
movie like And the Ship Sails
On, which is so self-reflexive
that it finally has no frame of
reference beyond the
soundstage, and so precious
that the actors might be
marionettes jiggling their
strings against a backdrop of
porcelain and china? A film
worked out so self-consciously
can have only one character in
it, finally: the puppet master.
The Great God Fellini. And
though he's spared us the
dwarfs this time, he's supplied
a number of other Felliniesque
bizarros: a soprano who dresses
like a vampire (Barbara Jef
ford); an obese, grown-up
Velasquez idiot child, in the
person of the Grand Duke, and
his blind sister, who look like
they've swapped genders; that
indispensable creature, the
cruel nun; and so on.
Clearly And the Ship Sails On
is restrained for Fellini; for one
thing, the acting is hardly
noticeable, whereas in most of
his films it's shrill, gross,
relentless. And it does contain
a couple of lovely sequences —
one in which two antique music
teachers "play" a table full of
water glasses, and one in which
the singers, standing on a bal
cony high above the stokehole,
compete in concert for the ap
proval of the bare-chested
stokers below. But Fellini ends
up killing both these scenes by
extending them too long and
piling on more flourishes than
the small, appealing conceits
can support. It's ironic that
water glass musicians, not ex
actly a staple of movies, should
crop up in two new pictures in
the same month — one by Fel
lini, and one by Woody Allen
that is in some ways a tribute
to the early, modest Fellini
(the Fellini of Variety Lights
and The White Sheik). It's
doubly ironic, since Allen's
Broadway Danny Rose, though
a very different movie, is also a
failure in which technique
speaks louder than actions.

can support. It's ironic that
water glass musicians, not ex
actly a staple of movies, should
crop up in two new pictures in
the same month — one by Fel
lini, and one by Woody Allen
that is in some ways a tribute
to the early, modest Fellini
(the Fellini of Variety Lights
and The White Sheik). It's
doubly ironic, since Allen's
Broadway Danny Rose, though
a very different movie, is also a
failure in which technique
speaks louder than actions.
II Federico Fellini had
released the first 10 minutes
of And the Ship Soils On as a
short subject, he wouldn't have
omitted anything basic to the
film's conception. At the side
of a docked ship in 1904. a
group of nattily dressed men,
women and children gather for
a ceremony of some kind; a
cameraman and an interviewer,
Orlando (Freddie Jones, the
evil Bytes of The Elephant
Man), film the gathering.
Meanwhile, the real director,
Fellini, and his photographer,
the prodigious • Giuseppe
Rotunno, play their own nifty
tricks, transforming the
picture from a rose-tinted
black and white silent to color
and sound (in several distinct
stages). Suddenly the aris
tocrats, the crowd of on
lookers, the sailors aboard the
ship burst into song: We're
watching an opera. When the
principals remove themselves
to the ship, we learn that they
are actually the members of an
opera troupe — singers, teach
ers, administrators — cruising
to an island where the ashes of
a great coloratura (played by
Janet Suzman in snatches of
footage seen later) will, accor
ding to her last wishes, be scat
tered over the open sea. We
learn as well that the pas
sengers on this luxury liner also
include royalty — the Grand
Duke of a tinv European na
tion, his sister and their en
tourage.
By the time we have seen
Fellini's contrast of the
frenetic ship's kitchen (played
as opera bouffe) and the mea
sured, stately dining room
(court ballet), and have heard
Orlando's banalities about how
the vessel is a microcosm of the
world, we understand every
thing we need to for the dura
tion of the voyage: that the
ship is the world and the
world's a stage (movie set,
opera house). Of course,
anyone who's seen other Fellini
movies of the past 10 years can
guess the theme of this one
just by reading the title. It's
not a grotesque cacophany, like
some of his "late" pictures
have been, and it's not insuf
ferably ponderous (I walked
out on Orchestra Rehearsal, in
which he presented the modern
state as a symphony or
chestra): some of it is fairly
pleasant, most of it is visually
stupendous, and though much
of it is boring, it's boring in a
lulling, inoffensive way. But
you don't learn anything from
it that you didn't already know
— Fellini had no reason to
make it, except as yet another
demonstration of his

craftsmanship (which has never
been in question) and the
profundity of his vision (which
has always been — at least,
since he made La Dolce Vita in
1961).
I usually avoid reviewing Fel
lini's movies because I don't
really care for anything he's
done in the last 23 years — no,
not even H-H2 or Amarcord —
and confessing my impatience
with him always makes me feel
like a blasphemer. But really,
even if you could afford to
construct a make-believe ocean
that looks like a beaded cloak
and assemble an immense inter
national cast to sail on it, why
would you want to direct a
movie like And the Ship Sails
On, which is so self-reflexive
that it finally has no frame of
reference beyond the
soundstage, and so precious
that the actors might be
marionettes jiggling their
strings against a backdrop of
porcelain and china? A film
worked out so self-consciously
can have only one character in
it, finally: the puppet master.
The Great God Fellini. And
though he's spared us the
dwarfs this time, he's supplied
a number of other Felliniesque
bizarros: a soprano who dresses
like a vampire (Barbara Jef
ford); an obese, grown-up
Velasquez idiot child, in the
person of the Grand Duke, and
his blind sister, who look like
they've swapped genders; that
indispensable creature, the
cruel nun; and so on.
Clearly And the Ship Sails On
is restrained for Fellini; for one
thing, the acting is hardly
noticeable, whereas in most of
his films it's shrill, gross,
relentless. And it does contain
a couple of lovely sequences —
one in which two antique music
teachers "play" a table full of
water glasses, and one in which
the singers, standing on a bal
cony high above the stokehole,
compete in concert for the ap
proval of the bare-chested
stokers below. But Fellini ends
up killing both these scenes by
extending them too long and
piling on more flourishes than
the small, appealing conceits
can support. It's ironic that
water glass musicians, not ex
actly a staple of movies, should
crop up in two new pictures in
the same month — one by Fel
lini, and one by Woody Allen
that is in some ways a tribute
to the early, modest Fellini
(the Fellini of Variety Lights
and The White Sheik). It's
doubly ironic, since Allen's
Broadway Danny Rose, though
a very different movie, is also a
failure in which technique
speaks louder than actions.
