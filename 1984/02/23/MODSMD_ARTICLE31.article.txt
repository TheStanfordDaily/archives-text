# 15-hour 'Berlin' tremendous, genuine
## 
### JIM TASSOPULOS 
What distinguishes Rainer Werner Fassbinder's
Berlin Alexanderplatz from the slew of foreign
films which appear in campus film series and in
revival houses is that it took both Sunday and
Monday to show. It runs for nearly 15 hours.
I have racked my brain trying to figure out how
to convince people to spend two days watching a
German film. I feel that Berlin Alexanderplatz is
one of the greatest experiences for a viewer in the
history of film. I feel that it is the greatest film
achievement in recent memory. It may be the
greatest and most genuine film adaptation of a
novel (by Alfred Doblin) ever.
I cannot say that everyone will like this film.
However, anyone who has an interest in film as an
art form should not miss Berlin Alexanderplatz-
The setting of the film is a decaying section of
Berlin in the late 19205. The central character is
Franz. Biberkopf, and we meet him as he is getting
out of prison after serving four years for the mur
der of his girlfriend, who worked as a prostitute
for him.
Biberkopf vows to lead an honest life as he re
enters the world, and his futile attempt to be vir
tuous amidst the corruption, poverty and greed of
a German society on the verge of destruction is at
the center of the film's story and thematic con
cerns. As he slowly walks away from the gates of
the prison, we see the world of buildings and
ground and sky swirling around Franz as he clasps
his head. A few minutes later we share his recollec
tion of the murder. This scene will recur more than
10 times throughout the film, shot from different
angles, with varying voice-over narration. The
world and the past combine to make anything like
a new start impossible.
The first three episodes (the film was originally
made for German television and is divided into 13
episodes and an epilogue, but it is a theatrical film
in every sense) trace Franz's relationship with a
woman he meets at the local tavern, which
becomes a central setting for the action. Fas
sbinder turns the simple saloon, as he does almost
every location, into a stylized landscape of dark
ness and lights. The stylization, however, does not
diminish the realism of the narrative. Except for
episode four and the epilogue, Berlin Alexan
derplatz is a strong, conventional narrative film. It
operates on many levels, but it is at bottom a very
interesting, involving story.
After a series of failed attempts to support
himself in "honest" work and after he is betrayed
by a business partner in the brilliant third episode,
Franz meets up with a gang of thieves and the real
story begins.
Reinhold, one of the thieves, and Franz begin a
bizarre friendship which becomes the driving force
of each character's destiny. In one of the most
humorous episodes, Reinhold passes his girlfriends
to Franz after he tires of them. The situation is
funny for a while, but like everything else in the

film it eventually causes only pain. Franz refuses
to accept one of Reinhold's girls, and Reinhold
turns against him.
In desperate need of money, Franz forgets his
vow and joins the gang in a robbery, which ends in a
horrible moment in which Reinhold attempts to
kill him. The sixth episode ends with the badly hurt
Franz mumbling an unforgettable monologue
about the insignificance of the individual in an in
different world.
The second half of the film finds Franz, who
loses an arm as a result of Reinhold's treachery,
even more helpless than before. However, much of
the second half is dominated by Franz's most
redeeming quality, his love for the beautiful, inno
cent Mieze. Episode seven is highlighted by their
meeting. Episodes eight and nine see their rela-

everything that is life.

tionship nourishing. They are the weakest episodes
of the film. However, there is a wonderful politi
cal scene in episode nine. Near the end, two
workers are discussing their fight to organize while
Franz, riding high from the money Mieze earns as a
prostitute, calls them repeatedly to join him in
play as he travels up and down the teeter-totter.
The next three episodes lead to the terrible
climax of episode 12. Franz and Mieze face a series
of problems which slowly erode their relationship,
and Reinhold re-enters the picture as Franz is yet
again betrayed by his "friend." Episode 12 tops
everything that has come before, with Reinhold
and Mieze playing out one of the most remarkable
scenes in the history of film as they pry into each
others' souls during a meeting in the forest.
Episode 13 serves as a quiet, painful denoue
ment. It is followed by a two-hour episode which
looks as if it was made by a different director.
Franz has gone mad, and Fassbinder abandons the
realistic-expressionistic style of the first 13 hours
in an attempt to portray this madness on the
screen. Many of the scenes are striking; however,
too many ideas implicit in the first 13 hours are

made obvious in a slew of symbolism.
Fassbinder gives the audience his interpretation
of the story, and at its center is the repressed
sexual love of Franz and Reinhold. This is interest
ing and even viable extension of what has come
before. Flowever, as we sit through the 13 hours of
these characters' lives, it is almost as if we begin to
watch life as it is being lived. The breaking of this
reality and the broad, simplistic interpretations
given to it by the epilogue do not do justice to this
complex portrait of the human condition.
This is a very minor criticism, however. At the
end of the epilogue, the film returns to reality and
ends in an appropriately unspectacular way.
The performances are all superb, and many of
them are unforgettable. Gunter Lamprecht is
Franz Biberkopf. and for once the use of a form of
"to be" is appropriate. The performance conveys
virtually every human emotion. In the first hall
hour of the film, one could not imagine sympathiz
ing with this figure. However, Lamprecht achieves
more than sympathy. He creates a living individual
who represents the plight of all men even though
his experiences and actions are far removed from
the lives of most viewers.
Hanna Schygulla, a veteran of many Fassbinder
films, is wonderful as Eva, Franz's only true friend
and protector who has given up the struggle for
true happiness and love in return for a life of com
fort. And Barbara Sukowa, who played the title
role in Fassbinder's Lola, beautifully conveys the
loyalty, simplicity and naivete of Mieze.
Fassbinder, who at one time dreamed of playing
the role of Franz, recites the voice-over narration,
which at times distances the viewer from the indi
vidual lives and events on the screen, increases the
level of emotion and provides appropriate histori
cal, biblical or scientific allusions. Like the rest of
the film, the narration climaxes in the last half of
episode 12 as Reinhold and Mieze meet their fates
in the forest. Fassbinder's soft voice-over — con
veying a quiet, resigned despair for all the world,
describing, among other things, the indifferent
swaying of the trees in the wind — is unforget
table.
Berlin Alexanderplatz is one of the few films
which is about nothing less than the human condi
tion, one of the few films which attempts to en
compass everything that is life. It can be discussed
in the same breath with the great literary works of
the past.
The perspective is naturalistic, and this perspec
tive is not mitigated with any signs of effective
individual action. However. Franz's odyssey, his
struggle for survival and dignity, ends in a type of
affirmation. More important than that, however,
the film, from beginning to end, conveys a tremen
dous compassion for the individual and for all of
humanity. Pity replaces condemnation; under
standing replaces judgement, in not some, but in
all cases of human existence, and that is the ul
timate truth of Berlin Alexanderplatz■

greatest and most genuine film adaptation of a
novel (by Alfred Doblin) ever.
I cannot say that everyone will like this film.
However, anyone who has an interest in film as an
art form should not miss Berlin Alexanderplatz-
The setting of the film is a decaying section of
Berlin in the late 19205. The central character is
Franz. Biberkopf, and we meet him as he is getting
out of prison after serving four years for the mur
der of his girlfriend, who worked as a prostitute
for him.
Biberkopf vows to lead an honest life as he re
enters the world, and his futile attempt to be vir
tuous amidst the corruption, poverty and greed of
a German society on the verge of destruction is at
the center of the film's story and thematic con
cerns. As he slowly walks away from the gates of
the prison, we see the world of buildings and
ground and sky swirling around Franz as he clasps
his head. A few minutes later we share his recollec
tion of the murder. This scene will recur more than
10 times throughout the film, shot from different
angles, with varying voice-over narration. The
world and the past combine to make anything like
a new start impossible.
The first three episodes (the film was originally
made for German television and is divided into 13
episodes and an epilogue, but it is a theatrical film
in every sense) trace Franz's relationship with a
woman he meets at the local tavern, which
becomes a central setting for the action. Fas
sbinder turns the simple saloon, as he does almost
every location, into a stylized landscape of dark
ness and lights. The stylization, however, does not
diminish the realism of the narrative. Except for
episode four and the epilogue, Berlin Alexan
derplatz is a strong, conventional narrative film. It
operates on many levels, but it is at bottom a very
interesting, involving story.
After a series of failed attempts to support
himself in "honest" work and after he is betrayed
by a business partner in the brilliant third episode,
Franz meets up with a gang of thieves and the real
story begins.
Reinhold, one of the thieves, and Franz begin a
bizarre friendship which becomes the driving force
of each character's destiny. In one of the most
humorous episodes, Reinhold passes his girlfriends
to Franz after he tires of them. The situation is
funny for a while, but like everything else in the

film it eventually causes only pain. Franz refuses
to accept one of Reinhold's girls, and Reinhold
turns against him.
In desperate need of money, Franz forgets his
vow and joins the gang in a robbery, which ends in a
horrible moment in which Reinhold attempts to
kill him. The sixth episode ends with the badly hurt
Franz mumbling an unforgettable monologue
about the insignificance of the individual in an in
different world.
The second half of the film finds Franz, who
loses an arm as a result of Reinhold's treachery,
even more helpless than before. However, much of
the second half is dominated by Franz's most
redeeming quality, his love for the beautiful, inno
cent Mieze. Episode seven is highlighted by their
meeting. Episodes eight and nine see their rela-

tionship nourishing. They are the weakest episodes
of the film. However, there is a wonderful politi
cal scene in episode nine. Near the end, two
workers are discussing their fight to organize while
Franz, riding high from the money Mieze earns as a
prostitute, calls them repeatedly to join him in
play as he travels up and down the teeter-totter.
The next three episodes lead to the terrible
climax of episode 12. Franz and Mieze face a series
of problems which slowly erode their relationship,
and Reinhold re-enters the picture as Franz is yet
again betrayed by his "friend." Episode 12 tops
everything that has come before, with Reinhold
and Mieze playing out one of the most remarkable
scenes in the history of film as they pry into each
others' souls during a meeting in the forest.
Episode 13 serves as a quiet, painful denoue
ment. It is followed by a two-hour episode which
looks as if it was made by a different director.
Franz has gone mad, and Fassbinder abandons the
realistic-expressionistic style of the first 13 hours
in an attempt to portray this madness on the
screen. Many of the scenes are striking; however,
too many ideas implicit in the first 13 hours are

made obvious in a slew of symbolism.
Fassbinder gives the audience his interpretation
of the story, and at its center is the repressed
sexual love of Franz and Reinhold. This is interest
ing and even viable extension of what has come
before. Flowever, as we sit through the 13 hours of
these characters' lives, it is almost as if we begin to
watch life as it is being lived. The breaking of this
reality and the broad, simplistic interpretations
given to it by the epilogue do not do justice to this
complex portrait of the human condition.
This is a very minor criticism, however. At the
end of the epilogue, the film returns to reality and
ends in an appropriately unspectacular way.
The performances are all superb, and many of
them are unforgettable. Gunter Lamprecht is
Franz Biberkopf. and for once the use of a form of
"to be" is appropriate. The performance conveys
virtually every human emotion. In the first hall
hour of the film, one could not imagine sympathiz
ing with this figure. However, Lamprecht achieves
more than sympathy. He creates a living individual
who represents the plight of all men even though
his experiences and actions are far removed from
the lives of most viewers.
Hanna Schygulla, a veteran of many Fassbinder
films, is wonderful as Eva, Franz's only true friend
and protector who has given up the struggle for
true happiness and love in return for a life of com
fort. And Barbara Sukowa, who played the title
role in Fassbinder's Lola, beautifully conveys the
loyalty, simplicity and naivete of Mieze.
Fassbinder, who at one time dreamed of playing
the role of Franz, recites the voice-over narration,
which at times distances the viewer from the indi
vidual lives and events on the screen, increases the
level of emotion and provides appropriate histori
cal, biblical or scientific allusions. Like the rest of
the film, the narration climaxes in the last half of
episode 12 as Reinhold and Mieze meet their fates
in the forest. Fassbinder's soft voice-over — con
veying a quiet, resigned despair for all the world,
describing, among other things, the indifferent
swaying of the trees in the wind — is unforget
table.
Berlin Alexanderplatz is one of the few films
which is about nothing less than the human condi
tion, one of the few films which attempts to en
compass everything that is life. It can be discussed
in the same breath with the great literary works of
the past.
The perspective is naturalistic, and this perspec
tive is not mitigated with any signs of effective
individual action. However. Franz's odyssey, his
struggle for survival and dignity, ends in a type of
affirmation. More important than that, however,
the film, from beginning to end, conveys a tremen
dous compassion for the individual and for all of
humanity. Pity replaces condemnation; under
standing replaces judgement, in not some, but in
all cases of human existence, and that is the ul
timate truth of Berlin Alexanderplatz■
What distinguishes Rainer Werner Fassbinder's
Berlin Alexanderplatz from the slew of foreign
films which appear in campus film series and in
revival houses is that it took both Sunday and
Monday to show. It runs for nearly 15 hours.
I have racked my brain trying to figure out how
to convince people to spend two days watching a
German film. I feel that Berlin Alexanderplatz is
one of the greatest experiences for a viewer in the
history of film. I feel that it is the greatest film
achievement in recent memory. It may be the
greatest and most genuine film adaptation of a
novel (by Alfred Doblin) ever.
