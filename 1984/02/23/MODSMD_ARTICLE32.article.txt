# Gay rights advocate knocks discrimination

### HEATHER WRIGHT 
A national gay rights advocate
criticized the Reagan administration
and other sections of the federal
government last night in a speech at
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford.
Leonard Graff, executive director
of the National Gay Rights Ad
vocacy, spoke to nearly 50 people on
the state of current gay rights legis
lation and court decisions and the
prospects for gay rights in the com
ing years.
"If Reagan wins in November our
prospects will worsen. We've already
got conservative judges hut he'll ap
point more at every level. That will
hurt our productive legislation and
court decisions," Graff said.
Graff discussed what he said were
the most blatant discriminations
against homosexuals: immigration

and naturalization, the military,
housing, employment and security
clearances.

Graff said existing immigration
and naturalization legislation
prohibits homosexuals from entering

the United States because of an ex
treme interpretation of constitu
tional law that labels the homosexual
a "psychopathic personality."
Graff also said "the military has an
absolute policy that gays cannot
serve. Only if the person renounces
the activity as a mistake -or as the
result of some mind-altered state am
he remain in the military." he said.
Because of recent court decisions,
gays now receive honorable discharge
from the military. However, as Graff
pointed out, "if the person has cho
sen the military as a career this is still
particularly damaging."
Graff said the military's argument
is the same one that has been used in
the past to prevent blacks from en
tering the service and from becoming
officers. "The military says that gays
can't command respect," he said.
"1800 gay people are removed

from the military every year at a cost
of $20 million annually." he said.
On the issue of housing and em
ployment discrimination against
gays. Graff cited a case that his ad
vocacy group is currently lighting. A
hill introduced in Oklahoma prohibits
even the mention of homosexuality
in the classroom. "The hill is so vague
that even a straight teacher could he
fired for discussing homosexuality,"
Graff said.
Graff also said many states still
have sodomy laws on the books
"These laws are a psychological bar
rier. They are the bedrock of discrim
ination against gays," he said.
Graff said the National Gay
Rights Advocacy, a non-profit or
ganization headquartered in San
Francisco, has been successful in
raising public consciousness.
