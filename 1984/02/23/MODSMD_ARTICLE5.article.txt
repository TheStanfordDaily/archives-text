# Kennedy assails Hoover critics
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy yesterday criticized a petition
circulated by English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz and Political Science Prof.
John Manley which calls for an inde
pendent visiting committee to inves
tigate the relationship between the
Hoover Institution and Stanford.
"Having read the whole petition. I
cannot detect any relationship be
tween their definition of the prob
lem and their proposal for a
solution," Kennedy told Stan
ford University News Service. "We
are proceeding along paths already
outlined to work on the Hoover-
Stanford relationship and we think
those are the right paths."
However, Rebholz said last night
he feels there is "a very clear rela
tionship" between the petition and
the formation of an independent in
quiry committee.
The Manley and Rebholz petition
calls for an independent committee
to examine "restructuring relations
to ensure and protect the Univer
sity's reputation for political
neutrality and independence."
Rebholz said in an interview with
The Daily that the recent agreement

between the University and the
White House to establish a Ronald
Reagan library and museum here has
"intensified the problem."
"When (Hoover Director W.)
Glenn Campbell can interpret an
obscure letter written by
(Presidential Counselor Edwin)
Meese, it's quite clear that Hoover is
politically active," Rebholz said.
'"The behavior of Campbell and
Hoover has been hostile not only to
Stanford, but to President Kennedy
himself."
In the petition, Manley and Reb
holz say they refrained from an out
right call for Campbell's resignation
because the "Hoover problem" is so
great that the removal of one indi
vidual would make little difference.
Campbell said yesterday he would
not comment on the petition.
"I refuse to dignify this latest at
tack on the Stanford University
trustees and the Hoover Institution
with any comment whatsoever," he
told the University News Service.
Rebholz said the Board of Trustees
committee that is investigating the
Hoover-Stanford relationship has
been secretive and ineffectual.
"As members of the Faculty Sen
ate, we've been kept in the dark

again and again," Rebholz said last
night. "The committee has done
nothing . . . nothing they've an
nounced anyway. It's typical that
they proceed in secret," he said.
Rebholz said the Board of Trus
tees committee is "essentially on the
side of Hoover."
"It's time we restore a little con
cern in the community, and the only
appropriate body is an outside
group," he said. "The people in the
trustee committee expressed unani
mous delight in the (Reagan) library
and the museum."
Last spring Rebholz and Manley
circulated a similar petition calling
for an independent inquiry into the
alleged partisanship of the Hoover
Institution, a charge which has been
vigorously denied by Campbell
In June the trustees appointed an
ad hoc committee headed by Board
President William Kimball to con
sider how this study should be con
ducted.
In September, the trustees called
for a continuation of the study by
this same group, "on matters of
governance, appointments, sharing
of scholarly resources and other mat
ters," with the aim of
"strengthening the relationship."
