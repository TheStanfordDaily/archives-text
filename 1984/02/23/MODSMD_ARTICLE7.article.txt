# Rice urges caution in U.S.-Soviet relations
## 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
Saying that now is a "very rocky
time in Soviet leadership." Con
doleezza Rice, assistant professor of
political science, urged during a
speech at Branner Hall last night
that the United States adopt a cau
tious policy in dealing with the So
viet Union.
Rice told a small group that it is
not clear whether Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko, 72. who
recently became the leader of the
U.S.S R.. will be able to maintain ef
fective leadership in the So\iet
Union, who his successor might be or
what this uncertainty means for
U.S.-Soviet relations.
Rice said it is difficult to tell how

strong the coalition that put Cher
nenko in power is at this point. "I
think you're likely to see a halting,
almost frightened, Soviet foreign
policy on the grounds that these
coalitions are hard to keep in place,"
she said.
Rice does not foresee any signifi
cant advances in U.S.-Soviet rela
tions until after the United States'
presidential elections. "Why deal
with a man they can't stand â€”
Ronald Reagan." she said, "'on the
chance that he might he dumped bv
the American people."
Despite antagonism between the
Reagan administation and the Soviet
Union. Rice said that if the "more
pragmatic side of the Reagan admin
istration." represented by people like

Secretary of State George Schultz,
became more powerful, "we'd have a
real good shot at arms control."
Rice said there is a chance that

Chernenko may attempt to follow
former leader Leonid Brezhnev's
detente policy and negotiate an arms
control treaty. "If he really believes
in the process of detente he should
at least keep talks going," she said.
"Chernenko might even decide to
make his mark on history in foreign
policy by doing something very posi
tive for U.S.-Soviet relations," Rice
said, "but 1 think for Chernenko the
costs of launching major foreign
policy changes are much too high at
this point."
The state of arms limitations is
"about as in limbo as anything could
be right now," said Rice. "I continue
to be an optimist because objectively

I think both sides will realize it's
within their interest to restrict the
arms race."
Rice said the Soviets only consider
an agreement "when they think it's
in their interest to do so."
"In the Soviet Union now there is
a dire need to show that they are
willing to defend the gains they've
made," Rice said. "For example,
they've made great in-roads with
Syria's military victory in the Middle
East, and will want to to protect
their voice there."
She cautioned that "this isn't the
time to challenge (the Soviet Union).
This is the time (a country might)
get invaded. No Soviet leader can af

ford to have it said that he lost Eas
tern Europe."
Much of the current uncertainty
about the future of Soviet foreign
relations is due to the fact that
power in the Soviet Union is shifting
from what Rice and others call "the
old guard" to a younger group of men
who have been called "the young
Turks."
Chernenko was part of the "old
guard" in the Soviet leadership, a
group has ruled for 50 years, accor
ding to Rice. Most of the members
of this group are in their 70s and Rice
said that after the deaths of
Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov, "they
didn't have many choices left for a
leader. They're running out of candi
dates.-They know they can't keep
burying Soviet leaders every six
months," she said.
