### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
Saying that now is a "very rocky
time in Soviet leadership." Con
doleezza Rice, assistant professor of
political science, urged during a
speech at Branner Hall last night
that the United States adopt a cau
tious policy in dealing with the So
viet Union.
Rice told a small group that it is
not clear whether Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko, 72. who
recently became the leader of the
U.S.S R.. will be able to maintain ef
fective leadership in the So\iet
Union, who his successor might be or
what this uncertainty means for
U.S.-Soviet relations.
Rice said it is difficult to tell how

strong the coalition that put Cher
nenko in power is at this point. "I
think you're likely to see a halting,
almost frightened, Soviet foreign
policy on the grounds that these
coalitions are hard to keep in place,"
she said.
Rice does not foresee any signifi
cant advances in U.S.-Soviet rela
tions until after the United States'
presidential elections. "Why deal
with a man they can't stand â€”
Ronald Reagan." she said, "'on the
chance that he might he dumped bv
the American people."
Despite antagonism between the
Reagan administation and the Soviet
Union. Rice said that if the "more
pragmatic side of the Reagan admin
istration." represented by people like

Secretary of State George Schultz,
became more powerful, "we'd have a
real good shot at arms control."
Rice said there is a chance that

Chernenko may attempt to follow
former leader Leonid Brezhnev's
detente policy and negotiate an arms
control treaty. "If he really believes
in the process of detente he should
at least keep talks going," she said.
"Chernenko might even decide to
make his mark on history in foreign
policy by doing something very posi
tive for U.S.-Soviet relations," Rice
said, "but 1 think for Chernenko the
costs of launching major foreign
policy changes are much too high at
this point."
The state of arms limitations is
"about as in limbo as anything could
be right now," said Rice. "I continue
to be an optimist because objectively
