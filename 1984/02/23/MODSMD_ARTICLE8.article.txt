Reagan's plan will hike deficits
Washington — The Congressional Budget Office warned
yesterday that President Reagan's fiscal 1985 budget, far
from reducing the federal deficit in the next five years,
would actually allow it to become $60 billion greater in
1989 than it is now.
CBO Director Rudolph Penner. in testimony before
the Senate Appropriations Committee, urged quick action
to put deficits on a declining path, either through regular
legislative action or through bipartisan negotiations be
tween administration officials and congressional leaders.
The second bipartisan negotiating session is scheduled for
today, but congressional Democrats expressed doubt that
the talks would pay off. House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) accused Reagan of "political fraud" for
proposing the negotiations without being willing to accept
substantial tax increases or defense spending cuts.
Also today, the Senate Finance Committee will consider
a package of tax increases and spending cuts unveiled yes
terday by Chairman Robert Dale (R-Kan.).
Dole failed to move a similar package through Congress
late last year, but O'Neill and other congressional leaders
put greater hope in legislative action of that sort than in
the negotiations with the administration.
U.S. may continue bombing
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz said yes
terday that, even after U.S. Marines arc evacuated from
Beirut International Airport. U.S. warships and planes
might bombard targets in Lebanon to protect American
civilians and the U.S. Embassy.
"Our rules of engagement go beyond the Marines at the
airport to other people," Shultz told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee as the ground troops continued their
move to U.S. naval vessels in the Mediterranean.
While the Marines come out, the Pentagon said it has
"temporarily" halted shipments of U.S. armored personnel
carriers to the Lebanese army and placed the future of the
U.S. military training mission in Lebanon "under review"
because of continuing uncertainty there.
Washington Post correspondent David Ottaway reported
from Beirut yesterday that 22 tanks and about 30 armed
personnel carriers supplied by the United States have been
abandoned by the disintegrating Lebanese army and seized
by Phalangist-led militia forces. An unknown number of
others has been captured by Druse militia, Ottaway re
ported.
Soviets reaffirm stance on
future weapons talks with West
Moscow — The Soviet Union punctured Western hopes
yesterday that the new leadership in the Kremlin might
modify Moscow's stand on nuclear missile negotiations, is
suing an authoritative restatement of its conditions for re
turning to the Geneva. Switzerland, talks it abandoned last
November.
In a commentary circulated by the official Tass news
agency, a top Soviet political analyst ridiculed as a
"propaganda ploy" U.S. statements that it is ready to
resume the talks on limiting intermediate-range missiles in
F.umpc.
'Europe's security interests would be promoted not by
the cult of confrontation and strength, emphasized so
stubbornly bv Washington, but by a course of seeking agree
ments and by the real readiness of the U.S.A. and NATO to
return to the situation which existed before the deploy
ment of Pershing and cruise missiles" in Western Europe,
wrote Tass analyst Yuri Kornilov.
More Latin America aid likely
Washington — The Reagan administration appears likely
to win the essential parts of the $8.9 billion aid package it
has requested from Congress to implement the recommen
dations of the Kissinger commission on Central America,
congressmen and aides said yesterday.
In initial skirmishes this week over the massive funding
proposal. Democrats and some Republicans have com
plained that the money is too much, that Congress is being
asked to approve it too quickly, and that there should be a
closer link between military aid to El Salvador and progress
on human rights.
But the administration has argued that El Salvador and
the other countries of the area need more U.S. money im
mediately in order to stave off leftist insurrections. That
fear, along with Congress' desire to finish its business early
so members will be free for political campaigning, is already
producing unusually quick action on the plan, congressmen
say.
"It's going to go pretty fast," said Rep. Sam Gejdenson
(D-Conn.) a leading opponent of the administration's
policies in Central America."And they're going to get most
of the money."
The administration is asking Congress to triple U.S. mili
tary aid to Central America to $373 million this year —
$243 million of it for El Salvador — and to provide at least
$256 million in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. It is also as
king for about $400 million in emergency economic aid this
year.
Senate OKs death penalty
Washington — The Senate, taking its first stand on the
death penalty in a decade, voted 63 to 32 yesterday to al
low capital punishment for treason, espionage, attempts to
kill the president and murders that fall within federal court
jurisdiction.
The actual effects of the bill would be limited, because
most murder cases are handled by state courts. But sup
porters said they hoped that the proposed federal law could
stand as a model for states that have not yet rewritten
their death penalty statutes to conform to guidelines set
by the Supreme Court in 1972.
Opponents said that the Senate bill, one of a series of
anti-crime measures it has passed in recent weeks, was an
election-year effort by Republicans to win conservative
votes. The Reagan administration had asked Congress to
reinstitute the death penalty as part of the comprehensive
crime control package it sent to Capitol Hill last year.
"The purpose of this exercise has been to permit a certain
amount of righteousness here over who is most against
crime," Sen. George Mitchell (D-Me.) said.
Declines outpace advances
New York — The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped 5.13 to 1,134.21 yesterday.
Declines outpaced advances by about 3 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume totaled 90.0S million shares, against
71.89 million in the previous session.
The NYSE's composite index fell .20 to 88.77.
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
was up .12 at 204.33.

"Our rules of engagement go beyond the Marines at the
airport to other people," Shultz told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee as the ground troops continued their
move to U.S. naval vessels in the Mediterranean.
While the Marines come out, the Pentagon said it has
"temporarily" halted shipments of U.S. armored personnel
carriers to the Lebanese army and placed the future of the
U.S. military training mission in Lebanon "under review"
because of continuing uncertainty there.
Washington Post correspondent David Ottaway reported
from Beirut yesterday that 22 tanks and about 30 armed
personnel carriers supplied by the United States have been
abandoned by the disintegrating Lebanese army and seized
by Phalangist-led militia forces. An unknown number of
others has been captured by Druse militia, Ottaway re
ported.
Soviets reaffirm stance on
future weapons talks with West
Moscow — The Soviet Union punctured Western hopes
yesterday that the new leadership in the Kremlin might
modify Moscow's stand on nuclear missile negotiations, is
suing an authoritative restatement of its conditions for re
turning to the Geneva. Switzerland, talks it abandoned last
November.
In a commentary circulated by the official Tass news
agency, a top Soviet political analyst ridiculed as a
"propaganda ploy" U.S. statements that it is ready to
resume the talks on limiting intermediate-range missiles in
F.umpc.
'Europe's security interests would be promoted not by
the cult of confrontation and strength, emphasized so
stubbornly bv Washington, but by a course of seeking agree
ments and by the real readiness of the U.S.A. and NATO to
return to the situation which existed before the deploy
ment of Pershing and cruise missiles" in Western Europe,
wrote Tass analyst Yuri Kornilov.
More Latin America aid likely
Washington — The Reagan administration appears likely
to win the essential parts of the $8.9 billion aid package it
has requested from Congress to implement the recommen
dations of the Kissinger commission on Central America,
congressmen and aides said yesterday.
In initial skirmishes this week over the massive funding
proposal. Democrats and some Republicans have com
plained that the money is too much, that Congress is being
asked to approve it too quickly, and that there should be a
closer link between military aid to El Salvador and progress
on human rights.
But the administration has argued that El Salvador and
the other countries of the area need more U.S. money im
mediately in order to stave off leftist insurrections. That
fear, along with Congress' desire to finish its business early
so members will be free for political campaigning, is already
producing unusually quick action on the plan, congressmen
say.
"It's going to go pretty fast," said Rep. Sam Gejdenson
(D-Conn.) a leading opponent of the administration's
policies in Central America."And they're going to get most
of the money."
The administration is asking Congress to triple U.S. mili
tary aid to Central America to $373 million this year —
$243 million of it for El Salvador — and to provide at least
$256 million in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. It is also as
king for about $400 million in emergency economic aid this
year.
Senate OKs death penalty
Washington — The Senate, taking its first stand on the
death penalty in a decade, voted 63 to 32 yesterday to al
low capital punishment for treason, espionage, attempts to
kill the president and murders that fall within federal court
jurisdiction.
The actual effects of the bill would be limited, because
most murder cases are handled by state courts. But sup
porters said they hoped that the proposed federal law could
stand as a model for states that have not yet rewritten
their death penalty statutes to conform to guidelines set
by the Supreme Court in 1972.
Opponents said that the Senate bill, one of a series of
anti-crime measures it has passed in recent weeks, was an
election-year effort by Republicans to win conservative
votes. The Reagan administration had asked Congress to
reinstitute the death penalty as part of the comprehensive
crime control package it sent to Capitol Hill last year.
"The purpose of this exercise has been to permit a certain
amount of righteousness here over who is most against
crime," Sen. George Mitchell (D-Me.) said.

Reagan's plan will hike deficits
Washington — The Congressional Budget Office warned
yesterday that President Reagan's fiscal 1985 budget, far
from reducing the federal deficit in the next five years,
would actually allow it to become $60 billion greater in
1989 than it is now.
CBO Director Rudolph Penner. in testimony before
the Senate Appropriations Committee, urged quick action
to put deficits on a declining path, either through regular
legislative action or through bipartisan negotiations be
tween administration officials and congressional leaders.
The second bipartisan negotiating session is scheduled for
today, but congressional Democrats expressed doubt that
the talks would pay off. House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) accused Reagan of "political fraud" for
proposing the negotiations without being willing to accept
substantial tax increases or defense spending cuts.
Also today, the Senate Finance Committee will consider
a package of tax increases and spending cuts unveiled yes
terday by Chairman Robert Dale (R-Kan.).
Dole failed to move a similar package through Congress
late last year, but O'Neill and other congressional leaders
put greater hope in legislative action of that sort than in
the negotiations with the administration.
U.S. may continue bombing
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz said yes
terday that, even after U.S. Marines arc evacuated from
Beirut International Airport. U.S. warships and planes
might bombard targets in Lebanon to protect American
civilians and the U.S. Embassy.
"Our rules of engagement go beyond the Marines at the
