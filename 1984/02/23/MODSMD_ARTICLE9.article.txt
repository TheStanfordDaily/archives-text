# Reagan says U.S. not 'bugging out'
## 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — President
Reagan, defending his decision
to withdraw Marines from
Lebanon after vowing not to
"cut and run."yesterday
declared, "We're not bugging
out, we're just going into a
little more defensible posi
tion."
And, although 265 Marines
have been killed in terrorist at*
tacks and Lebanon seems to be
sliding back toward the civil
strife that U.S. intervention
was designed to forestall,
Reagan said that he had "no
regrets" about having ordered
American troops into Lebanon
as part of a multinational
peacekeeping force.
Indeed, he said, he would or
der them back in. if that would
help achieve their original
peace mission.
Reagan, holding his first for
mal press conference in two
months, was grim-faced as he

answered question after ques
tion about the U.S. role in
Lebanon, the cost in American
lives, and the prospects for the
future now that the U.S.-
backed government of Amin
Gemayel has suffered devas
tating setbacks.
And it was clear from his
answers, and from fhe un
usually sharp attacks he un
leashed on Democrats at
several points in the news con
ference. that Reagan sees
Lebanon as a serious point of
political vulnerability and is
prepared to hit his opponents
hard on what he sees as their
own vulnerable areas.
Asked whether the United
States had lost credibility in
Lebanon in view of its failure
to achieve the withdrawal of
all foreign forces from the
country, Reagan answered:
"No, 1 don't think, first of all,
that you can say we have lost as
yet."

But. he quickly added. "I
know that things don't look
bright, as bright as they have
at some times in this last year
and a half since they've been
there."
Reagan opened the press
conference with a sharply par
tisan political statement on
crime, school prayer and the
federal deficit, but was imme
diately bombarded with ques
tons about Lebanon, a subject
that dominated the confer
ence.
Unusually somber during
most of the half-hour, Reagan
smiled broadly when the sub
ject turned to politics and
charges made by some Demo
cratic presidential candidates
that he is not in control ot his
administration and not
working hard enough at being
president.
He said that it is a "fiction"
that he is not in charge or that
he waits and sits back to be

told what to do by advisers.
That "shows a lack ol under
standing ot how our system
works." he said.
On another foreign policy
matter. Reagan expressed cau
tious optimism that the rise to
power ol Soviet leader
Konstantin Chernenko has
heightened prospects that I S.
relations with Moscow will im
prove.
He called Vice President
George Bush's brief meeting
with Chernenko at the funeral
of Soviet leader ui'i
Andropov "very fruitful and
pronounced it "a good sign
that the Soviet Union decided
this week to accept some on
site inspection to monitor
destruction ot chemical
warfare stockpiles.
Reagan also was asked to
assess the economic threat to
Western Europe and Japan if
Iran's war with Iraq leads to an
Iranian blockade of the Strait

of Hormuz. at the mouth of
the oil-rich Persian Gulf.
"There's no way we could al
low that channel to he closed."
he declared firmly.
He noted that a U.S. na\ ;i |
task force is permanently sta
tioned in the Arabian Sea, near
the strait, and that allied naval
forces also are stationed there.
In further comments 0n
Lebanon, the president said he
had spoken to "a great many of
the families" of Marines killed
there. "1 have been amazed at
their attitude, which was one
of complete confidence that it
was a worthwhile mission." he
said.
Some Marines are not aware
that "this is a redeployment
rather than a coming-home
thing" and have been quoted as
expressing regrets that the\
were unable to complete the
mission, the president noted.
But "I don't see their mis
sion as being over yet," he said.
