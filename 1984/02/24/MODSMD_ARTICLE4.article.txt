# ...about penis size

### HARVEY WEINSTEIN, M.D Staff psychiatrist 
If a man's penis is smaller
than a lot of other men's, does
this make him less of a man?
There are three issues con
tained in this question.
First, does size have anyth
ing to do with "manhood" or
virility? Assuming that the
man has gone through puberty
and has developed the normal
secondary sexual characteris
tics (facial, auxilliary and pubic
hair, change in voice, lengthen
ing of penis, etc.). the man has
physiologically reached man
hood.
However, it is the implica
tion that penis size is the
major determinant of man
hood that is the real issue. The
concern reflects societal myths
about "real" men — sex-role
stereotyping that equates
masculinity with power, force,
well-developed musculature
and a large penis. This is a trap
which extends to include
prescribed "masculine" role be
haviors and the prohibition of
"female" role behaviors.
Second, the question about
being a man indicates concerns
about sexual performance.
This question more succinctly
phrased would be, "Do men
with larger penises perform
better?" It is important to
recognize that sexual activity
is much more than a physical
act. Provided that the penis is
capable of achieving and sus
taining erection and ejacula
tion, any size penis can
contribute to a satisfying
sexual relationship for both
partners. The only exceptions
to this may be when there
exists a congenital problem or
a severe endocrine disturbance.
The actual size of the flaccid
penis ranges from slightly more
than than three inches to
about four and a half inches.
For an erect penis, sizes range
from slightly less than five
inches to nine inches. This gives
an idea of the great variation
of size. However, it should be
recognized that the relation

ship between the partners, the
total gestalt, and the commu
nication will be much more sig
nificant in determining the
pleasure that each partner can
derive from sexual activity.
Another commonly asked
question about penis size is if
women enjoy sex more when
their partners have larger
penises.
The vagina is an elastic
space, capable of accomodat
ing most penises. Since it is the
outer third of the vagina which
contains the muscles which
contract during orgasm, penis
size would be quite irrelevant
in determining pleasure.
However, it has been sugges
ted that the quality of the
excitement may vary with two
factors.
First, some women may
become more excited when
they view a larger penis in the
same way some men may
become more excited, or
"turned on," when they see
larger breasts. Therefore, a
fantasized or psychological
response to a larger penis may
contribute to greater excita
tion. Obviously, for others,
small is what's beautiful.
Second, it may be that a
longer penis touching the cer
vix might provide an extra
degree of excitement that a
shorter penis might not. This,
of course, might also be
achieved by varying position.
There are also some indications
that the diameter of the penis
might be a more significant
contributor to sexual excite
ment than is length.
Clearly, and most impor
tantly, it is the relationship
between the two partners
which is far and away the
major component of sexual
pleasure. Where tenderness,
warmth and consideration are
combined with communication
about what feels good, the size
of the penis will be quite irrel
evant in the welter of emo
tions and physical exchanges
which combine to produce a
satisfying sexual relationship.
