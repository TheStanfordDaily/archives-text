... today's technology represents only
a feeble glimpse into the possible?
We do too! So, join us in probing the frontiers of science and technology
with basic and applied research at sophisticated levels.
We are not probing just a few frontiers. Consider these: laser optics; in
frared electro-optical systems and fiber optics; microelectronics, semicon
ductors and semicustom IC/hybrid circuits; advanced control concepts,
artificial intelligence, signal and imaging processing, robotics, CAD/CAM;
gas turbine technology, fluid dynamics, combustion, aeroacoustics; mate
rials science; V/STOL technology, aeromechanics, applied mechanics;
automotive technology; building systems technology; manufacturing tech
nology, NDE, industrial lasers; computer science, digital applications and
operating systems.
During the remainder of this decade United Technologies plans to spend
an average of $1 billion annually on R & D. Few other U.S. corporations
make such substantial investments in their future.
