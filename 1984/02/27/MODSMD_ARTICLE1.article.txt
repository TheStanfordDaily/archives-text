"Public service is an ancient and
honorable tradition," 1 University
President Donald Kennedy said Sat
urday in opening remarks at a confer
ence entitled "You can make a
difference — Entrepreneurs in the
Public Interest."
More than 400 students and com
munity members met at Memorial
Auditorium and the Graduate School
of Business where they listened to
business and political leaders speak on
the topic of public service and partici
pated in workshops dealing with dif
ferent areas in the public sector.
John Gardner, former Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare un
der the Johnson administration and
founder of Common Cause, a
"national citizens' lobby," spoke on

the difficulties and rewards of ser
ving in a governmental post, particu
larly an elective one.
Commenting on the tendency for
the most capable students to "lose
the common touch" following col
lege, graduate school and then the
immediate search for a job, Gardner
said more students should be encour
aged to spend part of their careers in
the public sector.
A panel of speakers following
Gardner included Walter Haas, chair
man and director of Levi Strauss and
owner of the Oakland A's; Dr. Jack
Geiger, founder of a model commu
nity health center; Roger Molander,
former staff member of the Nation
al Security Agency and founder of
Ground Zero, a non-profit organiza
tion set up to educate the public
about nuclear war; and Marlenc

Young, president of the National
Organization for Victim Assistance
(NOVA).
Haas, along with most of the arriv
ing crowd in attendance, was handed
a blue leaflet outlining a protest
against Levi Strauss for firing some
of its workers after a legal dispute.
Haas defended the company's stand
on the issue and then began his talk,
which described steps his company
had taken to encourage its employees
to get involved in their communities.
Levi Strauss developed Communi
ty Involvement Teams, where
employees can organize to solve com
munity problems and receive funds
from the company which can be used
in working toward solutions to those
problems.
The Oakland A's are similarly in
volved in public-sector work. In the
East Bay, outstanding students and
children involved in a summer reading
program receive free game tickets.
Another speaker, Geiger explained
that he became involved with social
medicine while in medical school.
After studying for a short time at a
black medical school in South Africa,
he was appalled by conditions in that
country. On his return, however, he
found hunger, disease and poverty in
America also. He went to practice in
Mississippi and gave prescriptions to
patients that could be exchanged at
local markets for food. At the time
food stamps did not exist.
Today, there are approximately
800 public health centers in America
modeled after Geiger's original con
cept.
Roger Molander, using his forma
tion of Ground Zero as an example,
said that anyone who plans on start
ing on a venture like his "must be
prepared to fail." He said one
shouldn't "think that because your

consciousness is up you're going to be
able to solve problems."
Molander, who has both under
graduate and graduate degrees in en
gineering, advocated the thinking
out of a plan of action before em
barking on it. "You have to structure
your problems analytically," he said.
James Joseph, president and chief
executive officer of the Council on
Foundations and former under
secretary of the Interior under Presi
dent Carter, spoke of what those
working in the public interest should
do once they are in a position to ac
complish something.
"You should seek to disperse
power, not hold it," said Joseph.
"You should challenge the establish
ment both from within and with
out."
In the afternoon, conference par
ticipants attended a number of
workshops dealing with various
aspects of entrepreneurship in the
public sector.
