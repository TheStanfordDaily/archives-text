Go\. George Deukmejian has been getting a
lot of letters and phone calls lately. It seems a
block of self-described Christians are urging the
governor to veto a a bill that would prohibit job
discrimination against homosexuals.
While the crusade has been going on sporadi
cally for years, it intensified recently in response
to some profound legislation.
On Feb. 16 the state Senate voted 22-16 in
lavor of Assembly Bill I, which would make it
illegal for private employers with more than five
employees to discriminate against homosexuals
when hiring. Gay men and women are currently
specifically protected from employment dis
crimination only if they work for the state gov
ernment or in cities with approved
anti-discrimination ordinances, such as San
Francisco and Los Angeles.
1 hat AB 1 cleared the Senate is in part a trib
ute to the efforts of the bill's sponsor, As
semblyman Art Agnos. The San Francisco
Democrat has been pushing for such legislation
for the past eight years.
Agnos' measure first passed the assembly last
June but goes back to that house this week for a
vote on minor amendments. If the amendments

are approved as expected the bill will go to
Deukmejian for final approval.
Chances are AB 1 will end up on Deukmejian's
desk within the next couple of weeks. When the
governor does get AB 1, he'll have 12 days to
sign it, veto it or let the legislation become law
without his signature.
The governor hasn't indicated what he thinks
of the bill.
Meanwhile, he keeps getting those letters and
calls. Most of them are apparently concerned
with evil, according to a Deukmejian aide. They
worry that homosexuality is sinful and ought to
be punished by those who know how to inter
pret the Bible correctly.
"God seems to be the only opponent I have to
this bill," the aide joked to a local reporter.
"There is no opposition from anybody on earth
that reflects the real world. People from busi
ness, education, medicine, most religious and
civil rights groups are all united in support of
the bill ... The issue is competence, not some
individual's perception of religion."
The aide is right. We've heard the fire-and
brimstone admonitions for years, and each ad
monition sounds more stupid than the last. We
urge the governor to approve AB 1.
