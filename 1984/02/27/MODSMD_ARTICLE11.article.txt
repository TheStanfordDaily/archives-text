# Business and academics
## 
### 
rhe construction is continuing on the new
Center tor Integrated Systems, the University's
latest venture in scientific research. The $14.25
million center is financed by 19 of the nation's
computer and electronic giants, including Xerox,
Monsanto, General Electric and Hewlett-
Packard.
Another major investor in the project is the
U.S. Department of Defense. Approximately
90 percent of the $12 million spent yearly on
the project will be funded by the DoD and
other federal agencies. Each of the 19 compan
ies has also agreed to pay $100,000 for research,
education and administration.
While the opportunity for major research
leading to the development of new products on
University grounds would seem ideal, one must
wonder if the University's autonomy and aca
demic balance are quietly slipping away with the
construction of the center.
Such a collaboration between business and the
University could easily lead to the erosion of
academic independence. The relationship will in
fluence what scientists study and, just as impor
tantly, what they do not study. The

arrangement allows each company to place a
representative "visiting scholar" at the center,
a position allowing the company to get to know
Stanford's best graduates. Sponsoring compan
ies would also get "facilitated access" to all dis
coveries made, meaning they would have
influence over the disclosure of new informa
tion.
Another question which must be raised is how
the new source of support for scientific en
deavors will affect the science/liberal arts bal
ance that has been a hallmark of the
University's mission. Emphasis on engineering,
chemistry and biological sciences over the liberal
arts and humanities is being given increasing mo
mentum as the bond between Stanford and in
dustry grows stronger.
We believe it is time for the University to
take a close look at the possible outcome of this
and future collaborations with industry. Just as
it fought to preserve its autonomy from politi
cal ties in the fight over the Reagan library, the
University should not forget to preserve its aca
demic freedom in the wake of industrial ties as
well.
