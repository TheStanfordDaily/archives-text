# A 						new information gap

### 
Since his inauguration as president
on Jan. 20, 1981, Ronald Reagan has
presided over the most widespread
effort to restrict and control infor
mation in the history of the United
States.
Using a variety of means, the
Reagan administration has tried —
and in many cases succeeded — to
impose unprecedented controls on
the flow of information from both
government and non-government
sources to the American public.
Through government secrecy, censor
ship. and selective dissemination of
information, the White House has
attempted increasingly to close off
governmental decisions from public
debate.
The assault on the free flow of in
formation has taken many forms,
but the major area of policy this
column will focus on is government
secrecy.
"Government secrecy" is a broad
term which, as used here, will mean
efforts on the part of the executive
branch to keep information
generated, held or acquired by the
government from the eyes of the
press. Congress and the American
public. The present administration
has attempted to increase govern
ment secrecy through concerted ef
forts to weaken the Freedom of
Information Act (FolA), to, classify
more information and to make sure
that government officials with
access to classified information do
not leak it to terrorists or the press.
During its first year in office, the
Reagan administration proposed
sweeping legislation to "reform" the
Freedom of Information Act, calling
for changes in the classification of
law enforcement and business infor
mation in an effort to restrict access
to government documents. The bill
would have exempted from the FolA
much of the law-enforcement
records of the FBI, Customs, the
Drug Enforcement Agency and the
Internal Revenue Service, effectively
removing a majority of the actions
(legal and otherwise) of these
agencies from public scrutiny.
The attack on FolA was widely
criticized by the press and in
Congress, and in May 1982. the
Republican-con trolled Senate
Judiciary Committee voted unani
mously to reject most of the admin
istration's proposed changes.
This did not stop the efforts of
the executive branch: In April of

1982, the president signed Executive
Order 12356 on Classification, which
modified existing regulation to make
it easier to classify information.
Thus, by weakening the standards on
classification of government infor
mation, the order accomplished the
weakening of the FolA which the
president had een unable to achieve
in Congress.
Executive Order 12356 reverses a
25-year trend in making government
information more accessible to the
public; from Eisenhower on, there
has been bipartisan presidential sup
port for making less information
classified. The order eliminated
several clauses designed to balance
the public interest with the need for
classification, and imposed new stric
ter guidelines on the level and dura
tion of classification. It also allowed
for the first time reclassfication of
previously declassified material, and
classification of information not
generated by the government.
The Reagan plan requires that gov
ernment employees use the highest
level of classifications hen in doubt,
and to decide in favor of classifica
tion in borderline cases. Jimmy
Carter's executive order called for
declassification of all information
after a period of 20 years, but this
wording was eliminated from the
Reagan version, which requires con
tinued classification "as long as re
quired by national security
considerations" — these same
"national security considerations"
dictate that even the White House
menu must be classified.
Seemingly oblivious to congres
sional and public criticism (after a se
ries of hearings, one subcommittee
reported that the White House's ex
planations of why the order was nec
essary were "inadequate,
inconsistent, incomplete and not
credible"), the administration con
tinued its campaign against informa
tion. In March 1983, it released a
draft of the "Presidential Directive
Safeguarding National Security In
formation," which required that all
government employees with access to
classified information submit all
future writings (books, articles,
speeches, fiction, etc.) to their
respective government agencies for
pre-publication review, and that all
government employees must submit
to polygraph examinations if asked
to in the course of investigations.
The directive was an effort to stop

unauthorized leaks of classified in
formation that could he harmful to
national security.
The directive is viewed as the single
Reagan administration information
control proposal with the most po
tential for abuse. The Washington
Post opined that "the sweep of this
directive and the potential for cen
sorship are appalling;" the American
Society of Newspaper Editors
warned that the directive was
"peacetime censorship of a scope un
paralleled in this country since the
adoption of the Bill of Rights in
1791."
Once again, congressional reaction
to the president's proposal was not
favorable; even the Republican
controlled Senate voted to postpone
implementation of the directive for
six months, and the directive itself
was withdrawn pending modification
this past January.
Why is there a need for the
massive campaign of information
control which is currently taking
place under the Reagan administra
tion? It is being undertaken in the
name of "national security," but an
examination of the evidence offered
by the White House itself for its ac
tions shows another motive: limiting
unfavorable publicity. Its efforts to
stop leaks of information under the
guise of protecting the United
States from terrorists and other in
surgents have been directed entirely
against the media; of 71 leaks gath
ered by the Justice Department as
evidence to holster its case, all 71
were to the press and not one to
"enemy agents." Newsweek's David
Martin observes that "when there's a
political objective at stake, the
leaking goes on undeterred."
The attempts of this administra
tion to increase government secrecy
through FolA "reform" and
presidential directives have moved
the United States toward a national
security state more reminiscent of a
totalitarian regime than of a demo
cratic society in which open, in
formed debate guides policy; as Ira
Glasser of the American Civil
Liberties Union states, "The First
Amendment has always come under
attack from those in government
who would rather make and imple
ment their decisions without bearing
the burden of persuading the citizens
they represent."
