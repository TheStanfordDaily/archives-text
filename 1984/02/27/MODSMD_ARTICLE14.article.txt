## India's loss is America's gain 
### 
There is, here in Silicon Valley, a tragedy of gigantic
proportions unfolding for a nation that is many
thousands of miles away. That nation is India.
For over a decade now. India's best and brightest com
puter scientists and engineers have been thronging to
this hotbed of high technology to partake in, what can
only be called, the of America.
I hey are here for two obvious reasons: to escape from
a country that neither respects nor rewards their talent,
and to escape to one that does.

VIEWPOINT

Why do these young, intelligent and ambitious Indian
scientists flee India? The question, for anyone reason
ably acquainted with India, should, more logically, be
posed in the negative: Why shouldn't they (Tee India?
India, for all its potential and pretensions, is asleep.
And these young men (Indian scientists are invariably
male) are a restless lot. Educated in elite schools of tech
nology — in substantial numbers, I might add — and
exposed to the frontiers of modern science, these young
men want action. Their intellectual curiosity has been
aroused; they are aware of the developments taking
place in Silicon Valley, and they simply don't have the
opportunities to develop their talents at home. And, of
course, there is the simple question of money: big dollars
versus small rupees.
But why aren't there enough opportunities at home?
Because India, I must repeat if only for emphasis, is
asleep. Because the Indian state is an overweight, pon
derous monster. Because former Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehur's dream — shared by his daughter, the
current prime minister, Indira Ghandi — of a progres
sive, socialist state has turned out to be a nightmare of
statism and corruption for the country's citizens.
Because tax rates are oppressive; because the
manufacture of a wide range of products is banned or
restricted by intricate systems of licensing and quotas;

because the banking, auto, coal, steel, power and trans
portation industries (among others) are all partially if
not wholly nationalized. Because there is not much in
centive for development, not much of it is taking place.
And until all of a nation's basic development takes
place, there can be little demand for high-tech products.
After all, in the United States, business offices and all

the diverse industries provide most of the demand for
the contemporary information and communication sys

So wo can see why these bright, young Indian scientists
are leaving India to become the foot soldiers of

Indian scientests in the Silicon Valley is a colossal
tragedy for India. Their exodus represents, at one level, a
massive and irreparable depletion of brain power for the
country, and, at another level, a waste of rupees in

from the Silicon Valley's point of view, there can be no
doubt that India's loss is America's gain.
