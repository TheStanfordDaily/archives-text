## Mideast 'experts' should check facts 
### 
In the past few weeks, The Daily
has carried several anti-Israel articles
and letters containing factual inac
curacies.
We read in a letter by Stephen
Mezias (Daily, Feb. 6) about the
"true revelation that before 1948,
when massive shipments of U.S.
arms were sent to the new state of
Israel .. . In fact, the U.S.
imposed an arms embargo on Israel
in 1948, even as that country was
fighting its War of Independence;
the first American arms were not
sold to Israel until 14 years later, in
late 1962. The current level of U.S.
support is only a feature of the last
dozen years.
The irony of Mezias' error lies in
his apparent tendency to view the
Arab-Israeli conflict as strictly an
East-West issue. While no one can
disclaim the importance of Ameri
can and Soviet involvement in the
region today, it is incorrect to view
the conflict's origins or solutions in
solely superpower terms. At least
part of the problem (and its solu
tion) lies in the independent behavior
and choices of the region's states.
Phillip Chritton's viewpoint
(Daily, Feb. 13) incorrectly quoted
Israel's population as "some two
million" (the population of Israel is.
in fact, just over four million, 83
percent of whom are Jewish); he also
misreported a recent talk at Flo Mo,
stating that the speaker implied a
call for Americans to halt imports
of Arab oil and/or be cold in winter
to demonstrate a commitment to
Israel. Such a statement was neither
made nor implied by the speaker.
The speaker Chritton attacked
happens to oppose annexation of
the West Bank (Judea and Samaria)
by Israel, and is in favor of settle
ment freeze and territorial compro
mise: he presented these views in his
talks. We can only marvel at the
amount of bias that Chritton must
harbor, allowing him to completely
misconstrue the essence of an entire
lecture.
Disturbing too, is Chritton's
moralistic tone as he calls for fair-

ness, at the same time arguing that
America should employ "good sense
in choosing sides in the Middle East
according to population sizes of the
respective states. He says "Oil or no
oil, the Arab nations add up to over
100 million people on two con
tinents; Israel is some two million."
Is Chritton appealing to morality
with his arguments, or is he merely
advocating cynical Census
Diplomacy?

"Expert opinions" such as these
are considerably weakened when
they contain convenient factual
errors. In a conflict as complex as
the one in question, basic facts
should be checked before opinions
are ventured.
