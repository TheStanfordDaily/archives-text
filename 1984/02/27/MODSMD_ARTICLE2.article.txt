# Disagreement over reaction time
## Water pipe bursts in Robinson 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
A water main ruptured on the fourth floor of Robin
son House in Sterling Quad early yesterday, and water
flowing through walls and ceilings caused extensive
damage to the building's interior.
The exact time of the break has not been determined.
Deborah Lehman, the Robinson House residential assis
tant who first suspected the leak, said she notified the
University between 1 1:30 a.m. and noon, but it was not
until 1:10 p.m. that the Fire Department and a
University-dispatched plumber from Sunnyvale arrived
on the scene.
The water was finally shut off at 2 p.m. through the
combined efforts of the Fire Department and the plum
ber, Lehman said. The time delay caused additional prob
lems.
"A good deal of the damage could have been avoided
if the reaction time had been decreased," she said.
Other Robinson House residents agreed with Lehman.

But James Horgan, director of Operations and Main
tenance, said his department wasn't notified of the
break until 12:20 p.m. He added that the Palo Alto Fire
Department confirmed that the water was shut off at
12:52 p.m.
"Considering that it was on a weekend, the time fac
tor was spectacular," Horgan said.
Officials at the Fire Department could not be reached
for comment.
The University does not have a maintenance crew on
duty during off-hours or weekends, but must instead call
them at their homes to respond to problems. Horgan
said the Telecommunications Department uses an
Operations and Maintenance book of procedures in or
der to decide who to contact in the event of emergency.
According to the department supervisor on duty, the
response did not take an inordinate amount of time, and
the call was routine, not unusual. The supervisor asked
not to be named.

Maintenance man Juan Trebino works on a broken pipe in the ceiling at Robinson House in Sterling Quad.
The damage caused by the leak may take a week to repair.
The accident was apparently
caused by a faulty connection in a
copper hot-water pipe above the
fourth floor of the house, according
to Ed Scoles, director of Housing and
Management.
Since the break has been attrib
uted to faulty construction, it will
thereby fall under the builder's war
ranty. "We are looking for the con
tractors to make good on the damage
bill, for the house is only a few
months old. Student fees will not be
affected by the repair expenses,"
Scoles said.
The water damaged the walls and
ceilings around the women's
bathrooms on all four floors, the car
peting in the halls outside each bath
room and the spaces between the
floors and ceilings. In the first floor
hallway, standing water reached a
level of two inches before it could be
successfully water-vacuumed, accor
ding to Lehman. In addition, each of
the bathrooms was flooded.
