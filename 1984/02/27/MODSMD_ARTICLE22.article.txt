# Professor's commentary: A.J. Horn
## Risking war to keep the economy functioning? 
### 
A.J. Horn is a professor of petroleum engi
neering in the School of Earth Sciences, us well
us un independent petroleum consultant. Horn
is also a founding member of the National
Peace Academy and was recognized as an en
gineer of distinction in Who's Who in Engi
neering.
As a prominent admiral of the U.S. Navy
said in I 972, ". . . History would indicate
that any major industrial power, faced with
exhaustion of its energy supplies and feeling
itself strong enough to win would, I think,
risk war to keep its economy functioning."
The United States has been in this posi
tion since about 1972 when we ran out of
sufficient domestic oil to supply our
"demand." 1 wonder what this means to your
future? Would this explain some of the
shenanigans that we have been creating — or
more appropriately — that are being forced
on us by the current administration, with
the tacit approval of this Congress, like
those before it? And the recent excesses in
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Lebanon and
Grenada (not to forget Vietnam) all in con
travention of Article 1, Section 8, Clause
11, of the greatest document ever written

by a group of wise and dedicated men, the
Constitution of the United States.
Whither are we going? Or have we lost our
way? Did the admiral score a free throw or
commit a foul? Could our recent escapades
be involved in assuring the United States
with an adequate supply of oil?
Well, once we in America were described as
an "Island of Affluence in a Sea of Want."
Now I see our great country and its people
more properly described as an "Island of
Scarcity in a Sea of Despair." After all, this
country was made great by two elements,
not just the people, as politicians are want
to tell us, but also because we possessed one
of the world's greatest treasure troves of
earth resources. As soon as we stole this
treasure from the Indians (all perfectly legal
under the then existing world laws and
standards), we had the intelligence, drive and
desire to put these resources to work for us.
And of the greatest significance was gold,
coal, iron ore and then OIL. We emigrated
the Scots and Welch to show us how to mine
coal, but WE invented the oil industry.
Of course, we did not invent the use of oil,
but we did invent the methods, operational

techniques, geology and petroleum engineer
ing means by which we were able to enjoy
this great natural resource at low cost.
We were net exporters of oil through
1941. just as the Soviet Union today. For
tunately, the Texas legislature recognized
the value of this great resource and took
steps in the 1930s to promulgate conserva
tion laws for this depletable material. The
Texas leadership was responsible for giving us
the ability to supply our friends in Western
Europe with the necessary oil and products
during the many cut-offs of their supply
caused by Middle East tribal wars. But we
cannot do that now.
As President Ford told us in his Economic
Message to Congress on Feb. 4, 1975: "The
American economy was built on the basis of
low-cost energy . . . this era has now come to
an end ... A reduction in standards of living
and potential output compared to what we
would otherwise enjoy is inevitable ..."
We are becoming as paranoid as the
U.S.S.R. regarding our dependence on the
Middle East for oil — and without the jus
tification of Russian paranoia. After all, in
the past 175 years they have been invaded by

France. Spain, Great Britain, Germany,
Japan and the United States. Meanwhile, we
also have been invaded during the same per
iod — by Great Britain and Pancho Villa of
Mexico. Our paranoia was demonstrated
when all the knowledgeable scholars and self
interest groups stated that the invasion by
the Soviet Union of Afganistan was the
first step in a march to the Persian/Arabian
Gulf designed to cut off our oil supply. The
possible reason for their invasion of Af
ghanistan is rather similar, in my opinion, to
the U.S. invasion of Grenada (what a tri
umph!). Let's remember what President
James Madison said in 1822: "Knowledge will
forever govern ignorance. And a people who
mean to be their own governors must arm
themselves with the power knowledge gives.
A popular government, without popular in
formation or the means of acquiring it. is
but the prologue to a farce or tragedy."
And, finally. President Ford's 1976 fiscal
budget was $349 billion: we have that much
in deficit alone! This is justified for defense
needs ... yet we have a clearly recognized su
periority of war heads over the "Evil
Empire."

Come on. people, if we put the collective
minds of this great country together and
work in concert for the good of the people,
we can resolve the energy situation and then
the admiral would be wrong. There are
numerous possibilities for innovation, such
as conservation, like alternative forms ot en
ergy to replace fossil fuels — although not in
transportation — like a rational approach to
the development of federal lands — both
onshore and offshore — all to obtain earth
resources to benefit development of all the
people— even though you can fool some ot
them all of the time.
And I close with another quotation from
an officer of one of the largest industrial or
ganizations in the United States: "I hope
you share my dismay when observing the low
quality of most of the debate on today's na
tional problems. This debate most often dis
plays the antithesis of the ideals of
education. It is simplistic instead of schol
arly; it panders to distruct, cynicism, fear,
demagoguery and selfishness instead of a dis
ciplined searching for truth and for
reasonable and reasoned accommodation in
the public interest?
