## Huskies take over first place Dogs have their day in Seattle 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
J Seattle — The last time Stan
ford played Washington in bas
ketball, tour players on the
decidedly taller Husky team
fouled out and a fifth finished
the contest with four fouls.
Stanford won that game, 78-
74, ending a six-game Pacific
j 10 Conference losing skid and
M beginning a seven-game win
ning streak.
IBut when the teams met
Saturday night for the second
time this season, things were a
bit different. No Huskies
fouled out. No Stanford vic-
Washington's frontline —
which when standing next to
the smaller Stanford players
resembled the snowcapped
Cascade and Olympic moun
tains towering over the Seattle

t basin — scored 43 of the
teams' 68 points to vault the
Huskies past Stanford, 68-63,
and into sole possession of first
place in the Pac-1 0.
Washington, which com
pleted an undefeated season at
home before a near capacity
crowd of 8587 in Hec Ed
mundson Pavilion, improved to
20-5 overall and 13-2 in the
Pac-10. The Huskies broke a
I first-place deadlock with
I Oregon State after the
Beavers dropped a 69-58 deci
f sion to Arizona, which Stan
'j ford hosts Thursday night in its
* next game.
Stanford, meanwhile,
dropped its second straight
w {sunrtr-trrrel-feH- to 7-8 in the P;TC
-10, remaining in fifth place —
a full game behind fourth
place UCLA (7-6) and one in

front of sixth-place Arizona
(5-8). It also left Stanford at
IS-10 overall, still two vic
tories shy of the 20-win mark
and a probable post-season
tournament bid.
While Washington, a cinch
for a berth in the NCAA
tournament, needs to win two
of its last three games to clinch
at least a tie for the Pac-10
title. Coach Tom Davis and his
Cardinal need to do the same
just to have a shot at a tourna
ment, probably the National
Invitational Tournament
(NIT) in this case.
That means Stanford must
defeat both Arizona schools
Thursday and Saturday night in
Maples Pavilion unless it wants
to enter Oregon's McArthur
Court on March 8 — its final
game of the season — looking
for win No. 20.
"1 would think we would
need at least a sweep at
home," said Card guard Keith
Jones, who led all scorers Satur
day night with 26 points. "I
would like to think we're a
pretty good draw (tor the
NIT). ... So I would be a little
surprised (if we win 20 games
and don't go)."
Both Jones and Davis were
more than a little surprised
with the way Washington
Coach Marv Harshman handled
the Huskies' loss to Stanford
Jan. 26 at Maples Pavilion.
Harshman blamed the loss on
poor officiating and the
Seattle papers evidently
agreed, as a column appeared
Friday with the following
headline: "Pac-10 officials:
Stanford Alumni Assn.?"
Davis reacted to the alleged
referee favoritism after the
game Saturday night. "I think
that's ridiculous," he said. "I
think any knowledgeable fan
wouldn't do that (blame it on
the officials) and realize that
Keith Jones and John Revelli
are two fine players. Jones is
the best guard in the Pac-10
and Revelli is the best inside
player."
Davis wasn't surprised at all,
however, with the way Wash
ington played Saturday night.
"I told Coach (Marv)
Harshman before the game
-win m Uwtf 1 ; lic Tlas a fine
basketball team," he said.
The big center is Christian
Welp, a 7-foot freshman who

had a team-high 20 points (on
10-for-ll shooting from the
floor) and 1 1 rebounds. The 6-
9 forwards are sophomore Paul
Fortier and junior Detlef
Schrempf, who scored 16
points despite playing only 15
minutes due to foul trouble.
On the other hand, Stan
ford's center — John Revelli —
is 6-7 and its forwards — Earl
Koberlein and Steve Brown —
are 6-5 and 6-2, respectively.
"Your margin for error is
much less when you have that
problem (lack of height),"
Davis explained. "We had to
play an error-free game."
Stanford didn't, evidenced
by its 23 turnovers and 47.1
percent shooting from the
floor. Nonetheless, the Card
did do well to lose by only five
points to a fired-up Husky
team, which included three
seniors playing in their final
home game.
Washington started the
game in fine fashion, wasting
virtually no time — 1 5 seconds
— before Fortier hit a jumper
in the free-throw lane. Two
Steve Brown baskets later,
though, and Stanford had its
first lead, 4-2, at the 18:32
mark.
But the Cardinal's first lead
was also its last. Washington
proceeded to run off 10
straight points — the first
four by Schrempf and the final
six by Welp — in less than
three minutes and had the lead
for good at 12-4 with 15:38
left in the half.
While the fans in Hec Ed
mundson were generally
pleased with their teams' 35-
30 halftime lead and were gen
erally ecstatic when the
Oregon State score was an
nounced during the intermis
sion, they were even more
amazed with the first-half per
formance of Stanford's Jones.
In what Jones later called his
best half as a collegian, he
scored 18 points, all in the final
14:02 of the period. In fact,
the 6-1 senior guard tallied 18
of Stanford's final 21 points
of the half, including the last
12 straight.
"I didn't know what was
going on at the time
(statistically)," Jones com
mented. "I was just trying to
make sure we stayed in the
game."

Stanford, however, went
from staying in the game to
falling out of it in the early
minutes of the second half.
The Cardinal, as was the case
Thursday night against Wash
ington State, let the cold wea
ther in the Northwest get to
its shooting and hit just one
field goal — and a total of six
points — in the first 10:23, at
which time the Huskies had
climbed to their biggest lead of
the evening, 50-36.
"We didn't stick some
shots," Jones explained, "and
that has a double effect. We
tighten up a little bit and they
get some momentum, making
it tougher to us to come back. I
think those first few minutes
(of the second half) really
decided the game."
Jones, who had drawn extra
special defensive attention,
and his teammates began to
whittle away at the Husky
lead, but couldn't convert in
key situations. The Card
squandered four chances to cut
the Husky lead to six before a
Hans Wichary tip-in made it
62-56 with 2:17 to play. A
Revelli free throw 21 seconds
later then made it 62-57.
After a controversial charg
ing call on Fortier gave Stan
ford the ball back with 1:28
remaining, Wichary fouled
Schrempf going for a lob pass
from Jones at 1:17. Schrempf
iced the game by netting both
free throws in what amounted
to a four-point turn-around.

with the way Washington
Coach Marv Harshman handled
the Huskies' loss to Stanford
Jan. 26 at Maples Pavilion.
Harshman blamed the loss on
poor officiating and the
Seattle papers evidently
agreed, as a column appeared
Friday with the following
headline: "Pac-10 officials:
Stanford Alumni Assn.?"
Davis reacted to the alleged
referee favoritism after the
game Saturday night. "I think
that's ridiculous," he said. "I
think any knowledgeable fan
wouldn't do that (blame it on
the officials) and realize that
Keith Jones and John Revelli
are two fine players. Jones is
the best guard in the Pac-10
and Revelli is the best inside
player."
Davis wasn't surprised at all,
however, with the way Wash
ington played Saturday night.
"I told Coach (Marv)
Harshman before the game
-win m Uwtf 1 ; lic Tlas a fine
basketball team," he said.
The big center is Christian
Welp, a 7-foot freshman who

had a team-high 20 points (on
10-for-ll shooting from the
floor) and 1 1 rebounds. The 6-
9 forwards are sophomore Paul
Fortier and junior Detlef
Schrempf, who scored 16
points despite playing only 15
minutes due to foul trouble.
On the other hand, Stan
ford's center — John Revelli —
is 6-7 and its forwards — Earl
Koberlein and Steve Brown —
are 6-5 and 6-2, respectively.
"Your margin for error is
much less when you have that
problem (lack of height),"
Davis explained. "We had to
play an error-free game."
Stanford didn't, evidenced
by its 23 turnovers and 47.1
percent shooting from the
floor. Nonetheless, the Card
did do well to lose by only five
points to a fired-up Husky
team, which included three
seniors playing in their final
home game.
Washington started the
game in fine fashion, wasting
virtually no time — 1 5 seconds
— before Fortier hit a jumper
in the free-throw lane. Two
Steve Brown baskets later,
though, and Stanford had its
first lead, 4-2, at the 18:32
mark.
But the Cardinal's first lead
was also its last. Washington
proceeded to run off 10
straight points — the first
four by Schrempf and the final
six by Welp — in less than
three minutes and had the lead
for good at 12-4 with 15:38
left in the half.
While the fans in Hec Ed
mundson were generally
pleased with their teams' 35-
30 halftime lead and were gen
erally ecstatic when the
Oregon State score was an
nounced during the intermis
sion, they were even more
amazed with the first-half per
formance of Stanford's Jones.
In what Jones later called his
best half as a collegian, he
scored 18 points, all in the final
14:02 of the period. In fact,
the 6-1 senior guard tallied 18
of Stanford's final 21 points
of the half, including the last
12 straight.
"I didn't know what was
going on at the time
(statistically)," Jones com
mented. "I was just trying to
make sure we stayed in the
game."

Stanford, however, went
from staying in the game to
falling out of it in the early
minutes of the second half.
The Cardinal, as was the case
Thursday night against Wash
ington State, let the cold wea
ther in the Northwest get to
its shooting and hit just one
field goal — and a total of six
points — in the first 10:23, at
which time the Huskies had
climbed to their biggest lead of
the evening, 50-36.
"We didn't stick some
shots," Jones explained, "and
that has a double effect. We
tighten up a little bit and they
get some momentum, making
it tougher to us to come back. I
think those first few minutes
(of the second half) really
decided the game."
Jones, who had drawn extra
special defensive attention,
and his teammates began to
whittle away at the Husky
lead, but couldn't convert in
key situations. The Card
squandered four chances to cut
the Husky lead to six before a
Hans Wichary tip-in made it
62-56 with 2:17 to play. A
Revelli free throw 21 seconds
later then made it 62-57.
After a controversial charg
ing call on Fortier gave Stan
ford the ball back with 1:28
remaining, Wichary fouled
Schrempf going for a lob pass
from Jones at 1:17. Schrempf
iced the game by netting both
free throws in what amounted
to a four-point turn-around.

Washington's 7-foot center Chris We/p didn't get distracted by cameras on Saturday as he
led the Huskies in scoring with 20 points. We/p was also a force on defense as he held Stan
ford's john Revelli to only one field goal in the first half. He must have played on the correct
side of the backboard this time.
J Seattle — The last time Stan
ford played Washington in bas
ketball, tour players on the
decidedly taller Husky team
fouled out and a fifth finished
the contest with four fouls.
Stanford won that game, 78-
74, ending a six-game Pacific
j 10 Conference losing skid and
M beginning a seven-game win
ning streak.
IBut when the teams met
Saturday night for the second
time this season, things were a
bit different. No Huskies

Washington's frontline —
which when standing next to
the smaller Stanford players
resembled the snowcapped
Cascade and Olympic moun
tains towering over the Seattle

t basin — scored 43 of the
teams' 68 points to vault the
Huskies past Stanford, 68-63,
and into sole possession of first
place in the Pac-1 0.
Washington, which com
pleted an undefeated season at
home before a near capacity
crowd of 8587 in Hec Ed
mundson Pavilion, improved to
20-5 overall and 13-2 in the
Pac-10. The Huskies broke a
I first-place deadlock with
I Oregon State after the
Beavers dropped a 69-58 deci
f sion to Arizona, which Stan
'j ford hosts Thursday night in its
* next game.
Stanford, meanwhile,
dropped its second straight
w {sunrtr-trrrel-feH- to 7-8 in the P;TC
-10, remaining in fifth place —
a full game behind fourth
place UCLA (7-6) and one in

front of sixth-place Arizona
(5-8). It also left Stanford at
IS-10 overall, still two vic
tories shy of the 20-win mark
and a probable post-season
tournament bid.
While Washington, a cinch
for a berth in the NCAA
tournament, needs to win two
of its last three games to clinch
at least a tie for the Pac-10
title. Coach Tom Davis and his
Cardinal need to do the same
just to have a shot at a tourna
ment, probably the National
Invitational Tournament
(NIT) in this case.
That means Stanford must
defeat both Arizona schools
Thursday and Saturday night in
Maples Pavilion unless it wants
to enter Oregon's McArthur
Court on March 8 — its final
game of the season — looking
for win No. 20.
"1 would think we would
need at least a sweep at
home," said Card guard Keith
Jones, who led all scorers Satur
day night with 26 points. "I
would like to think we're a
pretty good draw (tor the
NIT). ... So I would be a little
surprised (if we win 20 games
and don't go)."

amazed with the first-half per
formance of Stanford's Jones.
In what Jones later called his
best half as a collegian, he
scored 18 points, all in the final
14:02 of the period. In fact,
the 6-1 senior guard tallied 18
of Stanford's final 21 points
of the half, including the last
12 straight.
"I didn't know what was
going on at the time
(statistically)," Jones com
mented. "I was just trying to
make sure we stayed in the
game."

Stanford, however, went
from staying in the game to
falling out of it in the early
minutes of the second half.
The Cardinal, as was the case
Thursday night against Wash
ington State, let the cold wea
ther in the Northwest get to
its shooting and hit just one
field goal — and a total of six
points — in the first 10:23, at
which time the Huskies had
climbed to their biggest lead of
the evening, 50-36.
"We didn't stick some
shots," Jones explained, "and
that has a double effect. We
tighten up a little bit and they
get some momentum, making
it tougher to us to come back. I
think those first few minutes
(of the second half) really
decided the game."
Jones, who had drawn extra
special defensive attention,
and his teammates began to
whittle away at the Husky
lead, but couldn't convert in
key situations. The Card
squandered four chances to cut
the Husky lead to six before a
Hans Wichary tip-in made it
62-56 with 2:17 to play. A
Revelli free throw 21 seconds
later then made it 62-57.
After a controversial charg
ing call on Fortier gave Stan
ford the ball back with 1:28
remaining, Wichary fouled
Schrempf going for a lob pass
from Jones at 1:17. Schrempf
iced the game by netting both
free throws in what amounted
to a four-point turn-around.

Washington's 7-foot center Chris We/p didn't get distracted by cameras on Saturday as he
led the Huskies in scoring with 20 points. We/p was also a force on defense as he held Stan
ford's john Revelli to only one field goal in the first half. He must have played on the correct
side of the backboard this time.
