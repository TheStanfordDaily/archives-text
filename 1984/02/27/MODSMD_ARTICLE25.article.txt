# Hawaii no vacation for Cardinal
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The Stanford baseball team entered
paradise this weekend, but may have
ended up lost.
With four games remaining before
the beginning of the Pacific-10 Confer
ence season, the Cardinal traveled to
Hawaii to play the University of Hawaii
in an attempt to prove its No. 6 pre
season ranking wasn't a fluke.
But with one game remaining yester
day, Stanford had done nothing to
improve its consistency by losing two of
the first three games to the Rainbow-
Warriors.
On Friday, the Card opened the se
ries, and the double-header, with a
glimmer of hope as it won the first
game 6-2. The Card was paced by senior
John Radtke who won his fourth game
against no losses.
The Cardinal also showed continuing
signs of breaking out of its early
season hitting woes. The Card scored
twice in the second inning on senior
Greg Lorenzetti's long home run to
left.
The hitting barrage continued in the
next inning as freshman Ruben Amaro

reached base on an error and was tripled
home by senior Darryl Stephens. Sopho
more Mark Davis then singled in Step
hens and stole second.
Junior Rick Lundblade then finished
off the rally with a single to score Davis
with the third run of the inning. The
Cardinal scored once more in the game
but could have used the extra runs in
the next games.
In the nightcap, Hawaii pelted senior
starter Brian Myers and a trio of Car
dinal relievers for a dozen hits and an 8-
4 victory. The loss dropped Myers'
record to 1-3.
But the double-header was just fur
ther proof of the Cardinal's inconsis
tency. Throughout the pre-season,
Stanford has been unable to mount any
type of consistent attack on offense to
back a good pitching attack.
On Saturday, once again, the Car
dinal couldn't back an excellent pitch
ing performance by junior Jeff Ballard.
On face value, Ballard has only
himself to blame for the loss. He
wasted five innings of no-hit relief
when he threw a wild pitch that allowed
the winning run to score in the bottom
of the ninth in the 6-5 loss.

Hawaii's Randy Inaba, who had
walked to lead off the ninth, was
sacrificed to second, went to third on
an infield out and sprinted home when
Ballard's next pitch struck the plate
and bounced to the backstop.
Earlier, Inaba had a two-run double in
the fourth inning to highlight a two
out, five-run Warrior rally that erased
an early 5-0 Stanford lead.
Ballard entered the game to get the
final out of the fourth and didn't allow
a hit for five innings before running
into trouble in the ninth.
But it was once again the failure of
the Cardinal offense to put away the
game or even back Ballard's strong per
formance that eventually cost it the
game.
Stanford opened strong by scoring
three times in the second inning by
combining three hits, two walks and a
stolen base. The Card was keyed by
junior Pete Stanicek's two-run triple in
the inning.
The loss gave the Cardinal an 11-10
record with only the game on Sunday
remaining. The Card begins the Pac-10
season against the University of
Arizona in Tucson Friday.


The University of Hawaii picked off two wins in its first
three games against Stanford over the weekend. If the

Searcey/DaiiyfTe
Cardinal doesn't open its eyes and get off the ground soon,
the Pacific-10 Championship could be very hard to grab.
