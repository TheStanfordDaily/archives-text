# Giants get Oliver from Expos

### 
Scottsdale, Ariz. (AP) â€” A 1
Oliver, the National League
batting champion two years
ago for the Montreal Expos
and one of baseball's top hit
ters during his 15-year major
league career, was traded yes
terday to the San Francisco
Giants for pitcher Fred Brein
ing and another player, it was
reported.
The Giants have called a
news conference at their train
ing headquarters this morning
to announce the deal, which
was made after another deal
fell through that would have
brought Bill Buckner from the
Chicago Cubs, according to the
Oakland Tribune and the San
Francisco Chronicle.
Oliver, 37, a left-handed
hitting first baseman with a
lifetime batting average of
.305, won the 1982 batting
title when he led the league
with 43 doubles and hit a
career-high 22 homers for the
Expos.
John McHale, the Expos'
general manager, confirmed
the trade for Oliver.
Giants General Manager
Tom Haller and Manager Frank
Robinson had approved the
deal with the Chicago Cubs

that would have sent Chili
Davis and pitcher Bill Laskey
for Buckner and outfield
prospect Carter, but Giants
owner Bob Lurie didn't want
to part with Davis, the Tribune
said.
The Giants then turned to
the Expos to fill their need for
a first baseman to replace Dar
rell Evans, and will keep Davis
and Laskey. The second player
the Giants will give up was not
named.
"Tom and Frank were in
complete agreement on the
Buckner deal," a Giants source
told the Tribune. "Bob Lurie
just didn't want to part with
Chili. He was fearful Chili
might come back to haunt the
club."
Oliver is three years older
than Buckner and is not re
garded as accomplished a
fielder, but Oliver may be more
of a home-run threat.
Oliver, who has 214 career
home runs, hit .300 last year
with 38 doubles, eight homers
and 84 runs batted in. His field
average was .990 with 13 er
rors.
"He automatically makes us
a better ballclub," Robinson
said of Oliver, who reportedly

has two years left on a con
tract that pays him some
$800,000 annually. "Oliver and
Buckner are similar hitters.
They both hit the gaps, but
whereas Buckner will get you
10 homers, Oliver has the abil
ity to hit 15. Either way, we
would have gotten a left
handed hitter and a first
baseman."
Robinson was more willing to
part with Laskey than Brein
ing, according to the Tribune.
Breining is more versatile, using
one of the best forkballs in the
game effectively as a starter or
reliever. The right-hander was
pressed into starting duty last
season and finished 11-12 with
a 3.82 earned run average in
203 innings.
Laskey was 13-10 with a 4.05
ERA, but didn't pitch after
Aug. 22.
Davis, who had a fine rookie
season two years ago before
slumping last year, may still be
the odd-man out in the Giants'
lineup if Robinson gets his way.
Robinson said the Giants are
again trying to get Dusty
Baker, the free agent who
snubbed them after they
claimed him on waivers from
the Los Angeles Dodgers.
