# Gymnasts slip to third

### CAROLYN TARKINGTON 
The men's gymnastics team had an unfortun
ate last-place finish Friday night against UC-
Berkeley and UCLA. The Bruins, currently
ranked as the No. 1 team in the nation, had an
easy and predictable victory. However, the Bears
caused quite an unexpected upset with their
si cond-place finish.
We were all very surprised that they beat
us." Head Coach Sadeo Hamada said. "We have
already beat them several times this year."
The absence of sophomore Gary Smith was
most certainly a major factor involved with the
final team standings. Smith, who is especially
strong for Stanford on vault, rings and pommel
horse, sustained an injury to his ankle during the
meet warmups. As a result Smith had to scratch
all but one event, and last-minute changes were
made in the team lineup. "His absence obviously
hurt our team score," Hamada said.
Despite the loss of Smith however, the Car
dinal was still surprised with the Bears' victory.
••I thought they had a homecourt advantage,"
gymnast Jon Levy said. "After the meet some
people from Berkeley even said that we looked

better."
The final results were very close with Stan
ford at a 267.15 to California's 267.50. UCLA
was in a class of its own — finishing with an out
standing 278.95 total. The Bruins have a very
strong and experienced team which is composed
of several probable 1984 Olympic team mem
bers.
Despite the international caliber of many of
the competitors, Stanford's Levy finished
second place all-around with a 55.40 and proved
himself to be one of the top gymnasts in the
meet. Levy also placed second on rings with a
9.45, first on floor with a 9.45 and first on high
bar in a tie with UCLA's Chris Caso with an im
pressive 9.75.
Also doing exceptionally well for Stanford
was freshman Randy Besosa. Besosa placed sixth
all-around with a 53.60 and tied for a second
place on parallel bars with a 9.30. Besosa has
shown steady improvement this season.
The next competition will be a coed event
Friday at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion. The men
will be competing against UC-Davis and the wo
men will be competing against UC-Berkeley.
