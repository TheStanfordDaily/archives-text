# Swimmers tune up for NCAA
## Women take WCAA easily 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The Stanford women's swim
team coasted to an easy first
place title in the WCAA cham
pionships in Los Angeles this
weekend.
The Cardinal outpaced
second-place USC, 635 to 511,
but did not dominate the meet

according to Coach George
Haines. "We just moved ahead
a little bit each day,"he said.
The Cardinal was led by
freshman Susan Rapp who won
three races; both breaststroke
events and the 200 fly. Rapp's
victories in the 200 fly
(1:59.00) and 200 breaststroke
(2:17.10) both set conference

records and were national bests
for the year.
Krissie Bush and Patty
Gavin won the 50 freestyle and
200 backstroke, respectively.
The Cardinal also picked up vic
tories in the 200 freestyle
relay, 200 medley relay and 400
medley relay. The 200 freestyle

time (1:34.00) was another na
tional best for the year.
In addition, Stanford divers
won the one and three meter
events. The Cardinal may have
won by a larger margin, but it
may have had other things on
its mind.
"We didn't take it (the
WCAA meet) lightly, but
we're really getting ready for
the NCAAs," Haines said. The
NCAA Championships are a
little more than two weeks
away and the Cardinal is the
favorite to defend its title.
"1 fell good about our situa
tion. We're in about the same
shape as last year," Haines indi
cated. "Physically we're in good
condition."
The Cardinal also has a few
spots left to qualify for its
NCAA team, and although a
few women made qualifying
times, Haines said, "1 think
some of the girls had a hard
time getting up for the meet."
The women will get a final
chance to make qualifying
times this weekend as the Card
inal hosts the Santa Clara
Swim Club and San Jose
Aquatics in a non-conference
meet.
