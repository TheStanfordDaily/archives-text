Climbing the ladder
Stanford sophomore Eric Rosenfeld got all the way to the top rung of the 38th annual
Norcal Tournament, but he was still there as of today. He and fellow Cardinal Dan
Goldie will play the championship singles match at a later date. Goldie had a bad back
which prevented him from finishing tne match. Stanford easily won the overall team
championship.
