# Fagen offers new Latin American plan
## 
### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The summer of 1982 was a turbulent period
for Central America and the Reagan adminis
tration's policy in the region.
The United States was increasing its mili
tary aid to El Salvador's government and
expanding its military presence in Honduras.
The Nicaraguan contras, backed by the CIA,
were intensifying their attacks into
Nicaragua.
The Reagan administration was receiving
heavy criticism of its policies from Congress
and such leading Latin American nations as
Mexico.
This series of events worried Political Sci
ence Prof. Richard Fagen and six other
scholars of Latin America.
"We understood quite well that this admin

istration was leading the United States down
a road of disaster," Fagen said. "We decided
we had to have some kind of an organization
that would serve to put scholarship to use in
countering the kinds of policy and explana
tions of policy coming from the Reagan ad
ministration."
In August 1982 at Stanford, the group
formed Policy Alternatives for the Caribbean
and Central America (PACCA).
Six months before President Reagan ap
pointed the Kissinger Commission, PACCA
started work on a policy proposal for the
United States in Central America.
Last week, PACCA released the final draft
of its proposal, titled "Blueprint for Peace in
Central America and the Caribbean."
The report calls on the United States to
support negotiations between all sides in the

region's conflicts.
The United States also should set up a pro
gram of economic development that would
improve the lot of average Central Americans
and residents of the Caribbean islands, the
report says.
'"We begin with the premise that most
American citizens do not want war, nor do
they wish to be backers, covert or overt, of
repressive regimes, death squads or clan
destine armies," the report's preface says.
"But we also recognize that American in
volvement in the region is long-standing and
that no easy solutions are possible."
The report has been sent to groups opposed
to the Reagan administration's policies.
Fagen said the report will enable these
groups to lobby for a plan rather than just
criticize current policy.
The report proposes courses of ac
tion for the United States in two
areas: the demilitarization of
Central America and diplomatic rela
tions with Nicaragua. HI Salvador,
Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica
and Cuba.
The following passages are ex
tracted from an executive summary
of the report:
Regional demilitarization
"The United States should take
immediate initiatives to halt the
regionalization of the conflict in
Central America. The United States
should withdraw its troops from
Honduras and its ships from the
coast of Nicaragua. The United
States should place its full support
behind the Contadora process,
seeking to end all outside military in
volvement in the region."
The Contadora nations — Mexico.
Colombia, Panama and Venezuela —

have called for regional negotiations
to settle the conflicts.
Nicaragua
"The United States should ter
minate all support for counter
revolutionary forces based in
Honduras and Costa Rica. The at
tempt to isolate Nicaragua politi
cally and economically should he
ended. The covert support of terror
ists is unworthy of the United States
and violates both U.S. laws and inter
ests. The United States should work
with the governments of Nicaragua,
Honduras and Costa Rica to develop
a humane resettlement plan for
those recruited to fight the covert
war.
El Salvador
"The United States should place
its weight behind a negotiated solu
tion in El Salvador, one which will
limit the violence and destruction
suffered by the people of that
country.
"No negotiated solution is possible
without permitting all the contend
ing parties (the government and the
rebel coalition) to participate in the

political process on equitable terms.
The goal must be fair and democratic
elections, but these cannot take
place in the midst of war.
" Progress toward this objective re
quires that the United States dis
tance itself from the current regime.
Military aid should be halted. Eco
nomic aid should be conditioned on
movement toward a negotiated
settlement."
Honduras
"The current military buildup in
Honduras should be reversed. The
United States should support demo
cratic institutions and citizens' or
ganizations in Honduras, in the hope
that democracy can be encouraged. A
large and powerful military in Hon
duras will preclude that possibility
and undermine positive social or eco
nomic reform."
Ciuatemala
"The United States should main
tain a firm arms embargo on a regime
that is a consistent and gross violator
of human rights. It should raise its
voice against the Guatemalan gov

ernment's continuing war on the In
dian population of that country."
Costa Rica
"The Costa Ricans should he
encouraged in their policy of
neutrality in Central America. They
should be granted U.S. economic as
sistance to alleviate their external
debt and to help restructure their
economy."
Cuba
"It is time to begin a process to
achieve normal diplomatic and com
mercial relations. Steps must be
taken to reassert the natural influ
ence of the United States on this
country, located 90 miles off our
coast."
The report has been endorsed by
Democractic presidential candidates
Jesse Jackson and George McGovern
and former U.S. Ambassador to El
Salvador Robert White.
"What is unusual about the
Central American situation is the
consensus that the Reagan adminis
tration is not going down the right
road," Fagen said.
