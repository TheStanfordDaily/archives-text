# Fagen offers new Latin American plan

### TAREK HAMADA Staff writer 
The summer of 1982 was a turbulent period
for Central America and the Reagan adminis
tration's policy in the region.
The United States was increasing its mili
tary aid to El Salvador's government and
expanding its military presence in Honduras.
The Nicaraguan contras, backed by the CIA,
were intensifying their attacks into
Nicaragua.
The Reagan administration was receiving
heavy criticism of its policies from Congress
and such leading Latin American nations as
Mexico.
This series of events worried Political Sci
ence Prof. Richard Fagen and six other
scholars of Latin America.
"We understood quite well that this admin

istration was leading the United States down
a road of disaster," Fagen said. "We decided
we had to have some kind of an organization
that would serve to put scholarship to use in
countering the kinds of policy and explana
tions of policy coming from the Reagan ad
ministration."
In August 1982 at Stanford, the group
formed Policy Alternatives for the Caribbean
and Central America (PACCA).
Six months before President Reagan ap
pointed the Kissinger Commission, PACCA
started work on a policy proposal for the
United States in Central America.
Last week, PACCA released the final draft
of its proposal, titled "Blueprint for Peace in
Central America and the Caribbean."
The report calls on the United States to
support negotiations between all sides in the

region's conflicts.
The United States also should set up a pro
gram of economic development that would
improve the lot of average Central Americans
and residents of the Caribbean islands, the
report says.
'"We begin with the premise that most
American citizens do not want war, nor do
they wish to be backers, covert or overt, of
repressive regimes, death squads or clan
destine armies," the report's preface says.
"But we also recognize that American in
volvement in the region is long-standing and
that no easy solutions are possible."
The report has been sent to groups opposed
to the Reagan administration's policies.
Fagen said the report will enable these
groups to lobby for a plan rather than just
