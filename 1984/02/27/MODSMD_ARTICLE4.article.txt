## Current campaign may break ground for other blacks 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Staff writer 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson will not win the Democratic
Party nomination because of the way the party system
works, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said
Friday.
Brown and state Sen. Diane Watson joined two Stan
ford professors here Friday night for a discussion of
Jackson's presidential campaign.
Brown told an Annenberg Auditorium audience of
about 100 that he did not believe Jackson would win in
his first try for the Democratic Party nomination. "A
black candidate for the presidency will probably find the
rules depriving them of a legitimate chance to become
the nominee," he said.
The ordinary citizen has very little impact on presiden
tial politics, he said, while "professional, practical
politicians have the benefit and responsibility of select
ing the presidential candidate.
Brown argued that even some significantly black
delegations would not be supportive ot a Jackson can
didacy because ot the way the party political system
works.
Michigan, for instance, will have many black delegates,
but those delegates will be controlled by groups like the
United Auto Workers and the National Education Asso
ciation, Brown said. He added that he could guarantee
they will be instructed tor whom to vote.
Since most of the influence is held by a political elite,
"seldom do you find a candidate like Jimmy Carter
emerging," Brown said.
Since Jackson is coming from outside the system.
Brown contends that the civil rights activist's options
are narrowed to two. Either he must go outside tradi
tional means to win the nomination, or he must abandon
hope of winning the nomination and concentrate on
reforming the party to ease the path tor future candi
dates, Brown said.
Watson (D-Los Angeles), addressed the question
"Should a black run for the presidency?" in her remarks.
She said a black candidacy will force the Democratic-
Party to stop taking blacks for granted, encourage black

voters to register and focus the campaign on domestic is
sues.
In addition, she said, "we know steps have to be taken
before the 'prime spot' is achieved," but now there are
no black U.S. senators and no talk of a black vice presi
dent. Jackson, she said, has laid "the groundwork for the
year 2000" with his success in Syria and his candidacy.
"Why shouldn't we (have a black candidate)?," she
asked. "We have helped build this country," she said.
Blacks have "laid the groundwork, we have paid our dues,
and now it's time for serious consideration."
Condoleeza Rice, assistant professor of political sci
ence, discussed the impact of black political candidates
on U.S. foreign policy. "Foreign policy is an isolated ele
ment of the American political organization, run by a
white, middle-aged, elite," she said.
"Foreign policy is almost the hardest aspect of Ameri
can political life to break into," she said. Thus, when a
black is elected president, "his/her effect is likely to be
indirect. The primary influence will not be on policy
changes," Rice said, "but on the world's perception of
America."
With a black leader. Rice said other nations might pay
us more heed when we mention "human rights," and
"Third World nations may not look at us quite so cross
wise when we warn of an imperial communist threat."
According to Rice, while the responsibility for a sen
sible and responsible foreign policy would probably fall
more heavily on a black president, his election would in
dicate a recognition of our domestic diversity which
could help the country break out of its ethnocentrism.
Asst. Sociology Prof. Henry Walker, in addressing the
issue of race relations, mentioned two possible dangers
of a black candidacy. He said fears have been voiced that
if a black candidate ran for the nomination and lost,
blacks would become politically dejected — possibly
leading to apathy or even riots — and that if a black can
didate ran. the candidacy would "somehow repolarize
this country."
But Walker downplayed these fears. He dismissed the
possibility of violence or apathy as remote, and lent
more credence to the polarization fear.
