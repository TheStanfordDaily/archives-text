Verification difficulties put
hold on weapons negotiations
Washington — President Reagan is unlikely to seek to
negotiate a comprehensive ban on anti-satellite weapons
with the Soviet Union, as required by Congress, because an
interagency study has concluded that it would be impossible
to verity such an accord, according to administration offi
cials.
"We want to negotiate in good faith," a senior adminis
tration official said, but he posed the question, "How do
we do that when it can't be verified?" He said the senior
arms control policy group in the White House is still grap
pling with the problem and a decision was expected soon.
The legislative language forcing the discussions was pro
posed by Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.) and attached to the
fiscal 1984 Defense Department authorization bill.
It calls for the president to "endeavor in good faith to
negotiate a mutual and verifiable ban on anti-satellite
weapons" before the administration can proceed with test
ing a U.S. anti-satellite weapon against a target in space.
Under current Air Force planning, the first development
test of such a weapon against a target in space is planned
for this fall. Funds requested in the proposed fiscal 1985
defense budget would begin procurement of this system.
Nationalists win big in Basque
Bilbao, Spain — The Basque Nationalist Party, which insists
that only increased autonomy can put an end to Basque ter
rorism, won an impressive victory yesterday in elections for
a Basque regional parliament.
I he returns, on the other hand, were mixed for the
Socialist Party of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain.
The Socialists fought their way into second place and
prevented the Basque Nationalists from taking a majority
of the 75 seats in parliament.
But they failed to break the hold of Basque nationalism
on the Basque region. Moreover, despite a campaign brist
ling with violence, the Socialists found that almost 15 per
cent of the voters still marked their ballots for Herri
Batasuna, a radical party widely regarded as a front for the
separatist terrorist organization ETA.
With almost all returns in, the Basque Nationalist Party
had 32 seats and 41 percent of the vote, the Socialists had
19 seats and 23 percent of the vote, Herri Batasuna, which
means "united people" in the Basque language, had 11 seats
and 14.5 percent of the vote, the rightist Popular Coalition
had seven seats and 10 percent of the vote, and Euskadiko
Ezkerra, a leftist Nationalist Party that condemns violence,
had 6 seats and 8 percent of the vote.
Arafat and Hussein open talks
Amman. Jordan — Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein opened a
new round of talks yesterday aimed at fashioning a joint
strategy to challenge the Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
It was the first meeting between the two men since last
April when earlier negotiations collapsed after Arafat
balked at joining Hussein in pursuing President Reagan's
Middle East peace initiative.
Smiling broadly and calling each other "brother," Hus
sein, Arafat and their top aides met across a polished oval
table in the Hashemitc kingdom's royal palace. But despite
the convivial atmosphere, the odds were stacked heavily
against the talks achieving their objective.
Israel and Syria, for different reasons, oppose the
Arafat-Hussein initiative and in the current realities of
Middle East politics, either Jerusalem or Damascus can tor
pedo any peace plan they do not like.
Nevertheless, Arafat and Hussein must make some sort
of dramatic gesture if they hope to get back to the center
of the political stage.
Democratic candidates offer
voters visions of the future
Manchester, N.H. — The three major competitors in to
morrow's first-in-the-nation presidential primary here are
offering New Hampshire Democrats what amounts to a
choice between the symbols and substance of their party's
past and two versions of its future.
By all indications, Walter Mondale, whose candidacy em
bodies both the strengths and weaknesses of the Demo
cratic past, seems to be well in front. In part that is because
his two chief rivals in this state. Ohio Sen. John Glenn and
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, have been having trouble spelling
out their visions of the future in terms that pay off politi
cally.
Tiny as this state is, the returns will have important con
sequences for all eight Democratic White House aspirants.
Mondale is striving to reinforce his front-runner status,
while Hart seems to be gaining on Glenn in a battle for
second place and the opportunity to strengthen their can
didacies in the next contests. The other five are striving for
fourth place, and survival.
A general assessment of public opinion polls and surveys
by the individual campaigns on the weekend before the pri
mary gives Mondale a little more than one-third of the
vote, divides the same percentage between Glenn and Hart,
and leaves the rest scattered among the other five con
tenders — former Florida Gov. Reubin Askew, California
Sen. Alan Cranston, South Carolina Sen. Ernest Hollings,
civil-rights activist Jesse Jackson and 1972 presidential
nominee George McGovern.
Reagan gets support on
N.H. campaign trail
Wolfeboro, N.H. — It made an unusual sight: On a
wooden platform next to the lake. Sen. Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.), Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole
and Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) were stumping for the one
candidate who looks like a sure winner in tomorrow's pri
mary — President Reagan. .
"It must be refreshing to have some Republicans travel
ing around New Hampshire," Sen. Dole said Saturday as he
pointed at the icy lake. "Even the ducks have stopped
quacking."
Republican stars from Washington, including campaign
adviser Lyn Nofziger and Health and Human Services Secre
tary Margaret Heckler, made more than a dozen campaign
stops Friday and Saturday on a bus draped with a banner
that read "On the Road Again-Reagan-Bush '84."
"Walter Mondale has said if Ronald Reagan is re-elected
and names more Supreme Court justices it will be the end
of justice in this country," Secretary Dole said at a stop in
Littleton. "Well, look at who Ronald Reagan has appointed
to the Supreme Court — a woman, Sandra Day O'Connor.
She's pro-law and order, a credit to all women and all
Americans. I think Mondale made a sexist remark and I
think he should apologize to Justice O'Connor for that
comment."
There were also barbs at Mondale's endorsement by
special-interest groups and what Baker called his "doom
and-gloom" statements about Reagan's policies.
