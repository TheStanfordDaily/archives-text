# U.S. to suspend new aid plan for Beirut
##

From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — The Reagan administration, uncer
tain whether the l.ebanese army can stop its slide
into disintegration, has suspended plans to send more
U.S. Army trainers to Beirut and shelved a request
for almost $300 million in new military aid. officials
said yesterday.
As the last U.S. Marines evacuated their positions
at Beirut International Airport after IS months at a
fruitless peacekeeping mission, the officials said the
expanded military aid program, designed to shore up
the Lebanese government after the Marines are gone,
may be abandoned too.
The decisions appeared as new blows not only to the
government of Lebanese President Amin Gemayel,
but also to Secretary of State George Shultz, who
had strongly urged President Reagan to keep the
Marines in longer and to expand the training mission.
When Reagan announced on Feb. 7 that he had
decided to withdraw the Marines, he also said the
United States intended to "vigorously accelerate the
training, equipping and support of the Lebanese
armed forces, on whom the primary responsibility
rests for maintaining stability in Lebanon."
Since then, a White House official said yesterday,
"the situation in Beirut has changed .... Until the
situation clarifies and we're sure the army needs that
kind of training and can absorb it, there's no reason
to put in additional people."
The administration has also decided not to ask
Congress for between $250 million and $300 million
in military aid to Lebanon, a request which was

prepared before much of the Lebanese army split into
its Moslem and Christian components.
When asked yesterday whether he was going
ahead with that supplemental appropriation request.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said. "No. I
don't think so; I think we want to wait and see how
the situation develops."
Last week, the Department of Defense announced
a complete review of U.S. aid to the Lebanese armed
forces, which have $120 million in pending arms re
quests. As the review was launched, the Pentagon also
suspended the shipment of 130 armored personnel
carriers and halted a planned sale of 35 tanks.
The effect appeared to be a further disengagement
of the United States from Lebanon, and a clear signal
from the Reagan administration that its confidence
has been severely shaken in the ability of Gemayel
and the remnants of his army to survive.
"We certainly have a lot of initiatives in Lebanon
that we'd like to follow up," the White House offi
cial said, "but we want to wait and see what the sit
uation is — whether there is a basis for us to go
forward with diplomatic, political and military ef
forts. If not, we may not choose to do so."
He said presidential envoy Donald Rumsfeld may
return to Lebanon, but only "if there is a desire on
the part of the various factions to deal realistically
with some kind of compromise . . . and (if) they need
us to facilitate this kind of arrangement."
Rumsfeld has made no travel plans yet, he said, in
dicating that those conditions are not in place.
The freeze of new U.S. aid and the lost momentum

of Rumsfeld's mission were only the most recent in a
series of reverses for Shultz. who had argued that the
withdrawal of the Marines should be stretched out
over M) days or more to give Gemayel s regime longer
to absorb the shock. Instead, the withdrawal took
, ,
A State Department official said yesterday that
Shultz still hoped that the expanded military aid pro
gram could be revived, particularly a plan to give
Lebanese units special training in antiterrorist tech
niques. But the White House official said the an
titerrorist program was among those which had been
specifically suspended.
Some SO U.S. Army trainers are still in Lebanon,
along with the estimated 150 Marines who remained
to guard the U.S. embassy in Beirut.
"There's no reason to pull out the ones who are
there." one official said. "We just want to wait and
see what the situation is before we send any more.
When Reagan announced his decision to withdraw
the Marines, administration officials hoped that they
could turn over the contingents positions to the
Lebanese army, which the United States had trained
and equipped since 197 N.
But after the Moslem members of Gemayel's
Cabinet resigned. Moslem political leaders issued ap
peals to Moslem soldiers to disobey government or
ders. and entire units complied. Moslem militias took
over West Beirut, the Christian Phalangist militia
reasserted its control of East Beirut and Lebanon
appeared very close to the state of open civil war it
suffered from 1975 until 19N2.
