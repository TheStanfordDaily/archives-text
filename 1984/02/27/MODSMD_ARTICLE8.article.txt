# Marine pullback may hurt U.S. image

### 
From The Washington Post
Beirut, Lebanon — The departure of
the U.S. Marines is likely to be seen
throughout the Middle East as a symbol
of America's impotence and the aban
donment of its commitment to an ally,
a perception that can be expected to
haunt U.S. administrations. Republican
or Democratic, for years to come.
In this region symbolism is often as
important as substance. Thus the
withdrawal of the Marines, after
pledges by President Reagan to keep
them here, is going to have a profound
impact on Arab judgments of the value
of U.S. commitments as well as of U.S.
capabilities.
The withdrawal of the Marines, said
the state-controlled Syrian newspaper
Itshrin Saturday, proves that "the poli
tical and even military defeat of this
great power is not impossible." The
United States, it said, is not "the
master of the game" in the Middle East
as most Arabs have presumed.
The most immediate repercussions of

what the Lebanese magazine Monday
morning called "the Reagan debacle"
are likely to be played out in Jordan,
where King Hussein is starting new
talks with Palestine Liberation Organi
zation (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat re
garding their possible joint
participation in a new U.S.-sponsored
Middle East peace initiative.
Syria is not only dead set against
Arafat's leadership of the PLO but also
against King Hussein's leading a new
Arab move toward peace with Israel un
der Anerican auspices that would ex
clude Damascus as did the Camp David
talks between Egypt and Israel in 1978.
"Syria, as always, wants to be the
bridge in the gate in the Middle East
peace process," remarked a Lebanese
analyst of Syrian politics here.
He, like many observers here, believes
Syria will now turn its effort toward
wrecking the talks in Amman if any
positive results seem to be emerging
from them.
The Jordanian monarch, following

the U.S. retreat, will have to move with
extreme caution in his negotiations
with Arafat and in now unlikely to
trust any proffered American guaran
tee to protect him against Syrian
threats to his government.
In September 1970, the Syrians
invaded Jordan during the fighting be
tween the Jordanian Army and
Palestine guerrillas and again
threatened to do so in November 1980
to disrupt an Arab summit being held in
Amman.
The repercussions of the U.S.
withdrawal are likely to go far beyond
Jordan, however.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
has already put the Reagan administra
tion on notice of the vast political im
pact of this act on all of America's
allies in the Middle East.
"You're going to lose the confidence
of all your friends in the area," he said
in an interview 12 days ago in which he
described the Marines' departure as "a
disaster."

President Reagan seemed aware of
this implication of his decision to pull
the Marines out. He told the Wall
Street Journal earlier this month that
"if we get out, it also means the end of
any ability on our part to bring about
an overall peace in the Middle East, and
I would have to say it means a pretty
disastrous result for us worldwide."
Egypt, under Mubarak, has already
begun showing signs of embarrassment
about its close cooperation, both politi
cal and military, with the United
States. What is widely seen as the
debacle of American policy can only en
courage a reassessment of this policy
and strengthen opposition demanding
that Egypt take a more neutral stand.
One possible outcome of this reas
sessment could be the restoration of
full diplomatic relations with the So
viet Union, whose ambassador was ex
pelled from Cairo in September 1981 at
the same time Egypt withdrew its en
voy from Moscow.
