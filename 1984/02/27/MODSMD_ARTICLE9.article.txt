Lebanon Update
As U.S. Marines began the final
phase of their pullback and Italian
forces completed theirs, Christians
and Moslems resumed sporadic rock
eting and shelling of each other over
the green line separating Beirut and
the surrounding mountains.
A cease-fire between Lebanese
and Syrian leaders announced by
Saudi mediators on Friday lasted less
than a day — with heavy exchanges
of tank and artillery fire breaking
the lull Friday night. Shells fell on
both East and West Beirut and
Phalangist radio said that Baabda,
the site of the presidential palace,
also came under fire.
The cease-fire, announced in
Damascus, covered only the fighting
and did not include any political
points. It was not expected to be ef
fective for very long because of this
limitation.
Syria, the major backer of the
Lebanese groups fighting against the
government of President Amin
Gemayel, is demanding that Lebanon
scrap last year's accord with Israel as
part of the price for an agreement to
solve the Lebanon crisis.
Gemayel is believed to be ready to
abrogate the accord but he has come
under pressure from Christian leaders
to refuse the Syrian demand.
In another development, Israeli
planes bombed targets in the moun
tains east of Beirut Thursday in what
Israeli radio called an attack on Pal
estinian guerrilla activity. It was the
third such attack of the week.
A Lebanese army official backed
up Israel's claim that Bhadun, the
site of the attack, was a main base

for guerrilla activity. At least 3000
Palestinian fighters were in that
area, he said.
Meanwhile, amid the U.S. Marine
pullback there was confusion over
who would take over their position
at Beirut International Airport.
Earlier in the week Gen. Jim Joy,
commander of the core American
force in Beirut, told reporters that
the Marines were planning to turn
their positions over to Lebanese
army troops loyal to Gemayel.
When asked by reporters as to how
loyalist troops would be able to take
over the base, which is virtually sur
rounded by anti-government Moslem
militiamen, Joy said an agreement
had been reached with all parties in
volved.
Saturday, however, Col. Edward
McDonald, an Army spokesman, said
there was "no indication" who would
take the American's positions.
Others were a bit more pessimistic.
"I just hope there is not a big fight
for the airport after we leave," said a
Marine spokesman who asked not to
be identified.
The question on the facilities is
seen not only as a strategic one for
the Lebanese but also as a symbolic
one for the United States. The
Americans went to Beirut to bolster
Gemayel's government and are now
leaving their positions to private
militias and rebel army troops. Shiite
Amal militiamen have already occu
pied sandbag bunkers once belonging
to the Lebanese army less than 50
feet from the Marine's frontline po
sition.

On to New Hampshire
In lowa's Democratic caucuses last
Monday night former Vice President
Walter Mondale stomped to an im
pressive victory, taking 48.9 percent
of the votes. Ohio Sen. John Glenn,
who tried to ease through lowa with
only a minimal organization and a
muddled message through controver
sial television advertisments, was
ranked only fifth among the
Democrats. Glenn blamed the defeat
on the failure of independent
minded Democrats to turn out in
numbers to match Mondale's follow
ing among party loyalists and union
members.
In any case, Glenn's low finish may
affect his argument that he is the
most "electable" of the Democrats.
It also opened a door for second
place finisher Sen. Gary Hart of
Colorado, who ended up with 15 per
cent of the vote, to get some of the
publicity his campaign badly needs.
This week, in New Hampshire's pri
mary, Democratic voters will set the
stage for either a quick victory for
Mondale or a race that stretches into
numerous later contests.
Glenn and Hart advisers admit
that only by beating or finishing a
close second to Mondale tomorrow
can they pump enough air into their
gasping campaigns to make an ade
quate showing in the so-called Super
Tuesday ..primaries and caucuses on
March 13.
The lowa caucuses have changed the
whole feeling of the campaign and
the way that the candidates are
working — some have been given new
life while others are very close to an
nouncing their defeat. TTie eight can

didates met on Thursday at St.
Anselms College in Goffstown, N.H.,
for a debate sponsored by the League
of Women Voters. Unlike previous
debates, this one was marked by calls
for party unity and only cautious ar
guing among Mondale, Glenn and
Hart, who are seen as the major con
tenders this week in New Hampshire.
Mondale is regarded as far ahead
of the others; however, his advisers
and political observers know that a
frontrunner can run into trouble in
New Hampshire. Winning with a
smaller margin of victory than ex
pected could hurt Mondale almost as
much as losing outright.

Nicaraguan elections
Plans for the first Nicaraguan elec
tions since the Sandinistas came to
power in 1979 were announced last
week. On Nov. 4, considerably earlier
than expected, the citizens will vote
for a president and a constituent as
sembly. How open and free the vote
will be remains to be seen.
Daniel Ortega Saavedra, coordina
tor of the junta, said, "We don't
want the democracy that the North
American administration wants to
impose on us." Washington has been

calling for elections but there are
two major obstacles — a law that
prohibits political parties from hold
ing meetings and one that allows the
government to censor the press.
Secretary of State George Shultz
expressed skepticism about the fair
ness of the election process and
called for international monitoring.
Thus far, the only concrete step an
nounced by the Managua government
in preparation for the elections has
been to lower the voting age from IS
to 16. This is expected to help the
Sandinistas who have a large follow
ing with the youth of Nicaragua.
