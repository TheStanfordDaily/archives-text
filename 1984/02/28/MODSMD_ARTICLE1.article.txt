Manchester, N.H.
— Despite his disap
pointing fourth
place finish in the
lowa caucuses last
week, Stanford
graduate and Cali
fornia Sen. Alan

Cranston has remained undaunted
in his quest for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
Cranston continued to main
tain a hectic schedule of speeches
and appearances throughout the
week preceding today's primary
here, despite a recent Boston
radio station poll that estimated

that he would garner a mere 4 per
cent of the vote.
Observers speculate that an
other finish below third could lead
to his early withdrawal from the
race. But campaign aides insist
that Cranston will remain in the
race until California's primary in
June.

As a result of the
lowa caucuses, the
press has realigned
itself, with many

thusiastie campaign appearances
show no evidence ot the senator's
bad fortune in the polls.
Saturday, a typical day of cam
paigning for Cranston, began with a
morning press conference in Boston
and ended with a party at a private
home in Nashua. New Hampshire's
second largest city.
Between those events. Cranston
met the public on a walk through
Nashua and addressed veterans in
Manchester at a meeting, a rally and
a party. By the end of the day.
Cranston had given several speeches
and had greeted hundreds of voters.
Cranston delivered his message of
peace with equal fervor to the veter
ans, many of whom were dressed in
camouflage fatigues, and to the

mostly liberal residents at the Nas
hua party.
"It you vote for me on Tuesda\.
that will be a vote for peace."
Cranston told audiences at the
various events.
I he senator's ardent belief in his
main campaign issue — the necessity
ot curbing nuclear proliferation —
continues to win over some residents.
Mary Lund, a Nashua resident, said
she had been convinced by Cranston's
speech at the Nashua part\. "The
last two years I've seen nuclear war
become more possible." she said. "I
have three children, and I'm scared. I
believe Cranston is the only one who
can do something about it."
Critics of Cranston have charged
that his emphasis on peace has made
him a one-issue candidate. But New
Hampshire State Sen. Richard Boyer.
who endorsed Cranston two week
ago. said "there is a difference be
tween being a one-issue candidate
and having a priority."

During his 40-minute address at
the veterans' rally. Cranston stressed
his record on veterans' affairs.
"More than any candidate who has
run for president. I've made clear my
support for veterans." Cranston said.
"All the Reagan administration has
to point to is hollow rhetoric."
To this, the audience reacted with
cheers that appeared to he or

workers who stood at the hack ol the
rally holding large, green Cranston
signs. However, when Cranston men
tioned his support for a hill that
would compensate Vietnam veterans
for health problems caused hy the
defoliant Agent Orange, he received
spontaneous applause.
Several enthusiastic veterans even
presented Cranston with medals they
had won for combat and service in
Vietnam.
"I felt the medals could not have
gone to a better man." said Randall

Lepore. who gave Cranston his ser
vice medals.
After the rally. Cranston appeared
at a veterans' party where he spoke
again. Some observers have noted
that Cranston's discouragement
about his disappointing finish in lowa
could be detected in his public ap
pearances. But at the party.
Cranston did not show fatigue or dis
appointment as he cheerfully greeted
residents and delivered a short
speech.
Then the motorcade travelled 45
minutes to the day's final event in
Nashua. On the way to the party,
campaign aides slept. Scott Williams,
a campaign aid. said the 69-year-old
Cranston is in better shape than
many of the staff.
In fact, campaign aides scheduled a
public sprint to kick off the next
day's campaigning schedule. The run
demonstrated the good condition of
the candidate, but the health of his
candidacv will be determined today.
