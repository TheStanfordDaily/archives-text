# Administration may call new arms talks

From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — President
Reagan has agreed in principle
to a new proposal at the talks
on conventional forces in
Europe that would finesse the
major disagreement between
the two sides on the size of
Soviet-bloc forces across the
Iron Curtain, U.S. officials said
yesterday.
Under the proposal, the
United States would turn a
blind eye to the issue of
precisely how many troops that
Warsaw Pact nations have in
Europe if Moscow would allow
a greater degree of on-site in
spection to police any agree
ment reducing conventional
forces, the officials said.
A major aim of the new of
fer, whose details are now
being discussed with key
NATO allies, will be "to try to
shake things loose" at the

Mutual and Balanced Force
Reduction Talks that resume
March 16 in Vienna, according
to a well-placed U.S. official.
In the process, it is hoped the
offer will provide an impetus
for the Soviets also to return
to the suspended nuclear arms
control talks.
"This will be a signal to the
Soviets that we're serious
about arms control," the U.S.
official said. "The Soviets
should know that the president
is prepared to be quite dramat
ic in his offer if they are quite
forthcoming — much more
than they've been — on
verification."
The new proposal would seek
to eventually reduce forces on
both sides of the Iron Curtain
to equal levels through four
stages. It also was expected:
• To repeat a previous U.S. of
fer to withdraw 13,000 Ameri

can servicemen if the Soviets
withdraw 30.000 men.
• To acknowledge and build on
last year's Soviet offer to set
up entry-exit posts at key
points that would monitor

troop movements into and out
of the critical Central
European theatre.
The Soviets have already of
fered to withdraw 20.000 So
viet troops in exchange for the

13.000 Americans. But Ameri
can and West German aut
horities want the larger,
30,000-man Soviet withdrawal
to compensate for the greater
distance, time and difficulty
