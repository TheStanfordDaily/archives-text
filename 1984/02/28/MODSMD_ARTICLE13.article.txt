## Residence libraries Bringing the learning experience closer to home 
### TINA-MARIE BASKIN Staff writer 
The due date is upon you. Sure, you
know that the best place to study is the li
brary and you know you should be there
right now. But it's raining and cold and
such a long way to walk and the furniture
is really uncomfortable and there must be
a better place to study.
Well, there is. The Residence Library Sys
tem at Stanford is the answer to all of
your library needs.
Conceived by the Residential Education
office as a means of "bringing education
into the dormitories and doing away with
the division between the living area and
the studying and learning area," the
residence libraries provide an attractive,
convenient place for students to read,
study or browse whenever they feel like it
and without leaving their residences, ac
cording to a Res Ed bulletin.
"The entire system is very unique," says
Mary Norton, who served as supervisor of
the libraries for 20 years. "It's a real mel
ding of three areas â€” the students, the
Stanford Library System and Residential
Education. Residential Education supplies
the dorm with the initial allotment, then

students arc chosen to run these libraries
and wc supervise this," Norton said.
Budgets for the libraries range from
$200 in the American Studies and Italian
Houses to $3000 at Breer, a fraternity
house library. While start-up funds were
originally supplied by Res Ed, the houses,
for the most part, individually support
their own libraries.
Yet houses are not only responsible for
the funding of their facilities. In most
cases, the residents are the employees as
well.
"The administration of each library is
vested in the dormitory in which it is lo
cated," explained Jenny Nicolaev, who, as
first-year supervisor of the residence libra
ries "directs, chooses and supervises" the
student librarians.
But, for the most part, students reap
the benefits of the libraries. "They are an
integral part of the dormitory program"
said Amy Wilson, a Toyon resident.
Fellow Toyonitc Gayle Long also praised
the residence library. "I find it pleasant to
be able to study where I know people. It's
also comforting to be able to ask someone
a question if I don't understand what I'm
doing," she said.
Jenny Fields agreed with Long. "It's a

cuddly room, it's just down the hall, the
furniture is comfortable and I can go back
to my room if I want to," she said. "Even
if a University library was outside my dorm
I'd still choose the dorm library".
There are currently 12 libraries, Toyon,
Branner, Wilbur and Stern being just a
few, and 14 librarians who supervise them.
"It's a big job." said Jennifer Kuan, a
Wilbur librarian. "We open the library and
keep it organized, answer any questions
and supervise the book supply."
The residence libraries can become an in
tegral part of dorm life. Books on reserve
or in heavy use at Meyer or Green Libra
ries, for instance, are often available in
dorm libraries, and the residence libraries
can make material immediately available
to the students when the book is part of
the Stanford Bookstore inventory. Special
interest collections can also be organized,
from books on overseas campus countries
to comic books.
As an attempt to make living on campus
more attractive and meaningful, the
residence libraries have fulfilled many stu
dents' needs. Still, in some respects, these
libraries still resemble the University ones.
As Eric Weinstock explains, "They're a
great place to sleep when trying to study."



In the libraries of Branner (above) and Roble (left), students study in a relaxed atmosphere.
At Roble, sophomore Amy Sobel studies in what looks more like a living room than a library.
The residence library system was started by Residential Education as a way to combine the
living and learning experiences at Stanford.
