## The 						Stanford Daily Report long overdue 
### 
Talk about deja vu. Last week Professors John
Manley and Ronald Rebholz circulated a peti
tion calling for an investigation of the relation
ship between Stanford and the Hoover
Institution.
Once again Manley and Rebholz have taken
the initiative to bring the Hoover issue to the
forefront of campus discussion, this time be
cause of sidetracking by the Reagan library pro
posal.
Last spring Manley and Rebholz led a petition
drive for an independent investigation of
Hoover's alleged partisan ties and its academic
and financial relationship to the University and
its departments. That petition urged the Board
of Trustees "to initiate an immediate and inde
pendent inquiry, including a public report, on
the relationship between the Hoover Institu
tion and Stanford University."
In May, the Faculty Senate requested the
trustees to investigate the situation. The Board
set up an ad hoc investigation committee con
sisting of Board President William Kimball and
Trustees Warren Christopher, Frank Tatum and
Nancy Barry Munger. Kimball said in July that
the committee would "study the whole situa
tion" and make a charge to a larger committee
that would be much more broadly based. He said
he hoped the trustee committee could wrap up
its duties during last summer.

At the end of summer, the committee mem
bers continued to study the issue themselves
and did not appoint another group.
Well, it's almost back to spring now. and like
Manley and Rebholz, we haven't heard much
from the committee. According to University
President Donald Kennedy, the committee
worked throughout the summer and the fall on
Reagan library negotiations. He told the Fac
ulty Senate last week that he expects the
formation of an advisory group to study the
process of academic appointments at Hoover
and University departments. He didn't give
specifics.
It's time for specifics. It's time for a status
report from the trustee committee so that stu
dents and faculty can know what's going on.
Will there be a larger committee with more
public input? Just where is the "immediate and
independent inquiry, including a public report
. .
It really should not have to take another
round of petitions to make sure the committee
is doing its work. Kimball has insisted that the
trustees aren't taking their charge lightly. And
they shouldn't. But unless we hear a report
from the committee and see some actions
carried out that were promised, it remains diffi
cult to tell.
