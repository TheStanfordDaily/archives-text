## Meyer does need refurnishing 
### 
In a recent lront page article
(Feb. 16) on the Meyer Library and
the panel which is currently studying
its program, I was quoted as saying
that "other things have a higher
priority" than a change in library
furnishings and atmosphere. Unfor
tunately, this quotation is out of
context and provides a very inac
curate view.
The Daily reporter who inter
viewed me for this article first asked
about a recent library survey on the
furniture in Meyer. I informed her
that no such survey had been con
ducted.
1 then went on to describe the
woeful inadequacy of the present
furniture, mention the work of the
panel and indicate that I had des
cribed the furniture problems to
members of the panel in the course
of a reccnt tour.
I also noted that we had enclosed
the large open atrium in the center
of the building several years ago in

an attempt to improve the library's
atmosphere.
Near the end of our interview, she
asked me about plans to spend
$350,000 on new furnishings for
Meyer. I told her that, to my knowl
edge, there were immediate plans to
upgrade the furniture, pending the
recommendations of the programs
study panel.
1 am greatly concerned about
Meyer and its ability to support the
University's undergraduate curricu
lum. Over the years, there have been
a number of efforts to improve the
library's atmosphere for serious
studying and to de-emphasize its
image as a social gathering place.
However, from my perspective, a
different mix of furnishing would
clearly further this process; and I
hope that the study panel will supr*
port this in its recommendations to
the president and provost.

Hi-yo Hoover
and away
"With his faithful English
teaching companion Ron, the daring
resourceful Masked Rider of Stan
ford leads the fight for law and
liberalism in the modern United
States. Nowhere in the pages of
history (except, perhaps, for the
McCarthy era) can one find a
greater champion of (his own)
justice. Return with us now to those
thrilling days of yesteryear. From
out of the past come the thundering
voices in the spirit of the great
'witch' hunts. A fiery horse, with
the speed of light â€” a cloud of dust,
and a hearty Hi-yo Hoover. John
Manley rides again." [Start William
Tell Overture.] (My apologies to
