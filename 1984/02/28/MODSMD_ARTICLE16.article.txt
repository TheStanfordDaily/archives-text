# CONSTANCE KURUPPU
## Let our kids hear the music 
### 
Early in my employment as a medical secretary at
Stanford Hospital. I met a woman who was also active in
union organizing and was willing to listen to what I had
to say about my modest efforts in the peace and anti
nuclear movements. We both wished that nuclear weap
ons had never been invented. Claudia was keen on music
and. in one conversation, she gazed at me, surprise sud-

VIEWPOINT

denly lighting up her face — "There'll be no more
Mozart," she said.
A week ago. my favorite radio station (KPF : A) played
Bach all day, along with some Vivaldi. Fascinating con
trast. Bach admired his inventive and playful Italian con
temporary.
On the day after, there will be no more Bach, no more
Vivaldi, no more Beethoven or Brahms, no more Purcell
or Benjamin Britten or John Cage or Prokofiev.

Whoever your favorite composers may be. you will not be
able to listen to recordings of their music or hear live
performances after the nuclear holocaust.
It is not a moral problem, is it? Or maybe it is. To me,
the death of all the world's children and the extinction
of the species are crimes of a hideous and colossal scale
that can barely be comprehended by the human mind.
But it is also wrong, crudely and wickedly wrong, to
destroy the culture which has accumulated over cen
turies to delight our souls and purify and lift our emo
tions.
It is our job now, as members of a great university and
center of American culture, to educate our government
and to denounce its present nuclear policies before it is
too late. The man who now occupies the White House is
making careful plans to destroy my grandchild, to
destroy you and your children. Let us unite and stop him.
