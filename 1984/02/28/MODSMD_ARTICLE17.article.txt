## And the lines get longer and longer 
### 
Like many students, I use the
Stanford Post Office; like many stu
dents I read letters to The Daily
about the atrocious service at the
Post Office. But, unlike many stu
dents. I cannot stand this service any
longer without complaining.

VIEWPOINT

Last Thursday I was happy to
notice that it was only 11:40 a.m.
when I got out of class.
This meant 1 would have time to
mail a parcel, even considering the
usual slow service. I was also happy to
see that the line wasn't too long. (In
retrospect, 1 realize this happiness
was an illusion and suspect that Post
Office users are beginning to respond
to slow service by using the Post Of
fice only at times which are incon
venient and therefore not as busy.) I
was even happier to notice that when
10 minutes had elapsed, nearly halt
of the people ahead of me had been
served.
Then at 11:55. to my unbelieving
eyes, three of the clerks put a sign on
their counters saying "NEXI WIN
DOW PLEASE." This left one clerk
to serve a long and growing line of
dissatisfied customers and ktt me to
realize that only cold scraps would
remain at my eating club lor lunch.
No doubt the disappearing clerks

were comforted by the fact that the
line would still be there when they
returned from lunch. I noticed
shaking heads in the front of the
line, disbelief in the middle of the
line, and disgust as some people left
the back of the line.
How many times has something
like this happened to you at the
Stanford Post Office?
Mow many freshman classes have
come to Stanford to see the same

unimproved situation when they
left? It certainly hasn't improved
while I have been here!
On whom does the blame rest? Al
though the clerks receive our scowls,
are they responsible for shift changes
or for the size of the facility?
This is one of many complaint let
ters about the Post Office service
and I hope it won't be the last. I'm
afraid that the Post Office system
responds only to complaints: no ac

tion will he taken until many more
people complain and demand action
on the basis of numbers.
I encourage Post Office users to
write when you are abused; don't let
it continue. Surely if many letters
like this one appear, management will
improve the service.
Don't leave it to next year's users
to suffer â€” WRITE!
