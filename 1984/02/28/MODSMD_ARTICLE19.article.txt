## When profit is too high 
### 
Why is the figure $3.37 billion sig
nificant? Does it represent American
economic aid to underdeveloped
countries? Perhaps it is the federal
budget allocation to solar energy re
search, or the appropriation for the
National Endowment for the
Humanities?
None of the above. Rather, the
sum constitutes General Motors' re
ported 19N3 profits. Evidently, the
nation's largest automaker has made
an impressive recovery from its
recent slump. So far so good —
presumably long-term prospects also
look promising and GM will soon
rehire some of its labor force, more
than a quarter of which has been idle
for months or years.
Wrong again. GM, like Chrysler or
Ford, is hiring back a bare minimum
of its workers, relying instead on
those presently employed to perform
"voluntary" overtime. Profits have
risen because costs — especially labor
costs — have been slashed, and only
if the auto companies decide that
the recovery will last might they take
back more of their own work force.
Streamlining production, in other
words, does not necessarily mean
making it more efficient, but rather
closing more plants and laying off
more workers.
Angry workers at GM's Van Nuys,
Calif., plant are about to be
"streamlined," and they are protest
ing their plant's imminent shutdown
by organizing, or attempting to orga
nize, a city-wide boycott of pur
chases of all GM cars. Since Los
Angeles is the largest new-car mar
ket in the United States, a successful
boycott would not exactly have a
pleasant effect on GM's health.
How dare GM close its only assem
bly plant in California, they sputter
(actually there is also one in
Fremont), when sales are booming
and profits are soaring? Maintaining
that GM can furnish no acceptable
answer, the workers are rallying the
community to band together to
force GM to keep the plant open.
Ordinarily, it does not make sense
to refuse to buy a product in order to
force a company to continue to turn
out that product. However, if the
workers do succeed in winning a sub
stantial number to their cause, the
pressure on GM might indeed have
the desired effect. Unfortunately,
the campaign as presently conceived
will not appeal to a broad enough
population to make the effort
worthwhile.
Union organizers are touting GM's
decision as an act of deliberate dis

crimination against minorities and
are tailoring their campaign to reach
that audience. True, this particular
plant numbers more than 50 percent
Chicano and 15 percent black
employees (and 12 percent women),
and the black community in general is
still reeling from several recent plant
closures in nearby Southgate, a heav
ily black part of Los Angeles.
The union would be hard-pressed,
though, to come up with convincing
evidence that GM's proposal is inten
tionally designed to harm blacks.
Chicanos, or any other minority
group. The organizers' original in
clination. to draw the battle lines on
the worker vs. unresponsive manage
ment level, is sounder, and would be
especially good if they truly want the
boycott to be effective on a city
wide basis.
Understandably but regrettably,
UAW Local 645 is looking only at its
short-term prospects: Its plan is
good but its rationale is weak. The
real problem is national and it is so
severe that if GM really does keep
the plant open, it will be doing its
workers as well as itself a great dis
service.
GM was pleased to announce
recently a cooperative venture be
tween itself and Toyota in which GM
contributes facilities and wor-kers
and Toyota kicks in $ 150 'million m
capital. On the face of it, American
workers benefit tremendously: They
will have jobs. But the deal is a case
in point of how reliance on short
term windfalls will harm the workers
more than it will help them. The
American contribution, of usually
repetitive and unfulfilling labor, has
limited mileage. Most tasks which
the Fremont workers perform now
will be assumed by robots only a few
years hence, and most of the rest will
be moved overseas. At that point,
not only will the laborers be idle, but
they will have little chance of making
a comeback because, lulled by a false
prosperity, American inactivity in re
search and development will have
mangled our "catch-up" capacity.
Should the Big Three continue to
focus exclusively on profit, content
ing themselves with minor stylistic
alterations rather than intensive re
search and development of sophisti
cated components in which the
Japanese excel, this will be the
outcome not of the GM-Toyota
partnership but of the entire indus
try. Nor will our valiant efforts to
bury our national head in the sand
with domestic content laws shelter

Domestic content legislation does
calm those who seek a quick-fix
panacea to all the ills ot the Ameri
can auto industry. Its proponents
simply cannot comprehend the fact
that no amount of protectionist
legislation, be it tariffs, quotas or
"domestic content" hills, can save a
non-competitive industry. At best,
such laws can temporarily prop up
Detroit, but by giving it a false sense
of security and stripping away
whatever vestiges of innovative
spirit may somehow remain, it merely
makes the final, disastrous outcome
inevitable.
GM, with 44 percent of the
domestic market, should in theory
have the most resources to devote to
research and development. It
doesn't, and thus demonstrates its
cowardice and greed. However, it is
not the sole offender. CiM already
buys diesel engines from Isuzu, but
then again Chrysler buys transaxles
from Mitsubishi, and Ford obtains
many of its sophisticated compo
nents from Mazda.
The industry is, in short, depen
dent on Japanese know-how, and it is
to this malady that the Van Nuys
auto workers, the Fremont plant and
the nation should address them
selves. Local 645's boycott idea is
terrific, and consumers and auto
'woYi,ers nil over the country would jjo
well to pitch in to make the boycott
a success.
So long as the Big Three sells 9.2
million new cars a year in this
country, it will have no incentive to
look beyond its year-end charts. Cor
porate moguls will continue to realize
profits which are nothing short of
obscene, and no amount of posturing
by union leaders or unfriendly rheto
ric from concerned legislators will
make them rehire a hungry worker or
reopen a shuttered plant.
If, however, we as a nation stop
buying American cars altogether, we
will serve notice to the Big Three
that dinosaur technology, gas guz
zlers and planned obsolescence will no
longer be tolerated. It may mean
more hardship in the short run for
still-employed auto workers. But
over the long haul, it appears as if
the Van Nuys plant workers have hit
on the only effective strategy for
forcing three lazy companies to get
technologically competitive: Orga
nize, then hit them in the pocket
book .
