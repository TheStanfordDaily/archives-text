# Kennedy voices concern on Streleski release site
## 
### TROY EID Daily staff 
University President Donald Ken
nedy said it remains unclear whether
convicted murderer Theodore
Streleski will be paroled "in a venue
near Stanford" if his March 8 release
date is approved by doctors who con
ducted his psychiatric testing.
"We can only do so much," Ken
nedy said in a live KZSU broadcast
last night. "After all, we do have as a
condition of his (Streleski's) parole
that he not come to campus, and if
he does come of course we would see
to it that he would be removed as a
violation of his parole.
"I guess beyond trying to ban him
from the neighborhood jurisdictions
and beyond trying to secure his
parole to a different venue, there's
really not very much we can do
besides being as watchful as we can,"
he said.
The University is currently waiting
for the results of Streleski's psychia
tric review and, in the event that
Streleski is released, will work to
ensure that he is paroled "some dis
tance" from Stanford, Kennedy said.
But in the wake of his meetings
with California's attorney general
and Gov. George Deukmejian's of
fice, and after having had "a number
of conversations with people in the
state correctional authority," Ken
nedy said the University is also con
templating "other legal measures" in
the event of Streleski's release.

While the University has a "fully
equipped and very good legal office,"
Kennedy said it is "entirely possible"
that Stanford is seeking outside legal
counsel to assist in the Streleski case.
"We haven't at the moment as far
as I know made any commitment to
outside counsel to help represent
us," he said. "However, that's not
beyond the realm of possibilities in
this or in any other case."
Kennedy also said he did not know
if the University has been seeking
counsel from Stanford Law School

professors. But, he added, "the legal
office does frequently consult with
the Law School on such matters."
In the half-hour call-in radio show.
Kennedy also discussed military
related research here, especially De
partment of Defense (DoD)
projects. He said he does not see "an
alarming growth problem" in Stan
ford research funded by the DoD.
"It seems to me that it is perfectly
legitimate for an agency like the
DoD to fund some research that is
not specifically for military
purposes," he said. "The 20 percent
of University funding that originates
from DoD has in tact not grown a
great deal over the past decade and is
probably about the same as it was
throughout most of the late 605."

The University should be particu
larly concerned with how much DoD
money is targeted for fundamental
research that is of direct interest to
Stanford faculty, Kennedy said.
But he added that fundamental
research should be primarily financed
by the National Institutes of
Health, the National Science Foun
dation and similar scientific agencies.

Over the past two fiscal years, fun
ding to the University from these
groups has "increased significantly,
even in real dollar terms." Kennedy
said.
In response to other questions.
Kennedy said he did not know if he
would be meeting with concert
promoter Bill Graham to discuss pos
sible campus concerts. While he said
he would welcome the chance to

'We haven't at the
moment, as far as I
know, made any
commitment to outside
counsel to help
represent us. However,
that's not beyond the
realm of possibilities in
this or in any other
case/
- Donald Kennedy

meet with Graham "if he wants to
sit down and talk," he said, "I plan to
approach him quite cautiously."
Kennedy also said "there is ab
solutely no truth whatsoever" to
rumors that Stanford will increase
the size of its freshman class in
response to this year s record number
of applicants, up by more than 1000
from last year.
