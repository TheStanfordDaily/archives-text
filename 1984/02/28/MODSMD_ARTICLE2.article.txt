# Kennedy voices concern on Streleski release site

### TROY EID Daily staff 
University President Donald Ken
nedy said it remains unclear whether
convicted murderer Theodore
Streleski will be paroled "in a venue
near Stanford" if his March 8 release
date is approved by doctors who con
ducted his psychiatric testing.
"We can only do so much," Ken
nedy said in a live KZSU broadcast
last night. "After all, we do have as a
condition of his (Streleski's) parole
that he not come to campus, and if
he does come of course we would see
to it that he would be removed as a
violation of his parole.
"I guess beyond trying to ban him
from the neighborhood jurisdictions
and beyond trying to secure his
parole to a different venue, there's
really not very much we can do
besides being as watchful as we can,"
he said.
The University is currently waiting
for the results of Streleski's psychia
tric review and, in the event that
Streleski is released, will work to
ensure that he is paroled "some dis

But in the wake of his meetings
with California's attorney general
and Gov. George Deukmejian's of
fice, and after having had "a number
of conversations with people in the
state correctional authority," Ken
nedy said the University is also con
templating "other legal measures" in
the event of Streleski's release.

While the University has a "fully
equipped and very good legal office,"
Kennedy said it is "entirely possible"
that Stanford is seeking outside legal
counsel to assist in the Streleski case.
"We haven't at the moment as far
as I know made any commitment to
outside counsel to help represent
us," he said. "However, that's not
beyond the realm of possibilities in
this or in any other case."
Kennedy also said he did not know
if the University has been seeking
counsel from Stanford Law School

professors. But, he added, "the legal
office does frequently consult with
the Law School on such matters."
In the half-hour call-in radio show.
Kennedy also discussed military
related research here, especially De
partment of Defense (DoD)
projects. He said he does not see "an
alarming growth problem" in Stan
ford research funded by the DoD.
"It seems to me that it is perfectly
legitimate for an agency like the
