## Card women bounced again 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
The routine must be getting
intolerable. The Stanford wo
men's basketball team
returned home after five
straight road games to host Cal
State Long Beach and Cal
State Fullerton, but continued
its losing routine — dropping
another two games, 70-59 to
Fullerton on Friday and 89-57
to Long Beach on Saturday.
The Fullerton State game
fell into the "almost, but not
quite" category. The Cardinal
stayed even with the Titans
and trailed only 34-32 at
halftime. Stanford kept it
close in the second half, still
trailing by two until late in the
game when the Card was
forced to foul and the Titans
converted.
Stanford Head Coach Dotty
McCrea was pleased with the
effort despite the loss. "We
played well," she said. "If
people would compare our play
before the road games and
now, I think they'd see the im
provement we've made."
Leading the way for the
Card were the trio who have
carried much of the scoring
burden all year — sophomore
guard Virginia Sourlis, junior
forward Mary Bradach, and
sophomore center Sarah Evans.
All three had 14 points in the
contest. Also impressive was
freshman forward Karen
Goodewaagen, who came off
the bench to pull down 10
rebounds.
The following night was a
long one for the Cardinal. This
one fell into the "don't even
think about it" category. The
first time the two teams met,
Stanford gave the No. 7-
ranked 49ers a scare before
yielding, 73-62, but this time
that was not to be the case.
Explaining what happened,
McCrea said, "Last time we
kept scoring so that they

couldn't run. This time we
started missing and they just
outran us." She added, "We're
really outclassed against a
team like that."
The Cardinal opened up
quickly, racing out to an early
10-2 lead. Long Beach came
back though, and by halftime
the 49ers, now 18-5 overall and
9-1 in the WCAA, enjoyed a

19-point advantage. The cus
hion quickly reached 30 points
in the second half, and McCrea
emptied her bench early in the
half as the game got out of
reach.
Bradach led the Cardinal ef
fort with 14 points as no one
else reached double figures.
The losses drop Stanford's
record to 4-21 overall. In

WCAA conference play the
Card is winless in 1 1 starts.
Despite the dismal record, the
coaching staff is maintaining a
positive attitude about the
whole season.
The coaches realize that they
have a young team — there are
three sophomores and four
freshmen on the 10-player
roster — and are concentrating
on improving for the future
more so than the team's record
this season. Obviously they
don't like losing but realize the
situation they're in.
McCrea said before this
weekend, "Watching films has
helped us see how much we've
improved over the past six
weeks." Assistant Coach Mike
Kehoe has sounded the same
theme as well. Following the
Card's last win, a 73-69 non
conference decision over Pep
perdine Feb. 10, Kehoe said,
"We've crossed the edge, we've
broken through the wall."
Both have had moments
when they've had to wonder,
though. Following a loss Feb. 4
to an Arizona squad that had
also been winless in the confer
ence, McCrea said. "It was aw
ful. Our intensity was
non-existent. I don't know
what 1 have to do to give this
team the motivation to win."
Kehoe has also known his
frustrating moments. Follow
ing a loss to UCLA a week ago
Friday, he said, "It can be mad
dening sometimes." He realized
it would happen though.
"That's part of what you run
into with a young team."
The cagers have been close in
many of their losses, but
haven't been able to put the
opposition away. With in
creased experience and
maturity, the Card should
start winning spme of those
games. The team gets another
chance this weekend, as
Arizona and Arizona State
visit Maples.

Karen Goedwaagen (44) and Mary Bradach got to dole out a
little rejection of their own this weekend. Overall, however,
they and the rest of the Cardinal team ended up on the down
side, losing two games.
