No Progress
Junior Rick Lundblade hit the ball much harder and much farther on Sunday but he and
the Cardinal still couldn't get anywhere as they tied the University of Hawaii 13-13 in
the final game of their series. The game ended after four and a half hours and 10 in
nings when Stanford had to leave to catch its plane home. The Card's record now
stands at 11-10-1 with the indecision.
