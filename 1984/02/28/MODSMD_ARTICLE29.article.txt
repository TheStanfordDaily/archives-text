### PETER CASTILLO 
The Stanford wrestling team
closed the Pacific-10 season
Sunday with mixed results. It
will send three wrestlers to the
NCAA Championships, but it
only placed fourth in the Pac
-10 Championship meet.
Oregon State dominated the
meet by winning six of the ten
weight classes and finishing
first with 98 points. Arizona
State was a close second with
94 points. Washington State
had 57.5, Stanford 33.5 and
Oregon 21.75 to round out the
top five.
"Overall we had a fair day.
We finished a solid fourth, but
if we wrestled a little better
we could have taken third,"
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
said.
"The pluses are that we
qualified the same amount of
wrestlers as last year and had
more third or better finishers,
but on the other hand we had
two less than fourth or better
finishers," Horpel said.
At 134 pounds, Jeff Bradley
trounced Oregon's Reagan
Ross 13-2 for third place and
was chosen as a wild-card entry
to the NCAAs by the coaches.
Bradley has continued to show
progress and again proved him
self to be tough under pres
sure.
Scott Wiggen (142 pounds)

lost in the finals to Oregon
State's Cliff Berger 6-3, but
his second-place finish still
qualifies for the NCAAs.
During the match Wiggen was
protecting a torn rib cartilage
and this prevented him 4rom
using his attacking techniques,
but his injury should be healed
by the NCAA Championship.
Jeff Wilson (177 pounds)
capped a great season by finish
ing second, too. Arizona
State's Tom Klompus defeated
Wilson 16-4 for the crown.
Horpel said he feels that Wil
son did not have a great tourn
ament and that he could do

better at the NCAA Cham
pionships.
Wilson proved his talent pre
viously by finishing second in
the Caesar's Palace Invitation
al, which Horpel said was as
tough as the NCAA tourna
ment will be.
Another wrestler who had a
fine tournament was Bert
Fukunaga (118 pounds).
Fukunaga captured third by
crushing Jim Thorpe of Wash
ington State, 15-2.
At 126 pounds there were
only three wrestlers entered.

Neil Wartnick was pinned in his
only match for third.
The most valuable wrestler
of the meet was Jim Baum
gardner of Oregon State.
Baumgardner easily defeated
Arizona State's Davies
22-8.
"By only working with three
wrestlers I can concentrate on
the little mistakes. In the next
ten days they will learn more
then they did in the last
month," Horpel said. "They
have to have a good mental at
titude, for there are so many
good wrestlers. They have to
feel ready and not panic."

Sophomore Scott Wiggen managed to get off all fours enough at the Pac-10 Championships
to earn a second place finish and a berth to the NCAA Championships next month.
