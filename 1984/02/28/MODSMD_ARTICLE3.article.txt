# Kennedy'a little sore' with fluoride snafu
## 
### 
University President Donald Kennedy said yesterday he is
"embarrassed and a little sore" that a year passed before the University
notified campus residents of a decision to stop fluoridating drinking
water.
In a statement to campus homeowners released yesterday, Kennedy
said the decision to end fluoridation of the University's drinking water
was "not communicated" to his office or the Office of Housing Pro
grams.
"The failure to give campus homeowners prompt notification of the
change was unacceptable, though apparently inadvertant," the state
ment said. "I want to assure you that we will do everything possible to
avoid a similar occurence in the future."
In a radio interview with reporters last night, Kennedy said there is
"no question but that campus consumers of water should have been
told (of the decision) immediately." The delay in informing the public
had "not much to do with conspiracy and a lot to do with inadver-
tancy," Kennedy said, "but that
doesn't make it excusable."
The University's decision to stop
fluoridating drinking water came to
public attention when the Office of
Housing Programs sent a memo to
campus residents last week, almost a
full year after the last of the Uni
versity's three fluoridation stations
broke down.
Martin Pearson, the assistant
director of Utilities Systems, told
The Daily last week that his depart
ment's failure to notify campus resi
dents was not "properly
explainable."'
Kennedy said yesterday that the
University will undertake a "prompt
analysis" of the cost of resuming
fluoridation and of "suitable alter
natives" before taking any further
action on the matter.
In the radio interview, Kennedy

said he has asked for cost estimates
on resuming fluoridation and will
make a further statement after he
receives that information.
According to Paul Walters, direc
tor of Cowell Student Health Cen
ter, fluoride protects children
against tooth decay while they ob
tain permanent teeth. Children who
do not receive fluoride in their drink
ing water should compensate with al
ternatives such as fluoride pills or
drops, he said.
