# Men fencers crush USF
## Women take West Regional 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The Stanford women's fencing team
pulled off a pair of big firsts this weekend
in the NCAA Western Regionals at the
Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs.
The Cardinal won the championship with
a perfect 5-0 mark and a 9-7 victory over
arch-rival San Jose State in the final.
That may not seem like a major achieve
ment for a team that was 13-0 going into
the meet and had beaten all the teams at
the tournament previously, but that
achievement had been a long time coming.
To be exact, the Western Regionals have

been going on lor 27 years and Stanford
had never won the championship before. In
tact, no Cardinal had ever won the individ
ual title until Jennifer Yu captured it this
weekend.
But the Cardinal finally got its first
title and earned a chance to go to the
NCAA tournament next month at Prince
ton University. In doing so. the Card also
had to overcome what Head Coach Buzz
Hurst termed "heavy casualties."
Freshman Holly Taylor pulled a hamstr
ing during the competition and senior
Cathy Correa continued to suffer from an
arm injury which became so bad that at

one point she "could not feel the weapon
in her hand." according to Hurst.
Hopefully for the Cardinal, both of
them will return to full strength for the
NCAAs. It they do. Hurst forsees a
probable sixth place finish with defending
champion Penn State being the favorite to
take the title again.
The men's team travelled to USF while
the women were in Colorado and recorded
its second win against the Dons this
season. 21-6. The men are now 12-2 for
the year and will compete in their Western
Regional Championship on March 10-I2 at
Cal State Northridge in l.os Angeles.


Stanford fencing teams continued their domination of the in
tercollegiate circuit. The women's team, led by Jennifer Yu,
won its first Western Regional Championship in 27 years,

and the men's team warmed up for the regionals with a 21-6
win over USF.
