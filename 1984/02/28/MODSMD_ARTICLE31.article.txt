## 'Trelawny of the "Wells" amateurs 'in the profession' 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
Despite energetic performances by some
of the company, the production of
"Trelawny of the 'Wells' " now running at
the Little Theater settles into a genteel
stability early in the first act, and main
tains a decent but unexciting composure
through to the finale. Several roles in this
play about theater people in the lX6Os
present considerable challenges to inexper
ienced actors. The cast of this production
has been afflicted with the additional bur
den of English accents, which has ex
acerbated the problems with pacing and
energy that hobble the production.
Arthur Wing Pinero's "comedietta,"
which premiered in London in IX9B, offers
a memorial to Tom Robertson within its
conventional romantic intrigue. Robertson
revived the English stage of the mid- 19th
century with his "cup-and-saucer
comedies," dramas dealing with ordinary
subjects, staged and acted realistically,
which reacted against the period's arid
conventions and declamatory style. The

amatory tribulations of Rose Trelawny,
leading romantic actress at the Sadler's
Wells Theatre, provide the principal ten
sion in the play, while the eventually suc
cessful efforts of Tom Wrench to get his
plays produced offer a secondary intrigue,
parallel to the early career of Robertson.
After a harmless musical preface,
Johanna Dickey's production gets under
way, introducing most of the cast in the
first of four acts. A farewell luncheon is
given for Rose, who is leaving the stage to
spend some time living with the relatives
of her upper-class beau, Arthur Gower,
with the expectation that she will meet
their approval and be allowed to marry
him. This background information is given
in a dialogue between serving-people, Mrs.
Mossop (Weik Kruitwagen) and Mr.
Ablett (Geoffrey Proehl). Though Kruit
wagen acquits herself well enough in a sim
liar dialogue at the beginning of Act
Three, here she is not only overshadowed
by the lively Proehl, but also provides the
first and worst example of the accents and
dialects that keep getting in the actors'
way. For mysterious reasons, she has been
given an accent that sounds vaguely East
European, and though she does a fair job
of making it work, it just shouldn't be
there at all.
Before the repertory company of. the
Wells arrives, Tom Wr'c'nch '(Frederick
Ben/) appears, and his conversation with
the help and with Imogen Parrot (Celia
Maurice) offers the one occasion in which
he must capture our interest and sympa
thy, in order for his career to provide the
comedy's supporting plot. Benz's Tom is
inoffensive, but not especially dynamic or
appealing. In this first appearance, the

script has him mock himself theatrically,
and that makes it especially hard for him
to gain our compassion. But the passage
ends with him speaking more honestly and
passionately, and on the night I attended
Benz failed to leave the oratorical style
for this crucial section, thus losing the op
portunity to establish himself as a major
character in the audience's mind.
In this passage, Benz was hampered by
his accent, which forced him to slow his
speech. That he and some other members
of the cast need not have been thus
impeded in their pacing was demonstrated
by an excellent stichomythic exchange of
short lines that Benz delivered with Celia
Maurice. Identifable as Imogen Parrot by
the lurid green of her dress and eyeshadow,
Maurice was throughout the play one of
the most dependably lively and convincing
characters.
The members of the Wells repertory
company, Rose, and her intended, Arthur,
all appear in the rest of the act. The large
number of actors on stage affords director
Johanna Dickey the occasion to display her
skill at blocking. Throughout the play the
characters are disposed about the stage in
interesting, varied, and realistic ways.
The end of the first act is full of activ
ity and motion, but one of the other char
acter's remarks about the company clown,
Augustus Colpoys (Tom Dobrocky)
seemed apropos for the whole interlude:
"He'd stand on his head in the street to
get a dog laughing." This dog did not laugh
as much as he would have liked. Dobrocky
is got up in a wig and hat to look like
Harpo Marx, an idea I found unappealing
and strained, much as his overdone, big
gags were (he displayed more subtlety
later). Rose (Polly Firestone) was pretty
and charming enough to earn affection,
but not vigorous enough to sieze atten
tion. Arthur (Ted Osborne) has a difficult
role, but could have been a bit less anxious.
He relied on grimaces, though to a lesser
extent than several of the other actors.
The other notable of this scene was
Avonia Bunn (Andrea Sheh), chiefly

'And what's worse, you've
made her genteel!'
- Avonia Bunn, about
Rose Trelawny.

remarkable for the way she upstaged Os
borne a bit earlier than was called for. But
Sheh's energy was a relief later on in the
play, and made up for a certain artlessness
in her interpretation of the crass Cockney
role she played.
The change of scene between the first
qnd second acts showed how lavishly this
production has been staged. I would note,
however, a certain infidelity to the realis
tic ideals of Tom Robertson that the play
celebrates. He objected to the use of
painted flats and non-working props, but
here the setting is based on flats painted
with enlargements of 19th century
engravings, depicting contemporary inter
iors. Since the character Tom Wrench at

one point explicitly says that in his plays he
wants "locks on the doors, real locks that
work," it is a particularly droll moment
when William CJower says, "open the win
dows, let in the air," and then walks over
to a painted window.
William Gower is played by David Kud
ler, who first appears in the second act.
From his first lines, his assurance and pres
ence make him the dominant figure in the
play. Though he puts on a voice, Kudler
does not employ an accent strong or
strange enough to get in the way of his
acting, and that acting is not only per
suasive and controlled, it is also vibrant
with an energy that almost all the other
players lack. Rose (Firestone) and Arthur
(Osborne) still failed to deliver convincing
emotion during the tense scene where Ar
thur's relatives oppress her, and the only
remarkable actor besides Kudler was John
Tierney, as Captain de Foenix. He is di
rected to overact, but does so with enough
restraint to make his burlesque quite
amusing.
At intermission, the play had already
run almost an hour and a half. The breakup
of Arthur and Rose's engagement at the

end of the second act could give little
cause for interest or concern, since they
had hardly gotten the audience involved in
their romance, which seemed to be mere
childish play-acting at love. The resolution
of this intrigue, and the arrangement of
an opportunity for Tom Wrench to
produce his play, trundled on their way
through the third and fourth acts, and the
play arrived at a satisfactory conclusion
two hours and forty minutes after the
lights first dimmed. In the second half,
relief was offered principally by the reap
pearance of Kudler (who plays a touching
scene with Firestone that calls out the
best of her talents), some good passages
acted by Sheh and the reliable solidity of
Maurice.
"Trelawny of the 'Wells' " is a longish
script and demands perhaps too much con
trol and sophistication for a cast of
amateurs. But traces of talent are visible
in most of the actors in Johanna Dickey's
production, and she has stifled some of
them under the too-varied and overem
phasized accents given the cast. The lack
of energy and the relatively slow pace of
the production as a whole are also, ul
timately, the director's responsiblity. I
have often enough heard directors cry
despairingly for more vigor~and involve
ment in the action, and 1 know that
motivating actors is the most difficult
task a director has, but it is unfortunate
that Dickey was unable to make the entire
cast operate at a level of energy that a
few of the actors were able to maintain
without much support from their col
leagues.

end of the second act could give little
cause for interest or concern, since they
had hardly gotten the audience involved in
their romance, which seemed to be mere
childish play-acting at love. The resolution
of this intrigue, and the arrangement of
an opportunity for Tom Wrench to
produce his play, trundled on their way
through the third and fourth acts, and the
play arrived at a satisfactory conclusion
two hours and forty minutes after the

relief was offered principally by the reap

scene with Firestone that calls out the

acted by Sheh and the reliable solidity of
Maurice.
"Trelawny of the 'Wells' " is a longish
script and demands perhaps too much con
trol and sophistication for a cast of
amateurs. But traces of talent are visible
in most of the actors in Johanna Dickey's
production, and she has stifled some of
them under the too-varied and overem
phasized accents given the cast. The lack
of energy and the relatively slow pace of
the production as a whole are also, ul
timately, the director's responsiblity. I
have often enough heard directors cry
despairingly for more vigor~and involve
ment in the action, and 1 know that
motivating actors is the most difficult
task a director has, but it is unfortunate
that Dickey was unable to make the entire
cast operate at a level of energy that a
few of the actors were able to maintain
without much support from their col
leagues.

Despite energetic performances by some
of the company, the production of
"Trelawny of the 'Wells' " now running at
the Little Theater settles into a genteel
stability early in the first act, and main
tains a decent but unexciting composure
through to the finale. Several roles in this
play about theater people in the lX6Os
present considerable challenges to inexper
ienced actors. The cast of this production
has been afflicted with the additional bur
den of English accents, which has ex
acerbated the problems with pacing and
energy that hobble the production.
Arthur Wing Pinero's "comedietta,"
which premiered in London in IX9B, offers
a memorial to Tom Robertson within its
conventional romantic intrigue. Robertson
revived the English stage of the mid- 19th
century with his "cup-and-saucer
comedies," dramas dealing with ordinary
subjects, staged and acted realistically,
which reacted against the period's arid
conventions and declamatory style. The

amatory tribulations of Rose Trelawny,
leading romantic actress at the Sadler's
Wells Theatre, provide the principal ten
sion in the play, while the eventually suc
cessful efforts of Tom Wrench to get his
plays produced offer a secondary intrigue,
parallel to the early career of Robertson.
After a harmless musical preface,
Johanna Dickey's production gets under
way, introducing most of the cast in the
first of four acts. A farewell luncheon is
given for Rose, who is leaving the stage to
spend some time living with the relatives
of her upper-class beau, Arthur Gower,
with the expectation that she will meet
their approval and be allowed to marry
him. This background information is given
in a dialogue between serving-people, Mrs.
Mossop (Weik Kruitwagen) and Mr.
Ablett (Geoffrey Proehl). Though Kruit
wagen acquits herself well enough in a sim
liar dialogue at the beginning of Act
Three, here she is not only overshadowed
by the lively Proehl, but also provides the
first and worst example of the accents and
dialects that keep getting in the actors'
way. For mysterious reasons, she has been
given an accent that sounds vaguely East
European, and though she does a fair job
of making it work, it just shouldn't be
there at all.
Before the repertory company of. the
Wells arrives, Tom Wr'c'nch '(Frederick
Ben/) appears, and his conversation with
the help and with Imogen Parrot (Celia
Maurice) offers the one occasion in which
he must capture our interest and sympa
thy, in order for his career to provide the
comedy's supporting plot. Benz's Tom is
inoffensive, but not especially dynamic or
appealing. In this first appearance, the

script has him mock himself theatrically,
and that makes it especially hard for him
to gain our compassion. But the passage
ends with him speaking more honestly and
passionately, and on the night I attended
Benz failed to leave the oratorical style
for this crucial section, thus losing the op
portunity to establish himself as a major
character in the audience's mind.
In this passage, Benz was hampered by
his accent, which forced him to slow his
speech. That he and some other members
of the cast need not have been thus
impeded in their pacing was demonstrated
by an excellent stichomythic exchange of
short lines that Benz delivered with Celia
Maurice. Identifable as Imogen Parrot by
the lurid green of her dress and eyeshadow,
Maurice was throughout the play one of
the most dependably lively and convincing
characters.
The members of the Wells repertory
company, Rose, and her intended, Arthur,
all appear in the rest of the act. The large
number of actors on stage affords director
Johanna Dickey the occasion to display her
skill at blocking. Throughout the play the
characters are disposed about the stage in
interesting, varied, and realistic ways.
The end of the first act is full of activ
ity and motion, but one of the other char
acter's remarks about the company clown,
Augustus Colpoys (Tom Dobrocky)
seemed apropos for the whole interlude:
"He'd stand on his head in the street to
get a dog laughing." This dog did not laugh
as much as he would have liked. Dobrocky
is got up in a wig and hat to look like
Harpo Marx, an idea I found unappealing
and strained, much as his overdone, big
gags were (he displayed more subtlety
later). Rose (Polly Firestone) was pretty
and charming enough to earn affection,
but not vigorous enough to sieze atten
tion. Arthur (Ted Osborne) has a difficult
role, but could have been a bit less anxious.
He relied on grimaces, though to a lesser
extent than several of the other actors.
The other notable of this scene was
Avonia Bunn (Andrea Sheh), chiefly

'And what's worse, you've
made her genteel!'
- Avonia Bunn, about
Rose Trelawny.

remarkable for the way she upstaged Os
borne a bit earlier than was called for. But
Sheh's energy was a relief later on in the
play, and made up for a certain artlessness
in her interpretation of the crass Cockney
role she played.
The change of scene between the first
qnd second acts showed how lavishly this
production has been staged. I would note,
however, a certain infidelity to the realis
tic ideals of Tom Robertson that the play
celebrates. He objected to the use of
painted flats and non-working props, but
here the setting is based on flats painted
with enlargements of 19th century
engravings, depicting contemporary inter
iors. Since the character Tom Wrench at

one point explicitly says that in his plays he
wants "locks on the doors, real locks that
work," it is a particularly droll moment
when William CJower says, "open the win
dows, let in the air," and then walks over
to a painted window.
William Gower is played by David Kud
ler, who first appears in the second act.
From his first lines, his assurance and pres
ence make him the dominant figure in the
play. Though he puts on a voice, Kudler
does not employ an accent strong or
strange enough to get in the way of his
acting, and that acting is not only per
suasive and controlled, it is also vibrant
with an energy that almost all the other
players lack. Rose (Firestone) and Arthur
(Osborne) still failed to deliver convincing
emotion during the tense scene where Ar
thur's relatives oppress her, and the only
remarkable actor besides Kudler was John
Tierney, as Captain de Foenix. He is di
rected to overact, but does so with enough
restraint to make his burlesque quite
