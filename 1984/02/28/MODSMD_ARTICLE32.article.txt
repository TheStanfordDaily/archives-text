Man out of time
So this is where he'll come to hide,
when he runs from view. In his
presidential coat and tie, and his oh
so-preppy shoes. The editor from The
Daily, interviewing the president, is a
far cry from Costello, or whatever he
meant.
That was beautiful, but it didn't
say much. This does. University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy will speak —

on the record — at a staff lunch (no
jokes about a staff Lynch, please)
Thursday. Please remember,
though, that even presidents have
newspaper. . . ahem.
Wednesday week
The chairman of this boredom is a
compliment collector. I'd like to be
his funeral director. Opportunity.
Opportunity. This is your big oppor
tunity. Opportunity, if you're on

edit board, to meet for the second
time in a week, that is. We've lis
tened to the candidate's debate,
laughed about it, shouted about it,
but now we've got to choose. Any
way we look at it we lose. Wednes
day. noon, edit board in New
Hampshire. I mean, edit board on
New Hampshire. I mean, I mean, I
mean I think I never should have
mixed Elvis and Simon and Gar
funkel. i can't stand up for falling
down.
