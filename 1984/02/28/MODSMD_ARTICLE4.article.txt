# OSA publicizes rules after Hart and Cranston mix-ups here
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
The Office of Student Activities (OSA)
is currently trying to publicize University
guidelines which prohibit use of University
facilities and services in support of political
candidates by distributing copies of the
guidelines, acccording to OSA Director Ellen
Oppenheim.
The move comes in the wake of violations
by groups for presidential candidates Sen.
Alan Cranston and Sen. Gary Hart. Last
month, the Cranston campaign held a fund
raiser in the Faculty Club and earlier this
month the Stanford Students With Hart
used ASSU bulk rate permits and an ASSU
return address on a mailing.

Oppenheim said said the Hart incident
"caused us to go out and remind everyone
about what the regulations really are."
She said the OSA has supplied the ASSU
with a list of groups that could not use the
ASSU bulk rate and started distributing
copies of the guidelines u> groups.
"No one acted in a way intended to flaunt
the guidelines," she said. "I hope that now
we've been successful in making sure staff
are aware of the guidelines."
The University's guidelines state that
"the University is prohibited by law from in
tervening in any manner on behalf of any
candidate for public office, including such
activities as solicitation of funds or endorse
ments.

"No group or individual supporting candi
dates for public office or engaging in other
political activities may use University space
or facilities or receive University support,"
except for use of public spaces and on
campus meeting rooms, the guidelines state.
Stanford Students WitfTHart has reim
bursed the U.S. Post Office for discounts
the group received when it improperly used
the ASSU bulk rate for mailings.
ASSU officials said they were not aware
that the Hart group's use of the bulk rate
and ASSU return address violated the Uni
versity policy when they approved the dis
counted mailing which is available to most
student groups.
"No one gave us a copy (of the guidelines)

and no one in the office was aware that
there were different guidelines for political
groups," said ASSU Financial Manager
Mindy Basham.
Rick Roby, a graduate student in mechani
cal engineering who is the co-coordinator of
the Hart campaign, said there was a "a com
munication problem in the ASSU and the
' Office of Student Activities."
He said the group repaid the ASSU about
$34 for the 5.2 cents per letter discount
they received. The ASSU repaid the U.S.
Post Office. Roby said the group also helped
send out a flyer prepared by the Council of
Presidents which said the ASSU should not
be used as a return address for the Hart
group and that the University did not sup

port the Hart campaign.
University administrators and faculty also
said they did not believe that Roby or Jeff
Phillips, Students With Harts co
coordinator, misused their offices in the Me
chanical Engineering Department in support
of the group.
Roby said he did not make out-going calls
for the group and only listed his home tele
phone number as the number to call for in
formation about the group in mailings.
Roby said Sally Mahoney, University
registrar responsible for application and in
terpretation of the guidelines, igreed that
the group had not misused the phones. She
