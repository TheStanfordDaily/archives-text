Yet another royal European pres
ence will grace Stanford next month
when the king of Sweden drops in for
a one-day visit on the Farm.
King Carl XVI Gustaf, an honorary
member of the Royal Swedish
Academy of Engineering Sciences,
will visit campus with IS other mem
bers of the academy on March 14.
According to Lars Malmstrom,
press attache to the Swedish Consul
ate in Los Angeles, the purpose of
the academy's visit is to establish the
first chapter abroad of the academy,
whieh will be based in San Francisco,
and to visit some of the industries in
the area. The academy's stop here is
part of a week-long visit to the Bay
Area and Seattle.
In addition. Malmstrom said, the
visit will serve to continue the ex
change between the Swedish
Academy and the U.S. National
Academy of Engineering. Next year,
the U.S. Academy will visit Sweden.
The king is the second European
monarch to visit Stanford within a
year. Last March, Queen Elizabeth 11
of England came to lunch on campus

during her tour of California.
According to Malmstrom, the king
has no formal education in engineer
ing, but he is a "very curious guy."
The king's main strength is in envi
ronmental issues, he said.
The monarch's visit here will begin
with a breakfast at the home of
Provost Albert Hastorf, attended by
about 20 students from Sweden who
are studying here.
The" academy members will attend
a series of meetings on engineering
and related topics throughout the
day. In addition, they will have lunch
at the home of University President
Donald Kennedy.
The luncheon will also be attended
by about 20 students chosen by their
engineering-related departments.
According to Pat Boesch, commu
nications events director, the stu
dents will not have to worry about
following any special protocol while
lunching with royalty this time
around.
'â€¢The Swedish are not as stringent
about that as I guess some others
are." she said. "1 don't think they
(the students) will have to worry
about it."
