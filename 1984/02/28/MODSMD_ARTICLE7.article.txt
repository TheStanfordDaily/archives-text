# Experts debate ballistic missile systems
## 
### LISA PALMER 
"Deterrence is just a polite label
for murder," Lowell Wood, the
leader of Lawrence Livermore Labo
ratory's special studies group, told a
capacity Terman Auditorum crowd
last night during a debate on antibal
listic missile (ABM) defense systems.
Wood said a space-based ABM sys
tem would allow human-free wars to
be fought "far away from earth."
adding that developing such technol
ogy is both feasible and "more effi
cient per dollar."
But Prof. Sidney Drell. Co-director
of the Center for International Se

curity and Arms Control and deputy
director of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, said the technology
necessary to establish an effective
ABM system "does not exist, and
will not exist in the foreseeable
future."
The debate was televised bv NBC
and will be broadcast on the "First
Camera" program in three or four
weeks, according to Prof. John Lewis,
debate moderator and co-director of
the center.
Wood, who helped brief President
Reagan for his "Star Wars" speech
last spring, claimed the media is re
sponsible for misinforming the public

about several aspects of strategic
defense.
Contrary to popular perception,
strategic defense could be viable by
the end of the century, he said. ABM
systems, including lasers and particle
beams, could be either ground- or
space-based.
Wood questioned the cost of
maintaining present offensive nu
clear weapons systems. "One unit of
defense will counter 10 units of of
fense." he said.
And development of a ballistic
missile system does not violate the
1972 ABM Treaty with the Soviet
Union, he said. Refuting claims that

the proposed ABM system would be
destabilizing. Wood claimed the pres
ent system of nuclear deterrence
based on an offensive — rather than
defensive — military system is des
tabilizing.
According to Drell, the United
States needs to build a solid political
base first while maintaining its pres
ent system of strategic defense.
Before the United States abandons
the system which has prevented nu
clear war for the last 20 years,
decision-makers must develop a bet
ter plan.
He added that the the United
States is better off living with
"imperfect treaties" than risking a
destabilizing, dangerous new policy
of ballistic missle systems.
And an ABM system would prob
ably cost "upwards of $500 billion."
Drell said.
The fact that the Reagan adminis
tration has classified details of
defense systems makes concrete dis
cussion of the problems and possibili
ties for ballistic missile defense
difficult, Wood said. However, the
two defense experts debated such
topics as a "pop-up" system, a
ground-based system which can be
launched into space at the time of an
attack, and how best to spend a lim
ited resource — money — to achieve
security.
Wood and Drell also disagreed as
to the viability of arms control.
The Soviets have consistantly vio
lated treaties and are presently
moving ahead with an ABM system

that undermines deterrence, Wood
said.
The Soviets "are believed to have
operational precisely those systems
banned by the ABM Treaty," he said.
But Drell countered that while the

Soviets do apparently have one ABM
radar station presently in violation
of the ABM Treaty, that violation's
overall effect on superpower
stability "is nil."
He added that "up until this past

year," the Standing Consultative
Commission of U.S. and Soviet offi
cials that helps verify the ABM
Treaty and other arms control agree
ments had resolved all publically an
nounced compliance disputes.
