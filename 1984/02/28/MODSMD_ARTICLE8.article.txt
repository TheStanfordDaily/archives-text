Israel considers options
Jerusalem — Israeli policy-makers, fighting growing pres
sure for an abrupt pullback in southern Lebanon that they
fear could set off renewed communal fighting there, are
now trying to •'buy time" while attempting to reach under
standings with southern Lebanese factions on Israel's secur
ity needs, a senior Israeli official said yesterday.
The official, who has been deeply involved for months in
mapping Israeli moves in southern Lebanon, conceded that
the effort might fail and that Israel might feel compelled
to pull back from its present positions along the Awali
River north of Sidon before it has reached satisfactory un
derstandings with local leaders, particularly the majority
Shiite Moslem community.
But in any case, he said. Israeli policy-makers no longer
foresee the possibility of a complete withdrawal from
Lebanon. He said there will have to be an "indefinite" Is
raeli presence just north of the border, possibly in an area
corresponding to the belt three to six miles deep that has
long been controlled by the Israeli-supplied militia of Saad
Haddad, who died last month.
In an argument that appears to have been persuasive with
the Cabinet, he warned that an abrupt Israeli troop pul
lback now would virtually guarantee an influx of Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrillas back to southern
Lebanon and risk a repetition of the kind of sectarian
lighting that erupted in the Chouf mountains following
the Israeli withdrawal from there last September.
Reagan says tax hike possible
Washington — President Reagan will consider a tax in
crease in 1985 to help balance the federal budget if
Congress first agrees to make "all possible spending cuts"
and if a large deficit still remains, the chairman of the Na
tional Governors' Association said yesterday after the
states' chief executives met with Reagan.
Republican Gov. James Thompson of Illinois told
reporters after the closed session that he felt the presi
dent's willingness to consider raising revenues next year
"represented kind of a breakthrough" in the political bat
tle over the soaring deficit.
But Democratic governors were not impressed. They
argued that the deficit should be tackled this year, not
next, and expressed fears about how much more deeply
Reagan would seek to cut domestic programs if he were re
elected.
Thompson, attempting to play the role of peacemaker
between the White Flouse and Democratic governors, who
control 34 of 50 statehouses, said Reagan listed the condi
tions he would insist on before considering a tax increase.
"He says that after all the spending cuts that should be
made are made, (and) if there still was a deficit that was
considered harmful, he would be willing to consider raising
taxes," Thompson said. He emphasized that Reagan meant
"all possible spending cuts" and new restrictions on the
growth of so-called entitlement programs, which include
Social Security and Medicare.
Hussein calls on Arafat to trade
peace for Israeli territory
Amman, Jordan — King Hussein of Jordan told PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat yesterday that the only possible
way for Palestinians to obtain a homeland is to trade Israel
peace and secure borders — in effect, recognition — in
return for territory on the West Bank of the Jordan River.
If accepted by the Palestine Liberation Organization, the
formula would require substantial changes in the PLO's
long-standing policy of not officially recognizing Israel's
right to exist.
The king's position in the closed talks, which began Sun
day, was pieced together from a blandly worded official
communique and the private remarks of well-placed Jor
danian sources. There was no indication of Arafat's reac
tion, although the talks were said to have been "friendly
and constructive."
According to the communique, Hussein said the solution
to the Palestinian problem "must be for Israel to exchange
territory for peace and secure borders." It added that U.N.
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 are "the basis for
a peaceful settlement."
Networks defend coverage
Washington — Network television executives, under fire
at a congressional hearing for their coverage of the lowa
Democratic caucuses, yesterday staunchly defended their
practice of making early projections of voting results.
"We believe it is our role as journalists to report, and not
withhold, the information we have," CBS News Vice Presi
dent Ralph Goldberg testified to the House Energy and
Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications. Con
sumer Protection and Finance.
How the networks gather information for early projec
tions, as well as the timing of their broadcasts, have
provoked unhappiness from Congress, officials both major
political parties, other broadcasters and the public — espe
cially residents of Western states, who are last to cast their
ballots in presidential elections.
At the hearing, Rep. Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.) ques
tioned what public policy justification the networks had
for not waiting until the polls close to predict who has won
an election or caucus.
DoD begins new space weapon
Washington — The Defense Department has begun work
on a second-generation anti-satellite weapon that could
destroy enemy spacecraft in high orbits, the Pentagon re
search chief said yesterday.
The Air Force is just beginning to test a first-generation
anti-satellite rocket that will be launched from F-15
fighter jets against low-orbiting satellites. That program
has been controversial, with some members of Congress ur
ging the administration not to prepare to fight war in
space.
Richard DcLauer. undersecretary of defense for research
and engineering, told the House Armed Services Commit
tee yesterday that the Pentagon is seeking $143 million for
continued development and initial procurement of the
first-generation weapon, flight-tested for the first time in
January.
"Ambitious tests are planned this year to demonstrate
the capability of the system." he said in a prepared state
ment.
