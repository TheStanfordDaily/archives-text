When Judy Lafferty
prepares for a race,
she checks every part
of her bike. '
Because she checks
her body the same ,
way, she discovered a ]
lump in her breast a 1
few years ago.
Sne discovered it ;
early. And these days,
85% of early breast (
cancers can be treated
successful ly.
Judy has since had i
reconstructive surgery,
too. And she feels I ike i
herself again. Alive,
vibrant, ready to get ■
on her bike and take <
on the world.
Judy Lafferty is liv- :
ing proof of the pro
gress we're making 1
against cancer.
The American
Cancer Society takes
some credit for that
progress. But credit
won't finance our
work.
We need your
money to help us win
this race.
