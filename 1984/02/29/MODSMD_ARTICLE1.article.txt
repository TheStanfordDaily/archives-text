# Mondale suffers Hart attack in New Hampshire

### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
With wire reports
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart upset former
Vice President Walter Mondale in yester
day's New Hampshire primary, raising doubts
about Mondale s previously undisputed
front-runner status and leaving six cither
ri\als far behind in the quest for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination.

Hart received 40 percent of the total vote
in this first primary, declaring, "Tonight we
buried the label 'darkhorse. 1 " Mondale
claimed second with 29 percent.
"Many people thought, including the
front-runner, that this campaign would be
over tonight," Hart said. "This campaign
just begins tonight."
The Hart victory will give his campaign a
big financial and morale boost, according to
Political Science Prof. Richard Brody.
"The main beneficiary will be Hart's bank

account," Brody said. "If he had not done
well (in New Hampshire), he would have been
in serious trouble."
Brody also said the early victory will "give
Hart the name recognition he needs."
Mondale remained confident, saying, "I
have won one, I have lost one. I am ready to
contest every primary." But since 1952, no
one has ever won the presidency without
winning his party primary in New Hampshire.
Ohio Sen. John Glenn finished a distant
third, with 13 percent of the total vote. His
decreasing popularity caused History Prof.
Barton Bernstein to note, "The Right Stuff
has turned out to be the wrong stuff."
Experts here said they feel that Glenn will
drop out of the race soon unless his campaign
revives.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson received 6 percent
of the total vote, followed by former South
Dakota Sen. George McGovern (5 percent),
South Carolina Sen. Ernest Hollings (4 per
cent), California Sen. Alan Cranston (2 per
cent) and former Florida Gov. Reuben
Askew (1 percent).
Experts here agreed that Cranston would
drop out of the race very soon, having failed
to gain adequate support in lowa and New
Hampshire. Askew and Hollings are expected

to remain in the running in the hopes of bet
ter showings in upcoming Southern prima
ries.
Hart's surprise New Hampshire victory is
definitely not representative of his current
national popularity, according to experts
here.
Hart continues to succeed in bolstering his
chances, promoting himself as the "new
politics" candidate. And an unexpected
second-place finish in the lowa caucus last
week undoubtedly aided his campaign.
Experts here said voters previously sup
porting the Democratic candidates who did
not fare well in lowa switched allegiances to
Hart once they saw that he was Mondale's
clear contender.
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
said percentages indicate that numerous
Mondale supporters as well shifted to Hart
in New Hampshire.
Does the New Hampshire victory show
that Hart is capable of overcoming a front
runner far ahead in national polls and enjoy
ing an early 100-delegate lead?
"I would be shocked if Mondale did not
win," Bernstein said. "He has better organi
zation. more money and (a very favorable)
poll position."

"Hart simply does not have any organiza
tion at all in a number of states." said Mar
shall. Thus. Mart stands little chance of
succeeding in the upcoming primaries in
Southern states, he said.
Brody seemed to disagree. "What (Hart)'s
doing is putting up a pink cloud, and people
are seeing what they want to see. . . .There's
no reason that vagueness won't work down
South."
New Hampshire voters are "more closely
focused 011 these candidates" than are other
voters throughout the nation, and might
thus prove more indicative of upcoming pri
maries than expected. Brody said.
Mondale vowed yesterday to "redouble his
efforts" in the upcoming months.
He will probably change his campaign
focus, which Bernstein described as "having
moved more to the center, as if lie were run
ning for election rather than nomination."
Jeff Phillips, a leader of Stanford's Stu
dents with Hart, agreed that after New
Hampshire, Mondale would be forced to
change his tact. "Now he can no longer cam
paign on the basis of being the only can
didate who can be elected." Phillips said.
"He'll have to campaign as the best can
didate."
