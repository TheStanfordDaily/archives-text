## The
						Stanford Daily A
						matter of public health 
### 
The revelation last week that the drinking
water of the Stanford community is un
fluoridated came as a surprise to many people.
With better communication, however, the
surprise could have been avoided.
For the past year, a breakdown in the Univer
sity's fluoridation system has left the water
untreated, a fact unknown to those who drink
the water each day. It was not until a nurse
from Cowell Student Health Center happened
to stumble upon the situation that it became
public.
In a case where the health of the community
is concerned, the University should take the re
sponsibility and alert residents. This could be
done easily enough either bv mailing out flyers
or writing a press release for distribution to
University and local publications.
Not only would such a move have made Uni
versity residents aware of the change in their
drinking water, it would have improved relations

with the community. One is now kit to wonder
how long it will take the University to notify
residents should a similar situation occur Ac
tion should be taken before rumors need to be
confirmed or squelched bv the University's De
partment of Health and Safety.
T he prospect of such future action seenv
promising. University President Donald Ken
nedy admits to being "embarrassed and ;i little
sore" about the incident. He insisted in a state
ment to homeowners Monday that the Univer
sity will do everything possible to avoid a similai
situation in the future.
Nevertheless, the community was denied in
formation about a potentially dangerous health
situation. Witholding information about some
thing which concerns the health ol the public is
a bad precedent to set and can only lead to the
erosion of the University's relationship with the
community.
