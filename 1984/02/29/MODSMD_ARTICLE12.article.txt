# Dear mom and dad: A letter home

Dear Mom and Dad.
Sometimes it gets kinda scary living in this
world of ours. And I don't mean so much the
fright caused by the bleak prospects of finding a
nice, enjoyable, high-paying job in a safe, secure
neighborhood fit to raise 2.3 kids, two cars and a
Macintosh computer. And it's not so much the
frightening reality of reality: That, yes Virginia,
there is real world out there and you have to go
out and face it. And no, no, it's not the loneli
ness that will soon greet me when 1 leave friends
and family for that trip into the real world; I fig
ure that, although being alone is quickly becom
ing a social curse of damnation, each one of us
spends most of our lives alone. So no big deal,
right? Besides, I can always buy a TV and just
leave it on like most good Americans. Don't
worry, 1 won't actually watch and have my mind
vacuumed clean of intelligence. I'll just put it on
so as to give myself the illusion that somehow
I'm connected with the rest of the world, blindly
believing it to be all happy and pleasant, just like
"Three's Company" reruns.

And yet, after the smoke had cleared from the intial hursts of
moral indignation and 'we won't stand for it-ism/ people
returned to their daily routines and resumed their mundane
bitching about their steak being overcooked> about the rising
price of Walkman stereos and about the greasiness oi their lates
Domino's pizza.

Maybe my lenses are clouded by the lact that
I'm still here at Stanford — a place seemingly
governed b\ the maxim of self-aggrandizement
and populated exclusively by those more inter
ested in personal achievement over personal
relationships. To he fair, most of the people here
arc good people, but like the old saying, it only
takes a few bad apples. But 1 wonder il the real
world is as ignorant and apathetic as 1 make it
out to be. Maybe I'm just seeing too much Stan
fordia and am imputing it on the world — but
why do 1 think I'm not?
Here's why: Things happen in the world that
people hear about but do nothing about. They'll
say it was a bad thing, but they won't care
enough to act.
For example, in my last column, 1 tried to take
a dispassionate look at the Middle East situa
tion. Unfortunately, the editors lett out part ol
my column, a part that dealt with the massacres
of Palestinian refugees in the Shatila and Sabre
camps during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in
1952. I'll bet you didn't know that the New York
Times reported that the Israeli Command
received, on the first day of the killing, a
cablegram from the Phalange officer in charge ol
the massacres that read: "To this time we have

killed 300 civilians and terrorists." All this
amid Israel: cries of innocence. To boot, the
Phalangists were ordered into the camps by an Is
raeli general, apparently acting on higher orders.
If the Israelis were not involved in this thing,
then why did the Phalange bother to gi\e the Is
raelis what amounted to a progress report? Why
did the massacres continue for two more d:i\s
without an Israeli attempt to stop them?
This whole affair was very well-publicized.
People read about it. They heard about it. They
knew about it. And yet. after the smoke had cleared
from the initial bursts of moral indignation and
"we won't stand for it-ism," people returned to
their daily routines and resumed their mundane
bitching about their steak being overcooked,
about the rising price of Walkman stereos and
about the greasincss of the latest Domino's
pizza. Everybody said that the massacres were
horrible, but nothing was done about it Hie
United States continued to supply Israel with
arms. Everybody just quietly buried the dead in
their minds and conveniently and comfortably

forgot about the whole attair.
And what about more recent events'.' I or ex
ample, the United States tested an anti-satellite
weapon (ASAT) a month or so ago. and the news
passed with barely a whisper. It didn't mean
anything to people. They didn t rcali/e that this
is one of the most destabilizing developments
ever in the nuclear standoff.
ASATs. by attacking and knock.ng out early
warning and other inhumation gathering
satellites, leave a country blind 'and suspicious,
nervous and reactive. In a crisis situation, use ol
ASATs indicates either that: first, a nation
wants to prevent an attack on itsell by blinding
the satellites that would inform the aggressor of
the success of the attack or ol the need lor an
other; or second, that a nation has launched a
pre-emptive strike and wants the other to be
oblivious to the coming doom. A nation could use
ASATs for a defensive purpose while the other
nation could only assume that the purpose was
offensive. The nation attacked by ASA Is could
only choose to launch what it thought to be a
counterstrike but what was in fact an opening
blow.
Too few people know what ASATs are, much

less what they mean. Accordingly, too few care.
Therefore, too few work to help the problem,
and too many unknowingly accept it. We. as indi
viduals. no longer control the events which af
fect, even dictate the substance of our lives.
Rather, we are affected by decisions made by
others, by events no one person controls.
And what about the crazy, harebrained idea
that Reagan is pushing on us about building
George Lucasesque ballistic missile defense
(BMD)? Feu know about the amount of money
and research we're Hushing in the name of BMD.
and fewer know what it all means.
BMD is ;i bad idea. Deployment of BMD would
cause a new and worse round in the arms race —
in offensive as well as defensive weapons. The su
perpowers would have to figure that il there's a
defense, they gotta have more offense to be able
to penetrate that defense and threaten the
enemy as much as lie threatens you and thus keep
deterrence healthy. More offensive weapons
mean increased and needless defense expendi
tures sucking money away from social programs.
They also mean more triggers with which to start
an accidental nuclear war.
Moreover, what if a nation has BMD and the
othei doesn't? The disadvantaged one might feel
compelled to launch while it could, before the
other could launch with impunity or coerce
* tree I \ ( iisllv. I3MD can never expect to lie 100
percent effective not only because there are so
manv easv and cheap eountermeasures available
to the offense, but also because the technology
for 100 percent simply does not exist.
Without 100 percent effectiveness, and given
the tendency of nuclear bombs to make big ex
plosions. BMD is pointless. How many realize
this? How many care — and what's more, how
many care enough to take the time to try to take
part in the decisions and events that define and
shape their lives?
I guess my whole point is that it's kinda scary
liv ing in a world that recognizes so many horrible
things and sees so many disturbing events take
place, all with at best a muted and transient mur
mur.
Well. I don't know. I think I'm going a bit off
the philosophical deep end here. As I read back
over it. this is some pretty off-the-wall stuff.
Anywav. there's a stupid leak in between the
walls that allows water to drip kindly, and it's
been driving me erazv! Because of it. I didn't get
much sleep last night. I've got some studying to
do still. 1 guess it's time for me, like everybody
else, to return to the mundane problems again.

there is real world out there and you have to go
out and face it. And no, no, it's not the loneli
ness that will soon greet me when 1 leave friends
and family for that trip into the real world; I fig
ure that, although being alone is quickly becom
ing a social curse of damnation, each one of us
spends most of our lives alone. So no big deal,
right? Besides, I can always buy a TV and just
leave it on like most good Americans. Don't
worry, 1 won't actually watch and have my mind
vacuumed clean of intelligence. I'll just put it on
so as to give myself the illusion that somehow
I'm connected with the rest of the world, blindly
believing it to be all happy and pleasant, just like
"Three's Company" reruns.

And yet, after the smoke had cleared from the intial hursts of
moral indignation and 'we won't stand for it-ism/ people
returned to their daily routines and resumed their mundane
bitching about their steak being overcooked> about the rising
price of Walkman stereos and about the greasiness oi their lates
Domino's pizza.

Maybe my lenses are clouded by the lact that
I'm still here at Stanford — a place seemingly
governed b\ the maxim of self-aggrandizement
and populated exclusively by those more inter
ested in personal achievement over personal
relationships. To he fair, most of the people here
arc good people, but like the old saying, it only
takes a few bad apples. But 1 wonder il the real
world is as ignorant and apathetic as 1 make it
out to be. Maybe I'm just seeing too much Stan
fordia and am imputing it on the world — but
why do 1 think I'm not?
Here's why: Things happen in the world that
people hear about but do nothing about. They'll
say it was a bad thing, but they won't care
enough to act.
For example, in my last column, 1 tried to take
a dispassionate look at the Middle East situa
tion. Unfortunately, the editors lett out part ol
my column, a part that dealt with the massacres
of Palestinian refugees in the Shatila and Sabre
camps during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in
1952. I'll bet you didn't know that the New York
Times reported that the Israeli Command
received, on the first day of the killing, a
cablegram from the Phalange officer in charge ol
the massacres that read: "To this time we have

killed 300 civilians and terrorists." All this
amid Israel: cries of innocence. To boot, the
Phalangists were ordered into the camps by an Is
raeli general, apparently acting on higher orders.
If the Israelis were not involved in this thing,
then why did the Phalange bother to gi\e the Is
raelis what amounted to a progress report? Why
did the massacres continue for two more d:i\s
without an Israeli attempt to stop them?
This whole affair was very well-publicized.
People read about it. They heard about it. They
knew about it. And yet. after the smoke had cleared
from the initial bursts of moral indignation and
"we won't stand for it-ism," people returned to
their daily routines and resumed their mundane
bitching about their steak being overcooked,
about the rising price of Walkman stereos and
about the greasincss of the latest Domino's
pizza. Everybody said that the massacres were
horrible, but nothing was done about it Hie
United States continued to supply Israel with
arms. Everybody just quietly buried the dead in
their minds and conveniently and comfortably

forgot about the whole attair.
And what about more recent events'.' I or ex
ample, the United States tested an anti-satellite
weapon (ASAT) a month or so ago. and the news
passed with barely a whisper. It didn't mean
anything to people. They didn t rcali/e that this
is one of the most destabilizing developments
ever in the nuclear standoff.
ASATs. by attacking and knock.ng out early
warning and other inhumation gathering
satellites, leave a country blind 'and suspicious,
nervous and reactive. In a crisis situation, use ol
ASATs indicates either that: first, a nation
wants to prevent an attack on itsell by blinding
the satellites that would inform the aggressor of
the success of the attack or ol the need lor an
other; or second, that a nation has launched a
pre-emptive strike and wants the other to be
oblivious to the coming doom. A nation could use
ASATs for a defensive purpose while the other
nation could only assume that the purpose was
offensive. The nation attacked by ASA Is could
only choose to launch what it thought to be a
counterstrike but what was in fact an opening
blow.
Too few people know what ASATs are, much

less what they mean. Accordingly, too few care.
Therefore, too few work to help the problem,
and too many unknowingly accept it. We. as indi
viduals. no longer control the events which af
fect, even dictate the substance of our lives.
Rather, we are affected by decisions made by
others, by events no one person controls.
And what about the crazy, harebrained idea
that Reagan is pushing on us about building
George Lucasesque ballistic missile defense
(BMD)? Feu know about the amount of money
and research we're Hushing in the name of BMD.
and fewer know what it all means.
BMD is ;i bad idea. Deployment of BMD would
cause a new and worse round in the arms race —
in offensive as well as defensive weapons. The su
perpowers would have to figure that il there's a
defense, they gotta have more offense to be able
to penetrate that defense and threaten the
enemy as much as lie threatens you and thus keep
deterrence healthy. More offensive weapons
mean increased and needless defense expendi
tures sucking money away from social programs.
They also mean more triggers with which to start
an accidental nuclear war.
Moreover, what if a nation has BMD and the
othei doesn't? The disadvantaged one might feel
compelled to launch while it could, before the
other could launch with impunity or coerce
* tree I \ ( iisllv. I3MD can never expect to lie 100
percent effective not only because there are so
manv easv and cheap eountermeasures available
to the offense, but also because the technology
for 100 percent simply does not exist.
Without 100 percent effectiveness, and given
the tendency of nuclear bombs to make big ex
plosions. BMD is pointless. How many realize
this? How many care — and what's more, how
many care enough to take the time to try to take
part in the decisions and events that define and
shape their lives?
I guess my whole point is that it's kinda scary
liv ing in a world that recognizes so many horrible
things and sees so many disturbing events take
place, all with at best a muted and transient mur
mur.
Well. I don't know. I think I'm going a bit off
the philosophical deep end here. As I read back
over it. this is some pretty off-the-wall stuff.
Anywav. there's a stupid leak in between the
walls that allows water to drip kindly, and it's
been driving me erazv! Because of it. I didn't get
much sleep last night. I've got some studying to
do still. 1 guess it's time for me, like everybody
else, to return to the mundane problems again.
