## Manley and Rebholz have too much idle time 
### 
Ihe controversy seems unending as
regards the relationship between the
Hoover Institution and Stanford
Univeisitv. Professors Rebhol/ and
Manlev appear unbending in their
efforts to maintain pressure on
both the University president and
the Board of Trustees. Their efforts
serve no purpose at this point other
than to obtain publieity for them
selves.
I wonder il the solution to their
protraeted dilemma might really rest
in the hands of their respeetive
deans and not in the Office of the
Universit\ President. The answer to
the problem ereated by these two
academicians is simple. They should
be put to work in the classroom
which, after all, is what they were
hired to do in the first place.
Come on deans, it is obvious that
these two professors have too much
idle time on their hands.

Arrogant review
If Steve Vineberg "usually avoids"
reviewing Fellini's films because he
"doesn't care" for what the director
has been shooting in the last 23
years, he had probably better stick
to his words and avoid writing about
films at all. Mis article on the latest
Fellini film, "And the ship sailed
on." (Daily, Feb. 23). smacks of
undeserved pompousness and ig
norant arrogance. His concessions
that the movie is boring, but only in
a "lulling, inoffensive way," simply
show a presumptuous incapability to
see beyond a certain level.
Now, I don't pretend to give the
truth on the subject, for I am no
film critic: il I did. I would tail into
Vineberg's very mistake. However, I
would like to suggest a lew themes
which may cause him to review his
declaration about the "banalities
about how the vessel is a microcosm
of the world."
l et the deceased singer represent
a world in the process of extinction.
I lie new world is left to gaze upon
what is passed, to consider itself
against a previous time. There is a

sudden realization that the period
which is to come is full of new
menaces and dangers we were not
used to: a realization that the past
world, lor all its faults, had still a
genuineness about it that the pres
ent is losing. Place this interpreta
tion in the context of Europe in the
period immediately preceding the
Great War: an atmosphere of
profound tension among all nations
of the significant world, where any
pretext will he enough to trigger off
a major conflict.
I am glad to see that at least
Vineberg has the humility to ac
knowledge the marvelous imagina
tion and skill with which Fellini
carries out his intent; hut to say
that the first scene of the movie
condenses it all. well, it sounds
pretty gross.

We appreciate Chad Balch's
recent letter ( Daily, Feb. 3) charac
terizing our recent column, " I larvard
students: A bottle of whine," as "a
brilliant piece of satire by two Har
vard students about a recent survey
by U.S. News and World Report in
which 47.6 percent of college presi
dents named Harvard as a ranking
undergraduate institution." We also
note a lengthy viewpoint (Jan. 31)
by Stanford undergraduates Agar
and Nagareda caricaturing us as
snobbish, arrogant, ignorant and
assorted other nasty things.
Balch's letter, however brilliant
and perceptive, misses the point by
expressing "surprise" at Agar and
Nagareda"s "criticism of the Crim
son reprint as il it were a serious
opinion." We meant every word of
it. Actually, Agar and Nagareda err
only in supposing we were wrong.
And in case Agar and Nagareda
are wondering, we weren't rejected
by Stanford. But then, you probably
know that.
