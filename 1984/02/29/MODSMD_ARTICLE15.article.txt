## Daily editorial board has an anti-Reagan bias 
### 
The Stanford Daily's editorials have shown a
not-so-surprising consistency in their discussions
of President Reagan's policies. The aforemen
tioned consistency is not their disagreement
toward his policies but their hostility toward
Reagan himself.
The problem is not unfamiliar. Politics can of
ten breed contempt for an elected official. II
mam or most of a politician's ideas are frowned
upon, dislike of the politician makes all of his
policies unappealing.

VIEWPOINT

While leading our campus paper, one begins to
wonder whether such an attitude possesses I he
Dailv's editorial board with respect to Reagan.
Reagan has been portrayed as a b-a-a-a-d man.
For example, he is entirely politically motivated.
!t is not for us to say whether he is i>i not. but
then again. The Daily editorial board apparently
knows him well enough to state their verdict. Its
ideas are well-documented in works such as
"Jackson to the rescue." (Jan. 10). " I he new
look." (Jan. 24). "A missed opportunity.' (Feb.
13) and "Reagan's magic show'" (l eb. Ift).
In "Jackson to the rescue. I lie Daily writes
that "Jackson's trip cannot be seen primarily as
an attempt to boost a lagging campaign." Vet
the same article fails to omit a political label
from Reagan's simple gesture ol ' thanks." —
Reagan's hcartv congratulations to lackson and
welcome to Cioodman wcie smart political
oio\ t \.
I'ln- si' ul cited editorial discussed Keauan s

call for a "new policy of credible deterrence,
peaceful competition and constructive coopera
tion with Moscow in order to establish a better
working relationship." The editorial board knew
Reagan, though, and triumphantly declared "we
don't buy it."
And then there is last Monday s editorial
criticizing Reagan's decision not to attend
Andropov's funeral. The article talked of
Reagan's message to Moscow and his failure to
"follow through." It did not talk ol the political
reasons why Reagan might not want to attend
the funeral. That most ol his diplomatic advisers
and consultants opposed the trip oi that he
might not have been entirely welcomed by the
Soviets seemed irrelevant. The editorial did men
tion Reagan's scheduled meeting with Egyptian
President Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein. It
also said that it could have been rescheduled.
Why? So the President could "impress upon tile-
Soviet Union and the rest ol the world his
desire" for cooperation. Given its attitude, we
wonder it the editorial board would have declared
Reagan's attendence ol the Andropov funeral
only an election-year ploy.
The last-cited editorial. "Reagan's magic
show." talked about "the president's ability to
extricate himself from potentially dangerous po
litical situation without losing points with
American voters." In some circles, that ability
might be regarded as adept handling ol sensitive
situations. (Von know, like not overdoing retalia
tions when the Soviet I nion destroyed a civilian
jet airliner killing ill aboard.) To I he Daily's edi
torial board, that's handling American voters.
I lie board, however, lias published at least two

editorials supporting certain Reagan administra
tion policies: "Sino-American potential" (Jan.
30) and "Launch weightless lab" (Feb. 2). The ar
ticles avoided personal remarks concerning the
president. Comments such as "Jackson showed
it/)' the president by rescuing Goodman when
Reagan couldn't," "Reagan has shown that he
cannot deal constructively with the Soviets,"
"Reagan may be earning a reputation for missing
I uncials." and "Reagan didn't follow through"
were replaced by less personal lines like "President
Reagan s warm policies towards the People's
Republic" and"it would be misguided for the
Reagan administration" to ignore the Chinese
government . . We're not against using the sub
ject phrase "Reagan," but rather the personal
attacks I he Daily's editorials seem to entail.
l ast Wednesday, the Daily attacked the Wall
Street Journal for "its right-wing wrath on this
I ni\ersity through its editorial page." They later
staled that "We (the editorial board) certainly
don't object to anyone criticizing Stanford — so
long as such criticism is leveled in an accurate and
responsible manner." We agree. Editorials should
state their case in an accurate and responsible
manner. Unfortunately, the board doesn't seem
to practice what they preach. Who knows? Presi
dent Reagan may not be the inept, anachronistic,
war-mongering, totally politically minded man
I lie Daily editorial board makes him out to be. In
any case, we urge the board to refrain from "we
all-know-him-too-wcll-to-buy-it" judgments and
ask that they critique Reagan's policies rather
than Reagan, the man.

Reagan's attendence ol the Andropov funeral
only an election-year ploy.
The last-cited editorial. "Reagan's magic
show." talked about "the president's ability to
extricate himself from potentially dangerous po
litical situation without losing points with
American voters." In some circles, that ability
might be regarded as adept handling ol sensitive
situations. (Von know, like not overdoing retalia
tions when the Soviet I nion destroyed a civilian
jet airliner killing ill aboard.) To I he Daily's edi
torial board, that's handling American voters.
I lie board, however, lias published at least two

editorials supporting certain Reagan administra
tion policies: "Sino-American potential" (Jan.
30) and "Launch weightless lab" (Feb. 2). The ar
ticles avoided personal remarks concerning the
president. Comments such as "Jackson showed
it/)' the president by rescuing Goodman when
Reagan couldn't," "Reagan has shown that he
cannot deal constructively with the Soviets,"
"Reagan may be earning a reputation for missing
I uncials." and "Reagan didn't follow through"
were replaced by less personal lines like "President
Reagan s warm policies towards the People's
Republic" and"it would be misguided for the
Reagan administration" to ignore the Chinese
government . . We're not against using the sub
ject phrase "Reagan," but rather the personal
attacks I he Daily's editorials seem to entail.
l ast Wednesday, the Daily attacked the Wall
Street Journal for "its right-wing wrath on this
I ni\ersity through its editorial page." They later
staled that "We (the editorial board) certainly
don't object to anyone criticizing Stanford — so
long as such criticism is leveled in an accurate and
responsible manner." We agree. Editorials should
state their case in an accurate and responsible
manner. Unfortunately, the board doesn't seem
to practice what they preach. Who knows? Presi
dent Reagan may not be the inept, anachronistic,
war-mongering, totally politically minded man
I lie Daily editorial board makes him out to be. In
any case, we urge the board to refrain from "we
all-know-him-too-wcll-to-buy-it" judgments and
ask that they critique Reagan's policies rather
than Reagan, the man.
