## Students play the game of high finance— for real 
### DAVID FURTH 
It is often said that a college education is
too removed from reality and does not pro
vide enough practical experience. For stu
dents participating in the Blyth Fund,
though, there is no shortage of hands-on
practice and participation.
Established at Stanford in 1979, The
( harles R. Blyth Fund affords Stanford stu
dents who are interested in business and
finance the opportunity to make some
money and gain valuable educational experi
ence as well.
The $75,000 fund was originally set up at
Occidental College at the beginning of 1977.
in honor of Blyth, a successful California
financier.
The charter of the fund states that the
intention of the organization is to "provide
an educational experience to a group of stu
dents interested in finance and investments
and to broaden the interest in finance."
As stipulated by the charter, the fund is
managed entirely by students who serve 011
the board of directors. There are 1 1 direc

tors — including a president, vice president,
secretary, treasurer and six alternate direc
tors — who serve a one year term.
At the end of each year, which runs from
April to March, new directors are chosen for
the board.
All Stanford students are eligible to apply
for a position 011 the board. Directors are
chosen, jointly, by the president of the fund,
the dean of student affairs and a member of
the ANSIJ selection committee. The selec
tion process involves an application and
later, an interview with the strongest candi
dates.
The fund stresses that "commitment and
interest in learning how to manage invest
ments will weigh equally with experience in
the selection ol board members. Ine ooard,
therefore, is balanced by members who have
experience in investment and members who
have 110 experience but do have a desire to
learn.

The board meets twice a week to discuss
the status of present investments and also

to cvitemplate new investment possibilities
which are presented by individual board
members. Directors are expected to research
stocks and follow the economy on their own
time.

tions. invest the fund's existing capital

valued at approximately $65,000 as of
Feb. 15 — in stocks, bonds, options and
money market funds. Their current
portfolio contains a full range of diversified
investments Irom IBM to Silverado Mines.
According to Robert Lisbonne, a current
board member, the fund follows a strategy
in which it tries to "select a portfolio of se

curities that is diversified so that there is no
unique interest in a particular area." He
leels that this strategy minimi/es risk — al
though 110 one is held responsible for losses,
l.isbonne added. "Bonds are desirable be
cause they provide a lot ol income Irom the
high dividends they produce."

All profits, dividends and interest realized
during the year are allocated in the following
manner: Part goes toward covering the
board's expenses, part is added to the lund
and part is donated to Stanford.
Profits and losses vary from year to year,
but the capital has, on average, remained at
about its initial level. One might think that

savvy Stanford students should be making a
killing on the stock market, hut it is not
that easy.
Usbonne points to the length ot the term
that board members ser\e as one reason tor
me lack ot profits. "Because each term is
only one year, board members usually don't
propose long-term investments." lie ex
plained.
On the other hand, the fund has managed
to hold on to the money with which they
started. "The board hasn't lost because
people tend to have a high degree of respon
sibility over the assets — members are con
servative," said Usbonne.
Usbonne has found his experience as a
board member very satisfying. "I like the
time I put in because we talk about the
stock market and the economy, things I am
unable to talk about elsewhere at Stanford
such as in classes or other activities. I have
learned a lot having had the opportunity to
invest $75,000 of real money even though
it's not mine — it's real and you have a
feeling of responsibility." he said.
