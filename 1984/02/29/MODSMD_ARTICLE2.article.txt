# CIA presence fuels student discontent

### LISA LYNCH Senior Staff writer 
The Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) is coming to Stanford to
recruit today, but its appearance
here will attract more than future
federal agents.
The Democratic Socialists of
America (DSA) and the Stanford
Central American Action Network
(SCAAN) are planning to protest
the ClA's recruitment drive at
Tresidder Union by distributing
leaflets criticizing the CIA and pos
sibly bv picketing the recruitment
drive.
The Gay and Lesbian Law Stu
dents Association (GLLSA) has also
criticised llie University lor allowing
the CIA, a group which they claim
discriminates against homosexuals,
to recruit on campus.
Scott Sommers of DSA and Scott
Otteman of SCAAN said that their
groups' objections to the CIA visit
stem mainly from "concern" about
the ClA's present and past activities,
especially current CIA involvement
in Nicaragua.
"As we see it," said Otteman.
"the CIA is responsible for the loss
of 1000 lives in Nicaragua, many of
those innocent women and children.
"It seems to me that ten years ago
the CIA would never have thought
to come to a college campus like
this," Otteman said. "Why should
they do it now?"
Sommers said, "We saw all of the

full-page [Daily ads and decided we
had to voice our opinions."
SCAAN and DSA, which met yes
terday evening, plan to distribute
leaflets, hold an organizational
meeting at noon today and possibly
picket Tresidder during the briefing
sessions. In addition, DSA member
Jill Rhodes said volunteers would be
present during the ClA's public in
formation sessions today to ask
questions about CIA activities.
Yesterday the GLLSA submitted
a letter to The Daily criticizing the
University for allowing the CIA to
recruit on campus.
The letter states, "By lending its
facilities for the recruitment of new
members o 1 this corps of upstanding
moral guardians, Stanford University
cannot escape complicity in the per
petuation of this kind of invidious
discrimination."
The letter also states that "many
academic institutions, including law
schools at Harvard and Berkeley,
have refused to lend institutional
support to employers who cannot
consider job applicants on their indi
vidual merits and talents without
regard to arbitrary and irrational
criteria."
GLLSA member Martin Koloski
said his group is considering ap
proaching professors at the Law
School to get information about for
mulating University restrictions on
recruiters who practice dis
criminatory policies.
The Law School is currently the
only part of the University to have
adopted an explicit non
discrimination policy on "sexual ori
entation" in admissions.
Koloski said federal agencies as a
rule have "security clearances" and
that as far as he knew, the security
clearance of both the military and
the CIA were explicity intolerant of

homosexuals and homosexual activ
ity.
"I'm not sure of the exact seman
tics." he said.
When asked about the ClA's hiring
practices, CIA Recruiting Director
Bill Cooley said he would make 110
comment about the homosexuality
issue, but added, "Anyone can ap
ply."
At the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC). there seems to
be little concern about the CIA
protests. CPPC Director Christopher
Shinkman said he was not sure how
many students the recruiters would
attract. "People don't come in very

often to solicit CIA applications."
he said.
Cooley said he expects a large turn
out.
"We've never held a recruiting ses
sion like this here." he said, "but we
held one similar to this at MIT
(Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology) in the fall and the response
was very good. I think we can expect
a large turnout."
Both SCAAN and DSA organized
their protests rather quickly; Ot
teman of SCAAN said that the deci
sion to protest was made Monday.
"Any coalition here will be purely
defacto." Rhodes said.
