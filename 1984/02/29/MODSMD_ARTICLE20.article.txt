# Leaping for one extra day
## 
### 
Los Angeles AP — For
Evelena and David Lane of
Long Beach, it is a fourth
coming event. Spelled just that
way, and about time it got
here.
Today, you may have
noticed, is the 29th of
February. For you, it may mean
a 24-hour reprieve before the
first-of-the-month bills.
For the Lanes and others like
them, the leap day means they
get to observe a genuine wed
ding anniversary.
They could have chosen any
of the other 1460 days during
the quadrcnnium. but*they said
"1 do" on Feb. 29, 1980. '
"So up until now, we cele
brated our anniversary on the
28111,'" she explained.
In the case of Joyce Uslaner
of Los Angeles, the solution is
not that cut and dried. She was
born Feb. 29, 1928.
"In years other than leap
years, my husband always says
that 1 should observe the

birthday on March 1, since I
was born the day after the
2Kth." she said. "1 insist the
28th is the proper day. So we
compromise and celebrate the
entire week."
Actually, as she pointed out.
there could be legal implica
tions. "What date does the So
cial Security Administration
consider that I will have
reached age 65?"
Life is full of unanswered
questions, but this one has an
explanation. A call to the So
cial Security people in Wash
ington brought this response
from spokesman Phil Gambino:
"For benefit purposes, you
are deemed to have attained
your age on the day before
your actual birthday.
"This,has a basis in English
common law. You have com
pleted 365 days before your
birthday. There are other
agencies that use the same
yardstick."
In the comic opera "The

Pirates of Penzance" by Gil
bert and Sullivan, this legal
point is of no use to Frederic,
the pirate apprentice who was
born on leap day. Not only was
Frederic meant by his father to
be a pilot (his nursemaid was a
bit deaf), but when the son
seeks release from his contract
as an apprentice after 21 years
of his life, the technicality is
raised that he has had only five
birthdays.
You think this discussion of
leap year isn't a shadow-caster?
Consider an economic implica
tion:
"That one extra day means
that there will be 54,500 addi
tional visitors here," said Lori
Miller of the Greater Los An
geles Visitors & Convention
Bureau. "'This will mean an es
timated $10 million in extra
revenue."
Every silver lining, however,
has a cloud. Workers on annual
salaries put in an extra day.
