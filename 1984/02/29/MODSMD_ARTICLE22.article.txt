# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM

### TIM GRIEVE 
USC and party police
You may remember the story in the last
installment of Campus Compendium about
the USC party that didn't break up until
do/ens of university security workers,
police squads and a helicopter were called
in.
The Daily Trojan reported last week
that USC has suspended one fraternity,
placed another on probation, issued warn
ings to three more but cleared another of
any wrongdoing in the aftermath of the
Jan. 27 party.
Calling the party an "unlawful assem
bly." university officials suspended for frO
days the USC chapter of the Kappa Alpha
fraternity for interfering with police at
tempts to clear USCs fraternity row.
The president of Phi Gamma Delta, the
fraternity placed on probation for
"harassing police officers with obscene
comments" and because "projectiles were
thrown from the area of the fraternity
house," said his organization was "a victim
of circumstance."
"I think IFC (Inter-Fraternity Council)
is looking for something to bust us on." he
said. "They could have overlooked this, hut
because of our past record and our image as
an 'Animal House,' we get probation."
But USC officials tell a different story.
"The university considers the altercation
with I.APD and our own university security
to be extremely severe," an official said.
"We cannot and will not condone
deliberate disrespect and interference with
law enforcement officers who are trving to
perform their duty."
All the fraternities involved in the inci

dent will be required to write letters of
apology to the I.os Angeles Police Depart
ment and to invite police officers to dinner
to discuss the incident.
Amherst boots frats
Administrators at Amherst College have
found one way to deal with fraternity
problems; they announced earlier this
month that all Amherst fraternities will be
closed in June.

The decision came after months of
protests, sit-ins and even a hunger strike
by Amherst students. But the Amherst
Board of Trustees voted earlier this month
that the fraternities create an anti
intellectual atmosphere and are too
selective to continue at Amherst, the na
tion's most selective college.

Predictably, students at Amherst aren't
particularly pleased with the new situation.
One student, a member of Amherst's
Delta C'lii Psi fraternity, explained that
fraternities at \mherst are co-ed and non
selective. in that anv student who rushes is
guaranteed .1 spot in a liaternitv.
I ntil \nihcrst bought all the fraternity
houses a lew years ago. the buildings were
owned by national fraternities. Now Am
herst will probably convert the fraternity
houses to dorms, "institutionalizing them
and making them more like dorms and less
like fraternities." the student said.
1 he \lllhcrst Board ol Trustees has also
implemented a new policy requiring all Am
herst students to live on campus, thereby
preventing groups from moving off campus
to start their own fraternities.
111 exchange tor the closing ol the frater
nities. Amherst administrators have
promised the students a new student cen
ter. But. the students sav. that center
won't be built for some time, leaving
campus social lite "pretty vacant for the
next couple of vears."
I he fraternities have exhausted all
means ot official appeal. Asked about the
possibility ol some sort ol unofficial ap
peal. one student said. "II you're talking
about retaliatory action a la Animal
House, that hasn't happened here. It won't
happen here."
This one will kill you
Killing is "in" at college campuses
throughout the East. Following in the
footsteps of James Bond and Dirty Harry,
college students at Duke, Princeton, Wil
liams and a mess of other Eastern schools
have taken to playing a game called
"Assassin."
According to The Daily Princetonian,
each player in Assassin is assigned a
"target" whom he must "kill" with a squirt
gun with no more than one witness to the
crime.
If an assassin is successful in killing his
first target, he is then assigned his target's
target, and the game continues until only
one player is left. There are usually prizes
for the person with the most kills and for
the last person left alive.
Administrators at Princeton threatened
to ban the game 011 campus, but decided
against the move, saying there wasn't
enough evidence that the game put stu
dents in physical danger. However. Prince
toil officials maintain they are morally
opposed to the game.
"Assassin is a game that takes very
lightly what is in fact a very serious mat
ter." one Princeton administrator said. "It
encourages insensitiv ity to a violent soci

ety in much the same way that violence on
1\ does, and we telt that it would be inap
propriate for the university to lend even
tacit approval."
However. Assassin players disagree that
the game is a problem. " I think the game is
basically harmless and that people's atti
tudes toward killing will not be changed In
it at this age." one Assassin lan told The
Diiilv Princetonian. "We can understand
the university's viewpoint, but I think that
most people here arc mature enough to
reali/e that the whole point of Assassin is
that it's lots ot lun."
No dancing allowed
A recent probe at Seaver College, part
of Pepperdine University. has revealed
that dancing in the aisles at a concert In
I lie Busbovs there did not eonsitute
"social dancing." which would have violated
university regulations there.

According to student body president Liz
Whatley, Pepperdine is a Church of Christ
college and does not allow "social dancing."
"The school's not against dancing perse"
she said. "They're just kind of worried
about what could go along with the dancing
â€” like alcohol."
Pepperdine also does not allow drinking
on campus, Whatley said. "We don't have
alcohol on campus and there's no drinking
in the dorms. At the off-campus dances we
have, some people drink before hand, but
we don't have rules against that."
Whatley said Seaver has had six or seven
"very successful" dances this year off
campus, where social dancing is permitted.
Send mice to college
Students at Eastern Illinois University in
Charleston are working to send mice to col
lege.
With an 87 cent donation to help find a

cure tor cancer, students can "send a mouse
to college" to become a subject of animal
research.
The donations are put in envelopes and
placed m a "mouse droppings box" at the
main desk of residence halls.
Organizers hope to raise $1000 for the
American Cancer Society. Last year's fund
raiser brought in $NOO.
It beats Ft. Lauderdale
Michigan Daily columnist David Spak has
some alternatives to the standard Ft.
Lauderdale spring break trips:
"What could be better than Moscow this
time of year? President Ronald Reagan
bleu his chance to party with the finest
from Moscow to Montreal, why should
you? Think of all the heavy hitters you
could have rubbed elbows with. . . . Moscow
is always at its best during state occasions.
The government throws a wonderful mili
tary parade or funeral. Imagine what the
cocktail parties must be like. Caviar and
vodka in the land that invented them.
"Now that the Marines are leaving
Beirut, the crowds won't be a problem.
Many open-air hotel rooms are available all
over the city and you can pick your faction
by crossing the street. It might be nice to
pay a visit to Amin Gemayel if you choose
this trip. I.ike konstantin Chernenko,
Gemayel might not be around next year. In
fact. Beirut might not be around next
year.
"There is no better tanning spot in the
Caribbean than Grenada. While you are
basking in the tropical sun you can watch
democracy get a start.
"Another hotspot is the amusement
parks m Central America. The games and
rides of Big Pine II in Honduras are still
going strong. Ihe helicopter ride is not for
the weak-hearted, but enthusiasts say
training a Contra alone is worth the price
ol admission."
