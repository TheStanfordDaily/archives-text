## Give men in zebra suits a break 
### 
111 c one common denom
inator in every level,
every kind and every facet ot
sports is officiating.
h is isn't supposed to make a
liflerence in the outcome of
hi event or even the way in
which .1 game is played. Unfor
tunately. that Utopian ideal of
sports is t;u from the truth.
In all too many instances,
poor" officiating is the
excuse for many losing or just
plain disgruntled coaches.

players and even fans. The
complaints are always the
ame. changing only with a new
"travesty."
Besides complaints, there are
proposals constantly made to
improve officiating. These
proposals always seem to want
10 take the human factor of
error out of the event.
One recent proposal from a
writer was to make referees

and othcials more professional
by making the job a full-time
occupation. The idea here is
that the more practice an offi
cial gets, the better he will be.
That proposal is probably the
best of all options I've ever
heard, but it still doesn't rec
ognize that officiating is
among the most difficult jobs
in all ol sports.
That's certainly not an
excuse. In fact, it's probably
more justification for adopt
ing some such proposal that
would improve officiating. But
the difficulty of officiating is
rarely understood by coaches,
players and fans, no matter
what lev el of sport it is.
Perhaps that's because pro
fessional officials are not
allowed to talk about their
jobs. Kven when they retire,
officials are not very vocal.
Most officials are rather in
nocuous hy profession and the
few win) aren't, like Ron
Luciano, make names for
themselves because they are in
teresting characters and don't
feel compelled to tell the
world how difficult the job
really is.
A better explanation,
however, would be that even if

referees were allowed to ex
plain how difficult their job
really is. most people wouldn't
understand any way.
Why? Because most people
don't know how to officiate
and thus can't understand whv
penalties get missed.
I'hat doesn't mean that
everybody should become a ref
eree just to understand what it
entails, but most people should
shut their mouths unless they
have something constructive
to say.
You may be saying, "What
happened to the right to
criticize?" Well, criticizing
gives the appearance that you
know something about what
you're talking about.
For example, at a recent high
school basketball playoff game
a defensive player took a
charge and a foul was called.
The defensive player's team
was in the bonus situation and
an assistant coach started to
yell at one of the officials that
the player should be shooting
free throws.
Despite his position as assis
tant coach, he failed to realize
that free throws are not shot
on offensive, player-control
fouls.

In another situation. Univer
sity of Washington Basketball
Coach Man Harshman blamed
an early season loss to Stanford
on poor officiating. He called
the game and the officiating
"a crime."
Alter the game Harshman
claimed that the officials were
letting the Cardinal press get
away with practically tackling
his players. But he failed to
reali/e that his team could
have gotten away with same
thing it it were pressing the
same way Stanford was.
I he officiating was consis
tent in that both teams were
getting away with a lot of
physical contact. The Cardinal
merely took advantage of it.
But the worst case of undue
criticism has to be in intra
mural sports. It seems as
though everyone who has ever
played in an IM game is an ex
pert on the rules, despite never
having read a rule book.
Intramural players rarely
know exactly what constitutes
a charge or block and never un
derstand why a call is missed,
even it there is someone stand
ing in the official's \ iew of the
play.
Get this for an officiating
nightmare: On an out-of
bounds play, an offensive
player is being tightly guarded
by someone. Another offen
sive player comes up directly
behind the defensive player to
set a screen.
I he first offensive player
breaks free from the defensive
man using the screen. The in
bounds pass is made and the of
fensive player takes the ball to
the basket but collides with
another defensive player, who
has switched over to cover him,
in the act of shooting. Both
teams simultaneously scream
for a foul. What do you call?
If you're a bad referee you
don't call anything. If you're a
decent referee you call a charg
ing or blocking foul depending
on how you saw it. But if
you're a good referee you
would call an offensive block
ing foul on the man who set
the screen.
To make this situation even
worse, it all happens in a mat
ter of seconds, giving the ref
eree all of a few microseconds
to decide what to call while 10
different people are screaming
at him.
Vou don't have to try it, but
give the zebras a little compas
sion. It's not easy.
