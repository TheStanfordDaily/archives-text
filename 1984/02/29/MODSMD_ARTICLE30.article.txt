I With the excitement of the

land gone, sports fans are
tgearing up for the Summer
■ Games in Los Angeles.
But Bay Area residents who
Idon't plan on lighting the
■ crowds in 1..A. can see the
■Olympics right in their own
|r backyard."
Olympic soccer will find a
■ home at Stanford Stadium
■[from July 29 to Aug. X. And
■ the plans for this event are big
Not only will Olympic soccer
Eat Stanford give residents a
■ chance to view an amateur
I sporting event at its greatest,
I hut it will also mean thousands
I of out-of-town visitors for the
| local business community and a
| chance for local residents to
I become involved in one of the
I world's most prestigious inter-
I national events.
One of the biggest develop
>; ments currently taking place is
I the beginning of an Olympic
| Neighbor Program for the Palo
Alto-Menlo Park area.
The Olympic Neighbor Pro-
II gram was developed by the Los
i Angeles Olympic Organizing
[ Committee (LAOOC) to as-
II sist the communities imniedi-
Kately surrounding a
■ competition site in preparing
li for the Games. Through the
■ program, communities will be
L provided with the latest infor-
I mation about the Games and
will also have an opportunity
to coordinate Olympic-related
•'activities as well as address
local questions.
At present, the direction of
the local Olympic Neighbor
Program is being decided by a
steering committee of Palo
! Alto and Menlo Park citizens.
Similar programs already un

derway in L.A. have sponsored
community forums, film pre
sentations and even an all-
America women's regatta
(hosted by the Olympic Neigh
bors of the rowing competition
site).
Once the steering commit
tee is in full operation, commu
nity members will be urged to
take part in the program.
"We will be hiring hundreds
of volunteers," said Brenda
Pascoe, the LAOOC Bay Area
community relations officer.
"They will be assisting in the
implementation of promo
tional activities and events,
selling 750,000 tickets,
working with the housing and
transportation of athletes and
staff and working at the
Stadium during the Games
themselves."
Pascoe is currently develop
ing several events in the Bay
Area to help foster community
spirit and excitement for the
Olympics. These include every
thing from shopping center
promotions to a celebration
coinciding with the passage ot
the Olympic torch through the
Bay Area — and Stanford —
on July 29, six days before the
opening ceremonies in L.A.
" These plans won't be fully
developed, however, until the
Olympic Neighbor Program is in
full swing," she said.
According to Pascoe, the
most formidable task facing
her group at the moment is the
sale of tickets for the Stan
ford matches.
"People seem to think that
we're all sold out. The final
match at the Rose Bowl may
be sold out, but we still have a
lot of seats available for every
match." She is confident,
however, that the matches will

sell out eventually.
"The primary thrust of our
ticket sales will be geared
towards youth soccer players in
the Bay Area," Pascoe said.
John Boesch, director of the
LAOOC's Bay Area opera
tions, also stressed efforts
being made to sell block tickets
to corporations and groups,
and promotions being made
through travel agencies to at
tract out-of-town visitors.
"We want people to come
and make a vacation out of it."
he said.
Although it is difficult to
make crowd estimates this
much in advance, the number
of out-of-town visitors is ex
pected to reach into the
thousands.
Both Hyatt Rickey's and
Holiday Inn in Palo Alto say
that even though there has not
been a decisive increase in room
reservations during the game
dates as yet, they are expecting
a dramatic surge soon.
Stanford Stadium is one of
four stadiums where Olympic
soccer will be played. The other
stadiums are Harvard Stadium
in Cambridge, Mass., the Navy-
Marine Corps Memorial
Stadium in Annapolis, Md. and
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
The format to be used for
the competitions is called a
"hybrid round-robin tourna
ment." What that means is
that during first-round play,
eight teams will compete on
the East Coast and eight
teams will compete on the
West Coast. Four teams from
each coast will then advance to
the quarterfinal and semifinal
matches at Stanford and
Pasadena, and then the two
finalists will face off on Aug.
11 in the Rose Bowl.
In total, Stanford Stadium,

seating almost 85,000, will be
the site of nine first-round,
quarterfinal and semifinal
matches.
There were initially 100
teams worldwide taking part in
qualifying competitions. That
number has now narrowed to
38, and by April, the 16 Olym
pic teams will be determined.
Two of those teams will auto
matically be Czechoslovakia
(1980 gold medal winner) and
the United States (the host
country).
Because Stanford Stadium
field is designed for football,
siignt alterations may have to
be made to accommodate the
soccer events. Any changes,
however, will be determined by
the LAOOC and will be only
temporary, according to Gary
Bruner. operations and events

manager for the Stanford
Athletic Department.
Bruner also said that im
provements to the stadium it
self, which are being made for
the Super Bowl in 1985, have
been targeted for completion
by July so that they will bene
fit the Olympic events as well.
Improvements include new
locker facilities, new ticket
gates, additional concessions
and restrooms and temporary
lighting (most matches will be
held in the evening).
In addition to accommodat
ing the athletes on the field,
special efforts will be made to
house them off the field.
The athletes will be housed
in Branner Hall on the Stan
ford campus. Though no special
improvements will be made to
the building itself, Sanyo Cor

poration and Atari Inc., offi
cial Olympic sponsors, will
provide televisions and video
games for the athletes' rooms,
according to Nancy Scoles,
Stanford Olympic Village ad
ministrator.
Stanford Food Service will
follow special dietary
guidelines in providing food.
Scoles said that this means
paying attention to religious
beliefs and cultural norms as
well as providing balanced,
nutritious meals. Each menu
must therefore be approved by
the LAOOC.
Security is an important con
cern, as it has been in recent
Olympics. The main security
forces will be provided by the
LAOOC and will work in
cooperation with the Stanford
Police, though no formal plans

or agreements have been made
yet.
Boesch said that although no
major security problems are ex
pected for the Stanford
events, precautions will be
made "to avoid another
Munich of '12''
Boesch sees the relationship
between the LAOOC and the
University as extremely posi
tive so far. "The University
people have all been very help
ful and enthusiastic.
"It is a great distinction for
Stanford to be hosting these
events and it will forever be
memorialized as one of the
sites of the Olympic Games,"
Boesch said. "It's a unique op
portunity for the Stanford
community and its students to
be a part of an historical
event."


The 23rd Olympiad is just around the bend, and Olympic
soccer teams will be shooting for goals here at Stanford
Stadium. The event will attract thousands to the Bay Area,

tions are being made for the Games, and promotional activi
ties are being planned for the coming months.

I become involved in one of the
I world's most prestigious inter-
I national events.
One of the biggest develop
>; ments currently taking place is
I the beginning of an Olympic
| Neighbor Program for the Palo
Alto-Menlo Park area.
The Olympic Neighbor Pro-
II gram was developed by the Los
i Angeles Olympic Organizing
[ Committee (LAOOC) to as-
II sist the communities imniedi-
Kately surrounding a
■ competition site in preparing
li for the Games. Through the
■ program, communities will be
L provided with the latest infor-
I mation about the Games and
will also have an opportunity
to coordinate Olympic-related
•'activities as well as address
local questions.
At present, the direction of
the local Olympic Neighbor
Program is being decided by a
steering committee of Palo
! Alto and Menlo Park citizens.
Similar programs already un

derway in L.A. have sponsored
community forums, film pre
sentations and even an all-
America women's regatta
(hosted by the Olympic Neigh
bors of the rowing competition
site).
Once the steering commit
tee is in full operation, commu
nity members will be urged to
take part in the program.
"We will be hiring hundreds
of volunteers," said Brenda
Pascoe, the LAOOC Bay Area
community relations officer.
"They will be assisting in the
implementation of promo
tional activities and events,
selling 750,000 tickets,
working with the housing and
transportation of athletes and
staff and working at the
Stadium during the Games
themselves."
Pascoe is currently develop
ing several events in the Bay
Area to help foster community
spirit and excitement for the
Olympics. These include every
thing from shopping center
promotions to a celebration
coinciding with the passage ot
the Olympic torch through the
Bay Area — and Stanford —
on July 29, six days before the
opening ceremonies in L.A.
" These plans won't be fully
developed, however, until the
Olympic Neighbor Program is in
full swing," she said.
According to Pascoe, the
most formidable task facing
her group at the moment is the
sale of tickets for the Stan
ford matches.
"People seem to think that
we're all sold out. The final
match at the Rose Bowl may
be sold out, but we still have a
lot of seats available for every
match." She is confident,
however, that the matches will

sell out eventually.
"The primary thrust of our
ticket sales will be geared
towards youth soccer players in
the Bay Area," Pascoe said.
John Boesch, director of the
LAOOC's Bay Area opera
tions, also stressed efforts
being made to sell block tickets
to corporations and groups,
and promotions being made
through travel agencies to at
tract out-of-town visitors.
"We want people to come
and make a vacation out of it."
he said.
Although it is difficult to
make crowd estimates this
much in advance, the number
of out-of-town visitors is ex
pected to reach into the
thousands.
Both Hyatt Rickey's and
Holiday Inn in Palo Alto say
that even though there has not
been a decisive increase in room
reservations during the game
dates as yet, they are expecting
a dramatic surge soon.
Stanford Stadium is one of
four stadiums where Olympic
soccer will be played. The other
stadiums are Harvard Stadium
in Cambridge, Mass., the Navy-
Marine Corps Memorial
Stadium in Annapolis, Md. and
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
The format to be used for
the competitions is called a
"hybrid round-robin tourna
ment." What that means is
that during first-round play,
eight teams will compete on
the East Coast and eight
teams will compete on the
West Coast. Four teams from
each coast will then advance to
the quarterfinal and semifinal
matches at Stanford and
Pasadena, and then the two
finalists will face off on Aug.
11 in the Rose Bowl.
In total, Stanford Stadium,

seating almost 85,000, will be
the site of nine first-round,
quarterfinal and semifinal
matches.
There were initially 100
teams worldwide taking part in
qualifying competitions. That
number has now narrowed to
38, and by April, the 16 Olym
pic teams will be determined.
Two of those teams will auto
matically be Czechoslovakia
(1980 gold medal winner) and
the United States (the host
country).
Because Stanford Stadium
field is designed for football,
siignt alterations may have to
be made to accommodate the
soccer events. Any changes,
however, will be determined by
the LAOOC and will be only
temporary, according to Gary
Bruner. operations and events

manager for the Stanford
Athletic Department.
Bruner also said that im
provements to the stadium it
self, which are being made for
the Super Bowl in 1985, have
been targeted for completion
by July so that they will bene
fit the Olympic events as well.
Improvements include new
locker facilities, new ticket
gates, additional concessions
and restrooms and temporary
lighting (most matches will be
held in the evening).
In addition to accommodat
ing the athletes on the field,
special efforts will be made to
house them off the field.
The athletes will be housed
in Branner Hall on the Stan
ford campus. Though no special
improvements will be made to
the building itself, Sanyo Cor

poration and Atari Inc., offi
cial Olympic sponsors, will
provide televisions and video
games for the athletes' rooms,
according to Nancy Scoles,
Stanford Olympic Village ad
ministrator.
Stanford Food Service will
follow special dietary
guidelines in providing food.
Scoles said that this means
paying attention to religious
beliefs and cultural norms as
well as providing balanced,
nutritious meals. Each menu
must therefore be approved by
the LAOOC.
Security is an important con
cern, as it has been in recent
Olympics. The main security
forces will be provided by the
LAOOC and will work in
cooperation with the Stanford
Police, though no formal plans

or agreements have been made
yet.
Boesch said that although no
major security problems are ex
pected for the Stanford
events, precautions will be
made "to avoid another
Munich of '12''
Boesch sees the relationship
between the LAOOC and the
University as extremely posi
tive so far. "The University
people have all been very help
ful and enthusiastic.
"It is a great distinction for
Stanford to be hosting these
events and it will forever be
memorialized as one of the
sites of the Olympic Games,"
Boesch said. "It's a unique op
portunity for the Stanford
community and its students to
be a part of an historical
event."

soccer teams will be shooting for goals here at Stanford
Stadium. The event will attract thousands to the Bay Area,
