### HEATHER WRIGHT 
In the wake of a recent student rally to protest the
tenure denial ot Eduardo Fuenzalida, associate pro
fessor of Education, six students have introduced
what they consider "new evidence" to warrant the
reconsideration of Fuenzalida s tenure status.
In a closed meeting yesterday with Education
Dean Myron Atkin, the students said the faculty
group reviewing Fuenzalida's case may have over
looked important evidence on his behalf, adding that
"not enough weight was given to Fuenzalida's posi
tion as teacher and adviser."
But there may he problems with the students'
evidence. Atkin explained that "the students are
handicapped because they don't know whether their

evidence is already contained" in the confidential
reports already prepared by the faculty board rev iew
ing Fuenzalida's case.
"I have indicated to the student group that if I
believe that new information has been introduced. I
will consult the faculty review committee." Atkin
said.
But student Francisco Tomic insisted, "We are con
vinced that we have new evidence. We will continue
to work closely with the dean in order to assure that
this evidence gets into the faculty's hands."
The student group said that by April they will be
ready to approach Atkin again. Until then they will
"gather more evidence and maintain close contact
with the faculty review committee."
