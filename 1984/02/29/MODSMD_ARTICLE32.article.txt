# ASSU defeats shuttle service
## 
### BAIE NETZER 
A proposal that would establish a
tree weekend shuttle service from
the Stanford campus to San Fran
cisco was defeated last night by the
ASSU Senate after a one-and-a
half-hour debate.
The bill received a 10-6 vote, hut
failed to get the two-thirds majority
needed to make it a part of the
ASSU bylaws.
The "Culture Connection" pro
posal, submitted by undergraduate
senator Bob Slater, would have
created a six-member board to over
see the operation of a shuttle bus
service between downtown San Fran
cisco and the Stanford campus.
Slater received information from
St. Claire, the organization which
operates the Marguerite shuttle, on

a prospective van contract to run the
San Francisco shuttle on Friday and
Saturday nights as well as Sunday af
ternoons. The funds needed to
finance the contract amounted to
$36,060.
Before the senate voted on whe
ther to include the Culture Connec
tion in the ASSU bylaws, it
approved, in a 12-5 vote, the place
ment of a special fee assessment for
the shuttle on the student ballot.
But after the senate voted to
place the special fee assessment on a
ballot, it declined to adopt the Cul
ture Connection proposal.
Slater said he was confident that
students would have voted in favor
of the special fee assessment.
"1 think we have an obligation to
let the students know that it (the
Culture Connection) is sort of a lot-

tery and that they aren't guaranteed
a seat." he said, "but once they know
that, I think they'll approve the fee
assessment."
Graduate senator Eric Berg spoke
against the proposal saying it would
cause "administrative problems that
will be too much for a director to
handle."
ASSU Financial Manager Mindy
Basham also spoke against the bill.
"You're charging some students
for providing others with a ride," she
said, "and I'd just like to see a more
direct method of students who use
the service paying for it."
The Senate also defeated by a 7-3
vote a proposal by undergraduate
senator Mark Soble which would have
prevented students from inspecting
the registrar's list of voters during
elections.
