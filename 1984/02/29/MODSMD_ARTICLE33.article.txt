# Panel blasts Reagan policies
## Experts say U.S. not looking for peace in Central America 
### REBECCA BUELL 
Every international attempt at
negotiating a regional peace initia
tive in Central America has been
either rejected, disregarded or
blatantly contradicted by the
Reagan administration, according to
political analysts from the Mexican
Institute tor the Study of the
United States.
In a discussion yesterday at the
Center for Educational Research at
Stanford. Jose Miguel Insulza and
Adolfo Aguilar /inser described the
political strategies of the United
States concerning Central America
for an audience of about 75.
"The crisis in Central America has
reached a point where dialogue is a
dirty word," said Insulsa, a Chilean
political scientist. Whenever

negotiations have been suggested,
the United States has rejected the
responsibility or the legitimacy of
the proposal, he said.
The two panelists cited three ex
amples in which the United States
has rejected international peace in
itiatives — the Mexican-French com
munique of 1981. the European
peace initiative and the Contadora
group recommendations.
"To talk about negotiations was
to confront the United States," said
/inser. /inser said the three interna
tional groups were cither intimidated
or ignored by the United States and
the only policy initiative to which
the Reagan administration has
responded is the Kissinger Commis
sion Report on Central America.
"The Kissinger report does not

propose any new solutions, said In
zulsa. "It only supports the policy
which is now taking place in Central
America.
• The United States is bent on a
military solution to the conflict in
Central America." Insulza said, add
ing that the logic of the Reagan ad
ministration's policy and the
Kissinger report is based on one ob
jective: to maintain U.S. power and
influence in the region.
••If there is not a negotiated
settlement in Central America,
there will be a military settlement,"
said /inser. 'The United States will
eventually have to use its own forces
because 110 local army is strong
enough. There will be 110 other option
for the United States than to inter
vene directly."
