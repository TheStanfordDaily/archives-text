### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
Two professors here have made yet another ap
peal to University President Donald Kennedy
and the Stanford community regarding the poli
tical status of the Hoover Institution.
According to the new appeal, which is sched
uled to be released to members of the Stanford
community today, the original mission of the
Trustee committee formed last June to investi
gate the connection between the University and
Hoover was to "strengthen relations between
the two institutions."
But that mission sidesteps the real issue. Pro

fessors John Manley and Ronald Rebholz eon
tend.
"To define the problem of Hoover in terms of
governance presupposes Hoover's continued exis
tence, and it is precisely its continued existence
at Stanford as a political organization that many
members of the Stanford community think
should be debated on campus," the appeal said.
"We are not surprised that the (University)
administration rejects our definition of the
problem, for if they saw the issue of Hoover as
we do they should have to. entertain solutions
that they do not want to consider. The issue of
governance clouds the issue of severance."
Last week. Political Science Prof. Manlev and

English Prof. Rebholz circulated a petition call
ing lor a "distinguished visiting committee" to
look into the relationship between the Univer
sity and the Hoover Institution.
"It Hoover is the leading conservative think
tank in the country, what's it doing at Stanford?
I hat's basically the issue for us," Manlcy said.
"( an a University dedicated to objective non
partisan pursuits house this institution without
getting involved itself, and if it does so, can it do
so with impunity?"
Kennedy responded to last week's petition by
describing it as a "cure seeking a disease," and
said that the ad hoc Trustee commit
tee appointed last spring to look into
Stanford-Hoover ties is "working
well."
In a recent interview with The
Daily. Rebholz called the committee
secretive and ineffectual. "As mem
bers of the Faculty Senate we've
been kept in the dark (as to the com
mittee's activities) again and again,"
he said.

I he latest appeal called Hoover an
"undeniably partisan think tank."
and cited various selections from
recent Hoover Annual Reports as
"impressive evidence" of its national
political connections.
It said Hoover has tried to influ
ence public opinion through over 700
"Hoover essays" published in various
newspapers throughout the country
and through control of the proposed
Reagan Center for Public Affairs
here. "In addition to the reports,
the recent collaborative effort of
Hoover and the White House to
force Hoover control of the pro
posed Reagan Center for Public Af

fairs, thereby screening out the
faculty, revealed the political objec
tives of Hoover so clearly that even
the Administration and Trustees
balked," the appeal said.
