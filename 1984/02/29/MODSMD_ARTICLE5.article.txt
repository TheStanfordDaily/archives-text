# University Food Service is one of the nation's most costly
## 
### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
The cost of University hood Service
has risen at a rate twice that of the
Consumer Price Index over the past
Jive years. In this three-part series,
The Daily examines the high cost of
eating at Stanford and what the Uni
versity is doing about it

The price of University Food
Service is high. And it's getting
higher.
The Board ot Trustees recently
approved a figure ot $4146 for
the 19N4-85 basic room and hoard
rate. Of this amount. $2229 will
go to pay for the annual cost of a
19-mcal plan.
Over the last five years, meal
plan prices have risen hy more
than 70 percent. This year's in
crease is 8.75 percent, even
though the CPI is expected to rise
hy only 5 percent. Why does the
price ot food service continue to
rise at such a rapid pace?
According to Associate Provost

Timothy Warner, the major rea
son for this year's increase is a
"debt provision to the new
Governor's Corner facilities." In
other words, all campus residents
are now paying off the debt for
last year's construction of Gover
nor's Corner.
"The facility was financed using
tax-free bonds." Warner said. T his
form of financing results in lower
interest rates, but means that
debt service of $3.5 million per
year will continue to be a factor in
determining room and hoard
rates.
One ot the discoveries con
tained in the IM(S2 report by the
ASSU 'lask Force on University
Food Service was that Stanford's
board rates were higher than the
rates at other universities. "One
of the most obvious and distress
ing facts is that, except for Vale,
Stanford charges its students
more than any other food service
at ;m\ of the colleges we obtained

information from,"the report
said.
In particular the report noted
that "Stanford's food prepara
tion costs are 30 to 50 percent
above schools with similar size
kitchens," and "30 to SO percent
more than identical plans offered
by private contractors."
More than 18 months have
passed since the committee
released its recommendations, and
members of the task force still
feel that prices are too high. "In
comparison with other univer
sities, they're too high," said
senior Mark Kalkus, co-chairman
of the Task Force. "We're also
high in comparison with Ivy
League schools . . . which all
seemed to have more flexible pro
grams," Kalkas said.
Yet the unique nature of Stan
ford's food service program may

also create difficulties when at
tempting comparisons. "You can't
make a direct comparison with other
universities," said Ed Scoles, manage
ment director of housing and food
service. "For example. Harvard and
Yale only have one food plan â€” 21
meals period. There are no exemp
tions, no refunds for class conflicts."
Still, task force co-chairman Gor
don Hecker said he has "a feeling
that people are still concerned about
the prohibitive cost of food service."

Hecker, a resident assistant at Alpha
Sig, added, "1 always like to believe
that there are ways to cut costs. I
think there still are ways that we can
cut the cost of food service."
In addition to the debt service, an
other reason that food service costs
so much is the high salaries which are
paid to the members of its unionized
labor force. "Our per-hour labor
costs are two to three times higher
than McDonald's costs," Scoles said.
In the wake of an impending deci
sion on the closure of Stanford's
commissary, a question has been
raised as to the efficiency of that
facility: Will the closure raise the
prices that kitchens pay for their

food !
According to Scoles, the decision
to close the commissary is not yet
final. "If we go to an alternate
method, we will save a significant
amount in food costs," Scoles said.
"The cost of food will be less because
you're actually dealing with dis
tributors who have greater purchas
ing power."
Tomorrow: As pari of its 1982
report, the ASSU Tusk Force on Uni
versity Food Service made several
major recommendations for lowering
costs. The Daily looks at implementa
tion of those recommendations in the
experimental food service plan at Ster
ling Quad.
