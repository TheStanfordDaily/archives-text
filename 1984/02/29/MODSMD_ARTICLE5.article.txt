The cost of University hood Service
has risen at a rate twice that of the
Consumer Price Index over the past
Jive years. In this three-part series,
The Daily examines the high cost of
eating at Stanford and what the Uni
versity is doing about it

The price of University Food
Service is high. And it's getting
higher.
The Board ot Trustees recently
approved a figure ot $4146 for
the 19N4-85 basic room and hoard
rate. Of this amount. $2229 will
go to pay for the annual cost of a
19-mcal plan.
Over the last five years, meal
plan prices have risen hy more
than 70 percent. This year's in
crease is 8.75 percent, even
though the CPI is expected to rise
hy only 5 percent. Why does the
price ot food service continue to
rise at such a rapid pace?
According to Associate Provost

Timothy Warner, the major rea
son for this year's increase is a
"debt provision to the new
Governor's Corner facilities." In
other words, all campus residents
are now paying off the debt for
last year's construction of Gover
nor's Corner.
"The facility was financed using
tax-free bonds." Warner said. T his
form of financing results in lower
interest rates, but means that
debt service of $3.5 million per
year will continue to be a factor in
determining room and hoard
rates.
One ot the discoveries con
tained in the IM(S2 report by the
ASSU 'lask Force on University
Food Service was that Stanford's
board rates were higher than the
rates at other universities. "One
of the most obvious and distress
ing facts is that, except for Vale,
Stanford charges its students
more than any other food service
at ;m\ of the colleges we obtained

information from,"the report
said.
In particular the report noted
that "Stanford's food prepara
tion costs are 30 to 50 percent
above schools with similar size
kitchens," and "30 to SO percent
more than identical plans offered
by private contractors."
More than 18 months have
passed since the committee
released its recommendations, and
members of the task force still
feel that prices are too high. "In
comparison with other univer
sities, they're too high," said
senior Mark Kalkus, co-chairman
of the Task Force. "We're also
high in comparison with Ivy
League schools . . . which all
seemed to have more flexible pro
grams," Kalkas said.

ford's food service program may
