Saudi wants U.S. in Lebanon
Washington — King Fahd of Saudi Arabia yesterday urged
President Reagan to stay actively involved in Lebanon, but
the appeal came as diplomatic sources revealed that the
United States had rejected a request from Lebanese Presi
dent Amin Gemayel to use U.S. naval firepower to main
tain the military status quo in Lebanon.
Fahd s call lor the United States not to withdraw from
efforts to resolve the Lebanese civil war was contained in a
letter delivered to Reagan late yesterday by the Saudi am
bassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, shortly after he
returned here from the Middle East.
I he letter came as U.S. officials were signaling that the
United States now intends to let the Lebanese and other
Arabs seek a solution on their own. A special Gemayel en
voy who came here last week was informed that the admin
istration not only will not extend its military commitments
111 Lebanon but also plans to play a passive role politically.
According to sources familiar with the Saudi letter, Fahd
warned that disengaging from Lebanon could cause ir
reparable damage to U.S. influence in the region, and he
argued that Reagan could salvage the situation by support
ing a Saudi plan for a political agreement between Gemayel
and the Syrian-backed dissident factions opposing his gov
ernment.
U.S. disputes Iraqi claims
Washington — Despite Iraq's claims that it had launched
"devastating strikes" on Iran's Kharg Island oil depot, U.S.
officials said yesterday that there is no evidence that the
key Iranian exporting facility had been struck.
Even so, administration officials warned that Iraq's an
nouncement of the attack indicated that its 3-year-old war
with Iran was clearly heating up again and, more menacingly,
was moving offshore into the Persian Gulf. Western
Europe and Japan depend heavily on oil supplies that
originate in the region and pass through the Strait of Hor
muz at the southern end of the gulf.
A White House official yesterday repeated President
Reagan's pledge "to do what is necessary" to keep the
strait open in the face of Iranian threats to retaliate by
stopping the flow of oil through the gulf.
Intelligence sources said Iraq used Soviet-built aircraft in
the bombing runs but flew at such high altitudes (about
five miles) that it was almost certain that the ordinary
bombs the planes dropped would miss the island by great
distances.
Bonn concerned about blunt
U.S. defense posture warnings
Bonn, West Germany — The West German government is
becoming increasingly worried about possible harmful reper
cussions from blunt American warnings that the European
allies must assume greater responsibility for their own
defense or the United States may cut its military commit
ments in Europe.
Despite Chancellor Helmut Kohl's strong sympathies
with the Reagan administration, Bonn officials are express
ing anxiety that growing U.S. impatience with European re
luctance to expand defense spending may sow further
alienation and encourage the kind of neutralist sentiment
that the U.S. and West German governments want to
prevent.
During his trip to Washington later this week. Kohl plans
to impress upon Reagan that he and French President Fran
cois Mitterrand intend to bolster defense cooperation be
tween their two countries to strengthen the "European
pillar" of the alliance. West German defense officials ad
mit, however, that Kohl will be able to show little tangible
progress so far.
Bipartisan budget talks stall
Washington — Negotiations between the White House
and Congress to reduce federal deficits ground to at least a
temporary halt yesterday, but Congress continued to move
ahead with spending-cut and tax-increase legislation of its
own.
However, even the congressional efforts seemed unlikely
to meet the goal set yesterday by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volcker: a deficit no bigger than $50 billion,
as soon as possible. The Congressional Budget Office es
timates that the deficit will be nearly $200 billion this year
and. without efforts to cut it, will grow to more than $300
billion by 1989.
"We're in kind of a gridlock," Volcker warned the Na
tional Governors' Association. The Governors' Association
voted to recommend a package of $243 billion in spending
cuts and $217 billion in tax increases over the next five
years, but even that would leave the deficit more than
double Volcker's goal.
Court rules on sex-bias law
Washington — In an important victory for the Reagan
administration and a setback for women's rights groups, the
Supreme Court adopted yesterday a narrow interpretation
ot Title IX, the civil-rights law barring sex discrimination by
schools and colleges that get federal aid.
The justices accepted the administration's view that the
mere acceptance by a private college of students who get
federal tuition grants does not subject the entire institu
tion to Title IX. So long as such a school receives no other
federal funds, the court held, then Title IX applies only to
the school's financial aid office.
Feminist groups had contended that once a college
receives federal funds, either directly or indirectly through
its students, then the whole school was covered by the law
against sex bias. Until the Reagan administration took of
fice, the U.S. Department of Education had agreed with
this broader interpretation of Title IX.
Yesterday's decision could affect a number of disputes
over school athletic programs in which women have com
plained about the relatively large sums of money some uni
versities spend on men's sports. Under the decision, a
college would no longer be required to equalize spending on
men's and women's physical education programs merely be
cause some of its students get federal scholarship grants.
Market plunges after rally
New York — The stock market, which rallied a day earlier
with a second-hand report that renewed hopes tor cutting
the federal budget deficit, plunged yesterday as investors
re-evaluated what had been said.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen
I4.sb points Monday and 45.33 points over the past two
sessions, fell 22.82 points to 1157.14. It was the biggest
one-day decline since the average tell Z4.19 points on heb.

was moving offshore into the Persian Gulf. Western
Europe and Japan depend heavily on oil supplies that
originate in the region and pass through the Strait of Hor
muz at the southern end of the gulf.
A White House official yesterday repeated President
Reagan's pledge "to do what is necessary" to keep the
strait open in the face of Iranian threats to retaliate by
stopping the flow of oil through the gulf.
Intelligence sources said Iraq used Soviet-built aircraft in
the bombing runs but flew at such high altitudes (about
five miles) that it was almost certain that the ordinary
bombs the planes dropped would miss the island by great
distances.
Bonn concerned about blunt
U.S. defense posture warnings
Bonn, West Germany — The West German government is
becoming increasingly worried about possible harmful reper
cussions from blunt American warnings that the European
allies must assume greater responsibility for their own
defense or the United States may cut its military commit
ments in Europe.
Despite Chancellor Helmut Kohl's strong sympathies
with the Reagan administration, Bonn officials are express
ing anxiety that growing U.S. impatience with European re
luctance to expand defense spending may sow further
alienation and encourage the kind of neutralist sentiment
that the U.S. and West German governments want to
prevent.
During his trip to Washington later this week. Kohl plans
to impress upon Reagan that he and French President Fran
cois Mitterrand intend to bolster defense cooperation be
tween their two countries to strengthen the "European
pillar" of the alliance. West German defense officials ad
mit, however, that Kohl will be able to show little tangible
progress so far.
Bipartisan budget talks stall
Washington — Negotiations between the White House
and Congress to reduce federal deficits ground to at least a
temporary halt yesterday, but Congress continued to move
ahead with spending-cut and tax-increase legislation of its
own.
However, even the congressional efforts seemed unlikely
to meet the goal set yesterday by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volcker: a deficit no bigger than $50 billion,
as soon as possible. The Congressional Budget Office es
timates that the deficit will be nearly $200 billion this year
and. without efforts to cut it, will grow to more than $300
billion by 1989.
"We're in kind of a gridlock," Volcker warned the Na
tional Governors' Association. The Governors' Association
voted to recommend a package of $243 billion in spending
cuts and $217 billion in tax increases over the next five
years, but even that would leave the deficit more than
double Volcker's goal.
Court rules on sex-bias law
Washington — In an important victory for the Reagan
administration and a setback for women's rights groups, the
Supreme Court adopted yesterday a narrow interpretation
ot Title IX, the civil-rights law barring sex discrimination by
schools and colleges that get federal aid.
The justices accepted the administration's view that the
mere acceptance by a private college of students who get
federal tuition grants does not subject the entire institu
tion to Title IX. So long as such a school receives no other
federal funds, the court held, then Title IX applies only to
the school's financial aid office.
Feminist groups had contended that once a college
receives federal funds, either directly or indirectly through
its students, then the whole school was covered by the law
against sex bias. Until the Reagan administration took of
fice, the U.S. Department of Education had agreed with
this broader interpretation of Title IX.
Yesterday's decision could affect a number of disputes
over school athletic programs in which women have com
plained about the relatively large sums of money some uni
versities spend on men's sports. Under the decision, a
college would no longer be required to equalize spending on
men's and women's physical education programs merely be
cause some of its students get federal scholarship grants.

Saudi wants U.S. in Lebanon
Washington — King Fahd of Saudi Arabia yesterday urged
President Reagan to stay actively involved in Lebanon, but
the appeal came as diplomatic sources revealed that the
United States had rejected a request from Lebanese Presi
dent Amin Gemayel to use U.S. naval firepower to main
tain the military status quo in Lebanon.
Fahd s call lor the United States not to withdraw from
efforts to resolve the Lebanese civil war was contained in a
letter delivered to Reagan late yesterday by the Saudi am
bassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, shortly after he
returned here from the Middle East.
I he letter came as U.S. officials were signaling that the
United States now intends to let the Lebanese and other
Arabs seek a solution on their own. A special Gemayel en
voy who came here last week was informed that the admin
istration not only will not extend its military commitments
111 Lebanon but also plans to play a passive role politically.
According to sources familiar with the Saudi letter, Fahd
warned that disengaging from Lebanon could cause ir
reparable damage to U.S. influence in the region, and he
argued that Reagan could salvage the situation by support
ing a Saudi plan for a political agreement between Gemayel
and the Syrian-backed dissident factions opposing his gov
ernment.
U.S. disputes Iraqi claims
Washington — Despite Iraq's claims that it had launched
"devastating strikes" on Iran's Kharg Island oil depot, U.S.
officials said yesterday that there is no evidence that the
key Iranian exporting facility had been struck.
Even so, administration officials warned that Iraq's an
nouncement of the attack indicated that its 3-year-old war
with Iran was clearly heating up again and, more menacingly,
was moving offshore into the Persian Gulf. Western
Europe and Japan depend heavily on oil supplies that
originate in the region and pass through the Strait of Hor
muz at the southern end of the gulf.
