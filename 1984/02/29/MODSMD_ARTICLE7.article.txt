## Gemayel seeks meeting with Assad 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Beirut, Lebanon — President Amin Gemavel. his
backing by the United States sharply diminished In
the departure of the U.S. Marines from Lebanon, was
widely believed here yesterday to be 011 the \erge ol
putting his country's fate — and his own — into
Syria's hands.
Gemayel. who had clearly counted 011 the
Americans to solve Lebanon's problems, was reported
by a number of sources yesterday to be trying to ar
range a meeting soon with Syrian President Hafez As
sad. It would be the first meeting of the two leaders
since Gemayel's election in September IMS 2.
The reports came on a day in which Beirut and the
nearby mountains were the scenes of continued heavy
fighting between the Lebanese army and Moslem
militiamen.
Reuters news agency reported from Damascus that
diplomatic sources there had said Assad and Gemayel
could meet as early as today. Other reports said they

would probably meet by the weekend.
I lie main topic will be Lebanon's Mav 17 troop
withdrawal and security agreement with Israel. Syria,
which exerts strong influence here through its
Lebanese Sliia Moslem and Druse allies, is angry with
Arab Lebanon for having signed the agreement with
Israel and has insisted that it be abrogated.
Gemayel. whose government controls little of
Lebanon's territory and who is under increasing pres
sure from factional enemies, appears to have little
choice but to scrap the U.S.-sponsored accord.
I lie independent newspaper An Nahar. which has
close government contacts, said yesterday that
Gemayel has already decided to cancel the agreement
with Israel and that he is now seeking a good way to
do it. How it will be done is a hot issue among
Lebanese politicians, many of whom do not want to
be associated with the abrogation process although
they believe that the agreement should be scrapped.
It lias been suggested that the Cabinet of Premier

Shalik Wazzan. which resigned Feb. 5. be reactivated
to deal with the agreement. However. Wazzan. who
has none into seclusion, was c|noted as saying that a
new government must be formed to handle the prob
lem.
As Gemavel studied his next move. I ranee, the only
remaining member of the multinational peacekeeping
force. was warned yesterday in an anonymous phone
call to the French news agency Agence France-Presse
that French troops must leave Lebanon within a
wee k.
The anom mous caller said he represented Islamic
Jihad, the group that claimed responsibility for
suicide bombing attacks on U.S. and French troops
last Oct. 23.
There was also another warning made yesterday,
this one by the Phalangists. who said that the Mos
lems shelling the Christian areas of Beirut must stop
or face reprisals in West Beirut, which has been under
the control of militiamen since an uprising on Feb. 6.
