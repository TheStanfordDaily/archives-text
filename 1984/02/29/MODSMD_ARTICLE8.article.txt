## 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Baghdad, Iraq — Iraq issued a new
warning yesterday to shippers using
Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal, saying
it is "ready to strike" at any tanker ap
proaching the island, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
INA reported late Monday that Iraqi
warplanes had attacked tankers
anchored at Kharg, but there has been
no independent confirmation of the at
tack. Iran denied the claim yesterday.
Lloyd's insurance company said in Lon
don that it had received no word of ves
sels having been destroyed or damaged
at the island and U.S. intelligence
sources said there were signs on the is
land that the attack had occurred.
INA said that by extending the war

to include Kharg terminal, Iraq had
"widened the scope of its deterrence to
the Iranian regime."
This was taken as a reference to new
Iranian offensives 011 Iraqi territory.
INA said 30,000 Iranian troops had
been killed in the last three days in the
Al-Hawizan marshes in southern Iraq.
Meanwhile, Iran's official news
agency IRNA accused Iraq of using
chemical weapons against its troops.
More than 400 Iranian soldiers were
suffering from skin burns and mental
disorders caused by the weapons, IRNA
said in a report trom Teheran.
Government sources in Washington
confirmed that the U.S. destroyer
Lawrence had fired warning shots Sun
day at an Iranian reconnaissance plane

near the Strait of Hormu/.
The destroyer also forced the
withdrawal of an Iranian frigate in ac
cordance with the five-mile security
zone that Washington has declared for
its warships in the area, the sources
said.
Iran in recent months has threatened
to blockade the strait at the mouth ot
the Persian Gulf if Iraq strikes at its oil
installations in the area. Washington
has repeatedly said that it would not
tolerate a blockade of the vital oil
supply route. Between 8 and 10 million
barrels of oil a day — about 20 percent
of the Western world's imports — pass
out through the 24-mile-wide strait.
In Tokyo, the Trade Ministry said
yesterday that the Japanese shipowners

Taiheihyo Kaiun and Shoyo Kaiun had
instructed their tankers to avoid Kharg
Island and to restrict themselves to the
southern part of the Gulf.
Elsewhere in the war. Iranian forces
repelled a heavy Iraqi counter-offensive
late Monday in the Al-Ozair region,
I KM A said.
More than 500 Iraqi soldiers were
killed or wounded and hundreds
captured in the battle, the agency said.
It said Iraqi warplanes bombarded the
city of Dehloran, in Iran's Nam prov
ince. yesterday morning. Like the Iraqi
army, the air force was also using chemi
cal weapons, killing or wounding
hundreds of civilians over the past few
davs, IRNA said.
