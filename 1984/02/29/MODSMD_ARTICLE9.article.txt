# Hart victory sends others reeling

From The Washington I'ust
New Hampshire primary
Manchester, N.H. — Colorado
Sen. Gary llart yesterday
scored a surprise victory in the
New Hampshire Democratic
presidential primary, seriously
setting hack former Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale's
prospects and turning the race
lor the 1954 nomination into
what could be a prolonged and
exhausting contest.
Hart gained strength daily
since he claimed a surprise
second-place finish in the Feb.
20 lowa precinct caucuses and
surged past Mondale on the
final weekend before the
voting in the first primary of
the year, according to polls by
The Washington Post and ABC
News.
With a day-long snowstorm
holding down the voter tur
nout, Hart sent the longtime
favorite for the nomination
reeling, and drove all the other
candidates except Ohio Sen.
John Glenn down to
single-digit figures that
seemed to foreshadow an early
exit from the race for most of
them.
With a third-place finish
here after his fifth-place
showing in lowa. Glenn vowed
to take his campaign into the
Southern primaries on March
13 that loom as the next major
test.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson,
whose skid apparently added
votes to the Hart column, also
is expected to compete in Ala
bama, Georgia and Florida 011
"Super Tuesday."
But the four trailing
candidates — former South
Dakota Sen. George

McGovern, South Carolina
Sen. Ernest Hollings, Califor
nia Sen. Alan Cranston and
former Florida Gov. Reubin
Askew — faced severe
credibility problems.
President Reagan was win
ning 97 percent of the votes in
the Republican primary, and
apparently received more
write-in votes in the Demo
cratic primary than Cranston
or Askew got from those who
turned out yesterday.
The total vote — on a day of
blowing snow, sleet and freez
ing rain — fell far below the
expected turnout of 110,000
voters. Early estimates were
that 51,000 voters went to the

polls, down 52 percent from
the 113,152 who voted in
I 980.
Yesterday's results added
another chapter to the New
Hampshire primary's history of
upsets and broken-hearted
favorites. Mondale aides long
have been wary of New
Hampshire's conservative and
unpredictable voters but it was
only in the last two days that
they saw disaster approaching.
The testing will resume Sun
day in Maine, where Hart will
pit the momentum of his New
Hampshire win against the or
ganization that gave Mondale a
big victory in last autumn's
Democratic state convention
straw vote. Mondale is sup

ported hy the state's leading
Democratic officeholders.
Hart also will he a strong
challenger in next Tuesday's
Vermont beauty contest and
the March 10 Wyoming
caucuses.
But the Coloradan faces a
serious problem on March 13.
He has only token support and
organization at this point in
the South. In Massachusetts,
where Mondale again has the
strongest big-name Demo
cratic endorsements,
McGovern could cut into
Hart's tally if McGovern
remains in the race.
Glenn and Jackson, though
wounded coming out of New
Hampshire, are expected to

provide the main competition
for Mondale in the South,
while Hart tries to replenish his
exhausted treasury and prepare
himself for later contests in
the Northeast, the Midwest
and the West.
Glenn said Hart's strong
showing turned the Demo
cratic race into an entirely new
ball game. "This is really the
beginning of the campaign, not
the end of the campaign as
they (Mondale's organization)
had hoped," Glenn fold CBS
News. Glenn said that
Mondale's slide here in New
Hampshire demolishes the
"inevitability" argument that
had been advanced by the
frontrunner.

Hart looks ahead
Manchester, N.H. — In only
eight days, surging through the
lowa caucuses and New
Hampshire primary. Mart has
shattered Mondale's vaunted
three-year master plan to lock
up the Democratic presidential
nomination by mid-March.
Hart, with his political base
in the West and now with clear
momentum in the Midwest and
New England, probably will
force Mondale to campaign
harder outside the South over
the next two weeks, and may
even change the tenor of the
debate over the nomination.
To win the nomination in
July, Hart still must overcome
tough odds to raise sufficient
funds and forge a national or
ganization strong enough to
transform his apparent
popularity into votes and
overtake the advantages
Mondale established long ago
in the complex process of
amassing convention delegates.
But Hart and his strategists
are confident that they will
gain money, workers and even
delegate candidates as the
field of eight presidential
hopefuls narrows in the coming
weeks and his momentum
builds.
Mondale's previous strategy
had been to eliminate most
competitors by New
Hampshire, then knock out
Glenn in the March 13 prima
ries and March 17 caucuses and
crown his victory with a tri
umph in the March 20 Illinois
primary.
"Walter Mondale has the at
titude that he can knock me
out of this race in March.
That's just not going to be the
case," Hart said yesterday in a

pre-election interview. "Some
time in March we'll begin to
win some primaries and some
caucuses."
"Our overall strategy is one
of time and patience," said
Oliver Henkel. Hart's campaign
manager. "We are not going to
be forced into a game that we
are not willing to play or the
rules for which we think are
stacked in someone else's fa
vor. We can pick our spots. We
can say what we intend to do,
and if we achieve these objec
tives, we can maintain momen
tum."
Hart's strategists say that
with Mondale reeling after
New Hampshire, the com
pressed. heavily front-loaded
nomination process engineered
by Mondale's supporters
paradoxically may allow
Mondale less time to recover.
"This is where the rules have
a double whammy," said Hart
strategist Patrick Caddell.
"They tend to provide momen
tum — intense momentum —
and it's much more difficult to
organize and counterattack."
Having to fight on more
than just the Southern front
also could strain Mondale's
ability to make unexpected ad
ditional expenditures without
exceeding federal spending
limits. By the end of March,
Mondale is projected to have
spent $17 million of the total
$24 million that candidates
may spend under federal limits
during the primaries and
caucuses.
Hart's showing here also
could resuscitate Glenn's dying
campaign, which was critically
wounded by his fifth-place
finish in the lowa caucuses Feb.
20.
