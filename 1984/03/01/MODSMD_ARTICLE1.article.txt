San Francisco — Stanford graduate and California
Sen. Alan Cranston told 150 supporters here last night
that although he is withdrawing from the race for the
Democratic presidential nomination, he will run for Sen
ate re-election in 19K6 and keep fighting to end the
arms race.
"I said right from the start that I'm running in two
races," Cranston told the supporters. "'One was the race
for the Democratic nomination and the presidency. That
race is over for me today. The other more important race
is the one to banish nuclear weapons from the face of
Ciod's earth and I am in that race to stay."
Cranston's decision to end his campaign came one day
alter he earned only 2 percent of the votes in the New
Hampshire primary. South Carolina Senator Ernest Hol
lings also announced yesterday that he would withdraw
from the race.
Cranston declined yesterday to endorse any of the
remaining candidates for the Democratic nomination.
"1 do not plan to make an endorsement at this time,"
he said. "1 may or may not make one later. I will of
course endorse and wholeheartedly support the nominee
of the Democratic Party."
Cranston said he was surprised Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart beat former Vice President Walter Mondale in
New Hampshire Tuesday.
"We expected whoever made a strong showing in lowa
would have the momentum to carry on with a strong

showing in New Hampshire," Cranston said. "Our game
plan was to make a strong showing in lowa and then go
on to a stronger showing yet in New Hampshire. Instead,
it turned out to he Gary Hart."
But Cranston said neither Hart nor Mondale has a
clear-cut shot at the Democratic nomination.
"No one is running away with it at this point, and it
may well be that no one will lock up the nomination and
it will come down to our convention in San Francisco," he
said. "And it's conceivable that somebody not now in
the race — and I'm not referring to myself, but someone
who has never been :n the race — might emerge as the
nominee at a deadlocked convention in San Francisco."
Cranston told his supporters that, despite his
withdrawal from the race, his campaign has been a suc
cess.
"I believe my campaign succeeded and failed in one
particular respect. The success is that I've forced the is
sues of the arms race and nuclear war to the very fore
front of the presidential campaign of 1954. I led the
way: all the other candidates started taking stronger and
stronger positions on that issue, and that diffused the
peace vote," Cranston said.
"I'm delighted that all the candidates are now com
mitted to increasingly strong positions. I regret that the
taking of a strong position more and more by them
diffused the vote and deprived me of as much of the
peace vote that 1 otherwise would have got."
