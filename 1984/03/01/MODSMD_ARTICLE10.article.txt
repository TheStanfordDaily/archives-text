"It's not over until it's over," a local paper
quoted Yogi Berra in an editorial yesterday on
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart's surprise victory in
New Hampshire. Unfortunately, though, with
the current presidential primary system, for
many candidates it's over before it's begun.
Depite earlier talk of smooth sailing to the
Democratic presidential nomination for former
Vice President Walter Mondale, Hart now has
the winds of momentum behind him after his
convincing win in New Hampshire.
Meanwhile, Ohio Sen. John Glenn, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, former South Dakota Sen.
George McGovern and former Florida Gov.
Reubin Askew are foundering, and California
Sen. Alan Cranston and South Carolina Sen.
Ernest Hollings have folded their sails and gone
home.
All this after one official primary in New
Hampshire, a state with a smaller population
than Santa Clara County, with only a tiny num
ber of minorities and fewer registered
Democrats than there are in San Francisco.
New Hampshire is representative of neither
the United States nor the Democratic Partv.

But it — with media inducement — plays a huge
role in determining who will face President
Reagan in November's election.
The voters in this tiny, traditionally Republi
can state have decided whom Democrats can
choose in other states when the primaries come
to them. Alan Cranston will no longer be a
choice when the California primary — his big
chance for success — comes around in June. And
it's likely that Reubin Askew won't be around
when the other candidates head for the South,
where he could perform respectably. There's a
problem when the voters in tiny New Hampshire
can see to that.
One same-day national primary election
would solve that problem. All candidates could
offer themselves in all states, and no state —
large or small — would be able to eliminate can
didates before any other state had its chance to
vote.
Instead, today, after picking up 11 delegates
in New Hampshire, Gary Hart is a contender. On
March 13, "Super Tuesday," 627 delegates from
six states will be up for grabs. But for candi
dates like Cranston, it's over before it's begun.
