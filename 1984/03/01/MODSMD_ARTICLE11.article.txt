# A poverty non-solution
## 
### 
The Census Bureau last Thursday announced
the poverty figures for 1982. According to the
report, there were 34.4 million people below the
poverty line in 1982. This in itself is alarming.
Given the propensity of the government to set
a ridiculously low poverty line (it was set at
$9862 in 1982 for a family of four), the fact
that 15 percent of the population subsists
below it is disturbing.
What is more alarming is that there were 26.1
million people, or 11.7 percent of the popula
tion, below the poverty line in 1979 (the cutoff
figure then was $7286 for a family of four).
This figure represents an increase of 28.2 per
cent over this three-year period.
To quell our fears about poverty, the Reagan
administration, when it took office, claimed
that the poverty figures were inflated because
only cash income was counted while in-kind
benefits, food stamps, Aid to Families with De
pendent Children (AFDC) payments, Medicaid,
etc.. were ignored. In addition, the new adminis
tration said that much of the welfare system
was unnecessary and easily abused.
To check the first claim, the Senate in 1980
asked the Census Bureau to find poverty figures
usinc both the conventional means as well as

counting in-kind benefits. As expected,
the second method produced lower poverty fig
ures: 15.1 million poor (6.8 percent) in 1979 and
22.9 million (10.0 percent) in 1982. Lower,
maybe, but not by no means better: 15.1 million
poor mean that even with the array of welfare
programs in place, 6.8 percent of the population
was still below the poverty line in 1979. The lat
ter figures are even more distressing.
Calculating using the in-kind benefit inclusive
values, the poverty level rose 47.1 percent in
that three-year period. The poor of Hispanic
descent had a poverty increase rate of 70.8 per
cent and families headed by a woman had a
poverty rate of 49.4 percent.
Distressing, perhaps, but not in the least bit
surprising. The Reagan administration, after
claiming that poverty figures were inflated be
cause they neglected in-kind transfers, immedi
ately began cutting those very same programs.
The present patchwork of poverty programs
— AFDC, Medicaid, food stamps, temporary
unemployment insurance, to name a few — has
not stopped all of the poor from falling through
the safety net. The Reagan administration's so
lution — cutting the programs that help the
poor — is, however, not a solution.
