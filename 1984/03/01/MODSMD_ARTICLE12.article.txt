## CIA: a discriminating employer 
### 
I noted with interest your front
page article on CIA recruitment at
Stanford (Daily, Feb. 13). Of the
hundreds of employers who annually
visit this campus, perhaps this spe
cial treatment is reserved only for
those who purchase full page ad
vertisements in your newspaper:
nevertheless, the hiring and promo
tional practices of this organization,
which makes discrimination against
ga\s and lesbians a matter of offi
cial policy, raise questions of
moralitN and fundamental fairness
more deserving of neutral and criti
cal journalistic attention than this
newspaper has afforded.
In my view the issue is not whe
ther students facing the job market
today are more accepting of such an
organization than the " '60s radi
cals" ot I 5 or 20 years ago. but
rather whether uraduatinu students

are — and should he — complacent
about this kind of discrimination by
an employer who enjoys the re
sources and the hospitality of this
university.
The CIA among all federal
agencies maintains one of the most
rigid and most intolerant attitudes
toward gay employees. Its position,
that heterodox sexual preferences
of its agents pose a per se risk to
national security is not only indefen
sible on any objective view of fact
and experience; in addition, it per
petuates the stereotype that gays
are untrustworthy and unfit to
serve their country. Its enforcement
lends itself to the use of coercion
and informants. It impinges on our
rights of free association and privacy
Neither the agency's own ad
vertisement nor your article ade
quately discloses that this employer.

looking in its own words for "all the
normal things," actually approaches
job applicants with a particular and
retrograde moralism designed to
cement into an inferior caste those
of us who in the conscious exercise
of our individual liberties decline to
conform to its dictates. By lending
its facilities for the recruitment of
new members of this corps of
upstanding moral guardians, Stan
ford University cannot escape com
plicity in the perpetuation of this
kind of invidious discrimination.
Moreover, all applicants should be
aware that by accepting a position
with the CIA they implicitly endorse
a policy which is fundamentally
unfair and degrading to their gay
and lesbian classmates.
