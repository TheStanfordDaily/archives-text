## Pac-10 doesn't need a tournament 
### 
While I do not claim to have a
neanderthal mind, as described by
Adam Herns (Daily, Feb. 16), I do
oppose a post-season basketball
tournament for the Pac-10. Berns
argues in favor of a tournament, and
a couple of his claims are forceful,
but many more are misguided, and he
does a poor job of representing those

VIEWPOINT

who would disagree with him. Let us
therefore take up his argument point
by point and suggest why things in
the Pac-10 should be left the way
they are.
112 irst among Berns' claims is that a
tournament would increase the num
ber ol bids the Pac-10 would receive
for the NCAA and NIT tourna
ments. This can be true only if there
magically appeared more bids for
those tournaments to distribute, for
e\er\ time a bid is awarded to a team
primarily on the basis of a tourna
ment performance, or • is taken away
from a u im that may ha\e earned it
during the regular season.
Suppose, loi example, that Stan
lord wins the rest of its games this
year to finish with a 21-10 overall
record and third place in the Pac-10.
NCAA bid. right? But then suppose
that in the Pac-10 tournament
Washington State regroups from its

3-15 conference effort to win the
title and the league's automatic bid.
The NCAA decides it can't justify
giving four bids to the Pac-10 so
Stanford doesn't get its well
deserved bid.
A more Stanford-biased and
therefore understandable claim in
Berns' argument is that "a post
season tournament justifiably
rewards those teams which are
playing well at the end of the year."
Looked at from another angle, this is
to say that it unjustifiably punishes
those teams which played well all
year.
Berns writes. "As it stands now,
teams which start out poorly, even if
they are playing well and keeping
games close, are out of it before the
season really begins." Deservedly so.
The teams which start out well and
have the poise and character to win
close games throughout the season
are thereby in a position to reap the
benefits of their consistent and in
spired play. And just w hat does Berns
define as the real beginning of the
season? Stanford had 12 non
conference games to prepare for the
Pac-10 season, and that really should
be enough.
I he most puzzling assertion Berns
make- is "A conference tournament
worn > negate the effects of long
lav« is v hieh often plague teams

who enter the NCAA after a two
week layoff." There is no such
layoff. Last year the Pac-10 con
cluded play on March 12 and the first
round of the NCAA Tournament
began on March 1 7.
Having waded through these ill
ads ised claims, we can now address
Berns' more substantial arguments in
support of a tournament, those re
garding money and excitement.
The money that would be made is
indeed a valid and good reason to
have a tournament, although any no
tions that the Pac-10 would make
anywhere near the kind ot money
that Davis was quoted as saying the
Big East makes are pure fantasy. The
Big Fast has outstanding teams in
New York. Philadelphia, Washington
and Boston and is one ol the best
conferences in the country. In the
Pac-10's case, the networks would
haidly be falling all over each other
for the rights to a tournament in
volving a uood but not great confer
ence.
As for excitement. Berns quotes
Davis as saying. "You'd get tremen
dous enthusiasm in late February
with a Pac-10 tournament." So what
happens in December, January and
early February? Without a tourna
ment. every game means more than it
would with a tournament, and when

games mean something, they are ex
citing.
What supporters of a post-season
tournament overlook is that the reg
ular season itself is a tournament,
one that requires of its winner all the
virtues one wants in a champion.
So in addition to the claim that a
tournament cheapens the title of
conference champion, the case
against having such an event boils
down to this: that without incentive
to do well during the regular season,
the overwhelming hulk of the
schedule goes flat. You trade three
months of excitement for three
games of it.
For all these reasons, then, I am
opposed to any type of post-season
conference play, hut as long as the in
centive to win during the regular
season is preserved some compromise
might he deemed acceptable.
For example, have all post-season
action on the home court of the reg
ular season champion.
Of course, it would still cheapen
the league title, and I will claim that
the net change in excitement would
still be negative, but then, perhaps
my mind is less evolved than I
thought.
