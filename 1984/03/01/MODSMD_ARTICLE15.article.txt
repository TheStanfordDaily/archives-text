# Are summits senseless?
## 
### 
We often hear calls for a summit meeting of American
and Soviet leaders, ranging from the practical ("Reagan
should go to Brezhnev's, Andropov's, Chernenko's? fu
neral as a polite gesture") to pure wishful thinking ("I
wish the two of them would just lock themselves in a
room and fight out all our conflicts there") Why is sum
mit diplomacy such a fascinating symbol, and is it anyth
ing more?
Suppose that tomorrow Reagan and Chernenko both
announced that they would like to get together soon to
discuss the major problems facing Soviet-American rela
tions. Would you recommend they do it? Well, you may
say, what have we got to lose? Perhaps nothing sub
stantive will come of it, but it's worth a try. Con
ceivably. though, the results might be worse than that.
First, they might not get along well personally, and it
would be sad to see relations deteriorate because of it.
It is so often said that Reagan is a likable guy that some
people apparently believe it. Chernenko, I suspect, does
not. Reagan's "focus of evil" speech probably didn't go
over well in the Kremlin, just as Reagan is bound to be
unimpressed by the tiresome propaganda tlwi.tijls jQirr,
nenko's speeches and writings. ...
Of course, warm personal relations dorft lil&ays make
for warm diplomatic relations anyway. Brezhnev
projected sincerity and a longing for peace, but visible
effects of this are hard to spot today.
There is, then, the possibility that no progress would
ensue from a summit. The resulting failure could in it
self trigger a worsening of relations. If just one side con
siders this to be to its advantage, it could easily sabotage
a summit in this way.
Assuming that neither side wishes to take the blame
for failure, they would both want to point to some posi
tive results. The best way of ensuring that a summit will
go off smoothly would be to arrange its contents in ad
vance, through lower level talks. The summit's value is
then essentially symbolic; all the substance has been
bleached from it.
This is not an unreasonable approach, when realisti
cally (or maybe cynically) viewed. The alternative, a
private meeting between two leaders in which great is
sues are decided, has unpleasant implications. First, it is
an immense burden to place on two individuals. Second,
leaders may not make the best negotiators. Not even his
fans would claim that Reagan was an expert in Soviet-
American relations, and Chernenko's foreign policy ex
perience seems equally limited. So Reagan was probably
right not to go to Brezhnev's or Andropov's funeral, for
two reasons. He was unprepared to discuss meaningful is
sues in a way which could improve relations, and there
was a possibility of embarrassing the Soviets should
there be no one man firmly in power. Finally, without
stage management in advance, such a meeting would, as
I've pointed out, risk falling short of expectations.

The foreign policies ol most countries, and particu
larly of superpowers, have a certain inertia, not readilv
overcome by individual leaders, despite their differences
of style. There is, for instance, an enormous number of
people in the United States, from all walks ol lite, who
find it in their interest to continue a massive defense
buildup, t his inertia provides some predictability in
foreign policy, hut it can be harmtul, too, as in Vietnam
and now in Central America. It also means that room for
maneuvering in negotiations with the Soviets is quite
limited, because such a crucial part of American foreign
policy cannot drastically shift overnight.

said he was "embarassed to admit" that no arms control

agreement had been achieved. He went on to say that in
both form and content his conduct of negotiations was
directed in detail from Washington. The president's po
sition is not so different. despite greater powers. When
dealing with such a complex and deliberately secretive
country as the Soviet Union, there is no choice but to
rely on experts.
One can see then that the hopes placed in personal
diplomacy like an American-Soviet summit shouldn't be
too high. It carries with it some dangers, and, if success
ful, is more an indicator of improving relations than a
catalyst for them. Ihe notable achievements of this
kind of diplomacy, such as the Camp David Accords, seem
to come about when a strong outside power, in this case
the United States, actively pressures the parties to
meet and come to an agreement. No such outside force is
now strong enough to bring Americans and Soviets to a
resolution of their problems.
When a summit does take place, it is important to re
member that it is largely a mirage. The underlying moun
tain ot low-key contacts and negotiations is where real
progress is made. I his process is painstakingly slow, un
glamorous and cautious. It is far easier, unfortunately,
to destroy good relations than to construct them.

go off smoothly would be to arrange its contents in ad
vance, through lower level talks. The summit's value is
then essentially symbolic; all the substance has been
bleached from it.
This is not an unreasonable approach, when realisti
cally (or maybe cynically) viewed. The alternative, a
private meeting between two leaders in which great is
sues are decided, has unpleasant implications. First, it is
an immense burden to place on two individuals. Second,
leaders may not make the best negotiators. Not even his
fans would claim that Reagan was an expert in Soviet-
American relations, and Chernenko's foreign policy ex
perience seems equally limited. So Reagan was probably
right not to go to Brezhnev's or Andropov's funeral, for
two reasons. He was unprepared to discuss meaningful is
sues in a way which could improve relations, and there
was a possibility of embarrassing the Soviets should
there be no one man firmly in power. Finally, without
stage management in advance, such a meeting would, as
I've pointed out, risk falling short of expectations.

The foreign policies ol most countries, and particu
larly of superpowers, have a certain inertia, not readilv
overcome by individual leaders, despite their differences
of style. There is, for instance, an enormous number of
people in the United States, from all walks ol lite, who
find it in their interest to continue a massive defense
buildup, t his inertia provides some predictability in
foreign policy, hut it can be harmtul, too, as in Vietnam
and now in Central America. It also means that room for
maneuvering in negotiations with the Soviets is quite
limited, because such a crucial part of American foreign
policy cannot drastically shift overnight.

sition is not so different. despite greater powers. When
dealing with such a complex and deliberately secretive
country as the Soviet Union, there is no choice but to
rely on experts.
One can see then that the hopes placed in personal
diplomacy like an American-Soviet summit shouldn't be
too high. It carries with it some dangers, and, if success
ful, is more an indicator of improving relations than a
catalyst for them. Ihe notable achievements of this
kind of diplomacy, such as the Camp David Accords, seem
to come about when a strong outside power, in this case
the United States, actively pressures the parties to
meet and come to an agreement. No such outside force is
now strong enough to bring Americans and Soviets to a
resolution of their problems.
When a summit does take place, it is important to re
member that it is largely a mirage. The underlying moun
tain ot low-key contacts and negotiations is where real
progress is made. I his process is painstakingly slow, un
glamorous and cautious. It is far easier, unfortunately,
to destroy good relations than to construct them.
