# Board of Trustees to debate merits of a Reagan policy center
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Left as unfinished business when the
White House and the University reached
agreement to bring the Ronald Reagan li
brary and museum to Stanford was the more
controversial question of whether an inde-

News analysis

pendently run Reagan public affairs center
will come to campus as well.
The idea of such a center, which would be a
national policy center operated by a private
foundation and located on land leased from
the University, has been bandied about as a
possible compromise for months and offi
cially backed by the White House since Janu
arv. but the Board of Trustees has yet to

consider the matter formally.
Now, however, with the matter of the li
brary and museum settled, the Board is pre
paring to weigh the merits of such an
independent center. Discussion is scheduled
for the upcoming trustees' meeting March
12 and 13, and, according to sources close to
the Board, debate is likely to be heated.
The White House, which introduced the
idea as a possible compromise after dropping
its insistence that the policy center be run
by the Hoover Institution, remains strongly
supportive, while both University President
Donald Kennedy and Board of Trustees
President William Kimball continue to say
that such an arrangement would not be ac
ceptable.
What makes this issue different, accor
ding to the sources, who spoke on condition

that they not be identified by name, is that
the Board is split: The unanimity among the
trustees, which had held in their support of a
Reagan library and museum and in their op
position to a Hoover-run center, has dis
solved over the question of an independent
center.
At last month's meeting, the sources said,
several "relatively influential" members of
the Board challenged Kennedy's and Kim
ball's position and voiced strong support of a
national center.
The sources refused to speculate on the
outcome of the Board s decision, which is ex
pected to come at the next meeting, saying
that the preliminary nature of discussion
made it too early to count votes. But it ap
pears that the question of whether an inde
pendent national Reagan policy center will

come to campus is still very much up in the
air.
The White House and those in favor of a
national center point out that already there
are a number of institutions on Stanford
land, including the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences and the Na
tional Bureau of Economic Research, that
are run by independent, private foundations.
According to Martin Anderson, a former
domestic policy adviser to Reagan who is
now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, a Reagan center would, like the others,
be non-partisan and would be devoted to the
advanced study of public policy issues.
"If you don't run it as a non-partisan cen
ter, it will fail," Anderson said, pointing out
that other existing presidential public af
fairs centers are explicitly divorced from

partisan politics.
The center would most likely be run a
President Reagan Foundation that will be
formed to coordinate fund raising for the li
brary and museum, which upon completion
will be governed by the National Archives. It
would have a small permanent staff and a
large program of visiting fellows and would
include an auditorium, meeting rooms and
guest rooms capable of handling large con
ferences.
Anderson, who last summer headed a
Hoover Institution committee that drew up
a proposal for the Hoover-run Reagan policy
center said a national center would offer the
same benefits to the University community.
It would both complement the Reagan li-
brary and museum by bringing more
researchers to them and benefit the
Stanford schools and departments by
making available the much-needed
conference facilities, he said.
Those opposed, led by Kennedy and
Kimball, have based their opposition
to the national center on the
grounds that a center formed on be
half of a public figure with a particu
lar political philosophy should not be
allowed to exist outside of normal
academic governance.
Kennedy, who reportedly first ex

pressed his skepticism about the pro
posal when Meese broached it
informally at a Dec. 7 meeting in the
White House, later articulated his
position at length in a January state
ment that focused on the concept of
academic governance.
The case of a Reagan center, Ken
nedy wrote, is not comparable with
that of the CASBS. because the lat
ter organization originated from a
charitable foundation with a history
of support for higher education and
was not associated with any doctrine
or school of thought, and the Uni
versity was given "convincing as
surances that it would be governed in
a way that incorporated the usual
standards of faculty review.

"There can be no convincing as
surances that a center (like the
Reagan center) organized indepen
dently of the University and func
tioning merely as a lessee would be
governed in accord with normal aca
demic standards." he said.

Those opposed, led by Kennedy and
Kimball, have based their opposition
to the national center on the
grounds that a center formed on be
half of a public figure with a particu
lar political philosophy should not be
allowed to exist outside of normal
academic governance.
Kennedy, who reportedly first ex

pressed his skepticism about the pro
posal when Meese broached it
informally at a Dec. 7 meeting in the
White House, later articulated his
position at length in a January state
ment that focused on the concept of
academic governance.
The case of a Reagan center, Ken
nedy wrote, is not comparable with
that of the CASBS. because the lat
ter organization originated from a
charitable foundation with a history
of support for higher education and
was not associated with any doctrine
or school of thought, and the Uni
versity was given "convincing as
surances that it would be governed in
a way that incorporated the usual
standards of faculty review.

"There can be no convincing as
surances that a center (like the
Reagan center) organized indepen
dently of the University and func
tioning merely as a lessee would be
governed in accord with normal aca
demic standards." he said.
