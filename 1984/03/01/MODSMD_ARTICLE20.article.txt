## Wild species of Cat next for hoop crew 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
Stanford Basketball Coach
Tom Davis is the first to admit
that Arizona — the Card's op
ponent tonight — is not the
kind of team that he'd prefer
to be playing right now.
The Wildcats are hot.
They've won their last four
straight games, including a 75-
67 overtime win against
Oregon and a 69-58 win over
Oregon State. Tuesday,
Arizona knocked off USC, 55-
49. pulling to sixth place in the
Pacific-10 Conference. At 9-
15 overall. 6-8 in the confer
ence. the Wildcats are just half
a game behind the Cardinal in
the Pac-10.
"You'd rather be playing
them when they are sick and
hurt," Davis said jokingly. "I'm
not proud. I'll take a win any
way I can get it.
"Arizona was good the last
time we played them but
they've improved since then.
But I think we've improved
since then too."
Stanford, IS-10 overall and
7-8 in the conference, is in a
near must-win situation if it
wants any chance at a National
Invitational Tournament
berth. The last time the two
teams played, Stanford beat
the Wildcats 74-66. In the last
six games, however. Arizona
has been shooting with devas
tating accuracy.
"It's strictly been a matter
of shooting," Arizona Coach
Lute Olsen said about the
Wildcats' turnaround. "Ever
since the Stanford game, we've
been shooting 50 percent or
better in each outing (.549 in
the last six games). It's been
strictly a matter of confi
dence."
Rebounding has been the key
to Arizona's success. The
Wildcats are one of the smaller

teams in the league yet sport
the number one rebounder in
the conference in 6-7 center
Pete Williams who is averaging
10.0 rebounds a game.
"He (Williams) has been \er\
consistent on the boards," Ol
sen said. "He's worked hard on
his balance and is strong under
neath."
Stanford guard Keith Jones
emphasized the importance of
rebounding for Stanford, par
ticularly the role of the guards
to help out on the boards. "We
aren't big enough that we can
take the guards 15 feet out."
Jones said. "We have to go in
there and get it (the ball.)"
The last time the two teams
played, Stanford had some
early problems getting its de
fensive boards and that aspect
of the game worries Davis
most.
"They have a quick front
line," Davis said. "Williams is as
quick going to the boards as
any player I've seen."
Card notes
Jones needs just one more
point to tie the Stanford
single-season scoring record of
553 which he set last year. The
Cardinal schedule has 31 games
this year, three more than last
season. Last Saturday, Jones
set a new Stanford field goal
record with 213. The old record
is 208.
Stanford forward Hans Wich
ary has regained the starting
role which he lost following his
injury prior to the Pac-10
season.
Everyone is again urged to
wear red shirts to today's
game.
The Athletic Department
will be giving out T-shirts and
giant fingers to the first 200
fans either today or against
Arizona State on Saturday,
depending on when its mer
chandise arrives.


Rod Searcey/Daily
Keith Jones may be playing his next-to-last game before a
Maples Pavilion crowd if the Card can't corral the Arizona
Wildcats. Jones can break his own Stanford season point
record of 553 points if he can sink one shot in tonight's game.
