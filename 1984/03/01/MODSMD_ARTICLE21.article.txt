# Home court's advantage(ous) in Pac-10
## 
### 
Final exams are still over two
weeks away, but Stanford's
basketball team gets its tests

early — tonight against
Arizona and Saturday after
noon against Arizona State.
Make no mistake about it.
These two games are perhaps
Stanford's biggest back-to

back contests since, well. 1942,
when it beat Colorado and
then Dartmouth to win its one
and only NCAA title.
Forty-two years later, Stan
ford is not on the verge of win
ning an NCAA title. The
Cardinal, however, is close to
doing something it hasn't done
since that 1941-42 season —
going to a post-season tourna
ment.
Win the two games against
the Arizona schools, and Stan
ford gets its first 20-win
season since 1962 and the

probable National Invitational
Tournament (NIT) berth that
comes with it. Lose them and
. . . Coach Tom Davis and his
players would rather not dis
cuss that subject.
The best part about these
next two games for Davis and
company is that both are in
Maples Pavilion — tonight at
7:30 and Saturday at 3 p.m.
And the way things have been
going in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence lately, there's no place
like home.
In last weekend's round of

games, home teams went 10-1.
Stanford and UC-Berkeley
each lost a pair at the Washing
ton schools, Oregon lost at
both Arizona schools, UCI.A
lost at USC and Arizona, and
USC and Oregon State both
lost at Arizona. The only road
winner was Oregon State,
which defeated Aiizona State
in Tempe last Thursday night.
Davis attributes much of
this sudden swing in favor of
home teams to the balance and
youth of the Pac-10. After

Stanford lost its first six con
ference games by a total of 20
points, Davis knew how
balanced the league was. And
when he took a seven-game in
league winning streak to last
place Washington State last
Thursday night — and lost
Davis knew what kind of
dividends playing at home can
pay.
"I think the younger the
team, the more of an impact it
(home-court advantage) has,"
he said. "Once you've played a
few years and been around the
league a few times, you aren't
as affected."

Stanford has two seniors in
its starting lineup, Keith Jones
and John Revelli. Beyond that,
it is a frightfully young ball
club. Arizona and Arizona
State have even more players
who got their first razors this
past Christmas.
"So, with both teams being
young, it will affect both of
them a lot." Davis said. "I
think it gives you n false sense
of confidence at home and a
false sense of insecurity on the
road."
But how much of an impact
"it" will have depends on how
large and how vocal the crowd
is.
A large, vocal crowd can
make the difference between a
hollow-sounding Maples
Pavilion and a loud-soundinn

one. And in the next two
games it can also make the dif
ference between victories over
Arizona and Arizona State,
and between going to the Ni l
and watching it on TV.
Davis and his Cardinal need
only to think back 10 games
for a case in point. That was
when they traveled to (iill
Coliseum to face the Oregon
State Beavers Jan. 5.
I.ike Stanford last weekend,
the Beavers had taken a win
ning streak up to Washington
and lost both games. They were
returning home to face a 0-5
Stanford team. The fans could
have easily put an end to
Oregon State's 60-straight
regular-season sellouts in
10,000-seat (iill Coliseum.
Thev didn't.

But that was still early in
the Pae-10 season. I~he Beavers
could have afforded a loss to
Stanford and still fared well in
league play.
Stanford doesn't have that
luxury in these two games, its
final two at home this season.
There's no tournament, let
alone tomorrow, if they do.
While the Arizona games will
undoubtedly test Stanford as a
basketball team, they will also
test another group: Stanford's
basketball fans.
And those who leave them
selves — and their tickets — at
home tonight and Saturday af
ternoon won't have Stanford
as a basketball team to blame
should it lose either game. Just
themselves.
