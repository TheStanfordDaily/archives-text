# Home court's advantage(ous) in Pac-10

Final exams are still over two
weeks away, but Stanford's
basketball team gets its tests

early — tonight against
Arizona and Saturday after
noon against Arizona State.
Make no mistake about it.
These two games are perhaps
Stanford's biggest back-to

back contests since, well. 1942,
when it beat Colorado and
then Dartmouth to win its one
and only NCAA title.
Forty-two years later, Stan
ford is not on the verge of win

Win the two games against
the Arizona schools, and Stan
ford gets its first 20-win
season since 1962 and the

probable National Invitational
Tournament (NIT) berth that
comes with it. Lose them and

The best part about these
next two games for Davis and
company is that both are in
Maples Pavilion — tonight at
7:30 and Saturday at 3 p.m.
And the way things have been

like home.
In last weekend's round of

games, home teams went 10-1.
Stanford and UC-Berkeley
each lost a pair at the Washing
ton schools, Oregon lost at
both Arizona schools, UCI.A
lost at USC and Arizona, and
USC and Oregon State both
lost at Arizona. The only road
winner was Oregon State,
which defeated Aiizona State
in Tempe last Thursday night.
Davis attributes much of
this sudden swing in favor of
home teams to the balance and
youth of the Pac-10. After
