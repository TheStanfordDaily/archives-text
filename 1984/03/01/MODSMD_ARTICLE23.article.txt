# Women face Arizona
## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
With only three games remaining this season,
the Stanford women's basketball team is still
looking for its first WCAA victory. The cagers
have probably their best opportunity to record
that win this afternoon as they host Arizona.
Stanford has had its troubles this year — the
Card is 4-21 overall and 0-11 in the WCAA —
but so have the Wildcats. Arizona is 7-17 on the
season and only 1-10 in conference play.
That one win came Feb. 4 when Stanford
visited Tucson and dropped a 58-49 decision. The
Cardinal had its chances in that contest, leading
by as many as 12 points in the first half, but
came out Hat in the second half, scoring only 13
points in the game's finai 12 minutes.
Stanford Head Coach Dotty McCrea said
that loss may give her team a little extra in
centive. "When we're watching films 1 can hear
them sighing about the things that we didn't do

in that game," she said. "I think they're a little
irritated that we didn't heat them last time."
Arizona is led by guard Kirsten Smith. The 5-5
sophomore is averaging 14 points and 4.3 assists
per contest. The Wildcats will also look toward
6-1 senior forward Linda Reinke (1 1.4 ppg, 5.7
rpg) and junior center Alicia Archie (5.6 ppg, 6.0
rpg) to complement Smith.
McCrea is confident going into today's game
and Saturday night's contest against Arizona
State. "Both these games are within our reach
to win," she said. She outlined what will he nec
essary for the Cardinal to do in these contests:
"We need better inside play and we need to have
at least three people in double figures and a
fourth right up there."
Today's game is the first part of a
doubleheader with the men's team, which also
hosts Arizona. Game time for the opener is 5:15
p.m., with the nightcap slated for 7:30 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.
