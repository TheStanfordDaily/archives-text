## 'Footloose' parallels rock 'n' roll themes of '50s 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
In the 1957 picture Don't
Knock the Rock, one of a series
of low-budget musicals worked
up to cash in on rock 'n' roll
mania, disc jockey Alan Freed
set out to prove to the uptight
elders of a middle American
town that rock was not sinful
or perilous. He staged a
pageant chronicling the history
of ballroom dancing, persuaded
his conservative adversaries
that the new variations on the
jitterbug signified no more
scandalous a rebellion against
tradition than the waltz had in
its time, and the teenagers of
the town were granted license
to revel once more in rock
music.
Don't Knock the Rock was
made for an assured adolescent
audience — the audience that
would come out to see Bill
Haley, Little Richard and the
other musicians who performed
numbers in it — and the new
Footloose has a ready-made au
dience, too: The teenagers I
saw it with had probably all
heard the title single by Kenny
I.oggins and may already have
the soundtrack album, which
includes songs by John Cougar,
DeNiece Williams and others.
And like Don't Knock the Rock,
this movie presents a point of
view with which the kids in the
theater are sure to sympathize:
A transplanted big city boy,
Ren McCormack (the astonish
ingly charismatic Kevin Bacon,
who played the troubled,
drunken Fenwick in Diner),
struggles to reinstate dancing
in a small midwestern town
that has outlawed it. The par
allel between the two films is
clearly no accident. Fifties
revivalism is the current pop
craze, and you can hear it in the
score and see it in Ren's spiffy
garb, which provokes mocking
comments from his bejeaned
classmates at Beaumont High
School. The rites of manhood
Ren is put through — a danger
ous game of chicken played
with tractors — is, of course,
an elaborate rural twist on the

way James Dean was challenged
in Rebel Without u Cause, and
when Ron triumphs over the
bully. Chuck (Jim Youngs) in
the competition, he wins the
bully's girl, Ariel (Lori Singer).
She is the daughter of the Cal
vinist minister, Shaw Moore
(John Lithgow), whose sermons
against the "obscenity" of
rock n' roll have sparked the
town ordinance against dan
cing; when Ren appears before
the town council to move for
the rescission of that
troublesome law, she arms him
with biblical passages about
the divinely condoned glories
of dancing.
The screenwriter. Dean
Pitchford, has hit upon a tan
talizing idea for a musical here,
and certainly the director, Her
bert Ross, who made Pennies
from Heaven, has the wit and
sophistication to carry it off.
The kicker in the filmmakers'
conception is that the kids
know that Rev. Moore is right
about dancing — it is sexy and
subversive, and when their par
ents forbid it, it becomes the
object of a kind of sexual lon
ging. (The joke is that the
Beaumont kids seem to get all
the actual sex they want — and
all the other illicit pleasures,
too, like drugs — though
notably the hero, Ren, refuses
to indulge in either of these ac
tivities. He doesn't even drink,
beyond the occasional beer.)
The first "number," at the
local hangout, is terribly clever
and wonderfully edited (by
Paul Hirsch): Ariel slips a
smuggled cassette into a porta
ble tapedeck on the hood of
Chuck's pick-up truck, and
everyone inside and outside the
restaurant begins to pick up
the infectious beat. Then sud
denly, an adult hand — Rev.
Moore's — snaps off the music
and the incipient number
short-circuits: coitus inter
ruptus.
Because the movie's set-up
demands very little dancing,
Ross uses the music to under
score the big action sequences

- like the tractor face-off —
and I gather the point is that
these physical confrontations,
too, substitute for the har
monious physical connection
denied to the high schoolers.
But Ross and the choreog
rapher, Lynne Taylor-Corbett,
miss two of their best oppor
tunities to crown the styliza
tion — two possible clinches.
When Ren wants to express his
frustration, he drives off by
himself, drains a beer, smashes
the bottle on the ground, and
starts to dance — sort of.
Kevin Bacon can move, and this
number should give us what we,
along with the teenagers of
Beaumont, have been craving:
a real terpsichorean explosion.
But what we get instead is an
example of the latest style in
movie musicals, the hyper
charged aggressive-athletic
non-dance featured in Flash -
dance and Slaying Alive, in
which the cutting and the
music knock out the audience
and the actual choreography
consists of trick-shot, super
human leaps and flips, exten
sive running and a lot of
sharp-angled poses. It's the
M'PV approach to dance; Flash
clance looked like every rock
video that doesn't feature Mi
chael Jackson. And since we've
been aching since the beginning
of Footloose to watch some
real dancing, this solo number
cheats us, even though we may
admire the virtuosity with
which Ross, Paul Hirsch, and
the photographer, Ric Waite,
pieced it together.
The second disappointment
comes a little later on, when
Ren drives Ariel and his other
new friends, Willard
(Christopher Penn) and Rusty
(pixieish Sarah Jessica Parker,
who has much too little to do
in this picture), out of town to
a club to show them what
they've been missing. If Ross
and Taylor-Corbett had been
alert to the possibilities of this
sequence, they might have
created a fairyland for these
kids, using choreography as

magic, but it's such an ordinary
sequence that you forget what
its connection is to the rest of
the movie.
Footloose has a much bigger
problem than the erratic
working out of its delightful
central idea, however — a
problem that finally wrecks
the film. It takes itself

seriously. Having lifted the
conflict between liberated
teen rockers and tense reac
tionary grown-ups from a
light-hearted 1950s B movie,
the filmmakers try to convince
us that it's a plausible contem
porary issue — a perspective
that is not only faintly absurd
in its own right but also at odds
with the playful tone of the
most satisfying sequences. And

to this end, they make Ariel,
the preacher's daughter, not
merely wild but self
destructive. She almost kills
herself by straddling Chuck's
pick-up and another friend's
car at high speed on a two-lane
road with a semi rolling down
the hill straight at them, and
later she plants herself in front

of an advancing train. (As the
train approaches, she screams
at the top of her lungs, com
peting with its whistle, and
says she got the idea out of a
movie she saw. The movie is
Cabaret: The filmmakers may
intend Ariel to be a juvenile
Sally Bowles.)
Lori Singer has the right at
titude for the role — a tough
ness that is both sneering and

sexually inviting — but the
movie can't support the dis
turbing implications of invent
ing such a character, and it has
no acceptable way of resolving
her behavior. In another film.
Ariel would be the kid doomed
to a violent death in the final
reel, but Footloose is a musical
comedy, and so Ross and
Pitchford attempt to in
tegrate her into this fantasy
world by suggesting that the
love of a good boy and the
power of rock 'n' roll can turn
her into a prom queen. (A clue
to the ineffectiveness of this
decision: Lori Singer looks bet
ter in her jeans and peasant
blouse than she does in a prom
dress.)
Moreover, the movie wants
to present Rev. Moore as a
complex character in whom a
bitterness over the death of
his son (in a liquor-induced car
accident some years earlier —
the impetus for the town's in
tolerance for teenage indul
gence in dancing) and a genuine
loving concern for his family
and his congregation battle. He
opposes the real fanatics in the
community, who fire a young
English instructor for teaching
Kurt Vonnegut and burn
"objectionable" books, though
Moore's sermon, which begins
the film, sounds so extreme
and so cockeyed that we
wonder who, if not the mini
ster, has spurred the watchdogs
of morality in Beaumont to
their self-appointed tasks.
In a sense, John Lithgow's
performance never recovers
from that opening scene, in
which he's made to seem so
ridiculous that we can't sub
scribe to the movie's later ef
forts to furnish him with some
depth (and some appeal). As
his wife Vi, Dianne Wiest has a
muted intensity, and there's
always something going on in
her eyes; she makes an impres
sive stab at one of those all
but-unplayable roles, the
minister's wife whose quiet
strength and greater compas
sion humanize her rigid hus

hand. (Moviegoers with long
memories may recall Julie
Andrews in this part in the
1966 Hawaii.) Her lines are
rotten with maternal wisdom.
The movie gets worse (and
more sentimental) as it goes
on, hut there are talented
people all along the way to rec
ommend it: Wiest and Sarah
Jessica Parker, and a stunt dan
cer named Peter Tramm who
executes a stunning series of
separations in the finale.
There's Bacon, whose
remarkable personality supplies
an emotional center for the
film, though his acting here
displays none of the poignant
commitment it did in Diner —
but then, the monologue de
signed to reveal Ren's inner
confusion is so incoherently
written that it practically
makes him opaque. And there's
Christopher Penn (Sean's kid
brother, who played the boy
trapped in an early marriage in
All the Right Moves), with his
rubbery jaw — he has a whole
repertoire of open-mouthed
expressions suggesting grada
tions of awe. Penn makes Wil
lard so amiable that he follows
you right out of the theater.
In the film's most ingenious
number, Ren teaches Willard
how to dance, and as his comic
ineptitude shifts into comic
self-assurance, the sequence
gathers energy. The first time
Willard dances alone, Ross
gives him a long shot: He's the
only moving object in a huge
space, and he's smack in the
center, in joyful command of
his surroundings. (Dancing
turns him into a monarch.)
Ross knows how to employ
editing and composition
dramatically in a musical num
ber, and the song, "Let's Hear
It for the Boy" (by Pitchford
and Tom Snow, sung by
DeNiece Williams), is irresis
tibly catchy. When the number
is over, you want to applaud;
you feel terrific. "Let's Hear
It for the Boy" gives us a taste
of how enchanting all of Foot
loose might have been.

but-unplayable roles, the
minister's wife whose quiet
strength and greater compas
sion humanize her rigid hus

hand. (Moviegoers with long
memories may recall Julie
Andrews in this part in the
1966 Hawaii.) Her lines are
rotten with maternal wisdom.
The movie gets worse (and
more sentimental) as it goes
on, hut there are talented
people all along the way to rec
ommend it: Wiest and Sarah
Jessica Parker, and a stunt dan
cer named Peter Tramm who
executes a stunning series of
separations in the finale.
There's Bacon, whose
remarkable personality supplies
an emotional center for the
film, though his acting here
displays none of the poignant
commitment it did in Diner —
but then, the monologue de
signed to reveal Ren's inner
confusion is so incoherently
written that it practically
makes him opaque. And there's
Christopher Penn (Sean's kid
brother, who played the boy
trapped in an early marriage in
All the Right Moves), with his
rubbery jaw — he has a whole
repertoire of open-mouthed
expressions suggesting grada
tions of awe. Penn makes Wil
lard so amiable that he follows
you right out of the theater.
In the film's most ingenious
number, Ren teaches Willard
how to dance, and as his comic
ineptitude shifts into comic
self-assurance, the sequence
gathers energy. The first time
Willard dances alone, Ross
gives him a long shot: He's the
only moving object in a huge
space, and he's smack in the
center, in joyful command of
his surroundings. (Dancing
turns him into a monarch.)
Ross knows how to employ
editing and composition
dramatically in a musical num
ber, and the song, "Let's Hear
It for the Boy" (by Pitchford
and Tom Snow, sung by
DeNiece Williams), is irresis
tibly catchy. When the number
is over, you want to applaud;
you feel terrific. "Let's Hear
It for the Boy" gives us a taste
of how enchanting all of Foot
loose might have been.


Kevin Bacon
In the 1957 picture Don't
Knock the Rock, one of a series
of low-budget musicals worked
up to cash in on rock 'n' roll
mania, disc jockey Alan Freed
set out to prove to the uptight
elders of a middle American
town that rock was not sinful
or perilous. He staged a
pageant chronicling the history
of ballroom dancing, persuaded
his conservative adversaries
that the new variations on the
jitterbug signified no more
scandalous a rebellion against
tradition than the waltz had in
its time, and the teenagers of
the town were granted license
to revel once more in rock
music.
Don't Knock the Rock was
made for an assured adolescent
audience — the audience that
would come out to see Bill
Haley, Little Richard and the
other musicians who performed
numbers in it — and the new
Footloose has a ready-made au
dience, too: The teenagers I
saw it with had probably all
heard the title single by Kenny
I.oggins and may already have
the soundtrack album, which
includes songs by John Cougar,
DeNiece Williams and others.
And like Don't Knock the Rock,
this movie presents a point of
view with which the kids in the
theater are sure to sympathize:
A transplanted big city boy,
Ren McCormack (the astonish
ingly charismatic Kevin Bacon,
who played the troubled,
drunken Fenwick in Diner),
struggles to reinstate dancing
in a small midwestern town
that has outlawed it. The par
allel between the two films is
clearly no accident. Fifties
revivalism is the current pop
craze, and you can hear it in the
score and see it in Ren's spiffy
garb, which provokes mocking
comments from his bejeaned
classmates at Beaumont High
School. The rites of manhood
Ren is put through — a danger
ous game of chicken played
with tractors — is, of course,
an elaborate rural twist on the

way James Dean was challenged
in Rebel Without u Cause, and
when Ron triumphs over the
bully. Chuck (Jim Youngs) in
the competition, he wins the
bully's girl, Ariel (Lori Singer).
She is the daughter of the Cal
vinist minister, Shaw Moore
(John Lithgow), whose sermons
against the "obscenity" of
rock n' roll have sparked the
town ordinance against dan
cing; when Ren appears before
the town council to move for
the rescission of that
troublesome law, she arms him
with biblical passages about
the divinely condoned glories
of dancing.
The screenwriter. Dean
Pitchford, has hit upon a tan
talizing idea for a musical here,
and certainly the director, Her
bert Ross, who made Pennies
from Heaven, has the wit and
sophistication to carry it off.
The kicker in the filmmakers'
conception is that the kids
know that Rev. Moore is right
about dancing — it is sexy and
subversive, and when their par
ents forbid it, it becomes the
object of a kind of sexual lon
ging. (The joke is that the
Beaumont kids seem to get all
the actual sex they want — and
all the other illicit pleasures,
too, like drugs — though
notably the hero, Ren, refuses
to indulge in either of these ac
tivities. He doesn't even drink,
beyond the occasional beer.)
The first "number," at the
local hangout, is terribly clever
and wonderfully edited (by
Paul Hirsch): Ariel slips a
smuggled cassette into a porta
ble tapedeck on the hood of
Chuck's pick-up truck, and
everyone inside and outside the
restaurant begins to pick up
the infectious beat. Then sud
denly, an adult hand — Rev.
Moore's — snaps off the music
and the incipient number
short-circuits: coitus inter
ruptus.
Because the movie's set-up
demands very little dancing,
Ross uses the music to under
score the big action sequences

- like the tractor face-off —
and I gather the point is that
these physical confrontations,
too, substitute for the har
monious physical connection
denied to the high schoolers.
But Ross and the choreog
rapher, Lynne Taylor-Corbett,
miss two of their best oppor
tunities to crown the styliza
tion — two possible clinches.
When Ren wants to express his
frustration, he drives off by
himself, drains a beer, smashes
the bottle on the ground, and
starts to dance — sort of.
Kevin Bacon can move, and this
number should give us what we,
along with the teenagers of
Beaumont, have been craving:
a real terpsichorean explosion.
But what we get instead is an
example of the latest style in
movie musicals, the hyper
charged aggressive-athletic
non-dance featured in Flash -
dance and Slaying Alive, in
which the cutting and the
music knock out the audience
and the actual choreography
consists of trick-shot, super
human leaps and flips, exten
sive running and a lot of
sharp-angled poses. It's the
M'PV approach to dance; Flash
clance looked like every rock
video that doesn't feature Mi
chael Jackson. And since we've
been aching since the beginning
of Footloose to watch some
real dancing, this solo number
cheats us, even though we may
admire the virtuosity with
which Ross, Paul Hirsch, and
the photographer, Ric Waite,
pieced it together.
The second disappointment
comes a little later on, when
Ren drives Ariel and his other
new friends, Willard
(Christopher Penn) and Rusty
(pixieish Sarah Jessica Parker,
who has much too little to do
in this picture), out of town to
a club to show them what
they've been missing. If Ross
and Taylor-Corbett had been
alert to the possibilities of this
sequence, they might have
created a fairyland for these
kids, using choreography as

magic, but it's such an ordinary
sequence that you forget what
its connection is to the rest of
the movie.
Footloose has a much bigger
problem than the erratic
working out of its delightful
central idea, however — a
problem that finally wrecks
the film. It takes itself

seriously. Having lifted the
conflict between liberated
teen rockers and tense reac
tionary grown-ups from a
light-hearted 1950s B movie,
the filmmakers try to convince
us that it's a plausible contem
porary issue — a perspective
that is not only faintly absurd
in its own right but also at odds
with the playful tone of the
most satisfying sequences. And

to this end, they make Ariel,
the preacher's daughter, not
merely wild but self
destructive. She almost kills
herself by straddling Chuck's
pick-up and another friend's
car at high speed on a two-lane
road with a semi rolling down
the hill straight at them, and
later she plants herself in front

of an advancing train. (As the
train approaches, she screams
at the top of her lungs, com
peting with its whistle, and
says she got the idea out of a
movie she saw. The movie is
Cabaret: The filmmakers may
intend Ariel to be a juvenile
Sally Bowles.)
Lori Singer has the right at
titude for the role — a tough
ness that is both sneering and

sexually inviting — but the
movie can't support the dis
turbing implications of invent
ing such a character, and it has
no acceptable way of resolving
her behavior. In another film.
Ariel would be the kid doomed
to a violent death in the final
reel, but Footloose is a musical
comedy, and so Ross and
Pitchford attempt to in
tegrate her into this fantasy
world by suggesting that the
love of a good boy and the
power of rock 'n' roll can turn
her into a prom queen. (A clue
to the ineffectiveness of this
decision: Lori Singer looks bet
ter in her jeans and peasant
blouse than she does in a prom
dress.)
Moreover, the movie wants
to present Rev. Moore as a
complex character in whom a
bitterness over the death of
his son (in a liquor-induced car
accident some years earlier —
the impetus for the town's in
tolerance for teenage indul
gence in dancing) and a genuine
loving concern for his family
and his congregation battle. He
opposes the real fanatics in the
community, who fire a young
English instructor for teaching
Kurt Vonnegut and burn
"objectionable" books, though
Moore's sermon, which begins
the film, sounds so extreme
and so cockeyed that we
wonder who, if not the mini
ster, has spurred the watchdogs
of morality in Beaumont to
their self-appointed tasks.
In a sense, John Lithgow's
performance never recovers
from that opening scene, in
which he's made to seem so
ridiculous that we can't sub
scribe to the movie's later ef
forts to furnish him with some
depth (and some appeal). As
his wife Vi, Dianne Wiest has a
muted intensity, and there's
always something going on in
her eyes; she makes an impres
sive stab at one of those all
but-unplayable roles, the
minister's wife whose quiet
strength and greater compas
sion humanize her rigid hus

hand. (Moviegoers with long

movie she saw. The movie is
Cabaret: The filmmakers may
intend Ariel to be a juvenile
Sally Bowles.)
Lori Singer has the right at
titude for the role — a tough
ness that is both sneering and

sexually inviting — but the
movie can't support the dis
turbing implications of invent
ing such a character, and it has
no acceptable way of resolving
her behavior. In another film.
Ariel would be the kid doomed
to a violent death in the final
reel, but Footloose is a musical
comedy, and so Ross and
Pitchford attempt to in
tegrate her into this fantasy
world by suggesting that the
love of a good boy and the
power of rock 'n' roll can turn
her into a prom queen. (A clue
to the ineffectiveness of this
decision: Lori Singer looks bet
ter in her jeans and peasant
blouse than she does in a prom
dress.)
Moreover, the movie wants
to present Rev. Moore as a
complex character in whom a
bitterness over the death of
his son (in a liquor-induced car
accident some years earlier —
the impetus for the town's in
tolerance for teenage indul
gence in dancing) and a genuine
loving concern for his family
and his congregation battle. He
opposes the real fanatics in the
community, who fire a young
English instructor for teaching
Kurt Vonnegut and burn
"objectionable" books, though
Moore's sermon, which begins
the film, sounds so extreme
and so cockeyed that we
wonder who, if not the mini
ster, has spurred the watchdogs
of morality in Beaumont to
their self-appointed tasks.
In a sense, John Lithgow's
performance never recovers
from that opening scene, in
which he's made to seem so
ridiculous that we can't sub
scribe to the movie's later ef
forts to furnish him with some
depth (and some appeal). As
his wife Vi, Dianne Wiest has a
muted intensity, and there's
always something going on in
her eyes; she makes an impres
sive stab at one of those all
but-unplayable roles, the
minister's wife whose quiet
strength and greater compas
sion humanize her rigid hus

hand. (Moviegoers with long
memories may recall Julie
Andrews in this part in the
1966 Hawaii.) Her lines are
rotten with maternal wisdom.
The movie gets worse (and
more sentimental) as it goes
on, hut there are talented
people all along the way to rec
ommend it: Wiest and Sarah
Jessica Parker, and a stunt dan
cer named Peter Tramm who
executes a stunning series of
separations in the finale.
There's Bacon, whose
remarkable personality supplies
an emotional center for the
film, though his acting here
displays none of the poignant
commitment it did in Diner —
but then, the monologue de
signed to reveal Ren's inner
confusion is so incoherently
written that it practically
makes him opaque. And there's
Christopher Penn (Sean's kid
brother, who played the boy
trapped in an early marriage in
All the Right Moves), with his
rubbery jaw — he has a whole
repertoire of open-mouthed
expressions suggesting grada
tions of awe. Penn makes Wil
lard so amiable that he follows
you right out of the theater.
In the film's most ingenious
number, Ren teaches Willard
how to dance, and as his comic
ineptitude shifts into comic
self-assurance, the sequence
gathers energy. The first time
Willard dances alone, Ross
gives him a long shot: He's the
only moving object in a huge
space, and he's smack in the
center, in joyful command of
his surroundings. (Dancing
turns him into a monarch.)
Ross knows how to employ
editing and composition
dramatically in a musical num
ber, and the song, "Let's Hear
It for the Boy" (by Pitchford
and Tom Snow, sung by
DeNiece Williams), is irresis
tibly catchy. When the number
is over, you want to applaud;
you feel terrific. "Let's Hear
It for the Boy" gives us a taste
of how enchanting all of Foot
loose might have been.

In the 1957 picture Don't
Knock the Rock, one of a series
of low-budget musicals worked
up to cash in on rock 'n' roll
mania, disc jockey Alan Freed
set out to prove to the uptight
elders of a middle American
town that rock was not sinful
or perilous. He staged a
pageant chronicling the history
of ballroom dancing, persuaded
his conservative adversaries
that the new variations on the
jitterbug signified no more
scandalous a rebellion against
tradition than the waltz had in
its time, and the teenagers of
the town were granted license
to revel once more in rock
music.
Don't Knock the Rock was
made for an assured adolescent
audience — the audience that
would come out to see Bill
Haley, Little Richard and the
other musicians who performed
numbers in it — and the new
Footloose has a ready-made au
dience, too: The teenagers I
saw it with had probably all
heard the title single by Kenny
I.oggins and may already have
the soundtrack album, which
includes songs by John Cougar,
DeNiece Williams and others.
And like Don't Knock the Rock,
this movie presents a point of
view with which the kids in the
theater are sure to sympathize:
A transplanted big city boy,
Ren McCormack (the astonish
ingly charismatic Kevin Bacon,
who played the troubled,
drunken Fenwick in Diner),
struggles to reinstate dancing
in a small midwestern town
that has outlawed it. The par
allel between the two films is
clearly no accident. Fifties
revivalism is the current pop
craze, and you can hear it in the
score and see it in Ren's spiffy
garb, which provokes mocking
comments from his bejeaned
classmates at Beaumont High
School. The rites of manhood
Ren is put through — a danger
ous game of chicken played
with tractors — is, of course,
an elaborate rural twist on the

way James Dean was challenged
in Rebel Without u Cause, and
when Ron triumphs over the
bully. Chuck (Jim Youngs) in
the competition, he wins the
bully's girl, Ariel (Lori Singer).
She is the daughter of the Cal
vinist minister, Shaw Moore
(John Lithgow), whose sermons
against the "obscenity" of
rock n' roll have sparked the
town ordinance against dan
cing; when Ren appears before
the town council to move for
the rescission of that
troublesome law, she arms him
with biblical passages about
the divinely condoned glories
of dancing.
The screenwriter. Dean
Pitchford, has hit upon a tan
talizing idea for a musical here,
and certainly the director, Her
bert Ross, who made Pennies
from Heaven, has the wit and
sophistication to carry it off.
The kicker in the filmmakers'
conception is that the kids
know that Rev. Moore is right
about dancing — it is sexy and
subversive, and when their par
ents forbid it, it becomes the
object of a kind of sexual lon
ging. (The joke is that the
Beaumont kids seem to get all
the actual sex they want — and
all the other illicit pleasures,
too, like drugs — though
notably the hero, Ren, refuses
to indulge in either of these ac
tivities. He doesn't even drink,
beyond the occasional beer.)
The first "number," at the
local hangout, is terribly clever
and wonderfully edited (by
Paul Hirsch): Ariel slips a
smuggled cassette into a porta
ble tapedeck on the hood of
Chuck's pick-up truck, and
everyone inside and outside the
restaurant begins to pick up
the infectious beat. Then sud
denly, an adult hand — Rev.
Moore's — snaps off the music
and the incipient number
short-circuits: coitus inter
ruptus.
Because the movie's set-up
demands very little dancing,
Ross uses the music to under
score the big action sequences

- like the tractor face-off —
and I gather the point is that
these physical confrontations,
too, substitute for the har
monious physical connection
denied to the high schoolers.
But Ross and the choreog
rapher, Lynne Taylor-Corbett,
miss two of their best oppor
tunities to crown the styliza
tion — two possible clinches.
When Ren wants to express his
frustration, he drives off by
himself, drains a beer, smashes
the bottle on the ground, and
starts to dance — sort of.
Kevin Bacon can move, and this
number should give us what we,
along with the teenagers of
Beaumont, have been craving:
a real terpsichorean explosion.
But what we get instead is an
example of the latest style in
movie musicals, the hyper
charged aggressive-athletic
non-dance featured in Flash -
dance and Slaying Alive, in
which the cutting and the
music knock out the audience
and the actual choreography
consists of trick-shot, super
human leaps and flips, exten
sive running and a lot of
sharp-angled poses. It's the
M'PV approach to dance; Flash
clance looked like every rock
video that doesn't feature Mi
chael Jackson. And since we've
been aching since the beginning
of Footloose to watch some
real dancing, this solo number
cheats us, even though we may
admire the virtuosity with
which Ross, Paul Hirsch, and
the photographer, Ric Waite,
pieced it together.
The second disappointment
comes a little later on, when
Ren drives Ariel and his other
new friends, Willard
(Christopher Penn) and Rusty
(pixieish Sarah Jessica Parker,
who has much too little to do
in this picture), out of town to
a club to show them what
they've been missing. If Ross
and Taylor-Corbett had been
alert to the possibilities of this
sequence, they might have
created a fairyland for these
kids, using choreography as

magic, but it's such an ordinary
sequence that you forget what
its connection is to the rest of
the movie.
Footloose has a much bigger
problem than the erratic
working out of its delightful
central idea, however — a
problem that finally wrecks
the film. It takes itself

seriously. Having lifted the
conflict between liberated
teen rockers and tense reac
tionary grown-ups from a
light-hearted 1950s B movie,
the filmmakers try to convince
us that it's a plausible contem
porary issue — a perspective
that is not only faintly absurd
in its own right but also at odds
with the playful tone of the
most satisfying sequences. And

to this end, they make Ariel,
the preacher's daughter, not
merely wild but self
destructive. She almost kills
herself by straddling Chuck's
pick-up and another friend's
car at high speed on a two-lane
road with a semi rolling down
the hill straight at them, and
later she plants herself in front

of an advancing train. (As the
train approaches, she screams
at the top of her lungs, com
peting with its whistle, and
says she got the idea out of a
movie she saw. The movie is
Cabaret: The filmmakers may
intend Ariel to be a juvenile
Sally Bowles.)
Lori Singer has the right at
titude for the role — a tough
ness that is both sneering and

sexually inviting — but the
movie can't support the dis
turbing implications of invent
ing such a character, and it has
no acceptable way of resolving
