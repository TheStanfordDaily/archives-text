# 'Reuben, Reuben' is disappointing but inoffensively bad

As Gowan McGland, the crapulous, randy
poet in Reuben, Reuben, Tom Conti glories in
his theatrical brogue. His hair a disobedient
black tangle speckled with white, his saucer
eyes outlandishly red-rimmed, a handker
chief flowing from his breast pocket,
McGland shambles around the women's club
house where he's been hired for a reading, his
head half-buried between his shoulders like a
curious tortoise's, his eyes darting back and
forth to survey the lay of the land while his
neck remains stiffly protected. Gowan
McGland is the first renegade Gaelic poet
we've had on screen since Sean Connery

played one in A Fine Madness in 1966, and
Conti. an actor well known 4+>~ English
audiences for his stage and television work,
gives an enjoyably hammy performance. It's
a minor turn, but an endearing one — and it
includes the funniest drunk scene since Peter
O'Toole floated across the screen in My Fa
vorite Year.
The movie itself is inoffensively bad.
Julius Epstein distilled a long 1956 novel by
Peter De Vries and a stage adaptation of it
(called Stafford) by Herman Shumlin, unfor
tunately retaining some of De Vries' first
person narrative in the form of long-winded
rhetoric in the mouth of a secondary charac

ter, Spofford (Roberts Blossom). Blossom,
who gave an appealing, laconic performance
as Paul Le Mat's irascible trucker father in
Handle with Care and was the bright-eyed old
codger who talked of having seen Bigfoot in
Close Encounters of the Third Kind, struggles
with his impossibly literary lines — and loses.
Spofford's role has been so drastically
reduced in the film, anyway, that his verbal
diarrhea seems a puzzling nuisance; he only
exists so that his granddaughter, Geneva
(Kelly McGillis), can win McGland's middle
aged, cynical heart.
If the story of the innocent young woman
who regenerates the aging, disillusioned al

coholic sounds familiar, perhaps you saw
Educating Rita, though actually, of course,
it's been around for ages — interestingly
enough, without losing its popularity as a
romantic theme. (A variation of it appears
in Vertigo.) The director of Reuben, Reuben,
Robert Ellis Miller, has surrounded McGland
with so many hapless female camera subjects
— I can't remember when I've seen such
sharp, angular faces — engaged in so much
awful acting that his attraction to Kelly
McGillis, who is beautiful and can act, seems
inevitable. But Miller, a real clod, can't think
of anything better to do with these two
than shoot lingering close-up after lingering
close-up, so that neither Conti, who has a

great deal of technique, nor McGillis, who
has none as yet, can do enough to satisfy
that greedy camera. To put it as kindly as
possible. Miller is no editor, so every comic
point is made well before he's decided to cut.
And he's way out of his depth with De Vries'
weird changes of tone, so the second half of
the picture, which is more serious than the
first, is a bit of a soapy drag, and the ending
— intended as both upbeat and black-comic
— is a fiasco. But finally, 1 had a better time
at Reuben, Reuben than I did at the Fellini
picture or A Lonely Guy, or at most of the
Christmas releases. Movies these days are
turning us all into beggars, and we know
what they say about beggars.
