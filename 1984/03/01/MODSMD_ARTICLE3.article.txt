# Departments struggle with budget cut hassles
## 
### SAM DELSON Staff writer 
The 19K4-X5 University budget
which will be submitted to the Fac
ulty Senate next Thursday is ex
pected to call lor $1.3 million in cuts
in operating expenditures.
The budget will continue a three
year $10 million cost reduction pro
gram and will mark the eighth time in
the last 10 years that University ex
penditures have not kept pace with
inflation.
University officials will not dis
close which areas will be cut until
next week. But Provost Albert Has
torf. Associate Provost Timothy
Warner and Associate Controller
1 rank Riddle said the cuts of the last
10 years have made it extremely dif

ficult to find new areas for reduc
tions.
The officials also agreed that last
year's 1.9 percent budget cut has had
measurable negative effects on some
University services.
"Things are starting to pinch a
little." Hastorf said. "My concern is
that there may well have to be cuts
all the way into 19N5-86."
Riddle agreed that there is little or
no fat in the University budget.
"Even in the current fiscal year,
most of the cuts have produced
reductions in services." Riddle said.
"We've had year after year of budget
cuts and things are pretty lean.
"I don't know how many more
(cost-saving) ideas we can come up
with." he added.
Warner emphasized that the Uni
versity is in a strong financial posi
tion. But he said it has been more
difficult to find areas to cut this
year, even though fewer cuts will be
made.
Hastorf noted that the School of
Humanities and Sciences and the
School of Engineering made several
sacrifices last year in order to balance
the 1983-84 budget.
"Humanities and Sciences gave up
some money that clearly reduced
their flexibility in regard to replacing
faculty on sabbatical and the Engi
neering School had to reduce its sec
retarial staff," he said.
l ast year's cuts were concentrated
in administrative and maintenance
areas in order to spare academic de
partments from reductions. As a
result, the campus mail, procurement
and maintenance departments all ex
perienced difficulties this year.
I he campus mail department lost a
letter carrier position, forcing it to
cut its delivery frequency from twice
to once per day.
Delivery Supervisor Douglas
Monica said the cuts have caused a
significant decrease in the quality of
his department's serv ice.
"It's false economy," Monica said.
Between 25 and 30 departments
have chosen to pay $350 each from
their own budgets to finance a
second daily delivery, Monica said,
but the majority of the 190 depart

ments have not. "Most of them are
too financially strapped themselves."
he said.
History Department Administra
tor Barbara Wawrzynski is one of
several departmental officials who
have complained about the cuts in
mail service.
"In the last year. I've written
several letters pleading tor restora
tion of the second delivery." she said.
"The large administrative centers
have just gone ahead and bought
second deliveries, hut it's a signifi
cant problem for the small depart
ments who either can't afford it or
think it's wrong in principle,"
Wawrzynski said.
Vice Provost Ray Bacchetti has ex
pressed sympathy for the incon
veniences caused by the reduced
delivery schedule, Wawrzynski said,
but there are no plans to restore the
cancelled service.
The procurement department has
also experienced difficulty in per
forming its work with a reduced
statt. Two buyers and one adminis
trative assistant, or 10 percent of
the staff, were cut last May.
1 he staff cutback, coupled with an
unanticipated 5 percent increase in
requisitions, caused the department
to fall behind this year.
"Our service level dropped and we
were unable to keep up with our work
load," said Director of Procurement
Marvin Geistlinger.
"Several programs were affected
as a result of this. For example, if we
don't acquire computers on time,
some departments can't do their re
search."
The department was able to handle
88 percent of its orders within five

days in 19N2-83. according to
Geistlinger. But only .SO percent of
the requisitions were tilled within
five days this year, he said.
Administration officials have
responded to the overload in the
procurement department by restor
ing two of the eliminated positions.
As a result, the department s suc
cess rate has increased to 85 percent.
Another area that has experienced
staff cuts is maintenance and opera
tions. The building and maintenance
budget was reduced by approximately
5 percent this year.
The cuts were a calculated risk, be
cause neglected maintenance can be
shortsighted and may actually cost
more money in the long run. Riddle
said.
James Morgan, director of Facilities
and Services, said his grounds crew has
managed to make up for staff and
funding cuts by increasing its produc
tivity.
The grounds maintenance budget
has increased only 2.4 percent during
the last two years, while the Con
sumer Price Index has gone up by ap
proximately 15 percent during the
same period, Morgan estimated. Be
cause of this, the number of full
time grounds employees was cut
from 41 to 35 this year.
"We're maintaining most of the
place really well," Morgan said, "but
there are some areas that we can't
afford to keep up."
The 1984-85 budget recommen
dations will be submitted to the Fac
ulty Senate March 8. The Board of
Trustees will consider the budget at
its March 12-13 meeting.
