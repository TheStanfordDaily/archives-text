### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
The cost of University Food Service luts risen at a rate
mice that of the Consumer Price Index over the past five
years. In this second port of a three-part series, The
Daily examines the fee-for-service alternative and its
success in Sterling Quadrangle.

lii a major attempt to combat the lapidly tising
costs of Food Service here, the University is ex
perimenting with a tee-tor-service plan in Staling
Quad - and preliminary signs seem to indicate that it
is succeeding.
In layman's terms, the tee-tor-serviee meal pro
gram is a -pav as you eat" meal plan. For example, it
students decide not to eat lunch, they don t have to
pay for it. . . . .
The price of a Food Service meal plan here is sub
stantially higher than the rate charged by many other
universities across the country. The high cost ot Stan
ford" s plan is attributed to the need to pay ott the

debts caused by the construction of Governor's Cor
ner and high labor costs.
The fee-foi-service is the key element in this year's
Sterling Quad Food Service experiment. This experi
ment incorporates many of the major recommen
dations contained in the Report of the ASSU Task
Force on University Food Service.
The first recommendation of the report called for
"a fee-for-service program in which students pay for
quantities of food they eat." The report suggested
that such a program be run as an experiment in one
dormitory.
In addition, the report recommended that "it the
program is found to be as successful as it has been at
other universities, it should be implemented campus
wide."
At Sterling Quad, students initially pay the same
price as a regular "B plan" (14 meals). Roughly two
thirds of the money is allocated to overhead costs.
The remaining one-third is turned into "food points."

For example, the pre-paid board plan at Sterling
Quad for Fall Quarter. 19K3 cost 569.5. Of this
amount. $459 was allocated to overhead and fixed
costs. The remaining S23 c ) buys 23.900 tood points
which can be used to purchase food at any and all ot

the 19 meals per week.
The plan was designed with the following goals in
mind:
• Food waste should drop.
• A greater variety of food should he available.
• Residents who eat lightly or skip meals frequently
should he able to obtain refunds for unused food
points.
• Light eaters should not subsidize heavy eaters.
Senior Gordon Heeker, co-chairman ol the ASSU
Task Force, said the task force members were pleased
that the administration has gone ahead with the ex
perimental tee-lor-serv ice plan in Sterling Quad.
"Although there are parts of the Sterling Quad ex
periment which we feel could he improved upon, we
are pleased that the administration is working
toward?- change." Meeker said.
