Mondale challenges Hart
Birmingham, Via — Walter Mondale, shaken out of his
campaign caution by the voters of New Hampshire, chal
lenged Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) yesterday to "compete
with me head-to-head" in all southern primaries and
caucuses.
Mondale directly challenged Hart yesterday for the first
time in the campaign as he sought to rebound from his
resounding defeat by Hart in the nation's first 1984 pri
mary.
Mondale hopes his presidential prospects will be born
again in the South. And as he whirled through Atlanta and
Birmingham, he took on his "New Generation" nemesis.
"This morning. Senator Hart said he might actively con
test only one southern state," Mondale told an Atlanta
news conference.
" I hat's not good enough. Over 60 percent of all southern
delegates will be chosen over the next three weeks. In my
opinion, a potential presidential nominee of the Demo
cratic Party cannot write off a major part of our country.
"If Mr. Hart wants to be our national nominee, he should
join me here and actively contest these primaries and
caucuses. The Democrats of the South deserve that
respect."
He repeated his challenge to Hart at a similar event in
Birmingham.
Mondale's strategists still hope he will win in the nor
thern "Super Tuesday" contests, including Massachusetts
and Washington state, as well as in the South. But they
seemed particularly pleased that he had decided to take on
Hart by name.
"That's some gauntlet he's thrown down for Hart," said
one Mondale adviser, who explained the strategy behind
Mondale's challenge.
"If Hart comes down South, that's one other place up
north where he can't be campaigning against us — and if he
comes down South, he can't win."
Soviets veto U.N. Beirut force
I nited Nations — Denouncing what he called "crude mili
um blackmail" against Lebanon by the United States, So
viet Ambassador Oleg Troyanovsky yesterday vetoed
I ranee's proposal to install U.N. peacekeeping troops in the
Beirut area.
The United States and 12 other members of the 15-
nation Security Council voted for the proposal, which had
been endorsed by the non-aligned group of states. Only the
Ukraine supported Troyanovsky, who had declared his oppo
sition before the vote on the grounds that the United
States had refused to guarantee its future non
intervention in Lebanon.
U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who said she had re
luctantly accepted the draft resolution's call for the
removal of all contingents of the multinational force from
Lebanon and its territorial waters, accused Troyanovsky of
"sowing hate, watering it with lies and harvesting violence."
Both French Ambassador Luc de la Barre de Nanteuil and
Kirkpatrick said they would continue to work for some kind
of U.N. presence in the Beirut area despite the Soviet ac
tion.
Inouye against Salvador aid
unless death squads are curbed
Washington — A key Senate Democrat called yesterday
for a total aid cutoff to El Salvador unless there is a halt to
death-squad killings and rampant corruption there, and a
key Republican senator said she would oppose proposed aid
increases to that country without assurances the funds
would be spent properly.
Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) a senior member of the
Intelligence and Appropriations committees, and Sen.
Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) were among several
foreign-policy moderates issuing storm warnings to the
White House on the eve of Congress' first votes on the
massive package of economic and military aid the adminis
tration is seeking for Central America.
Among other things, these moderates warned the admin
istration against any effort to provide further military help
to LI Salvador without going through the congressional ap
propriations process.
The Reagan administration is asking for another $178
million in military aid to El Salvador this year as part of an
$8.9 billion five-year package of economic and military as
sistance to the region.
In a toughly worded speech to the Senate, Inouye said ad
ministration policies in Central America "have served to
encourage those who would seek to quell by force the urges
of freedom and dignity" and have heightened tensions in
the region.
Economy shows growth signs
Washington — The index of leading indicators, the chief
gauge of the U.S. economy's future course, rose 1.1 percent
m January, its strongest performance in three months and a
sign of continuing economic expansion, the Department of
Commerce reported yesterday.
But the heartening news about the leading indicators was
marred by a separate Department of Commerce report
showing that the nation's merchandise trade deficit hit a
record $9.5 billion in January.
"One of the major imbalances in this recovery continues
to be the disastrous performance of the United States in
international markets." said Jerry Jasinowski, chief econo
mist of the National Association of Manufacturers.
January's 1.1 percent increase in the index of leading in
dicators — the biggest monthly gain since 1.4 percent in
October — was paced by a surge in building permits and by
marked improvement in the average work week and
manufacturers' orders for consumer goods.
The report was a rebuff to economists who had feared
that, after November's dip in the leading indicators and
December's slight increase, the pace of economic recovery
might slow significantly later this year.
President Reagan said January's leading indicators were a
sign that "this recovery isn't about to fizzle — it'll keep
going strong. So send away the hand-wringers."
But Reagan did not mention the economy's dismal per
formance in international markets. The merchandise trade
deficit in January was the largest monthly shortfall since
the $8.4 billion deficit posted in October.

phone stocks also rose.
