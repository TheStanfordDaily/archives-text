## Gemayel meets with Syrian president

From the Los Angeles Times
Beirut, Lebanon — President Amin Gemayel Hew
to Damascus yesterday tor talks with Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad, and it appeared that cancellation
of Lebanon's troop-withdrawal and seenrit\ agree
ment with Israel may be close.
Gemayel. whose army and people are deeply divided
along religious lines, was given a 21 -gun salute and the
rest of the ceremony accorded heads of state when
his jet landed in Damascus. However, it seems clear
that he has lost his effort to preserve the agreement,
which was signed last May 17. and his trip to the
Syrian capital seemed to symbolize Lebanon's return
to the Arab fold after IS months of depending on
the United States for help in unraveling its tangle of
troubles.
Assad has demanded that Gemayel abrogate the
agreement and it is understood that his objections in
volved both the simple fact that Lebanon, an Arab
country, had signed any agreement with Israel and the
section of the pact that treated Syria the same way
it treated Israel in its call for withdrawal ot foreign
troops from Lebanese soil.
Israel made clear when it signed the agreement that

it would not withdraw its troops from occupied
southern Lebanon until Syria removed its forces from
northern and eastern Lebanon. Neither country has
removed its armies from this country.
Even as Gemayel conferred with Assad and other
high-ranking Syrian officials, the crash of artillery
tire reverberated throughout Beirut as the Lebanese
army and Moslem militiamen fought in the mountains
near Beirut and along the Green Line that divides the
capital. The mountain battles have been going on
since last September, while fighting along the Green
Line was renewed in early February. The city fighting
culminated in the takeover of West Beirut by
militiamen Feb. 6.
Meanwhile, a car bomb exploded in a residential
neighborhood of West Beirut. Police reported one
killed and at least 20 wounded in the bombing. A Red
Cross worker at the scene said a blue BMW was rigged
as a bomb and parked between two buildings.
In another development. Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger visited ships of the U.S. 6th Fleet,
cruising just off the Lebanese coast, and chatted
with some of the U.S. Marines who had been in
Lebanon as part of the multinational peacekeeping

force on dut> here but were w'lhdrawn to the ships
