From the Los Angeles Times
Toronto â€” Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
Canada's controversial and charismatic
leader for nearly all of the last 16 years,
announced yesterday that he would
resign as prime minister as soon as his
Liberal Party selects a replacement.
In a letter to party President lona
Campagnolo, the 64-year-old Trudeau
said, "The experience of being leader of
our great party has been one of the
great joys of my life, but 1 now feci this
is the appropriate time for someone
else to assume this challenge."
Trudeau's decision was also
prompted, no doubt, by the fact that
his government is now one of the most
unpopular in Canadian history. The
most recent Gallup Poll indicates that
the Liberal Party is supported by only

-32 percent of Canada's voters, while
the main opposition party, the Progres
sive Conservatives, is backed by 52 per
cent.
In spite ol yesterday's
announcement, Trudeau will continue
in office for several months. Campag
nolo said the party will not be able to
organize a convention to select a new
leader until late June.
Under Canada's parliamentary sys
tem, the party controlling the House of
Commons selects the prime minister,
not the voters. Until there is a national
election, which must be held before the
end of 1984, the Liberals will stay in
power despite their apparent un
p op ul a rity.
Although there now appears to be
little likelihood of a Liberal victory in

the next election, there are at least
seven candidates to succeed Trudeau as
head of the party. The favorite is John
Turner, a Toronto businessman who
resigned as finance minister in 1975 in a
dispute with Trudeau over wage and
price controls.
Trudeau's political decline is attrib
uted to economic policies that wavered
between hard-line nationalism and a
more liberal, free-market system, nei
ther of which coped successfully with
the recent world recession. Canada still
suffers from almost 13 percent un
employment and an inflation rate ol
nearly 6 percent. Trudeau is largely
blamed for those conditions.
Even some of the accomplishments
of which Trudeau is most proud, partic
ularly Ins effort to promote French-

Hnglish bilingualism and his successful
opposition to an independence move
ment in French-speaking Quebec,
generated controversy and personal at
tacks on him.
Following a tradition established by
earlier prime ministers, Trudeau took a
role in international politics tar out of
proportion to the si/eot C anada's pop
ulation. and he did it in a fashion that
often angered other Western nations,
particularly the United States.
He once said the United States was a
greater threat to peace than the Soviet
Union and. in his recent peace initia
tive, questioned American nuclear
strategy, implying that President
Reagan was unnecessarily harsh in his
anti-Soviet statements.
