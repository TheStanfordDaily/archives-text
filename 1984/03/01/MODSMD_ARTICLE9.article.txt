## KOHNHED 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer 
A pink tutu and a conehead
are not the usual attire for
most Stanford students, but
then Jim Kohn, the new drum
major of the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band, has challenged not only
more conservative views of
dressing but also conservative
views of the role of the Band
here.
Kohn, a junior majoring in
linguistics, noted the affect of
the recent conservative politi
cal trend on the band. "The
band started in the '60s in the
form it's in now. Politically,
things are more conservative
now. We are at the other end
of the cycle."
And this conservativism has
affected the way in which
people see the Band, according
to Kohn. "We're not getting
any hate mail . . . That's really
bad," Kohn lamented. '"We
don't want everyone to love us
and it's getting dangerously
close."
In order to bring some of
that controversial spark back
into the Band. Kohn has made
himself an example. His crazy
antics, well-known to Stanford
students, along with his new
crew-cut which "will shock
people and make them sec how
conservative we're getting."
have already set the tone for
the Band.

Although Band Manager Ben
Langlotz, who chose Kohn for
his new position, disagreed
that the Band has gotten more
conservative over the past two
years, he did agree that the
Band has gotten less "hate
mail" lately. But Langlotz at
tributes this to the improved
quality of the music rather
than conservatism. "Once in a
while you see some criticism in
the Stanford Observer from
someone in the class of '22 ...
but the criticism has really
decreased because the quality
has improved and that's some
thing that even an old Stan
ford alum can respect,"
Langlotz said.
According to Assistant
Manager Scott Gode, "The
drum major has to be wild and
has to be in touch with the
Band."
Mellophone section leader
Andy Switky confirmed that
Kohn has that wildness.
"Anyone who would be on na
tional TV wearing a tutu and a
conehead, when he doesn't
even have the legs for it, is
pretty crazy," Switky said.
Stanford students will re
member Kohn as one of the
first of the exuberant Band
members to run onto the field
during "The Play" at last year's
Rig Game. "I wanted to be the
iirst on the I'ieJd and I was Ml
about the 30-yard line when I
realized the play wasn't over. 1

felt really bad." In order to
vindicate the honor of the
Band, Kohn was also the Band
member who tackled a USC"
band member this fall during
halftime when the USC band
re-enacted "The Play" before a
crowd of still sensitive Stan
ford supporters.
Although the Band is re
quired to get its halftime
shows approved by the Athlet
ic Department. Kohn said that
there is still room for fun. "We
still put Hoover Tower on the
field and claim it's Hoover
Tower and we still drop our
pants, but there's nothing
wrong with that," he said.
Kohn is preparing for his role
as drum major in several ways.
"I'm taking ballet but that has
nothing to do with my tutu,
Kohn claimed. He is also taking
a jazz class and gymnastics.
Kohn uses the gymnastics class
to "keep stretched-out" al
though he jokes that he's
"really not built for it, being 6-
3 and weighing 88 pounds.
Aside from his tutu and
conehead. Kohn also has a
costume maker in his
hometown of St. Louis
working on a variety of
costumes for him. With
respect to his predecessors,
though, Kohn said, "Disco
(Ray Grunewald) had his
lightning bolt and Simon
(Streets) had his javelin, but 1
don't want to have one thing.

People shouldn't be expecting
the same thing from the drum
major or the Band."
But Kohn does have one
thing we can expect. "I always
wear my sunglasses because
that makes me feel like I can
do anything. It gives me some
anonymity," Kohn said.
Along with the craziness
there is another crucial ele
ment to the Band — that
something which brings the
crowd to its feet as it rocks the
stadium — and that, of course,
is the music. Although fans
may not realize the time and
effort it takes to play "All
Right Now" perfectly every
time, Kohn is fully aware of his
responsibilities. "I think
anybody can just bop around in
front of the Band . . . but I'm
responsible for how we sound,"
Kohn said.
And despite his antics there
has to be a balance. According
to Langlotz, "When he's not in
the spotlight Jim is a very care
ful. thinking person." Kohn's
room at 353 Campus Drive
represents this balance. The
neatly-framed Picasso and
Rothko prints make an inter
esting contrast to the
cardboard conehead which lays
on the floor, while the band
music coming from the stereo
seems to tie it all together.
"The music comes first.
That's where you draw the
line," Kohn said. The choice of
music, finding arrangements
suited to the Band and the
rehearsals are all part of
Kohn's duties.
In choosing music for the
Band, Kohn relies on the old
favorites and his gut reactions.
"If 1 can picture the Cal band
playing a song then I don't
think we should play it, " Kohn
said. There are also problems
trying to play popular songs be
cause the Band cannot always
reproduce the same sounds.
"It's hard to make a tuba
sound like a bass and brass
sound like guitars," Kohn
added.
All the arrangements for the
Band are done by students or
by Music Prof. Arthur Barnes.
Kohn himself is presently
working on an arrangement
even though Kohn said it is not
really necessary that the drum
major do so.
But inipro\ing the quality of
the Band is important to

Kohn. "The first part of my
strategy in making the Band
sound better is not to play
myself," Kohn said. A second
part of Kohn's strategy in
volves familiarizing himself
with all aspects of the music.
"There's a tape of band music
in the tape recorder now. It
helps me to listen to it so I

don't jump up to cut it off at j
the wrong time," he said.
Kohn also stressed the im
portance of knowing what to
play when. "There's an art to
choosing songs . . . it's like a
disc jockey. You have to be
able to capture the mood of
the crowd." he said.
"I think drums are the core,"
Kohn stated. The cadences
that the drums play are often
very challenging because the
time signature is constantly
changing. Several of this year's
drummers will be leaving next
year and section leader Bart
Garton is retiring from his po
sition. This has forced Kohn to
take drastic measures in order
to recruit new percussion tal
ent.
"1 partied last night when I
should have been studying be
cause there was a drummer
from a campus band who was
partying and I wanted to get
him in the Band," Kohn ad
mitted.
Kohn hopes to attract
musicians of all sorts during

spring quarter when anyone can
play, in preparation for audi
tions fall quarter before foot
ball season.
The spring Band will
participate in several campus
rallies as well as the San Fran
cisco Black and White Ball, the
Bay to Breakers run. Splendor
on the Grass, the Donner

Street Party and Aqua Follies.
Two years ago there were
several ringers in the Band.
These were the people who
played on trash can lids, street
signs and anything else handy.
"We really decided we can't
have that if we want to keep
the quality up. . . it's not fair
to the people who put all the
time in and then all the extra
people show up for the fun
things," Kohn explained.
Kohn hopes to recapture the
spontaneity of the ringers
through the regular Band
members. "1 wish more people
would wear tutus or something
else they were comfortable
with. The Band is visual too . . .
people should know the music
so they can go out and have a
good time . . . People join the
Band to go wild," Kohn said.
Kohn's own introduction to
the Band and musical back
ground should be encouraging
to other potential musicians.
"I heard the Band playing at
Branner during freshmen orien
tation and I wanted to be in it

That was the first time I was
aware there was a band like
that here — like that
anywhere." Kohn recalled. "1
didn't make red vest band
freshman year. " he added.
Kohn, a tenor saxophone
player, switched from alto to
tenor to meet a new group of
people. "Each section has a
separate personality," he said.
Kohn never took saxophone
lessons. "1 taught myself but I
had played clarinet so it was
pretty easy switching," Kohn
said.
The man with the tutu does,
however, have another side.
Just as his role as drum major
calls for balancing comedy and
seriousness so does his role as
an ASSU senator. Kohn was
chairman of the Student Af
fairs Committee last quarter.
•"I was thinking about resigning
as a senator but I want to stay
in so that I can vote respon
sibly. I want to vote to put
K/SU on the ballot. It didn't
make it the first time. The
vote on the Band is coming-up
... I won't get to vote on it
though," Kohn said.
Kohn said. "A lot of people
don't do anything but go to
meetings and argue over the
rules. They change the rules
and then don't do anything
with them. but I lint's not why.
I'm there. I want to look out
for students' interests and
continue the . SSU
services. . .Most of wha we do
is done outside the meetings, in
the committees, and 'hat's
where it should be done.' sohn
added.
Although Kohn says he's
"not talented enough to be an
instrumentalist," he does hope
to continue his music in some
capacity after leaving Stan
ford. Kohn plans to stop-out
fall quarter and take a lighter
course load in the spring.
Kohn's excitement about his
new position is obvious. His
abiltiy to combine excitement,
craziness and responsibility
would appear to prepare him
well, but the real test will come
next year, when the music
plays, the show starts and the
crowd begins cheers to the
familiar strains of "All Right
Now" once again.
