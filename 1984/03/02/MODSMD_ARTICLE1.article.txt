# University on way to cutting food costs
## 
### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
The cost of University hood Service
has risen at a rate twice that of the
Consumer Price Index during the
past five years. In this final part of a
three-part series, The Daily ex
amines the potential for lowering
the cost in the future.

When the ASSU Task Force on
University Food Service released
its report in June 19X2, it included
five major recommendations and
twelve minor recommendations
for reducing the cost of student
meal plans.
While the University is cur
rently experimenting with several
ot the report's major points, ad
ministrators have yet to imple
ment other recommendations
which the task force said could
immediately reduce the cost of
food service.
For example, the implementa
tion of the fee-for-service plan at
Sterling Quad may bring students
savings pf up to $300 on their
yearly meal plan costs. Still, costs
appear high in comparison with
private-sector alternatives.
Upon initial inspection, the
food price (in points) is roughly
equal to the price paid at a local
grocery store. But when overhead
and fixed costs are added on, the
Sterling Quad price is approxi
mately three times higher than
Safeway, and 25 to 75 percent
higher than McDonald's.
Responding to the latter com
parison, Ed Scoles, Housing and
Food Service management direc
tor, said that McDonald's can
charge lower prices because its
labor lorce is not unionized.
"They have a simple menu. The
quality of food is lower at
McDonald's," Scoles said.
Council of Presidents member
Pete Spivack said that while he is
optimistic about a fee-for-service
plan, he is still concerned about

the high cost of University Food
Service.
"I think it's a big problem. It's a
cost that doesn't need to be so
high," he said. However, Spivack
said that in order to reduce costs,
structural changes are needed in
the way Food Service is operated.
Members of the ASSU Task
Force expressed a similar reaction.
Senior Gordon Hecker, co
chairman of the task force, said,
"We're generally pleased with the
reaction we've received from the
administration. All of the major
recommendations have been
carefuly considered."
Nonetheless, Hecker said he has
the feeling that "people are still
concerned about the prohibitive
cost of food service."
According to Hecker, the ad
ministration could save substan
tial amounts of money by

adopting more of the recommen
dations contained in the group's
1952 report. These include:
• Requiring students to eat a min
imum of 10 (rather than 14) meals
per week in the dorms.
• Considering hiring private con
tractors to manage and operate
the Food Service program.
• Switching all University
operated row houses to self-ops.
• Streamlining the recycling
process by separating and flatten
ing cardboard wastes.
• Allowing students to stack and
sort their own dishes.
• Permitting students to serve
themselves all courses except for
the main entree as long as the all
you-can-eat program is continued.
• Requiring managers to eat with
students in the residences at least
twice a week.
If students could stack their

own dishes, for example, Meeker
said that both labor costs and
food waste could be decreased.
In spite of the potential
benefits. Food Service administra
tors appear reluctant to imple
ment this proposal for aesthetic
reasons. "I just don't agree with
that," responded Maxine Ander
son, manager of University Food
Service. "I think it's kind of a
messy thing to be done in the
dining room.
With regard to the 10-meal
plan, Anderson said, "it is not
financially feasible to do that in
large dorms."
She also said that kitchen
managers might not have the time
to eat in student residences twice
a week.
"1 think they do the best they
can. They have a lot of Food Ser
vice responsibilities.
