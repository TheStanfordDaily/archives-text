Last Tuesday, the Nicaraguan Sandinistas an
nounced that they would hold elections for a
president and constituent assembly on Nov. 4 of
this year — two days before our own presiden
tial election — instead of the previously sched
uled 1985 date. Upon hearing this news the
Reagan administration immediately halted the
"covert" war against Nicaragua and opened cor
dial relations with the Sandinista government,
right?
Wrong.
The following day. Secretary of State George
Shultz continued his criticism of the Sandinis
tas, voicing doubts that "fair" elections would
be held. Furthermore, he refused to say that the
United States would stop supporting the Con
tras. the Nicaraguan insurgents, it the Sandinis
tan power is confirmed in the election.
Shultz's comments, though distressing, are in
no way unexpected. The Reagan administration
has shown consistent animosity toward the San
dinista government. For more than three years,
the administration has portrayed the
Nicaraguan leadership as illegitimate and
totalitarian. In fact, if our only source of news
was the administration's rhetoric (as per the in
vasion of Grenada), we would have no indication
that ever since August 1980 — only a year after
their revolution — the Sandinistas have been
promising elections in 1985.
When we compare this six-year span with the
12 years between 1776 and 1788. the year the
United States had its first election, the

Nicaraguans have "stalled" only hall as long as
we did.
Sluilt/ is also uneasy that the Sandinistas plan
to lower the voting age from IN to 16. He
remarks that he knows of no other country with
a voting age of 16. This may indeed seem odd at
first. But when we consider Nicaragua's
demographics — about half of its population is
below the age of 17 — and the fact that the
revolution was fought, and continues to be
defended today, by men in their teens, the
voting reform seems justified. We lowered our
own voting age to IS partly on the grounds that
a person shouldn't have to die defending a na
tion in which he can't vote.
It is true that the Sandinistas still censor the
press. To this practice we remain firmly
opposed. But before we judge too harshly, we
should remember that nations at war tend to do
paranoid and irrational things, such as putting
citizens of Japanese descent into concentration
camps.
We hope the Sandinistas hold a fair and open
election this November. We hope they allow op
position parties equal opportunity to campaign
and equal access to the media. We hope they
abide by the result of the election regardless of
its turnout.
By the same token, we once again call for an
immediate halt of the "secret" war and hope
that after the November elections, the Ameri
can president, whoever he may be, will initiate
friendly relations with the Nicaraguan leader
ship. regardless of its makeup and ideology.
