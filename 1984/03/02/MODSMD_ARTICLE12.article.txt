## Issue of governance hides real Hoover question 
### 
A university-connected think tank with a
political bent represents a problem for any
university.
One does not have to be a liberal to under
stand this principle. Last spring, before the
Reagan library complex was even announced,
<S4 faculty members and 1500 students, who
can hardly see all issues alike, expressed their
concerns about Hoover's political activities
by signing petitions that called for an inde-
VIEWPOINT
pendent inquiry and a public report on the
relationship between Hoover and the Uni
versity.
These petitions 'WcrriT bvooghf 'after
Hoovers own Annual Reports revealed the
Institution's extensive political connections
and activities, causing many people on
campus to wonder whether, as the petition
said, the existence of Hoover at Stanford is
compatible with the "academic indepen
dence, integrity and national reputation of
the University."
As seen by the University administration
and Board of Trustees, however, the prob
lem of Hoover is not that it is political.
Politics has nothing to do with it. The prob
lem is, rather, one of governance and ap
pointments.
As usual, the definition of the problem
dictates the solution. Having defined the
problem not as Hoover's political activities
but as essentially administrative, the admin
istration and the trustees logically ap
pointed a five-person trustee committee on
Hoover. This committee not only failed to
include any faculty and student representa
tives as members; it also defines and ad
dresses a problem that misses the central
concerns that have in fact been raised about
the Hoover Institution.
Still, the administration's plan has strong
support as a reasonable response to a diffi
cult situation. Win not simply accept it and
forget about what we see in Hoover's
reports?

For two reasons.
First, the problem with the Hoover Insti
tution is that it is political.
Second, on matters of such fundamental
importance to the University, the Stanford
community has a right — and a duty — to
voice its concerns and questions in public
hearings before a responsible decision
making body, and this has yet to be provided.
It is. of course, ironic that we, as members
of an academic community, have to ask to
participate in decisions so profoundly impor
tant to the community's life and collective
reputation. One might have thought that
upon the first request the administration
would have provided a proper forum for
public debate and discussion.
BuT let Vis f coi} cent rate' \>n the central
charge, namely, that Hoover is political.
The Hoover Institution would have us
look at all the many things it is and does, and
not look at its political side.
We can all agree that Hoover is a fine li
brary and center for advanced study, but
pick up a copy of its 1981, 1982 or 1983 An
nual Report and you will see there impressive
evidence of its national political connec
tions. You will read about its efforts to in
fluence public opinion through an op-ed
program that, since 1977. has placed some
700 "Hoover essays" in newspapers all over
the country. You will learn of the impor
tance of Hoover research to the policies of
national political leaders. You will see state
ments such as W. Glenn Campbell's declara
tion in the 1981 Annual Report that "The
highlight of the past year was the election
of honorary fellow Ronald W. Reagan as
President of the United States" (p. 11).
And you will see Hoover claim with under
standable pride that since January 1981
more than 40 scholars and former fellows
have lent their services to the national gov
ernment (1983 Annual Report, p. 14).
In addition to the reports, the recent col
laborative effort of Hoover and the White
House to force Hoover control of the pro
posed Reagan center for public affairs,
thereby screening out the faculty, revealed

the political objectives of Hoover so clearly
that even the administration and trustees
balked.
In the face of such strong evidence, how
can anyone claim that the problem of
Hoover is not political? Let us say for the
sake of discussion that this evidence es
tablishes only a prima facie case that part of
Hoover is political. Why should only part of
a political think tank be of such serious con
cern to the Stanford community?
We all know the answer to this question.
It is that universities are supposed to be
politically independent, nonpartisan and ob-

If none of these committees asks the fundamental question
about Hoover - is it the leading conservative think tank in
the country, and is it compatible with the nature of the
University? - then we will have consciously decided against
facing the most crucial question of all about Hoover: should
it, as a political organization, be here at all?

jective. Above all, they are not supposed to
lend their resources and their good name to
partisan political causes, and if they violate
this injunction they do so at the risk ol their
reputation.
Again, one does not have to be liberal or
anti-Hoover to see this. A member of the
conservative Chicago Tribune's editorial
board. Stephen Chapman, sees the point of
our definition of the Hoover problem
compared to the administration's when he
writes, "The institute, serving obvious poli
tical purposes and free of academic supervi
sion. is an anomaly of the sort that no
first-class university can blithely ignore."
Precisely. And so. despite all the good
reasons to accept the administration's defi
nition of the problem, and not ask the fol
lowing question, we must ask:
If the Hoover Institution is what it is, what is
it doing on a college campus?
We can all understand the administra
tion's wish that we leave such matters to
them. Administrative control is as natural

to them as community discussion should be
to us. Kennedy has announced his path, the
trustee committee on Hoover is at work
strengthening the ties between Hoover and
Stanford, and public hearings before a visit
ing committee would be a bother.
But when the Board of Trustees sets up a
committee on Hoover and declares its pur
pose as the strengthening of relations be
tween the two institutions, that prejudges
the issue in Hoover's favor. To define the
problem of Hoover in terms of governance
presupposes Hoover's continued existence,
and it is precisely its continued existence at

Stanford as a political organization that
many members of the Stanford community
think should be debated on this campus.
We are not surprised that the administra
tion rejects our definition of the problem,
for if they saw the issue of Hoover as we do
they would have to entertain solutions that
they do not want to consider. The issue of
governance clouds the issue of severance.
But we ask, it Hoover is. as the press al
most universally says it is, the leading conser
vative think tank in the country, can such an
institution be well governed within the
framework of a university? We do not have
in Hoover a case of many individual profes
sors going to work in Washington. We have
in Hoover an undeniably partisan think tank.
This distinguishes the situation at Stanford
from that of Harvard in the 19605, and
poses for us a very different question.
Once these questions have been asked
publicly in an academic community they will
not die until they are answered. Issues of
governance may deflect attention from

them for a time, hut they will rise again. This
suggests that they should he attended to,
properly and expeditiously.
We believe our petition cannot he fairly
described as a cure seeking a disease. To do so
has the unfortunate if unintended effect of
trivializing the concern of many members of
the University community. It does not meet
an argument, it merely dismisses it.
We also believe that the petition offers
the best practical way for the Stanford com
munity to voice its concerns to the admini
stration over the continuation of Hoover's
political activities. If nothing is done it
seems certain that Hoover will continue as
the country's lt/ading ( conservative think
tank, t to the detriment, perhaps,
lord's reputation us a first-rate university.
We know that President Kennedy and the
Board of Trustees are handling this problem
according to their best judgment as to what
is best for Stanford. They have appointed
the trustee committee on Hoover, which
plans to appoint yet another committee to
advise them on questions of governance and
appointments at Hoover. All of these ef
forts show the administration's good faith.
But if none of these committees asks the
fundamental question about Hoover — is it
the leading conservative think tank in the
country, and is it compatible with the nature
of the University? — then we will have con
sciously decided against facing the most cru
cial question of all about Hoover: should it,
as a political organization, be here at all?
As members of the Stanford community,
we all confront the problem of what specifi
cally to do about Hoover. The petition may
not be the best possible device for expressing
the community's views, but it is a concrete
way of doing it. In any case, it offers you the
opportunity to support a full and open
public discussion on all the essential issues
that have been raised by the Hoover debate.
