# President, movie star: which is which?

### 
A conversation overheard while
standing in a grocery checkout line:
"Hey man. how/ it going?"
"I'm okay, but I haven't seen you
in a while though. Are you still too
busy to breathe?"
"Maan. you know it! I tell ya Jim.
sometimes I just don't know."
"Ahh. it'll turn out somehow, it al
wavs does I suppose. So what doya
think about the election? Have you
decided?"
"Yeah. I decided. I decided that 1
don't care! Never seem to get ahead
no matter who's in power. Democrat.
Republican, in betweens — all ol em
ni) good. I couldn t hardly eat
before and I can't hardly eat now. My
rent's due. my heat's due. every
thing's due.and I don't know what to
do! It's rough on a working man these
days. Yessirree it is rough. I hate to
even think of the man out of work.
Me and my family just do scrape by
on what I make. Its really terrible on
a family when the man's not working.
Man. politics ain't tor me.
"Paul, it you don't vote, how do
vou even expect things to get any
better? You gotta tell the people
what vou think and how you I eel.
Show what you think by your vote.
Stand up and be counted! The vote is
the power man. we've got to get
people who care into otlices and vote

these other clowns out. Believe me
when I tell you. it's power becai»c
"Yeah, it's power all right — power
tor 'em who already got it. Every
time I turn around the fine people up
in Congress are being forced to vote
themselves another pay raise! Ain't
the cost ol living something!? I don't
see how they could make it on a
measly $50,000 or $60,000 in the
first place."
"But Paul — "
"Wait a minute, that ain't all.
Every time I close my eyes and open
'em up again, the president or
Congress has got to take a vacation,
after they already had big long
recesses. Being a politician is power
ful hard work, nothing like working
on a dock or in «i lactory."
"Well, it you really feel that way.
von should vote against them 111 No
vember. I'm so sick of hearing about
this dropping one-tenth ol one
percentage point, or about that
going up a quarter ol a point. I m sick
of hearing it. people in Appalachia.
Watts, the barrios, the reservations
and the government projects, who
can't eat or keep warm properly, are
sick of hearing it too. And you. Pan 1
won't even take time to vote, do
what you can to get people out ol
this social swamp!"

•'Calm down Jim. Seriously now, I
don't follow politics much. I probably
am going to vote this year. Not that
I think it's going to make any big dif
ference. but it sure ain't goin' to
hurt a thing. Nosiree. But do you
know what I think will get people like
us out of this mess?"'
-What?"
"Well I was reading about how
movie agents and sports agents get
rich just by managing and represent
ing these superstars."
•So?"
"So. that's what we should do! We
don't need a voice like Johnny
Mathis. or the speed ot Hershy
Walker. We won't need to tee oil
like Amie Palmer, or act like Sidnev
Portier. All we need to do is know
how to get a fair price for our clients
and bargain like the devil.
"I know you're not serious. You
just dream and
"Yeah. I'm dreamin". But fortunes
start with a dream. Maaan. it we
could get somebody like. sav . . .
Richard Nixon to sign with us. we'd
he set. Can you see it?"
"Not yet.
"Man we'll roll with Tricky Dick.
We'd st;-rt him oft in radio. His own
show. 'Midnight Theater' — 'who
knows what evil lurks within the
hearts ol men the Nix knows.'

Then we'd move him to the big
screen. He'd be a star even more fa
mous than infamous, with our help.
We'd be set man. stone set! Big
Oscar-winning movies: Dickie's
Choice — to erase, or not to erase.
That is the question! An American
I'resident In Hot Water, the story of
how one president changes faces
whenever the congressional lights
beam brightly, and On The Watergate,
a tale of the life and substandard
moral conditions on the D.C. strip
Pennsylvania Avenue. Then we'd
start a serial. Tricky Dick does To
China, tricky Dick Meets Bon:o. . . .
"Paul. Paul — please man. You
know \ou"re just talking."
"Yes. I know it. I'm just having mv
fun. Ain't no ex-president gonna sign
with me to be a movie star.
"But it is pretty amusing, though.
Ridiculous man. the ex-president
turns King ol Hollywood — a movie
star."
"Ain't it. though. Yep, it's almost
as ridiculous as an ex-movie star
turning president."
"You said it man: vou said it."
