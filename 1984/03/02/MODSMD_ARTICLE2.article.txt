# Hoover committee backed
## Kennedy foresees step-by-step action 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday he expects the
Board of Trustees" reassessment of
the relationship between the Univer
sity and the Hoover Institution to
result in a series of small changes
made one at a time rather than "an
ensemble of actions" taken all at
once.
Kennedy said the Committee on
the Hoover Institution, which has
been conducting the inquiry, will not
make a single final report, but in
stead will continue to report back to
the full Board and may recommend
step-by-step actions as it finds them
necessary.
Speaking at a noontime news con
ference in The Daily offices. Ken
nedy also reiterated his belief that
the trustee committee is the most
logical body to conduct the investi
gation because what is being ex
amined is past and present trustee
business.
But, he said, advisory panels ap
pointed to assist the trustee com
mittee may bring faculty and
students into the process. The first
such panel — a committee that will
look into the appointments process
in the University and at Hoover —
will be appointed next week, lie said.
Kennedy also told reporters that
he is search ng for a way to allow
ROTC progi ims to exist on campus
under existing University guidelines,
saying it is "unreasonable in this day
and age" for the University to keep
students from receiving any form of
financial aid.
The guidelines, adopted in 1970 by
the Faculty Senate, prohibit academ
ic credit from being granted for
ROTC classes. The University has in
the past offered to allow ROTC

classes to he held on campus for no
credit, hut the uniformed services
have refused, saying that some offi
cial record must he kept of the
cadets' participation and perfor
mance.
In answer to a reporter's question,
Kennedy defended his choice of
former Stanford President Richard
I.yman as this June's Commencement
speaker, saying, "I will tell you that

he will give a superb talk - that's the
main reason we chose him."
It was well known that writer
Robert Penn Warren, the first choice
of an advisory committee, was
"antipathetic to traveling," Ken
nedy said, and would not agree to
participate.
In choosing between Lyman,
former Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara and United Auto
Workers President Donald Fraser,
Kennedy said he checked into their
availability and thought about "the
appropriateness of what each had to


Donald Kennedy
say to Stanford students."
He said he decided I y man would be
particularly appropriate not only for
the potential quality of his speech
but also because Lyman was well
thought of by students throughout
his 10-year presidency and "this class
of seniors will be the first class of
seniors (since 1969) that never knew
him as president."
Responding to wide-ranging ques
tions at the news conference, one of
several he attends each year at The
Daily. Kennedy also:

• Reiterated that the University is
working as hard as it can to ensure
that Theodore Streleski. the man
who murdered a Stanford mathema
tics professor with a hammer in 197 N.
is paroled somewhere awav from
Stanford. "I think a lot of people (at
Stanford) are worried, and I think
they have a reason to be." he said.
• Said the committee searching for a
replacement for Provost Albert Has
torf. who will leave office at the end
of this year, is meeting every week
and is still considering candidates
from both inside and outside the
University. Asked how many are un
der consideration. Kennedy said only.
"Dozens — but decreasing."
• Reported that no committee has

yet been appointed to search tor
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon s
successor, saying that a panel cur
rently looking into the organization
and administration of the admissions
office will first have to complete its
work.
• Expressed surprise with Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart's victory in the New
Hampshire primary, but played down
the significance of that election and
said he still expects former Vice Pres
ident Walter Mondale to win the
Democratic nomination. Asked whe
ther he would leave the University it
offered a Cabinet position in a new
administration. Kennedy said. "To
even answer that would be to dignify
it as a possibility . . . the answer is
no.' "
