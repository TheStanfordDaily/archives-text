# Bicycling to recreation areas around Woodside
## 
### CATHY JANUS 
Spring, with a few intermit
tent rain showers, seems here
to slay and whether you want
to bicycle, go on a picnic or find
a spot in the sun to sit and
study or simply relax, Woodside
is only minutes away.
Though Woodside Village is
easy to bypass . . . don't.
Besides the town itself, you
can visit the Filoli mansion.
Pulgas Temple, and Huddart
Park.
The Filoli mansion, open to
tourists, was used by the pro
ducers of "Dynasty" for its
opening scenes. For informa
tion on tours and prices call
366-4640.
Bicycling from Stanford to
Woodside is accomplished in no
time. I recommend riding a 10-
speed bicycle because there are
two rather steep hills, though
you don't climb for long. You
might also want to bring some
thing to drink.
To get to Woodside Village,
turn right onto Alpine Road
and then left on Sand Hill.
Then make a right on Whiskey
I lii! Road; a sign indicates that

you are at the turn-off for
Woodside. There is one more
small incline before you turn
left at Woodside Road. Voila.
Craft stores, delis and a bakery
painted a sunshine-yellow greet
you at the beginning of the vil
lage. Once you enter the
"heart" of town, wood-frame
buildings and towering trees
transport you back in time to
the days of the frontier.
Once you've explored the
town and are ready to continue
cycling, Huddart Park is 2.5
miles outside of town and
Pulgas Temple, where Crystal
Springs Reservoir terminates
at the Hetchy Tetch aqueduct,
is five miles from Woodside on
Canada Road. Don't let the
distances deceive you, though.
If you are bicycling, the trek to
Pulgas Temple will prove less
tiring.
The ride to Huddart Park re
quires perseverance. The trail is
so steep that I had to give up
and walk my bike at times.
Reaching the top, you are
rewarded with a sweeping view
of the Bay Area, including

Stanford which is discernible
from among the other groups
of buildings because of Hoover
Tower. The ride to the park,
though admittedly difficult if
you don't often bicycle, is
beautiful. You pass through a
sparsely populated residential
area before entering the forest
where you'll bicycle next to a
stream with the trees provid
ing shade. Entrance to the park
is free for cyclists and $2 per
vehicle. There are hiking trails,
restroom facilities, picnic
tables, a playground and water
fountains.
Famished from my exertion.
1 was ready to enjoy a picnic
lunch once 1 found a nice quiet
place to rest. 1 had decided to
order my lunch from Le
Frommage. Located in the
Stanford Shopping Center, you
can call in your order and they
will deliver it to you. 1 had a
ham and avocado sandwich on
wheat bread ($2.55). The ham
was piled on thick and was nice
and moist, especially with the
avocado and crisp lettuce.
Besides selling hot and cold

sandwiches. Le Frommage ot
ters cole skiu. pasta, macaroni
or potato salads (60 to SO
cents), fruit, chips, cold drinks,
a variety ot imported cheeses
and pate, muffins and desserts.
I sampled the apple raisin bran
muffin. It was very light and
the apple and raisin gave it a
sweet taste, more like a piece
of cake than a bran muffin,
which I usually find dry and
slightly tasteless. Just Desserts
ot San Francisco supplies l.e
Frommage with a selection til
baked goods including carrot
cake, brownies and black
bottom cupcakes (70 to 90
cents).
The cupcake, a rich devil's
food cake, was topped with a
concoction of white and choco
late icing — a chocolate lover's
dream. If you want to go all
out, Le Frommage also sells
picnic baskets and picnic
cloths.
Reinvigorated, you can relax
as you coast down the hill back
to Woodside. Depending on
the time of day you choose to
explore Woodside, you may
prefer to eat Sunday brunch at
Nina's Cafe on the main street
after bicycling, or stop there
Tuesday through Saturday for

;t refreshing drink, lunch or din
ner.
Sporting ;in outside terrace.
Nina's is ideal in this weather.
Lunches cost aproximately
$4.50 and the menu includes
soup, salads, hum burgers,
quiche, a Inn; and cheese
board or a pate sandwich.
Nina's successful!) combines
simple French elegance with
Woodside's frontier atmo
sphere. The exterior is stained
a rich redwood color: inside
there is a wood-burning
fireplace, an antique wooden
rocking-horse and tablecloth
clad tables. Though it is not
necessary to make reservations
for Sunday brunch or lunch.
Nina's follows the traditional
French style and serves a
leisurely dinner. Consequently,
they recommend you make
reservations if you plan to eat
here on the weekend. If you
bicycle when the evenings are
longer or choose to drive there,
I recommend eating dinner at
Nina's. As is customary in
Europe, the terrace is enclosed
in the evenings and heated. I
ordered a cassis soda, a rare
treat, and the pate au poivre
appetizer. We were also served
warm french bread and butter.

Outside, the tables were all oc
cupied. but my date and I felt
quite secluded at our intimate
table with our candle casting
shadows in our wine glasses.
The pate was delightfully spicy
and whet our appetites.
The menu changes daily and
that evening it featured veal
prepared in two difterent
vvavs. monk lish. red snapper,
sweet-breads, lamb and duck.
Meals, which cost between $1 I
and S 13 include soup and salad
and vegetables. It is very sel
dom that one has the opportu
nity to enjoy French dining on
a student's budget, but at
Nina's it is possible.
When our waitress brought
our soup bowls we were
surprised to find that they
were empty. She next returned
with a soup tureen and ladled
the broccoli soup into our
bowls. This unique serv ice was a
nice touch: it was more per
sonal. as if the soup had been
made especially for us. Our
salads, a simple fare of greens,
sunflower seeds and an Italian
dressing followed shortly
thereafter. As we were later
told, the portions are designed
so you won't become too full
to en joy the main course.
I had ordered the red snapper

in hurrhlanc sauce (made win,
shallots, cream, butter and
white wine) which was
nished with two delicious
prawns. It was tender and \ cr \
tasty: I was impressed because
it tasted so much better than
the seafood I'd eaten a few
weeks ago on the wharf in San
Francisco. My friend was en
thusiastic about his n ia m
course also, which was the veal
cooked in a tomato sauce
What really amazed us were
the vegetables. The carrots
were cooked to perfection
slight!) crisp and very flavor
ful. My fish was also accompa
nied by a rice pilaf and turnip
puree. Though I am not a tur
nip lover. I found the puree
more than pleasing. Cooked
with nutmeg, it was smooth
and like the carrots, very
flavorful.
Dessert that evening was a
choice of chocolate mousse or
chocolate gateau. They were
both so good that nn friend
and I kept sneaking bites from
each other. The gateau is a
white cake with a raspberry fil
ling and a thick chocolate icini».
You'll have to go to Nina's
yourself to experience their
chocolate mousse!

The lawns at Pulgas Temple are ideal for picnicking and playing frisbee.


Woodside Village is a relatively easy six-mile bicycle ride

The lawns at Pulgas Temple are ideal for picnicking and playing frisbee.


Woodside Village is a relatively easy six-mile bicycle ride
from Stanford. It is likely that you will see more bicyclists,

Cdthy JcjnU^YtevVf
joggers and people horseback riding than cars on the streets.
In the vicinity are a number of shops, cafes and parks.
Spring, with a few intermit
tent rain showers, seems here
to slay and whether you want
to bicycle, go on a picnic or find
a spot in the sun to sit and
study or simply relax, Woodside
is only minutes away.
Though Woodside Village is
easy to bypass . . . don't.
Besides the town itself, you
can visit the Filoli mansion.
Pulgas Temple, and Huddart
Park.
The Filoli mansion, open to
tourists, was used by the pro
ducers of "Dynasty" for its
opening scenes. For informa
tion on tours and prices call
366-4640.
Bicycling from Stanford to
Woodside is accomplished in no
time. I recommend riding a 10-
speed bicycle because there are
two rather steep hills, though
you don't climb for long. You
might also want to bring some
thing to drink.
To get to Woodside Village,
turn right onto Alpine Road
and then left on Sand Hill.
Then make a right on Whiskey
I lii! Road; a sign indicates that

you are at the turn-off for
Woodside. There is one more
small incline before you turn
left at Woodside Road. Voila.
Craft stores, delis and a bakery
painted a sunshine-yellow greet
you at the beginning of the vil
lage. Once you enter the
"heart" of town, wood-frame
buildings and towering trees
transport you back in time to
the days of the frontier.
Once you've explored the
town and are ready to continue
cycling, Huddart Park is 2.5
miles outside of town and
Pulgas Temple, where Crystal
Springs Reservoir terminates
at the Hetchy Tetch aqueduct,
is five miles from Woodside on
Canada Road. Don't let the
distances deceive you, though.
If you are bicycling, the trek to
Pulgas Temple will prove less
tiring.
The ride to Huddart Park re
quires perseverance. The trail is
so steep that I had to give up
and walk my bike at times.
Reaching the top, you are
rewarded with a sweeping view
of the Bay Area, including

Stanford which is discernible
from among the other groups
of buildings because of Hoover
Tower. The ride to the park,
though admittedly difficult if
you don't often bicycle, is
beautiful. You pass through a
sparsely populated residential
area before entering the forest
where you'll bicycle next to a
stream with the trees provid
ing shade. Entrance to the park
is free for cyclists and $2 per
vehicle. There are hiking trails,
restroom facilities, picnic
tables, a playground and water
fountains.
Famished from my exertion.
1 was ready to enjoy a picnic
lunch once 1 found a nice quiet
place to rest. 1 had decided to
order my lunch from Le
Frommage. Located in the
Stanford Shopping Center, you
can call in your order and they
will deliver it to you. 1 had a
ham and avocado sandwich on
wheat bread ($2.55). The ham
was piled on thick and was nice
and moist, especially with the
avocado and crisp lettuce.
Besides selling hot and cold

sandwiches. Le Frommage ot
ters cole skiu. pasta, macaroni
or potato salads (60 to SO
cents), fruit, chips, cold drinks,
a variety ot imported cheeses
and pate, muffins and desserts.
I sampled the apple raisin bran
muffin. It was very light and
the apple and raisin gave it a
sweet taste, more like a piece
of cake than a bran muffin,
which I usually find dry and
slightly tasteless. Just Desserts
ot San Francisco supplies l.e
Frommage with a selection til
baked goods including carrot
cake, brownies and black
bottom cupcakes (70 to 90
cents).
The cupcake, a rich devil's
food cake, was topped with a
concoction of white and choco
late icing — a chocolate lover's
dream. If you want to go all
out, Le Frommage also sells
picnic baskets and picnic
cloths.
Reinvigorated, you can relax
as you coast down the hill back
to Woodside. Depending on
the time of day you choose to
explore Woodside, you may
prefer to eat Sunday brunch at
Nina's Cafe on the main street
after bicycling, or stop there
Tuesday through Saturday for

;t refreshing drink, lunch or din
ner.
Sporting ;in outside terrace.
Nina's is ideal in this weather.
Lunches cost aproximately
$4.50 and the menu includes
soup, salads, hum burgers,
quiche, a Inn; and cheese
board or a pate sandwich.
Nina's successful!) combines
simple French elegance with
Woodside's frontier atmo
sphere. The exterior is stained
a rich redwood color: inside
there is a wood-burning
fireplace, an antique wooden
rocking-horse and tablecloth
clad tables. Though it is not
necessary to make reservations
for Sunday brunch or lunch.
Nina's follows the traditional
French style and serves a
leisurely dinner. Consequently,
they recommend you make
reservations if you plan to eat
here on the weekend. If you
bicycle when the evenings are
longer or choose to drive there,
I recommend eating dinner at
Nina's. As is customary in
Europe, the terrace is enclosed
in the evenings and heated. I
ordered a cassis soda, a rare
treat, and the pate au poivre
appetizer. We were also served
warm french bread and butter.

Outside, the tables were all oc
cupied. but my date and I felt
quite secluded at our intimate
table with our candle casting
shadows in our wine glasses.
The pate was delightfully spicy
and whet our appetites.
The menu changes daily and
that evening it featured veal
prepared in two difterent
vvavs. monk lish. red snapper,
sweet-breads, lamb and duck.
Meals, which cost between $1 I
and S 13 include soup and salad
and vegetables. It is very sel
dom that one has the opportu
nity to enjoy French dining on
a student's budget, but at
Nina's it is possible.
When our waitress brought
our soup bowls we were
surprised to find that they
were empty. She next returned
with a soup tureen and ladled
the broccoli soup into our
bowls. This unique serv ice was a
nice touch: it was more per
sonal. as if the soup had been
made especially for us. Our
salads, a simple fare of greens,
sunflower seeds and an Italian
dressing followed shortly
thereafter. As we were later
told, the portions are designed
so you won't become too full
to en joy the main course.
I had ordered the red snapper

in hurrhlanc sauce (made win,
shallots, cream, butter and
white wine) which was
nished with two delicious
prawns. It was tender and \ cr \
tasty: I was impressed because
it tasted so much better than
the seafood I'd eaten a few
