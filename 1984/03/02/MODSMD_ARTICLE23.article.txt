## Cats go Wild from the line to beat the Cardinal at home 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
After a sleepwalking per
formance in the first half,
the Stanford basketball
team lost to Arizona 87-76
last night.
Although the Cardinal fi
nally woke up in the final
minutes of the game to
close within three points,
the Wildcats held on,
making clutch free throws
to post the victory.
"I thought the team
should be commended for
the strong performance
they put up after the hole
we got ourselves buried in,"
Stanford Coach Tom Davis
said about his squad after
the game. "We have to
come out and play the
entire game. There are no
teams in this league where
we can come out and play
anything but our best ef
fort."
The loss dropped Stan

ford to 18-11 overall. 7-9 in
the Pacific-10 Conference
while Arizona improved to
10-15, 7-S in the confer
ence. Last night's game also
put a damper on the Car
dinal's National Invitational
Tournament (NIT) chances.
Davis still feels that
Stanford has a lot to offer
and is still in the running for
a hid. "We know last year
teams went with IS (wins),"
Davis said. "I'm certainly
not going to write this team
off."
Ni l' fever started to blow
in a new direction, however,
as Arizona Coach Lute Ol
son started talking about
the Wildcat's post-season
tournament chances follow
ing their victory. "If we win
three more I don't see that
anyone couldn't take a hard
look at us," Olson said.
"We'd be S-l in the league
the second time around and
I think it would be a great

Cinderella StPIV."
The ' ist tni'c these two
teams played in Arizona,
Stanford von 74-66 but
Davis said that this time his
team w.ts not as hungry for
a victory.
"Down <r. Tucson, we
hadn t started winning
yet," Davis explained.
"When yo'.t i>et IS wins you
aren't as hungry. They
(Arizona) are on a role and
they came out aggressively.
"I think it's a mental
thing. Before the pre-game
meal we put on the poorest
free-throw exhibition we
had all season. 1 think you
start to believe that you are
really good and forget all
the hard work that got you
there. Sometimes the only
cure is to suffer with the
disease."
For Stanford, last night's
game became the fairy tale
that wasn't, as Stanford
came back fron: a 12-point

deficit (69-57) with just
over three minutes left to
close to within three points
in the final minute-and-a
half.
The Cardinal reeled off
eight straight points,
closing the gap to 69-65, as
guard Keith Jones scoring
the first four, two on an IN
foot jumper followed by a
lay-in after a steal.
Stanford was forced to
continually foul the
Wildcats, however, in the
closing minutes and Arizona
increased its lead to six (77-
7|) with :39 left in the
game as the Wildcats con
verted on four straight 1-
on-1 opportunities.
With :34 left, Keith
Ramee hit a 12-footer in
the middle and converted
his free-throw attempt fol
lowing a foul by guard Brock
Brunkhorst, closing the
Wildcat lead to 77-74, but
that was as close as the Car
dinal would get as Arizona
converted on five more 1-
on-1 opportunities, not mis
sing a single shot at the line
in the closing half minute of
play.
For the game, Arizona
converted 35-of-41 free
throws, 28-of-31 in the
second half. The Wildcats
also shot .634 from the
field. On the other hand,
Stanford went to the line
just 20 times, converting on
14. The Cardinal shot .534
from the field.
The Wildcats took it to
the Cardinal early in the
came, exposing the Stan
ford zone with their outside
shooting â€” particularly
that of Arizona guard Steve
Kerr who was 6-for-N from
the field, with 16 points on
the evening. Kerr had 10 of
his points in the first half
during a crucial stretch and
seemingly couldn't miss
from the leftside corner,
hitting 5-of-6 first-half
shots.
"Steve Kerr is a very good
shooter if we can get him
the ball with a little room."
Olson said. "The guys are
aware that right now he's on
a run (6-for-8 from the
field and 14 points against
USC last week) and they
know where he is at all times

night's contest. His team wore black bands on its uniforms in memory of his father
Malcolm Kerr, the recently slain president of the American University in Beirut.
when he's on the floor. He has
the green light to shoot it
whenever he feels that he's
open."
Stanford had turnover prob
lems early in the game, and the
temporary loss of Jones hurt
the Cardinal. Jones sustained a
sprained ankle, but he returned
to the lineup several minutes
later.
Arizona ran up its biggesl
lead of the evening with 1:31
left in the first half (37-21)
but Stanford came back with a
furious last-minute spurt to
cut the lead to nine, 39-30.
Jones finally came alive in
the second half scoring 24 of
his 31 points to lead all scorers.
It was Jones' third best career
performance, his best being a
36-point effort against
Arizona last year. Revelli had
15 points for Stanford before
fouling out with 1:57 left.
Arizona center Pete Wil
liams led all Wildcat scorer
with 20 points but more impor
tantly had 14 rebounds as

Arizona dominated the boards
with 29 rebounds compared to
just 2 1 for Stanford.
Card notes
Jones set a new single-season
Stanford scoring record last
night. Coming into the game
one point short of the record
553. Jones shattered the mark
he set last season with a 31-
point performance.
