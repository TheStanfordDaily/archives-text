# Hoop crew sets out to burn the Sun Devils
## 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford men's basket
hall team will get its second
dose of Arizona fever tomor
row as the Cardinal hosts
Arizona State, a team that has
done some scorching of its own
lately.
The Sun Devils rolled past
UCLA, 76-67, last week and
defeated UC- Berkeley last
night, 59-54, giving them an
11-14 overall record, 7-9 in the
Pacific-10 Conference.
Like Arizona, ASU is a
strong rebounding team.
"ASU is in a lot of ways like
Arizona," Stanford guard
Keith Jones said. "Both of
these teams rebound well. The
key will be how we are able to
rebound against them."
The Sun Devils are led by
senior guard Chris Beasley who
is averaging 17.9 points a game.
Beasley is a streak shooter and
lately he has been hot.
But the hottest Sun Devil

may be freshman forward
Steve Beck. Beck scored 25
points against Cal last night,
his career high. Beck, v\ho
stands only 6-foot-3 for a for
ward. will probably be matched
up with Stanford's small for
ward Steve Brown.
Besides Beck. ASU will start
Jim Deines (6-9) at the other
forward spot, while 6-10 junior
Phil McKinney will start at
center.
The last time the two teams
played (Feb. 4 in Tucson),
Stanford won the contest 74-
66 but was in trouble through
out most of the game and had
to come back and win it late in
the second half.
But Stanford's late come
back last month was when
every game still meant some
thing. With last night's loss to
the (University of Arizona, the
final chapter of the 1984
season has almost been writ
ten.
The Cardinal has now lost its

last three games in the Pac-10,
putting its record at 7-9 in the
conference. 18-11 overall.
Those three losses have nearly
squelched the Card's once
promising National Invitation
al Tournament (NIT) bid
hopes.
Thus, with lost hope of an
NIT bid goes the importance of
this game. If the Cardinal had
won last night's game, tomor
row's game against the Sun
Devil's would have been lor an
all-important 20th victory.
Now. in order to get to the
20-win mark, the Cardinal
must not onlv beat a tough and
hungry ASU team! Hut m'list
also look ahead to the un
enviable task of beating the
University of Oregon in
Eugene.
More important than the
20-win mark is the fact that
the Cardinal must simply get
back on the winning track, per
iod. If it doesn't do it tomor
row. at least there's next year.

Seniors Keith Jones and John Revelli will face the Maples backboards for the last time in to
morrow's game against the University of Arizona. But the two seniors will be going out in
style. Jones has broken his own record to set a new single-season scoring record, and Revelli
is second on the all-time Stanford scoring list with 1567 career points.
