Austrian President Rudolf
Kirchschlaeger will visit the Univer
sity tomorrow morning as part of his
eurrent state visit to the United
States.
Accompanied by Foreign Affairs
Minister Erwin Lane and Science and
Research Minister Heinz Fischer,
among others, he will be welcomed at
9 a.m. by University President
Donald Kennedy, and then attend a
brief program in the Field Room of
Green Library on the close ties be
tween Stanford and Austria.
Stanford established a study cen
ter in Austria in 1965 and received an
endowed visiting professorship in
Austrian studies as a gift of the
Austrian government and people in
honor of the American bicentennial
in 1976.
Following Kennedy's brief recep
tion, the Austrian delegation is
scheduled to be welcomed at Green
by David Weber, director of Univer
sity libraries. University libraries
have one of the largest collections ol
Austrian materials in the United
States.
Peter Frank. German language
curator for University libraries, will
demonstrate the process of accessing
these materials by computer, a new
phenomenon made available to major
research libraries across the country
by the Stanford-based Research Li
brary Information Network.
Kirchschlaeger was elected to the
essentially non-political office ot
president of Austria in 1974. after a
distinguished career in law and
politics, according to Emeritus Poli
tical Science Prof. Kurt Steiner. He
served as a district attorney and
judge and then earned a reputation
as an excellent diplomat, largely
owing to his tenure as ambassador to
Czechoslovakia during the dilticult
years of 1967 to 1970. In 1970 he
became foreign minister.
Kirchschlaeger is unusual in
Austrian politics in that he is an in
dependent, a candidate - but not a
member of the Socialist party and
also a practicing Catholic. Steiner
said this background makes the presi
dent ideal to represent Austria.
After serving his first six-year
term, the popular president easily
won re-election in 19K0.
Kirchschlaeger is scheduled to
arrive in San Francisco this atter
noon. He was honored by President
Reagan at a White House dinner this
week and also stopped in New ork
and Chicago.
