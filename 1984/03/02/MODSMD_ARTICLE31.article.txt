# Sluggers begin Pac-10 play
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
The start ol the Pacific-10
season may he the best thing
to happen for the Stanford
baseball team this year.
The Cardinal (l I -10-1) will
begin the defense of its Pac-l()
championship today when it
jaces Arizona in a three-game
Series at Tucson. Today's game
is at 2 p.m.. and games will be
held Saturday and Sunday at l
p.m.
Stanford has been inconsis
tent in its nonconference
games, and the Cardinal will
lace a Wildcat team that has
suffered many of the same
problems. Stanford hopes to
rebound from a preseason per
formance that has not lived up
to many expectations.
Arizona (M-1 3) has lost six
straight games and eight of its
last nine. Stanford, which won
the NCAA Western Regional
playoffs and was fifth in the
College World Series last year,
lias won but three of its last
eight games in addition to a

13-13 tie against Ifawaii.
One source close to the
Wildcats summed up Arizona's
situation: "The way things
have gone, it something can go
wrong it will."
The Wildcats lost a three
game series to second-ranked
Oklahoma State last weekend,
and Arizona had good opportu
nities to win two of the games
but poor reliel pitching and
spotty defense cost Coach
Jerry Kimball's team.
The Wildcats have commit
ted more than 30 errors this
season. nearly half by
shortstop Matt Mac Arthur,
who is compensating for his
suspect defense with a .358
batting average. On the
mound. h-6 lefthander Joe
Magrane is the only Arizona
pitcher with a winning record
(4-1).
Magrane threw a no-hitter
against Cal-State Fullerton,
the only team to face both
Stanford and Arizona. Stan
ford. which has a better win

ning percentage on the road
than at home, lost two ol
three to Fullerton in early
February, while the Wildcats
won two of three.
1 hough Magrane has been
the only consistent pitcher,
the Wildcat hitters have had
few problems. Arizona scored
27 runs in one game and the
Wildcats have scored over 10
runs six times. First baseman
designated hitter Dave Cooper
leads the Wildcats with a .367
batting average and 16 RBIs.
Stanford, meanwhile, has
struggled at the plate. Coach
Mark Marquess said earlier this
season that he was relying on
Rick l.undblade for power hit
ting. and recently l.undblade
has responded. He has lilted his
average to .307 after a slow
start and leads the Cardinal in
runs batted in. Sophomore Ken
Green is hitting .370 while
vying for the starting position
at third base, and Darryl Step
liens seems to have recovered

from the knee injury which
forced him to miss last season.
Pete Stanicek and Greg l.oren
/etti also have been hitting
well lately.
John Radtke continues to
pitch well tor Marquess.
Radtke. a senior, has a 4-0
record and two complete games
to go along with a glittering
1.93 earned run average. All
Pae-10 reliever Jeff Ballard is
leading the team in strikeouts
and saves.
The Cardinal will face stiff
competition to retain its Pac
-10 title. USC and Arizona
State, the latter ranked first
in the country, are preseason
favorites, and one Arizona
Republic sportswriter
predicted Arizona State would
finish 25-5 in the Pac-lO's six
team southern division. The
Six-Pac includes both Arizona
schools, USC, UCLA. Cal and
Stanford, which was 20-10 en
route to its 1953 champion
ship.
