Sophomore center Sarah
Evans may not have heen at her
most eloquent following the
Stanford women's basketball
team's 60-57 victory over
Arizona, but she pretty much
summed up the feeling of the
whole team, saying "All I know
is that it feels great to win!"
It certainly did. as the cagers
captured their first WCAA
triumph in 12 outings. Part of
the exhilaration came,
however, in the way the team
did it.
The Cardinal led for most of
the contest, opening the mar
gin to as much as 13 points en
route to a 29-22 halftime lead.
In the second half, though, the
Card came out flat, enabling
the Wildcats to close the gap
to 31-28 three minutes into
the half. The Card opened it
back to JO, but Arizona kept
coming and took the lead when
freshman forward Yolanda
Turner hit a pair of foul shots
to make it 51-50 with 3:49
left.
Arizona had it*; largest lead
of the night at 53-50 with 2:55
remaining, but the Cardinal,
unlike it has on other occasions
this year, refused to be
counted out.
After both teams exchanged
baskets. Evans hit a bucket
with 43 seconds left to give
Stanford a 56-55 lead, and the
Card never looked back. Junior
forward Mary Bradach hit both
ends of a one-and-one with 25
seconds left, and senior guard
Lee Ann Margerum sealed the
verdict b\ doing the same with
nine seconds to go.
Bradach noted the differ

ence between this contest and
the others thai the Cardinal
had failed to win. "We got it
all together at the end," she
said. "The difference is when
we were down by three at the
end, we didn't 'all apart. We
played tough defense and
worked it in on offense and we
hit cur free throws at the
end."
The clutch foul shooting was
evident ;s Si:into r d made 13
of 14 tries in the second half, a
93 percent rÂ«.te, and hit 88 per
cent on the 'Tame.
Stanford ' 'tad Coach Dotty
McCrea had >a d before the
game that lor t; ie cagers to
win, three player would have to
reach double figures and one
more would have to be close.
The Card did that one better.
There were four players with
10 points or more and a fifth
with seven.
Leading the way was Evans.
The 6-foot-2 sophomore from
Rio Grande, Ohio, finished
with 16 points and 1 1
rebounds. Sophomore guard
Virginia Sourlis followed with
13 points and seven assists, and
Bradach and Margerum each
had 10, with Bradach adding
eight rebounds and six assists.
Freshman forward Kim Mercer
had seven points on the night.
Stanford Assistant Coach
Mike Kehoe noted, "We did a

great job on the boards." The
Cardinal out-rebounded
Arizona, 36-26. on the night,
and allowed the Wildcats only
four offensive rebounds the
entire game.
As a team, Stanford shot
poorly on the night, hitting
only 39 percent of its shots
from the field, but the Car
dinal's rebounding edge gave it
13 more shots than Arizona,
which shot 50 percent.
McCrea was smiling after
the game. It has been a long
season for the Card, with a 5-
21 overall record and a 1-11
conference mark to show for
it, but the cagers earned this
one. McCrea said, "Even when
they got down, they decided
that it wasn't out of hand,
they knew that they could
win."
The confidence was begin
ning to show. Freshman guard
Sue Sebolt remarked afterward
"We're on a roll." Asked when
the next win would be she and
Sourlis replied unhesitatingly,
"Saturday night."
Arizona State rolls into
Maples Pavilion tomorrow at
7:30 p.m.. and the Sun Devils,
an NCAA tournament
qualifier last season, should
pose a much more severe test.
Until then, at least, the Car
dinal can savor this one. As
McCrea said, "They deserved
it."
