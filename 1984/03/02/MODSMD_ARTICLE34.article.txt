# Card to paw it with the Bears
## Netters now undefeated 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
The UC-Berkeley women's
tennis team hasn't beaten
Stanford in I I meetings, but
Cardinal Head Coach Frank
Brennan refuses to use the
term "jinx." "I don't think I'd
call it a jinx," he said. "Every
time we've beaten them, it's
been convincing. After all, nor
mally. the better player will
win."
Brennan gave a knowing
smile as he said this. While Cal.
the No. 10 team in the country
with a 5-2 record, is no push
over, Brennan seemed to
think the No. 1-ranked Car
dinal. 5-0 this year, is going
into today's match with an ad
vantage in personnel.
"C'al's the best team we've
played so far," Brennan did al
low. "We're looking forward to
a good test."
The Card will open with
freshman Patty Fendick at No.
1 singles. Fendick, ranked No.
16 in the pre-season, will go
against Cal sophomore Heath
er Ettus, who is 4-4 this year
and ranked No. 19.
At No. 2, Brennan will go
with junior Linda Gates,
ranked No. 23, who will prob
ably face Linda Oechsle. The
Cal freshman is 10-4 and
ranked No. 25, but has been
sidelined recently and may drop
down to No. 3.

Stanford will go with sopho
more Kate Gompert, ranked
No. 7, at third singles, while
the Bears are expected to
counter with Mary Margaret
Torres. The freshman is 9-8
this year.
At No. 4. Brennan expects
to go with freshman Leigh
Anne Eldredge, ranked No. IS,
who has been experiencing
some stiffness as of late. She
will go against Cal junior Stacy
Savides, who is 10-2 this year.
If Eldredge doesn't play, Stan
ford freshman Stephanie
Savides, Stacy's sister, would
move up from fifth to fourth
to face her sibling. If she stays
at No. 5, she will face junior
Vickie Corrales, 6-6 this year.
The sixth singles match
should pit Stanford senior Mic
helle Weiss against C'al junior
Julie Grummel, 6-6. If
Eldredge sits out, Weiss will
play No. 5 and sophomore
Alyce Werdel would go at No. 6
In the doubles matches it
will be Eldredge and Fendick
against Grummel and Torres at
No. 1, Gompert and Weiss
against Oechsle and Caroline
Yao at No. 2, and Gates and
Stephanie Savides against
Corrales and Stacy Savides at
No. 3.
The match is slated to begin
at 1:30 p.m. at the Varsity
Tennis Courts. It is a res
cheduling of last Friday's
match.
