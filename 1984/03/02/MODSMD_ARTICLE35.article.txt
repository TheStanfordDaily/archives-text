# New baseball commissioner

### 
New York (AP) — Baseball's 15-month
search for a new commissioner apparently will
end tomorrow when Peter Ueberroth, head
of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Com
mittee, will be named to succeed Bowie
Kuhn.
According to published reports, later con
j firmed by two sources close to baseball,
I Ueberroth was selected by a search commit
tee to replace Kuhn, whose 15-year term
expired today.
1 Another source told The Associated Press
that all 26 club owners have been called
to meet on Saturday in Tampa, Fla.,
at which time the committee, headed by Mil
waukee Brewers owner Hud Selig, will "name
their man."
The New York Times said owners agreed
■ last summer to accept the decision of Selig's
committee, so the election of Ueberroth was
' viewed as a formality. And, the Philadelphia
Inquirer reported that baseball's Executive
| Council approved Ueberroth's selection last
Thursday at a secret meeting in New York.
The naming of Ueberroth will end a politi
cal battle within baseball's ownership that
began at a secret meeting in December, 1981
in Florida, where nine owners signed a letter
urging Kuhn to resign.
Kuhn's ouster was accomplished on Nov. 1.
1982 in Chicago when, opposed by five Na

tional League owners, the commissioner
failed to gain re-election to a third seven
year term. The five NL dissenters were New
York, Houston, St. Louis, Atlanta and Cin
cinnati.
In December, 19N2, Selig's committee was
empanelled to find a new commissioner, and.
despite continued backing from a solid corps
of supporters. Kuhn withdrew his name from
further consideration last August in Boston.
His term, which originally expired on Aug. 15,
1983, was subsequently extended twice, the
final time to March 1.
Selig could not be reached for comment
and did not return telephone calls Thursday
But a'source close to the hunt said
the tide apparently turned in Ueberroth's fa
vor when he received the backing of Kuhn
supporter Peter O'Malley, owner of the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
Reached aboard the Queen Mary at Long
Beach. Calif., Ueberroth would neither con
firm nor deny his imminent election. Ueber
roth was there to address The Associated
Press Executive Council on the Summer
Olympics.
"There have been conversations," he said.
"But nothing has been decided. That's it. I'm
not being cute. That's where it stands."
Ueberroth probably would take over on
Sept. 1.
