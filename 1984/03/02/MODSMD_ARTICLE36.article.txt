Kicking off
The Cardinal men swimmers leave their starting blocks to travel to East Los Angeles to
compete in the Pac-10 Championships this weekend. The men are undefeated this
season, as are the Card aqua-women. The Stanford women's team hopes to splash
Santa Clara and San Jose Aquatics tomorrow at DeGuerre Pool.
