## How do the latest restaurants on the block rate? Avanti Pasta good, but... needs a polishing touch CAFE AVANTI PASTA BAR

\\anti Pasta Cafe & Bar
397 State Street
Los Altos
941-4256
Conveniently located in
downtown Los Altos, the
\vanti Pasta Cafe & liar ot
ters a line, reasonably priced
Italian dining experience
worthy of the 15-minute drive
.Irom campus.
But do not expect a perfect

tiny pink irises.
One discerns immediately
that Avanti is devoid of bus
boys. but with so few custom
ers. the waitresses have plenty
lit time to fill and refill water
glasses and to clear empty
plates. But even so, the
waitresses falter on occasion,
as we noticed when owner Don
had to remove an empty soup
dish.
A lone window in the far cor

evening there, for owner Don
Odiorne is still smoothing out
many problems common to new
restaurants (Avanti opened
Dec. 20).
After arriving, we spent five
minutes waiting for the
maitre'd to seat us. though the
restaurant was nearly empty.
The lack of a large crowd was
understandable since it was a
Wednesday night.
The front dining room is
attractive. Decorating the
walls are colorful paintings for
sale, blatantly labeled "Ingrid's
gallery." The atmosphere,
though not intimate, is pleas
ant. Two chandeliers bearing
whirling fans swing precariously
overhead. A plethora of lights
highlight the predominately
pink appearance of the front
dining room. Each table is
adorned with bright pink
tablecloths and each has its
own tinv pink vase filled with

ner of the room provides a per
fect view of a Chevron gas
station, clear enough to pick
out the prices of super
unleaded gas ($1.39.9 per gal
lon. in case you were curious).
Immediately after being
seated, fresh-baked bread — a
half-wheat-half-white blend in
which Avanti takes much pride
— is presented. Why the
owners prize this flavorless rec
ipe remains a mystery to us.
We ordered drinks: a virgin
strawberry dacquiri (won't he a
virgin next time we go out) and
a glass of the house chablis.
Both drinks were excellent and
Colombard white wine ($1.75
per glass. $6 for a carafe) was
particularly good.
Avanti serves no appetizers,
though all entrees include
either soup or salad, and more
bread if customers really want

The approximate!) 20 dinner
entrees include pastas, pizzas,
and speciality veal and chicken
dishes, prices ranging from
$5.95 to $11.95. Lunch offers
smaller portions of similar
entrees at lower prices.
We found the veal seallopini
(SI 1.95) tast\ and tender, pre
sented attractively with a side
of noodles and cauliflower
swimming in cheese sauce.
The mouth-watering let-

tuccine alfredo ($7.95) also
proved delicious.
But entree portions are in
sufficient for the cost and.
frankly, just not enough sub
stance for hungry, young col
lege students.
Four entrees under the
category of pasta salads appear
quite appealing. The tonno dish
($6.45) consists of spirals of
pasta, Albacore tuna, celery
and tomato in a \inaigrette,
garlic and bread crumb dressing.
Gamberetto ($6.95) offers
seashell pasta, bay shrimp,
water chestnuts and dill in a
delicate Louis sauce.
Service at the two-month
old restaurant is far from
polished. The waitress
delivered the fettuccine to an
empty seat (the female half of
our party was investigating the
ladies' lounge — in dire need of
refurbishing, in case you were

curious), and remarked, "When
she comes back, let me know if
she wants some Parmesan."
The request conjured up images
of hunting down the waitress
to obtain the finely grated
cheese.
We sampled two of the
three desserts and found them
both superb.
The chocolate amaretto cake
($2) was a rich delicacy and the
spumoni ($1.50) a refreshing
palate-clearing finale.
Also offered are cappuccino
and espresso, additional nice

finishing touches.
Avanti offers an attractive
array of entrees at reasonable
prices and has a pleasant
enough atmosphere to merit a
positive recommendation.

a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and dinner
from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m.
Reservations are suggevtwl.
