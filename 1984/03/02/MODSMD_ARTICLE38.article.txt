# Remember great seafood?

The Old Clamhouse
355 State Street
Los Altos
941-8199
Whether your seafood
palate is looking for a change
of pace from Palo Alto's
meager offerings, or Food Ser
vice's stuffed flounder has
made you forget what real
seafood tastes like. The Old
Clamhouse is a great choice to
satisfy your salt-water cravings
or refresh your memory.
Located in Los Altos on
State St. (just off of Main St.
off San Antonio), it's not too
far off the beaten track and is
easy to spot with its yacht club
royal blue awning.
The atmosphere is casual and
friendly and the two small
dining areas provide a com
fortable setting for lunch or
dinner dining. The decor is
nothing special, and as the res
taurant has only been open for
roughly a month everything
still feels a bit "new," lacking a
certain amount of lived-in
charm and warmth.
However, any small lack in
decor is quickly made up for by
the friendly and very attentive
service. No sooner had we been
seated then we received a bas
ket of fresh bread and clam
broth (to dip our bread into),
and were being given a run
down on the chefs specials.
Being comfortably settled
at a quiet window table, we
were ready to contemplate the
large and varied menu which in
cluded everything from sand
wiches, salads, omelettes and
pastas to veal, beef and of
course seafood entrees. Besides
the items on the menu there
are two chalk boards (market
boards really) in each dining
room which list the chefs and
daily specials on one, and fresh

lish of the day choices on the
other.
From the selection of ap
petizers: steamed clams, clam
house linguine, clams half shell,
blue point oysters and crab or
shrimp cocktail, ranging in
prices from $4.25 to $7.25, we
chose to share the steamed
clams ($7.95) which were a
specialty of the house.
While the clammies seemed a
hit slow in making it to our
table, we enjoyed our bread
and broth, and eventually
didn't mind the wait as they
were very good, very hot, very
fresh and very firm upon arri
val. The clams are served with a
delightful garlic vinaigrette
which made them all the more
delicious, and the portion size
was just right for two to share.
Our only complaints thus far
come from Jean-Michel who
would have liked a large spoon
to finish off the clam broth
and a "rince-doigts" or some
thing akin to rinse his fingers!
As entrees we chose a chefs
special, "Chefs Saute"
($11.95) and a fresh fish of the
day, "Petrale Saute"(s9.9s).
All seafood dishes were quite
reasonably priced from $7.95
to $12.95, given the quality,
preparation and generous ser
ving of each.
The "Chefs Saute," which
was listed as "diced snapper,
crab, and shrimp meat saute
with mushrooms and hollan
daise," turned out to be both
very delicious and delightfully
surprising. It was served on a
bed of rice with steamed car
rots and was absolutely delec
table. The surprise came with
our difficulty in detecting any
crab or shrimp meat while en
joying an abundance of
"unlisted" scallops. The snap
per was very fresh and the dish
overall was excellent.

The "Petrale Saute" was
truly exquisite and simply
melted in our mouths. The fish
was very fresh and was
prepared in an uncomplicated
but absolutely mouth-watering
butter and garlic sauce. It too
was served with steamed car
rots which were quite good,
along with a portion of fet
tucine noodles. While both
Jean-Michel and I thought
that rice might have suited the
petrale better than noodles,
the fettucine sufficed nicely.
While there were no desserts
listed. my encourageable
sweet-tooth prompted me to
ask it the menu offered anyth
ing to tempt our palates fur
ther. Sure enough, upon
request, they serve mud pie
direct from Baskin Robbins
down the block. Though nei
ther very original nor very in
teresting, the mud pie was
tasty and definitely sweet.
Our meal was complemented
nicely by a bottle of Monterey
Valley Chardonnay which we
had chosen from the reason
ably priced ($7-$ 11) wine list
consisting of a limited selec
tion of California wines. The
wine was a bit astringent in
Jean-Michel's opinion, but
none the less enjoyable.
All in all the dinner was
lovely, and the seafood receives
our high recommendations.
Our tally came to roughly $45
but two could enjoy a delicious
dinner for closer to $30 and
probably a very good lunch for
under $ 10 per person.
The Old Clamhouse is open
from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on
weekdays and from 4 p.m. to
10 p.m. on Sundays. No
reservations are accepted.

nothing special, and as the res
taurant has only been open for
roughly a month everything
still feels a bit "new," lacking a
certain amount of lived-in
charm and warmth.
However, any small lack in
decor is quickly made up for by
the friendly and very attentive
service. No sooner had we been
seated then we received a bas
ket of fresh bread and clam
broth (to dip our bread into),
and were being given a run
down on the chefs specials.
Being comfortably settled
at a quiet window table, we
were ready to contemplate the
large and varied menu which in
cluded everything from sand
wiches, salads, omelettes and
pastas to veal, beef and of
course seafood entrees. Besides
the items on the menu there
are two chalk boards (market
boards really) in each dining
room which list the chefs and
daily specials on one, and fresh

lish of the day choices on the
other.
From the selection of ap
petizers: steamed clams, clam
house linguine, clams half shell,
blue point oysters and crab or
shrimp cocktail, ranging in
prices from $4.25 to $7.25, we
chose to share the steamed
clams ($7.95) which were a
specialty of the house.
While the clammies seemed a
hit slow in making it to our
table, we enjoyed our bread
and broth, and eventually
didn't mind the wait as they
were very good, very hot, very
fresh and very firm upon arri
val. The clams are served with a
delightful garlic vinaigrette
which made them all the more
delicious, and the portion size
was just right for two to share.
Our only complaints thus far
come from Jean-Michel who
would have liked a large spoon
to finish off the clam broth
and a "rince-doigts" or some
thing akin to rinse his fingers!
As entrees we chose a chefs
special, "Chefs Saute"
($11.95) and a fresh fish of the
day, "Petrale Saute"(s9.9s).
All seafood dishes were quite
reasonably priced from $7.95
to $12.95, given the quality,
preparation and generous ser
ving of each.
The "Chefs Saute," which
was listed as "diced snapper,
crab, and shrimp meat saute
with mushrooms and hollan
daise," turned out to be both
very delicious and delightfully
surprising. It was served on a
bed of rice with steamed car
rots and was absolutely delec
table. The surprise came with
our difficulty in detecting any
crab or shrimp meat while en
joying an abundance of
"unlisted" scallops. The snap
per was very fresh and the dish
overall was excellent.

The "Petrale Saute" was
truly exquisite and simply
melted in our mouths. The fish
was very fresh and was
prepared in an uncomplicated
but absolutely mouth-watering
butter and garlic sauce. It too
was served with steamed car
rots which were quite good,
along with a portion of fet
tucine noodles. While both
Jean-Michel and I thought
that rice might have suited the
petrale better than noodles,
the fettucine sufficed nicely.
While there were no desserts
listed. my encourageable
sweet-tooth prompted me to
ask it the menu offered anyth
ing to tempt our palates fur
ther. Sure enough, upon
request, they serve mud pie
direct from Baskin Robbins
down the block. Though nei
ther very original nor very in
teresting, the mud pie was
tasty and definitely sweet.
Our meal was complemented
nicely by a bottle of Monterey
Valley Chardonnay which we
had chosen from the reason
ably priced ($7-$ 11) wine list
consisting of a limited selec
tion of California wines. The
wine was a bit astringent in
Jean-Michel's opinion, but
none the less enjoyable.
All in all the dinner was
lovely, and the seafood receives
our high recommendations.
Our tally came to roughly $45
but two could enjoy a delicious
dinner for closer to $30 and
probably a very good lunch for
under $ 10 per person.
The Old Clamhouse is open
from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on
