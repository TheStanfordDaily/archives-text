# Magnolia's is better than view

Magnolia's Ciarden
Restaurant

We had been to Ernie's
and A-1 Liquors main
times, hut had not paid
much attention to that
bright orange sign across the
street. Really, just what
kind ot restaurant would be
located in the midst of Taeo
Bell, Autoworks of Palo
Alto and the two closest
bargain liquor stores
around?
A good one.
We were surprised to find
that Magnolia's, which
opened in September and is
owned by the same people
who run Des Alpes on Cali
fornia Avenue, is a fine res
taurant. It offers a pleasant
atmosphere and a wide vari
ety of food.
It was fairly crowded the
Saturday night we visited
Magnolia's. We could have
grabbed a table in the back
room, the one with the
Confederate flag on the
wall, but we opted to hold
out for a table in the front
room. We realized it was
worth the quick wait in the
bar as we enjoyed our win
dow seat with it> view of
Frnitj's and A-1 and of
course those magnolia
planters.

The calamari was fantastic - covered
with garlic and butter, the tasty tidbits
are a must for any squid lover.

For starters we dug into
the muffins served at each
table and then went with
the Ringlets of Calamari
($4.95) and Potato Skins
($3.95). The Calamari was
fantastic — covered with
garlic and butter, the tasty

tidbits are a must for any
squid lover. Even those who
don't usually brave such
seafood should give it a try.
As for the skins, well, the
added bonus ot mushrooms
inside with the more usual
cheese and bacon stuffing
helped out a lot. but the
skins really lacked taste.

Smaller and drier than most
we've had before, we cannot
recommend them.
Though our waitress \v;is
amazed at the amount of
food we were ordering, we
continued. *' \re you sure
you really want all that."
she asked us point-blank,
seemingly surprised that we
could eat appetizers and
entrees. "Wait 'til we order
desert." we both thought.
Anyway, for our entrees
we opted for the Baby Back
Ribs and Magnolia's
Gumbo with Scallops and

Shrimps ($7.75). All entrees
come with a small dinner
salad, fresh vegetable and
rice or potato. The salad is
small. served in a
deceptively large bowl with
a "false bottom." and is
adequate but nothing spe

cial. The veggie selection of
the day vv;is zucchini and the
julienne strips were quite
tastv. We highly recommend
them. The gumbo comes
with rice and the ribs with
trench tries (also in julienne
strips).
The ribs weren't very
spicy at all — unlike the

(with spinach, bacon and
chcddar chccsc — $4.95).
No dinner would he com
plete without dessert, and
we weren't about to let our
stomachs or our waitress ("I
promise I won't tell anyone
it you want dessert.") stop
lis. So we ordered.
Alter we ga/ed at the
dessert tray brought around
to us. we went with the
Hush! Hush! Sweet Char
lotte ($2.50) and Chocolate
Velvet ($2.50). The Char
lotte was three truffles
with a praline filling. Talk
about rich. And not to be
outdone, the Velvet con
sisted of lasers of chocolate
and coffee mousse on a
chocolate bottom. Deli
cious!
Our total bill including a
bottle of Fetzer-Empire
/infadel (SN.SO) came to
about $43. One can get by
much more cheaply though,
depending on appetites and
selection of the wide range
of dishes.
A special bonus on Satur
day nights: Live perfor
mance by Dr. Robert and
Kenny Orcutt. who put on a
show of good, mellow music
to complement a full meal.
There seem to be a fair
number of regulars who
show up about 9:30 to 10
p.m. to listen to the music,
but not surprisingly most
are a bit older than the col
lege crowd. On Friday nights
a mellow jazz trio is
featured.
Magnolia's is closed Mon
days but is open for lunch
and dinner the rest of the
week. Brunch is served Sat
urday and Sunday from 9:00
a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Sunny days
are perfect to enjoy the res
taurant's large outdoor gar
den patio.

Southern gumbo dish. The
half-rack serving was quite
satisfying, but missed the
BBQ taste a true rib lover
craves. Magnolia's "special
BBQ sauce" wasn't so spe
cial and seemed very similar
to that of The Antique
(w liich has since closed and is
now called Crocodile
Harry's).
The gumbo had more zest.
It had plenty of shrimp and
scallops 111 it and the broth
was smooth, yet spicy. It
vv as a "true Southern
delight."
Other dishes offered in-

Willi! UIMIO UIICIWU lll
elude entrees like New York
Steak ($10.95. $11.95 with
mushrooms and onions).
Grain fed Cat Fish ($7.95)
and Steamed Clams ($7.95).
As well. Magnolia's serves
salads, pizza and burgers in
cluding: Cobb Salad
(chicken, eggs, blue cheese,
bacon, mushrooms and
olives at $6.95). Cincinnati
Pizza (with vegetables
$4.50, with shrimp $4.95)
and the Popeye Burger

amazed at the amount of
food we were ordering, we
continued. *' \re you sure
you really want all that."
she asked us point-blank,
seemingly surprised that we
could eat appetizers and
entrees. "Wait 'til we order
desert." we both thought.
Anyway, for our entrees
we opted for the Baby Back
Ribs and Magnolia's
Gumbo with Scallops and

Shrimps ($7.75). All entrees
come with a small dinner
salad, fresh vegetable and
rice or potato. The salad is
small. served in a
deceptively large bowl with
a "false bottom." and is
adequate but nothing spe

cial. The veggie selection of
the day vv;is zucchini and the
julienne strips were quite
tastv. We highly recommend
them. The gumbo comes
with rice and the ribs with
trench tries (also in julienne
strips).
The ribs weren't very
spicy at all — unlike the

(with spinach, bacon and
chcddar chccsc — $4.95).
No dinner would he com
plete without dessert, and
we weren't about to let our
stomachs or our waitress ("I
promise I won't tell anyone
it you want dessert.") stop
lis. So we ordered.
Alter we ga/ed at the
dessert tray brought around
to us. we went with the
Hush! Hush! Sweet Char
lotte ($2.50) and Chocolate
Velvet ($2.50). The Char
lotte was three truffles
with a praline filling. Talk
about rich. And not to be
outdone, the Velvet con
sisted of lasers of chocolate
and coffee mousse on a
chocolate bottom. Deli
cious!
Our total bill including a
bottle of Fetzer-Empire
/infadel (SN.SO) came to
about $43. One can get by
much more cheaply though,
depending on appetites and
selection of the wide range
of dishes.
A special bonus on Satur
day nights: Live perfor
mance by Dr. Robert and
Kenny Orcutt. who put on a
show of good, mellow music
to complement a full meal.
There seem to be a fair
number of regulars who
show up about 9:30 to 10
p.m. to listen to the music,
but not surprisingly most
are a bit older than the col
lege crowd. On Friday nights
a mellow jazz trio is
featured.
Magnolia's is closed Mon
days but is open for lunch
and dinner the rest of the
week. Brunch is served Sat
urday and Sunday from 9:00
a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Sunny days
are perfect to enjoy the res
taurant's large outdoor gar
den patio.

Southern gumbo dish. The
half-rack serving was quite
satisfying, but missed the
BBQ taste a true rib lover
craves. Magnolia's "special
BBQ sauce" wasn't so spe
cial and seemed very similar
to that of The Antique
(w liich has since closed and is
now called Crocodile
Harry's).
The gumbo had more zest.
It had plenty of shrimp and
scallops 111 it and the broth
was smooth, yet spicy. It
vv as a "true Southern
delight."

Magnolia's Ciarden
Restaurant
3877 El Camino
Palo Alto
424-8800
We had been to Ernie's
and A-1 Liquors main
times, hut had not paid
much attention to that
bright orange sign across the
street. Really, just what
kind ot restaurant would be
located in the midst of Taeo
Bell, Autoworks of Palo
Alto and the two closest
bargain liquor stores
around?
A good one.
We were surprised to find
that Magnolia's, which
opened in September and is
owned by the same people
who run Des Alpes on Cali
fornia Avenue, is a fine res
taurant. It offers a pleasant
atmosphere and a wide vari
ety of food.
It was fairly crowded the
Saturday night we visited
Magnolia's. We could have
grabbed a table in the back
room, the one with the
Confederate flag on the
wall, but we opted to hold
out for a table in the front
room. We realized it was
worth the quick wait in the
bar as we enjoyed our win
dow seat with it> view of
Frnitj's and A-1 and of
course those magnolia
planters.

The calamari was fantastic - covered
with garlic and butter, the tasty tidbits
are a must for any squid lover.

For starters we dug into
the muffins served at each
table and then went with
the Ringlets of Calamari
($4.95) and Potato Skins
($3.95). The Calamari was
fantastic — covered with
garlic and butter, the tasty

tidbits are a must for any
squid lover. Even those who
don't usually brave such
seafood should give it a try.
As for the skins, well, the
added bonus ot mushrooms
inside with the more usual
cheese and bacon stuffing
helped out a lot. but the
skins really lacked taste.

Smaller and drier than most
we've had before, we cannot
recommend them.
