Balls
and
strikes
Scott Tilley, a second-year graduate student in
aeronautics and astronautics, demonstrates his
form at Tresidder yesterday (at right.) Stanford's
bowling team bowed to UC-Berkeley on the same
lanes last week, when the Bears captured the
division bowling title. Tilley's form garners a
strike (below).
