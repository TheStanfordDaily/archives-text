Crocodile Harry's could be the definition of
"confusion." but it's not really that interesting.
The place opened a couple of weeks ago in
what used to be The Antique. Even it you never
dined at The Antique, it's probably sate to
assume that something was lost in the conver
sion: Whoever failed to do the remodeling has
tacked up a niish-mash of "art" on the walls,
most of which seems to he stutt left over trom
The Antique. All of which makes the decor . . .
well, confusing. But that's just the start.
We stood in the entrance waiting for the
hostess. We waited a long time, and employees
buzzed back and forth and watched us wait. We
waited mostly because there is no hostess at
Crocodile Harry's. We finally asked the
gentleman behind the counter. He pointed to
the "Place order here" sign and waited while we
examined the large chalkboard menu on the wall.
The bar at Crocodile Harry's is definitely one
of its assets. An engraved mirror with the res
taurant's logo is its standout feature along with
a realistic mannequin in a trench coat, who looks
suspiciously like an undercover agent. Bowls of
pretzels are provided, so it can't be too bad.
The choice of food ranges from hamburgers
(about $2.50) to barbecued ribs ($7.95). Also
offered are salads, pasta, sandwiches and ap
petizers. While examining the menu and
throughout the meal, it became obvious that

Crocodile Harry's was designed with the lunch
crowd in mind.
We ordered a zucchini appetizer ($2.50). a
hleu cheese burger(s3.2s). and linguine with
clam sauce ($6.95). We sat down and waited tor
our number to be called over the P.A. system
that treated us to Muzak intermingled with the
familiar "No. 57. your order is up."
We chose to sit in a booth that made it
impossible to see anyone else in the restaurant.
It reminded us a bit of a Meyer study booth.
When our number was called we had a bit of
trouble finding the pick-up counter but eventu
ally came back artfully balancing our food.
After an additional trip to find the silverware,
we were set.
Anyway, if you're used to the Food Service
system you shouldn't have any problem.
I lie zucchini was deep-tried and the serving
was generous. It was served with a "Ranch
House" style dressing and was good. It's prob
ably wisest to eat the zucchini first because once
cold it tastes a bit heavy.
The linguine with clam sauce was bland. The
sauce was rich and creamy, but it was difficult to
detect much clam llavor. And it you're into car
bohydrate loading, there's garlic bread to aug
ment the more-than-enough serving.
I he bleu cheese burger was fine, thanks to a
generous portion of zesty bleu cheese. It was
served on grilled trench bread and served with a
bag of chips.
All in all. for the price, it made a pretty good
meal.
