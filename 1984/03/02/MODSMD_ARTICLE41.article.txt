The (iay Divorcee (1934)
Festival, Palo Alto
Based — more or less — on
the Cole Porter show Gay
Divorce, this was the second
film Fred Astaire and Ginger
Rogers made together, and
their first starring vehicle. On
stage two years earlier, Fred
had sung "Night and Day" to
Clare Luce; although all the
other Porter songs were cut
from the film version, this bal
lad remained, and to its strains
Fred and Ginger dance their
first — and, many feel, their
finest — romantic pas de deux.
They also perform "The Con
tinental" by Herb Magidson
and Con Conrad, which becamc
the first original song to win an
Oscar. The day Divorcee, di
rected by Mark Sandrich and
featuring Alice Brady, Edward
Everett Horton, Erik Rhodes,
Eric Blore and (in a small part)
Betty Grable, is one of the
great movie musicals.
Plays through Wednesday
with Shall We Dance.

Shall We Dance (1937)
Festival, Palo Alto
This seventh entry in the
Astaire-Rogers series has a
hopeless plot that compels Fred
to masquerade as a Russian
dancer and, in one abysmal se
quence, partner Harriet Hoc
tor, the horsiest of ballerinas.
(She led the circus number in
The Great Ziegfeld.) Fred and
Ginger don't get nearly enough
chances to dance together, but
the score by the Gershwins is
full nl Willis: "' I.«_• t' ?> On 11 the
Whole Thing Off." "Slap That
Bass," " I've Got Beginner's
l.uck," "They Can't Take That
Away from Me," "They All
Laughed" and the title song

(which should not be confused
with Rodgers & Hammerstein's
inferior "Shall We Dance?"
from The Kinff and I). Mark
Sandrich directed
Plays through Wednesday
with The Gay Divorcee.
Lolita (1962)
Kresgc Auditorium
Though it was almost univer
sally dismissed on its release as a
watering-down of the novel —
a novel, incidentally, that had
been reviled in many quarters
on publication — Stanley
Kubrick's black comedy is pos
sibly his best movie. Vladimir
Nabokov did his own adapta
tion, retaining a surprising
amount of the verbal wit of
the original, and the cast could
hardly be better: James Mason
as Humbert Humbert, lover of
nymphets; Shelley Winters as
pretentious, clinging Charlotte
Haze; and best of all, Peter Sel
lers as Clare Ouilty. None of
them has ever surpassed his
work in this movie. The film is
overlong, structurally flawed,
and drably photographed, but it
is nonetheless one of the best
American movies of the 19605.
With Sue Lyon, certainly ade
quate as Lolita.
Plays tonight at 9.
Some Like It Hot (1959)
Kresge Auditorium
The setting is first Chicago
and then Miami, in 1929; Jack
l.emmon and Tony Curtis play
two musicians who have the bad
luck to witness the St.
Valentine's Day Massacre and
then must run for their lives. In
order to escape their pursuers.

they don drag and join an all
girls' band, where they — and
we — have the good luck to
encounter Marilyn Monroe.
Monroe, who gets to sing
"Running Wild," "I Wanna Be
Loved by You" and "I'm
Through with Love," is at her
sweetly ingenuous,
amateurishly appealing best in
this dizzy farce, one of the few
memorable comedies of the
19505, and her two leading men
give extremely skillful perfor
mances (especially Curtis,

whose imitation of Cat} Grant
in the passive-aggressive seduc
tion scene is a high point). Billy
Wilder produced, directed and
co-wrote the picture (with his
frequent partner, I.A.L. Dia
mond), and he assembled a
witty supporting cast. George
Raft. I'at O'Brien. George E.
Stone and Mike Mazurki show
up to spoof roles they played
earlier in their careers, and the
woefully underrated 1930s
comic Joe E. Brown gives his
most endearing performance as
millionaire Osgood Fielding,
who falls madly in love with
Jack l.emmon and delivers the
most famous curtain line in
movie history.
Plays Wednesday evening at
7:30.
2001: V Space Odyssey (1968)
Cubberley Auditorium
The famous Stanley Kubrick
film about men and the ma
chine and the cosmos. If that
sounds pretentious and oblique,
you're on the right track. There
are shots of a ship waltzing
through space that show wit
and style, and Geoffrey Un
sworth's photography is almost
stunning, but the careful
dehumanization of the two
astronauts (Keir Duliea and
Gary Lockwood. whose acting
makes it easy for us to believe
that they have no personalities)
is dispiriting and irritating.
Deliberately, Kubrick has made
the computer, Hal (whose voice
is that of Canadian actor
Douglas Rain) the most human
character in the movie — a joke
that wears thin fast. (The scene
in which Duliea dismantles Hal
is genuinely creepy, though.)
Based on Arthur Clarke's novel.
Plays tonight at 6:30 and
9:30.

Triumph of the Will (1936)
Haus Mitteleuropa
Leni Riefenstahl fuses
Greek, Roman, Norse and
Anglo-Saxon mythology as well
as biblical imagery in this most
famous and most disturbing of
all propaganda films, dedicated
to the deification of Adolf
Hitler. The crowd sequences are
in a class with the ride of the
Klan in Griffith's The Birth of a
Nation, and one Shot of soldiers'
arms raised simultaneously in
salute like so many self
propelled playing cards is one of
the most startling images in the
history of cinema. This movie
still holds so much power that
it offers an unequalled
magnetic-repellent viewing ex
perience. It's great, despicable
art.
Plays Thursday evening (in
German, without subtitles) at
7:30.
Pixote (1981)
Hammarskjold House
Hector Babenco's powerful
movie about a 10-year-old slum
child from Sao Paulo is sour and
hard-edged. Ft presents children
as innocents in hell — baby
faced nomads wearing grown-up
clothes, trying to play by
grown-up rules, clinging to each
other or to whatever adults
they feel can give them direc
tion, like the alcoholic whore
Sueli (Marilia Pera, in a wild,
brilliant performance), who is
more adolescent and less capa
ble of coping than they are.
Babenco grinds a heavy political
axe: By law minors are immune
from prison sentences in Brazil,
but resentful police officials
who are under the gun (of
politicians who want to be re
elected) to appear effective in
controlling city crime round up
street gangs as a matter of
course when,a murder is com
nutted. The kids are beaten and
thrown* into detention centers
that are as horribfe as prisons;
when some die, the blame is of
ficially laid on other kids so
that the muckraking press can
be led away from the truth. «

There's something of the yel
low journalist in Babenco. but
it his methods are occasionally
suspect, his motives are not He
and Jorge puran wrote the
sreenplay. With Fernando
Rarnas as Pixote and Jorge
Juliano. in an impassioned,
flamboyant performance as the
homosexual Lilica.

Sullivan's Travels (1941)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Iconoclast though he was, the
great writer-director Preston
Sturges was not immune to sen
timentality: it mars much of
this movie, which many critics
nevertheless consider his most
important (probably because
Joel McCrea piays a movie
director in it, with some Stur
gesian characteristics). Sul
livan's Travels isn't an easy film
to forget, however — it's one
of a kind, and some of it is
genuinely moving. John 1,. Sul
livan, the filmmaker-hero,
decides to dump his career as a
supplier of crowd pleasers in fa
vor of making socially conscious
dramas. In order to research his
subject — the life of the hobo
— Sullivan sets out to imper
sonate one. McCrea's co-star is
Veronica Lake; this is the
picture that made her a star,
and you'll understand why. The
Sturges repertory cast includes
William Demarest, Eric Blore,
Robert Warwick, Franklin
Pangborn, Porter Hell, Robert
Greig.Torben Meyer and Jimmy
Conlin.
Plays Wednesday with The
Great McGinty.
The Great McGintv (1940)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Preston Sturges had
produced some of the best
screenwriting of the 1930s (like
the 1937 Easy Living, which
Mitchell Leisen directed); when
he wrote this script he managed
to convince Paramount that no
one else could do as good a job
of directing it as he could — or
ask a cheaper fee — so he made
his directorial debut. It's a
worthy film, though because of
the dearth of political satire in
American movie history, it has
an inflated reputation. The
first half is solid: McGinty
(Brian Donlevy) endears him
self to the gangster (Akim
Tamiroff) who heads the T J*aeal
political machine by voting for
a mayoral candidate 37 times,
and his continued ingenuity
leads him to the governor's
chair. Once he arrives there,
however, his conscience.

prodded by his virtuous wife
(Muriel Angelus). takes over,
and a Frank Capra-esque strain
begins to sneak into the film.
(Sturges' later movies would be
more subversive.) Sturges was
beginning to put together his
rep company — we see
Raymond Walburn, Thurston
Hall. Frank Moran, Jimmy Con
lin and others — but Muriel
Angelus speaks in absurdly cul
tivated tones, and Brian Don
levy's performance is a little
lackluster. He has a lovely
scene, however, in which he
reads her kids a bedtime story
and gets caught up in it himself.
Plays Wednesday with Sul
livan's Travels.

The Stranger (1967)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In Albert Camus* 1942 novel,
one of the cornerstones of
French existentialist literature,
Meursault mourns his dead
mother without feeling, carries
on an affair with a pretty shop
girl without love, kills a man for
no legally defensible reason, and
is condemned to death. In this
painstaking adaptation, Luc
hino Visconti has preserved
every detail of the book, and
his photographer, Giuseppe
Rotunno. has caught the mood
of the squalid neighborhood
and the oppressive heat of the
Sunday beach scenes admirably;
it's a respectable film — even a
fine one — but it fails to
capture the esprit of the book,
which towers above it, out of
reach. As Meursault, Marcello
Mastroianni, though physically
wrong for the role — Meursault
shouldn't look so much like a
movie star — does first-rate
work, as do Anna Karina as his
uncomplicated paramour,
Marie, Georges Geret as the
pimp Raymond, Joseph Marec
hal as Salamano, the dog owner,
and Bruno Cremer as the priest.
Plays Tuesday with Death in
Venice.

Small Change (1976)
Cubberley Theatre (4000 Mid
dlefield Road, Palo Alto)
F/ancois Truffaut's tribute
to the resilience of children —

sweetly cnarming. n noi espe
cially memorable. In one scene,
the parents of a little girl
refuse to take her to lunch at a
restaurant because she insists
on bringing her stuffed-bear
handbag with her; piqued, she
locks herself in the apartment,
throws the key into a goldfish
bowl, seizes her father's
megaphone and announces to
the courtyard. "I'm hungry. I'm
hungry." The neighbors make
up a bucket of food and hoist it
over to her window. There are
\ other delights in this picture.
* too. though Truffaut doesn't
know how to end many of the
sketches. Suzanne Schiffman
collaborated with him on the
script; Maurice Joubert wrote
the lovely score; the cast in

message about children's need
for love.

Death in Venice (1971)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The middle-aged writer in
Thomas Mann's novella who
finds himself enamored of a
boy while on vacation in Venice
was allegedly based on Gustav
Mahler; to emphasize this
point, Luchino Visconti has
made the hero of his film (Dirk
Bogarde) a composer and used
Mahler's music on the
soundtrack. This is not a subtle
movie, and it turns Aschenbach,
the protagonist, into more of a
spectacle than is necessary.
(There's a ludicrous moment
when the make-up he has ap
plied to make himself look
younger runs in the afternoon
heat — a detail Visconti
§gb borrowed from the foolish,
major Brando. played
in Reflections in a Golden Eye.)
But it is magnificent to look
at. from the opening shot of a
gondola gliding out of the sun.
Plays Tuesday with The
Stranger.
