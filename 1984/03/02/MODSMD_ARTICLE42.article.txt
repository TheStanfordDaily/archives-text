# AT&T trustbuster returns
## 
### TED LEMPERT 
Law School Prof. William Baxter left his powerful
Justice Department post to return to Stanford last
month, but not because he was failing to accomplish
anything in Washington.
Rather, after orchestrating the AT & T breakup,
dropping the government's 13-year-old suit against
IBM. rewriting the nation's antitrust guidelines, the
54 year-old Baxter had symptoms of burnout.
"After three years, you get a little tired." said
Baxter, who headed the Antitrust Division of the
Justice Department from 19N1 through this January.
"Government jobs are killers, particularly il you take
responsibility for your job."
Baxter not only took responsibility for his job. he
also took a lot of criticism. That was to be expected
when he challenged the 90-year-old tradition of
strictly regulating the size of businesses and asserted
that the purpose of antitrust law was to promote
economic efficiency.
"Everyone used to talk about how imperfect the
market was. and how perfect government interven
tion was," explained Baxter, who has been at Stan
lord since 1947 as an undergraduate, law student and
professor. "There's now been a philosophical swing,
and the difference in attitude made an enormous dif
ference in what I could do and change."
What Baxter did was write new and more per
missive guidelines on corporate mergers and
substantially reduce the amount of antitrust litiga
tion brought by the government. The most publicized
example was his decision to dismiss the government's
case against IBM, leaving some 300 lawyers stranded
and saving the mammoth company headaches and mil
lions of dollars.
"The only question with IBM was were they com
peting too hard and being too aggressive," he said.
"The old rules protected the little companies by
making the big companies fight with kid gloves,
rather than getting the best products to consumers
at the cheapest prices."
Despite his favorable attitude toward big business,
Baxter said his emphasis was on the consumer, and
thus he said there was no contradiction between the
breakup of AT & T and his otherwise more lenient
antitrust enforcement. According to Baxter, divest
ing the communications giant allowed for continued
regulation of phone service while deregulating
AT & Ts remaining activities.
"Most Oi what AT & T does now is deregulated."
he said. "By breaking lip its activities tied in with
local telephone service, it's now possible to introduce
competition in a number of communications industry
fields."
Baxter explained that AT & T was technologically
innovative in its telecommunications research, but
that without competition the company's products
were redundant and too expensive. As for telephone
rates, Baxter argued that recent higher prices result
ing from the breakup are only temporary.
"There's great confusion about local rates going
up." said Baxter, who now publishes and consults cor
porations in addition to teaching his antitrust law

course. "Prices may go up for a period of years, hut
costs throughout the system will go down and on
average consumer prices will follow."
Baxter said antitrust decisions such as the AT & T
breakup were considered "politically untouchable" by
the White House, and he was given "total and com
plete independence" by the president and the attor
ney general when it came to antitrust. President
Reagan had no known complaints about Baxter's per
formance, but the professor said he would not give
the president's performance in office a perfect mark.
"I don't agree with everything that the administra
tion has done, even in areas where 1 had influence,
such as foreign trade policies," he said. "But by and
large Reagan's done a good job. especially in areas of
economic policy."
Regardless of .vhether Reagan stays in office for
another year or another five. Baxter does not expect
to return to government in the near future. The eco
nomics and legal whiz said he worked the same hours
in Washington as he does at Stanford (15 to 16 hours
a day), but that working for the government left no
time to keep up with the scholarly literature.
"You knew what you knew before you got there,
but you don't get a chance to replenish your knowl
edge," he said. "1 felt that if I didn't leave, 1 might
make a mistake."
