Amid much discussion of its con
trihution to "divergent paths of dis
cover).'' the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SI.AC) was of
ficially designated as a National His
toric Engineering Landmark
Wednesday.
"It is fitting that the presenta
tion of this honor to SLAC should he
made on Feb. the leap year, be
cause Si AC has pushed man's knowl
edge a leap ahead." s.iid Richard
Folsom. master of ceremonies at the
presentation and the past president
ol the American Society of Mechani
cal Engineers (ASME).
ASMF sponsored the presentation

along with the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (lEEE),
the San Francisco Bay Area Council
and the Santa Clara Valley Council.
The event marked the first time
that ASME has had a co-sponsor in
its presentation of landmark desig

"We're very honored to have been
chosen tor this award and will try our
best to lino up to it." Panofsky said.
SI.AC is the 1 2th landmark desig
nated by ASMF in California. Each
landmark illustrates a progressive
step in the evolution of mechanical
engineering, and each retlects its in
fluence nil society both locally and
internationally.
The program helps establish
"persistent reminders of where we
have been and where we are going
along the divergent paths of dis
covery."
