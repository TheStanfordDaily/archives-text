Hollings, Askew drop out
Washington — Two more Democratic candidates. Sen.
Ernest Hollings, (D-S.C.) and former Gov. Reubin Askew
ol Florida, formally announced that they were dropping out
ot the race tor the 1 954 presidential nomination yesterday,
citing poor showings in the lowa precinct caucuses and Tues
day's New Hampshire primary.
Both, along with Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) who
withdrew Wednesday morning, declined to endorse any of
their erstwhile Democratic rivals. Hollings, however, said he
intends to do so by March 17, the date of the South
Carolina primary.
I he withdrawal of the three trimmed the field of Demo
cratic contenders to five as they head into "Super Tuesday"
March 13. when nine states and American Samoa will hold
primaries or caucuses.
Askew s withdrawal may have a major impact on the pri
mary that day in Florida, where recent polls have shown him
running a weak second to Walter Mondale, but ahead of
Sens. John Glenn (D-Ohio) and Gary Hart (D-Colo.), the
surprise winner in New Hampshire.
In abandoning the race yesterday. Askew, 55, who ran last
in New Hampshire and sixth in lowa, said he did not have
enough money to continue.
Hollings, announcing his withdrawal in a Senate commit
tee room packed with campaign supporters, laced his an
nouncements with his usual quips and barbs at the press and
his opponents.
" The usual statement is, 'A funny thing happened to me
on the way to the White House,' " he quipped. "Well, noth
ing happened to me on the way to the White House."
Panel denies Salvador aid
Washington — A House subcommittee, firing the first
symbolic salvo in what members said would be a long
legislative battle, voted yesterday to deny the Reagan ad
ministration's request for immediate new military aid for
El Salvador and to hold up all military funds next year until
Congress is satisfied with progress on human rights issues.
In a 5-1 vote along party lines, the Democratic
controlled Western Hemisphere subcommittee of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee virtually gutted the ad
ministration's request for $8.9 billion in military and eco
nomic aid to implement the recommendations of the
Kissinger Commission on Central America.
"I think I'll go home and cry," said Deputy Assistant Sec
retary of State James Michel, only half-jokingly.
Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Md.), the subcommittee's chair
man. seemed almost as taken aback at the session's
confrontational tone.
"This is only the first step in a long legislative process,"
he told reporters after the vote, which was preceded by
three hours of sometimes-raucous debate. "There will be a
great deal of give and take. One would assume that the ad
ministration will give some, and there will be some give on
the other side too."
Syria, Gemayel agree at talks
Damascus, Syria — A tight-lipped Lebanese President
Amin Gemayel left Damascus yesterday after a second day
ot crucial talks with President Hafez Assad that an official
Syrian spokesman described as "positive and fruitful."
Although Gemayel characterized the nearly four-hour
meeting as "excellent," the impression of optimism was un
dercut by his abrupt cancellation of a scheduled news con
ference just before he was seen off by Assad at Damascus
airport.
An official Syrian communique said the two leaders were
' in complete agreement on ways and means to reinforce
Lebanon's Arab identity, unity and independence."
Neither side said whether Gemayel had agreed to scrap
the controversial 1983 troop withdrawal agreement with
Israel, although it is widely expected that he will do so. The
tone of the official Syrian press took its abrogation for
granted. The newspaper Tishrin pointedly noted the pitfalls
of those who, like Gemayel, had "bet on the Americans" in
the Middle East.
U.S. artillery spotters are
apparently target of Druse
Bayt Miri, Lebanon — A group of U.S. military artillery
spotters, installed in a Maronite Catholic monastery here, is
apparently becoming a prime target for Druse militia gun
ners firing from Syrian-held territory on the next mountain
range to the south.
Two Americans dressed in Marine garb were visible at the
entrance to the Deir Qalaa Monastery yesterday but
refused to talk to three American reporters who tried to
visit them.
The mountain-top monastery, a few miles east of Beirut,
was shelled again Wednesday night, apparently provoking
retaliatory fire for the second time in five days from U.S.
warships. The Pentagon last weekend inadvertently dis
closed the existence of the observation post when it said
American warships had fired into Bayt Miri in defense of
U.S. positions.
House may cancel MX project
Washington — Rep. Joseph Addabbo (D-N.Y.), chairman
of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, said
yesterday that the House is likely to vote to cancel produc
tion of the MX nuclear missile and reduce the administra
tion's $305 billion military budget request by as much as
$20 billion.
At a breakfast meeting with reporters, Addabbo said his
panel will find "$l5 billion to $20 billion" in reductions in
the fiscal 1985 budget request. He said "we have a very
good chance" on the House tloor of canceling production of
the MX, 21 of which were approved in a close House vote
last year.
Rep. Norman Dicks (D-Wash.), a subcommittee member
who helped engineer a compromise that led to approval of
the MX. also warned Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
that the program could be in trouble.
At a subcommittee hearing yesterday, he told
Weinberger that the administration must produce new
arms-control initiatives if it hopes to retain the support of
House Democrats who gave the expensive MX missile its
margin of victory last year.
Market stages modest rally
New York — The stock market staged a modest rally in
moderate trading yesterday, as prices surged in the session's
final two hours.
Oil and energy stocks scored slight gains, and were six of
the 10 most actively-traded stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange. Speculation persisted about potential merger
and takeover bids.
Analysts said the federal budget deficit and high interest
rates remained prime investor concerns.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 2.51
points Wednesday, rose 4.81 points to close at 1,159.44.
Big Board volume slipped to 82.01 million shares from
92.81 million shares on Wednesday.
