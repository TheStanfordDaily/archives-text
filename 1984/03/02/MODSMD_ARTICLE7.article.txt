## 
### 
From The Washington Post
Paris — France yesterday acknowledged that the
position of its troops in Beirut. Lebanon, had become
untenable following a Soviet veto of the creation of
a United Nations force in the city but insisted on
consultations with the factions in Lebanon prior to
withdrawal.
A statement by the Foreign Ministry paved the
way for an early withdrawal by the 1,250-man French
contingent by saying that France was not able to
shoulder the responsibilities of the entire interna
tional community by itself.
The French troops, deployed along the Green Line
separating Christian and Moslem sectors of Beirut,
comprise the only major contingent of Western
troops in the city following withdrawal of British.
Italian, and U.S. units of the multinational force.
The U.S. force is aboard ships offshore.
The Soviet veto Wednesday of the French proposal,
which included a call for the removal of the entire
multinational force from Lebanon and its territorial
waters, came as a bitter disappointment in Paris.

France's Socialist government has been exploring
the possibility ot negotiating a face-saving compro
mise with the Kremlin over Beirut for many weeks
that would create the impression of French soldiers
making an honorable exit.
Senior French officials earlier had gone out of their
way to draw attention to what they interpreted as
signs (it a changed attitude in Moscow, which has
opposed the deploy ment of U.N. troops in Beirut.
Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy declared after talks
with the new Soviet leader, konstantin Chernenko.
last month that there was a convergence of views be
tween France and the Soviet Union over the Middle
East.
French hopes that the Kremlin would have an inter
est in helping the West get oft the hook in Lebanon
in the interests of promoting the long-term stability
of the region now look misplaced. As the Paris daily
Le Monde commented yesterday: "When negotiating
with the Kremlin it can be illusory to confuse your
wishes with reality."
