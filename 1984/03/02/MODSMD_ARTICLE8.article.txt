# Shultz blames Congress for Lebanon

### 
From The Washington Post
Washington — Secretary of State
George Shultz charged yesterday that a
doubting Congress was partly to blame
tor the failure of U.S. policy in
Lebanon, and warned that the United
States may have to "check out" of
other situations abroad if congressional
restraint on the use of military force is
not eased.
Shultz, reflecting a bitterness that
many in the administration feel over
the collapse in Lebanon, said the con
gressional debate over the deployment
of U.S. Marines in Lebanon "just total
ly took the rug out from under U.S. in
terests" there by leading the Syrians to
doubt U.S. resolve.
The debate took place under the
1973 War Powers Resolution requiring
congressional approval for use of force

abroad. Shultz was critical of this,
saying it is not "a very good require
ment" and "ought to be reviewed by
the Congress."
In testimony before the Senate Ap
propriations subcommittee on foreign
operations, the secretary said bluntly
that congressional reluctance to deploy
U.S. forces where casualties are likely
has undercut the credibility of military
power as an instrument of U.S. policy.
"We are going to face many situa
tions where U.S. interests are at stake,
but where the situation is ambiguous
and can move in all sorts of directions
and where we could advance American
interests if we could apply a modicum
of force combined with diplomatic ef
forts and sustain (the force) over a per
iod of time," he said.
"If we're not able to do that, we're

going to check out of a lot of American
interests." lie added.
His warning foreshadowed what
could become a major issue in this year's
presidential campaign: the feeling ol
Democrats that President Reagan is
too quick to resort to military power as
a solution to foreign policy problems,
and the administration counter
argument that the Democrats' post-
Vietnam fear of conflict overseas has
given adversaries the sense that they
can act without fear of reprisal.
Last September, after some initial
hesitation. Congress authorized Reagan
to keep the Marines in Beirut for 18
months. But after 241 U.S. servicemen
were killed in a terrorist truck-bombing
of Marine headquarters last October, a

major debate broke out over whether
the Marines should be withdrawn.
Reagan first opposed withdrawal in
emotional terms, charging at one point
that House Speaker Thomas (Tip)
O'Neill (D-Mass.), who was backing a
pullout. wanted to "surrender" in
Lebanon. Then, just as Congress was
moving to vote on the issue and as the
Lebanese army and government ap
peared to be collapsing, the president
reversed field and ordered the Marines
removed to ships offshore.
His decision was made following a
split inside the administration that
pitted Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger and Vice President Bush
against Shultz. who believed that a pull
out would severely damage U.S.
credibility in the Middle East.
