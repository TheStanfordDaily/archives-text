## Eating disorders still present campuswide problem 
### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
bating disordeis ;irc among the most com
mon problems faced today h> Stanford stu
dents — primarily females. The most
common and widely known of these are
anorexia neivosa and bulimia, and both are
more practiced than was once believed.
Anorexia nervosa is the syndrome ol self
starvation, which has been highly publicized
in the media in recent years. Its victims deny
themselves lood lor a variety of reasons,
Irom problems with self control to the rigid
requirements of ballet companies.
Bulimia is the "binge and purge"
syndrome, in which bulimics gorge them
selves on great quantities ot food and then
may or may not Hush it out of their systems,
either through vomiting or laxative abuse.
A third disorder is bulimiarexia, where snl -
'ereis ieel driven to be thin but periodically
binge and then purge themselves.
I he American Psychiatric Association lias
now defined criteria that would help doctors
diagnose whether a patient has one of these
eating disorders.

The number of anoretics and
bulimics that have been
treated in recent years has
risen at an incredible rate

According to Dr. Harvey Weinstein, who
works with bulimics at Cowell's Counseling
and Psychological Services (CAPS), the num
ber of anorexics and bulimics that have been
treated in recent years has risen at an in
credible rate. Whether those who have the
disorders have sought treatment or even
developed them because ol the media
coverage no one is sure, Weinstein said, but
"five bulimics walked in here last week
looking for help." Three or four years ago
there were one or two bulimics seeking
treatment every year.
CAPS currently has two therapy groups
for bulimics which have 14 patients each.

Problems having to do with
eating have been found in
sizable numbers within the
Stanford population

In a study conducted among Stanford stu
dents last year, 24 percent of respondents
replied that they hinged periodically. Prob
lems having to do with eating have been
found in sizable numbers of the Stanford
student population. Weinstein said. A
follow-up survey will be conducted this year.
These problems are clearly not restricted
to places like universities such as Stanford,
although jJm .intent U> succced
academically and socially is cited as one of

the major causes of the development of one
or more of the diseases. "In all Western
countries, there are vastly increasing num
bers of bulimics," Weinstein said.
Dr. William Agras. a professor of psychia
try at Stanford who works with anorexics,
said, "We are seeing incidences of anorexia
doubling every decade." Presently every two
or three girls in 1 0,000 is anorexic.
Also, 2 percent of the population has
bulimia "of clinical proportions," meaning
they binge and/or purge one or more times a
• week.
Some victims are known to have been

doing this for 40 or 50 years.
Cultural stereotypes are most often
blamed for the obsession with weight in the
United States and other Western countries,
as well as for the subsequent development
of eating disorders.
"Since 1900. the average weig it ot 0..:
American female has increased by eight
pounds. At the same time, standards of
beauty such as Miss America or the Playboy
centerfold have gotten much thinner and ar
ticles on diet and weight have proliferated in
women's magazines. So you have this con
tradiction in our society." Agras said.
Research into thinness standards of the
past has found that the 1920s prized the
"thin look" to nearly the degree that it is es
teemed today, but there was not the same
widespread emergence of anorexia then. Dr.
Agras attributed this difference to the
comparative lack of diet articles during that
decade.
Experts even find that anorexia can be a
contagious disease among some groups, such
as sororities, where the pressure to be within
society's standards for beauty — and thin
ness — is intense. "It is almost as il the skill
of anorexia is being passed along," Agras
said.
Anorexia is commonly found in dancing
and athletics, two disciplines where the suc
cess of the participant may depend on thin
ness. Ballet dancers are stereotypicallv

Anorexia is also a contagious
disease among some groups,
such as sororities, where the
pressure to be with in
society's standards for
beauty - and thinness - is
intense

anorexic, finding themselves compelled to
weigh as little as possible and to exercise
constantly.
Eating diseases like anorexia and bulimia
have more effects on the metabolism than
just a severe loss of weight. Common amon.
anoretics is a loss of the menstrual cycle,
which occurs when the percentage of fat in
the body fulls below 17 percent. The body,
with its ready supply of energy fuel
depleted, stops all "luxury" expenditures of
energy such as menstruation.
There is also a lowering of the body's level
of potassium, which can cause the heart to
develop beat irregularities. Also, the vomit
ing associated with the disorders can cause
dental caries; acid is also brought up from
the stomach. In some cases, swelling of the
protic glands resulted. Use of laxatives
decreases iiotassiyni Jv'v.eis in the. pqtly. iipd

leads to the need ol increa ing the mineral
dosage in order to make tie body function
at all.
Another problem with eating disorders is
that they are found in a variety of forms.
"Most prevalent are the mild cases," accor
ding to Agras, meaning that some people
starve themselves or binge and purge once in
a while, but not to such a degree that they
can be classified as either anoretic or bulimic.
Another study is being conducted at the
Medical Center to determine the links if any
between anorexia and J a depletion of /inc

"Anorexia is a disease of the self
concept." said a former anoretic. a 22-year
old female Stanford student.
She was diagnosed as anoretie her fresh
man year <.>f high school, when she went from
113 pounds to (S3 pounds. "The most com
mon ages to become anoretic are 14. IS and
22." she said, "because that's when profound
changes are occurring: entering high school,
entering college and leaving college to go out
into the world."
Because of the incredible weight loss she
experienced, she lost her menstrual cycle for
four years.

'We need to . . . help those
with anorexia and bulimia
change how they feel about
food'

She said that her family life was the pri
mary force in causing her to become
anoretic. "I come from a very perfectionist
family." she said. A lot was demanded of her
and much of her life was controlled by her
mother, she says. Anorexia was a way of
gaining control over one aspect of her life.
The hardest part of dealing with someone
who is anoretic or bulimic is changing the way
she feels about herself. The former anoretic '
said that a great incentive for her to con- :
tinue starving herself was the compliments:
she received on being so thin. She said that
she would have thought that someone who
might have wanted to help her was insulting«
her.
Another problem, at least in her case, she
said, was that she needed "to be dragged to
the doctor," because she didn't think that
there was anything wrong.
The image of the body becomes almost to
tally distorted, she said. She remembered
looking into a mirror when she was wearing a *
size small in a child's leotard — at just over
5-foot-4 — and thinking that she still
needed to lose weight.
At one point she was even surviving on a
maximum of 300 calories a day.
"There is a vicious cycle involved with
these disorders," according to Agras. "First,
there is the fascination with food. At first
the anoretic or bulimic denies herself food
which is followed by hunger, and then a
binge, followed by a purge, which leads to
hunger, and so on."
Agras is beginning a study on anoretics
using drugs in an effort to cure anorexia.
"It is not just the problem of making the
anoretic gain weight. The old treatment
meant putting them in a hospital and put
ting them on glucose. When they got out,
however, they just went back to their old
patterns. We need to change that, to help
112tl h t ose' : vvith : artOrtxia and bulimia change how
they feel about food," he said.
