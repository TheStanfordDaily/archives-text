# Campus fire causes $200,000 damage
## 
### TROY EID TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
A noontime fire yesterday caused an esti
mated $200,000 damage to a campus home
owned by a Medical School professor and his
'wife.
Patricia Nagel discovered the fire in her
home at 884 Mayfield Avenue shortly after
noon when she smelled smoke, heard rustling
noises and saw an orange glow coming from
the house's second-floor deck.
Her husband, Surgery Prof. Donald Nagel,
was expected to return home last night
after a weekend of skiiing.
The blaze destroyed much of the second
floor of the home, including the living room,
dining room and kitchen. But both Nagel and
Fire Capt. Jerry Davis said the damage —
$125,000 to the building and $75,000 to
contents — could have been much greater.
The fire could have spread further had the
approximately 25 firefighters on the scene
not made "a really good stop" and contained
the fire within 20 minutes, Davis said.
Nagel said she had often thought about
what she would do if her house caught tire.
"I thought I'd pick up my purse and leave,"
Nagel said. "But I walked right by my purse
and my mother's purse and 1 said, 'Come on
ladies, we've got to get out." Shortly after
the fire was contained, a firefighter walked
out of the house carrying the two purses,
reduced to indistinguishable charred masses.
Neither Nagel nor her 77-year-old mother
or 84-year-old mother-in-law was hurt in the
blaze.
But, Nagel said, her mother-in-law, who
recently underwent an operation and wears a
body cast, would have been alone in the
house when the fire broke out if Nagel
hadn't made a sudden change in plans.
"My mother and I would have left my

mother-in-law in the house 15 minutes ear
lier because we were going to the nursery to
get a new plant," Nagel said, "but I stopped
to polish my nails."
Fire investigators worked throughout the
day to determine the cause of the fire, but
Batallion Chief Frank Fiala said last night
that he still did not know what started the
blaze.
Neighbors reported hearing an explosion in
the house as the fire broke out, and firemen
on the scene said they smelled natural gas in
the house. However, Fiala said the possibility
of a gas leak causing the fire has been ruled
out and that the explosion neighbors heard
was probably only the sound of the fire as it
raced through the second tloor of the house.
Next-door neighbor Tom Politzer said he
did not hear an explosion but saw flames en
gulf the roof of the house.
"I was sitting in the family room drinking
my first cup of coffee," Politzer said. "All
of a sudden I heard a crackling sound. I
looked out the window and saw all sorts ot
tlames shooting up. Once it got on the root,
the fire just took off.
"My mom saw it simultaneously, and she
called 911. The firemen were here in about
three or four minutes."
By this time the Nagels had already
evacuated the house, Politzer said.
"1 went out to make sure Mrs. Nagel knew
what was going on. But then I saw them
walking very briskly down the driveway and
across the street. There was nothing to do
but wait for the Fire Department."
Politzer pointed to a tall eucalyptus tree
standing between the two houses. The side
of the tree facing the Nagel home was
singed.
"I was afraid that tree might catch on fire
and fall onto our house," he said.
