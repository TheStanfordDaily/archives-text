## CIA makes its brazen return 
### 
For the last few years, we've heard
a lot about how the 1960s are over.
Hollywood has even made a movie.
The Bii> Chill, to celebrate their pass
ing. Like much of my mellowing gen
eration, I have hesitantly but
inevitably compromised my youthful
ideals and the realities of being over
30 (even almost 40) in the 'NOs.
Unlike some of my peers, however.

VIEWPOINT

until now 1 haven't telt too had
about the passing of the '60s.
Although I enjoy telling today's
Stanford students about how we
took on LBJ. the War in Vietnam,
and the Draft (the real if-you-go
you-might-die Draft, not just a
postcard registration), I also tell
them to be grateful they don't live in
an age of total commitment, where
you have to declare and prove your
moral and political purity in new ways
every week. All in all. those may have
been exciting times, but they were

A few years ago, Admiral Stansfield Turner, Jimmy
Carter's CIA chief, blitzed the campus for a day,
presenting a new image of the CIA as a non
interventionist, almost liberal government
research service, more an adjunct to the Library
of Congress than a nest of spies.

also very crazy ones, and the
casualties are legion.
The other day a former student
asked me to respond in print to the
full page ad for the CIA in The Daily.
I told him that I had given up tilting
windmills (1 teach "Don Quixote"
now instead: it's safer and more fun.)
It was time to pass the torch; let him
do it. Maybe if I could he amusing,
but how can you be amusing about
the CIA, for God's sake? So I let it
pass, until the ad appeared again and
again like a Lite beer commercial.
Now I realize that the '60s really are
over, all my anecdotes about the
Golden Age of David Harris and
Bruce Franklin notwithstanding.
A few years ago. Admiral
Stansfield Turner, Jimmy Carter's

CIA chief, blitzed the campus for a
day, presenting a new image of the
CIA as a non-interventionist almost
liberal government research service,
more an adjunct to the l.ibrary of
Congress than a nest of spies. All
that stuff about subverting annoy
ing leftist governments, sending
Castro exploding cigars, was a thing
of the past, we were told. Jimmy
thought all that was vaguely im
moral. 1 don't know if anyone was
convinced by Turner's performance,
but it doesn't matter now because
the current administration has
reversed even the cosmetic changes
and the "open government" rhetoric
of its predecessor.
And so the CIA is back, spending
thousands of our tax dollars to
entice Stanford students into its
employ. They are using all the stan
dard Orwellian language (remember,
it is 1984) about "career opportuni
ties," "professional careers,"
"personal satisfaction," "work of vi
tal importance," and so on. They

seem to want practically everybody;
not just the science and math type
for whom all the companies compete.
They want people with skills in eco
nomics, political science and someth
ing called overseas intelligence. (Are
there some Stanford students who
already know about that? Yes, I im
agine there are.)
Almost any subject will fit in if
you're the right person. Even law.
though the CIA wanting legal ex
perts is a little like the Catholic
church wanting experts on birth con
trol. They want to study it only to
understand its basic principles. It's
nice to know that the social sciences
have job opportunities — at least
they're not too fuzzy for the CIA.
Sociology was missing, it's true (too
left-wing?), and anthropology is

probably not relevant. Who wants to
know about primitive tribes in this
era of electronic satellite? Well,
maybe in Afghanistan: Who knows? I
hope you anthropologists gave it a
try anyway.
Of course, the humanities were
sadly absent from the ClA's list of
desirable skills for the defenders of
freedom. Philosophy, religious
studies, English, don't seem to have
much use. Oh, you have a double
major in 1.R.? Come right along.
And, say, doesn't philosophy have a
lot of math in it these days? You
never can tell — they might find a
place for that too.
I don't know what I'm worried
about. The University is still neutral
officially in politics — everyone
agrees on that, don't they? After all.
it's not as if ROTC were coming
back, or as if the White House had
snookered us into accepting the
Reagan library when we didn't want
it at all. We're just neutral, that's
all, calmly extending the frontiers of
knowledge and doing good deeds.
I don't know what I'm worried
about. After all, my hands aren't all
that clean. I too eat at the Stanford
trough; it's good enough for me. I
have former students who work for
Citicorp and Procter & Gamble. I've
made peace with that.
What's the difference between
those outfits and the CIA?
The CIA has lost its sense of
shame. They've come out of the
closet with a vengeance. My guess is
that they have done their market re
search well (the CIA is big on re
search, remember) and they've
gotten their money's worth from
their ads. I don't know what bothers
me. They have as much right to ad
vertise as the next guy, and maybe,
to borrow an argument from the
ROTC debate, we'll be better off
(safer?) with liberally minded
Stanford-types in the CIA. not just
Yalies and Princetonians. I don't find
that too convincing, however.
There's nothing to worry about. I
really believe that. I just felt better
when the CIA was ashamed of itself.
They were always there, of course,
but they weren't quite so proud of
themselves. I wish they'd tell me
what they're so proud about. That
would help a lot.
