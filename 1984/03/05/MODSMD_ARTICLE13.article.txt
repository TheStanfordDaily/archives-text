## Commissary closing: unfair to workers, bad for Stanford 
### 
William Massy, University vice president for business
and finance, has announced that management intends to
shut down the Stanford Commissary, costing eight union
members their jobs. Some of the Commissary crew were
here 10 years ago, when there was no union, and when
many workers were treated as an "underclass" with no
rights and low wages.
If management shuts down the Commissary, outside
vendors will deliver commissary supplies directly to
campus eating groups. These vendors often use non-

VIEWPOINT

union labor. This is a blow to the commissary workers and
to our union. We think it is also a disservice to the stu
dents.
The Commissary is a non-profit cooperative where all
kinds of supplies are delivered by outside vendors. The
Commissary crew unloads and stores the supplies, cuts
meat and then delivers small amounts to the eating
groups as needed.
If the Commissary is closed the following will happen:
• Many large trucks will deliver supplies directly to the
dorms and houses. That will mean heavy traffic, conges
tion and noise, often early in the morning.
• Small orders will be difficult. You don't call a semi
trailer to haul in 10 jars of mayonnaise.
• The people who deliver the supplies will not be a part
of the Stanford community and will not feel the same
responsibility to students that Stanford workers do.
Management's practice of increasingly replacing Stan
ford workers by people with no accountability invites
problems.
• In the long run prices will go up because vendors are out
for a profit, and they will raise prices when they are able.

• It will be difficult for eating group managers to get
the variety of goods now offered by the Commissary.
Massy justifies closing the Commissary by claiming it is
not "competitive." Workers, however, know that the
Commissary can charge competitive prices and break
even. They have watched in despair as upper manage
ment has deliberately let the Commissary be mis
managed the past two years, and then used this
mismanagement to justify shutting it down.
We believe that ultimately the whole scheme will tail
because of congestion and inconvenience to students.
But meanwhile union work will have been replaced In
non-union, and workers with rights will have been
replaced by workers with no rights. This is management's
real motive for shutting it down.
This replacement of union labor bv non-union labor
has gone on at the Stanford l inear Accelerator Center
(SI.AC) and other areas. Massy is now talking about
doing the same thing to workers at Stores. There has also
been talk of contracting out Food Service to exploitive,
non-union corporations such as Saga and Servomation.
Contracting out is a union-busting tactic used by anti
labor organizations across the country. This is wrong
anywhere, but we think it especially wrong at a univer
sity which is supposed to show some enlightenment. We
do not believe the Stanford community will condone it.
We in the union intend to light back. We need more
than sympathy from the community We need its active
support for the Commissary workers. To this end, com
missary workers and union reps will be meeting with stu
dents, RAs and Food Service workers to build support
groups in dorms and living groups. Please join tis.
