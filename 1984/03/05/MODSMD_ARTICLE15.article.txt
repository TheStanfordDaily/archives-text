# The 						conservative arts at Stanford

### 
Billions and billions of light years from here, in
the Almond Joy galaxy, there is a planet that has no
name. The planet has no name because its in
habitants are unaware that there are any other
planets from which they must distinguish them
selves. The highest form of life on this planet is the
baby seal.
The seals spend most of their time romping and
playing in the planet's unpolluted oceans and
making themselves look adorable. But once a year
they all travel inland to participate in the national
pastime. They journey to places where, just months
before, hundreds of human babies have been born.
Then the seals sit on rocks and look irresistible.
Overwhelmed by the seals' cuteness, the babies
crawl forward to cuddle them. When the children
come close enough, the seals clobber them over
their heads with lead beach balls.
Some of the seals object to this practice. They
think clobbering baby people with lead beach balls
is a bad national pastime. These seals think the
little babies are almost as cute as themselves and
don't deserve to be bludgeoned. They hang up
posters of cuddly infants with captions such as:
"Help me . . . and my friends." Then they tell their
daddies to give whatever money they haven't spent
on aerobics classes to the "Save the Second Cutest
Species" cause.
The other day, somebody stopped me in White
Plaza and asked if I would like to talk about
human rights. I told him there are no such things,
anymore than there are porcupine rights or
mosquito rights. I said it was fairly pretentious
to assume that humans deserve better treat
ment than anything else on Earth.
He didn't laugh. True liberals are a serious lot;

they think there's too much at stake to make
jokes. Republicans may club seals, start wars and
destroy the planet, but at least they're not up
tight about making ethnic jokes. Lots of people
make ethnic jokes at Stanford.
I didn't want to offend the activist; I should
have shaken his hand. But I thought he should
know that he was wasting his time here. I suppose

Ho w many liberals go to
Stanford? Let me put it this
way: I've met both of them. Just
about everyone I know here is
either a conservative or a liar.

he thought he he would find lots of liberals on
campus. Ha. Poor misguided do-gooder.
How many liberals go to Stanford? Let me put
it this way: I've met both of them. Just about
everyone I know here is either a conservative or a
liar. Oh. there are plenty who think they're chic,
East Coast leftists. They fool themselves a lot.
They tell themselves they donate to charity out
of the goodness of their hearts, and not for the
tax deduction. They tell themselves they're
voting for Jesse Jackson because of his platform.
One of them got offended when he overheard
me say human beings have no more rights than in
sects. Hut did he complain that humans were su
perior to animals? Ciod forbid. He said he
supported the rights of all creatures. He cited
baby seals as an example of his concern.

What this pseudo-liberal wouldn't admit was
that almost no one would give a damn about baby
seals if the furry beasties weren't cute and
cuddly enough to make even the Ayatollah go
"Awwwww." Face it, who's going to hang up a
poster of a flea-ridden gnu with the caption,
"Help me . . . and my friends?"
The would-be Democrat protested that I un
derestimated him. It's the clubbing he said he ob
jected to, not the aesthetic value of the clubbee.
It wildebeests were being clubbed, he said he
would flock to the wildebeests' aid.
So how many baby seal lovers care half as much
about something like the extermination of
aborigines? I bet the seals in Canada have a lot
more triends than the aborigines in Australia?
Why? Ihe seals are cuter. David Bowie wanted
his "Let's Dance" video to promote the cause of
the native Australians, yet whenever the song
appears in a club or on television, people start
laughing at the aborigines. "Wow, are they ugly."
Of course, none ot these pseudo-liberals ignore
aborigines because they're ugly. Oh no. They
simply tell themselves the problem is an
Australian one. There's nothing Americans can
do.
At expensive, liberal arts colleges and univer
sities, there are plenty of what the TV likes to
call "Beautiful People." These beautiful people
love to take care of beautiful things. It's the
ugly things they don't need. These people learn
here. I hey learn how to feign concern. In short,
they study the Conservative Arts: the science of
pretending to be a liberal.
