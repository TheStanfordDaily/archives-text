## Women's Center provides information and support 
### DONNA SHAPIRO 
Unbeknownst to many, tucked away among
the Eating Clubs behind Toyon Hall there exists
a small but important resource, the Stanford
Women's Center.
In existence since the 19705, the Women's
( enter originated as the Stanford Women's
(lub. For female students, the Women's Club
lunctioned as an alternative organization to the
Band and the Eating Clubs, which, until 1971,
were all male. Over the years, the organization
went through a series of evolutions into various
groups including "Half the Sky," before becom
ing the Women's Center.
Due in part to its many transitions, the center
has experienced a certain identity problem.
"Lor some reason, the Women's Center has
had a reputation for being a radical, lesbian hang
out," according to Renata Haskins, a member
ol the center's collective. "I'm not sure where
this reputation came from, but, actually, we're
an organiztion that's there for everyone."
Today the center is run primarily by under
graduates as a collective, with approximately
150 people using its facilities.
One of the most important roles of the cen
ter is as an informational resource. In addition
to the library, which contains books on wo
men's history, literature written by women and
teminist magazines, the center also offers the
latest information regarding job opportunities,
housing, support groups and health care for wo
men.
Relcrrals to other sources of information and
counseling are available us well. As Celeste
Landry, a staffer and member of the Women's
Center collective, stressed, "It is important to
have a center that serves as a 'first stop place.' "
The Women's Center is also responsible for a
number of programs available to the Stanford
community. Not only has the center co

sponsored the "Sex and Power" film series and
the speaking appearance of Barbara Ehrenreich
of the Democratic Socialists of America, hut it
is also currently planning the second annual
"Women in Music" day and a similar program for
women writers.
Serving as what Landry calls an "unofficial
umbrella" for many of the women's organiza
tions on campus is another of the Women's Cen
ter's purposes. The center is part of the newly
formed Women's Coordinating Council created
by Su Uhland of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents. This is a committee of all of the women's
organizations on campus. The Women's Center
also shares the Eating Club building with such
organizations as SURE (Students United for
Rape Elimination), REP (Rape Education Proj
ect), Aurora (the Stanford feminist newspaper)
and SAC (Students Against Conscription).
While, as Landry commented, the Women's
Center was fairly radical in its inception, and
while it is difficult to separate the center's
feminist politics from its programming, she says
the center is "not a political organization per
se," and accepts staffers of all political persua
sions.
In the future, the Women's Center hopes to
"continue to do the kind of programming people
want and to reach out to more people," and
work toward its goal of "helping the Stanford
women's community feel like a community,"
said Landry.
Haskins added,"l'd like to see the Women's
Center become a base for all kinds of women's
activities and also be a place where women can
just drop in and meet one another."
l.andry observed that "Palo Alto and the Bay
Area are amazing in terms of the resources for
women." It seems that one of those amazing re
sources could be right here at Stanford in the
shape of the Stanford Women's Center.
