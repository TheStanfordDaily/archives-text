## Chrysler chief lacocca criticizes business and industrial policies 
### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
"Detroit's real problems began in
California," Chrysler Corp. chairman
Lee lacocca said Saturday in a speech
to a supportive crowd of well over a
thousand in Memorial Auditorium.
He was speaking as part of a con
ference entitled, "We can make it!
U.S. Manufacturing in the 'NOs."
which was sponsored by the Graduate
School of Business.
California became a problem to
the auto industry, lacocca said, be
cause it was the first place where
Japanese cars really began to take
hold of the market.
He went on to comment on the
state of American industry in general
today, strongly criticizing the policies
of the Reagan administration as he
did so.
lacocca spoke primarily about
budget deficits. international
deficits and merger mania and the
way they relate to American manu
facturing.
lacocca accused the administration
of acting in a "who's on lirst man
ner in regard to the formation ol a
coherent national industrial policy.
He cited a number of examples in
which officials including President
Reagan. Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan and economic adviser Martin
Feldstein have contradicted one an
other in public remarks.
The national industrial policy is
"not sane, not rational. said
lacocca. He remarked that the
politicians he has talked with have
said that "they can't come up with
an industrial policy — it's an election
year."

"There's a new ideology on con
sumer benefits," lacocca said, ar
guing that the recent rash of both
mergers and corporate breakups
represents a contradictory industrial
policy.
He pointed out that under the
merger between Texaco and Getty,
two major oil companies, there was
the notion that larger-sized competi
tors would lower operation costs and
that the companies would pass ef
ficiencies on to the public.
But this rule, he noted, was not
held to in the case of AT&T, which
was broken up into smaller units in
order to work more efficiently.
This contradictory policy, lacocca
said, is hurting American manufac
turers and the American public.
lacocca also sharply criticized the
federal action allowing General
Motors (GM) and Toyota to produce
automobiles together. He said the
joint venture affects trade policy,
energy policy, and "stands antitrust
laws on their heads." lacocca, who
has begun legal proceedings to halt
the venture, called it an action
blatantly in violation of the law.
At a press conference after the
speech, lacocca noted that GM had
had a backup deal with Isuzu ready in
case the Toyota agreement fell
through — an arrangement lacocca
said was also illegal.
lacocca, who last year formulated
an industrial policy that both the
president and Speaker of the House
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill have called
"simple-minded," emphasized that
experts on Wall Street had consid

ered it viable.
The program called for both the
president and the speaker to agree to
cut from defense and social welfare

spending by an equal amount, with
new taxes to be implemented on
items such as imported oil and fuel
oil. In this way, he said, the federal
budget deficit could be cut substan
tially.
Deficits, lacocca said several
times, are among the greatest prob

lems America faces today.
Commenting on the title of the
conference, lacocca referred to the
spate of troubles the Chrysler ap
pears to have overcome. "It's 'we can
make it.'" he said, "not 'can we
make it.' I was at that party for five
years, and I didn't like it."
