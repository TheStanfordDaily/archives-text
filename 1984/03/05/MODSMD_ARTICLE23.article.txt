# Faculty commentary: Kay Sandberg Abe
## The 						role of global education in today's society 
### 
Kay Sandberg Abe developed
an interest in other cultures when
she first experienced life outside
the United States as an exchange
student. Since then she has
joined the staff at Stanford's
Program on International and
Cross-Cultural Education and is
a resident fellow at the East
Asian Theme House in Gover
nor's Corner.
Imagine, at the age of 16,
being plunked into a short, but
comfortable chair in a country
where you literally could only
say "ohayo" (good-morning)
and where you were told in
gestures that it was not accep
table to wear shoes in the
house. You are served a cool
milky white drink called
"calpis" (a sweet fermented
milk, which is much better than
it sounds, even at first sip).
Your hosts are visibly relieved
when you smile your approval
for this interesting new flavor,
at the same time suspecting
that more new eating ad
ventures lie ahead.
This first experience as an
American Field Service (AFS)
high school exchange student,
marked the beginning of not
merely an avid interest in
Japan: It was the beginning of
a commitment at a personal

and later, a professional level,
to understand Japan and the
rest of the world better. 1
knew after a brief summer
living with my host family in
Shimizu City, Japan, that 1
wanted to structure my college
experiences around my interest
in other cultures.
Consequently, I majored in
anthropology and minored in
Japanese and German lan
guages. I began to explore the
factors that make people dif
ferent and those that bring us
together in a common
humanity.
My fascination with cultural
phenomena in general and
Japan in particular led to a
teaching stint in Japan for two
years after graduating from
college. While in Tokyo 1
studied the impact of the rapid
urbanization of the
countryside on rural commun
ities at Tokyo University.
The experiences I gained in
Japan and upon my return
home with international stu
dents, were key factors in di
recting my husband Masumi's
and my attention to the activi
ties of the East Asian Studies
Theme House, where we are
resident fellows.
What, you may be wonder

ing, is a global educator? What
would you say if you happened
to meet one on the street?
What language would you
speak? Surely not Esperanto,
the so-called international lan
guage. which is dead.
While working for Stan
ford's Program on
International and Cross-
Cultural Education (SPICE),
for the past seven years. I have
been struggling with what it
means to be charged with the
task of educating others (and
self) about the complex, inter
dependent world in which we
live. This is not a struggle to
cram miscellaneous facts into
students' brains.
Rather, it is a matter of
changing perspectives, of hel
ping students at both the
precollegiate and university
levels to understand that we
must try to get into the skins
of those of other cultures —
to understand that other
societies have equally logical,
though often quite different
ways of ordering the world.
This is not easy for an eth
nocentric nation such as ours,
though upon careful examina
tion, what culture on earth
does not think its own is more
"human" or "logical" than all

others?
One only has to examine
world maps from various na
tions for proot of this ten
dency to consider one's own
nation the center of the earth
why else would a world map
made in Japan have Nihon

(Land of the Rising Sun) in the
middle? One wonders if China
has yet given up on being the
"middle kingdom" — in the
center of the universe.

Who knows, if the North
American continent had been
less blessed with ample land,
abundant resources and oceans
on two sides separating it from
other nations, we may have
been more outward looking and
tolerant of others historically.
The plain fact is. we in the
United States have not
realized until recently what
other nations such as Japan had
to come to terms with long ago
— that we need other nations,
and like it or not. what one
country does, affects all
others.
SPICE was created in 1 1 >77 as
a University-sponsored at
tempt to bring Stanford re
sources on various cultural
areas to elementary and sec
ondary schools. Over the years.
SPICE has been funded bv the
University, private founda
tions. the federal government,
and the Consulate of Japan in
San Francisco. In my work as
the Japan project coordinator.
I interact primarily with
precollegiate educators in Nor
thern California trying to
change teachers' and students'
attitudes about the world in
which we live. Our office also
works in several Western
states.

Colleagues similarly try to
influence how social studies,
economics and other disciplines
are taught to young people,
using countries in Africa. China
and I.a tin America as case
studies. Our jobs entail writing
curriculum materials, testing
them in the classroom, making
presentations at local, state
and national educators' confer
ences and sponsoring summer
institutes for teachers.
The need for a global per
spective is reinforced each time
I present materials to a class of
students, regardless of age. For
example, while pilot testing
some curriculum materials we
are developing on international
economics using Japan as a case
study, a ninth-grade student
was shocked to learn that so
called American cars are not
100 percent American in terms
of parts or labor. Then there
was the San Francisco 10th
grader who "forgot" that he
couldn't take the bus to Japan!
Thus, it is my husband's and
my own interest in teaching
and learning more about Asia
as part of our interdependent
world that motivated us to
become resident follows. Being
an academic theme house,

EAST involves us in program
ming which included various
Asia-related cultural activi
ties: martial arts, calligraphy, a
Chinese New Year's festival.
Asian food nights in addition
to our regular Chinese meals,
sherry hours and the forthcom
ing winter Main Event which
will he an evening of Asian Per
forming Arts at the Perform
ing Arts Center on March 10
beginning at S p.m.
It is typical of the house's
efforts that we balance an in
terest in Asia with more gen
eral activities, cultural and
non-cultural.
These issues and activities
are close to Masumi's and my
hearts, and we try to partici
pate. along with our two-year
old son Takumi. in as manv
house events as possible.
When it works. I think the
Residential Education system
is one of the best things about
Stanford for all concerned. I
feel lucky that I am able to
mesh my personal and profes
sional interests so well by living
at East House while working at
The Japan Project. I hope that
my fellow exchange students,
who also learned to like
"calpis." have found similar
satisfaction in their lives.

nocentric nation such as ours,
though upon careful examina
tion, what culture on earth
does not think its own is more
"human" or "logical" than all

others?
One only has to examine
world maps from various na
tions for proot of this ten
dency to consider one's own
nation the center of the earth
why else would a world map
made in Japan have Nihon

(Land of the Rising Sun) in the
middle? One wonders if China
has yet given up on being the
"middle kingdom" — in the
center of the universe.

Who knows, if the North
American continent had been
less blessed with ample land,
abundant resources and oceans
on two sides separating it from
other nations, we may have
been more outward looking and
tolerant of others historically.
The plain fact is. we in the
United States have not
realized until recently what
other nations such as Japan had
to come to terms with long ago
— that we need other nations,
and like it or not. what one
country does, affects all
others.
SPICE was created in 1 1 >77 as
a University-sponsored at
tempt to bring Stanford re
sources on various cultural
areas to elementary and sec
ondary schools. Over the years.
SPICE has been funded bv the
University, private founda
tions. the federal government,
and the Consulate of Japan in
San Francisco. In my work as
the Japan project coordinator.
I interact primarily with
precollegiate educators in Nor
thern California trying to
change teachers' and students'
attitudes about the world in
which we live. Our office also
works in several Western
states.

Colleagues similarly try to
influence how social studies,
economics and other disciplines
are taught to young people,
using countries in Africa. China
and I.a tin America as case
studies. Our jobs entail writing
curriculum materials, testing
them in the classroom, making
presentations at local, state
and national educators' confer
ences and sponsoring summer
institutes for teachers.
The need for a global per
spective is reinforced each time
I present materials to a class of
students, regardless of age. For
example, while pilot testing
some curriculum materials we
are developing on international
economics using Japan as a case
study, a ninth-grade student
was shocked to learn that so
called American cars are not
100 percent American in terms
of parts or labor. Then there
was the San Francisco 10th
grader who "forgot" that he
couldn't take the bus to Japan!
Thus, it is my husband's and
my own interest in teaching
and learning more about Asia
as part of our interdependent
world that motivated us to
become resident follows. Being
an academic theme house,

EAST involves us in program
ming which included various
Asia-related cultural activi
ties: martial arts, calligraphy, a
Chinese New Year's festival.
Asian food nights in addition
to our regular Chinese meals,
sherry hours and the forthcom
ing winter Main Event which
will he an evening of Asian Per
forming Arts at the Perform
ing Arts Center on March 10
beginning at S p.m.
It is typical of the house's
efforts that we balance an in
terest in Asia with more gen
eral activities, cultural and
non-cultural.
These issues and activities
are close to Masumi's and my
hearts, and we try to partici
pate. along with our two-year
old son Takumi. in as manv
house events as possible.
When it works. I think the
Residential Education system
is one of the best things about
Stanford for all concerned. I
feel lucky that I am able to
mesh my personal and profes
sional interests so well by living
at East House while working at
The Japan Project. I hope that
my fellow exchange students,
who also learned to like
"calpis." have found similar
satisfaction in their lives.

Kay Sandberg Abe developed
an interest in other cultures when
she first experienced life outside
the United States as an exchange
student. Since then she has
joined the staff at Stanford's
Program on International and
Cross-Cultural Education and is
a resident fellow at the East
Asian Theme House in Gover
nor's Corner.
Imagine, at the age of 16,
being plunked into a short, but
comfortable chair in a country
where you literally could only
say "ohayo" (good-morning)
and where you were told in
gestures that it was not accep
table to wear shoes in the
house. You are served a cool
milky white drink called
"calpis" (a sweet fermented
milk, which is much better than
it sounds, even at first sip).
Your hosts are visibly relieved
when you smile your approval
for this interesting new flavor,
at the same time suspecting
that more new eating ad
ventures lie ahead.
This first experience as an
American Field Service (AFS)
high school exchange student,
marked the beginning of not
merely an avid interest in
Japan: It was the beginning of
a commitment at a personal

and later, a professional level,
to understand Japan and the
rest of the world better. 1
knew after a brief summer
living with my host family in
Shimizu City, Japan, that 1
wanted to structure my college
experiences around my interest
in other cultures.
Consequently, I majored in
anthropology and minored in
Japanese and German lan
guages. I began to explore the
factors that make people dif
ferent and those that bring us
together in a common
humanity.
My fascination with cultural
phenomena in general and
Japan in particular led to a
teaching stint in Japan for two
years after graduating from
college. While in Tokyo 1
studied the impact of the rapid
urbanization of the
countryside on rural commun
ities at Tokyo University.
The experiences I gained in
Japan and upon my return
home with international stu
dents, were key factors in di
recting my husband Masumi's
and my attention to the activi
ties of the East Asian Studies
Theme House, where we are
resident fellows.
What, you may be wonder

ing, is a global educator? What
would you say if you happened
to meet one on the street?
What language would you
speak? Surely not Esperanto,
the so-called international lan
guage. which is dead.
While working for Stan
ford's Program on
International and Cross-
Cultural Education (SPICE),
for the past seven years. I have
been struggling with what it
means to be charged with the
task of educating others (and
self) about the complex, inter
dependent world in which we
live. This is not a struggle to
cram miscellaneous facts into
students' brains.
Rather, it is a matter of
changing perspectives, of hel
ping students at both the
precollegiate and university
levels to understand that we
must try to get into the skins
of those of other cultures —
to understand that other
societies have equally logical,
though often quite different
ways of ordering the world.
