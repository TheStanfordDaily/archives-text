## Cardinal looks up to heaven after beating Sun Devils NIT possible 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford basketball
team isn't camera-shy.
Playing before a regional
television audience, the Car
dinal held on to defeat Arizona
State 74-66 Saturday after
noon.
Two weeks ago Stanford
beat UCLA on television and
although the Cardinal has lost
three straight games since
(Washington State, Washing
ton and Arizona), Saturday's
victory could be enough to
propel Stanford to a National
Invitational Tournament
(NIT) berth.
The win boosted Stanford's
record to 19-11 overall, 8-9 in
the Pac-10, while ASU dropped
to 12-15, 7-10 in the confer
ence. Combined with Arizona's
loss to UC-Berkeley yesterday,
the Cardinal moved into sole
possession of fifth place in the
Pac-10.
Stanford Coach Tom Davis
said after the game that he
thinks his team has a decent
shot to get a hid for the NIT,
even without a victory against
Oregon State this coming
Thursday, although he ad
mitted that a win against the
Ducks would help greatly.
"I asked (Athletic Director)
Andy (Geiger) what he
thought we'd need for a tourn
ament berth at the start of
the year and he said IS or 19
wins was his best guess," Davis
said after Saturday's victory.
"We don't know for sure.
There are no guarantees, but
that win today really helped us
â€” a win on TV against a team
that really played well."
Geiger, who has been in con
tact with the NIT Committee,
feels that Stanford has a
legitimate shot at an invita
tion. "I think we've got a
chance," he said after the
game. "The style of play will
really help us. It's a great
tournament team."
The Sun Devils, who became

the first team this year to fall
twice to the Cardinal, opened
up a quick lead, scoring the
game's first five points, and led
throughout most of the first
half. Stanford quickened the
pace in the last few minutes
and closed the first period with
a 33-30 lead.
Before the game, Davis
made two changes in the start
ing lineup, replacing forward
Earl Koberlein with Hans Wic
hary, and point guard John
Paye with Keith Ramee.
"The players were hurt by
the fact that they didn't start
better against Arizona," Davis
said. "I felt that Paye and
Koberlein both had the same
problem. They were trying too
hard."
Ironically, Koberlein had one
of his better games, shooting
4-for-5 from the floor and en
ding the contest with 10
points.
It was a seesaw battle
throughout the second half
with Stanford never leading by
more than four until the final
30 seconds when ASU was
forced to continually foul.
Stanford went into its delay
game early, forcing the Sun
Devils to come out of their
tight zone and play the Car
dinal man-to-man.
Taking advantage of the
man defense, Stanford scored
several easy baskets including a
layup by guard Keith Jones,
who flew hy ASU forward
Steve Beck to give Stanford a
66-62 lead. The Cardinal,
however, could not shake off
the Sun Devils, who refused to
play dead and kept hitting with
deadly accuracy from the
outside. Guards Bobby
Thompson (11 points) and
Chris Beasley (23 points) and
Beck (21 points) led the late
Sun Devil charge.
With just 42 seconds left in
the game, ASU closed the
Stanford lead to two points
following a basket by Beck, but

Arizona State for the second time this season.
