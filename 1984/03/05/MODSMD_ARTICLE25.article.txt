## Cardinal looks up to heaven after beating Sun Devils NIT possible 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford basketball
team isn't camera-shy.
Playing before a regional
television audience, the Car
dinal held on to defeat Arizona
State 74-66 Saturday after
noon.
Two weeks ago Stanford
beat UCLA on television and
although the Cardinal has lost
three straight games since
(Washington State, Washing
ton and Arizona), Saturday's
victory could be enough to
propel Stanford to a National
Invitational Tournament
(NIT) berth.
The win boosted Stanford's
record to 19-11 overall, 8-9 in
the Pac-10, while ASU dropped
to 12-15, 7-10 in the confer
ence. Combined with Arizona's
loss to UC-Berkeley yesterday,
the Cardinal moved into sole
possession of fifth place in the
Pac-10.
Stanford Coach Tom Davis
said after the game that he
thinks his team has a decent
shot to get a hid for the NIT,
even without a victory against
Oregon State this coming
Thursday, although he ad
mitted that a win against the
Ducks would help greatly.
"I asked (Athletic Director)
Andy (Geiger) what he
thought we'd need for a tourn
ament berth at the start of
the year and he said IS or 19
wins was his best guess," Davis
said after Saturday's victory.
"We don't know for sure.
There are no guarantees, but
that win today really helped us
— a win on TV against a team
that really played well."
Geiger, who has been in con
tact with the NIT Committee,
feels that Stanford has a
legitimate shot at an invita
tion. "I think we've got a
chance," he said after the
game. "The style of play will
really help us. It's a great
tournament team."
The Sun Devils, who became

the first team this year to fall
twice to the Cardinal, opened
up a quick lead, scoring the
game's first five points, and led
throughout most of the first
half. Stanford quickened the
pace in the last few minutes
and closed the first period with
a 33-30 lead.
Before the game, Davis
made two changes in the start
ing lineup, replacing forward
Earl Koberlein with Hans Wic
hary, and point guard John
Paye with Keith Ramee.
"The players were hurt by
the fact that they didn't start
better against Arizona," Davis
said. "I felt that Paye and
Koberlein both had the same
problem. They were trying too
hard."
Ironically, Koberlein had one
of his better games, shooting
4-for-5 from the floor and en
ding the contest with 10
points.
It was a seesaw battle
throughout the second half
with Stanford never leading by
more than four until the final
30 seconds when ASU was
forced to continually foul.
Stanford went into its delay
game early, forcing the Sun
Devils to come out of their
tight zone and play the Car
dinal man-to-man.
Taking advantage of the
man defense, Stanford scored
several easy baskets including a
layup by guard Keith Jones,
who flew hy ASU forward
Steve Beck to give Stanford a
66-62 lead. The Cardinal,
however, could not shake off
the Sun Devils, who refused to
play dead and kept hitting with
deadly accuracy from the
outside. Guards Bobby
Thompson (11 points) and
Chris Beasley (23 points) and
Beck (21 points) led the late
Sun Devil charge.
With just 42 seconds left in
the game, ASU closed the
Stanford lead to two points
following a basket by Beck, but

Arizona State for the second time this season.
forward Jim Deines, who only
moments earlier had been
named Player-of-the-Game by
NBC, drew a technical when he
called a timeout with none
remaining.
Jones converted both free
throw shots, giving Stanford a
more comfortable lead, 70-66.
Moments later Ramee broke
free beneath the basket, took
a pass from Andy Fischer and
made the easy layup, getting
fouled in the process. Jones
closed out the scoring for both
teams, seconds later, hitting
the front end of a 1 -on-1.
The technical foul on Deines
put the finishing touches on
ASU, but Davis said later that
he still thought Stanford was

in control before the technical.
"We were still one (shot) up
even without the technical,"
Davis said. " The kid (Beck)
just forgot I'm sure."
ASU was playing a tight zone
and Stanford had trouble much
of the game trying to get the
ball inside, at times even forc
ing it. When the Cardinal did
get it inside, however, senior
Stanford center John Revelli
was effective, going 5-for-7
from the field. He also hit 5-
of-6 free throws for a total of
1 5 points.
Jones led all Stanford scorers
with 19 points but was not at
his best, shooting just 6-for-15
from the field. He made up for
it, however, with his defense
and on the boards where he led
the Cardinal in rebounds with
five.
Swingman Steve Brown also

played well for Stanford, hit
ting 4-of-7 from the field and
making all six of his free
throws for a total of 14 points.
Six of his points came in crucial
second-half stretches. With
just over four minutes left,
Brown hit an outside jumper
and then followed by hitting
both ends of a 1-on-l moments
later to propel Stanford to a
60-57 lead which it never lost.
Brown also hit both ends of
a 1-on-1 late the last minute
of the game to give the Car
dinal a 68-64 lead. He was
named the Most Valuable
Player for Stanford by NBC.
Stanford went into its delay
game early with leads ranging
between two and four points.
Davis defended the strategy by
noting that ASU had been hot
from the field while Stanford
had been having trouble get
ting the ball inside against the
Sun Devil zone. Furthermore,
he noted tfiat the delay tactics
had been successful the last
several times Stanford had
used them.
While the Sun Devils consis
tently shot better than the
Cardinal, hitting .558 from the
field (mostly with outside
shooting) compared with .479
for the Cardinal, ASU had
problems with Stanford's press
throughout the game.

Card notes
Jones became the first player
in Stanford history to score
more than 600 points in one
season, setting a Cardinal
single-season scoring record
this year of 602 points. Jones is
also fourth on the all-time
scoring list with 1502.
Revelli needs 34 points to
surpass Kim Belton (1615
points) as Stanford's all-time
scoring leader.

The fans went wild in Maples as the Card stomped on
Arizona State, 74-66.
The Stanford basketball
team isn't camera-shy.
Playing before a regional
television audience, the Car
dinal held on to defeat Arizona
State 74-66 Saturday after
noon.
Two weeks ago Stanford
beat UCLA on television and
although the Cardinal has lost
three straight games since
(Washington State, Washing
ton and Arizona), Saturday's
victory could be enough to
propel Stanford to a National
Invitational Tournament
(NIT) berth.
The win boosted Stanford's
record to 19-11 overall, 8-9 in
the Pac-10, while ASU dropped
to 12-15, 7-10 in the confer
ence. Combined with Arizona's
loss to UC-Berkeley yesterday,
the Cardinal moved into sole
possession of fifth place in the
Pac-10.
Stanford Coach Tom Davis
said after the game that he
thinks his team has a decent
shot to get a hid for the NIT,
even without a victory against
Oregon State this coming
Thursday, although he ad
mitted that a win against the
Ducks would help greatly.
"I asked (Athletic Director)
Andy (Geiger) what he
thought we'd need for a tourn
ament berth at the start of
the year and he said IS or 19
wins was his best guess," Davis
said after Saturday's victory.
"We don't know for sure.
There are no guarantees, but
that win today really helped us
— a win on TV against a team
that really played well."
Geiger, who has been in con
tact with the NIT Committee,
feels that Stanford has a
legitimate shot at an invita
tion. "I think we've got a
chance," he said after the
game. "The style of play will
really help us. It's a great
tournament team."
The Sun Devils, who became

the first team this year to fall
twice to the Cardinal, opened
up a quick lead, scoring the
game's first five points, and led
throughout most of the first
half. Stanford quickened the
pace in the last few minutes
and closed the first period with
a 33-30 lead.
Before the game, Davis
made two changes in the start
ing lineup, replacing forward
Earl Koberlein with Hans Wic
hary, and point guard John
Paye with Keith Ramee.
"The players were hurt by
the fact that they didn't start
better against Arizona," Davis
said. "I felt that Paye and
Koberlein both had the same
problem. They were trying too
hard."
Ironically, Koberlein had one
of his better games, shooting
4-for-5 from the floor and en
ding the contest with 10
points.
It was a seesaw battle
throughout the second half
with Stanford never leading by
more than four until the final
30 seconds when ASU was
forced to continually foul.
Stanford went into its delay
game early, forcing the Sun
Devils to come out of their
tight zone and play the Car
dinal man-to-man.
Taking advantage of the
man defense, Stanford scored
several easy baskets including a
layup by guard Keith Jones,
who flew hy ASU forward
Steve Beck to give Stanford a
66-62 lead. The Cardinal,
however, could not shake off
the Sun Devils, who refused to
play dead and kept hitting with
deadly accuracy from the
outside. Guards Bobby
Thompson (11 points) and
Chris Beasley (23 points) and
Beck (21 points) led the late
Sun Devil charge.
With just 42 seconds left in
the game, ASU closed the
Stanford lead to two points
following a basket by Beck, but


Greg Webb/Daily
Forward Earl Koberlein was upward bound in Saturday's game as the Card leaped over
Arizona State for the second time this season.
forward Jim Deines, who only
moments earlier had been
named Player-of-the-Game by
NBC, drew a technical when he
called a timeout with none
remaining.
Jones converted both free
throw shots, giving Stanford a
more comfortable lead, 70-66.
Moments later Ramee broke
free beneath the basket, took
a pass from Andy Fischer and
made the easy layup, getting
fouled in the process. Jones
closed out the scoring for both
teams, seconds later, hitting
the front end of a 1 -on-1.
The technical foul on Deines
put the finishing touches on
ASU, but Davis said later that
he still thought Stanford was

in control before the technical.
"We were still one (shot) up
even without the technical,"
Davis said. " The kid (Beck)
just forgot I'm sure."
ASU was playing a tight zone
and Stanford had trouble much
of the game trying to get the
ball inside, at times even forc
ing it. When the Cardinal did
get it inside, however, senior
Stanford center John Revelli
was effective, going 5-for-7
from the field. He also hit 5-
of-6 free throws for a total of
1 5 points.
Jones led all Stanford scorers
with 19 points but was not at
his best, shooting just 6-for-15
from the field. He made up for
it, however, with his defense
and on the boards where he led
the Cardinal in rebounds with
five.
Swingman Steve Brown also

played well for Stanford, hit
ting 4-of-7 from the field and
making all six of his free
throws for a total of 14 points.
Six of his points came in crucial
second-half stretches. With
just over four minutes left,
Brown hit an outside jumper
and then followed by hitting
both ends of a 1-on-l moments
later to propel Stanford to a
60-57 lead which it never lost.
Brown also hit both ends of
a 1-on-1 late the last minute
of the game to give the Car
dinal a 68-64 lead. He was
named the Most Valuable
Player for Stanford by NBC.
Stanford went into its delay
game early with leads ranging
between two and four points.
Davis defended the strategy by
noting that ASU had been hot
from the field while Stanford
had been having trouble get
ting the ball inside against the
Sun Devil zone. Furthermore,
he noted tfiat the delay tactics
had been successful the last
several times Stanford had
used them.
While the Sun Devils consis

Cardinal, hitting .558 from the
