# Grand finale for Jones, Revelli
## 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
Three years ago two fresh
man basketball talents came to
the Farm. They played on a
team which went 9-IK that
year, a team where the words
"run"and "press" came out of
a foreign dictionary.
Times have changed. A new
coach, new crowds and a new
brand of basketball have made
Maples a much different place.
And in the last four seasons of
basketball a flurry of records
have been broken.
Seniors John Revelli and
Keith Jones played in their last
collegiate game at Maples
Pavilion Saturday (barring an
National Invitational Tourna
ment berth and subsequent
home game). The two seniors,
who are shoe-ins as All-
Conference selections, stand
second and fourth respectively
on Stanford's all-time scoring
list and have set numerous
other records between them.
Revelli is third on Stanford's
all-time rebounding list with
822 career rebounds and now
holds the Stanford record for
most free throws completed in
a career (525) and most at
tempted (686). Last year he
also set the record for best
season field-goal percentage at
.671.
Jones set Stanford's single
season scoring record (602),
breaking the record of 553
which he set last year. He also
holds the single-season field
goal record (232), shattering
the old mark of 208 set by Don
Griffin in 1968-69.
Jones, who missed virtually
his entire sophomore season
because he was declared
academically ineligible, would
almost certainly have broken
Stanford's all-time scoring
record if he had played a
fourth season, but he said that
he doesn't look back with any
regrets. "I can't have those
games back," Jones said. "I just

decided to put it behind me
when I came out again junior
year."
Both Revelli and Jones were
introduced to thunderous ap
plause at a pre-game ceremony
honoring them and a third
Stanford senior, John Plat/.
Revelli, whose parents came
in for the weekend from New
York to watch him play, said
that he was emotionally
psychcd up for the game.
"There was no way we weren't
going to come out ready to
play today," he said after the
contest."
Jones said that he did not
feel any added pressure playing
in what will probably be his last
game at Maples. "I didn't think
about it much," Jones said.
"We didn't want it to be our
second-to-last game of the
year." Jones added that he did
feel kind of "sad" about
playing in his last home game.
Both Revelli and Jones are
happy about the changes which
have taken place in the last
three years and feel that the
program is headed in the right
direction. Although the loss of
these two seniors is bound to
hurt the Cardinal significantly,
both Revelli and Jones feel
that Stanford will pull
through.
"The program is definitely in
the right direction," Revelli
said. "When I was a sophomore
we won seven games. The pro
gram is heading the right way
and I think they'll pull to
gether somehow (next year)."
"I think we will continue to
improve," Jones added, "but
we still have kind of an uphill
struggle."
But for both Revelli and
Jones the biggest change has
been in the won-lost column.
This season marked the first
time in 11 years that Stanford
will end the season with a win
ning record and the Cardinal's
19 wins is the most since its
1961-62 season.
