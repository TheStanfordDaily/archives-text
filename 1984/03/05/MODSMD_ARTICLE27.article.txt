# Card opens Pac-10 season
## Sluggers drop 2 of 3 to Cats 
### 
By ROB /WHIG
The University of Arizona
exploded for eight runs in the
fourth inning and added three
more insurance runs in the
eighth en route to a 13-10 vic
tory over Stanford yesterday
in the opening series of Pacific
-10 Conference play for each
club.
The win, coupled with a 12-2
victory on Friday, gave the
Wildcats two wins in three
tries against the defending
champion Cardinal, and upped
Arizona's season slate to 11-13.
13. Stanford, meanwhile, fell
to .500 on the year at 12-12-1
and 1-2 in the conference.
Despite its inauspicious
debut, the Card's offense
showed a distinct taste tor
Pac-10 pitching after hitting
just .2N4 in its non-conference
starts. Stanford laced 10 hits
yesterday and pounded out 14
in Saturday's 14-11 win.
Leading the way was a red
hot Darryl Stephens, who
seems to be aiming to make his
final year on the Farm a
memorable one. Stephens went
2-for-5 with two runs batted in
on Sunday afternoon. He also
blasted his second home run in
two days in the top of the first
as Stanford roared out ot the

gate to a 3-0 lead. The round
tripper brought home Mark
Davis, who had ripped an RBI
double to tally the Cardinal's
first run.
As was the case all weekend
though, Arizona retaliated. In
the three contests Arizona hit
ters tagged Stanford pitching
for 45 hits, including 19 on
Sat u rday.
First, the Wildcats scratched
starter Kevin Kunkel for a pair
of runs in the bottom half of
the first inning to close the gap
to 3-2. Then came the fateful
fourth when Arizona turned a
4-2 deficit into a 10-4 cushion.
Those who had witnessed the
14-11 slugfest on Saturday
knew better than to head
home. "It's a whole different
ball game down Here," Stan
ford Head Coach Mark
Marquess said. "A lot of runs
are normally scored in this park
because the field is large and
there's plenty of room for the
ball to roll around in the out
field."
Marquess was a bit prophetic
as his Cardinal sprayed three
singles to net two runs in the
sixth. Pete Stanicek then
found the ballpark too small for
his liking when he tagged a
three-run home run to bring

the Card to within 10-9. But
Arizona secured the win for
Kevin Blackenship with three
runs in the eighth, highlighted
by Mark Wing's second home
run off Stanford's bullpen ace
Jeff Ballard.
On Saturday, Wing had vir
tually sealed a Wildcat win
when he crunched a Ballard of
fering for a two-out, two-run,
pinch hit home run that gave
the hosts a 9-8 lead heading
into the ninth before strange
things began to happen.
Arizona's Derek Hucnneke
was two outs away from giving
the Wildcats its second con
secutive Pac-10 win when he
plunked Stephens on the
shoulder with his first pitch.
Or did he?
The umpire ruled otherwise,
saying that Stephens did not
try to avoid the pitch. Accor
ding to the Stanford skipper,
"there was a little bit of an
argument," but the man be
hind the plate refused to ac
cept Marquess' viewpoint.
Undaunted, Stephens
launched the next pitch out of
the park to tie the game at 9-
9.
The Cardinal responded to
this bit of good fortune with a
five-run lltli that salted away

the victory for Ballard (2-2).
"It was a good win for us,"
Marquess said on Sunday mor
ning. "We came from behind
and then stopped them when
they had a few chances to win
in the late innings."
Stanford was up 6-0 before
three errors led to five Arizona
scores off John Radtke in the
third inning
Marquess, recently beset
with pitching problems, was
disturbed at the lack of defen
sive support given his leading
hurler. "If we hadn't made
three errors in one inning, I
think Radtke would've been
fine. That gave them three
more outs and they took ad
vantage of it. Radtke pitched
better than the score indi
cated."
If the Card's first Pac-10
victory was nice, the series
opener on Friday was anything
but nice. Arizona outfielder
Pat Coveney hit a grand slam
home run off Steve Cottrell in
the fourth to brake the game
open as the Wildcats tallied six
times to snap a scoreless tie. In
his next at-bat, the junior
tripled to knock in a run during
a three-run fourth.

Wildcats two wins in three
tries against the defending
champion Cardinal, and upped
Arizona's season slate to 11-13.
13. Stanford, meanwhile, fell
to .500 on the year at 12-12-1
and 1-2 in the conference.
Despite its inauspicious
debut, the Card's offense
showed a distinct taste tor
Pac-10 pitching after hitting
just .2N4 in its non-conference
starts. Stanford laced 10 hits
yesterday and pounded out 14
in Saturday's 14-11 win.
Leading the way was a red
hot Darryl Stephens, who
seems to be aiming to make his
final year on the Farm a
memorable one. Stephens went
2-for-5 with two runs batted in
on Sunday afternoon. He also
blasted his second home run in
two days in the top of the first
as Stanford roared out ot the

gate to a 3-0 lead. The round
tripper brought home Mark
Davis, who had ripped an RBI
double to tally the Cardinal's
first run.
As was the case all weekend
though, Arizona retaliated. In
the three contests Arizona hit
ters tagged Stanford pitching
for 45 hits, including 19 on
Sat u rday.
First, the Wildcats scratched
starter Kevin Kunkel for a pair
of runs in the bottom half of
the first inning to close the gap
to 3-2. Then came the fateful
fourth when Arizona turned a
4-2 deficit into a 10-4 cushion.
Those who had witnessed the
14-11 slugfest on Saturday
knew better than to head
home. "It's a whole different
ball game down Here," Stan
ford Head Coach Mark
Marquess said. "A lot of runs
are normally scored in this park
because the field is large and
there's plenty of room for the
ball to roll around in the out
field."
Marquess was a bit prophetic
as his Cardinal sprayed three
singles to net two runs in the
sixth. Pete Stanicek then
found the ballpark too small for
his liking when he tagged a
three-run home run to bring

the Card to within 10-9. But
Arizona secured the win for
Kevin Blackenship with three
runs in the eighth, highlighted
by Mark Wing's second home
run off Stanford's bullpen ace
Jeff Ballard.
On Saturday, Wing had vir
tually sealed a Wildcat win
when he crunched a Ballard of
fering for a two-out, two-run,
pinch hit home run that gave
the hosts a 9-8 lead heading
into the ninth before strange
things began to happen.
Arizona's Derek Hucnneke
was two outs away from giving
the Wildcats its second con
secutive Pac-10 win when he
plunked Stephens on the
shoulder with his first pitch.
Or did he?
The umpire ruled otherwise,
saying that Stephens did not
try to avoid the pitch. Accor
ding to the Stanford skipper,
"there was a little bit of an
argument," but the man be
hind the plate refused to ac
cept Marquess' viewpoint.
Undaunted, Stephens
launched the next pitch out of
the park to tie the game at 9-
9.
The Cardinal responded to
this bit of good fortune with a
five-run lltli that salted away

the victory for Ballard (2-2).
"It was a good win for us,"
Marquess said on Sunday mor
ning. "We came from behind
and then stopped them when
they had a few chances to win
in the late innings."
Stanford was up 6-0 before
three errors led to five Arizona
scores off John Radtke in the
third inning
Marquess, recently beset
with pitching problems, was
disturbed at the lack of defen
sive support given his leading
hurler. "If we hadn't made
three errors in one inning, I
think Radtke would've been
fine. That gave them three
more outs and they took ad
vantage of it. Radtke pitched
better than the score indi
cated."
If the Card's first Pac-10
victory was nice, the series
opener on Friday was anything
but nice. Arizona outfielder
Pat Coveney hit a grand slam
home run off Steve Cottrell in
the fourth to brake the game
open as the Wildcats tallied six
times to snap a scoreless tie. In
his next at-bat, the junior
tripled to knock in a run during
a three-run fourth.

Cardinal John Hoffman backstroked in a recent swim meet, but this weekend his team
went forward in the Pac-10 Championships in East Los Angeles. The Card won the
meet, and now they are focusing on the upcoming NCAAs. Please see story page 9.
