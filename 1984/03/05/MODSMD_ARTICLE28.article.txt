# Women lose to Arizona State, but in excellent spirits
## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Judging bv the smiles alter Saturday
night's S4-72 loss to Arizona State, one
might have thought that the Stanford
women's basketball team had won the eon
test. Though this was not the ease, the
Cardinal players and eoaches did have
plenty to be happy about.
The cagers were coming off their first
WCAA victory over Arizona on Thursday,
and the confidence was evident as the C ar
dinal played its finest game ol the yeai.
The Card, however, had the misfortune of
running into a slightly better team that
had an awesome game ol its own.
Arizona State was fortunate to get an
unreal performance out of guard Jodi
Rathbun. The 5-foot-7 sophomore had
come into Maples Pavilion averaging only
I 1.9 points per game, but she erupted toi
33 points Saturday, going 11-ot-19 tiom
the field, 11 -of-11 from the line, and dish
ing off nine assists.
The Sun Devils also got a fine effort
inside from center Kym Hampton. I lie <>--
senior, generally recognized as one of the

top players in the WCAA, scored 24 points
and pulled down a game-high 1 1 rebounds.
Stanford had a couple of outstanding
efforts of its own, though. Junior forward
Mary Bradach hit 10-of-17 from the field
in recording a career-high 20 points.
Bradach also pulled down seven rebounds
to lead the Cardinal.
After the game Bradach said. "This is
the best game personally that I've had."
She added. "As a team this is the best
we've played all year. I think the we
showed some confidence having finally
broken the barrier Thursday (the win over
Arizona) and now we know that we ean win
some games."
Senior guard Lee Ann Margerum joined
Bradach in the career-high department.
Margerum was deadly from outside in
scoring lb points. She also picked her spots
well, pieking up the slack on those few oc
casions when Bradach went cold. Mar
gerum led the Cardinal in assists with
seven.
Assessing the team effort. Margerum
said. "We played our best game. We didn't

make a lot of mental mistakes out there.
And — I hate to say this — it would have
been nice to get some calls."
That was a theme heard a lot during and
after the game. Stanford Head Coach
Dotty McCrea said. "I don't think you can
win a close game it you don't go to the
line." The Cardinal certainly didn't. Stan
ford never got into the bonus situation as
only nine fouls were whistled on Arizona
State the entire evening, and the Card
only shot six free throws all night, hitting
four, while the Sun De\ils were 20-of-23.
Despite this, Stanford came out hot.
The Card trailed early, but managed to
forge ahead at 26-23 with 7:31 leff in the
first half. In that stretch the Stanford
shooting was unconscious — 12-of-16 for
75 percent. In fact, for the entire first
half the Cardinal shot 60 percent, but
trailed Arizona State. 41-3 S. at the inter
mission. as the Sun Devils shot 59 percent.
Stanford trailed by no more than seven
for most of the second half, but could not
null to within more than three. Toward

the end the Card was forced to foul, and
the Sun Devils — Rathbun in particular —
were deadly at the line. Rathbun, it
seemed, always hit a clutch basket just as
Stanford was about to make a run.and her
foul shooting put the final nails in the cof
fin.
Joining Bradach and Margerum in double
figures for Stanford was sophomore cen
ter Sarah Evans, who finished with 10
points and five rebounds. The Cardinal got
solid support off the bench as senior cen
ter Judy Carter, freshman forward Kim
Mercer and freshman guard Erica Mueser
all chipped in six points. Mueser also dealt
out five assists.
For the game, Arizona State shot 57
percent from the field while Stanford
shot 55 percent. The Cardinal out
rebounded the Sun Devils. 29-26.
The loss drops Stanford's record to 1-12
in the WCAA. 5-22 overall, while Arizona
State goes to 5-8 in conference and 16-11
overall. The Cardinal's final game this
season will be Saturday night at Maples
against San Diego State.
