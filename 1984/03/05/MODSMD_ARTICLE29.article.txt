## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
II there we're any doubts as to how good
the Stanford women's tennis team is this
season, the top-ranked Cardinal went a long
way toward answering them Friday b\ shut
ting out No. 10-ranked UC-Berkeley. 9-0.
The Cardinal took five of the six singles
matches in straight sets. Leading the way was
freshman Patty lendiek, who defeated
Heather I this. (i-2, 6-3, at No. 1. Lendiek
was totally in control of the tirst set. but she
had a little more difficulty in the second,
where it was tied 3-3 before she closed out
the set.
Junior Linda Gates had a little tougher
time ol it at No. 2 against Linda Oechsle.
The Cal freshman is the top. player in the
Bears' lineup, hut was playing down a position
because she had been sidelined for the past
two weeks. I he match went back and forth,
but (iates gained control and registered a 6-
3, 6-4 victory.
At third singles, sophomore Kate Gompert
defeated Mary Margaret Torres. 6-0, 6-4.
Gompert simply dominated the first set, but
Torres regained her cool and gave Gompert a
run lor it in the second before falling.
The only difficulty the Card ran into in
singles came at No. 4, where freshman Step
hanie Savides outlasted Vickie Corrales. 3-6,
6-3, 6-3. Savides had an off afternoon and
played poorly in dropping the first set, but
she came back and played well enough to win
the next two.
At fifth singles, senior Michelle Weiss had
no difficulty with Julie Grummel, winning
handily, 6-2. 6-3. while at No. 6. sophomore
Alyce Werdel played a long baseline game to

dispose of Stacy Savides. 6-1. 6-j.
Lhe first doubles match proved to be the
most exciting of the day as Stephanie Savides
and Gates earned a hard-fought 5-7. 6-4. 7-6
victory over Corrales and Torres.
The first set was tied at 5-5 when Cal held
its serve to make it 6-5. and Savides then lost
her service as she double-faulted on set point,
lhe second set was also even until the Card
duo broke service to take a 5 3 lead and
enable Gates to serve out the set.
The third set was again a back-and-forth
affair that, as the sun disappeared into the
foothills, had the loyalists who had stayed, on
the edge of their seats. Neither side could
gain more than a one-game lead. Stanford
broke Torres' serve to take a 6-5 lead, but Cal
returned the favor by breaking Savides' serve
to make it 6-6 and force a tie-breaker.
Cal quickly jumped out to a 4-1 lead in the
tie-breaker, where the first team to seven
wins the match. Stanford stormed back,
though, taking the next six points to win in
an emotional finish, 7-4.
Stanford Head Coach Frank Brennan was
happy with the match. "We had some real
crowd-pleasers out there today," he said.
"Linda and Stephanie had some tremendous
points out there, and I think the crowd really
enjoyed it."
The Cardinal had no difficulty in the other
doubles matches. Gompert and Weiss over
whelmed Oechsle and Caroline Yao, 6-2. 6-1,
at No. 2. and Lendiek and Werdel dispatched
Corrales and Stacy Savides, 6-2, 6-2.
The win keeps Stanford undefeated at 6-0
this season, while Cal falls to 5-3. The Card's
next match is Friday, when Arizona State
visits the Farm.
