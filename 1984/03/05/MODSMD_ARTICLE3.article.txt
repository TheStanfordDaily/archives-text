Speakers at Saturday's Business
School conference on U.S. manufac
turing in the 1980s emphasized
that America needs to regain its abil
ity to compete on an equal footing
with other industrial nations.
"Competitiveness is not politically
sexy," said John Young, president
and chief executive officer of
Hewlett-Packard, whose speech
opened the all-day conference.
No American, he said, is pleased at
the prospect of being a "cringing
giant," he said, and our national se
curity is dependent upon our ability
to compete. In order to become more
competitive. Young emphasized, the
United States must be willing to
change the ways a lot of things are
done.
"American management needs to
rethink assumptions" it has made on
how business should be run. Young
said, particularly because of the chal
lenges that are being made by devel
oping countries. These countries, he
pointed out, have vast numbers of
production workers that accept less
pay than those of the United States.
Part of the problem, said Young,
who is a member of the Stanford
Board of Trustees, must be traced to
the universities. Although the ques
tion of whether there are enough
scientists and engineers is one of the
most important of the technological
revolution. Young said, equipment in
many universities is outdated and in
centives need to be created for train
ing.
The United States reinvests only 3
percent of its gross national product
in capital resources, according to
Young, who cited higher figures for
other major industrial nations.

"Underinvestment," he said, "is
hurting our ability to compete."
Saying that a major restriction on
the nation's ability o compete
comes from governmen 1 policies.
Young said, "Governnu deficits
absorb private savings."
Young said there have In few
encouraging signs of cooperai 1 be
tween government, managemei and
labor — the three major sectors in
volved in industry. "Government and
industry . . . have little collabora
tion." he said. Between management
and labor there is "a paralyzing
animosity," and "we can't afford it."
Young said it is important that
there be a national understanding of
the importance of competitiveness.
We must "build on the strengths —
technology and human resources." he
said. "The competitiveness of indus
try should be a national goal.
"Denying the force of the free
market is futile," Young said in em
phasizing that business, particularly
the manufacturing business, must
survive in the marketplace on its
own. "You can't legislate success," he
said.
In a press conference after his
speech Young said that he thought
that the Center for Integrated Sys
tems, created by Stanford and a
number of high-tech companies to do
further research together is
"isolated but not unimportant." In
his view, however, such industrial
academic cooperation is "not a viable
solution," given the amount of
money invested by the different
companies in only one such center.
Later in the morning a panel
moderated by Ezra Solomon, a pro
fessor at the Business School, dis
