### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
Speakers at Saturday's Business
School conference on U.S. manufac
turing in the 1980s emphasized
that America needs to regain its abil
ity to compete on an equal footing
with other industrial nations.
"Competitiveness is not politically
sexy," said John Young, president
and chief executive officer of
Hewlett-Packard, whose speech
opened the all-day conference.
No American, he said, is pleased at
the prospect of being a "cringing
giant," he said, and our national se
curity is dependent upon our ability
to compete. In order to become more
competitive. Young emphasized, the
United States must be willing to
change the ways a lot of things are
done.
"American management needs to
rethink assumptions" it has made on
how business should be run. Young
said, particularly because of the chal
lenges that are being made by devel
oping countries. These countries, he
pointed out, have vast numbers of
production workers that accept less
pay than those of the United States.
Part of the problem, said Young,
who is a member of the Stanford
Board of Trustees, must be traced to
the universities. Although the ques
tion of whether there are enough
scientists and engineers is one of the
most important of the technological
revolution. Young said, equipment in
many universities is outdated and in
centives need to be created for train
ing.
The United States reinvests only 3
percent of its gross national product
in capital resources, according to
Young, who cited higher figures for
other major industrial nations.

"Underinvestment," he said, "is
hurting our ability to compete."
Saying that a major restriction on
the nation's ability o compete
comes from governmen 1 policies.
Young said, "Governnu deficits
absorb private savings."
Young said there have In few
encouraging signs of cooperai 1 be
tween government, managemei and
labor — the three major sectors in
volved in industry. "Government and
industry . . . have little collabora
tion." he said. Between management
and labor there is "a paralyzing
animosity," and "we can't afford it."
Young said it is important that
there be a national understanding of
the importance of competitiveness.
We must "build on the strengths —
technology and human resources." he
said. "The competitiveness of indus
try should be a national goal.
"Denying the force of the free
market is futile," Young said in em
phasizing that business, particularly
the manufacturing business, must
survive in the marketplace on its
own. "You can't legislate success," he
said.
In a press conference after his
speech Young said that he thought
that the Center for Integrated Sys
tems, created by Stanford and a
number of high-tech companies to do
further research together is
"isolated but not unimportant." In
his view, however, such industrial
academic cooperation is "not a viable
solution," given the amount of
money invested by the different
companies in only one such center.
Later in the morning a panel
moderated by Ezra Solomon, a pro
fessor at the Business School, dis
cussed American industrial policy.
Panel members included Adlai
Stevenson, who was a Democratic
senator I'rom Illinois for 12 years:
Charles Schultze. who was chairman
of the Council of Economic Advisers
in the Carter administration: and Ed
Zschau. who is the Republican con
gressman from Sunnyvale.
Schultze said that in the 1970s
there was definite growth in indus
try: in employment, output, exports
and even in manufacturing.
" In the last three years." Schultze
said, referring to the recession,
"manufacturing production fell
much more than did the GNP."
Schultze blamed President
Reagan's economic program for the
recent fall-off in production. "There
is an extremely loose budget policy
and a tight fiscal policy. That's lousy
policy."
Stevenson said that the most im
portant element in forming a ra
tional industrial policy is in bringing

coherence to the process. "We need
political realism." Stevenson said.
/schau. who taught at both Stan
ford's and Harvard's business schools
before being elected to Congress,
listed some basic guidelines for
stimulating industry.
Saying that business students are
not generally given a background in
manufacturing, lie said. "We need a
deep commitment to basic research."
He also cited the need to have
"incentives for risk-takers." more
training of workers and more eco
nomic opportunities.
/schau. critical of current eco
nomic policy, said that a "strong
domestic policy" would lead to com
petitiveness abroad.
Stevenson added that "the power
to say 'no' " and consolidation ot the
authoritative bodies (labor, manage
ment and the government) are im
portant in the "formulation and
implementation" of industrial policy.
At the news conference. Steven
son said that the experiences of
Vietnam and Watergate had led to a
"fit of righteousness" that brought
policy-making so much out in the

open that it became subject to the
power of special interest groups.
That, according to Stevenson, is
part of the problem ot getting a
strict policy through the legislative
process. There is difficulty in saying
"no" to each group's demands, he
said.
•■You can make tough choices in
private." he said. "Yes. I would say
close the doors again . . . let them
undo (in private) what they have
done publicly."
/schau said that reducing the
"adversarial nature" ot relations be
tween labor and government is very
important. When that relationship is
discussed, it is usually assumed
"organized labor and organized busi
ness represent the public interest" —
a wrong assumption, according to
/schau.
In the morning and afternoon a
number of workshops having to do
with industry-related topics took
place. They included speakers on the
subject of quality, the role ot com
puters and the problems ot a compa
ny relocating its manufacturing
center overseas.
