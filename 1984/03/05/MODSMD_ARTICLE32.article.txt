# Trouble for Ueberroth?

### 
Tampa, Fla. (AP) â€” For
newly elected baseball Com
missioner Peter Ueberroth,
who already must or
chestrate the largest sport
ing event in the nation's
history, the problems may
just be beginning.
Ueberroth, running the
Los Angeles Olympics, in
herits major fiscal woes,
squabbling owners, soaring
salaries and an increasing

concern about drugs when
he becomes the commission
er of baseball on Oct. 1.
For a self-described
"stranger to baseball,"
Ueberroth, 46, is "walking
into a hornet's nest," says
Chicago White Sox Presi
dent Eddie Einhorn.
"I told the owners that
this is no miracle man
before them," Ueberroth

said while being introduced
Saturday as heir to Bowie
Kuhn.
"I grew up in sports, and
played every sport that was
in season, but my back
ground is not in baseball at
all. 1 went to college on an
athletic scholarship, and
probably wouldn't have
been able to go to college
without it ... in the sport
of water polo."
