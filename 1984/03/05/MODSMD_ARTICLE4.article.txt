# Lake remains full despite landslide damage
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
In February 1983, a landslide at the Golf
Course damaged the flume that tills Lake
Lagunita. and the damage — which threatened
tn leave the lake dr> by Commencement — has
gone unrepaired since.
But. as a result of efforts by the Planning Of
fice and the Lake Commission, the lake will stay
at a serviceable level until Commencement, and
the damaged flume will be replaced over the sum
mer.
The flume, which transfers water from the San
Francisquito Creek to Lake Lag. is the most im
portant of several sources used to till the lake.
The flume's collapse cut off the main water
supply to Lag. and as a result the lake was practi
cally dry bv Commencement weekend.
According to L'tilities Systems Manager
Cheryl Jensen, the lake will be kept ser\iceably
full tiiis \ear even thouuh the flume has not been

repaired. "We have several reserve wells that we
plan to pump to keep the lake at a nine-foot
level." she said.
Assistant Dean of Students Margaret Fidler
said a nine-foot water level would mean that the
lake could he used for swimming, sailing and raf
ting. "We've talked to the ASSU people and the
sailing director and they assured us there would
be sufficient water." she said.
The lake is customarily drained each summer to
prevent the water from stagnating: this summer
when the water goes, the repairs begin. "We plan
to abandon the part of the flume that has been
destroyed." Jensen said, "and re-route the rest."
I idler said that the re-routed flume would mean
that the lake would fill each year "unless there
was an out-and-out drought."
The repair plan is part of a package of con
struction projects approved at last month's
Board of Trustees meeting. The cost of the
repair, according to Jensen, "hasn't been look at

that closely." though Jensen added it would cer
tainly be more than $100,000.
"The project will hopefully be completed b\
fall," Jensen said.
The repairs will be overseen by the newly
formed Lake Commission, an ad hoc group ot
students, faculty and staff members responsible
for various aspects of lake management. Accor
ding to commission Chairman I idler, the panel
was formed because "there is no one person or
office responsible for the management ot l.ake
Lagunita."
The role of the commission, she said, is to pro
vide a means of communication among those in
volved with the care of Lake Lagunita. For
example, the committee met informally last
spring to discuss the erection of signs around the
lake warning of legal and illegal swimming areas,
and to consider ways to improve the safety ot
the swimming area, which was becoming increas
ingly clogged with Big Way yachts.
