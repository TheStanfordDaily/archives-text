in the southern front of the Gulf War early yesterday.

Feb. 21. At the same time. 11 Iraqi helicopters had been
shot down. IRNA said.

wounded by Iraqi chemical bombs had been taken to hospi
tals in Sweden. Switzerland and Austria for treatment.
IRNA said that around 1000 Iranian troops had been
wounded by Iraqi chemical bombs.
In Baghdad, the daily Al-Thawra reported yesterday that
in recent fighting in Misan province, Iraqi women fought
alongside Iraqi men when the village of Kasara was attacked
by Iranian forces.
The newspaper cited a villager as saying that in spite of
the Iranian attack using heavy arms, the villagers "managed
to kill a number of the penetrators."
Other press reports, meanwhile, said that Iran had
mobilized 500.000 soldiers to prepare a new offensive
against 250.000 Iraqi troops.

killed in fighting near Basrah, in the southern area of the
war front.

Iranian and other official sources, Iranian offshore oil wells
damaged by Iraqi air attacks a year ago are still in flames, it

Kohl calls for U.S.-Soviet talks
Washington — West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
called yesterday for an early summit meeting between Pres
ident Reagan and Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko and
said that the United States "must not lose any time" in
working to improve its relationship with the Soviet Union.
"Every chance (to talk) should be used, because the al
ternative would be war—and given present conditions and
weapons, that would be catastrophic, apocalyptic," Kohl
said on the first full day of a three-day visit here.
The West German leader said that he urged Chernenko
to consider a summit when he met with him last month and
indicated that he will bring the same message to Reagan
when he sees the president today.
"1 am passionately in favor of making good use of time
where peace is involved," Kohl said, speaking in German
through an interpreter on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press."
"For our country, it's a matter of peace and freedom. We
must not lose any time . . . We should not wait until after
the American elections."
Kohl said that a summit would require careful prepara
tion and should not be undertaken solely for "propaganda
purposes," but he argued that a meeting would be useful
even if it fails to produce any concrete results.
"Regardless of the sharp political and ideological differ
ences separating the Americans and the Germans from the
Soviet Union ... I would consider it important that we talk
to each other in a critical situation," he said.
Reagan administration officials have said that they are
interested in a summit with Chernenko but only if it could
be "a substantive meeting and one that produces real
results," in the words of a White House aide last week.
Iraqis ready for Iranian assault
Baida, Iraq — Despite a respite from intense fighting in
recent days. Iraqi forces are bracing for another Iranian as
sault through southern marshlands as part of a determined
strategy to cut a critical highway and set up a pineer attack
on Basra, Iraq's second largest city.
Maj. Gen. Hisham Sabah Fakhry, Iraq's commander of
operations east of the Tigris River, told a group of
reporters escorted to the front that Iran has not
abandoned its campaign of trying to entrap Iraq's Third
Army Corps near the southern port along the disputed
Shatt al Arab waterway.
Fakhry said Iran's human-wave attacks that have purpor
tedly cost tens of thousands of lives since the current of
fensive began Feb. 22 will probably continue once Iranian
forces are replenished along the border.
Iran has attempted at least three major thrusts into Iraq
in the latest offensive but has failed to gain substantial
ground, let alone achieve the "final, decisive victory" vowed
by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime.
The war's most recent major battle concluded here Tues
day, when Iraq retook this village and the neighboring one
ot Sakrathat that had been captured by Iran three days ear
lier in a bold night-time raid by troops arriving in the marsh
villages by parachute and motorboats. Since then, the front
has shown signs of relative calm. During a helicopter trip
from Baghdad to Basra yesterday along the central and
southern areas, traffic was seen moving normally and armed
positions parallel to the border were stationary.
Fakhry said that "not a single Iranian was left in his sec
tor" following the climactic battles that pushed the
Iranians beyond the border 12 miles away. He admitted
however that Iranian troops still held portions of Iranian
territory east of Basra including the Majnun Islands oil
field. which is said to hold up to seven billion barrels of oil
reserves.
Arabs' meeting with Arafat
illegal according to Israel
Jerusalem — A delegation of West Bank Arab leaders
who last week urged Yasser Arafat to join the Middle East
peace process committed a crime by talking to the Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman, the Israeli Cabinet ruled
yesterday.
"Israel's policy since 1968 is that residents of Judea and
Samaria (Israel's terms for the West Bank) are forbidden to
meet with the various leaders of the PLO," Cabinet
spokesman Dan Meridor said after the regular weekly
meeting.
The Cabinet issued "instructions" for dealing with the
delegation, which was headed by Bethlehem Mayor Elias
Freij and included most of the recognized Palestinian lead
ership of the Israeli-occupied territory on the West Bank
of the Jordan River. Meridor would not, however, reveal
the nature of the instructions, which could include criminal
prosecution.
The Palestinians traveled to Amman last week to urge
Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein to seek a peaceful end to
the Arab-Israeli conflict. Freij said the group believed
"there can never be a military solution to the Palestinian
problem."
The Bethlehem mayor said that Arafat and Hussein
should launch a joint peace offensive as soon as possible be
cause time was running out for any kind of solution that
would prevent Israeli annexation of the territory, which the
Israeli army captured during the Arab-Israel war in 1967.
However. Meridor renewed Israel's standing invitation to
Hussein to "join autonomy negotiations on the basis of
Camp David." Hussein considers such negotiations to be
too restricted to be useful.
