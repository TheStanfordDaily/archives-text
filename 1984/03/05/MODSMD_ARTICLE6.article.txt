From the Los Angeles Times
Damascus, Syria — All parties have agreed to
reconciliation talks that could end civil strife in
Lebanon, that country's caretaker foreign minister.
Elie Salem, declared yesterday after meeting with
Lebanese opposition leaders here.
"We talked about meeting in Geneva," he said, and
when asked about the timing, added, "Next week, we
hope."
Lebanese government opposition sources said that
President Amin Gemayel was expected to concede
formally today that his government would abrogate
the troop-withdrawal and security agreement that
Lebanon made with Israel last May I 7.
"He is expected to take the necessary steps to
abrogate the agreement — probably a government
announcement." said one source who had attended
the meetings here.

I he diplomatic revelations about a possible accord
came after talks yesterday morning between Syrian
President Hafez Assad. Druse chieftain Walid
Jumblatt and Shia Moslem leader Nabih Berri.
Also yesterday. Salem met with Syrian Foreign
Minister Abdel-Halim Khaddam and later talked with
Jumblatt and Berri.
According to Lebanese opposition leaders, the hec
tic series of conferences produced an agreement on a
set of reforms that would revamp the traditional
confessional system in Lebanon that apportions poli
tical power according to religious sects.
Although the details of a peace formula have not
yet been fully worked out. according to one Lebanese
inside source, they would also include checks on the
authority of the president.
Druse leader Jumblatt. who earlier had called for
the resignation of Gemayel before any talks could be

held, has dropped that demand. He will now insist
only that Gemayel he held constitutionally respon
sible for the Lebanese army's shelling of civilian popu
lation centers.
A cease-lire between the Christians and Moslems
across East and West Beirut was also expected to be
arranged, but. an opposition leader said: "It is not
easy to arrange — but contacts will start immedi
ately
Eventually, a new government will be formed,
based on the agreements expected to be reached in
the reconciliation talks, which presumably will be held
in Switzerland.
However, it remained unclear how the accord with
Israel will eventually be abrogated. The agreement
was approved by the Lebanese Parliament but not ac
tually ratified, and President Gemayel did not sign
the final document.
