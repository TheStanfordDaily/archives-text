From The Washington Post
Portland, Maine â€” Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart won the Maine Democratic
presidential caucuses last night, dealing
a serious and possibly fatal blow to the
prospects of Walter Mondale.
At a Democratic Party dinner in Bos
ton. Hart said he "may have brought a
political juggernaut to its knees" and
paid tribute to his Maine campaign
workers for fashioning "another politi
cal miracle."
Hart expanded his margin steadily as
the returns came in from the 412 com
munity caucuses, adding to the momen
tum he gained from his upset victory
over Mondale in last Tuesday's New
Hampshire presidential primary.

Even with the all-out backing of the
entire hierarchy of the Maine Demo
cratic Party and outside help rushed
into the state when the threat became
clear. Mondale was unable to stem the
Hart tide.
With 318 of the 412 Maine cities and
towns reporting. Hart had 6651 votes;
Mondale, 5774; uncommitted, 499;
former South Dakota Sen. George
McGovern, 157; the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
102; and Ohio Sen. John Glenn, 40.
Hart had 50.2 percent of the 13.255
votes counted and Mondale had 43.6
percent.
Ron Briggs, 23, a former George
Washington University student who

headed the Hart campaign here, called
the result "a massive defeat of Walter
Mondale. He's put everything in this
state and he had the support of
everybody who counted. He outspent
us 10 to 1. but it was our message that
got through."
Mondale rolled up ratios of 2 to I or
so in blue-collar cities such as Lewiston
and Biddeford. and in the state capital
of Augusta, where the state employees'
union bused members to the caucus
site. And" here in Portland. Mondale
edged Hart by I 50 votes out of 1349.
But Hart was running strong in the
affluent bedroom communities around
Portland and in the liberal seacoast
towns. He also carried Bangor, the

second-largest city, where lie had strong
local supporters.
After an afternoon ot personal cam
paigning at two of the largest caucuses.
Mondale left lot a Boston Democratic
dinner with his political future hanging
in the balance.
The fragility of his position, at least
in New England, was underlined by a
poll to be published in today's editions
of The Boston Globe. The survey of
611 Massachusetts voters taken from
Wednesday through Saturday showed
Hart with 4 1 percent; Mondale,
Glenn. 12; and McGovern and Jackson.
4 apiece. The Massachusetts primary
will be held March 13.
