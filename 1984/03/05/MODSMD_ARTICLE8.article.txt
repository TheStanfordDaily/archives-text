Hart shakes up race
Last week's New Hampshire pri
mary, the second major contest in
the nation for the Democrats, made
a surprisingly heavy impact on the
race tor the nomination. Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart, running on what he
calls "new ideas," pulled out a win
over the favorite, former Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale.
Ohio Sen. John Glenn, who ex
pected a strong showing in New
Hampshire, holding that Mondale's
popularity didn't extend beyond
party and union leaders to average
Democrats and independents.

finished a low third place. His cam
paign is still alive, though, and he is
predicting large victories in the up
coming Southern primaries.
Three other candidates, who have
been at the back of the pack since
the beginning of the race and who
finished extremely low in the New
Hampshire field, California Sen.

at least until the Massachusetts pri
mary, the only state he took as the
Democratic presidential nominee in
1972.
At the end of the week, however,
it was Hart and the threat of, as the
former Vice President put it, "a long
tough fight that could well go to the
convention," that troubled Mondale.
His campaign team showed its ap
prehension in paying Hart the com
pliment of releasing a prepared
statement attcking him. Mondale's
charge that Hart was too afraid to
face him in the Southern primaries
on March 13 was actually only a
diversionary action to keep atten
tion from a number of vulnerable
points. These became apparent later
in the week with Mondale's hasty
decision to pull Robert Beckel, his
national campaign manager and Mike
Ford, his national field director out
of his Washington office and send
them campaigning in Maine and Ver
mont respectively.
In these two primaries, the Maine
one yesterday and the "beauty con
test" primary in Vermont tomorrow,
only a handful of delegates to the
national convention will be chosen
but all sides recognize the much
larger impact the national headlines
will have. The question will be whe
ther the Colorado senator will be a
genuine threat in the series of
delegate-rich primaries and caucuses
on March 13, known as "Super Tues
day".

Gemayel, Assad reach agreement
Lebanese President Amin Gemayel
went to Damascus last week, was
embraced by Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad and reportedly accepted
terms for an end to the civil strife in
Lebanon. Nothing has been an
nounced yet but details and con
firmations are expected to be
forthcoming.
Gemayel is expected to abrogate
last May's withdrawal agreement
with Israel and is also expected to call
for reconciliation talks to make an
attempt at forming a more broadly
based government that would give
Lebanon's Moslems and Druse more
power. In return, Syria would impose
a cease-fire and in effect keep
Gemayel in the presidency. Walid
Jumblatt of the Druse and Nabih
Berri of the Shiites were called to
Damascus evidently for some arm
twisting on their demand for
Gemayel's resignation and trial for
war crimes.
Before making any announcements
Gemayel is being careful to sound
out not only his allies but also his
enemies on possible courses of action.
In the last week he has approached
the United States, Israel and Saudi
Arabia on the subject of a face
saving move to replace the Israeli ac
cord with another narrower accord on
security in South Lebanon.
Syria's opposition to the May 17
accord was that it would have re

quired them to leave at the same
time that the Israelis did.
The United States, with warships
and Marines remaining offshore were
conspicuously absent from the
negotiations that are likely to
negate the Israeli accord of which
they were an integral part. Secretary
of State George Shultz. at a hearing
before a Senate subcommittee, said
that constant congressional debate
over the War Powers Act and
Lebanon has so tied up the adminis
tration as to make it impossible to
conduct a "sensible" policy in that
country.
Shultz was trying "to find a
scapegoat for a failed policy."
retorted Robert Bvrd. Senate Dem
ocratic leader.
Meanwhile, France, the only mem
ber of the multinational force left in
Beirut . indicated it would not stay
for much longer, particularly after
the Soviet Union vetoed a French
sponsored move in the United Na
tions Security Council to send in a
U.N. force.

Gulf war flares
The Iran-Iraq war flared up last
week and threatened to spread. Iraq
announced that it was attacking
ships approaching Iran's main oil port
of Kharg Island. This move was in
response to Iranian attacks that
were hitting deeply into Iraqi terri

tory. Following Iraq's announcement,
oil prices rose briefly on the world
spot market, and Japanese tankers
were redirected away from the area.
During the first part of the week a
U.S. destroyer in the Strait of Hor
muz fired warning shots at an Iranian
patrol plane and warned off an
Iranian frigate that had come within
five miles of the ship. The 20 Ameri
can warships in the Persian Gulf and
the Arabian Sea were put on alert
against possible suicide attacks.
The latest Iraqi report, like many
in the 41-month-old war. may have
been a bluff. American reconnais
sance has turned up "no smoke, no
burning docks, no sinking ships," a
Pentagon official said But when
Teheran repeated its threats to close
the strait if attacked there, thereby
cutting off IK percent of world oil
needs. Washington expressed
"serious concern."
Officials cited President Reagan's
warning last month, "There's no way
thnt we could allow that channel to
be closed." Western intelligence
sources doubted that Iran could or
would carry out its threat. Iran's
Ayatollah Khomeini advised that
Iran won't stop fighting until Presi
dent Saddam Hussein of Iraq is over
thrown. He added. "And neither
America nor any other power can
keep him in office."
