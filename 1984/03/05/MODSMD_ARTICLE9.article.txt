## The 						Stanford Daily Cranston bid worthwhile 
### 
Although California Sen. Alan Cranston is
no longer in the Democratic race for the
presidential nomination, his presence in the first
two campaign battles will leave its mark
on the entire nomination process.
Perhaps the greatest accomplishment the
Stanford graduate made, as he himself said, w as
to have "forced the issues of the arms race and
nuclear war to the very forefront of the
presidential campaign." We respect Cranston
for not compromising his integrity or selling out
his views for votes. He clearly stuck to his views
despite a fourth-place finish in the lowa pri
mary and one poll's prediction that he would
earn only 4 percent of the votes in New
Hampshire.
Cranston went down in the primaries fight
ing. but he bowed from the campaign gracefully.
When he withdrew last week after a poor
showing in New Hampshire, Cranston refrained
from endorsing one of the remaining candidates

or taking potshots at the front-runners. In
stead, he stressed that it was a wide-open race,
seemingly trying to tell the public to vote its
conscience and not jump on the bandwagon of
Walter Mondale or Gary Hart.
Cranston also acknowledged a victory of
sorts, maybe not as big as winning his party's
nomination for the office of president, but cer
tainly an important one in choosing who that
candidate will be. Cranston said he was pleased
that "all the candidates are now committed to
increasingly stronger positions," something for
which he is partially responsible.
Cranston has vowed to continue his fight to
stop the arms race and has already annnounced
that he will run for re-election to the Senate in
1986. He may have failed in his bid for the
country's highest office, yet he did not fail to
keep his values intact and fight for his ideals.
