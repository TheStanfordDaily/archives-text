# Streleski to be freed in Orange County Thursday

Convicted killer Theodore Streleski will he released on
parole Thursday to Orange County, the California De
partment of Corrections announced yesterday morning.
Streleski, 47, has served the minimum two-thirds —
approximately five-and-one-half years — of an eight
year sentence he received for the Aug. 18, 1978 murder
of Stanford Mathematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw.
Corrections Department officials decided to parole
Streleski instead of placing him in a mental hospital
after they reviewed the results of the psychiatric evalu
ation Streleski underwent last month. The testing, ad
ministered by a team of psychiatrists at the Vacaville
State Medical Facility, was ordered by the department
when Streleski alarmed the public by claiming in January
interviews that he was "absolutely noncommittal" on
whether he would murder again.
The Vacaville team lound "no clinical basis" to com
mit Streleski to a mental hospital, according to depart
ment spokesman Phil Guthrie.
In addition, the corrections officials rewarded
Streleski for being a "model prisoner" by moving his
March 23 parole date up two weeks.
But, pressured by San Francisco Mayor Dianne
Feinstein and by Stanford as well, the Corrections De
partment did make one major concession, choosing not
to parole Streleski to San Francisco.
The department designed Streleski's parole stipula
tions to ensure he does not return to campus, Guthrie
said.
He will not be permitted to go to the San Francisco

Bay Area, including Santa Clara, San Francisco, San
Mateo, and Alameda. He will also receive obligatory
weekly psychiatric treatment at an outpatient clinic.
But Guthrie said security measures preventing
Streleski from venturing north will be limited. "He has
most of the rights to move around ... as you or I do,"
Guthrie said.
Feinstein was informed last week that Streleski would
not be released in San Francisco.
"1 do not believe San Francisco is the place for this
dangerous and remorseless parolee," Feinstein had writ
ten in a letter to Corrections Department officials.
They acquiesced, "because of the notoriety of the case
and the concerns expressed by Stanford," Guthrie said.
It is unclear exactly how the University expressed
those concerns.
University President Donald Kennedy revealed last
Monday that he had met with the state attorney gen
eral and with "people in the Governor's Office" and had
had "a number of conversations with people in the State
Correctional Authority."
Kennedy also said Monday it is "entirely possible"
that Stanford sought outside legal counsel.
University Legal Office spokesmen refuse to discuss
what legal measures they took to ensure that Streleski
be paroled outside of San Francisco. "We've talked with
lots of people, said John Schwartz, vice president and
general counsel.
It is also unknown whether the University will take ac
