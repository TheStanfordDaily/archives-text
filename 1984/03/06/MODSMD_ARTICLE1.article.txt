# Streleski to be freed in Orange County Thursday
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Convicted killer Theodore Streleski will he released on
parole Thursday to Orange County, the California De
partment of Corrections announced yesterday morning.
Streleski, 47, has served the minimum two-thirds —
approximately five-and-one-half years — of an eight
year sentence he received for the Aug. 18, 1978 murder
of Stanford Mathematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw.
Corrections Department officials decided to parole
Streleski instead of placing him in a mental hospital
after they reviewed the results of the psychiatric evalu
ation Streleski underwent last month. The testing, ad
ministered by a team of psychiatrists at the Vacaville
State Medical Facility, was ordered by the department
when Streleski alarmed the public by claiming in January
interviews that he was "absolutely noncommittal" on
whether he would murder again.
The Vacaville team lound "no clinical basis" to com
mit Streleski to a mental hospital, according to depart
ment spokesman Phil Guthrie.
In addition, the corrections officials rewarded
Streleski for being a "model prisoner" by moving his
March 23 parole date up two weeks.
But, pressured by San Francisco Mayor Dianne
Feinstein and by Stanford as well, the Corrections De
partment did make one major concession, choosing not
to parole Streleski to San Francisco.
The department designed Streleski's parole stipula
tions to ensure he does not return to campus, Guthrie
said.
He will not be permitted to go to the San Francisco

Bay Area, including Santa Clara, San Francisco, San
Mateo, and Alameda. He will also receive obligatory
weekly psychiatric treatment at an outpatient clinic.
But Guthrie said security measures preventing
Streleski from venturing north will be limited. "He has
most of the rights to move around ... as you or I do,"
Guthrie said.
Feinstein was informed last week that Streleski would
not be released in San Francisco.
"1 do not believe San Francisco is the place for this
dangerous and remorseless parolee," Feinstein had writ
ten in a letter to Corrections Department officials.
They acquiesced, "because of the notoriety of the case
and the concerns expressed by Stanford," Guthrie said.
It is unclear exactly how the University expressed
those concerns.
University President Donald Kennedy revealed last
Monday that he had met with the state attorney gen
eral and with "people in the Governor's Office" and had
had "a number of conversations with people in the State
Correctional Authority."
Kennedy also said Monday it is "entirely possible"
that Stanford sought outside legal counsel.
University Legal Office spokesmen refuse to discuss
what legal measures they took to ensure that Streleski
be paroled outside of San Francisco. "We've talked with
lots of people, said John Schwartz, vice president and
general counsel.
It is also unknown whether the University will take ac

tion to revoke Streleski's parole. Although he will be
paroled to Orange County, some faculty members
doubtless feel he still poses a threat to the Stanford
community.
University Police plan no special security measures fol
lowing Streleski's release, according to Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. Niemeyer said the police are pleased
that Streleski is going to Orange County.
Harriett Wieder, chairman of the Orange County
Board of Supervisors, is not pleased.
She lashed out against the Corrections Department
yesterday, calling for a necessary improvement in com
munication between the state department and local
jurisdictions and better advance notice on parole
procedures. "What makes us so suspicious is the lack of
knowledge and the lack of information we have in these
cases," she said.
Three officials at the Orange County Sheriffs Office
had not heard of Streleski when The Daily contacted
them for comment yesterday.
Streleski had tried for 19 years to get a doctorate in

mathematics here before killing deLeeuw to demon
strate his grievances against Stanford. He had lined up
more than one possible victim from the Math Depart
ment faculty.
On Aug. IS, 1975, Streleski walked into deLeeuw's of
fice, pulled a two-pound hammer out of a red flight bag
and bludgeoned the professor to death. He then placed a
plastic bag over deLeeuw's head, taped a notecard to the
office door reading, "No appointments today — family
emergency," and exited quietly.
According to Niemeyer, the University officer who
worked on the case, Streleski turned himself in to Stan
ford Police later that evening.
"I believe he said. I think you may have been looking
for me," " Niemeyer said.
Streleski. who maintained a "diminished-capacity"
defense in the trial, was convicted of second-degree
murder and received an eight-year sentence, the maxi
mum allowed for that conviction at the time.
But three months after the murder, voters passed the
Briggs initiative, which increased the maximum penalties
for first- and second-degree murder in California.
One year after the deLeeuw murder, Streleski told
the San Jose Mercury News he felt no remorse over the
killing and "under the same circumstances, I'd do it
again."

tion to revoke Streleski's parole. Although he will be
paroled to Orange County, some faculty members
doubtless feel he still poses a threat to the Stanford
community.
University Police plan no special security measures fol
lowing Streleski's release, according to Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. Niemeyer said the police are pleased
that Streleski is going to Orange County.
Harriett Wieder, chairman of the Orange County
Board of Supervisors, is not pleased.
She lashed out against the Corrections Department
yesterday, calling for a necessary improvement in com
munication between the state department and local
jurisdictions and better advance notice on parole
procedures. "What makes us so suspicious is the lack of
knowledge and the lack of information we have in these
cases," she said.
Three officials at the Orange County Sheriffs Office
had not heard of Streleski when The Daily contacted
them for comment yesterday.
Streleski had tried for 19 years to get a doctorate in

mathematics here before killing deLeeuw to demon
strate his grievances against Stanford. He had lined up
more than one possible victim from the Math Depart
ment faculty.
On Aug. IS, 1975, Streleski walked into deLeeuw's of
fice, pulled a two-pound hammer out of a red flight bag
and bludgeoned the professor to death. He then placed a
plastic bag over deLeeuw's head, taped a notecard to the
office door reading, "No appointments today — family
emergency," and exited quietly.
According to Niemeyer, the University officer who
worked on the case, Streleski turned himself in to Stan
ford Police later that evening.
"I believe he said. I think you may have been looking
for me," " Niemeyer said.
Streleski. who maintained a "diminished-capacity"
defense in the trial, was convicted of second-degree
murder and received an eight-year sentence, the maxi
mum allowed for that conviction at the time.
But three months after the murder, voters passed the
Briggs initiative, which increased the maximum penalties
for first- and second-degree murder in California.
One year after the deLeeuw murder, Streleski told
the San Jose Mercury News he felt no remorse over the
killing and "under the same circumstances, I'd do it
again."
