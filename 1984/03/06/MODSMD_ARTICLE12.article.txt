President Reagan is willing to take the
"responsibility" for the massacre of more than
241 Marines in Lebanon, but his secretary of
state is trying to pass the buck to Congress for
the recent pullout of U.S. forces from that
country.
That was the message George Shultz sent last
week as he told the Senate Appropriations sub
committee on foreign operations that Congress'
debate on the propriety of U.S. moves in the
Mideast make it impossible for the administra
tion to conduct "sensible" policy in Lebanon.
Said Shultz: "Our own debate here totally took
the rug out from under our diplomatic effort."
Shultz called on Congress to review the War
Powers Act, a law enacted in reaction to U.S. in
volvement in Vietnam that requires the pres
ident to notify Congress within 48 hours after
he sends troops into certain combat situations,
and prohibits him from keeping the troops there
for more than 90 days unless Congress declares
war or adopts a joint resolution approving the
action.
It is natural for the secretary of state to at
tack congressional critics of the president's

foreign policy, but Shultz's comments are di
rected at more than the critics' criticism. Shultz
is saying here that congressional debate on
American policy undermined U.S. efforts, which
amounts to a war on Congress' right to debate,
not a fight over what Congress debates.
The War Powers Act was adopted in large
part because the United States spent too many
lives and too much time in Vietnam, where
Congress never even declared war. The act pro
vides Congress with a much-needed check on
presidential license, a check that Congress did
not invoke in Lebanon.
Congress voted in October to impose an 18-
month limit on military action in Lebanon,
turning aside attempts to impose a stricter
limitation on action there.
We agree with Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy
who told Shultz that Congress had been
"gutless" for not inhibiting the Reagan ad
mi nstration more than it did. If Congress had
limited the president's use of military power,
perhaps the United States would have been out
of Lebanon much earlier and perhaps a few lives
would have been saved.
