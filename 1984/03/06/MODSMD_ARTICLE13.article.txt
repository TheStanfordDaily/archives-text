# Watch out, McDonald's

### 
The funniest thing we've heard this year ap
peared in Friday's story on the high cost of Food
Service. A University administrator said
McDonald's can charge lower prices than Uni
versity Food Service because, in part, "the
quality of food is lower at McDonald's."
That's not true. And anybody who has eaten
at both the Golden Arches and and Stern Hall
can tell you that.
Yet Stanford students who live in Stanford
dormitories are forced to pay for Stanford Food
Service. So what can be done to make Food Ser
vice a better deal for students?
The University has taken a commendable first
step by experimenting at Sterling Quad with a
pay-as-you-eat plan which keeps light eaters
from subsidizing heavy eaters. The plan has its
problems, but it is a step in the right direction.
But the real direction the University should
take is to make eating plans more flexible for
individual students. Without special waivers for
class and job conflicts, students living in dorms
are required to pay for at least a 14-meal-per
week plan, whether they intend to eat those
meals or not.
A more equitable system would be to allow
students to choose their o.wn mgal plans from a
greatez number 'of ' — breakfasts.

lunches or dinners only, or even no meals what
soever.
Traditionally, University administrators have
had a number of arguments against such
flexibility.
First, there have been claims that without
meal plans students wouldn't eat well-balanced
diets. But many students with Food Service
plans already have poor diets — nothing stops
anyone from surviving on Food Service ice cream
and Domino's pizzas when the main Food Service
entrees are too tough to stomach.
Second, they say that eating together pro
vides that all-important residential education.
But residential education needn't be forced
down student's throats along with the Chile
Cheese Puffs at mealtimes. Residential educa
tion is always available to students; they can
seek it out during the 21 hours a day they don't
spend in the dining halls.
Finally, and most ridiculously, administrators
have made the excuse that, without required
plans, Food Service would be hurt because stu
dents might forsake California Casserole for
Big Macs and leave the dining halls empty. That
should tell Food Service something about the
problem here.
Watth out, McDonald's.
