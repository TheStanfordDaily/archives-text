## A 						flight from repression 
### 
Poor Willi Stoph. Boy, must he be
embarrassed! One would expect that
as prime minister of the East Ger
man socialist workers' paradise he is a
good salesman for the regime.
But obviously uncle Willi isn't too
convincing about it because last
weekend his niece. Ingrid Berg, her
husband, their two children and Mrs.
Berg's mother holed up in the West

VIEWPOINT

German embassy in Prague, seeking
political asylum in the imperialist,
revanchist, warmongering West.
It is important to note that Berg
and her family are seeking political
asylum. Their exodus is not
motivated by material concerns but
by spiritual ones. Being relatives of
the party elite, they were among
those "animals who are more equal
than the others," to paraphrase Or
well.
No doubt, they enjoyed the best
consumer goods available and other
privileges like acccss to better vaca
tion spots and apartments.
All this goes to show that there is
more to life than a full belly and high
literacv rates, the latter of which are

so frequently touted as an indicator
ot the beneficence of the world's
"progressive" regimes. (The economic
dislocation endemic to the Soviet
allied socialist wonderlands has long
since exposed the myth of
proletarian prosperity. Anyone with
half a clue knows the absurdity of
bragging about milk and honey in
these lands of shattered promises.)
Sure, the people of Cuba and
Nicaragua have been taught to read
by the revolutionaries, but how
liberating is literacy when what one
reads is regulated by the state? Edu
cation frees the mind; socialist re
-education imprisons it.
Berg and her family are not
refugees from some unavoidable nat
ural disaster, but from an avoidable
unnatural one: the repression of
human freedom by the totalitarian
network which emanates from Mos
cow. We can avoid this creeping
tyranny only by facing up to it, but
this is extremely difficult for
Americans raised in their isolated en
vironment of liberty and bounty.
. The, absence ol opposition political
parties or newspapers, the systematic
control of culture, the suppression of
religion, neighborhood watch groups

— in short, the attempt to rule the
mind as well as body — this is the sys
tem from which Berg and her family
tied, leaving their homeland and ris
king everything for the promise of
the West.
Of course, / know that this is cold
warrior stuff, and that America has
consistently been on the wrong side
of history (supporting repressive
regimes etc.), and that the only
people who don't understand that
the Soviets really are just like us are
the old fogies like Ronald Reagan.
But what I can't figure out, then,
is why Berg and millions of others
who have experienced the dictator
ship of the proletariat have chosen
to express their gratitude to the
workers' state by leaving it — voting
with their feet, if you will. Com
placent in the comfort of my over
stuffed armchair, I can't figure out
people like the boatpeople of Viet
nam and Cuba, the Miskito Indians,
the Afghan freedom fighters, the
Solzhenitsyns and Bukovskys. What
do they know that I don't?
.Ask Willi Stoph. I'll bet he has »
pretty good idea.
