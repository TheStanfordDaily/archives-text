# ClA's visit to Stanford conjures up images of Agent 007
## 
### 
Last week Stanford students had a unique
opportunity. To witness the first emergency
heart transplant performed by a paramedic?
To buy the latest model anti-satellite
weapon at a special "student rate"?
No, something even more unique. We were
invited to attend the Central Intelligence
Agency Career Days.
The CIA took out three full-page ads in
this newspaper to inform us that we were
invited. The cost of these ads was almost
$3000, courtesy of the taxpayers. If that
doesn't outrage you, think of this: That
money went to help print this column.
Career Days turned out to be last Wed
nesday and Thursday. On Wednesday, they
had two "major briefings" — that's spy lingo
for "information meeting." I went to one of
those briefings — it was an elaborate disin
formation ploy to make us believe that

everyone in the CIA is boring and middle
aged. 1 wasn't fooled.
On Thursday, they held individual inter
views, looking, they said, for those who want
the "satisfaction that comes from doing
work of vital importance to our nation."
They need someone to take "The A Team"
off the air?
No, they wanted people with skills and
knowledge in such areas as engineering, law,
economics, and (this is for real) overseas in
telligence. I didn't even know Stanford of
fered an overseas intelligence major.
The reaction to this in my dorm ranged all
the way from"I don't care" to "I don't read
The Daily." The closest thing I heard to a
moral objection to the CIA was when some
one pointed out that their starting salaries
weren't as high as those of federal drug en
forcement agents.

I personally have opposed the CIA ever
since Roger Moore became James Bond. The
dark sunglasses — the three-piece suits —
the way Secret Service agents can incon
spicuously carry submachine guns — it all
makes me nervous.
The CIA is not just another company.
Some of the stuff they do is really out
rageous. Take, for example, the time they
tried to make Fidel Castro's beard fall out so
as to embarass him. What if the Cubans
tried to do that to us? Our President embar
rasses himself enough as it is. A little red dye
No. 2 in his Grecian formula could destroy
him.
The CIA has a long lecord of coups, assas
sinations and support for right-wing dic
tatorships. I suppose eventually it'll all turn
out to be a misunderstanding — "Make the
world safe for democracy? I thought you said

fromV — but until then, there's no telling
what they'll do. Rumor has it that they were
planning on overthrowing Jerry Brown, until
it was pointed out that California was part
of the United States. The CIA apologized
and gave the job back to the FBI.
Some people admit that the CIA does bad
things, but think that they won't be in
volved in them because they are techies and
techies are never morally responsible for
anything. Wrong. Who do you think made
Oddjob's deadly hats? Or all those combina
tion swizzle stick/poison dart blow guns?
Besides, do you want to be a mad scientist?
People who invent things for secret organi
zations are always mad scientists.
Or George Bush. George Bush was in the
CIA. You may be forced to be vice president
when you leave the CIA. too.
Which is not to say that there aren't some
things to be said for working for the CIA.

The pay is good, the benefits are generous,
and if you don't like the country they sta
tion you in, you can always overthrow its
government. By telling people that your job
is classified, you can make it sound exciting,
even if all you actually do is translate the Al
bania Times-Tribune. You can assassinate
people that bug you.
But the real question is: If you're going to
start interviewing with the CIA, where do
you draw the line? How about a job with the
Soviet Air Command ("must be able to iden
tify plane types")? Or the Iranian Armed
Forces — "It's not just a job — it's a jihad"?
Or let's put it this way: If you don't
mind belonging to an amoral, subversive or
ganization with no respect for the law,
why aren't you in the Band?
