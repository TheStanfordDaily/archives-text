# ROSENSCHEIN AND ROSENSCHEIN
## An expression of democratic activism 
### 
Jeff Benz's column (Daily, Feb. 15) was a
relatively reasoned and dispassionate look at the
Middle East situation: however, this was because
The Daily editors had removed some of his com
ments from the original article.
For our benefit, Benz reinserted these com
ments into his next piece (Daily, Feb. 29). In it.

VIEWPOINT

he mentions the Sabra and Shatila massacres in
Lebanon, committed by Christian Phalangist
militiamen while Israel surrounded the refugee
camps. "Nothing was done about it,"he writes.
Everybody "comfortably forgot about the whole
affair."
Nothing was done about it?
Has Benz forgotten about the protest in Tel
Aviv that drew 400,000 people (10 percent of Is
rael's total population?). Has he forgotten the
outrage of the Israeli people, and how it forced
its government to appoint a Commission of In
quiry into Israel's involvement in the affair? Has
he forgotten the months of painstaking investi
gation that this commission undertook, the res
ignation of Israel's defense minister, the public
shaming an 1 punishment of generals, the censure
of some Cabinet ministers (including the prime
ministe. for inaction?
Quite a lot was done about Sabra and Shatila,
quite a lot more than would have been done by
virtually any other country in the world.
Consider, for example, the difference between
Israel's response and that of the United States
to the My Lai massacre. Though the My Lai mas
sacre was perpetrated directly by American
troops, the American government (and people)

contented themselves with convicting a single,
low-level, military man. Even this weak response
only came years after the event.
Perhaps Americans forgot about the affair at
Sabra and Shatila the way they forgot about My
Lai and many other atrocities, but the Israelis did
not. For that they deserve praise and recogni
tion, even as the original actions deserved con
demnation.
But there is more. Benz is clear about what he
thought should have been done by the United
States, in light of its moral revulsion over the
massacre: Cut off arms to Israel.

Cutting off arms supplies
to a democratic country
that is besieged by
enemies is not an inher
ently moral act.

But cutting off arms supplies to a democratic
country that is besieged by enemies is not an in
herently moral act. When one considers the con
sequences, when one considers what will happen
to that country and to its population if its
enemies have their way, one may decide that cut
ting off arms supplies is itself an immoral act.
Regardless of the stain of the massacres, Israel
tried to atone; certainly its amends were imper
fect (no one can bring the dead back to life), and

there are those who wanted it to do even more.
Benz, however, refuses to acknowledge that it
did anything; he then casually suggests that the
United States should willfully endanger the exis
tence of Israel and of its population by cutting
off arms shipments.
This punishment would be out of proportion
to the crime, and directed at the wrong people.
It would satisfy some American's desire for
retribution, but would not add one iota to
America's moral worth.
Benz complains in his column that people hear
bad things in the world, but don't "care enough
to act." Yet 400.000 Israelis took to the streets
to protest Sabra and Shatila, and to demand ac
tion by their government. This is a perfect exam
ple of the sort of democratic activism of which
Benz approves; he might have even cited it as a
model of the kind of moral concern that he finds
lacking in America.
Then, however, he might have had to justify
his desire to punish and endanger these same Is
raelis by cutting off American military aid.
Benz quotes The New York Times to present
facts about Sabra and Shatila. He could just as
easily have quoted the Israeli Commission of In
quiry to present those same facts, but then he
would have had to mention that Israel hud such
an investigation, that something was, in fact,
done.
Benz apparently does not want to give Israel or
Israelis any credit. Yet there is much that
Americans could learn from the way Israelis
responded to Sabra and Shatila.
