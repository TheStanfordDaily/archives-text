## BYU star becomes richest athlete ever Young gets $40 million by Express 
### 
lls Angeles (AP) — The Los Angeles Ex
press of the United States Football
League scored a major coup yesterday, lan
ding Brigham Young quarterback Steve
Young with a staggering $40 million con
tract that is the richest pact ever for an
athlete.
Young, one of the most profilic passers
in college history, will benefit from the
contract that runs for 43 years until he is
65.
A left-hander who set or tied 13 NCAA
passing and total offense records while at
BYU, Young had been courted by the Na
tional Football League's Cincinnati Ben
gals, who told him they would make him
the first pick in the May I NFL draft. The
Bengals' offer was a reported $3.5 million
over five years, including a $1 million sig
ning bonus.
The 6-foot-2, 196-pound Young said
earlier he'd rather play in the NFL, but
decided over the weekend to sign with the
Express.
"It was a very tough decision, and it
came after much deliberation on my part,"
Young said.
A great-great-great grandson of Mor
mon pioneer leader Brigham Young, Steve
is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ

of Latter-day Saints, and attributed part
of his decision to sign with Los Angeles to
his desire to aid BYU.
"I saw this as a situation where I could
give back some of the things BYU had
given me in the last tour years," he said.
Young's contract, a source told The As
sociated Press, will be worth $1 million a
year for the first four years and includes a
$2 million signing bonus. The life of the
contract runs through the year 2027.
The complex agreement includes a
$ 100,()()()-a-year endorsement policy with
a savings and loan company in Salt Lake
City; a scholarship policy with BYU worth
$183,000; and deferred payments totaling
more than $30 million.
Young's agent, Leigh Steinberg, asked if
the contract was in fact the richest ever
for an athlete, replied: "It's hard to
characterize contracts, but I've not seen
one comparable to it."
He also said Young had an "absolutely
magnificent offer sitting here," while Cin
cinnati's "would be an abstraction . . .
There's no doubt he was going to be the
No. 1 pick in the NFL draft . . . Still, the
NFL seems to sit there as player after
player signs."
He said the money was not Young's pri-

Mary reason for going with the Express:
"Throughout the process (of negotia
tions), Steve never asked me in more than
a marginal sense what the dollar figures
were." He said that besides the money for
the BYU scholarship, the Express will
match donations by Young to Los Angeles
charities.
While saying the money was not his
prime consideration. Young grinned and
added, "1 hope to fix up my car and take
my girlfriend out to dinner for the first
time in four years
Young, an Ail-American and runnerup in
the 1983 He 1, an balloting to another
player who c' v the USFL, Mike Rozier
of the Pittsbuii i Maulers, led nation in
total offense last season with 4346 yards
and set an all-time NCAA record in that
department of 395.1 yards per game. He
completed 306 of 429 passes at BYU last
season for 71.3 percent, another NCAA
record.
In Young's two seasons as starting quar
terback, BYU was 8-4 and 11-1. His
greatest day as a collegian came against
San Diego State last fall when he had 497
total yards, connecting on 32 of 45 passes
for 446 yards and three touchdowns.
