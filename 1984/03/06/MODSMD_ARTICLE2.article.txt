# Band budget in question
## 
### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
A measure will be introduced in
the ASSU Senate today to rescind
the recently approved budget for the
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band for the coming year.
ASSU senator Roland Van Gaalen
has sponsored the recall motion. He
said that the Band was in "gross
violation" of the budget originally
approved for 1983-84 and therefore
should not have its 1984-85 budget
approved. He added that the four
Band members who are also ASSU
senators and voted on the budget
should not have been allowed to do
so.
The budget for a student organiza
tion determines the amount of fees
the group is allotted if students ap

elections in the spring.
The proposed budget was approved
by the senate last week, although the
Senate Appropriations Committee
had not recommended its approval.
Appropriations Committee co
chairman Pardner Wynn said,
"There's no question but that
there's a number of discrepancies
(between last year's budget and this
year's)."
Gary Cates, another member of
(he Appropriations Committee
called the Band budget "a slush
fund."
Ben Langiotz, manager of the
Band, said that Van Gaalen has had
an adversarial attitude toward the
Band for some time.
In regard to Van Gaalen, Langiotz
said, "I'm not sure what his problem
is with the Band ... It goes beyond
the finances." Van Gaalen had been
critical of the Band's performances
as well of its budgets, according to
Langiotz.
The Band has one of the largest
budgets given to a student group.
The Band's current budget is approx
imately $75,000.
In last year's original budget,
$6600 was allocated for cleaning
Band members' uniforms. Only $3N4
was projected by graduate senator
Eric Berg as the necessary amount
for that purpose, and Van Gaalen
