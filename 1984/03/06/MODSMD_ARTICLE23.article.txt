## ABT: more than just 'an evening without Misha' 
### TERRY HAYNIE 
As both its artistic director
and one of its principal dancers,
Mikhail Barishnikov may be
considered the chief attraction
of the American Ballet
Theater. Unfortunately, for
those less familiar with the
ballet, he often seems to be
the onlv attraction to a com
pany brimming over with
American talent in the otting.
l ast Tuesday night's perfor
mance. an evening without
Misha, proved there are indeed
other features to ABI besides
the Leningrad emigre.
The program began with the
American ballet, "Billy the
Kid," choreographed by Eugene
Loring for the Ballet Caravan
in 1940. The ballet, through a
series of framed sequences of
events in the desperado's life,
recounts the escapades of
"Billy the Kid." within the
context of the pioneer move
ment west. "Billy the Kid"
stands as the first, significant
American choreographed ballet
of a strictly American theme,
and it's a favorite showcase in
the repertory of most ballet
companies, including ABT.
The strength of "Billy the
Kid" rests in establishing its
tone securely at the ballet's
beginning while matching the
understated intensity of the

Aaron Copland score. Al
though the soloists in 'Billy
the Kid" do have some control
in creating the mood of this
expressionist ballet, the real
power and verve must come
from the corps.
Though the corps did create
some memorable impressions,
the eager bronco rider in red,
for example, or the saucy
broad-hipped saloon dancers, it
generally lacked precision, such
as in the very soft-tap in the
celebration scene of Billy's
capture, or in the dancers' full
extensions in the westward ex
pansion movements. It seemed
Copland's score nearly over
shadowed the dance movement
on stage.
Throughout the ballet the
Copland score challenges the
dancers to match its brilliance,
its full range of lyricism.
Though the corps was less than
successful, the soloist Fer
nando Bujones created force
ful. evocative dance movement
with a decidedly masculine
grace. He danced as a bright
spot for the entire ballet, one
which however, could not sup
port itself only by the talent
of its soloists. Cynthia Harvey
danced competently, but dis
tantly as the sweet
heart/mother and David
Cuevas served his purpose well

as Billy's nemesis. Alias.
The next ballet, however,
rests entirely on the strength
of its soloists. The Little Bal
let, Twyla Thorp's new piece
for ABT is a vibrant dance per
formed with abandon and ten
sion concurrently. Robert La
Fosse, as its male lead, dances
magnificently, suggesting both
anticipation and frustration
over the appearance or disap
pearance of Cynthia Harvey,
his female lead.
Tharp plays on romantic ex
pectations with effective
partnering techniques, and La
Fosse and Harvey dance
through them sensually, yet
tenuously. The other three
principal dances, Amanda
McKerrow, Nancy Raffa and
Lisa Lockwood were all
suitably flightly and
provocative, tempting distrac
tion for Robert La Fosse, who
drew the appreciation of the
crowd for a good, intelligent
performance.
Another crowd pleaser was
the "Sylvia-Pas de Deux," a
holdover, show-stopper, duet
from the 19th century.
Martine Van Hamel and
Patrick Bissell, costumed in
sumptuous peacock blue and
baubles, and in Van Hamel's
case, tiny blue feathers in her
tutu, performed a duet which

required much audacity and a
terrific sense of balance. They
were visually wonderful, both

self-assured and accurate. Van
Hamel had an inviting smile,
and enough sophistication and

technical merit to win the au
dience easily.
Bissel. a tall (very unusual
for male ballet dancers) and
literally statuesque dancer also
displayed confident technical
merit, though his balance
seemed awry at times. It was
no matter though; they both
commanded stage presence,
from Van Hamel's seemingly
effortless toe hops to Bissel's
bounds and spins. Sylvia was an
entertaining piece, where two
well-versed dancers paraded
their wares.
The final ballet of the eve
ning was Les Noces,
choreographed by Jerome Rob
bins in 1965. Set to the music
of Igor Stravinsky, the ballet
retells the rites of passage of a
Russian peasant marriage.
With two huge icon-like paint
ings on the backdrops, and an
excellent light design, a stark,
ritualistic mood of the ballet
was foretold.
Here, as in "Billy the Kid,"
the force of the ballet must
come from the corps. In this in
stance, the corps did indeed set
the pace, and dictated the fer
vor and ebullience of the wed
ding ceremony. They were more
successful this second time
around, fortunately; they were
more meticulous with move
ment. and more attuned to the

gist of a peasant wedding
ritual, steeped in superstition
and chaos. Yet. they were still
not outwardly confident
enough, and they lacked again
the crucial element lor dance
theater, energy.
The soloists, however, were
truly impressive, especially
Elaine Kudo as the bride. She
moved with an urgency and
dynamism appropriate to the
role. The groom, danced by
John Gardner, was less alluring
than Kudo, but a "marriage
consummation' movement,
with he and Kudo engaged in a
pas ile deux of typical Robbins
like candor, silenced the house.
Les Noces is an intriguing bal
let that catches the breath.
In all. an evening without
Barishnikov still merited the
trip to the Opera House. The
corps du bullet suffered from
slight technical flaws, and
they, as young dancers, seemed
short on vitality. Nevertheless,
they demonstrated genuine
talent, and as a company, no
one denies their superiority.
The principal dancers, however,
especially the exciting I.a
Fosse and the winsome Van
Hamel, were paradigms of the
best in American ballet today.
They knew exactly what was
required to bring their perfor
mance in line with good art.
