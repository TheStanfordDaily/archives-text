Music appreciation is often based on your
mood while listening. If you happen to run
into another bike near the Quad and get
some nasty scrapes and a headache, "Beat
It" is what you want to say, not hear. If you
are cheerful and energetic. Murphy's
Lawyers' debut album can be cause tor
celebration. This first effort by the
Stanford-founded band culminates an un
wavering struggle to produce music without

sacrificing the band's integrity or "root"
style.
In the early 1980s, the band followed a
college sound built around a few bluesy
tunes, a couple of rockers and covers of cov
er versions of popular songs. An early person
nel change and a steady audience (a.k.a. frat)
drew together a core of musicians that
produced the album's artists. Gone now,
however are tunes that sounded like Little
Feat and Rare Earth after a fistfight. What
remains is a raw '80s synthetic harmony. The
process was slow, but following campus par
ties and lots of smaller gigs, the band played
some major clubs and dates before seques
tering themselves to record the disc.
Murphy's Lawyers' Pass The Bar is a strong
showing containing a couple of minor, but

obvious, shortcomings. The vinyl was
produced by the group themselves with the
assistance of some very smart people and the
support of everyone that had been involved
with the band. The Music Annex and Fan
tasy Studios did the work and provided the
setting. The album was cut on Criminal
Records, Murphy's own label. The product is
very crisp for a minor pressing. The sound
reproduction is excellent. The music is writ
ten by David Cremin, the lead guitar player
and quasi-business manager of the group.
David Schnieder (bass player) is responsible
for one song, "Sythesized Time," which pro
vides one of the few tempo changes on the
album. This record spins fast and has a lively
kick. Doug Hansen handles lead vocals, and
the band mixes in a lot of harmonies. Hansen

has improved his singing abilities by orders of
magnitude from the days of yore. Malcolm
Bertoni is the drummer. Barry Greenhut sits
in on keyboards for the album but has since
been replaced by Steve Flash, a musician the
band picked up to enhance its sound with
some sophisticated equipment.
Overall, the songs are similar to Fischer Z,
Flash and the Pan, and Utopia all mixed to
gether. Lots of harmonies combine with an
electric top-end to creat a non-commercial
sound. No candy-coated pop here although
"Crushed Crush" attempts a degree of cute
ness. The hottest cut is "Second Coming"
which should have been named "Down For
The Count." This one builds to a strong tune
and has a maturity from start to finish.
"R.E.M." is an example of the group's

generic style. A couple of big words in verses
that say a lot for a four-minute song. We're
talking esoteric music. "Stimulator" has a
lot of potential but needs further develop
ment. "Self Torture" is great and with
"Second Coming" should show up on the
play lists of a few radio stations. The band
performs its music with lots of intensity and
mixes in lots of filler sound so that each song
has depth. A good stereo is nice to really
capture the true tune. Or you can see them
live this Thursday at the Keystone at 9 p.m..
It is billed as Murphy's Lawyers' Welcome
Back party as the band hasn't played a Jive
show in months. The Shakes and Tao Chemi
cal will open the show. My suggestion is to go
be the jury. My verdict is in and I say they're
insane.
