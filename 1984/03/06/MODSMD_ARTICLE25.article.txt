# Christine McVie is lost without that Fleetwood Mac sound

It is a shame that far too
few listeners realized that the
band Fleetwood Mac' had been
around for 10 years prior to
Humours. The fact that so many
people think that Fleetwood
Mac was put together as a type
of backup band for Stevie
Nicks is even more repugnant,
for Fleetwood Mac had been
making great records before
Nicks cashed in on her spacey
sorceress image. Whether it
was the original Mac in its late
1960s blues incarnation or its
early '70s hard rock/pop one,
the band has always managed
to create consistently high
quality albums (that were,
however, commercial failures.)
Christine McVie, though,
joined the band at the tail-end
of its blues period and it was
her songwriting, harmonic
[vocalizing and melodic piano
Splaying which pointed the way
towards Fleetwood Mac's
future musical direction.
Therefore, although she too
had her roots in the blues (her
own '60s band, "Chicken
Shack," was blues-based) she
was the impetus that drove
Fleetwood Mac to assume a
more melodic, pop-structured
orientation. It was her har
monic, backup vocals which
thrust Fleetwood Mac's music
into a transcendent realm of
vocalization that only was
second to the Beatles and
Beach Boys' harmonies, while it
was her more personal and
emotional love songs that
should have garnered the air
play which the band needed to
survive.
However, with the addition
of Nicks and Lindsey Buckin
gham (on guitar) in 1975,
McVie got lost in the shuffle.
People, including critics.

praised the wonderful har
monies that soared throughout
this "new" band's material, but
few realized that McVie had
been singing in the exact same
style for the previous five
years or so. I guess, she just
lacked the mysterious and
Cosmopolitan-magazine beau
ty of Nicks, so she was seen as
the lesser female of the band.
However, for me, McVie was
always the best when it came
to songwriting and singing.
"You Make Lovin' Fun,"
"Warm Ways," "Don't Stop"
and "Love In Store" all point

McVie was the
impetus that drove
Fleetwood Mac to
assume a more
melodic, pop
structured
orientation.

to the fact that it was McVie
who was the person behind the
sound of Fleetwood Mac.
Therefore, when I heard that
McVie was about to release her
first solo album in 15 years, I
was anxious to hear it. I
assumed it would be, to quote
one of her finest songs, "over
my head." I thought that now
the world would see that
McVie was the essential mem
ber of Fleetwood Mac and
thus, would accord her the
respect and admiration she
rightfully deserved. So what
went wrong? Although my
opinion of McVie is unchanged,
I do find Christine McVie, her
self-entitled solo album, to be
a major disappointment. It's
not that it is so bad. Her sing
ing and playing are still up to par.
It's just that it lacks the
emotive power and drive that
dominated her usual Fleetwood

Mac compositions. The album
is very empty and hollow
(which is unlike McVie), and
only rarely does she instill her
songs with the beauty, grace
and meaning that I had come
to expect from her. Basically,
McVie has been too cautious in
putting together this album.
(Or maybe she deliberately
tried not to copy her Fleet
wood Mac style.) On the other
hand, she may have lacked the
personal confidence in compos
ing a whole LP (she co-wrote
almost all of the songs on this
album with her guitarist, Todd
Sharp), or she was fearful of
doing an album without having
Mick Fleetwood and John
McVie (her former husband)
solidly pumping away behind
her as she did in the Mac.
For instance, "Got A Flold
On Me," is the top-10 bound
single, but it is really one of
the worst songs she has ever
written (and the worst song on
this album). It sounds like a
vacuous Jackson Browne song
(a vapid version of
"Somebody's Baby,") and it is
devoid of any true sentiments
— "Ooh, I got a love (I got
somebody; This love (got a hold
on me)." Please — give me
Smokey Robinson! Further
more, whereas McVie trans
formed simple-minded love
songs into heartfelt, emotion
ally stirring love songs with
Fleetwood Mac (listen to
"Songbird," or "Warm Ways")
here, instead, the lyrics are to
tally inconsequential.
Therefore, even when she
redeems herself with an excel
lent melody (as in "Love Will
Show Us How,") the weak
lyrics still manage to drag the
song down. She even asks in one
song, "Somebody tell me,
what's a poor girl supposed to
do?" and I wish I knew what to
tell her.
However, there are a couple
of moments when one forgets

about the misguided attempts
that predominate on this al
bum. Usually, these precious
moments occur when she en
lists the help of some of her
friends and it is to them that the
credit must be given for instill
ing McVie with a better sense
of musical acumen. When she

lets fellow Fleetwood Mac
band-mate Lindsey Buckin
gham solo at the end of the
hard-edged ballad, "The Smile I
Live For," the listener is in
stantly reminded of the
clutching intensity of McVie's
"Oh Daddy" (off Rumours).
When she enlists Eric Clapton

to pluck away George
Harrison-style on "The Chal
lenge," it is one of the few
times when McVie does take "a
chance that you've gotta
take." However, it is really
only when she receives the sup
port from former Traffic
leader and singer Steve Win

wood that she truly breaks
out. Her bluesy duet with Win
wood, "One In A Million." is a
wickedly sexual scorcher that
finds McVie striving to keep up
with Winwood's aggressive
vocalizing, while "Ask
Anybody," (co-written by
McVie and Winwood, is a soft
synthesizer-driven ballad (with
piano and synthesizer played by
Winwood) which reminds the
listener just how lost one can
find oneself when listening to
McVie's voice.
But these successes are too
few to rectify the flaws of the
album as a whole. Although
Steve Winwood shines on his
contributions, (he easily gets
the "Best Supporting
Musician" award for this year).
McVie fails to do so on hers.
She has somehow forgotten
her skills as performer and
songwriter, and her album
shows it (or the lack of it.) A
sorry state, but one that will
hopefully be remedied some
the next Fleetwood Mac album
(whenever that may be.) And
then, we'll see if she still is
the sound of Fleetwood Mac or
not.
