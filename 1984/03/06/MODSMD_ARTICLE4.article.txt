# Nurses agree on 2-year contract
## Contract ends long dispute 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
University nurses, who have been
working without a contract since
Feb. 28, have ratified a two-year col
lective bargaining agreement, it was
announced yesterday.
The agreement, reached Thursday
morning after an all-night bargaining
i session, gives nurses here a 6 percent
salary increase each year. It was ap
proved by 584 of the 742 nurses who
voted on the contract. Stanford
employs 1250 nurses in all.

In a joint statement issued yester
day, chief labor attorney Priscilla
Wheeler and Hedy Dumpel, chief
negotiator for the Committee For
Recognition of Nursing Achievement
(CRONA), and CRONA President
Myra Lang said, "We are very pleased
that through the bargaining process
we were able to mutually develop an
agreement which meets the need of

the hospital and the nurses."
The previous contract, ratified in
1982 by a vote of 912 to 80, provided
a 10 percent increase for the first
contract year, and an 8 percent in
crease for the second. At that time,
the salary increases made Stanford
nurses the highest-paid in California.
With the 1982 contract, a nurse with
five-and-one-half years in the most
skilled of four categories received
$31,283 the first contract year, and

a beginning nurse with no work back
ground received $21,985.
The "work categories" by which a
nurse's salary is determined depend
on experience, training and activities
such as teaching or membership in
nursing organizations.
The negotiations for the new con
tract have been in progress since Jan
10, with Wheeler and Dumpd
beading.the respective negotiating
teams. According to Wheeler, the
agreement was reached "without any
disruption to the high quality pa
tient care for which Stanford is
known."
One difference between the 1952
contract and the present settlement

is that this is the first contract in
which the clinical nurses have been
represented by CRONA, the non
affiliated labor organization which
represents Stanford nurses.
Other members of the University
bargaining team included Dan Robin
son, Stanford Hospital director of
personnel. Associate Director of
Nursing Joyce Miller, Assistant
Director of Nursing Judy Lanigan,
Clinical Nursing Coordinator Laurie
Gunderson, and Associate Staff
Counsel Susan de Jongh-Kearl.
Others representing CRONA were
Lang, and registered nurses Sue
Elders, Alice Serbein and Jean
Krsank.
