# Oily rags blamed for Sunday's campus fire
## 
### 
Fire investigators have determined that the blaze that destroyed the
second floor of a campus home Sunday was caused by spontaneous combus
tion.
Rags used to treat furniture with linseed oil ignited on top of a garbage
can on the second-floor deck of the home, located at 884 Mayfield Drive, a
Fire Department spokesman said yesterday.
The official said linseed oil is so flammable the heat of the sun could have
caused the rags to spontaneously burst into flames.
The midday fire quickly spread from the deck throughout the second floor
of the home, including the kitchen, living room and dining room, causing an
estimated $200,000 damage to the home — $125,000 to the structure and
$75,000 to contents.
The home belongs to Stanford Surgery Prof. Donald Nagel and his wife
Patricia. Nagel was away on a skiiing weekend when the fire broke out at
noon Sunday. His wife, mother and mother-in-law were in the home but
escaped without injury.
