# Hart gains Super Tuesday momentum
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
Experts and Sen. Gary Hart supporters here
predicted yesterday that the C'oloradan's vic
tories in New Hampshire and Maine have set the
stage for him to enjoy victory on Super Tuesday
on March 13, the single day on which the largest
block of delegates will he chosen for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination.
"The key word," said Joel Bellenson. of Stan
ford Students with Hart, "is momentum."
Hart captured 50.7 percent of the vote and 12
delegates in Maine while former Vice President
Walter Mondale. the previous front-runner,
received 42 percent of the vote and 10 delegates.
Political Science Prof. David Danelski describ
ed Maine as a "fairly severe" setback to Mondale.
"It showed that New Hampshire was no fluke,"
he said.
According to Stanford experts, the spillover
from Hart's victory in Maine and New Hampshire

will allow the senator to emerge with the lead in
Vermont's "beauty contest" today. Vermont
holds a preference vote that does not bind
delegates to a candidate at the convention.
Experts also agreed that Hart should win the
Wyoming caucuses Saturday.
These two predicted wins, combined with
Hart's victories in Maine and New Hampshire,
will provide a serious challenge to Mondale. In
the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 28, Hart
pulled a first-place finish with 40 percent of the
total vote.
"I think it is the beginning of the end for Wal
ter Mondale," said Coit Blacker, the associate
director of Stanford's International Security and
Arms Control program, who helped formulate
Hart's defense policy.
"Walter Mondale became the front-runner in
the nomination process because everyone in the


Sen. Gary Hart
Democratic Party assumed that
spot." Blacker said. "He had never
been tested in an open primary."
An important testing of all the
Democratic contenders will occur on
March 13 when nine states will hold
either a primary or a caucus.
Delegates will be up for grabs in
Alaska. Alabama, Georgia. Florida.
Massachusetts. Nevada, Oklahoma,
Rhode Island and Washington.
According to Political Science
Prof, and Hoover Senior Fellow
Seymour Martin L.ipset, Hart should
take Massachusetts and post good
showings in at least Florida and
Washington. "Hart may very well
come out of Super Tuesday with a
lead," he said.
L.ipset said the vote for the
senator will essentially be an anti-
Mondale vote, cast by younger
people and people who are more af
fluent and better educated than
average.
"The anti-Mondale vote has been
interchangeable," he said. "But it is
now coalescing around Hart."
The momentum gathered from a
victory on the compacted Super
Tuesday will play a large role in the
nomination process. "If Hart does
well on March 13, the likelihood of
his receiving the Democratic
presidential nomination is greater
than 50 percent," Blacker said.
Bellenson agreed that Hart should
chalk up a strong March 13 showing.

"I think that Maine serves as an ex
ample that even in states where Hart
lacks organization, he can succeed,"
Bellenson said. Me added that
Mondale is probably making trou
bling analogies of Maine with the
South, where Hart also lacks a strong
organizational structure.
In the event that Hart should do
well on Super Tuesday and eventually
secure the Democratic nomination
for president, many analysts agree
that the Coloradan would provide a
far more serious challenge to Presi
dent Reagan than would Mondale.
Danelski described Hart as
"telegenic" and as a "formidable can
didate for Ronald Reagan."
"Mart is new and different, and
that is precisely the right theme for
the Democratic Party if it is going to
make a comeback." he said.
History Prof. David Kennedy
agreed that Hart provides a "more
plausible opponent." He said
Mondale's association with the
Carter administration is a liability in
the eyes of many Democratic voters.
l.ipset said much of Hart's success
on Super Tuesday may stem from the
senator's ability to take advantage
of a system designed to favor the
front- runner.
According to l.ipset. Hart's cam
paign of new ideas amounts to
"verbiage" because the contender
has not formulated a clear-cut plat
form. "Getting exposed to debates
and press coverage will hurt him."
said l.ipset. He concluded that the
compacted primaries will allow .Hart
to obtain a large portion of the vote

before he is forced to elaborate on
his position.
Bellenson disagreed that Hart s
position is nebulous.
According to Bellenson, Hart
favors a consumption tax to revive
the economy, a tax on polluters to
clean up the environment and an in
dividual training account — contrib
uted bv the employer and employee
— to retrain workers in case of an in
dustry's failure.
Blacker, one of the creators of
Hart's defense policy, outlined the
senator's approach to arms control.
He said Hart "was frustrated about
the failure of SALT II and concluded
that the people had lost touch with
the purpose of arms control.
Blacker said Hart seeks to bring
arms control back to the basics and
thus galvanize the public's support.
The senator believes that the pur
pose of arms control is to prevent
the use of nuclear weapons and to
provent a nuclear war. Blacker said.
Blacker said Hart's Strategic Talks
on Prevention (STOP) propose to
focus arms control negotiations on
scenarios that might trigger the use
of nuclear weapons rather than on
the numerical balance of weapons be
tween the two superpowers, which
has been the emphasis of past arms
control agreements.

"Mart is new and different, and
that is precisely the right theme for
the Democratic Party if it is going to
make a comeback." he said.
History Prof. David Kennedy
agreed that Hart provides a "more
plausible opponent." He said
Mondale's association with the
Carter administration is a liability in
the eyes of many Democratic voters.
l.ipset said much of Hart's success
on Super Tuesday may stem from the
senator's ability to take advantage
of a system designed to favor the
front- runner.
According to l.ipset. Hart's cam
paign of new ideas amounts to
"verbiage" because the contender
has not formulated a clear-cut plat
form. "Getting exposed to debates
and press coverage will hurt him."
said l.ipset. He concluded that the
compacted primaries will allow .Hart
to obtain a large portion of the vote

before he is forced to elaborate on
his position.
Bellenson disagreed that Hart s
position is nebulous.
According to Bellenson, Hart
favors a consumption tax to revive
the economy, a tax on polluters to
clean up the environment and an in
dividual training account — contrib
uted bv the employer and employee
— to retrain workers in case of an in
dustry's failure.
Blacker, one of the creators of
Hart's defense policy, outlined the
senator's approach to arms control.
He said Hart "was frustrated about
the failure of SALT II and concluded
that the people had lost touch with
the purpose of arms control.
Blacker said Hart seeks to bring
arms control back to the basics and
thus galvanize the public's support.
The senator believes that the pur
pose of arms control is to prevent
the use of nuclear weapons and to
provent a nuclear war. Blacker said.
Blacker said Hart's Strategic Talks
on Prevention (STOP) propose to
focus arms control negotiations on
scenarios that might trigger the use
of nuclear weapons rather than on
the numerical balance of weapons be
tween the two superpowers, which
has been the emphasis of past arms
control agreements.
Experts and Sen. Gary Hart supporters here
predicted yesterday that the C'oloradan's vic
tories in New Hampshire and Maine have set the
stage for him to enjoy victory on Super Tuesday
on March 13, the single day on which the largest
block of delegates will he chosen for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination.
"The key word," said Joel Bellenson. of Stan
ford Students with Hart, "is momentum."
Hart captured 50.7 percent of the vote and 12
delegates in Maine while former Vice President
Walter Mondale. the previous front-runner,
received 42 percent of the vote and 10 delegates.
Political Science Prof. David Danelski describ
ed Maine as a "fairly severe" setback to Mondale.
"It showed that New Hampshire was no fluke,"
he said.
According to Stanford experts, the spillover
from Hart's victory in Maine and New Hampshire

will allow the senator to emerge with the lead in
Vermont's "beauty contest" today. Vermont
holds a preference vote that does not bind
delegates to a candidate at the convention.
Experts also agreed that Hart should win the
Wyoming caucuses Saturday.
These two predicted wins, combined with
Hart's victories in Maine and New Hampshire,
will provide a serious challenge to Mondale. In
the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 28, Hart
pulled a first-place finish with 40 percent of the
total vote.
"I think it is the beginning of the end for Wal
ter Mondale," said Coit Blacker, the associate
director of Stanford's International Security and
Arms Control program, who helped formulate
Hart's defense policy.
"Walter Mondale became the front-runner in
the nomination process because everyone in the


Sen. Gary Hart
Democratic Party assumed that
spot." Blacker said. "He had never
been tested in an open primary."
An important testing of all the
Democratic contenders will occur on
March 13 when nine states will hold
either a primary or a caucus.
Delegates will be up for grabs in
Alaska. Alabama, Georgia. Florida.
Massachusetts. Nevada, Oklahoma,
Rhode Island and Washington.
According to Political Science
Prof, and Hoover Senior Fellow
Seymour Martin L.ipset, Hart should
take Massachusetts and post good
showings in at least Florida and
Washington. "Hart may very well
come out of Super Tuesday with a
lead," he said.
L.ipset said the vote for the
senator will essentially be an anti-
Mondale vote, cast by younger
people and people who are more af
fluent and better educated than
average.
"The anti-Mondale vote has been
interchangeable," he said. "But it is
now coalescing around Hart."
The momentum gathered from a
victory on the compacted Super
Tuesday will play a large role in the
nomination process. "If Hart does
well on March 13, the likelihood of
his receiving the Democratic
presidential nomination is greater
than 50 percent," Blacker said.
Bellenson agreed that Hart should
chalk up a strong March 13 showing.

"I think that Maine serves as an ex
ample that even in states where Hart
lacks organization, he can succeed,"
Bellenson said. Me added that
Mondale is probably making trou
bling analogies of Maine with the
South, where Hart also lacks a strong
organizational structure.
In the event that Hart should do
well on Super Tuesday and eventually
secure the Democratic nomination
for president, many analysts agree
that the Coloradan would provide a
far more serious challenge to Presi
dent Reagan than would Mondale.
Danelski described Hart as
"telegenic" and as a "formidable can
didate for Ronald Reagan."
"Mart is new and different, and
that is precisely the right theme for
the Democratic Party if it is going to
make a comeback." he said.
