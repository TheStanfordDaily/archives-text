Court rules on Nativity scenes
Washington — In its most important pronouncement in
more than a decade on the relationship between church and
state, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 yesterday that cities
may include Nativity scenes in their Christmas displays
without violating the First Amendment ban on any official
establishment of religion.
The court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Warren Burger,
approved the practice of Pawtucket, R. 1.. which, for 40
years, has included lite-sized figures of Jesus, Joseph and
Mary alongside a Christmas tree and a Santa Claus house in
its annual yuletide display. The American Civil Liberties
Union had persuaded two lower federal courts that the
city's official sponsorship of the creche was unconstitu
tional.
The language of the opinion clearly indicated that the
court believes judges have gone too far in trying to prevent
any government involvement in religious affairs. Burger
warned that Thomas Jefferson's concept of a "wall of
separation" between church and state is "a metaphor" and
"is not a wholly accurate description of the practical
aspects of the relationship that in fact exists between
church and state."
Israel, U.S. react to abrogation
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, angrily con
demning Lebanon for canceling its troop withdrawal and se
curity agreement with Israel and saying that Syria must
bear ultimate responsibility, said yesterday that Israel
would defend its own borders with its own troops in any
way it-sees fit.
Shamir said Israel remained ready to carry out the provi
sions of the U.S.-mediated pact should Lebanese President
Amin Gemayel again change his mind and reinstate it. But
the Israeli leader made it clear that his government was not
willing to enter new negotiations with Lebanon because it
"is incapable" of keeping its commitments.
Meanwhile in Washington the Reagan administration ex
pressed regret that Lebanon had canceled its May 17, 1983,
troop withdrawal agreement with Israel and warned that it
is up to Syria and the Lebanese opposition factions that
forced the abrogation to find an alternative plan for an Is
raeli pullout in south Lebanon.
In a tone more of sorrow than of anger, a statement read
by State Department spokesman John Hughes addressed
the long-expected action by Gemayel, stressing that the
L'nited States — which is now clearly on the sidelines in
Lebanon diplomacy — "does not intend to abandon the
people or the legitimate government of Lebanon."
"We regret this decision," the statement declared. "The
United States played a facilitating role in the negotiations
that produced that accord and was a witness to its
signature. That proposed agreement still represents the
only agreed formula for ensuring both Israel's withdrawal
from Lebanon and Israel's legitimate security interests in a
manner consistent with Lebanese sovereignty."
U.S. says Iraq using mustard gas
Washington — The State Department yesterday accused
Iraq of using internationally outlawed "lethal chemical
weapons" against Iranian troops ijvlb&.Akiee-and-one-halL ]

and recently U.S. officials have suggested that such claims
could be true. But yesterday marked the first public accusa
tion against Iraq by the Reagan administration, which, al
though officially neutral on the war, has tended to be more
sympathetic toward Iraq.
Citing "available evidence" against Iraq, the State De
partment said "the United States strongly condemns the
prohibited use of chemical weapons wherever it occurs.
There can be no justification for their use by any country."
Privately, some officials were less harsh on the Iraqis.
They said the country faced a situation in which it was
being attacked by waves of Iranian troops and where any
major crack in the Iraqi defenses could bring down the army
and the government. Thus, they said, it was not surprising
that Iraq would use any weapon in its arsenal.
Intelligence sources said the Iraqis are mostly using mus
tard gas, an incapacitating and sometimes lethal gas that
was employed extensively during World War I. Its use was
later banned under the 1925 Geneva Convention, which
Iran and Iraq signed.
The sources said Iraq is producing the poison gas in its own
facilities and that there are also indications that the
Middle East country has begun limited production of a
much more lethal nerve gas.
Iraq, Iran battle on two fronts
Baghad, Iraq — Fighting continued yesterday on the nor
thern front and east of the Tigris River in the Gulf War
and both Iraq and Iran claimed to have inflicted heavy
losses, reports arriving here said.
The official Iraqi News Agency INA said Iraqi jets and
helicopter gunships attacked Iranian positions and troop
concentrations east of Basrah and east of the Tigris River,
destroying "five boats, a truck and several troop concentra
tions."
Iranian artillery, meanwhile, shelled the Iraqi southern
port of Basrah and the border towns of Mandali and
Khanaqin, wounding six persons and damaging five cars and
two houses, INA said.
Iraqi forces killed 69 Iranian troops in the northern sec
tor of the war front, six others in the central sector and an
unknown number east of Basrah in a 24-hour period, INA
reported.
The official liu.iian news agency IRNA reported in Teh
ran that Iranian forces on Sunday shot down an Iraqi
aircraft at Talaye in southern Iran, and a number of Iraqi
troops were killed during exchange of fire in the region of
Khorramshahr and Abadan.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati called on the
United Nations Sunday to dispatch a special delegation to
Iran to "study the Iraqi use of chemical weapons against
civilians in Iran."
In a telegram broadcast by Tehran Radio, Velayati
accused the United Nations of not having shown "any posi
tive reaction" and charged that it "in fact has been a source
of encouragement for aggression."
The speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Hojatoleslam Ak
bar Hashemi Rafsanjani, said in an interview with Tehran
Radio on Sunday that Iran could accept occupied Iraqi terri
tory in return for dropping reparation claims of $250 bil
lion.
