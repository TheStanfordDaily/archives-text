## Lebanon terminates Israeli agreement 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Beirut, Lebanon — The Lebanese government, bat
tered into casting its fate with Syria, canceled its
troop-withdrawal and security agreement with Israel
yesterday and called for the resumption in Switzer
land of national reconciliation talks among Lebanon's
warring factions.
The abrogation of the pact, which was signed last
May 17, came on a day in which Israeli jets carried out
two air raids in the mountains overlooking Beirut. A
French soldier also was killed here early yesterday
morning and a U.S. Marine colonel was wounded as he
walked along Beirut's seafront corniche.
The abrogation came at a meeting of the Lebanese
Cabinet, which reconvened yesterday despite the fact
that all of its members resigned early last month to
protest shelling by the Lebanese army of the south
ern suburbs of Beirut. The meeting of the caretaker
Cabinet had been expected as part of a plan to give a
look of unity within the Lebanese government and to

deflect some of the blame for the cancellation from
Gemayel.
Many conservative Maronite Christians here
opposed abrogating the agreement with Israel and
wanted, instead, to tighten ties with the Jewish state
to the south. However. President Amin Gemayel. a
Christian, was said to be able to see no other way out
of the dilemma.
Fadi Hayek, chief spokesman for the Christian
Phalangist militia, said yesterday that the abrogation
leaves Lebanon "naked," adding, "The formal abroga
tion will put Lebanon on such a level that it could not
resist Syrian pressure.
"This means Lebanon cannot hold up to its own
signature," he said, "the reason being Syrian pressure
and destabilization of Lebanon. It means Lebanon
has no free will and is bound to accept Syrian pres
sure."
Dany Chamoun. another Christian leader and son
of former President Camille Chamoun, said yesterday
that he did not see what guarantees the Gemayel

government h;id received trom Syria in exchange tor
abrogation.
"This new union between Ciemayel and (Syrian
President Hafez) Assad, it seems like a consecration
of hypocrisy," he said. " I he only guarantees I can see
are that Gemayel will stay in office and Syria will pro
vide him with a new Cabinet. I m laying my bets there
will be no cease-fire."
Chamoun said, however, that he and his father
would attend any new round of reconciliation talks.
"Can I tell someone I don't want to negotiate ever
lasting peace?" he asked. "C an I tell that to the
people in the shelters? We will take any avenue to
peace through peaceful means."
Caretaker Premier Shafik Wazzan, explaining the
reconvening of the resigned Cabinet, said, "I have
agreed to withdraw the resignation for a very short
period." Wazzan. who has been in virtual seclusion
since he left office Feb. 5. added, "I hope the presi
dent will form a national coalition cabinet very, very
soon."
