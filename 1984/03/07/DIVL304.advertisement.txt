The greater the diversity of the RA staff, the greater the likelihood
that issues of race, ethnicity, and cross-cultural interaction will be
discussed in residences. Third World RAs help influence the
whole staff to assume respnsibility for addressing issues of race
and class in our society. Third World students who wish to
discuss RA responsibilities, compensation and time commitment
should call Alice Supton at 497-3044.
The Office of Residential Education is committed to appointing a
culturally diverse residence staff and to encouraging a program which
promotes cross-cultural interaction.
