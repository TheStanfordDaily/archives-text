I' TIME WARP is a process aiming to
penetrate what you think of as you. Continued fumbling
112 to try to get a fix on where you are can't silence the ear- J fc
i shattering scream of the future as it perpetually hurls
) through the hourglass. Sensations feel real, but are per- \%
' chance gone before striking the eyeball. The traps of ther-
V apy and mysticism merely set you up (C
) for the next steam- A roller as they con- lfc
sume your pre- cious moments.
\ Your path is forced deeper V%
' into a tissue <<< H )>> paper maze that
might as well be reinforced con
) crete. What you want is a mere \^_
microsecond out of V your reach; a hair
i splitting moment born by the fear of Pfc
' what you might find. A few may sense a spark, yet fleeting
dreams will not help other than insuring a safe distance. Z# 1
\ Not the smoke, but the blazing furor of a living reality \%
exists for those willing to tempt fortune.
