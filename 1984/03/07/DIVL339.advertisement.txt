Reach your peak performance in
computer modeling at Amdahl.
Amdahl introduced the 470 computer in 1975. In that machine, superior
performance gave us a competitive edge. We have maintained that edge in
our current 580 mainframes. You may be able to help us continue this
performance.
Computer Performance
Architecture
As a member of a team conducting research and development of advanced
modeling techniques for hardware performance evaluation, you would
• Develop new modeling algorithms
• Design and implement man-model interface
• Develop data collection and analysis tools
Your strong interest and aptitude in modeling could be the key to joining this
Amdahl team. To qualify, you will need an MS or PhD degree in Computer
Science, Math, EE, Operations Research, or related field; a background in
hardware/software performance evaluation is desirable.
Contribute to state-of-the-art modeling at Amdahl, where you will have
direct impact on future product development decisions. Send your resume
or letter of interest to Dr. Mark Goheen, Amdahl Corporation, Dept.
#3-07, P.O. Box 3470, Sunnyvale, California 94088. We are an
equal opportunity employer through affirmative action.
