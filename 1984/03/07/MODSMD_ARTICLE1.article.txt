# Immune receptor isolated
## Gene fights disease 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
A team of scientists under the
leadership of a Stanford researcher
has isolated the gene believed to reg
ulate the body's response to infec
tious and cancerous diseases.
Mark Davis, assistant professor of
mediocal microbiology, headed the
effort which led to the discovery and
cloning of the T-cell receptor gene.
Researchers around the world have
sought unsuccessfully the gene
which codes for the T-cell receptor
for at least a decade, according to
Davis.
In order to work properly, the
immune system relies mainly on B
cells and T-cells. While much is under
stood about B-cells, T-cells have
remained largely elusive to research
ers, Davis said.
The functions of both cells involve
recognizing foreign substances such
as viral infections or certain types of
tumor cells and destroying them.
"II there are still cancer cells in the
body, then the cells are not working
properly, and with this new gene in
formation, someday we might be able
to do something about that," Davis
said.
But Dr. David Cohen, one of
Davis' collaborators, said the re
search does not have immediate ap
plications.
"It's an important discovery that
falls within the realm of basic sci
ence, but right now it's not a cure for
any given disease," Cohen said.
According to Davis, though, scien
tists can finally begin to answer many
questions about the immune system
to which have long eluded im
munologists. "It's like when the
owner's manual for the car finally
cinncs,' Davis said, ll lt opens so
much up to study "
But Medical Immunology Prof.
Samuel Strober noted that " this is a
fundemental discovery and it won't
lead to any cures for diseases like
AIDS in the near future. It will,
however, contribute to a better un
derstanding of immunal diseases,
which someday just might save some
one's life."
Davis' collaborators are Dr. Step
hen Hedrick of UC-San Diego, Ellen
Nielsen of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Disease, Jos
hua Kavaler and Cohen in Davis' lab
oratory at Stanford.
