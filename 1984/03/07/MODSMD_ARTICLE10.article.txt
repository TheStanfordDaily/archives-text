# Iraq assails chemical warfare charge

From The Washington Post
Baghdad. Iraq —Iraq yesterday angrily denounced
the United States for supporting Iranian claims that
Iraqi forces have used chemical weapons against Iran's
troops in recent fighting. It also said it had launched a
major counteroffensive in its three-and-one-half
year-old war against Iran.
Iraqi Defense Minister Adnan Khairullah accused
the Reagan administration of "political hypocrisy"
for condemning Iraq's alleged use of poison gas shells
when American troops used what he called "all kinds
of chemical weapons in Vietnam."
Khairullah also told a press conference that Iraq
had launched a major counterattack yesterday morn
ing to recapture the Majnoon Island oil wells in the
frontier marshlands 20 miles east of Basra, near the
head of the Persian Gulf. He called the goal of retak
ing Majnoon "a top political priority."
/»<_• (Iranian nc?ws /RNA sait.l Iran's
forces laid "severely crushed the enemy counterat
tack in an intense battle" that killed or wounded an

estimated 1000 Iraqi troops and destroyed dozens of
Iraqi tanks and armored vehicles.)
Iran seized the island on Feb. 24 and said it would
keep Majnoon's estimated 7 billion barrels of oil
reserves as "war reparations."
Khairullah insisted, however, that Iraq would
deploy "any weapons at our disposal in any manner we
feel necessary."
Khairullah recalled the ordeal of the U.S. Embassy
hostages in Tehran and said he could not understand
"why the United States is flirting with Iran after the
inhumane and immoral treatment" of American
citizens held captive there.
He said the United States had not bothered to
condemn Iran for massacring Iraqi prisoners of war,
nor did it protest the closing of the Red Cross office
in Tehran. "If (Avatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini had
been able to put us in his stomach, he would have
done so,*' he* iidtlci/.
The American condemnation of Iraq, he said,
reminded the Arab world of the persisting "U.S. an

tagonism due to Zionist advisers who shove us aside
when we try to bridge the psychological gap with the
United States."
Khairullah criticized "the political hypocrisy of the
American position" when evaluated against U.S.
practices during the Vietnam War.
"Has the United States forgotten what it has
done?" he asked heatedly. "Vietnam did not launch
an offensive against the United States, yet what was
the purpose of the U.S. in using all kinds of chemical
weapons in Vietnam?"
(The United States has denied charges that it en
gaged in chemical warfare or used defoliants capable
of causing cancer and birth defects as antipersonnel
weapons in Vietnam.)
The Foreign Ministry spokesman said: "The United
States may be the last country with the. right to
speak about morals. It is the only country that \^'d
;itomic wcaporjs, destroyinii fJiroshirn;l ant! NagUS' t \Y\
during World War II with the pretext of reducing the
war's duration and number of victims."
