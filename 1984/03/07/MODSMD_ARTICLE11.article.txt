Vermont results
Montpelier, Vt. — Sen. Gary
Hart (D-Colo.), fueling a cam
paign that caught fire a week
ago, won a lopsided victory last
night in Vermont's Democratic
presidential primary. Walter
Mondale looked South and said
of the beauty-contest ballot
ing: "I assume Vermont will
hurt."
"If I were in

the White
House tonight,
1 would be very
concerned
about the Hart
candidacy. He
represents a tar
more significant
threat to the

president than does Walter
Mondale," said Oliver Henkel,
the winner's campaign
manager.
The win — Hart's third in
seven days — gave him a clean
sweep of northern New En
gland and great momentum
going into delegate-rich elec
tions March 13 in Massachu
setts and the South.
With 59 percent of
Vermont's 264 precincts
reporting, Hart had 21,994
votes, or 71 percent, to
Mondale's 6,015 votes and
about 20 percent. The Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who had 2,720
for 9 percent, awaited the
final returns with interest —
without 10 percent of the vote
lie stood to lose federal match
ing funds in 30 days.
A CBS News poll indicated

Hart drew support from voters
under 30 years old by an 8-1
margin. He also was outdrawing
Mondale among elderly voters
by 2-1 and he won the union
vote.
No delegates were at stake
prompting the "beauty con
test" description — but
Mondale had wanted to stem
the Hart surge.

Reagan's religious campaign
Washington — In a White
House videotape for the Rev.
Jerry Falwell's nationwide TV
special last weekend on "The
Moral and Spiritual State of
the Union," President Reagan
read the First Amendment,
paused, then reminded viewers
that nowhere does the Consti
tution explictly mention
"separation of church and
state."
Reagan is making heavy use
of religious settings, themes
and issues in his re-election
campaign. His speeches almost
always mention his stands on
prayer in public schools and tui
tion tax credits, both of which
he favors, and abortion, which
he would ban.
The day after Reagan an
nounced for re-election he ap

peared before the National
Religious Broadcasters Associ
ation. Yesterday he addressed
the National Association of
Evangelicals, the group to
which he made his "Evil
Empire" speech about the So
viet Union last year.
Declaring that government
must change its "hostility to
religion," Reagan said that a
constitutional amendment al-

lowing organ
ized vocal prayer
in public schools
"would do more
than any other
action to
reassert the
faith and values
that made
America great."

Strongly pushing for a con
troversial school prayer amend
ment now being debated on
the Senate floor, Reagan
rhetorically asked the 42nd an
nual convention of the Nation
al Association of Evangelicals:
"Hasn't something gone
haywire when this great Con
stitution of ours is invoked to
allow Nazis and Ku Klux
Klansmen to march on public
property and urge the exter
mination of Jews and the sub
jugation of blacks, but it
supposedly prevents our
children from Bible study or
the saying of a simple prayer in
their schools?"
One White House official,
who asked not to be identified,
said that Reagan's speech text
was considerably toned down
from an original draft to make
it less offensive to other

groups, some of them religious,
who oppose many of the things
the president and the evangeli
cals advocate, including prayer
in public schools.
The president, clearly mixing
politics with his philosophizing
on theology, asserted that
America seemed "to lose her
religious and moral bearings"
during previous administra
tions.
Reagan lamented that
during the decades of the
1960s and '70s "liberal atti
tudes viewed promiscuity as ac
ceptable, even stylish. Indeed,
the word itself was replaced by
the term 'sexually active.' And
in the media, what we once
thought of as a sacred expres
sion of love was often
portrayed as something casual
and cheap."
Candidates head south
Athens, Ga. — Sen. Hart,
promising "new leadership" if
elected president, accused
President Reagan of military
shortsightedness and
"economic immorality" and
Mondale of "just offering the
economics of the past."
Mondale also took his
presidential campaign to the
South, and declared in Tampa,
Fla., that he is "coming from
behind" in his bid to slow
Hart's pace.
Mondale cited no evidence
to support his contention that
his once-strong lead in the
South has evaporated com
pletely, and aides said privately
that they still believe that he

can win primaries Tuesday in
Florida, Georgia and Alabama,
now considered pivotal to his
hopes of winning the Demo
cratic nomination.
A new poll published in yes
terday's Miami Herald showed
Mondale still well ahead of
Hart in Florida, but Hart had
moved up rapidly since a similar
poll taken before the Feb. 20
lowa caucuses.
Mondale was favored by 38
percent of Florida's voters,
compared with 15 percent for
Hart, 7 percent for Jackson
and 5 percent for Sen. John
Glenn (D-Ohio). Mondale's
support held essentially steady
since the earlier poll, which had
showed Hart with 1 percent.
Mondale showed his concern
about the "Super Tuesday"
Southern primaries by deciding
to stay in the region until next
Monday. Previously, he was
scheduled to return to Wash
ington on Thursday night for a

day of rest.
He disclosed yesterday that,
after his loss to Hart in the
New Hampshire primary on
Feb. 28, he unsuccessfully
sought the endorsement of
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.)
Hart in Massachusetts
Boston — Hart's stunning
upsets in New Hampshire and
Maine have turned next Tues
day's Massachusetts primary
into a major battle for the
Democratic presidential
nomination — an election Hart
tu win ii lie is to con
tinue his momentum and
defeat Mondale.
Hart's strategy is to use
Massachusetts, where 100 of
the state's 116 delegates will
be at stake, to counter conser
vative constituencies in the
South on March 13, when nine
primaries and caucuses will take

place.
The race between Hart, 47,
and Mondale, 56. in Massachu
setts is a classic contest be
tween momentum and
organization — and momen
tum appears to have taken
hold. A Boston Globe Poll in
Monday's editions showed
Mart with a 12-point lead over
Mondale among 611 voters
who said that they were likely
to cast their ballots in the pri
mary.
Even before the New
Hampshire primary, there was a
worrisome sign for Mondale in
Massachusetts. As in other
states, members of the AFI.-
CIO were hard at work phoning
218,000 union members and
their families on the former
vice president's behalf.
Nevertheless, Mondale does
still have considerable support
that could be mobilized before
March 13. Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis has
turned over his field organiza
tion to the campaign. Mondale
has the endorsement of House
Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
plus key Massachusetts con
gressmen, including liberal
Democrat Barney Frank.
Hart's campaign has just
moved into larger headquarters
in Cambridge and is planning
field offices and phone banks
in other cities. Because Hart's
television commercials aimed
at New Hampshire were
televised over Boston's sta
tions, his theme of fresh lead
ership already is familiar to
many Massachusetts voters.

Vermont results
Montpelier, Vt. — Sen. Gary
Hart (D-Colo.), fueling a cam
paign that caught fire a week
ago, won a lopsided victory last
night in Vermont's Democratic
presidential primary. Walter
Mondale looked South and said
of the beauty-contest ballot
ing: "I assume Vermont will
hurt."
"If I were in

the White
House tonight,
1 would be very
concerned
about the Hart
candidacy. He
represents a tar
more significant
threat to the

president than does Walter
Mondale," said Oliver Henkel,
the winner's campaign
manager.
The win — Hart's third in
seven days — gave him a clean
sweep of northern New En
gland and great momentum
going into delegate-rich elec
tions March 13 in Massachu
setts and the South.
With 59 percent of
Vermont's 264 precincts
reporting, Hart had 21,994
votes, or 71 percent, to
Mondale's 6,015 votes and
about 20 percent. The Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who had 2,720
for 9 percent, awaited the
final returns with interest —
without 10 percent of the vote
lie stood to lose federal match
ing funds in 30 days.
A CBS News poll indicated

Hart drew support from voters
under 30 years old by an 8-1
margin. He also was outdrawing
Mondale among elderly voters
by 2-1 and he won the union
vote.
No delegates were at stake
prompting the "beauty con
test" description — but
Mondale had wanted to stem
the Hart surge.

Reagan's religious campaign
Washington — In a White
House videotape for the Rev.
Jerry Falwell's nationwide TV
special last weekend on "The
Moral and Spiritual State of
the Union," President Reagan
read the First Amendment,
paused, then reminded viewers
that nowhere does the Consti
tution explictly mention
"separation of church and
state."
Reagan is making heavy use
of religious settings, themes
and issues in his re-election
campaign. His speeches almost
always mention his stands on
prayer in public schools and tui
tion tax credits, both of which
he favors, and abortion, which
he would ban.
The day after Reagan an
nounced for re-election he ap

peared before the National
Religious Broadcasters Associ
ation. Yesterday he addressed
the National Association of
Evangelicals, the group to
which he made his "Evil
Empire" speech about the So
viet Union last year.
Declaring that government
must change its "hostility to
religion," Reagan said that a
constitutional amendment al-

lowing organ
ized vocal prayer
in public schools
"would do more
than any other
action to
reassert the
faith and values
that made
America great."

Strongly pushing for a con
troversial school prayer amend
ment now being debated on
the Senate floor, Reagan
rhetorically asked the 42nd an
nual convention of the Nation
al Association of Evangelicals:
"Hasn't something gone
haywire when this great Con
stitution of ours is invoked to
allow Nazis and Ku Klux
Klansmen to march on public
property and urge the exter
mination of Jews and the sub
jugation of blacks, but it
supposedly prevents our
children from Bible study or
the saying of a simple prayer in
their schools?"
One White House official,
who asked not to be identified,
said that Reagan's speech text
was considerably toned down
from an original draft to make
it less offensive to other

groups, some of them religious,
who oppose many of the things
the president and the evangeli
cals advocate, including prayer
in public schools.
The president, clearly mixing
politics with his philosophizing
on theology, asserted that
America seemed "to lose her
religious and moral bearings"
during previous administra
tions.
Reagan lamented that
during the decades of the
1960s and '70s "liberal atti
tudes viewed promiscuity as ac
ceptable, even stylish. Indeed,
the word itself was replaced by
the term 'sexually active.' And
in the media, what we once
thought of as a sacred expres
sion of love was often
portrayed as something casual
and cheap."
Candidates head south
Athens, Ga. — Sen. Hart,
promising "new leadership" if
elected president, accused
President Reagan of military
shortsightedness and
"economic immorality" and
Mondale of "just offering the
economics of the past."
Mondale also took his
presidential campaign to the
South, and declared in Tampa,
Fla., that he is "coming from
behind" in his bid to slow
Hart's pace.
Mondale cited no evidence
to support his contention that
his once-strong lead in the
South has evaporated com
pletely, and aides said privately
that they still believe that he

can win primaries Tuesday in
Florida, Georgia and Alabama,
now considered pivotal to his
hopes of winning the Demo
cratic nomination.
A new poll published in yes
terday's Miami Herald showed
Mondale still well ahead of
Hart in Florida, but Hart had
moved up rapidly since a similar
poll taken before the Feb. 20
lowa caucuses.
Mondale was favored by 38
percent of Florida's voters,
compared with 15 percent for
Hart, 7 percent for Jackson
and 5 percent for Sen. John
Glenn (D-Ohio). Mondale's
support held essentially steady
since the earlier poll, which had
showed Hart with 1 percent.
Mondale showed his concern
about the "Super Tuesday"
Southern primaries by deciding
to stay in the region until next
Monday. Previously, he was
scheduled to return to Wash
ington on Thursday night for a

day of rest.
He disclosed yesterday that,
after his loss to Hart in the
New Hampshire primary on
Feb. 28, he unsuccessfully
sought the endorsement of
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.)
Hart in Massachusetts
Boston — Hart's stunning
upsets in New Hampshire and
Maine have turned next Tues
day's Massachusetts primary
into a major battle for the
Democratic presidential
nomination — an election Hart
tu win ii lie is to con
tinue his momentum and
defeat Mondale.
Hart's strategy is to use
Massachusetts, where 100 of
the state's 116 delegates will
be at stake, to counter conser
vative constituencies in the
South on March 13, when nine
primaries and caucuses will take

place.
The race between Hart, 47,
and Mondale, 56. in Massachu
setts is a classic contest be
tween momentum and
organization — and momen
tum appears to have taken
hold. A Boston Globe Poll in
Monday's editions showed
Mart with a 12-point lead over
Mondale among 611 voters
who said that they were likely
to cast their ballots in the pri
mary.
Even before the New
Hampshire primary, there was a
worrisome sign for Mondale in
Massachusetts. As in other
states, members of the AFI.-
CIO were hard at work phoning
218,000 union members and
their families on the former
