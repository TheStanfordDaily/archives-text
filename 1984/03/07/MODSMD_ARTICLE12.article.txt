## The 						Stanford Daily Overt CIA actions 
### 
It's a very common scene. Recruiters arrive on
campus to talk with Stanford students about
job opportunities. Students interview — blue
blazers and pin-striped suits abound.
But this time there is something different,
something not so ordinary. Signs, banners and
leaflets mingle with the briefcases and resumes.
Not all students on the scene are interviewing.
And this is no ordinary recruiting organization.
It's the CIA.
Following a CIA advertising and direct-mail
blitz, approximately 150 Stanford students at
tended a CIA briefing session last week, and
about SO went through the interview process. It
was the first time that such a massive CIA ef
fort took place here. Said a CIA recruiter, "We
want to hire the best."
However, the CIA may have gotten a little
more than it expected. The Democratic
Socialists of America and the Stanford Central
American Action Network demonstrated
against the recruiting effort. DSA and SCAAN
rightly objected to the ClA's worldwide inter
ventionist policies of the past and present, in
cluding the current actions in Nicaragua. In
addition, the Gay and Lesbian Law Student As
sociation has been harshly critical of the
agency's refusal to hire homosexuals because of
"security" reasons.
It is unbelievable that the tax-supported CIA
can get away with hiring discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference. Come on — does

anyone really believe that homosexuals are more
of a security threat than heterosexuals? This is
a ridiculous excuse for outright discrimination.
We strongly support these protesting groups
and hope that their protests — though not
great in size — got the point across to the
recruiters and to students here.
However, while we support the protesters in
both their stands and their right to protest, we
also support the ClA's right to recruit on
campus. As much as we dislike some of the
ClA's actions, the University should not refuse
to allow the agency to meet with students here.
As hard as it may be to swallow, any company or
organization — whether it builds nuclear weap
ons, topples leftist governments or even dis
criminates against certain groups — should not
be denied access to the University or its stu
dents. To build isolating walls around Stanford
is not the answer and is not fair to students
here — those who want to work for such a com
pany, those who want to protest that company
and those who just happen to be walking
through White Plaza at the time.
That doesn't mean we don't encourage
protests against organizations who do any of
the above. We certainly do. But both the
protesters and the organization have a right to
be heard. We all benefit from the free exchange
of ideas. Open discussion must be an integral
part of any university environment.
