## Physical therapy is worth our while 
### 
The Stanford School of Physical
Therapy is now officially dead, a
casualty of changing priorities. What
makes this deplorable situation even
worse is that very few people seem to
care. The loss has affected me very
deeply.
You see, I have cerebral palsy. I use
crutches and a wheelchair to get
around on The Farm. 1 owe the
quality of my existence, indeed my
very life, to the caring and skill of

VIEWPOINT

physical therapists. I have been in
volved in the training of physical
therapists for more than 16 years
now, and 1 have spent many of those
years hearing about the extremely
capable alumni of Stanford's school.
Imagine my shock and sorrow when
1 heard that such a prestigious pro
gram was to be dismantled because it
no longer fit in with the goals of the
medical school and the University! A
strong statement with very sinister
implications, especially when one
considers the program's replacement
in the budget: a program in the very
glamorous and profitable field of

molecular and genetic medicine.
What an ironic substitute for one of
the most basic person-to-person
medical disciplines!
I have nothing against high-tech
medicine. I am sure that such work
and training will be quite valuable in
the future, but I cannot help ques
tioning the price being paid. What
good is there in seeing a breathtaking
array of double helixes if there is no
one around to help a wheelchair per
son. or a stroke or accident victim,
get up and walk? Physical therapy has
always been necessary, and it will still
be a fundamental human need when
these flashy new technologies are as
obsolete as chloroform and leeches.
On the other hand, perhaps the
University is right; the school is in
the way. It prevents students from
getting to the core of medicine. Why
should students waste their time
with living, breathing people when
the true excitement (and real
money) of medicine is in research?
Physical therapists are underpaid
drudges, anyway. They clash with the
august "medical Valhalla" image so
carefully promulgated by University
President Donald Kennedv and

others. Maybe we're better off with
out them.
This type of thinking shows that
for once Stanford cannot claim
moral superiority over the school on
the other side of the bay. Weenies or
not, the Berkeley community would
not have let a physical therapy pro
gram die. There would have been
riots in the streets, largely four
wheeled riots, on a scale not seen
since the days of free speech. There
was no such firestorm here, and that
is sad. Even I am too late. The
monolith has won.
Perhaps I am overstating the prob
lem. Perhaps the physical therapist
gap will be filled by some other
school, perhaps using yet nonexistent
funds. Perhaps the people who have
made the decision to axe the physical
therapy program will never have an
accident or end up in a wheelchair, or
do anything that would require a
physical therapist. On the other
hand, if they do. there should be no
problem at all. They can always
cuddle up to their electron micro
scopes.
