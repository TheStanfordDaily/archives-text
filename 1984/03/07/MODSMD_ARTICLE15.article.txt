# Reagan will do it the way it's got to be done
## 
### 
America seems to have come to a time of
decision. Having elected Ronald Reagan as
president once, and, incredibly, leaning
towards doing so again, it seems that the na
tional character has lurched into an active
mode. It is fitting, then, that we have not
only come around to an attitude conducive
to "getting things done," but we've actually
put in office a man capable of taking on the
responsibility to actually do these things.
What 1 am referring to. of course, is get
ting around to blowing up some of these
other, troublesome countries.
This hadn't seemed likely. The last time a
fiend held the oval office was in 1973, the
year Richa r d Nixon crumbled, having
foolishly aimed his evil machinations inward,
against treasonous elements within the dem
ocratic process, rather than outward, against
foreign foes. When they got around to
taking him away it seemed like America was
to be stewarded by a succession of mild
mannered. ineffectual bozos.
Nixon's ouster was, in retrospect, a

greater waste because it would have been so
much easier to explain all the bombing to
posterity if we could have made reference to
his now well-documented insanity. "Of
course he blew up Europe," we could have
said, "He was crazy!" Once he was gone it
looked like we would never get the chance to
have such an agent to take the burden of re
sponsibility from ourselves.
Gerald Ford was completely incompatible
with the need for such strong action. Ford
would not have been at all believable in the
role of world-destroyer. Yes, he was a nice
guy, but modern problems call for a killer.
Take the example of the Mayaguez inci
dent. There Ford attempted to be the sort
of demon that America needs, eschewing
diplomacy for a costly and unsubtle military
attack. The man screwed that expedition up
so greatly that it not only looked like a great
victory but actually was viewed as an
honorable action in certain parts of the
world. That kind of luck may be useful in
such small-scale expeditions, but would be

painfully transparent if he tried to fall on
The Button.
Similarily, the nationwide giggle-fit that
descended during the elections of '76, result
ing in the election of Jimmy "Cream Puff'
Carter, did not augur well for an active
America. Sure, the greatest power in the
world was pushed around by, of all things,
Iran — a nation so powerful that it is now
taking much of the effort of the military
machine known as Iraq to powder it —
and sure democratic governments fell in
those years like one-legged giraffes in an ice
storm, but at least he negotiated a lasting
(har, liar) peace in the Middle East.
The only mildly surprising aspect of the
conservative backlash of '80 was that the
winners didn't demand to be given ole
"Waffles" Carter's head on a plate.
Now sanity has returned to the political
scene. "Ultraviolent" Raygun sits in office,
nervously curling his finger in readiness to hit
that Button. Everyone knows that the day
is coming, and the only mystery is where the

outbreak will come. This is where we are
truly fortunate to have Reagan in office,
for only he could see the logic of the Plan.
Why head into hostilities against the So
viet Union, when there are so many other
places to hit first? Let's not do the Ruskies
any favors — let them sweat it out a little
bit. Instead, let's deal with all those net
tlesome unaligned, those vexing left-leaners
and those infuriating allies. Grenada was a
good start, but it simply wasn't big enough
to bomb.
Frankly, Canada's been getting a little up
pity lately, trying to dictate morality to us,
of all people. Who needs West Germans to
tell us if we can give them bombs to protect
their country? How much longer should we
put up with the Japanese expanding their
economy right into our backyards? Allies,
neutrals: Who needs them?
It we get started soon enough, we can
clean out a good portion of the world before
the Russians come up with any viable

response. They can't start bombing our
allies, because that's what we're doing! Once
that's all done, we can get about the busi
ness of taking care of Russia. Perhaps the
Russians will try to slow us by bombing
Western Europe, but hey, there's nothing
left there but a softly glowing mist of sub
atomic particles. Victory is inevitable.
Time's a-wasting. Any student of science
knows that once something's been hit with a
great huge nuclear warhead all it takes is
time tor it to become safe again. The more
we put it ott, then, the longer we're going to
have to wait until the south of France is
open tor American tourists, who can spend
American money while speaking American,
and if they get insulted by rude waiters, well,
at least they'll be rude American waiters.
It's good that we've got the man who can
get this done. It's only the logical thing to
do.

his now well-documented insanity. "Of
course he blew up Europe," we could have
said, "He was crazy!" Once he was gone it
looked like we would never get the chance to
have such an agent to take the burden of re
sponsibility from ourselves.
Gerald Ford was completely incompatible
with the need for such strong action. Ford
would not have been at all believable in the
role of world-destroyer. Yes, he was a nice
guy, but modern problems call for a killer.
Take the example of the Mayaguez inci
dent. There Ford attempted to be the sort
of demon that America needs, eschewing
diplomacy for a costly and unsubtle military
attack. The man screwed that expedition up
so greatly that it not only looked like a great
victory but actually was viewed as an
honorable action in certain parts of the
world. That kind of luck may be useful in
such small-scale expeditions, but would be

painfully transparent if he tried to fall on
The Button.
Similarily, the nationwide giggle-fit that
descended during the elections of '76, result
ing in the election of Jimmy "Cream Puff'
Carter, did not augur well for an active
America. Sure, the greatest power in the
world was pushed around by, of all things,
Iran — a nation so powerful that it is now
taking much of the effort of the military
machine known as Iraq to powder it —
and sure democratic governments fell in
those years like one-legged giraffes in an ice
storm, but at least he negotiated a lasting
(har, liar) peace in the Middle East.
The only mildly surprising aspect of the
conservative backlash of '80 was that the
winners didn't demand to be given ole
"Waffles" Carter's head on a plate.
Now sanity has returned to the political
scene. "Ultraviolent" Raygun sits in office,
nervously curling his finger in readiness to hit
that Button. Everyone knows that the day
is coming, and the only mystery is where the

outbreak will come. This is where we are
truly fortunate to have Reagan in office,
for only he could see the logic of the Plan.
Why head into hostilities against the So
viet Union, when there are so many other
places to hit first? Let's not do the Ruskies
any favors — let them sweat it out a little
bit. Instead, let's deal with all those net
tlesome unaligned, those vexing left-leaners
and those infuriating allies. Grenada was a
good start, but it simply wasn't big enough
to bomb.
Frankly, Canada's been getting a little up
pity lately, trying to dictate morality to us,
of all people. Who needs West Germans to
tell us if we can give them bombs to protect
their country? How much longer should we
put up with the Japanese expanding their
economy right into our backyards? Allies,
neutrals: Who needs them?
It we get started soon enough, we can
clean out a good portion of the world before
the Russians come up with any viable

response. They can't start bombing our
allies, because that's what we're doing! Once
that's all done, we can get about the busi
ness of taking care of Russia. Perhaps the
Russians will try to slow us by bombing
Western Europe, but hey, there's nothing
left there but a softly glowing mist of sub
atomic particles. Victory is inevitable.
Time's a-wasting. Any student of science
knows that once something's been hit with a
great huge nuclear warhead all it takes is
time tor it to become safe again. The more
we put it ott, then, the longer we're going to
have to wait until the south of France is
open tor American tourists, who can spend
American money while speaking American,
and if they get insulted by rude waiters, well,
at least they'll be rude American waiters.
It's good that we've got the man who can
get this done. It's only the logical thing to
do.
