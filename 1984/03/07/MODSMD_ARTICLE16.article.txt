## Outside contracting: everyone loses 
### 
In the past two weeks, article after article has
appeared in The Stanford Daily suggesting that
University Food Service should be contracted out
to outside corporations and "McDonald-ized."
This approach has already been tried at the
Medical Center and at the Tresidder cafeteria.
The Stanford community should take a close look
at the real cost of these operations: the cost of

The cost to workers
Contracting out of Food Service means replac
ing unionized University workers with non-union
workers. What does this mean? Here are the
words of Raphael Verbrera who has worked here
for 26 years and who is now the head cook at
Florence Moore:
"One of the things 1 regret most is that I
never got to know my children. Before we had a
union I'd get to Wilbur at 5:30 a.m. and I
couldn't leave until 7 p.m., although 1 only got
paid for eight hours. I had to work all seven days
just to survive. It was impossible to qualify for
rent in the area or to afford a car, so I had a long
journey each day on a motor scooter. My children
were asleep when I left and they were asleep
again when I got home at night."
Verbrera and other Stanford workers had mini
mum medical care and a tiny pension that in one
case added up to $52 a month. They had no en
forceable rights to be treated equally or fairly. If
someone refused to do unsafe work they could be
fired. If someone spoke up against abuse they

could be fired. That's why they put their heart
into building a union here, and winning the first
United Stanford Workers union contract in
1974.
Verbrera is still having a rough time. He works
six days a week to make ends meet, he still can't
afford to live in the area and he has a 27-year-old
car. But with the union contract he has the right
to an eight-hour day, better medical care, a
chance to be promoted, to be treated equally, to
file grievances, to speak freely and to refuse
unsafe work. There are many other rights in our
union contract but they all add up to one thing:
the right to be treated as a human being.
Tresidder cafeteria workers used to be part of
United Stanford Workers. Several years ago,
Tresidder management contracted out the
cafeteria to a non-union corporation. It is now
run by Servomation.
What does this contracting out mean to the
workers in the cafeteria? All the rights won by
the United Stanford Workers have been wiped
out for those workers. They now have no en
forceable rights, minimum benefits and most get
poverty-level wages of between $4 and $5 an
hour.
When I have gone through the cafeteria line, I
have been slipped notes by the cashiers because
the workers are afraid to be seen talking to a
union officer. One of the notes said: "We aren't
always getting our breaks. Is this legal?" I slipped
back a note saying no, it is not legal.
Another note followed that said workers were
Joeing threatened with firing if they were sick
more than a couple times. The point here is that
cafeteria workers with union rights have been

replaced by workers with no rights and who are
even scared to talk openly. Two people who
slipped me notes were eventually "let go." This is
a disgrace at a university. It is an indictment of
management and a sad commentary on how
quickly hard-won union rights can be lost.
Cost to consumer
Years ago the Medical Center contracted out
its food service to a large, non-union corporation.
Saga. You don't need a degree in sociology to
find out what people at the Medical Center
think of the food. Just walk down any corridor
and you'll hear complaints about the quality of
food, the portion and the cost.
I used to work at the Medical Center. My co
workers and I drove over to Tresidder to eat
there every day when it was still run by the Uni
versity. The food was good and there was plenty
of it. It was worth the drive. Then the food ser
vice was contracted out. The quality went down,
the portions got smaller and it wasn't worth the
drive anymore.
Even the football team tried using contracted
out food service and returned to using Branner
Hall.
We in United Stanford Workers do not believe
that the Stanford community wants its food ser
vice "McDonald-ized." Nor do we believe the
community condones management's use of anti
union tactics.
Management is trying to contract out more
and more of our union work because it weakens
the union and replaces workers with rights with
workers with no rights.

its food service to a large, non-union corporation.
Saga. You don't need a degree in sociology to
find out what people at the Medical Center
think of the food. Just walk down any corridor
and you'll hear complaints about the quality of
food, the portion and the cost.
I used to work at the Medical Center. My co
workers and I drove over to Tresidder to eat
there every day when it was still run by the Uni
versity. The food was good and there was plenty
of it. It was worth the drive. Then the food ser
vice was contracted out. The quality went down,
the portions got smaller and it wasn't worth the
drive anymore.
Even the football team tried using contracted
out food service and returned to using Branner
Hall.
We in United Stanford Workers do not believe
that the Stanford community wants its food ser
vice "McDonald-ized." Nor do we believe the
community condones management's use of anti
union tactics.
Management is trying to contract out more
and more of our union work because it weakens
the union and replaces workers with rights with
workers with no rights.
