## Committee reviews rigorous engineering curricula Associate Dean Masters discusses possible changes 
### KAREN BOLLERMANN Staff writer 
You are a hard-working,
career-oriented student. You
want more — more time, more
units, more sympathy. You are
the undergraduate engineering
student carrying 18 units of
three-unit classes.
The bulky course load of
most engineering majors is one
of a number of issues that the
School of Engineering is cur
rently considering in a review
of the undergraduate engineer
ing curriculum.
According to Gilbert
Masters, associate dean of the
School of Engineering, the pur
pose of the review is "to see
whether we can form a con
sensus of opinions about possi
ble problems in the program."
The issue has been discussed
for the past three quarters in
the Curriculum Committee of
the Undergraduate Council, a
group responsible for the un
dergraduate curriculum.
"There are two separate moti
vations for discussion of the
current program," Masters ex
plained. "First, the current
structure of the program was
designed 16 years ago. Maybe it
is time to look at it because of
its age.
"Second, the degree of
freedom that engineering un
dergraduates have to take
courses outside of engineering
has been greatly limited by the
addition of University distri
bution requirements and the
foreign language requirement,"
Masters said.
Despite the pinch that these
additional requirements have
put on engineering students'
course load. Masters ap
preciates the value of the re
quirements. "I am happy to see
the University requirements

because they force students to
take advantage of different
academic facets of the Univer
sity."
Unfortunately, the School
of Engineering, and therefore
the student, is finding itself in
a difficult situation. At pres
ent, Stanford's engineering
program receives recognition
from the Accreditation Board
for Engineering and Technolo
gy (ABET), a national board
which sets standards and grants
accreditation to member
schools and their graduates.
However, certain changes in
the program could cause engi
neering to lose its ABET ac
creditation status.

.. the current
structure of the
program was
designed 16 years
ago. Maybe it is
time to look at it
because of its age/

The requirements for
accreditation are two and one
half years of math, science and
engineering, which amounts to
115 units, according to
Masters. An accredited degree
certifies its holder as a
qualified engineer. "For some
fields, like civil engineering, ac
creditation is very important,"
Masters said
Yet as the University piles
on more distribution require
ments, these 115 units neces
sary for accreditation become
little more than a hazy and of
ten unachievable goal to the

prospective engineer. This is
one of many dilemmas that the
committee is addressing.
Masters defined the current
dilemma as a factor of two
constraints. "The first is main
taining ABET accreditation.
The second is that the more at
tractive the engineering pro
gram becomes (due to proposed
decreases in the required unit
load), the larger our rate of
growth will be," Masters said.
Engineering students
compose one-fourth of the
entire undergraduate popula
tion, while engineering faculty
is only one-tenth of the fac
ulty population.
"Engineering is already so
popular that we have more stu
dents than we know what to do
with," said Masters. "Due to
the University's policy on
declaring a major, we have no
way to restrict growth. We also
don't have the resources to ac
commodate the expected in
crease in students."
The Engineering Advisory
Council, composed of corpor
ate leaders, alumni and deans
from other schools, met a
month ago to discuss some pos
sible proposals. One proposal
offers a dual path toward an
engineering degree.
"The program would have
the individual engineering de
partments design a 90-unit
program emphasizing math, sci
ence and depth. An optional
25-unit program would be of
fered to receive ABET ac
creditation. This would provide
25 'free' units for students,"
Masters explained.
Another proposal would
decrease the engineering re
quirements by a more modest
number of units while still
trying to maintain accredita
tion.
A suggestion from the Sub

committee on Student
Information and Attitudes
would change the unit value of
engineering classes from three
to five and then require more
units for engineering graduates
to ensure that all important
subjects are covered.
According to Masters,
"Another factor is that the
current dean of the School of
Engineering, Dr. William Kays,
will be stepping down on Sep
tember 1, 1984. This will be
one thing that the new dean
will have to deal with. We need
to have an informed opinion to
present to the new dean when
he or she is named."
Masters stressed one final
point. "We aren't ready to
defend any point of view yet.
We want to keep discussion
open. We want to keep it on
the front burner.
"We are hoping that some
thing will emerge from within
the departments, but at this
point, there is no clear indica
tion of where we are going. We
want everyone to think about
it, talk about it, so that they
will have well-thought-out
opinions about what should be
done," Masters said.
"If indeed there are going to
be changes implemented in the
program, the earliest they will
be effected is academic year
1985-86," Masters said. "It is
also possible that there will be
few to no changes."

The Engineering Advisory
Council, composed of corpor
ate leaders, alumni and deans
from other schools, met a
month ago to discuss some pos
sible proposals. One proposal
offers a dual path toward an
engineering degree.
"The program would have
the individual engineering de
partments design a 90-unit
program emphasizing math, sci
ence and depth. An optional
25-unit program would be of
fered to receive ABET ac
creditation. This would provide
25 'free' units for students,"
Masters explained.
Another proposal would
decrease the engineering re
quirements by a more modest
number of units while still
trying to maintain accredita
tion.
A suggestion from the Sub

committee on Student
Information and Attitudes
would change the unit value of
engineering classes from three
to five and then require more
units for engineering graduates
to ensure that all important
subjects are covered.
According to Masters,
"Another factor is that the
current dean of the School of
Engineering, Dr. William Kays,
will be stepping down on Sep
tember 1, 1984. This will be
one thing that the new dean
will have to deal with. We need
to have an informed opinion to
present to the new dean when
he or she is named."
Masters stressed one final
point. "We aren't ready to
defend any point of view yet.
We want to keep discussion
open. We want to keep it on
the front burner.
"We are hoping that some
thing will emerge from within
the departments, but at this
point, there is no clear indica
tion of where we are going. We
want everyone to think about
it, talk about it, so that they
will have well-thought-out
opinions about what should be
done," Masters said.
"If indeed there are going to
be changes implemented in the
program, the earliest they will
be effected is academic year
1985-86," Masters said. "It is
also possible that there will be
few to no changes."

You are a hard-working,
career-oriented student. You
want more — more time, more
units, more sympathy. You are
the undergraduate engineering
student carrying 18 units of
three-unit classes.
The bulky course load of
most engineering majors is one
of a number of issues that the
School of Engineering is cur
rently considering in a review
of the undergraduate engineer
ing curriculum.
According to Gilbert
Masters, associate dean of the
School of Engineering, the pur
pose of the review is "to see
whether we can form a con
sensus of opinions about possi
ble problems in the program."
The issue has been discussed
for the past three quarters in
the Curriculum Committee of
the Undergraduate Council, a
group responsible for the un
dergraduate curriculum.
"There are two separate moti
vations for discussion of the
current program," Masters ex
plained. "First, the current
structure of the program was
designed 16 years ago. Maybe it
is time to look at it because of
its age.
"Second, the degree of
freedom that engineering un
dergraduates have to take
courses outside of engineering
has been greatly limited by the
addition of University distri
bution requirements and the
foreign language requirement,"
Masters said.
Despite the pinch that these
additional requirements have
put on engineering students'
course load. Masters ap
preciates the value of the re
quirements. "I am happy to see
the University requirements

because they force students to
take advantage of different
academic facets of the Univer
sity."
Unfortunately, the School
of Engineering, and therefore
the student, is finding itself in
a difficult situation. At pres
ent, Stanford's engineering
program receives recognition
from the Accreditation Board
for Engineering and Technolo
gy (ABET), a national board
which sets standards and grants
accreditation to member
schools and their graduates.
However, certain changes in
the program could cause engi
neering to lose its ABET ac
creditation status.

structure of the
program was
designed 16 years

time to look at it
because of its age/

The requirements for
accreditation are two and one
half years of math, science and
engineering, which amounts to
115 units, according to
Masters. An accredited degree
certifies its holder as a
qualified engineer. "For some
fields, like civil engineering, ac
creditation is very important,"
Masters said
Yet as the University piles
on more distribution require
ments, these 115 units neces
sary for accreditation become
little more than a hazy and of
ten unachievable goal to the

prospective engineer. This is
one of many dilemmas that the
committee is addressing.
Masters defined the current
dilemma as a factor of two
constraints. "The first is main
taining ABET accreditation.
The second is that the more at
tractive the engineering pro
gram becomes (due to proposed
decreases in the required unit
load), the larger our rate of
growth will be," Masters said.
Engineering students
compose one-fourth of the
entire undergraduate popula
tion, while engineering faculty
is only one-tenth of the fac
ulty population.
"Engineering is already so
popular that we have more stu
dents than we know what to do
with," said Masters. "Due to
the University's policy on
declaring a major, we have no
way to restrict growth. We also
don't have the resources to ac
commodate the expected in
crease in students."
