The ceremonies, chaired by Board of Trustees Presi
dent William Kimball, included lectures by three
prominent cardiologists and were attended by about
250 people.
Dominick Purpura, dean of the Medical School,
culled the addition of the Center "a unique opportu
nity for Stanford to concentrate 011 ;ind develop pro
grams in cardiovascular research which have been
wanting and which have had ditticulty in moving due
to facility constraints."
The new facilities have also prompted the forma
tion of a committee to develop a plan for expanding
the cardiovascular research program.
The expansion will involve adding new faculty. Pur
pura said he "doubts that anyone will be able to
resist" the combination of the Center and Stanford's
academic environment, adding that it will permit
"recruitment of some of the best minds in cardiovas
cular research."
"This facility is bringing together in close proximity
both the medical and surgical cardiologic groups,"

which will allow more organized integration of both,
Cardiology Prof. Donald Harrison said.
That will allow more organized integration of the
groups.
The building, located at Quarry Road and Blake
Wilbur Drive, will house the academic and research ac
tivities of the department of cardiovascular surgery
and the division of cardiology.
The research center is named for Ralph and Marian
Falk of Chicago. Mrs. Falk, the largest individual
donor on the project, selected Stanford as the site to
mcrnoriuilx.c her h ustttarnJ. u nurgoon mt«J co-ft tut ado r «>/
Baxter Laboratories.
Purpura called the facility unique "since it was
funded exclusively on private money."
The Max Fleischmann Foundation of Nevada con
tributed $4 million, and the Conrad Hilton Founda
tion donated $400,000. More than 100 individuals
also donated money.
The amount of Falk's donation was withheld at her
