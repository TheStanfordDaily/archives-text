## It's been a long season... what's next? 
### 
"Do we have a chance?"
"Will we get a bid?"
You would have to figure
that after 30 games and its
best season since 99 percent of
the present undergraduate
population was born that the
Stanford Cardinal men's bas
ketball team could have an
swered some of these
questions; after all, fans have
been making these queries since
the beginning of the season.
But no, it hasn't. In fact,
the Cardinal has done only
more to cloud the prospects of
getting a National Invitational
Tournament (NIT) bid in
recent weeks and everyone
from Head Coach Tom Davis
to the griffins that stand in
front of Encina Gym seems to
have a confused look on his
face.
Stanford's record is now 19-
1 1 and even if it were to lose
Thursday night to the Univer
sity of Oregon in Eugene, a 19-
12 mark is usually good enough
to get into the NIT.
That means the Cardinal is
in, right? Well, not quite so
fast.
If we turn back the clock to
the Stanford preseason, in
which it went 11-1, we find
that most of those 11 victories
came against powerhouse
teams. However, they're
powerhouses at the Division II
or NAIA level. Stanford is a
Division I school.
But, you and John Revelli
point out. the Cardinal needed
those victories to build its con
fidence and get started on the
right track. Also, it did play
the No. 1-ranked University of
North Carolina, and gave it
a very tough game despite
losing.
Fair enough, the Cardinal
probably did benefit from its
scheduling. The problem,
however, is that that confi
dence-building almost
backfired when Stanford lost
its first six Pacific-10 Confer
ence games.
The other problem is respect.
Although the NIT doesn't give
out bids in the same manner as
the NCAA tournament direc
tors, the principles are similar.
One of the NCAA's prin
ciples in ranking teams for bids
is that it doesn't count games
against non-Division I schools.
If that same principle holds
true for the NIT, Stanford
could be in a lot of trouble.

Then there's the matter of
the Pac-10. Stanford is now 8-
9 and in fifth place in the con
ference. Only one term comes

to mind to describe this per
formance: mediocre.
Yes, there have been some
spectacular moments, like wins
against UCLA and the Univer
sity of Washington Rut there
were some just as unspec
tacular moments, like losing to

the University of California at
home and then last-place
Washington State the
weekend before last.
Stanford did manage to
come back from its early season
0-6 conference mark with
seven straight wins, "getting
the fans off their seats and on
their feet," as the Athletic
Department had originally
hoped.
But then, just as it had es
tablished itself as a legitimate
contender, the Cardinal lost
three of its last four. One of
those losses was expected
(Washington in Seattle), but
two others (Washington State
and Arizona) were major set
hacks.
Both of these teams were

below the Cardinal in the
standings and had been easy
prey in previous games.
Even more important than
the disheartening effect of
losing is the two-fold effect
that these losses had on Stan
ford's record.
First, the Cardinal now has
an 8-9 mark in the Pac-10. But,
you say, it is still in fifth place
in the conference, a very evenly
matched one at that.
So what; conference stand
ing holds very little weight
when your losses outnumber
your wins. The Cardinal had a
golden opportunity to assure
itself a winning record and it
failed. It also could have moved
up in the conference standings,
making that so-so fifth look

like a strong fourth, or even
third.
Second, when you start to
lose the important games at
the end of the season, the
people who hand out bids think
only one thing: choke. Tourna
ment directors don't like
chokers.
What this all means is that
Stanford must win on
Thursday in Oregon. A win
would not only even its record
at 9-9, but would also give it
two wins to finish the season
just when it needs them
most.
Whether it can win on
Thursday is another question.
But no matter what happens,
at least those early questions
will finally be answered.
