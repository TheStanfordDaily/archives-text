# Card sluggers snap the Gators
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Using its newly found prowess at the
plate to the fullest, the Stanford baseball
team registered an K-6 come-from-behind
victory over the San Francisco State
Gators in a non-conference road game yes
terday.
The Cardinal, now 13-12-1. pounded out
a season-high 15 hits against SF State
pitching after lacing 24 hits in the final
two games of last weekend's series at the
University of Arizona.
One person who is clearly relieved by this
new firepower is Stanford Head Coach
Mark Marquess. "We're hitting the ball
much better than we had earlier in the
year."
This time, Stanford delivered the clutch
hits after falling behind 4-0 to its in
hospitable opponents. Least hospitable
was Marc Nadale who welcomed Card
starter Al Osuna with a three-run home
run in the bottom of the first inning. The
Stanford freshman was then rocked by
Steve Glass' solo blast in the next frame,
giving the Gators their four-run cushion.

The Cardinal manufactured one run
without a hit in the third to close the gap
to 4-1 and then rolled out the heavy ar
tillery in the sixth.
John Verducci got one of his three hits,
a two-out RBI double to left, to score
Walt Harris with Stanford's second run.
Ken Green followed with a base hit to
right field that became a triple when the
Gators' outfielder slipped and fell, allow
ing the ball to roll all the way to the wall.
Green went 2 for 3 on the afternoon
and was among five Cardinal players with
at least two hits, the others being Ver
ducci, Harris, Mark Davis and Rick
Lundblade.
While senior pitcher Steve Cottrell had
come on to quell the SF State offense, the
Card finally garnered the lead on the
strength of a three-run seventh inning
rally. It started slowly when Darryl Step
hens reached first base after being hit by a
pitch for the sixth time this year.
Lundblade, Verducci and Ruben Amaro, Jr.
followed two walks with consecutive RBI
singles to push Stanford on top 6-5.

It did not last very long, however, be
cause the Gators loaded the bases with
two outs in their half of the inning.
Marquess decided that Cottrell was
finished after working the next hitter to a
3-0 count.
The Stanford boss waved in junior right
hander David Harris who promptly fired
two strikes, but forced the tying run
across the plate when he just missed with
his next offering.
Harris stifled the Gators on one hit over
the remaining two-and-one-third innings
and recorded his first win against one loss
when Mark Davis' double down the right
field line brought Pete Stanicek home
from second in the eighth. Stanford closed
out the scoring when Davis scored on a
sacrifice fly by Mike Deßenon.
"(Harris) was really in command today,"
said Marquess last night. "He had good
movement on Ins fastball and good control
of his curveball." Marquess also noted that
Harris may see some time as a starter now
that senior Brian Myers is out of action
for two or three weeks with an injury.
