# Vandal defaces 'Gay Liberation'
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
Artist George Segal's recently in
stalled "Gay Liberation" sculpture
was vandalized last night when it
received more than 25 hammer blows
that will probably make it a total
loss, according to an art doctoral can
didate here.
Dents and chips in the faces and
bodies of all four figures in the
$150,000 work damaged it so badly
that it will probably have to be
recast at a cost of at least $50,000,
according to Gerard Koskovich, an
art doctoral candidate and member
of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (GLAS) steering commit
tee.
The University does not have in
surance on the sculpture and will
probably have to pay the damages,
Koskovich said.
Senior Gil Ureno said he saw a 6-
foot-1 young white man with a beard
holding a hammer in his right hand
walking away from the sculpture at
about 7:40 p.m. Ureno said he
decided to check the sculpture when
he heard a loud pounding sound as he
was leaving the Psychology Depart
ment.
Ureno described the man as a
"nonchalant," "disheveled," and "a
typical graduate student."
"He just walked away as if nothing
happened," Ureno said.
Ureno said he followed the man
across Serra Street to the Biology
Department where he lost him.
"I figured if I chased after him,
he'd run away. And he had a hammer
in his hand," he said.

Police said they were first notified
about the incident by an anonymous
female caller speaking from a tele
phone booth.
Stanford Police Officer Nick
Brunot said police have no suspects
and they are still investigating the
incident.
The dents and chips damaged both
the white chemically treated bronze
outer layer and the hard bronze main
body. The dents were made mainly on
the faces indiscriminately between
the male and female figures.
Koskovich said the cost of repair
ing the figures would probably exceed
the cost of recasting the figures.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, who was
instrumental in getting the work
here, refused to estimate the costs
of repair or comment on the incident
after inspecting the damaged
sculpture last night.
"I don't want to be cooperative
because there are too many things
that have to be worked out on this,"
he said.
The work, which Koskovich said is
the first public monument to
homosexuals installed in the United
States, is on indefinite loan from the
Mildred Andrews Fund until it is ap
proved for installation in the Harvey
Milk Plaza in San Francisco.
Segal, an internationally
reknowned artist, must give permis
sion for another sculpture to be
recast, Koskovich said. The only
other cast of the work is currently in
a traveling exhibition on the East
Coast.

A vandal wielding a hammer last night defaced the "Gay Liberation"
statue on display near the Math corner, denting and chipping the
chemically treated bronze exteriors on all four of the figures. The black
marks in this photo signify the damage.
