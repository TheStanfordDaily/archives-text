# ASSU Senate split on voting issue

### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate decided last night not to change the
current fee assessment refund system, which requires
that a student turn in a voting receipt to collect up to
$48 in annual refunds.
Legislation by senator Mark Soble called for elimina
tion of the receipt. Soble's plan would have substituted
a form which a student would sign at the time refunds
were collected stating he had in fact voted.
But Council of Presidents Member Peter Spivack
countered Soble's proposal. "The moral stricture of sign
ing a statement would not stop me from collecting a
refund if I were an average student . . . and I'm less
morally suspect than a lot of other people," he said.
Despite Soble's objections, the senate decided that
the receipt system is not an unnecessary burden on stu
dents nor an abridgement of the Honor Code, and voted
the measure down.
An attempt by senator Roland Van Gaalen to rescind
the Senate's approval of the budget failed at last
night's meeting after Van Gaalen contended that
senators who were also Band members displayed a con
flict of interest by voting on the band budget.
Van Gaalen. addressing the senate during open forum,
said he was "certainly not running any kind of campaign
against the Band. but added. "The senate has allowed
itself to subvert its due process through this decision."
According to the constitution. Van Gaalen said, the
Band's budget modifications would have to be approved
by the senate, but in the budget that passed last Tues
day this was not the case. Also, Van Gaalen said, there
exists $1 ().()()() in "unextended funds" that the Band
retains and will not utilize.

Several senators seemed to feel that changing their
decision on the Band's budget would do more harm than
good. "We can't keep going hack and forth on this deci
sion," senator David Porter said. Since the deadline for
submitting petitions is Friday, a special exception would
have to be made in the Band's case had the senate voted
against it.
Other senators mentioned that the conflict of inter
est issue was a minor one. Van Gaalen said the budget
approval represented a direct financial reimbursement
to the four voting senators in the Band, since $21,000 of
the $75,000 Band budget goes towards the Band's first
game roadtrip to Oklahoma. Each Band member receives
approximately $125 in travel expenses. Van Gaalen cal
culated.
However, all but one of the Band members in the sen
ate who intended to take the road trip did not vote on
the Band budget, Soble said. Senator Eric Thompson
commented that it there was the slightest evidence ot
conflict of interest, the budget should be reconsidered,
but senator Robert Blum countered that the whole con
flict of interest issue was "bunk."
After the meeting Band Manager Ben Langlotz
defended the Band, saying that students had a negative
image of the Band's professional management just be
cause of their unconventional style.
"People think that just because we're unconventional
on the field and with our music, we're irresponsible in our
finances. People see that we like to party and they tor
get the professional side of the Band's management.
Langlotz explained that the Band actually has three
separate funding sources and three separate budgets;
over half of the Bands' money comes
from the ASSU. hut the other halt is
subsidized by the Athletic and Music
Departments.
Each source allocates money for
different portions of the Band's
budget.
"II there is an overflow in one sec
tion of the budget and a deficit in
the other, there is absolutely no
transfer of funds," Langlotz said.
The ASSU approves the entire
Band budget. Langlotz said, but
there is often confusion about which
money comes from where.
"The budgets are actually very
separate." Langlotz said. The contu
sion is augmented by the fact that
the three funding sources have dif
ferent budget deadlines.
The conflict of interest situation,
according to Langlotz was "just an
internal political issue with the sen
ate." and had no ultimate bearing on
the budget decision.
