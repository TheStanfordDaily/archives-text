The Polish crisis of 1980-81 was the "most
serious systemic crisis" in Eastern Europe since
the break between Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito
and the Soviet Union's Josef Stalin, an East
European expert told about 30 people in the His
tory corner yesterday.
UCLA Political Science Prof. Andrzej Kor
bonski said the conflict over the Polish workers'
union Solidarity represented a "major challenge
to the existing system" in Poland.
In contrast. Korbonski said, other disturbances
in Eastern Europe since the 1948 Yugoslav split
with the Soviet camp have all been "less danger

ous or less threatening" than the Solidarity crisis.
The Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the Al
banian switch to the Chinese camp and the 1968
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia were all impor
tant developments in recent East European his
tory. Korbonski said, but they did not pose the
same sort of major systemic challenge
represented by the Polish crisis.
Because Poland is a key member of various eco
nomic. political and military alliances in Eastern
Europe, the politicization of the Polish popula
tion that occurred in 1980 seriously endangered
regional stability. Korbonski said.
Poland's military tradition, armaments indus
trv and armed forces make it an "important com

ponent of the Warsaw Pact." Korbonski said. In
addition, its abundance of labor and raw materi
als makes it an important member of the Council
for Mutual Economic Assistance.
Even though Poland could be viewed as a politi
cal liability to the Soviet Union, Korbonski said,
its military and economic assets also make it "one
of the most valuable members of the alliance."
This importance made the crisis in Poland all
the more disturbing to the Soviet leaders. In
fact, Korbonski said, the Soviet Politburo was al
most exactly split on the question of invading
Poland. The late Soviet leader L eonid Brezhnev
Ist the deciding vote against that
pioposed intervention, he said.
According to Korbonski, who
serves as director of the Center for
Russian and East European Studies
at UCI.A, one of the reasons that
the Soviet Union did not intervene
may have been a fear of endangering
relations with Western Europe.
"Any precipitate action in Poland
would have put an end to a budding
detente," he said.
The Polish crisis has had adverse
military, economic and political ef
fects on Eastern Europe as a whole,
Korbonski said.

Because military officials have had
to take over so many aspects of
Poland's government, their atten
tion has been diverted from military
matters. As a result, the country's
military value has diminished.
"Clearly the crisis and the imposi
tion of martial law has had an effect
on the military preparedness and
strength of the Warsaw Pact," he
said.
The crisis also hurt Eastern Europe
economically, Korbonski said.
Poland's reduced production of raw
materials and increasing reliance on
Soviet aid has damaged Poland's East
European neighbors, causing them to
be unsympathetic to the Polish
workers' demands.
"They view the Poles as bums, lazy
troublemakers," Korbonski said. The

adverse economic effects on the
other Eastern European nations
caused b\ the Polish crisis "created
the kind of atmosphere ... (in
which) it was relatively easy to he cri
tical of Solidarity, to condemn
(Lech) Walesa."
Although the spillover political ef
fects of the Polish crisis on other
East European nations were minimal,
Korbonski said, the crisis did present
a major embarrassment for the So
viet Union.
Currently, the Polish situation has
stabilized. Korbonski said. The gov
ernment proved correct in its belief
that ''the sheer economic hardship of
taking care of everyday needs would
disarm, would finally force people to
roll over."
