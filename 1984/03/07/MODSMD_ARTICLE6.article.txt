The Polish crisis of 1980-81 was the "most
serious systemic crisis" in Eastern Europe since
the break between Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito

UCLA Political Science Prof. Andrzej Kor

regional stability. Korbonski said.
Poland's military tradition, armaments indus

its military and economic assets also make it "one
of the most valuable members of the alliance."
This importance made the crisis in Poland all
the more disturbing to the Soviet leaders. In
fact, Korbonski said, the Soviet Politburo was al
most exactly split on the question of invading
Poland. The late Soviet leader L eonid Brezhnev
