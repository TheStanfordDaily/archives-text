Gemayel calls Lebanese leaders
to reconciliation meeting
Beirut, Lebanon — President Amin Gemayel yesterday
formally invited Lebanon's top politicians to reconciliation
talks starting Monday in Switzerland, and opponents of the
government said that cancellation ot the troop-withdrawal
agreement with Israel was only a first step toward bringing
peace to this country.
And, although there was some shooting along Beirut's
Green Line, an unofficial cease-fire generally appeared to
be holding in the Lebanese capital, giving rise to hope for at
least a break in the fighting that has gone on here lor more
than a month.
Government officials and leaders of anti-go\ ernment
factions confirmed yesterdav that a second round of na
tional reconciliation negotiations would be held in
Lausanne, Switzerland, beginning at l() a.m. Monday. The
key figures in Lebanese politics will bargain over a way to
redistribute political power in Lebanon.
The Lebanese Cabinet's abrogation Monday of the
troop-withdrawal and security agreement that was signed
with Israel last May 17 paved the way for a resumption of
the conference, the first round of which was held in Geneva
last November. Moslem and Druse groups here say they are
under-represented in Lebanon's government even though
they are a majority in the population. The president of
Lebanon, by unwritten law. is always a Maronite Christian.
Cancellation of the pact with Israel was a major goal of
neighboring Syria, which supports the Lebanese Druse and
Shia Moslem militiamen. It was the military victories by the
militiamen in Beirut and in the nearby mountains that
forced the government to abrogate the agreement.
Both Shia Moslem and Druse leaders said yesterday that
they were preparing the demands they will make at
Lausanne.
Vessey says military prepared
Washington — Gen. John Vessey, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a news conference yesterday
that the U.S. armed forces are readier and more capable
than they were three years ago.
Vessey said he was responding to news reports that the
combat-readiness of Army and Air Force units declined be
tween 1980 and 1953. While acknowledging that Pentagon
indexes show such a decline, Vessey said the measures are
"management tools" that do not reflect true military ca
pability.
"I would tell you that we have better people, they're
armed with more and better equipment, their training has
been improved and they have better support behind them."
Vessey said. "And that makes for a readier force."
Critics in Congress and even within the Pentagon have
suggested.that the Reagan administration is spending so
much for new military equipment that it will not have
enough for spare parts, ammunition, training time and
other readiness and sustainability accounts in the budget.
"When it comes to spending money on defense. Reagan
may be the trillion-dollar man," House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) said yesterday. "But when it
comes to actual combat-readiness, he has fallen behind."
Lawrence Korb, assistant secretary of defense for man
power, installations and logistics, said in a speech last fall
! that the military is in a "dangerously low sustainability
I posture."
l-.nrh sVrn/ Tuo&iiy tjjut the proposed l l >Ss ni<litui\
I .liiict of $305 billion goes a long way toward correcting
ih,n problem. Both Korb and Vessey said t/iat shortages
remain in spare parts and other stockpiles hut are less severe
than three years ago.
Kohl wants U.S.-Soviet meeting
Washington — West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said yesterday that he continues to advocate "an early
meeting" between President Reagan and Soviet Commu
nist Party leader Konstantin Chernenko. but he noted that
the stalemated nuclear arms talks and U.S. election-year
pressures make an early summit unlikely.
Kohl, who conferred with Reagan on Monday, told a Na
tional Press Club luncheon that a U.S Soviet summit would
be a "key part in a constructive East-West relationship."
He added: "President Reagan is a man ot strong and impres
sive character. I am sure that at such a meeting he would
succeed in convincing the Soviet Union ot the need to be
ready for peace and cooperation."
But the chancellor also sought to strike down speculation
that he is trying to act as a broker in arranging a summit.
He said: "My government does not regard itself as an inter
mediary or interpreter in this context, but as an advocate
of its own interests who is convinced that such a meeting
would be useful."
After their Monday meeting, Reagan reiterated his
longstanding view that a summit should be carefully
prepared in advance and give promise of "fruitful results"
such as announcement of a major arms control agreement.
Gandhi fears Pakistani troops
New Delhi — Congress-I Party leader Rajiv Gandhi said
yesterday that Pakistani troops close to India's border in
Kashmir could be readied for a full-scale invasion within
four days.
Gandhi added that recent maneuvers by the Pakistani
army in that border area had the theoretical objective of
achieving military control over the entire Kashmir valley,
including territory claimed by India.
"We are militarily prepared," said Gandhi, who is the son
of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and secretary
general of her ruling party. However, he added that Indian
troops were stationed much farther from the border than
the Pakistanis. "We don't want to escalate the situation
and cause further problems," he said in an interview.
Gandhi made headlines here about a month ago by charg
ing that Pakistan would invade India within a year, probably
near the city of Jammu in the state of Jammu and Kashmir
in northern India.
On the hopeful side, he said in the interview, is the recent
agreement by India and Pakistan to have their foreign min
isters resume talks in May on a no-war pact proposed by
Pakistan and a friendship treaty suggested b\ India as an al
ternative. "I hope this will defuse tension on the border,"
Gandhi said.

talks starting Monday in Switzerland, and opponents of the
government said that cancellation ot the troop-withdrawal
agreement with Israel was only a first step toward bringing
peace to this country.
And, although there was some shooting along Beirut's
Green Line, an unofficial cease-fire generally appeared to
be holding in the Lebanese capital, giving rise to hope for at
least a break in the fighting that has gone on here lor more
than a month.
Government officials and leaders of anti-go\ ernment
factions confirmed yesterdav that a second round of na
tional reconciliation negotiations would be held in
Lausanne, Switzerland, beginning at l() a.m. Monday. The
key figures in Lebanese politics will bargain over a way to
redistribute political power in Lebanon.
The Lebanese Cabinet's abrogation Monday of the
troop-withdrawal and security agreement that was signed
with Israel last May 17 paved the way for a resumption of
the conference, the first round of which was held in Geneva
last November. Moslem and Druse groups here say they are
under-represented in Lebanon's government even though
they are a majority in the population. The president of
Lebanon, by unwritten law. is always a Maronite Christian.
Cancellation of the pact with Israel was a major goal of
neighboring Syria, which supports the Lebanese Druse and
Shia Moslem militiamen. It was the military victories by the
militiamen in Beirut and in the nearby mountains that
forced the government to abrogate the agreement.
Both Shia Moslem and Druse leaders said yesterday that
they were preparing the demands they will make at
Lausanne.
Vessey says military prepared
Washington — Gen. John Vessey, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a news conference yesterday
that the U.S. armed forces are readier and more capable
than they were three years ago.
Vessey said he was responding to news reports that the
combat-readiness of Army and Air Force units declined be
tween 1980 and 1953. While acknowledging that Pentagon
indexes show such a decline, Vessey said the measures are
"management tools" that do not reflect true military ca
pability.
"I would tell you that we have better people, they're
armed with more and better equipment, their training has
been improved and they have better support behind them."
Vessey said. "And that makes for a readier force."
Critics in Congress and even within the Pentagon have
suggested.that the Reagan administration is spending so
much for new military equipment that it will not have
enough for spare parts, ammunition, training time and
other readiness and sustainability accounts in the budget.
"When it comes to spending money on defense. Reagan
may be the trillion-dollar man," House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) said yesterday. "But when it
comes to actual combat-readiness, he has fallen behind."
Lawrence Korb, assistant secretary of defense for man
power, installations and logistics, said in a speech last fall
! that the military is in a "dangerously low sustainability
I posture."

I .liiict of $305 billion goes a long way toward correcting

than three years ago.
Kohl wants U.S.-Soviet meeting
Washington — West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said yesterday that he continues to advocate "an early
meeting" between President Reagan and Soviet Commu
nist Party leader Konstantin Chernenko. but he noted that
the stalemated nuclear arms talks and U.S. election-year
pressures make an early summit unlikely.
Kohl, who conferred with Reagan on Monday, told a Na
tional Press Club luncheon that a U.S Soviet summit would
be a "key part in a constructive East-West relationship."
He added: "President Reagan is a man ot strong and impres
sive character. I am sure that at such a meeting he would
succeed in convincing the Soviet Union ot the need to be
ready for peace and cooperation."
But the chancellor also sought to strike down speculation
that he is trying to act as a broker in arranging a summit.
He said: "My government does not regard itself as an inter
mediary or interpreter in this context, but as an advocate
of its own interests who is convinced that such a meeting
would be useful."
After their Monday meeting, Reagan reiterated his
longstanding view that a summit should be carefully
prepared in advance and give promise of "fruitful results"
such as announcement of a major arms control agreement.
Gandhi fears Pakistani troops
New Delhi — Congress-I Party leader Rajiv Gandhi said
yesterday that Pakistani troops close to India's border in
Kashmir could be readied for a full-scale invasion within
four days.
Gandhi added that recent maneuvers by the Pakistani
army in that border area had the theoretical objective of
achieving military control over the entire Kashmir valley,
including territory claimed by India.
"We are militarily prepared," said Gandhi, who is the son
of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and secretary
general of her ruling party. However, he added that Indian
troops were stationed much farther from the border than
the Pakistanis. "We don't want to escalate the situation
and cause further problems," he said in an interview.
Gandhi made headlines here about a month ago by charg
ing that Pakistan would invade India within a year, probably
near the city of Jammu in the state of Jammu and Kashmir
in northern India.
On the hopeful side, he said in the interview, is the recent
agreement by India and Pakistan to have their foreign min
isters resume talks in May on a no-war pact proposed by
Pakistan and a friendship treaty suggested b\ India as an al
ternative. "I hope this will defuse tension on the border,"
Gandhi said.
