From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — A testy exchange in which House
Democrats attacked administration policy in El Sal
vador erupted into a shouting match yesterday as
Secretary of State George Shultz heatedly accused
Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.) of advocating that control
of the Central American nation be turned over to
Marxist guerrillas.
Both men's voices rose to top volume, so much so
that the bulk of the exchange was unintelligible. It
began when Obey, the second-ranking Democratic
member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee
on Foreign Operations, broke in during questioning by
Rep. Sidney Yates (D-lll.) at a subcommittee hearing
on the Kissinger commission's recommended $N billion
aid package to Central America.
Obey insisted that Shultz had distorted an earlier
statement bv Obey in which he criticized the Reagan

administration's refusal to consider negotiations that
could lead to the sharing of power in El Salvador with
the guerrillas.
The secretary. Ins face reddening, replied angrily:
"You are going to bring into power the people who
refuse to participate in the democratic process."
When Obey shouted that he only meant that
"negotiations across the board are needed on El Sal
vador's future," Shultz. gripping the edge of the
hearing room table, shot back: "What's the differ
ence?"
In a prelude to the tense scene. Yates and other
Democrats had joined in criticizing what they said was
Shultz's inability to improve the Salvadoran govern
ment's observance of human rights. Yates accused
the administration of seeking to continue U.S. aid to
El Salvador "from now until eternity" without any

visible change in the Salvadoran government s con
duct.
"I really don't understand you people, Shultz
declared, his temper beginning to rise.
-Here we have an area right next to the United
States that a bipartisan committee ot Americans has
said is vital to our interests. We have problems there,
and you say we ought to walk away from them.
After the exchange with Obey. Shult/ conceded
under questioning from Rep. Matthew McHugh (D-
N Y ) that the United States must be prepared to
cut off military aid to HI Salvador .1 the government
there cannot eventually convince the U.S. public that
it has an "appreciation tor the rule ot law. But he
said he believed that the installation of an elected
president and legislature later this month would help
to establish that confidence.
