# Senators divide on prayer amendment

From the Associated Press
Washington â€” As Senate debate over
a school prayer amendment droned on,
supporters of the proposal sought in
private negotiations yesterday to
resolve disputes whether a prayer
should be spoken or silent, and who
would compose or select a vocal prayer.
Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.) said lie would resist a
threat by amendment opponents to
delay a final vote until June. "I can't al
low the Senate to stay on it three
months," he said.
President Reagan kept up his drum
beat of calls for approval of a prayer
amendment, this time in a speech
before the National Association of
Evangelicals in Columbus, Ohio. An
other group of religious leaders met in
Washington to denounce the measure.
Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.) leads
a promised marathon floor debate
against any constitutional amendment

overriding Supreme Court decisions by
allowing officially sponsored prayers in
public schools.
He refuses to call the "extended
debate" a filibuster, but says a full
airing of the emotional issue might last
until the first of June. Baker says if the
Senate is still debating the measure
next week, he probably will move to
halt a talkathon.
Backers are seeking wider support by
trying to settle differences that have
produced three separate versions of the
proposal.
The amendment before the Senate,
supported by Reagan as an advocate of
vocal prayer, says: "Nothing in this
Constitution shall be construed to
prohibit individual or group prayer in
public schools or other public institu
tions. No person shall be required to
participate in prayer. Neither the
United States nor any state shall
compose the words of any prayer to be

said in public schools."
An alternative sponsored by Sen. Or
rin Hatch (R-Utah). which may be of
fered as an amendment to the
administration-backed proposal, would
allow silent prayer or meditation. A
third version sponsored by Baker would
permit vocal or silent prayer and not
prohibit government agencies from
drafting a prayer.
Baker interprets the Reagan-backed
amendment as meaning that school
boards could not write the prayer but
that students themselves could, said
Senate GOP leadership aides. Some
other supporters of the measure,
however, believe that school boards
could write the prayer.
"Obviously, if you get 10 or 12 dif
ferent interpretations, you aren't going
to get 67 votes," one aide said, refer
ring to the two-thirds majority re
quired for Senate approval of an
amendment.

Reagan said. "I'm convinced that pas
sage of this amendment would do more
than any other action to reassert the
faith and values that made America
great .... The Supreme Court declared
school prayer illegal" in 1^62.
The court said nothing about volun
tary prayers, but ruled unconstitutional
any school prayers or prayer sessions
that are officially organized, sponsored,
initiated or sanctioned. So far. the
justices have not ruled on such specific
questions as whether a moment ot
silence is permissible, or whether a
school can legally provide the space and
time for students to conduct voluntary
prayers.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.) told reporters that "I per
sonally am against prayers in the
schools." But if a prayer amendment
reaches the House floor, "I'm not going
to try to thwart it "
