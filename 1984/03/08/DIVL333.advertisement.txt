BECAUSE OF
CHEMOTHERAPY
KAREN
ANDERSON
IS A STATISTIC.
THE KIND OF
STATISTIC
WE LIKE TO
BRAG ABOUT.
When Karen was 18
years old, her doctor dis
covered she had a deadly
form of leukemia. Facing
incredible odds, Karen
spent three years in inten
sive chemotherapy.
Now, eight years and
two sons later, you'd never
suspect that she had bat
tled a disease that kills
more than 15,000 Amer
icans every year.
Your donations help us
continue the programs
that will give us more sta
tistics like Karen Ander
son. Statistics we can all
be proud of.
