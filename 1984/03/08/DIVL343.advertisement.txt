Real Time Career Propagation
If you're an Electronics, Mechanical, Industrial
Engineering or Computer Scientist graduate (or
about to become one), you've already invested a
good portion of your life learning the concepts
of your engineering specialty.
We put that investment to
work, real time. We research
underwater acoustic wave
)j| propagation for real
S/o) s y stems on m^es Â°112
underwater test ranges. We
evaluate the performance of
real propulsion systems
developing hundreds of horsepower in a space
the size of a breadbox. We analyze
sophisticated computerized control syst"ms for
reliability, maintainability, and perfom ince
under real extremes of shock, temperature,
foreign environments, and repeated usage.
We're the Naval Undersea Warfare
Engineering Station, and we offer motivated
people like yourself the opportunity for real
time career propagation. Competitive
compensation. Excellent benefits. A rural
environment, a ferry ride from Seattle. If you're
looking to put that interest of yours to the test
in the leading edge of engineering technology,
we're looking for you.
