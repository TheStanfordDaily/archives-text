# Statue moved after vandalism
## 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
The recently vandalized "Gay Liberation" sculpture
was removed from its site near the Math corner yester
day, and University officials were uncertain whether the
sculpture will be reinstalled here after its repair.
"The fate of the cast will be determined by the
owner," said Art History Prof. Albert Elsen. The
sculpture is on indefinite loan from the Mildred
Andrews Fund until it is approved for installation in the
Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco.
A vandal hit the sculpture with a hammer at least 40
times Tuesday night causing a large amount of damage
to the sculpture, which has an estimated value of
$150,000
Members of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) placed flowers on the former site of the
sculpture to protest the vandal's actions. An attached
sign asked community members to place flowers on the
site "to protest this act of homophobic violence." By
4:30 p.m. yesterday, about seven large bunches and 75 in
dividual jjuwers had been placed on the. site,
Jeff Williams, spokesman for GLAS, said he thinks all

students will respond with anger to the vandalism but
said it is even more upsetting for members of the lesbian
and gay community. "We did identify with those fig
ures," he said. "They were like people to us and now
they've been killed."
The chairman of the outdoor art panel, Law Prof.
John Merryman, said he hoped the vandal was not a
Stanford student. "I would be very disappointed if he
were," he said.
"Up to the time this occurred, I thought the recep
tion of the sculpture had been very good. Very few
people were troubled by the theme and I had the impres
sion that Stanford was looking good," Merryman said.
Merryman said the outdoor art panel had discussed the
possibility of vandalism before deciding to accept the
sculpture but that "the University and panel of outdoor
art have never thought that the University panel should
be controlled by vandals."
Elsen, who examined the sculpture after the damage,
would make no dollar estimates but described the

damage as "serious but repairable."
He said the approximately 40 blows
to the work appeared to have been
done by a ballpeen hammer. All the
blows caused damage to the white
patina (the treated surface of the
bronze) and several blows damaged
the bronze underneath.
Elsen said the estimates of damage
given by art doctoral candidate and
GI.AS steering committee member
Gerard Koskovich in a Daily article
yesterday — $50.000 — were incor
rect. "He is not competent to give
that information," Elsen said.
Artist George Segal said the inci
dent was "unfortunate. No matter
how strong the feelings are . . . the
response should be civilized on every
one's part. There's no need for
opinions to be expressed so
violently."
A second casting of the sculpture
is part of a traveling exhibition. Segal
said he received no reports of

vandalism or threats of vandalism
against the work.
According to Director of Risk
Management Robert Beth, it is un
certain who will pay for the repair of
the sculpture. "An agreement was
being prepared with the Mildred
Andrews Foundation," he said, "but
it is unclear whether we had assumed
the risk or whether the foundation
had."
Beth said the University itself
insures its works of art. "We set
aside reserves to cover our losses," he
said. "We have outside policies to
cover catastrophic losses, but for
more routine things we assume the
risks ourselves." If the University
must pay for the repair of the
sculpture, Beth said the money will
come out of the self-insurance
reserve fund.
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said there is "nothing new" in the
police investigation of the case. He
said the police conducted an ex
tended search for the hammer but
did not find anything. No suspects
have been reported, he said.
