The recently vandalized "Gay Liberation" sculpture
was removed from its site near the Math corner yester
day, and University officials were uncertain whether the
sculpture will be reinstalled here after its repair.
"The fate of the cast will be determined by the
owner," said Art History Prof. Albert Elsen. The
sculpture is on indefinite loan from the Mildred
Andrews Fund until it is approved for installation in the
Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco.
A vandal hit the sculpture with a hammer at least 40
times Tuesday night causing a large amount of damage
to the sculpture, which has an estimated value of
$150,000
Members of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) placed flowers on the former site of the
sculpture to protest the vandal's actions. An attached
sign asked community members to place flowers on the
site "to protest this act of homophobic violence." By
4:30 p.m. yesterday, about seven large bunches and 75 in
dividual jjuwers had been placed on the. site,
Jeff Williams, spokesman for GLAS, said he thinks all

students will respond with anger to the vandalism but
said it is even more upsetting for members of the lesbian
and gay community. "We did identify with those fig
ures," he said. "They were like people to us and now
they've been killed."
The chairman of the outdoor art panel, Law Prof.
John Merryman, said he hoped the vandal was not a
Stanford student. "I would be very disappointed if he
were," he said.
"Up to the time this occurred, I thought the recep
tion of the sculpture had been very good. Very few
people were troubled by the theme and I had the impres
sion that Stanford was looking good," Merryman said.
Merryman said the outdoor art panel had discussed the
possibility of vandalism before deciding to accept the
sculpture but that "the University and panel of outdoor
art have never thought that the University panel should
be controlled by vandals."
Elsen, who examined the sculpture after the damage,
would make no dollar estimates but described the
