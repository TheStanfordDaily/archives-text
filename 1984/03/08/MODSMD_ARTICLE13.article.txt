						Stanford Daily He's free, we're not

When Theodore Streleski is released from the
Vacaville Medical Facility this morning, there
will be many nervous people in the Stanford
community. We can only hope that the parole
arrangement is successful in keeping Streleski
away from Stanford and in minimizing the
nightmarish quality of the entire case.
Since Aug. IS. 1978, when Streleski beat to
death Mathematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw, the
case has sent grief, anger and fear throughout
the campus and community. The case has been a
story of disappointments, from the grisly mur
der to the unreasonably short five-and-a-half
year term to the state's inability to keep
Streleski in prison.
The only positive news was that the original
plan to parole Streleski in San Francisco was
rejected. Thanks to efforts by state law offi
cials, Streleski will be paroled in the city of Or
ange in Orange County. He will not be
permitted in Santa Clara County or neighboring
San Mateo, San Francisco or Alameda counties.
These restrictions are a relief, and should serve
to calm the fears of many at Stanford.

Nevertheless, the parole arrangement is not a
complete guarantee 01 keeping Streleski away,
and it is unnerving that today he is a free man.
Despite efforts by local, University and state
officials to keep Streleski in prison, there was
no preventing his release once he was cleared by
psychiatrists.
The problem throughout has been the laws on
the books. "The criminal justice system, in view
of the statements Streleski has made, is obvi
ously not working right," said the city manager
of Orange, whose town is stuck with Streleski.
Added California's Assistant Attorney General
Steve White: "One thing that has developed is
that maybe there is a gap in the law."
That gap is unfortunate, and changes should
be considered. The mandatory minimum sen
tence for second-degree murder has already
been extended to 15 years, but some special
provisions may he needed in cases where the
murderer remains "noncommittal" about whe
ther he will kill again. It is unfair to have people
here fearful of Streleski's intentions, while
Streleski himself goes free.
