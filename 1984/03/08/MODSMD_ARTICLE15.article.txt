# It's not that hard to live to be 110 if you avoid fats

It seems as though everybody dies
of heart attacks these days. Not
that it's fashionable or anything,
though there are some who delight in
sporting their chest-mounted coro
nary bypass scars. Actually, it should
seem as though everybody's dying
from heart attacks according to sta
tistics: Half the people who die in
the United States are victims of
some circulatory disease, whether it
be a heart attack or a stroke or some
other disorder.
Why do you suppose it is that half
the Americans who die today will die
from a circulatory disease when vir
tually no one will die from one in, say,
an Ecuadoran village? It's not that
people don't die in primitive com
munities like those in Ecuador, just
that they almost never die of heart
attacks or strokes. They seem
immune from the very ailments that
kill half the people who die in

America every day.
How can this be?
Is it because these primitives have
special genes that keep them from
developing these maladies? Hardly.
Do they exercise more? Maybe, but
that isn't the reason. Could their
diets be protecting them from
disease? Bingo.
Almost half of all Americans are
dying because Americans eat some of
the worst food that human beings
can eat. Primitives around the world
live long (as in 110 years) and healthy
lives free from circulatory disease be
cause they've quite by chance
stumbled upon diets close to the
ideal for the human body — an ideal
from which ours is far removed.
How do we know these diets are
nearly optimal? We know because
they've yielded astounding results. In

uncontrived natural village experi
ments around the world that have
been going on for centuries, many
natives live for more than 100
healthy and active years, free from
debilitating diseases and incapacita
tion we associate with our "elderly"
of 70 and over. Who needs a fountain
of youth? If you've got a lifetime
supply of veggies and grain (that's
1 10 years worth) you've got it made.
That's what these people eat.
Veggies and grains. And they live for
more than a century. They don't in
gest outrageous amounts of fat and
sugar like Americans do. Less than 15
percent of their calories come from
fat and almost none from sugar.
How does the "average" American
eater compare? Chances are you're
getting 40 to 50 percent of your
.calories from fat every day. That's 30
to 40 percent too much to stay

healthy. No trieu cmc Ken percent
fat) or eggs (60 percent fat) for Mr.
Villager. To him they're poison.
Gravy (80 percent fat)? No better
than hemlock. How about butter
(100 percent fat)? Might as well be
arsenic. You get the picture. Get a
hold of a food-value chart and see
how much fat you're eating in com
parison with the vascularly healthy
of the world. It'll turn your stomach.
Now don't get me wrong. To eat
healthfully doesn't mean living on
raw cabbage and carrots. We're
people, not rabbits. You'd be amazed
at the recipes chefs have concocted
that are genuinely tasty yet health
ful. But be careful of fatty dishes
that masquerade as being good for
you. Watch out especially for the
vegetarian dishes at Food Service.
Just because they're meatless doesn't
mean they're not laden with fat —
beware of what service nutritionists

love to can "casseroles." I hey re
usually full of cheese or gravy ol
some sort.
Next time you slop on the gravy or
dish lip the ice cream picture your ar
teries closing little by little. Ath
erosclerosis (gradual closing of the
arteries from plaque buildup) isn't
something you catch. It's not like
cancer. It builds up from those first
chunks of meat and cheese, those
first eggs and that first bowl of Cap
tain Crunch we eat as children. The
• best we can do is halt its progress and
hope for a little regression.
There isn't any hocus pocus to a
healthy long life. It's just sensible
eating, plain and simple. For specifics
about what I've been talking about,
read a book by Nathan Pritikin some
time. He's the one who founded the
Longevity Center in Santa Barbara
— the place where people who doc
tors give a month to live go because

tney want to survive. From Pritikin
they get a new lease on life. All he
does is teach them how to eat and
tell them to exercise. And it works.
Don't get the idea from all this
that it's too late and you're doomed
because it's not and you're not. Ath
erosclerosis can't progress without
your help. If your veins are only 20
percent closed right now by plaques,
keep them that way by cutting out
fat (both saturated and un
saturated) and exercising. Vou can
still live to be 100 and play a mean
game of tennis at 99.
