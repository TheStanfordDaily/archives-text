## United States should reconsider pull out from UNESCO 
### 
The United Nations Educational, Security and Cul
tural Organization (UNESCO), it seems, has become the
latest battleground for ideologues seeking territory in
which to sink their flags. The U.S. decision to withdraw
from this international forum has led critics and sup
porters alike to reduce the problem to an East-West, a
North-South, or a Third World-First World issue. It is a
dangerous mistake to see the complexities of U.S.-

VIEWPOINT

UNESCO relations in such narrow terms, not only for
the future of this international agency, but also for the
future of the United States within an international sys
tem.
Stanford Daily columnist Jason Matherly recently
released a sample of this bitter rhetoric in his column
(Feb. 23) "UNESCO pull out overdue." Matherly
describes UNESCO activities as "the ideological
crucifixion of the West by enemies of freedom in
UNESCO." It is a tragic perspective he presents, laden
with deep misunderstandings of what UNESCO and cur
rent debate are really about.
The reputation which Matherly imposes on UNESCO
and the Third World is precisely the attitude which many
smaller nations have been attempting to redirect
through the UNESCO forum. His interpretation of
UNESCO as the "new anti-West Soviet bloc/Third
World majority alliance" is a gross error of simplifica

tion. as well as a paranoid labelling of an intricate system
of alliances.
The Third World is a term applied to more than 100
nations occupying more than a third of the globe. There
is as much diversity among and within these nations as
iheir scope would imply. There are communist and
socialist nations, and there are at least as many nations
of capitalist and free market economies. It is impossible
to speak of the Third World as a single entity and equally
impossible to claim that the entire Third World is joined
in some sort of communist conspiracy against the United
States.
Matherly uses the same evasive accusations of Soviet
imperialism so often used by the Reagan administration.
According to this perspective, the Soviet Union is the
aggressor, the Third World is the victim, and the United
States is the herald of justice.
Matherly's view of the Soviet Union as "exploiting
the predicaments of the emerging Third World nations"
overlooks the real power of decision which the Third
World nations hold within international organizations.
In using the Soviet scapegoat to excuse Third World
defiance to the United States, Matherly denies that
Third World opposition is based on any legitimate com
plaints.
The Reagan administration has cited the politicization
of UNESCO as a reason for withdrawal. This is an odd
claim considering the clearly political complaints which
the United States holds over this international forum.
It is clearly not the politicization itself which the

Reagan administration objects to, but the challenge it
presents to U.S. supremacy in international decision
making.
A primary criticism of UNESCO has focused on the
debate over the new international information order.
This point has been the crux of misunderstanding be
tween First World ideologues and their Third World
counterparts.
Since the mid-1970s UNESCO has, among many other
issues, considered the unequal control of information in
dustries and the one-way flow of information from the
First World to the rest of the globe. This imbalance,
many contend, puts the power of interpretation and
analysis into the hands of a select few, causing a
profound misunderstanding and alienation of the devel
oping world.
UNESCO has looked at the possible means by which
this imbalance might be controlled, one of which was the
possibility of requiring qualifications of journalists. This
was not, however, the only proposal. Other measures in
cluded regional training centers, formation of alterna
tive news services, and more equal distribution of radio
and satellite frequencies.
Those who oppose UNESCO have adopted the con
cept (and it is nothing more than a concept) of licensing
of journalists as the so'e objective of the new interna
tional information order. Worse yet, UNESCO itself is
seen only in terms of (his debate. This perspective misin
terprets the central issues of discussion and overlooks
the many other international activities which UNESCO

sponsors.
The Reagan administration's reasons for withdrawal
are clearly based on political, rather than technical, con
siderations. The administration's complaint is that
Third World UNESCO members are instigating an
ideological blockade, backed by the Soviet Union,
against the United States. In the general sessions of
UNESCO, the United States is often outvoted by
strong consolidation of opposing votes.
The United States has responded extremely illogically
to this opposition. If it is true that the Third World
vote is consistently contrary to the United State,
(which I believe is not the case. In the last general session
of UNESCO, more than 95 percent of the resolutions
passed with the support of the U.S. vote.), then doesn't
that imply that the United States is perhaps approach
ing international issues with little to offer and little wil
lingness to compromise?
The current administration holds the stated objective
of consolidating and maintaining U.S. supremacy on the
globe. Its tactics are to pressure and threaten smaller na
tions through economic and political sanctions. These
methods are doomed to failure. In setting ideological
standards for international cooperation, the United
States will drive the gap between the developed and the
less-developed world even deeper. On a planet that is
already so extremely volatile, it is frightening to think
we may lose one of our last forums for dialogue because
of an immature attitude by the United States.
