## Manley/Rebholz petition: nothing new 
### 
The issues raised by Professors John Manley
and Ronald Rebholz in their most recent Stan
ford Daily viewpoint (March 2) add very little to
the arguments they developed a year ago. when
they helped launch the petition drive for an in
quiry into Hoover's ties with Stanford.
The Faculty Senate, though it approved a
resolution asking for an inquiry by the Board of
Trustees on the issue of governance, wiselv

VIEWPOINT

omitted the issue of Hoover's alleged political
partisanship and for reasons that should be fairly
obvious.
112 irst, whatever political advocacy can be found
at Hoover is written and published by Hoover's
fellows. If. as Manley and Rebholz claim, public
opinion is influenced by editorials sent out from
Hoover, it is by editorials which individual fellows
freely choose to write. I myself have written a
goodly batch, most of them placed by myself
through my own editorial contacts. To charac
terize the editorials we write as "Hoover essays"
makes no more sense than to describe the op-eds
written by Manley as "Stanford Political Science
Department essays."
Another point. Even assuming that Manley
and Rebholz had somehow managed to locate a
"smoking gun" that would have established a
prima facie case for an inquiry into alleged offi
cial partisanship by Hoover, no inquiry of Hoover
would have been possible without extending it to
other Stanford centers and departments. Indeed,
their petition drive became tainted by their own
hand as they sought to develop arguments that

would restrict the inquiry to Hoover alone,
thereby revealing the partisan motivations be
hind the petition drive that many had suspected
all along. When their effort to substantiate offi
cial partisanship by Hoover appeared to flag,
they cut a dangerous corner by arguing that
Hoover could still be considered partisan even if
it had not been found to have taken any official
political position. Logically, that requires that
Hoover be assumed to be "conservative" simply
because of the views Manley and Rebholz have
attributed to its fellows. Unfortunately, much
of the press continues to perpetrate this error of
logic when it refers to Hoover as a "leading con
servative think tank."
And a third point. Though the original petition
of last spring appeared non-partisan on its face
since it expressly stated that any finding of par
tisanship. no matter whether liberal or conserva
tive, could be considered a threat to the
University's commitment to political neutrality,
Manley explained to his colleagues in the Faculty
Senate last year that the partisanship of other
Stanford centers was not objectionable because
it was part of the University's normal pluralism.
Forgive me if I appear too cynical and prefer a
different explanation. Could it not be that Man
ley exempted other centers and departments be
cause their advocacy nourished rather than gored
the Farm's liberal oxen?
Finally, lest we neglect any hypocrisy large or
small, some of the faculty who boarded last
year's petition drive against Hoover appear to
have no objection to an official partisan stance
by the University on issues involving our nation's
defense. Thus, some would be delighted to see re

strict ions placed on scientific research that
might he useful to our national defense. If im
plemented, this would be as genuinely partisan a
policy as was the decision 10 years ago to drop
ROTC. That was done because some faculty and
students wanted to punish the military for its in
volvement in Vietnam. The issue of academic
governance provided the necessary camouflage to
cover Stanford's political tracks.
Rebholz, along with 10 other faculty signers of
the Hoover petition, also saw fit 13 years ago to
affirm that the University could take an official
partisan position on certain issues. In a brief
written in defense of Professor Bruce Franklin, a
professor who was dismissed for behavior creat
ing a hazard of violence (incitement to riot),
they reasoned that on questions "which are es
sentially educational but which have political im
plications . . . the University cannot remain
neutral if it is to remain faithful to the prin
ciples that justify its existence." Although one
has to cut through some murky phrasing to get
to the point, it appears they were referring to
"war-related research" and "recruitment by the
military and military contractors" on campus.
I made these points in campus publications
during the controversy last year. I had hoped to
be spared having to trot them out again. One
begins to tire of the double-standard that one
finds at Stanford and which has been tolerated
on campus ever since the Vietnam protest era.
Hut one must never tire of the duty to hold the
torch of reason against this double-standard and
to affirm the consistent application of principle
in matters relating to academic freedom.
