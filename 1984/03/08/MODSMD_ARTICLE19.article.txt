# Hoopsters go on Duck hunt

### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
For the first time in 23 years, the number
20 means something other than the number
of losses for the Stanford basketball team.
The Cardinal, 19-11, 8-9 in the Pacific-10
Conference, will be going for its 20th victory
tonight against the Oregon Ducks at McAr
thur Court.
Tonight's game, the last of the regular
season for Stanford, could also play a role in
Stanford's chances for selection in the Na
tional Invitation Tournament (NIT). The
game is also important for Oregon which is
hoping to be selected to the NCAA Tourna
ment. The Ducks are currently tied with
UCLA for third in the conference with a 9-7
Pac-10 record. Oregon is just 14-12 overall,
but the Ducks have played a tough non

conference schedule.
While some observers feel that 20 victories
would be a definite boost to Stanford's NIT
chances. Athletic Director Andy Geiger does
not feel that it is the critical variable, al
though he admitted that a 20-win season
would be a definite boost for the program.
"I think it's an important game for Stan
ford baksetball but I'm not so sure how im
portant it is for our NIT chances," Geiger
said. "I've talked with the executive director
of the NIT and they like us, but there are a
lot of other variables."
Like Geiger, Stanford Coach Tom Davis
said he feels that the Oregon game is impor
tant, but not because of its bearings on the
NIT. "It's an important game because it

Davis said. "It would be great
to win against a good team like
Oregon. We've beaten all the
other top teams except for
Oregon State.
"There are 40 or 50 teams

desirability, media attention
and what we'd be able to draw
both at home and on the
road."
Stanford lost to Oregon, 79-
78, earlier this year at Maples
Pavilion. In that game, the
Ducks shot .688 from the field
(31 -of-45) and shot an amazing
.809 in the second half. Even
so, Stanford had a chance to
win the game. With just 15

second;* left and the Cardinal
down by one, Stanford guard
Keith Ramee had a pass inter
cepted In Duck guard Chris
Harper who was subsequently
fouled and converted both
ends of a 1-and-l. Stanford
cut the gap back to one when
guard John Pave made a layup
with three seconds left.
Oregon is led by 7-foot cen
ter Blair Rasmussen who is
averaging 16.3 points and 5.6
rebounds a game. Harper, a 6-2
junior college transfer, is
second on the team in scoring,
averaging 11.2 points a game.
The other starters are 6-6
senior forward David Brantley
(10.2 points per game), 6-7
junior forward Mike Matheson
and 6-3 guard Gary Gatewood.
Greg Trapp. a 6-7 junior for
