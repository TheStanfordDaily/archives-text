# USW protests Commissary shutdown

### SHIRISH DATE Daily staff 
Officials of the United Stanford Workers
(USW) are protesting the University's prelim
inary decision to close the Stanford Commis
sary and are accusing University management
of deliberately attempting to undercut the
union's strength and bargaining position.
University management claims that it is
closing the Commissary because it is losing
money. The Commissary was designed to be a
non-profit cooperative that would serve as an
intermediary between food suppliers and
campus residences. Ihe Commissary's
cumulative loss as of August 1983 was
$135,728.
University management blames the finan
cial losses on the impracticality of such an in
termediary. Jack Albrecht, associate director
of facilities and services, said, "there are
strong indications that a commissary opera
tion is no longer a viable way to do business."
Union leaders blame the losses on manage
ment. Luis Silvestre, a USW executive board

member and a Commissary worker, says that
under the previous manager, the Commissary
broke even — like it was supposed to. But, ac
cording to Silvestre, the Commissary has been
losing money ever since the change in manage
ment two and a half years ago.
Silvestre says that shipments are ordered in
improper quantities and irregular intervals so
that a reasonable stock is impossible to main
tain. In addition, he blames improper mainte
nance. The Commissary has a 13-year-old
delivery truck that he says takes about 15
minutes to start. Trucks are supposed to be
replaced every five years, he said.
Commissary crew members offered two ex
planations for why the manager wasn't
replaced. Either, they said, upper management
is embarrassed about the appointment, or
they intentionally allowed the Commissary to
lose money so they could justify shutting it
down.
USW President Linda Crouse believes the
second explanation is more plausible. Crouse
points outs that eight union members are

employed at the Commissary — four of them
belong to United Food and Commercial
Workers, local 115, while the other four are
part of the USW bargaining unit.
Crouse calls the closing of the Commissary
an outright attempt "to take work away
from our union."
"Under our contract, work cannot be con
tracted out to non-bargaining unit workers to
the extent that it causes layoffs to bargaining
unit workers," Crouse said.
Despite Vice President for Business and
Finance William Massy's assurance that the
University would meet its "contractual
obligations with the respective unions" and
make efforts to "identify alternative work,"
Crouse remained adamant.
"By transfering workers around like that,
they erode our bargaining unit," Crouse said.
She said that regardless of whether the four
Commissary workers were laid off or trans
ferred to openings in other areas, or whether
