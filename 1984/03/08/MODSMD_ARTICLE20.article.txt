## Stanford soccer coaches fired 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Stanford men's soccer Coach Nelson
Lodge and Assistant Coach Tony Igwe will
not be reappointed to their positions,
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said last
night.
Lodge and Igwe coach under one-year
contracts which will not he renewed.
"Neither Nelson Lodge nor Tony Igtve will
be reappointed," Geiger said.
Geiger told Lodge of the decision yes
terday afternoon. Geiger said the Athletic
Department will "conduct searches (to fill
the positions) as soon as possible."
In a phone interview with The Daily,
Geiger gave two reasons for firing Lodge
and Igwe.
"It's because of the re-establishment of
the program at another level, and I think a
change is needed," Geiger said. "It's in the
best interests of both programs."
Next season, both men's and women's
soccer teams will play as Varsity II level
sports under the Athletic Department's
recent realignment.
Lodge, whose teams have compiled a 96-
53-12 record since his arrival in 1976, said
he is "seeing my lawyer" this morning. He
declined to comment further about con
sulting legal advice, but admitted he was
surprised to learn of his firing.
"After seven seasons of doing nothing
but winning and beating the best!" Lodge
exclaimed. "We beat Connecticut when
they won the national championship."
Last fall, the Cardinal was 12-5-3 and 3-3
in the Pacific Soccer Conference.

Nelson Lodge, the head coach of the soccer team, will no longer guide the Car
dinal soccer program. He, along with his assistant and women's Head Coach
Tony Igwe, were released from their posts last week. Stanford had compiled a
record of 96-53-12 during Lodge's eight-year reign.
~ However, sophomore team member Tom
__ Rafalovich said Lodge's status had been
•" "questionable" for approximately a
• month.
"I had heard rumors about the fact that
he was out," Rafalovich said. "1 heard Igwe
was fired a couple of days ago."
• Rafalovich said most of the players feel
the team could have had a better record
: under another coach. According to
many of the players told
jj- Geiger their concerns. Geiger then called
— some players into his office and discussed
the situation with them.
~ "It ended up that almost everyone (on
:£the team) went in." Rafalovich said.
""Some went in and some called (Geiger).
— Not too man\ wanted him (Lodge) in."
"We'\e cot the talent to do a lot bet

ter." Rafalovich said. "This year there
were a fair amount of games we should
have won. The coaching was not up to the
ability of the team."
Lodge said his dismissal probabb would
mark the end of his coaching career, adding
that Igwe faced "implications" which
could make it difficult for himself.
Igwe, one of two assistant coaches, was
not available for comment. He came to
Stanford in 1980 after graduating from
the University of San Francisco. He also
coached the women's club soccer team.
Neither Lodge nor Bob Vazquez, the co
sports information director, knew the
status of Ron Smare, who has been an as
sistant coach for two seasons.
Under Lodge, Stanford did not have any
losing seasons, and the Cardinal's best
finish under Lodge was in 1 C >7S when it ad
vanced to the NCAA regional playoffs.
Stanford was 14-5-2 in 1^79.
