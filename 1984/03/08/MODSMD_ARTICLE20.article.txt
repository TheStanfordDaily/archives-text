## Stanford soccer coaches fired 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Stanford men's soccer Coach Nelson
Lodge and Assistant Coach Tony Igwe will
not be reappointed to their positions,
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said last
night.
Lodge and Igwe coach under one-year
contracts which will not he renewed.
"Neither Nelson Lodge nor Tony Igtve will
be reappointed," Geiger said.
Geiger told Lodge of the decision yes
terday afternoon. Geiger said the Athletic
Department will "conduct searches (to fill
the positions) as soon as possible."
In a phone interview with The Daily,
Geiger gave two reasons for firing Lodge
and Igwe.
"It's because of the re-establishment of
the program at another level, and I think a
change is needed," Geiger said. "It's in the
best interests of both programs."
Next season, both men's and women's
soccer teams will play as Varsity II level
sports under the Athletic Department's
recent realignment.
Lodge, whose teams have compiled a 96-
53-12 record since his arrival in 1976, said
he is "seeing my lawyer" this morning. He
declined to comment further about con
sulting legal advice, but admitted he was
surprised to learn of his firing.
"After seven seasons of doing nothing
but winning and beating the best!" Lodge
exclaimed. "We beat Connecticut when
they won the national championship."
Last fall, the Cardinal was 12-5-3 and 3-3
in the Pacific Soccer Conference.
