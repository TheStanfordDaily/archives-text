## Polo: increasing horsepower 
### ROB KEELEY 
Heather Vandeweghe
allots two or three after
noons per week to teaching
polo. She cleans mucky
stalls, patches aged saddles,
doctors tender hooves and
drags herself out of bed at
the break of dawn to feed
eight hungry horses.
And Vandeweghe is just
one of a number of individ
uals who make vital com
mitments to the four
year-old Stanford polo
club.
Hob Ginesman, the club's
coach, said. "For every hour
of actual play, many club
members will spend five
hours or more training the
horses, cleaning (the stalls)
and the like."
Freshman rider Karen An
derson doesn't mind the
commitment. "1 like to ride
and 1 enjoy polo. The work is
well worth the reward.
Besides, I can wear my polo
shirts without feeling like a
hypocrite," she said.
Another freshman, Barry
Porter, is working toward
next year's intercollegiate
finals. He said, "The fresh
men have come a long way in
a short time period. The
weekend practice matches
are paying off."
But members of the team
have not always had the
chance to play on the

weekends. In fact, senior
Marian Menninger said,
"During the club's first year
(1980) we worked real hard
and played rarely. We were
not real organized, we were
new to the task of funding
(ourselves) and we had trou
ble finding suitable horses."
Except for a couple of
management hassles, the
second year went much
smoother than the first
year. The club started a
mailing campaign and
outside interests donated
three valuable polo ponies.
By the third year, the
club had 15 members, held
regular matches on Satur
days and received instruc
tion from a new coach —
Ginesman.
According to Arturo
Farias, a former president
of the club, the clinic was an
important development.
"Essentially, the clinic
meant recognition for the
Stanford polo program in
the East and in the West,"
Farias said. "Not long there
after. we were invited to
the intercollegiate cham
pionships, which hosts the
best college polo teams in
the country."
A women's team, consist
ing of Menninger, Neenie
Blake and Jennifer Cot
teleer traveled to Griffith
Park Ei|uidome in l.os An

geles for the women's inter
eollegiate championships
last April. In single elimina
tion play, Stanford hit the
first goal in its opening
match against an experi
enced University of Virginia
team. But the young Stan
ford team was unac
customed to indoor tactics
and eventually lost the
game to an overpowering
Virginia offense.
With a year of experience
behind them, the women
plan on making a better
showing in the Los Angeles
championship event.
The men did not field a
team last year. Nor will they
field a team this year, due
to a lack of experienced un
dergraduates.
Stanford graduate stu
dent Julio Batista, a former
captain of the Yale Univer
sity polo team, watched the
preseason opener last
weekend with interest. He
predicted that next year
the men should make a good
showing, after they have
gained valuable experience.
Batista said, "On a per
sonnel level, the team has po
tential. Everyone is gung-ho
and the coach is excellent.
These two factors are im
portant in building a strong
team."
Only time will tell for
Stanford's polo club.
