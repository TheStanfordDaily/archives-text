## 'Seeing Red' lights up corners but raises few conflicts 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Seeing Red has such a compelling,
underexposed subject — the men and
women who belonged to the Ameri
can Communist Party in the 19305,
'40s and '50s — and such a vivifying
cast of characters, that it's an ex
hilarating experience, even if it isn't
a very good documentary. You've
never seen such a genial mess of
faces. Bill Bailey, seaman and
longshoreman, has deep azure eyes
and a swollen bottle stopper of a
nose; when he recounts the beefs
that provoked him into joining the
party, he relives all his old battles,
sparring with his voice and his hands.
Gentle-eyed, sweet-toned Oscar
Hunter describes the action he saw in
the Spanish Civil War, burying his
emotion in carefully sculpted pauses
between phrases. Sylvia Woods, a big,
straightforward black woman with
indignant fury in her voice, tells how
she sent a pair of FBI agents packing,
warning them that white men
weren't safe walking through her
neighborhood after dark. A shrill,
head-tossing steel mill worker, Rose
Podmaka, says she got into the party
because they needed someone to
take minutes and collect dues — they
weren't actually recruiting women at
the time. Howard "Stretch"
Johnson, a veteran dancer from the
Cotton Club days who now teaches
college, lets his loose, jovial side leak
through his precise, oratorical class
room manner as he talks about the
need to relax even when you're
working 18 hours a day — especially
if you believe, as a good communist
does, that life on earth was meant to
be lived fully.
One is struck repeatedly by the
way passion and articulateness co
exist in these people's speech; you
can see their training — the years of
endless argument and organization —
in the shape of their commentary.
Dorothy Healey, who joined at the
age of 14, explains the joys of com
mitment to an immense cause:
"There was absolutely no question in
your mind who you were and what
you were and why you were. You had
that answered." Marge Frantz, a
soft-spoken woman of unmistakable
intelligence, explains the possibility
of dual loyalty — that if you were a
true believer, you held up the shining
example of Russia as an inspiration
for your own country to follow.
Their explanations are spiked with
anecdotes — humorous ones like
Edna Whitehouse's about the embar

rassment she felt when she saw her
husband getting up to speak in
public, potent ones like writer Carl
Hirsch's stories, passed on to his wife
in letters while he was covering a
sharecroppers' strike for a commu
nist paper, of the atrocities commit
ted against the families he had come
to know.
Being confronted with so many
fascinating camera subjects and so
many resonant issues — why the ac
tivities of the party were kept clan
destine; how political and social life
intermingled for party members; how
the violent impulses of men and wo
men whose loyalty to the organiza
tion forbade them to defend
themselves against cops, got
translated into military aggression in
the Spanish Civil War; the contusion
and bitterness of American commu
nists when Kruschev revealed the
horrors of the Stalinist purges in
1956 — the filmmakers, Julia Reich
ert and James Klein, are so over
whelmed that they don't do much;
they just sit back and drink it all in.
They are obviously in sympathy with
the interviewees — so much so that
they've made no apparent effort to
challenge them, by either word or
deed. So we meet only those commu
nists who stayed in the party even
after the Kruschev report or who
remained close to the socialist ideals
of their youth even after leaving the
organization. Yet thousands of
Americans who had joined the ranks
during the Depression swung
dramatically to the right during the
Cold War, and of the 80 percent of
the party membership who resigned
in or shortly after 1956, some of
them must have experienced such dis
illusionment that they altered their
politics significantly. (The radical
youth who settles into conservatism
in his middle years is the rule, not the
exception, in this country — look at
the activists of the '605.) But the
closest Reichert and Klein come to
unearthing a dissenter is the segment
in which Carl Hirsch claims he looks
back on his days in the party as just a
phase he went through — and when
Hirsch reads those letters out loud,
he has to choke back incipient tears.
Reichert, who conducts the inter
views, asks no embarrassing ques
tions; she's a devoted listener, not a
journalist. And remarkably few con
flicts are raised, considering the in
cendiary subject matter. Marge
Frantz and Edna Whitehouse ad
dress, peripherally, the contradiction

between the querying nature of
young people inclined to join such a
renegade cause and the rigidity of
the centralized, bureaucratic organi
zation promulgating the constant
questioning of other institutions.
But neither the interviewer nor the
interviewees suggest any other
reasons; for uneasiness. Though we
are shown samples of grotesque anti
communist propaganda disseminated
by the FBI, no one questions the
morality of distributing Communist
Party propaganda. And there's an un
persuasive segment in which several
of the people we've met, notably
Dorothy Healey, insist that the FBI
charges of espionage among party
members were not merely erroneous
but laughable — and not another
word is said about it. Very likely
Healey and Bill Bailey and the others

in the film never had any connection
with spies or spying — what secrets
could they have offered to the
Soviets? — but in the last few years,
political analysts and biographers
have tended to give greater credence
to the documents implicating certain
other leftists of espionage during
the post-war era. In the recently
published "The Rosenberg Files,"
Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton
point out that the ability of Ameri
can communists to hold two possibly
contradictory loyalties in their heads
might permit them to share with So
viet agents information that non
communists would consider the

exclusive property of the U.S. — spe
cifically. designs for building the
bomb, which Julius Rosenberg may
very well have passed on from his
brother-in-law, who worked at Los
Alamos. The danger never was that
the Soviets might enlist the aid of
American communists to blow up the
government, as the popular (FBl
fed) beliefs of the day had it, but
that some American communists,
who had no reason to support the po
sition of the Truman and Eisenhower
administrations in the arms race,
might wish to counteract it.
Reichert and Klein only make two
unforgivable moves in Seeing Red: in
cluding footage of Richard Nixon in
an Army Day parade (any footage of
Nixon always brings a cheap laugh)
and ending an interview with Pete

Seeger by pulling the camera back to
show him chopping wood outside his
snow-bound cabin. The filmmakers
fall into a 50-year-old trap here —
idealizing and sentimentalizing labor
and thus the laborer. Read Michael
Gold, Grace Lumkin, Albert Maltz or
other communist writers of the De
pression, or listen to some of the
phrases Carl Hirsch used in the letter
he reads aloud in this movie, and you
will understand how the proletarian
became the hertf of the '30s and how,
as Robert Warshow explains in his
great essay "The Legacy of the '305,"
novels and drama and popular music
that embraced this new heroic

paradigm came to be accepted as art.
(The most ludicrous example of this
cultural devaluation is the 1954 film
Salt of the Earth. Because its heroes
are Chicano zinc mine workers strik
ing against their bosses, because most
of the actors in the picture were real
miners and because the filmmakers
were all victims of the blacklist, the
movie is widely believed to be a mas
terpiece. In truth, it's a sorry piece
of manipulation.)
Reichert and Klein don't get into
trouble very often in this movie, but
they aren't real documentarians,
either — or rather, they aren't real
directors. In a first-rate non-fiction
film, the camera has its own point of
view, different from that of the
people it captures; it may embrace
what they are saying or comment

ironically on their words, but in any
case it ought to show us more than
we could see if we did the interview
ing ourselves. And the camera in
Seeing Red tells us nothing. So the
dramatis personae — the communists
themselves — take over, and so does
Martha Olson, who supervised the ar
chival research. She has dug up some
extraordinary footage, most of
which I've never seen anywhere
before: Earl Browder, party general
secretary, addressing a Madison
Square Garden meeting in the '30s;
John Gates, editor of The Daily
Worker, tendering his resignation
after 27 years of active service in the

partv. following the Kruschev
report: Herbert Philbrick, the FBI
agent who wrote "1 Led 3 Lives,"
describing communism as a "lying,
dirty, shrewd, godless, murderous, de
termined international criminal con
spiracy." In a newsreel. cops beat up
participants in a communist rally
while the mocking voice-over treats
the incident as a cartoon. Glimpses
of striking tenant farmers camped
out beside the state highway to
publicize their plight are as
heartbreaking as Carl Hirsch's letter
implies. In a clip from the House Un-
American Activities Committee
(HUAC) hearings, author Howard
Fast's frustration and indignation
when his attempts to defend himself
are continually belittled or cut off
infect the audience, too: We want to
shout the senators down.

Most moving of all are the visual
and aural snatches we get of some of
the interviewees in their younger
days: Dorothy Healey, a pretty, in
tense, bright-eyed young woman —
barely out of her teens from the
looks of it — leading a meeting of
striking cotton workers; Bill Bailey
answering HUAC senators in the
same animated manner we see in
today's white-haired retired seaman,
full of that unassailable self
confidence that is part of his heri
tage. Seeing Red fails as a
documentary, but it shows us corners
of the American socio-political map
we've never seen before.

that provoked him into joining the
party, he relives all his old battles,

Gentle-eyed, sweet-toned Oscar
Hunter describes the action he saw in
the Spanish Civil War, burying his
emotion in carefully sculpted pauses
between phrases. Sylvia Woods, a big,
straightforward black woman with
indignant fury in her voice, tells how
she sent a pair of FBI agents packing,
warning them that white men
weren't safe walking through her
neighborhood after dark. A shrill,
head-tossing steel mill worker, Rose
Podmaka, says she got into the party
because they needed someone to
take minutes and collect dues — they
weren't actually recruiting women at
the time. Howard "Stretch"
Johnson, a veteran dancer from the
Cotton Club days who now teaches
college, lets his loose, jovial side leak
through his precise, oratorical class
room manner as he talks about the
need to relax even when you're
working 18 hours a day — especially
if you believe, as a good communist
does, that life on earth was meant to
be lived fully.
One is struck repeatedly by the
way passion and articulateness co
exist in these people's speech; you
can see their training — the years of
endless argument and organization —
in the shape of their commentary.
Dorothy Healey, who joined at the
age of 14, explains the joys of com
mitment to an immense cause:
"There was absolutely no question in
your mind who you were and what
you were and why you were. You had
that answered." Marge Frantz, a
soft-spoken woman of unmistakable
intelligence, explains the possibility
of dual loyalty — that if you were a
true believer, you held up the shining
example of Russia as an inspiration
for your own country to follow.
Their explanations are spiked with
anecdotes — humorous ones like
Edna Whitehouse's about the embar

rassment she felt when she saw her
husband getting up to speak in
public, potent ones like writer Carl
Hirsch's stories, passed on to his wife
in letters while he was covering a
sharecroppers' strike for a commu
nist paper, of the atrocities commit
ted against the families he had come
to know.
Being confronted with so many
fascinating camera subjects and so
many resonant issues — why the ac
tivities of the party were kept clan
destine; how political and social life
intermingled for party members; how
the violent impulses of men and wo
men whose loyalty to the organiza
tion forbade them to defend
themselves against cops, got
translated into military aggression in
the Spanish Civil War; the contusion
and bitterness of American commu
nists when Kruschev revealed the
horrors of the Stalinist purges in
1956 — the filmmakers, Julia Reich
ert and James Klein, are so over
whelmed that they don't do much;
they just sit back and drink it all in.
They are obviously in sympathy with
the interviewees — so much so that
they've made no apparent effort to
challenge them, by either word or
deed. So we meet only those commu
nists who stayed in the party even
after the Kruschev report or who
remained close to the socialist ideals
of their youth even after leaving the
organization. Yet thousands of
Americans who had joined the ranks
during the Depression swung
dramatically to the right during the
Cold War, and of the 80 percent of
the party membership who resigned
in or shortly after 1956, some of
them must have experienced such dis
illusionment that they altered their
politics significantly. (The radical
youth who settles into conservatism
in his middle years is the rule, not the
exception, in this country — look at
the activists of the '605.) But the
closest Reichert and Klein come to
unearthing a dissenter is the segment
in which Carl Hirsch claims he looks
back on his days in the party as just a
phase he went through — and when
Hirsch reads those letters out loud,
he has to choke back incipient tears.
Reichert, who conducts the inter
views, asks no embarrassing ques
tions; she's a devoted listener, not a
journalist. And remarkably few con
flicts are raised, considering the in
cendiary subject matter. Marge
Frantz and Edna Whitehouse ad
dress, peripherally, the contradiction

between the querying nature of
young people inclined to join such a
renegade cause and the rigidity of
the centralized, bureaucratic organi
zation promulgating the constant
questioning of other institutions.
But neither the interviewer nor the
interviewees suggest any other
reasons; for uneasiness. Though we
are shown samples of grotesque anti
communist propaganda disseminated
by the FBI, no one questions the
morality of distributing Communist
Party propaganda. And there's an un
persuasive segment in which several
of the people we've met, notably
Dorothy Healey, insist that the FBI
charges of espionage among party
members were not merely erroneous
but laughable — and not another
word is said about it. Very likely
Healey and Bill Bailey and the others

in the film never had any connection
with spies or spying — what secrets
could they have offered to the
Soviets? — but in the last few years,
political analysts and biographers
have tended to give greater credence
to the documents implicating certain
other leftists of espionage during
the post-war era. In the recently
published "The Rosenberg Files,"
Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton
point out that the ability of Ameri
can communists to hold two possibly
contradictory loyalties in their heads
might permit them to share with So
viet agents information that non
communists would consider the

exclusive property of the U.S. — spe
cifically. designs for building the
bomb, which Julius Rosenberg may
very well have passed on from his
brother-in-law, who worked at Los
Alamos. The danger never was that
the Soviets might enlist the aid of
American communists to blow up the
government, as the popular (FBl
fed) beliefs of the day had it, but
that some American communists,
who had no reason to support the po
sition of the Truman and Eisenhower
administrations in the arms race,
might wish to counteract it.
Reichert and Klein only make two
unforgivable moves in Seeing Red: in
cluding footage of Richard Nixon in
an Army Day parade (any footage of
Nixon always brings a cheap laugh)
and ending an interview with Pete

Seeger by pulling the camera back to
show him chopping wood outside his
snow-bound cabin. The filmmakers
fall into a 50-year-old trap here —
idealizing and sentimentalizing labor
and thus the laborer. Read Michael
Gold, Grace Lumkin, Albert Maltz or
other communist writers of the De
pression, or listen to some of the
phrases Carl Hirsch used in the letter
he reads aloud in this movie, and you
will understand how the proletarian
became the hertf of the '30s and how,
as Robert Warshow explains in his
great essay "The Legacy of the '305,"
novels and drama and popular music
that embraced this new heroic

paradigm came to be accepted as art.
(The most ludicrous example of this
cultural devaluation is the 1954 film
Salt of the Earth. Because its heroes
are Chicano zinc mine workers strik
ing against their bosses, because most
of the actors in the picture were real
miners and because the filmmakers
were all victims of the blacklist, the
movie is widely believed to be a mas
terpiece. In truth, it's a sorry piece
of manipulation.)
Reichert and Klein don't get into
trouble very often in this movie, but
they aren't real documentarians,
either — or rather, they aren't real
directors. In a first-rate non-fiction
film, the camera has its own point of
view, different from that of the
people it captures; it may embrace
what they are saying or comment

ironically on their words, but in any
case it ought to show us more than
we could see if we did the interview
ing ourselves. And the camera in
Seeing Red tells us nothing. So the
dramatis personae — the communists
themselves — take over, and so does
Martha Olson, who supervised the ar
chival research. She has dug up some
extraordinary footage, most of
which I've never seen anywhere
before: Earl Browder, party general
secretary, addressing a Madison
Square Garden meeting in the '30s;
John Gates, editor of The Daily
Worker, tendering his resignation
after 27 years of active service in the

partv. following the Kruschev
report: Herbert Philbrick, the FBI
agent who wrote "1 Led 3 Lives,"
describing communism as a "lying,
dirty, shrewd, godless, murderous, de
termined international criminal con
spiracy." In a newsreel. cops beat up
participants in a communist rally
while the mocking voice-over treats
the incident as a cartoon. Glimpses
of striking tenant farmers camped
out beside the state highway to
publicize their plight are as
heartbreaking as Carl Hirsch's letter
implies. In a clip from the House Un-
American Activities Committee
(HUAC) hearings, author Howard
Fast's frustration and indignation
when his attempts to defend himself
are continually belittled or cut off
infect the audience, too: We want to
shout the senators down.

Most moving of all are the visual
and aural snatches we get of some of
the interviewees in their younger
days: Dorothy Healey, a pretty, in
tense, bright-eyed young woman —
barely out of her teens from the
looks of it — leading a meeting of
striking cotton workers; Bill Bailey
answering HUAC senators in the
same animated manner we see in
today's white-haired retired seaman,
full of that unassailable self
confidence that is part of his heri
tage. Seeing Red fails as a
documentary, but it shows us corners
of the American socio-political map
we've never seen before.


A chorus of young Communist women sings at a May Day parade during the mid-19305.
Seeing Red has such a compelling,
underexposed subject — the men and
women who belonged to the Ameri
can Communist Party in the 19305,
'40s and '50s — and such a vivifying
cast of characters, that it's an ex
hilarating experience, even if it isn't
a very good documentary. You've
never seen such a genial mess of
faces. Bill Bailey, seaman and
longshoreman, has deep azure eyes
and a swollen bottle stopper of a
nose; when he recounts the beefs
that provoked him into joining the
party, he relives all his old battles,
sparring with his voice and his hands.

head-tossing steel mill worker, Rose
Podmaka, says she got into the party
because they needed someone to
take minutes and collect dues — they
weren't actually recruiting women at
the time. Howard "Stretch"
Johnson, a veteran dancer from the
Cotton Club days who now teaches
college, lets his loose, jovial side leak
through his precise, oratorical class
room manner as he talks about the
need to relax even when you're
working 18 hours a day — especially
if you believe, as a good communist
does, that life on earth was meant to
be lived fully.
One is struck repeatedly by the
way passion and articulateness co
exist in these people's speech; you
can see their training — the years of
endless argument and organization —
in the shape of their commentary.
Dorothy Healey, who joined at the
age of 14, explains the joys of com
mitment to an immense cause:
"There was absolutely no question in
your mind who you were and what
you were and why you were. You had
that answered." Marge Frantz, a
soft-spoken woman of unmistakable
intelligence, explains the possibility
of dual loyalty — that if you were a
true believer, you held up the shining
example of Russia as an inspiration
for your own country to follow.
Their explanations are spiked with
anecdotes — humorous ones like
Edna Whitehouse's about the embar

rassment she felt when she saw her
husband getting up to speak in
public, potent ones like writer Carl
Hirsch's stories, passed on to his wife
in letters while he was covering a
sharecroppers' strike for a commu
nist paper, of the atrocities commit
ted against the families he had come
to know.
Being confronted with so many
fascinating camera subjects and so
many resonant issues — why the ac
tivities of the party were kept clan
destine; how political and social life
intermingled for party members; how
the violent impulses of men and wo
men whose loyalty to the organiza
tion forbade them to defend
themselves against cops, got
translated into military aggression in
the Spanish Civil War; the contusion
and bitterness of American commu
nists when Kruschev revealed the
horrors of the Stalinist purges in
1956 — the filmmakers, Julia Reich
ert and James Klein, are so over
whelmed that they don't do much;
they just sit back and drink it all in.
They are obviously in sympathy with
the interviewees — so much so that
they've made no apparent effort to
challenge them, by either word or
deed. So we meet only those commu
nists who stayed in the party even
after the Kruschev report or who
remained close to the socialist ideals
of their youth even after leaving the
organization. Yet thousands of
Americans who had joined the ranks
during the Depression swung
dramatically to the right during the
Cold War, and of the 80 percent of
the party membership who resigned
in or shortly after 1956, some of
them must have experienced such dis
illusionment that they altered their
politics significantly. (The radical
youth who settles into conservatism
in his middle years is the rule, not the
exception, in this country — look at
the activists of the '605.) But the
closest Reichert and Klein come to
unearthing a dissenter is the segment
in which Carl Hirsch claims he looks
back on his days in the party as just a
phase he went through — and when
Hirsch reads those letters out loud,
he has to choke back incipient tears.
Reichert, who conducts the inter
views, asks no embarrassing ques
tions; she's a devoted listener, not a
journalist. And remarkably few con
flicts are raised, considering the in
cendiary subject matter. Marge
Frantz and Edna Whitehouse ad
dress, peripherally, the contradiction

between the querying nature of
young people inclined to join such a
renegade cause and the rigidity of
the centralized, bureaucratic organi
zation promulgating the constant
questioning of other institutions.
But neither the interviewer nor the
interviewees suggest any other
reasons; for uneasiness. Though we
are shown samples of grotesque anti
communist propaganda disseminated
by the FBI, no one questions the
morality of distributing Communist
Party propaganda. And there's an un
persuasive segment in which several
of the people we've met, notably
Dorothy Healey, insist that the FBI
charges of espionage among party
members were not merely erroneous
but laughable — and not another
word is said about it. Very likely
Healey and Bill Bailey and the others

in the film never had any connection
with spies or spying — what secrets
could they have offered to the
Soviets? — but in the last few years,
political analysts and biographers
have tended to give greater credence
to the documents implicating certain
other leftists of espionage during
the post-war era. In the recently
published "The Rosenberg Files,"
Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton
point out that the ability of Ameri
can communists to hold two possibly
contradictory loyalties in their heads
might permit them to share with So
viet agents information that non
communists would consider the

exclusive property of the U.S. — spe
cifically. designs for building the
bomb, which Julius Rosenberg may
very well have passed on from his
brother-in-law, who worked at Los
Alamos. The danger never was that
the Soviets might enlist the aid of
American communists to blow up the
government, as the popular (FBl
fed) beliefs of the day had it, but
that some American communists,
who had no reason to support the po
sition of the Truman and Eisenhower
administrations in the arms race,
might wish to counteract it.
Reichert and Klein only make two
unforgivable moves in Seeing Red: in
cluding footage of Richard Nixon in
an Army Day parade (any footage of
Nixon always brings a cheap laugh)
and ending an interview with Pete

Seeger by pulling the camera back to
show him chopping wood outside his
snow-bound cabin. The filmmakers
fall into a 50-year-old trap here —
idealizing and sentimentalizing labor
and thus the laborer. Read Michael
Gold, Grace Lumkin, Albert Maltz or
other communist writers of the De
pression, or listen to some of the
phrases Carl Hirsch used in the letter
he reads aloud in this movie, and you
will understand how the proletarian
became the hertf of the '30s and how,
as Robert Warshow explains in his
great essay "The Legacy of the '305,"
novels and drama and popular music
that embraced this new heroic

paradigm came to be accepted as art.
(The most ludicrous example of this
cultural devaluation is the 1954 film
Salt of the Earth. Because its heroes
are Chicano zinc mine workers strik
ing against their bosses, because most
of the actors in the picture were real
miners and because the filmmakers
were all victims of the blacklist, the
movie is widely believed to be a mas
terpiece. In truth, it's a sorry piece
of manipulation.)
Reichert and Klein don't get into
trouble very often in this movie, but
they aren't real documentarians,
either — or rather, they aren't real
directors. In a first-rate non-fiction
film, the camera has its own point of
view, different from that of the
people it captures; it may embrace
what they are saying or comment

ironically on their words, but in any
case it ought to show us more than
we could see if we did the interview
ing ourselves. And the camera in
Seeing Red tells us nothing. So the
dramatis personae — the communists
themselves — take over, and so does
Martha Olson, who supervised the ar
chival research. She has dug up some
extraordinary footage, most of
which I've never seen anywhere
before: Earl Browder, party general
secretary, addressing a Madison
Square Garden meeting in the '30s;
John Gates, editor of The Daily
Worker, tendering his resignation
after 27 years of active service in the

partv. following the Kruschev
report: Herbert Philbrick, the FBI
agent who wrote "1 Led 3 Lives,"
describing communism as a "lying,
dirty, shrewd, godless, murderous, de
termined international criminal con
spiracy." In a newsreel. cops beat up
participants in a communist rally
while the mocking voice-over treats
the incident as a cartoon. Glimpses
of striking tenant farmers camped
out beside the state highway to
publicize their plight are as
heartbreaking as Carl Hirsch's letter
implies. In a clip from the House Un-
American Activities Committee
(HUAC) hearings, author Howard
Fast's frustration and indignation
when his attempts to defend himself
are continually belittled or cut off
infect the audience, too: We want to
shout the senators down.

Most moving of all are the visual
and aural snatches we get of some of
the interviewees in their younger
days: Dorothy Healey, a pretty, in
tense, bright-eyed young woman —
barely out of her teens from the
looks of it — leading a meeting of
striking cotton workers; Bill Bailey
answering HUAC senators in the
same animated manner we see in
today's white-haired retired seaman,
full of that unassailable self
confidence that is part of his heri
tage. Seeing Red fails as a
documentary, but it shows us corners
of the American socio-political map
we've never seen before.
