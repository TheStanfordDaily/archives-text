# 'Unfaithfully Yours' lacks courage and purpose
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Preston Sturges' 194K Unfaithfully Yours — the last
great film by the writer-director who, virtually single
handedly, kept American film comedy alive in the
1940s — suggested a cross between Noel Coward and
Luis Bunuel. In it, a famous, savagely temperamental
conductor (brilliantly played by Rex Harrison), con
vinced that his lovely bride (Linda Darnell) has
cheated on him, fantasizes three strategies for
dealing with the situation: murder, forgiveness (as a
form of noblesse oblige) and a game of Russian
roulette with his alleged rival (Kurt Kreuger).
Sturges' inspired coup was setting each of these fan
tasies to a different piece of music — Rossini's
"Semiramide Overture," Wagner's "Pilgrims' Chorus"
and Tchaikovsky's "Francesca da Rimini" — con
ducted by Harrison in concert. Afterwards, the three
pieces merge in a witty musical montage as he at
tempts to carry out first one plan and then another
— failing dismally (and uproariously) either to achieve
the revenge he has lusted for or to play the high
romantic roles he envisioned in his daydreams.
Though the Sturges movie is a masterpiece, it
didn't catch on with the public, and so the people re
sponsible for the remake, director Howard Zieff and
screenwriters Barry Levinson, Valerie Curtin and
Robert Klane, have squeezed its episodic structure
and uncatcgorizable mixture of styles into a more
conventional shape. In other words, they have nerve
— the nerve to mount a new version of a film that
could hardly have been bettered — but not much
courage. They've built up the comedy of errors that
leads this conductor, Claude Eastman (Dudley
Moore), to assume his wife Daniella (Nastassia
Kinski) has been unfaithful, adding a subplot involv

ing an affair between a violinist, Maximillian Stein
(Armand Assante), and Carla (Cassie Yaes), the wife
of Eastman's manager (Albert Brooks); Claude,
through a series of Feydeau-esque mistakes, con
cludes that Daniella, not Carla, is Maximillian's
mistress. And there's only one musical daydream, the
murder plot, set to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto

This new version of
'Unfaithfully Yours'' isn't
a disgrace, but until the
last hour there's so little
to distinguish it that you
may wonder why it was
made at all.

(with Pinchas Zuckerman dubbing for Armand As
sante), so the filmmakers have minimized the chances
that a lowbrow audience will get restless with all that
classical music on the soundtrack.
This new version of Unfaithfully Yours isn't a dis
grace, but until the last half hour there's so little to
distinguish it that you may wonder why it was made
at all. Richard Libertini (he was the dictator of the
banana republic in The In-Laws) steals every scene

he's in as Claude's housekeeper-chauffeur, and Rich
ard B. Shull has one very funny sequence — his first —
as the detective hired by accident to trail Daniella.
(It's the one sequence that the screenwriters lifted
almost line for line from the original.) Nastassia
Kinski demonstrates real comic spunk, and she looks
so luscious in Kristi Zea's clothes that she validates
the entire premise of the movie, just as Linda Darnell
did in the first version: This woman is so beautiful
that her husband might well have something to worry
about. In fact, Kinski does Dudley Moore's work for
him; he never really suggests a husband driven to
comic lunacy by jealousy. He lacks courage, too — Rex
Harrison's courage to make the character unat
tractively bitter and vengeful. Moore's personality
gauge is stuck at adorable.
The essential miscasting of Moore would be puz
zling if the last half hour didn't allow him to do, fi
nally, what he's practically a genius at: the comedy of
clutziness. Zieff and his screenwriters rise to the oc
casion in the post-concert debacle — it's even wittily
designed. (In his fantasy, Claude, Daniella and Maxi
millian wear Halloween masks of an emblematic na
ture; in his attempt to bring the dream to reality he
has them don masks so preposterously benign that
the effect renders you helpless with laughter. I
giggled over this moment all the way home from the
theater.) And Dudley Moore makes all the obstacles
to the successful consummation of Eastman's plan
work in a way that another comedian might not have
been able to (though Harrison certainly did — it's the
only example of genuine physical comedy in his film
career that comes to mind). This section of Unfaith
fully Yours almost redeems the picture — until you
start recollecting Sturges' version.

The essential miscasting of Moore would be puz
zling if the last half hour didn't allow him to do, fi
nally, what he's practically a genius at: the comedy of
clutziness. Zieff and his screenwriters rise to the oc
casion in the post-concert debacle — it's even wittily
designed. (In his fantasy, Claude, Daniella and Maxi
millian wear Halloween masks of an emblematic na
ture; in his attempt to bring the dream to reality he
has them don masks so preposterously benign that
the effect renders you helpless with laughter. I
giggled over this moment all the way home from the
theater.) And Dudley Moore makes all the obstacles
to the successful consummation of Eastman's plan
work in a way that another comedian might not have
been able to (though Harrison certainly did — it's the
only example of genuine physical comedy in his film
career that comes to mind). This section of Unfaith
fully Yours almost redeems the picture — until you
start recollecting Sturges' version.
