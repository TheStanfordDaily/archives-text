# Geiger: Athletic Department is rallying
## 
### VALERIE CRITES Staff writer 
The Athletic Department has
learned a bitter fiscal lesson as a
result of dealing with a deficit that
may reach $1.7 million, according to
Andy Geiger, director of the depart
ment.
Geiger, speaking yesterday after
noon at Serra House's "Who Makes
Stanford Go?" program, said his of
fice has learned that "you can't play
at the edge of your limit all of the
time it you expect to survive the
tough times."
Geiger stressed that the Athletic
Department has become more fis
cally conservative by attempting to
cut costs, but that the department's
values and "sound philosophical base"
have not been shaken by the prob
lem.
The implementation of a new in
tercollegiate sports program is the
major step in cutting costs for the
department. The new system divides
Stanford's 48 intercollegiate teams
into three levels with varying degrees
of financial support.
For the Varsity II and 111 levels,
the department has pinpointed
sports that it wants to sponsor at
more than the club level but cannot
afford to support at a national level.
Geiger said.
"The new program actually ex
pands the Athletic Department
rather than shrinking it," Geiger

said. "The reduced cost base means
we now have more responsiblity and
more work than before, although
many perceive it to be just the oppo
site."
The hiring of a new football coach.
Jack Elway. is also expected to boost
revenues by reviving interest in the
football team. Geiger said that El
way's new style of football — a gam
bling defense and a speed-oriented
throwing attack — is expected to
cause a rebirth of curiosity in the
team, and Geiger hopes a televised
game next fall will be a result of the
excitement.
The football team will benefit
from "an instant transfusion of

strength" next fall as the Pac-10 al
lows each member school to expand
to 95 football scholarships from the
previous 90. Geiger expects the im
pact of the increase to be immediate
and apparent, but anticipates that
the impact will diminish over a five
year period as the scholarships are
worked into the program.
The extra scholarships will be ot
special help to Stanford, because the
football team has no attrition rate.
"Each player offered a scholarship
will receive it for his undergraduate
years here, even though not all pan
out athletically as the coaching stall
had expected," Geiger said. "At

some schools, athletes not talented
enough are forced to drop their
scholarships, but that is against our
beliefs."
Stanford Stadium hosts next Janu
ary's Super Bowl, an event that will
be of interest to the Athletic De
partment as well as to students.
While bringing money into the de
partment, the Super Bowl will also
provide a few hundred student jobs
for the day for those students who
want to be involved but cannot get
tickets, Geiger said.
Applications for these positions
will be taken next fall on a first
come, first-served basis, Geiger said.
One hundred tickets for the game
will be sold to students for $60 each.
Geiger concluded the discussion by
mentioning his long-range goals for
the Athletic Department.
"It would be great if the Athletic
Department continues to provide a
quality experience, through athletics,
for as many students as possible," he
said.
Geiger said the size of the inter
collegiate athletic system across the
country is getting too large. "1 hope
that the system doesn't keep es
calating. We should learn to make
the programs universally smaller, not
just at Stanford but at all schools.
"All programs could survive at a
smaller budget,"he said, "but in my
business we are all entrepreneurs and
need to be curtailed by others."
