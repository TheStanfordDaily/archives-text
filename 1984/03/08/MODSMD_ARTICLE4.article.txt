# Orange County braces for killer's release today
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
As Bay Area residents breathe a sigh of relief, auth
orities and citizens of Orange County are denouncing
the State Department of Corrections for its decision to
change the parole location of convicted killer Theodore
Streleski from San Francisco to the city of Orange.
Streleski, 47, will be released this morning from the
State Medical Facility at Vacaville, where he recently
underwent a three-week psychiatric review in which doc
tors found "no clinical basis" to commit him to a mental
hospital. He will be driven by parole officials to his new
residence, which is more than 400 miles south of Stan
ford, near Los Angeles.
Streleski has served five-and-one-half years of the
eight-year sentence he received for the Aug. 18, 1978
bludgeon slaying of Mathematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw.
City of Orange residents are irate, according to City
Manager J. William Little, who noted that more than
100 citizens have called city hall, the mayor's office and
the local police department to complain.
Little said citizens are expressing "great outrage
against a criminal justice system that allowed (Streleski)
to get out after only five-and-one-half years despite his
committing a premeditated murder and showing no
remorse."
Officials in the city of Orange feel similarly. "We're
pretty upset about it," Little said. "The justice system
. . . is obviously not working right. We think there should
be some legislation allowing (us) to say we don't want
him paroled here. It's the fault of bad state laws. . . .
We've made our concerns known. "
On Monday, Harriett Wieder, chairperson of the Or
ange County Board of Supervisors, made her concerns
known, assailing the corrections department for "the
lack of knowledge and the lack of information we have
in these cases." She called for an improvement in com
munication between the state agency and local jurisdic
tions and better advance notice on parole procedures.
Three-days' notice proved more-than-sufficient time
for city of Orange police to take any special security
measures they deemed necessary, police there said.
"We're not altering our normal routine at all," said Lt.
Michael Leintz, Orange police press relations officer. "1
would imagine (Streleski) will cause a great deal of
fear. . . but we see no reason for alarm."
Leintz said the local parole office has promised to
monitor Streleski in lieu of the police force's employing
extraordinary surveillance measures.
"We have no authority to take any action (against
Streleski)," Leintz said. "1 think he's implying a threat
toward professors ut Stanford University, but (not
against anyone) here. And making threats is not a crime

in the state of California."
The corrections department will release Streleski
today with $200 gate money and put him in a "halfway
house" in the city, but his parole regulations allow him
to move freely about Orange County to seek work.
"If we had our druthers, we'd rather he not live in Or
ange," Leintz said. "The city council hopes for a very
temporary stay," he added.
Little echoed the sentiment. "I frankly hope the guy
will find a job (elsewhere) and that's the last we'll ever
hear of him," he said.

Whether the 6-foot-4, 205-pound bearded ex-convict
will be able to find work in the ultra-conservative Or
ange County is a great concern to officials throughout
the state.
Phil Guthrie, state corrections department spokes
man, said Streleski has a definite advantage over other
ex-convicts.
"At least, here's a man who has a record of working,
unlike so many of our parolees. He has an advanced
degree," Guthrie said.
Leintz was less optimistic about Streleski's prospects
of finding a job.
"If people know what he's done, where he's been, the
chances are not good," he said. "He looks unkempt, like
he's just come out of the woods. As an employer, I'd be
hesitant to hire him just hy way ln< )cn>Ua. <--or
tainiy scare me."
