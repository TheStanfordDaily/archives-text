# SLAC chemical leak exceeds safety limits

Paint solvents and related chemi
cals in amounts exceeding govern
ment standards have been found in
the ground surrounding the former
site of a storage tank at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
SLAC hired a consulting firm to
check the area for chemical traces
after removing the tank in Decem
ber. The tank had been used until six
years ago for the disposal of paint
solvents from SLAC's paint shop.
The firm found traces of four
chemicals used in the paint solvents
and reported those results to SLAC
Monday. Although the amount of
these chemicals exceeds Environmen
tal Protection Agency (EPA)
guidelines, the contamination ex
tends "only within the first two feet
of the tank," according to Doug
Dupen, SLAC public information of
ficer.
"There is no indication that it has
gone any farther," Dupen said.
The EPA and the state of Califor
nia determine a health standard and
an ecological standard for every
chemical, according to Don Busick,
health physicist in the operational
health physics group and environmen
tal monitoring department.
None of the chemicals has been de
tected in amounts which exceed the
health standards for humans, Busick
said. However, some of the chemicals
may have exceeded the more strin
gent ecological standards for
protecting vegetation and the
microbes that exist in the soil, he
added.

"At this point we don't have any
problem with health effects in
humans and there are no problems of
contaminating the drinking water
supply," Busick said. "We suspect
that the contamination of the soil
has not migrated very far."
Because there is no concern with
crop or water supply contamination,
there is "no real emergency about
the problem," Busick said.
More extensive soil removal may be
necessary, but the mere removal of
the tank may have been sufficient to
take care of the contamination,
Busick added.
Bill Ash, a physicist who works
with SLAC's public information of
fice, said the discovery is not cause
for great concern. "It is not one of
these things that is outrageously
frightening," he said.
Janice LaFetra, president of the
Sharon Heights Home Owners Asso
ciation, concurred. "In this day and
age, let's face it, anyone who does
anything uses some kind of toxic
chemicals," she said.
Although LaFetra had not heard
about the leakage, she said she is not
too worried because her neighbor
hood is on higher ground than SLAC.
"We have very few concerns with
SLAC," she said. "They have been
very good neighbors as far as we are
concerned."
The 5-by-17-foot underground
tank had been used for the disposal
of paint solvents from SLAC's paint
shop until six years ago, when SLAC
contracted a licensed commercial
waste disposal firm to remove the
