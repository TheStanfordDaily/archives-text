Kremlin criticizes gulf policy
Moscow — The Soviet Union charged yesterday that U.S.
military activity in the Persian Gulf is creating "a grave
threat to peace and said Moscow "does not recognize"
what it called arbitrary American restrictions on move
ments of ships and aircraft in the area.
1 he Kremlin warning came in a special statement by the
official Tass news agency and was repeated on the main eve
ning television news program. Such special handling of a
statement is generally reserved for reports carrying particu
lar official weight.
The statement charged the United States with "grossly
violating" international law by arbitrarily establishing "on
vast areas of the sea procedures for the transit flight of
foreign civilian aircraft and ship passage procedures which
are more restrictive than even those applied to the waters
under direct U.S. jurisdiction."
Ihe agency gave no further details about the
"procedures" to which it referred.
Secretary of State George Shultz has assured a congres
sional subcommittee in Washington that the United States
can limit serious economic damage if the war in the Persian
Gulf region between Iran and Iraq escalates into a closing
of the key Strait of Hormuz. About 20 percent of the
West's oil passes through the crucial strait, and Washington
has pledged to keep it open. There are now about 30 U.S.
warships in the area.
I he Soviet statement was seen here as an attempt to
assert a stronger influence in an area of the world where the
Soviet Union now has only minimal leverage.
Iraqi gas warfare confirmed
Baghdad, Iraq — Iraq has used large quantities of locally
produced mustard gas against Iranian troops during the last
three weeks of fighting in the central and southern border
areas, foreign military and diplomatic, sources confirmed
yesterday.
The sources, who said small amounts of the toxic vapor
were deployed by Iraq on at least three occasions last year,
said helicopters and planes are believed to have dropped
mustard gas canisters that explode on impact and spread
what was described as "an oily mist" in the vicinity of
Iranian troop concentrations.
They said Iraq operates a plant capable of producing mus
tard gas in the town of Samawa. about 140 miles south of
Baghdad, and has conducted tests on sheep on a desert range
120 miles south of Samawa near the Saudi Arabian border.
Meese received Carter's plan
Washington — Edwin Meese, who has denied in writing
that he knew that Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign had ob
tained material produced for President Carter, was sent a
copy of an internal Carter campaign strategy memo just
before the 1980 Democratic National Convention, accor
ding to documents obtained yesterday.
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), a leading critic of
Meese's pending nomination as attorney general, asked
Meese in writing yesterday whether he was aware of that
and other 1980 Reagan campaign memos, which were ad- |
dressed to Meese and described Carter's political strategy.
The key memo forwarded by Metzenbaum to Meese's
White House office is dated Aug. 11, 1980, and is from
Max Hugel. a Reagan campaign aide who later served briefly
;iv the Central Intelligence Agency's director of covert ac
tivities.
I he Hugel memo enclosed a three-page Carter campaign
document, dated July 28, 1980, and outlining strategy for
the forthcoming Democratic convention and election cam
paign against Reagan.
Hugel wrote to Meese that Reagan campaign manager
William Casey, now CIA director, "asked me to have you
review this memo which fell into my hands and to come up '
with some of our own strategy . . . that might counter this
effort."
Last July, Meese told House investigators that he did not
know how Reagan's campaign obtained Carter's debate
briefing book and other Carter materials. "To the best of
my recollection, I have no knowledge of, and had no partici
pation in. any transactions involving material produced for
President Carter or any mechanisms for obtaining such ma
terial," Meese wrote to Rep. Donald Albosta (D-Mich).
Prayer proponents seek support
Washington — Backers of a constitutional amendment
governing prayer in public schools continued their search for
Senate votes yesterday as a leading opponent charged that
efforts to write a politically acceptable form of the
amendment will "inevitably lead to a 'to-whom-it-may
concern' prayer."
"I don't want my child to be taught any innocuous
prayer." roared Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.) in the midst
of another full day's debate on the issue on the Senate
floor. "Maybe you can find some language that is unobjec
tionable in a political sense or a parliamentary sense . . . but
it's going to be extremely objectionable in an ecclesiastical
sense to anybody who really cares about his faith."
Weicker said any effort by teachers or school districts to
find a form of prayer acceptable to all facets of a pluralis
tic community will lead to prayers that are "meaningless."
"That's what they're trying to fashion in the majority
leader's office right now," he said, "a 'to-whom-it-may
concern' prayer."
Cuban troops leave Ethiopia
Washington — Cuba has withdrawn about half of its
l().00()-man force from Ethiopia, including most of its com
bat troops, according to U.S. officials, and the quiet action
has puzzled American analysts both because it occurred at
all and because of the official silence surrounding it.
Among the key unanswered questions is why the Soviet
Union did not object to the withdrawal if, as Pentagon
analysts believe, Moscow viewed the Cuban force in Eth
iopia as "its own forward-based surrogates" that might be
used one day in the Middle East.
Some of the departed Cubans returned home. State De
partment <and Pentagon officials said this week. But most
were transferred to Angola, where they have contributed
to a significant increase in Cuban forces, from 20,000 to
25.000 over the past 18 months. Cuba, Ethiopia and the So
viet Union all have refrained from public mention of the
troop withdrawal.
Stocks continue decline
New York — The stock market recorded its third straight
loss yesterday amid persistent worries about the federal
budget deficit and rising interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 18.95
points in the week's first two trading sessions, dropped an
other 8.90 to 1143.63.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange stepped up to
90.08 million shares from 83.59 million Tuesday.

Kremlin criticizes gulf policy
Moscow — The Soviet Union charged yesterday that U.S.
military activity in the Persian Gulf is creating "a grave
threat to peace and said Moscow "does not recognize"
what it called arbitrary American restrictions on move
ments of ships and aircraft in the area.
1 he Kremlin warning came in a special statement by the
official Tass news agency and was repeated on the main eve
ning television news program. Such special handling of a
statement is generally reserved for reports carrying particu
lar official weight.
The statement charged the United States with "grossly
violating" international law by arbitrarily establishing "on
vast areas of the sea procedures for the transit flight of
foreign civilian aircraft and ship passage procedures which
are more restrictive than even those applied to the waters
under direct U.S. jurisdiction."
Ihe agency gave no further details about the
"procedures" to which it referred.
Secretary of State George Shultz has assured a congres
sional subcommittee in Washington that the United States
can limit serious economic damage if the war in the Persian
Gulf region between Iran and Iraq escalates into a closing
of the key Strait of Hormuz. About 20 percent of the
West's oil passes through the crucial strait, and Washington
has pledged to keep it open. There are now about 30 U.S.
warships in the area.
I he Soviet statement was seen here as an attempt to
assert a stronger influence in an area of the world where the
Soviet Union now has only minimal leverage.
Iraqi gas warfare confirmed
Baghdad, Iraq — Iraq has used large quantities of locally
produced mustard gas against Iranian troops during the last
three weeks of fighting in the central and southern border
areas, foreign military and diplomatic, sources confirmed
yesterday.
The sources, who said small amounts of the toxic vapor
were deployed by Iraq on at least three occasions last year,
said helicopters and planes are believed to have dropped
mustard gas canisters that explode on impact and spread
what was described as "an oily mist" in the vicinity of
Iranian troop concentrations.
They said Iraq operates a plant capable of producing mus
tard gas in the town of Samawa. about 140 miles south of
Baghdad, and has conducted tests on sheep on a desert range
120 miles south of Samawa near the Saudi Arabian border.
Meese received Carter's plan
Washington — Edwin Meese, who has denied in writing
that he knew that Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign had ob
tained material produced for President Carter, was sent a
copy of an internal Carter campaign strategy memo just
before the 1980 Democratic National Convention, accor
ding to documents obtained yesterday.
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), a leading critic of
Meese's pending nomination as attorney general, asked
Meese in writing yesterday whether he was aware of that
and other 1980 Reagan campaign memos, which were ad- |
dressed to Meese and described Carter's political strategy.
The key memo forwarded by Metzenbaum to Meese's
White House office is dated Aug. 11, 1980, and is from
Max Hugel. a Reagan campaign aide who later served briefly
;iv the Central Intelligence Agency's director of covert ac
tivities.
I he Hugel memo enclosed a three-page Carter campaign
document, dated July 28, 1980, and outlining strategy for
the forthcoming Democratic convention and election cam
paign against Reagan.
Hugel wrote to Meese that Reagan campaign manager
William Casey, now CIA director, "asked me to have you
review this memo which fell into my hands and to come up '
with some of our own strategy . . . that might counter this
effort."
Last July, Meese told House investigators that he did not
know how Reagan's campaign obtained Carter's debate
briefing book and other Carter materials. "To the best of
my recollection, I have no knowledge of, and had no partici
pation in. any transactions involving material produced for
President Carter or any mechanisms for obtaining such ma
terial," Meese wrote to Rep. Donald Albosta (D-Mich).
Prayer proponents seek support
Washington — Backers of a constitutional amendment
governing prayer in public schools continued their search for
Senate votes yesterday as a leading opponent charged that
efforts to write a politically acceptable form of the
amendment will "inevitably lead to a 'to-whom-it-may
concern' prayer."
"I don't want my child to be taught any innocuous
prayer." roared Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.) in the midst
of another full day's debate on the issue on the Senate
floor. "Maybe you can find some language that is unobjec
tionable in a political sense or a parliamentary sense . . . but
it's going to be extremely objectionable in an ecclesiastical
sense to anybody who really cares about his faith."
Weicker said any effort by teachers or school districts to
find a form of prayer acceptable to all facets of a pluralis
tic community will lead to prayers that are "meaningless."
"That's what they're trying to fashion in the majority
leader's office right now," he said, "a 'to-whom-it-may
concern' prayer."
Cuban troops leave Ethiopia
Washington — Cuba has withdrawn about half of its
l().00()-man force from Ethiopia, including most of its com
bat troops, according to U.S. officials, and the quiet action
has puzzled American analysts both because it occurred at
all and because of the official silence surrounding it.
Among the key unanswered questions is why the Soviet
Union did not object to the withdrawal if, as Pentagon
analysts believe, Moscow viewed the Cuban force in Eth
iopia as "its own forward-based surrogates" that might be
used one day in the Middle East.
Some of the departed Cubans returned home. State De
partment <and Pentagon officials said this week. But most
were transferred to Angola, where they have contributed
to a significant increase in Cuban forces, from 20,000 to
25.000 over the past 18 months. Cuba, Ethiopia and the So
viet Union all have refrained from public mention of the
troop withdrawal.
