## Reagan seeks aid for El Salvador 
### 
From The Washington Post
Washington — The Reagan administration, unwill
ing to wait while Congress debates its new aid plan
for Central America, will ask a Senate committee
today for $93 million in accelerated military assis
tance for El Salvador and ma\ request another $17
million for covert aid to rebel forces in Nicaragua, ac
cording to congressional sources.
The highly controversial funding request for El Sal
vador will come in the form of an amendment to an
emergency funding bill giving food aid to drought
stricken African nations that is before the Senate
Appropriations Committee, the congressional sources
said.
The parallel request for more aid to Nicaraguan
rebels is under "active consideration" at the White
House, the sources said, but they added that reaction
from bypassed Senate Intelligence Committee
leaders, including chairman Barry Goldwater (R-
Ariz.) and ranking minority member Daniel Moynihan

(D-N.Y.) has been so negative that the idea may be
reconsidered.
News of the new effort to move the Latin aid re
quests through Congress came as. separately, mem
bers of a House subcommittee balked at providing a
proposed $8.7 million for Army and Air Force
"contingency facilities" in Honduras, which would be
part of a planned overall 50 percent increase in Pent
agon construction worldwide.
Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee disagreed among themselves yesterday over a
proposal to block any further military aid to El Sal
vador this year, prompting a new round of negotia
tions toward compromise.
But Reagan administration officials said none of
the Democrats' plans were acceptable to them.
"All of their proposals reduce the funding available
to the Salvadorans below the level they need to be
successful against the Marxist-Leninist guerrillas,"
said a senior official who asked not to be quoted by
