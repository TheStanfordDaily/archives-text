From The Washington Post
Jerusalem — Three persons were
killed and nine were wounded yesterday
when a bomb ripped through a civilian
passenger bus in the Israeli port city of
Ashdod.
In a statement issued in Damascus, a
radical Palestinian splinter group
claimed responsibility for the bombing,
which was part of escalating warfare
between Arab and Jewish terrorist
groups attacking mostly unprotected
civilians throughout Israel and the oc
cupied West Bank.

Reports from the scene said the
bomb smashed windows, tore up seats
and left a jagged hole in the red-and
white bus, which was carrying shoppers
from an open-air market to a residen
tial neighborhood in Ashdod, a city of
64,000 people about 22 miles south of
Tel Aviv.
All of the dead and wounded were
identified as Jewish civilians. Two
people were killed instantly and one
died later in a hospital. Seven of the
injured required hospital treatment and
one was described as in serious condi

tion.
The national police said more than
100 "members of minority groups, a
euphemism for Arabs, were arrested tor
questioning. Police said all but nine
were later released.
The driver of the bus. Shmuel
Pinsker. said there were 15 passengers
aboard at the time of the blast, ap
parently the result of a booby-trapped
hand grenade.
"I think 1 saw the person who placed
the bomb." Pinsker said, referring to a
passenger carrying a white box who

claimed he had gotten on the bus by
mistake.
" There was shouting." Pinsker said in
describing the scene that followed the
explosion. "Some of the wounded got
off. Those that couldn't remained and
were evacuated later."
An eyewitness told Armed Forces
radio that enraged Jewish bystanders
threatened to attack Arab passersby
after the blast.
"There was great panic." Man Kriel
told radio reporters. "There was all
sorts of talk of revenge."
