Vacaville — Convicted killer
Theodore Streleski, who was due to
be paroled to Orange County after
serving five-and-one-half years in
jail, was reincarcerated on his own
volition three hours after his release
yesterday morning.
Streleski, 47, told more than 40
reporters who met him as he exited
the State Medical Facility at
Vacaville early yesterday morning
that he planned to violate parole be
cause he was "uncomfortable with
the conditions," specifically the
stipulation forbidding him to return

to the Bay Area, a condition he at
tributed to "pressure" from Stan
ford.
Streleski first refused to sign his
release papers at Vacaville and then
indicated that he would violate
parole immediately by "non-violent
means," such as not attending an
obligatory parole meeting the fol
lowing day, according to Phil
Guthrie, Corrections Department
spokesman.
"A man is required to accept the
condition of his parole," Guthrie
said. "If he will not do that, we have
the option to return him" to prison.
Streleski told reporters he does

not consider himself a threat to soci
ety, despite his refusal to promise he
will not kill again. "I'm not a crazy
man," he said. "I think I'm a normal,
healthy, well-balanced adult male."
He also said he has no need for psy
chiatric treatment.
After leaving Vacaville, Streleski
was driven by two parole agents to
Sacramento to pick up a third agent
before turning south for Orange
County. It was at the State Depart
ment of Corrections there that
parole officers decided to rescind
Streleski's release, Guthrie said.
Streleski's case was treated as an
infringement of parole regulations,

although he committed no parole
violation. Howard Miller, deputy
director of the Corrections Depart
ment and head ol the parole division,
ordered Streleski returned to
Vacaville pending a State Board of
Prison Terms verdict on whether to
revoke his parole.
Streleski can be returned to prison
for a maximum of six months as a
result of this revocation hearing,
which must he held within 45 days,
ihs imprisonment may be extended
beyond that time if he will not
cooperate with parole officials, but
he must be unconditionally dis
charged after IS months, Guthrie
said.
Streleski used his alloted 20
minutes with the media yesterday
morning both to assure authorities
that he would not cooperate and to
emphasize his grievances with Stan
ford.
"The practical justification is that
I committed murder to make a state
ment against Stanford," he said. "I
undercut that statement if I go back
on it in any way, if I say, 'Gee, I'm
sorry,' and all that sort of thing."
Streleski said he resented Stanford
for blocking his 19-year quest to earn
a doctorate degree in mathematics.
Since he feels that leaving prison on a
conditional parole would weaken his
stance against Stanford, he said he
would like to serve the remainder of
his prison term and then return un
restricted to the Bay Area, where he
hopes to reside and seek employment
as an electronics technician or an
electrical engineer.
He said he has "no interest in re
turning to Stanford" but stopped
short of promising he would never
return.
"I think Stanford is a distasteful
place," he said.
The articulate Streleski fieldet
the largely accusatory questions a
Vacaville with apparent ease, appear
mg sincere and rational while strivinj
to justify his actions uud bclieis*
In March. I Strelexki w;is con
victed of second-degree murder foi
the Aug. IS. 197K bludgeoning of
Mathematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw,

an act he said was done to make a
statement about the way Stanford
treats its graduate students.
After he refused to express
remorse for the killing or to promise
he would not kill again, the correc
tions department transferred him
from Soledad Prison to Vacaville to
undergo a psychiatric evaluation
before his parole.
Doctors found no clinical basis to
commit him to a mental hospital, al
lowing for his parole yesterday, hut
Corrections Department officials
changed the parole location from San

Francisco to the City of Orange in
Orange County after University
President Donald Kennedy and San
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein,
among others, requested that
Streleski not be released in the Bay
Area.
The 6-foot-4, bearded parolee
emerged from Vacaville at 8:20 a.m
yesterday wearing a denim jacket,
blue jeans and a thin, black headband
and carrying an orange, "a present"
from the prison hospital.
He said the media "adds a little
drama and suspense" to the case.
