# King sings out for Hart, political awareness
## Hart is 'cool, calm and rational' 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
"It's so important that
you really go for your
dreams," said singer/
songwriter Carole King
to a crowd so large
that it was spilling out onto
the walkways of Schiff
House Tuesday.
King came and spoke
openly to a group of Stan
ford students, expressing
views on politics, students
and performers. She rallied

'Students are wondering not only about
what to do in schoolbut whether or
not they can even afford to go/

support for Democratic
presidential candidate Gary
Hart, asserting, "If you
have an intelligent, in
formed opinion, it leads you
to Gary Hart, in my
opinion."
King also voiced a concern
that the present generation
of students seems to be
losing hope in its ability to
accomplish its dreams and
goals. "Students are won
dering not only about what
they should do in school, but
whether or not they can
even afford to go. It's sad
to see such a strong trend
towards apathy, and lack in
the belief that you can
make a difference in your
life and the lives of others."

King gave a brief and can
did history of her 42 years,
describing what her life was
like when she first started
in the music business.
"I was 15 and full of con
fidence," she said "when I
first started pounding on
recording companies' doors
in Brooklyn. I was rejected
from seeing the bosses of
nearly every office by the
front secretaries, but then I
ran into one secretary who
was new at the job and

didn't know what to do
with me, so she let me in to
see the head of Atlantic-
Records."
Even then, the boss didn't
like her lyrics, but he told
her that she showed poten
tial and he promised to try
and help her along.
"Funny thing," King said
with a smile breaking across
her tanned face, "Atlantic
is the label I'm recording on
all these years later."
She attributes her success
to an unflagging confidence
in herself. "I never thought
about failure, even though I
was constantly rejected,"
she said. "I just kept on
trying and hoping.
"You've got to go whole

heartedly for what you real
ly believe you want. There is
always the chance that you
might fail along the way,
hut at least you would have
tried, and you would have
learned from your efforts.
Ultimately, learning and
growing is success in itself,
she stressed.
In Senator Hart, King
sees a man who believes in
and follows his convictions.
"The puns are inevitable,"
King said, "but he has gone
out and done something be
cause he believed in his abil
ity to effectively run our
government better than
anyone else.
"If one pursues a dream as
long and hard as he has,"
King said, "you're bound to
get somewhere. 1 hope that
in his case he gets to the
top. Saying and believing in
the words 'I'll try' is the
only way one will ever be
able to say "I did it.' "
King decided to support
Hart last fall . She said she
had taken a good look
around at all of the "nuclear
madness" and "excessive
conglomerate and interest
group control" in this
country, and decided that
she wanted to try to do
something about it.
That "something" was
the choice to volunteer for
Hart. "He didn't ask me to
volunteer, but I saw that he
was the first candidate to
refuse funds from a politi
cal conglomeration, and I
felt that demonstrated a
lot of integrity." she said.
"As senator of
Colorado," King continued,
"he has balanced those who
favor industry and growth
with those who are con
cerned with the environ
ment, and he knows how to
harmonize conflict."
King also takes a strong
stand on the role of per
forming artists in society.
Entertainers have a
"responsibility to actively
express their opinions be.-
c<nisc ihcy cun give so much
to the support of public
views," she said.
She said that she has been
taking a look at the political
activities of other artists,
like Jackson Browne and
Dan Fogelberg. "It's vital
that performing artists do
what they can to support
public views," she said.
"If Boy George came
from Britain and supported
'X', then sure enough, half
of his following would also

support 'X' simply because
he said so," King added.
The popular folk/rock
singer said that if people
really like her music, then
it's probable that they
might choose to support her
same views. She stressed,
though, that she doesn't
want people to support her
views without an under
standing of the issues.
vote for Hart be
cause I say so, but do check
him out, his background
records etc., because I say
so." King said. "What's im
portant is to have an intelli
gent, informed opinion and
follow it."
After urging the audience
to investigate Hart's book
"New Democracy," as well
as his political campaign, she
sat down at the piano and
belted out two favorite
songs off her new album.
The lyrics clearly suggest

that that each individual
can make a difference.
"Too many people feel
that their opinion doesn't
matter, but if you add one
small voice to another small

'If you have an intelligent, informed
opinion it leads you to Gary Hart - in
my opinion/

voice then pretty soon you
will have built up a big
strong voice," she said.
"One small voice can
change the world, but you'd
better be strong," she sang
huskily.
Students responded to
her talk and song with high
spirits. Sophomore Suzanne
Quijano said, " I didn't real
ly expect her to sing so that
was a nice surprise, and she

seemed like such a normal
person — not some un
touchable singer — which 1
found made me like her even
more."
Many students said that

they came to hear what she
had to say about Hart, but
others simply came "hoping
she would sing."
King apologized for not
singing any of her older
songs, but said "1 promise
you'll hear them all if you go
to the benefit concert at
the Warfield (the Warfield
Theatre in San Francisco)
that I'm giving for Gary on
Saturday."
