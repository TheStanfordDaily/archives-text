## The 						Stanford Daily Lower than the lowest

In their latest petition on the ties between
the University and the Hoover Institution, Pro
lessors John Manley and Ronald Rebholz warn
about "attacks on Stanford" by editorials in
nationwide newspapers.
Hut regardless of how you view that petition
or the University-Hoover relationship, perhaps
the most biting "attacks on Stanford" haven't
appeared in The Sacramento Union or The
Wall Street Journal.
I he assailants who could have the most
negative impact on this University could be stu
dents — students sitting at the Oasis bar right
now, drinking beer and chatting with each other
and community residents.
At least they could be if Newsweek On
Campus magazine is any example.
In a section called "A Home Away from
Dorm," Newsweek On Campus takes a iook at
college hangouts across the country — including
the Oasis in Menlo Park, which the magazine
subtitles, "A Taste of the Grungy."
Provocative title. You and the rest of the na
tion can trace its origins to a rather charming
Stanford undergraduate, who tells Newsweek
On Campus just why the Oasis is a favorite
campus retreat:
"The place is full of lowlifes," she says. "We
want to see lowlifes once in a while — normal
people."
In case you're confused, that "we" is a refer
ence to Stanford students. And at least partly
thanks to this student's generous revelation,
Newsweek On Campus concludes that the Oasis

"provides a quick fix of reality for Stanford
students."
Of course the majority of Oasis visitors on a
given night are Stanford students, but put aside
that fact for a while.
It's probably reasonable to assume that a lot
of people who don't know very much about
Stanford formulate opinions via publications
such as Newsweek On Campus, or at least
through casual contacts with Stanford stu
dents.
With that in mind, consider our peers at col
leges and universities across the country. Think
of them reading that article, tasting that
grungy.
Is that really Stanford? We don't think so,
but it's hard to convince other people when we
have such distinguished ambassadors pontificat
ing at the "O" and elsewhere.
We must remember that, as Stanford stu
dents, we take a little bit of this place with us
every time we go to the Oasis and elsewhere. It
makes moral and pragmatic sense to keep con
stant tabs on how we help influence the way in
which the rest of the world views Stanford. And
after this article, Stanford students can only be
viewed as pretentious, snobby and downright
spoiled brats.
As for the content of that student's remarks,
you might want to buy her a drink the next time
you're at the Oasis catching up on reality.
Now that the Oasis is an official "lowlife"
haven, she's probably a fixture at the place.
