## New Hampshire analysis biased 
### 
I loci compelled to register a minor
protest note concerning The Stan
ford Daily's coverage of the New
Hampshire primary, particularly the
front page article entitled "Mondale
suffers Hart attack in New
Hampshire," (Feb. 29). This article
was factually flawed, skewed and
idiosyncratic in its reportage of the

VIEWPOINT

Granite State's great quadrennial
Political Snow Festival.
Contrary to the opinion of uniden
tified "experts here," Sen. Gary
Hart (D-Colo.) did not receive most
of his vote from the disillusioned (or
should I say "disheartened") sup
porters of the six contenders who
finished behind Hart in the lowa
caucus. The Coloradan's heaviest
tallies came from "soft" Mondale
supporters, independents and the
legions ot undecided, according to
the New York Times/CBS News exit
poll.
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall correctly observed that
"numerous Mondale supporters"

switched their allegiance from
Mondale to Hart. Corroborative
evidence was made available by many
electronic and print media sources
over the course of primary day and
evening. Why wasn't any of this
easily accessible information printed
in your lead article?
More to the heart of the matter,
your article failed to voice the
opinion of many objective media
commentators and political experts
that the Hart upset victory offered
a hidden political windfall for Sen.
John Glenn (D-Ohio) in the Super
Tuesday (March 13) southern prima
ries. A "softening-up cycle" may be
at work in this year's presidential se
lection process: Glenn softened up
Mondale for Hart in lowa and New
Hampshire, and Hart returned the
favor by softening-up Mondale for
Glenn's future assertive probes in
the south. The Stanford Daily's news
service from The Washington Post
alludes to this theme: "Hart's
showing here also could resuscitate
Glenn's dying campaign . . . ." While
these political zephyrs wafted
through The Daily's airy newsroom.

were the editors bunkered-down in a
political storm cellar (apologies to
Dorothy and Toto), thus mind
guarded in a narcoleptic stupor
against the contrary swirling currents
above them?
Hart does not have money, organi
zation. campaign experience or even
full delegate-slates in the
"Southeastern Triangle" states: Ala
bama. Georgia and Florida. Glenn
and former Vice President Mondale
solidly possess all four weapons for
the great Dixie showdown.
In contrast to the solid Glenn and
the artful dodger Hart. Mondale is a
political hemophiliac who is already
hemorrhaging from the axe pricks of
cantankerous Yankee woodsmen. If
the Kennedyesque Hart wins in Mas
sachusetts and the All-American
Glenn takes the political bowl games
in Alabama and Georgia, this descen
dant of Viking chieftains may be ren
dered anemic and become a sickly
shadow of a formerly robust political
self.
