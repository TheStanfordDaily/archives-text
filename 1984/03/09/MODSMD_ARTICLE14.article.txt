## Supporting contras means condoning murder 
### 
Bocana dc Pawais, Nicaragua — The
Reagan administration has to date invested
.it least $S0 million to .support contra forces
in the undeclared U.S. war against
Nicaragua. The president characterizes these
men as "freedom fighters." According to
Reagan, the contras fight for a return to
the revolutionary and democratic principles
■'betrayed" by the Sandinistas after
their 1979 overthrow of the hated Somoza
dictatorship. What Reagan studiously over
looks is that the contra forces are led bv and

VIEWPOINT

to a great degree composed of members of
Somoza's infamously brutal national guard.
Prominent contra leaders who once held
high posts in the Sandinista government
resigned when it became clear that the tiny
constituency they represented would not
become a major force in the new Nicaragua.
For this small but vocal elite, the revolution
was to mean a few liberalizing reforms, but
essentially a reinstatement of the old eco
nomic order, minus the excesses of Somoza.
What these contra leaders were unable to
achieve through political means at home,
they now hope to impose by resorting to
foreign intervention. Reagan's hollow
eulogization of the contras alleged commit
ment to a "return to the revolutionary prin
ciples" that culminated in Somoza's
overthrow obscures one fact: The contras

have never presented a political program for
the reconstruction of Nicaragua.
What sort of country do the contras pro
pose to create in Nicaragua? In the absence
of an articulated political program, what the
counterrevolution promises for Nicaragua
can only be judged by how they have con
ducted their "war of liberation."
The case of the town of Bocana de Pawais
is representative of how the contras have
pursued their "return to revolutionary prin
ciples." Campesinos from hundreds of
Nicaraguan communities have similar ac
counts of what the counterrevolution has
meant for them.
Bocana de Pawais first experienced the
counterrevolution in August 1981. when the
contras assassinated four men who had
joined the local self-defense militia. Seven
months later, the contras returned and as
sassinated a prominent municipal judge and
community leader. They told the locals that
this was a warning for anyone who would par
ticipate in the popular community organiza
tions.
The killings shook the community.
Recruitment into the health and education
brigades, the militia, and the production
cooperatives became more difficult for some
time. Still, community organizing continued,
and a subsequent contra attack was repelled
by the militia.
In August 1983, the contras returned, this
time with a 500-man task force. They over

ran several hamlets in the outlying areas of
Bocana de Pawais. Padre James Felt/, a
North American and the parish priest there,
related the following:
The first house the contras arrived at,
they killed three unarmed adults in front of
a 10-year-old girl. They forced her to lie on
the floor while one soldier emptied four
shells into her body. Left for dead, she
survived with superficial head and hip
wounds, a bullet in her chest and a shattered
wrist.
Nearby, they cut out one man's eyes
before stabbing him to death. Another they
hung from the roof beam of his own house.
They destroyed an outboard motor owned
by the river transport cooperative, and
burned the entire inventory of a clothing
cooperative. They executed the wife of the
local militia leader, and murdered another
man when he was discovered to be carrying
his membership card to the national farmers'
union. A guiding principle of the contras is
the destruction of production cooperatives
and other manifestations of collective or
ganizing activity.
In a nearby hamlet, the contras raped a
14-year-old girl before slashing her throat,
killing eight others in the same location.
They threw the girl's body down a ravine and
put the head in the road leading into the
hamlet. They beheaded another man and
threw his head into the road too. The con
tras forced three women to wallow in a large

mud puddle at gunpoint before shooting
them. Two of them survived. Thev shot a
mother unil futlivr to death in front of their
children.
As they were leaving they showed the
people their new FAL rifles, saying that
they were a gift from Reagan. They con
fiscated a Bible from one lay religious
worker, saying, "By this the people here will
see that we are Christians."
In their wake, they left 20 people dead,
three people raped, 18 houses burned to the
ground and 144 people homeless. They kid
napped 1 5 campesinos, forcing them to carry
heavy packs full of booty and military equip
ment. Such kidnapped men are customarily
pressed into military service with the con
tras. under threat of death.
In 1983 alone, the undeclared U.S. war
killed nearly 1000 Nicaraguans, caused $110
million in damage and forced cuts in vital so
cial programs, in order to divert funds to na
tional defense. This has been part of the
everyday Nicaraguan reality ever since
Reagan launched the "covert" war in 1981.
Far from sparking a popular uprising
against the Sandinista government, the con
tras have helped to consolidate the
Nicaraguan revolution. Six months later in
Bocana de Pawais, the community has pulled
together even more than in the past, in a
self-help campaign that has stimulated in
ternational support and assistance. The
hamlets have been consolidated for defense

purposes, the production cooperatives have
rebuilt destroyed facilities and the partici
pation in the militias has quadrupled. N<_-w
cooperative agricultural projects have been
initiated as well.
One can hardly avoid the feeling that once
again the United States is on the wrong side,
in the words of Padre Feltz, the attack
"made me ashamed to be a U.S. citizen." He
went on to say, "These 'Christian freedom
fighters,' this devastating "task force' razed
my parish, assassinated my friends,
destroyed the work of years. All this was
done with the complicity and the money of
the government of my country. It strikes me
as a terribly cruel and cynical nightmare."
The words of the murdered judge's widow
express the hope and resolve of so many
Nicaraguans, despite the prospect of a
prolonged and costly war of attrition
mounted by the United States from Hon
duras. By all evidence, she speaks for the
true defenders of freedom in Nicaragua.
"The blood of my husband and that of so
many other campesinos was not spilled in
vain. It nourishes the earth and the new life
with which we the poor move forward. I
would say that after what happened we feel
like the owners of our future. No 'task
force' will have the power to take away this
new spirit that is now ours."
