# Theme houses need re-evaluation
## 
### 
The purpose of residential education, like all
education here, is to edify and enrich students by
challenging them with new ideas, experiences and
perspectives. To this end. a variety of housing op
tions confronts students, each offering particu
lar challenges and experiences to ambitious
residents.
However, for the most part. Res Ed fails to
educate and challenge students. Ironically, begin
ning in freshman year, and continuing onward,
many housing options have the opposite effect:
llicy stifle and limit students, allowing them to
avoid the challenges which residential education
is supposed to impose. Theme houses are the
most visible example of this failure. The original
(unctions and goals of these residences have
become distorted, so that now they have an op
posite effect: channeling students into safer,
limited environments where the challenges of
group living are minimized.
Ethnic theme houses were created to confront
a wide range of students with ethnically oriented
political and social issues, while preserving an im
portant culture. The noble goal of such houses
was to maintain cultural identity and develop
ment while educating people who might have
been naturally removed from that culture.
However, theme houses have created two ex
treme situations, both of which are harmful and
unfortunate: On one hand theme houses have
produced an isolated, closed community, jux
taposed wiih ,t hostile, negative attitude among
students who aie outside the first group. In this
•n»e. theme houses have failed both groups.

Theme houses attract many residents not only
interested in preserving their cultural identity,
but in isolating themselves within it as well.
Every individual should have the right to do so if
he chooses, but if someone is entering Stanford,
he is supposedly broadening his perspective, and
at least temporarily exploring and understanding
new social groups. To allow incoming freshmen to
choose to live in an ethnic theme house is to al
low that student to completely bypass such a
period of exploration, and to simply continue to
limit himself to a culture with which he is already
very familiar and secure.
Stanford supposedly seeks to encourage cross
cultural cooperation and mutual growth. To al
low students to culturally isolate themselves
from their first day here is to retard that
cooperation and growth. It is too characteristic
of ethnic theme houses to take individuals who
have had limited exposure to other cultures and
rather than confronting them and helping them
to adjust to those other cultures, to instead en
courage their removal and isolation. The ultimate
effect is to produce narrow leaders, unable to
form and lead the coalitions and diverse organiza
tions which foster growth and progress.
The effects of this isolation extend outside
the group, producing a negative impact upon
those outside the culture who are supposed to be
educated and broadened. The inner circle of insu
lated theme house residents scares away out
siders, often producing a hostile reaction to this
perceived uninterest. Theme houses make only a

minimal effort to reach out to potentially inter
ested residents, so that most non-ethnic resi
dents are those unlucky in the housing draw.
Societal ethnic prejudices lay the foundation for
such ethnic and cultural division, but an
isolationist, narrow attitude drives that division
further, to the detriment of all concerned.
Perhaps it is inevitable that cultural isolation
exist, and that ethnic independence prevail. His
tory has produced a society which divided along
social, economic, ethnic and cultural lines, and
perhaps to oppose this is to row against the cur
rents of American history. Perhaps it is natural
that alliances form along these lines, and that
groups form to help themselves. American indus
try is based on "old boy networks." connections,
recommendations, cronyism and nepotism. Per
haps ethnic minorities will help themselves not by
combating such games, but by adhering to the
rules and forming similar networks. However, it is
not the role of a university to encourage such at
titudes, or to passively accept such cynical
perspectives. At least for a brief time, cultural
crossover is an ideal to be striven for. Perhaps ul
timately no concrete results will follow from
such cultural crossover, but human understanding
and tolerance may. These worthy ideals can be
encouraged to some extent by ethnic theme
houses, but, as theme houses currently exist, nar
row and inflexible attitudes are prevailing
against the ideals which the University and Resi
dential Education are supposed to produce.
