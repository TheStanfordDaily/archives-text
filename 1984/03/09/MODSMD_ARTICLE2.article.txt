# Theta Xi residence to be sold
## 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
The Theta Xi fraternity is arrang
ing to transfer the ownership of its
house to the University before the
end of spring quarter.
Fraternity members conferred
with the University in an open
debate last Friday, and are currently
working on the logistics of the sale.
Some contractual details between
the fraternity, its alumni corpora
tion and the University still remain
to be settled.
"There were a whole lot of reasons
for our wanting to sell the house,"
said Theta Xi president Mike
Flaherty, a junior majoring in human
biology. "To begin with, trying to
maintain a 70-year-old house involves
so much time, money and effort that
it's just no longer feasible. There's
just an overwhelming amount of
work to get done."
The fraternity — better known as
"the Taxi" — did not want to relin
quish ownership of the house, but ac
cording to Flaherty it could no longer
afford to maintain the building.
"There was a tide of people trying to
turn the house around structurally,
but they just couldn't quite do it.
It's been like a carrot in front of a
horse." he said.
The members solicited cost es
timates for urgent repair projects
from the Public Health and Safety
Office, a fire marshal and other Uni
versity employees. Even the lowest
figure quoted was a prohibitive
$200,000. according to Flaherty .
The University is planning to make
all necessary renovations upon assum
ing lull ownership of the house. " I he
nature of the work would be to redo
the entire plumbing and wiring sys
tems and probably to install a
sprinkler," according to Row Direc
tor Diana Conklin. "We would hope
to get the bulk of the needed work
done this summer." she said.
"Since we approached the Univer
sity with the matter, they've been
really helpful. They are as concerned
as we are about the safety perspec
tive. and they would like to see
renovations get underway as soon as
possible," Flaherty said.
"This move is really in our best in
terests.'' he explained."lt just was
taking too much of our time away
