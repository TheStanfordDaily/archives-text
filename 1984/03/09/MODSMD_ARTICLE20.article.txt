# An inside view of the City: Nob Hill to Pier 39
## 
### CATHY JANUS 
Exploring San Francisco is an
adventure filled with unlimited
surprises. II you're one of the
tew who hasn't vet discovered
how delightful the City is.
spring break or another after
noon or weekend next quarter
is your chance to visit the
Baghdad by the Bay.
San Francisco offers many
advantages for the person who
wants to get away. Even
though the cable cars won't be
operating until June, there is
adequate public transporation
systems which will get you to
San Francisco, and once there,
take you where you want to go.
But once there, where should
you go? To get a view of the
City from two vantage points,
and at the same time visit
some popular landmarks, you
may want to visit Nob Hill and
Pier 39.
Robert Louis Stevensnn
wrote that "Nob Hill must cer
tainly be counted the best part
of San Francisco." Perhaps the
Stanford family thought so
too, because it was on Nob Hill
that they and other affluent
families built their residences.
Of the great homes which
stood, only one remains, hut
hotels like the Mark Hopkins,
which replaced them, reflect a
continued dedication to
elegance.
The Mark Hopkins is indeed
worth visiting. In recognition
of its exceptional qualities, the
California State Parks Com
mission designated the site a
California historical landmark.
The hotel has acquired a special
significance beyond its location
which is well deserved.

Once you get beyond the
luxury ol the lobby. \ou will
want to see the Mark Hopkins'
unique mail chute as well as the
glass-walled lounge at the top
ot the hotel, where a spectacu
lar 360-degree view of the city,
the bay and the surrounding
counties awaits you.
The smoked-glass mail chute
extends from the Top of the
Mark bar to the ground floor,
where mail dropped from the
hotel's floors finally ends up in
an old-fashioned mailbox.
Watching postcards and letters
go spinning down the chute
may seem trite in the telling,
but those who stop to enjoy
this impressive structure are
not limited to young children.
By day or night, the view
from the Top of the Mark is
one of the best around. You
can look at the Bay Bridge and
at the same time see the
Golden Gate Bridge reflected
in one of the mirrored panels.
On a clear day, boats can be
seen sailing on the bay, planes
and birds fly by at eye level,
and buildings of various sizes,
colors and architectural styles
lie below you.
The Top of the Mark serves
drinks until 2 a.m., Monday
through Saturday. You won't
find a better place to have a
drink, whether you go there
after spending a romantic eve
ning in the City or to celebrate
the end of the quarter. A daily
buffet luncheon is served from
noon until 2:30, as well. On
Sundays the luncheon begins
at 11 a.m. and is as magnificent
to behold as the view itself.
The Mark's dedication to

elegance, to providing some
thing exceptional, is exempli
fied b> its buffet. On tables by
the hai. the buffet features
hot entrees, including an egg
selection, fish, chicken and
sliced baked ham. Then there is
a table with French baguettes,
croissants, cheeses and Iruit,
another table with soup, pate
and luncheon meats and an as
sortment of salads and finally,
a dessert table. The buffet
costs $14 and if you sample
only the desserts, you'll have
eaten more than your money's
worth. The fresh-baked selec
tions include cream puffs,
napoleons, chocolate eclairs,
fruit tortes. flan, mousse and
bread pudding with a liqueur
custard topping.
After your sumptuous lunch,
you may want to take a walk
up and down the hills of the
City. To take advantage of the
crisp breeze and salty air by the
bay. eventually wind your way
to Pier 39, located just east of
Fisherman's Wharf.
Continuous free entertain
ment is provided along the pier,
and there is a shopping complex
with more than 135 shops and a
variety of restaurants. Two or
ganizations, the Red and
White Fleet and the Blue and
Gold Fleet, offer cruises on
the bay. The luxury fleets, one
representing Stanford and the
other Berkeley, have an inter
esting history, which you can
read about on one of Pier 39's
many wooden signs which tell
stories about the building and
the area. Pier 39 also presents
the "San Francisco Experience," a
show which lets you "feel" the

San Francisco earthquake,
while other visual and sound
effects give you a 30-minute
tour of the City from its
bawdy Barhary Coast begin
nings to the glamorous me
tropolis it has become.
As night falls, and your
stomach growls with hunger,
you don't have to go any fur
ther than the Pier to find a
delightful eating experience.
Don't feel you have to cat at
one of the restaurants on the

Wharf itself in order to sample
the finest fresh seafood.
Dante's Sea Catch, located on
the second level of Pier 39, of
fers a fabulous view of San
Francisco, a modern, elegant
interior and a fine selection of
fresh seafood. Its prime
waterfront location affords
customers an unsurpassed view
of the City above, where Coit
Tower and the Transamerica
Building stand amid the other
buildings, and also includes the

lights (it the Bay Bridge ami
the counties across the water.
Directh lie low is a boat dock
and a path where horse-drawn
buggv rides pass In. Dante's
striking view is very popular
with loeals and tourists, so
reservations are necessary.
Dante's menu is also reason
ahly priced: seafood dinners,
the specialty, begin at $ l >. A
unique basket of bread, some
topped with garlic and par
mesan cheese and others leatur
ing tomato sauce and melted
cheese, are included with all
meals. Dante's clam chowder
has won prizes tor its quality
taste, and the other appetizers
and entrees are definitely
prize-winning also. The menu
features an extensive selection
of fresh seafood, a sampling of
Italian fare and steak. At the
end of your meal, a hot towel is
provided and then the waiter
rolls a tempting dessert tray
with various pastries and other
delights to your table. Anil
when the check arrives, choco
late manlier cookies complete
your meal.
All the delights of San Fran
cisco arc a mere 30 miles away.
Travel time, depending on the
chosen mode of transport, is
hardly tiresome. Unless you're
a real night owl, buses, which
run until I a.m. should get you
back to Stanford so that you
don't have to stay the night.
However, if you want to expe
rience waking up in the City,
there are a number of lodgings
to choose from.
M;my consider staying in the
Fisherman's Wharf area or on
Union Square, but I recom

mend that you return to Nob
I lill. The Mark I lopkins has a
special March rate which pro
vides one the opportunity to
stav in rooms which combine
eontemporai v eonv cnience
with traditional elegance for
$83 for two. This rate is a sub
stantial savings, for you'll be
staying in a room which usually
costs between $ 140 and $ 190,
Millions of dollars have been
spent over the years to
renovate the Mark Hopkins,
though some superior special
features have been retained.
For example, the luxurious six
loot bathtubs were reinstalled
when the bathrooms were
modernized. Special soaps and
toiletries, as well as terry cloth
towels and robes, are also pro
v ideil.
It you and your friend want
something less-expensive still,
you can exchange luxury for
more affordable accomoda
tions and stay in a downtown
motel for rates beginning at
$40. l or this price you will
usually get a private bath, and
sometimes a continental
breakfast. Cheaper still are
motels in the Union Square
neighborhood which don't in
clude a private bath. Costs
begin at $25-30. There are also
several hostels in San Francisco
which start at $5 for members.
Information on weekly
events in San Francisco, as well
as an in-depth listing of points
of interest, shops, and restau
rants is available free of charge
at many hotels and at the San
Francisco Convention anil
Visitor's Bureau.

It's difficult to decide which is more magnificent: the view of
the City from the Top of the Mark, or the buffet luncheon
they serve, but the two in combination are well worth experi
encing.
