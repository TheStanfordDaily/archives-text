## Ducks paddle hoop crew and dim Card NIT hopes Stanford closes regular season at 19-12 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
Eugene, Ore. — The University of
Oregon basketball team decided to put on
a dunking exhibition last night at McAr
thur Court, and Stanford didn't do much
to stop it.
Duck forward Greg Trapp began the
game with two stuffs — the first on an
alley-oop pass from guard Gary Gatewood
and the second on a breakaway following a
steal — and Stanford never seemed to
recover as the Ducks passed the Cardinal
91-71 in Stanford's worst loss of the
season.
Oregon dominated in all facets of the
game and was nearly invincible on the
boards, grabbing 47 rebounds compared to
just 32 for Stanford.
Duck center Blair Rasmussen, a 7-
footer, was nearly unstoppable on the
inside, leading all scorers with 23 points
and grabbing a career-high 16 rebounds.
Forward Trapp had 15 points for the
Ducks and also added nine rebounds and
three blocked shots on the evening. He was
perfect from the floor — hitting 6-of-6
shots.
"I don't know who in the country could
have beaten Oregon here tonight," Stan
ford Coach Tom Davis said after the
game. "Oregon played with world-beater
style. This was a night where they could
have beaten North Carolina or Geor
getown.
"Rasmussen played a great game, but I
also liked their forwards, Trapp and
(David) Brantley," Davis said. "They have
some size advantages in the front court
that we don't have."
The victory boosted Oregon's record to
15-12 overall, 10-7 in the Pacific-10 Con
ference, and greatly enhanced the Ducks'
National Invitation Tournament (NIT)
chances, while Stanford fell to 19-12, 8-10
in the conference. With Arizona's loss to
UCLA last night, Stanford is guaranteed a
fifth-place finish in the Pac-10.
Davis said afterward that the loss
should not greatly affect Stanford's NIT
chances.
"We think we have some deserving
traits," Davis said, "all of our (the Pac
-10's) first-division teams should be going
to a tournament. With 19 wins, we're right
in the middle of the NIT pool."
One problem, according to Davis, may
have been that Stanford was trying too
hard. "1 tried to play it (the game) down,"
Davis said. "They (Cardinal players)
wanted it so badly, and sometimes it works
against you."
Oregon's quick start left Stanford
somewhat in a daze, as the Ducks &rged to
a 43-28 halftime lead. The Cardinal didn't
make a game of it, never getting closer
than 11 points midway through the second
half.
Oregon shot 61 percent on the evening,
compared with a season low of 36 percent

for Stanford (the Cardinal's previous low
was 42 percent against Washington State).
Stanford guard Keith Jones led Cardinal
scorers with 17 points, but shot just 7-of
-21 from the field. Jones played with four
fouls for over 17 minutes of the second
half.
"We definitely weren't in our rhythm,"
Jones said. "Oregon came out and dictated
the style of play. They came out fast and
blocked shots."
Cardinal center John Revelli had just 10
points before fouling out with 9:44 left
and shot just 2-of-7 from the field. Fresh
man guard Novian Whitsitt and junior
swingman Steve Brown both added 10
points for Stanford.
Whitsitt played well last night, logging
11 minutes. • * " ■' * > »»
Oregon dictated a physical style of play
in a game which produced 61 total fouls.
Along with Revelli, forward Andy Fischer
also fouled out for Stanford with just
over a minute to play, while guard Chris
Harper was the only player to foul out for

Oregon, leaving the game with seconds
left. Four Oregon players ended the con
test with four fouls each.
The biggest surprise in the game was the
play of Trapp, who was not even penciled
in as a starter until gametime.
"He had a couple of dunks early, which
seemed to get them going." Jones said.
"He seemed to get every rebound in the
first half."
Oregon forward Brantley also played
well, scoring 13 points and adding seven
rebounds for the Ducks. "'Brantley is an
ideal tall forward," Davis said. "He passes
so well and is also good on the boards. I
think he is one of the most underrated
players in the league."
