# Offense just starting to pick up
## Card hopes to make Bears slumber 
### ROB ZWEIG 
"The statistics don't mean anything
when we play Cal."
So said Stanford Head Baseball Coach
Mark Marquess, who certainly is not the
first person on the Farm to utter such
words. But the Cardinal nine need only
recall last year to confirm Marquess' words
of wisdom.
Stanford was resting atop the Pacific
-10 Southern Conference standings with an
N-l mark and had breezed to victory in 13
of its last 14 games when UC-Berkeley
rudely took two out of three from the
then league leaders.
This year the script is different as the
cross-bay rivals hook up for a three-game
series beginning today at Sunken Diamond.
Buj for Stanford the series is no less sig
nificant.
"It's a crucial time for us." Marquess
said earlier this week. "Not just because
it's Cal but because where the games come
in the season. We want to get back on the
winning track" before a two-week break
for final exams.
The Cardinal is a mediocre 13-12-1 on
the year and 1-2 in the Pacific-10, and it's
really no wonder, according to their skip
per. "If you look at our statistics, our
pitching is kind of average and our hitting
is kind of average."
Behind the statistics, however, there are
ample reasons for hope of good things to

come. Foremost among them is the new
Stanford offense that has begun to assert
itself. Although the Card is only hitting a
collective .2N5, the club has pounded 44
hits and tallied 44 runs in the last four
games.
Leading the offense's resurgence are
shortstop John Verducci and first baseman
Rick Lundblade. Verducci is riding a nine
game hitting streak that has boosted his
season average to .314. The senior, best
known for his glove in the past, is hitting a
torrid .457 (16 for 35) during this recent
stretch.
Not to he outdone, Lundblade has
ripped opposing pitchers to the tunc of
.476 over the last 10 games. Lundblade
has also knocked in seven runs in that time,
while raising his average to .301.
Cal (17-9-1) will counter with a host of
.300 hitters led by switch-hitting second
baseman Frank Matt ox (.385) and third
sacker Greg McClain (.357). The Bears also
boast some power in the person of Lance
Blankenship, who has already blasted five
home runs and driven in 24 runs.
Cal will he making it's Pac-10 debut
against Stanford after bringing up the rear
in the "Six-Pac" Southern Division last
year, but Stanford's mentor remains wary.
"They're a lot like (UC-) Santa Barbara
(an early season opponent that beat the
Card in two of three games at Stanford)
because they really try to run and try to

apph the pressure. They've hit the ball
ver\ well as a team too. We'll tr\ to slow
them down a little."
Marquess will give that responsibility to
junior left-hander Jeff Ballard (2-2)
today. That's the same Jell Ballard who
was recognized as the Pac-10's top reliever
in 1983 and has started only one game in
the last two years.
' I'd much rather leave Ballard in the
bullpen," shrugs Marquess. "But other
starters haven't gone past three innings
and lie is one of our best pitchers. We want
to get six or seven innings out of him each
weekend and it doesn't do us any good
when he has to come in and we're behind."
The Cardinal pitching staff has been
depleted by the temporary loss of the
injured Brian Myers, so the bulk of the
burden will fall on the shoulders of John
Radtke. Radtke has been consistently
sharp in forging a 4-0 season mark with a
2.3 1 earned run average. The senior will be
on the hill when the two clubs travel to
Cal's Evans Diamond for the second game
of the series tomorrow. He may be
squaring off with Cal's Bryan Price, who
sports a spotless 6-0 record and a 2.96
ERA.
Today's game and Sunday's finale will be
played in Sunken Diamond at 2:30 p.m.
and 1 p.m. respectively. Cal will host to
morrow's contest at 1 p.m.

The Cardinal will have to deploy its defensive players a little more efficiently if it expects to
stop hot-hitting UC-Berkelev this weekend. The three-game home-and-away series begins
today at Sunken Diamond.

The Cardinal pitching staff has been
depleted by the temporary loss of the
injured Brian Myers, so the bulk of the
burden will fall on the shoulders of John
Radtke. Radtke has been consistently
sharp in forging a 4-0 season mark with a
2.3 1 earned run average. The senior will be
on the hill when the two clubs travel to
Cal's Evans Diamond for the second game
of the series tomorrow. He may be
squaring off with Cal's Bryan Price, who
sports a spotless 6-0 record and a 2.96
ERA.
Today's game and Sunday's finale will be
played in Sunken Diamond at 2:30 p.m.
and 1 p.m. respectively. Cal will host to
morrow's contest at 1 p.m.

The Cardinal will have to deploy its defensive players a little more efficiently if it expects to
stop hot-hitting UC-Berkelev this weekend. The three-game home-and-away series begins
today at Sunken Diamond.
