# Wilson has best chance
## Mat trio go to NCAAs 
### PETER CASTILLO 
Three Stanford wrestlers will change venue
this weekend and face more than 15,000 scream
ing fans at the NCAA Championships. The com
petition began yesterday and will continue
through tomorrow at the Meadowland Arena in
East Rutherford, N.J.
"The wrestlers have a good attitude and their
conditioning is excellent. I have worked a lot to
prepare them for the situations they will face,
the high level of competition and the large num
ber of fans," said Stanford Coach Chris Horpel.
Horpel feels that Jeff Wilson (177 pounds)
has the best chance to place. Wilson finished
second at the Pacific-10 Championships to
qualify for the NCAA Championships. He also
performed well at the Caesar's Palace Invita
tional,' which featured some of the nation's best
wrestlers.
Horpel believes that Wilson has a lot of per
sonal motivation, too. Wilson is a fifth-year
senior and this has been his first full year of
competition. He has been beset by injuries and
transfered to Stanford from the University of

Washington after the Huskies phased out their
program.
Wilson has strong upper body technique and in
the past week Horpel and his assistants have
worked on Wilson's moves from the lower posi
tion. This strategy could prove important for
Wilson's quick escapes when the other wrestler
has the advantage and the Cardinal needs to
conserve energy.
Also competing will be Jeff Bradley (134
pounds). Bradley finished third at the Pac-lOs
and received a wild-card entry. Horpel describes
Bradley as a hot-cold wrestler who has problems
with his consistency. The week's practice has
centered on his mental attitude and on minor
technical flaw.
Scott Wiggen's (142 pounds) biggest asset is
his mental toughness and Horpel feels that Wig
gen can compete with the best. Wiggen, who
finished second to qualify for the NCAAs, is
also weak from the bottom position and at
times relies too much on his upper body tech
nique, Horpel said.
