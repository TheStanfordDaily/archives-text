# Women try to ensure regional bid

### CAROLYN TARKINGTON 
The Stanford women gymnasts will
meet their toughest competition of
the season tonight in the Western Col
legiate Conference meet at California
State Long Beach.
The Cardinal, ranked 12th in the na
tion, will face eight teams, four of
which are ranked in the top 10 nation
ally. Included among these are second
ranked Arizona State, third-ranked
UCLA, fourth-ranked Cal State Fuller
ton and seventh-ranked University of
Arizona.
Head Coach Homer Sardina called
the meet a "mini NCAA tournament"
since only three of the top seven teams
in the nation will not be competing in
Long Beach. The Cardinal finished the
WCAA's in 7th place last year but Sar
dina is more optimistic for this year.
"Our season average has been the high
est ever in Stanford history. We're
hoping for a fourth- or fifth-place

finish," he said.
A strong team finish would secure
Stanford's chances for a bid to the
Western regionals. Sardina predicts
that a team score of 183 or better
would be enough to maintain the cur
rent fifth-place Western regional
ranking.
The top six teams in the area qualify
for regionals by averaging its high home
and away meet scores. "This conference
meet is very important to us," said Sar
dina. "Because Oregon State, Univer
sity of Washington, Cal, USC and
Stanford are all just a few tenths
apart, any one of these teams could
score really well in the conference meet
and secure a position in the top six
teams to go to regionals."
The top two teams in the region, Cal
State Fullerton and UCLA, are ex
pected to remain in their pre-eminent
spots. Stanford will be led by this

season's top all-arounders Merilyn
Chapman, Nanci Goldsmith and Angie
Barnes.
The Stanford men will also compete
tonight in their last dual meet of the
season against Cal State I'ong Beach
and Chico State. The competition,
scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion, is the the last home gymnas
tics meet-of the season.
The men's record currently stands at
10-7. They will be led by top all
arounder Jon Levy. Levy, along with
freshman Randy Besosa and junior
Shaun Hoffmeyer, put in outstanding
performances last weekend and helped
to set a team record on high bar with
scores of 9.75, 9.80 and 9.65
respectively.
Head Coach Sadao Hamada is confi
dent that the Cardinal team will win
tonight with strong and consistent per
formances.
