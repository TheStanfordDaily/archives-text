## 'Shame,' shame 
### MIKE HALE 
"Shame," by Salman Rushdie, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 317 pp.
Indian novelist Salman Rushdie's first novel, "Midnight's
Children," was greeted with fainting fits of praise by
British and American critics and won the 1981 Booker Prize
(for best Commonwealth novel). When a first novel is
received that way, chances arc the writer has tapped into
some vein of nostalgia, and such was the case with
"Midnight's Children."
Rushdie's allegorical history of post-colonial India was
picaresque and packed with detail, and it mewed along on
floods of brilliantly colorful — it often overwrought
prose. Appearing at a time when fiction in Einglish is
dominated by small, carefully crafted, emotionally thin
work, "Midnight's Children" seemed big (which it was —
more than 400 pages), colorful and energetic by contrast.
Rushdie was quickly stuck with the label "magic realist"
and pigeonholed as the English-speaking world's Gabriel
Garcia Marquez. It wasn't a comparison Rushdie deserved
— Rushdie's prose was so baroque as to be unreadable, and
his humor was completely unlike Garcia Marquez's: ironic
and biting, never gentle, it became deadening after 400
pages. "Shame," Rushdie's second novel, is a more con
trolled effort: The satire is focused, the narrative pull
strong, the prose taut when it needs to be. There is still a
deadness to the book — an inability to squeeze emotion
into the brilliant technique — but there's no denying that
Rushdie has learned how to channel his enormous talents.
"Shame" is also more openly political than "Midnight's
Children." l ike the earlier novel, it is docu-drama history,
this time of Pakistan, Rushdie's family's adopted
homeland. (Rushdie himself lives in London.) Central to the
story arc the barely fictionalized histories of various Pakis
tanis, including Ayub and Yahya Khan, Xulfikar Ali Bhutto
and Mohammad Xia ul-Haq. Ihe political novel has been
ignored by writers in English, and Rushdie's models for
"Shame" have been Eastern European writers like Borowski
and Konrad and Kundera. He infuses their techniques of
irony and absurdity with an energy that often seems to have
been drained out of the critics of communist regimes; for
this alone, "Shame" is worth reading.
