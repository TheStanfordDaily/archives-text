# Reduced price for Macintosh hurts college area retailers
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
Half-price personal computers
may sound like a good deal — but
not necessarily to competing local
computer dealers.
I he Apple Macintosh computer
will be made available to students
and affiliated faculty here for
about half of its original $2500
price. The Apple consortium
agreement, which also involves 24

other colleges around the country,
will go into effect April 3.
Students here appear excited
about the program, but local and
nationwide dealers say their busi
nesses will suffer as a result.
"Potential customers obviously
aren't going to buy a Macintosh
computer from me now," the
manager of Affordable Computer
Systems in Santa Clara said.
"There's no point in trying to
compete."
According to Rick Weir, presi
dent of the Complete Computer
Center in Ann Arbor. Mich., the
consortium agreement has had "a
very bad influence on the retail
market" in the vicinity of colleges
included in the consortium.
"The Macintosh is a wonderful
machine that could have sold it
self. They (Apple) are really
taking awav the cream of the
retail market, and are alienating
people not privy to the Univer
sit\'s program as well as surround
ing dealers." he said.
Weir said that he is having
trouble stay ing in business because
the University of Michigan's pro
gram has already taken over 600
deposits for the Macintosh; in ad
dition. Weir has been allocated
only 10 Maeintoshs per month.
"Nobody questions that stu
dents should be given a price
break, but the program should not
compete with the private sector
for retail business. Many comput
er companies around here are

going out of business.
"The program is ;i reminder th;it
life is neither perfect nor fair. We
are not trying to gouge people,
hut just want fair competition,
he said.
Bruce Corn, senior sales consul
tant for University Business
Machines in Philadelphia, voiced
similiar dissatisfaction with the
consortium agreement.
"It's going to take business
away from us — a lot of business.
We did a lot of selling to the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, but their
pricing is well below dealer cost,
and we can't compete."
"Every dealer in the country has
complained about this. Apple's
niche has always been the educa
tional market, if they are going to
take over, it's going to hurt us
considerably. This is my livelihood
. . . Apples are our bread and but
ter." he said.
However, several Apple dealers
in the vicinities ol Stanford and
Brown universities maintain that
they will not be adversely af
fected by the agreement.
According to Ed Macßeth.
manager of Mission computers in

Palo Alto, the computer market
here is large enough to com
pensate for any, potential lack of
sales.
"We're still selling far more
Macs than we can get our hands
on. We have 4 people waiting now.
150 more wouldn't make any dif
ference. We couldn't sell any more
than we had." Macßeth said.
"A lot of kids wouldn't be
buying from me anyways because
of the price." said Richard
Kramer, a computer store
manager 111 Providence. R.I.
"I don't sell that much to
Brown (University), and we don't
yet know the status of future
software sales " he said.
Kramer did say. however, that
he felt that the consortium
should have gone into effect at a
later date.
"My major complaint is that
they should have waited until
summer or tall. The idea of selling
to the university doesn't bother
me. but I wish they would have
given dealers more of a chance
beforehand." he said.
