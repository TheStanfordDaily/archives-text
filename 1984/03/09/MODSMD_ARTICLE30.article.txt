per and Row, 97 pp., $11.95.
"Abner lived with his passion as with
a trustworthy enemy." Working as a
shepherd through the lambing season
and the passage to the high pastures, he
held his weakness in check until sum
mer, when he would leave the ranch at
which he'd worked that year and go to
spend his savings on the annual bout of
drunkenness. Respectful of his vice,
Abner was a steady hand during the
year and a good man with animals.
Abner had just lost another job when
Eric Hoffer met him. At the Brewster
ranch Abner had discovered "the
wonder sheep, Joel." Abner knew that
sheep have more distinct personalities
than most people imagine, but never
had he encounted an animal like Joel.
Alert and faithful as Abner's own dog.
Fuzzy, Joel had leadership potential
that Abner hoped to develop. But that
year Abner's weakness overcame him
early, and he got drunk on the job.
Brewster was undersanding but firm.
He told Abner to go to Sacramento and
mingle with people, to rid himself of his
loneliness and his craving for liquor. Ab
ner left, commending Fuzzy and Joel to
the rancher's care.
Eric Hoffer was one of the people
Abner met in Sacramento. He
befriended the drunk and listened to
his tale. Hoffer says he found Abner's
life interesting, and patiently heard
him ramble for weeks, but he doesn't
offer a full explanation for his attrac
tion to the man. Their strange
friendship continued until, one day,
Abner spotted Joel on a car of sheep in
the train station yard. Abner tried hys
terically to free his fleecy friend, but
was halted by policemen and railway
workers. Hoffer concludes the story
laconically: "Next day, when I tried to
see him. I was told that he was trans
fered to a nuthouse in Stockton."
What is this bizarre anecdote doing in
the middle of the autobiography of
Eric Hoffer, San Francisco's famous
longshoreman-philosopher, author of
"The True Believer" and other books?
Sharing space with quite a few similarly
peculiar stories, is the answer. Hoffer's
colorful life is highlighted, in his
memory, by a number of encounters
that show a consistent pattern of sym
pathy for the out-of-luck, but which
also betray an odd attraction to misfits
and helpless dropouts.
Hoffer, who died only last year, leapt
into fame with the publication of "The
True Believer" in 1951. In it he studied

the characteristics common to partici
pants in those mass movements whose
crusader ideals demand unquestioning
obedience and deep identification with
the group and its cause. The book at
tracted attention for its insight, per
suasiveness and learned reference, but
it earned a special renown because its
author was a longshoreman who had
never graduated from high school and
had spent much of his life as a migrant
worker. Hoffer continued to work on
the docks, but also published many
books until his death.
"Truth Imagined," a brief autobiog
raphy, covers the period up to his
leaving the road and settling down in
San Francisco "to help win the war."
The life it describes is intriguing and en
tertaining, but the story does not
enable us to appreciate why Hoffer
chose his strange way of life when he
had so many opportunities to "settle
down."
Precocious as a child, Hoffer learned
to read before the age of five, but was

struck by a mysterious blindness at
seven, which just as mysteriously
cleared up when he was 15. Con
vinced that his recovered vision would
soon be lost again, he began reading
widely and voraciously. As it turned
out, Hoffer retained his vision, but the
pattern of constant reading and self
education maintained itself through
out his life.
The way Hoffer supported himself
on odd jobs is accounted for in part by
his conviction that he would die early,
as most of his family had. Moving to
California, he worked at menial tasks
and changed jobs often, despite tre
quent opportunities to settle down to
a career promising advancement and
achievement. I sense, however, a deeper
reason â€” one that also influences the
frequent tales of his encounters with
people on the road.
A persistent diffidence about his
own talents and a refusal to take a
chance on failure prevented Hoffer
from adopting a professional attitude

towards his reading and writing. Early in
the biography he revels in his indepeiT
dence and freedom from long-term
commitments: "I was a ladybird ainontj
ants." Living for a year on his savings;
he read and read, but not towards any
project beyond education. He con
cluded that when his money ran out, hij
would kill himself.
Hoffer's description of his decision
and the aborted suicide that followed
is, like all his stories, compact. It shares
with many of the anecdotes a reticence
defended by a bluff factualness anq
directness that conceals any emotional
struggle that might have been depen-.
dent on his meditiations.
Although Hoffer was evidently a
sensitive and compassionate man, he
refuses in the biography to examine the
relationships between feelings and
thoughts. At times capable of being ex
ceedingly impulsive and intuitive. Hot
ter separates this side of himself trom
the reflective activities he reserves for
the world of books. He cultivates a sort
of bizarre incuriosity towards both his
own and other people's motivations.
Hoffer's rejection of suicide was
based on an impulse, "the sudden vision
of life as an endless road." He
abandoned his relatively settled lite of
menial work in the city for travels
guided by the planting and harvesting
seasons. The biography embarks on a se
ries of episodic encounters which in
clude a love affair of several months
that Hoffer deals with in a mere seven
pages. Though the following chapter
begins, "It took me years to recover
from my break with (Helen)." the
detachment with which the relation
ship is described and the factual, unaf
fecting contents of the story prevent
one from making contact with Hoffer's
feelings.
Perhaps this is as Hoffer wished.
"Truth Imagined" is a charming book,
and it does inspire a degree of warmth
for Hoffer, principally because of the
optimistic disposition that comes
through so consistently in its pages.
But Hoffer was a loner at heart, and
though one can infer this from the way
he tells his life story, it does not come
to the fore. If it had, the account
might have been more self-revealing,
but at the same time more alienating,
as Hoffer's basic diffidence came
through. The way Hoffer deals with his
readers in "Truth Imagined" follows
the pattern of the way he dealt with
people he met in real life.
