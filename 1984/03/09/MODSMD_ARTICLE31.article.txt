## Crucial scene unbelievable 'Carmen' slow as dance film 
### JIM TASSOPULOS 
Carlos Saura's Carmen has some great
moments. It explodes with energy and
passion in several marvelous dance num
bers. I he physical performances of the
lovers, played by Antonio Gades and
Laura del Sol. convey the intensity ol
the tale ot love and jealousy which they
arc playing out. Still, apart from the
five or six dance numbers which unify
the film. I found most of Carmen to be
uninvolving, even tedious.
fhe story centers around Antonio, a
dancer choreographer who is creating
and starring in a new production of Car
men's story, combining elements of
Prosper Merimee's novella and Bi/et's
opera He looks in vain tor Ins leading
lady among his group of expert dancers.
Then he spots a young dance student,
named Carmen, and lie decides that she
is perfect for the role. Antonio falls in
love with the real life Carmen as he at
tempts to transform her into the char
acter she is to play.
We see their relationship develop as
they work in private on their roles and
in public on the rehearsal stage. The
dance numbers are choreographed by
Gades. Roth the intimate numbers,
where Carmen and Antonio dig deeper
into their roles while also expressing
their passion for each other, and the
large rehearsal numbers, are very effec
tive. (Jades' choreography is striking
and his dancing is powerful, both
technically and dramatically. Del Sol's
face conveys beautifully the wildness
and seducti\eness of Carmen.
Fhe private scenes are full ot passion
and pain. The larger numbers are full ol
cnerj:\ and excitement. The tobacco
factory number gives the first half ot
the film a much-needed burst of ener
gv. Another number which begins with a

poker game and ends in a duel with
canes between Antonio and Carmen's
real-life husband bristles with anger and
pride.
One wishes that the rest of Carmen,
the verbal acting and the progression of
the story, had any of the powerful
emotions described above. The blurring
of the fictional and real life stories is
essential to the tilm's dramatic con
cerns. This tension works well in the
dance numbers as Antonio and Ca r men

The blurring of the
fictional and real life
stories is essential to the
film's dramatic concerns.
This tension works well in

Antonio and Carmen

other's pleasure.

rehearse a key scene or simply dance for
each other's pleasure.
I lowever, the problem with the film
is that most of the scenes between the
dance numbers, where characters inter
act 011 an ordinary dramatic level, do
not help us to better understand these
people who are beginning to become
their fictional counterparts. These pas
sionate individuals, when they talk to
each other, become either boring or
pretentions. Some of the back stage
scenes gi\e the film what little humor

it has. but they too become tedious
after a while.
The film seems to take forever to get
going as Saura spends a good ileal of
time depicting the early rehearsals tor
the production. The meeting of An
tonio and Carmen injects some life into
the film, but only when they are dan
cing. The dramatic scenes between the
two seem awkward and cliche.
In the second halt of the film, some
interest can be taken in the gradual
merger of the fictional and real life
stories. However, one never under
stands the characters fully: conse
quently one rtCver understands what
causes them to become submerged in
their tictional roles. Antonio's obses
sion with Carmen, his constant identifi
cation of her with the character she is
playing, registers effectively at times.
However, the dialogues between the
two principals, instead of building on
the energy of the dunce sequences,
seem to drag the film down.
I he real-lite Carmen never becomes a
lull character. By the time her final
meeting with Antonio occurs, her words
seem preposterous, and this crucial
scene is unbelievable.
In the finale, the film turns again to
its fictional material, ending on a very
strong note. However, without a better
understanding of the modern charac
ters, without a strong screenplay to go
along with the abstract story of passion
and jealousy, the film is not a satisfying
dramatic experience.
Carmen, an Academy Award nominee
tor Best Foreign Language film, may
have enough strong sequences to make
it worth a look, provided one can over
look and sit through everything that
comes in between its moments of beau
ty and power.
