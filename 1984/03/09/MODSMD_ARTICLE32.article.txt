# Madness doesn't live up
## 
### KARL JOHNSEN 
Hie Kabuki nightclub has always been one of
my favorite places to see concerts. It's large
enough to provide big-name talent, yet main
tains an intimate atmosphere that keeps the
performers in touch with their audience. You
can eat excellent meals at the theater before
performances, and they provide ample seating
on both the main floor and on the balcony. If
you're in the mood to slam, swing or sway, there
is enough floor space in front of the stage to
fully indulge yourself, and there's always enough
people there so you don't feel like you're dan
cing by yourself. In fact, the biggest complaint
anyone could have is that their shows are usually
sold out.
Normally when I go to review a concert. I will
dutifully remain at my seat, frantically scrib
bling notes and impressions which I later decip
her with great difficulty as I try to formulate
my critique. Somehow, when I entered the club
this time, that scenario seemed too sterile, too
removed, too aloof.
Seeing a large crowd, ready to party to such an
upbeat band as Madness, made it impossible to
remain an observer. I had to participate, and I
wanted to be right up in front of the stage,
prepared to do whatever it would take me to get
there. An experienced-based study on crowd
management, you might call it.
On entering the theater. I was directed to the
sides (the center was already packed). So, to gain
the best vantage point, I moved down to the
dance floor. Surprisingly, a large part of the
crowd left during the break before Madness was
to come onstage, presumably in expectation of a
long line at either the bar or the restroom.
This left me in a good position to move in
close. I got about 15 feet from the stage, and
resolved not to let anyone push me back. Just
before the band went onstage, the floor filled
and space got tighter and tighter. (Visions of
The Who concert in Cincinnati came to mind.)
Pressure would surge from behind as people
would try to move forward, but ali that resulted
was aggravation and physical discomfort. As
some would tire of the continuous fight to stay
standing, they would leave. Those in back would
sense more space in front, and would push more
excitedly. It was a vicious circle.

As you probably have already interred Iron
my observations, the band was not particularly
interesting, but it definitely engendered mad
ness.
On vim I. Madness is a slickly produced banc
with a great deal of energy and cohesiveness. Al
though they recreated the polish they have ir
their studio work, their performance lacked a
sense of drive. Communication among them
selves — especially considering they are a seven
man band — was superb, but they were unable to
shake a trite, contrived mood.
A good example of this was during the song.
"'Tempted." The stage lights dimmed and a
spotlight fell on the keyboard player, as the rest

of the band left the stage. He sang and played
well, but the mood of the song was tainted by
cliche. It was as il they had to say. "Hey. guys,
here's our slow song."
The concert had its high points, though. In
"Our House," they displayed their capacity tor
spark and enthusiasm. It was typical of the
tight-knit feel the band has. That song and
"Madness (It's All in Your Mind)" were un
doubtedly the best performed tunes of the eve
ning.
The rest of the show was strangely
monotonous, with one song sounding similar to
the next, and no exciting change of tempo until
the very end. It was disappointing to see such a
talented hand play relatively uninspiredly until
the very end. Perhaps the crowd (myself in
cluded) was underexposed to the group and had
trouble reacting to unfamiliar music, but that
couldn't fully explain the lack of innovation on
their part. It still remains the responsibility of
the band to lire up the audience, not vice versa.
The night and the theater were marvelous. It's
too bad the band wasn't as consistent.
