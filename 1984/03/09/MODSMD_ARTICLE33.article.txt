Ninotchka (1939)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This wonderful comedy has
some of the most memorable
moments in any film of its
epoch: the scene in which the
amorous Parisian (dashing Mel
vyn Douglas) tells the Russian
visitor, Ninotchka (Greta
Garbo), that he has an irresist
ible desire to flirt with her and
she replies, "Suppress it"; the
scene in which he gives her
champagne for the first time;
the scene in which he gets her
to laugh. Garbo gives a warm,
deeply felt performance as the
young woman sent by the So
viet government to reclaim
jewels currently in the posses
sion of an imperial emigre
(played with extraordinary
finesse by Ina Claire) — after
the original emissaries (Sig
Rumann, Alexander Granach
and Felix Bressart) have suc
cumbed to the temptations of
heady Parisian bourgeois living.
The screenplay by Charles
Brackett, Billy Wilder and Wal
ter Reisch (from a Melchior
Lengyel story) manages to sus
tain a tone that is at once
mocking and romantic, and the
director, Ernst Lubitsch, has
never seemed so completely,
humanly in control — except,
perhaps, in the following year's
The Shop Around the Comer.
With Bela I.ugosi.
Plays Monday with Design for
Living.
Throne of Blood (1957)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Both Orson Welles and
Roman Polanski have had a
fling at filming Macbeth, but
Akira Kurosawa's samurai ver
sion is much closer to the spirit
of the play. Toshiro Mifune and
the amazing Machiko Kyo star;
her hand-washing scene is so
terrifyingly obsessive that it
transcends the barriers of lan
guage. period and style. It is
unlikely that any director in any
medium has ever caused Birnam
Wood to come so magically to
Dunsinane.
Plays Tuesday with The Seven
Samurai.
Tess (1980)
New Varsity. Palo Alto
If any talented director is all
wrong for Thomas Hardy, its
Roman Polanski: He's a super
lative technician but a listless
storyteller. This picture is
beautifully made, and it con
tains moments of unusual
grace; it has formidable pho
tography by the late Geoffrey
Unsworth and Ghislain Clo
quet, and a full, resonant score
by Philippe Saide. But it lacks
tbik a JLOJT\a nu.c.,sweQP.. „
and Polanski dinrsn't convey the
Victorian social landscape
clearly enough to make sense of
the book. As Tess, Nastassia
Kinski does well with her early
scenes, but the more complex
the character reveals herself to
be, the more evident it becomes
that Kinski doesn't have the
equipment to handle her. With
small, solid performances by
Rosemary Martin as Tess'
mother and Carolyn Pickles as
Marian. Peter Firth plays Angel
Clare; Leigh Lawson is Alec.
Plays Sunday with The French
l ieutenant's Woman.

High Noon (1952)
Kresge Auditorium
In this famous Carl Foreman-
Fred Zinnemann "adult" west
ern, civic responsibility finds
laconic expression in the mar
shal (Gary Cooper) who, on his
wedding day, must face the
forces of chaos and destruction
(a vengeful gunslinger) all by
himself. The film's point of
view is simplistic, its method
pedantic, its "classical"
structure — it observes a radi
cally restricted version of the
unity of time, with the story
and the running time corres
ponding absolutely — mere ar
tifice, and even the actors
aren't especially good, except
for Lloyd Bridges and Katy
Jurado. But Fred Zinnemann is
such a meticulous craftsman
that the movie is compelling
anyway. Grace Kelly plays
Cooper's Quaker bride, and
Thomas Mitchell, Lee Van
Cleef, Henry Morgan, Lon
Chaney, Jr. and Otto Kruger
also appear. Tex Ritter sings
the well-known theme song by
Dmitri Tiomkin, which begins.
"Dy not forsake me, oh my dar
ling, on this my wedding day
Plays tonight at 9.
Uptown Saturday Night
(1974)
Cubberley Auditorium
Sidney Poitier directed this
umpteenth variation on Rene
Clair's sturdy old Le Million; in
this version, the performers
looking for lost money are all
black. It's a pretty clumsy film,
with an unnervingly high num
ber of close-ups, and Poitier's
really wrong for the central role
— he's much too good for this
kind of broad, eye-rolling com
edy — but he's assembled such a
winning cast that the movie
drifts by amiably. Flip Wilson,
Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby,
Rosalind Cash, Roscoe Lee
Browne, Paula Kelly and Calvin
Lockhart all show up. and so
does Harry Belafonte as a black
Don Corleone. (He's virtually
unrecognizable.)
Plays tonight at 7 & 9.
Giant (1956)
Festival, Palo Alto
Adapting an Edna Ferber
novel about, qil.and.aristocracy
in Texas, director George
Stevens confuses length with
epic scope: The movie rolls on
for 3 hours and 20 minutes, but
there isn't a convincing mo
ment in it. It's entertaining,
though, in a slick, fraudulent
1950s way. and James Dean
(who was dead by the time it
was released) gives a wry. in
ventive performance as the bad
boy who strikes it rich. His act
ing has a spark of genius in it;
When he finds out he's become
oil-wealthy, he celebrates by
balancing on a piece of pipe, and
vears later you still remember

the self-amused look on his
face. Rock Hudson and
Elizabeth Taylor, who have the
real leads, fare much worse, and
in the last scenes they wear the
most preposterous age make
up, perhaps, in the history of
Hollywood soap operas. Taylor
looks exquisite for most of the
movie, however, and she's shot
with such tenderness that you
wonder if the photographer,
William C. Mellor, was in love
with her (like everyone in the
audience is). Written by Fred
Guiol and Ivan Moffat; with a
huge cast including Mercedes
McCambridge, Carroll Baker,
Chill Wills, Jane Withers, Den
nis Hopper, Sal Mineo. Rod
Taylor, Judith Evelyn, Earl Hol-
Iman and Alexander Scourby.
Plays through Wednesday.
Cabaret (1972)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Bob Fosse directed this al
together amazing musical, set
in Berlin in 1931. Inspired by
the kabarett-form satirical
musicals of Kurt Weill and Ber
tolt Brecht, Fosse uses the
numbers performed by Liza
Minnelli and Joel Grey at the
Kit Kat Klub to comment on
the political and social milieu
and on the character of Sally
Bowles, the desperately life
embracing, ultimately self
destructive gamine Minnelli
plays. Musicals don't come
much better than this one,
which is stunningly directed,
shot (by Geoffrey Unsworth),
choreographed (by Fosse, of
course), scored (by John Kander
and Fred Ebb) and designed.
Minnelli and Grey give classic
performances, and there's one
brilliant number after another
— "Mein Herr" (Fosse's tribute
to Marlene Dietrich and The
Blue Angel), "Money," "If You
Could See Her," "Cabaret,"
and the shocking sequence at
the beer garden, in which the
most haunting ballad in the
score, "Tomorrow Belongs to
Me," explodes into a Nazi an
them. Michael York plays the
young writer based loosely on
Christopher Isherwood, whose
"Berlin Stories" were the original
source for both the stage and
screen version of Cabaret.
Screenplay by Jay Presson Allen
with Hugh Wheeler.
Plays Sunday with All That
~3azz.
All That Jazz (1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Perhaps the most dazzling
display of ego ever attempted
by a motion picture director.
Roy Scheider gives a solid, ener
getic performance as Joe
Gideon (read Bob Fosse), a mu
sical comedy wizard who is run
ning himself down by
simultaneously rehearsing a
Broadway show (read Chicago),
editing a big-budgeted movie
(read Lenny), and keeping up
warm relationships with his

mistress (Ann Reinking), his ex
wife and leading lady (Leland
Palmer) and his daughter
(Erzsebet Foldi). while indulg
ing in occasional flings with
aspiring starlets. Although he
philanders, he can't seem to
help himself: Everywhere he
goes, women fling themselves
at him. Besides, he's so talented.
Bob Fosse directed and
choreographed this musical
drama about himself, and his
gifts are everywhere in evidence
— it's beautifully made, and
two of the numbers (the
opening and the erotic piece)
are classics — but the entire
project may give you pause.
Giuseppe Rotunno did the su
perior cinematography.
Plays Sunday with Cabaret.
Design for Living (1933)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Ben Hccht boasted that in
adapting Noel Coward's scan
dalous comedy about a roman
tic triangle, he kept only one
line of the original dialogue.
Nonetheless, it is a marvelous
movie, directed by Ernst
Lubitsch in his best souffle
style. The lovers in question are
played by Fredric March,
Miriam. Hopkins and Gary
Cooper — who tries hard but
the role is out of his range —
and their permanently indig
nant friend is the incomparable
Edward Everett Horton.
Plays Monday with
Ninotchka.
Gregory's Girl (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bill Forsyth wrote and di
rected this very slight comedy
about the agonies of adoles
cence just before he made
Local Hero, and you can see
that he hadn't got it right yet.
Scenes wobble, the acting is al
most unbelievably inconsistent,
the camera tends to get stuck
in the wrong corners and he
can't figure out how to sustain
the awkward young hero's story
longer than an hour, so the
picture fizzles out. But For
syth's lovely, loopy sense of
humor and his eye for telling
comic detail signal you that
great things lie ahead. Also,
this may be the first comedy
about teenagers that gets so
much mileage out of the differ
ences between boys and girls at
that age. Gordon John Sinclair
plays the impossibly tall, gawky
Gregory.
Plays Monday with Puberty
Blues.
The Seven Samurai (1954)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spec
tacular adventure, set amid the
civil wars in 16th-century
Japan. A community of farm
ers, slowly starving under the
double burden of land taxes and
the raids of brigands, hires

Reviews by Steve Vineberg

samurai to protect them, and
swords really start to fly. The
characters have a funny, foolish
braggadocio, and the actors
(Toshiro Mifune, Takashi
Shimura, Yoshi Inaba, etc.) give
stylized performances reminis
cent of the silent comedies.
The real star, of course, is
Kurosawa, who displays the
kind of witty mastery of film
technique that still makes
audiences grin. N. 8.: This is the
full-length version of the film.
Flays Tuesday with Throne of
Blood.

Vertigo (1958)
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A richly suggestive narrative
(by Alec Coppel and Samuel
Taylor, out of a novel by Pierre
Boileau and Thomas Narcejac),
Kim Novak's other-worldly
beauty in the first half, the
heady Bernard Herrmann music
and the hypnotic camerawork in
the most famous sequences is
so powerful, on a pop level,
that Alfred Hitchcock's lauded
mystery retains an eerie,
seductive romanticism. The
film's devotees see in its flirta
tion with perversion
(necrophilia, death wish) a
trenchancy the picture simply
doesn't possess; it isn't
Freudian at all, really — it's
Freudly. Starring James
Stewart, but Barbara Bel
Geddes does most of the act
ing.
The French Lieutenant's Wo
man (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
As John Fowles' mystery wo
man, Sarah Woodruff, Meryl
Streep gives a remarkably artic
ulate performance, but her
mastery of technique is so
clearly evident that it becomes
the theme of her scenes. Karel
Reisz directed this chilly, split
movie from Harold Pinter's
screenplay; in an attempt to
find a filmic equivalent to the
commentary chapters in
Fowles' novel, Pinter has pro
vided a modern story about the
filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman, filled with
the elliptical dialogue that is his
specialty, but Reisz's heart
doesn't seem to be in these
scenes — they're flat, and after
a while they begin to seem in
trusive. The period sequences
are beautifully finished,
however, and exquisitely shot
by Freddie Francis. Reisz coaxes
admirable work from Jeremy
Irons, Patience Collier, Leo
McKern, Hilton Mcßae, Emily
Morgan. Toni Palmer and hir
Smith.
Plays Sunday with Tesx.

really wrong for the central role
— he's much too good for this
kind of broad, eye-rolling com
edy — but he's assembled such a
winning cast that the movie
drifts by amiably. Flip Wilson,
Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby,
Rosalind Cash, Roscoe Lee
Browne, Paula Kelly and Calvin

does Harry Belafonte as a black

Giant (1956)
Festival, Palo Alto
Adapting an Edna Ferber
novel about, qil.and.aristocracy
in Texas, director George
Stevens confuses length with
epic scope: The movie rolls on
for 3 hours and 20 minutes, but
there isn't a convincing mo
ment in it. It's entertaining,
though, in a slick, fraudulent
1950s way. and James Dean
(who was dead by the time it
was released) gives a wry. in
ventive performance as the bad
boy who strikes it rich. His act
ing has a spark of genius in it;
When he finds out he's become
oil-wealthy, he celebrates by
balancing on a piece of pipe, and
vears later you still remember

the self-amused look on his
face. Rock Hudson and
Elizabeth Taylor, who have the
real leads, fare much worse, and
in the last scenes they wear the
most preposterous age make
up, perhaps, in the history of
Hollywood soap operas. Taylor
looks exquisite for most of the
movie, however, and she's shot
with such tenderness that you
wonder if the photographer,
William C. Mellor, was in love
with her (like everyone in the
audience is). Written by Fred
Guiol and Ivan Moffat; with a
huge cast including Mercedes
McCambridge, Carroll Baker,
Chill Wills, Jane Withers, Den
nis Hopper, Sal Mineo. Rod
Taylor, Judith Evelyn, Earl Hol-
Iman and Alexander Scourby.
Plays through Wednesday.
Cabaret (1972)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Bob Fosse directed this al
together amazing musical, set
in Berlin in 1931. Inspired by
the kabarett-form satirical
musicals of Kurt Weill and Ber
tolt Brecht, Fosse uses the
numbers performed by Liza
Minnelli and Joel Grey at the
Kit Kat Klub to comment on
the political and social milieu
and on the character of Sally
Bowles, the desperately life
embracing, ultimately self
destructive gamine Minnelli
plays. Musicals don't come
much better than this one,
which is stunningly directed,
shot (by Geoffrey Unsworth),
choreographed (by Fosse, of
course), scored (by John Kander
and Fred Ebb) and designed.
Minnelli and Grey give classic
performances, and there's one
brilliant number after another
— "Mein Herr" (Fosse's tribute
to Marlene Dietrich and The
Blue Angel), "Money," "If You
Could See Her," "Cabaret,"
and the shocking sequence at
the beer garden, in which the
most haunting ballad in the
score, "Tomorrow Belongs to
Me," explodes into a Nazi an
them. Michael York plays the
young writer based loosely on
Christopher Isherwood, whose
"Berlin Stories" were the original
source for both the stage and
screen version of Cabaret.
Screenplay by Jay Presson Allen
with Hugh Wheeler.
Plays Sunday with All That
~3azz.
All That Jazz (1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Perhaps the most dazzling
display of ego ever attempted
by a motion picture director.
Roy Scheider gives a solid, ener
getic performance as Joe
Gideon (read Bob Fosse), a mu
sical comedy wizard who is run
ning himself down by
simultaneously rehearsing a
Broadway show (read Chicago),
editing a big-budgeted movie
(read Lenny), and keeping up
warm relationships with his

mistress (Ann Reinking), his ex
wife and leading lady (Leland
Palmer) and his daughter
(Erzsebet Foldi). while indulg
ing in occasional flings with
aspiring starlets. Although he
philanders, he can't seem to
help himself: Everywhere he
goes, women fling themselves
at him. Besides, he's so talented.
Bob Fosse directed and
choreographed this musical
drama about himself, and his
gifts are everywhere in evidence
— it's beautifully made, and
two of the numbers (the
opening and the erotic piece)
are classics — but the entire
project may give you pause.
Giuseppe Rotunno did the su
perior cinematography.
Plays Sunday with Cabaret.
Design for Living (1933)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Ben Hccht boasted that in
adapting Noel Coward's scan
dalous comedy about a roman
tic triangle, he kept only one
line of the original dialogue.
Nonetheless, it is a marvelous
movie, directed by Ernst
Lubitsch in his best souffle
style. The lovers in question are
played by Fredric March,
Miriam. Hopkins and Gary
Cooper — who tries hard but
the role is out of his range —
and their permanently indig
nant friend is the incomparable
Edward Everett Horton.
Plays Monday with
Ninotchka.
Gregory's Girl (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bill Forsyth wrote and di
rected this very slight comedy
about the agonies of adoles
cence just before he made
Local Hero, and you can see
that he hadn't got it right yet.
Scenes wobble, the acting is al
most unbelievably inconsistent,
the camera tends to get stuck
in the wrong corners and he
can't figure out how to sustain
the awkward young hero's story
longer than an hour, so the
picture fizzles out. But For
syth's lovely, loopy sense of
humor and his eye for telling
comic detail signal you that
great things lie ahead. Also,
this may be the first comedy
about teenagers that gets so
much mileage out of the differ
ences between boys and girls at
that age. Gordon John Sinclair
plays the impossibly tall, gawky
Gregory.
Plays Monday with Puberty
Blues.
The Seven Samurai (1954)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spec
tacular adventure, set amid the
civil wars in 16th-century
Japan. A community of farm
ers, slowly starving under the
double burden of land taxes and
the raids of brigands, hires

Reviews by Steve Vineberg

samurai to protect them, and
swords really start to fly. The
characters have a funny, foolish
braggadocio, and the actors
(Toshiro Mifune, Takashi
Shimura, Yoshi Inaba, etc.) give
stylized performances reminis
cent of the silent comedies.
The real star, of course, is
Kurosawa, who displays the
kind of witty mastery of film
technique that still makes
audiences grin. N. 8.: This is the
full-length version of the film.
Flays Tuesday with Throne of
Blood.

Vertigo (1958)
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A richly suggestive narrative
(by Alec Coppel and Samuel
Taylor, out of a novel by Pierre
Boileau and Thomas Narcejac),
Kim Novak's other-worldly
beauty in the first half, the
heady Bernard Herrmann music
and the hypnotic camerawork in
the most famous sequences is
so powerful, on a pop level,
that Alfred Hitchcock's lauded
mystery retains an eerie,
seductive romanticism. The
film's devotees see in its flirta
tion with perversion
(necrophilia, death wish) a
trenchancy the picture simply
doesn't possess; it isn't
Freudian at all, really — it's
Freudly. Starring James
Stewart, but Barbara Bel
Geddes does most of the act
ing.
The French Lieutenant's Wo
man (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
As John Fowles' mystery wo
man, Sarah Woodruff, Meryl
Streep gives a remarkably artic
ulate performance, but her
mastery of technique is so
clearly evident that it becomes
the theme of her scenes. Karel
Reisz directed this chilly, split
movie from Harold Pinter's
screenplay; in an attempt to
find a filmic equivalent to the
commentary chapters in
Fowles' novel, Pinter has pro
vided a modern story about the
filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman, filled with
the elliptical dialogue that is his
specialty, but Reisz's heart
doesn't seem to be in these
scenes — they're flat, and after
a while they begin to seem in
trusive. The period sequences
are beautifully finished,
however, and exquisitely shot
by Freddie Francis. Reisz coaxes
admirable work from Jeremy
Irons, Patience Collier, Leo
McKern, Hilton Mcßae, Emily
Morgan. Toni Palmer and hir
Smith.
Plays Sunday with Tesx.

Ninotchka (1939)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This wonderful comedy has
some of the most memorable
moments in any film of its
epoch: the scene in which the
amorous Parisian (dashing Mel
vyn Douglas) tells the Russian
visitor, Ninotchka (Greta
Garbo), that he has an irresist
ible desire to flirt with her and
she replies, "Suppress it"; the
scene in which he gives her
champagne for the first time;
the scene in which he gets her
to laugh. Garbo gives a warm,
deeply felt performance as the
young woman sent by the So
viet government to reclaim
jewels currently in the posses
sion of an imperial emigre
(played with extraordinary
finesse by Ina Claire) — after
the original emissaries (Sig
Rumann, Alexander Granach
and Felix Bressart) have suc
cumbed to the temptations of
heady Parisian bourgeois living.
The screenplay by Charles
Brackett, Billy Wilder and Wal
ter Reisch (from a Melchior
Lengyel story) manages to sus
tain a tone that is at once
mocking and romantic, and the
director, Ernst Lubitsch, has
never seemed so completely,
humanly in control — except,
perhaps, in the following year's
The Shop Around the Comer.
With Bela I.ugosi.
Plays Monday with Design for

Throne of Blood (1957)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Both Orson Welles and
Roman Polanski have had a
fling at filming Macbeth, but
Akira Kurosawa's samurai ver
sion is much closer to the spirit
of the play. Toshiro Mifune and
the amazing Machiko Kyo star;
her hand-washing scene is so
terrifyingly obsessive that it
transcends the barriers of lan
guage. period and style. It is
unlikely that any director in any
medium has ever caused Birnam
Wood to come so magically to
Dunsinane.
Plays Tuesday with The Seven
Samurai.
Tess (1980)
New Varsity. Palo Alto
If any talented director is all
wrong for Thomas Hardy, its
Roman Polanski: He's a super
lative technician but a listless
storyteller. This picture is
beautifully made, and it con
tains moments of unusual
grace; it has formidable pho
tography by the late Geoffrey
Unsworth and Ghislain Clo
quet, and a full, resonant score
by Philippe Saide. But it lacks
tbik a JLOJT\a nu.c.,sweQP.. „
and Polanski dinrsn't convey the
Victorian social landscape
clearly enough to make sense of
the book. As Tess, Nastassia
Kinski does well with her early
scenes, but the more complex
the character reveals herself to
be, the more evident it becomes
that Kinski doesn't have the
equipment to handle her. With
small, solid performances by
Rosemary Martin as Tess'
mother and Carolyn Pickles as
Marian. Peter Firth plays Angel
Clare; Leigh Lawson is Alec.
Plays Sunday with The French
l ieutenant's Woman.

High Noon (1952)
Kresge Auditorium
In this famous Carl Foreman-
Fred Zinnemann "adult" west
ern, civic responsibility finds
laconic expression in the mar
shal (Gary Cooper) who, on his
wedding day, must face the
forces of chaos and destruction
(a vengeful gunslinger) all by
himself. The film's point of
view is simplistic, its method
pedantic, its "classical"
structure — it observes a radi
cally restricted version of the
unity of time, with the story
and the running time corres
ponding absolutely — mere ar
tifice, and even the actors
aren't especially good, except
for Lloyd Bridges and Katy
Jurado. But Fred Zinnemann is

project may give you pause.
Giuseppe Rotunno did the su

Plays Sunday with Cabaret.
Design for Living (1933)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Ben Hccht boasted that in
adapting Noel Coward's scan
dalous comedy about a roman
tic triangle, he kept only one
line of the original dialogue.
Nonetheless, it is a marvelous
movie, directed by Ernst
Lubitsch in his best souffle
style. The lovers in question are
played by Fredric March,
Miriam. Hopkins and Gary
Cooper — who tries hard but
the role is out of his range —
and their permanently indig
nant friend is the incomparable
Edward Everett Horton.
Plays Monday with
Ninotchka.
Gregory's Girl (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bill Forsyth wrote and di
rected this very slight comedy
about the agonies of adoles
cence just before he made
Local Hero, and you can see
that he hadn't got it right yet.
Scenes wobble, the acting is al
most unbelievably inconsistent,
the camera tends to get stuck
in the wrong corners and he
can't figure out how to sustain
the awkward young hero's story
longer than an hour, so the
picture fizzles out. But For
syth's lovely, loopy sense of
humor and his eye for telling
comic detail signal you that
great things lie ahead. Also,
this may be the first comedy
about teenagers that gets so
much mileage out of the differ
ences between boys and girls at
that age. Gordon John Sinclair
plays the impossibly tall, gawky
Gregory.
Plays Monday with Puberty
Blues.
The Seven Samurai (1954)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spec
tacular adventure, set amid the
civil wars in 16th-century
Japan. A community of farm
ers, slowly starving under the
double burden of land taxes and
the raids of brigands, hires

Reviews by Steve Vineberg

samurai to protect them, and
swords really start to fly. The
characters have a funny, foolish
braggadocio, and the actors
(Toshiro Mifune, Takashi
Shimura, Yoshi Inaba, etc.) give
stylized performances reminis
cent of the silent comedies.
The real star, of course, is
Kurosawa, who displays the
kind of witty mastery of film
technique that still makes
audiences grin. N. 8.: This is the
full-length version of the film.
Flays Tuesday with Throne of
Blood.

Vertigo (1958)
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A richly suggestive narrative
(by Alec Coppel and Samuel
Taylor, out of a novel by Pierre
Boileau and Thomas Narcejac),
Kim Novak's other-worldly
beauty in the first half, the
heady Bernard Herrmann music
and the hypnotic camerawork in
the most famous sequences is
so powerful, on a pop level,
that Alfred Hitchcock's lauded
mystery retains an eerie,
seductive romanticism. The
film's devotees see in its flirta
tion with perversion
(necrophilia, death wish) a
trenchancy the picture simply
doesn't possess; it isn't
Freudian at all, really — it's
Freudly. Starring James
Stewart, but Barbara Bel
Geddes does most of the act
ing.
The French Lieutenant's Wo
man (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
As John Fowles' mystery wo
man, Sarah Woodruff, Meryl
Streep gives a remarkably artic
ulate performance, but her
mastery of technique is so
clearly evident that it becomes
the theme of her scenes. Karel
Reisz directed this chilly, split
movie from Harold Pinter's
screenplay; in an attempt to
find a filmic equivalent to the
commentary chapters in
Fowles' novel, Pinter has pro
vided a modern story about the
filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman, filled with
the elliptical dialogue that is his
specialty, but Reisz's heart
doesn't seem to be in these
scenes — they're flat, and after
a while they begin to seem in
trusive. The period sequences
are beautifully finished,
however, and exquisitely shot
by Freddie Francis. Reisz coaxes
admirable work from Jeremy
Irons, Patience Collier, Leo
McKern, Hilton Mcßae, Emily
Morgan. Toni Palmer and hir
Smith.
Plays Sunday with Tesx.

Ninotchka (1939)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This wonderful comedy has
some of the most memorable
moments in any film of its
epoch: the scene in which the
amorous Parisian (dashing Mel
vyn Douglas) tells the Russian
visitor, Ninotchka (Greta
Garbo), that he has an irresist
ible desire to flirt with her and
she replies, "Suppress it"; the
scene in which he gives her
champagne for the first time;
the scene in which he gets her
to laugh. Garbo gives a warm,
deeply felt performance as the
young woman sent by the So
viet government to reclaim
jewels currently in the posses
sion of an imperial emigre
(played with extraordinary
finesse by Ina Claire) — after
the original emissaries (Sig
Rumann, Alexander Granach
and Felix Bressart) have suc
cumbed to the temptations of
heady Parisian bourgeois living.
The screenplay by Charles
Brackett, Billy Wilder and Wal
ter Reisch (from a Melchior
Lengyel story) manages to sus
tain a tone that is at once
mocking and romantic, and the
director, Ernst Lubitsch, has
never seemed so completely,
humanly in control — except,
perhaps, in the following year's
The Shop Around the Comer.
With Bela I.ugosi.
Plays Monday with Design for
Living.
Throne of Blood (1957)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Both Orson Welles and
Roman Polanski have had a
fling at filming Macbeth, but
Akira Kurosawa's samurai ver
sion is much closer to the spirit
of the play. Toshiro Mifune and
the amazing Machiko Kyo star;
her hand-washing scene is so
terrifyingly obsessive that it
transcends the barriers of lan
guage. period and style. It is
unlikely that any director in any
medium has ever caused Birnam
Wood to come so magically to
Dunsinane.
Plays Tuesday with The Seven
Samurai.
Tess (1980)
New Varsity. Palo Alto
If any talented director is all
wrong for Thomas Hardy, its
Roman Polanski: He's a super
lative technician but a listless
storyteller. This picture is
beautifully made, and it con
tains moments of unusual
grace; it has formidable pho
tography by the late Geoffrey
Unsworth and Ghislain Clo
quet, and a full, resonant score
by Philippe Saide. But it lacks
tbik a JLOJT\a nu.c.,sweQP.. „
and Polanski dinrsn't convey the
Victorian social landscape
clearly enough to make sense of
the book. As Tess, Nastassia
Kinski does well with her early
scenes, but the more complex
the character reveals herself to
be, the more evident it becomes
that Kinski doesn't have the
equipment to handle her. With
small, solid performances by
Rosemary Martin as Tess'
mother and Carolyn Pickles as
Marian. Peter Firth plays Angel
Clare; Leigh Lawson is Alec.
Plays Sunday with The French
l ieutenant's Woman.

High Noon (1952)
Kresge Auditorium
In this famous Carl Foreman-
Fred Zinnemann "adult" west
ern, civic responsibility finds
laconic expression in the mar
shal (Gary Cooper) who, on his
wedding day, must face the
forces of chaos and destruction
(a vengeful gunslinger) all by
himself. The film's point of
view is simplistic, its method
pedantic, its "classical"
structure — it observes a radi
cally restricted version of the
unity of time, with the story
and the running time corres
ponding absolutely — mere ar
tifice, and even the actors
aren't especially good, except
for Lloyd Bridges and Katy
Jurado. But Fred Zinnemann is
such a meticulous craftsman
that the movie is compelling
anyway. Grace Kelly plays
Cooper's Quaker bride, and
Thomas Mitchell, Lee Van
Cleef, Henry Morgan, Lon
Chaney, Jr. and Otto Kruger
also appear. Tex Ritter sings
the well-known theme song by
Dmitri Tiomkin, which begins.

Uptown Saturday Night
(1974)
Cubberley Auditorium
Sidney Poitier directed this
umpteenth variation on Rene
Clair's sturdy old Le Million; in
this version, the performers
looking for lost money are all
black. It's a pretty clumsy film,
with an unnervingly high num
ber of close-ups, and Poitier's
really wrong for the central role
— he's much too good for this
kind of broad, eye-rolling com
edy — but he's assembled such a
winning cast that the movie
drifts by amiably. Flip Wilson,
Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby,
Rosalind Cash, Roscoe Lee
Browne, Paula Kelly and Calvin
Lockhart all show up. and so
does Harry Belafonte as a black
Don Corleone. (He's virtually
unrecognizable.)
Plays tonight at 7 & 9.
Giant (1956)
Festival, Palo Alto
Adapting an Edna Ferber
novel about, qil.and.aristocracy
in Texas, director George
Stevens confuses length with
epic scope: The movie rolls on
for 3 hours and 20 minutes, but
there isn't a convincing mo
ment in it. It's entertaining,
though, in a slick, fraudulent
1950s way. and James Dean
(who was dead by the time it
was released) gives a wry. in
ventive performance as the bad
boy who strikes it rich. His act
ing has a spark of genius in it;
When he finds out he's become
oil-wealthy, he celebrates by
balancing on a piece of pipe, and
vears later you still remember

the self-amused look on his
face. Rock Hudson and
Elizabeth Taylor, who have the
real leads, fare much worse, and
in the last scenes they wear the
most preposterous age make
up, perhaps, in the history of
Hollywood soap operas. Taylor
looks exquisite for most of the
movie, however, and she's shot
with such tenderness that you
wonder if the photographer,
William C. Mellor, was in love
with her (like everyone in the
audience is). Written by Fred
Guiol and Ivan Moffat; with a
huge cast including Mercedes
McCambridge, Carroll Baker,
Chill Wills, Jane Withers, Den
nis Hopper, Sal Mineo. Rod
Taylor, Judith Evelyn, Earl Hol-
Iman and Alexander Scourby.
Plays through Wednesday.
Cabaret (1972)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Bob Fosse directed this al
together amazing musical, set
in Berlin in 1931. Inspired by
the kabarett-form satirical
musicals of Kurt Weill and Ber
tolt Brecht, Fosse uses the
numbers performed by Liza
Minnelli and Joel Grey at the
Kit Kat Klub to comment on
the political and social milieu
and on the character of Sally
Bowles, the desperately life
embracing, ultimately self
destructive gamine Minnelli
plays. Musicals don't come
much better than this one,
which is stunningly directed,
shot (by Geoffrey Unsworth),
choreographed (by Fosse, of
course), scored (by John Kander
and Fred Ebb) and designed.
Minnelli and Grey give classic
performances, and there's one
brilliant number after another
— "Mein Herr" (Fosse's tribute
to Marlene Dietrich and The
Blue Angel), "Money," "If You
Could See Her," "Cabaret,"
and the shocking sequence at
the beer garden, in which the
most haunting ballad in the
score, "Tomorrow Belongs to
Me," explodes into a Nazi an
them. Michael York plays the
young writer based loosely on
Christopher Isherwood, whose
"Berlin Stories" were the original
source for both the stage and
screen version of Cabaret.
Screenplay by Jay Presson Allen

All That Jazz (1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Perhaps the most dazzling
display of ego ever attempted
by a motion picture director.
Roy Scheider gives a solid, ener
getic performance as Joe
Gideon (read Bob Fosse), a mu
sical comedy wizard who is run
ning himself down by
simultaneously rehearsing a
Broadway show (read Chicago),
editing a big-budgeted movie
(read Lenny), and keeping up
warm relationships with his

mistress (Ann Reinking), his ex
wife and leading lady (Leland
Palmer) and his daughter
(Erzsebet Foldi). while indulg
ing in occasional flings with
aspiring starlets. Although he
philanders, he can't seem to
help himself: Everywhere he
goes, women fling themselves
at him. Besides, he's so talented.
Bob Fosse directed and
choreographed this musical
drama about himself, and his
gifts are everywhere in evidence
— it's beautifully made, and
two of the numbers (the
opening and the erotic piece)
