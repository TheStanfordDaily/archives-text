# Lawyer speaks on pedophilia laws
## Advocates child's right to choose 
### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer 
Children are capable of giving in
formed consent to sexual relations
with adults, and the law should allow
them to do so. Dr. Edward Bron
gersma of the Netherlands told an
audience of approximately 50 last
night in the History Corner.
Brongersma said that children
should be protected against sexual
acts which involve violence, abuse of
authority or occur against the will of
the child. However, as a result of ex
tensive research on pedophilia —
sexual relations between children and
adults — Brongersma claims to have
found that relationships conducted
with the child's consent can bring
happiness to both the child and the
adult.
Brongersma's speech addressed the
legal and social aspects of pedophilia.
Brongersma was a member of the
Dutch National Parliament for 22
years, and now directs the Bron
gersma Foundation for Research into
Youth Sexuality. As a member of the
Dutch senate, he was instrumental in
the repeal of a Dutch law prohibiting
homosexual relations between adults
and minors and lowering the age of
consent for such acts to 16.
Brongersma had served a 10-month
prison term under the old statute for

engaging in a consenting relationship
with a 16-year-old boy. He was
debarred and forced to resign from
the senate, but was later re-elected.
Brongersma said that children are
capable of giving informed consent.
"1 think a child can know very well if
it wants to be touched in a certain
way," he said, and added that sexual
activity with a young person should
be adapted to the child.
Ihe topic of pedophilia had
generated a great deal of controversy
prior to the speech, according to
Gerard Koskovich, a spokesman for
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (GLAS), who sponsored
the talk along with the Stanford Gay
and Lesbian Law Students' Associa
tion.
Koskovich said that GLAS had
received a number of phone calls
from people who were concerned
about the subject of the talk. All of
the calls were anonymous and many
were hostile.
"All the callers that have been
complaining or hostile have been wo
men," Koskovich said.
One female caller threatened to
appear with a number of representa
tives of women's groups to protest
the speech. However, no such protest
occurred.
