## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy announced the creation of a
committee to plan the Ronald
Reagan Library Complex at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
The panel, according to a memo
distributed by Kennedy to potential
members, will be "charged with re
sponsibility for recommending to me
a detailed plan for the siting and
physical configuration of the Ronald
Reagan Library."
In his memo, Kennedy listed thir
teen separate issues he wanted the
panel to address. Some of these in
clude:
• What is the scope of the
"Presidential papers" that will by law
become part of the archive?
• What will be the rights and
privileges of the staff of the Ronald
Reagan Library? Are they all federal
employees?
• What will be the relationship be
tween fund raising for the Ronald
Reagan Library and Stanford's own
fund raising?
• What financial arrangements must
be established in advance with the
Ronald Reagan foundation for
transfer of funds?
Kennedy announced that Robert
Freelen, vice president for public af
fairs. will head the committee, but
said he would not release the names
of the other committee members un
til they accept their posts.
In a related move, the Faculty Sen
ate decided to reaffirm its Dec. 1
resolution concerning the Reagan
policy center, which stated that the

center should be organized "within
the University's normal academic
structure."
The resolution in its final form
declared that the December decision
also applied to the "compromise" of
fered by Meese. which the senate
steering committee described as "a
proposal to have a center organized
independently of Stanford and func
tioning merely as a lessee."
There was some discussion among
faculty members about whether or
not the University had an obligation
to oversee the political activities of
its lessees. Education Prof. Denis
Phillips said he felt that "the owner
of a property is morally obliged to
make sure that the land it leases is
used for purposes it thinks are
reasonable.
"An academic institution has the
obligation to make sure other insti
tutions set up on its land are run in
ways that tit in with its academic ob
ligation," he said.
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy countered that perhaps
Stanford should oversee the political
institutions in Palo Alto as well,
since Stanford used to own that
land.
Both McCarthy and Law Professor
John Merryman seemed to be more
concerned with the logistics of the
still-controversial policy center pro
posal than with the senate's reaction
to that proposal. Merryman said he
felt the compromise was an attempt
to "smuggle in" the policy center.
"This is just an attempt by Meese
to accomplish what the Uni\ersity
has told them the\ cannot.
