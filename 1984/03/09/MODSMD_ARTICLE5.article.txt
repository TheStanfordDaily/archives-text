Greece says Turkey shelled ship
\thens, Greece — Greece accused Turkish destroyers of
shelling a Greek naval vessel and fishing boat in the nor
thern Aegean Sea yesterday and ordered Turkey's ambassa
dor to leave the country in a sudden worsening of relations
between the two neighboring NATO states.
I urkey charged that the Greek ships had entered an an
nounced artillery practice zone and it said it "suspected"
Cireece of attempting to provoke an incident to bolster ef
forts by Greek supporters in the U.S. Congress to cut the
Reagan administration's planned increase in military aid to
Turkey.
Although no injuries or damage were reported in the early
morning shelling incident, it marked a sharp deterioration in
relations between the two strategically placed countries on
the southeastern Hank of the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization.
Following years of running disputes over territorial rights
in the air and sea. tensions between Turkey and Greece have
flared in recent months over Turkey's support of Turkish
Cyprus' unilateral declaration of independence and U.S.
plans to increase military aid to Turkey but not to Greece.
Greece placed its military on alert shortly after the inci
dent as did the Greek-allied government in Cyprus.
Iran claims Iraqi island control
lehran, Iran — Iran claimed again yesterday that it was
still in control of Iraq's oil-rich Majnoon Islands and said its
forces killed or wounded "a large number" of Iraqis in a
nearby night-time attack, official Tehran radio reported.
Speaker of Parliament Hojatollislam Hashemi Rafsanjani
told the state-run radio after a meeting of Tehran's Su
preme Defense Council that the Iranian assault took place
at Shahid Hamid Bridge, south of the Majnoon Islands.
He offered no details or casualty figures, nor did he
repeat earlier assertions that Iran was considering keeping
the oil-rich Majnoon area north of Basra in eastern Iraq to
cover reparations payments demanded of Baghdad.
Ratsanjani originally proposed such a move Sunday.
In London, meanwhile, Britain protested formally to Iraq
against an Iraqi missile attack on the British ship Charming
during a trip through the Gulf to Iran, the government an
nounced.
A spokesman said Iraq's ambassador in London was
summoned to the Foreign Office to receive the protest,
which the government lodged after learning that two of
the Charming's crew members were injured and the ship it
self severely damaged in the raid.
Baghdad has claimed responsibility for the attack, which
took place March 1 when an Iraqi helicopter fired a French
made Exocet missile at the freighter in Iranian waters. Four
other vessels in convoy with the Charming reportedly also
were damaged.
PLO troops return to Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — Hundreds of Palestinian guerrillas
have been returning to Beirut and its southern suburbs
lrom the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in eastern
Lebanon but are being kept on a short leash by Shiite Mos
lem militias, guerrillas and militiamen said yesterday.
The guerrillas are allowed into the capital and the refugee
camps south of it only if thev are unarmed, are dressed in ci
vilian clothes and agree to surrender their identity cards in
exchange for a visiting pass issued by Amal, members of the
Shiite militia and Palestinian guerrillas said in interviews.
Guerrillas from several Palestinian fighting units dis
played Amal visiting passes ranging in term from 48 hours
to two months, and said that after spending time with
their families here or dealing with personal affairs they
would return to their bases in eastern Lebanon and take up
arms again there.
But they insisted they had brought no weapons with
them and had no intention of engaging in resistance activ
ity while visiting here.
Their statements contrasted sharply with allegations by
the Israeli army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Moshe Levy, and
other Israeli officials that 2000 armed Palestinian guerrillas
who left Beirut in the summer of 1982 have infiltrated
back to Beirut and its environs to engage in terrorist activ
ity.
Senate panel bows on cuts
and taxes to interest groups
Washington — Special-interest groups are beginning to
eat into Congress' efforts to reduce looming federal
deficits through spending cuts and tax increases.
The Senate Finance Committee began yesterday to water
down a previously adopted provision to restrict tax breaks
for real estate. And it reversed an earlier vote in favor of
killing some of the tax breaks for businesses that buy luxury
cars.
The Senate Agriculture Committee, meanwhile, rejected
the administration's proposed freeze on crop support prices
in favor of other cuts that would save only about two
thirds as much.
"The lobbyists are changing votes faster than I can," said
Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) chairman of the Finance Com
mittee and a leading member of the Agriculture Commit
tee.
In the Senate, most of the lobbying so far has been in
Dole's two committees because they have acted first in the
congressional effort to reduce federal deficits, which by
most estimates will remain near their record level of about
$200 billion a year for the next three years or more.
Calif, legislators support Hart
Washington — Three congressmen, two of whom direct a
powerful Democratic fund-raising apparatus in California,
endorsed presidential contender Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.)
yesterday and said they were willing to lend their consider
able financial and organizational network to his campaign.
The endorsement came from California Reps. Henry
Waxman. Howard Berman and Mel Levine, all of Southern
California.
"We do not see the difference between Walter Mondale
and Gary Hart as one of principle or philosophy, but rather
one of thrust, style, effectiveness and electability against
Ronald Reagan." Waxman said in a statement for the three
congressmen. They had previously endorsed Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) who last week dropped out of the race
for the nomination.
What could be more significant than the endorsements
themselves is the muscle of what has come to be known in
California as the "Berman-Waxman connection" — perhaps
the state's most sophisticated political network of money
and organization, including access to huge mailing lists of
the names of likely campaign contributors.
