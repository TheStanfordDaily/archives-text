From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — Attorney General-designate Edwin
Meese said yesterday that he cannot recall receiving a
strategy memo from inside the 1980 Jimmy Carter
re-election campaign and denied that he knew o! any
effort by the Reagan-Bush campaign to obtain such
material.
In response to written questions submitted by Sen
ate Judiciary Committee members. Meese cited a De
partment of Justice conclusion last month that there
was no credible evidence that a crime had been com
mitted when the Carter debate briefing papers
showed up in the Reagan camp.
He added that he did not condone obtaining
private information by improper means.
Meese submitted the written responses as the com
mittee held over until next Thursday a vote on his
confirmation, sparking a charge by Sen. John East (R-
N.C.) that committee Democrats were on "a gigantic
fishing expedition."
Several Democrats on the committee protested
that they had not yet received Meese's answers to
questions raised at the end of four days of hearings.
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) committee chairman.

tried to detuse the confrontation by noting that any
committee member can obtain a one-week delay
without citing a reason.
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) the chief op
ponent on the panel to confirmation, contended the
Carter campaign documents sent Meese constitute
evidence he was very, very much involved" in using
the materials. Meese rejected a suggestion by Met
zenbaum that he come back tor more questioning,
saying that he saw no inconsistencies raised bv the
new material.
I he documents, released by Metzenbaum Wednes
day. included a 1980 strategy memo prepared for top
operatives ot Carter's re-election campaign and sent
to Meese with a cover note from Reagan campaign
otticial Max Hugel: another document that proposed
a meeting between Reagan and Gen. Richard Ellis,
who was then chief ot the Strategic Air Command, in
order "to blow Jimmy Carter out of the water." and a
memo on "'I he Carter Plan for the Black Vote," sent
to Meese by William l immons. a Washington lobbyist
and Reagan campaign aide.
Alter Meese denied any memory of seeing the ma
terial that Metzenbaum made public Wednesday, the

senator yesterday released another batch of docu
ments. including one dated Sept. 12, to Meese
from his aide Robert Garrick.
The document said in part that Reagan campaign
manager William Casey, who is now ( 1A director,
"wants more information from the Carter camp and
wants it circulated." I here was no elaboration in the
two-page memo on what Casey wanted or how he pro
posed it be acquired.
Casey has repeatedly denied he conducted an
intelligence-gathering operation during the campaign
and that he ever saw any material acquired from the
Carter campaign. He has said that he would not have
touched such material "with a 10-toot pole.
The latest documents, like the earlier ones, were
obtained from a House Post Ottice and C ivil Service
subcommittee that has been investigating the Carter
briefing papers case and plans to issue its conclusions
by next month.
In responding to Metzenbaum's questions yester
day, Meese said that if confirmed, lie would take no
part in the Department of Justice's consideration of
whether to seek appointment of a special prosecutor
in the briefing papers matter.
