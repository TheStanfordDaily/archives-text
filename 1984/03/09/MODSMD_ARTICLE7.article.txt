# Senate rebuffs Reagan on aid proposals
## 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — In a sharp rebuff to
President Reagan, the Republican-led
Senate Appropriations Committee yes
terday rejected an amendment to pro
vide $21 million for covert aid to
Nicaraguan rebels and postponed con
sideration of almost $94 million in new
military funds for El Salvador.
The State Department had attempt
ed to attach the funding proposals to
two unrelated bills, one to help poor
people pay winter heating bills and an
other for emergency food aid to Africa,
in order to circumvent the Democratic
controlled House of Representatives.
"We want the matter considered by
Congress promptly," White House
spokesman Larry Speakes said before
the Senate panel's action. "The presi

dent feels we're at a critical juncture in
Central America. We need more fun
ding in the very near term or we're
going to face a dangerous deterioria
tion."
He said that EI Salvador's army was
already running short of supplies with
only weeks remaining before a March 25
presidential election, which leftist
guerrillas could attempt to disrupt.
But despite the White House appeal,
three Republicans joined with
Democrats to turn down the covert aid
by a vote of 15 to 14. The panel then
agreed unanimously to put off the Sal
vadoran issue until next week.
"Whatever the committee does, this
issue will finally be settled on the floor
and in conference (with the House),"
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) the com

mittee's chairman, told reporters after
the session.
But the episode demonstrated that
the administration's Central American
aid program might run into trouble
even in the Republican-controlled Sen
ate.
"If the State Department is going to
manage the remaining Central Ameri
can activities the way they've managed
this operation, I guarantee they're
going to fail," warned Sen. Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.) another powerful
Republican. "I feel sorry for the presi
dent of the United States."
A State Department official ac
knowledged that the administration
was having difficulties with
Republicans as well as Democrats. "Our
problems aren't bipartisan; they're still

unipartisan." he said.
It the Salvadoran aid is blocked in
both houses, he said. Reagan can still
send it without congressional approval
under a law that allows the president to
sell weapons abroad without demanding
immediate payment.
But the administration has no such
breathing room on its aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels. The last time
Congress approved funds for that pro
gram, it prohibited any further spend
ing without explicit approval.
So intent was the White House on
winning approval of the funds that it
came closer than ever before to publicly
acknowledging the officially secret
covert aid program.
