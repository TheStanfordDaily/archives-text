In 1886, following a shipwreck off the west coast of Africa, an infant
child became part of a famiiy of apes who raised and protected him.
As he grew, he learned the laws of the jungle and eventually claimed
the title, Lord of the Apes.
Yet, years later, when he was returned to civilization, he would remain
uncertain as to which laws he should obey... those of man...
or those of the jungle.
Now, the director of "Chariots of Fire" captures this epic adventure
of a man caught between two different worlds.
