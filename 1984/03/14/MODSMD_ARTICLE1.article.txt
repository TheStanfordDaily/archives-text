# The 						spoils of Super Tuesday
## Super Tuesday mixes it up 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Senior staff writer With wire reports 
Yesterday's Super Tuesday
series of caucuses and primaries
has left Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart's campaign with an increased
momentum, former Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale backers
with renewed confidence and
former South Dakota Sen.
George McGovern supporters
with no candidate.
Hart made an unpredicted
strong showing in the South â€”
winning Florida, which has 143
delegates, the largest number of
any Southern state. Hart
decisively won in Rhode Island and
Massachusetts despite Mondale's
reputedly strong labor support in
New England.
Mondale's backing proved ef
fective in securing Georgia and
Alabama. Ohio Sen. John Glenn

finished second in Alabama with
Hart running third. In Georgia the
race was much closer, with Hart
just behind Mondale and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson finishing third. But
because delegates are selected by
precinct. Hart received more
delegates than Mondale.
With the race narrowing to two
candidates, McGovern honored his
pledge to withdraw from the race
if he did not finish second in Mas
sachusetts. "I fully accept the
verdict of my very special friends,
the voters of Massachussetts," he
said as the results became known.
Massachussetts was the only state
McGovern carried in his 1972 bid
for the presidency.
According to Richard Deck,
campus coordinator of Califor
nians for Glenn, the chances of
Glenn remaining in the race are
slim. "Glenn is $2 million in debt.
It (yesterday's) results hold up, he

won't be able to raise any money
. . . .Glenn also has an ethical obli
gation to withdraw because it is
shaping-up to a two person race."
And according to a Glenn aide,
the Ohio senator could decide on
the future of his debt-ridden
campaign today.
Jackson vowed to continue his
campaign, "to the end and
beyond" as the "conscience" of
the Democrats. The 20 percent of
the vote Jackson won in Georgia
was critical in assuring his entitle
ment to federal campaign sub
sidies.
Hart's recent victories have
provided a boost for his national
campiagn which has been mirrored
here on campus. According to
Matt Schwartz, one of the core
members of the Stanford Hart
organization, "We have a mailing
list of 200 people, probably even


Mondale and Hart were tied at 41 percent in Oklahoma
more by now."
Hart's appeal to students,
according to Schwartz, has ac
counted for the succcss of local
organizational efforts and will
continue to he an important
factor.
The nucleus of campus Glenn
supporters recognize the
similarities between Hart and
Glenn. "Ninety to 95 percent
of us will go to Hart if Glenn
withdraws tomorrow," accor
ding to Deck. Both Glenn and
Hart have very similar voting
records, they both appeal to
Independents and moderate
and conservative Democrats
besides a core group of liberal
supporters.
But Glenn supporters are
not the only ones comparing
their candidate to Hart. Ac
cording to Eric Diesel, chair
man of the campus Mondale
supporters, Mondale and Hart
"agreed on 86 percent of
votes."
"If you take away hair-styles
and look at action, Mondale
has a clear edge," Diesel said.
"Mondale will be concentrating
on issues," he said.
These are the vote totals as of
early this morning:
In I lorida, Hart was captur
ing 40 percent of the vote to
Mondale's 33 percent. In Massa
chusetts, it was Hart 40 percent,
Mondale 26 percent. In Rhode
Island, virtually complete, Hart
had 45 percent and Mondale 35.
Alabama was delivering 34
percent to Mondale, Glenn was
second narrowly ahead of Hart,
both at 21 percent. In Georgia, it
was Mondale with 31 percent.
Hart 28 percent, as the count
neared completion.
l our states held caucuses, and
in Oklahoma Hart and Mondale
were running neck and neck at
41 percent each, with 84 percent
reporting early this morning.
Hart was leading in partial
returns in Washington and
Nevada, and results from
Hawaii's caucus were not ex
pected until later today.
In a caucus in American
Samoa, Democrats committed
their six delegates to Mondale.
