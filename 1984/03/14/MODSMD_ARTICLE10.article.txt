# A 						private matter
## 
### 
Prayer is a very private thing. So private, in
fact, that President Reagan chooses to eschew
church attendance because of the security risk
he poses to other church-goers. Reagan hasn't
been to church since June, 1983. He says he
"misses" going to church but seems to be con
tent to pray in the seclusion of his home.
Reagan and a coterie of "pious" law-makers
don't mind playing politics with other peoples'
right to pray privately, however. The president
is putting top priority on the passage of an
amendment to the Consitution that would
severely limit the Supreme Court's ability to
regulate prayer in schools.
In a number of rulings, the court has at
tempted to maintain a separation between the
state, as embodied in the public school system,
and organized religion. The court has ruled that
any mandatory prayer, or moment of silence, vi
olates constitutional provisions against state
entanglement in the religious realm. In addition,
the court ruled that school prayers impinge
upon religious freedom of exercise guaranteed
by the First Amendment.
We couldn't agree more with the court's
rulings. Public prayer, usually Christian, means
an unnecessary imposition of one religion on the

many Jewish, Moslem, agnostic and atheist
children in the classroom.
We are left wondering why Reagan and his
cohorts feel a need to impose their particular
type of prayer on their fellow Americans. Many
pious people, who attend church at least as reg
ularly at the president, oppose Reagan's crusade
to pass the amendment because they agree that
prayer is, indeed, a private matter.
None of the court's rulings prohibits students
from praying privately, or even gathering to
gether to pray informally. They can pray on the
way to school, after school, at home, at church,
in fact, just about any time they want. No law
needs to force prayer on anyone or even a time
for prayer.
Proponents of school prayer were heartened
by the Supreme Court's recent 5-4 decision that
a Nativity scene in Pawtucket, R. 1., does not
promote religion, but instead "depicts the his
torical origins" of Christmas. The decision,
released during the lengthy and divisive debate
on the school prayer amendments, is a frighten
ing indication that the increasingly conservative
court, if it chooses to review its past decisions,
may be willing to impinge upon the rights of
those who prefer prayer to be a private matter.
