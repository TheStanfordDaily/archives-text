# It's Dead Week insanity

Dead Week. Shit.
Yes, it's that happy time of the
quarter again. Tensions rise, stress
becomes a tangible, living thing and
nerves begin to crack. Dead Week has
a way of making people into twisted,
delirious derelicts. I can feel it in the
air, even as 1 write this: Brain cells
are rebelling and mutating as people
focus narrowly, to the exclusion of
all else, on (shhh, don't say this too
loudly) studying
I saw it happen to the best and
brightest the other day. In a pre-
Dead Week feeding frenzy of moral
degradation and demented folly, I
saw a guy come out into the hall and
say "Anyone for Ultimate?" Doors
burst open and we all stood there,
mouths agape, scarcely hiding our
revulsion and pity. It was a fascina
tion with the macabre. We had heard
it could happen, but of course, it
never happens to you or anyone you
knew. But there he was, a friend of
yours, infected with the insidious
disease.
He knew, instantly, what he had
done, and what it meant. They took
him away as he was alternately mum
bling feeble apologies and yelling,
pleadingly, "But I do want a nice job
. . . But 1 do want to study! I do want
to help humanity — 1 want money
It was a sorry sight, hard to take.
What was harder was the damning
knowledge that it could happen to
any one of us. 1 mean, we're all
supposed to study during Dead
Week, aren't we? isn't it expected
that we stir-fry our brains and. un
dergo self-subjugation? Don't we
just shut our minds off to everything
except the books we haven't opened
yet, the material we allegedly knew
for the midterm but still have yet to
look at? Come on, we have to have
nice jobs and wealth. We need to
serve humanity. And we can't do it
all unless we study during Dead
Week, close off the real world, and
make The Grade. So, it's a normal
situation to be anxious, tense, ner
vous, ulcer-ridden worshippers of the
Study God.
Ah yes, the Study God. One sees it
every quarter: Throngs of devotees
saddle their shoulders with sherpa
proven backpacks to make the trek
like pilgrimages to the Holy Temple
of Meyer and to the Sacred Shrine of
Green — two of the holiest and most
divine places in the world. Only
Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem have
more significance. Indeed, on the

Sunday eve of Dead Week, the most
devout line up outside the doors,
eagerly awaiting their chance to wor
ship Study God, hoping that he will
provide the blissful afterlife. Yes,
say yes brethren; if you are a faithful
adherent. Study God promises the
afterlife replete with the coveted
Nice Job upon Judgment, er, I mean
Graduation Day. If you are a blas
phemous, heretical non-believer,
then away and be banished to
AM/PM Mini Mart graveyard shifts!
Dead Week . . .
And what is Dead Week? What is
the nature of this thing that evokes
on one hand such religious zeal and on
the other such psychopathic
depravity? What is this beast, and
why the name "Dead Week"? Other
institutions have similar things, but
they call them "Reading Periods" or
somesuch.
But we have Dead Week. Dead
Week? Dead? Was the week ever
alive?
1 also think students and the
professorial clergy should have the
guts to face up to what Dead Week,
in reality, really is and call it as such:
"Catch-Up-Sucker-If-You-Can
Week." How about, "Where-Is-
That-Stupid-Drop-Card Week?" Or
" I -Didn't-Wan t-To-Graduate-On -
Time-Anyway Week?" Come on,
who's kidding whom' 1
Not only is this time of the quar
ter marked by terrible psychosis and
blind, lustful Study God worship, it is
also the Time of New Ouarter
Resolutions. How many times have
you heard the words: "Next quarter,
I'm going to start early and never get
behind." or "I'll never get this far be
hind again ever?" Poor, naive fresh
men.
Like Dirty Harry says, a man's
gotta know his limitations (women
included, of course). Similarly, a
man's gotta face facts: When the
heat is off, so is the incentive to
study. My dad used to tell me about
the foxhole Christians in World War
11. Alone in a foxhole, facing a hos
tile enemy and imminent death, a lot
of people very understandably
started praying to God, making
promises to go to church regularly if
only God would get them out of
their predicament. Alone in a library,
facing a hostile enemy and imminent
"death," a lot of people start
praying to Study God, making prom
ises to go to the library regularly.
You won't fool Him. He knows the
storv. But he might let you slide
anyway, depending on the amount of

attention you give Him during Dead
Week.
For some, Dead Week isn't really
dead. Exams and assignments have
been scheduled during this holy time,
interfering with the execution of the
obeisances due the Study God. For
example, pity the poor Chem 31 stu
dents, confronted with a midterm
Monday. Pity the Comp Sci 105 A
fools, their path to divinity blocked
by a program due Friday. Study God
wants to see a furious mad rush to
catch up for finals, and NOT a
relatively mild hysteria caused by les
ser ordeals.
He may not look kindly on this sort
of thing, so beware his wrath: He
may dole out a "B" to you. Your
hopes to have the Nice Job or the
Good Life could be dashed forever.
We won't discuss what could happen
if his anger got to the point where he
would assign a (gasp) "C." It could
mean the end of the civilized world as
we know it. . . . Well, maybe not.
Just a few days ago, I spent a few
hours in the Stanford Emergency
Room with a friend. We were waiting
for a friend to get fixed up. He was
OK, hut while waiting there I saw a
lot of life go by. Expectant mothers,
nauseous and anxious, were put in
wheelchairs while the nervous fathers
flailed madly. One asked the orderly
if ho should turn off h i't 'cfiVwhilo rTnV
arm twitched uncontrollably.
All this while an obviously dis
traught woman waited, bent over
with face buried deep in her hands,
for word on her husband. Somehow
the once boggling array of pages to
be read and tests to be taken didn't
mean that much anymore. Barring
real tragedy, life will go on. For
others, it won't. I'm lucky: All 1 real
ly have to worry about is grades.
As for them. I figured that I'll do
my best and leave it at that. Even it I
don't make The Grade, I still can
have all the best in life, and do what 1
really want to do — if I want it bad
enough. "All the best in life" is a
very subjective thing, after all.
Strangely enough, the fact that
life will go on is so easy to forget. It
is too easy to take oneself too
seriously.
Somehow, when I placed myself in
the larger context of real life and
real death. Dead Week, and all the
concomitant fears about the future,
didn't seem so ominous.
