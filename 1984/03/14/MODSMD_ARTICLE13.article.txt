## Religion's hollow victory in Pawtucket 
### 
On Monday, March 5, the U.S. Supreme Court
upheld, by a narrow 5-4 vote, the Pawtucket,
R. 1., practice of publicly financing and construc
ting Christian Nativity scenes. The cost involved,
about $1300 taken out of public municipal
funds, might seem small next to the $200 billion
federal budget deficit, but the principle involved
was not.
It is unfortunate, therefore, that the Supreme
Court saw fit to trample on that principle, and

VIEWPOINT

to deface the Constitution which has endured in
this country for more than 200 years now. The
essence of Chief Justice Warren Burger's
majority opinion was that Pawtucket was doing
nothing more than "taking note of a significant
historical religious event,"and that this
"secular" motive justified the expenditure. Whe
ther Burger actually expects anyone to believe
this tripe is less important than what this kind of
judicial "reasoning" can do to the principle of
separation of church and state reflected in the
First Amendment's ban on any law "respecting
an establishment of religion."
If the patently religious nature of a symbol
such as the creche can be overridden by simply
"discovering" some farfetched shred of "secular
purpose," then, as Justice Wiley Rutledge said in
a 1 947 case, "The constitutional provision could
always be brought to nought by adding a
modicum of the secular." The majority's uncon
vincing rehash of this long-discredited view of
the Establishment Clause is bad enough. But
Burner goes further. The -fears" which led the

framers to adopt the Establishment Clause, he
says, are of little or no "concern" today. With
this breathtaking admission, the majority lets on
what it is really doing: judicially repealing the Es
tablishment Clause itself.

"secular historical celebration." They intended
to "put Christ back in Christmas" and were quite
frank about it.
The ugly spectacle of religions scrabbling bit
terly for state support and "their share" of the
public's tax money was precisely the "fear" of
the framers which Burger now blithely dismisses
with a wave of the hand. Burger's fatuous asser
tion that these evils are now past was belied the
very day after the decision was announced, as
newspapers immediately began speculating about
when Jewish religious groups would start de
manding official sanctioning and public financial
support for their religious holidays.
Only a mean-spirited and prideful Christian

could gain any pleasure from seeing the state ex
tend its official sanction and sponsorship to his
religion with the help of taxes paid by people who
disagree, as a matter of profound religious con
science, with the doctrines thus endorsed and
touted by then state.
Burger does not give any guidance as to how a
Jewish parent, for example, is supposed to ex
plain to his child why the state celebrates the
neighbor's religion, but not theirs. The Court
simply flashes a green light to the gluttonous
bigotry and stifling, intolerant conformism
which have always accompanied attempts by the
majority to glorify its own religion.
It is a sad thing that the court should choose
to raze Thomas Jefferson's "wall of separa
tion" between church and state, while airily dis
missing it as nothing but a "metaphor." It is a sad
thing that the court should choose so callously
and deliberately to denigrate the principles
enshrined in the First Amendment to the Con
stitution. It is, above all, a sad thing that the
court is unable to comprehend the profound wis
dom of the founding fathers in placing religion
forever (or so they thought) beyond the reach of
the petty conflicts and factional strife of the
political arena.
The present court may attempt to reassure it
self that its decision is a narrow one, or that,
after all, the aid to religion in this case is small,
and seemingly of little consequence. Later courts
will face the task of painstakingly reconstructing
the great principle of constitutional law which
the current majority has seen fit to desecrate so
carelessly.
