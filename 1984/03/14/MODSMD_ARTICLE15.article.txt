As the "rather charming under

tone in which the editorial is writ

The editorial does not stop,
however, at a mere defense of the

I here is no excuse.
I have been hearing the most
unbelievable excuses, since the viola

"Ait shouldn't try to be political."
"You don't make something like

You don't make allowances lor

Before I was bom. someone

I was al college, someone painted

over a sign advertising a gay dance

It was the same sort of homophobia
which appears now, at Stanford: an
ugliness which breeds in children who
feel threatened.
George Segal's sculpture was a
monument to human dignity: That
is what most makes me lull of rage.
It was as political as Michaelan
gelo's David; it portrayed the
strength and beauty of women and
men who choose to love as they will.
It was simply a monument to the
dignity which gay men and women
have found in themselves, and with

Why, sir, do you continue to
torture us, the poor readers with
that feeble attempt at a comic
strip, BVH?
There arc basically two problems
with the cartoon.
I irst, the author, whom I will not
name so as to not embarrass him
further, lacks artistic ability
altogether. This in and of itself is
not sin; many others (mysell in
eluded) are likewise afflicted with
this lack of talent. However, we do
not attempt to show the rest of the
world our ineptitudes.
The second problem is that the
author has failed to show any
semhlcncc ol humor at all in any one
ol his cartoons. I find this astonish
ing; while, according to my friends, I
have a perfectly healthy, in fact
even overflowing, sense of humor, I
have failed to even smile at even one
of those accursed cartoons.
I suggest that you cancel BVII

Your recent article on the
finances of the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMO) calls for a few clarifica
tions. Iff
first, ITupologize for my incorrect
statement that four Band members
voted in favor of the Band's budget
in their capacity as members of the
ASSU Senate. As I learned last
Tuesday, there was only one such
conflict of interest.
Second, I have no objections
whatsoever against the Band's un
conventional style; far from it, the
very suggestion to oppose its morally
subversive performances would
revolt my conscience. In other
words, the more fundamentalists
the Band manages to offend, the
better.
Third, your figures concerning the
Band's budget are slightly mislead
ing. Excluding member contributions
($33,000), total income for the year
I 9K4-K5 is expected to be $89,000
(not $75,000), of which about
$50,000 is earmarked for trips to
Oklahoma and Los Angeles. As
regards the special lee to be paid by
the student body, total receipts
(net of refunds) are estimated at
$45,000, slightly less than half of
which will be spent on the pre
season trip to Oklahoma.
In my opinion, it is inappropriate
to tax Stanford students to finance
these relatively large expenditures,
since the events concerned take
place far away from the campus
where most students happen to live.
Whether these trips benefit die
University with respect to fund
raising and goodwill, or whether they
are "just a pork barrel for Band
members" (as former ASSU senator
.lames McCirath puts it), are inter
esting, but irrelevant, questions.
finally, I made it abundantly clear
on several occasions that I am aware
that the Band is currently receiving
c<>iiMi/ci;i(>/y /ess /Iluinviul support
from the University than was ex
pected ($27,000 instead of
$51,000), and that budget modifica
tions should come as no surprise.
Nevertheless, the fact remains that
Hrie Berg, co-chairman of the ASSU
Senate appropriations committee,
has repeated his statement that the
Band's 19X4-N5 budget is "not in
good order"; consequently, I believe
that a more critical examination of
its financial statements was warran

It was as political as Michaelan

Why, sir, do you continue to

There arc basically two problems
with the cartoon.
I irst, the author, whom I will not
name so as to not embarrass him
further, lacks artistic ability
altogether. This in and of itself is
not sin; many others (mysell in
eluded) are likewise afflicted with
this lack of talent. However, we do
not attempt to show the rest of the
world our ineptitudes.
The second problem is that the
author has failed to show any
semhlcncc ol humor at all in any one
ol his cartoons. I find this astonish
ing; while, according to my friends, I
have a perfectly healthy, in fact
even overflowing, sense of humor, I
