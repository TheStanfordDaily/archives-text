## School prayer: text or context? 
### 
Proponents of a constitutional amendment permit
ting "voluntary" school prayer, or those who support a
watered-down version allowing silent prayer, seem lately
to have deflated much of the criticism from those who
insist on the separation of church and state by proposing
to prohibit standardized prayer texts in the schools. The
advocates of school prayer have disposed of the "who
writes the prayer" issue by suggesting that no one write
it.

VIEWPOINT

What objection can be brought against a proposal
which would preclude collective prayer recitation and in
stead encourage individual spoken prayers, or even less
objectionably, silent prayer?
To object one need only distinguish prayer from text.
Prayer is not just a set of words, it is a situation in which
a group of people focus on a common connection be
tween themselves and something beyond themselves,
liven it initividiisiß' wurik 01 thoughts arc different, the
mere act of organizing for collective prayer is a religious
event.
Thus it is not enough to allow the atheist or agnostic
to sit silently while others pray (and even Jerry Falwell
admits it would be unacceptable to require them to
leave the classroom) because text and prayer are not
synonymous. Children for whom religious experience is
offensive would be subjected to a religious event; just as
bad, those who pray regularly at home or in church would
be placed in a prayer situation which may violate their
religious principles.
l or example, among Orthodox Jews or Moslems prayer
is performed within strict circumstantial guidelines.
Similarly, Catholics and Orthodox Christians usually pray
together as part of a series of specified rituals per
formed in a church.
Should school children be allowed or required to kneel

during prayer? Should they be encouraged to face
Mecca? Or to assume a lotus position? Or to burn in
cense? Should they be permitted to perform any or all of
the above on an individual basis?
However one answers these questions one thing is cer
tain: The prayer experience cannot avoid offending some
participants because they will not be experiencing prayer
in the context which they deem appropriate. Thus any at
tempt to achieve collective worship in public schools
would violate fundamental religious freedom, regardless
of the textual content of prayer.
By confining the meaning of prayer to text and
neglecting context the advocates of school prayer side
step a principle aspect of the prayer experience in order

Prayer is not just a set of
words, it is a situation in

focus on a common
connection between
themselves and something
beyond themselves.

to achieve their fundamentalist hegemonic goals. For
some of them, no doubt, prayer is synonymous with
words — collective worship may he accomplished in a
t'oothiill stadium or via television while snacking in the
comtort ot one's living room. I do not begrudge their
contextual eclecticism, but they must recognize that
some suppliants still prefer incense and stained glass.
