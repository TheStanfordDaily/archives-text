## Depth, investigation lacking in Daily Food Service articles

Recently The Daily ran a series ol articles
on loocl service. While not commenting on
all ol the articles' statements anil conclu

VIEWPOINT

looil anil lahoi costs to those ol McDonald s
are absurd al best, and insulting at worst.
There can be no comparison between the
quality anil variety ol menus presented by
University Food Service anil McDonald's.
\nv comparison is I lie same as comparing the
education al Stanlord to the education al a
real estate or bartending school iiist because
I he people who go there are called students.
Comparisons ol salaries should be made
with comparable positions at comparable in

stitulions in the area. This was the method
used to determine salaries when the lirst
union contract was signed and any increases
have been won through the collective bar
gaining process.
Contracting food service to private com
panies would be a mistake. While there
would be an initial savings in dollars, this
savings would soon evaporate either in the
quality of food or in outright increases in
prices or a combination of both. This solu
tion also overlooks an intangible aspect, that
is. the commitment ol Stanford workers to
the overall community, looil Service
employees are among the lowest paid
workers (a high percentage ol whom arc
minorities), struggling to raise families on
salaries not far above poverty level. I or
these people, a large pari of their reward is
the knowledge that tliev are contributing to
the success ol Stanlord as one ol the finest
universities in the world. In other words,
mam workers identify themselves as a neces

sary part of the Stanford community and
derive great pride from this.
None of this is meant to deny that there
are problems with looil Service. Closing the
commissary is only a cosmetic approach to
the much deeper problem of stagnation,
namely University l ooil Service is suffering
from a lack of new ideas (Sterling Ouail not
withstanding) and over- bureaucratization.
I here has been absolutely no new blood in
the upper management of l ooil Service for
many years; no one is willing to take the risk
required to put forward new and innovative
ideas. There is the sense that many managers
are just getting by. doing things the way
they have always done and merely waiting
for retirement.
riicrclorc. in light of these observations. I
would like to make the following recommen
dations:
I list and loremost. the ASSU should es
tablish a peimancnt subcommittee to deal

with Mousing and I'ood Service matters. This
committee should meet regularly with 112 ood
Service manager reps. Food Service workers
reps, resident assistants and members of
dorm food committees. This would keep the
lines of communication open to the various
parties concerned, as well as allow the ASSU
to accumulate its own body of independent
information in these matters. It would also
keep the University from using the ASSU's
legitimate concerns as a contract negotia
tion or union-busting ploy.
Flic University should streamline its pur
chasing procedures rather than
decentralizing them as closing the commis
sary would do and either improve or elimi
nate the menu development department.
I'll is department is a joke since the menus
rarely change and there is no longer even a
test kitchen in which to try recipes.
I lie University should also implement pay
as-you-go in smaller halls and make it

available to more students, and allow greater
flexibility of meal plans, targeted to need
and use.
The ASSU and University Food Service
should work closely together on a waste
awareness program both in terms of food
and dishware. l ood service spends a
phenomenal amount of money to continually
replace lost or broken dishware and the food
waste here is unconscionable.
Manager/worker consultation groups to
solve mutual problems and apprenticeship
and training programs to promote quality
and professionalism of workers should also
be formed.
The United Stanford Workers have
created a task force to facilitate this
process. We stand ready to work together
with any interested parties in common goals.
