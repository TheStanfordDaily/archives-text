that is an issue here." Mamlel; "Well, a Jew who works
lor McCartln is thought ol very ill b\ most ol the
Jew ish people in this country ."
Colin said at Stanlord that "McCarthy was a one
issue person." 1 hat is lalse. Al one point. McCarthy
said: "Sink everx accursed British ship." because Kngland
was trading with the People's Republic ol China.
McCartln sought lo block President I isenhower's ap
pointment i>l the conservative "Chip" Bolilcn .is ambas
sador to Moscow, because he wanted no relations vvilh
the Soviet Union at all.
Colin sought to Ircc McCarlhv ol the onus ol witch
hunting "Hollywood st.us ;ind other individuals.'* since
movie people arc today popular among students, when lie
said that it was other investigative committees that had

Colin alleged that in the hearings on "eonimunists" in
the U.S. Armv. McCarthv never made a eharge that was
later disproved. I challenged that direct!) in mv tes
timony. saving to McC'artln: "You murdered Major
Ravmond Kaplan In driving him to a point where he
jumped under a truck." Whereupon Colin prevented me
from reading Kaplan's suicide note to his wife, which had
been published 111 The New York l imes. McCarthv made
no attempt to refute mv accusation or to take court ac
tion against me. The closing words of mv tcstimonv. ad
