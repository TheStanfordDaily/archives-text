# GLAS protests veto of gay rights legislation
## 
### LYNN MARCUS With wire reports 
Members of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
(GLAS) joined hundreds of gay rights advocates
and many political leaders in expressing their
anger and disappointment at the veto ot a con
troversial homosexual job rights bill by Gov.
George Deukmejian yesterday that thwarted a
nine-year legislative effort.
Assembly Bill 1 would have forbidden job dis
crimination on the basis of sexual preference and
allowed gays to press job-related discrimination
complaints through the state's Department ot
Fair Employment and Housing.
The bill passed the Senate Feb. lb by a 22-lb
vote, marking the first time the measure has
cleared both houses since it was initially intro
duced in 1976.
The Republican governor's veto ended 12 days
of intense lobbying by both foes and supporters
of the measure and a tlood of nearly 10.000 let
ters and phone calls daily to the Governor's Of
fice.
Deukmejian said the more than 90.000
communications he received ran about 2-1
against the bill, which was bitterly opposed by
fundamentalist religious groups.
The governor issued a written statement
saying that he recognized that Californians "are
deeply divided regarding this issue." but said
there is not enough evidence of discrimination
against gays to justify the landmark statute.

Bill sponsor Art Agnos (D-San Francisco) said
he was "heartbroken" at the veto, but added
that "This is not the end of the struggle for gay
civil rights." Agnos said the bill will be
reintroduced every year until it becomes law, and
many other politicians and gay rights activists
have vowed to work for its passage.
In San Francisco last night, between 300 and
400 demonstrators protested the governor's ac
tion. according to a police spokesman.
GLAS responded to the veto by issuing a
statement accusing the governor of condoning
hiring practices that discriminate against
homosexuals.
"The recent violent attack on the 'Gay Libera
tion' sculpture here at Stanford is a case in point
of the fact that gay men and lesbians do need
protection from discrimination in our society,"
GLAS spokesman Jeff Williams said.
Williams was referring to a sculpture by
renowned artist George Segal that was hit at
least 40 times with a hammer by an unknown
vandal March 6. The sculpture was on indefinite
loan to the University.
Although a witness saw a man with a hammer
near the statue around the time of the incident,
police still have no new leads in the case.
The statue was removed from its site near the
Math Corner after the incident and it is currently
being held by the police because it is "evidence in
a crime." according to Alt History Prof. Albert
Elsen. Police say they have no leads in the case.

Elsen said it has not yet been determined whe
ther the statue will have to be recast. He
declined to estimate the value of the sculpture.
University officials say Stanford will probably
pay for the repair of the statue, which was on
loan from the Mildred Andrews Foundation. But
it is not yet known whether the sculpture will
remain on campus when and if it is repaired.
Director of Risk Management Robert Beth
said the University is self-insured and will prob
ably pay for the sculpture's repair.
Elsen expects the police to release the
sculpture in a few days. It is slated to be shipped
back to a foundry in New Jersey, where Segal and
others will determine whether it needs to he
recast.
GLAS and several other Stanford organiza
tions protested the vandalization Monday at a
rally in White Plaza attended by about 150
people.
The defacement of the sculpture was
denounced at the rally as an "act of fascist vio
lence." bv Mark Dupont. Gay and Lesbian Law
Students Association member: "a desecration
and blasphemy." by Donald Caughey. assistant
dean of Memorial Church: and an act of " van
dalism and violence against all." hy Alice Supton,
assistant dean of Residential Education.
Jack Winkler, assistant professor of classics,
said at the rallv that people tend to erroneously
view the vandal as a "freak, as an isolated individ
ual."
