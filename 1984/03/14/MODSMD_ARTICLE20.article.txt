## Arts instructors inspire creativity and friendship Movement integral to life for dance teacher 
### GLYNIS COSTIN 
Danccrs glided across a studio floor in colorful leg
warmers. Their faces glowed in the light from a high,
arched window which framed the pinks, blues and purples
of a winter sky at dusk.
Fhey moved in rhythm to the claps and words of a tall
Mexican Indian.
"Stretch your legs like the roots of a tree," he told
them. "Reach like a branch for the skv."

They stretched and reached, listening with rapt atten
tion to this dark, charismatic man.
"Smile." he said. "And. for heaven's sake, breathe!"
They smiled and breathed for Juan Valenzuela, a 64-
year-old Stanford dance teacher and a senior lecturer in
the Drama Department.
Neither a gray hair on his head nor a slouch in his
posture, he moved right along with them, lilting his legs
as high as any 20-year-old student.
"I guess I look young because I keep moving." he said
later, pulling on his leg warmers in preparation for his
"Movement for Actors" class. "I don't eat anything spe
cial," he laughed. "I used to eat what I thought blond
haired. blue-eyed people ate. I thought those were the
best things to have."
While stretching his legs and touching his toes, he
moved on to more serious topics.
"In education here, 1 think that teachers assume a lot.
They assume that when you're in a certain grade that
you're supposed to know certain things. But everyone
learns at different rates."
came to Stanford 10 years ago alter re
ceiving a position as a movement specialist from the Na
tional Endowment for the Arts. He likes his job. he said.

but feels that dance here is "not as good as it could be.
for a school with these kinds of resources."
He also said that he would like to see dance at Stan
ford integrated with other disciplines.
•'I think one of the real problems in American culture
is that education has become so specialized," he said.
"People tell me they have become so isolated and are
kept so busy with their own field that they don't have
time to sample other areas."
"He strives for a connection between dance and other
fields," said Lisa Stanley, a master's, student in dance
and education who has worked with Valenzuela on
various projects. "A lot of people seem to think that
dance isn't really worthy of respect as a field," she said.
"It's seen as frivolous and not really part of anything
else. Juan wants to move away from that image."
"Everything relates to everything else," Valenzuela
said. "Movement is a part of everything. I think there
needs to be more emphasis on movement."
Valenzuela said that movement Can even be used in
law school.
"Body language and movement are important for
lawyers in the court,"he said. "It's all acting really, isn't
it? In the Indian culture, everyone becomes involved in
dance. From the grandparent down to the tiny
grandchild, movement is an important means of expres
sion."
He paused thoughtfully for a moment. "People don't
stop to think about how what they're learning relates to
life," he said slowly. "They think about grades, competi
tion and megabucks. This leaves them, I think, with
vacant spots."
Currently, he is working on a project to bring dance
into elementary schools and integrate it with other
fields.
Stanley, who has worked on the project, explains, "Instead
of having kids look in textbooks, he (Valenzuela) allows
them to experience things. He teaches them basic dance
techniques and incorporates other lessons, such as math
or spelling into them. This way, kids remember things
more easily. They internalize things."
Valenzuela said that children have been very
responsive to his teaching methods, which he has used at
several schools across the country.
"They get really involved," he said. "They say 'Mr.
Juan. Mr. Juan look what I did!' and they show me how
they've applied something we learned. While everyone
else is giving them don'ts, I'm allowing them to do."
He said that his methods are not as easy for educators
to accept because many feel uncomfortable with the
idea of using dance to teach.
"The number one thing about Juan is that he doesn't
try to train people to become professional dancers,"
Stanley said. "He tries to let them find their own crea
tive self. The last thing on his mind is trying to prepare
someone for stardom. He tries to get at people's
insides."
The sky outside the dance studio window had dark
ened. "I want you to show me jealousy, pain, competi
tion and arrogance," Valenzuela told his students. "Now
imagine you've heard something sad. Contract, expand,
move and scream."
The students contracted their bodies and let out
prima/ sounding moans.
He smiled. "Yes, yes," he said. "Show me how you
feel."

vacant spots."
Currently, he is working on a project to bring dance
into elementary schools and integrate it with other
fields.
Stanley, who has worked on the project, explains, "Instead
of having kids look in textbooks, he (Valenzuela) allows
them to experience things. He teaches them basic dance
techniques and incorporates other lessons, such as math
or spelling into them. This way, kids remember things
more easily. They internalize things."
Valenzuela said that children have been very
responsive to his teaching methods, which he has used at
several schools across the country.
"They get really involved," he said. "They say 'Mr.
Juan. Mr. Juan look what I did!' and they show me how
they've applied something we learned. While everyone
else is giving them don'ts, I'm allowing them to do."
He said that his methods are not as easy for educators
to accept because many feel uncomfortable with the
idea of using dance to teach.
"The number one thing about Juan is that he doesn't
try to train people to become professional dancers,"
Stanley said. "He tries to let them find their own crea
tive self. The last thing on his mind is trying to prepare
someone for stardom. He tries to get at people's
insides."
The sky outside the dance studio window had dark
ened. "I want you to show me jealousy, pain, competi
tion and arrogance," Valenzuela told his students. "Now
imagine you've heard something sad. Contract, expand,
move and scream."
The students contracted their bodies and let out
prima/ sounding moans.
He smiled. "Yes, yes," he said. "Show me how you
feel."
