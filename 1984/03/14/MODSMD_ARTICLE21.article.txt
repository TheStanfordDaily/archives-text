# Professor begins days with Beethoven and juice
## 
### GREGORY SMITH 
Have you ever had a professor give
you a box of cookies at the end of
each lecture, or shower you with gifts
such as sweaters, scarves or books
during the holiday season? Have you
ever gone to a 4 a.m. class assured
that a glass of freshly squeezed or
ange juice would be awaiting your ar
rival? Or better still, have you ever
had the opportunity to study closely
with a "superb teacher." a "world
renown pianist." and become his
friend? In 75-year-old Music Prof.
Adolph Bailer, the Music Depart
ment has such a man.
Each year pianists come from all
over the country to study with this

"superb teacher and chamber
musician," according to Prof. Albert
Cohn, chairman of the Music De
partment. Whether from as far as
the Julliard School of Music in New
York or as close as the San Francisco
Conservatory, the students, year
after year, keep coming. And thus.
Bailer's reputation perpetuates it
self.
"He has attracted -some extremely
strong students to our graduate pro
gram," Cohn said.

But the making ot an outstanding
teacher and top-notch musician lies
not in the sheer number of years
teaching and practicing. Hie making
of Adolph Bailer has been a result ol
pain, ambition and not a small quan
tity of love and compassion.
Born in a small Polish town in
1909. Bailer left his family at age !<•
to studv music at the Vienna Conser
vatory. "I had no money, since my fa
ther had died when 1 was very
young." Bailer said. "When I finally
arrived at Vienna. I met a family
there with no children that con
sented to take me in."
It was shortly thereafter that Bai
ler began concerti/ing throughout
Austria. Germany and Italy. At age

17, he was performing such programs
as the entire Beethoven Sonata col
lection and Bach's complete "Das
Wohltemperirte Clavier." The Ger
mans call such a young and extraor
dinarily gifted pianist "ein
Wunderkind" — a child prodigy.
During this same period, Bailer
was also featured as a soloist with
the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra
.it llie annual Sal/Inn j; I usii\;tl.
where he performed the Beethoven
"Emperor Concerto."

But the approach of World War II
brought disaster. "One day while
walking in the street I was stopped
by some Nazi troopers." Bailer
recounted. " They asked me if 1 was
Jewish, and when I answered "yes",
they began to beat me. They took me
tn a house in the outer district —
which I could barely discern because
my eyes were bleeding — and
proceeded to torture me.
By l l >3y. he and his wile. Edith,
escaped the impending doom of Na/i
(iermany and made their way to the
United States. In a short time. Bailer
was travelling the wi eld — Alaska.
Japan — while perlorming with
Yehudi Menuhin. a program he con
tinued for the next 20 years.
Yet, for the last 25 years, his con
tributions have been lelt most
strongly here. In addition to his posi
tion on the Stanford faculty, he still
maintains a post at the San Francisco
Conservatory ol Music, where he was
once head of the piano faculty.
"Mr. Bailer is one of a kind." ac
cording to Miisic Prof. Andor Toth,
"a highly cultivated world citizen of
uncompromising artistry and in
tegrity. His contribution to the Bay
Area has been of the highest stan
dard as both a performer and
teacher."
His peers are, in fact, so taken by
their their co-worker that they have
recently established a new musical
scholarship fund in Bailer's honor.
The money for the Adolph Bailer En
dowment Fund — some $12,000
donated by more than 100 people —
will benefit two future Stanford
music students,
"One ol the primary reasons I
came here (after studying at the
Royal Academy of London) was to
study with Mr. Bailer." said Kay
Bedenbaugh. a graduate of the Juil
liard School of Music and a student
working toward her doctorate of mu
sical arts. "I feel that it is a wonder
ful opportunity to be able to work
with someone of his insight and expe
rience."
In retrospect, one is amazed with
the incredible career — and life —
this man has led. The positive and
enriching experiences he has encoun
tered, and thus shared through his
music with so many, are overwhelm
ing. And yet, it is refreshing to know
that in addition to all these ac
complishments. there remains a warm
smilje, a crisp cmt>rucc an<J a £»iass ol
orange juice lor anyone who wants
one.
