C lark Reynolds told 100 students
and alumni this weekend at the Stan-

lord Alumni Association's 19N4
(jreat Powers Seminar.
During the seminar, held at the
Terman Engineering Center, Stan
lord experts in economies, lood

policy. anthropology and political sci
ence addressed the challenges that
confront the Third World and the
ramifications that might he felt by
the United States.
Saturday's program analyzed Third
World problems in general. Lecturers
included Political Science Profs.
Da\id Abernethy and Stephen Kras
ner. Food Research Institute Prof.
Scott Pearson and Gerald Meier, pro
lessor ol international economics at
the Graduate School of Business.
Abernethy said the Third World is
more resistant to the West exercis
ing its power than to the East. The
double standard exists because of the
West's previous colonial relationships
with the Third World, but Aber
nethy says that the West has other
factors in its favor.
The Third World has a "strong
sense that it needs to catch up" to
the West and the East economically
and " the West has the goodies the
I hird World needs and wants."' Aber
nethy said. These resources, such as
the World Bank and the Interna
tional Monetary Fund, give the West
long-term influence that the Soviets
I list don't have. Abernethy said.
Krasner said that there are olten
differences between the West and
the I hird World o\er whether inter
national markets should be free or

under some authority. A large num
ber ot Third World countries are at
the mercy of their economic environ
ments and are vulnerable to the
whims of free markets, he said. Thus,
conflicts over economic philosophies

are not due to "our love of
capitalism or their love ol socialism,"
or to their orientation toward the
Soviet Union. The United States
should he more open-minded about

the issue, and "there are areas where
the U.S. ought to think seriously
about reverting to economic au
thoritarianism.'' said Krasner.
Meier considered development in
the future and focused on the Third
World's labor problem. By the year
2000. "the workforce will increase 40
percent and 90 percent of that in
crease will come in less developed
countries," he said. "We are starting
off with unemployment, under
employment and absolute poverty."
said Meier, and the major problem
for the Third World in the future is
going to be how to make surplus
labor productive, he said.
On Sunday, the seminar considered
case studies on specific countries. El
Salvador, Lebanon and Africa were
analyzed as examples of how the
"great powers involve themselves in
the political affairs of the Third
World."
Later, conference participants
heard "how the great powers involve
themselves in dealing with the Third
World debt crisis" in Brazil and
Mexico.
After breaking into discussion
groups early Sunday afternoon, the
participants concluded by designing
viable U.S. foreign policy alterna
tives toward selected developing
countries.
