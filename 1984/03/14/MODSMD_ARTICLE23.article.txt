## 
### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
Stanford and the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA)-Ames Research
Center (ARC) will sign an agree
ment Friday which will increase
space-related research opportuni
ties for students and professors
here.
The Space Institute will provide
for a formal commitment be
tween the University and NASA,
allowing professors and graduate
students to research at Ames and
ARC scientists to work at Stan
ford as consulting professors.
There is no physical site planned
for the institute right now.
The agreement will formalize a
relationship that has already
existed for some time, according
to Applied Physics Prof. Vahe
Petrosian, and the Space Institute
will make opportunities such as
doing research at the ARC better
known to Stanford professors.
One of the features of the
joint agreement is that graduate
students will be allowed to do re

search work at the ARC. There is
no prescibed measure for selection
to go to the ARC as of yet: it
there is "mutual agreement" be
tween the student and faculty in
his or her department. Petrosian
said, then that student probably
would be allowed to go.
The ARC is the primary NASA
site for the Shuttle Infra-Red
Telescope Facility, which will be
sent up with a space shuttle in
"six to seven years," Petrosian
said. This is a major project for
astronomers and astrophysicists.
Funding for the institute will
primarily come from the ARC,
with Stanford providing reduced
overhead, according to Petrosian.
"We are hoping for regular fun
ding from NASA headquarters"
to provide support for graduate
students and visiting researchers
and to pay for seminars and collo
quia that will be held.
According to Petrosian. there
have been similar programs be
tween NASA and other univer
sities. In this particular instance
Stanford initiated the program.
