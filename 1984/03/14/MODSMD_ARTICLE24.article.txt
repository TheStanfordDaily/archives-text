# From animals to wimps, Ancients always run for fun
## 
### GLYNIS COSTIN 
They have heen described as
an "oddly matched bunch." a
"motley crew." and a
"whimsically named" group.
They have no coach, no rules,
an ever-changing number ot
members and hold no tryouts.
yet they have twice won a na
tional intercollegiate champi
onship.
They are the Angell Field
Ancients, a 20-year-old infor
mal running group at Stanford.
The Ancients meet everyday
on Angell Field, where they
warm up. crack a tew jokes and
head out for the Golf Course,
the Dish or some other des
tination depending on what
day it is. On Wednesdays, the
day they hold timed, sprint tri
als. there is usually a big turn
out.
Weather is no object to
these dedicated runners.
"We've come out in some in
credible storms." said Engi
neering Prof. Donald
Carpenter. 56. the unofficial
organizer of the group. "I can't
imagine a day going by when at
least one member doesn't come
out."
Sometimes numbering 40 or
50. the group starts out to
gether and then separates into
smaller bunches of "fasts,"
"mediums" and "slows."
"We also have the
'superfasts' or the 'animals.'
said Communication Prof. Don
Roberts, who has been running

with the Ancients for about
seven years. "There are also the
wimps — those people who al
ways seem to be hurt." he said
with a laugh.
"The beauty of the group is
that there's a whole spectrum
of speed, style and ability." he
continued. "There are people
like me who put/ around and
there are nationally ranked
runners for their age group."
He said Richard Schupbach. a
professor in Slavic languages,
and Michelle Schwartz, a

graduate student in biology,
were "animals." Sell wart/
laughed at the title. "I just like
to run." she said.
One of the things she said
she liked about the group was
its flexibility.
"You can run whenever you
feel like it." she s;iid. "I usually
run Mondays. Wednesdays and
Fridays."
The group was formed in
1965 by Stanford Professors
James Gere. Alan Waterman
and Dave Stevenson. The three

met while runnine at Angell
Field.
"That was before running
became a national fad." Gere.
.^ l ). now recalls. "I used to see
maybe only one or two people
out when I went running in the
'605."
Gere said Waterman
thought of the name and it
stuck.
"I guess we thought we were
pretty old to be running then."
lie said.
The name may be misleading

now. however, because one
does not really have to be
"ancient" to be part of the
group.
Many of the current mem
bers. who can be spotted
sprinting around campus at
noon in their bright red and
yellow "Ancients" T-shirts, do
not. in fact, look very old.
There are still a number of
grav-haired heads among this
coed group of faculty, stall
and local professionals, but
there arc also several graduate
students.

"I'd s;i\ there's a whole con
tingent ol guy s in their late
20s who run with us." said
Chuck I o\. 43. a loeal resilient
who has been running with the
group for scven years.
The Ancients received a lot
nl publicitv 111 when they
won a national clearinghouse
competition lor intercollegiate
facuitv-stall running teams.
I hat vear. articles about the
group appeared in both the San
I rancisco I \aininer anil the
San Jose Mercury.
"Those were the days when
there was really a lot ol sup
port." said Roberts. "Points
were given lot participation
and time according to age and
everyone really encouraged
each other."
Hut the group has become
significantly less competitive
since the days of the clearing
house competitions.
"There just doesn't seem to
be the interest for that kind
of thing anymore." saiil
Carpenter. Carpenter is an
"old-timer" who has been run
ning with the group since 1 1 >73.
A tall, willowy man with
bright blue eyes, he wore a blue
cap. no shirt and a pair of
ripped running shorts as he ran
along talking about the An
cients.
"The group lias gotten
younger and faster," he said
between breaths. "I guess
that's to be expected with run

ning being so popular now.
lie said he thought that
some ol the older members
were a little intimidated by the
younger, fast ones, a situation
that makes him sorry.
The sociability of the group
is frequently cited by the run
ners as a major appeal.
"The social aspects drive you
to levels of achievement you'd
never make on your own." said
Carpenter. "There's a real
sense of togetherness even
though people might be half a
mile apart. - '
Carpenter said the physical
benefits of running are oh
v ions.
"It's a tremendous release
from the pressures ol work."
he said, "although I must ad
mit that I really have to push
mvscll to be able to run with
the people I want to."
l or all the seriousness with
which the Ancients take their
running, there is also a definite
element of humor in this
diverse group ol men and wo
men.
bach year the "(ioldcn Jock
Award" is handed down from
one "deserv ing" member to an
other. It consists ol a giant
jock-strap decorated with
various medals, several of
which have nothing to do with
running.
There seems to be some dis
agreement among the group.


Led by 20 or so of their most faithful runners, the Angell Field Ancients hit the road during one of their daily workouts.
however, as to what the
award is for.
"It's given to someone
who has made a contribu
tion to the group," said
Carpenter.
"It's given for leadership
or to someone who has done
something really foolish,"
said Fox.
"I think it's nepotism,"
said Keith McNah, 42, who
currently holds the award.
Other awards which are
handed out at an annual
potluck include 1 the "Flying
Start Award," the
"Leathery Old Man
Award," and awards for
being "mellow," "foul
mouthed," and "most likely
to give legal advice while
running."
Carpenter, Roberts and
Gere all stressed that, aside
from staying in shape, the
main goal of the group is to
have fun.
"We're really very
casual," said Carpenter.
"Nowadays you see a lot of
people wearing Ancients T
shiits who really have noth
ing to do with the group —
but that's fine," he
shrugged.
"There are a lot of people
who run on Angell Field and
share our enjoyment of it,
whether they consider
themselves part of our
group or not."
