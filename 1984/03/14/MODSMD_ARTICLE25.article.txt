# Student garbage collectors find treasure in the can
## Tops buy dialysis time; officials say program a farce 
### MARK PAIST 
In addition to
helping kidney
patients, the
collecting has had a
'unifying effect' on
the dorm.

What could the aluminum
tabs that open soda and beer
cans possibly be worth'.' You
know, the ones that sometimes
need a crowbar to open, and
other times that break off,
leaving your "thirst quencher"
encased in aluminum sheathing.
Well, it depends who you talk
to.
For Susie Kilgore, those tops
could mean someone's life.
Despite cautioning from the
National Kidney Foundation
(NKF), Kilgore, a freshman in
Rinconada, is encouraging her
dorm to collect these tops and
cans in order to exchange them
for minutes on a dialysis ma
chine for a needy kidney pa
tient in a Tustin, Calif,
hospital. So far. her project has
met with increasing enthusiasm
in Rinconada and the surround

ing Wilbur dorms.
To date, 1253 tabs have been
collected by Rinconadans and
others, which could translate
to more than 20 hours on a
dialysis machine.
Kilgore feels, in addition to
helping kidney patients, the
collecting has had a "unifying
effect" on the dorm.
"People were less than en
thusiastic at first, but now.

finding a tab has become like
discovering a treasure," Kilgore
said.
People are even raiding recy
cling bins and garbage cans for
them, she said, and the
Teahouse has a cup set aside
just to collect them from their
customer's soda cans. Students
outside of Wilbur, most
notably in the Stanford Chris
tian Fellowship, have begun to

collect them, and Kilgore is en
couraging even more dorms and
organizations to start such a
program.
Kilgore brought the idea
from Foothill High School in
Tustin, a suburb of Los An
geles. Her school's drill team
coach, Debbie Fay, encouraged
her squads to start collecting
the tabs when one of the girls'
mothers found a program

through a local hospital. The
girls collected the tops, and the
hospital credited a lady's
dialysis bill with a minute for
every one of the tops it
received. The girls are now re
ceiving tops from many people,
including Kilgore's tops from
Stanford.
But like many of these
seemingly idyllic programs, this
one which aids kidney patients

appears to be "just not true,
according to the NKF in Bur
lingame.
"These programs crop up all
over the place," said a Kidney
Foundation official who
equated finding the culprits
behind these schemes to find
ing the originator of a
pyramid letter chain. The NKI
strongly encouraged people not
to participate in such
"fraudulent" programs. The
best and only way one can
guarantee actually contribu
ting to a dialysis patient, the
official said, is to redeem the
aluminum for cash by oneselt
and to donate that to the Kid
ney foundation.
And that is exactly what
Debbie Fay now intends to do
in the future. After receiving a
letter from the NKF encourag
ing her to stop sending her tops
to the program in which she
was participating, she has
decided to continue collecting
the tops along with the whole
aluminum can. "We'll just cash
them in ourselves," Fay said.
She is hoping to start a sell
run program soon, the money
from which she will donate in
the name of a young boy or girl
so that he can receive dialysis
treatment at a dialysis camp, a
summer camp for children with
kidnev disorders.


But like many of
these seemingly
idyllic programs,
this one which
aids kidney
patients appears
to be 'just not
true/ according to
the National
Kidney
Foundation in
Burlingame.
