## Women defend title; men try to get crown 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
It may he a year later, but nothing seems to
have changed. The Stanford women's swimming
team hopes this condition continues. The Stan
lord men's team hopes it doesn't.
For the women, although they were the No. 1-
ranked team for much of this season, they will
begin the NCAA Championships tomorrow at
Cleveland State as the No. 2-ranked team in the
country behind Florida.
But Stanford Coach George Haines doesn't
seem too affected by that circumstance.
"That's OK. they (Florida) were ranked No. 1
last year, too."
Florida took the No. 1 spot into the 1983
meet, but was outscored by Stanford, 41K.5 to
389.5. Haines figures the same will happen this
week.
" We have as good a chance as anyone," Haines
said Sunday before he and the team departed
for Indianapolis. "1 think we should be better
going into this year's meet than last year's."
Certainly Haines has plenty of justification
for being so confident. Not only did the Car
dinal go a perfect 10-0 this year in the dual meet
season, but this year's team has made several big
additions to last year's team.
Top among those additions is freshman Susan
Rapp, who has qualified in five events but can
only swim the maximum of four. Rapp has the
nation's third-best time in the 100 butterfly
(55.17). Patty Gavin ranks third in the 200
backstroke (2:01.04) and Krissie Hush is fifth
nationally in the 50 freestyle (23.44).
Haines said two key events are scheduled to
morrow, the first of the three-day meet. The
200-yard medley relay opens the meet and Stan
ford is the defending champ. The 500 freestyle
follows with Stanford's collegiate record-holder
Marybeth Linzmeier (ranked No. 4 nationally).
Lisa Hazen and Sherri Hanna among the
favorites that include American-record holder
Tracy Caulkins of Florida and Cynthia Wood
head of U SC.
"If we do well in those two events," Haines
said, " we'll be all right."
Swimming World magazine, which has picked
Stanford to win the meet surprisingly sees the
Cardinal winning only three events — Linzmeier
in the 1650 free plus the 200 and 400 free
relays.
The key for Stanford will be to get scoring
marks in as many events as it can. As Haines ex
plained in September, "We'll be better because

we can place people in scoring positions. We may
not win the majority of events, but we'll get
points."
Scoring balance may also be a key for the
men's team which will travel to Cleveland State
next week. Unlike the women, however, the men
are the favorite going into the meet having
maintained their No. 1 rank all season, going 1 1-
0.
Last year the men's team was the favorite
going in but slipped to fourth in a disappointing
performance. Coach Skip Kenney was especially
disappointed because he thought last year's slip
was due to the team's emphasizing the wrong
part of the season.
"We talked up the dual meet season too
much. We got caught up in the perfect season
thing (the team went undefeated during the
regular season) and burned out before the
NCAAs. We expected to go in and just walk
away with it (the national championship)," Ken
ney said.
As Assistant Coach John Stiling also ex
plained, "It (the dual meet emphasis) tended to
lend itself to season burnout. This year a lot of
emphasis is on NCAAs. We looked at the ul
timate goal of NCAAs, whereas if you are con
stantly trying to get up. you can get washed out.
It's like taking a test every week, you just get
tired and burned out."
The team hasn't dwelled on last year's results,
but last year is in the back of the swimmers'
minds, according to Stiling. "The emphasis this
year hasn't been on talking up the regular
season, it's been on going out and doing it,"he
said.
Illness has plagued the Cardinal lately, in fact
Kenney may be the sickest of all with the flu.
Stiling. however, said that the entire 19-man
team will be ready to go by next week.
The Cardinal is also at just the right point in
its tapering program in preparation for the
NCAAs. The tapering program is designed to get
the swimmers at their top level of performance
for the meet.
"The guys get a lot more rest at this point and
hopefully will be in peak condition for the
meet." Stiling said. The team hasn't even shaved
yet. By shaving their bodies, the swimmers will
significantly cut down its times.
Florida and Texas will give the Cardinal its big
gest run for the championship. "The top three
will be the ones to duke it out," Stiling said.

It may he a year later, but nothing seems to
have changed. The Stanford women's swimming
team hopes this condition continues. The Stan
lord men's team hopes it doesn't.

Stanford to win the meet surprisingly sees the
Cardinal winning only three events — Linzmeier
in the 1650 free plus the 200 and 400 free
relays.
The key for Stanford will be to get scoring
marks in as many events as it can. As Haines ex
plained in September, "We'll be better because

we can place people in scoring positions. We may
not win the majority of events, but we'll get
points."
Scoring balance may also be a key for the
men's team which will travel to Cleveland State
next week. Unlike the women, however, the men
are the favorite going into the meet having
maintained their No. 1 rank all season, going 1 1-
0.
Last year the men's team was the favorite
going in but slipped to fourth in a disappointing
performance. Coach Skip Kenney was especially
disappointed because he thought last year's slip
was due to the team's emphasizing the wrong
part of the season.
"We talked up the dual meet season too
much. We got caught up in the perfect season
thing (the team went undefeated during the
regular season) and burned out before the
NCAAs. We expected to go in and just walk
away with it (the national championship)," Ken
ney said.
As Assistant Coach John Stiling also ex
plained, "It (the dual meet emphasis) tended to
lend itself to season burnout. This year a lot of
emphasis is on NCAAs. We looked at the ul
timate goal of NCAAs, whereas if you are con
stantly trying to get up. you can get washed out.
It's like taking a test every week, you just get
tired and burned out."
The team hasn't dwelled on last year's results,
but last year is in the back of the swimmers'
minds, according to Stiling. "The emphasis this
year hasn't been on talking up the regular
season, it's been on going out and doing it,"he
said.
Illness has plagued the Cardinal lately, in fact
Kenney may be the sickest of all with the flu.
Stiling. however, said that the entire 19-man
team will be ready to go by next week.
The Cardinal is also at just the right point in
its tapering program in preparation for the
NCAAs. The tapering program is designed to get
the swimmers at their top level of performance
for the meet.
"The guys get a lot more rest at this point and
hopefully will be in peak condition for the
meet." Stiling said. The team hasn't even shaved
yet. By shaving their bodies, the swimmers will
significantly cut down its times.
Florida and Texas will give the Cardinal its big
gest run for the championship. "The top three
will be the ones to duke it out," Stiling said.
