# Men's coach doesn't Skip a thing

### TRASK LEONARD 
The best job in the world.
That's how men's swim
ming Coach Skip Kenney
describes his job. And it's
easy to see why.
"I really love my position
right now. and wouldn't
trade it for anything," said
Kenney. "I'm working with
a group of tremendous guys,
both in and out of the pool.
These are some of the
world's best student
athletes who are just a joy
to work with. That's what I
like most about coaching
here. But you just can't
beat other things, like
having my wife Debbie and
two kids around."
Originally a coach at Long
Beach State. Kenney came
to the Farm with a unique
background. Before he ac
cepted the job there, he had
had no coaching experience
at all. In fact, he had no real
desire to get involved in
swimming until he met Don
Gamble, the coach at Long
Beach.
"Don (Gamble) gave me
the original break. Here I
was with no experience and
he gave me a shot. It turned
my life around, because
before I got involved in
swimming and married my
wife Debbie, whom I met
through the sport, I had no
real direction in life. But
now I have a clear direction;
I want to remain here for a
long time," explained Ken
ney.
After Long Beach, Ken
ney had several coaching
jobs, most notably one at
Harvard. But when he
reached Stanford four years
ago. he knew he had found
his niche.
"The atmosphere here,
with all the exceptional
swimmers and students, is
just perfect. It's a great in
fluence on my kids, who at
tend practice most every

day as well. Besides, Stan
ford's consistently high
reputation for being among
the top few collegiate
powers in the nation was
certainly not worth passing
up," continued Kenney.
Before becoming involved
in aquatics, Kenney fought
in Vietnam, where he was
one of the few American
snipers.

"That experience taught
me a lot of things about
lite, yet 1 went through a
great deal of things that
many people would not like
to think about, including
myself," said Kenney.
"Being on the brink of
death constantly, and trust
ing on a buddy while I slept,
1 came to believe in the
power of comraderie.

"I also suffered a lot of
pain, like trying to live off
the land for two weeks at a
time. I learned to believe in
myself and in giving it my all
— I had to if I wanted to
survive.
"This is what I hope to in
still in my swimmers. The
belief that one can
overcome the circumstances
can be a powerful influence
on performance," he said.
Motivator is perhaps
Kenney's most important
role a,s head coach. At this
level dI swimminy. especially
at such a competitive
school, the physical refining
can only go so far before the
difference between winning
and losing becomes the men
tal aspect of the sport.
"I feel that one of my
most important jobs is to
turn the swimmers' minds
into positive forces in a
competition. Many times,
self-doubt can cause an
otherwise dominant swim
mer to lose a race," said
Kenney.
Even with all this motiva
tional training, however,
Kenney still believes in the
iperfection of one's physical
talents as well.
"We take close looks at
videotapes of their strokes.
But most of the coaching
on technique comes from
the swimmers themselves.
Guys like Dave Bottom and
John Moffett are already
such tremendous athletes
that they can help the other
guys a lot." explained Ken
ney.
All this seems to be
working, as Stantord is the
top-ranked team in the na
tion right now, and is consis
tently in the top five. Yet
Kenney, ever the hard
worker, sees room for im
provement.
"Maybe we shouldn't be
ranked number one now. We
still haven't reached our
peak," he said.
