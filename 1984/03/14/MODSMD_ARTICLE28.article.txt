# Poor finish costs Cardinal a chance to be Gardeners
## 
### ADAM BERNS Senior sportswriter 
Stanford players and coaches
felt they had reason to be op
timistic about a bid to the Na
tional Invitational Tourn
ament (NIT) and pos
sibly playing in Madison
Square Garden.
Finishing 19-12 overall (K-10
in the Pacific-10 Conference),
its most number of wins in 22
years, the Cardinal had high
hopes about an NIT bid and
talk around the Athletic
Departement was even setting
the day and opponent —
Thursday night against Santa
Clara, the rumor went.
Part of the rumor turned
out to be right. Santa Clara
will be in the tournament,
playing Oregon in its first
game. Stanford, however, will
be sitting home.
Sunday evening at around 6
p.m. the final NIT pairings
were announced and Stanford

was not one of the teams
picked to play.
Oregon will be the only Pac
-10 conference team in the
tournament although UCLA
was invited and turned down
the invitation.
A streak of seven con
secutive Pac-10 victories fol
lowing a 0-6 conference start
brought with it high expecta
tions even though the Cardinal
lost four of its last five games.
•"It's like you take a balloon
and then you pop it," Stanford
Associate Head Coach Bruce
Pearl said yesterday."I don't
think we thought we were in,
but we certainly thought we
had a good chance. With (John)
Revelli and (Keith) Jones being
seniors and with all the records
we set, 1 thought that those
things would work in our favor.
"We thought that with
Stanford basketball having its
best season in years, beating
UCI.A and Washington, would

be a primary factor working for
us. Stanford's top academic
reputation and (Tom) Davis'
style of play were also factors

working our way."
Some critics, like UC-Irvine
Coach Bill Mulligan, argued
that Stanford wasn't deserving

of a bid because of its easy pre
season schedule hut Pearl
disagreed with the assessment,
citing Stanford's Pac-10 record

as the determining factor.
"What they looked at was
that we lost four of the last
five (in the conference)," Pearl
said. "The pre-season schedule
had nothing to do with it. It
was our conference perfor
mance which hurt us."
Pearl went on to cite several
other factors working against
Stanford. One factor was the
Eastern bias apparent in both
the NCAA and NIT picks.
"There's no question that
the Pac-10 is underrated and
that the West in general is un
derrated," Pearl said. "You
just have to look at the NCAA
and NIT picks. Among the ob
vious exclusions, Irvine should
be going to the NIT and New
Mexico should going to the
NCAA."
Like Davis, who was out of
town and unavailable for com
ment, Pearl is a strong sup
porter of the Pac-10
Tournament idea and cited this

seasons tournament picks as
evidence that a tournament is
long overdue.
"If this year's NCAA selec
tions don't convince the Pac
-10 that it needs a tournament,
nothing will," Pearl said. "The
PCAA is doing things, drawing
13,000 at their tournament
down in the Forum."
Another reason the Cardinal
did not receive a tournament
invitation may have been its in
ability to get an all-important
20th win. But even the elusive
20-win mark may be deceiving
when you consider how many
teams got that many but will
stay home lor the tournament
season.
Among those teams that
won 20 games and didn't get
invited to either the NIT or
NCAA are Montana, Navy,
George Mason, Bunnell, Ohio
University, Loyola (Chicago),
Safnford and Texas-San An
tonio.
