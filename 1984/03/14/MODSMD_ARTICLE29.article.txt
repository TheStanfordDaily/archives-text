# Effects of NIT snub
## 
### 
The NCAA handed out
53 invitations to its post
season basketball party Sun
day afternoon. Then the
National Invitational
Tournament (NIT) invited
what qualified teams were
left to its lesser, black-tie
optional affair.
Now that the selection
process is over, it's time for
those teams that will watch
both tournaments on TV to
bitch.
You've got to feel for
some of those teams, too.
I cams like Bucknell, which
went 24-5 and won the East
Coast Conference with a
14-2 record, but lost the
co nfe re nee tourna me nt
title. Or Montana, a 23-7
club that finished second in
the Big Sky Conference. Or
Navy (24-7) or Ohio Univer
sity (20-8) or Texas-San An
tonio (20-8).
All those teams had
20-win seasons and
legitimate claims to at least
a NIT berth and in some
cases, even a NCAA bid. A
team that didn't have 20
victories but deserved a
tourney bid is UC-Irvine,
which finished 19-10 overall
and second place in the
tough PCAA (Pacific Coast
Athletic Association) at
14-4.
The PCAA's first- and
third-place teams. Univer
sity of Nevada-Las Vegas
(27-5) and Fresno State
(25-7), each got invitations
to the NCAA tournament.
Fourth-place Utah State
(19-10) got a NIT hid.
Irvine, which defeated all
three of those teams in reg
ular season play, got nothing
and Coach Bill Mulligan
bitched.
Stanford is another team
with 19 victories that will
put its party hats away for
yet another year, the 42nd
straight time it has done so.
The Stanford coaching
staff, however, didn't bitch
when the phone call from
the NI T selection commit
tee never came.
And well it shouldn't
have.
You can't feel sorry for
the Cardinal because it
didn't receive a NIT bid.
Why? Stanford; I V- I 2
record and all, clearly and

simply didn't deserve one.
Just weeks ago, though, it
looked as it the Card was a
"shoe-in" to the NIT and
even had NCAA aspirations
after a thrilling victory over
UCLA in Maples Pavilion
Feb. IS. The win left Stan
ford IS-S overall. 7-6 in the
Pacific-10 Conference and
on the wings of a seven
game in-conference win
streak.
But losing four of your
last five games — two of
them to teams with losing
records — certainly doesn't
warrant a tourney invite.
Nor does an S-1 () record in
the mediocre Pac-10 or a
12-12 overall record against
NCAA Division I oppo
nents. Stanford played
seven games against non-
Division I teams and won
them all. So what?
Still, Cardinal hoop fans
have reason to feel sorry for

their team. No, net because
they were snubbed by the
NIT, but based on what ef
fects not receiving that bid
will have on the future of
the Stanford basketball
program.
Schools don't go to the
NIT for the money. They go
for the national recogni
tion, to get under the spot
light cast by the
tournament. It is the
middle of March and they
are still playing basketball.
Most other teams in the na
tion aren't.
And while getting a piece
of the national limelight
doesn't pay in dollars, it
does in recruiting. Which
brings lis back to Stanford.
A big chunk of Stanford
basketball's future rests on
an 18-year-old kid from
Cloverdale. Craig MacMillan
is his name and basketball is
his game. MacMillan also
happens to be perhaps the
most sought-after high

school senior still unsigned
in the nation.
MacMillan, a 6-foot-6
point guard, was recently
featured in Sports ll
lustrated's "Faces in the
Crowd," and scored 46
points in his high school's
NorCal title game Saturday
at the Oakland Coliseum. In
the words of Stanford As
sistant Coach Bruce Pearl,
"he can do it all."
MacMillan has narrowed
his choice of colleges to five
— Stanford, UCLA,
Arizona, Santa Clara and
"maybe," he says, Idaho —
and not necessarily in that
order.
It MacMillan — billed as a
franchise though he has yet
to play a minute of college
basketball — changes that
order and opts for UCLA's
smog or Arizona's desert or
Idaho's wheat fields or
Santa Clara's whatever in
stead of Stanford. Cardinal
basketball will be in for a
much longer 1984-85 season
than it would if he doesn't.
Even with MacMillan,
things aren't going to be
easy for the Card in years to
come. You don't lose the
No. 2 and No. 5 all-time
scorers in school history
(seniors John Revelli and
Keith Jones, respectively)
one year and rebound the
next. Tom Davis and his
amazing coaching abilities
can only do so much.
The Pac-10 isn't going to
be any easier, either. Every
team in the league besides
Stanford and UCLA loses
virtually no one to gradua
tion this year and the Pac
-10 figures to be one of the
strongest conferences in the
nation from top to bottom
next season. And a team
like Stanford is not af
forded the luxury of a
UCLA, which simply draws
from a bench chock-full of
high school Ail-Americans
to replace All-Pac-10
seniors Kenny Fields and
Ralph Jackson.
Granted, Stanford had its
best season in 22 years, since
the 1961-62 team went 20-
6. But just because the Card
won 19 grimes this year
doesn't guarantee it an 18-
