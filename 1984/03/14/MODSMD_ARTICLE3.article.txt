# Board rejects proposal for Reagan policy center
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees yesterday rejected a White
House compromise proposal to locate an independent
Ronald Reagan public affairs center here, making it vir
tually certain that no policy center will become part of
the Reagan presidential library complex.
Saying that the proposal "is not consistent with the
need for the University's normal academic governance of
such activities on its lands," the Board approved 22 to 4
a resolution turning down the plan.
The Board reaffirmed Stanford's interest in consider
ing a public affairs center to be governed by the Univer
sity, but because the White House has long indicated
that such a University-run center would not be accep
table to the president and no other compromises have
been proposed, there is scant possibility arrangement will
ever be reached.
The decision is not expected to affect the agreement
reached last month between the University and the
White House to build a presidential library, with an in
cluded museum, on Stanford land. A newly appointed
University committee headed by Robert Freelen, vice
president for public affairs, has begun planning for the
library.
Support of the resolution to reject the center was
surprisingly strong, according to a source close to the
Board. A number of members who first had been
opposed to the resolution switched their votes after the
language was made more temperate, the source said.
The vote represents a victory for University President
Donald Kennedy and Board of Trustees President
William Kimball, who have said since December that an
independent policy center on Stanford land would not be
acceptable because it would not allow the University
suitable academic governance.
The source, who spoke on condition he not be identi
fied by name, said Kennedy "buttonholed" trustees
before the meeting Monday in an effort to convince
them to vote with him on the issue.
But the Board's decision means a defeat for the
White House, which has for years been interested in es
tablishing a policy center with the Reagan library and for
the past six months been negotiating to build that cen
ter at Stanford.
The Board vote came after Presidential Counselor Ed
win Meese, in a letter to Kennedy, reiterated the
president's enthusiasm for building a policy center.
Copies of the letter, dated March 5, were mailed di
rectly from the White House to each member of the
Board. In an apparent effort to. allay trustees' concerns

that the center would become an institution of political
advocacy and would hurt the University's academic
reputation, Meese emphasized that it would be
"operated in a scrupulously nonpartisan matter," that
"appointment procedures for visiting fellows . . . would
at least equal and very probably exceed normal academic
standards found in the best universities," and that in
name and in fact it "would have no connection with
Stanford University."
The letter also argued that the establishment of a
policy center would "substantially increase the potential
for research at the presidential library and . . . would be
of substantial value to the entire Stanford community."
Meese pointed out that the conference facilities that
had been planned for the center would "be comparable
to the best available in the world" and would be made
available for use by University schools and departments.
Kennedy told the Stanford University News Service
yesterday that the University has sent Meese a "cordial"
reply by Federal Express, "reassuring him of the Board's
enthusiastic wish to proceed with the library."
In response to the Board action, Hoover Institution
Director W. Glenn Campbell, who with others at Hoover
has for years been active in efforts to bring a Reagan
presidential complex to Stanford and has often been at
odds with University officials over the matter, issued a
prepared statement expressing regret "that a majority
of the Stanford trustees in response to the urging of
President Kennedy" rejected the White House proposal.
"This decision is particularly unfortunate in that it is
taking place shortly after the White House generously
allowed the Reagan presidential library and museum to
come to Stanford without the White House having to

accept the center as originally proposed," Campbell said,
referring to the original plan which would have had the
center administered by the Hoover Institution.
"The losers are the students, staff and faculty of
Stanford University," Campbell said.
In response, Kennedy told the University News Service
that "on reflection. Dr. Campbell may wish he had taken
a little more time to think about his statement."
A likely course of action now, according to Hoover In
stitution sources, is that the White House will consider
building the policy center in Palo Alto to take advantage
of the proximity to the Reagan papers. Other possibili
ties are that the center will be located at another uni
versity or that no center will be built at all.
