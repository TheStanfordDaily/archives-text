# Card sweep turns it around
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Junior shortstop John Verducci slapped
two run-scoring singles and saved another
run with a late-inning defensive gem to
key the surging Stanford baseball team to
a 4-2 victory over UC-Berkeley Sunday
that gave it a three-game sweep of its
cross-bay rivals.
The Cardinal raised its season record to
16-12-1 and 4-2 in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence with the win, its fourth consecutive,
and respective 13-3 and 9-6 victories on
Friday and Saturday. Yesterday's game
against Cal State Hayward was postponed
because of rain.
In the process, Stanford sent a warning
to the rest of the "Six-Pac" Southern
Division members that the defending
champions are not about to roll over and
die in 1984. And they did it by playing su
perb baseball, best exemplified by Sunday's
come-from-be hind triumph.
First, there was good pitching. Freshman
southpaw Al Osuna, who nearly started
(lie bull game according to Stanford Head
Coach Mark Marquess, bailed out starter

David Harris in the second inning after the
Bears had jumped to a 2-0 advantage.
Osuna went on to hurl seven shutout in
nings, quieting the Bears with just four hits
and outdueling Cal's Bren Conner (4-2),
the losing pitcher, to gain his second win
against no losses.
Second, there was timely hitting. The
kind of hitting that had been absent
throughout Stanford's early season non
conference schedule. Verducci, whose nine
game hitting string was snapped on Friday,
scored Mark Davis from third with a two
out single up the middle in the fourth to
cut the deficit to 2-1.
He put the Card on top to stay in the
bottom of the sixth with another two-out
single to center field, this time driving in
Walt Harris to give Stanford a 3-2 lead.
'"We felt that Verducci was much im
proved with the bat this year," said
Marquess in assessing his gifted
shortstop's new punch at the plate "What
has surprised us is that he's been a real
c/utch hitter."
Finally, there was the defense that

sealed the victory when the Bears
mounted a last gasp eighth-inning threat.
Ironically, it began when the Card's
leftfielder Mark Davis made the second
error of his collegiate career, and his
second in two games after going N6 con
tests without a miscue. Davis raced into
left-centerfield in pursuit of Richard
Harger's fly ball, but dropped it after
making the long run to the warning path.
Osuna coaxed the next hitter into pop
ping out to catcher Lyle Smith on a
sacrifice bunt attempt, but uncorked a
wild pitch that moved Harger to third base
with one man out. Enter the Cardinal
defense.
Smith snared another pop-up for the
second out, but this time he brought the
large afternoon crowd to its feet with a
spectacular diving, over-the- shoulder grab
as he crashed into the wall in foul territory
near the Berkeley dugout.
Alertly. Smith quickly fired the ball to
Osuna covering at home plate to prevent


Stanford fans kept the UC-Berkeley dugout tidy while the
Cardinal cleaned up on the Bears, taking the three-game

weekend series. The sweep put the Cardinal in second
place in the Pacific-10 Conference with a 4-2 mark.
