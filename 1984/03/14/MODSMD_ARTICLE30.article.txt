# Card sweep turns it around
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Junior shortstop John Verducci slapped
two run-scoring singles and saved another
run with a late-inning defensive gem to
key the surging Stanford baseball team to
a 4-2 victory over UC-Berkeley Sunday
that gave it a three-game sweep of its
cross-bay rivals.
The Cardinal raised its season record to
16-12-1 and 4-2 in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence with the win, its fourth consecutive,
and respective 13-3 and 9-6 victories on
Friday and Saturday. Yesterday's game
against Cal State Hayward was postponed
because of rain.
In the process, Stanford sent a warning
to the rest of the "Six-Pac" Southern
Division members that the defending
champions are not about to roll over and
die in 1984. And they did it by playing su
perb baseball, best exemplified by Sunday's
come-from-be hind triumph.
First, there was good pitching. Freshman
southpaw Al Osuna, who nearly started
(lie bull game according to Stanford Head
Coach Mark Marquess, bailed out starter

David Harris in the second inning after the
Bears had jumped to a 2-0 advantage.
Osuna went on to hurl seven shutout in
nings, quieting the Bears with just four hits
and outdueling Cal's Bren Conner (4-2),
the losing pitcher, to gain his second win
against no losses.
Second, there was timely hitting. The
kind of hitting that had been absent
throughout Stanford's early season non
conference schedule. Verducci, whose nine
game hitting string was snapped on Friday,
scored Mark Davis from third with a two
out single up the middle in the fourth to
cut the deficit to 2-1.
He put the Card on top to stay in the
bottom of the sixth with another two-out
single to center field, this time driving in
Walt Harris to give Stanford a 3-2 lead.
'"We felt that Verducci was much im
proved with the bat this year," said
Marquess in assessing his gifted
shortstop's new punch at the plate "What
has surprised us is that he's been a real
c/utch hitter."
Finally, there was the defense that

sealed the victory when the Bears
mounted a last gasp eighth-inning threat.
Ironically, it began when the Card's
leftfielder Mark Davis made the second
error of his collegiate career, and his
second in two games after going N6 con
tests without a miscue. Davis raced into
left-centerfield in pursuit of Richard
Harger's fly ball, but dropped it after
making the long run to the warning path.
Osuna coaxed the next hitter into pop
ping out to catcher Lyle Smith on a
sacrifice bunt attempt, but uncorked a
wild pitch that moved Harger to third base
with one man out. Enter the Cardinal
defense.
Smith snared another pop-up for the
second out, but this time he brought the
large afternoon crowd to its feet with a
spectacular diving, over-the- shoulder grab
as he crashed into the wall in foul territory
near the Berkeley dugout.
Alertly. Smith quickly fired the ball to

Harger from tagging and scoring from
third.
Verducci then ended the drama with his
own defensive wizardry, making a diving
stop behind second base of Jeff Ewiss'
sharp grounder and nipping him at first to
preserve Stanford's one-run cushion.
"You're never going to see better de
fensive plays than Verducci's and Smith s."
marvelled Marquess. "You can watch 100
years of major league baseball and you
won't see it."
Jell Ballard added a solo home run in
the Stanford eighth to close out the
scoring. Ballard's round-tripper gave him
two runs batted in for two plate appear
ances and seemed to be the only appropri
ate manner to replace first baseman Rick
l.undhlade. who left in the fifth inning
with a sore back.
It was l.undhlade who enjoyed the
finest collegiate game ot his career on
Friday, serv ing as a one-man wrecking crew
in the 13-3 victory. The junior blasted two
homers in consecutive innings, one of them
a grand slam in the seventh that sealed the

Bears' late . and knocked in seven runs
with his 3 tor 4 performance.
He jumped on starter Buddy Watts' 3-
ball-and-2-strike change-up in the sixth tor
a two-run shot that gave the Card its first
lead of the game at 4-3. In his next at-hat
l.undhlade crunched another two-strike
pitch, this one a slider from reliever Andy
Wortham. over the left-field fence for a
grand slam that highlighted a seven-run
seventh.
The ex-catcher appears to have found
his niche in Stanford's offensive scheme as
he continues to swing a hot bat of late,
going 17 for 42 (.3N6) in the last 1 I games,
lie also leads the club in RBIs with 2N.
"I'm just doing my part to help the
team out." lie commented after the big
effort. "Hitting in the four or live spot,
you've got to be able to knock in some
runs."
Lundblade's heroics overshadowed an
unusual complete game victory by his back
up at first base. Ballard, who on this day
was called upon to start on the mound for
only the second time in his last 39 appear
ances. He responded admirably, scattering
eight hits to boost his record to 3-2.
Marquess had nothing but praise for his
ace reliever-turned-starter saying that

••\ou have to give him a lot of credit. He
hends but he doesn't break. He s just a real
competitor who does what he has to do to
win."
In between the two contests at Sunken
Diamond, second baseman Pete Stanicek
added his name to the list ot heroes by
smacking two solo home runs in the Car
dinal's 9-6 win in Berkeley. Stanicek
stirred a fi\e-run first-inning outburst,
welcoming Cal's previously unbeaten Bryan
Price (6-1) to the Pae-10 in the process,
with a leadoff shot to lett field.
Stanford's early advantage had shrunk
to 5-4 when Stanicek drew a base on balls
to start a two-run rally in the fourth and
the junior second sackcr capped the after
noon off with his second homer in the top
ot the sixth.
The recipient ot Stanicek's generosity
was unbeaten John Radtke (5-0) who
yielded five runs total (three earned) in
five innings of work.
The Cardinal entertain St. Mary's today
at 2:30 p.m.. weather permitting, and will
then participate in the annual alumni game
at noon on Saturday. Stanford returns to
Pae-10 competition after exams when the
UCLA Bruins \ isit the Farm for a three
name set beginning Saturday, March 24.
