the set.
In the third set Gates opened a quick 5-

Gates closed out the match.
At No. 3. sophomore Kate Gompert re
corded the longest and hardest fought
straight-set victory of the year, defeating
Cathy Berry, 7-5, 6-3. In the first set
Gompert went down 5-4 and staved off
two set points before taking the next
three games and the set. The second sot
seemed a little easier, but each game was
fiercely contested until Gompert pulled
out the victory.
The only two seemingly easy Stanford
victories came at fourth and sixth singles.

defeated Dana Bleicher, 6-2. 6-0. It was

At No. I. freshman Patty lendick
dropped a tough 6-3. 6-2 match to Cvn
thi.i MacGregor. Stanford Head Coach
I rank B ten nan called MacGregor one of
the top three or four players in the nation,
and she certainly played up to the billing.
She agressively played the net and forced
I endick out ot her game. Brcnnan also
saiil. "Patty's had the momentum in her
matches before this today the momen
tum went against her."
At No. 5. freshman Stephanie Savidcs
lost .i disappointing 3-6. 6-4, 7-6 decision
tn t arol Neeld. I lie drama came ui the
third set when Savidcs opened at 6-5 lead,
but Neeld evened it at 6-6 and forced a
tie-breaker.
Neither player could open up a two
point lead, and it was tied up to N-N.
Savidcs then thought she had won the
next point, but Neeld contended that she
had called the shot out. Since there was no
umpire. Neeld"s call stood and she won the
next point to take the tie-breaker. 10-N.

without too much difficulty. Weiss and

Ihe No. I Stanford duo of Lldredge anil
Lendick played a tough match, but lost to
MacGregor and Howell. 7-5, 6-4. The
match was a dogfight, with San Diego
State unable to gain a two-game advan
tage until the end of both sets.
Brennan was not shocked by the diffi
culty ot the match. "I thought on paper
we would be stronger," he said. "But I
don t think we were a shoe-in in any of the
matches. We could've won all of them, but
we've always had tough matches with San
Diego State."

Hie C';ndinal's other two victories were
