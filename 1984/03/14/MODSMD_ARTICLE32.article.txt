### PETER CASTILLO 
Traditional wrestling powerhouse University
of lowa won its sixth straight championship, but
Stanford's Jeff Wilson proved to be an upstart
us he finished seventh and earned All-America
recognition at the NCAA Wrestling Champion
ships over the weekend.
Stanford also improved two notches over last
year by placing 33rd.
"This was a nice finish for our dual meet
season but was not indicative of how good the
team really was due to the injuries we suffered,"
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said.
Wilson, a senior, (177 pounds) won his first
match 14-0 over ninth-seeded Tim Cooper of
Tennessee. In Wilson's only bad match of the
tournament. Dan Chaid of Oklahoma defeated
him 20-1.
In order for Wilson to continue in the tourna
ment Chaid had to enter the semi-finals, which
he did. Wilson then faced fifth-seeded Matt
Dilika of Cleveland State and won 14-9, assuring
Wilson the All-America status.

Wilson's trek was slowed by eighth seed Bob
Harr of Penn State, losing 12-9. Wilson staged a
strong comeback to overcome Harr's early lead,
but fell short.
For seventh place Wilson wrestled Marv in
Jones of San Jose State, whom he lost to earlier
in the season. Jones held a 6-5 lead with only 15
seconds remaining, but Wilson scored a two
point takedown for a 7-6 victory.
"Wilson did not realize at first that he could
do so well at the NCAA, but he wrestled to his
ability and showed it was not impossible to do
well," commented Horpel. "Unfortunately this
was his first and last NCAA Championship."
Jeff Bradley, a sophomore, ( 134 pounds) /om
his first round match to Chris Delong ol Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo, 17-0. Scott Wiggen, a
sophomore. (142 pounds) lost to Scott Turner
of North Carolina State 2-1.
Horpel feels that both wrestlers benefited
from the experience and Wiggen has a good
chance to place next year. Bradley will be a dark
horse.
