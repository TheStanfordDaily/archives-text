fourth- or fifth-place
tinish," Head Coach Homer
Sardina said. "But we had
some fhisscs. 1 in not diYap
pointed in the girls at all
though. We improved over
our last year's conference
meet score by eight points,
which is the largest im
provement made bv any
team in the conference."

The Cardinal went up

by second-ranked Cal State
luillerton and third-ranked
Arizona State with team
totals of 186.50 and 185.40

Out of tne five regions the
first-place teams in each
region go to nationals, along
with the next five highest
scoring teams at large.
In order to have a chance
at nationals the Cardinal

must place at least a third in
the region. "We are capable
of doing that," s;iid Sardina.
"It would mean beating
Berkeley and Washington.
We need to hit 24 out of 24
routines which we haven't
done yet. but that is what
we've trained for. We're so
close to qualifying that all
we have to do is pull it to
gether."
For the Stanford men,
Friday night was ;i[so excit
ing with ;in easy \ictory over

State. Stanford compiled
Us third highest team total
ol the dual meet season
with a 270.10.
