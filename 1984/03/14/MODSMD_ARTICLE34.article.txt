# Women end year on familiar note

### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Saturday night's season
finale against San Diego State
may have been a fitting conclu
sion to a long and rather
frustrating season, as the
Stanford women's basketball
team dropped an 86-43 deci
sion to the Aztecs.
The loss gave Stanford a 5-
23 overall record for this
j season, 1-13 in the WCAA. San
Diego State, meanwhile, im
; proved to 23-4 overall, 9-4 in
the conference.
Possibly the most discourag
ing thing about the loss was
the play of the Cardinal. In its
last two outings, the Card had
shown some of the much
talked-about potential that it
has, beating Arizona, 60-57,
and losing to Arizona State,
84-72, in an outstanding game.
Saturday, however, the Card
seemed to revert to the way it
has played most of the season.
Stanford's only lead was six
minutes into the game at 7-6,
but San Diego State used a
swarming press that took the
Cardinal out of its offense as
the Aztecs opened a 37-23
halftime advantage. The ef
fect of the press was evident as
Stanford turned the ball over
18 times in the half.
The same pattern continued
into the second halt — Stan
ford's offense could not get
untracked, while San Diego
State kept right on rolling. The
Aztecs' center, Tina Hutchin
son, proved unstoppable as
well. The 6-foot-3 freshman

from East St. Louis, 111. — one
of the finest woman players to
visit Maples this year —
finished with 29 points on the
night. She was the WCAA
scoring leader going into the
game with a 30.2 per game
average.
The final statistics told the
story. Stanford had 34 turn
overs to San Diego State's
nine. The Card shot only 40
percent from the field and 39
percent from the line, to 50
percent from the field and 91
percent from the line for the
Aztecs. Finally, San Diego
State had four people in
double figures while Stanford
had only one.
That one was senior guard
Lee Ann Margerum. Playing in
her final game for Stanford,
Margerum led the Cardinal
with 12 points, six rebounds,
and three assists. After the
game Margerum summarized
what had happened. "They
were so quick, and it seemed
they knew all our plays. They
really did a good job coaching,
and they just out-hustled us."
The 5-7 native of Fountain
Valley had no regrets about en
ding her career. "It's time to
move on," she said. "It's been
fun, though. There have been
ups and downs, but I've really
enjoyed basketball." Margerum
conceded that this year had
contained more downs than
ups, but interjected an inside
remark, "We won one for the
Gipper," a reference to the


Freshman Karen Goedwaagen worked Hard in her first year,
but the Cardinal flailed, managing only five wins against 23
losses. Things may be brighter next year, as the Card returns
all but one of this year's team.
