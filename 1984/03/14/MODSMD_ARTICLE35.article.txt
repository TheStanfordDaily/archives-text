Coming off a successful
sweep of the Arizona
schools over the weekend,
the Stanford men's tennis
team faces its severest
home challenge this after
noon.
In what easily could turn
into a "battle of the
rankings," according to
Head Coach Dick Gould,
sixth-ranked Trinity Uni
versity invades the Varsity
Tennis Courts at 1:30 p.m.
With four of its six
singles players in the Na
tional Collegiate's Top 100,
Trinity poses a real threat
to the Cardinal's No. 2-
ranked squad.
"It should be a real good
match," said Gould.
"Trinity's one of the top
four [USC, UCLA and Pep
perdine as well] home
matches we'll have this
year."
Stanford boasts four
players in the Top 100 as
well. Eric Rosenleld, Mark
McKeen. Jim Grabb and
Dan Goldie fit the bill for
the Card. Along with John
Letts and Derrick Ros
tagno, they are looking tor
their 1 Ith team win this
season against only one
defeat.
However, as Gould ex
plains, "Our depth should
help us in this one."
