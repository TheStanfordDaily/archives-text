# South African exile raps Reagan policies
## 
### LISA PALMER 
"Ronald Reagan will go on
lying for the next four years
and the American people will
go on believing those lies."
Such was the "profoundly
pessimistic" prediction of
exiled South African poet and
Northwestern University Prof.
Dennis Brutus when he spoke
to an audience of 100 in
Tresidder Memorial Union
Friday night.
"Ronald Reagan has this
country and the world poised
on the edge of destruction,"
Brutus said.
Before a special move by the
U.S. State Department
brought Brutus to the United
States, he had been arrested
and subsequently shot by apar
theid forces for bringing the
attention of the international
community to South Africa's
racist policies in choosing
Olympic athletes, attention
that kept South Africa out of
recent Olympic Games. He
served time on Robben Island,
South Africa's maximum
security prison, before being
put under house arrest and fi
nally making his way to
America.
Brutus is sharply critical of
the Reagan administration's

policies toward South Africa.
"The Reagan policy of con
structive engagement, far
from making change, has em
boldened the apartheid regime
not only to oppress South
Africa, hut the entire South
African region."
He pointed out that the
United States has sold $28 mil
lion in military goods to the
apartheid regime â€” goods
which are used primarily to
fight the resistance forces.
The United States has $14.6
billion invested in South
Africa, Brutus said, and 300
large corporations, including
Bechtel and Ingersoll-Rand,
have substantial investments
in that country. "It is not rac
ism that is fundamental to the
apartheid system," Brutus
said. "What South Africa is
about is oppression in order to
ensure exploitation, in order to
ensure corporate profits."
Addressing the issue of what
students can do, Brutus point
ed out that Yale and Harvard
have each established
"Endowment for Divestiture"
funds which the universities
cannot utilize unless they
guarantee the money will not
be invested in South Africa.
