The University has honored six students with
Dean's Service Awards for their contributions
to Stanford and three freshmen with Boothe
Prizes for Excellence in Writing.
Business graduate student Peter Cramton
received a Dean's award for his "careful and in
genious adaptation of Knuth's Tex System to
benefit the Business School community; for the
resulting ease with which his faculty and student
colleagues may now use mathematical notations
in their technical reports; and for the clarity of
his explanations, making the complex compre
hensible and bridging the gaps between profes
sional specialties. . .
Civil Engineering graduate student Avery
Demond won the award for her "quiet and
forceful leadership in the Native American stu
dent community; organizing the American In
dian Science and Engineering Society and serving
as a catalyst for many other programs and
groups; and for the special skill and caring with
which she navigates between the Black and
Native American communities on campus. . . ."
Public Policy senior Gordon Hecker was named
for the "energy, optimism and wit he brings to
his many causes and concerns — especially his
two-year stint as a Row RA and his work for
ASSU and the Food Service Task Force; and for
his welcome if somewhat unnerving ability to
kindle in others motivation and energy almost
equal to his own. . .
Psychology graduate student Laurence
Maloney was praised for his "unique endurance
and success as a TA in the Psychology Depart
ment; for his sharing his time — and his knowl

edge of statistics, psychology and computers —
with such generosity and patience; and for the
expertise he contribitues to the teaching and re
search endeavors in his department. . .
American Studies senior Jan Nash received the
award for her "renowned enthusiasm and dedica
tion to excellence in all things — he it as an ad
vising associate, editor of Approaching
Stanford, manager of Frog's Lakeside Grill or
RA at Potter House; for a sense of humor as
abiding as her many loyalties. . . ."
Human Biology co-terminal student Sheila
Scobba was cited for "devoting her vast energy
to the renaissance of the Tresidder Union
Board, a group which has enjoyed her presence
for four consecutive years; for the wealth of her
good ideas, smiles, and organizational savvy that
characterize her contributions to her university;
and for her distinguished and active role in the
national 'college union' world. . . ."

Rich have won the autumn quarter Boothe
