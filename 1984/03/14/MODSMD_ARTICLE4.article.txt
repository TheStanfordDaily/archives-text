# Roads, budget also discussed

### HEATHER MILLAR Daily staff 
The Board of Trustees yesterday approved an ex
penditure of $2.2 million to extend Willow Road
from Arboretum Road to El Camino Real in the
hopes that this will reduce the traffic tie-ups that
have plagued the Stanford Shopping Center parking
lot for almost three decades.
This allocation of funds ends a controversy which
has raged for more than 50 years over whether Willow
Road should be extended. Neighboring communities
had feared that such an extension would pave the way
for the state to construct a full freeway system I
through Palo Alto.
With the resolution, or at least the defusing of this
controversy, Stanford commuters will he able to rest
easy by the spring of 1986, when the project is
predicted to be completed.
The area becomes particularly congested when eve
ning commute traffic, mostly from campus, heads for
El Camino Real.
The Board also yesterday approved the Operating
Budget Guidelines for the 1984-85 school year which
recommend a balanced budget of $246,935,000, or
9.1 percent more than the budget for this year. The

operating budget does not include the Hospital or the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, which have sep
arate budgets.
Like 12 of the last 15 operating budgets, this one
includes some significant cuts while still setting aside
money for "consolidations and improvements," or the
ability to do truly new things within the University.
Expenditure cuts of .8 percent were recommended
while salaries are to increase an average of 1 percent.
The budget also recommends substantial investments
in computers for faculty, thus pushing the figure set
aside for new things or "real growth" up 2 percent.
