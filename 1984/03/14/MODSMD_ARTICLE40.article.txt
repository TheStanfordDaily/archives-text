## 
### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
The leader of the Communist
Party of the United States of
America (CPUSA) yesterday told
about 60 people at the Law
School that the world faces a
"choice between coexistence and
no existence" with the current
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
(Jus Hall, general secretary of
the CPUSA and presidential can
didate, said he blames President
Reagan and his policies for the
tear in the world today over global
annihilation. He compared Reagan
to Adolf Hitler, accusing him of
spreading the "evil empire-big lie"
of anticommunism.
"There is no real discussion
about real socialism," he said.
Instead, "There is a gigantic
fraud being perpetrated against

the American people" because
there is no "honest rejection" of
Marxist theories, he said.
The Soviet Union has made the
real initiative in arms talks. Hall
said.
"They made some concessions
with SAI. I II that I wouldn't
have made," he said. In regards to
current negotiations. Hall
remarked that he thinks the So
viet Union is doing much more in
the area of sincere proposals than
the United States.
Hall said world leaders have told
him that concern over the possi
bility of nuclear war has increased
because of the contradictory sig
nals issued by the Reagan adminis
tration. It is impossible to be in
favor of arms control and arms re
duction and be involved at the
same time in increasing the nu

clear arsenal and deploying new
nuclear weapons, he said.
"There cannot be both guns and
butter," Hall said.
Hall also outlined the CPUSA
platform. In accordance with
Marxist doctrine, all
"corporations, banks and the
Pentagon" would be made public
property, he said. There would be
a five-year moratorium on the na
tional debt, and Reagan's "give
away corporate tax breaks" would
be revoked.
