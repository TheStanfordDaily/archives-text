# University group to investigate corporate investment policies

### BAIE NETZER Staff writer 
The newly reactivated Stanford Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) will meet tomorrow with
University President Donald Kennedy to discuss sales of
U.S.-banned drugs abroad by corporations in which the
University owns stock.
According to Business School Prof. Kirk Hanson,
chairman of the commission, the CIR hopes to get gen
eral background from Kennedy, a former head of the
Food and Drug Administration, before considering spe
cific shareholder resolutions which would review the sale
of U.S.-banned dipyrone and Depo-Provera abroad.
Dipyrone, a fever reducing drug, was banned in the
United States in 1977 because of risks of serious blood
disorders. The contraceptive Depo-Provera has been as
sociated with various controversial side effects.
If the CIR decides that the sale of U.S.-banned drugs
abroad constitutes "social injury," it will then consider
individual proposals to Sterling Drug and Upjohn, two
corporations in which the University owns shares, Han
son said.
First established in 1971, the CIR serves in an advisory
capacity to the Board of Trustees' Subcommittee on In
vestment Responsibility. Composed of faculty, staff,
students and alumni, the committee considers share
holder proposals to corporations in which the University
has invested.
In order to re-evaluate its process of considering
shareholder resolutions, the CIR did not convene in
1981-82. The result of this evaluation was to limit the
number of resolutions considered by the committee.
The CIR did reconvene in 1982-83, but there was not
time for the committee to recommend voting its shares.

According to Hanson, the CIR will also be researching
resolutions on the world debt crisis and employment
policies in South Africa. Hanson said it is likely that the
CIR will recommend voting its shares in support ot at
least some of the resolutions.
"These proposals hardly ever win." he said, "but when
an institution such as Stanford votes in favor ot them,
it tends to have more clout and place more pressure on
the corporations to voluntarily take some sort of ac
tion."
Hanson also said the CIR is especially interested in
hearing from members of the Stanford community, in
cluding students, who are involved in studying any ot the
issues it is considering.
The CIR will be considering proposals outlined by Bis
hop Desmond Tutu, general secretary of the South
African Council of Churches. Shareholders want to
adopt Tutu's resolution or call for withdrawal of U.S.
corporations from South Africa.
The proposals call for the enforcement ot fair labor
practices and massive investment in black education and
training by U.S. corporations in South Africa.
Hanson said it is probable that the CIR will determine
corporate activities in South Africa to be socially in
jurious and will therefore likely. recommend that the
Board of Trustees vote its shares in favor of shareholder
proposals to General Meters. Mobil, Texaco and Xerox.
If the CIR recommends voting Stanford's shares in fa
vor of some or all of the shareholder proposals, it will
then be up to the Subcommittee on Investment Respon
sibility to make the final decision.
"In the past, the Trustees' committee has usually fol
lowed the advice of the CIR if we have a unanimous
vote." Hanson said.
