Alpha Phi Alpha gained official
University recognition Monday, be
coming Stanford's 17th currently
recognized fraternity.
Alpha Phi Alpha President Tony
Nolen said that although his group
will not seek University housing soon.
University recognition will be a major
boost for the fraternity.
The fraternity will be able to offi
cially meet on campus now, and
"being a recognized organization, we
can have a lot of projects on campus
with our name on them," Nolen said.
Nolen said Alpha Phi Alpha will

not participate in fraternity rush
this spring because his fraternity's
recruitment procedures are "really
quite different" from that of most
fraternities.
Alpha Phi Alpha recruits new
members through a process in which
candidates submit applications and
meet with fraternity members
before becoming part of the group.
Five applicants will go through the
pledge process this spring, Nolen said.
Nolen said that Alpha Phi Alpha,
founded in 1906, is the oldest na
tional black fraternity.
