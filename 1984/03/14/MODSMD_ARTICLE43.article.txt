downtime is over, but the work
rolls on. Phe Daily doesn't, though.
You're reading the last Daily of win
ter quarter. We return Mondav.
April 2 for the homestretch.
Daily staffers remember . . . pay
checks are in for salaried folks, you're
got to be back on Saturday or Sunday
before spring quarter to get the
proverbial ball rolling for Monday's
paper (which will include news, wire,
inside, prof, comm., ops and spo), and
edit board meets Monday, April 2 at
noon. Until then .. . 30.
