# The 						world (and everything) according to Uelsmann

### ROBERT WOOLSEY 
Jerry N. Uelsmann
Through April 21, 1984
The Photographer's Gallery
540 Ramona Street, Palo Alto

Jerry Uelsmann has a good photographic
eye; his photographic vision, however, ex
tends much further. Only one or two of his
pictures can tell you that he is limited by
nothing more than his imagination, and a
collection of his works shows that he has
earned tha» luxury. But unlike so many
others, Uelsmann has channeled his
creativity very successfully in a limited
medium where unbridled imagination can
often obscure, and even obviate, a photo
graph's raison d'etre. "Hell, why not just
paint?"
Photographically speaking, Uelsmann is
straight, a post-secession photographer in
the midst of that sharp focus tradition
which originated in California and persists
here today. Unsatisfied with what he has
found in nature, however, he has recreated
it in flawless composite images which
betray his ties to even older, 19th-century
photographic attitudes. Then, photog
raphers struggling for artistic credibility
felt obligated to manipulate their work in
an almost painterly fasion — revealing na
ture as they saw it and not how it was seen
— with results occasionally too perverse
for words.
When pictorialism gratefully faded, and
photography established itself as art in
the secession and later in the straight
image, naturalism not only was accepted
but it became the norm (who among us has
not heard of Ansel Adams?). Uelsmann, in
reaching back to the composite image, has
shaken off its 19th century manipulative
artistic justification (always a thorn in
photography's side), perfected its tech
nique, and quite literally has thrown the
doors open to all kinds of photographic
possibility. There is a problem, though,
that until there is some kind of vaccine

against normal human frustration, few
would ever accumulate enough patience,
skill, or simple touch to do this kind of
work even half as well as Uelsmann.
Uelsmann's crisp, black and white images
at once defy reality and mock surrealism.
A fog-shrouded forest of leafless trees
growing out of a delicate, mosaic tile
floor? Some of the pictures breathe Es
cher, but this is photography, and none of
it is so alarming or haphazard as to put it
out of the realm of possibility in
Uelsmann or his viewer's imaginations. A
team of CIA analysts would be hard
pressed to prove that orbs don't hover
about protectively, or that surf doesn't
roll out of thickly ivied buildings, or that
the occasional woman does not have a win
dow in her palm. In one of his more
deceptively simple techniques, Uelsmann
put a small rowboat on a cube of water and
printed it next to a cube of sky; many of
his pictures are more intricate than this,
but none better illustrates his leap in
photographic thought.
Uelsmann, it turns out, is not the
hookah-puffing guru of the mind-bending
neo-pictorialism of the '70s, but a rather
amiable 50-year-old professor of photog
raphy at the University of Florida, holding
three degrees ending in "A," a tweed coat
and glasses. He stood out not in the least
from the 150 people packed into The
Photographer's Gallery a week ago Sunday.
In one end of the room people were speak
ing of the "spiritual effervescence"
revealed in his work while in the other end
Uelsmann repeated patiently that his
pictures were conceived with only the
faintest idea of what they would eventu
ally become. "Children" is his own term
and manifestly appropriate. So much of
Uelsmann is in them yet they all have
unique, and often disparate, identities
which seem to speak to us individually.
They're even precocious in a sense, inno
cently reading out what is unwarily read in,
leaving themselves, and Uelsmann. largely

undisclosed.
It's certainly no crime to leave viewers
on their own. For those at the opening,
though, the missing link, Uelsmann him
self, was standing right there. But others
not so fortunate to meet him might he
misled — not to mention overwhelmed —
by this collection, on the one hand by its
seemingly bottomless imagery and on the
other, by how it sometimes repetitively
appears to dwell in metaphor. Any authen
tic meaning, if it is to be found, slips
through our lingers, as diaphanous as his
ceilings of sky, or veils of grass. Uelsmann,
speaking as a true eclectic, offers both
that his pictures say far more than he, and
that they have a peculiar way of
photographically "explaining the possibili
ties of man."
To be conscious of his eclecticism may be
the best advice to lend the viewer going to
this show. Uelsmann is a straight-shooter
— that much is clear. He earned his B.F.A.
under the instruction of Minor White, an
icon of naturalism at the Rochester In
stitute of Technology. He later received
his M.F.A. at Indiana University, long the
home of Henry Holmes Smith, whose
multiple-color photographic abstractions
have been bucking trends for most of his
75 years. Uelsmann is also a guest
instructor for Ansel Adams in the Friends
of Photography workshops, where his pres
ence, rest assured, is vital and welcomed.
With this in mind we can meet
Uelsmann and his images half-way, accept
ing both for what they are — no more, and
certainly no less. Suspend judgement but
leave belief intact; Uelsmann toys shame
lessly with belief anyway (and proves it by
including a couple of pictures which are
not composites, although he was reluctant
to divulge which planet he took them on).
There is no doubt about his credibility as a
photographer, however, perhaps one of
the most acclaimed living in this country
today. Take a look at this show — you've
probably seen nothing like it — and see if
you think he's worth it as well.

Jerry N. Uelsmann
Through April 21, 1984
The Photographer's Gallery
540 Ramona Street, Palo Alto

Jerry Uelsmann has a good photographic
eye; his photographic vision, however, ex
tends much further. Only one or two of his
pictures can tell you that he is limited by
nothing more than his imagination, and a
collection of his works shows that he has
earned tha» luxury. But unlike so many
others, Uelsmann has channeled his
creativity very successfully in a limited
medium where unbridled imagination can
often obscure, and even obviate, a photo
graph's raison d'etre. "Hell, why not just
paint?"
Photographically speaking, Uelsmann is
straight, a post-secession photographer in
the midst of that sharp focus tradition
which originated in California and persists
here today. Unsatisfied with what he has
found in nature, however, he has recreated
it in flawless composite images which
betray his ties to even older, 19th-century
photographic attitudes. Then, photog
raphers struggling for artistic credibility
felt obligated to manipulate their work in
an almost painterly fasion — revealing na
ture as they saw it and not how it was seen
— with results occasionally too perverse
for words.
When pictorialism gratefully faded, and
photography established itself as art in
the secession and later in the straight
image, naturalism not only was accepted
but it became the norm (who among us has
not heard of Ansel Adams?). Uelsmann, in
reaching back to the composite image, has
shaken off its 19th century manipulative
artistic justification (always a thorn in
photography's side), perfected its tech
nique, and quite literally has thrown the
doors open to all kinds of photographic
possibility. There is a problem, though,
that until there is some kind of vaccine

against normal human frustration, few
would ever accumulate enough patience,
skill, or simple touch to do this kind of
work even half as well as Uelsmann.
Uelsmann's crisp, black and white images
at once defy reality and mock surrealism.
