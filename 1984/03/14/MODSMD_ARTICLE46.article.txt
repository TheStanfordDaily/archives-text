# How sweet it is!
## Mary Wells: warmth and vigor 
### KARL JOHNSEN 
Some good music is returning with the
new Motown revival, inspired by the dis
tortedly commercial movie, "The Big
Chill." The best news is that the music
survives this beating and retains its in
tegrity and energy. The renewed interest
has had a good effect on the artists them
selves, and some are even performing in
public again. Oh. how sweet it is!
Mary Wells, the first queen of Motown,
is making her comeback. She has obviously
changed in the 24 years since Motown
released its first single, a song she wrote
and sang at the age ol I?, called "Bye, Bye
Baby." From that time until now she has
charted 25 singles on Billboard, and is due
for another with her upcoming release,
"Gigolo."
She didn't play any of her new material
last week at the Mabuhay Gardens, but
that was the only disappointment of the
entire evening. She sang powerfully and
beautifully, sending shivers down my spine.
She has lost none of her vocal prowess in
her absence from the stage.
Her 40-minute show, although short by
today's pop standards, was typical of the
length usually given by performers of that
era. If you wanted more and were for
tunate enough to have gone to the 9
o'clock show, the Mabuhay was kind
enough to allow you to attend the second
show at no extra charge, with as many ex

its and re-entries as you please.
Wells led the show off with "Beat Me
to the Punch." which she sang with all the
punch she could give, showing no signs of
faltering or uneasiness; she was
sensitively backed by her lead-off man.
Will Porter.
For her next song, "Two Lovers," whe
introduced Curtis Womack, who added to
the spirit of the male backup. In fact, the
power and range that he could supply left
the sensitivity of Porter's, style lar in the
background. The soul and fire he injected
into the performance were far more essen
tial to the sound that Wells tried to
create.
The next high point was a medley of
older soul greats that began with
"Wonderful World." Their rendition put
the popular Art Garfunkel version to
shame. They then moved into "She Don't
Love You Like I Love You" by the Impres
sions, which was followed by "Working on
the Train."
She then sang what she described as "the
cream of her crop" — her biggest hit, "My
Guy." Definitely the song that everyone
was waiting lor. Wells gave a performance
that matched everyone's expectations.
From there she sang "Bye, Bye Baby,"
leading into her finale. "Shout" from the
lsley Brothers. On this song the most evi
dent vocalist was Womack. who gave every
bit of energy the song could have. They ne
glected. however, to include the audience

response in this one, usually the most ex
citing part of the song. But they had had
poor luck with response earlier, and it
probably was wiser to rely on their own tal
ent and let the crowd come in of their own
volition. The warmth and vigor of the
show was overwhelming, making it a calm
and quiet ride home.
The Mabuhay earns a place among my
favorite nightclubs with its small, inti
mate atmosphere, red lights and "dark,
dusky alley" effect of its stage. Particu
larly effective is the brick backdrop,
painted red and white in a splashy, Jasper
Johns fashion. It had an understated inte
rior with little on the walls to distract
from the performance, but it was not so
barren as to alienate or make the audience
uncomfortable.
The sound was perfectly engineered for
the room and style of the performers and
provided ample punch but didn't leave
your ears ringing. There was also a side
room with a bar, but the show was tar too
interesting and the table service far too
good to need to explore that halt of the
, building. It is perhaps best known for its
punk nights, but that really does little
justice to the other entertainment that it
provides. Definitely a place to see on one
of those nights that Stanford seems a
little too tame, and you need to see the
bright lights of Broadway. (The Mabuhay
is located on 443 Broadway, in the center
of San Francisco).
