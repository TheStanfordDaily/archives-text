Johnny McLaughlin's tal
ent as a guitarist has been
beyon <J CJ nest ion for u
couple of decades now. ever
since his days with Miles
Davis and later with the
Mahavishnu Orchestra. In
1978, McLaughlin teamed
with 18 similarly proficient
musicians and put together
"Electric Guitarist." The
seven cuts on the album
range from a solo to a sep
tet, and they represent the
depth that McLaughlin had
achieved (and retains) — he
authored six of the seven
tracks.
Chick Corea, Stanley
Clarke and Jack
DeJohnnette accompany
McLaughlin on "Do You
Hear The Voices That You

L.eft Behind?", a composi
tion that provides plenty of
opportunity for bass,
guitar, piano and drums to
take the lead.
The .timmiing
•"Phenomenon: Compul
sion" features McLaughlin
along with drummer Billy
Cobham. a combination
that presents a relentless
three-minute attack of
guitar and percussion. "My
Foolish Heart" shows us the
softer side of McLaughlin's
instrument; this solo piece
is the only composition of
the LP that was not written
by him. Other cuts on the
album feature well-known
musicians including Carlos
Santana, David Sanborn,
Jack Bruce, Patrice Rushen
and Tony Williams.
Every combination that
McLaughlin tried on

"Electric Guitarist" works
well, and the friendship
that the musicians have is
apparent. Of the many works
that John McLaughlin has
created over the years, this
album is probably the best
statement of the respect
that his fellow musicians
have for him.
("Electric Guitarist" will be
featured on Fri. at 10 a.m.
during Album Week.)
