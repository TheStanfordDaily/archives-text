Dr. John

Clean Cut Records
This new solo album from
Mac Rebennack, also known
as Dr. John, perfectly
evokes the images of his
native New Orleans. Listen
ing to Rebennack's ex
quisite blues piano playing,
as well as his gritty vocals on
four of the 10 tracks, one
can clearly visualize a small
smoky Bourbon Street
nightclub with a stage con
sisting solely of an upright
piano and a microphone.
Though Dr. John's career
spans over two decades, he
only recently started to pel
form strictly solo, enabling

him to better demonstrate
his piano technique. Alter
giving the album a listen,
one realizes why the man is
so highly respected in the
business. He seems to weave
his way through the set
without any worries at all.
For the most part, the ma

terial is pure blues, though
some faster boogie, such as
"Boxcar Boogie" can be
found. Perhaps the best cut
is a co-composition of
Rebannack's "Average Kind
of Guy." This tune features
the Doc singing about the
troubles of being
"overworked, underpaid,
underloved and overlaid."
Dr. John ends the album
with another original com
position, "Suite Home New
Orleans." This instrumental
piece has a very haunting
rhythmic as well as melodic
structure which give the
work a notebook quality.
It's as though he is summing
up all of his feelings about
the city into one.
