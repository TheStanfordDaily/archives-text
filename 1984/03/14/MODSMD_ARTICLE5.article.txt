The yet-to-be-completed CIS is
the world's largest joint effort in
microcircuits and related fields by in
dustry, government and academia. It
currently conducts about $15 million

annually in research, mostly with
federal funds, but was originally
created by gifts of $750,000 each
from 20 corporations.
About 350 people have been
invited to the reception, including

students, faculty, staff, trustees,
alumni and members of the French
government.
Mitterrand's visit is expected to
focus attention on the academic and
cultural ties between France and the
University.
The Stanford-in-Tours campus was
established in 1960. and an estimated
2000 undergraduates have partici
pated in study programs at Tours in
the past 14 years.
Approximately 60 French students
are enrolled in the University, mainly
at the graduate level. The majority
pursue science and engineering pro
grams.
And in IM7S. then-University Pres
ident Richard Lyman was awarded
the Legion of Honor in recognition
of the relations achieved between
Stanford and the French scholarly
community.
