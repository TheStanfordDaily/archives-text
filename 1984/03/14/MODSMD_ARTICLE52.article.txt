# Mirlo's 'Endgame' agonized, misses the humor and the game
## 
### DUN GIFFORD, JR 
Mirlo's recent production of
Samuel Bcckett's "Endgame"
set a fitting tone for the hor
rors of Dead week.
Director John Wilkins' gruel
ing version of this play abounds
with screams of agony, dazed
confusion and complaints of
utter senselessness.
But this staging was so
infused with bitterness that
Beckett's lighter side did not
come through. It is his irony
and wit that makes
"Endgame" absurd, and not
pessimistically nihilistic.
The production, which
played in Mirlo last Wednesday
through Saturday, was to be
praised for its consistent and
focused interpretation. The
actors did not lose themselves
in Beckett's reknowned
obscurity, but maintained their
bleak interpretation through
out.
In addition the players, who
worked with limited space and
set materials, created a simple
atmosphere in which their
message was clearly commun
icated. This performance was
done for the love of drama.
However, as indicated by Be
ckett's numerous stage direc
tions, the action must be
constantly changing tone to
make the play not just a
lecture on Beckett's views but
dramatic action.
"Endgame's" potency lies in
its ability to communicate Be
ckett's ideas on the human
condition through often
lighthearted dialogue between
Hamm and Clov, the two
central characters in the play.
The title contains the tragic
and comic elements in it: Its
disturbing qualities come from
the fact that it is the "end":
"It's the end Clov, we've come

to the end," says Hamm. Its
humor comes from the element
of "game": "The whole thing is
comical, 1 grant you that," says
Hamm.
This game goes on between
Hamm (John Wilkins), who is
sick and confined to a wheel
chair for the entirety of the
play, and Clov (Greg Watkins),
who takes care of him.
Hamm rarely moves from
the center of the stage, but
continually wonders about his
past out loud, tries to tell
stories that he no longer can
remember and directs Clov to
find out what is happening
outside their window.
There is no purpose to their
game. It is part of the unex
plicable cycle of generations.
As one figure comes to
maturity or power he subjects
his oppressors to dependency
and then assumes a role of
domination over the next gen
eration. Since it is the end of
the game it is also the end of
Hamm and Gov's period of
mutual enslavement.
The action is filled with a
sense of fatality. "Something
is taking its course," says Clov
from time to time.
Clov is ambivalent about
leaving Hamm, for he knows he
will lose llamm's protection in
the next step of the fated
cycle.
Nagg and Nell, who spend
the play in ashcans, are what
Hamm will become, dejected
and needy. Marc Ferrari and
Gino Bertolino played Nagg
and Nell excellently. Their
sensitive and finely tuned ex
changes captured both the
comic and the tragic, the play
ful and the serious, the inti
mate and the wrathful.
Nell is a foil for Nagg to
express his past, which sounds

so similar to Hamm's, Though
Nagg is no longer actively en
gaged in the struggle, but living
his last moments, he still pos
sesses the complexity of
Hamm's character. Ferrari was
especially deft at capturing the
poignant mixture of hopeful
ness and sadness that charac
terize Nagg.
However, Hamm and Clov
were so hateful of each other
in this production that none of
Gov's ambivalence about
leaving, which is a central
drama in the play, is commun
icated. We were given only the
hate of their love-hate rela
tionship.
Wilkins' portrayal of Hamm
was both consistent and pow
erful. His energy bordered on
the insane and swept away
both himself and his audience
on a wave of passion and anger.
This emotional intensity
however also blurred the
childlike badgering that goes
on between Hamm and Clov in
the original and turned it into
caustic melodrama.
Watkins' haunting and de
tached Clov feeds the
flames of Hamm's rage. Wat
kins' incessant limp was espe
cially forceful, but the
character he envisioned could
not rise to the humor of the
part.
Though Hamm and Clov do
at times despise each other, in
the text they are capable of
near brotherly intimacy as if
they had merged into one mind
that thinks out loud. This mind
is ultimately impotent to alter
the course of their destiny,
which is also the course of the
play.
Like the audience, they sit
back and watch it or take part
in disinterestedness. "What's
happening, what's happening?"

Hamm asks Clov.
Again, Watkins' and Wilkins

are so polarized in their rela
tionship that they fail to

achieve this intimacy and com
passion that the two share in

the face of their common fate,
and this makes Hamm and Clov
not pathological figures, but
representative of us all.
As the play winds down, we
see the unravelling of Hamm
and Clov's relationship, and we
also see the unravelling of the
words in the play itself.
In one of his final soliloquys,
Hamm composes a line of
metered verse out loud, cor
recting and repeating himself
until he has it right.
It is the end of the game be
tween Clov and Hamm and the
end of our relationship with
the play.
Hamm is pensive and self
conscious at this point, both of
himself as Hamm, and himself
as an actor, but Wilkins
delivers the lines with a sar
casm which fails to capture the
moment.
The director and his talented
actors had a specific interpre
tation of this play in mind, and
unlike so many other plays,
consistently carried it through
to the bitter end. But without
the game, something was mis
sing.
