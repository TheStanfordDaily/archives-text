# 'Against All Odds' a vague jumble, not even grand low time

Three-quarters of the way
through Against All Odds.
Taylor Hackford's revamping
of Out of the Past, I realized
that I'd stopped following the
plot half an hour earlier, when
ex-football player Jeff Bridges
and Rachel Ward, the woman
he'd been hired by James
Woods to track down, were
surprised in flagrante delictii by
Alex Karras, Bridges' former
trainer, who had been sent by
Woods to find both of them,
and then Bridges and Karras
got into a fight during which
Karras drew a gun on Bridges
and almost shoved him off a
cliff, but decided he couldn't
kill his best friend, and so saved
Ins life instead, only to be shot
himself by Rachel Ward, who
then ran away from Bridges
and turned up some time later
in Woods' house, once more
ensconced as his live-in girl
friend. That was the last clear
piece of plotting I could re

jumble; I could barely distin

schemes by assorted other
characters to shave points in
football games. Eventually I
got the sense that everyone in
the movie was implicated
somehow, so the eleventh-hour
revelations about how the
hierarchy was set up held con
siderably less surprise than the
screenwriter, Eric Hughes,
must have intended.
Jacques Tourneur's 1947 Out

of the Past has something of a
cult status among film noir
aficionados, and though it's a
fairly crummy picture, it is in
fact better directed and more
enjoyable than Against All
Odds. Hackford has paid
homage to the original by in
venting a role for Jane Greer,
who played the Rachel Ward
part nearly four decades ago
(opposite Robert Mitchum,
and with Kirk Douglas as the
gangster who wants her back).
And Richard Widmark's pres
ence confirms the movie's heri
tage: He played,
unforgettably, psychotic
Tommy lido in the most fa
mous film noir of them all. Kiss
of Death, the same year — a
role much like the one James
Woods played in the 1979 The
Onion 112 ield, which also at
tempted to resurrect the noir
spirit (and partly succeeded).
(A further bit of trivia: Jeff
Bridges' first screen appear
ance, as a four-month-old
baby, was in Jane Greer's arms
in The Company She Keeps, in
1951.) But Hacktord's first

movie. The Idohnaker. showed
more noir energy than Against
All Odds (and was a lot more
lun). and his second. An Officer
and a Gentleman, was a far su
perior piece of craftsmanship.
Against All Odds, though
evocatively shot by Donald
Thorin. has only one especially
well directed sequence — a
remarkably tense car chase
early in the picture — and even
that lacks the impact it could
have had: It doesn't erupt out
of the plot at all. so we have no
real stake in the outcome.
As the football player. Jeff
Bridges contributes his vivid
persona — he also looks
amazingly handsome (and con
vincingly muscular) — and Rac
hel Ward's idiosyncratic,
not-quite-New-Wave sexiness
is right for her role; you can
believe she is who she says she
is. But there's nothing going on
between these two, and with
out sexual chemistry, their
scenes together, which could
have held the film together,
seem rather pointless. Hack
ford has surrounded them with

gifted actors like James
Woods. Saul Rubinek. Swoosie
Kurtz. Bill McKinney and
Dorian Harewood. but the sup
porting roles are just a pit
tance — even Woods", though

he is nominally the third lead.
(He can play sleazo roles like
this one in his sleep.) Given
Tavlor Hackford's record, and
his (perhaps dead-ended) love
for old movies — An Officer

tuul (i Gentleman recycled elev
ens — I'd anticipated a grand
low time ;it Against All Odds,
hut like the other recent
remakes of old Hollywood
movies, it is easily torgotten.
