## If you are what you eat you are a pretty good person at Chez Louis

Chez Louis
4170 El Camino \
Palo Alto
493-1660
Man ist was man isst.
I won't insult you by trans
lating what I know is a pretty
weary adage. But I start with
it for two reasons.
The first is to assure you
that I'm cosmopolitan enough
to review a restaurant with
European cuisine, even if I did
live in Oshkosh, Wisconsin
before moving to Wheat
Ridge, Colorado.
But more importantly I'd
like you to really believe man ist
was man isst — and then carry
it to its logical, local extreme.
Because if you really are what
you eat — I'm sorry, but if I
don't translate it the editor
in-chief will get really confused
when he's checking for typos —
and you live in Palo Alto, you
could be in a lot of trouble.
After all, it's widely ac
knowledged that Palo Alto has
more mediocre overpriced res
taurants than Skylonda or La
Honda, or even Tuba City,
Arizona.
Which means that if you are
what you eat, and you live in
Palo Alto, chances are that a
good share of the time you're
mediocre and overpriced, or
maybe even a bad person.
And even if you don't
believe that. — 1 won't-weaken
my argument by trying to
defend it — you've got to con
cede that if you live in Kent.
Ohio, a 16-inch six item
Domino's Pizza costs $4.95.
And if it's not delivered in 30
minutes or less, it's free.
I hate exclamation marks,
but $4.95!
A couple nights ago I ordered
the Stanford equivalent. A
mere $15.89, but don't worry.
If it's more than 30 minutes
old, it's still $ 15.59.
In other words, that 2 a.m.
sick-to-your-stomach feeling
could be 321 percent harder to
achieve here than in Kent.
And here's the real travesty:
You could spend that same
$15.N9 at dozens of Midpenin
sula restaurants and have a less
pleasant time than you would
watching some bleary-eyed
Domino's person scrambling to
find your terminal at LOTS.
But what's important is that
Palo Alto isn't always this way.
It may ruin my argument, but I
know where you can channel
that $15.N9 toward some really

good food and tasteful sur
roundings — food and sur
roundings Kent and most other
places just can't match.
No valet parking
But my editor just glared at
me, so I'd better retreat to the
standard chronological review
ing techique.
The lady and I didn't know
what to expect at Chez Louis.
But the evening started off
right: The place is easy to find,
only ten minutes south on El
Camino Real, and no valet
parking (just how much are you
supposed to tip those valet
guys and how do you know they
won't do doughnuts in the
parking lot while you're inside
eating?). My VW stopped dis
creetly between a couple of
Mercedes and we hopped out,
all dressed up and, at least in
my case, a bit self-conscious.
The maitre d' sort of helped
me relax: He was polite enough,
and didn't make me feel like a
plouque the way some maitre
d's do. He led us to a little
table in an exceedingly pleasant
dining room: high, vaulted wood
ceiling, stone fireplace, paned
picture windows. The copper
pots and kettles hanging from
the walls glowed warmly in the
soft light of the delicate hur
ricane lamps on each table.
Notice I say soft light. This
shouldn't be confused with
sleazy light, a la Ecco in the
Hyatt Palo Alto (you know,
the restaurant where the
waiters wear green velour
tuxedos).
Chez Louis is one of those
places where you can decide
whether to watch the other
diners without feeling that
you're on exhibit. And that's
only fair, even if it isn't logical.
Wining and worrying
After asking for the wine
list, I started worrying. I've
learned about wine trial-and
error, mostly error. John, our
charming "French" waiter
(from Paris, Texas is my guess)
brought back a 13-page bound
volume with vino ranging from
$6 to $ 1 500 per bottle.
That was a bit of a relief. It

meant basically ordering by
price, not by vintage. We opted
for the Rothschild Mouton
Cadet, 1980 ($l6).
It wasn't very good, but
don't blame Chez Louis. As the
lady said, "$l6 seems pretty
cheap for Rothschild. I bet they
hosed out the vats after they
made the good wine and
bottled the rinsed out part in
stead of throwing it out."
Methinks the lady doth
protest too much: As I
predicted, it started to taste
pretty good after three or four
glasses.
S-Car-Go
I can't talk about the hors d'
oeuvres without tracing my
personal experience with escar
gots. I'd had them — well actu
ally, I'd had one of them — at
age 11.
"Here, have one of these,"
my father had told me.
"They're really good. It's kind
of like steak."
1 bit in. It was nothing like
steak, especially after Dad told
me it was a snail.
But I didn't spit it out, even
{hough it tasted like dirty
bubble gum. There's nothing
like instilling trust in your
children.
But Chez Louis changed all
that. The Escargots de Bour
gogne aux Croutons ($4.50)
tasted so good I wanted to call
up my folks and cry.
The lady chose Coquille St.
Jacques ($4.95). With my usual
grace, I leaned over the table
and tried to poke my fork into
the little scallops, but one of
them fell off en route to my
plate and splattered on the
table. I was embarrassed when
John came to pick up the
plates, but in retrospect 1
suppose he was too busy being
French to piece together what
had happened.
Chez Louis bread is crusty
and mild. I'm not one to bitch
about whether the butter is
hard or soft, so just don't ask.
Forgive me, Residential Edu
cation, but the wine was
working wonders for my dis
position by the time John

popped in with the soupe du
jour, included in the meal. On
Saturday it happened to be
cream of vegetable, a very good
cream of vegetable.
Interjection: You'd better be
with good company when you
visit Chez Louis, and don't be
in a hurry. The service is at
tentive but very definitely
leisurely, proportioned to the
warmth of wine and my very
attractive accomplice.
A test of will
The main course arrived just
when desired. For the lady, the
Specialite du jour, Red Snapper
with Salmon Mousse and
Cream and Shallot Sauce
($16.75), covered with zucchini
carefully sliced and arrayed to
resemble fish scales. I delved
into Veau aux Champignons

Sauvages, replete with im
ported forest-mushroom sauce
($15.75).
Both exquisite — the sauces
were light but a bit strong,
nonetheless excellent. The ac
companying carrots, beans and
potatoes were particularly
flavorful, not the overcooked
polyurethane some places toss
in to make you think you're
getting your money's worth.
After a long period of sus
tained joy, John carried away
the plates and brought coffee.
My espresso, garnished with a
bit of lemon rind, helped rescue
me from the clutches of the

vino, and the lady's coffee had
a similar effect.
Many people seem to view
dessert as a test of will, a
proving ground. Because I'm
not plagued by those kinds of
insecurities, 1 submitted to the
Profiterolles, more accessibly
known as cream puffs resting
in Grand Marnier, a pleasing
concoction. The lady did with
out. She was, as they say in
America, bloated.
And so the night appeared
to decrescendo after more than
three hours at the table. But
as we prepared to exit, a man
at an adjacent table began to
speak to John in an intriguing
mock-condescension: "Now I'm
i going to test your character. I
1 judge a person by what he can
accomplish.

"I want a table for four in
five minutes."
Bien Jait, dude!
He meant a table in the bar,
that infamous lair of pianist
Roger Cowger. I wish I knew
more about the local jazz front
so as to pay appropriate trib
ute to Roger's abilities, but
the lady's father, a native Nor
thern Californian of charm and
wit (should he be reading this),
holds Mr. Cowger in high es
teem.
He played stuff like
"Oklahoma!" and"The
Vatican Rag," and the audi
ence sang along. The place was

packed and, lo and behold, our
> friends from the dining room
were seated at one of the very
best tables within minutes.
Bien fait, John. Or perhaps
i more appropriately in your
case, way to go, dude.

Because as we stood and
steeped in all the merriment,
he came up to us and smiled.
He seemed to be losing his ac
cent.
John asked us if we wanted
to meet head chef and owner
Louis Borel. We followed him
back into the dining room,
which was by now almost
deserted with the notable ex
ception of three gentlemen
clustered around a corner
table, eating their own splen
did food and washing it all
down with . . . Coors beer.
Still dressed in white chefs
attire, Louis seemed particu

larly suave, his hair tussled in
that oh-so-French way. He
asked us to sit.and chat, and as
he leaned back and began to
talk about his chez, I thought
about how well it fit into the
rest of the evening.
Denouement:
Just how much is $15.89?
That Louis should display
such strength and charm is in
dicative of Chez Louis. As we
were driving home — after
more than a four-hour stay —
it occurred to me that Chez
Louis has just what so many
Palo Alto restaurants lack:
value.
You can and probably will
spend a lot of money at Chez
Louis, but it's money well
spent. You're spared that aw
ful "ripped off' feeling some
of us have come to expect
from Palo Alto, where even
that greasy Domino's pizza
upon which so many of us
depend runs $ 1 5.89.
To refrain, man ist was man
isst. And at Chez Louis, that
means you're a good person.

so as to pay appropriate trib
ute to Roger's abilities, but
the lady's father, a native Nor
thern Californian of charm and
wit (should he be reading this),
holds Mr. Cowger in high es
teem.
He played stuff like
"Oklahoma!" and"The
Vatican Rag," and the audi
ence sang along. The place was

packed and, lo and behold, our
> friends from the dining room
were seated at one of the very
best tables within minutes.
Bien fait, John. Or perhaps
i more appropriately in your
case, way to go, dude.

Because as we stood and
steeped in all the merriment,
he came up to us and smiled.
He seemed to be losing his ac
cent.
John asked us if we wanted
to meet head chef and owner
Louis Borel. We followed him
back into the dining room,
which was by now almost
deserted with the notable ex
ception of three gentlemen
clustered around a corner
table, eating their own splen
did food and washing it all
down with . . . Coors beer.
Still dressed in white chefs
attire, Louis seemed particu

larly suave, his hair tussled in
that oh-so-French way. He
asked us to sit.and chat, and as
he leaned back and began to
talk about his chez, I thought
about how well it fit into the
rest of the evening.
Denouement:
Just how much is $15.89?
That Louis should display
such strength and charm is in
dicative of Chez Louis. As we
were driving home — after
more than a four-hour stay —
it occurred to me that Chez
Louis has just what so many
Palo Alto restaurants lack:
value.
You can and probably will
spend a lot of money at Chez
Louis, but it's money well
spent. You're spared that aw
ful "ripped off' feeling some
of us have come to expect
from Palo Alto, where even
that greasy Domino's pizza
upon which so many of us
depend runs $ 1 5.89.
To refrain, man ist was man
isst. And at Chez Louis, that
means you're a good person.

Man ist was man isst.
I won't insult you by trans
lating what I know is a pretty
weary adage. But I start with
it for two reasons.
The first is to assure you
that I'm cosmopolitan enough
to review a restaurant with
European cuisine, even if I did
live in Oshkosh, Wisconsin
before moving to Wheat
Ridge, Colorado.
But more importantly I'd
like you to really believe man ist
was man isst — and then carry
it to its logical, local extreme.
Because if you really are what
you eat — I'm sorry, but if I
don't translate it the editor
in-chief will get really confused
when he's checking for typos —
and you live in Palo Alto, you
could be in a lot of trouble.
After all, it's widely ac
knowledged that Palo Alto has
more mediocre overpriced res
taurants than Skylonda or La
Honda, or even Tuba City,
Arizona.
Which means that if you are
what you eat, and you live in
Palo Alto, chances are that a
good share of the time you're
mediocre and overpriced, or
maybe even a bad person.
And even if you don't
believe that. — 1 won't-weaken
my argument by trying to
defend it — you've got to con
cede that if you live in Kent.
Ohio, a 16-inch six item
Domino's Pizza costs $4.95.
And if it's not delivered in 30
minutes or less, it's free.
I hate exclamation marks,
but $4.95!
A couple nights ago I ordered
the Stanford equivalent. A
mere $15.89, but don't worry.
If it's more than 30 minutes
old, it's still $ 15.59.
In other words, that 2 a.m.
sick-to-your-stomach feeling
could be 321 percent harder to
achieve here than in Kent.
And here's the real travesty:
You could spend that same
$15.N9 at dozens of Midpenin
sula restaurants and have a less
pleasant time than you would
watching some bleary-eyed
Domino's person scrambling to
find your terminal at LOTS.
But what's important is that
Palo Alto isn't always this way.
It may ruin my argument, but I
know where you can channel
that $15.N9 toward some really

good food and tasteful sur
roundings — food and sur
roundings Kent and most other
places just can't match.
No valet parking
But my editor just glared at
me, so I'd better retreat to the
standard chronological review
ing techique.
The lady and I didn't know
what to expect at Chez Louis.
But the evening started off
right: The place is easy to find,
only ten minutes south on El
Camino Real, and no valet
parking (just how much are you
supposed to tip those valet
guys and how do you know they
won't do doughnuts in the
parking lot while you're inside
eating?). My VW stopped dis
creetly between a couple of
Mercedes and we hopped out,
all dressed up and, at least in
my case, a bit self-conscious.
The maitre d' sort of helped
me relax: He was polite enough,
and didn't make me feel like a
plouque the way some maitre
d's do. He led us to a little
table in an exceedingly pleasant
dining room: high, vaulted wood
ceiling, stone fireplace, paned
picture windows. The copper
pots and kettles hanging from
the walls glowed warmly in the
soft light of the delicate hur
ricane lamps on each table.
Notice I say soft light. This
shouldn't be confused with
sleazy light, a la Ecco in the
Hyatt Palo Alto (you know,
the restaurant where the
waiters wear green velour
tuxedos).
Chez Louis is one of those
places where you can decide
whether to watch the other
diners without feeling that
you're on exhibit. And that's
only fair, even if it isn't logical.
Wining and worrying
After asking for the wine
list, I started worrying. I've
learned about wine trial-and
error, mostly error. John, our
charming "French" waiter
(from Paris, Texas is my guess)
brought back a 13-page bound
volume with vino ranging from
$6 to $ 1 500 per bottle.
That was a bit of a relief. It

meant basically ordering by
price, not by vintage. We opted
for the Rothschild Mouton
Cadet, 1980 ($l6).
It wasn't very good, but
don't blame Chez Louis. As the
lady said, "$l6 seems pretty
cheap for Rothschild. I bet they
hosed out the vats after they
made the good wine and
bottled the rinsed out part in
stead of throwing it out."
Methinks the lady doth
protest too much: As I
predicted, it started to taste
pretty good after three or four
glasses.
S-Car-Go
I can't talk about the hors d'
oeuvres without tracing my
personal experience with escar
gots. I'd had them — well actu
ally, I'd had one of them — at
age 11.
"Here, have one of these,"
my father had told me.
"They're really good. It's kind
of like steak."
1 bit in. It was nothing like
steak, especially after Dad told
me it was a snail.
But I didn't spit it out, even
{hough it tasted like dirty
bubble gum. There's nothing
like instilling trust in your
children.
But Chez Louis changed all
that. The Escargots de Bour
gogne aux Croutons ($4.50)
tasted so good I wanted to call
up my folks and cry.
The lady chose Coquille St.
Jacques ($4.95). With my usual
grace, I leaned over the table
and tried to poke my fork into
the little scallops, but one of
them fell off en route to my
plate and splattered on the
table. I was embarrassed when
John came to pick up the
plates, but in retrospect 1
suppose he was too busy being
French to piece together what
had happened.
Chez Louis bread is crusty
and mild. I'm not one to bitch
about whether the butter is
hard or soft, so just don't ask.
Forgive me, Residential Edu
cation, but the wine was
working wonders for my dis
position by the time John

popped in with the soupe du
jour, included in the meal. On
Saturday it happened to be
cream of vegetable, a very good
cream of vegetable.
Interjection: You'd better be
with good company when you
visit Chez Louis, and don't be
in a hurry. The service is at
tentive but very definitely
leisurely, proportioned to the
warmth of wine and my very
attractive accomplice.
A test of will
The main course arrived just
when desired. For the lady, the
Specialite du jour, Red Snapper
with Salmon Mousse and
Cream and Shallot Sauce
($16.75), covered with zucchini
carefully sliced and arrayed to
resemble fish scales. I delved
into Veau aux Champignons

Sauvages, replete with im
ported forest-mushroom sauce
($15.75).
Both exquisite — the sauces
were light but a bit strong,
nonetheless excellent. The ac
companying carrots, beans and
potatoes were particularly
flavorful, not the overcooked
polyurethane some places toss
in to make you think you're
getting your money's worth.
After a long period of sus
tained joy, John carried away
the plates and brought coffee.
My espresso, garnished with a
bit of lemon rind, helped rescue
me from the clutches of the

vino, and the lady's coffee had
a similar effect.
Many people seem to view
dessert as a test of will, a
proving ground. Because I'm
not plagued by those kinds of
insecurities, 1 submitted to the
Profiterolles, more accessibly
known as cream puffs resting
in Grand Marnier, a pleasing
concoction. The lady did with
out. She was, as they say in
America, bloated.
And so the night appeared
to decrescendo after more than
three hours at the table. But
as we prepared to exit, a man
at an adjacent table began to
speak to John in an intriguing
mock-condescension: "Now I'm
i going to test your character. I
1 judge a person by what he can
accomplish.

"I want a table for four in
five minutes."
Bien Jait, dude!
He meant a table in the bar,
that infamous lair of pianist
Roger Cowger. I wish I knew
more about the local jazz front
so as to pay appropriate trib
ute to Roger's abilities, but

cream of vegetable.
Interjection: You'd better be
with good company when you
visit Chez Louis, and don't be
in a hurry. The service is at
tentive but very definitely
leisurely, proportioned to the
warmth of wine and my very
attractive accomplice.
A test of will
The main course arrived just
when desired. For the lady, the
Specialite du jour, Red Snapper
with Salmon Mousse and
Cream and Shallot Sauce
($16.75), covered with zucchini
carefully sliced and arrayed to
resemble fish scales. I delved
into Veau aux Champignons

Sauvages, replete with im
ported forest-mushroom sauce
($15.75).
Both exquisite — the sauces
were light but a bit strong,
nonetheless excellent. The ac
companying carrots, beans and
potatoes were particularly
flavorful, not the overcooked
polyurethane some places toss
in to make you think you're
getting your money's worth.
After a long period of sus
tained joy, John carried away
the plates and brought coffee.
My espresso, garnished with a
bit of lemon rind, helped rescue
me from the clutches of the

vino, and the lady's coffee had
a similar effect.
Many people seem to view
dessert as a test of will, a
proving ground. Because I'm
not plagued by those kinds of
insecurities, 1 submitted to the
Profiterolles, more accessibly
known as cream puffs resting
in Grand Marnier, a pleasing
concoction. The lady did with
out. She was, as they say in
America, bloated.
And so the night appeared
to decrescendo after more than
three hours at the table. But
as we prepared to exit, a man
at an adjacent table began to
speak to John in an intriguing
mock-condescension: "Now I'm
i going to test your character. I
1 judge a person by what he can
accomplish.

"I want a table for four in
five minutes."
Bien Jait, dude!
He meant a table in the bar,
that infamous lair of pianist
Roger Cowger. I wish I knew
more about the local jazz front
so as to pay appropriate trib
ute to Roger's abilities, but
the lady's father, a native Nor
thern Californian of charm and
wit (should he be reading this),
holds Mr. Cowger in high es
teem.
He played stuff like
"Oklahoma!" and"The
Vatican Rag," and the audi
ence sang along. The place was

packed and, lo and behold, our
> friends from the dining room
were seated at one of the very
best tables within minutes.
Bien fait, John. Or perhaps
i more appropriately in your
case, way to go, dude.

Because as we stood and
steeped in all the merriment,
he came up to us and smiled.
He seemed to be losing his ac
cent.
John asked us if we wanted
to meet head chef and owner
Louis Borel. We followed him
back into the dining room,
which was by now almost
deserted with the notable ex
ception of three gentlemen
clustered around a corner
table, eating their own splen
did food and washing it all
down with . . . Coors beer.
Still dressed in white chefs
attire, Louis seemed particu

larly suave, his hair tussled in
that oh-so-French way. He
asked us to sit.and chat, and as
he leaned back and began to
talk about his chez, I thought
about how well it fit into the
rest of the evening.
Denouement:
Just how much is $15.89?
That Louis should display
such strength and charm is in
dicative of Chez Louis. As we
were driving home — after
more than a four-hour stay —
it occurred to me that Chez
Louis has just what so many
Palo Alto restaurants lack:
value.
You can and probably will
spend a lot of money at Chez
Louis, but it's money well
spent. You're spared that aw
ful "ripped off' feeling some
of us have come to expect
from Palo Alto, where even
that greasy Domino's pizza
upon which so many of us
depend runs $ 1 5.89.
To refrain, man ist was man
isst. And at Chez Louis, that
means you're a good person.

Man ist was man isst.
I won't insult you by trans
lating what I know is a pretty
weary adage. But I start with
it for two reasons.
The first is to assure you
that I'm cosmopolitan enough
to review a restaurant with
European cuisine, even if I did
live in Oshkosh, Wisconsin
before moving to Wheat
Ridge, Colorado.
But more importantly I'd
like you to really believe man ist
was man isst — and then carry
it to its logical, local extreme.
Because if you really are what
you eat — I'm sorry, but if I
don't translate it the editor
in-chief will get really confused
when he's checking for typos —
and you live in Palo Alto, you
could be in a lot of trouble.
After all, it's widely ac
knowledged that Palo Alto has
more mediocre overpriced res
taurants than Skylonda or La
Honda, or even Tuba City,
Arizona.
Which means that if you are
what you eat, and you live in
Palo Alto, chances are that a
good share of the time you're
mediocre and overpriced, or
maybe even a bad person.
And even if you don't
believe that. — 1 won't-weaken
my argument by trying to
defend it — you've got to con
cede that if you live in Kent.
Ohio, a 16-inch six item
Domino's Pizza costs $4.95.
And if it's not delivered in 30
minutes or less, it's free.
I hate exclamation marks,
but $4.95!
A couple nights ago I ordered
the Stanford equivalent. A
mere $15.89, but don't worry.
If it's more than 30 minutes
old, it's still $ 15.59.
In other words, that 2 a.m.
sick-to-your-stomach feeling
could be 321 percent harder to
achieve here than in Kent.
And here's the real travesty:
You could spend that same
$15.N9 at dozens of Midpenin
sula restaurants and have a less
pleasant time than you would
watching some bleary-eyed
Domino's person scrambling to
find your terminal at LOTS.
But what's important is that
Palo Alto isn't always this way.
It may ruin my argument, but I
know where you can channel
that $15.N9 toward some really

good food and tasteful sur
roundings — food and sur
roundings Kent and most other
places just can't match.
No valet parking
But my editor just glared at
me, so I'd better retreat to the
standard chronological review
ing techique.
The lady and I didn't know
what to expect at Chez Louis.
But the evening started off
right: The place is easy to find,
only ten minutes south on El
Camino Real, and no valet
parking (just how much are you
supposed to tip those valet
guys and how do you know they
won't do doughnuts in the
parking lot while you're inside
eating?). My VW stopped dis
creetly between a couple of
Mercedes and we hopped out,
all dressed up and, at least in
my case, a bit self-conscious.
The maitre d' sort of helped
me relax: He was polite enough,
and didn't make me feel like a
plouque the way some maitre
d's do. He led us to a little
table in an exceedingly pleasant
dining room: high, vaulted wood
ceiling, stone fireplace, paned
picture windows. The copper
pots and kettles hanging from
the walls glowed warmly in the
soft light of the delicate hur
ricane lamps on each table.
Notice I say soft light. This
shouldn't be confused with
sleazy light, a la Ecco in the
Hyatt Palo Alto (you know,
the restaurant where the
waiters wear green velour
tuxedos).
Chez Louis is one of those
places where you can decide
whether to watch the other
diners without feeling that
you're on exhibit. And that's
only fair, even if it isn't logical.
Wining and worrying
After asking for the wine
list, I started worrying. I've
learned about wine trial-and
error, mostly error. John, our
charming "French" waiter
(from Paris, Texas is my guess)
brought back a 13-page bound
volume with vino ranging from
$6 to $ 1 500 per bottle.
That was a bit of a relief. It

meant basically ordering by
price, not by vintage. We opted
for the Rothschild Mouton
Cadet, 1980 ($l6).
It wasn't very good, but
don't blame Chez Louis. As the
lady said, "$l6 seems pretty
cheap for Rothschild. I bet they
hosed out the vats after they
made the good wine and
bottled the rinsed out part in
stead of throwing it out."
Methinks the lady doth
protest too much: As I
predicted, it started to taste
pretty good after three or four
glasses.
S-Car-Go
I can't talk about the hors d'
oeuvres without tracing my
personal experience with escar
gots. I'd had them — well actu
ally, I'd had one of them — at
age 11.
"Here, have one of these,"
my father had told me.
"They're really good. It's kind
of like steak."
1 bit in. It was nothing like
steak, especially after Dad told
me it was a snail.
But I didn't spit it out, even
{hough it tasted like dirty
bubble gum. There's nothing
like instilling trust in your
children.
But Chez Louis changed all
that. The Escargots de Bour
gogne aux Croutons ($4.50)
tasted so good I wanted to call
up my folks and cry.
The lady chose Coquille St.
Jacques ($4.95). With my usual
grace, I leaned over the table
and tried to poke my fork into
the little scallops, but one of
them fell off en route to my
plate and splattered on the
table. I was embarrassed when
John came to pick up the
plates, but in retrospect 1
suppose he was too busy being
French to piece together what
had happened.
Chez Louis bread is crusty
and mild. I'm not one to bitch
about whether the butter is
hard or soft, so just don't ask.
Forgive me, Residential Edu
cation, but the wine was
working wonders for my dis
position by the time John

popped in with the soupe du
jour, included in the meal. On
Saturday it happened to be
cream of vegetable, a very good
cream of vegetable.

with good company when you
visit Chez Louis, and don't be
in a hurry. The service is at
