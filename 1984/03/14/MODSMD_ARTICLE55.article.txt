# Spending your dead week dollar
## 
### JULIE RYAN 
Grab the phone. It's 11 p.m. and you're on the second
page ol your 15-page paper due tomorrow. You need sup
plemetary sustenance to get you through the miserable
night that awaits you. Perhaps only a pizza can do the trick.
Therefore, we tested, we compared, we analyzed the
choices most accessible to you during dead week: Domino's,
Ramona's. and Corner Pocket, and we're ready to give the
results.
At 10:45 the orders were made. Pepperoni and mushroom
piz/as were the choice. Ramona's and Domino's deliver, but
at I 1:05 1 had to set off by bicycle to pick up the Corner
Pocket pizza at Tresidder. It was ready on arrival, but by
the time 1 pedalled back to The Daily, the Domino's pizza
had arrived.

Ramona's showed its weakness in the delivery aspect, ar
riving 12 minutes later than the others. I got a phone call
asking me to wait outside in case the deliverer could not
find the office. As one of our panel members said, "I think
if Ramona's delivered to your door their business would
double. Why should you have to reach into the guy's car to
get your pizza when they say they deliver?"
The first test was a cost vs. size analysis. The large
Domino's pizza was 16 inches in diameter and the most
costly of the three pizzas at $10.06. I was surprised that it
cost the most because it weighs considerably less than the
other pizzas and weighed a few ounces less due to the por
tion of pizza which was stuck to the top of the cardboard
box. .. . The Ramona's was a medium which is 14 inches in

diameter and cost $10.00. Though smaller in diameter it ac
tually was larger in volume than Domino's. Surprisingly, the
Corner Pocket Pizza at 16 inches weighed in the heaviest
and was the least expensive at $M,75.
In the crust category. Ramona's and Corner Pocket were
the winners. Several of the reviewers commented that,
"the Domino's pizza crust resembles the box it comes in."
"The Corner Pocket crust is more flaky." explained one ex
pert. Though most tasters liked the Ramona's crust, two
were a bit critical. "It's too flaky on the bottom and it's
gooey on the inside." said one reviewer, proving that pizza
crust preference is very personal.
Ramona's virtually swept the cheese division, receiving
compliments on taste and quantity. Corner Pocket has

plenty of cheese, but as one of the judge's said, "They put
so much cheese on it, you can't speak after you eat it."
For overall tast each pizza had its advocates. Corner
Pocket had several admirers who especially praised its sauce.
One loyal Domino's cater explained, "Domino's is sweeter,
which I like." And Ramona's won the largest following with
comments like, "a good blend of flavors."
But for the late-night studiers, it's hard to beat Domino's
hours. Domino's takes orders until 1 a.m. on weekdays and 2
a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. The other two pizzas might
have won the culinary test but unless you call them by 11:15
you may not get a pizza.
