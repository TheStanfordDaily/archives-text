### JULIE RYAN 
You're tired of carrying
around old issues ol The Dail>
on dates when deciding what
restaurant to try. You'd like a
hook th«it you could slip less
conspicuously into your pocket.
A former Stanford student has
a solution for you.
Douglas Smith has written
the Scotch Gourmet, a guide
to frugal eating in the Midpen
ninsula area that focuses tin
restaurants where someone can
get more than water and rice
for $5.
The reviews are informative
and well written.' though I
would have liked to see a more
critical evaluation of some of
the restaurants listed. The des
criptions of the atmosphere,
prices and music are helpful hut
some of the reviews lack any
opinion by the author on the
quality of the food.
Smith explained that this is
because the book is designed to
tell people where to go. not
where to avoid. In this context
I think the guide serves its pur
pose especially well in the sec
tion describing Mexican food
and the section describing
Chinese food. Other areas,
such as the French section with
only two restaurants listed,
seem a hit incomplete. Admit
tedly, "frugal epicures," as
Smith refers to himself, may
have to steer clear of French
restaurants.
Smith earned a Ph.D. in
musicology at Stanford and has
written concert reviews for
The Peninsula Times Tribune
for ten years. He said. "We live
in one of the best areas in the
country for really good low
priced eating."
Several current Stanford
students were also involved in
the book. Hae-Yuon Kim, a
junior, did the pen and ink
drawings which capture the

mood of some of the restau
rants. Senior Elgie Gerald
edited the guide.
Here are some excerpts from
several reviews so that you can
decide if you and Smith might
see eye to eye on good eating:
Yuen Yung, Menlo Park
The quality is good to high.
A friend and I started out one
evening with the assorted hot
appetizers ($6.75 for a very
sizeable "small" plate). We
quickly laid waste to the spring
rolls. deep-fried prawns,
parchment-wrapped ehicken.
wonton. and rumaki (pork and
a puree of water chestnut,
deep-fried in batter).
I .a Pohlanita. Mountain View
The chicken enchilada melts
in your mouth, the chile relleno
is the best I've found so far
(unusually good cheese), the
taco is real shredded beef and
its tortilla shell is not so crisp
that it falls apart immediately.
What else can I say? This is as
good as Mexican food gets
hereabouts.
The only sour note is service.

I was last here tor lunch, which
I didn't receive until I had been
here a halt hour. This indicates
that the kitchen is conscien
tious enough to prepare each
order individually, hut also
that the front line personnel
slitter from a certain amount
of inefficiency in coping with
even a moderate-si/ed lunch
crowd. Patrons have to seat
themselves, and I had to go
looking for a waitress to get a
menu. So make sure you're seen
entering.
Stanford Coffee House, Stan
ford
The Coffee House's am
bience is classical collegiate
bohemian: massive wooden
plank tables, low light, exhibi
tions of art posters and
photographs, and two-tiered
seating. Out back is an oak
shaded patio with picnic tables.
The sound system may play
Haydn and Beethoven sym
phonies, or folk, jaz/ or the
Beatles.
