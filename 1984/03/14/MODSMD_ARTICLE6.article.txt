Senate backers not hopeful
for prayer amendment passage
Washington — A key Senate leader said yesterday that
•"the odds are strongly against" Senate passage of a con
stitutional amendment, vigorously backed by President
Reagan, that would permit organized spoken prayer in
public schools.
In making the statement. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) the
amendment's floor leader, said that there also might not be
enough votes for a backup proposal permitting periods of
silent prayer or meditation in the classroom.
In debate that began nine days ago. Hatch has defended
the spoken-prayer proposal but has made clear his prefer
ence for a silent-prayer amendment. Both measures seek to
nullify Supreme Court decisions in 1962 and 1963 that
banned state-sponsored prayers and religious readings in
public schools.
The proponents of vocal prayer suffered a major setback
yesterday when two previously undecided senators. Warren
Rudman (R-N.H.) and Dennis DeConcini, (D-Ariz.) an
nounced that they would support a silent-prayer measure.
Voting on the emotion-charged issue is expected later
this week. Passage of a constitutional amendment requires
a two-thirds majority: 67 votes if all 100 senators are pres
ent.
In a driving rain yesterday, nearly 100 Protestant and
Jewish clergymen held a rally on the Capitol steps to
protest all prayer legislation. Arguing that children individ
ually may already pray in school, the group issued a state
ment saying: "Prayer is for the parents and the church and
synagogue to teach, and not the government. We don't
want some board of education committee watering down
our faith as it toils to write a prayer which offends no one."
Senate committee approves
aid to Nicaraguan rebels
Washington — In a partial victory for the Reagan adminis
tration. the Senate Intelligence Committee voted yester
day to authorize $21 million in new aid to rebels battling
Nicaragua's leftist government but said that only $7 million
of the money could be used immediately.
I he funding plan is scheduled to be considered today by
the Senate Appropriations Committee, along with an ad
ministration request for up to $93 million in immediate
new military aid tor El Salvador. Aides to members of the
committee said they expected both measures to pass, al
though some senators plan to propose linking the Sal
vadoran aid to progress on human rights there.
President Reagan has urged Congress to approve the
emergency aid to El Salvador because without it, he said
Monday, "their army ... will soon be out of ammunition,
supplies and funds." He said an aid cutoff would mean that
the Salvadorans could not hold their presidential election,
scheduled for March 25, under secure conditions.
The Intelligence Committee approved the new covert
funding by a vote of 14-0, with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.),
an opponent of the secret aid program, voting "present,"
aides to committee members said.
Reagan praises Jordan
Washington — President Reagan, in his first election-year
speech to a Jewish audience, praised Jordan yesterday as a
. mailt!rate? "crucial to the pencc process" in the
Middle East and'urged support for administration plans to
sell some defensive weapons to that nation.
"Since the security of Jordan is crucial to the security of
the entire region, it is in America's strategic interest — and
I believe it is in Israel's stategic interest — for us to help
meet Jordan's legitimate needs for defense against the
growing power of Syria and Iran." Reagan said to scattered
hisses. His audience was about 3000 members of the Young
Leadership Conference of the United Jewish Appeal.
The administration notified Congress two weeks ago of
its intention to sell Jordan 1613 Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles over the next four years and a parallel plan to sell
1200 Stingers to Saudi Arabia.
Reagan's speech did not dwell on details of the proposed
weapons sales and did not even mention the anti-aircraft
sale to Saudi Arabia. For the most part, he presented a gen
eral review of administration policies: stressing U.S. close
ness to Israel, repeating U.S. refusal to deal with the
Palestine Liberation Organization unless that group first
recognizes Israel — and for the most part ignoring the
recent setback both Israel and the United States have suf
fered in Lebanon.
Senate summons Meese
Washington — Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) decided yesterday to recall Ed
win Meese 111 for further testimony to clear up "unresolved
issues and questions" about Meese's nomination to become
attorney general.
Thurmond made the decision after committee
Democrats complained that Meese had been "evasive" in
written responses to questions about his knowledge of in
formation gleaned by Ronald Reagan's campaign team from
inside the camp of Jimmy Carter during the 1980 presiden
tial campaign. Meese was chief of staff for Reagan's cam
paign.
Pressure built on Thurmond to recall Meese when Senate
Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.), emerging from
a Democratic caucus meeting, said Meese's nomination
"could be" in trouble. If Meese "has nothing to hide, he has
nothing to lose" by returning for more questioning, Byrd
said.
Polish state and church clash
over cross display in schools
Warsaw — Poland's communist authorities and its
Roman Catholic bishops appeared yesterday to be headed
for their most serious confrontation in years as a top gov
ernment official said all crucifixes still hanging in state-run
schools "will be removed."
Meanwhile, Cardinal Jozef Glemp. the Polish primate,
and his senior bishops, who met on the issue here yesterday
morning, expressed support for students whose protest
over the removal of classroom crosses from an agricultural
trade school near the town of Garwolin ignited the crisis.
In a message read out to about 5000 mostly young wor
shippers at a special mass in Garwolin late yesterday after
noon, the nine-member executive council of the Polish
episcopate said "crosses should return where the presence
of crosses is demanded by the believing society," and
pledged: "The church does not retreat."
Stocks advance moderately
New York — The stock market settled into a broad but
moderate advance yesterday after President Reagan's com
ments that he had "lost a little faith" in the budget deficit
talks halted a mid-afternoon spurt, analysts said.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.42 to
1164.78. It had jumped just over 16 points in the mid
afternoon. surpassing Monday's climbed of 15.60 to
1155.36.

Senate backers not hopeful
for prayer amendment passage
Washington — A key Senate leader said yesterday that
•"the odds are strongly against" Senate passage of a con
stitutional amendment, vigorously backed by President
Reagan, that would permit organized spoken prayer in
public schools.
In making the statement. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) the
amendment's floor leader, said that there also might not be
enough votes for a backup proposal permitting periods of
silent prayer or meditation in the classroom.
In debate that began nine days ago. Hatch has defended
the spoken-prayer proposal but has made clear his prefer
ence for a silent-prayer amendment. Both measures seek to
nullify Supreme Court decisions in 1962 and 1963 that
banned state-sponsored prayers and religious readings in
public schools.
The proponents of vocal prayer suffered a major setback
yesterday when two previously undecided senators. Warren
Rudman (R-N.H.) and Dennis DeConcini, (D-Ariz.) an
nounced that they would support a silent-prayer measure.
Voting on the emotion-charged issue is expected later
this week. Passage of a constitutional amendment requires
a two-thirds majority: 67 votes if all 100 senators are pres
ent.
In a driving rain yesterday, nearly 100 Protestant and
Jewish clergymen held a rally on the Capitol steps to
protest all prayer legislation. Arguing that children individ
ually may already pray in school, the group issued a state
ment saying: "Prayer is for the parents and the church and
synagogue to teach, and not the government. We don't
want some board of education committee watering down
our faith as it toils to write a prayer which offends no one."
Senate committee approves
aid to Nicaraguan rebels
Washington — In a partial victory for the Reagan adminis
tration. the Senate Intelligence Committee voted yester
day to authorize $21 million in new aid to rebels battling
Nicaragua's leftist government but said that only $7 million
of the money could be used immediately.
I he funding plan is scheduled to be considered today by
the Senate Appropriations Committee, along with an ad
ministration request for up to $93 million in immediate
new military aid tor El Salvador. Aides to members of the
committee said they expected both measures to pass, al
though some senators plan to propose linking the Sal
vadoran aid to progress on human rights there.
President Reagan has urged Congress to approve the
emergency aid to El Salvador because without it, he said
Monday, "their army ... will soon be out of ammunition,
supplies and funds." He said an aid cutoff would mean that
the Salvadorans could not hold their presidential election,
scheduled for March 25, under secure conditions.
The Intelligence Committee approved the new covert
funding by a vote of 14-0, with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.),
an opponent of the secret aid program, voting "present,"
aides to committee members said.
Reagan praises Jordan
Washington — President Reagan, in his first election-year
speech to a Jewish audience, praised Jordan yesterday as a
. mailt!rate? "crucial to the pencc process" in the
Middle East and'urged support for administration plans to
sell some defensive weapons to that nation.
"Since the security of Jordan is crucial to the security of
the entire region, it is in America's strategic interest — and
I believe it is in Israel's stategic interest — for us to help
meet Jordan's legitimate needs for defense against the
growing power of Syria and Iran." Reagan said to scattered
hisses. His audience was about 3000 members of the Young
Leadership Conference of the United Jewish Appeal.
The administration notified Congress two weeks ago of
its intention to sell Jordan 1613 Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles over the next four years and a parallel plan to sell
1200 Stingers to Saudi Arabia.
Reagan's speech did not dwell on details of the proposed
weapons sales and did not even mention the anti-aircraft
sale to Saudi Arabia. For the most part, he presented a gen
eral review of administration policies: stressing U.S. close
ness to Israel, repeating U.S. refusal to deal with the
Palestine Liberation Organization unless that group first
recognizes Israel — and for the most part ignoring the
recent setback both Israel and the United States have suf
fered in Lebanon.
Senate summons Meese
Washington — Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) decided yesterday to recall Ed
win Meese 111 for further testimony to clear up "unresolved
issues and questions" about Meese's nomination to become
attorney general.
Thurmond made the decision after committee
Democrats complained that Meese had been "evasive" in
written responses to questions about his knowledge of in
formation gleaned by Ronald Reagan's campaign team from
inside the camp of Jimmy Carter during the 1980 presiden
tial campaign. Meese was chief of staff for Reagan's cam
paign.
Pressure built on Thurmond to recall Meese when Senate
Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.), emerging from
a Democratic caucus meeting, said Meese's nomination
"could be" in trouble. If Meese "has nothing to hide, he has
nothing to lose" by returning for more questioning, Byrd
said.
Polish state and church clash
over cross display in schools
Warsaw — Poland's communist authorities and its
Roman Catholic bishops appeared yesterday to be headed
for their most serious confrontation in years as a top gov
ernment official said all crucifixes still hanging in state-run
schools "will be removed."
Meanwhile, Cardinal Jozef Glemp. the Polish primate,
and his senior bishops, who met on the issue here yesterday
morning, expressed support for students whose protest
over the removal of classroom crosses from an agricultural
trade school near the town of Garwolin ignited the crisis.
In a message read out to about 5000 mostly young wor
shippers at a special mass in Garwolin late yesterday after
noon, the nine-member executive council of the Polish
episcopate said "crosses should return where the presence
of crosses is demanded by the believing society," and
pledged: "The church does not retreat."
Stocks advance moderately
New York — The stock market settled into a broad but
moderate advance yesterday after President Reagan's com

1164.78. It had jumped just over 16 points in the mid
