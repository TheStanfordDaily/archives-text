Group breeds protest
Students for Bestiality are in the dog
house at the University of Oregon.
According to a story in the Oregon Daily
Emerald, the Student Administrative
Board has revoked permission for Students
for Bestiality to be a registered student
group on the basis that the group "willingly
misrepresented" its statement of purpose.
The board made the decision shortly
after a display comparing homosexuality to
bestiality had been removed from the first
floor of Oregon's student union.
Members of Students for Bestiality
defended their display, saying their group
hoped to "educate students on the issue of
bestiality, the societal basis of values and
various forms of animal husbandry."
Students for Bestiality was first given
registered-student-group status when it
filed an application signed by an Oregon
junior who has since disavowed any affilia
tion with the group.
Only two students now admit to belong
it.j. to Students for Bestiality, and they say
they've been muzzled unfairly.
The idea for the group, they say, came
from a "right-wing, Republican handbook"
that showed many ways to bring issues into
the public eye.
The Student Administrative Board
didn't go for that, though, and, with the
support of Oregon's Gay and Lesbian Al
liance, revoked the group's registration.
But Students for Bestiality will keep up
the fight, arguing that they didn't receive
a fair hearing from members of the Stu
dent Administrative Board.
"They were just trying to figure out the
best way to get rid of us," one Students
for Bestiality member said. "This was a
kangaroo court."
Music — for a price
Somehow this isn't too surprising.
According to a Daily Trojan story, when
it comcs to outside gig* for the USC
/ Marching Trojan band, money and prestige
are the big keys.
While political and religious organiza
tions are no-nos for the Spirit of Troy, if
you've got enough money the band is
waiting to play for you, according to USC

Marching Trojan Director Art Bartner.
The band has performed at such intellec
tually stimulating productions as Ihe
Mitzi Gaynor Show," "Grease II," "Annie
and"The Gong Show Movie."
The Trojans hauled in about $20,000 tor
their performance on Fleetwood Mac's
"Tusk" album and video a few years back.
If you want the Spirit of Troy to show
up at your next party, you've got a couple

of options from which to choose. You can
hire the 35-piece pep band for a fraternity
barbecue, or, on a smaller scale, the 10-
picce ' Birthday Bund" will piny "Happy
Birthday," "Conquest" or the USC fight
song at your next birthday party.
All this is available to you — for a price.
"When you want the best," the director
of the Spirit of Troy says, "you come to
USC."

Brother is a butcher
A Delta Upsilon brother at the I diver
sity nl Pennsylvania has been suspended
from his fraternity for " needlessly
slaughtering two animals.' l'he Daily Pen
nsylvanian reported.
Larry I iniek. a junior majoring in engi
neering. allegedly killed a rat and
decapitated a chicken with an axe at a
"theme party" at the Dl house.
"At first, everything was within
bounds." DL' president Dave forman told
The Daily Pennsylvanian. "But as the party
started, everyone became aware that what
l.arry was doing was pretty sick.
What L.inick did was carry out to an only
somewhat logical extreme the idea behind
the Dl) party.
Forman said that each of the brothers at
the party "took a room and made it a
scenario."
One brother decorated his room as a
chocolate factory and another as a leather
store. Linick chose a butcher shop for his
room.
"Larry bought beef blood, animal
entrails and cow skulls at the Italian Mar
ket," Forman said. "He also bought a
couple of chickens and other animals. It
seemed as if he was going a little nuts."
After meeting with members of the na
tional Delta Upsilon organization and
alumni of the Pennsylvania chapter, For
man and the rest of the local chapter
decided to suspend — but not expel —
I.inick because the expulsion process was
too time-consuming.
However. Linick, who was unavailable for
comment, told Forman he thought the
punishment was unfair.
"L.arry thought what he did was
reasonable," Forman said. "He said he was
just making a statement and trying to
shock people."
Forman said several brothers had unsuc
cessfully tried to stop Linick from killing
the animals.
"I told him not to kill animals in front of
people, and he said he wouldn't," Forman
said. "Nobody thought he was capable of
killing those animals. The brothers could
not believe what had happened.
"They took a rabbit and another chicken
out of his room, and an alumni (sic) took
his axe away," Forman said.
Another fraternity member confirmed
that guests at the party were somewhat
shocked by I.inick's behavior.
"Most of the people were grossed out,
but not freaked out," he said.
Voodoo lily stench
Some of you may buy flowers to make
your rooms smell better. At Indiana Uni
versity, that might not be such a good idea.
It seems there's an odd sort of flower in
the Jordan Hall Greenhouse at IU. It's a
big flower — 43 inches tall. And it has a big
smell — a big. bad smell.
"To me it's like some kind of dead
animal," Greenhouse Supervisor John
Lemon told the Indiana Daily Student.
The plant is a three and one-half foot,

reddish-purple hydrosme rivieri — also
called a \oodoo lily — natixe to tropical
Africa and Asia.
The xoodoo lily is now blooming — and
smelling — for the first time 111 four years.
Lemon says a lot of faculty members
drop by to check on the plant — but only
for a fexx minutes.
"Plant people are excited about u be
cause it is so unusual compared to other
plants." lie explains. "It's kind of a thrill to
see something like that flowering because
it is much bigger and has such a bad odor."
Why does the plant smell so bad? So flies
will think it's dead and pollini/c it when
they land on it. Lemon explained.
Can't explain
This short story ran in The San Jose Mer
cury News recently. It cries for some
elaboration, but being Dead Week, this is
all you're going to get.
"FRESNO (AP) — The Army ROTC de
partment at Fresno State Udiversity can
celed a mock helicopter raid at a campus
baseball diamond when students
threatened a protest."
That's it. There's no more. You figure it
out.
A Van Halen crusade
Hope springs eternal in the hearts and
minds of thud-rock loyalists.
It seems that students at Washington
State are more than a little upset that Van
Halen has canceled a planned concert in
Pullman in favor of a second show in
Seattle.
Disc jockeys at KUGR. Washington
State's campus radio station, have begun a
crusade to get Van Halen to perform at
the campus' coliseum in May.
"At KUGR. our jocks are nartaking in a

great undertaking." kUGR's Promotions
Director Ginny Matson told the Daily Ev
ergreen. "We are trying to get 15.000
names on a petition designed to sway the
minds of Van Halen to get them to
perform here.
'• Thev'll see it would he worth their while
to come here." Matson said.
KUGR i> also accepting personal imita
tions for the hand to play in Pullman and
will mail those imitations along with the
petition.
"We don't know whether it will do any
good." Mason said, "hut we're hoping."

"Frat House." the competing series will of

lovemaking.
"They are just as explicit" as the Stu

Voodoo lily stench
Some of you may buy flowers to make
your rooms smell better. At Indiana Uni
versity, that might not be such a good idea.
It seems there's an odd sort of flower in
the Jordan Hall Greenhouse at IU. It's a
big flower — 43 inches tall. And it has a big
smell — a big. bad smell.
"To me it's like some kind of dead
animal," Greenhouse Supervisor John
Lemon told the Indiana Daily Student.
The plant is a three and one-half foot,

reddish-purple hydrosme rivieri — also
called a \oodoo lily — natixe to tropical
Africa and Asia.
The xoodoo lily is now blooming — and
smelling — for the first time 111 four years.
Lemon says a lot of faculty members
drop by to check on the plant — but only
for a fexx minutes.
"Plant people are excited about u be
cause it is so unusual compared to other
plants." lie explains. "It's kind of a thrill to
see something like that flowering because
it is much bigger and has such a bad odor."
Why does the plant smell so bad? So flies
will think it's dead and pollini/c it when
they land on it. Lemon explained.

Group breeds protest
Students for Bestiality are in the dog
house at the University of Oregon.
According to a story in the Oregon Daily
Emerald, the Student Administrative
Board has revoked permission for Students
for Bestiality to be a registered student
group on the basis that the group "willingly
misrepresented" its statement of purpose.
The board made the decision shortly
after a display comparing homosexuality to
bestiality had been removed from the first
floor of Oregon's student union.
Members of Students for Bestiality
defended their display, saying their group
hoped to "educate students on the issue of
bestiality, the societal basis of values and
various forms of animal husbandry."
Students for Bestiality was first given
registered-student-group status when it
filed an application signed by an Oregon
junior who has since disavowed any affilia
tion with the group.
Only two students now admit to belong
it.j. to Students for Bestiality, and they say
they've been muzzled unfairly.
The idea for the group, they say, came
from a "right-wing, Republican handbook"
that showed many ways to bring issues into
the public eye.
The Student Administrative Board
didn't go for that, though, and, with the
support of Oregon's Gay and Lesbian Al
liance, revoked the group's registration.
But Students for Bestiality will keep up
the fight, arguing that they didn't receive
a fair hearing from members of the Stu
dent Administrative Board.
"They were just trying to figure out the
best way to get rid of us," one Students
for Bestiality member said. "This was a
kangaroo court."
Music — for a price

According to a Daily Trojan story, when

While political and religious organiza

you've got enough money the band is
waiting to play for you, according to USC

Marching Trojan Director Art Bartner.
The band has performed at such intellec
tually stimulating productions as Ihe
Mitzi Gaynor Show," "Grease II," "Annie
and"The Gong Show Movie."
The Trojans hauled in about $20,000 tor
their performance on Fleetwood Mac's
"Tusk" album and video a few years back.
If you want the Spirit of Troy to show

of options from which to choose. You can

All this is available to you — for a price.

Brother is a butcher
A Delta Upsilon brother at the I diver
sity nl Pennsylvania has been suspended
from his fraternity for " needlessly
slaughtering two animals.' l'he Daily Pen
nsylvanian reported.
Larry I iniek. a junior majoring in engi
neering. allegedly killed a rat and
decapitated a chicken with an axe at a
"theme party" at the Dl house.
"At first, everything was within
bounds." DL' president Dave forman told
The Daily Pennsylvanian. "But as the party
started, everyone became aware that what
l.arry was doing was pretty sick.
What L.inick did was carry out to an only
somewhat logical extreme the idea behind
the Dl) party.
Forman said that each of the brothers at
the party "took a room and made it a
scenario."
One brother decorated his room as a
chocolate factory and another as a leather
store. Linick chose a butcher shop for his
room.
"Larry bought beef blood, animal
entrails and cow skulls at the Italian Mar
ket," Forman said. "He also bought a
couple of chickens and other animals. It
seemed as if he was going a little nuts."
After meeting with members of the na
tional Delta Upsilon organization and
alumni of the Pennsylvania chapter, For
man and the rest of the local chapter
decided to suspend — but not expel —
I.inick because the expulsion process was
too time-consuming.
However. Linick, who was unavailable for
comment, told Forman he thought the
punishment was unfair.
"L.arry thought what he did was
reasonable," Forman said. "He said he was
just making a statement and trying to
shock people."
Forman said several brothers had unsuc
cessfully tried to stop Linick from killing
the animals.
"I told him not to kill animals in front of
people, and he said he wouldn't," Forman
said. "Nobody thought he was capable of
killing those animals. The brothers could
not believe what had happened.
"They took a rabbit and another chicken
out of his room, and an alumni (sic) took
his axe away," Forman said.
Another fraternity member confirmed
that guests at the party were somewhat

"Most of the people were grossed out,
