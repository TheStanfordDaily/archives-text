## Lake Tahoe: Route 89 
### CATHY JANUS 
One of the most scenic
routes in Northern California
is Highway 89 along the shore
of Lake Tahoe. Starting at
Tahoe City, you travel south
30 miles to South Lake Tahoe.
Along the way you will glimpse
various forms of wildlife, a few
signs of civilization and mag
nificent views of the lake and
the mountain ranges.

The countryside along the
route is vivid: On the left is the
lake, whose deep blue color is
accentuated by the pine trees
growing on the shore-line.
There are a number of lookout
points; consequently, even the
driver can enjoy the beauty of
the lake.
Emerald Bay is especially pic
turesque. There is a small

forested island in the center of
this bay. Whether you travel
on the road in winter or in
spring, you will be awed by the
serenity of the lake and the
majestic cliffs and mountain
ranges. A railroad track runs
parallel to the road at some
points, and you may see an old
train traveling through the
tunnels carved in the moun

tainside.
When there is snow, it is im
perative that you drive with
snow tires or carry chains. The
highway is not steep nor are
the curves excessive, hut it is
nevertheless dangerous to drive
through the passes unprepared
for icy roads or for an unex
pected snow flurry.
There are a number of ski
resorts along the highway, in
cluding Homewood and Tahoe
Ski Bowl. Homewood is well
protected by surrounding
mountain ranges and offers
some of the best ski conditions
at Tahoe, especially on stormy
days. A quad chair, Tahoe's
first, services the summit.
Breathtaking views of the lake
accompany your return run.
Homewood is located six miles
south of Tahoe City, and you
may want to take advantage of
half-price tickets on weekdays.
Regular rates are $ 16.
Tahoe Ski Bowl is a smaller
resort wich offers plenty of va
riety for skiers of all levels of
ability. Once again, you can
take advantage of midweek
specials; prices are regularly
$14.
There are also a number of
camping facilities in the area,
many located on the lake. For
information on locations and
reservations, call the State De
partment of Parks and Recrea
tion at (916) 541-3030 or call
Ticketron.
Lodging can also be found in

Tahoe City, a town smaller and
quite different from South
Lake Tahoe, which is famous
for its casinos and extensive
night life. Tahoe City is rustic
and less flashy; at the entrance
to the town a large tree grows
in the middle of the road.
Small craft and tourist shops
and a number of restaurants,
many with a view of the lake,
line Main Street.
Many of the houses are old
stone cottages and log cabins,
and the shops along Main
Street are also built of wood,
so that everything blends with
nature. If you decide to stay in
Tahoe City, Mayfield House is
advantageously located a half
block off Main Street; at the
same time, one feels very iso
lated on this quiet side street.
The house itself, located at
236 Grove Street, is delightful.
Past or present residents of
Grove House at Stanford on
Mayfield Ave. needn't worry;
neither your room nor break
fast will remind you of Resi
dential Education!
According to manager Janie
Kellermyer, Mayfield House is
booked well in advance on
weekends. The house is espe
cially popular with
honeymooners and couples wish
ing to spend a romantic
weekend in a location in
the country and at the same
time conveniently within a
city.
This bed and breakfast inn is
truly very special. If you arrive
after 5 p.m. and the hostess

herself is not there to greet
you, a welcome note tells you
to help yourself to chilled wine
in the refrigerator, and you can
choose to have breakfast com
plete with a newspaper, fresh
squeezed orange-juice,
home-made pastries and fresh
fruit served in your room or
downstairs in the breakfast
nook the following morning.
And don't be shy; after
you've explored the house, feel
free to build a fire in the parlor
fireplace and sink into the
plush overstuffed chairs or
sofa.
The six rooms are tastefully
decorated and named after
people connected with the his
tory of the house and area.
Furnished mostly with original
antiques, they have sloped
ceilings and down comforters
and pillows on the beds. One
can sink into delightful
oblivion in this house; the fur
nishings and special touches
soothe and pamper you.
In your room you will find
fresh flowers, chocolates on
the night-stand and thick
velour towels and bath robes.
Bubble bath is also provided
for those wanting to luxuriate
in the extra-long bathtub.
Rates for Mayfield House,
between $50-70 per night, are
comparable to standard hotels
in Tahoe City.
Though you may be tempted
to spend all your time in the
cozy house, Tahoe City is
worth exploring. Once back on
Main Street, you can go to

Honkers Bar and Grill, a res
taurant constructed in the
oldest building in Tahoe City.
The building was brought over
from a lumber company in
1901. The decor inside is very
tasteful. There are tablecloths
and flowers on the tables, and
glass panels and pictures of
Canada geese on the walls.
Believing they needed to care
fully choose the name for their
restaurant, the owners decided
on Honkers, in honor of the
Canada geese living on the
shores of the lake.
The menu doesn't include
Canada geese, but comes
close, serving both chicken and
roast duckling. Honker's selec
tion is very diverse, what the
owner calls "eclectic." Besides
fowl, the restaurant prepares
fish, frog legs, rabbit, veal and
tournedos bernaise. Each meal
includes bread, soup or salad,
rice pilaf and a vegetable. The
price range is as wide as the va
riety of the menu, starting at
$6. Desserts such as chocolate
truffle mousse cake cost $2.75.
If you prefer to dine some
where with a view of the lake,
there are a number of other
restaurants, many serving full
course dinners, but one can also
eat pizza on terraces overlook
ing the lake.
Whatever you're looking for,
you're sure to be pleased by
Tahoe City and the diverse
forms of recreation and beau
tiful scenery in the area.
