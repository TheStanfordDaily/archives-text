# Route 1 to Point Reyes National Seashore
## 
### CATHY JANUS 
Point Reyes National Seashore, only
one hour north of the Golden Gate
Bridge, is one of AmericVs natural
splendors.
On the Point Reyes Peninsula are
vast expanses of green fields, desolate
except for the beautiful wildflowers,
imposing cliffs along the beaches and
miles of trails for day and overnight
hikers.
Highway 1, the primary road into the
area, snakes its course along a spectacu
lar coastal mountain range which was
formed by the relentless grinding to
gether for millions of years of the two
major geological plates of the West.
Alter a short leisurely drive you'll
arrive in Olcma, the gateway to Point
Reyes National Seashore. Here, at the
intersection of Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard and Highway 1, is Bear Val
ley Headquarters where rangers will
provide you with maps and books about
the area, as well as information on
guided hikes. Lodgings and restaurants
in the vicinity are rather scarce, but
there are six bed-and-breakfast inns
within a few minutes of the Bear Val

ley Visitor's Center.
The Olema Inn, located in the town,
is a restored century-old building. There
are three overnight rooms on the
second floor, furnished with antiques,
country iron and brass and quilted
bedspreads.
Bed and breakfast in this casually ele
gant inn, reminiscent of the Old South,
costs $50-70 nightly for two. For
reservations, write to The Olema Inn,
P.O. Box 10, Olema, CA 94950.
The inn has three dining rooms and a
patio deck where lunch, dinner and Sun
day brunch are served. In the dining
areas, with their high ceilings and
romantic table settings, exhibitions of
talented artists lend special interest to
the surroundings. There is also a full bar
at the inn.
1 decided to try the fare at the
Olema Inn, and was very pleased with
the service and the meals there.
Each entree is accompanied by home
made soup or salad. The soup that eve
ning was broccoli sprinkled with cheese.
It was very tasty. The menu varies
nightly, and that evening featured

steak sauteed in garlic, fish, duck and
chicken. Meals are reasonably priced be
tween $10 and $13. I ordered the duck,
which was baked to a golden brown and
covered by a slightly sweet sauce. It was
tender, and the flavor was distinct and
quite different from chicken. Served
with asparagus and potatoes, the meal
was delicious. Desserts range from rich
chocolate mousse to a fresh concoction
of kiwi and sliced fresh strawberries
covered with a light citrus-flavored
cream sauce.
Content after my meal, 1 traveled a
few miles down the road to romantic
and adventurous Blackthorne Inn. The
architecture of the building is itself a
natural wonder. Nestled in a wooded
canyon near the town of Inverness, this
unique structure resembles a giant
treehouse. Crafted from redwood,
cedar and a 180-foot douglas fir, the
inn rises through fragrant bay trees to
sunny decks on four levels.
As if this were not wonderous
enough, there is an outdoor hot tub on
the top deck which is perfect for relax
ing after a day of hiking or horseback

riding.
The hosts of the inn, who prize the
area, will gladly give you information on
the many points of interest on the
peninsula.
There are swimming beaches, such as
Drake's Beach, as well as beaches where
the tides are so strong that even wading
is prohibited. All beachfronts are care
fully marked, so you'll know which
waters are safe. You can also walk down
to the Point Reyes Lighthouse at the
tip of Point Reyes. One of the loveliest
hikes is on Tomales Point, where tule
elk roam.
Once back at the inn, you can sink
into the cushions conveniently placed
on the large stone foundation which
surrounds the fireplace. As you lean
against the cushions with a complimen
tary glass of sherry to warm you, look
through the skylights at the sky above.
Rates at the Blackthorne Inn begin
at $50/night and are decreased $5 if you
stay three nights or more. For informa
tion on the Blackthorne Inn write P.O.
Box 712, Inverness, CA 94937.
