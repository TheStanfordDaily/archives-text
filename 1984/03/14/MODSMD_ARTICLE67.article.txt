Dr. lean Hard ot a ho\ clis
covered in the forest ot

The Marriage of Maria
Braun (197'))
Bishop Auditorium
The opening scenes are
intriguing — Maria
(Hanna Si huvgulla) loses
her husband to the war on
their wedding day; after it
is oyer she parades up and
down the platform at the
train station with a
placard asking homecom
ing soldiers for informa
tion on his whereabouts.
But the movie soon
degenerates into a politi
cal fable about Germany
and capitalism that is al
ternately obvious and
opaque. Though much
better crafted than Rainer
Fassbinder's earlier
rtiovies, it's emotion. 111 v
blank. Sc huvgulla, Fas
sbinder's favorite ac tress,
looks ama/ing and gives
an interesting, Dietrich
like performance.
Plays tonight at 7:TO.

Carv Grant (as a

rather than a paleon

rennial student rather
than a madcap heiress).
Instead ot identic al twin
leopards, identical

comedy and Peter Bog
danov ii h direi ted it; it's
awfully tunny, though
R\an O'Neal is a pretty
pathetic substitute for

gives a delightful comic
performance, and she
sings perhaps the best
rendition of ( ole Porter's
"You're the Top" (behind
the credits) that anyone's
ever done. (You have to
mcmori/c her phrasing as

Timothy Bottoms
struggles through his first
year ot Harvard law

with Lindsay Wagner,
whose uncle, John
Houseman, is the most
brilliant professor in the
institution and a terror to
all his students. Bottoms is
a sympathetic ai lor, but
the constant
state of emotional crisis
seems to be an overblown
reac lion to the situation
he's in, and at live end,
when he receives his
grades and losses the en
