From the Los Angeles Times
Lausanne, Switzerland â€”After hours
of bickering. Lebanon's factional
leaders agreed yesterday on a cease-fire
in Beirut, a necessary first step before
they take up proposed governmental
reforms aimed at permanently ending
the violence there.
Soon after the announcement, the
shooting between Moslems and Chris
tians in the divided Lebanese capital
died away. The calm followed a brief
period of intense firing b\ both sides.
A high-ranking Lebanese government
official attending the talks here said he
did not expect the truce to hold until
the negotiators could agree on a na
tional unity government bringing repre
sentatives of all of Lebanon's feuding
sects into the Cabinet. He said the
various militia factions could be ex
pected to resume lighting as a means of
showing their displeasure with any ac
tion by President Amin Gemayel.
The cease-fire announcement, by
presidential spokesman Michel Samaha,
came early vesterday evening, at the

end of the second day of Lebanon's
second round of national reconciliation
talks. According to the statement, all
shooting was supposed to stop at 9 p.m.
Beirut time.
At one point in the morning session
of the conference, former Premier Saeb
Salaam threatened to walk out if the
delegates took up any subject other
than a cease-fire. Salaam's wife, who
did not accompany him here, had repor
tedly spent Monday night in a base
ment shelter after their West Beirut
home was hit by some kind of shell.
Samaha also said he hoped arrange
ments can be made within the next few
days to allow the reopening of both the
Beirut International Airport and the
city's seaport. Both have been closed
since Feb. 6. when Moslem and Druse
militiamen took over West Beirut,
precipitating the renewed lighting
along the so-called Green Line that
divides the city.
He said a military committee made
up of representatives of all Lebanese
factions would meet in Beirut this mor

ning to begin dealing with the details ot
disengaging forces along the Green
Line.
He also said the truce would be super
vised by retired police and army offi
cers. The negotiators were unable to
assign the task to the Lebanese army
because it divided along religious lines
after the fighting of Feb. 6.
The arranging of a cease-fire was the
first item listed by Gemayel in his
opening address Monday to the eight
other Lebanese leaders participating in
the talks. A committee was set up
Monday night to make the arrange
ments. and it met until 3 a.m. yester
day.
Another source also said contact had
been made with leaders of the Lebanese
Forces, a coalition of Christian militias
dominated by the Christian Phalan
gists, who declared last week that they
would not he bound by any decision at
the conference here. He said the Chris
tian militia, like the others, had now
agreed to abide by the cease-fire.
But the hiuh-rankina government of

t'icial who predicted that the truce
would not hold suggested that groups
outside the control of those attending
the talks might break the cease-tire.
Among others, he mentioned radical
Shia Moslems who express allegiance to
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
The negotiators are expected to
begin discussing political reforms today.
The major issue is power-sharing be
tween Lebanon's Christians on one
hand and the Moslems and Druse on the
other. The Druse are members of an off
shoot sect ot Islam.
The Christians have long dominated
Lebanese politics despite a prepon
derance of Moslems in the population.
Recently, however. Syrian-supported
Moslem and Druse militias defeated
the Christian-dominated Lebanese
army in a series ot battles, torcing
Geniayel to bow to Syrian demands
that he cancel a controversial troop
withdrawal and security agreement
with Israel and to concede that
Lebanon's Moslems should be given
more political clout.
