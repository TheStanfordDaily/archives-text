McGovern withdraws
Boston — George McGovern withdrew
from the Democratic presidential campaign
last night after finishing third in the Massa
chusetts primary behind Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart and former Vice President Walter
Mondale.
"I said two weeks ago here in Boston that
if 1 did not place first or second in this impor-

tant pri
mary race,"
the former
South
Dakota
senator
said, "1
would
withdraw
from the

presidential competition of 1984. And that
is what I intend to do. With all good cheer, I
fully accept the verdict of my very special
friends, the voters of the state of Massachu
setts, who gave us a very strong showing. I
think far beyond what anyone expected a
short time ago."
In his landslide loss to Richard Nixon in
1972, Massachusetts was the only state
McGovern carried — he also won in the Dis
trict of Columbia.
Earlier in the evening as reports on the
voting fluctuated, there were conflicting

reports about whether McGovern would con
tinue.
National campaign manager Paul Sullivan
said McGovern had an "infrastructure" ready
to go in Illinois including 20 to 30 volunteers
whose ranks could be increased immediately.
In making his bare bones run. McGovern
already has gone a considerable distance
toward accomplishing the political impossible
— shaking a loser's image without benefit of

a single win.
McGov
ern's call to
conscience
and the role
he has
played as
conciliator
among the
seven other

Democratic contenders have won him an out
pouring of affection and a virtually assured
position as a party elder statesman.
Mondale expresses relief
Washington — A smiling and jubilant
Mondale breathed a sigh of relief over his
two victories in the South yesterday night
and told a cheering crowd at a downtown
hotel that the race for the Democratic
nomination had changed from a 100-yard
dash into a marathon.
"A month ago, this was a bandwagon,"

Mondale told a cheering crowd of supporters
at the Capital Hilton. "Tonight, it's a
crusade .. . .Tonight it's a marathon."
As his aides passed the word that they
believed Mondale had weathered the most
difficult two weeks of his political life, the
candidate expressed his thanks to supporters
in the idiom of the people of the South,
country music.
"It's easy to jump on a juggernaut," he said
to the cheers of the audience. "But to stand
by your man takes class."
Mondale's upbeat mood reflected the
lowered expectations of a campaign that
once appeared headed for an easy and early
victory in the fight for the nomination, and
his advisers recognized that, at most,
Mondale's showing yesterday gave him the
opportunity to try to make his case against
Hart.
Mondale said he was looking forward to
this Saturday's caucuses in Arkansas, Missis
sippi, Kentucky and South Carolina and then
to the Illinois primary and the Minnesota
caucuses next Tuesday.
Black voters hack Jackson
Birmingham, Ala. — Southern black voters
yesterday threw most of their burgeoning po
litical strength behind the pioneering
presidential candidacy of civil-rights leader
Jesse Jackson, while a sizable number tried to
help salvage the campaign of Mondale, an old
friend.
Jackson appeared to have won a majority
of black votes in Georgia and Florida and was
running slightly ahead of Mondale in black
communities in Alabama, according to ABC

polls. Mondale clearly outdrew Hart among
blacks.
Yesterday's primaries in Alabama, Georgia
and Florida were the first real test of Jack
son's strength among black voters. Each of
the states has a large black population, ran
ging from 11.3 percent of the voting-age
population in Florida to 22.9 percent in Ala
bama and 24.3 percent in Georgia. Through
out the three states, massive voter
registration campaigns have increased the
percentage of registered voters who are
black. In Alabama, 35,366 of the 42,000 new
registered voters this year were black.
Where's the beef?
Washington — Twenty-four hours before
Mondale asked, "Where's the beef' in Hart's
new ideas, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland
posed the same question at a Rosemont, 111.,
rally.
At a regional AFL-CIO rally Saturday,
Kirkland accused the Colorado senator of
"riding the wave of a media blitz" with "only
a vague promise of a bigger pie in the sky, by
and by."
"You can apply the burger test to Hart."
Kirkland said. "It's a big bun, but where's the
beef?"
During the Democratic candidate debate
in Atlanta on Sunday, Mondale, who has been
accused of being too closely aligned to the
AFL-CIO, demanded that Hart spell out his
"new ideas" for America.
"When I hear about your new ideas,"
Mondale told Hart, "I'm reminded of the ad,
"Where's the beef?' "

Mondale expresses relief
Washington — A smiling and jubilant
Mondale breathed a sigh of relief over his
two victories in the South yesterday night
and told a cheering crowd at a downtown
hotel that the race for the Democratic
nomination had changed from a 100-yard
dash into a marathon.
"A month ago, this was a bandwagon,"

Mondale told a cheering crowd of supporters
at the Capital Hilton. "Tonight, it's a
crusade .. . .Tonight it's a marathon."
As his aides passed the word that they
believed Mondale had weathered the most
difficult two weeks of his political life, the
candidate expressed his thanks to supporters
in the idiom of the people of the South,
country music.
"It's easy to jump on a juggernaut," he said
to the cheers of the audience. "But to stand
by your man takes class."
Mondale's upbeat mood reflected the
lowered expectations of a campaign that
once appeared headed for an easy and early
victory in the fight for the nomination, and
his advisers recognized that, at most,
Mondale's showing yesterday gave him the
opportunity to try to make his case against
Hart.
Mondale said he was looking forward to
this Saturday's caucuses in Arkansas, Missis
sippi, Kentucky and South Carolina and then
to the Illinois primary and the Minnesota
caucuses next Tuesday.
Black voters hack Jackson
Birmingham, Ala. — Southern black voters
yesterday threw most of their burgeoning po
litical strength behind the pioneering
presidential candidacy of civil-rights leader
Jesse Jackson, while a sizable number tried to
help salvage the campaign of Mondale, an old
friend.
Jackson appeared to have won a majority
of black votes in Georgia and Florida and was
running slightly ahead of Mondale in black
communities in Alabama, according to ABC

polls. Mondale clearly outdrew Hart among
blacks.
Yesterday's primaries in Alabama, Georgia
and Florida were the first real test of Jack
son's strength among black voters. Each of
the states has a large black population, ran
ging from 11.3 percent of the voting-age
population in Florida to 22.9 percent in Ala
bama and 24.3 percent in Georgia. Through
out the three states, massive voter
registration campaigns have increased the
percentage of registered voters who are
black. In Alabama, 35,366 of the 42,000 new
registered voters this year were black.
Where's the beef?
Washington — Twenty-four hours before
Mondale asked, "Where's the beef' in Hart's
new ideas, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland
posed the same question at a Rosemont, 111.,
rally.
At a regional AFL-CIO rally Saturday,
Kirkland accused the Colorado senator of
"riding the wave of a media blitz" with "only
a vague promise of a bigger pie in the sky, by
and by."
"You can apply the burger test to Hart."
Kirkland said. "It's a big bun, but where's the
beef?"
During the Democratic candidate debate
in Atlanta on Sunday, Mondale, who has been
accused of being too closely aligned to the
AFL-CIO, demanded that Hart spell out his
"new ideas" for America.
"When I hear about your new ideas,"
Mondale told Hart, "I'm reminded of the ad,
"Where's the beef?' "

McGovern withdraws
Boston — George McGovern withdrew
from the Democratic presidential campaign
last night after finishing third in the Massa
chusetts primary behind Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart and former Vice President Walter
Mondale.
"I said two weeks ago here in Boston that
if 1 did not place first or second in this impor-

tant pri
mary race,"
the former
South
Dakota
senator
said, "1
would
withdraw
from the

presidential competition of 1984. And that
is what I intend to do. With all good cheer, I
fully accept the verdict of my very special
friends, the voters of the state of Massachu
setts, who gave us a very strong showing. I
think far beyond what anyone expected a
short time ago."
In his landslide loss to Richard Nixon in
1972, Massachusetts was the only state
McGovern carried — he also won in the Dis
trict of Columbia.
Earlier in the evening as reports on the
voting fluctuated, there were conflicting

reports about whether McGovern would con
tinue.
National campaign manager Paul Sullivan
said McGovern had an "infrastructure" ready
to go in Illinois including 20 to 30 volunteers
whose ranks could be increased immediately.
In making his bare bones run. McGovern
already has gone a considerable distance
toward accomplishing the political impossible
— shaking a loser's image without benefit of

a single win.
McGov
ern's call to
conscience
and the role
he has
played as
conciliator
among the
seven other

Democratic contenders have won him an out
pouring of affection and a virtually assured
position as a party elder statesman.
