Members of the gay community rightly attri
bute the destruction of the "Gay Liberation"
statue to a certain homophobic current on
campus. Whether this narrow-minded paranoia
exists among a wave of people or just one
hammer-wielding vandal does little to blunt the
reality: Homosexuals are victims of a senseless
hate advanced by insecure individuals.
Last week's episode is undeniably tallied as a
victory by these very individuals. Their end —
the destruction of the statue, and, with it, a
part of the gay community — was achieved.
And yet, by a perverse set of circumstances,
the incident can be considered a boost for the
gay community as well. At the expense of a fine
and expensive work of art, those hammer blows
did more for homosexual rights and awareness
than any lecture, rally or seminar could have.
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford,
reacting astutely to the attack, took advantage
of the situation on a political level. By adorning
the former site of the sculpture with flowers,
organizing a noon campus rally and urging others

to share in their grief, the gay community has
reaped some gains out of this otherwise con
demnable incident.
Still, there are no winners. While the episode
may have served some purpose for the two ex
tremes, the rest of us lose. That statue, it must
be remembered, was first and foremost a work
of art, a fact too often shrouded by the politics
of the piece. The community thus loses not only
a bold and important statement on
homosexuality, but, more simply, a George. Segal
sculpture.
Despite the damage to the work — or, per
haps, because of it — the University should
recast and replace "Gay Liberation." That
statue needs to be displayed as a testament to
the existence and endurance of homosexuality.
Marcel Proust once wrote, "Only through art
can we get outside of ourselves and know an
other's view of the universe." "Gay Liberation"
offered us all that opportunity; to relegate the
work to permanent storage would deprive the
campus of both Segal's artistic accomplishments
and the awareness of another's universe.
