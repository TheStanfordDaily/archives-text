# Fitness: Seek the Middle Road

### Lindy Birkel Fitness Project Manager Health Promotion Program 
On nearly every magazine
cover this spring, you will see
headlines on shaping up and
physical fitness. From a health
standpoint, this is a very favor
able craze. The health benefits of
exercise are numerous and very
desirable.

But can this passtime be taken
too far? As with most things, yes.
There are hazards with the ex
treme.
Consider yourself at some
point along an exercise con
tinuum according to your level of
activity. At both ends of this con
tinuum, you are likely to be in a
poorer state of health than if you
are in the middle. That is, too
little or too much exercise can be
bad for your health.
Not exercising can bring about

a greater risk of heart disease,
poor muscle tone and endurance,
hone and joint disorders, over
weight, and a generally diminised
sense of well-being or lack of
vitality. The minimum amount of
exercise necessary to provide a
substantial boost in fitness and,
therefore, health is the following
prescription: Twenty minutes of
aerobic exercise (e.g. walking,

jogging, cycling, swimming,
aerobic dance, etc.) every other
day.
Amounts of activity less than
this, such as a weekly intramural
game, do not bring a person to
the threshold of good health.
That is, to consider yourself in
shape, you must (at a minimum)
complete the above exercise
prescription on a regular basis.
The upper limit of the healthy
range cannot be defined with a
prescription. Different individ

uals seem to have different levels
of exercise at which one of the
following unhealthy symptoms
occurs: excessive weight loss, in
jury, amenorrhea or a breakdown
in relationships. Excessive weight
loss and amenorrhea result trom
exceedingly high levels of activity
for many people that, once
passed, injuries resulting from
overuse begin to occur. For best
health, it is clear that a gradually
developed, moderate exercise
program produces the maximum
in health benefits without the risk
of unhealthy symptoms.
The following is a more
detailed description of each ail
ment.
Excessive weight loss
A certain amount of fat is nec
essary for healthy body function.
In fact, studies have shown that
those with "a little padding" are
actually in better health than
those very thin or those very fat.
The standard for thinness in our
society is without regard for
health. When considering a re
ducing program, keep in mind
that a recent Cowell survey
showed that most Stanford stu
dents do not need to lose weight
and, in fact, would sacrifice a bit
of good health in doing so.
A moderate exercise program
is desirable to improve the gen
eral body tone and prov ide other
health benefits, and, on such a
program, pounds will gradually
