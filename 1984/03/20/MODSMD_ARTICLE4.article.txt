# Athletic Eating: How to Mix Fitness, Nutrition
## 
### John Dorman, M. D 
Nutrition has received an in
creased amount of attention in
recent years. If nutrition is impor
tant for everyone, it is particularly
important for athletes, whether a
casual jogger, intramural compet
itor or varsity athlete. Athletes
require more of some nutrients
than do sedentary types, but not
all nutrients; some can be poten
tially harmful.
In her "Nutrition Book," Jane
Brody writes that "inadequate
hydration is a ma jor cause of poor
performance, fatigue, illness, and
occasionaly even death during
vigorous activity, especially
during hot weather."
All of us require water, which
makes up f>o percent of our body
weight. A large muscular male
athlete has a somewhat higher
percentage, while a sedentary wo
man has a lower percentage.
Authorities recommend that we
drink a minimum of one quart of
water for every 1000 calories we
cat; for most of us that means at
least two to three quarts per day.
This requirement may drastically
go uii with the heat, humidity or
vigorous exercise, and thirst
alone is not always a reliable in
dicator of the body's need.
Minerals are required in
varying amounts; major require
ments are for sodium, potassium,
sulfur, chloride, calcium, phos
phorous and magnesium. For
those on normal diets, there is no
problem with deficiencies of these
minerals in this country, although
some early work has suggested
that women not having menstrual
periods may need a larger intake
ol calcium and perhaps mag
nesium. We also require trace
minerals in small amounts; the
most important of these are iron,
iodine and fluoride. Iron
dcficienc\ may have an impact on
athletic performance because it is
a necessary component of the
hemoglobin in blood. Because of
menstruation, women are more
susceptible to iron problems than
are men, in whom it is rare.
Vegetarians are more susceptible
than meat eaters.
Vitamins act in the body as
regulators of biochemical reac
tions. I hev are not sources of en
erg \ and an athletes needs no
more vitamins than sedentary
types. An exception to this rule is
thiamine, one ol the B vitamins,
which must be taken in propor
tion to carbohydrate intake,
which is usually higher in athletes.
Fortunately, most sources of car
bohydrates. such as bread, are
high in thiamine anyway. Usually
vitamin intake is proportional to
the caloric content of the diet.
The more you eat of a wide \ arietv
ol foods, the more vitamin \ou
get. However. Vitamin ( nd \ i
tamin B" are in highest concentra
tions in low calorie foods such as
raw fruits and vegetables. The
basic message, then, is that in a
well balanced diet, no vitamin
supplements are necessary, even
for athletes. American urine is
said to be the most expensive in
the world, as most excess water
soluble vitamins (Band C) are
excreted in urine. Excess fat

soluble vitamins such as A. D. E,
and k arc stored in fat arnd there
are actually diseases associated
with excessive amounts of A and
D.
Fats arc the most concentrated
source of energy that we eat, and,
consequently, it is the best way
for the body to store energy. Fats
butter, gravies, sauces — add
taste to foods and it is tempting to
overdo it. They are sources of
linolic adic, which the body can
not make itself. Also, fats are
vehicles for the fat-soluble
vitamins. Perhaps for this reason,
fats also fill us up, because they
are slow to leave the stomach.
Anyone who has tried to run after
a greasy hamburger can attest to
this characteristic.
Athletes have to be particularly
careful with their intake of
ch ol estoral-containing
"saturated" animal fat with
protein, as in steaks. Most auth
orities recommend limiting red
meat intake to three or four times
per week, egg intake to three a
week and a limitation of luncheon
meats. Protein is the least ef
ficent source of caloric intake, al

though it does contain the nine
essential amino acids. Most
American eat two to three times
as much protein as they need.
Contrary to public opinion, ath
letic activity does not require a
significantly higher protein
intake. In "Nutrition Book."
Brody writes. "A high protein,
high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet is
a sure path to quick fatigue and
poor performance."
In fact, since all amino acids in
protein must be broken down in
to urea and excreted in the urine,
a protein load in an athlete can
cause dehydration from the re
quired water loss. Protein supple
ments. in addition to aggravating
this water loss, may cause loss of
appetite and diarrhea.
Carbohydrates represent the
major requirement of athletes.
They are inexpensive and the
most efficicient source of energy.
However, they can't be stored
and we carry around no more
than half a day's supply at any
given time. An athlete — or
anyone — needs to replenish his
supply every few hours. Low car
bohydrate diets are potentially

hazardous tor athletes in par
ticular. Complex carbohydrates
— fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts
and rice — are the most
nutritious. These are so important
that 55 to 60 percent of your daily
calories should come trom com
plex carbohydrates.
What, then, should athletes
eat? "Hrst. eat what you need,
then eat what you want." But
What do you need everyday?
You need two servings from the
milk group, two or more servings
from the fish, chicken, meat and
high protein group, four or more
servings from the fruit and
vegetables ( including potatoes)
group, and four servings from the
cereal and grain group.
Meat is not essential, especially
if milk and eggs are eaten. Other
sources of protein, such as beans
and nuts, will suffice if combined
carefully.
In general, an athlete preparing
for imminent competition should
consume adequate fluids, with
minimal residue, adequate
calories for energy, and little salt.
During vigorous exercise, water is
needed in the cells of the body.

Salt intake in excess of water
draws water out of the cells where
it is needed. Most foods contain
adequate sodium for most ath
letes, even without being salted,
A final note: Occasionally ath
letes trying to build up muscles
and strength turn to anabolic
steroids for assistance. There is
no question that chemicals in
crease muscle bulk, but whether
they improve strength and per
formace is controversial. More
importantly, in men they cause
salt and water retention, possible
high blood pressure, acne, breast
enlargement, testicular atrophy,
decreased sperm count and im
potence. In women, they cause
increased hair growth, baldness,
enlargement of the clitoris, pos
sibly irreversibly. In both sexes
they can cause cysts, inflamma
tion and cancer of the liver;
deaths have been documented.
They have no place in the nutri
tional plan for athletes.

Smith. Much of the information
here comes from that book.

fats also fill us up, because they
are slow to leave the stomach.
Anyone who has tried to run after
a greasy hamburger can attest to
this characteristic.
Athletes have to be particularly
careful with their intake of
ch ol estoral-containing
"saturated" animal fat with
protein, as in steaks. Most auth
orities recommend limiting red
meat intake to three or four times
per week, egg intake to three a
week and a limitation of luncheon
meats. Protein is the least ef
ficent source of caloric intake, al

though it does contain the nine
essential amino acids. Most
American eat two to three times
as much protein as they need.
Contrary to public opinion, ath
letic activity does not require a
significantly higher protein
intake. In "Nutrition Book."
Brody writes. "A high protein,
high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet is
a sure path to quick fatigue and
poor performance."
In fact, since all amino acids in
protein must be broken down in
to urea and excreted in the urine,
a protein load in an athlete can
cause dehydration from the re
quired water loss. Protein supple
ments. in addition to aggravating
this water loss, may cause loss of
appetite and diarrhea.
Carbohydrates represent the
major requirement of athletes.
They are inexpensive and the
most efficicient source of energy.
However, they can't be stored
and we carry around no more
than half a day's supply at any
given time. An athlete — or
anyone — needs to replenish his
supply every few hours. Low car
bohydrate diets are potentially

hazardous tor athletes in par
ticular. Complex carbohydrates
— fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts
and rice — are the most
nutritious. These are so important
that 55 to 60 percent of your daily
calories should come trom com
plex carbohydrates.
What, then, should athletes
eat? "Hrst. eat what you need,
then eat what you want." But
What do you need everyday?
You need two servings from the
milk group, two or more servings
from the fish, chicken, meat and
high protein group, four or more
servings from the fruit and
vegetables ( including potatoes)
group, and four servings from the
cereal and grain group.
Meat is not essential, especially
if milk and eggs are eaten. Other
sources of protein, such as beans
and nuts, will suffice if combined
carefully.
In general, an athlete preparing
for imminent competition should
consume adequate fluids, with
minimal residue, adequate
calories for energy, and little salt.
During vigorous exercise, water is
needed in the cells of the body.

Salt intake in excess of water
draws water out of the cells where
it is needed. Most foods contain
adequate sodium for most ath
letes, even without being salted,
A final note: Occasionally ath
letes trying to build up muscles
and strength turn to anabolic
steroids for assistance. There is
no question that chemicals in
crease muscle bulk, but whether
they improve strength and per
formace is controversial. More
importantly, in men they cause
salt and water retention, possible
high blood pressure, acne, breast
enlargement, testicular atrophy,
decreased sperm count and im
potence. In women, they cause
increased hair growth, baldness,
enlargement of the clitoris, pos
sibly irreversibly. In both sexes
they can cause cysts, inflamma
tion and cancer of the liver;
deaths have been documented.
They have no place in the nutri
tional plan for athletes.

Nutrition has received an in
creased amount of attention in
recent years. If nutrition is impor
tant for everyone, it is particularly
important for athletes, whether a
casual jogger, intramural compet
itor or varsity athlete. Athletes
require more of some nutrients
than do sedentary types, but not
all nutrients; some can be poten
tially harmful.
In her "Nutrition Book," Jane
Brody writes that "inadequate
hydration is a ma jor cause of poor
performance, fatigue, illness, and
occasionaly even death during
vigorous activity, especially
during hot weather."
All of us require water, which
makes up f>o percent of our body
weight. A large muscular male
athlete has a somewhat higher
percentage, while a sedentary wo
man has a lower percentage.
Authorities recommend that we
drink a minimum of one quart of
water for every 1000 calories we
cat; for most of us that means at
least two to three quarts per day.
This requirement may drastically
go uii with the heat, humidity or
vigorous exercise, and thirst
alone is not always a reliable in
dicator of the body's need.
Minerals are required in
varying amounts; major require
ments are for sodium, potassium,
sulfur, chloride, calcium, phos
phorous and magnesium. For
those on normal diets, there is no
problem with deficiencies of these
minerals in this country, although
some early work has suggested
that women not having menstrual
periods may need a larger intake
ol calcium and perhaps mag
nesium. We also require trace
minerals in small amounts; the
most important of these are iron,
iodine and fluoride. Iron
dcficienc\ may have an impact on
athletic performance because it is
a necessary component of the
hemoglobin in blood. Because of
menstruation, women are more
susceptible to iron problems than
are men, in whom it is rare.
Vegetarians are more susceptible
than meat eaters.
Vitamins act in the body as
regulators of biochemical reac
tions. I hev are not sources of en
erg \ and an athletes needs no
more vitamins than sedentary
types. An exception to this rule is
thiamine, one ol the B vitamins,
which must be taken in propor
tion to carbohydrate intake,
which is usually higher in athletes.
Fortunately, most sources of car
bohydrates. such as bread, are
high in thiamine anyway. Usually
vitamin intake is proportional to
the caloric content of the diet.
The more you eat of a wide \ arietv
ol foods, the more vitamin \ou
get. However. Vitamin ( nd \ i
tamin B" are in highest concentra
tions in low calorie foods such as
raw fruits and vegetables. The
basic message, then, is that in a
well balanced diet, no vitamin
supplements are necessary, even
for athletes. American urine is
said to be the most expensive in
the world, as most excess water
soluble vitamins (Band C) are
excreted in urine. Excess fat

soluble vitamins such as A. D. E,
and k arc stored in fat arnd there
are actually diseases associated
with excessive amounts of A and
D.
Fats arc the most concentrated
source of energy that we eat, and,
consequently, it is the best way
for the body to store energy. Fats
butter, gravies, sauces — add
taste to foods and it is tempting to
overdo it. They are sources of
linolic adic, which the body can
not make itself. Also, fats are
vehicles for the fat-soluble
vitamins. Perhaps for this reason,
fats also fill us up, because they
are slow to leave the stomach.
