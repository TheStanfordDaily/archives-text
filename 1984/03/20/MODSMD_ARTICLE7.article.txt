Do you know what came immediately to my mind? "Think
of health, think of Cowell," a slogan I am sure you have heard
already. Why? Well, it's at Cowell where I get the exercise
that makes me feel the best. You should try it. There is noth
ing like looking for charts. Do you want to build cardiovas
cular strength, improve muscle tone or increase flexibility?
Just do this, even if you don't have any charts to pull. Lift one
hand and stretch, and then the other and stretch. Repeat,
then go up and down as many times as you are able to, the
more the better. Let me tell you, it works!

Besides running, I like
pulling out the stops,
throwing mv weight around
and climbing the ladder of
success.
