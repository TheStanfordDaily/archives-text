POISON OAK AND POISON
IVY: Itching skin lesions which
lollow contact with poison
oak and poison ivy and other
plants of the Rhus family are the
most common example ol a
larger category ol skin problems
known as "contact dermatitis."
Contact dcrmititis simply means
that something has been applied
to the skin which has caused the
skin to react to it. An initial expo
sure is necessary to "sensitize"
the skin: a subsequent exposure
will result in an allergic reaction ii
the plant oil remains in contact with
the skin for several hours. The re
sulting rash begins after 12 to 4N
hours and persists for about two
weeks. Contact may be directly
with the plants, or indirectly,
through pets, contaminated cloth
ing, or smoke from burning rhus
plants. It can occur during any
season.
The best treatment is to avoid
the plants, which are hazardous
even in the winter, when they
have dropped their leaves. Next
best is to remove the plant oil
from the skin as soon as possible.
If the oil has been on the skin for
less than six hours, thorough
cleansings with a strong soap,
repeated three times, will usually
prevent reaction.

Cowell recommends cold com
presses of Burrows solution, and
ice will also frequently diminish
itching. A hot shower or bath will
also provide some symptomatic
relief. Heat releases histamine,
the substance in the cells of the
skin which causes the intense
itching. Therefore, a hot shower
or bath will cause intense itching
as the histamine in released. The
heat is gradually increased to the
maximum tolerable (don't burn
yourself!) and continued until the
itching has subsided. This process
will deplete the cells of histamine
and you will often obtain eight
hours of relief from the itching.
This method has the advantage of
not requiring frequent applica
tions of ointments to the lesions
and is a good way to get some
sleep at night. Poison oak or
poison ivy will persist for the
same length of time, regardless of
the medication. Cut the nails to
avoid damage to the skin through
scratching, and come to Cowell
for more information.
ATHLETE'S FOOT: Athlete s
foot, the most common kind of
tungous infection, is aggravated by
friction and moisture. When com
munity shower facilities are used,
exposure to this fungus is
impossible to prevent. Hygiene is
very important. Twice a day.

wash between the toes with soap
and water. Dry the entire area
carefully with a towel and wear
clean cotton socks. In difficult
cases, tolnaftate or miconazole
can be used. Both come in cream
and lotion form and are available
without a prescription.
JOCK ITCH: Jock itch, or "Tenia
Cruris," is a fungus infection of
the groin region. It is aggravated
by friction and moisture. It
usually does not involve the
scrotum or penis or spread
beyond the groin area, but is
usually confined to the inside of
the upper thighs. Tolnaftate or
miconazole may be used in cream
or liquid form to treat jock itch.
The problem should also be
treated by removing contributing
factors, friction and moisture.
This is done by using boxer shorts
rather than "Jockey" shorts, by
applying a powder to dry the area
after bathing, and by frequently
changing soiled or sweaty under
clothes. It may take up to two
weeks to completely clear this
problem, and it may recur. It is
important with recurrence to rule
out secondary bacterial and yeast
infection: this can be accom
plished by a visit to your health
care provider at Cowell.
SHIN SPLINTS: Shin splints are
characterized by pain down the

bony ridge of the front of the calf
and occasionally down the
outside crest of the bone in the
calf. The damage is to the muscle
and tendons in this area and not
to the bone itself, in spite of the
name. If you are strictly a recrea
tional runner or dancer, a short
period of rest is the key to relief.
Proper shoes, stretching, appro
priate conditioning and workouts
on softer surfaces will prevent
most recurrences. Recurrent
cases may often be relieved with a
proper orthotic. When shin
splints occur in the well
conditioned competitive athlete,
a switch to swimming or bicycling
is an excellent alternative to
maintain your conditioning until
your sport can be resumed. With
persistent problems, stress
fractures must be ruled out. If this
is the case, come to Cowell for an
evaluation.
KEGEL EXERCISES: The
pubococcygeus, or P.C. muscles,
are a band of muscle in the vagina
which should be about three
quarters of an inch wide when
fully developed. It is located
about a third of the way into the
vagina and runs circularly. The
muscle contains most of the nerve
endings found in the vagina, and,
as such, is the source of sexual
vaginal feelings.

When exercised, the P.C.
muscles not only strengthen uri
nary sphincter control, but in
crease muscle tone in the vagina,
thus increasing the ability to con
strict the vagina voluntarily. Con
sequently, female vaginal percep
tion and response during penile
vaginal intercourse are increased.
The exercises also help to elimi
nate pain during intercourse
The exercises are of greatest
importance in women who have
had children. The vaginal muscles
get stretched out and need to be
"toned up" again. Some refer to
Kegel exercises as "vaginal pus
hups." They were originally
developed by Kegel so that older
women would not develop (the
leaking of urine with laughter or
coughing) after child bearing.
For women who wish to be
come more responsive to genital
stimulation, the use and training
ot the P.C. muscle is one of the
most effective individual tech
niques producing the desired
therapeutic results. If you would
like more information regarding
how and when to do the exercises,
contact the Women's Care Clinic
at Cowell.

itching. A hot shower or bath will
also provide some symptomatic
relief. Heat releases histamine,
the substance in the cells of the
skin which causes the intense
itching. Therefore, a hot shower
or bath will cause intense itching
as the histamine in released. The
heat is gradually increased to the
maximum tolerable (don't burn
yourself!) and continued until the
itching has subsided. This process
will deplete the cells of histamine
and you will often obtain eight
hours of relief from the itching.
This method has the advantage of
not requiring frequent applica
tions of ointments to the lesions
and is a good way to get some
sleep at night. Poison oak or
poison ivy will persist for the
same length of time, regardless of
the medication. Cut the nails to
avoid damage to the skin through
scratching, and come to Cowell
for more information.
ATHLETE'S FOOT: Athlete s
foot, the most common kind of
tungous infection, is aggravated by
friction and moisture. When com
munity shower facilities are used,
exposure to this fungus is
impossible to prevent. Hygiene is
very important. Twice a day.

wash between the toes with soap
and water. Dry the entire area
carefully with a towel and wear
clean cotton socks. In difficult
cases, tolnaftate or miconazole
can be used. Both come in cream
and lotion form and are available
without a prescription.
JOCK ITCH: Jock itch, or "Tenia
Cruris," is a fungus infection of
the groin region. It is aggravated
by friction and moisture. It
usually does not involve the
scrotum or penis or spread
beyond the groin area, but is
usually confined to the inside of
the upper thighs. Tolnaftate or
miconazole may be used in cream
or liquid form to treat jock itch.
The problem should also be
treated by removing contributing
factors, friction and moisture.
This is done by using boxer shorts
rather than "Jockey" shorts, by
applying a powder to dry the area
after bathing, and by frequently
changing soiled or sweaty under
clothes. It may take up to two
weeks to completely clear this
problem, and it may recur. It is
important with recurrence to rule
out secondary bacterial and yeast
infection: this can be accom
plished by a visit to your health
care provider at Cowell.
SHIN SPLINTS: Shin splints are
characterized by pain down the

bony ridge of the front of the calf
and occasionally down the
outside crest of the bone in the
calf. The damage is to the muscle
and tendons in this area and not
to the bone itself, in spite of the
name. If you are strictly a recrea
tional runner or dancer, a short
period of rest is the key to relief.
Proper shoes, stretching, appro
priate conditioning and workouts
on softer surfaces will prevent
most recurrences. Recurrent
cases may often be relieved with a
proper orthotic. When shin
splints occur in the well
conditioned competitive athlete,
a switch to swimming or bicycling
is an excellent alternative to
maintain your conditioning until
your sport can be resumed. With
persistent problems, stress
fractures must be ruled out. If this
is the case, come to Cowell for an
evaluation.
KEGEL EXERCISES: The
pubococcygeus, or P.C. muscles,
are a band of muscle in the vagina
which should be about three
quarters of an inch wide when
fully developed. It is located
about a third of the way into the
vagina and runs circularly. The
muscle contains most of the nerve
endings found in the vagina, and,
as such, is the source of sexual
vaginal feelings.

When exercised, the P.C.
muscles not only strengthen uri
nary sphincter control, but in
crease muscle tone in the vagina,
thus increasing the ability to con
strict the vagina voluntarily. Con
sequently, female vaginal percep
tion and response during penile
vaginal intercourse are increased.
The exercises also help to elimi
nate pain during intercourse
The exercises are of greatest
importance in women who have
had children. The vaginal muscles
get stretched out and need to be
"toned up" again. Some refer to
Kegel exercises as "vaginal pus
hups." They were originally
developed by Kegel so that older
women would not develop (the
leaking of urine with laughter or
coughing) after child bearing.
For women who wish to be
come more responsive to genital
stimulation, the use and training
ot the P.C. muscle is one of the
most effective individual tech
niques producing the desired
therapeutic results. If you would
like more information regarding
how and when to do the exercises,
contact the Women's Care Clinic
at Cowell.

POISON OAK AND POISON
IVY: Itching skin lesions which
lollow contact with poison
oak and poison ivy and other
plants of the Rhus family are the
most common example ol a
larger category ol skin problems
known as "contact dermatitis."
Contact dcrmititis simply means
that something has been applied
to the skin which has caused the
skin to react to it. An initial expo
sure is necessary to "sensitize"
the skin: a subsequent exposure
will result in an allergic reaction ii
the plant oil remains in contact with
the skin for several hours. The re
sulting rash begins after 12 to 4N
hours and persists for about two
weeks. Contact may be directly
with the plants, or indirectly,
through pets, contaminated cloth
ing, or smoke from burning rhus
plants. It can occur during any
season.
The best treatment is to avoid
the plants, which are hazardous
even in the winter, when they
have dropped their leaves. Next
best is to remove the plant oil
from the skin as soon as possible.
If the oil has been on the skin for
less than six hours, thorough
cleansings with a strong soap,
repeated three times, will usually
prevent reaction.

Cowell recommends cold com
presses of Burrows solution, and
ice will also frequently diminish
itching. A hot shower or bath will
also provide some symptomatic
relief. Heat releases histamine,
the substance in the cells of the
skin which causes the intense
