committee under charges of academic misconduct be

part to do things without permission or attribution."
He could be dismissed by the University if the com
mittee finds that he deliberately committed an act of
academic fraud.
The committee's investigation began in mid-February

Robert Williams and published by W.B. Saunders. Mel
mon has also served as an associate editor of the Good
man and Oilman textbook.
Jan Constantine. litigation counsel for MacMillan.
said the company is negotiating with W.B. Saunders to
"get the offending material off the market and bring it
to the attention of the owners of the text."
She said the company "has found no evidence that
permission was requested to print information from our
text in the Williams book."
Melmon said his attorney. Leon Selzer, is talking to
attorneys at MacMillan to work out problems that have
arisen because of the case. /
A spokeswoman for W.B. Saunders said the company
has "absolutely no comment" on the issue.
Melmon said the case began when Williams asked him
in the summer of 1979 to incorporate a chapter from the
Goodman and Gilman text into a chapter Melmon was
writing for Williams' book. Melmon said he balked at
first but agreed to copy the chapter after Williams ob
tained permission from Goodman and Gilman.
Melmon said Williams told him that he had obtained
permission. Melmon then copied the text. Williams died
in November, 1 979.
Melmon said he did not hear anything more about the
issue until he received a call in February, 1954 from an
editor of the Gilman and Goodman text. Editors there
claimed that permission was never asked for or granted
to publish the material in Williams' book.
Melmon told The Daily that he thinks Williams
delegated responsibility for asking for permission to a
subordinate either in his office or in the office of W.B.

Saunders. That subordinate failed to obtain the permis
sion he said.
The Medical School's ethics committee will report in
the next few weeks to University President Donald Ken
nedy. who will then have to decide whether or not to
take disciplinary action against Melmon. according to
Dominick Purpura, the dean of the Medical School and
chairman of the committee.
Jack Friedenthal. a professor at the Law School who
has volunteered to provide counsel lor Melmon. said the
chances of the committee deciding in favor of dismissing
Melmon "are zero. I can't imagine that that could hap
pen."
Friedenthal said Melmon's case in front of the ethics
committee is good because "this was not the appropria
tion of someone's original research or the falsification
of data that would enhance Dr. Melmon s career or pies
tige. Dr. Melmon had absolutely nothing to gain by the
improper use of the materials trom the Goodman and
Oilman book."
Melmon said he has copies ot the original text that
will prove he did not intentially commit academic traud.
"That's the real issue." Friedenthal said. "He may
have been careless, but he certainly was not willtul.
Melmon said he has taken steps to rectify the situa
tion with MacMillan, including preparing an errata sheet,
writing letters of apology to the publishers and the
editors of Oilman and Goodman and offering to turn
over any royalties to the editors.
Melmon said the issue has caused embarrassment tor
him and has "confused" many of his colleagues at the
Medical School.
"The real problem is getting people to understand
that it's a mistake, but it's one that anybody could have
made, and it's possibly one that has been blown out of
proportion," Melmon said.
