## CIS, copters, crowd welcome Mitterrand 
### ADAM GOODMAN Daily staff 
There were no musicians playing
"La Marseillaise," the French na
tional anthem, hut French Presi
dent Francois Mitterrand was
welcomed in grand style when he
visited here last Monday.
He arrived at Stanford about 3
p.m. in an Air Force UHIN
"Huey" helicopter accompanied
hy another "Huey" and three
Army Chinook copters. University
President Donald Kennedy
greeted Mitterrand as he stepped
out of the last helicopter to land
as spectators cheered and ap
plauded. The approximately 100
people who had been awaiting the
landing — the site had been kept
secret by the Secret Service —
were quickly joined by about an
other 100 who had followed the
helicopters.
Mitterrand quickly entered a
waiting black Cadillac Fleetwood
limousine and was wisked away to
the Center for Integrated Sys
tems (CIS) in a caravan of Secret
Service cars and Stanford Police
cruisers and motorcycles.

Secret Service members worked
with the Stanford Police to keep
the visit safe. They swept through
CIS about an hour before Mitter
rand arrived using a Santa Clara
Sheriff Department German
Shepard to search for bombs.
None were found.
At CIS, the unfinished building
was adorned with red, white and
blue French and American flags
overhanging the entrance. Police
roped off the area with yellow
tape that stated "DO NOT
CROSS: SCENE OF CRIME."
Inside, plants were hastily strewn
about to try to cover up the con
struction work still going on. Only
the southwest portion of the
building was used.
About 200 members of the
French and American press were
on hand for the visit. While Mit
terrand met with the Silicon Val
ley experts in a closed seminar
room, reporters watched two
large video screens in a much larger
adjoining room. The Stanford In
structional Television Network
broadcast the event on closed

circuit television for the
reporters, local companies and
guests on hand at Kennedy's
home.
Ihe set-up was not problem
free, however. Since Mitterrand
and the French delegation were
not speaking English, translators
had to be used for both the

panelists and the press. For the
first 20 minutes there was no
translation of the English for the
French press, and then after that
a previously English channel was
suddenly switched to French. Con
fusion broke out in the press room
as American and French jour
nalists jockeyed for position in

front of the speakers.
After the 90-minute briefing,
Mitterrand again travelled by
limousine to the Lou Henry
Hoover House. About 250 guests
were at the Kennedys' home for
the reception. Mitterrand arrived
at 5 p.m. and was greeted by
Jeanne Kennedy. He left 20

minutes later to take a helicopter
back to San Francisco in time for a
speech later that night.
Kennedy said he 1 elt the visit
went well and was impressed with
the French president. "He was in
terested in everything he saw,"
Kennedy said. •'There aren't many
things he didn't have down."


French President Francois Mitterand and his party landed on Roble
Field in three "Fluey" and two Chinook helicopters Three hours

Art Streiber and Rod Searcey/Daily
later, University President Donald Kennedy and his wife Jeanne bid
the president a final farewell (inset).
