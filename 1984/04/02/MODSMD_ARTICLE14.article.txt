The king of Sweden may not have expected that his
visit here would include a group project in making barn
animal noises — especially since his entourage included
some of Sweden's most distinguished researchers and ex
ecutives.
But that's what Stanford provided. And from all ac
counts, the king apparently enjoyed it.
Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf and a 17-mcmber
Royal Technology mission spent March 14 visiting the
University in order to /earn about new trends in tech
nological development.
The visit included a morning session on visual thinking
and creativity, led by Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Robert McKim. McKim opened the session by
demonstrating that the fear of making a fool of oneself
can block creative thinking — so he urged his audience to
pretend to be barn animals in order to free their
creativity.
"It was great." said one of the students present,
junior Benjamin Austin. "All of a sudden here was the
royalty of Sweden making all these farm noises."

After the visitors and the students invited to attend
the morning session obliged by mooing, baaing and carry
ing on, McKim continued with his two-hour program on
visual thinking.
The king and his entourage experienced similar interac
tions with students and faculty throughout the day. The
king's visit began at 9 a.m., when Austin gave the king a
tour of the campus.
"1 was a little bit edgy at the beginning," Austin said
The period he spent waiting for the king to arrive wa
"one of the longest 20 minutes I've ever spent," th
junior said.
But Austin said the chance to show the king the
campus and ride in the royal limousine was a "unique ex
perience for an undergraduate."
"For someone who has never been around royalty
before, that was a pretty important thing," Austin said.
After the tour, the king and his group had breakfast
with Stanford's 10 Nobel laureates and about 20
Swedish students at the University.
