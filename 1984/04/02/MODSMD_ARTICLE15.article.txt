## He's just not the same GI Joe anymore 
### 
Whatever happened to GI Joe? That guy
used to he cool. His beginnings were un
pretentious; he started out as a sort of
Barbie's-boy friend-Ken in uniform. But
every year Joe got better and better. First
they gave him the life-like hair. Then came a
life-like beard which your older brother
could threaten to shave off if he got pissed
at you. Then he got vocal cords. Pull his dog
tag and he talked; he gave his name, rank and
serial number. Next Joe got something called
Kung-fu grip, which didn't do much, but if
David Carradine could pretend he was
Chinese, so could GI Joe. Then he got black.
This was realism in toys.
Well, GI Joe is back, but he's sold out.
He's not even named Jpe anymore. There's a
whole new line of GI Joe coloring books,
"action figures," colorforms and rub-ons,
but none of them have Joe in them. They
didn't think anyone would notice.
I notice, and I don't like it. See, when I was
eight, my Joe had been drafted. He didn't
want to be a soldier, but Selective Service

got him. And he wouldn't kill anyone. He
went AWOL a lot. He was a good toy.
The new Joes which aren't even named Joe
are more like Reagan Youth in Space than
the unwilling anti-heroes the old Joes were.
The caption on my coloring book reads: "A
Real American Hero." The implication is
that these guys are more than imaginary
toys. None of this superman bullshit for the
new Gl Joe. Only fairies wear tights, right?
Right. And you can be damn sure there're no
fairies in this outfit. Just honest-to
goodness Americans who love their country.
Superman was an alien. These guys are true
blue. And they're just like the real army.
The toy makers figure that just like the
real army, this platoon's gonna be integra
ted. Now. integrating the real army would
mean something like letting white people in,
but in toyland it means one person from
everywhere. Accordingly, they've got a black
guy, an Asian guy, and one guy who can be a
Chicano or another black, depending on
who's complaining. They've even got a wo

man. The neat thing about coloring books,
though, is that you can make the soldiers any
color you want. The leader, of course, is
white with a blond crew cut. But I think I m
going to make this army consist solely ot
purple people, so no one gets oftended.
The best part about this regiment is the
soldiers' names. The head, who I tirst
thought was Joe, has been given the more
fitting name, Hawk. Scarier than Mr. I,
huh? Just like the real army, everyone else
has a similarly appropriate nickname.
Nobody's called Roger. Frank or John. I he
guy with a beard is called Rock n' Roll. I he
Chicano is Stalker. The doctor is, you
guessed it. Doc. But their best invention has
to be the title they've given to the muscle
bound Asian.
1 think this guy is a former Viet Cong who
realized the evils of yommunism and
deserted to the U.S. forces so God would let
him into heaven. Anyhow, his Chinese
sounding name is "Gung Ho." That's better

than anything I could have come up with,
like "Won Ton" or "Kamikaze."
What scares me in the coloring book's
story is that even though Hawk and his sub
ordinates race around shooting everything in
sight, there's no enemy. These guys are get
ting trigger-happy. When Hawk suggests
some shooting practice, the ever-eager Gung
Ho shouts, "I'm going first!" and lets loose a
burst of machine-gun fire. The next page
shows a target with four bullet holes in the
bullseye. I guess he missed a lot. But apart
from paper targets and cans, the Gl Joe At
tack Force has nothing to attack.
Oh, sure, there's some guy with a mask
called the Cobra Commander, but who the
hell is he commanding? What's behind the
mask? Is he a godless communist, or is he the
upstart military ruler of some tiny Central
American nation? Or does the toy company
just expect the kids to fill in the face with
whomever we're lighting this week? Is the
Cobra Commander Chernenko? 1 really want

to know.
I hose Cil Joes arc telling us we're prepared
to light. Win) cares il there's no enemy, the
army's an admirable institution, honorable
even in peace time. But it there's someone
to fight, it's even better. And there's no
reason to worry it men like Hawk are leading
us. We're sure to win. See. nobody dies in the
coloring book. Except the faceless enemies.
Nobody even gets wounded, apart from the
woman, Scarlett, who presumably broke a
nail or something. But that's okay, because
Doc is there to take care of her. and we are
treated to this poignant exchange which
teaches kids both excellent grammar and
how much women really need men:
"Let me bandage you up, Scarlett."
"Thanks Doc, you're the greatest."
Toys aren't what they used to be.

Whatever happened to GI Joe? That guy
used to he cool. His beginnings were un
pretentious; he started out as a sort of
Barbie's-boy friend-Ken in uniform. But
every year Joe got better and better. First
they gave him the life-like hair. Then came a
life-like beard which your older brother
could threaten to shave off if he got pissed
at you. Then he got vocal cords. Pull his dog
tag and he talked; he gave his name, rank and
serial number. Next Joe got something called
Kung-fu grip, which didn't do much, but if
David Carradine could pretend he was
Chinese, so could GI Joe. Then he got black.
This was realism in toys.
Well, GI Joe is back, but he's sold out.
He's not even named Jpe anymore. There's a
whole new line of GI Joe coloring books,
"action figures," colorforms and rub-ons,
but none of them have Joe in them. They
didn't think anyone would notice.
I notice, and I don't like it. See, when I was
eight, my Joe had been drafted. He didn't
want to be a soldier, but Selective Service

got him. And he wouldn't kill anyone. He
went AWOL a lot. He was a good toy.
The new Joes which aren't even named Joe
are more like Reagan Youth in Space than
the unwilling anti-heroes the old Joes were.
The caption on my coloring book reads: "A
Real American Hero." The implication is
that these guys are more than imaginary
toys. None of this superman bullshit for the
new Gl Joe. Only fairies wear tights, right?
Right. And you can be damn sure there're no
fairies in this outfit. Just honest-to
goodness Americans who love their country.
Superman was an alien. These guys are true
blue. And they're just like the real army.
The toy makers figure that just like the
real army, this platoon's gonna be integra
ted. Now. integrating the real army would
mean something like letting white people in,
but in toyland it means one person from
everywhere. Accordingly, they've got a black
guy, an Asian guy, and one guy who can be a
Chicano or another black, depending on
who's complaining. They've even got a wo

man. The neat thing about coloring books,
though, is that you can make the soldiers any
color you want. The leader, of course, is
white with a blond crew cut. But I think I m
going to make this army consist solely ot
purple people, so no one gets oftended.
The best part about this regiment is the
soldiers' names. The head, who I tirst
thought was Joe, has been given the more
fitting name, Hawk. Scarier than Mr. I,
huh? Just like the real army, everyone else
has a similarly appropriate nickname.
Nobody's called Roger. Frank or John. I he
guy with a beard is called Rock n' Roll. I he
Chicano is Stalker. The doctor is, you
guessed it. Doc. But their best invention has
to be the title they've given to the muscle
bound Asian.
1 think this guy is a former Viet Cong who
realized the evils of yommunism and
deserted to the U.S. forces so God would let
him into heaven. Anyhow, his Chinese
sounding name is "Gung Ho." That's better

than anything I could have come up with,
like "Won Ton" or "Kamikaze."
What scares me in the coloring book's
story is that even though Hawk and his sub
ordinates race around shooting everything in
sight, there's no enemy. These guys are get
ting trigger-happy. When Hawk suggests
some shooting practice, the ever-eager Gung
Ho shouts, "I'm going first!" and lets loose a
burst of machine-gun fire. The next page
shows a target with four bullet holes in the
bullseye. I guess he missed a lot. But apart
from paper targets and cans, the Gl Joe At
tack Force has nothing to attack.
Oh, sure, there's some guy with a mask
called the Cobra Commander, but who the
hell is he commanding? What's behind the
mask? Is he a godless communist, or is he the
upstart military ruler of some tiny Central
American nation? Or does the toy company
just expect the kids to fill in the face with
whomever we're lighting this week? Is the
Cobra Commander Chernenko? 1 really want

to know.
I hose Cil Joes arc telling us we're prepared
to light. Win) cares il there's no enemy, the
army's an admirable institution, honorable
even in peace time. But it there's someone
to fight, it's even better. And there's no
reason to worry it men like Hawk are leading
us. We're sure to win. See. nobody dies in the
coloring book. Except the faceless enemies.
Nobody even gets wounded, apart from the
woman, Scarlett, who presumably broke a
nail or something. But that's okay, because
Doc is there to take care of her. and we are
treated to this poignant exchange which
teaches kids both excellent grammar and
how much women really need men:
"Let me bandage you up, Scarlett."
"Thanks Doc, you're the greatest."
