## Growing up straight in a gay world 
### 
His parents sat together stiffly on the
couch, facing him. The worried expression on
Jim's face was enough to tell them that some
thing was dreadfully wrong. He began
hesitantly.
"I've wanted to tell you this for a long time.
I just don't know how to. Before 1 begin. 1 just
want to let you know that 1 love you both very
much. It's just that

VIEWPOINT

He stopped at that point, unable to go on,
bowing his head to hide the tears which
threatened to force their way out of his eyes
and run down his face. The tension increased as
his parents looked at each other, concern
darkening their faces. What was it that was so
terrible that their son couldn't even talk about
it? They gripped each other's hands tightly,
preparing for the worst. Rejection from his
chosen university? Expulsion from school? In
volvement with drugs? Their imaginations ran
wild. Jim finally raised his bowed head and in
one breath let it all out.
"I'm straight."
Stunned silence greeted his announcement.
He glanced from one father to the other.
Nothing but shock registered on their faces.
No one moved.

"I'm straight." Jim repeated, as if that
would help bring his parents out of their state
of shock. "That's all there is to it. I'm straight.
I like girls."
His parents reacted almost stereotypically.
His father Craig continued to sit in what ap
peared to be stunned silence, while his other
father George gasped, then put his hand to his
heart.
"Oh my God!" he exclaimed. And then, as if
an afterthought, "Are you sure?"
Jim might have laughed if the situation
hadn't been so serious. What an absurd ques
tion! Of course he was sure, and had been sure
since the age of 13. There was no questioning
his attraction for girls. While his father Craig
sat in mute silence, George spoke up again.
"But Jim. have you given any thought to
what this means? 1 mean a ... a ... a hetero
sexual." He could barely bring himself to say
the distasteful word. Then in a hushed voice,
"I've heard stories about those kind of
people."
Before Jim could respond to that state
ment, his father Craig found his voice. His
anger was barely controlled.
"Just what are you trying to do to us young
man? What are we supposed to tell our
friends? And how will we be able to hold our

heads up in church? And have you thought
about your grandparents? Think of what this
will do to them!"
Jim looked askance at his parents. He had
planned the moment, but he hadn't an
ticipated the negative reaction he was receiv
ing. Some of his straight friends told him that
this would happen, but he chose to ignore
them, thinking that his parents would be dif
ferent. He was on the verge of crying again
when George spoke up.
"Craig, don't be so harsh on the boy. Listen,
I'm sure it's just a phase he's going through.
Why, there must be a doctor he can go to for
help. Yes, that's it! Jim, honey, we'll get you to
the best doctor in town. Don't you worry, we'll
get you cured no matter what the cost."
"NO, NO you don't understand. There's
nothing wrong with being straight. I've met
lots of straight people who are really proud of
being straight. They're not ashamed or hiding
in closets or anything."
George was Visibly taken aback at this dis
closure. "You mean you've been hanging
around with breeders? Oh my God, Craig, our
son has actually been hanging around with
breeders."
"Well that explains it. No wonder he's
turned into one," exclaimed Craig. "Probably

some older breeder seduced you, is that it?
They're always going after younger people.
Well, no son of mine is going to be straight!
You're grounded . . . until you straighten qut
your way of thinking. You're not to see any of
your breeder friends. And I don't want you
talking to them on the phone, either. Now go
to your room. Your father and I have to discuss
this. I want to think about the shame and dis
grace you're causing us. Not a word! Just go to
your room!"
Jini turned away quickly so his parents
wouldn't see the tears that were already cours
ing down his cheeks. He stumbled upstairs to
his room, throwing himself on his bed. Even
though his pariyits hadn't even tried to under
stand, and no matter what the outcome of
today's revelation, Jim was glad he had told
them. 11 nothing else, it had changed one
thing. No more dishonesty and no more lying —
about the places he'd been or the people he's
been with. He smiled through his tears as he
thought ot this. One thing hadn't changed
though. He was straight and he knew it — had
known it tor a long time. And nothing that so
ciety said or did and nothing that his parents
could say or do would ever change that.

his parents looked at each other, concern
darkening their faces. What was it that was so
terrible that their son couldn't even talk about
it? They gripped each other's hands tightly,
preparing for the worst. Rejection from his
chosen university? Expulsion from school? In
volvement with drugs? Their imaginations ran
wild. Jim finally raised his bowed head and in
one breath let it all out.
"I'm straight."
Stunned silence greeted his announcement.
He glanced from one father to the other.
Nothing but shock registered on their faces.
No one moved.

"I'm straight." Jim repeated, as if that
would help bring his parents out of their state
of shock. "That's all there is to it. I'm straight.
I like girls."
His parents reacted almost stereotypically.
His father Craig continued to sit in what ap
peared to be stunned silence, while his other
father George gasped, then put his hand to his
heart.
"Oh my God!" he exclaimed. And then, as if
an afterthought, "Are you sure?"
Jim might have laughed if the situation
hadn't been so serious. What an absurd ques
tion! Of course he was sure, and had been sure
since the age of 13. There was no questioning
his attraction for girls. While his father Craig
sat in mute silence, George spoke up again.
"But Jim. have you given any thought to
what this means? 1 mean a ... a ... a hetero
sexual." He could barely bring himself to say
the distasteful word. Then in a hushed voice,
"I've heard stories about those kind of
people."
Before Jim could respond to that state
ment, his father Craig found his voice. His
anger was barely controlled.
"Just what are you trying to do to us young
man? What are we supposed to tell our
friends? And how will we be able to hold our

heads up in church? And have you thought
about your grandparents? Think of what this
will do to them!"
Jim looked askance at his parents. He had
planned the moment, but he hadn't an
ticipated the negative reaction he was receiv
ing. Some of his straight friends told him that
this would happen, but he chose to ignore
them, thinking that his parents would be dif
ferent. He was on the verge of crying again
when George spoke up.
"Craig, don't be so harsh on the boy. Listen,
I'm sure it's just a phase he's going through.
Why, there must be a doctor he can go to for
help. Yes, that's it! Jim, honey, we'll get you to
the best doctor in town. Don't you worry, we'll
get you cured no matter what the cost."
"NO, NO you don't understand. There's
nothing wrong with being straight. I've met
lots of straight people who are really proud of
being straight. They're not ashamed or hiding
in closets or anything."
George was Visibly taken aback at this dis
closure. "You mean you've been hanging
around with breeders? Oh my God, Craig, our
son has actually been hanging around with
breeders."
"Well that explains it. No wonder he's
turned into one," exclaimed Craig. "Probably

some older breeder seduced you, is that it?
They're always going after younger people.
Well, no son of mine is going to be straight!
You're grounded . . . until you straighten qut
your way of thinking. You're not to see any of
your breeder friends. And I don't want you
talking to them on the phone, either. Now go
to your room. Your father and I have to discuss
this. I want to think about the shame and dis
grace you're causing us. Not a word! Just go to
your room!"
Jini turned away quickly so his parents
wouldn't see the tears that were already cours
ing down his cheeks. He stumbled upstairs to
his room, throwing himself on his bed. Even
though his pariyits hadn't even tried to under
stand, and no matter what the outcome of
today's revelation, Jim was glad he had told
them. 11 nothing else, it had changed one
thing. No more dishonesty and no more lying —
about the places he'd been or the people he's
been with. He smiled through his tears as he
thought ot this. One thing hadn't changed
though. He was straight and he knew it — had
known it tor a long time. And nothing that so
ciety said or did and nothing that his parents
could say or do would ever change that.
