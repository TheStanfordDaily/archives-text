## Hart's time has arrived 
### 
The baby-boomers. A generation
of Americans who grew up in the
most explosive decades ot this na
tion's history. A generation that
was divided, decimated and
demoralized by the Vietnam War,
marched for peace and George
McGovern and watched Richard
Nixon destroy the presidency.
The baby-boomers retreated to
the classrooms and offices to heal
wounds and await their day. They
have returned to the political scene
and Sen. Gary Hart is the man in the
right place at the right time with
the right ideas.
The established Democratic Party
leadership is fearful ot Gary Hart s
possible nomination. Already there
is talk of dumping Walter Mondale
and drafting Ted Kennedy as a com
promise candidate.
Plan as they may we will not be
denied again. This is our world, our
country and our time.
