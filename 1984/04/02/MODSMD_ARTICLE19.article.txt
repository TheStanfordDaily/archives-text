## Jackson: America's only real alternative 
### 
Jesse Jackson's candidacy is more than sym
bolic. It is refreshing, uplifting, human, brave and
to the point. It is also angry, stubborn and deter
mined. No other candidates, who laud themselves
as "alternatives" to President Reagan, dare to
challenge Reagan on a moral and ideological level,
as well as defend the rights of millions of politi
cally voiceless, i.e. oppressed, Americans.

VIEWPOINT

This 19X4 election year finds us dealing with a
Reaganismo America:
• Military expenditures have skyrocketed
(wonder where the money came from . . .)
• Social programs of every kind have been cut
in proportionally drastic amounts (wonder where
the money went . ..)
• The federal budget deficit is the largest in
history.
• Unemployment increased to an all-time
post-depression high and then only gradually
tapered off to a whopping 8 percent. Black un
employment is twice this figure, black youth un
employment is 50 percent and that of Latinos is
11 percent.
• Women still earn only 57 cents for every dol
lar earned by a man. (This figure is actually worse
than it was 10 years ago.)
• 40 percent of black families live below the
poverty level.
• Reagan has unabashedly attacked the major
civil rights gains of the 19605. Most notably, he
has attempted to fire liberal members of the
Civil Rights Commission, has cut back on affirm

ative action programs and has proposed tax
exempt status for schools that discriminate.
• Reagan's foreign policy is characterized by
gunboat diplomacy and military adventurism —
we have troops "keeping the peace" in the
Middle East, Central America and the Carib
bean. He has reversed all progress in arms control
negotiations, heightened world tension, and
damaged international respect for America,
while supporting Marcos in the Philippines, the
death squads in El Salvador and the fascist,
white supremacist regime in South Africa.
In short, we are faced with a powerful,
"charismatic," and influential president who, in
the words of Jackson supporter Barry Com
moner, believes that "the interest of this
country is best served by having the rich get rich
er and that in dealing with countries we disagree
with we should use force and the threat of
force."
Jesse Jackson is the only one "in the ring" with
Reagan. He does more than address the issues —
he brings up critical problems otherwise washed
over by other candidates, problems engrained in
American society and yet too easily kept silent
and invisible by our leaders.
His top campaign issue is vigorous enforcement
of the Voting Rights Act "because it is the key
to empowerment." He sees full employment and
functional job training as the critical basis for
any progressive economic and political change.
This necessarily flips over Reagan's "trickle
down" theory.
He also criticizes the Reagan tax break as
having overwhelmingly benefitted corporations

and the wealthy. "Rather than reindustriali/.e,
re-educate, and retrain workers, (corporations)
use money to engage in record mergers, replace
workers with machines, and ship American jobs
to cheap labor markets abroad." Jackson would
instead use tax breaks to reindustriali/.e America
and rebuild its cities.
Internationally, Jackson severely criticizes
Reagan's gunboat diplomacy, particularly oppos
ing the president's actions in Central America,
Grenada and Lebanon. And, as an outspoken and
steadfast believer in peace and cooperation,
Jackson is committed to an aggressive rejuvena
tion of the arms reduction process — "we must
be willing to take some risks for peace."
There is a humanistic, moral tone to the Jack
son campaign. Jackson is not afraid to cut
through the rhetoric endemic to American elec
toral politics and ask the "unpopular" questions.
"Why do our poor keep getting poorer?" "Why
do we still tolerate racism?" and "Why can't we
talk instead of sending troops?"
Many voters scoff at Jackson "because he
can't win." In a forum in lowa, George McGovern
called for all people to "vote their conscience,"
not just vote for the candidate most likely
(according to the polls) to win. If we all heed his
advice, our views can at least serve as a mandate
to the Democratic nominee and to the party
platform. Indeed, neither Mondale nor Hart can
win in November unless he faces the issues
brought forth by all those Jacksons and
McGoverns.
