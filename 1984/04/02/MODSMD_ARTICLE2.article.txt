# April 9 date for Streleski
## Killer's parole hearing set 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Yet another chapter in the saga of Theodore Streleski
and Stanford University will commence April 9, at which
time a parole revocation hearing is scheduled for the 47-
â€¢year-old convicted killer.
A two-person panel from the Board of Prison Terms
will decide that afternoon whether Streleski violated his
parole conditions on March 8 and, if so, whether he
should be reincarcerated.
Streleski, the murderer of Mathematics Prof. Karel
del.eeuw, was paroled last month after serving five-and
one-half years of his eight-year sentence, but was
returned to prison just three hours after his release
when he indicated that he would not honor his parole
regulations.
If the board determines next week that Streleski's
threats constitute a parole violation, Streleski could
remain in jail for a maximum of six months. He would
then be re-released unless the board found reason to
keep him in prison. But in 18 months, Streleski must be
unconditionally discharged, meaning he will then be a
free man, not a parolee, and will thus be allowed to
reside in the Bay Area.
If the board decides that Streleski did not violate his
parole, he will be released on parole following the revoca
tion hearing.
Streleski has been granted his request for an attorney
to represent him at his hearing. A parole agent from the
State Department of Corrections will be representing
the state.
Streleski told reporters on March 8 that he was
"uncomfortable with the conditions" of his parole, spe
cifically the stipulation prohibiting him from returning
to the Bay Area, a condition he attributed to "pressure"
from officials at Stanford. "Stanford got all over the
attorney general," he said.
Streleski said he felt Stanford would have thwarted
him a second time if he had agreed to his parole regula
tion forcing him to live in Orange County. So he elected

to remain in prison until he could be unconditionally
released.
"The practical justification is that I committed mur
der to make a statement against Stanford," he said. "I

undercut that statement if I go back on it in any way, it
I say, 'Gee, I'm sorry,' and all that sort of thiflg. ... 1
don't want to do anything that says 1 didn't mean it. 1
meant it."
Streleski said he resented Stanford for blocking his
19-year quest to earn a doctorate in mathematics and
that he killed deLeeuw to make a statement about the
way Stanford treats its graduate students.
At his March 8 press conference outside of the State-
Medical Facility at Vacaville, where he is currently being
held, he refused to promise that if released, he would
not return to Stanford.
