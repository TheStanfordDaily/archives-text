## Kennedy to enter Senate race

San Francisco — University President Donald
Kennedy today will officially enter the Democratic
primary race for the U.S. Senate.
"I am joining the contest and expect to win the
Senate seat," Kennedy told a cheering crowd of
150 campaign supporters in a Nob Hill Hotel con
ference room last night.
Kennedy asserted that he had the backing of the
current Democratic frontrunner, Gov. Jerry
Brown, who plans to drop out of the race.
"I appreciate the Governor's support and in turn
favor his bid for whatever position he seeks," said
Kennedy. Brown could not be reached for com
ment.
Brown won several Democratic presidential pri
maries in 1976 and has been mentioned repeatedly
as a contender for the 1984 Democratic nomi
nation.
The disputed Senate seat is currently held by S.I.
Hayakawa, who is not seeking re-election.
As part of Kennedy's emphasis on Stanford sup
port during his bid, the Daily received a special in
vitation to the private campaign kick-off speech.
Kennedy addressed many of his central cam
paign issues. "Ronald Reagan's election was a
mandate only for responsible government — not
for economic disaster, not for social callousness,
not for foreign adventurism."

Kennedy's pledge to "reverse policies for the
rich that help no American — rich or poor'
brought the crowd to its feet as a string quartet
broke into a chorus of "Happy Days are Here
Again."
Predictably, Kennedy stressed educational fund
ing. "The West, especially California, is the land of
the future. Rather than strip education budgets,
the federal government should direct funds not to
the military but rather to the West's private, presti
gious universities."
Barry Goldwater, Jr. leads the Republican nomi
nation race, but Kennedy scoffed at his opposition.
"For a Senator, extremism in the defense of any
thing is still a vice. No Kennedy has ever had prob
lems outpolling a Goldwater."
Kennedy promised to provide a new moral vi
sion. "This is a new frontier of unfulfilled hopes
and threats... it is a time to pay any price, bear any
burden, meet any hardship to ensure just policies
and my election."
Many of the University's top administrators form
the nucleus of Kennedy's campaign staff. Larry
Horton and Bob Rosenzweig, for example, will
direct campaign strategy. Faculty members from
the political science dept. have pledged to draft
position papers and speeches.
"We will draw on the legal and business ex
pertise of Stanford alumni throughout the state
and nation. The political apparatus, notto mention

support, is already intact," said Horton, who added
that the campaign was also banking on student
help.
Horton said he hoped to see "a lot" of campaign
booths in White Plaza.
University News and Publications will be re
sponsible for a public relations campaign that a Bay
Area political correspondent said is the most high
ly developed of any candidate's media effort.
Much of Kennedy's campaign war chest— esti
mated at nearly $900,000 — has been drawn from
alumni solicitation and from a group of Kennedy
supporters in the Boston area.
Kennedy aids showed poll results compiled by
the statistics dept. that placed Kennedy 12.274 per
centage points behind Goldwater and nearly even
with Republican Senate hopeful Paul "Pete" Mc-
Closkey, with the majority of voters undecided.
"Name recognition is Kennedy's principal prob
lem."said a University analyst.
Administrators claimed that Kennedy's Senate
bid would only help the University. Kennedy assis
tant Bob Hamrdla said, "Kennedy has met daily
with the most influential business and political
leaders of the state — and that will continue. Only
the tone of his conversations will change."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons said, "the
campaign will help the students most of all. Where
else can thousands of bright Stanford students gain
this type of political experience?"
