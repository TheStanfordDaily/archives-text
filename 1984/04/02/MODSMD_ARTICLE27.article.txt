# Crossing with the best
## Local kids are trained by Stanford's finest 
### NANETTE ARCHER 
For students at Nixon
Elementary School, volunteer
ing for the safety patrol is no
longer a trivial matter. Now, in
a new program recently in
itiated with the help of the
Stanford Police Department,
the role of the student cross
ing guards has come to have
much more significance.
Young, upper-grade volun
teers — selected after obtain
ing parental permission and
teacher approval — are cur
rently attending meetings
where officers detail the re
sponsibilities of the job and
provide additional instruction
for new procedures. Dan
Smith, head of Special Services
for the Stanford Police, is in
charge of setting up these ses
sions.
These young people arrive at
their designated posts on
various street corners sur
rounding the campus before

and after school to facilitate
safe crossing for all students.
In the words of sixth grade
patroller Miles Efron, "We
help the kids across the street
and watch that they don't get
squished."
Both he and classmate
Janelle Wang acknowledge the
difference the police assistance
makes. "Now we wear a white
belt strap, too — before we
just had plastic caps," said
Wang. "And now we give out
blue slips."
These blue slips are citations
for students who disregard the
regular crossing rules and
procedures. They are filled out
by the safety patrollers and
given to the student's teacher.
Members of the patrol are
also being trained to take down
license plate numbers and des
criptions of cars that violate
traffic laws and submit them
to the police officers.
Above all, the police have

stressed the importance of me
role of the safety patrol.
Patroller Efron says that, pridr
to the beginning of these new
training sessions, "I used to
think we didn't do that much*."
Now students are given mftre
responsibility and also made
aware of the value of their par
ticipation.
"It provides status for tlfe
safety patrol job," says
Oswald, principal of Nixon. *
Oswald is extremely enthusi
astic about the program which
she says is only one facet of the
increased, overall involvement
of the Stanford Police and the
Department of Public Safety
in the school's activities.
Stanford Police Officer Del
Bandy, who headed Nixon's
training program, also ex
pressed satisfaction with the
students' participation. "It
really went well," he said. "The
kids were enthusiastic and in
terested in what 1 wanted to
tell them — 1 was impressed."
