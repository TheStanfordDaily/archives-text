## 'Entre Nous' cautious to make it as a sisterhood movie 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The first half hour of Entre
Nous, set in France during the
Second World War. juxtaposes
the lives of two young women,
Lena (Isabelle Huppert) and
Madeleine (Miou-Miou). Lena,
a Belgian Jew. is confined to an
interment camp in the French
Pyrenees until a French
Legionnaire. Michel (Guy Mar
chand), offers to marr> her and
take her out with him. But he
turns out to be a Jew. too, and
as the Nazi stranglehold
tightens. Lena and Michel
escape into Italy. Madeleine
and her new husband are art
students; when their teacher is
arrested by the Gestapo, the
student body of the academy
stages a protest, some of them
open fire on the guards, and in
the resulting chaos Madeleine's
husband is shot to death in her
arms.
This long prefatory section
— for the rest of the story
begins in 1952, at Lyon, and
concerns the friendship be
tween the two women — es
tablishes two characteristics of
the director, Diane Kurys.
First, these scenes of war and
revolt, escape and liberation
have a deju vu quality: They
don't call up any specific films,
but like the war sequences in
Claude Lelouch's Bolero of a
couple of years ago, their
source seems to be old movies
generally — there's hardly a
sentiment or an action you feel
sure you're seeing for the first
time. Second. Kurys shows a
penchant for the cute mo
ment, the jokey reversal —

Lena learning during the wed
ding ceremony that Michel's
real name is so blatantly Jewish
that far from guaranteeing her
freedom, marriage endangers
her safety more than ever;
Madeleine and a young man
emerging from church as man
and wile minutes after we've
seen him sneaking out of her
bed at her parents house: the
news of the approaching Ger
mans delivered to the wedding
party just before they freeze
into a pained smile for a photo
graph. The combination of
these two tendencies — a
reliance on stock ideas and a
preference for the tiny joke —
trivializes the life-and-death
situations kur\s and her co
screenwriter, Alain Le Henry,
present.
Since we know from the ads
and the trailers that Lena and
Madeleine will meet and form a
bond, we assume that Kurys
has included all this background
material in order to give us a
perspective on the two women
that will explain both what
they turn into and what draws
them together. But in fact,
the only pertinent fact the
first half hour supplies, we dis
cover, is that Lena and Michel,
thrown into marriage by chance
and expediency, are not well
suited and have inevitably
grown indifferent to each
other. Madeleine is remarried
now, to a part-time actor and
get-rich-quick schemer, Costa
(Jean-Pierre Bacri), who got
her pregnant after the war; she
has a Tittle boy and Lena has

two girls. And the women
become acquainted, as any
other two might, after a per
formance at the school their
kids attend. Their relationship
is immediately a strong and in

timate one, but if Kurys knows
the reason why these two 30ish
women, who appear to have no
other friends, decide to reach
out to each other, she keeps it
to herself. An aura of mystery

surrounds this friendship from
the start and never dissipates.
The prospect of a film about
women in a relationship told
from a woman's point of view
is a promising one. but Diane
Kur\s can't manage to shake
her ties to the Hollywood of
the big-studio era or transcend
her situation-comedy sen
sibility. Entre Nous is the most
solidly bourgeois comedy
drama I've seen since The Four
Seasons, though it's nowhere
near as smarmy and it's much
better made. Madeleine and
Lena exchange confidences on
a couch by a window on a snowy
day; this is the kind of pictur
esque composition that any
studio-trained hack in the
1940s could have set lip in his
sleep. The two families, driving
home from a picnic in the
country, race down the road
until Madeleine's little boy
gets sick to his stomach: Costa
gets a fantastic deal on an ille
gal shipment of American
shirts, but they all turn out to
be missing one sleeve; a
birthday cake catches fire at a
party for one of the children:
and so on — and with each of
these tiresome skits the movie
reduces our expectations, and
reduces itself too, until it is a
very small thing indeed. And
with this pair of stultifyingly
middle-class families as her cast
of characters, Kurys attempts
to tell her story true one.
in which Lena and Michel are
cinematic versions of her own
parents — of a friendship that
outweighed and outlasted both
women's marriages. Madeleine

and Costa quarrel, and she
leaves him and moves to Paris:
Lena, lying to Michel about
where she's going, joins her for
a vacation and they make plans
to open a boutique together.
(It's the last in an elaborate
set of lies begun out of neces
sity. so that Michel, having
loaned Costa money for his
American shirt business, can
get it back without learning
lie's been swindled.) But Michel
finds out where Lena has gone
and accuses her of carrying on a
love affair with Madeleine.
If Madeleine and Lena really
were lovers, the film might
have some resonance. Maybe
Kurys is afraid that suggesting a
sexual connection between the
two women would make them
less sympathetic, or maybe —
and this is more likely — she is
too close to the characters to
want to risk exposing them to
scandal. As a result, her depic
tion' of the friendship lacks the
courage that would make it
worth thinking about. The two
protagonists talk about sex.
they admire each other's
breasts, they even share a bed
at one point — but in each case
Kurys cuts away before we
have an opportunity to see any
sensual stirrings in either of
them. And Miou-Miou's
enclosed, restrained perfor
mance doesn't help — we never
understand what's going on
inside Madeleine, and we never
see any evidence of her offer
ing the kind of emotional sup
port Lena claims to get from
her. Isabelle Huppert's acting is
proficient, nicely detailed and

unexciting, though 1 don't
think she can be blamed for the
limitations of her perfor
mance: she takes it about as
far as the constraints of the
script and the direction will al
low.
This really is the damnedest
movie. Kurys wants us to un
derstand how close two women
can be. yet she never indicates
what might make them close,
and she shuts off the one dra
matic possibility she has to
provide an explanation. Of
course I'm not suggesting that
a movie that revolves around a
pair of women can't be inter
esting unless they sleep to
gether, or (more ludicrously)
that, like Michel, I believe that
women who are so intimate
must be lovers. It's just that
the alternative Entre Nous of
fers is so banal, so fruitless
emotionally and dramatically
— and so self-congratulatory.
Lena and Madeleine hack each
other up whenever one of them
rebels against her husband;
when Lena, dressing for an eve
ning out. puts on a tight black
dress borrowed from
Madeleine, Michel tells her she
looks like a whore and he won't
be seen with her, so she leaves
without him. When I saw the
film, some women in the audi
ence applauded this scene, but
frankly I couldn't see much dif
ference between it and some
episodes of I Love Lucy in
which Lucy and Ethel conspire
to get the best of their
fatuous, narrow-minded
hubbies. Entre Nous is a sister
hood movie of a very low order.
