## Swimmers set the pace, but don't get titles Men get five but slip to third 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's swimming
team headed into the NCAA
Swimming and Diving Cham
pionships Mareh 22-24 favored
to win the national champion
ship. The Cardinal had been
ranked No. I all year, hut faced
tough challenges from Florida
and Texas as well as outside
threats from UCLA and
Southern Methodist.
Those challengers proved to
be too much. When the points
were all totaled last Saturday
night, the Card saw itself sit
ting in third place with 201
points, behind Florida with
287.5 and Texas with 277.
Can you really term a third
place finish at a meet like this
disappointing, though? Stan
ford Head Coach Skip Kenney
certainly thought not. "I'm
not disappointed at all," he
said. "We had a great meet."
That point could not be
disputed. The Cardinal
captured five individual titles,
more than any other school,
and got some outstanding per
formances that very well could
have won.
Leading the way was fresh
man Pablo Morales. The but
terfly specialist pulled off a
double victory in that stroke,
winning both the 100-yard and
200-yard events, setting an
American record of 47.02
seconds in the 100 and a
Cleveland State pool record of
1:44.33 in the 200. Morales
added a fourth-place finish in
the 200-yard individual medley
and anchored the seventh-place
400-yard freestyle relay.
Morales was almost remem
bered for a race he didn't win,
however. In the Friday after
noon preliminaries in the 400-
yard medley relay. Morales
swam the butterfly leg on
what appeared to be an Ameri
can record-setting effort. The
judges, however, ruled that
Morales had left the block a
fraction of a second before
sophomore John Moffet
reached the wall, and the relay
jleam was disqualified.
£L The mishap cost the Cardinal
a possible 32 points for winning
the relay, and for a while it ap
peared it may have cost Stan
ford the championship. It later
proved to have no effect on
the outcome, though, and
Morales atoned for the
mistake by winning the 100
butterfly that evening.
After the win. Morales
faced a barrage of questions on
the relay mishap. "It's one of
those things," he said. "You
can work on relay starts until
the end of time. It's a matter
of inches. There's a fine line
between false starting and get
ting a good start, and ap
parently I crossed that line."
In the 100 butterfly Morales
trailed UCLA's Tom Jager by a
quarter-second after 50 yards,
but he came on to defeat Jager

by a full second. "I was hoping
if I could win I could hopefully
transfer some enthusiasm to
the rest of the team, " Morales
said. "We felt it was important
to get the ball rolling and show
the other teams that we were
in it."
In the 200 butterfly Morales
led the entire way, but Ricardo
Prado of Southern Methodist
and Chris Rives of Texas closed
hard in the last 50 yards as
Morales hung on to win by a
tenth of a second. Morales
said, "I saw him (Prado) and
telt his splashes coming on. I
just put my head down and
went."
Morales said he didn't expect
to win the double. "It was a
pleasant surprise," he said.
Stanford's other double win
ner was Moffet. The
breaststroker captured the
100-yard and 200-yard versions
of that event, breaking pool
records in both — 54.38
seconds in the 100 and 1:57.99
in the 200.
In the 100, Moffet was in
second place after 50 yards
but came on to beat Chris
Weissman of SMU by .25
seconds. In the longer event
Moffet was in third for most
of the race but closed strong
in the last 25 yards to edge
Doug Soltis of Florida by .09
seconds. Teammate David
Lundberg, a sophomore,
finished ninth in that race.
"It's what I wanted," Mof
fet replied when asked about
the double. "My first goal was
to win both races, and my
second was to swim my best
times." He did so in the 100,
but not the 200.
Freshman Jeff Kostoff
captured the Cardinal's other
individual crown. The freestyle
distance specialist shattered
the American record in the
1650-yard freestyle with a
time of 14:38.22, chopping
over eight seconds off his pre
vious U.S. mark.
That race was a duel between
Kostoff and Arizona's George
DiCarlo, both trading the lead,
and neither trailing by more
than a second throughout the
66 lengths of the 25-yard pool.
Kostoff took the lead for
good at the 1250-yard mark
and bested-DiCarlo by only .51
seconds, while the nearest chal
lenger was over 17 seconds off
their pace. Stanford's Dave
Sims finished fourth in the
event.
The win came after a pair of
frustrating losses for Kostoff,
and he was relieved to win it,
remarking, "I needed that one,"
afterward. In the 500-yard
freestyle Kostoff finished
over three seconds behind
DiCarlo as the Wildcat swim
mer broke Kostoffs American
record in the event.
Kostoff also lost the 400-
vard individual medley, despite

Sophomore John Moffet (top), junior Marybeth Linzmeier (middle) and freshman Pablo
Morales turned in a plethora of excellent performances, but their efforts still couldn't garner
a title for the women's or men's team. Moffet swept the 100 and the 200 breaststroke, while
Morales did the same in the butterfly. Linzmeier had the most impressive performance,
sweeping the 200, 500 and 1650 freestyle events.
