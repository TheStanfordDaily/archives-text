## President Mitterrand sees a byte of Silicon Valley 
### ADAM GOODMAN Daily staff 
French President Francois Mit
terrand brought his high
technology questions to Stanford
last week and sought out answers
from some of Silicon Valley's
leading experts.
In a 90-minute briefing session
at the unfinished Center for Inte
grated Systems (CIS) last Mon
day, University President Donald
Kennedy and 13 local representa
tives — professors, administra
tors, industrialists and venture
capitalists — talked with Mitter
rand about the future of high
technology research in
microelectronics and biotechnol
ogy. The session was a part of
Mitterrand's week-long visit to
the United States which also in
cluded stops in San Francisco and
Berkeley.
The socialist president has
shown great interest in the future
of research and in increasing
French participation in the high
tech field. Mitterrand has risked
earmarking substantial govern
ment funding toward research
during the current recession in
which the French gross national
product has dropped 3 percent.
"It is a fact that most of the
enthusiasm (for research) comes
from the state . . . What we have
done is opt for research as a
priority issue," he said in his CIS
briefing.
The top issue of the discussion
at Stanford was funding. Mitter
rand showed interest in finding
out about the inner workings of
obtaining research funds.
Panelists. discussed both
governmental and industrial fun
ding of research.
"Basic research supported by
the government may not stretch
far enough," said Kennedy, who
also noted that the University
receives more than $100 million

per year in sponsored research
funding exclusive of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center. Ken
nedy estimated that only 5 per
cent of that money comes from
industry, the rest from federal
funds.
Nobel laureate and Chemistry
Prof. Paul Berg said he worries
that basic research for biotech
nology may be in trouble. "We run
the risk of underfunding, under
supporting that kind of research
in the future," he said, emphasiz
ing that industrial funds need to
be diverted away from research
toward a specific product and
toward fundamental studies.
Mitterrand said he was sup
ported future research. "We will
find that what has been done
shows that we are willing to go
much further," he said. "There is
going to be a serious revolution.
"It is my impression that my
country is trying to adapt to the
movement starting in the United
States. We have great capacity. 1
think we will see results," Mitter
rand said.
He also asked the participants
how they felt about French

software, prefacing their answers
with his own statement: ''We
tend to think that we are quite
well advanced."
Computer Science Prof. Edward
Feigenbaum criticized the French
university system as providing
"poor preparation" for French
software designers and said the
schools lacked computer power.
"In the advanced area of artifi
cial intelligence we find the
French scene rather lively,
Feigenbaum said. However, he
said, " the state-of-the-art is be
hind that here in Silicon Valley."
Steven Jobs, co-founder of Ap
ple Computers Inc., described the
success of American software as
being based on the coupling of
"youthful energy" and venture
capital.
"This phenomenon does not ex
ist in France. The bright students
don't start up companies. The
entrepreneurial environment does
not exist to the same extent in
France," he said.
Jobs also pointed out the dif-
