## President Mitterrand sees a byte of Silicon Valley 
### ADAM GOODMAN Daily staff 
French President Francois Mit
terrand brought his high
technology questions to Stanford
last week and sought out answers
from some of Silicon Valley's
leading experts.
In a 90-minute briefing session
at the unfinished Center for Inte
grated Systems (CIS) last Mon
day, University President Donald
Kennedy and 13 local representa
tives — professors, administra
tors, industrialists and venture
capitalists — talked with Mitter
rand about the future of high
technology research in
microelectronics and biotechnol
ogy. The session was a part of
Mitterrand's week-long visit to
the United States which also in
cluded stops in San Francisco and
Berkeley.
The socialist president has
shown great interest in the future
of research and in increasing
French participation in the high
tech field. Mitterrand has risked
earmarking substantial govern
ment funding toward research
during the current recession in
which the French gross national
product has dropped 3 percent.
"It is a fact that most of the
enthusiasm (for research) comes
from the state . . . What we have
done is opt for research as a
priority issue," he said in his CIS
briefing.
The top issue of the discussion
at Stanford was funding. Mitter
rand showed interest in finding
out about the inner workings of
obtaining research funds.
Panelists. discussed both
governmental and industrial fun
ding of research.
"Basic research supported by
the government may not stretch
far enough," said Kennedy, who
also noted that the University
receives more than $100 million

per year in sponsored research
funding exclusive of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center. Ken
nedy estimated that only 5 per
cent of that money comes from
industry, the rest from federal
funds.
Nobel laureate and Chemistry
Prof. Paul Berg said he worries
that basic research for biotech
nology may be in trouble. "We run
the risk of underfunding, under
supporting that kind of research
in the future," he said, emphasiz
ing that industrial funds need to
be diverted away from research
toward a specific product and
toward fundamental studies.
Mitterrand said he was sup
ported future research. "We will
find that what has been done
shows that we are willing to go
much further," he said. "There is
going to be a serious revolution.
"It is my impression that my
country is trying to adapt to the
movement starting in the United
States. We have great capacity. 1
think we will see results," Mitter
rand said.
He also asked the participants
how they felt about French

software, prefacing their answers
with his own statement: ''We
tend to think that we are quite
well advanced."
Computer Science Prof. Edward
Feigenbaum criticized the French
university system as providing
"poor preparation" for French
software designers and said the
schools lacked computer power.
"In the advanced area of artifi
cial intelligence we find the
French scene rather lively,
Feigenbaum said. However, he
said, " the state-of-the-art is be
hind that here in Silicon Valley."
Steven Jobs, co-founder of Ap
ple Computers Inc., described the
success of American software as
being based on the coupling of
"youthful energy" and venture
capital.
"This phenomenon does not ex
ist in France. The bright students
don't start up companies. The
entrepreneurial environment does
not exist to the same extent in
France," he said.
Jobs also pointed out the dif-

ferences between the French and American
markets for software: si/.e and language.
"Here we have a (large) homogeneous mar
ket .. . Most French software won't make it
out of France."
At a reception in the Kennedy home fol
lowing the briefing, some of the other parti
cipants commented upon the earlier
discussion. Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Gibbons, who is also the executive
committee chairman for CIS, said he

thought his counterparts may have been
overly critical of French software.
"The French took a lot more static than
they should have. It is unfortunate that
they were put on the defensive," Gibbons
said.
However, Gibbons said he sees problems in
France's current research strategy, even with
the $5 billion in government funding toward
research under the Mitterrand government.
He called the French universities "far too
theoretical" and suggested new methods for
inspiring improvement.
"One has to find ways to encourage
creativity. You don't do that by con

glomerating firms together," Gibbons said.
Gene Amdahl, chairman of Trilogy Sys
tems Corporation, believes the French can
improve their standing by establishing a rela
tionship with the U.S. venture capital indus
try. He estimates that "hundreds of millions
of dollars" of French money has already been
invested in Silicon Valley, including his own
company.
"By doing that they can feel quite
reassured in having access to some subset of
what goes on here. The best way to learn is
to observe closely," he explained. "The first
step is education. The next step is invest
ment."

The briefing session gave Stanford offi
cials the chance to praise the CIS set-up
between industry and higher education. Still
under construction, the CIS research center
is a $25 million University project that is
being built in conjunction with 20 companies
and the government. To participate each
company had to make a gift of $750,000.
Currently CIS conducts about $15 million
worth of research yearly, most of it funded
by the federal government.
Kennedy told Mitterrand that he liked
"to think of this incomplete building as the
paradigm of the future."
Robert Noyce, vice chairman of Intel Cor

poration, praised the future possibilities of
CIS. "In this environment we can do research
which we would not be able to justify doing
in our own private companies. In the sense
that, the more fundamental research is, the
more likely it is to be used by your competi
tion rather than yourself."
According to Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Meindl, co-director of CIS, Mitter
rand "certainly was interested" in hearing
about CIS. "The trend worldwide is to have a
better coupling between industry and uni
versities," he said following the briefing.
"We're the model."
