# Card finishes as predicted; Longhorns take the crown
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The prediction came true. As
far as Stanford was concerned
that is.
As the end of season polls
predicted, the Stanford wo
men's swimming team came in
second place at the NCAA
Championship at Indianapolis
two weekends ago. But the
predicted successor to the Car
dinal's 1983 championship,
Florida, did not live up to its
expectations.
Florida finished third behind
Stanford and first-place Texas.
The Longhorn victory may not
even be considered an upset, as
they easily outdistanced both
the Cardinal and the Gators,
392, 324 and 313, respectively.
But the Cardinal women may
have set the tone for the men's
performance a week early.
That tone was based on indi
vidual performance, and
Marybeth Linzmeier may have
redefined the word tone.
On the meet's opening day,
Linzmeier set an NCAA record
in the 500 yard freestyle,
breaking her own record.
Linzmeier was timed at 4:38.91
to surpass her NCAA record of
4:39.95 set last year. It was her
third victory in the 500 in as
many years.
The Cardinal's Krissie Bush
won the 50 freestyle and the
Card also teamed up for a vic
tory in the 200 medley relay.
But all those victories weren't
enough to give Stanford the
first-day lead as it trailed
Texas 161 to 142.
Bush took the 50 free in
22.98 after going 22.99 in the
trials, both her personal bests.
Bush had an outstanding 22.01
free split to anchor the 200
medley relay team to victory in
1:42.81, 22 hundredths of a
second better than the Car
dinals' NCAA winning time
last year.
The other team members
were Libby Kinkead (also
eighth in the 200 back in
2:02.19), Kathy Smith and
Diana Zock (also 12th in the
50 free in 22.66).
Stanford freshman Susan
Rapp had an outstanding day,
also finishing second in the 100
fly in a life-best 54.05 behind
winner Joan Pennington of
Texas, whose 53.70 was a na
tional season best. Rapp was
also fourth in the 200 individ
ual medley in a Stanford
record 2:01.67.
Stanford's Patty Gavin took
fifth in the 200 back in
2:02.32. Gavin had finished
seventh in the trials, but the
disqualification of another

swimmer gave her a chance to
swim in the championship
finals (the top six places in the
trials).
With a little more luck and a
continuing onslaught by
Linzmeier, the Cardinal hoped
to close in on Texas. However,
Linzmeier was the only hope
that panned out for the Card.
On the second day,
Linzmeier set another NCAA
record in the 200 free, clocking
in at 1:45.47. Linzmeier kept
Stanford in the chase with her
victory in the 200 free.
"I've been working on my
200 freestyle a lot these past
couple of years because I've
enjoyed the shorter races," she
said. "But I was certainly ner
vous going into this one. I knew
it was going to be a really diffi
cult race . . . laying in bed,
thinking about all the competi
tion. In between prelims and
finals you build up a lot of ner
vous energy."
But the rest of the Cardinal
was only able to muster up a
second place finish in the 200
free relay. Pennington once
again foiled the Card, racing
from third to first in the final
50 yards.
On the final day of the meet
Linzmeier easily took the 1650
free, finishing 10 seconds
ahead of her nearest chal
lenger. With three individual
titles in this year's meet,
Linzmeier ran her three-year
total to eight.
"The first 500 felt really
smooth," Linzmeier said, after
winning her eighth individual
gold. "If I had been pushed, I
would have been able to go
faster and get the record.
"I probably should have
relaxed a little more in the
first 100," she said. "I was
starting to hurt in that last
500 and had to work to keep
my elbows in."
Linzmeier had some help in
her hope to bring Stanford the
title from senior Sherri Hanna
who finished third and sopho
more Lisa Hazen who finished
12th in the 1650.
Freshman Susan Rapp, who
only five minutes earlier had
won the 200 breast in a meet
and school-record 2:12.84,
finished second to Florida's
Tracy Caulkins in the butter
fly.
Stanford's Kathy Smith
took fifth in the 200 breast in
2:18.82 and Krissie Bush
finished eighth in the 100 free
in 50.69.
But the Cardinal just didn't
have enough to catch the stub
born Longhorns.
