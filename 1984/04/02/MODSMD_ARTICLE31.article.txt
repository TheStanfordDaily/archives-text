# Trojans sweep breaking Card
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
The Stanford baseball team's trip to Los
Angeles this past weekend turned out to
be more than a battle with the No. 6-rated
USC Trojans for second place in the
Pacific-10 Conference Southern Division.
It proved to be a weekend of streaks —
some ending and some continuing.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, in
either case the results were not good. The
Trojans swept the three-game series to
remain in hot pursuit of the league-leading
and No. 3-ranked Arizona State Wildcats.
In case you were lying on a beach in
Mexico, you may not have heard that the
Cardinal had put together a torrid nine
game winning streak.
Stanford had won four in a row after a
three-game sweep of California and added
its fifth consecutive win with a 14-6
pounding of the Gaels ot St. Mary s in a
non-league contest during Dead Week.
The streak continued when UCLA rolled
into Palo Alto for a three-game series. I he
Bruin?! had been touted in the pre-season
as a Pac-10 title contender, yet entered
the series at 2-4 in the conference. Alter-:
wards it was apparent that the Bruins had
strayed too far from their den as they
limped home with a 2-7 mark.
In the first contest, it was junior second
baseman Pete Stanicek who shot the
Bruins down. Stanicek did more than
stretch his hitting streak to eight games
when he ended a seesaw affair with a
leadoff home run in the bottom ot the
ninth, giving Stanford a 7-6 victory.
Freshman Rick Dietz recorded the tirst
win of his career when lie bailed out tellow
freshman Rob Wassenaar in the top ot the
seventh.
On Sunday another individual's streak
was lengthened. Senior right-hander John
Radtke notched the sixth straight win ol
his undefeated campaign and his third
complete game in a 4-0 whitewashing ol
the Bruins.

Radtke silenced UCLA on just four hits
while fanning seven batters and walking
three. He also lowered his earned run
average to 2.20, seventh in the "Six-Pac"
Southern Division.
The entire UCLA squad, right down to
the coaching staff, seemed bent on victory
as the Bruins jumped out of the gate to a
3-0 advantage in the first inning of the se
ries finale. Lindsay Meggs' three-run
homer gave UCLA a lead that it nursed
for the first half of the contest.
The Card had closed to within two runs
at 5-3 when Mark Davis blasted his fourth
home run, a two-run shot in the fifth off
losing pitcher Chuck Yeager that tied the
game.
Yeager became the loser when Ken
Bloom relieved him with the bases loaded
in the seventh and promptly walked pinch
hitter Jeff Ballard to force in the winning
run. Kevin Kunkel (2-4) got the win after
going five-and-two-thirds innings in relief
of Al Osuna.
The 6-5 triumph gave the Cardinal a
sweep and boosted Stanford's league win
ning streak to six after a 1-2 start.
The Card thrashed St. Mary's 17-1 on
the road one day later and the overall win
skein stood at nine and its season slate
went to 21-12-1. Memories of a sluggish
offense had disappeared and no one was
happier than Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess.
"I knew we would hit better than we did
earlier." he said last week. He also noted
the contributions of Stephens and fresh
man Ruben Amaro. Jr. during the streak.
••When a freshman hits that well, it's a real
pleasant surprise and it offsets Mark
Davis' slump."
Stephens went N for 14 against UCLA
and St. Mary's to raise his average almost
40 points to .337.
USC. however, decided to derail Stan
ford's ride toward the top ot the "Six-
Pac" over the weekend. And the Trojans.

tied with Stanford in second place at 7 -2
before the series, can thank their first
baseman Mark McGwire.
McGwire had been riding a hot streak
too. Just a junior, lie became the Pac-10's
career home run leader when he hit three
last week. His streak continued because he
cracked four more home runs agaii-st the
Card, giving him six in his last four games
and 23 about half way through the season.
His team has now won eight in a row and
holds sole possession of second place with a
10-2 mark. 30-9 overall. With the three
defeats, Stanford drops to 7-5 and 21-15-
1. Arizona State led the division at 10-1
before tackling UCLA yesterday.
USC made it six straight with a 5-3 vic
tory over the Cardinal Friday night.
McGwire did his share to snap the Card's
victory string with his 20th homer of the
season, breaking his school record of 19 set
over the entire 1953 season. Scott Som
mers also smashed a three-run round trip
per off loser Jeff Ballard (4-3) in the
second inning.
"Those home runs really hurt us."
Marquess pointed out on Saturday. "They
got four runs with two swings of the bat."
Stanford closed the gap to 5-3 when
Darryl Stephens hit his fourth homer in
the eighth and filled the bases with one
out in the ninth. But reliever Ron
Roebuck sealed the win for USC starter
Sid Akins (6-3).
Trojan power ended another Stanford
streak on Saturday night as USC became
the first club to defeat John Radtke (6-
1). Once again, it was McGwire leading the
way. He homered in his third consecutive
game, this time twice, and Jeff Brown
added another long ball in another 5-3
Trojan triumph.
Ironically. McGwire's first-inning error
led to one of two Stanford runs that gave
the Cards an earlv 2-0 lead. Mike Deßenon

Stanford centerfielder Darryl Stephens made this game-saving catch in the first game against
UCLA as the Cardinal swept the Bruins. But the Card ran into a brick wall in Los Angeles as
USC took three over the weekend.
