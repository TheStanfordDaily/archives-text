The No. 1-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team racked up
another four victories over
spring break to run its record
to an unblemished 13-0. The
Card opened with an easy 9-0
victory at home over Cal State
Fullerton last Monday before
hitting the road, traveling to
Cal State Long Beach for a 9-0
win, UCLA for a tough 5-4
verdict, and a rematch with
Fullerton that ended 9-0 again.
The only challenging match
of the group came at UCLA.
The Cardinal took a 4-2 lead
after the singles matches and
needed a win at first doubles
by freshmen Patty Fendick and
Leigh Anne Eldredge to clinch
the victory.
In the singles, junior Linda
Gates led the way with a 6-4,
3-6, 6-2 victory over Pat Hy at
No. 2. Sophomore Kate Gom
pert defeated Lynn Lewis, 6-3,
6-1 at No. 3; Eldredge put
away Karen Dewis. 6-3, 6-0, at
No. 4; and senior Michelle
Weiss bested Karina Walters,
6-2, 3-6, 6-4, at No. 6.
The Card's singles losses

came at No. 1, where Liz
Minter beat Fendick, 3-6, 6-2,
6-4, and at No. 5, where Jane
Thomas beat freshman Step
hanie Savides, 6-4, 7-5.
At first doubles, Fendick
and Eldredge dropped their
first set, 6-2, but came back
strong to take the next two, 6-
1, 6-4, and give the Cardinal
the victory.
At No. 2, Gompert and
Weiss had a good chance to win
their match, jumping out to a
6-2 victory in the first set over
Dewis and Thomas. The second
set was tied at 6-6, but the
Cardinal duo could not close
out the match, as the Bruins
took the tiebreaker and the
set. 7-6. The Bruins then closed
out the match, winning the
third set, 6-3.
At No. 3. Hy and Alagassi
defeated Gates and Savides, 6-
4, 6-1.
The netters next travel to
UC-Berkeley for a match with
the Bears Wednesday. Stan
ford won the first meeting be
tween the teams, 9-0, on the
Farm. The Card's next home
match is April 13 against
Arizona.
