### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The Cardinal men's tennis team picked up a
much-needed victory over the University ot
California-Berkeley on Saturday, winning 6-3
and extending its record to I 1-2 overall. 3-0
in the Pacific-10 conference.
"Last year, when we were having some
problems, we got a win over Cal and it really
seemed to turn our season around.'' Mead
Coach Dick Gould said. "Hopefully, this win
will do the same as last year."
Indeed, on the Wednesday ot Dead Week,
the then-No. 2-ranked Cardinal dropped a 6-
3 decision to No. 6-ranked Trinity University.
"The guys were a little down after losing to
Trinity. They needed something to get their
heads turned around." Gould said.
At first, however, the Card looked like it
was going to bury its head in the asphalt. Ihe
Cardinal lost the first three singles matches
and sophomore Dan Goldie was down a break
point when things finally started going the
right way.
"It didn't look good." Gould said simply.

Stanford may have been guilty of underes
timating the Golden Bears. The 12th-ranked
Bears, now 12-3 overall and 0-3 in the Pac-10,
had lost two matches to the Arizona schools,
previous easy prey of the Cardinal.
But Cal was much tougher against the
Card. "Against the Arizona schools, they
(Cal) had three of their top four out. I knew
they were better than what their record
showed.'* Gould said. The Bears were also
playing at home. "It was a tough win at their
place." Gould added.

DeVries. 4-6, 7-6, 6-4: Harold Hecht defeated
