# At least they deserve the crown

Will it be college basketball's version of Capitol
Punishment or will the nation's tallest fraternity
take the NCAA basketball throne tonight at the
Kingdome in Seattle?
Georgetown University (a.k.a. the Department
of Defense) and the University of Houston (a.k.a.
Phi Slamma Jamma) will square off in what could
be one of the best matchups in tournament his
tory.
History, however, is something that neither one
of these teams wants to think about very much.
Between them, they have lost the last two cham
pionships (Georgetown in 1982, Houston in 1983).
Those losses have some very bad memories asso
ciated with them. In 1982, Georgetown was a pass
away from a national championship. That pass
went the wrong way as Fred Brown found James
Worthy wide open at the top of the key. Too bad
Worthy was playing for North Carolina.
in 1983, Houston learned that old adages do
have some basis in fact. "Live by the (blank), die
by the (blank)" is how one such adage goes. In this
case, the blank was "slamdunk," on which the
Cougars had feasted all year. But on that taithtul
night almost a year ago, North Carolina State's
Lorenzo Charles slammed home a wayward shot at
the buzzer to spoil the Phi's best rush party in
many years.
But the disclaimer "could be" is important when
you talk about this game. On paper it looks like a
dream game, which is just fine by Houston's 7-
foot center Akeem (the Dream) Olajuwon. He will
have to contend with another 7-foot center in
Georgetown's Patrick Ewing.
Both of them are team leaders. Both of them
are All-Americans. Both of them are foreign born.
The similarities abound.
Both of them are also prone to get into foul
trouble. Olajuwon fouled out in the first game of
the tournament against' Louisiana Tech (it didn't
matter), bringing his total to six early exits for the
season. He hasn't had any trouble since, but then
again he hasn't played against a physical player like
Ewing either.
Ewing had his troubles on Saturday in the first
half against Kentucky. He collected three quick
fouls and a ticket to the bench. Georgetown was
down by seven points when he left, went down by
as much as 12 before scrambling back to seven
down at halftime.
In the second half, Ewing mended his ways and
didn't so much as know what a foul was. Kentucky
helped out quite a bit by going 3-33 from the field
in the final half. If either Ewing qr Olajuwon gets
into foul trouble, this game could be a blowout.
The only other standout performer is Houston's
forward Michael Young. Young is among the best

shooters in the collegiate ranks. He'll probably be
cancelled out by Georgetown's balanced and ex
tremely deep attack, led by the celebrity tandem
of Michael Jackson and Billy Martin.
The most curious matchup will probably be when
Georgetown's Michael "All-Mean" Graham and
Houston's Ricky Winslow guard each other. These
two freshmen probably have enough hair on their
scalps to make one moustache and enough shoot
ing ability to build a brick house. Dunk for dunk
and elbow for elbow, they're equal.
Up to now, Georgetown hasn't shown a whole
lot of consistency. As mentioned before, the
Hoyas were down by seven points, 29-22, to Ken
tucky after the first half and probably lucky to be
that close.

On Second Thought
Jason Cole

In the second half, Georgetown outscored the
Wildcats 12-0 to take a five-point lead. In fact,
the Hoyas' defense kept the 'Cats so subdued that
they didn't get their first points of the half until
almost 10 minutes elapsed.
This Jekyll and Hyde imitation didn't seem to
hurt the Hoyas as they eventually cruised to a 53-
40 victory. But Houston had a much different
time with a cavalier squad from Virginia.
From the beginning, this game looked like an
easy tuneup for the Cougars. At two different
times, Houston had a seven-point lead in the first
half and looked like it was ready to break the game
open. But Virginia remained patient and closed to
within two at halftime, 25-23.
Virginia tied the game to start the second half
and remained close the rest of the way. With 35
seconds left, the Cavaliers were down by two when
guard Othell Wilson stole the ball and raced
downcourt for the tying layup. In overtime, the
Cavaliers took an early lead, but frittered it away
with mistakes, as the Cougars rallied to win 49-47.
The major point is that Houston seems more
than obliging in its desire to play its opponents'
game. Against both Wake Forest and Virginia, the
Cougars sat back in a zone defense while those
teams blistered the nets from the outside and
stayed close.
Houston is a far superior team in total talent to

either one of those teams, but chose not to use
that talent. Against Georgetown, the Cougars are
going to have to use that talent to win. They may
not be ready, however, and it may cost them the
crown.
But besides the game itself, there is one other
appealing note to this game. At least this time it
features two of the top teams in the country.
Last year's national champion, North Carolina
State, wasn't surprising. It was a joke. That's not
to take anything away from the Wolfpack, but
their mystical journey to the No. 1 ranking was
more a result of the NCAAs' growing obsession
with hurting the best teams in the country and
making the regular season nearly meaningless.
This year, the tournament field was made up of
53 teams. Next year it will again expand to include
64 teams. It's true that 64 is a nice round number
to make the tournament chart into, but it is also
almost a third of the entire total of Division I
teams.
What's so wrong with that? First, if the top
teams are being forced to play an additional six
games to win the title, what's the point of playing
a 30-game season in which you prove yourself
throughout, only to lose by some fluke in a single
elimination tournament?
Virginia, Dayton and SMU are three mediocre
teams that managed to get bids to the tourna
ment. To say that any of these teams had played
up to the capabilities of fellow entrants North
Carolina, De Paul or Arkansas, would not only be a
questionable statement, it would be a stupid one.
Both Virginia and Dayton went farther than
any of the others mentioned and SMU nearly
pulled the biggest upset of the tournament when
Georgetown narrowly escaped from the Mustangs,
37-36.
The point is that over the entire season none of
those teams compares with any of the best teams
in the country. But in any one game, these teams
have a very good chance of pulling an upset. With
that upset, however, these teams can luck their
way into a national championship (just like N.C.
State in 1983).
To better insure that only the best teams (those
that have proved themselves throughout the
season) win the championship the tournament
should be made smaller, 32 teams at most. This
would eliminate the nominal teams.
Some people would argue that this would create
a large group of powerhouses. Too bad. Moreover,
there's enough basketball talent around the
country to dispel this fear.
This season's tournament has turned out quite
well. At least the eventual champion will deserve
it.
