# Elway to face DWI charges
## 
### 
Football Coach Jack Elway was arrested on
suspicion of drunken driving last Tuesday night while
driving on southbound Highway 17.
Elway, 52, failed a roadside sobriety test, but
Sports Information Director Steve Raczvnski told
the Peninsula Times Tribune that Elway's chronic
arthritis condition may mean that he could never
walk well enough to pass such a test.
Results of a blood alcohol test will not be known
for several weeks, a California Highway Patrol
spokesman said, and the district attorney will then
decide whether to prosecute Elway, who replaced Paul
Wiggin as Stanford's head football coach earlier this
year.
Driving records from the California Department of
Motor Vehicles show that Elway has had no previous
drunken driving arrests.
Elway said he would have no comment on the case
until the blood alcohol test results are known.
