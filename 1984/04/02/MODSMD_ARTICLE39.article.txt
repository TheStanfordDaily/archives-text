# Commissary to be closed
## 
### 
The final decision to close Stanford's Commissary
was announced last Friday.
Vice President William Massy made the decision
after a report showed University Food Service could
save as much as $175,000 to $200,000 in just one year

of buying directly from outside food distributors.
The Commissary has been losing money for several
years. A cumulative loss of $160,000 to $233,000 is
projected by the time of the Commissary's closing,
scheduled to take place by Aug. 31.
Massy said the University will do "as much as we
can to relocate" the 12 employees who now work at
the Commissary. However, union officials contend
that the closing of the Commissary is part of the
University's effort to "bust" their union.
