PROGRAM

and staff members will be able to begin placing
their orders for the computers, which Stanford
will sell at about 50 percent tit the suggested
retail price.
Judith Windt, the public information ofticer

for Information Technology Services, said Stan
ford expects to receive an initial shipment of 400
Macintoshes and will pass those on to customers
immediately, in the order determined by the lot
tery.
After the application process for the lottery
ends on April 12. a computer program will assign
a random lottery number to each order placed.
Four days later, the lottery numbers will be
pulled one by one to determine which purchasers
will receive one of the first 400 computers and
which will have to wait for further shipments,
which could arrive as late as midsummer.
Orders for the Macintosh will be accepted
after April 12. but they will be filled on a first
come. first-served basis after all lottery orders
have been filled.
Order forms are available for students, faculty

and academic staff at Instruction and Research
Information Systems (IRIS), in Cyprus Hall E-7.
Order forms for administrative staff may be
picked up Departmental Information Systems, in
Polya Hall 102. Completed order forms should be
taken to the ordering office in Redwood Hall. G

To acquaint potential purchasers with the
capabilities of the Macintosh, IRIS will offer
seminars for students, faculty and staff mem
bers today and tomorrow.
The seminars, designed to give an overview of
products offered through the Microdisc Program
and answer specific questions, will be held in
Turing Auditorium (Polya Hall 11) today from 2
to 4 p.m. and tomorrow from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m.
In addition, Macintoshes will be
available for evaluation by
prospective purchasers in the Elmer
Microcomputer Laboratory in For
sythe Hall, Monday through Friday
from noon until 4 p.m. and Tuesdays
and Thursdays from 6 to 10 p.m.
The Macintosh isn't the only prod
uct which will be available through
the Microdisc Program. Apple's Lisa
2, Lisa 2/5 and Lisa 2/10 systems will
be offered, along with Hewlett-

Packard's 150 Touchscreen, Series
200 Model 16 (also known as the
9816) and various peripheral devices
and software.
Stanford is still negotiating with
IBM and Digital Equipment Corpor
ation over the possibility of offer
ing equipment from those companies
as well.
Purchasers will be limited to one
basic system configuration. After a
year, a second system may be pur
chased through Microdisc, subject to
restrictions from the computer com
panies.
Software and peripherals will also
be limited to quantities of one, ex

cept in cases where a system can han
dle more than one unit, such as a disk
drive.
Students who wish to finance the
purchase of a Microdisc Program
computer can pick up an information
sheet on California Loans to Assist
Students at either the Financial Aids
Office in Old Union or at the IRIS
office.
