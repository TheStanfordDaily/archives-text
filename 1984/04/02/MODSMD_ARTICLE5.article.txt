Final results in Salvador vote
San Salvador, El Salvador — Official results from the
first-round presidential election March 25 were released
yesterday, confirming earlier unofficial estimates that
Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte was taking a
sizable lead into the runoff and that voting failed to take
place at more than 10 percent of the nation's ballot boxes.
The official tally gave Duarte 43.4 percent of the vote,
compared to 29.8 percent for his nearest rival. Roberto
D'Aubuisson of the right-wing Nationalist Republican Al
liance.
Dark horse Francisco Guerrero ol the conservative Na
tional Conciliation Party failed to make the runoff with a
third-place showing of 19.3 percent, while the remainder of
the votes were divided among five small parties that were
never considered to have a chance to win.
In the first official estimate of the degree of breakdown
in the voting a week ago, the Central Elections Council re
ported that no returns would be available from 760 of the
nation's 6598 ballot boxes.
Voting did not take place at most of these ballot boxes
because ballots, voters' lists or the boxes never arrived at
the proper sites, or because the polling officials were never
named or failed to show up. elections officials said. At
some polling places, left-wing guerrilla activity prevented
voting from taking place, the officials said.
Father kills Marvin Gaye
Los Angeles — Marvin Gaye, the smooth-voiced soul
singer who topped the charts in the 1960s with such hits as
"I Heard It Through the Grapevine," was fatally shot in the
chest yesterday after a fight with his father, police said.
Gaye was at his parents' home on the eve of his 45th
birthday when he became involved in the fight and was shot
several times with a handgun. Police later questioned his fa
ther, Marvin Gaye Sr., about the shooting, police l.t.
Robert Martin said.
"He became involved in a physical altercation with his fa
ther" around 12:30 p.m., Martin said. "Marvin Sr. subse
quently armed himself with a handgun of unknown caliber
and fired several rounds."
The elder Gaye had not been booked. Martin said, but
police were contemplating seeking manslaughter or murder
charges.
"As best we can tell, there has been some bad blood. We
don't know the extent of it," Martin said.
Gaye, whose career spanned nearly 30 years, was taken in
critical condition to California Hospital. He was
pronounced dead at 1:01 p.m., said hospital spokeswoman
Michelle Barker.
No shift in Honduran policy
expected from exile of leader
Tegucigalpa, Honduras — Gen. Gustavo Alverez Mar
tinez's abrupt ouster as armed forces chief of Honduras was
decided by about 20 lieutenant colonels and colonels com
manding military units around the country, according to
sources in the opposition National Party with close connec
tions to the army.
The officers, they said yesterday, acted mainly out of dis
gust with Alvarez's high-handed style of command, which
violated a tradition of consultation in the officer corps,
and what they characterized as liis growing corruption.
The military's repudiation of Alvarez, 45, was not neces
sarily a repudiation of his support for the Reagan adminis
tration's policy of using Honduras as a staging area for
military maneuvers and a CIA-financed guerrilla war aimed
at the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Honduran and
diplomatic sources said.
Rather, it opened a period of uncertainty that could
mean a shift in style and emphasis, but is unlikely to
produce drastic or swift movement away from Honduran
cooperation in U.S. military planning, they added.
U.S. diplomats said Honduran President Roberto Suazo
Cordova met Saturday with Ambassador John Negrop6nte
and offered assurances that the nation's foreign policy
would not change. A series of joint military maneuvers in
volving 800 U.S. Army engineers formally began here Sun
day as scheduled. The exercises, known as Granadero 1. were
scheduled to last three months and eventually put more
than 3500 American soldiers in Honduras.
Trilateralists debate aid plan
Washington — Members of the private and prestigious
Trilateral Commission, who were received by President
Reagan at the White House yesterday as part of a three
day meeting here, are debating a task force report that calls
on Japan to make new multibiilion-dollar commitments to
the western world's military defense and economic aid.
The report said Japan should make up the entire $3 billion
shortfall in the World Bank's aid program for Third World
countries, managed by the International Development As
sociation (IDA). Recently, IDA announced that the three
year program scheduled to start this year would have to be
held to $9 billion instead of the recommended $12 billion
because of limits the United States had placed on its con
tribution.
The task force document, which painted an exceedingly
grim picture of economic and political disarray in Europe,
states that Japan is wealthy enough to export more capital
and to help Europe modernize its "backward" industries by
investing more money there. The strong implication in the
report is that by failing to do so, Japan is certain to face
even stronger protectionist measures than those that are
already keeping Japanese goods out of European markets.
Hart gets Soviet support
Moscow — As the U.S. Democratic presidential primary
race moves into a decisive stage, Sen. Gary Hart is picking
up some support he may not have expected and might
prefer to do without.
The official Soviet press, which remains unremittingly
contemptuous of President Reagan and measured but
skeptical in its treatment of former Vice President Walter
Mondale, has fastened on Hart as the most appealing can
didate for the U.S. presidency in 1984.
"He has gone further than the others in peace-loving
slogans and demands for change." Vitaly Kobysh, a
prominent commentator and Communist Party official
told television viewers recently.
While "Mondale is panicking." the commentator
asserted. Hart is "conducting his dynamic election campaign
in the spirit of the late John Kennedy," the post-war presi
dent the Soviets most respect.
The newspaper Soviet Russia also waxed enthusiastic
about Hart last week with the view that the Colorado
senator's "anti-war statements reveal someone who
opposes the adventurist course of the Ronald Reagan ad
ministration on a slide toward nuclear catastrophe." »
"On the other hand, his image appeals to moderates and
certain segments of conservative voters,"the newspaper
observed in a generally non-polemical analysis. It added
cautiously that while Hart supports a nuclear freeze, he "is
in no way a pacifist."

Final results in Salvador vote
San Salvador, El Salvador — Official results from the
first-round presidential election March 25 were released
yesterday, confirming earlier unofficial estimates that
Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte was taking a
sizable lead into the runoff and that voting failed to take
place at more than 10 percent of the nation's ballot boxes.
The official tally gave Duarte 43.4 percent of the vote,
compared to 29.8 percent for his nearest rival. Roberto
D'Aubuisson of the right-wing Nationalist Republican Al
liance.
Dark horse Francisco Guerrero ol the conservative Na
tional Conciliation Party failed to make the runoff with a
third-place showing of 19.3 percent, while the remainder of
the votes were divided among five small parties that were
never considered to have a chance to win.
In the first official estimate of the degree of breakdown
in the voting a week ago, the Central Elections Council re
ported that no returns would be available from 760 of the
nation's 6598 ballot boxes.
Voting did not take place at most of these ballot boxes
because ballots, voters' lists or the boxes never arrived at
the proper sites, or because the polling officials were never
named or failed to show up. elections officials said. At
some polling places, left-wing guerrilla activity prevented
voting from taking place, the officials said.
Father kills Marvin Gaye
Los Angeles — Marvin Gaye, the smooth-voiced soul
singer who topped the charts in the 1960s with such hits as
"I Heard It Through the Grapevine," was fatally shot in the
chest yesterday after a fight with his father, police said.
Gaye was at his parents' home on the eve of his 45th
birthday when he became involved in the fight and was shot
several times with a handgun. Police later questioned his fa
ther, Marvin Gaye Sr., about the shooting, police l.t.
Robert Martin said.
"He became involved in a physical altercation with his fa
ther" around 12:30 p.m., Martin said. "Marvin Sr. subse
quently armed himself with a handgun of unknown caliber
and fired several rounds."
The elder Gaye had not been booked. Martin said, but
police were contemplating seeking manslaughter or murder
charges.
"As best we can tell, there has been some bad blood. We
don't know the extent of it," Martin said.
Gaye, whose career spanned nearly 30 years, was taken in
critical condition to California Hospital. He was
pronounced dead at 1:01 p.m., said hospital spokeswoman
Michelle Barker.
No shift in Honduran policy
expected from exile of leader
Tegucigalpa, Honduras — Gen. Gustavo Alverez Mar
tinez's abrupt ouster as armed forces chief of Honduras was
decided by about 20 lieutenant colonels and colonels com
manding military units around the country, according to
sources in the opposition National Party with close connec
tions to the army.
The officers, they said yesterday, acted mainly out of dis
gust with Alvarez's high-handed style of command, which
violated a tradition of consultation in the officer corps,
and what they characterized as liis growing corruption.
The military's repudiation of Alvarez, 45, was not neces
sarily a repudiation of his support for the Reagan adminis
tration's policy of using Honduras as a staging area for
military maneuvers and a CIA-financed guerrilla war aimed
at the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Honduran and
diplomatic sources said.
Rather, it opened a period of uncertainty that could
mean a shift in style and emphasis, but is unlikely to
produce drastic or swift movement away from Honduran
cooperation in U.S. military planning, they added.
U.S. diplomats said Honduran President Roberto Suazo
Cordova met Saturday with Ambassador John Negrop6nte
and offered assurances that the nation's foreign policy
would not change. A series of joint military maneuvers in
volving 800 U.S. Army engineers formally began here Sun
day as scheduled. The exercises, known as Granadero 1. were
scheduled to last three months and eventually put more
than 3500 American soldiers in Honduras.
Trilateralists debate aid plan
Washington — Members of the private and prestigious
Trilateral Commission, who were received by President
Reagan at the White House yesterday as part of a three
day meeting here, are debating a task force report that calls
on Japan to make new multibiilion-dollar commitments to
the western world's military defense and economic aid.
The report said Japan should make up the entire $3 billion
shortfall in the World Bank's aid program for Third World
countries, managed by the International Development As
sociation (IDA). Recently, IDA announced that the three
year program scheduled to start this year would have to be
held to $9 billion instead of the recommended $12 billion
because of limits the United States had placed on its con
tribution.
The task force document, which painted an exceedingly
grim picture of economic and political disarray in Europe,
states that Japan is wealthy enough to export more capital
and to help Europe modernize its "backward" industries by
investing more money there. The strong implication in the
report is that by failing to do so, Japan is certain to face
even stronger protectionist measures than those that are
already keeping Japanese goods out of European markets.
Hart gets Soviet support
Moscow — As the U.S. Democratic presidential primary
race moves into a decisive stage, Sen. Gary Hart is picking
up some support he may not have expected and might
prefer to do without.
The official Soviet press, which remains unremittingly
contemptuous of President Reagan and measured but
skeptical in its treatment of former Vice President Walter
Mondale, has fastened on Hart as the most appealing can
didate for the U.S. presidency in 1984.
"He has gone further than the others in peace-loving
slogans and demands for change." Vitaly Kobysh, a
prominent commentator and Communist Party official
told television viewers recently.
While "Mondale is panicking." the commentator
asserted. Hart is "conducting his dynamic election campaign
in the spirit of the late John Kennedy," the post-war presi
dent the Soviets most respect.
The newspaper Soviet Russia also waxed enthusiastic
about Hart last week with the view that the Colorado
senator's "anti-war statements reveal someone who
opposes the adventurist course of the Ronald Reagan ad
ministration on a slide toward nuclear catastrophe." »
"On the other hand, his image appeals to moderates and
certain segments of conservative voters,"the newspaper
observed in a generally non-polemical analysis. It added
cautiously that while Hart supports a nuclear freeze, he "is
