# Shultz says U.S. won't move embassy

From the Los Angeles Times
Washington â€” Secretary of State
George Shultz said yesterday that the
United States would not relocate its
embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem and suggested that congres
sional advocates were having second
thoughts about trying to force such a
move.
"I can tell you that the president is
very much opposed to it and will not
move that embassy. What he will do
with a particular piece of legislation I
don't think it's wise for me to predict,"
Shultz said when asked on NBC's
televised "Meet the Press" program
whether he expected President Reagan
to veto pending legislation advocating

the move.
Reagan intimated strongly in an in
terview last week that he would veto
any bill requiring that the embassy be
moved. Democratic contenders Gary
Hart and Walter Mondale have ar
dently argued for the move in their
battle for victory in Tuesday's Demo
cratic primary in New York, where the
Jewish vote is a major electoral factor.
Jesse Jackson, the third man in the
Democratic race, said yesterday during
an interview on "Face the Nation" over
CBS-TV that moving the embassy
would be a "a very dangerous and very
divisive" affront to Israel's Arab neigh
bors, who revere Moslem shrines in
lertisalem

The president's stand has dampened
congressional support lor mandatory
legislation that had attracted 37 spon
sors in the 100-member Senate and 213
in the House, where a majority is 2 IS.
Advocates are now expected to offer a
non-binding substitute.
Shultz suggested that the move's
backers had not "thought the matter
over very carefully" and said the shift
"would be a gigantic aggravation to im
portant religions, particularly the . . .
Islamic religion, and it would thereby
damage the interests of the United
States . . . damage our ability to be ef
fective in, the peace process ... a bad
move to make."
Asked if he expected that Reagan

would "find a way not to move the em
bassy" even if legislation supporting
the move cleared Congress, Shultz took
exception to the premise of the ques
tion.
"It's very bad for the United States
if such legislation passes, even if it
doesn't become law, even if the presi
dent vetoes it. even if he refuses to
move the embassy" Shultz said. "It's a
very bad signal across the world when
something like that takes place.
"My impression is that people in the
Congress are more and more having
second thoughts about this and looking
around for some way in which they
might defuse this issue."
