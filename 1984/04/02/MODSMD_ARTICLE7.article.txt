# Democrats turn their fire to Reagan

From The Washington Post
New York — The Democratic presidential candi
dates shifted some of their fire from each other to
President Reagan yesterday, as they headed for a
showdown in Tuesday's New York primary, with polls
continuing to place Walter Mondale out front.
In an hour-long local television debate that high
lighted the light schedule yesterday, Mondale once
again was the aggressor, challenging Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart's "change of position" on the location of
the U.S. Embassy in Israel. Jesse Jackson backed Hart
in rejecting that as a "litmus test" for the vital bloc
of Jewish voters.
Mondale joined his two rivals in condemning
Reagan's use of the school prayer issue to divert at
tention from what all three called the "moral fail
ures" of the Reagan administration, and the tone of
the session was markedly less strident than their
Wednesday evening debate on CBS television.
Polling by The Washington Post and ABC News
through the weekend gave additional evidence that
Mondale had used that first debate to re-establish his

advantage in the battle for 252 New York delegates.
That lead had been momentarily jeopardized by the
jump in support for Hart immediately after Hart's
win in Connecticut last Tuesday.
The race looks closer in the private polling of the
Mondale and Hart campaigns, the officials respon
sible said yesterday, but both camps showed Mondale
slightly ahead before yesterday's debate.
Mondale told reporters, "This is close. It's tight. It
could go either way."
Today's late-morning debate, moderated by
newsman Gabe Pressman on the local NBC affiliate
here, began on a rare note of amity, with all three
men agreeing that they would feel perfectly "secure"
with the others in the White House,,handling war
and-peace issues.
Jackson, whose support has grown since he took the
peacemaker-statesman role in the Wednesday night
Mondale-Hart hostilities, said any of them "have the
capacity to take the nation to higher heights" than
Reagan.
Jackson mixed that statesman role yesterday with

repeated insistence that his opponents and the media
were trying "to neglect my presence in the race.
"I want to be respected and heard," he said. "The
issues that I raise and the constituency I represent
will not go away."
Jackson said the Israeli embassy issue "does not
have a real place in the middle of the campaign," and
argued that New Yorkers "are more interested in
breaking out of the slums than arguing about Hart or
Mondale."
For much of the hour, the two leading contenders
acted as if they thought that might be true. They
agreed on the importance of the president engaging
in face-to-face negotiations with Soviet leaders —
something all three have criticized Reagan for not
doing in the past 38 months.
They also agreed that all of them would toughen
U.S. policy toward white-ruled South Africa, again
criticizing Reagan for what Mondale termed his fail
ure "to put the United States on the side of human
rights."
