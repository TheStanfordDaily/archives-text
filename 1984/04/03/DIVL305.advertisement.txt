The Daily has a number of opportunities for spring quarter
which will undoubtedly hit the spot. Writing, layout, wire
editing; you name it, we have it. To receive more
information on these profitable pastimes you should rush,
straight as an arrow, to The Daily's orientation for new
staffers on Wednesday at noon and Thursday at noon and
3:30 p.m. at The Daily's offices in the Storke Publications
Building across from the Terman Engineering Center. The
chances will make you quiver.
