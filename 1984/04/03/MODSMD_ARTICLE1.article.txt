# Smoke detectors ordered
## Fire code violation 
### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
I The University will begin installing
smoke detectors in all student
residences this quarter in order to
comply with a 10-month-old or
dinance which Stanford currently vi
olates.
| The ordinance, which requires
smoke detectors for all residences in
unincorporated areas of Santa Clara
County, was passed by the County
Board of Supervisors on May 24,
19H3, according to University Fire
Marshal Paul Andrade.
( Compliance will cost the Univer
sity at least $2 million, according to
Amy Blue, director of Facilities and
Maintenance. Some campus
residences, including Governor's Cor
ner and the older wooden houses on
the Row, already have smoke detec
' tors, Andrade said. The University
will soon establish priorities for the
order in which new smoke detectors
will be installed in other residences.
Blue said that because the Univer
sity had not planned for the $2 mil
lion expenditure, her office is now
working to put together a "funding
package" for the project.
"We're working as quickly as we
can," Blue said. "We hadn't
budgeted the money for this, so we'll
have to come up with a funding pack
age. We're looking at things we
might have done but won't be able to
do because of this."
Blue cited housing reserve funds
and money that would otherwise be
spent for yearly renovations as possi
ble sources of funding for the smoke
detectors.
Although the ordinance was passed
in May 1983, Andrade said the Uni
versity did not become aware of it
until January, when Frank Jurian. the
University's director of public
siUety, noticed it while reviewing a
packet of amendments to the fire
code.
By the time Jurian discovered the
ordinance, the Jan. 1 deadline for
compliance had passed and the Uni
versity was in violation.
Andrade said the University will
now request an extension on that
deadline.
George Overby, a senior civil en
gineer with the county's building in
spection office, said the county will
probably grant such an extension.
"We haven't been asked to yet,"
Overby said, "but if they are not in
compliance now and they're working
toward compliance, I don't see any
problem. Compliance is what we're
after."
Although the ordinance caught
Stanford by surprise, Andrade said
University officials had already been
moving toward a decision to install
smoke detectors in all student
residences, but not as quickly as the
ordinance mandates.
Andrade said he thinks the board
of supervisers did not consider the
impact the ordinance would have on
owners of large residential properties
when setting the Jan. 1 deadline for
compliance.
"It seems to me that it's difficult
on property owners to comply with
this," Andrade said. "If there had
been notice in the newspapers, the
general public at least could just have
installed a smoke detector in the
ceiling, but there was no notice that
1 saw in May of 19N3."
However, Andrade said that even
if the University had known of the
ordinance in May it would have been
impossible to install the smoke
detectors quickly enough to be in
compliance by Jan. 1.
But Santa Clara Supervisor Rod
Diridon, who originally presented the
ordinance to the board of supervisors
after a baby died of smoke inhalation
in a "completely avoidable sort of

tragedy," said he and the board an
ticipated that local authorities
would be lenient where efforts were
being made to comply.
"I'm sure that the fire marshal will
be very flexible if there's a move to
compliance," Diridon said. "It's cer l
tainly not the board's intent to be
punitive."
