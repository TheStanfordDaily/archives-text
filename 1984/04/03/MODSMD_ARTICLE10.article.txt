# Talking computer helps the blind to see
## 
### DANA RATLIFF 
You walk into LOTS, type in your program, try to run it and a
screenful of errors stare you in the face. As the guy sitting next
to you is typing at inhuman speeds, you think to yourself that
nothing could be harder than this.
Wrong. You are lucky. You are fortunate enough to see the
lighted letters in front of you. The blind student cannot.
In this age of computers, the inability to use or View a terminal
can prove to be a major difficulty. Until now, blind students who
wanted to take computer classes or other courses that required
the use of a terminal had to use a tedious system based on Braille.
According to Jim Bouquin, director of Disabled Student
Services, Stanford has " had a special terminal for four or five
years that has a regular screen and a Braille printout system, but
working on a computer without seeing the screen is difficult be
cause the student must continually get printouts to know what
he is doing. This is a time-consuming burden and most visually im
paired students don't read Braille anyhow."
This has all changed with the recent installation of a revolu
tionary computer that actually talks to its user.
"The new audio computer reads off as you type in and also can
read over anything on the screen. The voice is a bit strange at first
but you get used to it. ... You can make the voice high or low,
slow or fast," explained Bouquin.
The first student to use the new equipment for a computer
class, sophomore Michelle Karnow, was enrolled in CS-106 last
quarter. Often seen walking on campus with her seeing-eye dog,
Karnow is interested in computet science,and is,considering
majoring in Math Sciences.
Explained Karnow, "It's a talking,terminal, and it works quite
well. 1 do the regular programs like everyone else: I get errors and

can't figure out why, and then I solve them. The screen is at
tached to a voice synthesizer so whatever appears on the screen
can be read off as words or can be spelled out depending on what
you command it to do. The Braille terminal will print out a hard
copy when I need it but it takes up a lot of paper.
The existence of the new equipment is due largely to the ef
forts of a campus sorority. "The Delta Gamma sorority did a
dance-a-thon to raise money for the computer," said Bouquin.
Lisa Rolfe, foundation chairman of the DGs, said, "We ended
up raising $1500 from our fund-raiser. People were really excited
aboUt helping our cause."
The computer is not only used for programming. Rolfe ex
plained that she uses the computer to write class notes. "I take
notes for blind students. Every day of Math 20 I go to class with
one blind student, take notes, and then type them into the com
puter in a separate file for each day," said Rolfe. The student
then can return to the computer to retrieve notes for a particular
day and really add more information, or manipulate the notes as
she pleases.
Before the special computer was ever installed, the administra
tion, along with visually impaired students, closely researched
equipment available for the blind.
"The students are well aware of the workings of the Disabled
Students Office so they know where we can help them. We do
not consider ourselves a special service. We are simply trying to
make the environment and information available to everyone. . ..
We don't think it is necessary for a disabled student to waste
time and energy trying to overcome obstacle*- â€¢: .:<j othct
never meet. We just want students to be students." added Bou
quin.
