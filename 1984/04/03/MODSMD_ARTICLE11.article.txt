## LEWIE FORD Races unite at theme houses 
### 
Sophomore Diego Cordovez is correct in stating in his
column "Theme houses need re-evaluation" (Daily.
March 9) that "for the most part. Res Ed fails to ed
ucate and challenge students" with "new ideas, experi
ences, perspectives" concerning other cultures.
I nfortiinately, he mistakenly ascribes Res Ed's failures
;iid his claim of "cultural isolation" exclusively to ethnic
theme houses, while overlooking the "cultural diversity"
of all undergraduate housing facilities.
Ethnic theme houses seem to be, according to Cor
dovez. "the most visible example of Res Ed's failure."

VIEWPOINT

Part of this failure, he says, is that "to allow students to
culturally isolate themselves from their first day here is
to retard . . . cultural cooperation and mutual growth."
Agreed. But apparently he thinks that 50 percent of a
particular ethnic group (the approximate percentage of
blacks currently living in Ujamaa) is enough to allow stu
dents to isolate themselves in their culture. He must
also think, too, since he is talking about ethnic theme
houses in general, that the approximately 30 to 40 per
cent minority residents in Zapata and Okada is enough
for these ethnic students to isolate themselves in their
culture and to discourage "cooperation and growth."

What better places are there
for someone to adjust to
other cultures than theme
houses?

If this is the case, he must agree, then, that Res Ed
has failed miserably in other areas as well, because almost
all. if not all, of the non-theme related undergraduate
housing consists of 50 to S5 percent whites. It sure is
easy for whites to culturally isolate themselves.
It is true that the percentage of minorities on campus
is substantially lower, and consequently high numbers of
whites in housing facilities cannot be avoided. But elim
inating theme houses will not remedy the situation be
cause the eventual dispersal of minorities would not
markedly change the high percentage of whites. The pos
sibility of white cultural isolation, therefore, along with
increased cultural diversity, would change very little, if
at all.
Perhaps what Cordovez means is that only minority
ethnic students culturally isolate themselves. But can
this be true? Why are whites able to escape cultural iso
lationism within non-theme houses, which contain a
much higher percentage of whites, while minorities sup
posedly cannot in theme houses, even though the
percentage of minorities is comparatively lower? Ironi
cally. it sounds like the all-too-familiar double standard:
Sure, it is okay if we do it, but if you do — wait just a
minute!
Cordovez suggests that freshmen should be barred
from living in theme houses because "it is too character
istic of ethnic.theme houses to take individuals who have

had limited exposure to other cultures and rather than
helping them to adjust to those other cultures, to in
stead encourage their removal and isolation." Nothing
could be further from the truth.
His first incorrect assumption is that the majority of
ethnic theme residents are isolationist, which is not true.
There are a few residents, both minority and non
minority. in several dorms and residences, not just theme
houses, who want to culturally isolate themselves. This is
not a problem exclusive to theme houses, nor is it caused
by them.
Cordovez's second misconception is that theme houses
do not help culturally limited freshmen adjust to other
cultures, but isolate them to their specific ethnic group.
If he had bothered to question the residents and/or resi
dent fellows at the ethnic residences, he would have
found that there are, in fact, minorities, who come from
ethnically isolated areas, who do live in theme houses in
their freshmen year because these residences help them
adjust to and learn to deal with a predominantly white
society.
Although these individuals' home areas may have been
culturally isolated, it is virtually impossible for them, or
any minorities, to avoid the vast majority of whites on
campus, unless they lock themselves in their rooms 24
hours a day. They consequently have to accept the chal
lenges of learning about other cultures, and theme
houses help these students, as well as others, with handl
ing these new ideas without being overcome by them.
What better places are there for someone to adjust to
other cultures than theme houses, since they are the
most culturally diverse housing facilities on campus, con
taining a more balanced population of non-white and
white people?
Cordovez assumes that cultural isolation and ethnic
independence are one and the same and that theme
houses promote this idea. He also says that one of the
goals of ethnic theme houses is to preserve "an impor
tant culture." What is ethnic independence but preserv
ing an important culture? It is not the same as cultural
isolation, though, because part of preserving one's cul
ture does not include isolating oneself from the rest of
society, as he suggests. We all can be Americans and at
the same time be black, white, Hispanic, Asian, etc. On
the other hand, no particular group should expect the
others to assimilate into white America, black America
or any other culturally dominant society.
The key to having a multi-culture society is that
people interact socially and learn to respect and under
stand other individuals' differences. The easiest way for
everyone to strive for this goal right now is to take ad
vantage of the cultural activities that theme houses of
fer, dine at these places and talk to the residents or
even attend some of the social activities. In this way
Cordovez and everyone else can put aside their miscon
ceptions and preconceived notions about other cultures.
Fewer "narrow leaders, unable to form and lead the
coalitions and diverse organizations which foster growth
and progress" will be the result. By utilizing ethnic
theme houses, instead of "re-evaluating" them, stu
dents can help themselves to the cultural edification and
new challenges that Res Ed fails to provide in the overall
housing system.

culturally isolated, it is virtually impossible for them, or
any minorities, to avoid the vast majority of whites on
campus, unless they lock themselves in their rooms 24
hours a day. They consequently have to accept the chal
lenges of learning about other cultures, and theme
houses help these students, as well as others, with handl
ing these new ideas without being overcome by them.
What better places are there for someone to adjust to
other cultures than theme houses, since they are the
most culturally diverse housing facilities on campus, con
taining a more balanced population of non-white and
white people?
Cordovez assumes that cultural isolation and ethnic
independence are one and the same and that theme
houses promote this idea. He also says that one of the
goals of ethnic theme houses is to preserve "an impor
tant culture." What is ethnic independence but preserv
ing an important culture? It is not the same as cultural
isolation, though, because part of preserving one's cul
ture does not include isolating oneself from the rest of
society, as he suggests. We all can be Americans and at
the same time be black, white, Hispanic, Asian, etc. On
the other hand, no particular group should expect the
others to assimilate into white America, black America
or any other culturally dominant society.
The key to having a multi-culture society is that
people interact socially and learn to respect and under
stand other individuals' differences. The easiest way for
everyone to strive for this goal right now is to take ad
vantage of the cultural activities that theme houses of
fer, dine at these places and talk to the residents or
even attend some of the social activities. In this way
Cordovez and everyone else can put aside their miscon
ceptions and preconceived notions about other cultures.
Fewer "narrow leaders, unable to form and lead the
coalitions and diverse organizations which foster growth
and progress" will be the result. By utilizing ethnic
theme houses, instead of "re-evaluating" them, stu
dents can help themselves to the cultural edification and
new challenges that Res Ed fails to provide in the overall
housing system.

Sophomore Diego Cordovez is correct in stating in his
column "Theme houses need re-evaluation" (Daily.
March 9) that "for the most part. Res Ed fails to ed
ucate and challenge students" with "new ideas, experi
ences, perspectives" concerning other cultures.
I nfortiinately, he mistakenly ascribes Res Ed's failures
;iid his claim of "cultural isolation" exclusively to ethnic
theme houses, while overlooking the "cultural diversity"
of all undergraduate housing facilities.
Ethnic theme houses seem to be, according to Cor
dovez. "the most visible example of Res Ed's failure."

VIEWPOINT

Part of this failure, he says, is that "to allow students to
culturally isolate themselves from their first day here is
to retard . . . cultural cooperation and mutual growth."
Agreed. But apparently he thinks that 50 percent of a
particular ethnic group (the approximate percentage of
blacks currently living in Ujamaa) is enough to allow stu
dents to isolate themselves in their culture. He must
also think, too, since he is talking about ethnic theme
houses in general, that the approximately 30 to 40 per
cent minority residents in Zapata and Okada is enough
for these ethnic students to isolate themselves in their
culture and to discourage "cooperation and growth."

What better places are there
for someone to adjust to
other cultures than theme
houses?

If this is the case, he must agree, then, that Res Ed
has failed miserably in other areas as well, because almost
all. if not all, of the non-theme related undergraduate
housing consists of 50 to S5 percent whites. It sure is
easy for whites to culturally isolate themselves.
It is true that the percentage of minorities on campus
is substantially lower, and consequently high numbers of
whites in housing facilities cannot be avoided. But elim
inating theme houses will not remedy the situation be
cause the eventual dispersal of minorities would not
markedly change the high percentage of whites. The pos
sibility of white cultural isolation, therefore, along with
increased cultural diversity, would change very little, if
at all.
Perhaps what Cordovez means is that only minority
ethnic students culturally isolate themselves. But can
this be true? Why are whites able to escape cultural iso
lationism within non-theme houses, which contain a
much higher percentage of whites, while minorities sup
posedly cannot in theme houses, even though the
percentage of minorities is comparatively lower? Ironi
cally. it sounds like the all-too-familiar double standard:
Sure, it is okay if we do it, but if you do — wait just a
minute!
Cordovez suggests that freshmen should be barred
from living in theme houses because "it is too character
istic of ethnic.theme houses to take individuals who have

had limited exposure to other cultures and rather than
helping them to adjust to those other cultures, to in
stead encourage their removal and isolation." Nothing
could be further from the truth.
His first incorrect assumption is that the majority of
ethnic theme residents are isolationist, which is not true.
There are a few residents, both minority and non
minority. in several dorms and residences, not just theme
houses, who want to culturally isolate themselves. This is
not a problem exclusive to theme houses, nor is it caused
by them.
Cordovez's second misconception is that theme houses
do not help culturally limited freshmen adjust to other
cultures, but isolate them to their specific ethnic group.
If he had bothered to question the residents and/or resi
dent fellows at the ethnic residences, he would have
found that there are, in fact, minorities, who come from
ethnically isolated areas, who do live in theme houses in
their freshmen year because these residences help them
adjust to and learn to deal with a predominantly white
society.
Although these individuals' home areas may have been
culturally isolated, it is virtually impossible for them, or
any minorities, to avoid the vast majority of whites on
campus, unless they lock themselves in their rooms 24
hours a day. They consequently have to accept the chal
lenges of learning about other cultures, and theme
houses help these students, as well as others, with handl
