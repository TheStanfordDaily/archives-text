# Praying for solutions

### 
Conservatives are cry-babies. Every
time the courts make a decision that
they don't agree with, they start
whining about a constitutional
amendment. School prayer, abortion,
busing — what's next? A "John
Hinckley Wasn't Really Crazy
Amendment"?
School prayer gets talked about a
lot these days. Umpteen different
amendments have come before the
Senate recently, ranging from one
permitting "a moment of silence" to
the Jesse Helms amendment which
would mandate that students who
failed to accept Christ as their per
sonal savior would be burned at the
stake.
The most prominent advocate of
school prayer is President Reagan,
who hasn't been to church since June
of last year. Security reasons, he says.
Actually he doesn't have time to go
to church on Sundays because the
comics are a whole section long that
day.
Still, Reagan sees the value of
public prayer for everyone else.
Before, when people used to pray in
school, there was no communism and
everyone was happy. Then kids
stopped praying, Jimmv Carter
became president and communists
took over the world. The
cause/effect relationship is clear.
Reagan thinks a lot of the prob
lems that schools have today could be
solved by prayer. They sure aren't
going to be solved by money, because
after praying for all those aircraft
carriers, B-l bombers and
Peacekeeper missiles, there isn't any
left. On the other hand, how much
education do today's children need?
After all, they already know how to
fly fighter planes from playing video
games.
Another thing Reagan is big on for
the schools is discipline, as in corporal
punishment. It makes a good combi
nation: Through prayer, you can
teach children about the virtues of
love and forgiveness, and if that
doesn't work, you can beat them.
But we're getting off the subject.
Is God going to be allowed back in
the classroom? If so, will an om
nipresent being complicate atten
dance procedures?
None of the amendments seem like
they're going anywhere. Mostly
they're supported by the kind of
people who introduce bills calling for
a return to the gold standard and a

ban on backwards Satanic messages in
rock music. Even they can't agree on
whether the prayer should be spoken,
silent, or, as a compromise, per
formed by a mime troupe.
The Supreme Court is another
matter. Recently they said it would
be okay for a town in Rhode Island
to pay for a Christmas Nativity
scene. They said Nativity scenes were
secular and not religious. If that's
true, maybe they should replace the
animals with reindeer, have elves in
stead of shepherds and say that the
baby in the manger is Santa Claus as a
little kid.
The court is getting a lot less
worried about things like separation

Then kids stopped praying, Jimmy
Carter became president and

cause/effect relationship is clear.

of church and state. All the justices
appointed in the last 16 years have
been by Republican presidents, and
the liberals that are left are getting
to the age where people are usually
more concerned about condos in
Florida than the Bill of Rights.
These guys could check out any day
now — allowing Reagan to replace
them with judges who share his views
on school prayer, abortion and the
role of trees as a major cause of air
pollution.
Let's say a Reagan-packed court
does overturn rulings on school
prayer. Would that be so bad? Jerry
Falwell says "a little prayer never
hurt anybody." Of course, some
would say that he's a walking
counter-example to that assertion.
But maybe he has a point. Is there
really anything so dangerous in having
students say a few God-Bless-
Mommy-and-Daddys before their al
gebra class?
First of all, what kind of prayer are
we going to have the children say?
Reagan seems to think that a nice
generic Episcopalian prayer wouldn't
offend anyone. But this is no longer
the homogeneous land of backyards

that Reagan remembers from "Leave
It to Beaver." As likely as not, some
students are going to he members of
some exotic sect, like Islam. Bud
dhims, or Catholicism.
Sure, you could probably come up
with a prayer acceptable to the
majority. But look at it from the
minority's point of view. Suppose a
majority in this country were
Nietzscheans — does that mean that
little Bobby should have to proclaim
that God is dead along with the rest
of his class? Or if this country had an
Islamic majority — does that mean
Susie should be stoned for being an
adulteress, or because her play-suit
doesn't cover her face? 1 think not.

And then there is the idea that
this kind of prayer would he volun
tary. This is wrong. Next to termites,
kids are the most conformist
creatures imaginable. Even children
who don't have an E.T. lunch box are
branded as mutants. If a child went
so far as to refuse to pray "like
everybody else," no one would associ
ate with him, no matter how many
collectible Smurf action dolls he has.
Finally, there is the strategic ques
tion. Reagan thinks praying in
schools will get God on our side. The
Soviets are Godless communists, so
of course they can't pray. This will
give us an unfair advantage in the
arms race, which the Soviets will have
to compensate for by increasing the
fluoridation of our water. We would
then escalate by telling our kids to
pray that the evil empire ends up on
the ash-heap of history. The Soviets
would have no choice but to launch a
pre-emptive first strike.
At that point, I will have no objec
tions to prayer. I don't think we will
have too many other options.
