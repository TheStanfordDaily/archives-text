## Theme houses vital to University 
### 
We were disturbed to read Diego
Cordovez's column "Theme houses
need re-evaluation" (March 9), be
cause it indicated that ignorarlce in
the area of ethnic theme houses still
prevails on the Stantord campus.
It is too easy for the white
majority and other assimilators to sit
back and criticize the work and edu
cation that goes on in Ujamaa with-

VIEWPOINT

out knowing the facts. The residents
of Ujamaa are some of the most am
bitious students at Stanford because
they are daily challenged to learn and
confront racial and ethnic problems.
Cordovez's statement that stu
dents in Ujamaa are being channelled
into safer limiting environments is
untrue. For most of the non-blacks
and many of the black residents,
Ujamaa may provide the only oppor
tunities to be challenged on a cul
tural level.
As far av the question of isolation
is concerned. Ujamaa is 50 percent
non-black. Black residents cannot
escape association with whites even
if they wanted to.
Isolation becomes even more diffi
cult to accomplish when black stu
dents venture outside to attend
classes on a campus where they repre

sent less than 9 percent of the stu
dent body. Unfortunately, it is more
often the white student who is iso
lated. We cannot blame the Stanford
community for being uninformed —
only for remaining so while cultural
and educational opportunities are
offered by the ethnic theme houses.

Cultural diversity at Stanford usually means
three blacks in a dorm of 50 people. Blacks
are not here to add color to the Stanford
campus but are here to get an education.

So often when people speak of the
cross-cultural experience they mean
the assimilation of blacks into the
white community. Cultural diversity
at Stanford usually means three
blacks in a dorm of 50 people. Blacks
are not here to add color to the
Stanford campus but are here to get
an education. Blacks expect the same
comfort that white students receive
in their "white cultural theme
houses." For some blacks, that means
living around people with whom they
share a common ethnicity.
When Cordovez assumes that black

students entering Stanford are
"already very familiar" with black
culture and history he crosses the
• boundary into racism.
White students are required to
take Western Culture in order to
know more about white "culture. Cor
dovez must believe that black culture

is so simplistic as to be unworthy of
academic attention.
In Ujamaa, we explore the variety
of experience of blacks from differ
ent regions of the United States,
Africa, the Caribbean and South
America. No black student could au
tomatically be familiar with black
culture in its entirety. Thus, the edu
cational opportunities at Ujamaa
serve to broaden and enrich black
students' perspectives. Many black
students at Stanford come from all
white environments, and they espe
cially benefit from interacting with

other blacks.
Cordovez's opinion that theme
houses make only minimal efforts to
reach out to potentially interested
residents is false. We stress whole
house participation in all of our
events. We encourage blacks and
non-blacks to initiate and implement
activities that are of interest to
them.
In addition, we try whenever possi
ble to advertise our events cam
puswide so that anyone interested
can participate.
One purpose of Club Ujamaa is to
bring people from all over campus
into Ujamaa and make them feel
welcome. Anyone who wishes to gain
a greater sensitivity to and awareness
of the problems and joys of the black
community is encouraged to live in
Ujamaa.
In a telephone conversation, Cor
dovez admitted that he has never
lived in an ethnic theme house and
that he could not substantiate his
opinions. We do not appreciate this
reckless and, to a certain extent,*ir
responsible attack on institutions
that serve such vital educational and
social roles.
