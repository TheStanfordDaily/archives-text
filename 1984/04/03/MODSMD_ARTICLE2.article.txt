# No vehicles in Inner Quad
## 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
The Inner Quad renovation plan got underway yes
terday when the University banned all motor traffic
in the Quad to help create a more people-oriented at
mosphere, according to Facilities Project Manager
Max Mazenko.
"The first official act of improvement is the pre
vention of any motorized vehicle from entering the
Inner Quad Courtyard," Mazenko said. "We intend
these steps to be significant in transforming the
courtyard to the elegant people space we envision it
to be."
Starting next week, pavement samples will be ex
hibited in the Inner Quad to gather input from the
advisory committee to the restoration plan and the
Stanford community.
"More dust will begin to fly around the middle of
June when the actual paving gets underway,"
Mazenko said.
In keeping with the plan adopted February that
favors an historical, 19th-century renovation, vehicle
barriers (posts and bollards) have been put in place
that will permanently close the Inner Courtyard to all
motorized traffic, which includes any cars and motor
cycles or mopeds.
"The Inner Quad is meant to be strictly a
pedestrian area, just like a sidewalk," Mazenko
said,"and you certainly aren't allowed to drive on
sidewalks."
The amount of traffic in the Inner Quad has been
increasing steadily, according to Mazenko, and that is
largely the reason for the currently crumbling pave
ment.

"Half of the total construction costs for the res
toration project will be going towards the
repavement of the three acres of the Quad,"
Mazenko said, "and absolute closure is the only realis
tic way to bar vehicles from an area that was never in
tended for motor traffic."
The proposal to restrict vehicles from the
Courtyard has been strongly supported by most of
the Stanford community with the exception of the
U.S. Postal Service, which has balked at the barrier
plan.
"This move involves no serious inconvenience to
anyone. There is still a designated service corridor
that allows accessibility to every building. The only in
convenience, if it can be called that, is not being able
to drive to the front door of an office," Mazenko
said.
Mazenko said he has received no complaints about
the ban on motor traffic to the central campus area.
