## Golfers swing in spring tourneys 
### GEOFF SANBORN 
The Stanford men's and
women's golf teams met
with varying results in tour
naments held over spring
break. The men finished a
solid fourth in the Aztec In
vitational in Sa'n Diego be
hind the fine play of
sophomore Carl Wagner,
while the women struggled
to an eighth-place finish in
the Lady Mustang Roundup
in Dallas.
When asked to cite the
strongest West Coast golf
teams prior to last
weekend's Aztec Invita
tional, Stanford Men's Golf
Coach Tim Schaaf listed
USC, UCLA, San Diego
State and Stanford as the
four with the best chance
for NCAA tournament
bids, followed closely by
Fresno State, the Univer
sity of the Pacific, Arizona
State and Arizona.
And, sure enough, when
the tournament scores were
posted after a blustery final
day of play on Saturday, the
scoreboard read exactly in
that order: USC, UCLA,
San Diego State and Stan
ford, with Fresno State,
UOP and the Arizona
schools not far behind.
Schaaf said that he was
"pleased overall" with his
team's fourth-place finish,
as it kept them in the thick
of the hunt for the NCAA
bids.
Low scorer for Stanford
was Carl Wagner, a late re
placement for Josh Mondry.
Wagner finished 10 strokes
behind the tournament's in
dividual leader with rounds
of 76-72-S3 for a final tally
of 231. He was followed by
senior Lanny Sawchuck and
junior Scott Erickson, both
with scores of 233, senior
Tim Robinson with 237,
junior Doug Thompson with
239 and sophomore Don
Walsworth with 244.
The player's individual
finishes demonstrate what
Schaaf considers to be one
of the Stanford team's
greatest assets: that every
one in the lineup is capable
of contributing to the
team. "In other schools,
there is a sharp drop-off
after the first couple of

players," said Schaaf. "We
have an advantage in that
the bottom part of our
lineup is not far behind the
top two players — Erickson
and Robinson — in ability."
Wagner's strong showing
in San Diego bodes well for
Stanford's five remaining
tournaments, especially this
weekend's Stanford U.S. In
tercollegiate here at the
Stanford Golf Course.
These last five tourna
ments are very important to
Stanford's chances for an

NCAA bid. Last year, Stan
ford started slowly, and
despite two tournament
victories (including the
Stanford U.S. Intercol
legiate) and a third-place
finish in the Pac-10 Cham
pionships, the team was not
invited to the NCAA
Championships.
The-.memory of this near
miss has provided a
''definite inspiration" for

this year's team, according
to Schaaf. Although they
are actually in a stronger po
sition right now than last
year's group, the team is
eager to finish with a rush
and ensure their selection.
The results of the Aztec
Invitational did not signifi
cantly change Stanford's
position one way or the
other. Therefore Schaaf is
looking for a strong perfor
mance from his Cardinal
this weekend at home.
The women's golf team
did not spend the best of

spring breaks in Dallas last
week, coming in only eighth
out of 12 teams in the Lady
Mustang Roundup held on
March 28-30.
"It was a disappointing
performance," said Coach
Tim Baldwin, "not one of
the players was on her
game." Indeed, the best in
dividual finish was a .tie. for
20th place between sopho-.
more Kathv Kostas and

freshman standout Kathy
McCarthy at 237. Following
at a distance were junior
Diane Nixon at 245, and
junior Kathy Nino and
freshman Julie Carmichael
at 249.
Despite these numbers,
there was a positive side to
the Cardinal's performance.
The tournament field con
sisted of 12 of the best
teams in the country, and
Stanford's women stood in
fifth place after two days
of play. The eighth-place
finish is deceiving as well —
Stanford wound up only
eight shots out of fourth
place and seven shots out of
fifth.
But Baldwin's expecta
tions were higher. "We had
hoped for third, and we had
the opportunity to get
there," said the fifth-year
coach. In all probability, the
NCAA will give only two
tournament bids to the Far
West region, and a third
place finish in such a strong
national tournament as the
Lady Mustang Roundup
would have done a great
deal to improve Stanford's
position.
All season long, Stanford
and Arizona State have
been the top two teams in
the region, and remain the
two most probable selec
tions to the NCAA cham
pionships. But, Baldwin
warned, there is still a
strong threat to Stanford
from the United States In
ternational University,
Brigham Young, San Jose
, State and UCLA.
The Cardinal's two
remaining tournaments —
the Lady Sun Devil in
Phoenix on April 16-18 and
the WCAA Championships
in San Diego on April 25-27
— are crucial to the team's
hopes.
"I'm confident that the
girls will really get back into
their games," said Baldwin.
"This loss is not really going
to hurt, but it didn't help."
If both the men's and wo
men's teams manage to help
themselves in their remain
ing tournaments, both
Stand a good chance of
paying NCAA Cham
pionships in May.

with scores of 233, senior
Tim Robinson with 237,
junior Doug Thompson with
239 and sophomore Don
Walsworth with 244.
The player's individual
finishes demonstrate what
Schaaf considers to be one
of the Stanford team's
greatest assets: that every
one in the lineup is capable
of contributing to the
team. "In other schools,
there is a sharp drop-off
after the first couple of

players," said Schaaf. "We
have an advantage in that
the bottom part of our
lineup is not far behind the
top two players — Erickson
and Robinson — in ability."
Wagner's strong showing
in San Diego bodes well for
Stanford's five remaining
tournaments, especially this
weekend's Stanford U.S. In
tercollegiate here at the
Stanford Golf Course.
These last five tourna
ments are very important to
Stanford's chances for an

NCAA bid. Last year, Stan
ford started slowly, and
despite two tournament
victories (including the
Stanford U.S. Intercol
legiate) and a third-place
finish in the Pac-10 Cham
pionships, the team was not
invited to the NCAA
Championships.
The-.memory of this near
miss has provided a
''definite inspiration" for

this year's team, according
to Schaaf. Although they
are actually in a stronger po
sition right now than last
year's group, the team is
eager to finish with a rush
and ensure their selection.
The results of the Aztec
Invitational did not signifi
cantly change Stanford's
position one way or the
other. Therefore Schaaf is
looking for a strong perfor
mance from his Cardinal
this weekend at home.
The women's golf team
did not spend the best of

spring breaks in Dallas last
week, coming in only eighth
out of 12 teams in the Lady
Mustang Roundup held on
March 28-30.
"It was a disappointing
performance," said Coach
Tim Baldwin, "not one of
the players was on her
game." Indeed, the best in
dividual finish was a .tie. for
20th place between sopho-.
more Kathv Kostas and

freshman standout Kathy
McCarthy at 237. Following
at a distance were junior
Diane Nixon at 245, and
junior Kathy Nino and
freshman Julie Carmichael
at 249.
Despite these numbers,
there was a positive side to
the Cardinal's performance.
The tournament field con
sisted of 12 of the best
teams in the country, and
Stanford's women stood in
fifth place after two days
of play. The eighth-place
finish is deceiving as well —
Stanford wound up only
eight shots out of fourth
place and seven shots out of
fifth.
But Baldwin's expecta
tions were higher. "We had
hoped for third, and we had
the opportunity to get
there," said the fifth-year
coach. In all probability, the
NCAA will give only two
tournament bids to the Far
West region, and a third
place finish in such a strong
national tournament as the
Lady Mustang Roundup
would have done a great
deal to improve Stanford's
position.
All season long, Stanford
and Arizona State have
been the top two teams in
the region, and remain the
two most probable selec
tions to the NCAA cham
pionships. But, Baldwin
warned, there is still a
strong threat to Stanford
from the United States In
ternational University,
Brigham Young, San Jose
, State and UCLA.
The Cardinal's two
remaining tournaments —
the Lady Sun Devil in
Phoenix on April 16-18 and
the WCAA Championships
in San Diego on April 25-27
— are crucial to the team's
hopes.
"I'm confident that the
girls will really get back into
their games," said Baldwin.
"This loss is not really going
to hurt, but it didn't help."
If both the men's and wo
men's teams manage to help
themselves in their remain
ing tournaments, both
Stand a good chance of
paying NCAA Cham
pionships in May.

Senior Cardinal golf team member Tim Robinson concen
trated intensely to finish with a 237 in the Aztec Invita
tional in San Diego.
The Stanford men's and
women's golf teams met
with varying results in tour
naments held over spring
break. The men finished a
solid fourth in the Aztec In
vitational in Sa'n Diego be
hind the fine play of
sophomore Carl Wagner,
while the women struggled
to an eighth-place finish in
the Lady Mustang Roundup
in Dallas.
When asked to cite the
strongest West Coast golf
teams prior to last
weekend's Aztec Invita
tional, Stanford Men's Golf
Coach Tim Schaaf listed
USC, UCLA, San Diego
State and Stanford as the
four with the best chance
for NCAA tournament
bids, followed closely by
Fresno State, the Univer
sity of the Pacific, Arizona
State and Arizona.
And, sure enough, when
the tournament scores were
posted after a blustery final
day of play on Saturday, the
scoreboard read exactly in
that order: USC, UCLA,
San Diego State and Stan
ford, with Fresno State,
UOP and the Arizona
schools not far behind.
Schaaf said that he was
"pleased overall" with his
team's fourth-place finish,
as it kept them in the thick
of the hunt for the NCAA
bids.
Low scorer for Stanford
was Carl Wagner, a late re
placement for Josh Mondry.
Wagner finished 10 strokes
behind the tournament's in
dividual leader with rounds
of 76-72-S3 for a final tally
of 231. He was followed by
senior Lanny Sawchuck and
junior Scott Erickson, both
with scores of 233, senior
Tim Robinson with 237,
junior Doug Thompson with
239 and sophomore Don
Walsworth with 244.
