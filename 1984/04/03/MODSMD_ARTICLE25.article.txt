# Georgetown wins title
## 
### 
Seattle (AP) â€” Georgetown's
depth paid off in its first
NCAA basketball champion
ship last night as freshman
reserves Reggie Williams and
Michael Graham led the way in
an 84-75 victory over Houston.
The dream matchup between
the two 7-foot Ail-Americans,
Georgetown's Patrick Ewing
and Houston's Akeem
Olajuwon, was never a key.
Both were in foul trouble much
of the game and played
cautiously.
It marked the second
straight time Coach Guy
Lewis' Cougars lost the cham
pionship game, having been up
set by North Carolina State
54-52 last year. Houston also
reached the Final Four in 1967,
'68 and '81.
Georgetown Coach John
Thompson and his players
embraced joyfully as the final
seconds ticked off, the
memories of a runner-up finish
to North Carolina in the 1982
final wiped away.
On the Houston bench,
Olajuwon and his Cougar
teammates sobbed as time ran
out.
Williams, a slender 6-7
swingman, scored 13 of his 19
points in the second half and
Graham, a burly 6-9 forward,
got 10 of his 14 points in the
second half. The freshmen

combined for 11 of Geor
getown's 15 field goals after
intermission.
Georgetown had three other
players in double figures, led by
David Wingate with 16 points.
Most of his eight second-half
points came on free-throws
down the stretch. Michael
Jackson had 11 points and
Ewing added 10.
Sophomore guard Alvin
Franklin, who kept Houston in
the game after the intermis
sion, was the top scorer with 21
points, followed by Michael
Young with 18 and Olajuwon
with 15.
The depth of the Hoyas, who
finished 34-3, was never more
evident than in the final 7:35
of the first half. Ewing was on
the bench with two fouls, while
Olajuwon picked up his second
and third personals. Olajuwon
picked up his fourth foul less
than a minute into the second
half, and played tentatively
the rest of the way.
In winning their 11 th
straight game and 21st of the
last 22, the second-ranked
Hoyas culminated the rebuild
ing program that Thompson
began when he took over a 3-23
club in 1972. The former back
up center for the Boston Cel
tics has been criticized for
some of his tactics on and off
the court, but he said after the

championship victory that
"the bottom line is that my
kids graduate.
"I don't have a problem with
people criticizing us," he said.
"I'm not concerned with my
critics.
"I'm elated about winning
the championship," Thompson
continued, "but the hardest
thing is to get here. Anyone
can win one game."
For a while, it looked as if it
would be Houston winning
that elusive "one game."
The Cougars, 32-5, hit their
first seven shots, including
three field goals by Young and
two by Reid Gettys to take a
14-6 lead. But Georgetown
came back to tie it at 14 and
again at 16 before taking the
lead for good.
The Hoyas went into the
locker room leading 40-30 at
halftime behind a basket by
Jackson and two by Wingate.
They led by 12 twice early in
the second half, the last at 44-
32 before Olajuwon connected.
While the Nigerian Ail-
American was sitting down for
six minutes. Franklin picked up
the slack with his jumper cut
ting the Georgetown margin to
51-47 with 13:56 to play.
Franklin continued to drive the
middle but the shooting of
Williams and Graham held off
the Southwest Conference
champions.
