I he Escondido Elementary School
continues to provide a little melting
pot here on campus for the children
of graduate students from all over
the world, according to school prin
cipal Harold Jones.
"I really appreciate how the par
ents have managed to keep political
views and prejudices from their
children. I have been here 10 years
and there have never been any prob
lems within the student body."
Jones said there is a "complete lack
of any political conflict among the
students."
About 48 percent of the students,
representing 47 different nation
alities, are minorities, according to
Jones.
In 1983, about 40 percent of the
3000 people living in Escondido Vil
lage were foreigners.
Most of the minority students are
the children of graduate students

here, Jones said. "Although the ratio
is very high for a typical school, this is
not a typical school. This is an inter
national school, located near one of
the most internationally well-known
universities.
"We have a very positive image
about our minority population,"
Jones said. "We're very happy they're
here. People want their children in a
school like this â€” it's quite unique.
It's a very rich environment."
In a student body of 350, approxi
mately 80 enter the school unable to
speak English, he said. "By the end of
their first year here, they can all
speak English." The school offers a
course in English as a second lan
guage, as well as Spanish and Por
tuguese language classes.
Most of the international
students only attend the school,
which teaches grades kindergarten
through sixth, for one or two years,
although a few remain for five or six
years, said Jones.

Patricia Eintalt, assistant to the
superintendent of the Palo Alto
Unified School District, said the
percentage of minority students
"appears to he a very high percentage
since the overall district percentage
is only 14.4.
Ordinarily, the school hoard would
become concerned about a 30 per
cent minority population. However,
the board has felt very comfortable
with Escondido's figures.
This satisfaction is due in large
part to the fluctuating, transient
nature of the minority population,
said Einfalt. "Next year the
percentage could be 30, or it could be
50," she said.
Although there is no clear-cut
nationality majority, according to
Jones, the most prevalent
nationalities are Japanese, Por
tuguese, Spanish and Chinese. The
school also boasts of students from
such places as Cameroon, Africa and
the Soviet Union, Jones said.
