# Segal sculpture to be reinstalled
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Artist George Segal's repaired
"Gay Liberation" sculpture is cur
rently in storage here awaiting the
Outdoor Art Panel's certain approval
for reinstallation, according to Law
School Prof. John Merryman, chair
man of the committee.
Merryman said the panel will meet
Monday to determine "when and un
der what circumstances" to reinstall
the sculpture which was repaired in
New Jersey. "It will be reinstalled im
mediately," he said, "most likely to
its original site, but we will consider
alternate locations."
Merryman and Director of Risk
Management Robert Beth both
refused to say how much the repairs
cost the University.
The repairs were made by the New
Jersey group that made the original
cast which has been valued at
$150,000.
On the evening of March 6, a van
dal struck the four figures in the
sculpture more than 40 times with a
ballpeen hammer, inflicting damage
to both the white outer layer and
the main body of the bronze cast and

forcing University officials to
remove the work.
Meanwhile, University Police are
still working to find the vandal, ac
cording to an informed source who
asked not to be identified. The
source said detectives hit a dead end
recently when a prime suspect cleared
himself in a polygraph examination
administered by the State Depart
ment of Justice and could not be
identified by the chief witness.
The source called the hunt a "top
priority case" on which the "whole
detective bureau" is working.
But he said the detectives have
little to work with at the moment,
naming the only clues as marks left
by a ballpeen hammer which police
never found, a witness' testimony
that has thus far turned up nothing,
and possibly fingerprints on the
sculpture itself.
Senior Gil Ureno described the
man as a tall, young caucasian male
with a beard. The suspect is also
believed to be blond-haired, and
police have estimated his age at 25.
Ureno said he saw the vandal
leaving the scene with a hammer in
his hand at about 7:40 p.m.
Members of the Stanford commu
nity and the Gay and Lesbian Al
liance at Stanford placed more than
100 flowers on the former site of the
sculpture after it was removed to
protest the vandal's actions.

A sign asked community members
to place flowers on the site "to
protest this act of homophobic vio
lence."
The work is on indefinite loan
from the Mildred Andrews Fund un
til it is approved for installation in
the Harvey Milk Plaza in San Fran
cisco. The only other cast is currently
in a traveling exhibition on the East
Coast.
Segal has said that the sculpture

•stresses our common humanity."
After receiving unanimous ap
proval from the University's Panel on
Outdoor Art, the University Com
mittee on Land and Building, and
University President Donald Ken
nedy, Segal's sculpture was installed
Feb. 21 on a lawn just west of the
Mathematics Department.
University police are still searching
for witnesses to the crime or anyone
possessing information that will help
them identify the culprit.
