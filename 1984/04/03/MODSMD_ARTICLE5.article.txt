### KAREN BOLLERMANN Staff writer 
Stanford Bookstore officials still do not know
how anti-Semitic advertisements were inserted
among the books for History Prof. Mark Man
call's "History of Zionist Thought" colloquium
last quarter.
According to Bookstore paperback buyer John
Seib. "one of the clerks brought a copy of the ad
vertisement to me and reported that a customer
had found it in a book in the Radical Thinkers
section. 1 'went through some of the books and
removed the advertisements, and then reported
the incident to Bookstore security."
The flyers, which are distributed by Liberty
Bell Publications' of West Virginia, advertise
"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of /ion." a
pamphlet purporting to prove that "Jews are
conspiring to take over the world by subverting
Christianity " according to John Reider. head of
the Structured Liberal Education program.

"The pamphlet was actually written by the
Czar's secret police before World War I to en
courage violence against Jews. Hitler used the
pamphlet again for similar reasons during World
War 11. As evidenced by its appearance in the
Bookstore, the pamphlet is still widely circulated
and read." said Reider.
Lynda Benjamin, head of Bookstore security,
received Seib's report on the advertisements and
investigated the incident. "We still don't know
how they got into the books. We removed the
advertisements and have kept a close eye on that
section, hut there's not much that we can do.

too many people," Benjamin said.
Meanwhile, Reider conducted his own investi
gation. "I sent a dollar to Liberty Bell Publica
tions. under the pretense of being sympathetic
to their cause, requesting more information
about the organization," he said.
"I learned that the organization is run by a
well-known anti-Semite. George Dietz. Diet/, is a
native German and professed Nazi. He is also one
of the largest distributors of anti-Semitic
literature in the nation. I also requested infor
mation on a Bay Area contact, but received no
subsequent information."
