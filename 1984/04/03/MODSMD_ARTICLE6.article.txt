China sends arms to Iran
Peking — China has covertly supplied Iran with combat
aircraft and other military equipment in sales tunneled
through North Korea since the Iranian-Iraqi war began, ac
cording to foreign military sources here.
At the same time, China reportedly has been selling lesser
amounts of arms to Iraq.
Iran, having difficulty replenishing its battered war ma
chine, has reportedly paid handsomely for the Chinese
supplies. One deal last spring netted China $1.3 billion for
J6 fighters, T59 tanks, 130-mm artillery and light arms to
be delivered over a three-year period, according to Arab and
Asian sources.
Iran also agreed to give China access to the latest Soviet
weapons it captures from Iraqi troops, said the sources.
Most estimates of the number of J6s now in Iran range
from 50 to 60. According to one European analyst, China
already has sold 100 ot the 1950s vintage jets to Iran. He
said about 300 North Korean advisers have been sent to
Tehran to help install equipment arriving in Iran by ship
from Pyongyang.
Peking has kept the weapons deals with Iran secret to
avoid alienating the Arab world and to protect it from
charges of prolonging the 3V2-year conflict, sources said.
Publicly, China backs mediation efforts and denies selling
arms to either side.
Court upholds prayer ban
Washington — The Supreme Court reaffirmed yesterday
that prayer recitations in the nation's public schools are un
constitutional but agreed to consider whether a period of
silent prayer or meditation in the classroom might be per
missible.
The justices, acting in a much-heralded test case from Al
abama, unanimously indicated they would stand by the
precedents of the early 1960s declaring prayer recitations
or Bible readings in the public schools to be an unconstitu
tional establishment of religion. Advocates of school prayer
and Alabama Gov. George Wallace had pleaded with the
court to reconsider these rulings.
However, the court went along with requests that it rule
on the validity of an officially sponsored "moment of
silence" during the public school day, a brief period in which
children who wanted to pray might quietly do so.
Alabama is one of at least 23 states that have enacted
laws authorizing or requiring daily moments of silence in the
public schools, according to a survey last December by the
Department of Justice. The Supreme Court has never
decided whether such laws are constitutional, and the lower
courts have issued conflicting rulings on the subject.
Senate defeats 2 amendments
to Salvador aid proposal
Washington — By margins of more than 2-to-l, the Sen
ate defeated two amendments to the Reagan administra
tion's request for $61.8 million in emergency military aid
for El Salvador that would have significantly reduced the
amount of that aid.
A proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) to provide
$21 million to the embattled Central American nation was
defeated by a vote of 63 to 25. Similarly, a second amend
ment to the administration request, a plan by Sen. John
Melcher (D-Mont.) to provide a total of $35.4 million in
aid, lost 63 to 24.
In six hours of debate, a handful of Republicans backed
the efforts to slash the amount of aid while conservative
Democrats stood with the administration.
The $21 million contained in Kennedy's amendment
would have been enough to supply the Salvadoran military
only through next month, when a runoff will determine
whether centrist Jose Napoleon Duarte or rightist Roberto
D'Aubuisson is the winner of the Salvadoran presidential
election. The administration has contended that the Sal
vadoran army is dangerously close to running out of
supplies.
Kennedy appealed to the Senate to withhold aid from El
Salvador should a D'Aubuisson government emerge as the
winner in the election.
But Sen. John East (R-N.C.) a consistent backer of ad
ministration policy, denounced that threat as "sheer, un
abashed dollar diplomacy in its rankest form. What we are
saying is that 'You are free to have an election as long as
the result is what we want.' "
Anti-satellite talks ruled out
Washington — President Reagan, accusing the Kremlin of
proposing a treaty that would give the Soviet Union an ad
vantage in the militarization of space, yesterday ruled out
any negotiation aimed at a comprehensive U.S.-Soviet ban
on anti-satellite weapons.
Reagan's decision, spelled out in a report to Congress, was
greeted with an apparent sense of resignation by leading
congressional opponents of the United States' program for
development of anti-satellite weapons.
"The president has got Congress scared," said Rep. Paul
Tsongas (D-Mass.), author of an existing provision restrict
ing the United States from .testing an anti-satellite
weapon against a target in space until it has proved that it
is trying in good faith to negotiate a ban. "Republicans will
support him on national security grounds, and Democrats
don't want to take the president on because they don't
want to get blamed for anything."
New York campaign intensifies
New ork — Walter Mondale, Gary Hart and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson toured New York yesterday in a frantic, final
day of campaigning for today's state Democratic presiden
tial primary — the biggest prize so far in the "red-hot" race
for the party's nomination.
Former Vice President Mondale, the leader in the polls,
visited several upstate cities, where he appealed for support
on the basis of a "lifetime of public service ... I'm not a
guess-what candidate who just shows up on the scene today
and asks for your votes," he said in an obvious, though
unnamed reference to Hart.
I he Colorado Senator, also campaigning upstate,
counter-attacked on "special interests" and campaign con
tributions. "We cannot elect a president to reform the
campaign finance laws of this nation who goes into office
beholden to those special interest groups who have financed
his campaign on that basis," he said.
Jackson, hoping for a strong turnout among black and
Hispanic voters in New York City, campaigned in Harlem
and Brooklyn.
"We will clean the garbage off our streets," he said. "We
will take the handguns off the streets."

China sends arms to Iran
Peking — China has covertly supplied Iran with combat
aircraft and other military equipment in sales tunneled
through North Korea since the Iranian-Iraqi war began, ac
cording to foreign military sources here.
At the same time, China reportedly has been selling lesser
amounts of arms to Iraq.
Iran, having difficulty replenishing its battered war ma
chine, has reportedly paid handsomely for the Chinese
supplies. One deal last spring netted China $1.3 billion for
J6 fighters, T59 tanks, 130-mm artillery and light arms to
be delivered over a three-year period, according to Arab and
Asian sources.
Iran also agreed to give China access to the latest Soviet
weapons it captures from Iraqi troops, said the sources.
Most estimates of the number of J6s now in Iran range
from 50 to 60. According to one European analyst, China
already has sold 100 ot the 1950s vintage jets to Iran. He
said about 300 North Korean advisers have been sent to
Tehran to help install equipment arriving in Iran by ship
from Pyongyang.
Peking has kept the weapons deals with Iran secret to
avoid alienating the Arab world and to protect it from
charges of prolonging the 3V2-year conflict, sources said.
Publicly, China backs mediation efforts and denies selling
arms to either side.
Court upholds prayer ban
Washington — The Supreme Court reaffirmed yesterday
that prayer recitations in the nation's public schools are un
constitutional but agreed to consider whether a period of
silent prayer or meditation in the classroom might be per
missible.
The justices, acting in a much-heralded test case from Al
abama, unanimously indicated they would stand by the
precedents of the early 1960s declaring prayer recitations
or Bible readings in the public schools to be an unconstitu
tional establishment of religion. Advocates of school prayer
and Alabama Gov. George Wallace had pleaded with the
court to reconsider these rulings.
However, the court went along with requests that it rule
on the validity of an officially sponsored "moment of
silence" during the public school day, a brief period in which
children who wanted to pray might quietly do so.
Alabama is one of at least 23 states that have enacted
laws authorizing or requiring daily moments of silence in the
public schools, according to a survey last December by the
Department of Justice. The Supreme Court has never
decided whether such laws are constitutional, and the lower
courts have issued conflicting rulings on the subject.
Senate defeats 2 amendments
to Salvador aid proposal
Washington — By margins of more than 2-to-l, the Sen
ate defeated two amendments to the Reagan administra
tion's request for $61.8 million in emergency military aid
for El Salvador that would have significantly reduced the
amount of that aid.
A proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) to provide
$21 million to the embattled Central American nation was
defeated by a vote of 63 to 25. Similarly, a second amend
ment to the administration request, a plan by Sen. John
Melcher (D-Mont.) to provide a total of $35.4 million in
aid, lost 63 to 24.
In six hours of debate, a handful of Republicans backed
the efforts to slash the amount of aid while conservative
Democrats stood with the administration.
The $21 million contained in Kennedy's amendment
would have been enough to supply the Salvadoran military
only through next month, when a runoff will determine
whether centrist Jose Napoleon Duarte or rightist Roberto
D'Aubuisson is the winner of the Salvadoran presidential
election. The administration has contended that the Sal
vadoran army is dangerously close to running out of
supplies.
Kennedy appealed to the Senate to withhold aid from El
Salvador should a D'Aubuisson government emerge as the
winner in the election.
But Sen. John East (R-N.C.) a consistent backer of ad
ministration policy, denounced that threat as "sheer, un
abashed dollar diplomacy in its rankest form. What we are
saying is that 'You are free to have an election as long as
the result is what we want.' "
Anti-satellite talks ruled out
Washington — President Reagan, accusing the Kremlin of
proposing a treaty that would give the Soviet Union an ad
vantage in the militarization of space, yesterday ruled out
any negotiation aimed at a comprehensive U.S.-Soviet ban
on anti-satellite weapons.
Reagan's decision, spelled out in a report to Congress, was
greeted with an apparent sense of resignation by leading
congressional opponents of the United States' program for
development of anti-satellite weapons.
"The president has got Congress scared," said Rep. Paul
Tsongas (D-Mass.), author of an existing provision restrict
ing the United States from .testing an anti-satellite
weapon against a target in space until it has proved that it
is trying in good faith to negotiate a ban. "Republicans will
support him on national security grounds, and Democrats
don't want to take the president on because they don't
want to get blamed for anything."
New York campaign intensifies
New ork — Walter Mondale, Gary Hart and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson toured New York yesterday in a frantic, final
day of campaigning for today's state Democratic presiden
tial primary — the biggest prize so far in the "red-hot" race
for the party's nomination.
Former Vice President Mondale, the leader in the polls,
visited several upstate cities, where he appealed for support
on the basis of a "lifetime of public service ... I'm not a
guess-what candidate who just shows up on the scene today
and asks for your votes," he said in an obvious, though
unnamed reference to Hart.
I he Colorado Senator, also campaigning upstate,
counter-attacked on "special interests" and campaign con
tributions. "We cannot elect a president to reform the
campaign finance laws of this nation who goes into office
beholden to those special interest groups who have financed
his campaign on that basis," he said.
Jackson, hoping for a strong turnout among black and
Hispanic voters in New York City, campaigned in Harlem
and Brooklyn.
"We will clean the garbage off our streets," he said. "We
will take the handguns off the streets."
