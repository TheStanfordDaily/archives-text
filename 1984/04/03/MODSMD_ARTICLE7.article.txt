intersection in predominately Jewish
West Jerusalem.
One of the attackers was killed in a
hail of answering lire from the owners
and customers of nearby shops. The
other two assailants were arrested by
police a short time later.
Two Palestinian groups claimed re
sponsibility for the attack.
Prime 'Minister Yitzhak Shamir

vowed that the perpetrators of the
crime and the organizations that sent
them "will be punished to the full ex
tent of the law."
Shamir, who was briefed on the at
tack while on an inspection tour of
army headquarters, said, "Today they
managed to kill, to cut down and to
massacre." Israel police said, however,
that the only fatality was the attacker.
Of the wounded. 14 required
hospitalization. One was reported to be
in serious condition and 34 were given
first aid and sent home.
According to police and eyewitness

accounts, the three attackers arrived at
the busy corner of King George \
Street and Jaffa Road, the commercial
heart of West Jerusalem, in a rented car
shortly before 10 a.m. in bright and
sunny spring weather.
Two of the men entered a sporting
goods store and asked to try on jeans.
Moments later, they emerged trom a
fitting room with weapons drawn and
began shooting and throwing grenades.
The third man. who had remained
outside of the store, also produced a
weapon and joined in the attack.

Nearby shopowners and their custom
ers returned the tire — many Israelis
routinely carry weapons — and, accor
ding to some accounts, some of the
wounded may have been caught in a
crossfire.
One of the wounded. Dr. Ephraini
Elazeri, told Israel radio: "It seemed
like a Wild West show. Everyone was
shooting at everyone else. I didn't know
who were the villains and who were the
heroes. Then police started coming
along and shooting, running down the
street."
