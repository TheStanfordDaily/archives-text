## 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
Washington — Jacob Stein, a veteran defense
lawyer who won the only acquittal in the Watergate
cover-up trial, yesterday was named independent
counsel to investigate a wide range of allegations
against Attorney General-designate Edwin Meese, in
cluding Meese's failure to disclose a loan from an as
sociate who later landed federal jobs.
In selecting Stein, 59, a special panel of judges in
Washington gave him broad jurisdiction recommend
ed by Attorney General William French Smith.
Among other matters. Stein will examine the federal

appointments of several persons who helped Meese
financially. Meese's transfer and promotion in the
Army Reserve, his stock trading and his sworn state
ments on the use of Jimmy Carter's campaign materi
als by President Reagan's campaign staff.
Stein, praised by fellow Washington attorneys as an
extremely thorough lawyer, served as president of the
District of Columbia Bar Association in 1968-69 and
has taught trial practice at several law schools.
Several of his associates described Stein as apoliti
cal.
"I don't think Jake concerns himself with politics,"

said Plato Cacheris, a criminal defense attorney who
has known and traveled with Stein for years. "That's
why he's a great choice."
Cacheris and others said that Stein could success
fully resist any pressure to wrap up the Meese investi
gation quickly. "He will do it the right way," Cacheris
said.
In naming Stein, the three judges in the special divi
sion of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington gave
him the powers to go to a federal grand jury, including
the right to take sworn testimony and subpoena ma
terials and to seek immunity for witnesses.
