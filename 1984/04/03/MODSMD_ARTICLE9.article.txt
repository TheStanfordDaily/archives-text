## Blind students overcome obstacles most never face 
### DANA RATLIFF 
Cross your eyes. Close one
eye. Now close both. You have
just experienced momentary
visual difficulty, visual impair
ment and blindness. Now imag
ine having one of these
conditions permanently —
every hour, day and month of
the year.
Thirteen students here are
self-identified as being visually
impaired. There are probably
more who have never declared
their sight disability. Senior
Nora Honorahowell, a student
who has sight in only one eye
offered some insight into the
plight of the blind student at
Stanford. "I don't really feel
that I have a handicap. My
family has never made any issue
of it whatsoever.
"When I was very young I
was taunted by other children
because of the looks of my bad
eye. To little kids, looks are
very important. So when I was
four, I got a prosthesis, which
is like a large contact lens that
is a little thicker,"
Honorahowell said, "I am very
fortunate to have one eye that
sees very well."

Honorahowell explains her
perception of blindness in one
eye. "It's like a birthmark that
causes only slight discomfort
once in a while . . . like when I
have been reading for hours.

Honorahowell was in varsity
sports through high school and
found that the only time she
was aware of her visual impair
ment was when she was in left
field and the ball was coming
towards her. "Because of my
problems with depth percep
tion, I was never quite sure
where the ball was and I just
had to hope that it wouldn't
hit me in the face," she said.
Another student, senior
Connie Conley, has been par
tially blind since birth. She has
no sight in one eye and only
partial sight in the other.
Conley said that people's ini
tial reaction to the visually im
paired is usually one of two
extremes. "A lot of people
think that you are either to
tally blind or that you can see
really great," Conley said.
"Usually it is not obvious to
other people that I cannot see

very well until they see me put
a paper up really close to my
face to read it. They say,
"Don't your wear glasses?' Then
1 have to explain to them that
glasses really wouldn't help.
"Sometimes it can be
frustrating, but people are
pretty open around here. The
only real trouble I had was in
eighth grade. If you deviated
at all from all the other kids,
you felt like a freak. They can
be pretty mean . . . but when I
got to high school it was a
total turn-around. People were
a lot more mature."
When asked about the reac
tions of other Stanford stu
dents to her disability, she said,
"People are receptive to new
things. Once you answer their
questions, they are not going
to be nervous. The only person
who has ever seemed ap
prehensive was a reporter wo
man who interviewed me for
the Times Tribune. 1 think it
made her nervous to think that
1 was legally blind and yet I
could ski."
