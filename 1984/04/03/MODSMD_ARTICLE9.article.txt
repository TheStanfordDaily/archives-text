## Blind students overcome obstacles most never face 
### DANA RATLIFF 
Cross your eyes. Close one
eye. Now close both. You have
just experienced momentary
visual difficulty, visual impair
ment and blindness. Now imag
ine having one of these
conditions permanently —
every hour, day and month of
the year.
Thirteen students here are
self-identified as being visually
impaired. There are probably
more who have never declared
their sight disability. Senior
Nora Honorahowell, a student
who has sight in only one eye
offered some insight into the
plight of the blind student at
Stanford. "I don't really feel
that I have a handicap. My
family has never made any issue
of it whatsoever.
"When I was very young I
was taunted by other children
because of the looks of my bad
eye. To little kids, looks are
very important. So when I was
four, I got a prosthesis, which
is like a large contact lens that
is a little thicker,"
Honorahowell said, "I am very
fortunate to have one eye that
sees very well."

Honorahowell explains her
perception of blindness in one
eye. "It's like a birthmark that
causes only slight discomfort
once in a while . . . like when I
have been reading for hours.

to go on to get her Ph.D..
Honorahowell was in varsity
sports through high school and
found that the only time she
was aware of her visual impair
ment was when she was in left
field and the ball was coming
towards her. "Because of my
problems with depth percep
tion, I was never quite sure
where the ball was and I just
had to hope that it wouldn't
hit me in the face," she said.
Another student, senior
Connie Conley, has been par
tially blind since birth. She has
no sight in one eye and only
partial sight in the other.
Conley said that people's ini
tial reaction to the visually im
paired is usually one of two
extremes. "A lot of people
think that you are either to
tally blind or that you can see
really great," Conley said.
"Usually it is not obvious to
other people that I cannot see

very well until they see me put
a paper up really close to my
face to read it. They say,
"Don't your wear glasses?' Then
1 have to explain to them that
glasses really wouldn't help.
"Sometimes it can be
frustrating, but people are
pretty open around here. The
only real trouble I had was in
eighth grade. If you deviated
at all from all the other kids,
you felt like a freak. They can
be pretty mean . . . but when I
got to high school it was a
total turn-around. People were
a lot more mature."
When asked about the reac
tions of other Stanford stu
dents to her disability, she said,
"People are receptive to new
things. Once you answer their
questions, they are not going
to be nervous. The only person
who has ever seemed ap
prehensive was a reporter wo
man who interviewed me for
the Times Tribune. 1 think it
made her nervous to think that
1 was legally blind and yet I
could ski."

nationally after competing in
the special Olympics last Janu
ary in Austria.
"I started skiing when I was
nine," said Conley," I was never
afraid because I always skied
with another person and never
knew it was supposed to be
harder for someone like me.
When I ski, I use my hearing a
lot and rely on my guide who is
going down the slopes in front
of me. I can't see the moguls,
so I can only watch if my guide
is going up and down a lot.
That is about as much as I can
hope to anticipate.''
As in sports, Conley must al
ways work a little harder than
the average student. In terms
of academics, she said, "the
work takes longer to read. It is
a real chore for someone like
me. I rely on Recordings For
The Blind in Palo Alto; there
arc also student readers. In my
room I have a visual aid that
looks like a TV. ... I can put
material under a camera and
see the words on the screen.
Then I can adjust the mag
nification and follow along
with the tapes so that I can
make notes on the text if I
want."
Often seen walking on
campus with her seeing-eye
dog, sophomore Michelle Kar
now is nearly completely blind
except for light and dark sensi
tivity.

Karnow explained that there
were no speeial accommoda
tions that had to be made in
her dorm. "There were only
small matters of common cour
tesy; like not leaving hikes
parked in the already narrow
paths that would make it diffi
cult for me to get around
easily," she said.
Most students here probably
recognize Karnow as one of the
only people around with a
seeing-eye dog. "Mary is my
first dog and I've had her for
about two years now. Before 1
got her I used a folding cane.
There are advantages and dis
advantages to both. With a
dog, you are responsible for
feeding it and taking care of it,
but it provides companionship
that the cane cannot," Karnow
said.
"If you talked to your dog
no one would notice," explains
Karnow, "but if you talked to
your cane, people would think
you were crazy. Having the dog
is like having to care for a little
kid. Not only does she need to
eat, and relieve herself occa
sionally, but she also tests me
to sec if she can do something
today that she wasn't allowed
to do yesterday.
"A lot of people think that
all blind people should have
guide dogs," she said, "but
people forget that not all blind
people like dogs or want the re
sponsibility. And some are
afraid of dogs, exactly like
seeing persons have their own

individual preferences."
The Stanford campus can be
a pretty dangerous place for
seeing students with all the
cars and wild bicyclists around.
Imagine how difficult it would
be to get around without being
able to see all of these obsta
cles and potential hazards.
According to Karnow, these
hazards are one reason for
having a guide dog. "A dog is
better than a cane when you
are trying to go through
crowds; the dog can find little
paths in order to wind between
people. You still run into
people though. At street cross
ings having a dog with you can
also be very helpful. You can do
it with a cane but you have
more security with a dog," Kar
now said.
When asked what she would
do if she suddenly could see,
she said. "In high school
sometimes I would daydream
like everyone else, except I
would wonder what I would do
if I could see. At first I
thought I'd call home and tell
my mom that I could see. Then
I thought I might just go on
like I was blind and not tell
anyone. Then 1 would see what
people would do.
"I think it would be neat to
see my family, and my dog, and
especially color, but I would
have to learn how to use my
eyes and know what all the
stimuli meant," said Karnow.
"But I am happy the way I am
right now."
