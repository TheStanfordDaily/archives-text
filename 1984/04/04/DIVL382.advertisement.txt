in your future. But even more than that. We believe in you now. And we've
been proving it. A $10,000 job. That's it. No strings. No gimmicks. And this
offer is even good for 12 months after you graduate.
But why do you need the American Express Card now? First of all, it's a
good way to begin to establish your credit history. And you know that's
important. Of course, the Card is also good for vacation travel, as well as
for shopping for things like a new stereo or furniture. And because the Card
is recognized and welcomed worldwide,
