Paul Simon didn't write
"I got an Olympus camera . .
He didn't write
"I got a Pentax camera . .."
Nor did he write
"I got a Minolta camera . .."
And he certainly didn't write
"I got a Canon camera ..."
No, Paul Simon wrote
"I got a Nikon camera,
I love to take a photograph,
So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away."
But even if you use a generic camera, we want
you. We're having a photographers meeting
Friday at 4 p.m in The Daily offices. New and
old photogs alike: Be there ... or be Canon.
