# Faculty neighbors go to court over right to let sun shine in
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Two campus neighbors locked in a bitter dispute for
more than a decade are going to court in June to decide
whether one family's trees have the right to block the
other family's sunlight.
Engineering Prof. Rudolph Sher and his wife Bonnie
have sued Psychiatry Profs. Gloria and P. Herbert Leider
man over the Shers' privilege to sunlight. The case could
result in a new state law recognizing sunlight as an impor
tant property right, according to the attorneys involved.
"1 can't believe that it's gone this far," Mrs. Sher said,
"but I tried every thing,( before suing). 1 went to the Uni
versity, to the Housing Association ... I'm frustrated and
angry. I would hope we will win the suit."
The Shers contend that more than 20 trees in the
Leidermans' backyard constitute a "private nuisance" be
cause each winter they cast a shadow over the Sher home,
located at 740 Mayfield Ave. They maintain that the trees
have devalued their property, interfered with their use of
property, blocked solar heat and light, and caused emo
tional distress, according to Palo Alto lawyer Victor Sher,
who is representing his parents in the lawsuit.
All three Shers involved noted that the psychological
impact of the Leidermans' trees goes far beyond blocking
sun. "It is also a matter of callous indifference," said the
lawyer.
"1 can't understand that a psychiatrist and a psychologist
can't understand someone else's pain," said Mrs. Sher,
who, according to her husband, has suffered "great de
pression" from the lack of sunlight and the Leidermans'
recalcitrance.

"They've been so inconsiderate over the years. They
knew how it was affecting me," she said.
The Shers are asking that the Santa Clara County Su
perior Court order the Leidermans to remove two large
pine trees and to "control," or trim, many others, includ
ing a redwood, eucalyptus, and acacias. Their son said the
suit was also filed "to recover for loss of sunlight," and
thus they are asking the Leidermans to pay $53,000 in
compensatory damages.
In addition to that amount, the Shers also hope to
receive recompense for punitive damages owing to the
Leidermans' "deliberate, willful, and malicious" behavior,
the lawyer said.
The Shers are suing under a state law as well as their
'•private nuisance" claim, he said. The t 978 Solar Shade
Control Act prohibits citizens from maintaining trees that
shade a pre-existing solar collector. Sher said he believes
his parents' house qualifies as a "natural solar-collecting
system," and thus they might win under the 1978 law,
which he said "has never to my knowledge been en
forced."
To win this case, though, the Shers "must overrule at
least 100 years of California law," according to Mark
Solomon, a Redwood City attorney representing the
Leidermans.
"The Shers wish to benefit their land at the Leiderman's
expense," Solomon said. He said the Leidermans, both of
whom are currently on sabbatical in France, feel the Shers
are making an "unreasonable imposition" and should have
considered that their house was situated in a "downhill
lot" when they purchased it.
