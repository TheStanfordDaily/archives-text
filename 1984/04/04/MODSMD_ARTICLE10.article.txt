From The Washington Post
Washington â€” Superpower jockeying
for mastery of the seas intensified yester
day as the Soviet Union began its largest
military exercise ever in the Atlantic
Ocean and U.S. officials deliberated how
to protest the firing of eight flares at a
Navy frigate by a Soviet aircraft carrier
in the South China Sea.
Navy officials confirmed that the
frigate USS Harold E. Holt was hit on
the left side Monday by three Soviet
flares, one of which came within three
feet of the Holt's captain. There were no

reports of damage or injuries on the
American ship.
One Pentagon official said yesterday
that Navy officials had decided against
summoning the Soviet naval attache for a
formal protest but may mention the inci
dent next month in Moscow at an annual
meeting with Soviet admirals designed to
defuse tension at sea.
The incident occurred as the 3,900-ton
Holt passed within 300 yards of the
37,000-ton carrier Minsk, which had
stopped for unknown reasons. Defense
sources said that the Holt had been

shadowing the Soviet carrier but that the
Soviet action was "unprovoked."
The Holt episode is the latest in a
string of incidents between the two pow
erful navies, which often use each other
as unwitting partners in military exer
cises. In November, a U.S. destroyer and
a Soviet frigate collided in the Arabian
sea, and on March 21, a Soviet attack
submarine collided with the U.S. aircraft
carrier USS Kitty Hawk in the Sea of
Japan.
NATO planes and ships also are
shadowing the large Soviet task force.

grouped around the 28,000-ton nuclear
powered battle cruiser Kirov, that is
steaming west through the Norwegian
Sea, apparently headed for the North
Atlantic, a NATO spokesman said.
NATO analysts suspect that the north
Atlantic maneuvers are part of a global
Soviet military exercise, which may in
clude the helicopter carrier Leningrad in
the Caribbean and the Minsk in the
South China Sea, Sirmans said. There
were also reports of increased Soviet
naval activity in the Mediterranean and
the Indian Ocean.
