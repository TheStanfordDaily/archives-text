New York Results
New York — Walter Mondale
won New York's presidential
primary election last night,
trouncing Sen. Gary Hart and
regaining command in his quest
for the Democratic nomination
for the White House.
The richest and most bitterly
contested battle to date wasn't
even close. Hart acidly ap
praised his defeat by saying that
Mondale "got me down to his
level" in the campaign debate.

"He won't do that
again," he vowed.
"We had a very
good day today in
New York,"
Mondale said with
satisfaction.
"Apparently we did
well across the

board." Mondale was polling 48
percent of the vote, to Hart's 31
percent. The Rev. Jesse Jackson
had an overwhelming
dominance of the black vote and
was running third at 18 percent.
Hart all but conceded defeat,
and said he would contest the
later primaries with a more pos
itive campaign style. If the
bruising New York primary
"proves anything, it is that he
got me down to his level," the
Colorado senator said.
Based on polling-place inter
views, the television networks
said Hart was in a closer-than
expected contest for second
place with the Rev. Jesse Jack
son.
Jackson was polling excep
tionally well in New York City,
apparently winning about 80
percent of the black vote.
Mondale was leading for 151

national convention delegates.
Hart led for 83 and Jackson 18.
The former vice president began
the day with 728.25 delegates to
440 for Hart and 93.50 for
Jackson. It takes 1,967 to win
nomination.
"In New York, they (the Hart
campaign) spent maybe three
times, maybe four times as
much money as we did,"
Mondale said. "But Americans
weren't looking at that. Citizens
of New York were asking that

key question (who would make
a better president) and I think
that's why we won."
Hart said in advance that the
New York primary was not that
crucial to his chances for the
nomination. But one aide,
Frank Mankiewicz, said a
Mondale margin of 10
percentage points or more
would be a "significant victory."
The former vice president was
doing considerably better than
that.
With 73 percent of the vote
in, it was:
Mondale, 443,159 or 48 per
cent.
Hart, 283,162, 31 percent.
Jackson, 173,087, 19 percent.
The rest was scattered among
Democratic dropouts.
Wisconsin Democrats held a

"beauty contest" primary yes
terday, in advance of next Sat
urday's caucuses when 78 con
vention delegates are at stake.
With 32 percent of the vote in,
Mondale and Hart each had 43
percent of the vote.
NBC News said voter inter
views indicated Mondale was
running strongly among
Democrats, but, "If Hart wins,
it will be because of his edge
among Republican voters voting
in the Democratic primary."

Crossover votes are
permitted in Wis
consin.
President
Reagan-Yes was
piling up 93 percent
of the vote in the
Wisconsin GOP
Primary. Reagan-

No had 7 percent. There was no
GOP line on the ballot in New
York.
Victory was dramatic
evidence that Mondale had
completed a comeback in the
Democratic fight, and an indica
tion that Hart's "new ideas"
candidacy faces difficulty in the
weeks ahead.
Hart said New York was not
that critical to his chances for
the nomination, and he already
was looking ahead to Pennsyl
vania.
But New York is the kind of
state that a Democrat must
carry to defeat President
Reagan next fall, and the
Mondale victory would blunt
Hart's claim that only he can
capture the White House for the
Democrats.
While there are still hundreds
of delegates to be chosen, each

state that Mondale wins makes
it more difficult than Hart.
Mondale himself said the
New York primary was critical
to his own chances.
"If we lose, we're in trouble.
But if we win, they're going to
have to make a pretty good grab
at our coattails to catch up," was
his assessment.
Hart on New York
New York — Hart said last
night that Mondale won the
New York primary because "he
got me down to his level" of
negative campaigning, but
vowed, "He's not going to do
that any more."
Hart, appearing cheerful
despite a beating far worse than
he or his advisers had expected,
told reporters on a short flight
here from Philadelphia that he
is finished with "responding to
charges" of flip-flops and policy
changes from the former vice
president and that he is going to

"settle in and re-establish the
themes of this campaign."
"I'm going to talk about in
dustrial policy for Pennsylvania,
cleaning up toxic waste dumps,
foreign policy and energy inde
pendence," Hart said.
Implicitly acknowledging that
Mondale's aggressive tactics had
knocked him off-stride, Hart
nonetheless said that the cam
paign will move into more fa
vorable territory for him after
next Tuesday's Pennsylvania
primary.
"This is a watershed," he
said, predicting that he will "win
a series of victories in May" and
clinch the nomination in Cali
fornia, "which I said a year ago
would decide the nomination."
The Hart entourage was not
shocked at Mondale's winning
New York, having proclaimed
for a week that the senator was
the underdog. But the apparent
size of Mondale's win did catch
them unprepared and seemed

certain to cause the kind of
reappraisal of strategy at which
Hart hinted last night.
Delegates Battle
Washington — Anticipating
that the Democratic presidential
primaries may end indecisively
in June, Mondale and Hart have
launched computer-aided
battles for the loyalties of
delegates already chosen for
July's Democratic National
Convention in San Francisco.
Both sides are contemplating
what was once considered an
impossibility — a brokered con
vention. Not only are the candi
dates stalemating in the prima
ries and caucuses, but this year
for the first time all delegates
will be free from the start to
ignore their announced pledges
of support and vote for any can
didacy they choose.
Yet while more than 40 per
cent of the 3933 delegate slots
have been apportioned, neither
Hart nor Mondale has
developed a strategy for dealing
with possibly the key broker,
candidate Jesse Jackson.
The battle for delegates' votes
reflects the standoff the candi
dates have wrought so far. Each
has won claim to a distinct por
tion of the Democratic and in
dependent electorates but has
been unable to expand signifi
cantly into the others. The race
has slowed to a marathon race
that could end with a photo
finish decided not by the voters,
but by delegates.
A virtual second campaign
has begun for these delegates,
and at times the rhetoric ap
pears aimed as much at them as

at the voters in the next round
of primaries and caucuses.
Mondale tells his delegates
that he has deep roots in the
Democratic party, that he is a
more "sure-footed" and experi
enced candidate — the kind, his
aides argue, that Democratic
candidates at all levels would
prefer to have heading the ticket
in November.
"When we get to San Fran
cisco, there are very few
Democrats . . . who would not
be fully prepared to support a
Mondale nomination," said
Mondale campaign chairman
James Johnson.
But Hart reminds listeners
that he is the candidate most
consistently supported by the
independents and suburbanites
who rejected the Democrats in
1980.
"The issue," he said, "is not
who is Mr. Democrat. The issue
is who has the best chance of
defeating Ronald Reagan
Mondale also is planning
strong follow-up efforts in states
that have had first-round
caucuses and are nearing dele
gate selection, such as lowa,
Mississippi, Arkansas and South
Carolina. The aim is not only to
retain Mondale's strength but to
win uncommitted participants
and those pledged to candidates
who have dropped out.
Though Hart trails Mondale
by nearly 300 delegates, his
strategists hope to "backload"
delegate support as the contests
generally move west toward the
Colorado senator's base and as
primaries that award bonus
delegates to winners come into
