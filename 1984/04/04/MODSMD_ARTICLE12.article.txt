## The 						Stanford Daily Embassy maneuvers 
### 
Against the backdrop of the latest terrorism in
Israel, presidential hopefuls Walter Mondale and
Gary Hart continue their skirmishes over moving
the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
And it's not surprising that Israeli officials aren't
particularly eager to get involved.
In fact, the move to Jerusalem has been sugges
ted sporadically in Congress over the past three
decades, and each time Israel has carefully
steered clear.
At first glance, this may seem confusing. All
major Israeli government offices except the
Defense Ministry are in Jerusalem, and that
means ambassadors spend a good deal of time
traveling the 35 miles between the capital city and
Tel Aviv.
But while such a move might appear to save
time and money, it threatens to put those same
ambassadors — and Israeli citizens — at added
risk.
Because the United States supports Israel, it is
politically expedient not to endorse Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem. Such a policy assures
potentially hostile Arab neighbors that the future

of the contested city remains open for negotia
tion.
As Secretary of State George Shultz recently
said, "It would be a gigantic aggravation to im
portant religions, particularly the Moslems. And
it would therefore damage the interests of the
United States, damage our ability to be effective
in the peace process."
And while Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kolleck
says he backs moving the embassy to Jerusalem,
he concedes that the necessity of acting now is
"wildly exaggerated."
In fact, four years ago Kolleck tried to block
the enactment of a bill by the Israeli Parliament
that declared Jerusalem Israel's united capital,
fearing that such an empty gesture would spawn
more unrest.
"These things have to grow naturally," the
mayor recently told The New York Times. "I'm
against policy by declaration."
The special relationship between the United
States and Israel has to be molded to fit the tur
bulent context of the entire Middle East, and
keeping the embassy in Tel Aviv reflects this
reality.
