# Uncle Sam has one last hope: pushing narcotics
## 
### 
Bitter? Of course I'm bitter; I have a
right to be. It always bothers me when some
one does something in my name without my
consent — especially something as dumb as
running up a huge debt. Furthermore, the
fact that the people who did this imbecile
thing — Nixon, Carter and Reagan — are
not mv favorite people by any stretch of the
imagination only adds to my ire.
So here we stand, with a deficit estimated
at almost $12,000 for every man, woman and
child in these here United States, and the
prospect of more to come, if the upcoming
elections work out as badly as they have to.
Something is going to happen soon, they say,
and for my part I hope it's the complete fall
of Western civilization rather than some at
tempt to come around and collect it.
As if to further underline the seriousness
of the situation, even young people are be
coming aware of this threat. A recent survey
stated that America's youth said the deficit
was the second gravest worry in their lives,
just ahead of unemployment and just behind
whether or not Michael Jackson would ask
them to the prom. America is in turmoil, our
values have been dislocated, and horror and
confusion walk the streets: all because of
this budget deficit.
Therefore, after the manner of people
whom nobody listens to, I shall offer my sug
gestion for solving this crisis. Most obvi
ously, the simplest solution, which would be
merely paying off this debt, is impossible.
Twelve G's is far beyond my means. As it
stands now, I'll be breaking into cars and
going into the used-and-damaged tape deck
business just to pay my income tax.
Similarily, any great increase in taxes or
tariffs would be insupportable. Some mal
contents would cry that the deficit coujd be
paid by applying the revenues from parking

tickets issued on Stanford campus, but that
money's already going toward the El Sal
vador war and thus spoken for. Floating new
bonds would merely postpone and ex
acerbate the situation. It seems, then, that
all traditional forms of revenue cannot help
us here.
What about new forms of revenue? Our
current president once suggested placing
part of the Social Security fund in stock
market speculation, thereby answering in
the positive the old question whether he was
an optimist or a fool. We could, along those
lines, go to Nevada and place the education
budget on black, but we probably wouldn't

make the table minimum. Such gambling is
no answer; 1 am the*best gambler in the
world today, but even I lose heavily every
time I play.
Maybe the problem lies in the governmen
tal system, and rather than trying to heal
the symptoms we should try to cure the
disease. We spend huge sums of money to
support the ill, poor and aged, more to
protect and entertain the population, and
still more to police the streets and keep
people safe from criminals. Some say we

waste that effort, prosecuting victimless
crimes, but morality, once codified, is law,
and there is nothing to do about that. All
these things, we must sadly admit, need to
be done.
What about our tax collection? Fairly
flawless, it must be said, as any time any
money changes hands the government leaps
in and claims part. There is a big exception,
though, and that is the "Underground Eco
nomy," which is not taxed or regulated in
any way. Illicit substances and services are
pandered by a cartel of amoral profit
seeking fiends. Though indisputably success
ful, these people are not nice.

Furthermore, these people sell the
substances that ruin people's lives, making
them ill, poor and aged. Although the gov
ernment strives to protect the public from
these unhealthy influences and to provide
safer entertainment, it does not always
succeed, and the victimless crime abruptly
changes character when "junkies" must steal
to support their habits.
I think you see what I'm getting at.
Stomping them out doesn't work, and,
frankly, it's un-American. Something

presents a challenge to our will, to our
morals, to our collective strength as a na
tion— and we throw the people responsible
into jail? What is this, Soviet Russia? That's
not the American way: the American way is
Competition!
It's not a decision that should be made
lightly, but it's one that must be made soon:
The American government must go into ille
gal narcotics retailing.
Look at this logically. We need money, a
lot of it, and fast. Although it may not have
worked for DeLorean. we have much greater
resources. Plus, we won't be just throwing
more money into an economic hole. The new
"Underground Economy" will be taxed, reg
ulated, and obscenely profitable to the gov
ernment. New money flows in. With it, we
can settle the debt, police the streets more
efficiently, and start wonderful public works
programs to help those whose lives are shat
tered by narcotics.
Furthermore, this will crowd out The
mobs, the petty .criminals and unsavory char
acters that haunr our cities. Instead of the
shady, frightening figure of the pusher,
America's schoolchildren can buy their drugs
from an inoffensive bureaucrat. Gangland
killings that once erupted over questions of
quality and quantity will disappear, as the
government Bureau of Weights and
Measures will stand behind every sale. The
customers, it goes without saying, will get
their money's worth.
Less liberal elements of our society will at
tack this plan. They will see it as a huge
retreat by the government, renouncing prin
ciples it had held as inviolable. The shame of
it, they would say, condoning drug use!
Such is the genius of the plan. At no time
is the sale or possession of drugs made legal.
That would make no sense, as it would give a

head start to those already established in
the field, the very people this plan attempts
to eliminate. Furthermore, this would
remove the need to manufacture or contract
to obtain the drugs. Instead, once the
Federal Narcotics Agency seized a shipment,
it would turn it over to the Federal Nar
cotics Distribution Agency (FNDA).
The two arms of government, although
working at cross purposes, would remain en
tirely separate, each with no knowledge of
the other. Despite the fact that they would
be liable for arrest, I'm sure the FNDA
would have no problem finding people willing
to work for them. Speaking from experience,
the current glut of liberal arts graduates
would jump at the chance to work at high
salaries for the government. A little in
security, they'd say, is common to all busi
nesses.
Arresting pushers and seizing drugs (albeit
for later resale), the government could still
aver that it was moral" "and the~gooa~workslt
would do with the added rcveni'iV'S" >.i
the better health and greater security of thb
hopelessly addicted mass of population
would surely surpass any amount of incurred
iniquity.
Later on, when the competition was
forced into closure, traditional inefficiency
would make the drug-running arm of the
government unprofitable, and it would have
to be closed down. At that time, disgust
over having to deal with an increasingly cor
rupt and wildly incompetent FNDA would
cause many addicts to abandon their habits.
End result: abolition of the drug problem.
It's a cheery scenario, but one that will
take immediate forceful and far-sighted ac
tion. Too bad.
