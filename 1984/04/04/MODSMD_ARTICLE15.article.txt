## Snobs? Who, us? That's absurd! 
### 
I'm a Stanford student, and I just
totally couldn't believe The Daily's
editorial (March 9). I mean it was
like just totally off the wall! 1 just
can't understand how anyone could
think Stanford students are snobbish
and have no sense of reality. I mean

VIEWPOINT

I'm open-minded, friendly and
respect the dignity of at least most
of the people in my dorm. I know
what reality is. Let me give a few ex
amples:
First, there's all this talk about
hunger. People say us Stanford stu
dents have no conception of what
hunger is. Well, I just think that
that's totally wrong! I know what
hunger is! It was only last week that
Food Service served Eggplant
Stackup and California Quiche â€”
both on the same day! I couldn't
believe it! Usually when I don't like
the food I go out to eat. But I had
midterms to study for, so I ordered a
pizza instead. It took two hours for
the stupid Dominos guy to come.
(Those guys better learn how to be
more efficient if they want us to tip
them!) Have you ever waited two
hours for a meal? In case you haven t,
let me tell you, I know what hunger
is!
And then there's all this talk
about unemployment. Why don't all
those lazy bums who are unemployed
just get a job? That would solve all
our problems! The unemployment
rate would go down, the economy
would recover, and Reagan would get
re-elected. Even if someone doesn't
want to deliver pizzas for Domino's,
there's all kinds of ways he can get a
job. Take me, for example. I wanted
to get a job last summer, so I called
up my sister's ex-husband's wife and
asked her how I could contact her
best friend who is the secretary and
future wife of a luture junior vice

president of a major corporation. I
contacted her, wrote a few letters,
went to the CPPC to learn how to
write a resume, and got a job. Sure,
doing nothing but making coffee all
day isn't the most exciting thing in
the world, but the skills that I
learned will definitely advance my
career and help me to get into Stan
ford Biz School. If nothing else, I had
fun wearing a three-piece suit. Don't
get me wrong, I'm not one of those

Even if someone doesn't want to deliver pizzas for
Domino's, there's all kinds of ways he can get a
job. Take me, for example. I wanted to get a job
last summer, so I called up my sister's ex
husband's wife and asked her how I could contact
her best friend who is the secretary and future
wife of a future junior vice president of a major
corporation.

"Biz-School Red Hots," but my
point is, if I can get a job, anyone can.
And then there's all this talk
about poverty. With the constant
rises in tuition, all Stanford students
know what poverty is. I could buy
only half the number of records this
year that 1 bought last year because
of the rises in tuition. Furthermore,
I've studied about poverty! I took
Professor Marshall's Poli Sci 001
class. Sure. I didn't do all the readings
on poverty, but our dorm went skiing
that weekend. In any case, I know
what poverty is all about.
Then there's all this talk about the
lack of cultural diversity at Stan
ford. That's just totally wrong. If
Dean Fred Hargadon says that
there's cultural diversity here,
there's gotta he cultural diversity
here. I think that it's "GREAT!"
that Dean Fred lets some minority

students come here. I've even been
able to talk to some of them in some
of my discussion sections. Further
more, it was just a while back that
Food Service had a Chinese New
Year's dinner. I even sat next to an
Oriental student and let him teach
me how to use chopsticks!
Furthermore, I can't understand
all these people who say that Stan
ford students have no sense of re
sponsibility to the peoples of the

w-orld. Well, I went overseas fall
quarter, and I know for a fact that all
the money us Stanford students
spent on beer, hostels, wine, cheese
and train tickets has definitely made
a significant contribution to the sag
ging economy of Europe. Also, I
think that Stanford Overseas
Studies does a superb job in creating
jobs for all of those Europeans on
their overseas staffs, who otherwise
couldn't find jobs for themselves.
I learned a lot from my overseas
experience. I learned how important
it is to learn a foreign language.
After going overseas I am even more
convinced that bilingual education
and bilingual ballots are wrong. All
these lazy immigrants gotta learn
that they must learn English before
they come to America. Learning a
foreign language is not that hard. All
I had to do to learn a foreign lan

guage was take two quarters of
classes and then hop on a plane to
Europe.
I just want to say that I'm proud
to be a Stanford student. It's the
best school in the country. The stu
dents here are also the best in the
country. You don't have to bother
here with less intelligent people like
the ones you find at Berkeley. I have
every right in the world to be here.
My parents worked hard to send me
to a good prep school, piano lessons,
tennis lessons, golf lessons, voice les
sons, sailing lessons, SAT preparation
lessons, art appreciation lessons, self
assertion lessons, charm school, and
the orthodontist, so that Fred Har
gadon would like my application. If
other students' parents didn't give
them such opportunities, it's their
own fault.
Anyway, I gotta go now. I feel like
throwing up again. (I've thrown up
seven times in the last hour.) You
see, last night I went to this party at
the Alpha Sigma Sigmas. It was one
of those Hawaiian Luau things, you
know? I got to wear that Hawaiian
shirt I bought in Hawaii last
weekend, and the Vuarnets that I
bought in France. They had all these
tropical drinks, you know, like the
kind Tom Selleck drinks. I couldn't
see what I was drinking, though, be
cause I was wearing my Vuarnets all
night. They also had 20 kegs of beer.
It was great! especially since there
were only 10 people there. Those Al
pha Sigma Sigmas really know how to
party! I just got totally wasted!
I think that I still am totally
wasted.
Oh, before I go blow chow, I hear
there's going to be a party at the
Oasis tonight. You wanna come? It'll
be really cool! We can go waste
ourselves even more.
