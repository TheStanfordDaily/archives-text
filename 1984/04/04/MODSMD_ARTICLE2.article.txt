# Runoff expected for upcoming elections
## 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
Officials at the ASSU predict that
there will be a runott vote in the up
coming ASSU elections because of the
large number of slates running lor
senior class president.
To date, 11 slates are on the ballot.
"There will definitely be a run-oft

for the senior slates unless there
comes an earthquake or hell treezes
over," said Phil Halperin. elections
commissioner.
The central elections are scheduled
to take place April 17 and IN. and the
run-off election for the top two senior
slates and possibly COP slates will

then be held the following Wednes
day.
"We want to limit the run-offs to a
one-day event for several reasons,"
said Halperin, "and we've already had
to set aside $1000 for the extra day. It
would cost much more to extend the
election any further.
"The election situation for senior
slate is going to be one that will force
the candidates to campaign them
selves to death on a one-to-one basis.
Posters are clearly not going to win
anyone this campaign," Halperin said.
There is not nearly the same mea
sure of interest on the part of candi
dates for ASSU senate, however.The
number of campaigning graduates is
so few that at election time it may be
necessary to fill open slots with write
in candidates.
There is an ebb and flow from year
to year of interest in the senate posi
tions, Halperin said. "This might be a
low year for the senate in numbers.

but the list of candidates is still com
prised of quality people," lie said.
"It's always been difficult getting
graduates involved in the ASSU since
they already have so much going on in
their work," said Peter Spivack, a
member of the COP.
"This year every vote will count in
most aspects of the elections," Hal
perin said.
A debate for the COP slates has
been tentatively scheduled for next
Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. in the Bran
ner Lounge.
Halperin said so many slates are
running for the senior class president
because it is a fun position to hold.
"A lot of people feel that the posi

tion lends itself mostly to fun. positive
issues, and that there's not nearly as
many bureaucratic trappings involved
in the senior class office as there is in
the senate," Halperin said.
"The job as senior presidents is
thoroughly determined by who holds
the office. There is no guiding consti
tution they have to follow. Senior Pub
nights certainly aren't set down in the
University's by-laws," Halperin ex
plained.
"The best thing about all these
slates is that hopefully whoever wins
will have a heck of a lot of support
from those groups that don't win but
are still interested in helping out the
senior class," Halperin said.
"Whoever wins is going to have a
whole lot expected of them, that's for
darn sure."
