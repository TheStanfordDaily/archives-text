## Elway's spring has sprung 
### 
While many students here
are basking in the sun this
spring, members of the Stan
ford football team will be
spending their afternoons
sweating in the sun. The
team began spring "the El
way way" yesterday, and it
will be engaged in spring
football training until May 5.
The team practices on
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and
Thursdays from 2:30 p.m. to
4:30 p.m. and it scrimmages
on Saturdays. This spring,
Head Coach Jack Elway will
get a chance to acquaint

himself with his new team
and his new staff.
