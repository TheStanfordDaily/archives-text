# Card sluggers conquer Spartans in Sunken Diamond
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
The Stanford baseball team
prepped for its upcoming con
frontation with No. 3-ranked
Arizona State b\ bursting to an
earlv lead and then holding off a
San Jose State rally to preserve
a 10-7 victory over the Spartans
at Sunken Diamond yesterday.
The non-league win salved
some Cardinal wounds after a
disappointing Pacific-10 Con
ference road trip to USC in
which the Card dropped a trio
of games to the Trojans. The
victory also ran Stanford's over
all slate to 22-15-1 while San
Jose State fell to 19-17. The
Card copped the season series
by capturing three of the four
meetings between the clubs.
"This was a good win because
we kind of got our tails beaten
down at USC," said yesterday's
star Mike Deßenon. "We
weren't hitting the ball that well
and we needed to get some of
our momentum back."
Deßenon got the ball rolling
— or more aptly flying — yes
terday, taking a cue from USC,
who pounded Stanford pitching
for eight home runs over the
weekend. He blasted San Jose
State starter Gary Adams' first
pitch over the left field fence for
a grand slam that gave the Card
a 4-0 first inning lead that it
would not relinquish.
"It was a fastball," explained
Deßenon afterwards. "He just
walked Mark (Davis) and I
knew he would want to get out
ahead of me."
The sophomore right fielder,
who has been rotating at that

spot with Walt Harris lately, was
not finished for the day. He
doubled and scored in Stan
ford's three-run third and
knocked in two more runs with
a fourth inning single. On the
day, Deßenon was 3 for 3 with
six RBl's. two walks, three runs
scored and two stolen bases. He
boosted his season average to
.357.
As a team the Cardinal ripped
twelve hits, but eleven came off
Adams who did little to improve
the fat 5.75 ERA with which he
entered the game. Adams (2-1)
was chased from the mound
after lasting only three and one
third innings and being raked
for nine runs. Reliever Gary
Sullivan subdued the Card on
just one hit the rest of the way.
Therein lies Stanford Head
Coach Mark Marquess" current
dilemma in a rollercoaster 1984
campaign: inconsistency. Yes
terday, the inconsistency was
not confined to the Cardinal of
fense. Handed a four-run cus
hion by Deßenon's grand slam,
the Card's recent No. 3 starter
Al Osuna was nicked for a run
in both the second and the third
innings, including a second in
ning homer by Spartan first
baseman Dwayne Graybill.
Marquess yanked Osuna in
favor of Steve Cottrell with two
out in the third and a 4-2 lead.
"(Osuna) didn't have good
velocity and didn't have the
good breaking ball either," the
Stanford skipper said.
Cottrell picked off a runner to
end the inning and benefitted
from Stanford's three-run third

that was highlighted by Ken
Green's triple, plating Davis
and Deßenon. Cottrell, the No.
3 staiter at the year's outset,
looked sharp for three more
frames while the Cardinal
turned the contest into no con
test by lengthening its advan
tage to 10-3.

All of a sudden, the Spartans
exploded. A single, a walk and a
double tallied two runs and Ken
Caminiti launched *a mammoth
two-run homer out of Sunken
Diamond in right field to close
the gap to 10-7. Cottrell
escaped hut, understandably.
Marquess is not pleased with his

pitching staffs recent penchant
for unloading "gopher balls."
"I don't like those 400-foot
sliders or fastballs," he quipped,
adding that his staff has been in
consistent in part because "We
haven't gotten our third starter
yet."
Marquess needed only to

glance at his third and final
reliever of the day for an ob
vious candidate to fill the void.
Brian Myers, tied for third on
Stanford's career win list and
last seen on the mound in
Hawaii six weeks ago, hurled
the last two innings to seal Cot
trell's fourth triumph without a

loss. Both Myers and Marquess
were pleased with the one-hit
stint, the latter saying, "The
real plus in the game was that
Myers was able to throw and
throw well." If he is ready,
Myers may get the starting call
in Sunday's series finale against
Arizona State.
