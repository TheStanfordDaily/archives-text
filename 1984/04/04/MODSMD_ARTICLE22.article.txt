# Fencers win Regionals

Despite both the men's and women's fencing
teams winning their respective West Regional
Championships, Stanford ran into some hard
luck at the NCAA fencing championships.
The men, in fact, may feel like they were
born under a bad sign. Because of" NCAA rules
they didn't even get a chance to field a team for
the championship meet.
The Cardinal won an upset victory over Air
Force to win the regional in early March. But
under the rules only the top three fencers in
each weapon category qualify for the NCAAs.
Stanford had two fourth-place finishers and
two fifth-place finishers at the Western
Regionals, and thus didn't qualify anyone for
the NCAAs. Senior Nik Blevins took a fourth
and freshman Larry Murk took fifth in the
epee. Sophomore Andy Goorno finished
fourth in the sabre and sophomore Elliot Cheu
finished a disappointing fifth in the foil.
Cheu was Stanford's best hope for a top
three finish, but had the flu during the meet. "I
really think he could have won the event. He
certainly would have been in the top three if he

had been well," said Coach Buzz Hurst.
The regional championship was the Car
dinal's first since the event was established in
1950. The men finished the year 12-2.
The women finished the year a perfect
but placed a disappointing ninth at the
NCAAs. The Cardinal started the tournament
on a bad note by losing to the University of
Wisconsin in an extremely close match. The
score was tied 8-8 after regulation, whereupon
Wisconsin got the victory by having one more
touch than Stanford.
"We ran into some psychological difficulties
against Wisconsin. In actual ability, I think we
were probably about the fourth or fifth best
team there," Hurst said.
The Cardinal's biggest problem occurred
when No. 2 player Cathy Correa had to drop
out against Wisconsin because of a recurring
nerve injury. The Card came back against
Penn (the eventual third place team) but didn't
have enough, losing 9-6.
On the next day, Stanford destroyed Stevens
Tech, 9-2, and San Jose State, 9-4. But it
couldn't overcome its opening day losses.
