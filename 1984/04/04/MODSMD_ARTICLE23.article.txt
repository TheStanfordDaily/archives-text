# Netters shut out UC-Irvine here

Turning points in a season are
usually for teams that have
played poorly up to that time.
But when men's tennis coach
Dick Gould says his team has
just reached a turning point in
its season, it's not readily appar
ent what he's talking about.
With a sound 9-0 trouncing of
UC-lrvine yesterday, Stanford
bettered its record to 12-2 over
all.
Gould, however, maintained
that wie victory was a "big psy
ch logical step for us." Irvine,
now 17-10 overall, had just
beaten UC-Berkeley the day
before, putting it among the top
20 teams in the country.
Thus, "to have come out and
blown somebody out of this
caliber was great," said Gould.
"We're really starting to gel.

We're starting to take charge."
The Cardinal had a rough
time beating Cal, 6-3, over the
weekend but breezed past the
Anteaters. The Card did not
lose a single set.
According to Gould, this
stage in the year is very impor
tant for Stanford because it
needs to build up momentum
for two big matches against
USC and UCLA in Los Angeles
later this month. "This time of
the year, we have a series of
matches against some good
teams. But they're teams we
should beat. If we can take
charge and really beat them
soundly, we'll really get going.
"1 was kind of disappointed
before with our performance
against teams like Trinity. We
weren't playing like a team. Our
doubles were pretty inconsis
tent," Gould said.
