# Spikers meet USC, Long Beach
## 
### BETH KLEID Daily staff 
Maples Pavilion is as sweet as
syrup for the Stanford volleyball
team. The Card has won the
past four games at home, and
hopefully the charm will con
tinue as it faces No. 2-ranked
USC tonight at 7:30 and No. 4-
ranked Long Beach State on
Friday night in Maples Pavilion.
"We are definitely a better
team at home," said Assistant
Coach Don Shaw. "And we
have a good chance of beating
USC here."
In fact, according to Shaw,
the Cardinal is capable of
beating any team in the confer
ence. "Ail of the teams art
pretty equal, and it's up for
grabs who will win a given
game."
The No. 7-rated Stanford
spikers now hold a 4-8 record in

the conference, and with this
record they have made history.
"The most that we have won in
conference play up until now is
three games. We have already
done better than ever, and we
are getting better each year,"
said Shaw.
But the team still has a lot to
learn. Shaw said that the players
are working on perfecting their
fundamentals, and learning the
importance of intense concen
tration in-order to "learn how to
beat" teams such as USC and
Long Beach.
"We are still a young team —
we have no seniors," said Shaw,
"but we are willing to work."
The team is working to
overcome the aftereffects of a
recent road trip in which its
did not perform well. "But we
will bounce back this week,"
said Shaw.
