## Don't underestimate 'Romancing the Stone' 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The ads for Romancing the
Stone are off-puttingly cheap
looking, and the weird title
keeps slipping the mind because
it doesn't seem to make gram
matical sense. You think that
the publicists at Twentieth
Century-Fox wanted people to
stay away from the picture —
until you see it and realize that
the title is actually appropriate
and even clever, and the ads,
unattractive as they are, repre
sent an attempt to parody the
glossy, melodramatic*covers of
romantic novels.
The heroine of the film, Joan
Wilder (Kathleen Turner), is a
phenomenally successful author
in this peculiar, highly special
ized field who lives a cozy, un
threatened existence in a New

York apartment with her cat,
Romeo — an adventureless,
loveless life that she fills with
the fantasies she spins into her
preposterous books.
Suddenly she finds herself
swept up in a more elaborate,
more implausible plot than any
of her own devising: Her
brother-in-law is killed by a
greedy, corrupt government of
ficial (Manuel Ojeda) while
trying to smuggle a priceless
emerald called "El Cortazon"
("the heart") out of Colombia,
but not before mailing her a
treasure map indicating its
whereabouts. A pair of Ameri
can gangsters (Danny DeVito
and Zack Norman), also after
the stone, kidnap Joan's sister
Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor),
promising to release her only if

Joan comes to Colombia with
the map. On her way to deliver
the document, she runs into
trouble with Zolo, the evil offi
cial; an emigre American, Jack
Colton (Michael Douglas),
who's something of a hipster ad
venturer, saves her, becomes
her lover, and together they un
earth the treasure. The title
comes from a line in Diane
Thomas' screenplay, when
Danny DeVito accuses Michael
Douglas of "romancing the
stone" right from under Kath
leen Turner, with the obvious
play on Joan's profession (and
the genre the movie parodies).
The terrific 197S comedy
Handle with Care had a similarly
tricky title — "handle" referred
to CB operators — that might
have dissuaded audiences from
checking it out; I hope
Romancing the Stone doesn't
meet the same fate, because
aside from Splash, it's the only
decent entertainment of the last
three months. The premise is a
quirky, comical one, like the
episode in the 1951 British clas
sic Laughter in Paradise in
which Alastair Sim played a
timid murder mystery writer
forced by the dictates of a
cousin's will to get himself ar
rested before he could inherit a
slice of the estate — though
Diane Thomas introduces hers a
little clumsily. (She should have
drawn Joan into the intrigue in a
more likely, commonplace man
ner so that the plot didn't pres
ent such an obvious immediate
parallel to one of her bestsel
lers.)
The director, Robert
Zemeckis, whose last film was
the amazing screwball satire
Used Cars, employs his camera
as a jokester narrator, setting up
and unfolding the story and
punctuating it with visual punch
lines. A sample: Hacking their
way through the Colombian
jungle, Joan and Jack are
surprised by a skeleton stuck
grotesquely through the window
of what appears at first to be a
bus. The camera tracks back,
and we see that it is a cargo
plane, overgrown with tropical
verdure — this rich, comic-book

image suggests a buried city in a
science-fiction setting. Then
Zemeckis takes us inside the ex
otic vehicle and we see the
Grateful Dead T-shirt on the
pilot's hack, the copy of Rolling
Stone, the hags of smuggled ma
rijuana.
The picture is a beauty: Dean
Cundey, the photographer, has
shot the jungle scenes (filmed
on location in Mexico) with a
nearly hyperbolic vividness and
clarity, and Zemeckis gives the
adventure sequences (featuring
mud slides, chasms, waterfalls
and such) the deluxe treatment.
This is a movie that won't look
half as good on a video cassette
or on HBO, because Zemeckis
thinks like a filmmaker, not like
a TV package expert. The only
sequence that doesn't really

come off, unfortunately, is the
climax, which brings together all
the characters with the emerald
and a crew of hungry crocodiles;
Zemeckis reaches for a
slapstick-suspense tone that
eludes him (though the scene is
almost redeemed by a shot of
Michael Douglas trying to grab
hold of his gun while grasping a
crocodile's tail).
In her last movie, The Man
with Two Brains, the gifted
comedienne Kathleen Turner
trashed her own performance as
the femme fatale in Body Heat,
proving that she had taste as
well as talent. In Romancing the
Stone, she sends up the trapped,
screaming heroines of every
jungle adventure since the early
Tarzans. Diane Thomas'

dialogue helps considerably,
and so does the presence of tele
vision performer Danny
DeVito, who makes a
hilariously foreshortened comic
villain. (He's the humbler who
personifies the movie's most
pleasurable running gag.) The
film's biggest mistake is the one
casting choice that probably
couldn't have been avoided: Mi
chael Douglas, who also
produced the movie, as Jack
Colton. Douglas actually does
much better than one might
have anticipated, but Colton is
meant to both embody Joan's
romantic fantasies of a lover and
undercut them; he's a Han Solo-
Indiana Jones type, and Michael
Douglas is no Harrison Ford. (If
the movie had been made at M-
G-M in the '30s, Clark Gable

would certainly have played the
part.)
But Romancing the Stone is
very entertaining anyhow, and it
displays Robert Zemeckis' skill,
even though it lacks the dis
tinctive tone and style of the
movies he's written with Bob
Gale — that extravagant, self
destructive fireworks show 1941
(which Steven Spielberg di
rected), the Loony Tunes com
edy I Wanna Hold Your Hand
and the stinging, ebullient Used
Cars (both of which he directed
himself). Zemeckis is one of the
two or three most unconven
tionally talented American
directors to pop up in the last
five or six years, but so far al
most no one has seen his work.
It's high time audiences dis
covered him.
