# 'Racing With the Moon:' pleasant but forgettable
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Richard Benjamin made his direct
ing debut two years ago with My Fa
vorite Year; it was an erratic piece of
filmmaking but a wonderful film —
Benjamin served the funny, bristling
screenplay, the first-rate cast
(especially Peter O'Toole) and the
tantalizing milieu (live TV in the '50s)
extremely well. In his new movie,
Racing with the Moon, he shows a
surer touch; it's a smooth-skinned, ef
fectively assembled period piece — set
in a small California town in 1942 and
1943 — with plenty of what, in the
studio-dominated days, used to be
called "production values," chief
among them John Bailey's evocative
cinematography. But the Steven
Kloves script about teenagers ap
proaching adulthood in wartime
doesn't have enough meat in it, and
Benjamin doesn't bring much to it
besides visual integrity and his skill

with actors, which in this case — al
though he's again working with very
good actors (Sean Penn, Elizabeth
McGovern, Nicolas Cage) — isn't suf
ficient to make the film memorable.
You can see what Kloves and Ben
jamin intended. The two friends
around whom the film is centered,
Henry (Penn) and Nicky (Cage), will

On the whole,
'Racing With the
Moon' is far from a
disaster.

be enlisting in a matter of months, so
school seems irrelevant and they feel
the urge to embrace all that life on the
home front can offer them before they

are caught up in the great war ad
venture. For Nicky that means sex; for
Henry, romance. In the early scenes in
which Henry courts Caddie
(McGovern) — particularly in one
moment when he leaps onto the back
of a moving bus she has boarded —
Benjamin approaches the sweetly sen
timental tone of Vincente Minnelli's
lovely WWII comedy-drama The
Clock, in which Robert Walker played
a soldier on 48-hour leave in New
York who fell in love with Judy Gar
land. (It's clear that the filmmakers
were thinking of The Clock, which
contains a similar scene. At one point,
Caddie even remarks that Henry
reminds her of Robert Walker — an
observation that might strike anyone
who has seen Walker but is unfamiliar
with the Minnelli film as very peculiar
indeed.
But Ihe sensibility of a 1940s love
story is too far from our own to be

recaptured; the film requires a dis
tancing irony or at least a more emo
tionally complex — more
contemporary — approach. Kloves
seems to know that it needs some kind
of transformation, so he makes it
sexier and throws in some darker ele
ments, but he hasn't much imagina
tion; he resorts to melodrama. Nicky
gets his girl friend, Sally (Suzanne Ad
kinson) pregnant, and he and Henry
have to round up money for an abor
tion, so Henry touches Caddie, who he
mistakenly believes is rich, and she at
tempts to steal a necklace from the
debutante in whose house Caddie's
mother works as a domestic. This
trumped-up plot development is
caught somewhere between the kind
of teen fiction popular in the '50s (the
heroine inadvertently leads the hero
to think she's an heiress; how can she
tell him the truth? and does he only
love her for her money?) and An Offi

cer and a Gentleman (with a twist —
the hero's best friend's girl turns out to
really be pregnant, and he's the one
with serious character flaws); it

It's a smooth
skinned, effectively
assembled period
piece.

renders the material both hysterical
and trivial, though the actors, espe
cially Sean Penn, play it with intelli
gence and tact. The two scenes
between Caddie and the rich girl,
Alice (Julie Phillips), are disastrous,
because Benjamin gets hopelessly
lost; trying to give them meaning and
context, he makes a pass at presenting
Alice — whom we never get to know

and consequently don't care about —
as some sort of tragic figure, and he
muddies the narrative with so many
vaguely ominous suggestions that we
expect her unstated relationship with
her father to turn out to be incestuous
and potentially violent, like that of the
fiancee and her father in Four Friends.
(It doesn't; we never see him again.)
On the whole, Racing with the
Moon is far from a disaster; it's very
pleasant to sit through, and in the
scenes between Sean Penn and
Elizabeth McGovern, the actors' en
dearing qualities shine through.
Nicolas Cage has some bright mo
ments, too, though sometimes you feel
he's a little too big for the movie. But
Kloves and Benjamin don't give these
three a great deal to struggle with, and
the picture doesn't move us tremen
dously or linger in the mind, the way
some trashier romances (like The Way
We Were) do. It's a bite-size movie.

a soldier on 48-hour leave in New
York who fell in love with Judy Gar
land. (It's clear that the filmmakers
were thinking of The Clock, which
contains a similar scene. At one point,
Caddie even remarks that Henry
reminds her of Robert Walker — an
observation that might strike anyone
who has seen Walker but is unfamiliar
with the Minnelli film as very peculiar
indeed.
But Ihe sensibility of a 1940s love
story is too far from our own to be

recaptured; the film requires a dis
tancing irony or at least a more emo
tionally complex — more
contemporary — approach. Kloves
seems to know that it needs some kind
of transformation, so he makes it
sexier and throws in some darker ele
ments, but he hasn't much imagina
tion; he resorts to melodrama. Nicky
gets his girl friend, Sally (Suzanne Ad
kinson) pregnant, and he and Henry
have to round up money for an abor
tion, so Henry touches Caddie, who he
mistakenly believes is rich, and she at
tempts to steal a necklace from the
debutante in whose house Caddie's
mother works as a domestic. This
trumped-up plot development is
caught somewhere between the kind
of teen fiction popular in the '50s (the
heroine inadvertently leads the hero
to think she's an heiress; how can she
tell him the truth? and does he only
love her for her money?) and An Offi

cer and a Gentleman (with a twist —
the hero's best friend's girl turns out to
really be pregnant, and he's the one
with serious character flaws); it

It's a smooth
skinned, effectively
assembled period
piece.

renders the material both hysterical
and trivial, though the actors, espe
cially Sean Penn, play it with intelli
gence and tact. The two scenes
between Caddie and the rich girl,
Alice (Julie Phillips), are disastrous,
because Benjamin gets hopelessly
lost; trying to give them meaning and
context, he makes a pass at presenting
Alice — whom we never get to know

and consequently don't care about —
as some sort of tragic figure, and he
muddies the narrative with so many
vaguely ominous suggestions that we
expect her unstated relationship with
her father to turn out to be incestuous
and potentially violent, like that of the
fiancee and her father in Four Friends.
(It doesn't; we never see him again.)
On the whole, Racing with the
Moon is far from a disaster; it's very
pleasant to sit through, and in the
scenes between Sean Penn and
Elizabeth McGovern, the actors' en
dearing qualities shine through.
Nicolas Cage has some bright mo
ments, too, though sometimes you feel
he's a little too big for the movie. But
Kloves and Benjamin don't give these
three a great deal to struggle with, and
the picture doesn't move us tremen
dously or linger in the mind, the way
some trashier romances (like The Way
We Were) do. It's a bite-size movie.
