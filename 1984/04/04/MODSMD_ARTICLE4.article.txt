# Would censor some research results
## Colleges fight DoD plan 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
University President Donald Ken
nedy warned the Reagan administra
tion last week that Stanford would
refuse to accept research funds which
carry a restriction now being consid
ered by the Department of Defense
(DoD) that would require prior ap
proval for publication of results.
In a short letter to administration
officials, Kennedy and the presidents
of the California Institutute of Tech
nology and the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology said the restric
tion would infringe on academic
freedom and violate longstanding uni
versity policies which preclude grants
requiring prior publication approval.
"We would be unable to accept re
search grants with these restrictions,"
Kennedy said yesterday. "We just
wanted them to know that these pro
posed restrictions wouldn't go down
with the universities," he said.
The letter was delivered to George
Keyworth, President Reagan's science
adviser, and Richard DeLauer, under
secretary of defense for research and
engineering. Other universities were
not asked to sign because the presi
dents wanted to send it as quickly as
possible.
Under the proposal, researchers
conducting unclassified applied DoD
research labeled "sensitive" would be
required to submit drafts of their
results 90 days before publication in
order to receive approval.
Dean of Graduate Studies and Re

search Gerald Lieberman said the
restriction would apply to "a very
small percentage" of the $25 to $30
million in DoD funds which the Uni
versity now receives.
In a meeting March 22, Pentagon
officials told Lieberman that the
restriction would apply to about 1 per
cent of DoD contracts based on the
types of contracts awarded the past

five years. Only 0.7 percent would re
quire prepublication review and possi
ble publication restrictions, the DoD
said.
But Lieberman said it is impossible
to predict exactly how many grants
would be labeled "sensitive" under
the proposal.
Lieberman said the restrictions are
based on an unwarranted fear of tech
nology transfer to the Soviet Union

and will only restrict the free How of
information.
"There's no evidence based on the
past that there's been any leakage of
information to the Eastern Bloc
countries," he said.
Lieberman said "the country could
suffer" if the University is forced to
reject grants because of the restric
tion.

"The isolated number of cases
where this might arise is very small.
The Department of Defense is making
an issue out of a non-issue," Lieber
man said.
Lieberman said he drd not believe
the DoD would retaliate by cutting
back other research funds if the Uni
versity refused to accept grants with
