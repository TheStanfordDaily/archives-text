# Would censor some research results
## Colleges fight DoD plan 
### DAVID AZRIN Daily staff 
University President Donald Ken
nedy warned the Reagan administra
tion last week that Stanford would
refuse to accept research funds which
carry a restriction now being consid
ered by the Department of Defense
(DoD) that would require prior ap
proval for publication of results.
In a short letter to administration
officials, Kennedy and the presidents
of the California Institutute of Tech
nology and the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology said the restric
tion would infringe on academic
freedom and violate longstanding uni
versity policies which preclude grants
requiring prior publication approval.
"We would be unable to accept re
search grants with these restrictions,"
Kennedy said yesterday. "We just
wanted them to know that these pro
posed restrictions wouldn't go down
with the universities," he said.
The letter was delivered to George
Keyworth, President Reagan's science
adviser, and Richard DeLauer, under
secretary of defense for research and
engineering. Other universities were
not asked to sign because the presi
dents wanted to send it as quickly as
possible.
Under the proposal, researchers
conducting unclassified applied DoD
research labeled "sensitive" would be
required to submit drafts of their
results 90 days before publication in
order to receive approval.
Dean of Graduate Studies and Re

search Gerald Lieberman said the
restriction would apply to "a very
small percentage" of the $25 to $30
million in DoD funds which the Uni
versity now receives.
In a meeting March 22, Pentagon
officials told Lieberman that the
restriction would apply to about 1 per
cent of DoD contracts based on the
types of contracts awarded the past

five years. Only 0.7 percent would re
quire prepublication review and possi
ble publication restrictions, the DoD
said.
But Lieberman said it is impossible
to predict exactly how many grants
would be labeled "sensitive" under
the proposal.
Lieberman said the restrictions are
based on an unwarranted fear of tech
nology transfer to the Soviet Union

and will only restrict the free How of
information.
"There's no evidence based on the
past that there's been any leakage of
information to the Eastern Bloc
countries," he said.
Lieberman said "the country could
suffer" if the University is forced to
reject grants because of the restric
tion.

"The isolated number of cases
where this might arise is very small.
The Department of Defense is making
an issue out of a non-issue," Lieber
man said.
Lieberman said he drd not believe
the DoD would retaliate by cutting
back other research funds if the Uni
versity refused to accept grants with

the proposed restriction.
"I think the DoD understands our
concerns," he said. "I do believe that
they and the research universities will
make an attempt to reach a compro
mise that will be acceptable to both."
he said.
Edith Martin, the Pentagon's dep
uty under secretary for research and
advanced technology, told the
Chronicle for Higher Education,
"You have to draw the line some
place."
She said she thought universities
would change their policies in order to
get Pentagon funds.
"At some point, the rubber hits the
road. When it comes down to it. just
how much money will Stanford be
willing to give up?" Martin asked.
Kennedy admitted that Martin's
remarks did not make a compromise
seem likely, but he noted that "she's
not going to make the decision."
Martin, co-chair of a DoD
university panel examining the effect
of export control laws on academic
scientists, discussed the restrictions
with Lieberman and officials from five
other universities during the March 22

panel meeting.
I.ieberman said he proposed a com
promise during the meeting which
would avoid the issue of approval. His
proposal would require researchers to
submit a draft of results 90 days
before publication onl> to give re
searchers time to omit portions
deemed harmful to national security
by the DoD.
"That would give the DoD opportu
nity to comment and try to convince
the faculty that the matter is sensitive
and that they should try to make cer
tain changes that would eliminate the
national security element from the
results," Lieberman said.
I.ieberman said that in "almost
every case" faculty would be willing to
eliminate sections designated harmful
to national security by the DoD.
"I believe the faculty would be
responsive," he said.
In cases where researchers refused
to omit certain results, the DoD could
classify the project.
But Martin told the Chronicle for
Higher Eductaion that the DoD had
no desire to expand the kinds of infor
mation it classifies. She said it needed
flexiblity to rapidly label new areas of
research as "sensitive" or to delete
them from that category, which rules
for classification do not allow.
