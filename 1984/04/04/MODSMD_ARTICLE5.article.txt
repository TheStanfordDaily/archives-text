### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
Police arrested a Stanford graduate
on charges of assault with a deadly
weapon yesterday after he allegedly
hit an 82-year-old jnan with a tennis
racquet at Tresidder Union.
Police followed Kevin King. a
graduate of Stanford and the Hastings
College of Law, into the Stanford
Bookstore shortly after the attack.
Once inside the Bookstore, King
threatened two police officers with a
knife before they subdued him, police
said.
Late last night, King was still in cus
tody at the North County Jail, ac
cording to a spokesman there who said
King would have a preliminary
hearing today.
Ellie Oppenheim, director of
Tresidder Union, said she had heard
reports that a man was swinging a ten
nis racquet near Marcel's bakery when

he "came into contact with an 82-
year-old man. It was my understand
ing that the man was hit but not hurt."
King has been incarcerated at least
twice before as a result of his infatua
tion with Caroline Kennedy, the

daughter of the late President John F.
Kennedy.
Three years ago in New York, King
was convicted of harassing Carolina
Kennedy with obscene marriag
proposals.
In June, King was apprehendec
again, this time in the offices of The
Daily, for making "veiled threats"
against University President Donald
Kennedy. "He wanted to get to
gether with Donald Kennedy to meet
with him on some world issues and he
wanted to have access to Caroline
Kennedy's phone number," Stanford
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer told
The Daily in June.
Niemeyer said that King may have
mistakenly believed that Donald and
Carolyn Kennedy were related.
King, now in his mid-30s, was
released in July after a 14-day evalua-

tion at the Valley Medical Center.
Since then. King has been seen at
Tresidder often, writing tiny com
ments in a crowded notebook.

Niemeyer told The Daily in June
that King is "apparently pretty dis
turbed." hut seemed "pretty docile."
"But a lot of people — (John)
Hinckley. Sarah Jane Moore — never
exhibit any overt violent tendencies
and then they just blow up one day."
Niemeyer said.
