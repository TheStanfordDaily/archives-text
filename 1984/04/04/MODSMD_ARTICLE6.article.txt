Silicon Valley microelectronics
firms are the primary target of Soviet
intelligence services, according to the
director of the Central Intelligence
Agency.
At the Palo Alto Hyatt yesterday,
CIA chief William Casey told 500
members of the Commonwealth Club
of California that technology transfer
from country to country is a major
cause of world instability.
"During the late 19705, the Soviets
got about 30,000 samples of Western
production equipment, weapon and
military components, and over
400,000 technical documents, both
classified and unclassified," Casey
said.
This stolen equipment translates to
about 70 percent of the most signifi
cant Soviet military equipment, Casey
said.
U.S. microelectronics production
technology is the most significant
technology acquired by the Soviets
since the end of World War 11. "Your
firms here in Silicon Valley are at the
very top of their list. The Soviets espe
cially pinpoint and target small, highly
innovative companies in the computer
and microelectronics field," he said.
Casey also discussed what he calls
the growing threat of Soviet nuclear
forces.
"The Soviets have a large and
growing arsenal of nuclear weapons
which are aimed at the United States,
western Europe and East Asia," he
said. Soviet radar deployments could
heavily sway the strategic balance
against the United States, Casey said.
"On the European front, the War
saw Fact forces are being deployed in
an increasingly aggressive way and
backed up with long-range missiles
which can reach European capitals."
he said.
Soviet power has been established

in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Africa, the
Caribbean and Central America, he
said.
"Lead time," or the rapidity with
which the Soviets gain access to
American technological secrets, is also
a major problem, Casey said.
"They've been so successful in get
ting technology early that we know
there have been occasions where they
have been able to develop counter

measure before we have deployed our
weapons systems," he said.
Casey also said that terrorism has
become a vehicle through which to
disrupt the foreign policies of other
governments.
"We count over 50 major
organizations and a great many more
mom-and-pop shops which can be
hired by Iran, Syria, Libya and other
radical governments," he said.
Casey told the audience that the in
telligence agency "gets a lot of flak."
"Everything imaginable is charged
to secret intelligence activities. Its pur
pose and activities are widely mis
represented," he said.
When asked how he felt about the
presidential race. Casey joked that he
took a vow of "political chastity"
when he took his present post.
