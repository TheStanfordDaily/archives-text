Ministers criticize new weapon
Cesme, Turkey — NATO defense ministers meeting here
yesterday expressed skepticism and nervousness about U.S.
plans to prepare for war in space, according to military offi
cials from several countries.
The ministers listened politely as Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger explained his administration's plans to develop a
comprehensive space-based missile defense and defended its
decision not to seek a treaty with the Soviet Union banning
anti-satellite weapons. After the session, which U.S. officials
had predicted would be "harmonious," several allied minis
ters indicated they were not altogether reassured.
"My impression is the Europeans were broadly united in
their critical questions," West German Defense Minister
Manfred Woerner said, referring to what the Reagan admin
istration calls its "strategic defense initiative." He added: "I
can't see that it would provide greater protection or stability.
I can only hope it would give an incentive for arms control."
Woerner's comments were echoed by other ministers as a
meeting that was supposed to be calm and almost celebratory
took place amid some uneasiness. The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's Nuclear Planning Group is meeting for the
first time since beginning deployment of cruise and Pershing
II missiles in Europe.
Bomb kills 3 in South Africa
Johannesburg, South Africa — Three persons were killed
and five seriously injured when a large car-bomb exploded in
South Africa's Indian Ocean port of Durban early yesterday.
Although the African National Congress did not immedi
ately claim responsibility for the terrorist attack, the black in
surgent group's headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, said in a
response to queries, "We are awaiting confirmation" that un
derground members within South Africa planted the bomb.
The bombing came two weeks after South Africa signed a
nonaggression pact with neighboring Mozambique, long a
African National Congress sanctuary. The blast could be in
terpreted as the group's reply to South Africa's current pres
sure diplomacy campaign on neighboring black states to sup
press the insurgents' activity within their borders.
The Durban bombing appeared to be "ANC sayng we can
infiltrate your borders whatever you do," one diplomatic ob
server said.
Soon after the March 16 signing of the accord with Mozam
bique, South African Foreign Minister Roelof "Pik" Botha
had cautioned that the black nationalists would undoubtedly
be able to continue to carry out terrorism within South Africa
despite a curb on their presence in the neighboring country.
Lebanon security committee
fails to show any progress
Beirut, Lebanon — A security committee formed to stabi
lize the routinely violated cease-fire in Beirut has failed in
four marathon meetings to make any headway in separating
Lebanon's warring sectarian factions.
Creation of the committee was the only concrete achieve
ment of the Lebanese national unity conference that met last
month in Lausanne, Switzerland.
But deeply engrained mistrust and attempts by the fac
tional representatives to inject political demands into com
mittee discussions ostensibly limited to security matters has
prevented action on key issues such us the reopening of
Beirut's port and international airport and the proposed dis
engagement of militias at the Green Line separating the Mos
lem and Christian sectors of the capital.
Apart from doing little to halt the daily exchanges of ar
tillery and machine gun fire across the dividing line and
around the strategic mountain town of Suq al Gharb, the
committee's lack of progress has left officials of Lebanon's
paramilitary Internal Security Force uncertain about their
role in restoring peace.
"The security committee and what is happening on the
ground are very far apart. I am afraid it (the fighting) is not
finished yet," Col. Issam Abu Zekhe, head of the force's red
bereted Squad 16 said Tuesday in an interview. Squad 16 is a
heavily armed unit charged with separating warring militias
and maintaining security in Beirut's hottest spots.
Guinean officers stage coup
Mid-level officers of the Guinean Army seized power in an
early morning coup yesterday into a large power vacuum that
had followed the death eight days ago of the small West
African nation's longtime ruler, Ahmed Sekou Toure.
The new rulers did not report any resistance in their
repeated broadcasts over Radio Conakry, but a State Depart
ment official said there was small arms fire in the outskirts of
the capital from early morning to noon.
The coup follows a familiar pattern of army takeovers in
West Africa recently, such as Liberia, Ghana and Upper
Volta, where junior officers have seized power and then dis
missed their senior officers along with the previous govern
ment. The one exception is the New Year's Eve coup in
Nigeria where senior Army officers reportedly moved to
preempt a junior officer coup.
Guineans and foreigners were first informed about the
coup in a 7 a.m. radio announcement that began, "The na
tion's armed forces have decided to take charge of running
the country," news agencies reported.
An unidentified Army spokesman of the now-ruling Mili
tary Redemption Committee, made up of 18 colonels,
majors, captains and a lieutenant, said in the broadcast that
the Guinean armed forces had taken over the government to
end a "bloody and ruthless dictatorship."
U.S., Soviets moving toward
new talks on exchanges
Washington — In meetings in Washington and Moscow,
the United States and the Soviet Union appear to be making
progress toward the resumption of negotiations on cultural
and scientific exchanges that have been suspended since
1980, Reagan administration officials said yesterday.
U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Arthur Hartman,
who returned to Moscow after nearly two weeks of consulta
tions in Washington, met for 50 minutes with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko yesterday. That session followed
an extensive discussion in Washington late Monday between
Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin.
Dobrynin, emerging after the nearly two-hour meeting, ac
knowledged that negotiations had begun on renewing the cul
tural and scientific exchanges. And he said his talks with
Shultz touched on "the whole range" of U.S.-Soviet relations.
Stock prices lose ground
New York — Stock prices lost ground for the fourth
straight session today in the face of rising interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.40 to
1148.76, bringing its loss over the past four sessions to 25.86
points.
Declines outpaced advances by about five to three on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume was an estimated 88.57 million shares,
against 85.68 million in the previous session.

ters indicated they were not altogether reassured.
"My impression is the Europeans were broadly united in
their critical questions," West German Defense Minister
Manfred Woerner said, referring to what the Reagan admin
istration calls its "strategic defense initiative." He added: "I
can't see that it would provide greater protection or stability.
I can only hope it would give an incentive for arms control."
Woerner's comments were echoed by other ministers as a
meeting that was supposed to be calm and almost celebratory
took place amid some uneasiness. The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's Nuclear Planning Group is meeting for the
first time since beginning deployment of cruise and Pershing
II missiles in Europe.
Bomb kills 3 in South Africa
Johannesburg, South Africa — Three persons were killed
and five seriously injured when a large car-bomb exploded in
South Africa's Indian Ocean port of Durban early yesterday.
Although the African National Congress did not immedi
ately claim responsibility for the terrorist attack, the black in
surgent group's headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, said in a
response to queries, "We are awaiting confirmation" that un
derground members within South Africa planted the bomb.
The bombing came two weeks after South Africa signed a
nonaggression pact with neighboring Mozambique, long a
African National Congress sanctuary. The blast could be in
terpreted as the group's reply to South Africa's current pres
sure diplomacy campaign on neighboring black states to sup
press the insurgents' activity within their borders.
The Durban bombing appeared to be "ANC sayng we can
infiltrate your borders whatever you do," one diplomatic ob
server said.
Soon after the March 16 signing of the accord with Mozam
bique, South African Foreign Minister Roelof "Pik" Botha
had cautioned that the black nationalists would undoubtedly
be able to continue to carry out terrorism within South Africa
despite a curb on their presence in the neighboring country.
Lebanon security committee
fails to show any progress
Beirut, Lebanon — A security committee formed to stabi
lize the routinely violated cease-fire in Beirut has failed in
four marathon meetings to make any headway in separating
Lebanon's warring sectarian factions.
Creation of the committee was the only concrete achieve
ment of the Lebanese national unity conference that met last
month in Lausanne, Switzerland.
But deeply engrained mistrust and attempts by the fac
tional representatives to inject political demands into com
mittee discussions ostensibly limited to security matters has
prevented action on key issues such us the reopening of
Beirut's port and international airport and the proposed dis
engagement of militias at the Green Line separating the Mos
lem and Christian sectors of the capital.
Apart from doing little to halt the daily exchanges of ar
tillery and machine gun fire across the dividing line and
around the strategic mountain town of Suq al Gharb, the
committee's lack of progress has left officials of Lebanon's
paramilitary Internal Security Force uncertain about their
role in restoring peace.
"The security committee and what is happening on the
ground are very far apart. I am afraid it (the fighting) is not
finished yet," Col. Issam Abu Zekhe, head of the force's red
bereted Squad 16 said Tuesday in an interview. Squad 16 is a
heavily armed unit charged with separating warring militias
and maintaining security in Beirut's hottest spots.
Guinean officers stage coup
Mid-level officers of the Guinean Army seized power in an
early morning coup yesterday into a large power vacuum that
had followed the death eight days ago of the small West
African nation's longtime ruler, Ahmed Sekou Toure.
The new rulers did not report any resistance in their
repeated broadcasts over Radio Conakry, but a State Depart
ment official said there was small arms fire in the outskirts of
the capital from early morning to noon.
The coup follows a familiar pattern of army takeovers in
West Africa recently, such as Liberia, Ghana and Upper
Volta, where junior officers have seized power and then dis
missed their senior officers along with the previous govern
ment. The one exception is the New Year's Eve coup in
Nigeria where senior Army officers reportedly moved to
preempt a junior officer coup.
Guineans and foreigners were first informed about the
coup in a 7 a.m. radio announcement that began, "The na
tion's armed forces have decided to take charge of running
the country," news agencies reported.
An unidentified Army spokesman of the now-ruling Mili
tary Redemption Committee, made up of 18 colonels,
majors, captains and a lieutenant, said in the broadcast that
the Guinean armed forces had taken over the government to
end a "bloody and ruthless dictatorship."
U.S., Soviets moving toward
new talks on exchanges
Washington — In meetings in Washington and Moscow,
the United States and the Soviet Union appear to be making
progress toward the resumption of negotiations on cultural
and scientific exchanges that have been suspended since
1980, Reagan administration officials said yesterday.
U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Arthur Hartman,
who returned to Moscow after nearly two weeks of consulta
tions in Washington, met for 50 minutes with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko yesterday. That session followed
an extensive discussion in Washington late Monday between
Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin.
Dobrynin, emerging after the nearly two-hour meeting, ac
knowledged that negotiations had begun on renewing the cul
tural and scientific exchanges. And he said his talks with
Shultz touched on "the whole range" of U.S.-Soviet relations.

Ministers criticize new weapon
Cesme, Turkey — NATO defense ministers meeting here
yesterday expressed skepticism and nervousness about U.S.
plans to prepare for war in space, according to military offi
cials from several countries.
The ministers listened politely as Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger explained his administration's plans to develop a
comprehensive space-based missile defense and defended its
decision not to seek a treaty with the Soviet Union banning
anti-satellite weapons. After the session, which U.S. officials
had predicted would be "harmonious," several allied minis
ters indicated they were not altogether reassured.
"My impression is the Europeans were broadly united in
their critical questions," West German Defense Minister
Manfred Woerner said, referring to what the Reagan admin
istration calls its "strategic defense initiative." He added: "I
