From the Los Angeles Times
Jerusalem — Israel assigned heavily
armed paramilitary police to patrol its
streets yesterday, sealed off its border
with Lebanon and cut off Israeli
occupied south Lebanon from the rest of
the country in the wake of a terrorist at
tack that injured 48 people.
The increased security measures came
as Israel's armed forces radio station re
ported a Lebanese man and a Japanese-
American woman were suspected of as
sisting three Palestinians in the Monday
attack, in which a downtown Jerusalem
intersection was sprayed with hand
grenades and automatic weapons fire.
The report said the couple was

believed to have left Israel following the
assault. It did not spell out the role the
two. who were not further identified,
were believed to have played.
One of the guerrillas who carried out
the assault was killed and the other two
were arrested.
In Damascus, Syria, the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
which earlier claimed responsibility for
the attack, said it captured an Israeli sol
dier in south Lebanon and would hold
him pending an exchange for a number
of Palestinians in Israeli jails, including
the two attackers arrested Monday. The
organization identified the Israeli soldier
as Cpl. Samir Assad, a Druse.

The Israeli military command refused
to confirm or deny that one of its soldiers
had been captured by the Marxist
oriented splinter group of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization.
Israeli sources said at least two of the
attackers were residents of the coastal
town of Sidon in Israeli occupied south
Lebanon. The sources said the two
crossed the Israel-Lebanon border
during the weekend.
Prior to Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon, Sidon was a PLO stronghold.
The town has remained a center of anti
occupation agitation.
In response to the attack. Israel closed

both of the crossing points on the Israel-
Lebanon border. It also stopped all traf
fic on the two Awali River bridges that
connect the Israeli-occupied zone with
the rest of Lebanon, totally isolating
South Lebanon. Only person with rarely
granted special passes were allowed to
enter or leave this zone.
Although at least two of the terrorists
were believed to have yome from Israeli
controlled territory, top Israeli officials
strongly implied they hold Syria respon
sible for the attack and hinted at retalia
tion. For its part. Syria's official
Damascus radio said the attack signaled
an escalation of acts of resistance against
the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon.
