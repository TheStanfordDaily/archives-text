# Smith will stay until successor chosen

From The Washington Post
Washington â€” President Reagan won a pledge yes
terday from Attorney General William French Smith to
remain in office until his successor is confirmed and in
structed "all members of the administration to
cooperate fully" with the special prosecutor's investiga
tion of White House counselor Edwin Meese.
Smith, who resigned Jan. 23 to return to his Califor
nia law practice, had expressed a desire to leave office
soon, perhaps before Meese could be confirmed by the
Senate as his successor. Meese's confirmation hearings
have been delayed until completion of an investigation
into his personal finances and other matters.
The prospect of Meese's departure before a Senate
vote had touched off worried speculation in the White

House about the appointment of an interim or acting
attorney general. Some presidential assistants feared
that if this became necessary it would develop into a
campaign issue and could undermine support for
Meese's nomination.
But Smith came to the Oval Office yesterday at
Reagan's behest and, at the president's request, agreed
to remain until the Senate confirms his successor.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes announced.
"This, we believe, will leave the Department of
Justice in experienced hands, providing continuity
during this period," Speakes said. He added that Smith
waited until after the appointment of an "independent
counsel" or special prosecutor to address the question
of how long he would remain in office.

Administration officials said last week that they ex
pected Smith to leave soon, but they reported that the
attorney general was under pressure from the White
House to stay on, particularly because the position of
deputy attorney general has been vacant since Edward
Schmults left earlier this year to become general coun
sel of GTE Corp. A Justice Department spokesman
said the deputy's job and other vacancies would be
filled "as soon as possible."
Speakes said yesterday that Reagan "reaffirms" his
support for the Meese nomination. Reagan said in a
written statement that he is "pleased" that a judicial
panel has "acted promptly" in naming Jacob Stein, a
Washington attorney, to look into allegations about
Meese.
