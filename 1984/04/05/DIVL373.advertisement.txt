Get in
on the
action
Americans are
action-oriented - we
don't just sit back and
wait for things to
happen - we make
them happen. You can
make things happen
in cancer control.
When you include the
American Cancer So
ciety in your will,
when you give securi
ties, when you par
ticipate in a pooled
income fund or make
the Society a bene
ficiary of life insur
ance or an annuity,
you are part of the
action —the action
against cancer.

provide tax advan
tages but there's
more to them than
that. They provide
funds for research,
public education and
patient service and
help improve the
quality of life for
cancer patients.

SOME PEOPLE
RETIRE WITH
MORE
THANJUSTA
GOLD WATCH.
You work hard all
your life and what
do you get?
Well, depending
on where you work,
you could get cancer.
Over the next
several years the
American Cancer
Society will be con
ducting more research
into certain lifestyles
and exposures which
could increase cancer
mortality.
So know the
risks.
Don't smoke.
Look for the
warning signs of
cancer.
And retire not
only with a gold
ticker.
But a healthy
one, also.
