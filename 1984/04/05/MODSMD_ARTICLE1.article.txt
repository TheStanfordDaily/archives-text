# Forum funding uncertain
## Special senate convened 
### BOB BARCKLAY Daily staff 
With only one day left before the
start of a three-day conference on
public policy initiated by the ASSU
Lobby Office, organizers are experi
encing budget difficulties on two
separate fronts.
A special ASSU Senate meeting has
been called tonight due to changes in
the budget of the Guest Professorship
Bureau (GPB). The GPB is sponsor
ing one session of the conference and
must have its new budget approved by
the senate before it can allocate funds
for the forum.
At the same time, the Lobby Office
is having difficulty raising its share of
the conference's cost and has solicited
more than 30 dorms this week in an
attempt to raise the needed funds.
According to Jug Jagadish, chair
man of the senate, the problems en
countered by the GPB are a result of a
change in the scheduled speaker at the
session it is sponsoring, entitled "The
Environment, Energy and Public
Policy."
According to Jagadish, administra
tors within the GPB had initially
planned to have Dave Brower, a guest
professor at Stanford this quarter,
speak at the conference. Jagadish ex
plained that because Brower is already
on campus, the costs of having him
speak were minimal. Normally, a
speakers' traveling and accommoda
tion costs must be covered.
But all this changed when Brower
notified the GPB during Dead Week
that he would not be able to speak at
the conference, Jagadish said. As a
result, the GPB chose to invite two
off-campus speakers, soft energy ex
perts Amory and Hunter Lovins.
Jagadish said the change in speakers
caused a "signifigant increase in the
cost of the panel" and that the new
budget, like all large expenditures by
the GPB, must be approved by the
senate before they can spend the
money.
Last night, the GPB budget request
was voted down by the senate appro
priations committee and organizers
must now wait until the outcome of a
senate vote tonight before they know
whether or not they will be able to af
ford the $3500 price tag of their
scheduled session.
ASSU officials offered differing ex
planations for the measure's defeat.
COP member Vinnie Freda said he
"would be very suprised if the new
budget doesn't pass," and added that
it probably lost in the appropriations
committee because the group is
"made up of the most conservative
people in the ASSU."

John Hoffmire. director ot the
Lobby Office, said the budget lost for
"procedural reasons more than anyth
ing else." According to Hoffmire,
some committee members were not
happy with an unofficial practice
which occurs after the appropriations
committee passes a proposal. If a pro
posal is passed it doesn't have to go to
senate for debate if a majority of
senators sign a petition supporting it
and the chairman accepts this petition.
Jagadish said some senators feel
"there is a large difference between
voting for a proposal in the senate
after debate and signing a petition."
He pointed out that persons' decisions
could be changed by debate or that a
person might get pressured into sign
ing a petition.
By voting against the proposal,
members unhappy with the practice of
signing a petition were able to force a
senate vote on the issue.
At the same time, the Lobby Office
has experienced problems of its own.
Estimates on the amount of money
that must still be Raised have ranged
from $1000 to $3000 dollars.
"I was under the impression that

they were $3000 dollars short of their
goal," said COP member Peter
Spivack.
Officially, the Lobby Office claims
it has only $1000 dollars left to raise,
following a contribution of $1000
from the Medical School, according to
Hoffmire.
In an effort to raise the rest of
nearly $30,000 they need to pay for
the conference, organizers have
turned to students. Organizers visited
more than 30 campus residences this
week asking for funds to defray the
cost of the event. Hoffmire said he
was confident his office would be able
to raise enough money to cover the
cost of the conference.
Officials expect 2000 to 3000
people to attend the campus confer
ence this weekend.
