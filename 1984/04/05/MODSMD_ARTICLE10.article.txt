Washington (AP) — President Reagan
declared yesterday night that Congress
"must take a responsibility" for a loss of
U.S. credibility in the Middle East and
said of the debate on U.S. policy in
Lebanon: "All we do is stimulate the ter
rorists and urge them on."
Speaking of congressional criticism of
his decision to deploy the Marines in
Lebanon and to keep them at Beirut In
ternational Airport even after many
were killed in a terrorist attack on their

headquarters last fall. Reagan said the
only thing such discussion can do is
worsen the situation.
"Once the force is committed," he
said, "you have rendered them inef
fective when you conduct that kind of a
debate in public."
Reagan said foreign policy must be in
the province of the president, the con
stitutional commander in chief.
"I don't think that a committee of 535

persons can offer the guidance needed,
he said in his nationally televised news
conference.
"In the last 10 years, the Congress has
imposed about 150 restrictions on the
president's power in international
diplomacy," he said. "I think the Consti
tution makes it pretty plain back in the
beginning how diplomacy was to he con
ducted."
The administration has been stressing

that Congress must share responsibility
for the failure of Reagan's policy to
achieve its goals in Lebanon — a stable
government and the withdrawal of
Syrian and Israeli forces.
On March 1, Secretary of State
George Shultz told a Senate subcommit
tee that the congressional debate on
keeping the Marines in the Beirut area
"just totally took the rug out from under
U.S. interests" by leading the Syrians to
question U.S. resolve.
