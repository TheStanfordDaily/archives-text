## Greek housing may increase 
### DIANE PATTERSON Staff writer 
The Task Force on Fraternities
and Sororities at Stanford held the
first ol two planned forums yester
day, eliciting student comment on
whether fraternities and sororities
should be provided with more on
campus housing.
The Task Force will make a re
commendation to Dean of Students
James Lyons in early June on whe
ther the University should offer
more residences to subjectively
selective groups — fraternities,
sororities and some co-ops. Yester
day's forum focused on the behav
ior, governing systems, housing
needs, homogeneous elements and
contribution to residential educa
tion made by subjectively selective
living groups.
"Fraternities offer a comfortable
situation ... a resource," Delta
Upsilon President Luke Cole said
at yesterday's forum, adding that
Greek houses "mirror the student
body."
Fraternity members agreed that
the more sensational, destructive

actions taken by some overshadow
the campuswide commitments
made by a large number of frater
nity members, such as holding of
fice in the ASSU and organizing
community activities. Fraternities
promote close, intense living and
offer group support for one an
other, members said.
Those opposed to the idea of al
lowing any more houses whose
members are picked by those
already living there countered that
the fraternity system stifles the di
versity that Stanford cultivates.
Fraternities also foster sexism,
homophobia, alcoholism, destruc
tion and violence, among other
negative characteristics, they said.
Some members of sororities
noted that because sororities
receive no University housing, the
resulting long-term separation of
members make it difficult to orga
nize activities effectively.
Rob Blum, a member of Delta
Upsilon, said he believed that in a
university where students choose
their own major and style of living
it would be inconsistent not to al

low students to choose their own
living arrangements.
Clark Beyer, a member of Zeta
Psi, a fraternity forced off campus
two years ago by the University,
said that "behavioral problems are
not contingent upon (on-campus)
housing," adding that fraternal or
ganizations will experience prob
lems whether they are housed or
not.
"Students will choose people
with whom they share a lifestyle.
They lose opportunity for meeting
others," said Benjamin Austin, a
resident assistant in the American
Studies House.
Austin emphasized one of the
primary goals of Stanford's Resi
dential Education program is that
students are exposed to as much of
the diversity available on the
campus as possible. A certain
camaraderie and comfort develops
among those in living situations
like that of the fraternity, and Aus
tin questioned "to what degree
comfort should be a goal" in
making residential decisions.
