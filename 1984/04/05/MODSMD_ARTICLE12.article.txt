# Panel discusses proliferation
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The United States has lost its lead
ership in horizontal nuclear prolifera
tion and must strive to prevent the
proliferation of nuclear weapons to
foreign countries, according to John
Taylor, vice president of the Electric
Power Research Institute.
Taylor was joined by Henry Rowen,
professor of public management at the
Graduate School of Business and a
Hoover senior research fellow, and
Law School Prof. John Barton for a
panel discussion before an audience of
about 70 last night in Kresge
Auditorium. Former California Rep.
Paul "Pete" McCloskey moderated
the panel.
Taylor stressed the importance of
improving controls of the Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency
(lAEA) as a means of preventing
proliferation of nuclear weapons to
foreign nations.
"The lAEA could benefit from
better-trained inspectors," he said.
"They could also be better-staffed and

better-equipped."
Taylor said the 197H Nuclear
Proliferation Treaty has impaired the
ability of the United States to control
enrichment, or fuel, services for other
countries' nuclear reactors, ending a
period of U.S. technological leader
ship.
He advised dismantling warheads as
both a symbolic and a pragmatic
gesture which would indicate to the
world a U.S. desire to curtail the arms
race and would also provide great
amounts of electrical energy.
"The technology is now available to
transform nuclear warheads into fuel
and to burn the fuel to make
electricity," he said. The fuel could
serve as an economic incentive for
countries to follow the guidelines of
the 1978 Nuclear Proliferation Treaty,
he said.
Rowen expressed optimism about
present U.S. policy, justifying current
U.S. foreign policy and saying that test
ban treaties are irrelevant to prolifera
tion controL
"If the United States seriously

reduces its foreign commitments . . .
many countries will move closer to nu
clear weapons and make this world a
more dangerous place than it already
is," he said.
Barton said the 1978 treaty is no
longer effective, noting that in Iraq's
recent use of chemical warfare, a sit
uation roughly analogous to nuclear
war, the United States has been reluc
tant to enforce any sanctions.
"By the end of the century," he
said, "every country desiring nuclear
weapons will be able to get them."
McCloskey offered an admittedly
pessimistic political outlook for the
future of proliferation control.
"If there are to be changes in (the
U.S. stance on) nuclear proliferation,
it will not come from Congress," he
said. "No one in politics wants to
make nuclear proliferation an issue."
Fewer than a half-dozen students
attended the panel discussion, which
was sponsored by the United Nations
Association of the United States of
America and the Stanford Model
United Nations Club.
