As the controversy continues to swirl around
President Reagan's nomination of Edwin Meese
to succeed Willam French Smith as attorney gen
eral, a potential problem has come to light which
could have effects far beyond the fate of this par
ticular appointment. The problem, seemingly in
congruous, is friendship and personal loyalty.
When he entered office, Reagan drew heavily
upon his friends and associates to fill the impor
tant, policy-sensitive appointive positions. There
is nothing peculiar or unusual about that.
Upon appointment to any office, however, the
relationship between the president and the friend
must change. No longer are they simply buddies;
the fundamental nexus of their relationship is now
employer/employee. Both the president and the
appointee must now realize the president's pri
mary responsibility is no longer to the friendship,
hut to the duties of the presidency and the admin
istration of this nation.
Regrettably, this transformation from friend to
subordinate has not taken place in the Reagan ad
ministration; many of his appointees — Meese in
particular — enjoy a special and indeed danger
ous relationship with the president.

Meese has come under fire for questionable
business practices. Others were forced to resign
after possible abuse of high-level positions. And
yet Reagan continues to defend these appointees
long past their effectiveness in his administration.
This trend must eventually cast shadows on the
president.
The case at hand is particularly sensitive. The
attorney general, as the highest law enforcement
official in the country, must be completely above
reproach if he or she is to carry out the responsi
bilities of the office effectively and competently.
It is now obvious that Messe is certainly not above
reproach and may well not even be above prose
cution.
Given this set of circumstances, it is incon
ceivable that Reagan does not realize Meese's in
ability to function effectively as attorney general.
And yet Reagan clings to men like Meese, most
likely out of a sense of friendship and loyalty.
Reagan can't let friendship stand in the way of
effective government. The president must
straighten out his priorities and put his service to
the public above his service to a friend. Meese's
nomination should be withdrawn.
