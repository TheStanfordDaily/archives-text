## Apathy abounds at Stanford 
### 
I should like to congratulate Jeff
Benz on his informative and interest
ing column (Daily, Feb. 29). On the
subject of our and the Soviet ASAT
programs, I recently obtained
valuable information from "Space for
All People." a publication of the
Progressive Space Forum in San
Francisco. The earliest system
developed by the Russians was
primitive; it had a long intercept
period and the tests were about 75
percent successful. The rocket used is
150 feet tall and is a ground-launch
system. The U.S. counterpart is an
18-foot, air-launched missile, similar
to the cruise. Our ASAT, like the
Russian, is limited to low-earth orbit
and is still rather primitive and inef
fectual.
Benz points out correctly that
continued ASAT research and devel
opment are destabilizing because an
optimum system will be used to blind
the enemy — to knock out communi
cation and defense-alert system. The
adjectives "erazy" and "hare
brained" are too polite in my opinion.
Benz describes our apathy and
indifference well. This country is in
an oddly slumbrous state. I find it
strange that so many American
citizens, especially those living com
fortably on the Peninsula, take quite
seriously their duty to vote in national
and even local elections, and fail to
realize that citizenship involves a bit
more than just voting.
1 found Benz's statement "We, as
individuals, no longer control the
events which affect, even dictate the
substance of our lives; rather, we are
affected by decisions made by others,
by events no one person controls,"
sobering — and true — because 1
suppose I shall never be able to resign
myself to accepting the widespread
apathy I observe around me, espe
cially at Stanford. It is a dangerous
inactivity and a cowardly abdication
of responsibility for the children and
for our fellow living creatures, and,
finally, this same indifference indi
cates an odd disregard for life itself.
Do we hate being alive? Do we prefer
to die: to be burnt, blasted away and
irradiated?
And so I agree with Benz in

deploring the "muted and transient
murmur" with which Stanford stu
dents and faculty and administration
greet an event like the development
of ASATs. Much of the research may
very likely take place at Stanford or
in Sunnyvale or San Jose, and will be
viewed, without a demur, as
"business as usual" by all of us. Years
ago, Emily Dickinson had some
refreshing things to say about con
formity and dissent:
Much madness is divinest sense
to a discerning eye;
Much sense the starkest madness.
'Tis the majority
In this, as all, prevails.
Assent, and you are sane;
Demur, — you're straightway
dangerous,
And handled with a chain.

Society needs
to rehabilitate
In the couple of days following the
defacement of "Gay Liberation," I
listened to a number of friends and
acquaintances express amazement
that such an outrageous act would
take place, especially here.
We should be furious, but we
shouldn't be amazed. What happened
to the sculpture lies somewhere near
the middle of a spectrum of frequent
violence against homosexuals that
ranges from fag/lesbo jokes (how
many of us heard someone "jokingly"
celebrate the defacement?) to assault,
battery and murder. The Tom Robin
son Band, in "Glad to be Gay,"
describes the latter end of this spec
trum as it shows itself in Britain,
another locale that prides itself on
"civility":
Don't try to kid us, but if you're
discreet
You're perfectly safe as you walk
down the street.
You don't have to mince or make
bitchy remarks,
To get beaten unconscious and left

in the dark.
I had a friend who was gentle and
short.
He was lonely one evening. He
went for a walk.
Queer-bashers caught him. kicked
in his teeth.
He was only hospitalized for a
week.
And he still bears the scars.
It happens all the time, and most
all of us bear some responsibility.
Perhaps we need look no further than
ourselves to discover some of the true
culprits in the crime of March 6.
But having captured guilty parties,
we certainly can't just release them
back onto the streets to continue their
destructive, anti-social behavior!
Resocialization and rehabilitation is
needed. Here are some actions we
straights can take to change ourselves
and reduce societal violence towards
gays:
• Openly confront and challenge
anti-gay behaviof in ourselves and in
others.
• Privately and publicly express our
affection for our same-sex friends,
openly acknowledge and accept their
expressions of affection for us and not
come down on others when they
share similar feelings.
• Educate ourselves. See the movie
Coming Out; read the Kinsey report
on human sexuality; listen to the
music of Joan Armatrading and Chris
Williamson; bring members of the
Gay Speakers Bureau into our
residences to talk and lead discus
sions; attend events sponsored by the
gay community.
• Don't avoid talking with our gay
friends, if they want to, about their
lives and relationships.
• Speak out about the issues in our
classes, at the dining table and among
our straight friends.
• Get together with members of
our gender and talk about our
feelings and thoughts on
homosexuality.
• Ask members of the gay commu
nity what support they need from us
in their struggles for liberation.

You're perfectly safe as you walk
down the street.
You don't have to mince or make
bitchy remarks,
To get beaten unconscious and left

in the dark.
I had a friend who was gentle and
short.
He was lonely one evening. He
went for a walk.
Queer-bashers caught him. kicked
in his teeth.
He was only hospitalized for a
week.
And he still bears the scars.
It happens all the time, and most
all of us bear some responsibility.
Perhaps we need look no further than
ourselves to discover some of the true
culprits in the crime of March 6.
But having captured guilty parties,
we certainly can't just release them
back onto the streets to continue their
destructive, anti-social behavior!
Resocialization and rehabilitation is
needed. Here are some actions we
straights can take to change ourselves
and reduce societal violence towards
gays:
• Openly confront and challenge
anti-gay behaviof in ourselves and in
others.
• Privately and publicly express our
affection for our same-sex friends,
openly acknowledge and accept their
expressions of affection for us and not
come down on others when they
share similar feelings.
• Educate ourselves. See the movie
Coming Out; read the Kinsey report
on human sexuality; listen to the
music of Joan Armatrading and Chris
Williamson; bring members of the
Gay Speakers Bureau into our
residences to talk and lead discus
sions; attend events sponsored by the
gay community.
• Don't avoid talking with our gay
friends, if they want to, about their
lives and relationships.
• Speak out about the issues in our
classes, at the dining table and among
our straight friends.
• Get together with members of
our gender and talk about our
feelings and thoughts on
homosexuality.
• Ask members of the gay commu
nity what support they need from us
in their struggles for liberation.

I should like to congratulate Jeff
Benz on his informative and interest
ing column (Daily, Feb. 29). On the
subject of our and the Soviet ASAT
programs, I recently obtained
valuable information from "Space for
All People." a publication of the
Progressive Space Forum in San
Francisco. The earliest system
developed by the Russians was
primitive; it had a long intercept
period and the tests were about 75
percent successful. The rocket used is
150 feet tall and is a ground-launch
system. The U.S. counterpart is an
18-foot, air-launched missile, similar
to the cruise. Our ASAT, like the
Russian, is limited to low-earth orbit
and is still rather primitive and inef
fectual.
Benz points out correctly that
continued ASAT research and devel
opment are destabilizing because an
optimum system will be used to blind
the enemy — to knock out communi
cation and defense-alert system. The
adjectives "erazy" and "hare
brained" are too polite in my opinion.
Benz describes our apathy and
indifference well. This country is in
an oddly slumbrous state. I find it
strange that so many American
citizens, especially those living com
fortably on the Peninsula, take quite
seriously their duty to vote in national
and even local elections, and fail to
realize that citizenship involves a bit
more than just voting.
1 found Benz's statement "We, as
individuals, no longer control the
events which affect, even dictate the
substance of our lives; rather, we are
affected by decisions made by others,
by events no one person controls,"
sobering — and true — because 1
suppose I shall never be able to resign
myself to accepting the widespread
apathy I observe around me, espe
cially at Stanford. It is a dangerous
inactivity and a cowardly abdication
of responsibility for the children and
for our fellow living creatures, and,
finally, this same indifference indi
cates an odd disregard for life itself.
Do we hate being alive? Do we prefer
to die: to be burnt, blasted away and
irradiated?
And so I agree with Benz in

deploring the "muted and transient
murmur" with which Stanford stu
dents and faculty and administration
greet an event like the development
of ASATs. Much of the research may
very likely take place at Stanford or
in Sunnyvale or San Jose, and will be
viewed, without a demur, as
"business as usual" by all of us. Years
ago, Emily Dickinson had some
refreshing things to say about con
formity and dissent:
Much madness is divinest sense
to a discerning eye;
Much sense the starkest madness.
'Tis the majority
In this, as all, prevails.
Assent, and you are sane;
Demur, — you're straightway
dangerous,
And handled with a chain.

Society needs
to rehabilitate
In the couple of days following the
defacement of "Gay Liberation," I
listened to a number of friends and
acquaintances express amazement
that such an outrageous act would
take place, especially here.
We should be furious, but we
shouldn't be amazed. What happened
to the sculpture lies somewhere near
the middle of a spectrum of frequent
violence against homosexuals that
ranges from fag/lesbo jokes (how
many of us heard someone "jokingly"
celebrate the defacement?) to assault,
battery and murder. The Tom Robin
son Band, in "Glad to be Gay,"
describes the latter end of this spec
trum as it shows itself in Britain,
another locale that prides itself on
"civility":
Don't try to kid us, but if you're
discreet
You're perfectly safe as you walk
down the street.
You don't have to mince or make
bitchy remarks,
To get beaten unconscious and left

in the dark.
