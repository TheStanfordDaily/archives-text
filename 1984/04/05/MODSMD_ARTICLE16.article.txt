## Houses broaden cultural horizons 
### 
The column "Theme houses need re-evaluation"
(Daily, March 9) disturbed me a great deal due to its mis
guided reliance on unfounded assumptions and its basic in
compatibility with statistical- fact. It is unfortunate it was
printed as such, yet 1 hope a number of these assumptions
can be cleared so that students may see ethnic theme
houses for what they are — institutions which are geared
to promote and preserve a diverse range of cultural iden
tities.
The main statistic which is utterly disregarded in the au
thor's argument is that fewer than 50 percent of the
residents of each theme house are members of that specific

VIEWPOINT

ethnic group. In other words, all ethnic theme houses have
a majority of non-ethnic residents. Is this "channeling stu
dents into safer, limited environments where the chal
lenges of group living are minimized?" Furthermore, I
would say that in a dormitory with 55 minorities out of ap
proximately 120 students on a campus with 1500
minorities out of 13,000 students, and in a country where
the descriptive term "minority" speaks itself for the ethnic
ratio, it is impossible for minority members to "isolate
themselves" within one ethnic community.
This leads to the next point: the importance of ethnic in
termingling and cultural education — issues I feel must be
discussed separately. Students of all cultures must equally
contribute and be involved in social intermingling at an in
dividual level in order to gain the cultural insight and
familiarity necesfcary to function well here and in, at least,
rbA .working world after Stanford. Cultural education,
however, is more at the group level and requires equal in
volvement of all students but not as much equal contribu
tion since there are probably few students here that have
not already been exposed to white American culture. This
culture is presented to most Americans in lifetime social
interactions, school textbooks and the media — especially
television. The main contributors to cultural education,
therefore, are ethnic groups, but both groups must, again,
be equally involved. I disagree with the statement that stu
dents outside of a specific ethnic group are the only
culture who are supposed to be educated and broadened"
by theme houses and ethnic diversity, in general.
How many ethnics have been exposed to the struggles,
the triumphs, the richness of their own cultures — in their
formal education or at home? Hardly as many as this arti
cle suggested! Everyone, members and non-members,
stands to benefit from the cultural programming theme
houses offer.
To extend this point, and tackle the most incorrect and
damaging assumption, I would like to approach the au
thor's statement that theme houses allow a student
"... to simply continue to limit himself to a culture with
which he is already very familiar and secure." I beg to dif
fer — in fact, to contradict. A majority of the minority stu
dents I have met here at Stanford come from
predominantly white neighborhoods. I would hardly clas
sify this as familiarity and security in ethnic identity; it is
more aptly depicted as curiousity, fear or lack of informa
tion. In response to this, I must ask: What about the many
minorities who have never been exposed to their own cul

ture? It cannot be taken for granted that all the minority
students here have recently emerged from monoethnic
neighborhoods and that only non-members of a group
stand to gain from cultural education. If that were the case,
minorities here would qualify more for federal grants as
research specimens than for scholarships as students.
Theme houses do, indeed, serve to broaden cultural
horizons for all students — and there is more than a
"minimal effort to reach out to potentially interested stu
dents." Several discussions on ethnic theme houses have
been held this year with residents, non-residents and Uni
versity administrators. Residences hold open houses
during the draw like all other dorms, and publicity can be
seen year-round for any number of events they sponsor.
Any "potentially interested student" who has not attended
some of the above may not be that interested.
It appears that a lot of blame is placed unfairly on ethnic
minorities for the bad image the article insists theme
houses uphold. It does not seem logical to place the pri
mary responsibility for student interest in cultural educa
tion on the institutions which provide it. It seems ludicrous
to me to suggest that any "hostile, negative attitude"
among students outside of a specific group can be solely
attributed to an "inner circle" of students within a theme
house. Think about it.
Most importantly, as a black student who has attended
and enjoyed activities at Ujamaa, Zapata, Okada and
Roble, I deeply resent the statement that these theme
houses will ultimately "... produce narrow leaders,
unable to form and lead the coalitions and diverse organi
zations wliich foster groWth and progress.' v I do hot see my
access to the benefits of theme houses as a limiting experi
ence.
Along with many of my friends, 1 first developed an
awareness of my own cultural identity through these resi
dential institutions during my freshman year. For a lot of
freshman, this is their first exposure to people and experi
ences of their own culture, and although they may not
choose to live in the residences, it is a personal comfort as
well as an educational benefit that these institutions exist.
Furthermore, what about those freshman who have
bteen exposed to their own culture but not to the many
other groups represented here at Stanford? Residential
education does serve to educate and challenge students,
but I do not feel it aims to make the transition to college a
potentially frightening or painful one. Since all of the Uni
versity dorms have a majority of white residents, is it fair
to allow a comfortable transition to the many students who
have come from similar neighborhoods while denying
access to a more familiar environment to those ac
customed to a higher ethnic concentration (bearing in
mind the less-than-50-percent-minority ratio even in
theme houses)? No, it is not.
It is not the number of ethnic residents that makes
Okada, Roble, Ujamaa and Zapata ethnic theme houses
(obviously). It is the institutions themselves that this
campus needs and should support, to educate Stanford
students in the many cultures to be found in America and
prepare them to understand and deal with this diversity
both here and in the post-graduate world.

dents outside of a specific ethnic group are the only
culture who are supposed to be educated and broadened"
by theme houses and ethnic diversity, in general.
How many ethnics have been exposed to the struggles,
the triumphs, the richness of their own cultures — in their
formal education or at home? Hardly as many as this arti
cle suggested! Everyone, members and non-members,
stands to benefit from the cultural programming theme
houses offer.
To extend this point, and tackle the most incorrect and
damaging assumption, I would like to approach the au
thor's statement that theme houses allow a student
"... to simply continue to limit himself to a culture with
which he is already very familiar and secure." I beg to dif
fer — in fact, to contradict. A majority of the minority stu
dents I have met here at Stanford come from
predominantly white neighborhoods. I would hardly clas
sify this as familiarity and security in ethnic identity; it is
more aptly depicted as curiousity, fear or lack of informa
tion. In response to this, I must ask: What about the many
minorities who have never been exposed to their own cul

ture? It cannot be taken for granted that all the minority
students here have recently emerged from monoethnic
neighborhoods and that only non-members of a group
stand to gain from cultural education. If that were the case,
minorities here would qualify more for federal grants as
research specimens than for scholarships as students.
Theme houses do, indeed, serve to broaden cultural
horizons for all students — and there is more than a
"minimal effort to reach out to potentially interested stu
dents." Several discussions on ethnic theme houses have
been held this year with residents, non-residents and Uni
versity administrators. Residences hold open houses
during the draw like all other dorms, and publicity can be
seen year-round for any number of events they sponsor.
Any "potentially interested student" who has not attended
some of the above may not be that interested.
It appears that a lot of blame is placed unfairly on ethnic
minorities for the bad image the article insists theme
houses uphold. It does not seem logical to place the pri
mary responsibility for student interest in cultural educa
tion on the institutions which provide it. It seems ludicrous
to me to suggest that any "hostile, negative attitude"
among students outside of a specific group can be solely
attributed to an "inner circle" of students within a theme
house. Think about it.
Most importantly, as a black student who has attended
and enjoyed activities at Ujamaa, Zapata, Okada and
Roble, I deeply resent the statement that these theme
houses will ultimately "... produce narrow leaders,
unable to form and lead the coalitions and diverse organi
zations wliich foster groWth and progress.' v I do hot see my
access to the benefits of theme houses as a limiting experi
ence.
Along with many of my friends, 1 first developed an
awareness of my own cultural identity through these resi
dential institutions during my freshman year. For a lot of
freshman, this is their first exposure to people and experi
ences of their own culture, and although they may not
choose to live in the residences, it is a personal comfort as
well as an educational benefit that these institutions exist.
Furthermore, what about those freshman who have
bteen exposed to their own culture but not to the many
other groups represented here at Stanford? Residential
education does serve to educate and challenge students,
but I do not feel it aims to make the transition to college a
potentially frightening or painful one. Since all of the Uni
versity dorms have a majority of white residents, is it fair
to allow a comfortable transition to the many students who
have come from similar neighborhoods while denying
access to a more familiar environment to those ac
customed to a higher ethnic concentration (bearing in
mind the less-than-50-percent-minority ratio even in
theme houses)? No, it is not.
It is not the number of ethnic residents that makes
Okada, Roble, Ujamaa and Zapata ethnic theme houses
(obviously). It is the institutions themselves that this
campus needs and should support, to educate Stanford
students in the many cultures to be found in America and
prepare them to understand and deal with this diversity
both here and in the post-graduate world.

The column "Theme houses need re-evaluation"
(Daily, March 9) disturbed me a great deal due to its mis
guided reliance on unfounded assumptions and its basic in
compatibility with statistical- fact. It is unfortunate it was
printed as such, yet 1 hope a number of these assumptions
can be cleared so that students may see ethnic theme
houses for what they are — institutions which are geared
to promote and preserve a diverse range of cultural iden
tities.
The main statistic which is utterly disregarded in the au
thor's argument is that fewer than 50 percent of the
residents of each theme house are members of that specific

VIEWPOINT

ethnic group. In other words, all ethnic theme houses have
a majority of non-ethnic residents. Is this "channeling stu
dents into safer, limited environments where the chal
lenges of group living are minimized?" Furthermore, I
would say that in a dormitory with 55 minorities out of ap
proximately 120 students on a campus with 1500
minorities out of 13,000 students, and in a country where
the descriptive term "minority" speaks itself for the ethnic
ratio, it is impossible for minority members to "isolate
themselves" within one ethnic community.
This leads to the next point: the importance of ethnic in
termingling and cultural education — issues I feel must be
discussed separately. Students of all cultures must equally
contribute and be involved in social intermingling at an in
dividual level in order to gain the cultural insight and
familiarity necesfcary to function well here and in, at least,
rbA .working world after Stanford. Cultural education,
however, is more at the group level and requires equal in
volvement of all students but not as much equal contribu
tion since there are probably few students here that have
not already been exposed to white American culture. This
culture is presented to most Americans in lifetime social
interactions, school textbooks and the media — especially
television. The main contributors to cultural education,
therefore, are ethnic groups, but both groups must, again,
be equally involved. I disagree with the statement that stu
dents outside of a specific ethnic group are the only
culture who are supposed to be educated and broadened"
by theme houses and ethnic diversity, in general.
