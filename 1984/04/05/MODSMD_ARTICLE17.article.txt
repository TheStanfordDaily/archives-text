## Philosophical verdict: Theme houses an asset 
### 
Time and time again 1 encounter a
group of people discussing the role of
ethnic theme houses on this campus.
Some portray life in an ethnic theme
house as one filled with anxiety and
too much controversy. But now I've

VIEWPOINT

come across a philosophical approach
regarding the failure of theme houses.
What do we, as current and former
members of ethnic theme houses, view
with greater significance: a
philosophical evaluation or a more
realistic evaluation of the goals of an
ethnic theme house?
Diego Cordovez' column (Daily,
March 9) on ethnic theme houses
takes the philosophical approach. I
will thus present a more realistic ap
proach regarding life in an ethnic
theme house.
Having lived at both Casa Zapata
and Ujamaa, I fail to recognize any
isolation from the rest of the Stanford
community. On the contrary, my years
at both houses taught me to evaluate
critically the issues of racism and cul
tural identity in this predominately
white community. I have gained the
confidence to overcome the fear of ex
pressing my views on racism and cul
tural identity that so many individuals

prefer to bury.
Last year, for instance, 1 partici
pated in a lengthy discussion regarding
the incident when the mural in
Zapata's dining hall was defaced. It
was a truly rewarding experience to k
discuss the significance of the work of
art outside of Zapata. Is this what one ,
would describe as isolating oneself
from the rest of the community?
Cordovez, have you ever lived in a
theme house? If stf why didn't you
cite any specific instances where
theme houses failed? Do you really
believe that by living in a theme house
ethnic minorities will sacrifice that
"cronyism" that you claim is vital to
alliances? If anything, ethnic
minorities as well as the other mem
bers of the house will be in a better
position to deal with sensitive issues
that inevitably arise in alliances be
cause they will have experienced it.
Theme houses challenge a person's
views on certain issues. And it is these
challenges that enrich a person's col
lege experience because he must at
tempt, at an early stage in his life, to
resolve the problems that create the
sharp divisions of ethnic groups in this
society. Is this not fostering growth?
