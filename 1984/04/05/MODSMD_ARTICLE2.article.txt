With elections for the ASSU Senate
fast approaching, charges have arisen
against two candidates for the
graduate senator position, Jim
McGrath and Eric Berg.
Eric Diesel, a former graduate
senator from the School of
Humanities and Scicnces, has charged

both McGrath and Berg with unethi
cal conduct in seeking to control the
publication of .statements opposing fee
assessment groups in the official elec
tion handout guide.
In an interview yesterday, Diesel
accused McGrath of controling
"hundreds of thousands ot dollars in
fee assessments by immediately sign
ing up to write against all ot the
groups requesting fee assessments.
According to ASSU by-laws ap
proved prior to last spring's election.
"If there is more than one sponsor op
posing the (fee) request, only the tirst
to file a declaration of intent shall be
entitled to submit a statement.
McGrath denied signing up to sub
mit statements against all ot the
groups requesting fee assessments. He
estimated that he had signed up to
submit statements against twelve ot
the seventeen groups on the spring
ballot. This was confirmed by Phil

Halperin, ASSU elections commis
sioner.
Diesel has charged McGrath with
acting unethically, saying, "He never
intended to write against all the
groups. He just wanted the control."
According to Diesel, McGrath
prevented others from writing state
ments against those groups he favored
and stopped others, such as under
graduate senator David Porter, from
writing statements which he did not
feel were "negative enough."
Porter denied that McGrath had at
tempted to stop him, stating that he
"would never have submitted state
ments against any of the fee assess
ment groups." But Porter did feel that
McGrath had attempted to control the
statements.
"I do think he (McGrath) did that in
order to prevent others from issuing
statements, and we (the senate) never
expected that to happen when we ap
proved the by-laws," he said.
McGrath admitted that he never in
tended to write statements against all
of the groups for whitth he signed up,
but he denied controling the state
ments submitted.
"First of all, 1 didn't tile against the
groups that 1 liked, and second of all. I
sent a memo to the elections commis
sioner telling him I would transfer
sponsorship to anyone who would
write a statement," he said.
McGrath submitted statements
against the Stanford Modern Arts Or
ganization (SMARIOR) and the
Concert Network.
"My estimation was that no one
would really write the statements so I
signed up and then encouraged people

to write. I didn't think I was impuning
on anyone's rights," he said.
Diesel further charged McGrath
and Berg of arranging a "sweetheart
deal" with the elections commissioner
in which Berg submitted his statement
against the Band after the deadline.
McGrath also submitted corrections to
his statement against SMARTOR
after the deadline.
McGrath called the charge
"ridiculous" and said the corrections
were submitted because of objections
made by Diesel against parts of the
SMARTOR statement. Diesel is the
sponsor of the SMARTOR's fee
assessment request.
Diesel claims that Berg and
McGrath violated the campaign con
duct code.
"I think they should both be dis
qualified, Berg for unfair influence of
the elections commissioner and both
for seeking to control the statements
submitted," he said.
