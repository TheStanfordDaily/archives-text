## Collision in the Philippines: the time is now 
### DAVID LEMPERT 
There is an animal in the
Philippines called the caribou. It
is a beast of burden, massive
and slow. You can push it from
dawn to dusk in the hot sun
through rice paddies. You can
load it up with produce to bring
to market. You can deprive it of
water and beat it with sticks of
bamboo. The caribou will not
make a sound. But one day, a
day when you would hardly ex
pect it . . . the caribou will kill
you.
They say you can tell a devel
oping country by the size of the
caskets used to bury its infants
who die at birth or the children
who die at a young age from
malnutrition and disease. This is
how it has been in the
Philippines, though the caskets
may soon get bigger . . . very,
very soon.
The people of the Philippines
are preparing for a fight. On the
one side is a small coterie that
has held power for too long,
refusing to let go: a democrati
cally elected president who
promised a "New Society" to
end corruption and injustice and
poverty but who stayed beyond

his mandate in order to
strengthen his own national
army, to dismantle Hedging in
stitutions of democracy, to limit
treedoms and to rape an eco
nomy tor the benefit of his fam
ily and friends. On the other
side are those millions who feel
betrayed, whose dreams in a
New Society have been shat
tered.
Some say that the fight will
never come. Among those who

Political analysis

could oppose President Fer
dinand Marcos, for example, in
this tropical Asian country of
7000 disparate islands are the
tribal rice farmers in G-strings
in the terraced mountains of
Banaue, the Muslim fishermen
on the coast of Mindanao, near
Borneo, and the lowly balut
(boiled duck embryo) vendors
on Manila street corners, whose
gaunt bodies suggest that their
only real concern is their next
meal.
Marcos believes these people
support him and that the net
work of local officials he has
built through bribery and

threats will remain strong. Many
of those in the countryside see
the president's wife, Imelda, an
all but coronated queen, in
augurating public works proj
ects for their benefit on the
front pages of The Daily Ex
press, which they can hardly
read. The Express is the paper
that Imelda owns â€” one of the
many enterprises which has
somehow become part of her
personal fortune during the past

few years.
Some of these public works
are* funded by U.S. foreign aid,
some from Philippine taxes, and
some out of the pockets of local
oligarchs who promised small
cash bonuses to towns which
gave Marcos' party 100 percent
(or more) of the vote in the last
election.
One of the things The Ex
press doesn't say, though, is that
U.S. aid not only amounts to
about 10 percent of all local
government expenditures over
the past 10 years, but also that it
amounts to about 10 percent of
what one economist in the U.S.

Embassy estimates that Marcos
and his "cronies" have taken
out of the Philippine economy.
So large a sum can hardly be
kept a secret. Many university
students and clergymen have
already taken to the hills as part
of an insurgent movement, call
ing itself the New People's
Army, to fight against Marcos,
his army and a society so riddled
by corruption that they believe
it needs to be radically changed.
There are those in the cities
who support a more limited
tight to restore democracy: stu
dents, professionals, busines
smen and even government
bureaucrats who have seen what
has happened to their beliefs in
freedom and economic better
ment and who have decided that
the Filipinos have been quiet for
too long, and that the time to
challenge Marcos is now.
Manila businessmen who
drive Mercedes and live in spe
cial, enclosed neighborhoods,
patrolled by private security
forces, are standing up at neigh
borhood meetings to give each
other the courage to do what
