## Collision in the Philippines: the time is now 
### DAVID LEMPERT 
There is an animal in the
Philippines called the caribou. It
is a beast of burden, massive
and slow. You can push it from
dawn to dusk in the hot sun
through rice paddies. You can
load it up with produce to bring
to market. You can deprive it of
water and beat it with sticks of
bamboo. The caribou will not
make a sound. But one day, a
day when you would hardly ex
pect it . . . the caribou will kill
you.
They say you can tell a devel
oping country by the size of the
caskets used to bury its infants
who die at birth or the children
who die at a young age from
malnutrition and disease. This is
how it has been in the
Philippines, though the caskets
may soon get bigger . . . very,
very soon.
The people of the Philippines
are preparing for a fight. On the
one side is a small coterie that
has held power for too long,
refusing to let go: a democrati
cally elected president who
promised a "New Society" to
end corruption and injustice and
poverty but who stayed beyond

his mandate in order to
strengthen his own national
army, to dismantle Hedging in
stitutions of democracy, to limit
treedoms and to rape an eco
nomy tor the benefit of his fam
ily and friends. On the other
side are those millions who feel
betrayed, whose dreams in a
New Society have been shat
tered.
Some say that the fight will
never come. Among those who

Political analysis

could oppose President Fer
dinand Marcos, for example, in
this tropical Asian country of
7000 disparate islands are the
tribal rice farmers in G-strings
in the terraced mountains of
Banaue, the Muslim fishermen
on the coast of Mindanao, near
Borneo, and the lowly balut
(boiled duck embryo) vendors
on Manila street corners, whose
gaunt bodies suggest that their
only real concern is their next
meal.
Marcos believes these people
support him and that the net
work of local officials he has
built through bribery and

threats will remain strong. Many
of those in the countryside see
the president's wife, Imelda, an
all but coronated queen, in
augurating public works proj
ects for their benefit on the
front pages of The Daily Ex
press, which they can hardly
read. The Express is the paper
that Imelda owns — one of the
many enterprises which has
somehow become part of her
personal fortune during the past

few years.
Some of these public works
are* funded by U.S. foreign aid,
some from Philippine taxes, and
some out of the pockets of local
oligarchs who promised small
cash bonuses to towns which
gave Marcos' party 100 percent
(or more) of the vote in the last
election.
One of the things The Ex
press doesn't say, though, is that
U.S. aid not only amounts to
about 10 percent of all local
government expenditures over
the past 10 years, but also that it
amounts to about 10 percent of
what one economist in the U.S.

Embassy estimates that Marcos
and his "cronies" have taken
out of the Philippine economy.
So large a sum can hardly be
kept a secret. Many university
students and clergymen have
already taken to the hills as part
of an insurgent movement, call
ing itself the New People's
Army, to fight against Marcos,
his army and a society so riddled
by corruption that they believe
it needs to be radically changed.
There are those in the cities
who support a more limited
tight to restore democracy: stu
dents, professionals, busines
smen and even government
bureaucrats who have seen what
has happened to their beliefs in
freedom and economic better
ment and who have decided that
the Filipinos have been quiet for
too long, and that the time to
challenge Marcos is now.

they feel they must do, in an
economic system where even
they feel they have suffered.
There are many reasons why
the time is now.
The strongest call to action
was the brutal murder of
Marcos' political rival,
"Ninoy" Aquino, moments
after he arrived back in the
country on Aug. 21 to plead
with Marcos for national recon
ciliation and relaxation of
Marcos' tryannical rule.
Fingers, within the
Philippines and without, point
to three suspects: Marcos, his
wife Imelda and General Fabian
Ver, the leader of the Philippine
military, loyal to the Marcoses.
It was the death of Aquino
which prompted even more
money to leave the country than
the Marcos family had already
taken out, adding to an eco
nomic collapse and a need to
devalue the currency and
restore the country's interna
tional debt.
The country's poverty, which
can only worsen between now
and the May election for assem

bly, touches the senses as one
walks down any street. Little
boys who should be in school
run through traffic selling
cigarettes and newspapers. Ur
chins in rags tug at your shirt
sleeves as you pass by, crying,
"Sirrrrrrr . . . give me one piso.
I'm hungry." You know they
are and that many sleep along
the sidewalks at night.
Taxi drivers tell of people
they know who are literally
tightening their belts because
they are down to two meals a
day since the price of rice has
risen from 10 to 11 cents per
pound. It can be seen, sadly,
what poverty does to old women
and pretty Asian girls.
It isn't that Marcos is all to
blame. Corruption, oppression
and poverty in the Philippines
date at least as far back as the
arrival of the Spanish and the
Catholic church over 300 years
ago, an arrival which saw the
forcing of foreign ways on a
traditional, Asian society.
Others claim that Philippine
politics before Marcos was just
an exercise in transferring spoils
from one group of elitists to an
other.
Still, before Marcos, it looked
like the country was on its way
towards democracy and moder

nization, based on a U.S. model.
Many saw the country as the
most successful implant of
democracy in a developing
Asian nation.
Former President Diosdado
Macapagal, who relinquished
his position in 1965 when he
lost the presidential election to
Marcos, becomes teary eyed
when he talks about the effect

hungry."

that Marcos has had on the
country's democratic institu
tions. He shakes his head when
he recalls how Marcos bribed
assemblymen to rewrite the na
tion's constitution in order to
legitimize his dictatorial powers.
It is Macapagal who is now busy
rewriting the constitution in or
der to try to put Philippine
democracy back together again
after Marcos.
But Marcos didn't stop at
rewriting the constitution. He
made his wife the governor of

Manila, and then head of a new
ministry which in the last three
years has quickly begun to can
nibalize most of the other arms
of government. He put his
picture on the stamps and made
his 25-year-old son a governor
and one of his daughters the
head of a new youth federation.
Pictures of the president, and
of his wife, seated as if on a

throne, appear in every govern
ment office in the country and
on calendars everywhere. Ironi
cally, and symbolically, though,
the government seems to have
run out of money to print these
calendars for 1984.
Marcos has enlisted Stan
ford's help in an indirect way,
too. Two of his most prominent
and Icyal appointees — the
director of the Central Bank
and the deputy minister of Im
elda Marcos' ministry — are
Stanford graduates.

While most Filipinos have sat
back quietly during Marcos'
rule, so has the U.S. govern
ment, somehow deciding that
the Philippines was one place
where they would claim that the
proper role of the United States
was non-intervention.
While the Carter administra
tion openly questioned the
policy of selling arms to a gov
ernment that had doubled the
size of its military with no exter
nal threat and had been charged
with violating human rights, the
policy of the Reagan adminis
tration has been much more
subtle — so subtle that most
Filipinos don't know what it is.
It has only been in the past
few weeks that Ambassador Mi
chael Armacost has finally been
spreading some hints that he is a
bit dissatisfied with the current
policies of the Marcos regime.
"Marcos is no different from
other Philippine politicians,"
says one political officer in the
U.S. Embassy, almost apologeti
cally. "Anyone would have
done what he did if they could
have. It's just that Marcos was
smarter. We get all of these let
ters from the States accusing
Marcos of being a bloodthirsty
dictator, but he's an Asian dic
tator. He was elected. He Un

derstands his people. He keeps
violence to a minimum. No one
can replace him. He is the glue
that holds this society together."
"Aquino would have been
just like Marcos," says another.
Rationalizations become
stronger as time goes by, and
some even hint that the United
States has become even more
powerless all the while, allowing
Marcos and his cronies to invest
so heavily in American busi
nesses and in the Philippine eco
nomy that they can blackmail
the U.S. government with eco
nomic retribution.
Still, the marches on Manila
continue. There were tens of
thousands of demonstrators ear
lier last month. Opposition
politicians talk behind closed
doors about sabotaging power
and water systems in Manila to
create chaos. Marcos and his
friends plan their political
maneuvers and their paths to
safety in the United States so
that if need be they can follow
the oligarch refugees of
Nicaragua, Cuba and other na
tions before them.
Why did we wait so long?
