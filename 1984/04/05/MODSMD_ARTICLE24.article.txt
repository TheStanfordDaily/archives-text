## Trojans trample spikers 
### TRASK LEONARD 
After the first game of the
Cardinal's volleyball game with
USC last night, things were
looking bright. Stanford's
fortune, however, quickly
changed, as the Trojans took
command and handed Stanford
a disappointing loss, 3-1.
The loss gives Stanford a
record of 12-12 overall, 5-9 in
the California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association (CIVA).
USC lifted its season mark to
29-8 and 10-4 in conference
games.

Head Coach Fred Sturm's
spikers took the lead early with
a 15-10 victory the first game,
but stumbled their way in, losing
the next three games by scores
of 15-6, 15-4, and 15-9.
"We were playing pretty well
the first game," said Assistant
Coach Don Shaw. ' But SC
came out tough the second
game, and we just played into
their hands. We lost the inten
sity we had the first game, and
from then on, we just couldn't
do anything."
Brett Monello, an outside hit

ter who led the Cardinal in kills
with 14, agreed with Shaw.
"You just can't play tough
against a team like SC the first
part of the match and then just
falter. When they played just
awesome the second game, we
lost the mental edge. And when
that happens, we've already lost
the match."
The Trojans, who are ranked
second in the nation, displayed
hard-hitting form and an excel
lent front line in their victory.
The combined attack of outside
hitters Bill Yardley and Adam

Johnson contributed for 37 of
the team's 76 kills. Still, the
Cardinal felt as if it should have
played closer to its opponents.
"We have a lot of talent, but
we don't seem to utilize it to the
fullest," Shaw said. "We are a
very young team that could go a
long way in the future, and to
simply hand SC a victory really
hurts. We have to gain some
confidence and intensity if we
are going to do anything."
A crowd of about 250 turned
out for the match at Maples,
cheering loudly the first game as
the Cardinal outplayed the
surprised Trojans. But the yel
ling died down the last three
games, which USC captured
swiftly and painlessly, save for a
last ditch effort by the Cardinal
which proved in vain.
Freshman Karl Kolderup
started off the match in great
style for the home team, as he
served to a 3-0 lead. The game
then seesawed back and forth
until Stanford took command at
10-7 due to superb blocks by
Craig Lauchner and Jon Root,
and finished the Trojans off 15-
10.
The second game was a dif
ferent story, however. USC
jumped out to an overwhelming
13-1 lead, at which point the
Cardinal attempted a rally, but
fell short, 15-6.
This was perhaps the turning
point, as another effort to catch
USC did not materialize until
the latter part of the final game.
The rest of the way, the Trojans
enjoyed hard-nosed play by
middle blocker Adam
Horstman, who made his pres
ence known in the third game
with gutsy blocks. The 6-foot-4
blocker got in the way of several
of Stanford's attempted kills.
The Cardinal will attempt to
salvage a long and difficult
season Friday night against
Long Beach State, which is
ranked No. 4 in the nation. That
match begins at 7:30 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal
then plays Cal State Northridge
and San Diego State on its way
to take on the University of
Hawaii in Honolulu to finish off
the season.
