# Scoring mark could fall tonight
## Jabbar looks to hook 21 
### 
Las Vegas, Nev. (AP) —
Los Angeles Lakers' center
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar needs
21 points tonight against the
Utah Jazz to break Wilt
Chamberlain's all-time Na
tional Basketball Association
scoring record — a mark that
once was considered unsur
passable.
The nation's gambling
capital is rolling out the red
carpet for the game, which is
expected to draw a capacity
crowd of more than 18,000
fans, with 14,000 tickets
already sold by yesterday.
Those expected to attend
include Chamberlain, NBA
Commissioner David Stern,
Nevada Gov. Richard Bryan,
and Abdul-Jabbar's parents
Ferdinand and Cora Alcin
dor.
In his 15th season in the
NBA, Abdul-Jabbar has
31,399 regular-season points
after scoring 27 against the
San Antonio Spurs Tuesday
night. Chamberlain, who
played 14 seasons, scored
31,419 points. However,
Abdul-Jabbar already is the
leader in total points —
regular-season and playoffs
— with 35,031, five more
than Chamberlain.
"It's a great personal
achievement, something I'll
treasure all my life," the 36-
year-old player said in an
ticipation of breaking Cham
berlain's record.
"To be No. 1 in anything
in American sport is some
thing to be proud of. I'm very
thankful and I hope every
one thinks I deserve it."
Chamberlain is one who
agrees that Abdul-Jabbar
deserves it.
"If anyone is deserving to
break that record, it's
definitely, definitely him,"
said Chamberlain. "I'm
proud that he will have it."
The 7-foot-2 Abdul-

Jabbar has averaged 20.3
points per game against the
Jazz this season, but scored
29 in their last meeting at
Los Angeles. He has scored
20 or more points in the
Lakers' last 17 games.
Scoring, however, has not
been Abdul-Jabbar's only
strong point.
He has been named the
NBA's most valuable player
six times, played in 14 All-

Star Games and was named
the league's Rookie of the
Year when he broke in with
the Milwaukee Bucks in the
1969-70 season.
More than 2000 fans were
expected to make the trip
from Los Angeles for
tonight's game, officials said.
Las Vegas has served as
the Jazz' home-away-from
home for 11 games this
season.
