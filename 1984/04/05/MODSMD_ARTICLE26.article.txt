# Women improve mark to 14-0
## Netters pound Cal again 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
When you're ranked No. 1 in
the country like the Stanford
women's tennis team, you ex
pect to win matches.
Sometimes, though, you not
only win, you take no prisoners
in the process. So it was with the
Cardinal's 8-1 win over cross
hay rival UC-Berkeley yester
day at Cal.
The netters swept all six
singles matches in straight sets
to clinch the victory. Not only
did they sweep the Bears, they
dispatched some top players in
very impressive fashion.
"I couldn't believe our
scores," Stanford Head Coach
Frank Brennan said. "I thought
it was one of our best matches of
the year."
The Card beat Cal, 9-0, last
month at home, but most of the
matches were fairly close. Not
this time. Junior Linda Gates
began the rout as she defeated
Linda Oechsle, 6-0, 6-2, at No.
1. Oechsle was ranked No. 25 in
the nation prior to the start of
the season.
Freshman Patty Fendick also
disposed of a top player, putting
away No. 19-ranked Heather
Ettus, 6-2, 6-1. Brennan said.
"Both Linda and Patty played
good players, and they both
demolished them."

Sophon:ore Kate Gompert
had a slightly easier match at
No. 3, and she responded by
disposing of Mary Margaret
Torres. 6-4. 6-1. "Kate did a
good job," Brennan said. "Her
girl wasn't that tough, but she
played a good match."
Freshman Leigh Anne
Eldredge came into the match
suffering from the flu. but she
decided to play and recorded a
6-4, 6-2 victory over Stacy
Savides. at No. 4. Brennan said.
"It was a tough performance on
Leigh Anne's part. A lot of
players wouldn't have gone out
there, but she did and played a
good match. She had some close
calls early, but she put it to
gether."
At No. 5, senior Michelle
Weiss defeated Julie Grummel,
6-3, 6-3, while at No. 6, fresh
man Stephanie Savides com
pleted the sweep with a 7-6, 6-2
victory over Vicki Corrales.
The doubles matches were
closer, but by that time the
match had already been
decided. At No. 1, Weiss and
Gompert dropped their first set
to Grummel and Caroline Yao,
7-6, but came back strong to
take the next two, 6-2, 6-0, and
the match.
The Card's only loss of the
day came at No. 2 doubles.
Eldredge left the match follow

ing the singles, and junior Bar
bara Baughman took her place
with Fendick. The pair dropped
a 7-5. 4-6. 6-2 decision to
Oechsle and Corrales.
At No. 3. Savides and Gates
defeated Torres and Ettus, 7-6,
4-6, 6-2.
With the win the Cardinal
confirmed its top ranking,
raising its record to 14-0. The
Card's next match is Saturday at
USC. The netters return home
April 13 to face Arizona.
Card Notes
In the latest poll released by
the Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association, Fendick
was ranked No. 3 nationally,
with Gates just behind her at
No. 4. Two other Stanford
players were in the top 50 â€”
Gompert was rated No. 17,
while Eldredge is at No. 44.
The Stanford players are at a
disadvantage in a poll such as
this because other teams have
played more matches and in
more tournaments, and the
rankings do not take this into
account. Brennan said he ex
pects Gompert and Eldredge to
move up in the rankings by the
end of the season.
Senior Elise Burgin. ranked
No. 2 in the pre-season poll, has
not returned to action yet this
year.
