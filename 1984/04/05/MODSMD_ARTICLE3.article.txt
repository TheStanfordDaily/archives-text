The highly anticipated Microdisc program .is off to a
respectable start with Apple Macintosh orders
dominating the first few days of sales, according to
Microdisc administrators.
"Sales have been steady, but definitely not mobbed,"
said Jan Thomson, director of administrative services

for Information Technology Services (ITS). "We sold
around 40 the first day, and about the same the second
day, but at a quicker pace and in a reduced amount of
time." '
The majority of the orders placed so far were made
by students. Most were for the Macintosh, though a few
were for Hewlett-Packard computers, Thomson said.

"In seminars held by IRIS (Instruction Research In
formation systems) and DIS (Departmental Informa
tion Systems), we really stressed the fact that there was
no huge urgency to purchase the computers right away.
Rather, we emphasized the importance of taking the
time to get enough information and consulting, and to
make sure that people had all of their questions satis
factorily answered," Thomson said.
"Our expectation has been that the number of per
sonal requests we receive will probably exceed the
number of computers we have available, but that
remains to be seen," she said.
"You must pay in full at the time of placing an order,
but if after having made your order for some reason
you change your mind about wanting the computer, or
can't wait until its delivery date, it is possible up until
May 1 to cancel one's order and receive a full refund
with no deductions whatsoever," Thomson noted.
If the number of orders does not exceed 400 before
the lottery date, everyone who has placed an order will
most likely receive his computer sometime this month,
Thomson said.
