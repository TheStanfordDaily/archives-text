# 'Sister Joseph' sometimes funny, rarely meaningful
## 
### MARC FAJER 
"The Sister Joseph Memorial
Gymnasium," a new play by
Lucy Lewis, opened just before
break at the Magic Theatre at
Fort Mason in San Francisco. It
is a mildly amusing comedy
about life in a Catholic girls'
high school that attempts to deal
with sexuality, lesbianism and
power trips and succeeds only in
showing that the rarified atmo
sphere can create some very sick
people.
There are three quite good
performances which capture the
essence of female adolescence
and are humorous, if not the
stuff of which great drama is
made. Monika Gurney is right
on target as Khaki, a misfit:
homely, overweight and unsure
of herself. She captures just the
right amount of whininess and
self-pity to recreate the un
popular girl that you knew in
high school. Maud Winchester
plays her rich, popular
roommate, Coo. She is also very
good as someone you probably
knew in high school: vivacious,
liked by students and teachers
and curious about sex. The two
girls end up kissing a couple of
times and spend much of the
second act discussing whether
they are lesbians and what it all
means. The performances rise
above the script, which is full of
pop psychology and often reeks
of "The Children's Hour" in its
guilt-ridden melodramatics.
Maureen McVerry plays
Murph, a very strange girl who
says nothing at all, and tries to
convince the nuns that she is a
saint by squeezing her crucifix
too hard and causing her hands
to bleed. She has an air of in
sanity about her that is fascinat
ing to watch. One of the
funniest scenes in the play is
when Khaki and Coo dress
Murph up to go to a dance in a

discp outfit and makeup. This
is one of the few scenes in which
the playwright manages to
create interesting and real
dialogue.
The adults in the play do not
fare quite as well. Sandra Can
non is totally unbelievable as
the domineering Sister Joseph,
the head of the school. This is
not entirely her fault, as the play
does not explain her extreme
mood swings, her craving for
total control or her odd, nearly
sexual touching exchange with
another nun. She is given one
speech about lapses in faith
toward the end of the play,
which presumably is to give her
some humanity, but it winds up
being just another loose end.

The saving grace of the whole
play is a production of
"Hamlet" being put on by the
school under the ruthless direc
tion of Sister Joseph. She
rewrites the play to give it a
happy ending. Both the rehear
sals and the end-product are
very funny. Monika Gurney is
inspired as she stomps around
the stage with her moustache
falling off. terrified of the sword
she has to use as Hamlet. These
scenes almost save the rest of
the play.
Overall, however, the big
problem is that the author has
no idea what she is getting at or
how to say it. When she sticks to
adolescent chit-chat the
dialogue is funny and

believable; when it becomes
"meaningful," it falters. The
central point of the play,
whatever it is supposed to be, is
lost, and Simon Levy's often
stagy direction of the
"significant" parts doesn't help
The overriding impression is
that the school will warp anyone
in it if they stay long enough,
and I'm not at all sure that was
the original intent.
"The Sister Joseph Memorial
Gymnasium" plays at the Magic
through April 29. Although
there are a few bright spots
(including John Rathman's set),
there is not much here, except
perhaps nostalgia if you hap
pened to attend a Catholic
school with similar problems.
