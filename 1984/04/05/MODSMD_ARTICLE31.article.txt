# ACT's 'Angels Fall' best taken at face value
## 
### MARC FAJER 
Since 1 began reviewing, I
have developed the habit of not
reading program notes before
seeing a production or writing it
up. This way, in theory. 1 am
free to judge what I see rather
than what people thought they
were trying to do. Unfortun
ately, 1 broke my own rule and
read the interview with the
playwright in the program for
A.C.T.'s production of Lanford
Wilson's "Angel's Fall." This
faux pas will have no earth
shattering consequences, of
course, but it has confused my
thinking about the play and is
complicating considerably what
ought to be a straightforward
discussion of an enjoyable, well
acted production.
To start with the positive: Go
see the play. It is a tightly di
rected, funny show that boasts
some very good acting (with a
few warts), nice scenery (by
Ralph Funicello) and lighting
(by Greg Sullivan) and clever,
realistic dialogue by Wilson.
The action takes place in a
small mission in New Mexico —
one of several nearly abandoned
locations at which Father
William Doherty (Sydney
Walker) attends to the Indians
in his parish. The six characters
are caught in the mission be
cause a nuclear accident at a
nearby uranium mine has tem
porarily closed the roads. An art
history professor (Dakin Mat
thews) and his wife (Barbara

Dirickson) are on their way to a
mental hospital where he is to
recover from a nervous break
down. A young tennis pro (John
DeMita) is on his way to a
tournament with his lover
(DeAnn Mears), an older wo
man who has returned to New
Mexico to close up her dead art
ist/husband's estate. The final
character is a young Indian doc
tor (Peter Bretz) who is leaving
his reservation to work for a
cancer research institution at
Berkeley, much to the dismay of
the priest, who wants him to
stay with his people.
Matthews is superb as the
professor. His breakdown was a
result of a loss of faith in his own
work — he looks back at all he
has written and finds it
meaningless. When attacked by
the young doctor for being out
of touch with the real world, he
gives a marvelous rendition of
reality as sefcn from academia:
Drugs, suicide, depression and
meaninglessness are all readily
apparent from the ivory tower.
The speech is a high point of the
show because Matthews
manages to convey the frustra
tion and vulnerability ot his
character throughout the tirade.
Walker, in the key role as
priest, rises to the same level.
He has developed a marvelous
set of little quirks that adds to
the faith that underlies all that
the old man does to create a las
cinating character. Especially
when we don't like what the

priest is doing, as when he
manipulates the emotions ot the
young Indian to try to convince
him to stay, we have to respect
the performance.
DeMita is verv appealing as
the tennis pro and has a lew
funny bits relating to his hypo
chondria. Mears gives a fine
performance as the widow,
touching both in her feelings tor
her late husband and her con
cern for her young lover.
Dirickson is fine in the basically
uninteresting role ol the wife.
The major acting problem in
the cast is Bret/ as the young
doctor. His toughness seems
blustery and artificial, and
several key exchanges toward
the end of the play do not come
off quite right because he seems
unsure of what he is supposed to
be doing. One senses that some
of these were supposed to be
deeply moving, but they lack
emotional punch.
Overall, the play itself (prior
to revelations from the inter
view) seemed to have a few
problems but was funny and in
teresting. There is a little too
much forced exposition early
on, and a few rather forced con
frontations, but on the whole,
especially with Edward Has
tings' tight direction, it hung to
gether quite well. The play
seemed to examine the ways
people found their calling in life,
and the fact that even if you
know "who you are" it doesn't

help you to make tough deci
sions. There was a long discus
sion of how the tennis pro knew
tennis was his game, how the
priest got his calling, etc. The
play is interesting because much
of modern literature deals with
people trying to find out who
they are: "Angels Fall" starts
with people who seem to know
who they are and examines what

they do about it.
And then 1 read the inter
view. "Angels Fall" is a meta
phor tor American society. Of
course. We are all trapped by
the continual threat of nuclear
disaster and so are making deci
sions based on personal gain
rather than humanitarian in
stincts. And the artist is dead
and we are sad. Oh

I have a numb**' ol question*
about this interpretation ol the
play. Why, it we are supposed to
feel that the Indian doctor is sel
fish in leaving his reservation
(where, we are told repeatedly,
the medical problems are hope
less) does he go on to do cancer
research? Why is giving up
teaching when you don't believe
in the things you are saving anti

humanitarian? And what does
the poor hypochondriac tennis
pro symbolize?
Anyway, these pressing ques
tions aside, "Angels Fall" is an
entertaining evening of theater
and well worth seeing. It plays
in repertory at the Geary
Theatre in San Francisco
through April 21. And don't
read the program notes.

unsure of what he is supposed to
be doing. One senses that some
of these were supposed to be
deeply moving, but they lack
emotional punch.
Overall, the play itself (prior
to revelations from the inter
view) seemed to have a few
problems but was funny and in
teresting. There is a little too
much forced exposition early
on, and a few rather forced con
frontations, but on the whole,
especially with Edward Has
tings' tight direction, it hung to
gether quite well. The play
seemed to examine the ways
people found their calling in life,
and the fact that even if you
know "who you are" it doesn't

help you to make tough deci
sions. There was a long discus
sion of how the tennis pro knew
tennis was his game, how the
priest got his calling, etc. The
play is interesting because much
of modern literature deals with
people trying to find out who
they are: "Angels Fall" starts
with people who seem to know
who they are and examines what

they do about it.
And then 1 read the inter
view. "Angels Fall" is a meta
phor tor American society. Of
course. We are all trapped by
the continual threat of nuclear
disaster and so are making deci
sions based on personal gain
rather than humanitarian in
stincts. And the artist is dead
and we are sad. Oh

I have a numb**' ol question*
about this interpretation ol the
play. Why, it we are supposed to
feel that the Indian doctor is sel
fish in leaving his reservation
(where, we are told repeatedly,
the medical problems are hope
less) does he go on to do cancer
research? Why is giving up
teaching when you don't believe
in the things you are saving anti

humanitarian? And what does
the poor hypochondriac tennis
pro symbolize?
Anyway, these pressing ques
tions aside, "Angels Fall" is an
entertaining evening of theater
and well worth seeing. It plays
in repertory at the Geary
Theatre in San Francisco
through April 21. And don't
read the program notes.


Sydney Walker and Peter Bretz
Since 1 began reviewing, I
have developed the habit of not
reading program notes before
seeing a production or writing it
up. This way, in theory. 1 am
free to judge what I see rather
than what people thought they
were trying to do. Unfortun
ately, 1 broke my own rule and
read the interview with the
playwright in the program for
A.C.T.'s production of Lanford
Wilson's "Angel's Fall." This
faux pas will have no earth
shattering consequences, of
course, but it has confused my
thinking about the play and is
complicating considerably what
ought to be a straightforward
discussion of an enjoyable, well
acted production.
To start with the positive: Go
see the play. It is a tightly di
rected, funny show that boasts
some very good acting (with a
few warts), nice scenery (by
Ralph Funicello) and lighting
(by Greg Sullivan) and clever,
realistic dialogue by Wilson.
The action takes place in a
small mission in New Mexico —
one of several nearly abandoned
locations at which Father
William Doherty (Sydney
Walker) attends to the Indians
in his parish. The six characters
are caught in the mission be
cause a nuclear accident at a
nearby uranium mine has tem
porarily closed the roads. An art
history professor (Dakin Mat
thews) and his wife (Barbara

Dirickson) are on their way to a
mental hospital where he is to
recover from a nervous break
down. A young tennis pro (John
DeMita) is on his way to a
tournament with his lover
(DeAnn Mears), an older wo
man who has returned to New
Mexico to close up her dead art
ist/husband's estate. The final
character is a young Indian doc
tor (Peter Bretz) who is leaving
his reservation to work for a
cancer research institution at
Berkeley, much to the dismay of
the priest, who wants him to
stay with his people.
Matthews is superb as the
professor. His breakdown was a
result of a loss of faith in his own
work — he looks back at all he
has written and finds it
meaningless. When attacked by
the young doctor for being out
of touch with the real world, he
gives a marvelous rendition of
reality as sefcn from academia:
Drugs, suicide, depression and
meaninglessness are all readily
apparent from the ivory tower.
The speech is a high point of the
show because Matthews
manages to convey the frustra
tion and vulnerability ot his
character throughout the tirade.
Walker, in the key role as
priest, rises to the same level.
He has developed a marvelous
set of little quirks that adds to
the faith that underlies all that
the old man does to create a las
cinating character. Especially
when we don't like what the

priest is doing, as when he
manipulates the emotions ot the
young Indian to try to convince
him to stay, we have to respect
the performance.
DeMita is verv appealing as
the tennis pro and has a lew
funny bits relating to his hypo
chondria. Mears gives a fine
performance as the widow,
touching both in her feelings tor
her late husband and her con
cern for her young lover.
Dirickson is fine in the basically
uninteresting role ol the wife.
The major acting problem in
the cast is Bret/ as the young
doctor. His toughness seems
blustery and artificial, and
several key exchanges toward
the end of the play do not come
off quite right because he seems
unsure of what he is supposed to
be doing. One senses that some
of these were supposed to be
deeply moving, but they lack
emotional punch.
Overall, the play itself (prior
to revelations from the inter
view) seemed to have a few
problems but was funny and in
teresting. There is a little too
much forced exposition early

frontations, but on the whole,
