# Victim harassed prior to assault

### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
One of two men allegedly assaulted
by Stanford graduate Kevin King near
Tresidder Union Tuesday told The
Daily yesterday that King had har
assed him before and accused him of
conspiring with former Oakland
Raiders Coach John Madden to "get"
King.
King, 37, was arrested yesterday at
the Bookstore after he allegedly beat
Charles Nines, 37, and Jose Oropeza,
82, with a tennis racquet near Tresid
der and then threatened two police of
ficers with a knife.
King was still in custody at the
North County Jail last night on two
counts of misdemeanor assault, one
felony count of carrying a concealed
weapon and another felony charge of
using a deadly weapon with the intent
to resist arrest. Bail has been set at
$4000.
Deputy District Attorney Bob
Harpainter said King will now un
dergo a preliminary hearing, where
evidence may be presented to show
that a crime was committed and that
King is guilty. No date has been set for
that hearing.
Nines, a Palo Alto man who said he
went to junior high school with King
at Menlo Boys School and met him
again when they both were under
graduates here, said King began har
assing him approximately two months
ago in front of Tresidder.
"I was making a phone call about
part-time employment and he took
the telephone out of my hand and
hung it up," Nines said. "He asked
me, 'Are you working for John Mad
den?' 1 said 'I'm going to call the
police.' He blocked my way so 1
walked away."
Nines said he wrote a "long letter to
the police asking them to counsel
Kevin" shortly after that incident, but
a for the Stun ford F*o]iw

said he had no record of that corres
pondence.
Nines said he then saw King on
campus again on Sunday and Monday
this week.
"I'd seen him at Stanford the day of
the assault and the day before that,"
Nines said. "He said, 'I'll see you to
morrow.' I said, 'Tomorrow?' and
then he said, 'You'd better get your
fucking ass off this campus.'
"Instead of getting aggravated, I
saw his books and asked him what he
was studying, and he said, 'I don't
know you, I don't know you,' " Nines
said.
Nines said he saw King again on the
morning of the alleged attack when
Nines stopped at Tresidder for break
fast before going to work at his part
time gardening job on campus.
" I sat down at one of the booths and
noticed Kevin sitting at another booth.
I sat there, and just figured I was going
to ignore him. But then he got up out
of his booth and moved to a booth be
hind mine.
"I left to walk up to work, and 1
walked out to the Store area, where
the newspapers are. I realized that I
hadn't mailed three postcards I
wanted to mail that day so I went back
through Tresidder and I realized
Kevin was following me like he had
done before.
"I ignored it, but he started striking
me with his tennis racquet. I blocked
five, six or seven smashes with my
backpack. At about that time 1 yelled,
'Call the police.' "
A witness said the man attacking
Nines then began to chase a man who
said he would call the police, yelling,
"Oh, no you don't."
The witness said that he saw Nines
do nothing to provoke an attack, and
said that he had not seen the alleged
assault on 82-year-old Oropeza, a cus
todian at Tresidder. Oropeza was un
available for comment yesterday.
King has been incarcerated twice
before as a result of his infatuation
with Caroline Kennedy, the daughter
of the late President John F. Kennedy.
King was convicted three years ago
of harassing Kennedy in New York
with obscene marriage proposals, and
was kept under evaluation at the Val
ley Medical Center for 14 days this
June after making "veiled threats"
against University President Donald
Kennedy.
"What it comes down to is that he
has a chip on his shoulder," Nines
said. "Maybe it's that he didn't pass
his Bar exam. In my generation we've
got doctors and lawyers; it was a really
outstanding class and you really live
with vour peer eroun.
"But I don't understand when he
asks, 'Are you working for John Mad
den?' " Nines said. "1 don't know
what could have changed his character
that drastically."
