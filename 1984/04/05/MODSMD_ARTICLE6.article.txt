"Fall of 1985 has the potential for
tremendous changes in Residential
Education's method of presenting
theme houses during freshman orien
tation." Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson told 20 residents of
Ujamaa House last night in an infor
mal discussion on the changing roles
of Ujamaa and other theme houses.
These possible changes would affect
only incoming freshmen. Robinson
said.
"When freshmen receive their
housing selection cards, they will have
one of three choices: I would prefer to

live in a theme house. I would prefer
to live in a non-theme house, or I
would enjoy either choice. Each op
tion is expressed as a positive choice."
In addition. Res Ed will be sending
the incoming freshmen a brochure
describing all the housing opportuni
ties and the importance of deciding
the type of residence in which
they want to live, be it all-freshman or
four-class, theme or non-theme. Rob
inson said.
Theme houses serve a cultural and
social role in the Stanford community,
but more importantly. "They focus
more attention within the University
on ethnicity and raise everyone's con

sciousness," he said.
Yet despite this potential, Ujamaa
residents said they feel there is a gen
eral lack of appreciation for ethnicity
and lack of support from faculty mem
bers.
Robinson agreed with this evalua
tion.
"Look at the curriculum — there's
Western Culture and that's all," Rob
inson said. "Look at the faculty —
they are predominately white and be
coming more so. It's contradictory to
see one part of the University support
theme houses, while another part is
not implementing the theory within
the University itself.

"Students who live in theme houses
have a more enriching experience, al
though not always comfortable be
cause of the issues that arise. Students
are exposed to ideas that they would
never have thought about. It's a very
valuable experience. People have to
be made to understand that being at
Stanford is a time to broaden one's
horizons."
Residents also expressed concern
over Ujamaa's popularity among the
black community, but its inability to
attract students representing other
cultures on campus. They attribute
this problem to an overall negative at
titude toward theme houses.
