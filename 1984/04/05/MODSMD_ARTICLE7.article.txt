U.S. Consulate accused of
favoring Arabs over Israelis
Jerusalem — The American Jewish Congress, meeting in
Israel, yesterday accused the diplomatically independent U.S.
Consulate in Jerusalem of developing political ties with pro-
Palestine Liberation Organization Arabs in the West Bank at
the expense of relations with Israel.
The organization's statement, issued after its members had
been briefed by Israeli government leaders, echoed frequent
Israeli criticism, which U.S. officials in Israel believe could
incite ultranationalist Israelis to violence against U.S.
diplomats.
The controversy over the consulate comes as a counter
point to the debate in the United States over proposals to
move the .U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The
same pro-Israel groups that want to move the embassy to
Jerusalem object to the independent status of the consulate.
Most U.S. consulates around the world are legally subor
dinate to the embassy in the country in which they are lo
cated, but the consulates in Jerusalem and Hong Kong report
directly to Washington.
"The idea that the U.S. government should not consider
Jerusalem part of Israel. . . .we find intolerable," Theodore
Mann of Philadelphia, newly elected president of the Ameri
can Jewish Congress, said. "If it (the consulate) were operat
ing under the aegis of the U.S. Embassy — regardless of
where it (the embassy) was located — we could have no ob
jection."
Chernenko reaffirms desire for
better relations with U.S.
Moscow — Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko said yes
terday that the continued deployment of U.S. missiles in
Western Europe conflicts with the Reagan administration's
stated interest in a peaceful dialogue with the Soviet Union,
but he reaffirmed Moscow's desire for better relations with
the United States.
Chernenko's statement, in the form of a reply to a letter
from the former West German leader Willy Brandt, followed
by one day reports that the first U.S. cruise missile in Italy is
now operational.
"The U.S. administration, although lately it has been
professing its desire for a dialogue with the U.S.S.R., is not
backing it up with anything specific," Chernenko wrote, ac
cording to a text released by the official news agency Tass.
"Moreover," he added, "these professions are belied by
practical actions. With each U.S. nuclear missile deployed on
European soil, a new step is made toward a dangerous
line. . . ."
The Soviet leader's comments also came a day after reports
from Washington that the United States and the Soviet Union
have made progress toward opening talks on a new cultural
and scientific exchange agreement to replace one that Wash
ington allowed to expire in 1980 after the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. A new exchange agreement has been seen as a
possible first step toward a more general thaw in the icy rela
tions that now prevail between the two superpowers.
Candidates go to Pennsylvania
Philadelphia — The Democratic presidential campaign
moved into Pennsylvania yesterday, with Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart determined not to let former Vice President Walter
Mandate farce him into another acrimonious debate and with
Mondale prepared to make this campaign look very mcuh like
his successful efforts in Illinois and New York.
Mondale rolled into Philadelphia in mid-afternoon with the
momentum of his big New York victory on Tuesday, while
Hart traveled to a steel plant near Pittsburgh and began to lay
out the "positive" themes that he hopes will bring him a badly
needed victory here.
Jesse Jackson, whose strong third in New York represented
his best day of the campaign, took the train to Philadelphia
and paid a courtesy call on the city's first black mayor, W.
Wilson Goode, and immediately went to work trying to take
the black vote away from Goode's endorsed choice, Mondale.
The three candidates will meet in Pittsburgh for a debate
tonight. The debate is likely to set the tone for the rest of the
brief campaign here and give an indication whether Hart can
campaign successfully without responding to Mondale's at
tacks.
OAS to investigate Orfila
Washington — The Organization of American States voted
yesterday to investigate the actions of its former secretary
general, Alejandro Orfila, who began working for the Wash
ington public relations firm of Gray and Co. three months
before his nine-year term at the OAS ended Saturday.
The investigation, which will also cover Orfila's failure to
file a required financial disclosure statement, was proposed
by the Colombian envoy to the organization, Francisco
Posada de la Pena. It was unanimously endorsed by the 31-
member permanent council during a 3 1-2-hour meeting
dominated by angry denunciations of Orfila's actions.
"I'm truly offended and hurt," said Fernando Salazar
Paredes, the Bolivian ambassador to the OAS. "Gray (and
Co.) in a certain sense has presided over our meetings the last
few months."
The ambassador from Trinidad and Tobago, James O'Neil-
Lewis, delivered one of the strongest statements, saying Or
fila's actions placed the organization "under a shadow of
darkness."
House rejects Reagan budget
Washington — The Democratic-controlled House took a
swipe at President Reagan last night by overwhelmingly
rejecting his original budget for next year as it opened debate
on eight plans for reducing deficits by at least $182 billion
over the next three years.
The vote was 401 to 1, with Republicans joining in voting
against Reagan's plan after angrily complaining that the
Democrats were staging "a sham and a charade" in order to
"embarrass the president." Only Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.),
voted aye.
Reagan's original budget would have produced a larger
deficit than any of the proposals before the House, and he has
since backed away from it and endorsed an alternative.
But the Democrats recalled that Reagan berated Congress
in 1982 and 1983 for not considering his original proposal,
and insisted on giving it "full consideration" this year, as Rep.
Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.) put it in demanding the roll call.
Stocks drift lower as rally fails
New York — Stock prices drifted lower yesterday as a late
attempt at a rally failed amid continued concern over rising
interest rates.
A steady climb in interest rates in the past week not only is
posing a threat to a sustained economic expansion but also is
making returns on bonds, rather than stocks, more attractive.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 25.86
points over the previous four sessions, slipped another .20 to
1148.56. Just an hour before the close, the blue-chip average
had been up nearly 4 points.
