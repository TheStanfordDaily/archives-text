Washington (AP) — The Senate
turned aside a move yesterday to restrict
presidential power to send combat
troops to El Salvador after a debate in
which Democrats charged that President
Reagan is likely to send fighting men into
Central America within the next year.
By a vote of 59-36, the lawmakers
rejected a proposal by Sen. Patrick
Leahy (D-Vt.), to bar the president from
sending U.S. armed forces into El Sal
vador or Salvadoran airspace for combat
unless Congress has declared war or
enacted a specific authorization.
Leahy said he made his move, as an
amendment to an appropriations bill

containing $61.7 million in emergency
military aid for the Salvadoran regime,
because of his "clear conviction that we
are going to reach the point of having
American combat forces in El Salvador
within a year."
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). told
the Senate. "I do not trust that this ad
ministration or the president will not
move to commit American troops in El
Salvador, and I am not prepared to take
the risk."
The Reagan administration has said it
has no plans to send fighting troops to
Central America, but has resisted restric
tions by Congress on the president's

power as commander in chief to order
troops into action.
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.). < 1
posing the amendment, said it was
"dangerous to make assumptions such as
that" and argued that the War Pov\ Lr *
Act already gives Congress sufficient
power over (he deployment of u.»•
troops abroad.
That act says that troops must he
withdrawn from combat situations in
to 90 days unless Congress declares war
or otherwise approves keeping them on
the battlefield.
Supporters of the Leahy amendment
said this was not adequate.

The amendment provided that the
president would he able to send troops
without congressional authorization if
there was danger of an attack upon the
United States or if they were needed to
evacuate American citizens.
It defined sending troops for comhat
as sending them "tor the purpose of
delivering weapons tire upon an enemy."
It provided that resolutions authoriz.
ing the president to send troops would
have to he acted upon by both houses of
Congress within nine days of their intro
duction. and could be acted upon in as
little as three days.
