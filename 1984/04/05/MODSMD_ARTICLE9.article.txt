# U.S. proposes chemical weapon ban

From the Los Angeles Times
Washington â€” President Reagan announced yester
day that a comprehensive U.S. proposal to ban the
"production, possession and use" of chemical and toxic
weapons around the world would be submitted to the
40-nation U.N. Committee on Disarmament in Geneva
in two weeks by Vice President George Bush.
The draft treaty will call for verification measures
that are "bold and sound," Reagan said in his opening
statement at a nationally televised news conference
last night. He did not give details of those
measures, which promise to remain the chief stumbling
block to any agreement.
It was also not immediately clear precisely what
Reagan meant by "chemical and toxic" weapons, but
the U.S. proposal presumably would bar mustard.

nerve and other gases. Germ and biological poisons
that are the products of living organisms would ap
parently not be covered in the proposal.
The president said that the proposed new treaty
showed the continued strong U.S. commitment to arms
control in several areas, including nuclear arms reduc
tions, and expressed his "deep personal regret that the
Soviet Union had not returned to talks on limiting
intermediate-range missiles in Europe and strategic in
tercontinental missiles. Moscow broke off the talks late
last year after U.S. Pershing and cruise missiles were
deployed in Western Europe.
U.S. officials have recently charged that Iraq has
used mustard and nerve gases against Iran in their
three-year-old war. As a result, five chemicals that
could be used as "feed stocks" for production of the

gases have been barred from export from the United
States to both countries.
Reagan said the use of chemicals in the Iraq-Iran
conflict, as well as in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia in
recent years, has made the shortcomings in existing
chemical weapons bans "tragically clear."
The Persian Gulf War added impetus to U.S. efforts
to ban chemical weapons. Secretary of State George
Shultz had announced in January that the United States
planned to introduce a chemical weapons treaty. Inter
agency squabbling, primarily between the Defense and
State departments, blocked agreement on final treaty
language until now, according to White House officials.
The U.S. proposal was also in response to a Soviet
offer more than a year ago to accept continuous on-site
inspection during the destruction of its chemical weap
ons as part of a treaty banning chemical weapons.
