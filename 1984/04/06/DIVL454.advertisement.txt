INTRODUCTORY
BIOPHYSICS
This course is designed for undergraduate and
graduate students who wish to learn about the
physical basis underlying selected topics in contem
porary molecular biology:
• The relation of structure to function — chemical
equilibria and cooperativity.
• Elementary statistical mechanics of conforma
tional changes in biopolymers — proteins and
lipids.
• Chemical kinetics:
Enzyme reactions:
Passive and active transport through membranes
— ionophores, channels and receptors.
• Physics of nerve impulse propagation.
Prerequisites:
Biology 21, Chemistry 30 series, Physics 50 series, or
equivalents; some acquaintance with elementary statisti
cal mechanics.
