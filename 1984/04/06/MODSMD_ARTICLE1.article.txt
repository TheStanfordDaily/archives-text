Some senators did express concern that an approval of
the GPB budget would contradict a by-law which forbids

speaker orginally scheduled to talk at the session, is
already a guest professor here this quarter.

Conference is the culmination of more than a year of plan

proposed by the ASSU Lobby Office and planned in con-
